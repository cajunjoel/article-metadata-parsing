For the Year 1907-8.
Once more we have come to the close of our Society's
year and to the completion of another volume of our Magazine,
and we think that our members may congratulate themselves
that Volume VI. of the New Series is equal to any of its
predecessors. Many articles of great interest and value have
appeared, and we are glad to notice amongst the contributors
several who have not previously written for our journal.
Seven coloured plates by Mr. Herbert GoodChild, and
numerous black and white plates and text figures have been
published, the illustrations being on the whole quite equal, if
not superior, to those which have previously appeared in this
journal.
In the pages of the present volume mention is made of
many species of birds which have been imported alive for the
first time this year ; and accounts are published of the breeding
in captivity of several species which had not previously been
known to rear young in the United Kingdom.
We are glad to be able to report that the Society is in a
sound and prosperous condition, and that the membership con-
tinues to increase in a very satisfactory manner.
Our best thanks are due to those members who, by their
contributions to our pages or in other ways, have helped to make
the present volume a success. Especially we are indebted to
Dr. A. G. Butler for very kindly undertaking the Editorship,
in addition to his duties as Honorary Correspondence Secretary,
during the absence from England of Mr. Seth-Smith.
Signed for the Council,

The Medal may be awarded, at the discretion of the Committee, to
any Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of the hatching of the young, and furnish
such evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require. The
Medal will be awarded onl} r in cases where the young shall live to be old 1
enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will Have great weight when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bond fide property of the
breeder. Any evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only dis-
qualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as circumstances will permit.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right
to issue it in silver in very special cases), and measures 2\ inches in
diameter. It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest
containing eggs, and the words "The Avicultural Society--Founded 1894."
On the reverse is the following inscription : "Awarded to (name op donee)
for rearing young of {name op species ), a species not previously bred in-
captivity in the United Kingdom."

In April, 1905, I was shooting Quail along the banks of
the Modder River in the O.R.C., I was walking in some longish
grass when I saw two Rufous Coursers (Cursorhis rufus) get up
and I was going to shoot when I noticed that they were accom-
panied by a young one, so lowered my gun.
They settled within a hundred yards, and on going up to
the place I saw the young bird squatting like a baby lapwing. I
picked him up and took him home to my aviary, and for the first
few days fed him on white ants and mealworms. I had to watch
him closely while he ate the latter as the various Bulbuls, etc.,
were much too near them to give a stupid baby much of a
chance. When I caught him he was simply covered with bird
lice, but a dusting of Keating's insect powder soon got rid of
them.
Some weeks later I got a young Rufous Courser, which is
the same sized bird as the Double Ringed. I put him into the
aviary thinking he would be a cheerful companion for my first
friend, but he met a speedy death instead. The bird even at that
early stage being of a very quarrelsome disposition with other
ground birds.
In June I managed to get him on to Century Food, but it
was not until July 2nd that he started developing the distinctive
double rings round his neck, which caused me to realise that I

Capt. Boyd Horsbrugh,
had made a complete mistake about this species. The two old
birds that were with him the day I found him were most certainly
C. rufus and so I can only conclude that his own parents were
hiding somewhere near.
The young bird quickly got his double rings and was in
complete adult plumage by the end of July, which is our cold
weather. He had no shelter from cold and thrived well in spite
of it, and as a matter of fact he was neither sick nor sorry during
the entire time I kept him in South Africa, although exposed
more or less to all weathers; in heavy rains we did try to shelter
him, but it was no easy matter as he was such a restless being,
and also he looked upon the shelters with some suspicion and
preferred to paddle about outside in the wet.
His juvenile plumage was exactly like the adult plumage
but lacked the black necklaces. Sclater says of it " This
interesting little species is found all over the Karro districts of
the Cape Colony, the O.R.C., S.W. part of the Transvaal,
Bechuanaland, and German territory, but is not found in the
eastern part of Cape Colony, Natal, or Rhodesia as far as our
present knowledge goes.
It is found in open country in pairs or small parties, it runs
swiftly and is most difficult to flush. In most places it is more
abundant in the rainy season than in winter and is probably a
partial migrant. It feeds in the wild state chiefly on ants
(white) and, as I am informed by Major Sparrow, lays one egg
only on the bare ground in a slight depression.
With all respect to my friend Major Sparrow, my brother
and I have both found clutches of two eggs on various occasions.
The eggs are very handsome, being pale in colour thickly
covered with fine lines, both straight and curved, of a yellowish
brown ; the shape is a rounded oval, with but slight indication
of the pointed end, and the measurements average i'2 X I&amp;apos;o. I
found this bird to be semi-nocturnal in both the wild and the
tame state, the large and liquid eyes also point to this.
When adult, my bird began his evening song just after
sunset and our bridge evenings were enlivened by his mournful
whistle, which was surprisingly clear and loud for his size, and

often I have heard this same whistle late at night when
camping out.
I kept R. bicinctus for fifteen months in my aviary at
Bloemfontein and took him home with me last July to the
Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park, where he was still alive
when I last heard of him. I took him home in a box with a
carefully padded top and had the good fortune to have enough
mealworms to feed him on, and on these and chopped cooked
meat he did quite well. He was always delightfully tame
and set up an impatient whistle when his dinner was not up
to time. This species does not bathe often, I only saw him do
so twice, but he likes a dust bath. He was a bit of a fad about
his food and got greatly excited when Barbets, Bulbuls, Glossy
Starlings, etc., came down for a share of his saucer, instead of
staying by his dinner steadily eating he would chase all round
the aviary after one bird and leave six eating hard, then return,
have one peck, and then off again after somebody else so that
he really worked quite hard for his living. On the ground he
was more or less master and inclined to be a bully, so that I was
rather amused one day to see him lying stretched out in the sun
while a Violet-eared Waxbill preened his feathers for him. Birds
of the size of Zosterops and Waxbills he did not mind, probably
considering them beneath his notice, but he had an especial
dislike of the Starlings.
This bird is quite common near Potchefstroon, Transvaal,
where I am now stationed, and generally speaking all over this
part of the Transvaal. It should be comparatively easy to collect
one or two of this species, which I very much wish to do, but
unfortunately I have not yet had the luck to find them. I hope
I may be more fortunate in the spring for I very much wish to
keep again the little Ringed Courser or "Dravelkie" as the
Boers call it.

By the Duchess oe Bedford.
Having read Mr. Astley's article on " The Cranes" in the
last number of the Avicultural Magazine , I think the following
notes may be of interest to some of your readers.
The following Cranes have bred at Woburn :--
The Common Crane ( Grus communis&amp;apos;).
The Sarus Crane ( Grus col laris).
The Demoiselle Crane (. Anthropoides virgo).
The White-necked Crane (. Anthropoides leucachen).
The following have nested but have never hatched out:--
The Australian Crane ( Grus aiistralasiana).
The Stanley Crane {Anthropoides paradisea).
The Mantchurian Crane ( Grus japo?iensis) has made a
nest and sat upon a Rhea's egg which it found in the Park, but
they have never laid at&amp;apos;Woburn.
The following Cranes have been in the collection, but have
never nested : --
The American Crane ( Grus americana).
The Canadian Crane ( Grus Ca?iadensis).
The Wattled Crane (. Anthropoides carunculata) a single bird.
The Asiatic White Crane {Anthropoides leucogeramis).
The Demoiselle and Common Cranes have raised their
young to maturity.
The White-necked, which have hatched on four occasions,
have been unlucky, the young, when well grown, having been
drowned in the ponds or killed by other animals.
The young Sarus Crane was also drowned when half

some copy would be acceptable but, though the spirit is willing,
I regret that I have so little of interest to record. The fact is

this season. From the commencement of May until the end of
July my aviaries had to look after themselves and, when I was
again able to resume the management of them, I found that
losses had been so heavy that I had very little material to work
with. This is the more annoying because at the time I was
taken ill I had some rather interesting nests, namely one of the
Violet-eared Waxbill (two young), Lesser Ruddy Waxbill (two
young), Blue-breasted Waxbill (eggs), Rufous-backed Mannikin
(one young), Grey-necked Serin (three young), and Ouail Finch
(eggs). None of these young birds came to maturity. I have
also had eggs from the Blue Grosbeak, two nests and one egg
from the Violet Tanager, one young Sulphury Seedeater, and a
nest (presumably containing eggs) on which a hen Paradise
Whydali sat steadily for some time. One may talk about the
weather, bad luck, etc., but the fact remains that from all the
above nothing has been satisfactorily reared except one young
Serinus ango/ensis, two young Chingolos, and a large number of
Bengalee-Striateds, etc.
Certainly there are times and seasons when the possession
of .an aviary is anything but a source of pleasure. Indeed, were
it not that the aviculturist is born and not made, I doubt if any
sensible person would ever enter upon so difficult, laborious, and
expensive a hobby. However, in the long run he has his rewards
if he be a genuine ornithologist, and perhaps one of the chief of
these is to be able now and again to see the nesting operations of
a really rare bird.
Needless to say the subject of the present notes does not
come under this category, lor the Chingolo is quite a common
South American species and, as far as my experience goes, quite
an easy one to breed. It would not in the least surprise me to
hear that it has already been bred and possibly several times
over. Our Editor writes me that he has succeeded in crossing
this with an allied species.
I think it has before been remarked in our Magazine that
the term Song Sparrow is more or less of a misnomer, as applied
to this species, for its song is certainly not remarkable and it is
more nearly allied to the Buntings than to the Sparrows.

1905, but they made 110 attempt to nest. I11 March, 1906, the
same birds commenced to carry building materials into a small
cupressus and, to give them a better chance, I enclosed them
and the cupressus and a pair of Accentors (which also
seemed inclined to nest) with some herring netting. It is
curious that the Accentors, though generally such shy birds,
nested successfully under these conditions, but the Chingolos at
once suspended operations. I then removed them to the
Waxbill's aviary where, to my great astonishment, I one day
found two nests, within a few inches of one another, one contain-
ing three and the other two eggs, and one Chingolo sitting in
each ! I11 a word the}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were two hens.
The sexual characteristics of this species do not seem at
all well marked. I selected these two birds with some care.
One was a larger bolder bird and had a much more pronounced
crest--but it was a hen for all that.
This season I was not satisfied until I had obtained a bird
that actually sang, and then, having caught up one of my last
year's birds, I was reasonably sure that I had a pair. I really,
however, can see very little difference between them, so far as
their outward and visible form is concerned, save that the
chestnut patch on the neck of the male is certainly brighter.
As this species has with me proved itself far from amiable
in general company, I turned them out by themselves in a
breeding pen this spring.
I11 their new quarters the male soon commenced to sing.
I think the song of this species must vary a good deal in
individuals. The Zoological Society turned out a good many
Chingolos in a pen near the Monkey House this summer, and I
noticed that several of them were singing quite a bright little
refrain consisting of a few preliminary staccato notes and ending
with a kind of trill, but my bird can only produce a monotonous
phrase consisting of generally only four notes, sibilant and long
drawn out, reminding one of the silvery cadence of the Willow
Warbler.
I regret that this season, for the reasons given above, I
have not been able to enter dates in my note book, but towards
the middle of July I first noticed the hen sitting. Owing to the

awkward position of the nest I could not see exactly how many
eggs she was incubating, When she had sat three weeks I
concluded the eggs were unfertile and turned a second hen
into the enclosure. Apparently on the principle that " two is
company : three is none " the original pair fell upon the new
comer and the following day I had the mortification of removing
its mangled remains.
Matters now resumed their former course--the hen sitting
steadity, the cock singing industriously.
After incubation had proceeded in this way for a month I
examined the nest carefully and, to my very great astonishment,
found that it contained four eggs and two young birds only a few
days of age I can only explain this by assuming that the hen
laid three eggs, sat a fortnight, then laid three more eggs and sat
another fortnight--an event which has never occurred before in
1113&amp;apos;- aviaries.
The eggs I examined in 1906 had a white ground colour,
but this season's eggs were of a light bluish green with spots and
blotches of light brown and olive, the spots in some cases
forming a ring round the larger end of the egg, as with our
Red-backed Shrike. The eggs are large for the size of the bird.
The young birds had some whitish down on their heads
and backs. They grew and feathered very rapidty, the hen
doing nearly all the feeding, and taking nothing to the young
but live insect food.
On leaving the nest the } r oung had the two broad bands
on the head dark brown instead of black ; the cheek markings
and the black stripes behind and below the eye similar to the
adults, but no chestnut patches on the&amp;apos;neck; the scapulars not
so boldly striped and instead of the uniform grey tone of the
breast of the adults, a light brown ground colour closely spotted
with dark brown, like a Skylark. The head markings soon be-
came darker, and the spots began to disappear from the lower
part of the breast. The young very quickly became independent
and are now flourishing.
I should think this is a very likely species to have been
bred as it seems hardy and easily acclimatised, but I have
not yet been able to hear of a definite instance. Mr. Pocock

writes me that the Zoological Society has not yet succeeded in
producing any young Chingolos.
P.S.--I see in Dr. Butler's most excellent Handbook on
" Foreign Bird Keeping " the statement that " the nest is built
in a depression on the earth : very rarel}' in a bush or on a
stump." The four nests built in my aviaries (and the hen is now
building a fifth) have all been placed in shrubs about four feet
from the ground.
P.S.--Oct. 22. After the fifth nest had been removed this
hen constructed a sixth at the very highest point in the enclosure,
7ft. 6iu. from the ground, and again laid three eggs.

I was away from home when the nest was started, and also
after September 4th, so cannot say very much about the progress
of the building. The cock had been carrying hay about for some
time. A small portion of an ant-hill was put in the aviary every
day, but latterly there have not been many ants' cocoons in the
heap, so that the birds must have either eaten the ants or the
other insects found in the earth.
The parent birds have been in my possession two years and
have wintered out-of-doors.
August 13th. Rufous-tails in out-door aviary reported as
sitting on three eggs ; certainly four or five laid, as ascertained
later.
August 19th. One chick hatched.
August 27th (or about that date) two chicks ; two eggs
dropped through the very loosely woven hay of the nest, which
was shaped rather like an egg standing on its small end, with the
opening high up on one side facing S.W. It was made of coarse
hay, lined with moulted Canary feathers and firmly fixed to a big
Mediterranean heath bush about 4ft. 6in. from the ground.
Chicks had dark grey down, with black and white speckles on
the wing-feathers.

young Canary's squeak and the adult Rufous-tail call-note.

I have long wanted to possess a Trumpeter Bird and was
fortunate in securing the only one Mr. Harper brought from
tropical America last July. Having had it barely three months
I have much to learn and feel anxious as to how it will stand a
winter out-of-doors even in a very sheltered garden. I have
been told that these birds do not live long in England, which, I
suppose, is the reason why they are difficult to obtain. I cannot
imagine they would do well in an aviary however large, as they
require a great deal of exercise and liberty and much attention
and petting bestowed upon them. My bird is always anxiously
looking out, and runs to meet me every time I enter the garden,
and I find it difficult to leave him for many hours. I have read
of the extraordinary courage of the Trumpeter and have now had
proof of it. He made himself master of my five Cranes as soon
as he arrived, not by bullying and worrying them, but simply
shewing them he would be first. When any grain is thrown, he
rushes with his beak wide open at each Crane in turn and they
fly up over his head to escape, and yet he does not care for corn
but will eat it rather than see them do so. In their own country
the " Agami " (as the natives call the Trumpeter Bird) is trained
to drive sheep and poultry. Perhaps mine has had this training,
for Mr. Harper tells me it is hand-reared and he procured him

from the Aborigines. At any rate he assists energetically in
driving up the Crowned Crane, jumping up at his head from one
side to the other and even springing on to the Crane's back and
pecking violently at the crest feathers if the Crane tries to dodge
back, but he, I am glad to say, has lately had the sense to go to
bed earlier and goes to the far end of the house which the two
birds share. Like the Cranes, the Trumpeter roosts standing on
one leg, but not on the ground. He climbs into a pear tree, and
is anxious to remain out, but, acting on advice, I harden my
heart and take him down by force in spite of kicks and struggles.
As a compromise, I have had the branch he prefers cut from the
tree and put into his house. Referring again to the Trumpeter's
pluck I have seen it make a rush at a cat and even at a small dog,
but fortunately their owners came to the rescue. Also he had a
fight with my Swinhoe Pheasant and came off with a bleeding
head. The photograph gives an excellent idea of his appearance.
He is not larger than a fowl, but his legs and neck being so
much longer make him appear tall. The whole plumage is black
except a sprinkling of feathers on the neck and breast which are
tipped with green changing into violet, according to the light.
The little soft round head looks as if covered with black plush or
velvet. Across the middle of the back and wing coverts is a
brownish patch, which passes into ash colour lower down. The
legs are very faintly tinged with green. The voice of the
Trumpeter is most peculiar, a sort of low hollow sound made
with the beak shut, when the bird is excited.
I give it grasshoppers, centipedes, caterpillars, and all the
insects I can get, as it prefers them to any food. Also worms, of
which it will eat any quantity. It also has boiled rice and hard-
boiled eggs. Occasionally a little potatoe and banana.
It is a very clean bird, and follows me into the house and
from one room to another, often perching on chairs and tables,
where it stands preening itself. One of its pretty ways is to
stand and hold out its head and neck to be stroked. It will
remain in this position for some minutes, but moves away
directly its body is touched.

DEMERARA.
By E. William Harpkr, F.Z.S.
Perhaps it may not be out of place to remind our readers
that Georgetown, the chief town of Demerara--*" where the sugar
comes from "--and capital of British Guiana, is situate on the
coast at the mouth of the river Demerara in lat. about 7 0 N. It
must not, however, be conjectured that, from its close proximity
to the equator, Georgetown is a very hot place ; for, thanks to
the trade-winds which blow for about ten months in the year, the
average temperature is only 84*. During August and September,
in the absence of the " trades," it gets a little hotter ; whilst
during December and January it may be said to be really cold
at nights, when a blanket may be styled a blessing. Demerara
is low-lying and therefore damp, with a necessarily humid
atmosphere.
Before coming to the birds, I may state that the blacks of
the colony are not aviculturists--a direct contrast to what one
finds in the east, where real enthusiasm and skill amongst the
natives exist. The visitor to Georgetown is sure sooner or later
\0x25A0to make the acquaintance of a well-known local character,
-namely, a Portuguese bird-seller, who meets all mail steamers.
If he cannot manage to get an interview on the landing-stage, he
will make it his business to find out where you are staying--not
a difficult matter where " whites " are in the minority--and give
you a call; when you will have an opportunity of inspecting his
live-stock, which generally consists, besides birds, of monkeys
and curios obtained from the aborigines in the interior. The
small birds are confined in cages or " quakes"--baskets made of
cane-work with a mesh varying from half an inch to one inch--
which are suspended in a row from a bamboo carried horizontally
in one hand ; in the other hand is generally another bamboo with
a row of Parrots and Macaws sitting upon it, each tied b} r one
leg. Some of the monkeys sit upon the bamboo above the
" quakes" and cages ; whilst others enjoy more exalted positions
upon the shoulders or head of the vendor.
To begin with the Parrots : in the general market--where,

Mr. E. W. Harper,
in addition to provisions, fruit, meat, fish, ice, poultry, etc., birds
are always on sale--Parrots " in bulk " (to use a commercial
expression) are kept by dealers in packing-cases, provided with
perches and covered with wire netting. Their chief food whilst
awaiting purchasers consists of sugar-cane and maize ; water, I
regret to state, is in some cases very seldom given. Considering
that a sugar-cane about ten feet long and an inch and a half thick
can be bought for id., this diet is decidedly economical ; it is
also much relished by the Parrots, which obtain from it food,
moisture and occupation. That bete-noire of Parrot-keepers-
--feather-plucking--is seldom seen. The commonest Parrot,
and I might almost say the commonest cage-bird , in Georgetown
is the Orange-winged Amazon (Chrysotis amazonica&amp;apos;), known
locally as the "screecher"--a name which it well deserves. In
private houses these birds are often chained by one leg to a
horizontal perch, nailed at right-angles to a board which hangs-
against the wall. They are also confined in circular-topped wire
cages about fifteen inches in diameter, fitted beneath with an
outside tin tray, through the turned-up edges of which a metal
pin runs. These excellent cages can be purchased for about 4/-
each, and last for years. Cheaper Parrot-cages have a solid tin.
top and bottom, with hollow tin bars and sliding door. As-
these have no removable bottom, the bird is able to enjoy a bath,
from the splashing which takes place during the weekly or
bi-weekly cleansing of the cage under the water tap. The local
price of the " screecher " is about 4/-. Many of them are hand-
reared by the aboriginal Indians, who bring them down the river
to town and sell them to local dealers. I once saw an East
Indian --an ex-cooly immigrant--with about two dozen adult
freshly-caught "screechers" in a box exposed for sale on the
foot-path at 2/6 each. They were savage as wolves, " going for "
the hand of the intruder with beak and claw. I11 answer to my
inquiry as to how he had caught them, the vendor said it was
done by slipping a noose, attached to the end of a stick, over the
head of the bird at night as it sat in a tree ; the catcher stealthily
climbing the tree for the purpose. Whether he was telling the
truth or not--perhaps looking on me as a rival catcher--I cannot
say ; but that is the method adopted in catching tree-lizards. In

addition to sugar cane and maize, private owners also give tlieir
Parrots red and green capsicum, plantain, and bread soaked in
coffee. Plantains are a kind of bananas, but harder and less
sweet than the latter. There is a foolish superstition amongst
the natives that bananas prevent linguistic ability in Parrots;
and that they will kill the bird if persistently given.
Other Amazons commonly kept are the Yellow-fronted
(Chrysalis ochrocephala ) called the " Amazon," and the Mealy (C.
fcirinosa ) or " Saurama."
The Red-vented Parrot (Pionus menstruus), and less
frequently the Dusky (A*, fuscus ) and the Black-headed Caique
(Caica melanocephala )--always hand-reared by the aborigines--
are sometimes on view. A red-vented which I possessed used
to spend more time outside its cage than in it; and became
rather a nuisance by caressing my face when I was asleep. The
Hawk-headed Caique (Deroptyzcs accipitrinus) is rare. One be-
longing to a negress used to have its liberty in a tree over her
house ; and although I offered her a good price, she refused to
sell. When I called sometime afterwards to increase my offer, I
found the bird had died ; and upon my saying " It serves yon
right," she acquiesced with a broad grin, disclosing a lovely set
of teeth.
There are generally a few Macaw&amp;apos;s on view, the commonest
being the Blue and Yellow (Ara ararauna), I had one which
was so tame it would follow me about outside. A fine pair of
the Red and Blue ( A. macao ) are at liberty in the splendid
Botanical Gardens; spending the day in the trees, and retiring
at night to the shelter of an aviary. The Red and Yellow (A.
chlorop ter a),Hahn &amp;apos;s (A. hahni), and another small green species
called the "Eta" Macaw (named A. macavuanna in the local
museum, but which I have been unable to verify elsewhere) are
also occasionally to be seen. Two young ones of the last-named
species were fed for weeks and reared by my tame Red-vented
Parrot, already mentioned ; and very comical it was to see them
running about the floor after their smaller foster-parent, which
regurgitated the food for their benefit in proper parrot fashion.
Of Conures, the Yellow (Conurus solstitialis), called locally
the " kissi-kissi," and the Blue-winged (Pyrrhura picta ) or

" scaly-breasted" are amongst those species sometimes kept. The
commonest is the Brown-throated (C. cerugmosus), which is some-
times hawked about the streets in a freshly-caught condition,
and can be observed flying in small flocks just outside the town.
The Golden-winged Parrakeet ( Brotogerys tuipara ), so destructive
to the woodwork of cages, is not uncommon. The Guiana
Love Birds {Psittamla gidanensis) appear to be all imported from
the neighbouring colony of Dutch Guiana : they breed freely in
captivity in quite small cages, the cock being very fussy when
he becomes a father. Although owing to the "safety in
numbers" several dozen may be put together, yet two pairs in one
cage cannot agree, as I proved to my cost--one cock promptly
killing the other. A few African Greys are occasionally
imported, either direct from West Africa by sailing-ship, or via
Madeira.
The Toucans, called locally "bill birds"--those beaky
birds reminding one so much of the Horubills of the Old World
--should perhaps be mentioned next. Dealers tell me that
they do not find a read}&amp;apos;'sale ; but young hand-reared birds are
occasionally seen. It is astonishing how tame these birds
become : I have seen one, which was allowed its liberty in a
small garden, hopping into a crowded street in which trams were
continously passing. One which I possessed was allowed to
come out of its &amp;apos;cage daily to bathe in a wash-hand basin ; at
night it roosted upon a towel-horse, turning its tail over its back
in true Toucan fashion. The two species most often met with are
the Sulphur-and-white-breasted ( Ramphastos vitellinus ) and the
Toco ( R. toco).
Next to the Parrots in point of favour as cage birds come
the Finches. They are generally kept in well-made wire cages,
each provided with a sliding drawer at one end for seed, and a
wooden false-bottom. Sand is never given. On one occasion
I was explaining to a man how important it was that Finches
should be supplied with sand, when he replied quite seriously, " I
think they prefer seed ! " It may surprise our members to hear
that owing to a specific duty on bird-seed, canary-seed is retailed
in Georgetown at 5d. and 6d. per lb. Cages containing small
birds can safely be hung out of doors in Demerara, owing to the

absence of Crows and Kites, which make such a proceeding
impossible in the Eastern tropics. Though somewhat of a
digression, it may be mentioned that there are no Sparrows in
the Colony. After not having seen them for over three years,
they now appear larger to me than formerly--certainly their
impudence has not decreased. Bird-lime--the milky exudation
from a tree--and trap cages are the means of capture principally
adopted. This local bird-lime has the disadvantage that, unless
it is removed at once with oil, the birds' feet are liable to suffer
on account of its irritating properties.
The seed-eater most commonly kept is the Field Saffron
Finch (Sycalis arvensis), with its rasping song, like the running
down of a watch-spring. This bird is known locally as the
"colony canary" and "bastard canary." The mortality amongst
freshly-caught seed-eaters is considerable, owing to their being
fed immediately after capture upon hard seed, instead of first
softening it by soaking in water. Another fatal practice is that
of overcrowding the cages so that the drinking water becomes
fouled.
Undoubtedly the best songster in the colony is the Thick-
billed Seed Finch (Orizoborus crassirostris) or " twa-twa " ; and a
good performer fetches a high price. Although this species
prefers paddy-rice to canary seed it is thoughtlessly fed upon the
latter : in spite of the fact that the former, being grown upon the
spot, is only about a fourth the price. Old male " twa-twas" are
black with light-coloured beaks ; old females are brown, also
with light beaks. The young of both sexes are brown with black
beaks. The colour-change in the males takes place apparently
at the age of about a year, or perhaps a few mouths less ; the
black appearing gradually in a patchy manner. Almost like an
undersized " twa-twa " in build, but with a chestnut-breast and
abdomen, is the "towa-towa" or Tropical Seed Finch (&amp;lt; 9 . torridus).
Like the young " twa-twa" the immature "towa-towa" is brown,
and the song of the latter, though not equalling that of its larger
relation, is still very sweet.
The genus Spermophila contains some interesting and
favourite species: the White-throated Finch or "ring-neck" (\0x25BAS&amp;apos;.
albigularis ); the Lavender-backed Finch or "blue-back" (S.

(S. lineola ); and the Black-headed Lined Finch (S&amp;apos;, ocellata).
The two last named are called " moustache birds " ; whilst the
whole of the genus are spoken of as " grass-birds." The imma-
ture males of all the five species just mentioned are brown, vary-
ing somewhat in intensity ; the three first-mentioned species sing.
By the bye, natives of Demerara speak of singing as " rattling."
Although our Magazine does not cater for Canaries, these
notes would not be complete without including these ubiquitous
birds ; their chief admirers appear to be the Portuguese--of
whom there is quite a large population in the colony--who im-
port the birds in cane cages from Madeira. Along with the
Canaries come a few Goldfinches from the same island.

Rolluhis roulroul.
By Sir William Ingram, Bart.
I believe it may safely be said that until my two Roulroul
Partridges hatched their chicks no young of this rare species
had ever been seen by a civilized human being. I have been
informed that eggs have been produced in this country (at the
Zoological Gardens), but in this case the female would not
incubate them.
My two birds were bought from a dealer in Marseilles in
1905, and in 1906 laid four eggs which were successfully hatched,
but all four chicks were a few days afterwards destroyed by rats.
This year, the parents again succeeded in hatching three
young birds, two of which, unfortunately, died a few days after
leaving the eggs, but one survived for over three weeks. I
attribute the death of this last bird to unsuitability of food, 110
ants' eggs being procurable, or perhaps the excessive heat may
have been the cause of their decease.
The parents have lived since I bought them in one of my
aviaries at Monte Carlo. They are not very shy birds except

perhaps during the breeding season. The female constructs a
curious domed nest, which is very cunningly concealed among
the grasses and brushwood of the aviary. The dome is
considerably flattened with a small and proportionately low
aperture. It is constructed of dry grasses and as in the last
nest, of fronds of dead palm leaves.
Once the female has completed her nest the male keeps as
far as possible from his partner's abode, and leaves all the sitting
to his mate. She seldom leaves the nest and then only for a
very short time, always closing up the entrance during her
absence.
It is after eighteen days' incubation that the chicks
emerge from their eggs, and when first born are sweet little
fluffy beings of a dark chocolate colour. Although the head of
one that died a day after its birth shewed indications of a reddish
tinge when under close inspection, the chick, of which an
illustration is given, is the one that survived over three weeks,
and I infer it may have been a female as I could find no indica-
tion of reddish colour on its head ; this, I should say, is confined
to the male chicks.
Both parents fed the young, food being taken from their
beaks when they had picked up any dainty bit, the while calling
their little ones with a low-tuned chirp.
In the week before the death of the last chick, the female
Roulroul built three more nests, all domed like the one in
which the bird deposited her eggs. Could these have been
constructed as hiding places for her baby? They certainly were
not used for a second clutch of eggs, as the female had not begun
to lay again.
I hope next year I may be more successful. A good
supply of fresh ants' eggs shall be ready, one or two eggs shall
be reserved for an incubator, aud an attempt to hand-rear them
made in the same way that Mr. Seth-Smith did so successfully
with his Hemipodes.

advanced that I have little doubt, even at this early age, it could
fly well as is the case with the precocious young of many other
Gallinaceous birds. The rectrices were also developed. The

The difficulty of determining the sex of those birds in
which the plumage is superficially alike in both male and female
is one that troubles the majority of aviculturists perhaps as
frequently as any other matter that may arise in connection with
their hobby. What can be more annoying, after having paid a
high price for a couple of very rare birds which it is hoped, in
course of time to breed, than to discover that both belong to the
same sex ? With many birds, of course, the sexes, when adult,
are perfectly distinct, but in such cases the young males often
resemble the female, and the tyro may find that after a time his
"hen" commences to show bright feathers, and eventually
" turns into a cock." In other species, such as the Weavers, the
males assume their characteristic plumage only for a certain
period of each year, at other times being more or less similar to
the females.
Thus the aviculturist, unless he is quite experienced, is
beset with difficulties and may very easily make mistakes in
selecting his birds if he relies upon his own judgment, or the
word of the dealer from whom he purchases.
Dr. Butler, who is always ready to help in avicultural
matters, has spared no pains in the preparation of one of the
most useful helps to the aviculturist that has appeared for a
long time. "How to Sex Cage Birds" ("The Feathered
World" office, 9, Arundel Street, W.C., price 3/6), deals with
every species that the ordinary mortal is likely to come across
and many more as well, and where there is a means of dis-
tinguishing the sexes the author has pointed it out.

CAGE BIRD TRAFFIC IN THE UNITED STATES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995868827586207" page_id="32668955"  page_num="Page 41" year="" vol="">
We have received a pamphlet, published by the United
States Department of Agriculture and written by Mr, Henry
Oldys, relating to the traffic in Cage Birds in the United States,
which is instructive and interesting reading. Aviculture is quite
in its infancy amongst the Americans, and there is very little
interest taken in the breeding of foreign species if we may judge
from the meagre list given of the species that have bred there ;
nevertheless the interest is certainly increasing and there is a
rapidly growing demand for rare birds.
Canaries, of course, form the bulk of the cage birds
imported into the United States, nearly 27S thousand being
received, mostly from Germany, in the year ending June 30th,
1906. In the same year some fifty thousand "miscellaneous"&amp;apos;
birds arrived, of which some 6,000 were Parrots (including
Lories, Parrakeets, &amp;c.). The number of Budgerigars imported
was 5.387, a few of which were of the yellow variety.
The Java Sparrows imported reached a total of 6,285,
Liothrix 4,539.
On the whole the prices of the common foreign birds are
much higher in the United States than in Europe, which possibly
partly accounts for the small amount of interest taken in
aviculture in the United States compared with the Old World.
The author of the report, in concluding, deals with the
opportunity for American enterprise that is presented by the
fact that so many birds can be bred in captivity, and the large
and rapidly growing demand that is springing up for cage birds
in the United States. At present this demand is satisfied by
importation from abroad, but it is suggested that the industry of
raising birds might be established, and the American market

The Eleventh Annual Report of the New York Zoological
Society contains a very interesting paper on Owls by Mr. Beebe.
It is divided into two parts, the first giving an account of Owls
in general, in which the author deals exhaustively with their
habits, structure, and so forth ; the second being a special
account of the Owls of the Nearctic region, most of the
American species being figured from photographs.
" Only in the last few years," the author remarks, " when
our grain crops reach from ocean to ocean, and the devastation
of hordes of mice have touched one of the deepest chords of man's
nature--his purse--is the Owl getting due credit for his value and
economic importance. If every Owl on our Continent was
suddenly swept out of existence, it is doubtful if, after a few years,
a single crop of grain could be raised successfully. It would take
the mice and other rodents and many injurious insects little time
to confine all their ravages to the hours of darkness. Hawks
would in such an event become almost useless to man, and though
weasels and minks might increase prodigiousl}^, yet without the
deadly sweep of the Owl, the mice would soon overrun the laud."
Dealing with Owls in captivity an interesting point is
mentioned regarding the Snowy Owl; special arrangements, we
are told, must be made for the birds during the moult, in a hot
climate, "they will not moult well or live long if compelled to
endure the heat of our southern summer, but if confined to a
large flying cage in a cool, dark cellar, every feather will be
moulted in as perfect condition as if they had spent the preceding
months in their native tundras of the Arctic zone."

The experiment, organized by members of the Avicultural Societ3 r ,
of liberating a number of Crested and other species of foreign doves in the
Zoological Gardens, seems to have been quite a success, so far at least as
the Crested species ( Ocyphaps lopholes) is concerned. These birds have
apparently bred freely during the summer, one nest, in a tree near the
Goose paddocks having produced at least three pairs of young birds. The
keeper who feeds the doves told the writer that one morning no less than
fourteen Crested Doves were feeding together on the corn he had thrown
down. They allowed him to approach to within a few yards, and he esti-
mated that about half of these were young birds.
The Roulroul Partridge, or Red-crested Wood-Partridge, of whose
nesting habits in captivity Sir William Ingram gives so interesting an
account in this month's Avicultural Magazine is perhaps the most beautiful
Partridge in existence. The prevailing colour is bright green, with a steel
blue gloss in the male ; the wings are rich brown, and the head black, but
ornamented with a long hairy maroon-coloured crest and a white band
between the eyes. It is a purely forest-loving species, inhabiting Siam, the
Malay Peninsula, Java and Borneo, and in a wild state it lives on berries,
seeds, green food of various kinds and insects. So far as I am aware no
account of the nest has previously been published.
A Correspondent of The Standard who, if I mistake not, is a well
known Zoological writer and a member of the Avicultural Society, des-
cribing Herr P&amp;apos;ocklemann's interesting collection of wild animals, etc., at
Hamburg writes :--" Of late there has been in England a quite justifiable
outcry against the condition of some of the bird shops. If all such estab-
lishments were conducted on similar lines to those adopted at Gross-
Borstel there would be no cause for complaint. The guiding principles are
extremely simple--ample space, absolute cleanliness, and plenty of fresh
air." Let us hope that the English dealers will take the hint.
In Canary arid Cage Bird-Life of September 20, a correspondent
records the successful breeding of Avadavats in his outdoor aviary, three
3'oung birds being reared.
" The birds built a domed nest of dry grasses, warmly lined with
feathers in the outer portion of the aviaiy some time about the end of July,
in a small privet bush, thick with undergrowth, about 6 in. from the ground,
and laid four small white eggs, three of which proved fertile."
The young birds, up to about nineteen days were fed by both parents,
chiefly on insect food, which they caught amongst the vegetation in the

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE KING IBIS.
Sir, --I enclose a photo, of a pair of King Ibis, or Warty-headed Ibis
(.Inocotis papillosus), which I have this summer obtained from India. I
understand these birds are rarely kept in this country, though I may be
wrong.
The large white patch on the wing-slioulder (hardly visible in the
bird on the left side of the photo.), is very conspicuous when the birds fly.
The rest of the plumage is brown and dark purple green. The head is
nude and covered 011 the top with red dots. The birds are considerably
larger than the Glossy Ibis.
I am told they ought to be omnivorous, but my birds much prefer
meat to anything else. I have attempted to get them to eat meal, etc., by
mixing it up with the meat, but this is a failure, as tliej&amp;apos; carefully take each
piece of meat and wash it in their little pond before eating.
Like other Ibises they are very fond of perching, and of course
take small gravel. They seem of an entirely peaceable disposition, and
their quaint ways are very interesting. What will be the result upon
them of an English winter remains to be seen. They revel in full sunshine.
However, as they are now in excellent health and have a good shelter-shed
facing South, I am hoping for the best.

TANAGERS, Etc.
Sir,--I n Vol. VI. (First Series ), pages 103 and 212 of Avicultural
Magazine peat moss litter is recommended as being good to cover the
bottoms of cages or aviaries in which are kept soft food birds, and a certain
firm is mentioned as supplying a special kind for this purpose. I recently
wrote to the said firm asking about this peat moss but received 110 reply.
My reason for troubling you with this note is to enquire whether you
could kindly tell me of anyone selling this stuff. I have five Tanagers of the
small sorts, e.g. Superb, Emerald-grass, Violet, etc. which I am at present
keeping in a cage 5ft. long, 2ft. wide, 3ft. high, back of wood which extends
to about gin. on two ends and top. Sand, I found is of no use for these
birds, and sifted earth is not much better.
Whilst on this topic I am anxious, if possible, to ascertain the best
mixture for these birds; that sold by Abrahams I notice often mentioned

in the Magazine. I have given Arthur's mixture mixed with potato and
carrot to my Tanagers, and this they sometimes eat and sometimes will not
touch ; but I notice these birds greatly differ in their tastes for food.
I am hoping next year to build an outdoor aviary for Tanagers only.
At present in an outdoor aviary with a shelter I have several Gouldians and
a pair of Bullfinches, these latter always go to the shelter at night whilst
the Gouldians remain out amongst the bushes; this I suppose does not
matter, as they choose it of their own will.
A. Aitchison (F.Z.S.)
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Aitchison:
I never use peat moss litter myself and have no idea where you could
get it. I always recommend sea-sand (the sharp sand used by builders) for
all kinds of birds : I find that it suits my Tanagers very well, although
naturally they make it pretty wet with their daily bath. Would not cocoa-
nut fibre answer your purpose?
Although, as a rule, Tanagers eat very little beyond the egg and ants'
eggs in an insectivorous mixture, I give mine the same food which I provide
for all nn&amp;apos; insectivorous birds, viz.--two parts crumbled stale household
bread, one part powdered biscuit, one part egg (either preserved or hard-
boiled and crushed through a masher) and one part Trower's "Improved
Cecto " or " Century Food." I also give at this season ripe pear and banana
and later ripe orange and banana daily. Occasionally insects in some form
are given alive, or, if a bird gets out of condition, one or two spiders. Thus
fed I have kept two cock Scarlet Tanagers since 1897 and an Archbishop
Tanager since the end of 1903 in perfect condition.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Abrahams have passed into another state of
existence, I don't suppose the food is now obtainable.
I think if you were to stick some dense brush-wood in the sheltered
part of your aviary, you would find that theGouldian Finches would prefer
that to bushes in the open; mine have always done so.

Sir, --With reference to the interesting article on the Cuckoo, by Mr.
Dalgliesh, in last month's Aviadtural Magazine, I venture to give you some
notes regarding the habits of the Cuckoo which I have observed personally.
Some years ago I collected eggs and consequently was always look-
ing for nests. There was a long hedge which was a favourite nesting place
for many small birds, especially Hedge Sparrows and Greenfinches. With
regard to Cuckoos sucking eggs, I feel quite certain that it does so. I have
seen a Cuckoo flying along this hedge and stopping now and then, and
on looking at all the nests in it, in the hope of finding a Cuckoo's egg, I
found almost all the eggs, in the various nests, sucked, and as there were
no other birds, such as Jays and Magpies, in the neighbourhood which suck

eggs, and no other creature about the place likely to do such a thing I
came to the conclusion that it was the Cuckoo which had sucked them.
Another thing one would like to know, and that is how many eggs
does a Cuckoo lay ? I remember finding four in nests comparatively near
one another, exactly alike and, as far as I could judge, laid respectively on
the loth, 16th, 19th and 21st of June. The one found on the 16th was
considerably incubated, so it was probably laid a few days earlier. I feel
certain that all these were laid by the same bird. These were all in Hedge-
Sparrows' nests and were brownish-grey in colour. Of course the bird may
have laid several more, both before and after.
As to the colour of the Cuckoo's egg resembling that of the foster
parent, as far as my experience goes, they very rarely do so. I have found
a good many, and none of them resembled the foster parent's egg with the
exception of one I found in a Pied Wagtail's nest, most of the others were
found in Hedge Sparrow nests and were grey like a Pied Wagtail's or
brownish grey. I found one once in a Thrush's nest, another in Chaffinch's
nest after the young Chaffinchs' had flown, one or two in Robin's nests but
not in the least resembling Robin's eggs, and one in a Tree Pipit's nest
whose eggs were of the red variety, the Cuckoo's being grey.
I think, as Mr. Dalgleish remarks, the probability is that the Cuckoo
could not find any suitable nest and was forced to make use of any one she
could find, and in this neighbourhood there never was much choice.

To write an essay on the Bluebird is like attempting to
describe the face of a dear friend ; it is so familiar, so much of
its charm has always been taken for granted, that it is difficult to
translate into definite words and phrases. In the north-eastern
part of the United States the Bluebird is the true harbinger of
spring and its beauty of colour and note, together with its
friendly habits and love of human habitations endear it to all
lovers of birds wherever it is found. The appearance of the
Bluebird, or Blue Robin as it is called by foreign dealers, is too
well known to require description. Some one has truly said that
from its back it reflects the colour of the sky; from its breast,
the earth.
In the latitude of New York City, Bluebirds may be
observed every month in the year, but those seen in winter are
in silent restless flocks, constantly on the move, ever in search of
the half frozen berries which mean life itself at this bleak season.
The fruit of the poison ivy, catbrier and bittersweet, and the
bluish clusters of the cedar are all eagerly eaten. In the southern
states the berries of the mistletoe are a favourite item of the
Bluebirds diet.
When the first warm days of early March loosen the
icicles and soften the snow, the throat of the Bluebird feels the
thawing and the first notes of the season are heard. This
familiar call-note has well been named the " violet of sound."

Mr. C. William Beebe,
It is a soft sweet warble of two or three syllables, almost im-
possible to put into words but easy to imitate by whistling.
Soon the winter flocks pass northward but we never miss
them for their place is taken by others from the south, and this
all but imperceptible shifting migration goes on until one morn-
ing we see a pair of Bluebirds flying about the hollow in the old
apple tree, and we know that the summer residents have arrived.
The courtship is ardent but quickly over and both sexes
begin to carry grasses and feathers to the hollow limb or bird-
box selected as a nesting site. The song is far from elaborate,
being only variations on the call-note, its charm due to the
softness and richness of the mellow tones. With the coming of
insect life the Bluebird changes its diet and becomes wholly
insectivorous. Its favourite haunt is a more or less open, field-
like country with scattered bushes and trees. From the summit
of a fence-post or low bush it watches the grass and at intervals
flies down, snatches a grasshopper or beetle, and is back again.
If a bird box with a hole in the side is set up on a fence or
tree it is almost sure to be occupied by a pair of these birds,
except where English Sparrows are numerous. Then the Blue-
birds have but small chance, and are usually driven away.
About mid-April the warblings of the male cease--a sign
that the bird has a nest near at hand. In June, after the young
have flown, a brief second season of song may accompany the
rather perfunctory renewal of courtship at this time. Even a
third brood is not rare, and with the great mortality due to cats,
small boys, the elements and other factors of the environment,
three broods are none too many to perpetuate the species. Four
to six pale bluish white eggs are laid. The same nesting site is
reoccupied year after year by the same birds, when by a stroke of
good fortune these survive the perils of the southward migration.
The young birds, as is well-known, clearly reveal their
turdine relationship by the spots and mottlings on breast and
back. They linger for some time in the vicinity of their home
and occasionally a youngster of the first brood, still in his juvenile
dress, will help feed the nestlings of the second. This unusual
altruism is tolerated but unfortunately neither encouraged nor
apparently appreciated by the hard-working parents ! When the

second laying of eggs follows immediately after the flight of the
first nestlings, the male Blue-bird will often take full charge of
the latter, besides now and then carrying food to the female or
even taking her place on the eggs.
When the last nestlings of the season are on the wing, the
family unites in a loose flock with others, and through the
autumn, the restlessness of the coming migration keeps them on
the move. Sometimes in the late fall, in October or early
November, just before leaving for the south, a pseudo-vernal
feeling will inspire the parents, and, fora few days, the male will
warble sweetly and both will assiduously carry material into the
nesting box. This unseasonal effort is soon cut short by a cold
wintry blast from the north.
Although so gentle in notes and disposition, Bluebirds do
not tolerate too close companionship at the nesting season, and
each breeding pair often have a kind of preserve, perhaps of an
acre or more extent, over which they exercise proprietorship.
They seldom wander or feed outside their imaginary boundary
lines. The same seems to be true in a measure of Bluebirds in
captivity. At one time last spring I had seventeen pairs, mostly
cage-reared birds, hard at work building nests, but only where
the number in each flying cage was confined to one or two pairs,
did the attempts succeed. Bluebirds nest very readily in con-
finement and rear their young without trouble. They are so
familiar about the door-yards and orchards that they are never
caged, and were not even before the present laws prohibited the
keeping of them in captivity.
I will give one example of many unusual nesting sites
chosen by these birds. A number of years ago, in Reading,
Massachusetts, a pair of Bluebirds built their nest in one of the
signal balls near the railroad station. Here they successfully
raised two broods of young, in spite of the fact that the ball was
lowered fifty times a day for passing trains. Every time it des-
cended, the parents flew out and waited, perching near by or
flying about impatiently, until the ball was raised again, when
they immediately returned to sit on the eggs or cover the young
-as the case might be.

Manitoba on the north to Florida and Texas in the south, and
west to the Rocky Mountains. As in the case of so many other
groups of birds, the varied environment of climate and altitude
in the far west and in Mexico have produced physical changes
in the Bluebirds of those regions. The last haul of the fine-
meshed taxonomic net of our systematist reveals two sub-species
of our Eastern Bluebird, five forms of the western Mexican
Bluebird (differing chiefly in the transposition of blue and chest-
nut on throat and back), and, most beautiful of all, the specifically
distinct Mountain Bluebird, almost wholly blue in colour--

THE BLUEBIRD IN CAPTIVITY.
(Sialia sialisJ.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
It would be difficult to say much about the life of this bird
in captivity which has not already been said ; but, for the sake of
those who have not had the pleasure of keeping and breeding it
and who may, perchance, not have read the various published
accounts of its aviary life, a brief description of my experience
of the species may not come amiss.
I purchased my pair of birds, I think, about 1889, from the
late Mr. Abrahams, and turned them into the lighter of my two
bird-room aviaries, where they behaved quite amiably towards the
other inhabitants until June 1890 when courting commenced.
This was carried 011 in the usual manner, the male bird flying up
to the female with a piece of egg or a living insect in his bill and
feeding her with it, uttering at the same time a soft barely
audible whistle.
Pairing was a very noisy affair on the part of the male
bird, and the manner in which he distorted his whole body was
extraordinary. I would refer those of our members who have
not seen it to Mr. W. R. O. Grant's faithful representation of the
courting attitude of EriLhacus rubecula* I11 this drawing the
neck is stretched, the bill pointed upwards, but tail thrown

forward, an attitude exactly reproduced by our Blackbird before
pairing. In the case of the Bluebird the bird stands in a per-
fectly perpendicular position, the neck stretched, bill pointed
upwards, but tail downwards close to the legs which are stretched
quite straight, an exaggeration of the posture of a Heron when
hiding in the reeds. This posture, accompanied by shrill shriek-
ing, commenced about half-an-hour before pairing took place and
was continued for quite ten minutes afterwards.
All my nests were formed in the cigar-uest-box (see
" Hints on Cage-birds" p. 41) of coarse hay with a neatly formed
but shallow cup for the reception of the eggs; having plenty of
materials the nests were usually completed in one day. The
number of eggs deposited varied from three to five of a dull blue
colour somewhat similar to that of the eggs of our Wheatear, but
shaped like our Robin's eggs, only smaller. The small size of the
eggs is indeed somewhat surprising when compared with the
bulk of the bird that lays them.
Incubation lasted thirteen days and the hen came off the
nest repeatedly, that is to say whenever the male bird brought
her a delicacy ; she never fed in the nest but always left the eggs
to eat ; nevertheless in almost every instance all the eggs were
hatched, so that, if I had been living in a good country for grass-
hoppers I should have probably reared quite a colony of Blue-
birds ; but that is the trouble with this and many other
insectivorous birds, they will insist upon living insects or
spiders as food for their young. The Bluebirds did indeed give
a little yolk of egg and a few small earthworms when nothing
else was available; but, unless plenty of insects or spiders were
added all the young died. Thus it came to pass that from my first
nest of three, only one young one was reared ; and afterwards
although, up to the end of 1903, I had as many as three nests in
a year, not one young one lived to leave the nest, some died in
two or three days, some when half grown and one or two almost
full-feathered. I was taking holidays at home when my first
birds were hatched, and therefore was able to spend the whole
day in ransacking my own and neighbours' greenhouses for
spiders, but afterwards I was compelled to supply living food
morning and evening, leaving a saucer of earth well stocked

with small earthworms for the birds to feed with, and these were
insufficient for their needs.
I noticed that, when giving insects of a dry nature like
house-flies, moths, or butterflies, the Bluebirds invariably
swallowed and regurgitated them several times before offering
to the young ; spiders or cockroaches were broken up, the
bodies swallowed once or twice and the legs subsequently eaten
by the parents; apparently caterpillars and chrysalides were
smashed, swallowed once and then regurgitated into the mouth of
the young. I never saw insects given alive, as captured.
According to A. Hermann (Vide Russ, "Fremdl. Stubenv."
Vol. II., p. 309) the young leave the nest when 16 to 18 days old
and feed themselves 14 days later, but my bird did not leave the
nest until 23 days old and could then flutter about fairly strongly;
he was perfectly able to feed himself from eight to ten days later
and his parents insisted upon his doing so. Later in the year,
the Bluebirds having become somewhat aggressive towards other
birds in the bird-room, I transferred them to a covered aviary
which was then open on one side to the open air ; here the young
bird acquired his adult plumage, but of course not the full adult
size of his parents ; later in the year he caught a severe cold and
died ; when opened the liver and spleen were seen to be freely
studded with miliary nodules. The following 3^ear I gave my
Bluebirds a small aviary, almost to themselves, their only com-
panion being a Red-vented Bulbul ; later I had to remove this
bird as he insisted upon feeding the young Bluebirds and
viciously attacked their father.
The nestling plumage of the young is much more ashy
than the mother bird and the breast is distinctly spotted, so that
Dr. Russ' statement that " the 3&amp;apos;oung plumage is altogether
different from that of the old birds " is justified. On acquiring
its adult colouring the 3^oung male bird resembles its father, but
its bill still remains broader than that of its mother.
In an outdoor aviary I should expect to be able to breed
Blue-birds without much difficulty ; they would then be able to
supplement the food which I could supply by the insects which
they would themselves capture and the earthworms and other
crawling things which they would dig out of the earth, but to
provide for them in an indoor aviary is heartbreaking work.

My old birds both died in 1899, having been in my
possession about ten years ; they were about as pleasing as any
birds I ever possessed, utterly fearless, ready at. all times to fly
down and take dainties from one's fingers and showing very little
anxiety even when one looked into their nest and examined their
young ; indeed with one of my nests I tried to help the parents by
dropping egg-food into the months of the youngsters ; the cock
bird flew down to see what I was about, uttered his soft call note,
and then flew away apparently quite satisfied that I was doing no
harm to his family. I believe that, when bird-owners warn one
never to approach a nest with young lest the parents desert them,
it is often true as regards those particular bird-owners ; but it is
a known fact that with some of us our feathered friends are far
more trustful, they instinctively feel that we shall not hurt them
and they soon cease to be at all alarmed. I have had so many tame
birds in my time that I feel sure that I can safely run risks which
many breeders would not venture upon. I have more than once
had birds tame enough to eat from my fingers three days after
their capture, and I do not think there are many aviculturists who
could say that excepting perhaps in the case of the English
Robin, which, in its wild state, has been known to take meal-
worms from the fingers. I have not tried this in the open
garden, but I have with a newly caught Robin in an aviary,
which hopped up with the greatest assurance and snatched the
grub out of my fingers.

The Duchess of Bedford writes:--
" A year ago we turned a lot of Red-crested Cardinals out
and a few came to feed on my bird trays throughout the winter.
"They nested in the tops of the Cedar trees in the garden
and brought up one family, a second being destroyed by
Jackdaws.
" We turned out more this summer, but a second lot arrived
so late in the autumn that we decided to keep them through the
winter in an outdoor aviary.
" Both the Red-crested Cardinals and Saffron Finches
survived the winter at large in the garden."

As may be seen on reference to onr December number for
I 9 * 5 &amp;gt; PP- 58-9 of vol. IV of our New Series, in January, 1903,
certain Regent Birds, Sericulus meliuus, came into my hands.
The particular Regent about which --alas, I can no longer
venture to say whom --I now propose to write was referred to by
me in Nos. 2, 3, and 4 of vol. IV as " a smaller and very flighty
creature" (p. 63), "eccentric second female" (p. 64, note), and
generally as the second or odd female. At pp. 63-4 I mentioned
how, during the spring of 1905, the male had paid court to her,
how they had been shut up together for nesting purposes, and
how, on May 18, she had been frightened into a fit by a L,ong-
tailed Whydah and had had to be removed ; how (pp. 66-7), later
in the season, the male had again made up to her but breeding
had been stopped by the increasing cold of the advancing winter.
And, once more, last March, at p. 142, I mentioned how the
young male had courted her, and had died prematurely after a fit
011 February 15-16.
This bird, it may be perceived, had suffered various dis-
appointments ; and the sudden death of the young male must
have given her a grievous shock ; and it is hardly to be wondered
at that her health suffered materially.
For some time she was dull and listless. During May she
became exceedingly restless, both by night and day, and seemed
to be filled with a desire to be off and away after a mate. During
June I became aware that the bill had changed its colour to a
decided yellow. During June--July, four flights were cast, the
herald of approaching moult. On July 26, I had occasion to
handle her, and found that the two new primaries on each wing
which were replacing the cast feathers were black-and-yellow--
and then the bitter truth flashed upon me, the bird was assuming
the plumage of the adult male !
This female Regent is now (mid-October) in the plumage
of the fully adult male, not a feather of the female dress remain-
ing ; the yellow shield on either wing shews a few black streaks,
which mark the course of the black heads of some flights as they
push their way forward but have not yet come fully into line

with their fellows, but practically the plumage is complete. The
only external differences between it and a true male are that the
bill, although yellow, and at one time bright yellow, is now not
nearly so clear and bright as a male's should be, and that the
yellow of the head does not show so much of the rich red-orange
that makes the colouring of a good male so attractive; the eyes,
too, are comparatively but of a feeble yellow.
It is rarely that one has opportunity of noticing the precise
course followed by moult over the body of a bird ; and a few brief
notes on this point may not be out of place. It must be remem-
bered that in this case every feather, the large and the small, has
been replaced by a feather of a totally different colour, so that the
appearance and growth of every new feather could be detected
and watched. In the spring, it was a "gaudy buff and brown"
bird, now its colour is " sober black and yellow." For the
sake of brevity, I shall refer to the old plumage just as buff or
brown.
The first change of colour appeared among the flights ; and
a few of these, as already stated, are still not quite fully grown,
the last of the old plumage, a secondary, not having been shed
until October 12. Year after year, I have observed how a primary
or two would be dropped by the Regents quite early in the sum-
mer, long before there was any appearance of moult, and how the
flights would continue to be shed, practically in pairs, right up to
the verge of winter. Possibly our cold climate may be in part
responsible for this; but, personally, I regard it rather as one of
those beautiful provisions of what we materialistic heathen of the
present day call " nature" (with a small "11") which enables a
shy and timid creature with many enemies to retain its powers of
flight unimpaired all through the moult.
As regards the body feathers generally, including the wing-
coverts, the black first appeared on either side of the chest, and
was immediately followed--possibly accompanied--by some on
the lower back, or around the root of the tail. From these three
centres the black gradually extended ; not in any instance did a
black feather crop up at random--each spot spread as a sore.
By August 17, there was quite a large patch of black on each side
of the breast, and another on the back ; one black feather was

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
appearing in the centre of the tail ; and the eyes were yellowish.
By September 2, the two breast patches had joined just below the
chin (which was black), but all down the centre of the under side
there remained a dividing line of buff; and more black feathers
were to be seen in the tail. O11 September 9, only a tiny touch
of the buff, in the centre of the chest, remained 011 the actual
body, and every brown feather had disappeared from the tail,
which now, however, although wholly black, was far from being
fully grown ; the cheeks, &amp;c., were still buff. On September 14,
the bod} 7 was entirely black ; a little buff remained on the sides
of the face and neck; the former had disappeared by the 17th.
The last of the old feathers (excluding flights) clung in a little
patch on to each side of the neck ; and it was not until September
25 that the plumage of body, head, and neck could be pronounced
to be complete. The tail was full-grown by October 7, but the
flights were not so until some considerable time later.
There was one curious phase in the course of this change
of feather, one of more than passing interest to those who think.
By the way, but in this connection, why should the feathers
of a bird be often of one colour on one part and of a totally
different colour on another bordering upon it, no actual dividing
line existing between the two colours, although the nominal line
of demarcation between them is clearly and sharply drawn ? and
why should this distinction be continued and maintained through
countless generations without deviating by a hair's breadth, and
such a patch in the male (of species that have the sexes nominally
alike), sometimes, be a trifle longer or larger or something than
the corresponding patch in the female? We need not go farther
afield for an illustration than a good living example of the com-
mon Java Sparrow. What can be more definitely and precisely
defined than that white patch on each side of the head ! Why
should this patch remain the same, without encroaching or being
encroached upon, moult after moult, generation after generation,
in countless thousands of specimens ! Of course I am referring
to healthy natural birds, not those that have been tampered with
by man. And so the Regent. The adult male has a broad irregular
band of orange-yellow running from the base of the upper man-
dible over forehead, crown, nape, and hind-neck to the mantle.

which proves an insurmountable obstacle (but why?) to the flow
of the golden stream. At this point, the latter surges up, pre-
vails over and overflows the upper part of the sable barrier, then,
beaten back, runs off to right and left, forming a half-collar.
From time immemorial, the glorious light has been waging fierce
war here against the pitchy blackness of the mantle, but has not
advanced bv the breadth of a line. The gold impinges upon the
black which everywhere hedges it in, and comes just down to
such and such a point, but not one jot or one tittle beyond. A
spike or prong of yellow projects into the black behind the eye,
and seems to be just on the point of making an inroad,--but when
has it been otherwise, and when is it going to make any progress ?
Just so far shalt thou go and no farther is the decree, and we can
only accept it and wonder. This irregular "shape" of yellow
grows absolutely true to type about the head and neck of every
adult male Regent, year after year and generation after generation.
One res 7 ilt of this beneficial decree I referred to in December,
1905 (PP- 55'6), and it makes us marvel the more. The golden
glory appears onjv on the upper parts ; and the courting male
knows full well how to shew it off to the best advantage. But
the same bird, when hiding from an enemy, has only to squat on
a high perch and expose the sombre underparts to the foe, and
he remains invisible, for not the tinest streak of tell-tale yellow
has been permitted to grow where its brightness might endanger
the safety of the wearer.
And now comes in the curious little episode in connection
with my suffragette.
Up to and including August 18, the entire head and neck
all round was that of the female Regent--not an old feather had
been lost, not a new one had been gained. But, on the following
morning, a startling change was apparent, and most conspicuously
so. My first impression was that the bird had met with an acci-
dent during the night and had scalped itself, but closer inspection
shewed that nothing of that kind had occurred. The broad track
of feathers referred to above, from bill to mantle, was bare of
feathers, not so much as the ghost of a feather remained. The
entire patch, but that only, which in the adult male is yellow, had
lost every feather, and was there all ready for the yellow feathers-

to grow ; and 011 the very next day the crown region was tinged
with the glorious yellow-orange, which in due time filled up and
occupied its allotted space. But of the feathers which bordered
the track, not so much as one had been shed ; these buff feathers
reared their heads conspicuously aloft, like the high grass on
each side of many an African path, and were only slowly and
gradually replaced by the black feathers, some of the buff remain-
ing on the cheeks as late as September 14, and not being reported
clear until the 17th. Why should this block of tiny buff feathers
from one particular part be cast all together, to make way for a
crop of yellow ones, while all along, on each side of the track,
feathers of a like size and colour, separated from them by no
visible dividing line, held their ground well, and only slowly,
and as it were reluctantly, gave way to the on-coming growth of
black? It is something more than passing strange.
Another point must be noticed. Whereas the normal male
Regent takes not less than two annual moults to change from the
immature to the adult plumage, this nondescript creature has
jumped from the old feather to the new by one single moult.
Small blame to them, then, that the members of my house-
hold, accustomed for years to seeing this female going about in
sober and modest apparel, 011 now beholding a gaudy damsel
flouncing and bouncing about, should mutter such words as " un-
natural," "weird," "uncanny," "false," "brazen faced hussy,"
and the like. It is a Jackdaw in Peacock's feathers, a wolf in
sheep's clothing. It is not a male, nor a female, but a " thing" ;
it is not a he, nor a she, but an "it" ; it is neither fish, flesh,
fowl, nor good red herring. Alas, my masters, what is to be
done with this abnormal monstrosity !
Reginald Philupps.
N.B.--As I see this bird, day after day, flying about to all
appearances a true male, it is natural to ask--Can any mistake
have been made? The only possible one that I can suggest is
that the bird who died last February was the second female, and
that it is the young aviary-bred male who survives. When the
shadow of death falls on a bird, it is a very different creature
from what the same bird was when full of life and vigour-- hit
the survivor seemed to be certainly the well-k?ioivn female. More-

over, tlie gentleman who kindly made th zpost mortem examination
of the deceased wrote me that it was a male. And, regard the
case as we will, we cannot escape from the fact that the bird
passed from the one plumage to the other by a single moult.
The more I consider the pros and cons, it seems to me that my
view meets the difficulties of the case better than any other, even
regardless of my long acquaintance with the second female.--

THE BLACK COCKATOO.
In the June number of the Avicultural Magazine, I noticed
a quotation from The Evul to the effect that the Black Cockatoo
" had shredded the bark off the dead eucalyptus and that it was
noted that only dead trees were worked upon." I think that the
above might convey a wrong impression as to the habits of these
birds. They certainly do attack the " stringy bark " in the way
shown in the photo in The Emu, but they also treat living trees
in the same manner. I may say that I have seen hundreds of
living trees, which presented the same appearance except that
the bole only of the tree was attacked. These birds are very
fond of the larvae of a large moth, the grubs, which are three or
four inches long and about one inch in diameter, eat their way
into the Wattle Trees, and the Cockatoos tear large pieces of the
bark and wood off the trees in their endeavour to obtain these
titbits ; these trees are invariably alive, I doubt whether the
Black Cockatoo even with the great power of their bills could
get one of these grubs out of a dead wattle tree.
It might interest members to know something of the
nesting habits of these birds. They build in the hole of a lofty
eucalyptus tree, generally between 80 and 150 feet from the
ground, making no nest to speak of, pulversing the rotten wood
to the depth of half an inch or so at the bottom of the hole, the
eggs being generally placed about two feet from the outlet. I
have a pair of eggs before me as I write, they were taken six
years ago in the Midlands by a shepherd, they are dull white, in
shape oval, and measure (1) rgo by 1-40 (2) 1-91 by 1-26. The

Dr. A. G. Butler,
\0x25A0eggs are considered rare and I only know of three or four sets
being taken in Tasmania. I have never seen a Black Cockatoo
in captivity, and do not know how they would manage, without
their usual diet.
I have found only two nests during a period of thirty years
and, strange to say, both were on the slopes of Mt. Wellington,
within 8 or 9 miles of Hobart; though of course in secluded
gullies and out of the tract of the ordinary run of mankind or
even school boys. One of these nests contained two young ones
when found in February, and in the other the birds were sitting
late in December ; on visiting the former nest about a week later
the two young birds were observed, the parents still feeding them
and they still retained a fair amount of black down on the back
and breast, the following week they had disappeared, most
probably having retired to the highlands round the Southern
end of Mt. Wellington. .
I hope that these few notes will be of some interest to
members as I am afraid that it will be many years before any one
succeeds in keeping these birds in captivity, much less in rearing
the young. A. L. Butler.

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph. D.
My article published in the August issue of our Magazine
brought my notes on the present year's experiences up to July
4th, at which date I had not reared a single bird in any of my
aviaries, although I had heard one young Cockatiel being fed and
a pair of Tambourine Doves had left the nest and been starved to
death by their parents.
On the 12th I saw my Diamond Doves feeding young, one
of which left the nest on the 15th and was reared. My Satin
Bower-bird was taken ill on the 12th and died in the middle of
the day following. I sent it to be skinned and a post mortem
\0x25A0examination proved it to be a cock bird, thus partly confirming
Mr. Be Sonef's statement as to the cocks dying within a year or

two after assuming the adult plumage, but at the same time
revealing a very curious fact in relation to this species :--
Briefly to review the history of my two Bower-birds, I
may note that the supposed pair (palpably^ in nestling plumage,
both small and with indications of pale spots on the green
plumage), came into my possession in September, 1899, an d at the
end of a year one had assumed the adult plumage of the male,
the other the adult plumage of the female. Naturally I concluded
that I had secured an undoubted pair, although both sang and
danced ; and though they certainly quarrelled, that fact in 110
way disturbed my faith, because from my boyhood I had been
taught that " the quarrels of lovers are the beginning of love."
When in July, 1904, the supposed hen began to assume
male plumage and became so spiteful that I had to remove the
undoubted cock, I concluded, as a matter of course, that disease
of the ovary was affecting her plumage (see my short paper in
the "Annals and Magazine of Natural History," ser. 7,Vol. XVI.,
pp. 350-351). Later the perfect male plumage was acquired and
retained permanently, and exactly three years later the bird died
and proved to be a cock.
Why some cock birds should assume male plumage at the
\0x25A0end of the second year, and others should disport themselves in
female attire for six years or longer, is a problem which requires
a good deal of explanation. My birds were only two out of
half-a-dozen or more, all palpably young birds, imported in one
batch.
On the 15th, I lost a Yellowish-finch, which, from its
bright plumage, not I only but other aviculturists had decided
to be acock bird ; it had built a nest in conjunction with a duller
bird in the same aviary, but no eggs had been laid ; examination
after death proved it to be a hen with well-developed ovary; so
that bright colouring in this case probably indicated advanced
age and not sex ; it is a rather large bird.
O11 the same day, the first young Diamond Dove having
left the nest, the mother laid an egg on the ground ; and the
second egg laid on the 16th fell out of the nest and was smashed.
The cock fed the young bird until he could look after himself.
On the 25th one young Cockatiel flew; it insisted upon its

62 Dr. A. G. Butler,
parents feeding it for a mouth afterwards, and proved to be
a cock.
August 8th I again saw a young Tambourine Dove on the
floor of the aviary, which fluttered away just above the ground
as I approached it. This bird was reared and became so
extremely wild that it was a marvel to me that it did not break
its neck. Directly I opened the aviary door it would fly at full
speed straight for the wire netting and get hurled back head over
heels with the force of the impact. I keep it in a cage now to
calm its fears. The other bird from the same nest died soon
after leaving the nest, and when I found it the flies had been at it.
On the 12th I saw a hen Gouldian Finch peering into a nesting-
receptacle and hoped that my Pintail Nonpareils had gone to
nest. It was a vain hope, for though they often examined several
receptacles and I left them outside until nearly the end of
October, they did nothing.
In this month the Diamond Doves went to nest for the
fourth time, two young leaving it on the 30th ; both were reared.
The parents laid again on September 21st and 22nd, but broke
both eggs and gave up breeding on October 9th.
On September 2Sth I again saw a young Tambourine
Dove on the floor, and on the 30th I saw the pair together, but
on October 2nd the smaller bird (probably the hen) had dis-
appeared, and I saw it no more ; the other seemed to get on
well for a time in spite of heavy rains, but 011 the 9th I found it
cramped and unable to walk. As it could feed itself I took it
indoors and caged it, putting it into a box of hay every evening ;
it partly recovered and lived until the 23rd. The quills and tail-
feathers attained almost to their full length, but the sheaths were
not shed. Then I found it dead. Thus of six young Tambourine
Doves which left the nest this year only one was reared.
During September my pale form of Hauguest Icterus
vulgaris (Jimoneus&amp;apos;) moulted and bore out my statement that the
colouring of these birds when properly treated tends to deepen
in captivity. In fact it is now more deeply coloured than my old
bird, which moulted in October, but is still distinguished by its
more slender build, the small triangular naked patch behind the
eye in place of an orbital ellipse round the eye and the white

edges to the outer webs of the external tail feathers. Of course
the difference in song continues. As I rejected some of these
characters on the ground that some of the deeper-coloured birds
possessed them, the question now arises as to whether, after all,
they may not be of importance. The change of colour from pale
to dark, certainly seems to render the validity of I. curasoensis as
a sub-species somewhat doubtful.
On the 27th I brought indoors the birds in my small out-
door aviary, but left those in the larger aviary outside. Two hen
Weavers died during the year in consequence of damp and cold
fogs, but they were old birds which had been kept indoors for
many 3^ears.
On October 30th I received a pair of young Chingolo
Song-Sparrows, very kindly presented to me by their breeder,
Mr. W. E. Teschemaker.
The fact that reliance upon colour characters alone caused
me to sex incorrectly both a Bower Bird and Yellowish-finch,
clearl) 7 - evidences the importance of studying the external
structural differences in the sexes of birds. No doubt a com-
parison of the beaks of undoubted sexes of Ptilonorhyuchits would
reveal differences of outline. In Sycalis arve?isis on the other
hand the beaks differ very slight^, not sufficiently to be of any
value in deciding the sex. A cock bird which I lost in 1905 is a
large and dull-coloured bird, but one which died in 1901 was
a trifle brighter, much smaller, and has the front margin of the
wing towards the shoulder bright yellow; the female which died
in July shows an indication of this yellow edging but is a
slightly larger bird than the cock and with more yellow on
abdomen and thighs; whereas the chin of the cock bird is
yellow, in the hen it shows an orange tinge. The large male
would be typical N. arvensis and the small brighter pair N. minor
only the male of the latter came home in an Argentine collection,
probably obtained at Buenos Ayres. Both of the smaller birds
have paler lower mandibles than the larger bird. I must confess
that, with the exception of luteiventris, in which the outer tail-
feather is obliquely marked with white, I have little faith in the
validity of the sub-species of S. arvensis , knowing as I do how
enormously S. flaveola varies in colouring at different ages.

Mr. E. W. Harper,
So long as it can be proved that a certain type is constant
to locality, and not connected by intergrades with any other, I
have no objection to it being regarded as sub-specifically distinct,
though I should prefer to call it a distinct species ; but when, as
is admitted to be the case in many of the so-called sub-species
recognised in the United States, the greater number of the
named forms grade into each other and require to be arbitrarily
fixed by geographical boundaries, no difference being dis-
cernible, the whole thing ceases to be scientific and resolves
itself into a sport no more elevating than that indulged in by
children, when they sort marbles by size and colour, in both
cases no doubt it educates the eye, and that is all that can be said
in its favour. The old system in which a species was described
as "widely distributed, becoming larger and brighter towards
the westward extremity of its range," answered every scientific
purpose without cumbering the ground with useless multi-
tudinous names, and adding greatly to the labours of the
museum student and cataloguer.

(&amp;lt;Continued from page 38).
The Tanagers or " sackies " naturally on account of their
beauty alone claim many admirers. Those most commonly
caged are the Blue ( 71 episcopus) ; the Palm or " brown sackie " (71
palmarum ) ; and the Violet or " yellow-bellied canar}&amp;apos; " ( Euphonia
vio laced). Others less common are the tiny Pigmy (#. mimita ),
first introduced into England by Captain Pam, and differing
from violacea in its smaller size and by having a purplish-black
throat instead of a yellow one ; the Maroon or " cashew sackie"
( Ramphoccelus jacapa ), with its Chaffinch-like cry of " fink, fink " ;
the Magpie or " French sackie" (Cissopis leveriana ) ; the Black;
the Great Saltator or " tom-pitcher" ( Saltato? magnus), in which
birds of the 3&amp;apos;ear have the eye-brow streak yellowish green,
changing later to white ; the Blue-and-Black {Calliste brazilensis) ;

the Yellow-bellied or "goldfinch" (C. flaviveiitris&amp;apos;) ; and the
Black-cheeked or " buck-tongue sackie " (C. cyanea) The last-
named is a very quarrelsome species: the hens are continually
"swearing" at each other; while the cocks lock themselves
together with beak and claw, rolling on the floor of a cage in a
murderous embrace.
Generally speaking, no food but fruit is given to Tanagers ;
consequently those species which are largely insectivorous do
not thrive. This fruit diet is, however, an improvement upon
the universal pea-meal paste or " satoo," which is used in the
Cast. I regret to state that water is not in many cases given to
frugivorous birds ; but on account of the succulent nature of the
fruit, they do not seem to mind the abstinence.
Of Sugar-birds, the following species are occasionally kept:
The beautiful Yellow-winged ( Ccei&amp;apos;eba cayanci), and the Black-
headed (Chlorophaues spiza ) ; and I secured the only pair I ever
saw of the tiny Yellow-breasted, or " kiskadee sackie" (Certhiola
ehloropygia). Two of my Yellow - winged Sugar-birds were
\0x25A0captured at the top of the Demerara light-house shortly after
midnight, on two different occasions. What the birds were
doing out at such a demoralizing hour I can't imagine--unless
they were merely migrating. Young males of this species are
green like the adult females; and old males lose their gay
*colour at certain seasons. Some descriptions of this bird give
the colour of the legs and feet as " ruddy flesh-colour." This
has evidently been taken from a faded skin ; the legs and feet in
life being bright coral-red.
I was extremely astonished on one occasion to be told that
a man had a pair of " Nightingales" for sale ; and, upon express-
ing a wish to see them, welcomed instead a pair of Red-
whiskered Bulbuls ! They had just arrived on a coolie-sliip from
Calcutta, and, in spite of their long voyage of about three
months, were in perfect condition. I only saw one pair of Red-
crested Cardinals (Paroaria cucullata).
Humming-birds were never successfully kept; but, as they
were sometimes caged, perhaps they ought to be mentioned.
Upon a diet of sugar and water, they can exist for varying periods
dip to about seven weeks. At times they were offered for sale

freshly-caught, tied by one leg to a piece of cotton a yard or two
in length; the poor bird hovering and "humming" at the full
extent of its tether, reminding one of a boy's tiny kite. They
were captured by hand inside houses, into which they had darted,
and were also "limed."
The family Icteridce , with which the colony abounds--
taking the place of the Starlings of the Old World--contains a
few favourite cage-birds. The commonest is the Cow-bird
(. Molothrus aironitens ) called locally the "corn-bird," " rice-bird,"
and " lazy-bird " : the last mentioned name is derived from its
Cuckoo-like parasitic habit of laying its eggs in other birds'&amp;apos;
nests; its host being the tiny Wren or " god-bird " (Troglodytes
fulvus). The male Cow-birds sing fairly well, often to the ac-
companiment of much wing-flapping. They have the babbler-
like habit of holding down the head in front of another bird in
an inviting attitude, implying that they wish to be tickled ;.
at the same time raising the feathers of the head and neck.
The Black Hangnest ( Cassidix orizivora) sometimes seen,
is like a large edition of the Cow-bird, both in its glossy black
plumage and in its habits. It, too, is parasitic ; its hosts being
the Crested Hangnest or black " bunyah " ( Ostinops decumanus),
the Green "bunyah" [O. viridis), the Yellow-backed Hangnest
[Cassicuspersicus), and the Red-backed Hangnest ( Cassicus affinis )
--the two last-mentioned species are known locally as "Mocking-
birds." All four of the Black Hangnest's hosts make long purse-
shaped nests, and are occasionally met with in captivity ; but
their comparatively large size somewhat handicaps their popu-
larity.
At certain seasons, dozens of Yellow-headed Troupials, or
" Yellow-headed Corn-birds " as they are called ( Xanthocephalus
icterocephalus ) are offered for sale ; but, as they are fed on grain
only --paddy-rice and oats--they do not long survive. The Red-
breasted Marsh-bird {Leistes guianensis), the local " robin," has a
correspondingly short life in captivity for the same reason ; whilst
the Golden Hangnest or "yellow plantain-bird" {Icterus xanthor-
nis ) dies in even less time by being fed upon nothing but plantain,
a kind of banana. One of the most expensive of the colony's
cage-birds is a beautiful orange and black Hangnest (/. crocojiotus

which is brought down to the coast from the borders of the
Brazils and known as the "Troupial." The Yellow - crowned
Troupial or " Cadoorie " (/. chrysocephalus&amp;apos;) is a great favourite,
being prized for its song. When travelling in the interior, up the
river Demerara, I learnt from the aborigines that they rear the
" Cadoorie " and other insectivorous birds upon river-fish. It is
first roasted and then chewed before being given to the young
birds. Unfortunately, when the birds are taken down to the
coast and pass into other hands, they are soon killed through
being improperly fed. I have often seen slices of raw meat an
inch long in their cages, with which to supplement their ordinary
diet of sour bread-and-milk.
The last of the Icteridine family to be noticed is the Black
Troupial (Qniscalus lugjibiis&amp;apos;), or colonial "Blackbird." Itappears
to be an almost omnivorous feeder; in Barbados, where I spent
three days on the voyage home, I saw it turning over horse-dung
in the streets, searching for grain. It is protected by law in that
island, and is the commonest town bird there.
The only species of the beautiful family Cotingidce which I
saw in captivity during the three years I was in Demerera, was a
single specimen of the lovely Cock-of-the-Rock (. Rupicola crocea )
--a young hand-reared bird in black baby plumage. The chief
adornment of the adult, the cinnamon crest, was little more than
a slight ridge of dark feathers 011 the crown of the young bird.
Its mode of progression was by hopping, not walking, I was
informed that about twenty years ago two or three dozens of
these handsome birds were on the market at one time; but since
then only two or three specimeus had been seen in town.
I tried hard to induce the dealers and aborigines to procure
for me some of the other beautiful Con tin gas -- the Purple-
breasted, Purple-throated, Crimson, Crimson-breasted, Crimson-
throated, Pompadour, etc., which are all found in the interior--
but without success. I only hope that some or all of these beau-
tiful species may eventually find their way to English aviaries.
For the correct identification of the only Thrush ( Turdus
murinus) I saw caged, I am indebted to our esteemed member,
Mr. H. D. Astley.
Doves are not held in much esteem in Demerara. The

common Barbary Dove {Turtur risorius), the Talpacoti Ground-
Dove ( Chamcepelia talpacoti ), the Dwarf Ground-Dove (C. griseola)
and the Red Under-winged Dove (. Leptoptila griseola&amp;apos;) are all
occasionally to be seen.
The Tinamous or "maams " are more sought after for
culinary, than avicultural, purposes ; and the natives were much
interested to learn of their polyatidrous habits--discovered first,.
I believe, by our worthy Editor. Their eggs have been brought
to me for sale on two or three occasions. The Brown Tinamou
(&amp;apos; Crypturus cinereus ) is the only species I saw in confinement; it
used to utter its shrill cry about four o'clock in the morning.
Coming next to the Cracidae, the following must be men-
tioned : the Crested Curasow or " powis" ( Crax elector ) ; the
Marail Guan or " marudi " (. Penelope mar ail ); the Piping Guau
or " white-headed marudi " (Pipilo cumanensis&amp;apos;) ; and the Little
Guau ( Ortalis motniot) or " hanaqua"--so-called from its cry
which consists of the word "lian-a-qua," repeated several times
in a loud voice. All the birds of this family met with in confine-
ment are hand-reared by the aborigines, and are consequently
very tame. A Little Guan which was given to me was so tame
that it was allowed complete liberty ; it fed with the poultry, and
roosted at night overhead in the trees. It resented the intrusion
of strange fowls, and would fight fiercely with cocks much bigger
than itself; but they were seldom able to strike a blow, because
their smaller and more agile adversary would fly high in the air
above their heads. This bird had a bad habit of sneaking into
the house and eating condensed milk, butter, fruit, or anything
tasty; although it shared in the fowls' mhm. It had full use of
its wings, and would sometimes be absent for two or three days
at a time.
A tame Trumpeter Bird (Psophia crepitans ) can sometimes
be seen walking in its stately fashion along a quiet street. That
extraordinary bird, the Hoatzin, I was unable to obtain ; although
it is common in the adjoining county of Berbice. Its local name
is the "Cange Pheasant."
The Martinique Gallinule ( Porphyriola martinica) and the
Spur-wing ( Jacana jacana ) were both brought to me for sale :
they throve on a diet of soaked paddy rice and shrimps.

With a brief allusion to some of the Ducks of Georgetown,
these notes--which have already reached a greater length than
I had intended -- must close. The Muscovey Duck ( Cairina
moschala), indigenous to the colony, is domesticated ; and breeds
freely with the common duck. Two other species of ducks are
often seen in a state of semi-domestication--being reared from
the. eggs of wild birds--namely, the Guiana Tree-duck or
"vicissi" ( Dendrocygna discolor)-, and the Blue-winged Teal
(Querquedula cyanoptera).

The past season with its cold spring and dull damp
summer has not been very favourable to successful aviculture in
outdoor exposed aviaries, and the fact that several of our members
have been so successful in rearing rare birds speaks volumes for
their skill.
For my part I have not been very successful, the number
of young birds reared in 1113^ aviaries being considerably below
the average. The following notes may however be of some slight
interest.
The Smith&amp;apos;s Partridge Pigeons were the first to commence
nesting, but entirely unsuccessfully, as already recorded (Vol. V.
p. 292).
On April 20th the hen Many-coloured Parrakeet, which
has been with me for eight years, .com menced to sit, hatching, in
due course, two young birds, both of which however died in the
nest. The male is a new bird, imported in 1906, the original
male to the old hen having died early that year. He may not
have sufficiently settled down to feed the young properly, as the
old hen has never before failed to rear her brood. Or possibly
the failure was attributable to the cold weather.
I reared so many Quails last year that I was hopelessly
overrun with young birds at the end of the season, and I decided
not to breed any pure-bred Quails this year, but to try and
breed some hybrids. I therefore tried to cross the Harlequin
(C. delegorguei) with the Australian (C. pectoralis), and Harlequin

with Rain Quail (C. coromandelica&amp;apos;). The hen Pectoral laid two
clutches of eggs but entirely refused to sit, although the eggs,
or at any rate one egg, tested in an incubator, proved to be
fertile.
In August, seeing that my attempts at hybridization had
failed, I replaced a hen Harlequin in the aviary, and within a
fortnight she had commenced to lay in a beautifully concealed
spot in a clump of grass. On September ioth she brought off a
brood of seven, three eggs containing dead chicks being left in
the nest. All seven chicks have been successfully reared, and
have turned out to be all cocks except one !
The little Olive Finches ( Phonif ra lepida ), to my mind
some of the most charming birds one can keep in a large out-
door aviary during the summer months, have reared no less than
eight young birds. The first brood consisted of two 3^oung
birds which unfortunately were left in the same aviary when the
parents had gone to nest a second time.
The second brood resulted in three young birds, and
immediately these left the nest the parents turned upon the two
young birds of the first brood, and in a few da) ? s these were
found dead, apparently worried to death by their parents.
Profiting by experience, the young of the second brood were
transferred to another aviary when they could take care of them-
selves, and these and a third brood safely arrived at maturity.
Two young Turnix varia were successfully reared by hand
as already recorded (Vol. V. p. 303).
Two hen Bourke's Parrakeets, both paired to the same
cock, nested in separate logs in the same aviary. One nest
resulted in four young birds and the other in two, all of which
were reared, though three died long after they had reached the
age at which they could feed themselves. Damp weather does
not agree with young Bourkes in an open aviary.
O11 July 23rd, two young Parrot-finches left the nest and
were successfully reared ; the red markings on one of these being
almost as extensive as in an adult, though of course much duller.
September 5th. One young Yellow-rumped Finch ( Afu/iza
flaviprymma ) left the nest. This young bird was seen to feed
itself 011 September 18th, but the parents continued to feed it for

A highly interes&amp;apos;kig and instructive paper has reached us
from New Zealand, entitled "Our Feathered Immigrants," in
which the author, Mr. James Drummond, gives a digest of a mass
of evidence which he has collected for and against the various
species of birds that have been introduced into that country.
A circular, with twenty-nine questions relating to the
introduced birds was drawn up, and issued through the Depart-
ment of Agriculture to agriculturists throughout the colony. It
is unnecessary here to repeat all the questions that were asked,
suffice it to state that they requested information as to whether
any introduced birds were present in the district of each colonist
who received the circular; whether such species had done good
or harm; whether they had driven away the native birds or
otherwise ; if proved to be harmful, what steps had been taken
to check their spread, and whether the introduction of other
British birds could be undertaken advantageously. The pamphlet
above mentioned is the result of this inquiry and is very interest-
ing reading.
The native fauna of New Zealand is perhaps the most
interesting of that of any part of the world, but it could not exist
in the face of civilization. With the introduction of three pigs,
liberated by Captain Cook in Queen Charlotte Sound in 1773,
the war against the native birds may be said to have commenced.
These multiplied exceedingly, and when the settlers began to
arrive the pigs had become a nuisance. To make matters worse
the settlers brought with them many domestic animals, more
disastrous than Captain Cook's pigs, and a bitter struggle

between the new fauna and the old took place. The native fauna
had " no chance against the shrewd vulgar, hard-headed, cun-
ning, practical, greedy, and ferocious invaders, who were inured
to hardship and had walked hand in hand with adversity through
many generations. The incident was a specially dramatic one in
respect to the avifauna. The native birds were driven com-
pletely away--not altogether, or even chiefly, by the new comers,
but by influences that the latter had been taught by experience
to combat. Sentiment, necessity, and utility played parts in
connection with the acclimatization of birds, and it was necessity
and utility that carried most weight."
With the disappearance of the native birds, a terrible
plague of caterpillars visited the colony some forty years ago.
Farmers suddenly discovered their crops completely eaten up by
these pests.
" The numbers of-the insects increased with what they fed
upon, and they marched from field to field in grand procession,
leaving behind them the abomination of desolation."
Thus we see that out of pure necessity the settlers turned
their attention to the introduction of some birds that would be
likely to destroy the insect plague, and very naturally they thought
of those they had known in the Old Country, with the result that
many of our commonest birds were introduced.
The House Sparrow comes first on the list. Five of these
birds were introduced in 1S76 and others subsequently ; they
multiplied to a prodigousextent, and the inhabited districts soon
became stocked with them. Although they are acknowledged to
destroy a certain number of insects when feeding young, the good
thus done is far more than outbalanced by the harm these birds
do in destroying the crops. " Of the hundreds of correspondents
who have filled in the circular there are only six who raise their
voice in the Sparrow's favour." However, in concluding the
account of Passer domesiic7cs the author remarks "Whatever the
Sparrow may do in these times, however, there is no doubt that it
did good service to the agriculturist and horticulturist of New
Zealand in former days, when the insects were on the war-path
and when the people were liable to be eaten out of house and
home. A new generation has arisen, and only the Sparrow's
faults are remembered."

The Blackbird is universally condemned by fruit-growers
and " its name linked with that of the Sparrow."
The Skylark is found to pull up spriging wheat and other
seedlings, and is also condemned by the colonists.
The Song Thrush is considered to do more harm than good.
Though one observer is quoted who speaks very highly of its
usefulness in destroying worms, slugs and insects.
" The Greenfinch is described sweepingly as the farmer's-
greatest enemy when grain is ripening."
The Goldfinch has not aroused much enmity and some say
that it does more good than harm. The Redpoll is generally
considered harmless; but "the Yellowhammer is classed with
the Sparrow in descriptions of the damage done to seed in newly
sown bush-burns in the North Island."
" Praise of the little Hedge-Sparrow is almost unanimous,"
while " there is hardly any limit to the good words said of the
Starling," for which bird numbers of farmers erect nesting-boxes.
Some alarming stories are told, however, of Starlings having
taken to eating fruit; a habit that will not surprise those who-
know the bird in the Old Country.
One of the questions asked in the circular was, " Generally
speaking, have the introduced birds done more good than harm,
or more harm than good ? The following replies are typical of
the majority of those received : "As with most aliens, it would
be better if they had stayed at home"; "A terrible mistake " ;
"For Goodness' sake don't make it worse by importing more of
them," and so on. "The consensus of opinion," the author
remarks "is expressed in too clear, concise, and emphatic a
manner to leave any shadow of doubt as to the strong antagonism
felt towards English birds.
" Many farmers, however, modify iheir condemnation by
expressing an opinion that if the birds could be kept in check
they would be converted from enemies into friends. I cannot
help thinking that this is the proper attitude to adopt. The
birds are far from being altogether bad. A forgetful generation
may have a bad memory, but great services given in the past
must not be ignored when the birds are on their trial."
It has often been stated that the introduced birds have

driven away the indigenous species, but this does not seem to be
the case according to the result of the present inquiry, which has
" failed to bring out any evidence of a determined or concerted
plan on the part of the introduced birds to attack and drive away
the native birds. Sparrows and other introduced birds have been
seen attacking natives, but Tuis and several other species of
native birds have attacked introduced birds on occasions with
great ferocity."

Those who are interested in the fauna of Australia will find
an abundant supply of interesting matter in Mr. Le Souef's new
book. The author deals with his subject in a manner that shows
him to be a most observant and experienced naturalist of a type
that is all too rare now-a-days. " Wild Life in Australia" is no
compilation from the works of others, but a careful record of the
author's own observations over a long period, of the wild life of a
most interesting country.
Of the bird-life of Australia we learn much from Mr. Le
Souef's book, and many of the birds dealt with are known to
us here as aviary inmates, as they are also to Mr. Le Souef who,
as Director of the Melbourne Zoological Gardens, knows most of
the Australian creatures in captivity as well as wild.
It is difficult to say which chapter is the most interesting,
every page is delightful, but perhaps the author's account of his
visit with a companion to Albatross Island, one of the Hunter
Group, off Tasmania, is especially worth mention. The island is
composed entirely of rock, overgrown in parts with pig-faced
weed or mesembryanthemum, wild geranium and tussock grass.
While gazing from the top of the island the explorers suddenly
caught sight of a number of large birds sitting on clear ground
near the edge of the cliff, which proved to be Diomedia canta, the

these birds were very difficult to approach, " we went towards
them very carefully, keeping ourselves hidden in the tussocky
grass and frequently crawling along to avoid being seen. When
sufficiently close we took our first photo., and we did so by
slowly raising the camera to the level of the grass, all set, and
then letting our shutter go from our place of concealment. We
then remembered that the Albatross could not well rise from the
level ground, so approaching closer with less care took another
snap shot, and as the birds still did not rise, we boldly walked up to
one, and found that they practically took no notice of us." Some
extremely good photographs are given, illustrating the Albatross
colony and the birds sitting on their nests, feeding their young
and so forth.
One other extract, perhaps of more interest to avicul-
turists, must suffice. In the chapter headed " Mallacoota Inlet,"
the author writes : " In one of the gullies we heard a Lyre Bird
on its slight mound, mimicking the various birds of the bush,
even the Laughing Jackass, the Grey Crow Shrike, Gang-gang
Cockatoo, &amp;c. But what struck us as most curious was its
imitating the whining and yelping of a puppy ; and we afterwards
heard that some miners who were camped near by, used to
leave a puppy fastened up at their tent while they were away.
We also heard the bird uttering a note something like the sound
produced by a cross-cut saw, and as one had worked in the
neighbourhood, that is probably what it was ; it only shows what
wonderful power of mimickry these interesting birds have.
"We frequently heard the Satin Bower Birds in the dense
scrub and were fortunate in finding one of their bowers built in a
pretty situation and surrounded with ferns. These birds when in
their greenish costume are far from shy, but when the males don
their beautiful dark blue satin livery in their seventh year, they at
once seem to realise that they are conspicuous and always keep as
much out of sight as possible ; but for all that they evidently soon
fall a prey to the watchful Hawk, as it is a rare thing to see more
than one blue male in a flock of these birds. It is curious watching
their antics as they are playing round their bower, hopping about
with mincing steps and drooping their wings at the same time,
picking up sticks or shells and dropping them again in front of

-one another, and at the same time uttering a low running note.
They are also very clever at mimicking other birds."
Mr. Le Souef is a skilful photographer, and his photos.,
with a few by Mr. Mattingley and others, are liberally dispersed
throughout the pages of this book.
GILBERT WHITE, OF SELBORNE.
The Hastings and St. Leonards' Natural History Society
numbers amongst its members some of our best ornithologists,
who from time to time deliver lectures to the members on various
branches of their favourite science. One of the most important
of these was delivered on June 4th last, by Mr. W. H. Mullins,
M.A., under the title that heads this notice, and is now published
by Messrs. Witherby, at the moderate price of 2/6. An interest-
ing account of the life and work of the famous naturalist is given
and is well deserving of perusal by those who follow in his
footsteps. It is illustrated by several excellent photographic
plates.

HYBRID NEOCHMIA PHAETON x BATHILDA RUFICAUDA.
Sir,--I t may be of interest to record the fact that in my aviary in
Italy, on the bake of Como, a male Australian Crimson Finch, Neoclimia
phaeton, has taken to himself a female Star Finch, Bathilda ruficanda, to
wife. Unfortunately the two young ones, which were the result of the
match, were found dead whilst still in a featherless condition, thrown out
of the nest.
I still hope that some young may be reared in the future, for such a
hybrid would undoubtedly be most interesting. The parent birds are
building again, but it is rather late in the year, and I shall not encourage
them. Hubert D. Asteev.

AVADAVATS, BLUE-BEARDED JAYS, BULBULS.
Mr. Teschkmaker writes: --
"I see you mention the breeding of the Common Avadavat in "Stray
Notes," but surely this is not exceptional is it ? I bred two young of
this species in 1904, and two more in 1905.
"I should be obliged if you could tell me if the Bine-bearded Jay of
South America has been bred, and also if any Bulbul has been bred except
P. hcemorrhous which I believe, the Zoo. bred some time since.
[With regard to the Avadavats, it may not be very&amp;apos; exceptional for
them to breed in this country, but certainly it does not strike us as a
particularly common occurrence. Unfortunately our members are so shy
of recording such events, many apparently thinking that it is not worth
recording breeding results unless the species bred has done so for the first
time in captivity. We wish all of our members would record the nesting in
ilieir aviaries, of even quite common birds.
The Blue-bearded Jay has never, we believe, bred in captivity, and
the same may be said of the Bulbuls with the exception of Pycnonotus
hcemorrhous which bred at the London Zoological Gardens in September
1900, though whether the young were reared to maturity or not we do not

Certain publishers appear to be rather fond of issuing new editions
of old works with entirely different titles to those by which such books
have always been known, a practice which is calculated to mislead the
public and bring blame upon the author, though he may be entirely
ignorant of the publishers intention until after the book is in the hands of
he public.
Many of our members possess Dr. A. G. Butler's Foreign Finches in
Captivity , and if these should chance to hear of an apparently new work
entitled Beautiful Foreign Finches they&amp;apos; may be somewhat disappointed to
discover that this is merely&amp;apos; a cheap edition of the older work which,
though excellent in itself, is somewhat out-of-date now.
We understand from the Author of the above work that he knew
nothing of this change of title until a correspondent informed him of it.
Again, a new edition with coloured plates, has appeared of " British
Birds with their nests and Eggs" under the title of "Birds of Great
Britain and Ireland." In this case, however, a change of title was rendered
necessary as in most of the new plates 110 nest has been figured. We

understand from the Author that he wrote an Introduction in which he
fully explained the necessity for the change of name, but although this was
printed, corrected and approved, it has not been published in Vol. I., which
therefore appears as an entirely new work, though, as a matter of fact, only
the plates are new.
SPECIAL NOTICE.

mission to Australia for the Zoological Society of London, and
will not return until next May or June. In the meantime Dr.
A. G. Butler has most kindly consented to act as Editor of the

THE MADAGASCAR TURTLE-DOVE.
Turtur picturcitus.
By T. H. Newman, F.Z.S.
I have adopted the name Madagascar instead of the usual
one of Mauritian for this bird, as the former island besides being
so much larger is possibly the ouly true habitat of this species.
It occurs however in Reunion, Mauritius, the Seychelles and
Chagos Islands, but there is some doubt as to whether it has not
been introduced into these latter Islands. Edward Newton,
writing on the land birds of the Seychelles Archipelogo, in Ibis,
1867, p. 346, says, "I also shot a young Turtur picturatus, and
saw another. This bird is called ' Pigeon,' or 1 Tourterelle rouge,'
and was introduced, it is said, some few years ago by a late
Inspector of Police. It is not very common, and I saw it no-
where else." On the other hand, Ridgway, in Pr. U. S. National
Museum, XVIII., p.p. 512, 513 (1895), describes a female from
Mahd (Seychelles), as being altogether paler than an adult male
from Madagascar, and proposed to separate it under the name of
abbotti. He adds a note that Dr. Abbot is positive that the Sey-
chelles' bird is not an introduced species, but a native of the
Islands. To which our member, Mr. J. Nicholl, naively replies in
Ibis , 1906, p. 707, ''I did not see the so-called Turtur abbotti on
these islands (Seychelles). Mr. Ridgway proposes to separate T.
abbotti from T. picturatus, which was supposed to have been
introduced, as he says that his specimen, an adult female, ' differs
so decidedly in coloration from an adult male of true T. pictura-
tus from Madagascar.' Surely one would expect the female to
differ from the male even to a marked degree." The last remark

Mr. T. H. Newman,
is borne out by my birds, as is shown below. Reichenow has
more recently described a Turtle-dove from Diego Garcia
(Chagos Islands), S.E. of the Seychelles as differing from the
Madagascar bird by being much darker and having the crown
slightly washed with vinous, he calls it chuni. So it would seem,
even if it has been introduced it is already tending to split up
into races.
This very interesting and beautiful dove forms the type of
a small group of Turtle-doves confined to the Madagascarian
sub-region on which Salvadori bestowed the sub-generic name of
Homopelia. They differ very considerably both in appearance
and habits from the typical Turtle-doves; at first sight they seem
to lack the collar which in some form or other appears in all the
Turtles, but on close inspection of the adult birds, the bases of
the feathers on the back and sides of the neck will be found to
be black, having the ends greyish vinous, with distinct green
reflections in the newly moulted feathers. These feathers are
distinctly bifurcated, though not perhaps quite so much so as in
the Necklaced and Senegal groups, this fact is not mentioned in
the Museum Catalogue of Pigeons, though it was so well known
to Temminck that he took the trouble to give a separate figure of
one of these feathers on his plate of the bird (PI. Col. 242, 1823).
I11 shape this is the least graceful of any Turtle-dove that
I have seen, being of a sturdy build with relatively short tail and
longish legs, which points to the fact that it spends much time
on the ground. I think this is quite borne out by my birds; its
handsome plumage however quite deserves for it the name of
" Painted," by which it is often known. The head is grey, the
wings brown, with the scapular region beautifully tinged with
rich vinous purple ; the breast is vinous gradually fading to
white on the under-tail coverts ; lateral tail feathers dark gray
with ashy band at the end, in my male bird the inner web of the
outermost feathers on each side is almost white, but in the female
it is ashy. The central tail feathers are brown. The bill is livid
grey purplish on cere and on edges of gape ; narrow carmine skin
round eye; iris brown passing into crimson on the outer edge.
The pupil is nearly round in a dull light, but contracts to a narrow
oval, becoming almost a slit in bright sunlight. I have never

on the Madagascar Turtle-dove.
noticed anything like this in any other dove, I have not seen any
signs of its being more crepuscular in habits than usual. Feet
dull purple.
The female is easily distinguished from the male by being
considerably smaller, the purple patch on the back and wings is
duller and less extensive, and all her colours are less bright.
The following account of its habits is given by Milne-
Edwards and Grandidier, in their great history of Madagascar,
Birds, Vol. XII., p. 462. " These Turtle-doves are very common
in all the Island of Madagascar, particularly in the plantations
and cultivated fields, where they are found in pairs and some-
times in little bands of from six to eight individuals. Like their
allies of Europe, they walk well and fly with rapidity without
noise, they make quick turnings to baffle the pursuit of their
enemies, their cooing is soft and monotonous. They feed on
grain and make great ravages in the rice fields at the time of
sowing and at the season of harvest. Their flesh is very delicate.
Their nest, like that of all pigeons, is flat and roughly made of
grasses and small roots, it is placed in a tree at a low elevation,
their eggs are white, and measure 30 mm. by 23. The Malagasy
call this Turtle-dove Domohina , Lomohina or Dimohy ."
The Rev. J. Sibree, in Ibis, 1891, p. 564, says that Domohina
is the general name by which it is known, while Provincial
Malagasy names are Domoy, Demoy, Lamoka, Deho and
Demodemoka.
Early this year I saw advertised some " Aldabra Doves,"
thinking they might be the Aldabran Turtle-dove ( Turtur alda-
\0x25A0branus) I sent for a pair. On arrival I saw that they could not be
this species on account of their grey heads, and they turned out
to be the nearly allied Painted Dove, the subject of this paper.
For some time I feared that I had not got a true pair, though one
was larger and brighter than the other. The smaller bird soon
showed itself to be a hen, and laid two eggs in March and two
in April, but as the bird was at this time unmated, they were
unfertile. About this time I felt sure that the other bird was
a cock, as it began to coo a good deal to other doves, but
would take no notice of the hen. From the first they made
themselves quite at home, always I think roosting in the inner

Mr. T. H. Newman,
bouse, each in its own particular spot. The notes of this bird
are quite distinct and differ much from those of any other dove
that I know, both birds very frequently utter a hoarse nasal
sort of grunt. He-he-he, when alighting or fighting another
bird ; when on the ground they often draw in their heads and run
at another bird uttering this note; but they do not seem at all
quarrelsome as doves go. The coo proper is very different, the
cock draws himself stiffly up before beginning to coo to another
bird and making a very low bow utters his coo-co-5-0-0, the
last part very much drawn out, this note is low and of consider-
able sweetness, so very different from the ordinary irritable
grunt.
Although the birds were together from January, they did
not mate until August, when I was quite surprised to notice that
they were getting friendly.
Their first egg was laid on August 15th, the second
probably on the 17th, and a day or two afterwards I found the
eggs deserted, as they had chosen for their nest a zinc bowl in
the corner of the inner house of their aviary and the nesting
materials had slipped so that the eggs had got underneath, as
a last resource I put the eggs, which were of course cold, under
another pair of doves just as I was leaving home, not expecting
any result, when I returned a fortnight later, both eggs had
hatched, but one young had disappeared, and the other which
was about four or five days old was lying in the nest cold and
almost dead ; I warmed it up and gave it to a kind-hearted old
Pigeon x Dove hybrid who is now over thirteen years old, and
his white Barbary wife. They never have had any children of
their own but make most excellent foster parents ; although they
had only been sitting a few days, they welcomed the little stranger
gladly and brought it up splendidly. So this is how probably
the first Turtur picturatus was reared in this country.
In the mean time the old birds had built another nest in
the same place, this time using quite stout sticks and twigs,
making a good substantial nest, which was evidently quite
satisfactory as the two eggs which I found in it on the 1st of
September, both hatched and the young were successfully reared
by their parents. I am unable to say exactly how long incuba-

on the Madagascar Turtle-dove.
tion lasted, as the young of the first nest were hatched and the
eggs of the second laid when I was away, but I expect about
fourteen days, perhaps a day or two less was the time.
The eggs seem to be remarkably large for the size of the
bird, they are larger than those of the Half-collared Turtle-dove
(Turtur semitorquatusJ , the largest being hardly inferior to an
egg of Columba rufina, a bird to which this Turtle-dove bears
quite a strong resemblance in general colouration. The eggs are
of course white and moderately glossy, I have the four first pre-
served. The two laid in March are quite different in shape, the
smaller one is a blunt oval not much more pointed at the smaller
than at the larger end, this may probably be the first egg ever
laid by the hen, as the fellow egg and both those laid in April
are larger and taper off to a quite remarkable point at the smaller
end, giving them the shape of a short fat torpedo.
The young are hatched well covered with bright yellow
down, almost reddish fawn on head back and outer edges of
wings, bill flesh-coloured with an almost black band near the
tip, extreme tip yellowish flesh, feet and claws flesh-coloured.
The first plumage is very different from the adult bird. I
fail to notice the "greenish" tinge mentioned by Milne-Edwards
and Grandidier and quoted in the Museum Catalogue. The vinous
purple of the adult is only foreshadowed by a vinous tinge at the
base of the neck and on the interscapular region, while the whole
of the smaller feathers on the outer aspect of the wings are dark
gray broadly edged with bright chestnut, the quills have their
tips and outer edges also outlined with chestnut ; the under sur-
face is ashy with each feather washed with chestnut, the feathers
on the neck lack the dark bases and are not notched, the bill is
duller than the adult, being brownish gray with dark tip, feet grey
with, pinkish tinge, the scales purplish brown. The chestnut
ends of the median and greater coverts form two quite distinct
bars across the wing, when the wing is spread out a narrow,
almost black band is seen across the end of each ereater wino--
o o
covert, the extreme tips are again chestnut.
The eldest young one, about eight weeks old, has got many
purple feathers on the shoulders and has renewed nearly three
of its primaries, all the chestnut ends of its feathers have much
faded.

Mr. J. E. Brook,
The half-grown young in the nest has a curious appearance
when it fluffs out its feathers and snaps as all young pigeons do,
the dark bases of the feathers make a background for the chest-
nut coloured tips which then stand out very noticeably, it looks
like a black bird covered with chestnut spots.
The old birds proved to be very devoted parents: when
the young were three or four days old I noticed the cock bird
fighting the hen who was sitting, I think he wanted to sit on the
young and the hen would not let him, I feared the young would
come off badly in the dispute, but in a day or two matters seemed
to be arranged and things went smoothly. The hen would sit
closely when I examined the nest hitting out fiercely with her
wings. When forced to fly off she would as it were fall out
through the door into the flight, dropping on the ground, she
would flap her wings and struggle along the ground as if she had
lost the use of her legs,&amp;apos;if I followed her she would continue this
until she nearly reached the end of the aviary, then she would fly
up quite recovered, this pretended injury I thought rather inter-
esting in a captive pigeon, though I believe it is not unusual in
the Cohanbce.
Three specimens of this dove seem to have reached our
Zoological Gardens in the sixties, since which I think it has been
unrepresented.

I offer this paper to the Editor of the Avicultural Magazine
in the hopes that, if there is any value in it, it may help those
who keep the Brush-tongued Parrots in their aviaries to keep
them in better health and give these most interesting birds a
long and merry life.
My aviaries contain some ten distinct species of Tories
and Lorikeets and about twenty individual birds, all representing
the least known kinds. I have never been satisfied that the
feeding these birds have had was quite satisfactory, though
prepared carefully and according to the best advice obtainable.
The powdered plain biscuit with boiled milk and sweet fruit was

fairly good, but now and then I would see a bird blinking its
eyes and looking as though it had a sore head, symptoms that
more often than not were quickly relieved by a few drops of
magnesia, but then there were the few cases where relief did not
come but death did, and that swiftly.
I was fortunate enough to interest my medical adviser in
my birds, and on pointing out to him my difficulty as a non-
scientific man in finding out the real cause of illness, he kindly
offered his assistance and advice. We found in the case of a
Violet-necked Lory that died that the stomach was full of milk
curd and very acid ; this seemed to confirm what I had long
supposed to be the case, that indigestion was the cause of most
of the deaths among the Lories.
The next step was to examine carefully the excreta of all
the birds, and the same conditions prevailed in a greater or less
degree in every aviary, viz., the contents of the bowels was
alkali and contained some specks of undigested milk curd which
was very acid. It will be easily seen that a very slight derange-
ment would cause the stomach to become dangerously acid and
so cause illness or death.
The next move was to find some food that would not turn
acid on the stomach, and at the first trial we hit on what looks
like the right thing, viz. : one of the predigested foods, in this
case Mellins food for infants is used. My doctor instructed my
aviary attendant to give some of the Lories their evening and
morning meal of milk, with Mellins' in place of biscuit. He
then made a careful examination of the excreta and the result of
the analysis proved that the digestion was quite normal and that
all bad symptoms had disappeared. A little further trial showed
the amount of the patent food necessary with the boiled milk,
and the result is, that though the bottle of liquid magnesia is
still 011 its shelf it is very rarely if ever used, and the birds all
look in the very best of health with none of the puffiness so often
seen after feeding.
One fruit we found it advisable to discard from the Lories
aviaries, and that was oranges; bananas we use sparingly, but
grapes and soaked sultanas ad lib. Canary seed is not withheld
from those that care for it.

Mr. Gordon Dargriesh,
I ought to mention that I do not use Mellins' food as a
staple article of diet but only as a corrective. My staple food is
the usual milk sop made with powdered plain biscuit and fresh
milk diluted with about half its own bulk of water and slightly
sweetened. The Mellins is substituted for the biscuit and sugar
when there is any appearance of acidity or indigestion, and is
continued for three days. I have also tried peptonising the milk
with Fairchild's Peptonising powders with great benefit to the
birds, and I believe this treatment of the milk would help many
a Tory that was not thriving.
All this sounds like giving a lot of trouble, but it is worth
a little trouble to have a healthy bird, and the trouble is not as
great as it looks.

THE WHITE-EYED DUCK.
Ny?oca fer?-uginea.

of the family of diving ducks. M)&amp;apos; own acquaintance with this
Pochard was made in Bengal, where it is exceedingly plentiful
during winter, and forms the greater part of a bag made in a
day's duck shooting there. Charming little reed fringed pools
on marshes covered with water lilies, and deep broads where
there are plenty of weeds below the surface are the favourite
haunts of the White-eye. During the day, when the sun is well
up, it keeps to the shelter of the rushes, feeding little and
sleeping a lot. Very often one sees it searching among water
lily leaves, apparently feeding on small molluscs found there.
It keeps very much to itself, not mixing with other ducks, and
in parties of fives and sixes, and again in small flocks numbering
from twenty to thirty individuals. I have never found it a shy
bird, and one is pretty certain of bagging a few from every flock
that one comes across. When flushed it rises somewhat awk-
wardly off the water accompanied with a good deal of whirring,
and when well on the wing the flight is extremely swift. As an
article of diet I can thoroughly recommend the White-Eye.
Personally I have never found them fishy or rank, though it

would appear from the writings of other observers that their
experience has been quite the reverse. Out of water it has an
ungainly, one might almost say ludicrous, appearance owing to
its- small round body and large flat feet, and if hurried tries to
run, this ending in its tripping and stumbling. It bears captivity
well, and in quite a small space I kept a number in company
with Tufted Ducks (Nyroca fuligula ) and they got very tame
indeed, and would almost feed out of my hand. These Pochards
were caught in November 1900, and up to the end of July the
males showed no signs of changing their plumage. The note of
the White-eye is a harsh kurr uttered chief!y when rising off the
water. My captive specimens at times uttered a curious low
sound quite impossible to describe, but soft and not unpleasing
to the ear. The food of the White-eye in a state of nature is
omnivorous, feeding on grain, molluscs and small fish.
The range of this duck is given as the Mediterranean area,
Central and Eastern Europe and S. Western Asia, a rare straggler
to Great Britain. It breeds abundantly on the lakes of Cashmere
and numbers of its eggs are brought into the markets there and
sold for food.
The adult male has the head, neck and breast a rich rufous.
There is a white spot on the chin and a blackish brown collar
round the lower neck. The general tone of the upper plumage
is brownish, the back and the scapulars are minutely speckled
with a deeper brown ; tail, brown ; the speculum is white, upper
abdomen white, lower brownish; under tail coverts white.
The female is much duller, and the brown on the breast is
mixed with white. The bill is a bluish black ; legs and feet
plumbeous ; the webs black. Length of male about 16 inches.
The female is slightly smaller. It is only the fully adult males
that exhibit the characteristic white iris, those of the immature
birds and females being brown. The curious phenomenon of
Pochard's eyes changing colour is, I believe, not uncommon.
This occurred in a specimen of a male Pochard (W. ferini ) I shot,
which was only slightly wounded, and whilst giving it the coup de
grace I distinctly saw the blood red iris change to pale yellow.
The nestlings of the White-eye are most beautiful little
creatures. The top of the head is brown mixed with yellowish

SPERMOPHILA AS A POTENTIAL WEAVER.

<bodyText confidence="0.992061592592593" page_id="32669016"  page_num="Page 88" year="" vol="">
By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
On the 2SII1 of last month Mr. E. W. Harper very kindly
sent me three of the rarer species of Spermophila (or Sporophila
as Ridgway calls it, the name Spermophila not being synonymous
with Spermophilus of Olivier) viz., A. castaneiveutris, S. viinuta ,
and A. ocellata , all of which are well figured by Goodcliild on
a plate in Vol. VI. of Bird Notes.
Of the wild life of the first of these--the so-called Lavender-
backed Finch, nothing appears to have been published, so far as
I can discover. The second--The Fire-red Finch, builds its nest
of coarse grass, in bushes, and lays white eggs spotted with
several shades of rich red-brown : it is a near relative of the
Reddish Finch (A. nigro-aurantid), of which I had a specimen
for a good many years. The third--Ocellated, or Black-headed
Lined Finch (A. ocellata ), is another species of which we should
like to know the wild life, for even respecting its near relative
the Lined Finch (S. lineola ) we are only told that it affects the
outskirts of woods: it is a charming singer and should, I imagine,
have somewhat similar habits to other pied species with very
similar vocal acquirements--such as A. albigularis and A. ccerii-
lescejis, not that the latter is much of a songster, though a near
relative of the White-throated Finch.
The receipt of these three charming little birds again
turned my attention to a question which had engrossed it pre-
viously and respecting which I will offer a few suggestions ;--not
so much for the consideration of the systematise who is tied hand
and foot, and feels compelled to follow the guidance of slight

structural modifications of beak, foot, and wing, in his search
after the relationships of genera, but rather for those who con-
sider that the habits of a bird may offer a surer indication of its
affinities than the outline of beak, length and proportions of
tarsus or claws, of wing or tail, (all of which doubtless are
modified by the habits). Without a perfect knowledge of the
internal anatomy, I do not see how anyone can state authorita-
tively that any external character is inherited and not an adapta-
tion to the modus vivendi.
In the twelfth volume of the "Catalogue of Birds" Dr.
Sharpe places Spermophila near the end of the Grosbeaks ( Cocco -
thraustince) and near to Melopyrrha and Phouipara , but in his
introductory notes to the Fringillidce he expresses the opinion
that " Phonipara and Volatinia are probably Buntings."
Ridgway (Birds of North and Middle America) appears to
me to regard the three Sub-families of Sharpe's classification as
purely artificial, and their exponent admitted that they were so ;
and owning his own inability to define these sub-families, he
enumerates certain genera in which the young are streaked and
others in which they are not, rejects four genera as not fitting
into any of the groups susceptible to more or less exact defini-
tion, and concludes with an admission that his key to the genera
is to a large extent artificial.
The classification of any group of animals by external
characters alone must always be to a great extent artificial. A
natural classification must be based not only on the internal as
well as external structure, but also upon the habits of the living
creatures. I note that Ridgway does not ignore this fact, although
he puts habits last: I should be inclined to regard them (within
certain limits) as of greater importance than external structure,
especially where they deal with nidification.
The form in which a bird habitually builds its nest must
have been the result of a habit slowly acquired through many
long forgotten generations of ancestors ; therefore the structure,
especially of complex nests, seems to me a good guide, within
reasonable limits, to relationship. I should not, of course, re-
gard Phylloscopus as related to Munia because there is a similarity
in the general character of their nests ; but where, among the

Dr. A. G. Butler,
finches generally, there was a resemblance in nidification and
other habits, I should conclude that there was some relationship.
Ridgway calls Sporophila a genus of Seed-eaters ; and I
see no objection to this, because the Old World Seed-eaters, like
the New World Spermophilce , are mostly excellent songsters ; and
some of them have broad heavy beaks not unlike that of Chloris :
both genera, Serinus and Spermophila, build open cup-shaped
nests, and in captivity can be induced to build in nesting-boxes
or cups; but in the case of some of the Spermophilce the nests
are not formed in the mechanical fashion adopted by most of the
cup-building finches, but are laboriously netted into the most
delicate and artistic tracery of a cup, the materials used being
the finest and toughest fibre, rootlets, or horsehair. A. albigularis
some years ago built several of these pretty structures in my
birdroom, using the fine white fibre sometimes used for filling
grates in the summer time : they were light as gossamer, but
utterly untearable by human hands.*
Now it seems to me that when certain birds in a genus
exhibit a talent for weaving far in advance of other cup-building
finches, we see the first steps towards the development of the
marvellous structures produced by the Weavers.
In Melopyrrha and Phonipara (the second of which Ridg-
way calls Eiieiheia --a change which I consider quite unnecessary,
since both genera were described in the same year and the con-
struction of Euetheia needed later emendation) the nest is formed
precisely in the same manner as in the Viduine Ploceidce --
Muniince and Eslrildinez , and therefore some time since I pro-
posed for these clever architects the Subfamily name of
Phoniparince.
Ridgway says that Melopyrrha " is an exaggeration of
Sporophila , but between the most similar species of the latter and
the type of Melopyrrha there is a considerable gap." This is
just what one would expect where, though both birds weave
their nests, the finished structures so greatly differ.
Ridgway calls the species of Melopyrrha "Bullfinches,"
though no Bullfinch ever built a nest of the Ploceine pattern;
the species of Phonipara he calls " Grassquits," a name applied

to the genus in Jamaica, but the meaning of which is not evident.
I see no reason why Spermophila, Melopyrrha, Phonipara,
and perhaps Passer, should not be the modified offspring of the
extinct types from which the Ploceidee were evolved. The nine-
or ten-primary distinction is of no great moment, since it is
generally admitted now, that in the so-called " Nine-primaried
Oscines" the tenth is "always present, but rudimentary and
quite concealed " ( Ridgzvay ), and I would go farther and say that
in Passer and some other genera of the Fringillidee, and all the
Icteridee which I have examined, the tenth primary is better
developed and less rudimentary than in many genera of Ploceidee,
though concealed by its coverts ; so that the relative length of the
coverts, which varies in different genera, is the only distinction
between nine-primaried and ten-primaried Oscines.
Formerly I rejected Passer as a probable relation of Phoni-
para because I only knew of species which, like our British
Sparrows, constructed, at best, purse-shaped nests open close to
the top or at the top; but Stark tells us of Passer arcuahis:
"occasionally I have seen a bush so packed with nests that they
formed a solid mass much like one of the collective nests of a
Social Weaver-bird." He furthermore observes:--"The nest, a
domed structure, is more or less flask-shaped, with an entrance
from a few inches to more than a foot in length, through a
horizontally projecting neck. This is essentially characteristic
of the PloceidcE.
It seems to me probable that Munia and allied genera
which still produce species strongly reminiscent of Spermophila,
is the oldest type of the Ploceidee and that from this the more
gaudy Grass-finches, somewhat recalling the colouring of Phoni-
para and many of them with similar whispered songs, have
sprung ; finally developing into the more slender and alert shrill-
voiced Estrildinee or Waxbills. Whether the true Viduinee also
branched off from Munia or at an earlier age from Melopyrrha is of
little matter, since all family-trees whether based upon structure
or habits must necessarily be conjectural, however dogmatically
an author may lay down the law.
The Mannikins and Grass-finches, which may be repre-
sented roughly by Mu?iia and Poephila (Muniinee ) are practically

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
one group, stoutish, more or less heavy-looking and broad-billed
birds which, when singing, always depress their heads, open the
beak wide (unless holding a straw in it) ; and, with few exceptions,
utter barely audible songs. The Waxbills (. Estrildince ) are usually
more slender, with narrower more conical beaks ; which (when
the bird sings to his mate) are directed straight upwards towards
the sky ; even if the bird is almost destitute of song its notes are
clear. In plumage many of the Waxbills reproduce the general
colouring of certain Grass-finches.

Very likely this is all nonsense, like most phylogenetic
schemes for accounting for what we are all profoundly ignorant
of, but it will at least serve to indicate the groups of weaving
Finches, and call attention to certain interesting similarities of
plumage which seem to indicate relationship.
THE COMMON ACCENTOR.
(Accentor modularis ).
By W. E. Teschemaker.
I have often wondered why so very few of our Society's
Medals have been awarded for breeding British Birds. In the
November number may be found a list of thirty-five medals and
only two of these relate to British species and of these two, one
(the Pine Grosbeak) is but very seldom seen in this country.
Is it that our English birds are harder to breed or that, on the
ovine ignotum pro viagnifico principle, we regard foreigners as
more desirable ? I notice with regret that some modern works
on aviculture have laid it down as a kind of axiom that foreign
birds in a state of captivity are tamer and more interesting than
British species.

Of course everyone is entitled to his opinion and personally
I am absolutely opposed to this dogma. I believe no Shama or
Dliyal can by any possibility be more thoroughly tamed than our
Nightingale, Redstart, Whinchat, or Pipits; and there is more
character, more individuality in a Nuthatch or a Bearded Tit
than in all the Mannikins that were ever imported into this
country.
So, in defence of my own view of this matter, I will
endeavour to say something about the very commonest of all
our English insectivorous birds--the Accentor. I will not insult
the subject of the present notice by calling him a Hedgesparrow
and, besides, this would be a vulgar error, for he is no relation to
the Sparrow family. No ! He is Accentor-- the singer, viodiilaris
--with the tuneful voice, much admired by Beclistein, although
the latter did not consider he deserved to be called the " Winter
Nightingale."
Rather more than twelve months since, I wrote to our
Editor to ascertain whether the Accentor had been bred or not,
and for this purpose a query was inserted in the Magazine.
However, this enquiry produced no response nor have I been
able to gather any information elsewhere so that I trust that this
brief narrative, should it fail in achieving any other result, will
at all events settle this question.
I caught some Accentors in 1904--two males and one
female--in my garden and incarcerated them in a small out-door
aviary. These three Accentors, with one bred in 1906 and
another in 1907 are still in my possession, and this brings me to
my first postulate, viz., that the Accentor&amp;apos;s is an excellent life for
an Insurance Compajiy, which certainly cannot be said for the
majority of imported species.
I had some eggs laid on the ground in 1904, and a nest
built (but no eggs) in 1905.
In 1906 I caught up one male and female and removed
them to a larger aviary. Throughout the winter the male sang
charmingly, which introduces my second postulate, viz., that the
Accentor sings when other birds are silent.
I recently read an amusing article by Mr. E. Kay Robinson,
in the Daily Mail , on the " winter song of birds," contending,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.997566333333333" page_id="32669022"  page_num="Page 94" year="" vol="">
Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
inter alia , that the cause of the song of the Accentor was the
defence of its roosting places. I must confess that Mr. E.
Kay Robinson's views on bird-life are too profound for me ; in
fact they represent to me a series of problems more elusive than
those they claim to elucidate. I sing, myself, occasionally. Do I
sing because I fear someone may appropriate my roosting place ?
Certainly not, but because the mood takes me. In the same way
the song of the Accentor appears to me to be an expression of
himself and, if he sings in the winter it is because he takes a
cheerful view of life and, with his sound digestion, can keep
himself in excellent trim when other birds are starving. We
must recollect, in this connection, that the Accentor will sing in
a cage far removed from others of his race and further, when in
deference to a barbarous custom--uow-a-days, I am glad to say,
rare--his sight has been destroyed.
Before leaving th-e subject, let us note how sensitive and
modest is the singer--the true artistic temperament! " He sings
a few bars and then pauses. If y^ou show by your sympathetic
demeanour that you appreciate his effort he will sing to you
again and }^et again. But, if you interrupt him, instantly he
slips away into covert and is seen no more.
It is quite true that the Accentor sings when he is com-
pelled to settle any little difference with his neighbours--but his
song militant is not the same. Note also how these combats are
conducted. There is much shuffling of wings, much vitupera-
tion, perhaps a few feathers floating on the breeze--but no blood-
shed. After it is all over the combatants depart both carolling
gaily and both apparently equally pleased--in fact we might
describe these engagements, in the words of the immortal Mr.
Jorrocks, as " the image of war with one-sixth part of its risk."
They always remind me of those early Greek battles,*as narrated
by the venerable Thucydides, whereafter both sides used to retire
and set up a trophy of victory.
My third postulate will therefore be that the Accentor is the
most modest and sensible of birds.
At the end of March my Accentors commenced to build in
a small cupressus, and a pair of Chingolo Song Sparrows at the
same time selected the adjoining shrub. With some difficulty I

enclosed this corner with some herring netting and managed to
drive the two pairs of birds inside this enclosure.
The Chingolos deserted their nest at once, and I rather
thought the Accentors had done likewise, so exceedingly shy
were they in their nesting operations. However, on examining
the nest after a fortnight's interval I found one vigorous young-
ster. I supplied plenty of live insect food, and one day I suc-
ceeded by chance in seeing the hen administer a maggot. She
stood on the edge of the nest facing the youngster; the latter
opened his beak and his mother with one swift peck, so dexterous
that the eye could not follow it, popped the maggot far down his
throat.
A singular characteristic of this species, and one that I
have never seen mentioned, is that it has a tendency to become
bald on the crown. Every summer until the present year all my
Accentors have become quite bald for about a month or more
before the moult commenced. In that quaint little weekly, the
" Country Side," which I at one time used to read, a heterogeneous
series of questions used to be asked on all sorts of matters per-
taining to popular natural history, and to these questions the
long-suffering Editor never failed to furnish a reply which, though
not perhaps always quite convincing, was invariably most in-
genious. But one day there appeared a question which apparently
baffled the ingenuity even of Mr. E. Kay Robinson. It ran some-
what as follows:--
Qu. Can you tell me why our old cock Blackbird has
suddenly become bald ?
Aits. I cannot suggest any cause for the occurrence.
I feel that, where the Editor of the "Country Side " has
failed, it is not fitting for a humble member of the Avicultural
Society even to attempt a solution ; but, if I were to hazard a
conjecture, it would be that the cause has some connection with
the humidity of the atmosphere. As I said above, in 1904, 1905 and
1906 all my Accentors became bald towards the end of the summer
--even the young bird bred in the latter year ; but this season,
which as we all know has been phenomenally wet, none have lost
any feathers until the moult. Similarly a Virginian Cardinal
which I used to keep in the house always became bald in the hot

months but, after being turned into an out-door aviary, he never
was afflicted in this way. Of course a wet summer may mean
more insect food, and in this way its influence may be only
indirect.
Bechstein mentions the fact that, when kept in a room
with a stove, the feathers fall off from round the eyes and a kind
of scurvy is set up.
Towards the end of last August my Accentors, tempted no
doubt by a short spell of warm weather, again nested and again
reared one youngster.
I will conclude by again asking if any one can tell us
whether the Accentor has been bred in captivity.
Personally I think there is every probability that it has
been bred, but it is singular how little success aviarists seem to
have had with English insectivorous birds. The list of insect-
ivorous species bred, so&amp;apos; far as my knowledge goes, is somewhat
as follows :--Three Waders (Ruff, Redshank, and Avocet), one
Rail, two Wagtails, one Pipit, one Shrike, the Nightingale, Thrush
and Blackbird. No Tits, no Warblers, no Chats, no Buntings.
Doubtless the Robin and Starling have been bred, though I do
not personally know of instances.
It would be very interesting if our members would add to
the above meagre list from their wider knowledge of the subject.

The Black and White Toucans seem to be very common in
Natal, S. Africa. They fly with a light undulating movement,
and perch conspicuously in the low bush trees of the coast.
I have frequently seen pairs of them, and sometimes as
many together as five or eight. They are not quite so numerous
up country as on the coast, but may be seen among the trees on
the farmsteads, and being of a bold disposition, not unfrequently

of carrying away young chickens and stealing eggs, but I have

libel; the thieves and murderers being most likely the White-
necked Crows. Alice Hutchinson.
* This, I think, must be the species intended, although (in a sketch which accom-
panied this note) the bills are represented as black and not carinated ; but then this is the
bird known as the " Toucan " of the Colonists. It lives upon insects and fruit, devouring
(Stark tells us) a good many bananas and tomatoes.--Ed. pro. tern. A. G. B.

Those who are fond of the birds which inhabit the marsh-
lands and river-sides of our country cannot fail to be charmed
with the little book which has just appeared, written by two
field-naturalists, who have spent many long days with their sub-
jects, and produced many very excellent photographs of them in
their natural surroundings. No picture can be more accurate,
and therefore valuable to the student of nature, than those pro-
duced by the camera, and the writer of this notice has seen few
bird-photographs more pleasing than those reproduced in Home-
Life of Marsh-birds, which bear evidence of the great patience
and perseverance of the authors.
In the seven chapters Miss Turner deals with "Great-
crested Grebes and Coots," "The Water Rail," " Bearded -Tits "
and "Three Marsh-land Warblers"; while Mr. Bahr treats of
"The Snipe," "The Red-tliroated Diver" and "A Nesting
Colony of Black-headed Gulls." In the latter an account is
given of the rearing of some Gull chicks, which will especially
appeal to aviculturists.
There are no less than thirty-two photographic plates, as
well as several text illustrations. D. S-S.

habits of the Red-necked Phalarope, illustrated by sketches and

The Birds of Tierra dee Fuego. By Richard Crawshay, Captain,
Reserve of Officers : late Inliiskilling Dragoons. London, BERNARD
Quaritch, 1907. pp. 158 and pp. XL. of Preface, Introduction and
Index. 21 col. plates and 22 photographic plates of landscapes, one
woodcut and coloured map.
In the dearth of books in which the habits of South
American birds have been recorded, each one that appears is
a boon to the Aviculturist; and, however poor he may be, he is
immediately anxious to add it to his library.
I11 Taczauowski's three volumes upon the Birds of Peru,
only here and there do we come across a short paragraph by
Stolzmaun, which tells us anything respecting the wild life of
the species of that country.
On the other hand, in the "Argentine Ornithology " by
Messrs. Sclater and Hudson, the accounts of the wild life are as
complete as Mr. Hudson was able to make them, and therefore
are full of interest. I11 Burmeister's old work on the Birds of
Brazil we also find much information.
Mr. Crawshay has always been an enthusiastic naturalist:
in the old days when he was a great collector of East African
Insects, I considered him the very prince of collectors ; he never
neglected to record, not only the habits of the species which he
captured, but the character of the country, of the climate and of
the plants which prevailed.
As he was then, so he is now ; his work is always excellent;
what he does not know from personal experience he collates from
the writings of other Naturalists; and thus we, who (in our
search after records of the wild life of our captive friends) might
have to wade through many scattered volumes, are saved con-
siderable labour.
It is true that this handsome volume is very expensive and
thus only the rich, or the strenuous workers among our members,
can be expected to purchase it ; but there is comfort in the

thought that the edition is limited to 300 copies, and therefore,
with the passage of time, the value of the book will increase.

Geographic variation in Birds with especiae reference to the
EFFECTS of humidity, by C. Wieriam Beebe, Curator of Birds,
pp. 1 -- 41 with five plates (figs. 1--6) from Scientific Contributions of
the New York Zoological Society.
This is a most interesting and instructive paper tending
to show that moisture has a deepening and intensifying effect
upon the colouring of animals--a truth which, if I remember
rightly, the experiments of Mr. Merrifield some years since with
various British species of Geometrid Moths appeared also to
support.
I11 Part I of his paper Mr. Beebe quotes from various
authorities to show what different views they hold respecting the
action of climatic and environmental conditions upon colouring,
sometimes correlated with a difference of size. With regard to
the seasonal dimorphism of various Lepidopterous insects referred
to in this chapter, I have argued (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1904, vol. II.,
pp. 142--4) that, inasmuch as wet, dry, and intermediate phases
of a species occur and interbreed at the same season in some
very dry climates, it is probable that they existed originally as
simple variations ; and were adapted, through elimination of the
unfit, to the seasons or climates to which the}&amp;apos; had gradually
migrated. This view is, moreover, strengthened by the known
fact that the wet and dry phases of Catopsilia (C. pomona and C.
crocale with their intergrades) occur and interbreed at all seasons
in India, the differences between them being of no value for pro-
tective purposes. Thus, although experiment may affect the
pigmentation, it only reproduces variations originally unaffected
by the climate in which they lived.
Part II., dealing with dichromatism, is a chapter of con-
siderable interest, and particularly that portion of it which treats
of Chen liyperborens and C. ccerulescens ; but those who wish to
comprehend the changes of colour in birds must read the article
for themselves. While studying it I wondered if the little Wax-
bill Sporoeginthus mclpodus had really acquired a female with "no

orange on side of head " as stated by Cory (cf. Ridgway, 4&amp;lt; Birds
of North and Middle America," vol. IV., p. 288) owing to its
introduction into Porto Rico. I have seen hundreds of African
females, but in every one the orange patch was present, though
slightly less intense than in the males. Shelley recognises no
difference whatever.
Part III.--on Sporadic Melanism, is for the most part a
record of the opinions of various aviculturists respecting melanism
as observed in cage-birds, and is illustrated by our Editor's
charming plate of Munict castaueithorax and M. flaviprymna with
intergrades.
Parts IV. and V. are perhaps the most fascinating of all
the chapters, but unhappily I cannot afford space to review them
in detail. They show the marvellous effects produced upon three
species of American birds by subjecting them to a moist atmos-
phere : the changes from light to dark plumage are admirably
shown by photographs.
In Scardafella inca, after three months in a superhumid
atmosphere, the plumage was far more heavily variegated with
black than in typical wild A. ridgzuayi. But I must not further
prolong this notice, but would once more strongly recommend
all those interested in evolution to get it and read it thoughtfully.

Notes on The Birds oe Kent, by R. J. BadsTon, D.L., &amp;c. ; Rev. C. W.

and a map; 465 pp. (R. H. PORTER, 1907).
While various more or less incomplete general works are
appearing from time to time upon the Birds of the British Islands,
it is refreshing to come across a really careful collation and
review of what has been published respecting the avifauna of a
single county, by three fully competent ornithologists.
Even to those who are more or less familiar with the birds
of Kent, it is a surprise to discover how rich in bird-life this
county is, and how many species have been recorded as breed-
ing therein. It was news to me that the Redwing had even been
reported to breed in Kent, and still more that the statement had
been confirmed by a writer to the Zoologist-, but when one man

is searching for facts of this kind, he is not unlikely to overlook
them, and thus it is of considerable advantage for a book to be
produced by more than one author.
In the work under consideration the notices of accidental
visitors to the county are admirably complete ; and, although it
is highly probable, in the present days, when aviculturists are
legion and many foreign birds are constantly being imported
both by dealers and enthusiastic students of bird-life, that not a
few of these birds have reached our shores by the help of man ;
it nevertheless opens the door to adverse criticism if they are
ignored.
One or two points in the book perhaps call for a word or
two of comment : I am not satisfied that the Cirl Bunting is so
rare as generally supposed in North Kent. In the years during
which I nested there, I rarely missed seeing and hearing this bird
every spring. It was ijiost in evidence in a rough bit of scrub,
probably the remains of a copse, at the side of a broad rough
cart-road between two fields at Iwade. It was here I took my
first nest of the species ; subsequently I found two at Tunstallin
1884, and one at Frinstead in 1888.
When out birdsnesting with the late Dr. John Grayling
in the Stockbury Valley he called 1113&amp;apos;- attention to a Great Grey
Shrike flying outside a wood ; and subsequently when with the
same enthusiastic bird-lover near Dover we again saw this hand-
some species. This will add to the number of its appearances in
Kent.
To all who are interested in our native birds I can strongly
recommend this book, as being thoroughly up to date and re-
liable. The photogravure of a Woodcock on its nest is admirable,
and the coloured plates are in Mr. Smit's best style. This artist
certainly does not fall into the common error of making his birds
unnaturally fat and woolly; if anything his White-spotted Blue-
throat is a trifle too thin, but the work of no artist is quite of
uniform excellence. There is a useful map of the county at the
end of the volume. A. G. B.

Ornamental Waterfowl : A practical Manual of the Acclimatization of
the Swimming Birds, with references to two hundred species. By
Hon. Rose Hubbard. 2nd edition, revised, corrected, and enlarged
up to date. The Walsall Press, W. H. Robinson ; and Simpkin,
Marshall &amp; Co., Ltd.
It is with great pleasure that we welcome this new edition
of what has generally been acknowledged to be a most useful
book, and one which nobody who is interested in Waterfowl can
afford to do without.
Part I of this excellent Manual is divided into six chapters
which deal exhaustively with the Management, Food, Breeding,
Diseases and Accidents, Pinioning, and Exhibition of Waterfowl.
Part II treats of the various species and genera referable to twelve
Subfamilies. Under each species, its different forms or sub-
species, its habits, breeding-places, market-value, suitability&amp;apos;- for
domestication, treatment in captivity, and finally, descriptions of
both sexes, are given. The book is indeed a perfect Vade-mecum
for the lover of Waterfowl. The eight characteristic black and
white plates by Frohawk considerably add to the value as well
as the attractiveness of this volume: and one great charm in
the book is its handy size--not too large to slip into a side

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE TRUMPETER BIRD.
Sir, -- I trust Mr. Harper will not think me uncourteous if I quote
my authority for the name " Agami" in reference to the Trumpeter Bird.
In his Dictionary of Birds, Prof. Newton gives as follows: "Trumpeter or
Trumpet Bird," the literal rendering, in 1747, by the anonymous English
translator of De la Condamiue's Travels in South America--of that writer's
" Oiseau trompette&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; --which he says was called "Trompetero" by the
Spaniards of Magnas 011 the Upper Amazon, from the peculiar sound it utters.
He added that it was the " Agami" of the inhabitants of Para and Cayenne
(foot note, not to be confounded with the " Heron Agami " of Buffon, which
is the Ardea "Agami" of other writers) wherein he was not wholly accurate
since the birds are specifically distinct, though as they are generally united
the statement may pass. But he was also wrong--as has been Barrere--in
identifying the "Agami" with the " Macucagua " of Maregrave, for that
is a Tinamou : and both still more wrongly accounted for the origin of the
peculiar sound just mentioned, whereby Barrere was soon after led to apply
to the bird the generic and vulgar names of Psophia and Pelteuse
the former of which being unfortunately adopted by Linnaeus, has ever
since been used, though in 1766 and 1767 Palas shewed that the notion it
conveys is erroneous. Among English writers the name Trumpeter was
carried on by Pennant, Latham, and others, so as to be generally accepted,
though an author may occasionally be found willing to resort to the native
"Agami," " which is that almost always used by the French."
"Whitaker, in his ' Wanderings,' speaks of falling in with flocks of
200 or 300 ' Warracabas,' as he calls them, in Demerara."
Of course, Mr. Harper having lived in the country knows the name
this bird is called by in British Guiana, and as I am trying, through a
Captain out there, to obtain a mate for my bird: I am glad to know the
name " Warracaba " is generally used by the natives, as the name "Agami,"
which I had told him, might result in a wrong bird being sent to me.
Octavia Gregory.
Sir, --If Mr. E. W. Harper will look up the article "Trumpeter," in
the Dictionary of Biids (p. 991), he will see that Mrs. Gregory was justified
in her use of the name " Agami," while he is supported by Waterton's
authority for "Warracaba," or " Waracaba." " Agami " as an equivalent of
Psophia crepitans is to be found in most large dictionaries, in Chamber's
Encyclopaedia, and there are very few books on birds in which it does not
occur. To mention three which are close at hand--in the Royal Natural
History (iv. p.463) it is said that "in the Common Trumpeter, or Agami,
the general hue of the plumage is black" ; in Mr. A. H. Evan's volume on

Sir, --You will be interested to hear that my Swainson's Lorikeets
are now sitting on two eggs. The first was laid 011 November 29th and the
second on December the 2nd. I am hoping that this time both eggs will be
hatched.
The young bird reared last year is ver}&amp;apos; flourishing, but has not grown
any tail feathers yet, although otherwise in very good plumage. I fancy it
is a hen, for I placed it with the other old bird I had, a cock, and they are
the best of friends. C. Rosa Littee.
ON BREEDING BULBULS.
I note that in the December No. of the Magazine Mr. Teschemaker
wishes to know if any Bulbul has been bred beside P. hcernorrhous.
Wiener states that P. xanthopygus has been bred in Germany from
birds exhibited by him at the Crystal Palace in 1879, but Russ does not
confirm this, but tells us that Mr. Wiener purchased four examples of P.
aurigaster in 1S7S : possibly this may be the species which was bred in
Germany. P. sinensis went to nest in Dr. Russ'birdroom in 1S93, but was
disturbed by Porto Rico Pigeons. A female of Otocompsa jocosa built and
laid in Mr. Wiener's aviaries, but being uumated naturally failed to hatch.
This is all, so far as I know, that has been published respecting the
nesting in captivity of any Bulbuls in addition to P. hcernorrhous.

PEAT MOSS FOR BIRDS.

<bodyText confidence="0.9980222" page_id="32669033"  page_num="Page 105" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I notice that in the November issue reference is made to Prepared
Peat Moss, and to " Abrahams' Mixture" for soft-billed birds. A correspon-
dent seems to be unable to obtain the former. The Liverine Compy., Grimsby,
Lincolnshire, supply Peat Moss ground down to a fine condition, about the
size of coffee. I find it most useful, indeed quite indispensable for cover-
ing the floors of foster mothers and cool brooders. My first batch of
chickens is always due from the incubator on the 1st of January, and I
continue hatching till mid-April in this way, until broody hens can be
obtained in this district. I rear in foster mothers stood out in the open,
and without some such perfect deodorizer, and desiccator as Peat Moss, I
could never get on through the damp and cold of a Yorkshire winter and
early spring. If I were ever to keep Tanagers or Lorikeets, or birds of that
nature, I think I should find Peat Moss a great help. Of course, where it is
used, care must be taken to give grit and sand in a separate receptacle
whether to cage-birds or chickens.

THE SUPERB TANAGER.
Calliste fastuosa.
By Arthur G. Butrer, Ph.D., F.L.S., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Although several illustrations of this lovely, though well-
known Tanager have been published, in no case have they given
any demonstration of the colour differences which certainly exist
between the sexes. For that reason I have thought it well worth
while to get Mr. Goodchild to make careful drawings of male
and female in order that there may be no excuse henceforward
for anybody to overlook them. (Lower fig. male; upper fig.
female).
In the Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum, vol. XI.,
Dr. Sclater says of the female : " similar to the male, but rather
less brilliant in colour" ; but he does not point out wherein she
is less brilliant, and as he describes the species as having the
head and neck bluish green, it seems very evident that he had
either a young male or a female in his hand, when penning
the description.
The male Superb Tanager has the head and neck glittering
yellowish-emerald-green ; forehead and upper back velvet-black ;
lower back and rump, and outer borders of internal secondaries,
deep orange-cadmium ; lesser wing-coverts shining green, almost
like the head; outer coverts purple; wings and tail black;
primaries, inner secondaries and tail-feathers edged with purple ;
under surface of body mostly blue ; chin black, followed by a
band of green joining that on sides of head ; a broad black
crescentic belt across the throat almost joining the black of the
back ; breast and front of abdomen dull silvery blue, deepening

behind into rich purplish ultramarine: wings and tail below
slaty-blackish ; beak black ; feet blackish ; irides brown.
The female has the head and neck of a distinctly bluer
emerald-green ; the feathers on back of neck generally showing
more of their black bases than in the male; the lower back and
rump of a brighter more golden orange, by no means so dark as
in the male.
In addition to these colour differences, the beak of the
male is very noticeably heavier, both broader and longer than in
the female. Hab. : Pernambuco.
The above descriptions are taken from fully adult birds
which have attained their highest degree of colouring: young
males, when seen sideways to the light, have the head and neck
much more blue than old males; but, when compared with
females, make the colouring of the latter look distinctly dingy ;
a young male has the lower back and rump of the same golden
cadmium as a fully adult female. *
No doubt the apparent variation in the colouring of male
birds, due to age, explains why systematists have not indicated
the above colour-differences. It is necessary to observe the
change of colour in captive specimens, to arrive at the reason for
the seemingly inconstant coloration of head and lower back.
Very little has been published respecting the wild life of
the Superb Tanager : it appears to have been usually seen near
the tops of tall trees, only descending towards the ground to feed
or to nest. It is probable that, like the Three-coloured Tanager,
it builds its nest of flower-stalks and grasses, ornamented outside
with dead leaves, fragments of bark or tufts of cotton ; lined
inside with broad smooth leaves, and at the bottom of the cavity
with fine grass and hair. The eggs, in like manner, are probably
two to three in number, pinkish with deeper speckling all over
and a few larger browner markings enclosing black lines.
Whether, like its near relative, it also builds in banana-trees,
remains to be seen. At various times I have had seven of these
gorgeous birds ; but, either owing to their poor condition when
purchased or some slight error in feeding, only one of them lived
for more than two and a half years, and yet I believe I fed them
* Much deeper, however, than my oldest female.

much as I do my Archbishop Tanager, which bids fair to survive
for many years yet, while my two Scarlet Tanagers, purchased in
1897, are still both in excellent health and plumage.
It has been asserted that these brilliant Callistes only utter
harsh notes, but this is not true. The call-note of C. fastuosa is
a shrill chirp which he utters as he flits, with a curious Hedge-
Accentor-like flirting of the wings, from perch to perch ; his
ordinary song is not unlike that of some of the true Weavers,
very harsh and unmusical; but his early morning song, which I
like to think is also a courting serenade, is quite pretty and, as I
have previously stated, not unlike the song of the Indigo Bunt-
ing.
The first Superb Tanager which I possessed was a female
purchased on May cStli, 1897, which died 011 Dec. 12th, 1898,
moulting twice in my possession. O11 the first of March 1899 I
bought two pairs in rather rough plumage, and a fortnight later
I bought two others, one of these died in May and one in June
1899, the first in such rough plumage that it was not worth pre-
serving, the second not much better, but I had it made into a
skin : two died late in the following year and of the remaining
pair the male died on September 28th, 1901, and the female on
November 17th, 1903. This last bird therefore survived for five
and a half years, and yet at its death was more pronounced in its
female characters than the younger bird illustrated on my plate :
this would seem to suggest that whereas the orange in the male
becomes deeper with age, that of the female becomes paler. If
the moderately moist air of the lofty conservatory in which I
have always kept my Tanagers had had anything to do with the
gradual deepening of the orange in the males, it would certainly
have affected that of the females in the same manner.
If I had to restrict my avicultural studies to one group of
Insectivorous birds, I should certainly choose the Tanagers :
they are not only about the most lovely of all cage-birds, but
they are no great trouble to feed; as a general rule are quite
friendly after the first moult in captivity; and, if in good health
to start with, are likely to live to a reasonably&amp;apos; good age.
Judging from the measure of success which has attended
attempts to breed Tanagers in aviaries I see no reason why C.

Mr. Coixingwood Ingram,
fastuosa should not be bred, provided that a true pair be selected,
and it is partly with the object of making such a selection easy
that I desired to have the two sexes illustrated in colour. As we
know nothing for certain respecting either the nest or eggs of
this lovely Tanager, to breed it will be a distinct gain to science.
Of all the species of Calliste hitherto kept in cages, C.
fastuosa is about the cheapest and undoubtedly one of the most
beautiful. The following have been imported : Calliste tatao.
C. fastuosa, C. tricolor, C. festiva, C. guttata, C. flava, C. cay ana,
C. pretiosa, C. melanonota , C. braziliensis, C. flaviventris, C.
cyanoptera, all of them beautiful birds respecting the wild life of
which remarkably little has been published.
Why collectors in Tropical America have so rarely sent
home notes on the habits of the birds which they have shot it
would be difficult to say ; unless the explanation be that those
wffio sent them out, cared only for systematic Ornithology, and
therefore instructed their collectors to devote all their time and
attention to making big collections. Of course there have been
private collectors, themselves enthusiastic Ornithologists, who
have been quite as much interested in living as in dead birds,
and it is to these and a few paid collectors that we are indebted
.for all that we know of the domestic economy of Tropical
American birds.
ORIENTAL AVICULTURE.
By Coixingwood Ingram.
In not a few respects, the Oriental is a more ardent and
devoted aviculturist than his fellow-worker in the West. To fully
realise this one has only to watch a Chinaman take his bird out
for an "airing" just as an Englishman would take his dog for a
walk. Cage in hand, the Celestial is observed hurrying through
the dark and squalid streets of his crowded city, making for the
nearest green field or, if this happens to be too far away, for the
nearest open space. Having arrived at his destination, he quickly
uncovers his bamboo cage which he then places on the palm of
his hand and raises overhead, that the bird may benefit as much
as possible from the morning air and sunshine. Thus exposed

to the open sky the Lark--for the favourite cage-bird is un-
doubtedly the Mongolian Calandra Lark (. Melanocorypha viongo-
lica )--will soon spread its wings and burst into a joyful song,
to the evident delectation of its admiring owner. I have been
told by English residents in Shanghai that this is by no means
an uncommon sight, and I have myself, on several occasions,
seen numbers of Chinese indulging their pets in a similar
manner. I wonder how many Europeans would trouble them-
selves to this extent over the welfare and comfort of their
feathered friends?
To judge by appearances the inhabitants of Shanghai must
be exceptionally fond of cage-birds, for I saw great quantities
being offered for sale in a certain corner of the old native city.
Among these I was pleasantly surprised to see two or three
examples of that beautiful species, the Siberian Ruby Throat
(i Calliope camtschatkensis), one of which was being kept on an
open perch, where it was held captive only by means of a fine
silken brace. This individual was so tame, and in such perfect
plumage, that I was sorely tempted to buy it there and then,
but upon reflection I realised it would be quite impossible for
me to keep it alive during my travels, and refrained from so
doing.
Another charming species was the diminutive Chinese
Suthora, a little bird, that was being offered for sale at a very
low figure as, indeed, were most of the other birds, almost all of
which were either quite new to me or birds that I have very
rarely seen alive in Europe.
So far as could be ascertained, in China the soft-billed
species are not given any special food. They are apparently fed
on raw meat and egg, with some kind of dried insect that looked
to me like a Cicada. On the other hand, the Japanese--who are
really skilled aviculturists--rely almost entirely upon a specially
prepared food, which they seem to give with like success to
Warblers, Tits, Buntings, Robins, Thrushes, and, in fact, to any
bird that is either partly or wholly insectivorous. The same
recipe is, I believe, used in almost all parts of Japan, and is as
follows:--A fresh-water fish (usually a Carp) is first roasted over
a fire and afterwards thoroughly dried and then ground into a

fine powder; which, by the way, is said to keep good for a long
time. To one part of this "fish-powder " is added two parts of
rice-bran, and a small quantity of pulp from the cooked leaves
of a Japanese radish. The whole is mixed into a soft paste
with a little water and is then ready for use.
Owing to the difficulty in procuring the ingredients for
this preparation, the recipe will be of little practical service to
the European, but at the same time it is of value, as it serves to
emphasise the importance of fish as a food for delicate insect-
eating birds. I feel confident that fish could safely be introduced
into the diet of almost all soft-billed birds, when it would no
doubt prove a very useful substitute for their natural insect food.
During my stay in Japan one of the handsomest species
that I met. with was Temminck's Robin (.Erithacus komadom )--a
quaint-looking bird that is a strange contradiction to our common
Redbreast, the orange-ch&amp;apos;estnut colour being on the back instead
of the breast. Curiously enough, for many years this Robin was
only known to ornithologists as a cage-bird and for a long time
no one could be certain of its exact habitat. It seems that these
birds were brought to Japan from somewhere in the South by
native boats, an assumption that has subsequently been proved
correct by the fact that collectors have now procured them on the
Yaye-yama group of the Liu-chiu Islands. I saw perhaps a dozen
examples in all and these were mostly in the bird-shops of the
more Southern towns--Nagasaki, Kobe and Osaka.
After the pretty little White-eye (Zoste?ops japo?iica), it is
difficult to affirm which is the most popular cage-bird with the
Japanese, as so man)&amp;apos;' varieties are kept by them in captivity.
The beautiful Varied Tit is, of course, a great favourite, but
Buntings, Bullfinches and Larks are also commonly seen, as are
many others. Perhaps the most beautiful Finch that came under
my notice was a newly-caught example of the Japanese Rose
Finch (Carpodacus sanguinolentus&amp;apos;). This bird (together with its
mate) I afterwards brought home with me to England, but alas!
it has since moulted its bright rose-red livery and has acquired a
dull greyish-brown plumage, like that of the female from which
it is now barely distinguishable.
It may not be out of place to mention that some Sacred

Cranes (Grus japonensis&amp;apos;) were breeding in captivity at Kioto
when I was there in April. A pair of these birds could then be
seen feeding their young on large earthworms, numbers of which
had been placed for their benefit in a corner of the aviary.
Although the fledgelings were no doubt capable of feeding them-
selves, the worms were always first selected by the parents, who
held them in their bills until taken therefrom by the young birds.
A FEW AVIARY NOTES.
By Mrs. Gregory.
I have been asked to write a short paper on my avicultural
experiences of the past year. I have not much to record and
my collection is only small, but I trust the following few inci-
dents may be of interest, especially to those who keep birds of
the same kinds.
In January, just a year ago, a Red-legged Partridge was
brought to me on a cold snowy day. It was very hungry and
verv wild. I put it into a run with Pheasants and Doves, and all
were friendly, but it was painful to see this wild bird dashing
itself against the wire netting, sometimes making its head and
face bleed. But after a few weeks it became tamer, and one day,
having escaped from the aviary, I was surprised that it did not
fly away. All day it remained in the garden hiding, but at dusk
it came up to the run of its own accord and I was able to drive
it in.
Last March, when I was passing close to a Demoiselle
Crane, I saw her open her beak as if gasping. I ran to fetch
water expecting to find the bird in a fit, or ill. Instead, she was
standing, proudly arching herself, over an egg which she had
just laid. I shut the pair of Cranes apart from the rest, but no
second egg was laid and they did not attempt to sit. All they
showed was an extreme restlessness to join a third Crane--
a male I have had. for six years.
On June 9th, a Silver Pheasant Hen laid five eggs under
one of the dining room windows. She scraped out a hole close
to the house, completely screened from view by a large clump of

Michaelmas daisies. Here she sat very closely, not even getting
off to take food and water, which she let me put within her reach.
A few days before the eggs should have hatched out, I saw the
hen walking uneasily about and, on going to look, found the
" nest " empty. At first I thought a rat had carried off the eggs,
but presently discovered they had fallen down a hole and were
completely buried in the sandy soil. Only one egg was warm
and this hatched out in due course. When the chick was only
one day old the mother walked off with it to a secluded part of
the garden, and fed and looked after it entirely herself. Once
she was seen driving off a cat--looking so formidable with wings
outspread and hissing loudly that the cat beat a hasty retreat.
At the end of six weeks she brought the chick amongst the other
birds, and sometimes into the run where the male pheasant
Swinlioe + Silver treats it very well.
Since writing about my Trumpeter in the November maga-
zine, the severe frosts have made me anxious about him as I can
see he feels the cold very much. One morning I found him with
a leg and foot stiff and frozen. I carried him into the house and
gradually warmed them in my hands until circulation was
restored. During the frosts I keep him indoors, only letting
him out for a run in the middle of the day. He makes himself
quite at home, runs up and flies down the stairs after me, and
roosts on a special chair at nights. When the sun shines through
the windows he stands in its rays with spread wings and bent
knees, and basks before the fire iu the same way. Sometimes
lying down on the rug with his wings out.
I should like to add, in conclusion, that if any Member is
visiting Bournemouth, and would like to see this interesting bird
I shall be very pleased to show him. He wins all hearts by his
delightful way of running up to strangers, making pretty little
chirping sounds to attract their notice and attention.

By Mrs. E. J. Johnstone.
I rather fear that this article may not be very interesting
to the majority of the readers of the Magazine, for the reason
that I have now only a few birds, and those not usually kept--
but all experience is valuable and mine has been bought very
dearly, (in this I am sure I am not alone) so I hope these
notes may be acceptable.
At present the inhabitants of my aviaries are very mixed--
Touracous and small finches, Marmosets, King Birds of Paradise
and Lorikeets. I do not mean they are living like a happy
family in one division. I fear if this were so, it would be a case
of the ten little niggers and only my beautiful Lion Marmosets
would live to tell the tale. No! I am a believer in " one pair
of birds, one division," and as far as possible carry this out, at
any rate in the breeding season. This arrangement limits me
very considerably, but I feel sure nesting successes are more
probable and the birds live longer and more healthily. I will
take my divisions as they come and give a short account of the
tenants.
In the first division is a flock of Parrot Finches, four of
which I bred last year, and a pair of Gouldian Finches. These
little gems, the Parrot Finches, if nesting is to be successful,
vmst have a division either with a pair of larger birds or to
themselves.
East year, in April, one pair were turned into a small
additional aviary, with only an old wooden summer house as a
shelter. They at once commenced to build and hatched four
young ones. In June, owing to a consignment of birds arriving
from New Guinea and being pressed for room, two more pairs of
Parrot Finches and the Gouldians were turned into the aviary.
I saw at once that all hope of another successful nest was at an
end. In every available box or shrub a nest was constructed,
and as fast as one pair completed a nest, another pair removed
the interior, or any stray bits of hay that took their fancy, and
deposited it in another box, and so on through the summer. It
was not that there were not ample feathers, moss, hay, etc.: I

Mrs. E. J. Johnstone,
half-filled the summer house with materials but evidently the
fact that one pair fancied one special box or possessed a good
supply of feathers, was quite enough for another pair to come
and remove the feathers or take possession of the box. The
result was a few clear eggs and innumerable empty nests. So
this year they will be divided up and placed with larger birds
and I hope they may be overlooked and allowed to nest in peace.
Next door to these energetic mites live a cock King Bird
of Paradise and his two wives--at least I hope that both the
little brown birds are females--one is, I know, for two reasons :
firstly that she brought up, entirely on hard boiled egg, a
nestling King Bird brought by a native in New Guinea to Mr.
Goodfellow, their importer. It was found on the ground having
evidently fallen from the nest. It was placed in a cage, half of
which was wired off, and the little hen fed the baby through
the wire. Mr. Goodfellow, seeing this, placed them in one
division, and the baby was completely and satisfactorily reared.
This is one reason, and the other is nearly as good. She gives the
other two inmates of the aviary a very bad time--that is unless
they immediately vacate the food pan, grapes, apple or whatever
her ladyship fancies at the moment--with wings half spread
and quivering, neck stretched, beak open, she darts at them, a
picture of fury, a positive virago, and woe betide her beautiful
mate if he does not instantly make way.
The other "hen " is I am inclined to think a young cock,
his beak is a clear yellow, lier's a dusky yellow. He is slightly
bigger and more clearly marked, and very submissive.
These birds seem to be as hardy as Thrushes, they look
brighter if possible when the temperature is 40 to 45 deg. The}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
love the fresh air and dart eagerly out of doors when the windows
are open. I11 the small outside flight is planted a thick, ivy bush,
in which they delight. It is hunted over and over, for, I imagine,
small insects ; the dead leaves were all picked out and carried
into their covered aviary by, I believe, the young cock, and
after a little dancing, dropped. To my surprise one day, I saw
him sivcillozv a leaf and I expected some bad result, but it had
no effect of any sort. I feed these birds on damped insectivorous
food I make myself; grapes, apples and oranges, and any other

fruit in season. They constantly call to each other, but I have
not seen the cock display for some weeks, probably the cooler
temperature and want of sun would account for this.
In the next division is a pair of White-crested Touracous
(Turacus corythaix) handsome birds, but not nearly so interesting
as Fraser's Touracou. They will eat nothing but banana, and
hawthorn berries, when in season, which I give in large boughs,,
these they completely strip in a very short time and I was very
glad to discover how fond they were of this berry; they make
an excellent change for them and are a most inexpensive diet.
These birds are larger than Fraser's Touracou, rather brighter
in colouring and quite as handsome and hardy.
Next door lives a beautiful pair of Lion Marmosets. I feel
I ought to have left these out as they are not birds, but I cannot
pass them over without a few words for they are indeed things
of beauty. The silky, golden red hair and little soft brown,
intelligent faces, very gentle, daintily quick in movement, in
fact most interesting personalities. They live in a box, into
which they dart with a rush if a stranger approaches. They go
out every possible day and always have their windows open for
a short time in the worst weather. As far as I can tell at present,,
they are not afflicted with that delicacy of which dealers have
warned me. One dealer told me he had discovered the way to
keep them alive. I naturally listened with deep interest. "They
must be kept near a hot stove with a large pan of water on the
top, so simulating their native climate"! I have had these
Marmosets since June, in the best of health.
Fraser's Touracou comes next. I feel I have already written
in a previous article an account of these charming birds, so I
must not take up valuable space with reiteration. I lost the
cock bird over a year ago, but the widow and her son are still in
the best of health. She is as charming as ever, and will always
spring lightly down to be stroked and petted, throwing back her
dainty head with a hoarse "caw! caw!"
She is an indefatigable nester, and last year laid and sat
on several clutches of two eggs. These birds will eat quite a
variety of food, bread and milk, soaked biscuit squeezed dry,
sultanas, banana and other fruits. They are very fond of bathing.

even in the coldest weather, and dart straight into their bath
when it is first placed in the aviary.
Some Lorikeets are their next neighbours ; the Black-
throated Lorikeets, and the rare T. cyanogrammus, the
latter a very handsome bird, not unlike the Blue Mountain,
but larger and more brilliantly coloured. I have fed these birds
entirely on sweetened milk alone, oranges, apples and a little
spray millet. I lost one when first imported but they look in
splendid health and are as lively and merry as possible. They
delighted to scramble up and down the wires trying to catch
some Black-eared Marmosets in the next division. The
Marmosets had visions of Lorikeet for breakfast, but in
attempting to realize this, only had their fingers bitten.
I now come to my new aviary of four divisions, specially
built for the King Birds of Paradise, and with the exception of
one division in which nre my Lorikeets (Loriculus Johnstonicz ),
entirely inhabited by these lovely birds.
I have already written a short account of these Lorikeets
and they have been figured in the Magazine. They are in the
best of health and I hope will be more successful this year in
their attempts at nesting than last, for they only produced two
clear eggs. They sat on them industriously with no result, so I
rescued them before they were broken and sent them to the
Nat. Hist. Museum, as a small offering. Some day, perhaps, I
may be allowed to describe my new aviary, which is the result of
ten years' experience. I really think it is as near perfection as
possible, at any rate, the birds which inhabit it are in the best of
health and condition and I hope I shall have some nesting ex-
periences to record in the coming year.

In fulfilment of his promise, made in our Magazine
Vol. 3, N.S., p. 2S0, Mr. H. F. Finckh, of Sydney, has kindly
forwarded us three excellent photographs of this most remarkable
bird, one of which has been already reproduced in Emu, IV. pi.
xii. They represent the bird advancing, one foot raised, with
head well up, feathers fluffed out, wings partly expanded, tail
depressed, with the beautiful crest raised and expanded to its full
extent : from the front view the bird looks not unlike a Red
Indian adorned with a coronet of feathers. As we have already
given three figures of the bird, it seems unnecessary to reproduce
any of these photos, most excellent though they be. They are
accompanied by the following interesting notes : " I was pleased
to notice the remarks on the Kagu in your July Magazine. I
have taken a great interest in this bird, and have had several
in captivity for some years. I have had them lay an egg, and
also hatch a chicken. The Kagu lays one egg in the season, the
chicken hatches in five weeks, unfortunately the life of the
longest living chick was 14 days, the feeding of the chick is the
trouble, but I hope to succeed yet, although eight years have
been without success. I consider the Kagu one of the most
interesting and fascinating birds to keep in captivity, becoming
so tame. It is a great misfortune that these birds have almost
become quite extinct. I am continually in communication with
folks, who live in parts of New Caledonia, where 15 years ago the
Kagu was fairly plentiful, but now it is a great rarity to see, or
even hear of one. As your Magazine remarks, the Kagu eats
insects and meat, cut very small. Of late I have added a few
other birds to their enclosure, which live 011 grain, canary seed,
and cracked corn (maize), and to my surprise my two Kagus have
taken to eat the corn. The} 7 began on a few pieces only, but
now I notice them pick up ten to twelve pieces several times
a day."
From the above, it seems evident that this fascinating
bird must shortly vanish from our midst. As long ago as 1882
Messrs. F. F. and F. L. C. Fayard remarked : " In former times

it seems to have been generally distributed all over the island
(New Caledonia) but it has now nearly disappeared from the
neighbourhood of the more settled and inhabited parts." Its
*extinction should be very deeply regretted by aviculturists, as it
seems to thrive well in captivity, and no bird could be more
interesting to keep than this, with its varied moods, one moment
walking in stately fashion, the next perhaps indulging in the
wildest antics and frolics, rivalling and excelling the so-called
waltzing performances of the Ostrich, of which we have lately
heard (see Journal S.A.O.U., Dec., 1907). Every note respecting
the habits of this doomed bird should be treasured. We owe Mr.
Finckh a debt of gratitude for having found out so much about its
life-habits. He has told us the duration of incubation and has
described the newly-hatched chick. In Emu V. p. 32, he gives
an account of the nesting of a pair of birds in his aviary,
incubation lasted five weeks and one day, the male bird sitting
about four weeks out of the time, on the 32nd day the egg was
\0x25A0observed to be cracked, four days after a dent was noticed in it,
the male bird was then seen to carefully peel the egg to about
two thirds without damaging the inside skin, the chick moving
freely and chirruping, towards evening he broke the skin, and
the next morning the chick was perfectly out, and dry--a lively
fluffy ball, with a big heavy head. The old birds were very
anxious to feed it by dangling as many as six worms at once in
their bills round its head. The chick, however, was very help-
less, and only lived eight days, in colour it was dark brown, with
light fawn markings, legs and feet brownish, eyes black. A
photo of the chick is reproduced, which shows it to be as well-
covered with down as a young gallinaceous bird. It has an
enormous round head, nearly as big as its body, with large
prominent eyes. Once more has the study of the living bird
accomplished that which the scientific collector has failed to do.

By Dr. A. G. Butler.
In the "Journal of the South African Ornithologists'
Union," 2nd ser., vol I., pp. 9-11, is an article by Mr. Austin
Roberts, in which he attempts to prove that Vidua principalis ,
instead of building a nest for itself and incubating its own eggs,
substitutes them, after the manner of a Cowbird, for the eggs of
Waxbills and leaves them for the latter to rear.
Mr. Roberts first got this idea into his mind from hearing
that, according to the Zulus, a young Vidua principalis is reared
out of every nest of Estrilda astrilda. Subsequently the discovery
of two sizes of eggs in Waxbill's nests, a difference in one of five
fledglings in a Common Waxbill's nest, and lastly the fact that
he observed a hen Pintailed Whydah leaving a nest of this
species, in the passage of which he found a half-devoured egg,
and in the cavity one egg larger than the others, convinced him
that he had obtained the true explanation of the difficulty of
discovering the nest of the Pintailed Whydah.
So much for the evidence in favour of parasitism. On the
other hand the late Dr. Stark described nests of V. principalis
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.6152445">
very minutely, and says that all those which he found contained
3 7 oung birds; and, as Mr. Roberts admits, " without the least
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9822475" page_id="32669055"  page_num="Page 121" year="" vol="">
doubt as to the identity of the nests and the young birds."
Stark indeed says that " the eggs are not yet described,"
and this statement opens the way for the conclusion at which Mr.
Roberts arrives, that the larger eggs in the nests of Waxbills
belong to the Whydah. If so, we must conclude that, like
Hypochera and unlike other Whydahs, this species lays a white
unspotted egg; but Captain Shelley tells us unhesitatingly:--
"The egg is glossy greyish white, with underlying violet marks
and clear black or dark brown elongated surface-marks, evenly
distributed. It measures o - 6S x o&amp;apos;5C." As with Dr. Stark, his
description is given without the least doubt as to the identity of
the egg.
When a typical Whydali's nest has been described--" the
ends of the growing grass being tied together over the nest"

Is the Pintailed Whydah Parasitic?
as in other Whydah's nests, nestlings identified as those of V.
principalis inside (and for all we know to the contrary the parent
hen visiting and feeding the same) ; when also a typical Whydah's
egg has been described as that of V. principalis by the highest
authority on African birds; it needs more than a negro proverb,
disparity of size in eggs, or the fact that V. principalis , like
hundreds of other finches, is an occasional egg-stealer, to con-
vince one that it is parasitical in its habits after the fashion of
a Cowbird. Unless Dr. Stark actually saw the hens of V.
principalis visiting the nests, how could he be sure that they
belonged to that species ?
There is frequently considerable disparity in the size of
eggs laid in a single clutch by the various smaller members of
the Viduine Ploceidce. At the end of the year 1906 when I cleared
out the nesting-receptacle in which my pair of Gouldian Finches
had been sitting, I found eight eggs sufficiently recently laid for
me to be able to blow them without trouble ; the difference in
size between some of these is extraordinary, the smallest being I
should judge about one third less in bulk than the largest. I
have no proper measure handy or I would give the exact dimen-
sions in tenths of an inch or in millimetres; but everyone who
has bred either Grassfinches or Waxbills must have noticed how
very inconstant to size the eggs of these birds are.
Of course now that the question has been raised, it will
have to be decided one way or the other by irrefutable evidence.
It seems a pity that this was not secured before Mr. Roberts
began to call in question the reliability of Dr. Stark's observa-
tions, he appears to have been unaware of Captain Shelley's
confirmatory evidence.
If Mr. Roberts can bring forward convincing evidence
that V. principalis differs from all its relations in neither building
its own nest nor incubating its own eggs ; it will then become
necessary to discover what species of Whydah built Dr. Stark's
nests and laid the spotted type of egg described by Captain
Shelley.

I have not added many birds to my collection during the
past year or two but, on the contrary, have diminished my
numbers, as I found my aviaries were too full to allow the birds
to breed successfully; but as it is some time since I sent any
account of my birds to the Magazine, and there are many new
members since then, they may like to hear a little about my pets
and their ways. I never know quite how many birds I have,
as wdth deaths, new purchases, and young ones being bred, the
numbers are continually changing, but I suppose there are about
a hundred altogether.
To begin at the beginning, or rather to start with the
nearest aviary. This is a fair sized one--some 12 ft. wide by 18 ft.
long--it is built close to the house, one side being formed by the
end of the dining room outer wall. The front of the aviary is
open wire work down to the ground, but the side is wire only
half way down, the remaining portion being boarded. The
entrance is at this side through a porch and double door. The
greater portion of the aviary is taken up by a flight with a tiled
floor and covered with a glass roof; at the back is a wooden
shelter with a wire and wood front and a door opening into the
flight. The only occupants of this aviary are the Crowned
Cranes, a very fine pair of birds, sent over by a friend from
Nigeria. Our friend had once said, whilst on a brief holiday to
England, that he would send us some of these beautiful birds,
but we did not take the offer seriously, and so were taken quite by
surprise when one day a telegram came saying that the Cranes
were on their way. Our friend had kept these birds as pets and,
being ordered up the country 500 miles, he had not been able to
take the birds with him, so sent them home to us. He told us
later that the poor birds had a terrible journey when in charge
of the natives whilst being conveyed down to the coast. The
blacks seem to have little regard for any animal or birds feelings,
and thought it of little importance as to whether the Cranes were
carried right or wrong side up.
The birds arrived in England in January of last year, they

came in a sort of giant hencoop, with a front of bar f wood,
several of which could be raised to let the birds out. Although
they had spent the whole time of the voyage on deck and had
weathered a terrific snowstorm, just before they got into port, the
Cranes reached us in excellent condition.
Not many of our members may have seen a Crowned
Crane, and as I think it is very uninteresting reading about a
bird when you do not know what it is like, I will try and describe
them to 3 ? ou. They are very tall long-legged birds and stand
about four feet high, the cock being rather larger than the hen,
though the colouring of both birds is practically the same. The
male bird however has a little knob of pink flesh under the
chin, though this is difficult to see unless you are very close to
him. The general colour of the long neck and body is greyish
black, but the wings and tail are white and chocolate brown. On
the head is a beautiful crest of pale golden bristle-like feathers.
This crest is very thick and stands straight up giving the birds a
very distinguished appearance. The cheeks are of bare skin and
have a distinct dividing line across them, one part being pinkish
white, the other bright carmine pink. The eyes are very pale
blue-grey, almost white, with a dark iris ; the bill is black, not
very long but sharp and pointed. From this description 3^011 will
see the Cranes are very handsome birds and they have a very
stately walk, which adds further to their fine effect. They
generally march in single file, the hen, who is the master spirit,
leading the way as they wander over the garden at will. But
this is going on a long way in my story and I must take 3 r ou back
to the time of the Cranes arrival. It was in the depth of winter
when tlie3 T came, and we feared the effect of the cold damp
weather on the birds. The best provision we could make for
them was to put them in one division of my largest aviary, that
is heated with a large coke stove in the passage running along
the back of the house.
The space at our disposal was only small, some 7 ft. by
22 ft. divided into three parts (with communicating doors)
namety, a flight and two shelters, added to this space was a

at would not pass through the aviary door, and the birds reso-
lutely refused to come out when the coop door was opened and
the coop placed against the open doorway.
We did not like to catch the Cranes, for to tell the truth
the sharp bills of such tall birds were not very pleasant in such
near conjunction to one's eyes. The persuasion of gentle pokes
with a stick only made the Cranes stand further back and matters
began to look desperate. There seemed nothing for it but to
put down the coop by the open aviary door and wait till hunger
drove the birds out. Then someone thought of the very simple
plan of loosening a single board at the back of the coop and
driving the birds out with a stick. Why no one had thought of
such an easy solution of the difficulty before I do not know. It
took effect at once and in a few minutes the Cranes were safe in
their new quarters.
But we soon found the place was far too small for them.
Cranes are great jumpers and, when frightened, the hen, who
was by far the most nervous of the two birds, did not hesitate to
jump upwards, a course of action very alarming to the onlooker
as it sometimes meant she cut herself on the wire netting and
lost a good deal of blood. At last there was no denying the fact
the Cranes must be pinioned and have their liberty, or we must
send them away to someone who could accommodate them better.
We dreaded the pinioning and pictured the birds as dying under
the operation, and there was a still further gloomy side to the
picture even if they recovered. My family take the keenest
pleasure in our old-fasliioued garden. No doubt the Cranes
would look pretty walking about in it, but suppose they were not
content with merely looking at the plants and flowers! They
might be as active working gardeners as Peacocks are, and if
they were it would be too terrible a thing to contemplate. We
were not without experience of suffering in the past. Some
Fancy Waterfowl we once had, though otherwise most interesting
and beautiful pets, always made a practice of walking straight
through a large patch of lovely blue Omphalode in my sister's
rock garden 011 their way to the little stream each evening.
They wore quite a track through the plant, and it was a little
thoughtless of them as there are plenty of gravel paths down to

the water's edge. Further, the ducks had a fine taste in the
young shoots of Campanulas to add to their other crimes.
But to return to the Cranes. The die was cast at last, and
we arranged with Mr. Thorpe, of Hull, to come over and pinion
the birds, bringing a man to help him. We arranged that the
operation should be done in the aviary they were in, in the lower
garden, and that afterwards they should be carried up to the
aviary I first told you of in the top garden near the house. The
two gardens are divided by an old yew hedge with a wicket gate
at each end, and as this top part is protected all round on every
side there is no fear of the birds getting away, and there being
plenty of room they can enjoy their liberty whilst we have the
pleasure of watching them from the house.
The pinioning was over very quickly. I was not present
but I saw the birds directly after it was done. Mr. Thorpe
carried them one at a time up the garden under his arm and
deposited them in the aviary that was now to be their home.
The birds seemed very quiet but otherwise not much the worse
for the operation. The hen's wing was the worse to do. In some
way, perhaps owing to an old injury, the joint was very thick and
stiff and difficult to cut through. I must tell you a little incident
about the pinioning that may amuse you, though the laugh is
against myself. I am a coward at the sight of blood, it always
makes me feel faint, though if I am given something to do, not
just to look on at such a time, I feel it much less. I had not
actually seen the Cranes pinioned for, apart from not caring to, I
was very busy seeing about their new home being made comfort-
able. I had just about finished when Mr. Thorpe appeared,
coming up the garden, carrying the cock Crane in his arms. As
he drew nearer I saw to my horror a large patch of scarlet at the
side of his coat. I thought 'how that bird has bled,' and I began
to wish I was somewhere else, but I crushed the feelingdowu and
went on with my work ; and, do you know, when Mr. Thorpe
got nearer my large patch of gore turned out to be his scarlet
handerchief hanging half out of his side coat pocket. So much
for too vivid an imagination !
For the next few days we kept the Cranes very quiet. I
have canvas curtains run with rings over a thin metal rod, that

can be drawn at will right over the front of this aviary. This
simple plan keeps out much of the cold in winter, and also keeps
out a worse enemy still, the prying gaze of strange cats. Not
only at night are the curtains useful but also in the day time, if it
is wished to keep any birds especially quiet. So for two or three
days the Cranes were kept as undisturbed as possible, and then
as they seemed all right the curtains were drawn back and their
door opened. We dreaded when they did come out into the
garden how we should get them back into the aviary at night,
but our fears were quite needless. The Cranes proved very in-
telligent, and soon got into a regular habit of marching back to
the aviary at what the}&amp;apos; considered their bedtime and going in of
their own accord. Their door stands open all day, and after they
have gone in it is locked till morning. All the same the Cranes
are very particular and on no account must be put off at their
appointed time or they may turn tiresome and refuse to go in.
Once we had some friends in for croquet, and the game being a
long one the players were still on the lawn at the time the Cranes
wanted to cross it to get to their house. They came so far and
then turned shy and went back, and that night and for several
nights following they were very unsettled about going in. Fur-
ther, they are very suspicious. Another time they were going
into the aviary when they hesitated and did not seem to care
to go on, and on looking we found a broken twig had blown
across the doorway, and I suppose they thought it was a trap,
anyway the twig being removed their objection to going in was
removed also, and they went inside quite quietly.
In the shelter is a layer of peat moss litter and at one end,
on the top of this, a thick layer of straw. I believe the Cranes
crouch in this at night as I have seen them do 011 the hot
asphalt walks on a summer's day. They look very curious when
squatting on their knees, for naturally they don't kneel as we
should do with our feet backwards but the reverse way, with their
feet in front of them.
The Cranes live on wheat, dari, hemp, and rice, and seem
to thrive on this diet, also they have what insects we can get, and
are especially fond of live blackbeetles. We empty them out of
the traps into shallow pans of water, out of which the birds pick

them. The Cranes know quite well what the sight of a beetle
trap means now, and if they see you with one in your hand they
will probably come out of their favourite corner in the shrubbery
to meet you. They are birds that delight in water and " Rex,"
the cock bird, will go right into a very large zinc bath that is
always kept filled for them and make a fine splashing. We found,
after all, the Cranes were not plant eaters but, what is almost as
bad, they are plant sitters. I do not know if the hen had any
idea of nesting last summer, but she chose to sit continually in
the centre of a large bed of crimson ivy leaved geranium, " Rex"
standing guard over her meantime. Later they turned their
attention to beds of Verbenas and other plants. We could not
do away with the flowers, nor did we want to do away with the
Cranes, and so the gardener, who was very patient over the
affliction, for really it was trying to see his bedding out so spoilt,
put small stakes and twine (a sort of miniature fencing) all round
the outside of the flower beds. I hope, as the novelty may have
gone off by now, we shall be able to dispense with this pro-
tection in the summer and enjoy our flowers undisturbed. I have
not seen the Cranes on the beds for a long time now, though
I once saw "Rex" very cautiously try his weight with one foot
on the top string and, finding it would bear him, I believe he
stepped over. The Cranes are a most devoted couple and it is
very&amp;apos;&amp;apos; amusing to watch them. They will stand motionless facing
one another, gazing into each other's eyes, then solemnly bow
and shake their wings, and stretching them out above their heads
perform a sort of love dance. It is only when the wings are
spread that the pinioning shows badly, for two joints were taken
off one wing in each bird, when the wings are in repose you
would not notice it.
One last word about the Cranes before you are tired of them.
You should see them cross the garden in a series of long jumps
with stretched out wings and necks. First one bird goes and
then the other, and " Hop o' my Thumb " is not in it. But it is
not very often they so far forget themselves, as a rule they are
far too stately to indulge in such mad behaviour. And now I
will take you down to the lower garden to see almost the first
aviary I ever put up. It is heated with hot water pipes, a bad

arrangement as the Doves, who like to be comfortable, wilt sit on
them, and it must be very weakening. The front is all glass
shutters that can be taken down independently of each other.
The aviary itself is built of two thicknesses of wood with a felt
lining between, and is built against a wall. It is about 15 ft.
high at the top of the span, and has two opening skylights in
the roof, and a window at each end, so there is plenty of light.
It is divided into two parts, one rather larger than the other and
is entered at each of the outer ends by a little porch and double
door.
The smaller half has at present only seven occupants.
One is a hen Crested Dove that is about the oldest bird I have.
Years ago she hit her wing and crippled herself from ever flying
again for life. But this did not daunt her spirit, she could climb
if she could not fly, and frequently used to get right to the top
branches of the aviary. But pride had literally a fall. She
would perhaps be startled and lose her balance and tumble to the
aviary floor, apparently being none the worse for her fall. But
one day, to my horror, I found she had an enormous wound 011
her breast. It was almost unnoticeable, through the feathers
covering it, till the bird was examined and I could only conclude
it had started with her first falling and with repeated falls had
never been able to heal properly. It was so terrible a wound,
though it did not bleed, that I thought of having the bird
destroyed, but her life was spared and the place not only healed
but you could not tell where the wound had been if you were to
look at her now. Of course her climbing propensities had to be
stopped and all branches fixed above her reach except a long one
to perch on. In this aviary is one of my special pets a little Blue-
cheeked Barbet that is known by the name of " Barbie." He is
such a bright cheery little fellow and always contented and happy,
and is no trouble to keep. He lives on a diet of "soft" food, that
I buy at 8d. a lb., mixed with crushed biscuit and moistened, and
a little cut up fruit every day for dessert. " Barbie" has a varied
appetite and uothing comes amiss,--banana, sweet water grapes,
orange, tomato, chopped pear and apple, and elderberries, some-
times too,--he likes a little dry biscuit broken up small. I have
had "Barbie" now for some years so may consider him well

acclimatised. He is a very pretty bird, though an odd shape,
something like a Kingfisher but rather larger, with a very big
head and heavy bill. The top mandible is almost straight, and
the bottom line of the lower mandible very curved, which makes
it look as if the beak was fixed on upside down. The Blue-
cheeked Barbet is a very brightly coloured bird. His body is
grass green, the head scarlet and black, and the cheeks and upper
part of the throat a most lovely shade of turquoise blue, finished
off by two little red patches just below the throat. The lower
part of the breast is a very soft green, lighter than the back, the
wing quills are black and the eye deep brown with a black iris.
It is very pretty to watch " Barbie " when I bring him his dish
of fruit. I put it down on the floor and he eyes it with his head
on one side, then he flies down to a lower branch still and pauses
again (he seldom flies down at one swoop) and then descends to
the floor. Once on the ground he progresses by a series of hops
and then sitting on the side of the dish, begins his feast. But
he is a shy little bird. You must keep very still or he will fly
off and wait till you are gone, but it is the same in watching all
aviary birds, you must keep very still if you want to notice them
in a natural condition.
The Barbet deserves a good conduct mark for his very
peaceable disposition. He has lived in quiet with Doves and
Parrots and never injured anything, but he looks as if a taste for
eggs might be in him if he had the chance, and in this respect it
might be well not to place him in temptation.

merely compiled from the writings of other Naturalists, but in
this 20/- volume Mr. Bonhote tells us that his observations are
taken at first hand straight from Nature, and it is evident that
this is so, from the fact that in his descriptions of nests, the
author occasionally differs somewhat from other observers.
There can be little doubt that the materials and even the
character of a nest differ somewhat in various parts of the British
Islands, and it is possible that even the number of eggs laid may
vary: thus whereas all the nests which I found in Kent of the
Lesser Whitetliroat were far more compact and neat than those
usually constructed by its Greater cousin, Mr. Bonhote found the
reverse to be the case in those which he met with. In like
manner all my nests of the Yellow Hammer, though tolerably
firm in the interior, had the outside -walls very loosely con-
structed. In England certainly, as stated by Mr. Bonhote, the
usual clutch is five (I have frequently found four); but it has
been positively asserted by one or two Scottish collectors that
three is the usual clutch in the north of Britain. In his des-
criptions of eggs the author has, perhaps wisely, confined him-
self almost invariably to the most frequent type.
Where the work all-round is so excellent, it seems perhaps
hypercritical to find fault, but I cannot help wishing that Mr.
Bonhote had not confined his observations on the sexes of many
birds, to the bare statement that the plumage is practically
alike : in the case of the Robin, for instance, it would be equally
easy to state that all the reddish orange on the forehead, eye-
brow, lores, front of the cheeks, and especially of the chin, was
more or less smoky in the hen.
Mr. Bonhote deserves well of his fellows for his unstinted
condemnation of the Sparrow ; he very rightly concludes that
the only saving feature in this hooligan among birds is the quiet
beauty of colouring in country-bred males.
Touching the illustrations to this book one can only say
that, whereas all are good, some are better than others. Among
the most characteristic are those of the Blackbird, Redstart,
Dartford Warbler, Fire-crest, Tree Creeper, Spotted Flycatcher,
Magpie, the Raptores generally and the Limicolae. The plate
of the Goldfinch shows the usual sexual characteristics and is

therefore admirable ; that of the Mealy Redpoll appears to have
been prepared from Continental birds, I have never seen British
specimens so distinctly marked. The plate of the Chaffinch is
the least successful.
Our members will be able to see that I have not over-
praised the illustrations, since the courtesy of the publishers has
enabled us to use one of the plates to accompany the present
notice.
In conclusion, I urgently recommend every lover of our
native birds to secure a copy of this beautiful and instructive
volume: he will find that his money has been well spent.

PETS and How To Keep Them : with twelve coloured plates and many
illustrations after photographs from life : by Frank Finn, B.A.,
F.Z.S., &amp;c. London, Hutchinson &amp; Co., Paternoster Row, 1907.
This is one of the most charming and handy little volumes
that we have seen for many a long day, and one calculated to be
extremely useful to all who keep pets. It is not confined to one
type of pet, but embraces the whole of the vertebrata : neverthe-
less a considerable portion of the book is devoted to birds ; not,
Mr. Finn tells us, because of his individual preference for the
feathered tribe, but because a great majority of the animals
available for pet-keepers belong to that Class.
From personal experience we are quite able to endorse the
statement that " a captive animal, if well housed and fed, has a
much better expectation of life than a wild one, and it is quite
possible that in the long run it enjoys more happiness during
its lifetime."
The first fifty-nine pages are devoted to Mammals, and
then come upwards of a hundred pages on Cage and Aviary,
Garden and Park Birds, wherein much sound advice is given.
Here and there we do not quite agree with the author's con-
clusions, but this must always be the case when one aviculturist
compares his own experiences with those of another : it has been
said that "two of a trade can never agree," and there is a
modicum of truth in the saying, but in the majority of cases
experienced bird-keepers agree remarkably well.

Grey Parrots at any period of their lives. Out of some six
hundred cases of sickness brought to the reviewer's notice
during the past nine years, about a third have suffered from
vomiting, diarrhoea, and apparent influenza colds : in nearly
every instance the malady has been traceable to the use of sop
and generally milk-sop, and has been checked or cured almost
immediately by a removal of the unnatural food and recourse to a
dry regime.
After the Garden and Park Birds (Part III.) we come to
the Cold-blooded Animals beginning with those interesting pets
--the Reptiles and Amphibians for which, strangely enough,
some people seem to have an unaccountable horror ; yet lizards
make most interesting and affectionate pets, while the harmless
snakes and slow-worms are pretty and soon learn to know their
owner. The book terminates with accounts of the various more
popular species of fish suitable for aquaria. Altogether it is a
valuable and instructive book, which all lovers of Nature would
do well to add to their libraries. The plates and photographs
are admirable, the natural attitudes of the animals being truth-
fully depicted, and where colours are given these also are true to
Nature. A. G. B.
BRITISH BIRDS.
The January number of British Birds commences with
an account, illustrated by two photographs, of the breeding of the
Hen-Harrier and Hobby in Surrey in 1907, by C. H. Bentliam
and L- B. Mouritz. The only previous record of the former
bird breeding in the county appears to have reference to some
young birds taken as long ago as 1842, but the Hobby has been
known to nest in Surrey twice previously. Dr. C. B. Ticehurst
publishes a short article on the Wood-Pigeon diphtheria ;
Messrs. H. F. Witherby and N. F. Ticehurst continue their
account of the more important additions to our knowledge of
British Birds since 1899 ; Mr. J. B. Nichols records and illustrates
a new British bird--the Grey-backed Warbler as having occurred
in Kent, and points out the characters by which it may be dis-
tinguished from the Rufous Warbler ; a number of interesting
Notes and two Reviews complete the number.

paper especially interesting to aviculturists on account of the full
notes on the habits of the birds of that region which it contains.
Another paper of a similar character is entitled " Ornithological
Notes from Japan," by Collingwood Ingram.
Other articles in this part are by Percy R. Rowe, " O11 the
Ground-Dove of Porto Rico, with Notes on the other species of

opinion as the reviewer--that the different colouring of the soft
parts in these doves entitles them to specific rank.
Dr. Bowdler Sharpe has an article, illustrated bj r a

The number concludes with Obituary Notices of Mr. Howard

of recent Ornithological Publications, Tetters, Extracts, Notes,

BRITISH BIRDS SUITABLE FOR AVICULTURE.

Sir,-- In your January number Mr. Tescliemaker puts in a plea for
British birds as suitable for aviculture, a sentiment which I most cordially
endorse, while his further remarks are extremely practical and to the point.
As I am just completing a list of our native birds that have been bred In
confinement for 'British birds,' I will not attempt to enter on the matter
here beyond stating that Mr. Tescliemaker is practically correct in the
list&amp;apos; he gives.
As regards that delightful bird the 'Accentor,' I have frequently had
this species nest and hatch in my aviaries, but I have never reared anv
as young, I could not afford to give them an aviary to themselves, or to
supply them with a sufficiency of insect food. To the best of my know-
ledge Mr. Tescliemaker's is the first recorded instance of the rearing of
the young in captivit}&quot;.
Unfortunately in the Zoological Society's Gardens, where one might
expect to find records of birds that have nested, the records kept are so
meagre as to be absolutely unreliable, while practically no notes on the com-
paratively few species they have bred are to be found either in print or
manuscript. J. Lewis BonhoTE.
Sir,--I n response to my request for information in the matter of the
breeding of the Accentor in captivity, I have received a most interesting
letter from our member, Mr. H. Wormald. Mr. Wormald tells me that last
summer he turned ten Accentors into his Waders' Aviary (10 yds. x 8 yds.
X 8ft. high) and from these he had nine nests and reared three young birds
---the remainder being killed.
No insect food was supplied.
I think there can be very little doubt that this is an easy species to
breed and probably success has been frequently achieved.

Correspondence.
Mr. Wormald also noticed the tendency of this species to become
bald, but attributed it at the time to his birds having struck the netting
when alarmed by Owls at night.
I am glad to hear that at least one member thinks well of my sug-
gestion that there is much to be accomplished in the way of breeding
indigenous species and that the latter are no whit less interesting than
foreigners.
Altogether, Mr. Wormald's letter with some account of his Waders
and some excellent sketches of the display of the Ruff has interested me
greatly. W. E. TeSChemakkr.
The following proof of the previous breeding of the Hedge-Accentor
in captivity appeared in Canary and Cage Bird Life for January 17th : --
In " Here and There" you ask, Have Dunnocks or Hedge Sparrows
been bred in captivity ? Well, I know of one instance. About 1894 or 1S95,
there lived 011 Unsworth Moor, near Darlington, a man named Brown, who
was a retainer in some capacity to the Unsworth Moor branch of the Pease
family. A pair of Dunnocks had their nest in the quicksets by his cottage,
and the hen was so deep sitting that she would let you pick her off. Brown
had a large all-wire ferret hutch, and into this he put branch, nest, and hen,
and the same day he caught the cock by the simple expedient of rolling up
strips of the " sticky " paper flycatcher, and thus liming him. The hen did
not budge from her eggs after being taken from Brown's pocket and gently
put on to them. The cock hopped about the improvised aviary quite con-
tentedly, and later the brood was hatched, and when old enough all the lot,
seven birds, including the old birds, were let free one fine autumn day.
The youngsters grew quite strong and big. The old ones did not attempt
to make a second nest, and all the time they were in durance they were fed
on birdcage refuse, and duck food, the latter made from meal of some kind
and boiled potatoes, and caterpillars from the nasturtiums and other plants
in the garden. Brown had a stud of blue Canary Lizards of a deep smoke-
blue colour--the only birds of this kind I ever have seen ; and from the
gleanings amongst the waste from the cages of these birds, it is possible
the Dunnocks were able to pick up quite a goodly proportion of seeds.
They always looked well, anyhow.-- Edward Wirriams.

Sir,--T hose who may prefer to have a wrinkle gratis, to buying their

Take dried fig and pour boiling water over it. Do the same with bun :
strain the bun. Take the fig and mash it up with double the quantity of
soaked bun.

They will find this will keep Eos and Lorius in perfect health.
I have never had Clialcopsittacus or Dasyptilus or Charmosyna, but I
see no reason why it should not succeed with them.
I have never found milk suit any parrot lexcept Macaws: but I
believe Mr. Goodfellow brought over lories on tinned milk.
I admit that the food I recommend makes them dirty birds to keep,
and I should prefer to feed them 011 seed, if it suited them.
I have no doubt that seed is the best for Blue Mountain Lories, and
if so, I do not see why it should not be best for the other species of
Trichoglossus. F. G. Dutton.

SEPOY FINCH EATING ITS YOUNG.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989101741935484" page_id="32669073"  page_num="Page 137" year="" vol="">
Sir, --My Sepoy finches ( Bird Notes, volume V., May 1906) nested
and hatched out two or three. You can judge of my horror when, passing
the aviary one morning, I saw the hen with something in its beak that
looked like a young bird and which she was deliberately pecking and
eating, evidently enjoying it.
I examined what was left of the poor little finch ; it was only a few
days out of the shell. Is not this unusual ?
Plenty of mealworms, dried [flies and ants' egg were placed in the
aviary every morning. What would you advise as a preventive next time if
I have any luck ?
The cock birds appear rather delicate when changing colour.
C. Castur-Suoane.
I was unable to suggest a remedy for this cannibalism, which appears
in one form or another in many species. Carpodacus with its fugitive rose-
red colouring is probably more nearly related to Lbiota and Serinus than
to Pyrrhula. The call-note of C. roseus is certainly remarkably like that of
the domesticated Canary.
When I used to breed Canaries, on more than one occasion I have
known the hens to eat their young when two or three days old. Cardinalis
also has been known to brain its young and throw the bodies out of the
nest.
Many years ago an account was published in the Zoologist of a
Missel Thrush which partl\ r fed its nestlings upon the new-born bodies of
Song-Thrushes which it first picked to pieces, and Princess Croy, who bred
the Scarlet Tanager at Hainaut, Belgium, notes that the parent birds partly
fed their young upon the bodies of newly-hatched Wagtails. I have also
recorded the fact that Manyali Weavers and Pekin Nightingales both took
toll of my young Saffron-finches, though the latter more often ate the eggs
than the young.
Of course we can all suggest that insufficient insect-food is the cause
of this unnatural behaviour on the part of Finches ; but is it ? It is by no

means a rare occurrence for lien Canaries to bite off and eat the wings and
feet of tlieir naked young, and Canaries are not great insect-eaters ; even in
their wild state it is probable that they only eat small caterpillars and
aphides.
The question to my mind is whether the Sepoy-finclies may not have
required earthworms to help them in feeding their young. I noticed that
my Pine Grosbeaks ate worms with eagerness and avidity, and although it
may seem odd that finches should eat these slimy things, it must be
remembered that doves also, which one would not naturally credit with
such a tendency, are equally eager for them. A. G. BUTLER.

THE EGYPTIAN PLOVER.
Pluvianus egyptius.
ITS NAME, DISTRIBUTION, KNOWN AND REPUTED
HABITS.
By Capt. Stanley S. Flower.
The beautiful bird whose photograph by W. S. Berridge is
published in this number of the Avicultural Magazine was first
made known to science by the energetic young Swedish naturalist,
Frederick Hasselquist, who visited Egypt from May 1750 to
March 1751. Travelling in Egypt in those times was neither
easy or pleasant. Poor Hasselquist had the greatest difficulties
to contend with, he said it was like doing penance for crimes,
and on his return journey, after along illness, he died at Smyrna,
9th February, 1752, when only thirty years of age. His former
instructor, the great Linnaeus, published Hasselquist's Iter
Palestinian, in 1757, and in this work and his later Syst. Nature,
gave the bird the names Charadrius egyptius for egypticusj.
Vieillot proposed the generic name Pluvianus in 1816, and,
though some authors have used other names, the bird is now
almost universally called Pluvianus egyptius (Linnaeus).
In English it is called the Egyptian Plover, the Black-
backed Courser, the Rain Plover, the Crocodile Bird or the
Black-headed Plover, which last name was applied to the bird by
Latham, as long ago as 1785.
Buffon called it " Le Pluvian," in 1781, and its modern
French appellation is " Le Pluvian d'Egypte."
In German it is called " Der Krokodilwachter."

Various authors state that it is called in Arabic " Ter el
temsach," or " Crocodile Bird ; " this is probably a translation
into Arabic at European suggestion, and not a name of genuine
native origin.
Essentially an African bird, the Egyptian Plover is found
from Angola to Senegambia in the West and along the Nile
valley in the East; it has also occured in Palestine and other
Mediterranean countries, aud is said to have strayed as far North
as Sweden.
According to all authorities, the Egyptian Plover is
common in Egypt from the Delta southwards ; in the latest book
on Egyptian birds, Lady William Cecil's Bird Notes from the
Nile, (1904) page 86, this species is said to be "Very common,
specially in Upper Egypt." That it does occur in Egypt is
amply proved by specimens in many collections,* but it appears
to be not so very common nowadays ; in nine years residence in
the Nile valley I have never seen this bird in Egypt, though I
know it well in the Sudan, and Mr. M. J. Nicoll tells me he has
never seen it in the sixteen months he has spent in Egypt.
The most Northerly point I have met the Egyptian Plover
at, is Abu Hamed, from there past Berber, Atbara, Shendi aud
the Shablulca gorge to Khartoum, I have seen it all along the
Nile, and as far South as the sudd-county of the Bahr-el-Gebel
and South-West at lake Ambadi in the Bahr-el-Ghazal, but it
is on the Blue Nile that I have found it most numerous. Three
times : once in the beginning of the rainy season, Juue-July;
once near the end of the rains, September; aud once in winter,
November-December ; I have been along the Blue Nile from
Khartoum to Roseires (about 380 miles) aud back, aud at each
season of the year have all along this stretch of river, daily seen
Pluvianus cegyptius in large numbers, on banks and islands, flock
after flock, sometimes I have counted forty to sixty Egyptian
Plovers in one flock; although often seen alone, they more
frequently congregate in flocks with the Spur-winged Plover,
Hoplopterus spinosus, aud also with the Stone-Curlew or Thick-
knee, CEdicnemus senegalensis.
* My father, the late Sir William Flower, collected specimens opposite Gebel
Abufayda, 27th January, aud near Sohag-, 3rd and 4U1 February, 1874.

Seebolim in his Geographical Distribution of the Charadriidce
(1887) page 248, under Variations, writes:--"Examples from
West Africa appear to be slightly smaller than those from Egypt,
the former varying in length of wing from 5^0 to 5 - i inches, and
the latter from 5-2 to 5^5 inches." I do not know if this
difference has been corroborated by later authors : the only skin

Both in colour and markings, the Egyptian Plover is, to
my mind, one of the most charming of birds, a combination of
a most beautiful pale, clear, bluish-grey on the upper surfaces
and a lovely shade of buff on the lower, with strongly defined
intense black and pure white on the head, neck, back, wing
quills and end of tail feathers. The black band which divides
the neck from the body is very well shown in Mr. Berridge's
photograph. The white line 011 each side of the head which
passes over the eye is continued into long, hanging, white
plumes on the neck, these " ear-tufts " are reminiscent of
those of the Demoiselle Crane in miniature, but in the Plover
they meet on the back of the neck. The bill is black, except
for a pale grey spot below the base of the lower mandible
(clearly shown in the photograph). The legs are bluish-grey.
Elegance and daintiness characterize the Egyptian Plover in
colour, form and movements.
Its favourite haunts are the banks and islands of the river,
whether these be of sand, mud or rocks I have seen it almost
equally abundant. It usually flies very low over the surface of the
water, crying shrilly as it flies. Its cry has been rendered " tscliip,
tschip, troi&amp;apos;t." It is an extremely tame and confiding bird. Mr.
A. E. Butler in his excellent paper on "The Ornithology of the
Egyptian Soudan," published in The Ibis for July, 1905, writes of
the Egyptian Plover : " Though very seldom leaving the margin
of the river, it will sometimes take to frequenting a native village
a few hundred yards inland. It then becomes more than usually
fearless, tripping about the spaces and 'zaribas' among the
tethered goats, or standing on the roofs of the mud-buildings
within a few feet of a passer by." I have also noticed this, and
*seen Egyptian Plovers feeding among domestic poultry in the

yard of the guard house near the Atbara bridge, and as little dis-
turbed by one's walking among them as were the " barn-door"
cocks and hens.
Von Heugliu in his account of the Egyptian Plover " Orni-
thologie Nordost-Afrika's " (1873) page 976, apparently doubts
the usually accepted opinion that this bird buries its eggs in the
sand and says that he himself always found them lying free, but
Seebohm " Geogr. Distr. Charadriidse" (1887) pages 250-251,.
confirms the account of Brehni by the very interesting observa-
tions of Captain Verner and Lieutenant G. Verner made in the
Sudan, during the Nile Expedition of 18S4-1885, making it an
established fact that this bird does bury her eggs. Which has
again been substantiated by A. L. Butler in his recent paper re-
ferred to above, whose account should be read by all interested
in the subject. And Mr. W. G. Percival in the Avicultural
Magazine , July 1906, page 297, records finding " a three-parts-
grown " Egyptian Plover hidden under about a quarter-of-au-
iucli of sand on an islet at the mouth of the Atbara River.
It should be noted that while Heugliu gives the number
of eggs in a clutch as two, which was the number found by
Butler, Captain Verner twice found three eggs in a clutch.
The Egyptian Plover is perhaps most widely known from
its reputed habits which have given it the name of the Crocodile
Bird. The old story as given by Herodotus is that the crocodile
" has the inside of its mouth constantly covered with insects that
suck its blood ; all other beasts and birds avoid it: while with the
Trochilus alone it lives at peace, because this little bird renders it
a great service ; for the crocodile when it leaves the water and
comes out upon the land is in the habit of lying with its mouth
open facing the western breeze ; at such times the Trochilus goes
into the crocodle's mouth and devours the insects it finds there,
and the crocodile, recognising this, does the bird no harm."
While Pliny writes " When the crocodile has eaten it goes to
sleep on the banks, when a little bird, known in Egypt as the
Trochilus, and in Italy as the king of birds, in order to obtain
food, invites the crocodile to open its jaws, then, hopping to and
fro, it first cleans the outside of its mouth, next the teeth, and
then inside, when the crocodile opens its jaws as wide as

possible, on account of the pleasure it experiences from the
titillation. It is at these moments that the ichneumon darts
down its throat and eats its way out through its belly."
Two questions must be considered : first, does any bird
really do such a thing ? Second, is the " Trochilus " the bird
now known as the Egyptian Plover.
I11 Newton's " Dictionary of Birds," (1894), P a S e 733 &amp;gt; a
foot-note is given to this subject ; the first question Newton
seems to have taken for granted, and as to the second after
stating that various authors identify the Spur-winged Plover
Hoplopterus spinosus as the true " Crocodile Bird " he considers
that " the balance of scientific opinion is sufficiently declared" in
favour of Pluvianus cegyptius.
In Anderson's " Zoology of Egypt, Vol. I., Reptilia and
Batrachia," (1898) the subject is fully gone into on pages iS to 23,
and the literature bearing 011 it from the earliest times quoted.
Anderson clearly proves that the bird identified by GeofFroy St.
Hilaire as Hasselquist's Charadrius cegyptius was not our Egyptian
Plover, but was probably the Little-ringed Plover Aegialitis
curonica.
Personally I have carefully watched many hundred Nile
crocodiles, small, medium, and large-sized, basking on shore, I
have seen many birds, Herons, Storks, Ibises, Spoonbills, Geese,
Ducks, Plovers, and Wagtails, close to and among the sleeping
reptiles, but never yet have seen a bird try to enter a crocodile's
mouth or pick food from it. It may possibly occur, but from my
knowledge of the habits of reptiles I would agree with Dr.
Anderson that a crocodile would not refrain from closing its jaws
on a bird that entered its mouth, even out of consideration for
any service the bird might be rendering it by catching vermin or
cleaning its teeth, and as Anderson writes, "The probability is
that if any particular species of bird has the habit, many an
individual has lost its life by so doing." It is highly improbable
that a bird would come out alive from the once closed mouth of a
crocodile, and as it could not feed inside when the crocodile's
mouth was shut the raison d&amp;apos;etre of the manoeuvre popularly
believed in is hard to follow.
It should be noted that A. L. Butler in his paper referred

winged Plovers, Hoplopterus spinosus, " pecking something from
a basking crocodile's head."
O11 whether the subject of this article was known to the
ancient Egyptians I am not qualified to write, I do not remember
having so far seen it represented in their paintings. As the
opinion of the late Dr. Anderson on this point is recorded in his
volume on Reptiles it may have escaped the notice of many
ornithologists, so may well be quoted here.
"Brelim, Heuglin, Dresser, and others have said that
Pluvianus cegyptius is U in the hieroglyphic alphabet of the
Egyptians, and it is even stated that the Egyptians of old were
well acquainted with it, and that it frequently occurs on wall-
paintings. I have gone carefully through the literature bearing
on the wall-paintings of Egypt, but I have not been able to find a
single representation' of Plwviamis (Zgyptius. The TJ of the
alphabet is unquestionably a newly-fledged domestic chicken, a
most important bird with the Egyptians, who, as now, largely if
not exclusively brought all their poultry to .life by artificial incu-
bation. The wings devoid of quills, the absence of tail-feathers,
and the generally imperfect character of the feathering of the
bird of the hieroglyph U are all distinctive of a bird that has
left the egg. By some Egyptologists I believe the figure has
been taken for a quail."

The other inmates of this aviary are a pair of Bronze-
necked Doves and what I hope are a pair of rare Black-bearded
Doves; there is also a tiny " Francisian " Dove from South
America, a pretty little thing about the size of a Passerine.
The Bronze-necked cock was sent to me with a hen from
Australia. They were most unsuitably packed. The two
Bronze-necked, a large Black and White Fruit Pigeon and a
Blue-bonnet Parrakeet all being sent together in one small box-
cage, only about 17 inches square.

Of course, the result was that the Brouze-uecked, being
the weakest, suffered, and had it not been for the kindness and
sense shown by the ship's butcher (who had charge of the birds)
I should have lost the Bronze-necked Doves altogether. He
separated the birds on the voyage, but, in the case of the hen
Bronze-necked, it was too late. When she arrived, I found she
had sustained a most terrible injury, the eye and right side of
the face was entirely gone, just as if it had been sliced off. The
bird could still get about, but the wound, which seemed to
have healed once, broke out afresh. I think the brain was
affected, and after lingering for a time, the poor thing died. The
cock, too, had not escaped uninjured for he had a wound over one
eye, and the place even now after many months is still there, and
never really goes, although the bird seems healthy and strong.
Their ill-fortune seemed to pursue the poor Bronze-necks; for
the cock a short time after he came to me, had the misfortune
to get his leg broken by a small Cactus Couure. The whole
thing was really a misunderstanding, the Conure settled near
the Dove, who, thinking it was going to be attacked, raised one
wing high above its head, as Doves will when on the defensive.
The Conure seeing the raised wing, and thinking it meant
mischief, thought that at any rate he would get the first blow in,
so snapped at the Dove&amp;apos;s leg and broke it right up the thigh,
leaving the leg dangling and only held by a piece of skin.
The groom (who looked after the aviaries) held the bird
whilst I bound up its leg, using a wooden match for a splint,
with some cotton wool, tape and thread. After a time, the leg
set, and now is quite strong again, but unfortunately I did not
set it quite straight and in consequence the leg sticks out a
little. After the death of the hen, the cock grew very miserable,
and used to sit huddled up on a perch taking no interest in
anything. Some time after, I managed to secure another hen,
and the joy of the poor lonely bird was a pleasure to see. The
change in him when he saw the little hen was just magical.
Before he saw her he had looked the picture of woe, now, in a
moment, he was transformed and commenced bowing and cooing
with delight. The love, however, is nearly all on his side, the
hen puts up with him, but little more. I think mj^self she is

rather disappointed at coming right across England only to find
a lame husband, and further the defect over his eye quite spoils
the beauty 011 that side of his face, and he cannot always turn
the perfect side towards her. The cock is really not hand-
some enough to suit her taste, but he does not at all realize
this. He is beginning to be anxious to nest and is becoming
rather a nuisance to the other inmates of the aviary, especially
to the Black-bearded Doves who are too lazy and fat to resent
him. The cock Bronze-necked goes into a nest basket and
coos, then the hen taking no notice, he descends and starts
bowing and cooing, spreading his tail in an upright fan and
bobbing up and down, to the astonished Black-bearded Doves,
the hen Bronze-necked meanwhile seeming quite indifferent.
The Black-bearded Doves are very handsome birds, and I
have never seen any like them. Three specimens were sent to
me privately a few years ago by a gentleman living in Jamaica.
They were fairly common there though almost unknown in
England, but the terrible earthquake destroyed so much bird
life that, for anything I know to the contrary, these Doves
may be rare now in their native land. I11 shape the Black-
bearded are rather larger and heavier than a Bleeding-heart
Pigeon. They are strong looking birds, and keep much on the
floor of the aviary ; though they seem lazy by nature and do
not move about much. My third bird, who died, got very
thickened legs (almost like scaled legs in fowls), and Mr.
Newman made the suggestion to me that possibly it was caused
by the birds not having grass to walk 011, and the aviary tiled
floor being too hard. I took his advice and turned the remain-
ing two doves into another aviary with a grass flight, and here
their legs became wonderfully improved, and further, one bird
that had moulted out a lot of white feathers (instead of maroon
as they should have been) gradually lost all this, and became its
proper colour again. The whole of the body of these doves is a
rich brown maroon becoming lighter on the breast, the top
part of the head (like a cap) being bright cobalt blue. The face
is sharply lined with white rather like a cock Californian Quail,
and under the chin is a beautiful bib of dark blue metallic
feathers from which I suppose the bird gets its name. The beak

is pale grey at the tip. but scarlet near the face, and it is this
little bit of bright red against the blue cap that makes the bird
look so striking. I believe the two birds I have left are a true pair,
for one is larger and bolder looking than the other, but they are
so solemn and self-contained it is hard to say. One--the larger
one--coos, so he is evidently a cock bird, but the sex of the other
I cannot be quite certain of. I believe in Jamaica these birds
laid on the ground (they had been kept in an aviary) but with
me they have never laid at all. I have tried them now one or two
seasons with no success under different conditions, but I live in
hope I shall some day find out what they really want. Last
season I put them in a low duck house with a wire run in front
filled with long rank grass, and this I partially screened over to
give them a quiet corner in which I hoped they would nest.
Further, I put a sod of grass in the shut-off shelter in the duck
house. But all my hopes came to nothing, and I had the further
disappointment that in moving out the birds to their winter
quarter (for they are not quite hardy) I let one escape. It flew
right away with a strong and swift flight and I gave it up for
lost. I went down to the police station and saw about some
handbills offering a reward being got out, for once before I got a
lost bird back by advertising; and then I ran the remaining dove
into the wire-fronted duck house and having fastened it off, so
that it could not get out but would act as a decoy, I left the door
of the flight open and put a pot of food just inside. Next morn-
ing the lost bird came back of its own accord, and it was so
hungry and so pleased to see its mate that it was easily captured
with some grain placed in a trap cage. I was very glad to get
the bird back for, apart from its rarity, it might have died of cold
or hunger or might have been shot, and I could not have easily
replaced it, and keeping an odd bird is not very satisfactory.
I11 the larger half of this heated aviary there is little, if any-
thing of special interest to tell you of, save six Bleeding Heart
Pigeons. I have a great weakness for these quaint doves, with
their slate-grey bodies, the wings barred by a deeper shade, and
iridescent neck of purple opal, white breasts, and a bright red
blood splash in the centre that gives the bird its name. Bleeding
Hearts love each other's society and the little flock of six keep

altogether, and a very pretty picture they make. I have never seen
two Bleeding Hearts quite, alike, they may look so to a casual ob-
server, but to an owner they are each a little different; just as they
say no two sheep in a flock are alike. In one bird the "heart"
will be a little larger, in another perhaps smaller, a third bird has
longer legs, in a fourth the grey on each side of the breast nearly
meets at the throat. Bleeding Hearts are very restless birds
keeping on the ground and walking to and fro perpetually ; they
seldom go into the branches save to roost at night. When the
cocks coo they throw themselves right back, almost resting on
the tail, and puff out the breast and " heart " to quite an imposing
size. It is a study in itself to see the different attitudes doves
assume when cooing. If you watch them you will notice they
always display the gayest part of their plumage. One will bare
the head to show the neck, another spread the tail and wings
fan shape, or, again, lean backwards like the Bleeding Heart.
These doves get very tame if coaxed with some special tit-bit,
and I believe would soon learn to feed out of one's hand. They
are especially fond of meal worms (though many are not good for
them) and, like most of my doves, like ground biscuit and ground
monkey nuts. I have bred the Bleeding Heart before now and
the young ones are very pretty little things : soft chocolate brown
in colour, with buff bars across the wings and just a tiny red line
down the breast to show you where the "heart" is coming by-
and-bye. To be successful in breeding Bleeding Hearts you
must only put one pair in each house. They live happily to-
gether in numbers, but when more than two are in an aviary
they seem to lose the desire to start nesting seriously.
Besides these doves I have a quantity of little birds in this
aviary, but nothing of special interest, except perhaps a little
Cactus Conure, whose quaint postures and grimaces always
amuse visitors. He will eat from my hand, but is rather lonely,
for he had two companions and these are both dead, and the}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
were a most devoted trio. "Jock," the remaining bird, is always
demanding attention, and if he can get anyone to talk to him and
notice him he is wild with delight, but he is rather treacherous
and will bite your finger quite as readily as he will take your
biscuit. As a rule his temper is merely show, but once or twice

the inhabitants of my two other aviaries I must tell you another
day.
(To be continued).
THE TROPICAL SEED-FINCH.
Oryzoborus tor rid us.
A specimen of this rare little finch was sent to me by Mr.
E. W. Harper on November 28th, 1907. It is of about the same
size as the Black-headed Mannikin; and, looking at it from
below, one might almost fancy that it was a near relative of that
species, but the generally silky black colouring of the upper
surface with white speculum and bend of wing do not bear out
the illusion.
Although rarely imported this bird has been represented
in the London Zoological Society's collection since 1S60, but in
Germany it has only occasionally appeared singly or in pairs in
the market.
Dr. Russ, who apparently never possessed the species him-
self, observes that it has not yet been bred, and altogether he
regards it as not particularly interesting; I notice that he very
frequently says this respecting birds of which he has had no
personal experience. He tells us that Mr. von Schlechtendal,
who obtained two pairs from the dealer Moller, writes that " they
are quiet, peaceful little birds. They despise mealworms, green
food and fruit, feed solely upon all kinds of seed, and live entirely
without song or sound." He says that when removing a sickly
specimen to another cage it bit him painfull}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with its powerful
pointed beak.
Mr. Harper tells me that this account is not correct; as
both O. torridus and O. crassirostris eat lettuce, and the latter at
any rate, eats mealworms, or that is his impression. When I
removed it from the travelling cage in which it reached me, to
transfer it to the flight-cage in which it now is, it never attempted
to bite me ; but perhaps Mr. Schlechtendal handled his bird a
trifle roughly and it naturally retaliated.

Whether this bird is really mute, I cannot at present say
definitely, as I have three Spermophilce with it; but the day after
it reached me I heard what I believed to be the Tropical Seed-
Finch utter a note which sounded like zvhit zizi: I never yet
heard any Spennophila produce a note of the kind to my know-
ledge. That it is quiet and peaceful in a flight-cage is certainly
true; but whether a pair in a good-sized aviary would be equally
amiable remains to be proved.
Little seems to have been recorded respecting the wild life
of O. torridus ; Burmeister says that it is more at home 011 open
commons than in the vicinity of forest, and that is about all that
appears to be definitely known of the species in freedom ; but
the much larger O. crassirostris builds in low bushes, forming its
nest of coarse grass-stems, with a lining of finer grass; it lays
two eggs, possibly more at times, of a mottled greyish-brown
colour blotched with Jilacine grey and irregularly blotched and
streaked with dark red-brown. It is not improbable that O.
torridus would resemble the larger species somewhat in its nidi-
fication.
Dr. Sharpe places Oryzobotus among the Grosbeaks be-
tween Guiraca and Loxigalla; but Professor Ridgwav says of
Oryzobonts and some others " they are ' grosbeaks' " so far as the
large size of the bill is concerned, though not otherwise, for
there is very great difference in the form of the beak between
such genera as Phetidicus , Zamelodia, Gcospiza , Oryzobonts, Car-
dinalis, etc., and that of Hesperiphona, Coccothraustes , etc., not to
mention radical differences in other respects. He defines no Sub-
families, but places Oryzoborus between Cyanocompsa and Guiraca.
Both of these leading Systematists therefore seem to agree
that Oryzoborus is related to Guiraca, though O. toirida with its
prominent white speculum and its modest colouring, as well as
in the general outline of head and beak seems nearly to approach
Sporophila {Spennophila of the Museum Catalogue). Cyanocompsa
is a genus proposed by Cabanis for Cyanoloxia parellina (Guiraca
parellina of Sclater) and includes several species referred by
Dr. Sharpe to Gztiraca ; so that, according to Ridgwav Oryzobonts
must be very nearly related indeed to the Guiraca (Bine Gros-
beaks) of the Museum Catalogue.

I should be glad if other members of our Society who have
kept Oryzoborus could give us some definite information respect-
ing its behaviour in captivity, whether it really is destitute of
both call-note and song and whether it does despise mealworms
or other insects. It seems inconceivable that any finch should
be entirely non-insectivorous: I believe that even those Grass-
finches which feed upon seed only in their normal condition, eat
aphides when rearing their young--if they can get them.

By Dr. A. G. Buti/er.
The theory of protective assimilation is doubtless well
known to the more scientific members of our Society; but, for
the benefit of those not acquainted with it, I may briefly sum-
marize it as follows :--
It is believed that some animals owe their very existence
to the fact that, at some stage of their development, they pro-
duced certain varieties which tended to resemble more favoured
species ; that is to say, species which were powerful enough to
defend themselves, were immune from destruction because of
their offensive odour, or some other unpleasantness; or to the
fact that their form or colouring rendered them difficult to dis-
tinguish from their surroundings. This tendency in the desired
direction having been, to a slight extent, protective, some of
these slight variations survived to perpetuate the new type, which
gradually improved in its resemblance until eventually it became
almost perfect: the harmless and tasty creature was passed over
in mistake for the dangerous and offensive one, or because of its
close resemblance to its natural surroundings.
That the truth of this state of things is borne out in many
instances throughout the animal kingdom cannot be questioned :
one of the most striking instances of environmental protection
being seen in the case of the Weavers of the genus Pyromelana y
the females of which are always protected by their Sedge-
Warbler-like colouring, rendering them inconspicuous among
reeds or coarse grasses, while the male only assumes his mar-
vellously showy dress during the breeding-season, at a time when.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
lie is extremely combative and aggressive ; and reassumes the
sober protective dress immediately afterwards.
It is an amusing sight to watch the assurance with which
a male of Pyromelana oryx when in full colour will puff out all
its fiery orange feathers and dash at a bird of ten or twenty times
its own weight, driving it in terror from pillar to post: after its
moult, however, P. oryx is quite subdued ; or, if at times it struts
up to a bigger bird for a moment, the latter only has to stand its
ground and open its mouth to reduce it immediately to subjection.
Many instances of resemblance between powerful and
weakly birds have been recorded by Dr. A. R. Wallace; one of
the most curious perhaps being that of a Sparrow-hawk {Accipiter
pileatus) which, in Rio Janeiro assumes the plumage of a local
hawk (Harpagzcs diodoii) of insectivorous habits, with the advan-
tage to itself of seeming harmless to the small birds upon which
it feeds, and thus approaching to within striking distance.
Numerous ground-frequenting birds are so coloured upon
the upper parts that they resemble the surrounding surface upon
which they walk, many of them however are most brilliantly
coloured on the under parts and seem to be aware of the danger
to themselves which would arise if this conspicuous colouring
were revealed to an enemy ; inasmuch as, at the slightest alarm,
they crouch down and do their utmost to conceal it.
A very good instance of this is to be seen in the Military
Starlings of South America with their black-streaked brown
upper parts, and mostly scarlet under parts. When alarmed they
crouch close to the ground with the breast and throat pitched
forward so as to conceal the scarlet as much as possible. Hudson
tells us that Defilippi's Military Starling when migrating south-
wards at the approach of the cold season moves over the ground
in a vast flock, consisting of from four or five hundred to a
thousand individuals, and suggests the idea of a disciplined army
on its march. One would have supposed that this would have
been the time when they would be most liable to the attacks of
birds of prey, but possibly they might unitedly attack an enemy,
and then their long bills attacking from all sides would scare
him away.
The Military Starlings appear to be extremely common

birds, and oddly enough they are exactly copied, not only in the
colouring of both surfaces, but in some of their habits by the
species of the genus Leistes (Marsh-Troupials). So close is the
resemblance between Leistes snperciliaris and Trupialis deplibpii ,
that, if it were not for the shorter broader finch-like beak of the
former, it might almost be mistaken for the Military Starling.
Both birds crouch in the same manner when alarmed, and fly
recklessly and irregularly upwards, singing their fearful song,
when courting.
Now what has often puzzled me is to discover what possible
advantage the Red-breasted Marsh Troupial can gain by its
resemblance to Defillipi's Starling: I can discover none what-
ever. Moreover, if there be an advantage and we assume that
Leistes guianensis, in like manner, formerly copied the colouring
of Trupialis bellicosa ; why is it that these two birds now inhabit
different regions ? Is not this of itself a proof that they can get
along perfectly well independently of each other? If so, why
are the species of Leistes so like the species of Trupialis ? It is
not only in birds that cases of this kind occur ; for, among butter-
flies also, whole series of related genera can be arranged in
parallel rows of species each resembling the other in colouring;
none of them apparently needing to resemble the others, because
all are alike noxious and distasteful to insectivorous animals.*
It has been suggested that the resemblance of many genera
to each other impresses their objectionable character more forcibly
upon their enemies, and thus they are less liable to be maimed by
young and inexperienced creatures seizing them ; that one suffers
for the many, and so the latter escape unharmed : a view which
has always seemed to me far-fetched and improbable, when one
observes the exactness with which all the patterns in a genus are
repeated in half a dozen others, as well as in other unrelated,
palatable, and palpably mimicking genera.
Surely it is more reasonable to suppose that colouring is
developed in certain fixed directions and that, when not injurious
to an animal, it may be retained long after the structure has
been modified ; and the tendency to variation in the same lines
may, in like manner, be retained.

On Red-breasted Starlings, etc.
In spite of the total dissimilarity of their bills, it is evident
that Ridgway regards Trzipialis and Leistes as still nearly related ;
if so their divergence from a common ancestor may have been
comparatively recent in the unthinkable ages of avian evolution ;
and I see no more difficulty in the retention of a certain type of
colouring for a million years than for ten thousand, provided that
it is suited to the conditions of its wearer.
I feel certain that many supposed instances of what has
been called mimicry are nothing more than inherited resem-
blances between genera which had a common origin, some of
which like Trupialis and Leistes have inherited also certain
similarities in habits.
Nature has not a free hand in the development of colour,
although her resources seem to be unlimited : for instance, one
cannot believe it possible for a blue species to be developed direct
from a yellow; I believe the colouring must either pass through
the black stage, or else be gradually modified from yellow through
orange, crimson and purple as in the rainbow. We constantly
find tawny, black and yellow in a single individual; blue, black,
green and yellow; tawny, black and crimson, and so on; but
in a single instance which I recall in which yellowish-white,
bluish grey and blood red species occur in one genus, there is
some trace of black remaining, and a smoky brown type in a
transition stage between the dissimilar colours: I think it is
true in this respect, if not in all, that Natura non facit saltum.
As black is a combination of all colours, we may conclude that
it is capable of producing them all : on the other hand white,
being the absence of colour, should be capable of producing
none. When therefore white changes to yellow, we must con-
clude that it reverts to a previous condition. Blue seems to be
the first colour produced from black, and when one sees a pale
blue belt in conjunction with a white one, there is pretty certain to
be black close to it, and often at the extremities of the blue belt.
But I fear I am wandering somewhat from my point, which was
to show that similar types of colouring are to be expected in
related forms, inasmuch as Nature works most smoothly in the
direction of the least resistance.

BRITISH BIRDS.
The February number of British Birds includes an illustra-
ted paper by Mr. Ogilvie-Grant "On two supposed hybrids
between Red Grouse and Ptarmigan, the first were killed at
Kinloch Rannoch, Perthshire, in September, 1907, the second on
Malundy, 3,293 ft., Monar Forest, Ross-shire, in November, 1874.
Next comes an article entitled " Notes on the habits and dis-
tribution of the Cirl Bunting, in North Wales," by S. G.
Cummings ; Messrs. Witlierby and Ticehurst continue their
valuable paper 011 the more important additions to our knowledge
of British Birds since 1S99; Commander H. Lynes, R.N.,
describes " An incident in the southward migration of the
Swallow" ; various notes and letters follow, and the number con-
cludes with a critique (it is hardly correct to call it a review) of
Mr. Bonhote's " Birds of Britain."
Messrs. Witlierby and Co. announce the approaching
publication of a book by Mr. M. J. Nicoll, giving an account, of
three long voyages on the Earl of Crawford's yacht " Valhalla."
The author, who is a well-known ornithologist, describes
the bird and other animal life of many islands seldom or never
previously explored.
The collections made by Mr. Nicoll during the voyages
have been presented by Ford Crawford to the Natural History
Museum, of which his lordship is one of the trustees.
The book will be fully illustrated from photographs taken
during the voyages.

We have received from Messrs. Trower, the well-known
Bird-food Specialists of the Caledonian Road, London, a very
useful little sixpenny pamphlet entitled "The Bird-Keeper's
Guide": by Allen Silver and T. R. Trower.
The object of this treatise is to provide the beginner in the
study of bird-life with a handy and concise text-book for refer-
ence ; so that whenever he becomes the possessor of a bird he
may learn therefrom the type of cage most suitable to its require-
ments, the best food for it, its merits as a songster or exhibition
bird, whether it is most satisfactory when hand-reared or caught
wild.
Both trivial and scientific names are given, as well as the
habitat of each species. The different items of information are
arranged in parallel columns.
In the case of the foreign birds the scientific names not
infrequently and the popular names occasionally are not quite
correct: the Slender-billed Cockatoo being called " Nosicus ! "
a name probably given in jest by some humorous dealer as a
translation of the name nasiejis, though nasica is more correct.
The nosy appearance of the bird seems to have struck Latham,
as of course it did the author of the scientific name*
Mr. Silver has had a good deal of experience in keeping
British birds and has also kept a few foreign species; he has not
however relied solely upon this, but has been more or less guided
by the opinion of others : the consequence is that this little
pamphlet is remarkably trustworthy.

WOOD-PIGEON DIPHTHERIA.

<bodyText confidence="0.999412666666667" page_id="32669101"  page_num="Page 157" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Much public interest has been shown lately in the disease of
which Wood-pigeons have been dying so freely this winter.
. The subject is of considerable scientific interest; moreover it is quite
possible, although it has not yet been absolutely proved, that this disease,
which is most infectious amongst Wood-pigeons themselves, may also be
contracted by other birds and especially game-birds.
It is of great importance therefore to find a means of stamping out
the diphtheria. Before however any effective means can be taken to
eradicate the disease it is necessary to discover its origin.
To the January issue of the monthly magazine British Birds, Dr.
C. B. Ticehurst, of Guys Hospital, contributed an article on the subject of
Wood-pigeon Diphtheria, and explained that it was due to a specific micro-
organism called Bacillus diptlierise colum barum. At the same time Dr.
Ticehurst points out that the Etiology of the disease is most incomplete and
that much has to be learnt as to how it originates, and when it comes, and
as to its distribution before we can suggest a remedy&amp;apos;.
It is one of the aims of British Bitds to induce co-operative observa-
tion on subjects such as the nature of the food of birds, etc., our knowledge
of which can be little advanced by observations made at different times and
under different systems. The Wood-pigeon disease forms an excellent case
for a systematic enquiry all over the country, and schedules of the questions
to be answered have been posted to all the readers of British Birds.
We have thus received much information and many specimens, but
more of both are needed, and I should be delighted to supply schedules to

any of your readers who may be in a position to give information on the

who will draw up a full report at a later date.

THE RECENT CRYSTAL PALACE SHOW.
I was unable to attend the recent Show, but Mr. Goodcliild writes
that the rarest exhibit was, probably, Mr. Astlev's Parrot which was in
beautiful condition and very tame.
Two male King Birds of Paradise were exhibited, but neither was
in show condition, the ' wires' being broken off entirely in one and damaged
in the other. Mr. Maxwell exhibited his Sun-bird, the same one that was
at the Horticultural Hall; but on the second da}&amp;apos; it was unwell and had to
be removed. No less than four Great Grey Shrikes were shown; one of
them being a charmingly tame specimen : it received six special prizes.
A. G. B.
THE HEDGE-ACCENTOR.
Mr. W. E. Tescliemaker writes that he does not regard the case men-
tioned by Mr. Williams in "Canary and Cage-Bird Life " as a fair one, the
parent birds not having paired, built, or even laid in captivity. He how-
ever heard of a case in which this species was believed to have been bred,
but upon enquiry found that the report was erroneous.
BREEDING BRITISH BIRDS.
Mr. William B. Gibbins writes:--"I was much interested in the
letters in your January number of the Avicultural Magazine about breeding
British Birds. I think they are quite as interesting as foreign birds. At the
late Crystal Palace Show I was glad to see several specimens of British
hybrids which till then I should have thought impossible. I had a pair of
Cornish Choughs for several years. The hen laid eggs several times, but
never hatched the eggs, though they were fertile : I have since lost the
male bird, and find it almost impossible to get another without paying an
exorbitant price."
There is no doubt that, in themselves, British birds are quite as in-
teresting as foreigners, and in those cases in which the early life is im-
perfectly known, they are just as interesting to breed ; but the chief object
of breeding birds should be to learn something which was not previously
known respecting the life-history ; and when one compares British and
foreign species the early life of the former has been pretty thoroughly
studied, whereas our knowledge of the early life of the latter is still com

to science to breed foreign than British birds, at any rate in the case of the
familiar species of our gardens. Ed. pro. tem.
BUSTARDS.
Sir, --Last year I wrote you about the death of a pet Bustard through
eating bootlaces, etc. To-day I have just lost another young bird: an
inspection of crop revealed one 3fin. wire nail, one 2jin., one ijin. and
one ijin.; also a half piastre coin and a piece of wire an inch long. This
should prove a warning to anyone possessing a Bustard.

HEMIXUS VIRESCENS.
Sir,--I shall be glad if any member will give me information regard-
ing a Grey&amp;apos; Bulbul, supposed to be Ixos virescens or Wliite-browed Brush
Bulbul. Habitat, habits, etc., also description of female. Mine sings
remarkably well, and is the quietest bird in a cage I have ever seen, sitting
for hours in one place. Eats fruit, soaked sultanas, mealworms, etc.
Edith Warren Vernon.
The female alone is described in the " Catalogue of Birds in the
British Museum," vol. VI., pp. 53-54; as follows: '*&amp;apos;\0x25A0Adult female. Bright
olive-greenish above, wing-coverts and outer edges of quills darker olive
green than the back, the inner secondaries almost entirely dull olive-green ;
tail feathers blackish-brown, margined with a shade of olive, the outer
feathers tipped with whitish on the inner web, and for a little distance along
the latter; head and nape ashy&amp;apos; grey&amp;apos;, slightly tinged with olive ; lores, eye-
lid, and a faintly indicated eyebrow ashy whitish; ear-coverts dusky&amp;apos; brown,
plainly streaked with dull white; cheeks whitish, streaked with dusky
olive, with which the feathers are edged ; throat dull white, slightly washed
with olive; foreneck and breast white, the feathers edged with olive-green,
producing a streaked appearance, the flanks also streaked in the same
manner; lower abdomen, vent, and under tail-coverts pale y&amp;apos;ellow, white
in the centre of the feathers; under wing-coverts and axillaries bright
yellow; quills dusky&amp;apos; brown below, yellow along the inner web; "iris
dark red" ( H. O. Forbes). Total length 7^5 inches, culmen 075, wing 3-35,
tail 3&amp;apos;35, tarsus 07.
The Javan Streaked Bulbul appears to be confined to the island of
Java."
This does not read like the female of a Grey Bulbul, and I do not
know of any&amp;apos; species of Hemixus having been hitherto imported as a cage-
bird with the exception of the Indian Brown-eared Bulbul ( Hemixus flavala)
three examples of which arrived at the London Zoological Gardens in 1877.

Sir, --Since I wrote to you on the subject of some experiments I had
made on the food of lories, I have been trying experiments on an everyday
diet for these birds.
The result of my trials is, that for some considerable time past all my
lories and lorikeets have been fed on equal parts of milk, barley-water aud
pure water, poured on to powdered plain biscuit, aud boiled and sweetened.
The barley-water seems to prevent the milk curding. An examination
of the excreta shows that in the case of every bird the digestion is quite
perfect. The barley water seems to suit so well, that possibly the milk
could be nearly or quite abolished.
The birds are fed twice daily, and each bird gets about three table-
spoonsful of the liquid to one teaspoonsful of biscuit at each meal.
I also, of course, give fruit.
You may like to know that I have a pair of Red-necked Lorikeets
nesting. E. J. Brook.

I have some Wood-Swallows in a division of a twenty-compartment

bothered with these pests; but the only two mice that have been seen to
go into this compartment have been promptly killed by r one or other of the
Wood-Swallows.
The birds spit the mice through the head with one blow of their
beaks, and then hide the body for future use, when tender.
The birds do not seem vicious with other species so far as I have

told me that a wild Redpoll was always about the aviarjE I watched and
soon saw the bird flying round, feeding on the spray millet through the
meshes of the wire netting and trying hard to get through into the aviary,
having evidently fallen desparately in love with the little captive hen. I set
a trap-cage on the top of the aviary, caught him without any trouble, and
turned him in.
The two birds at once set to work and built a lovely little nest in a
shrub and reared a fine brood of young ones. Rater on I found these Red-
polls very inquisitive and mischievous with other birds' nests and gave them
all their liberty. I also reared, about the same time, a fine hybrid between
a cock Siskin and hen Greenfinch. Beatrice Carpenter.
Although Mr. Swailes speaks of this bird (Avicultural Magazine, ist
series, vol. III., p. 69) as one of the readiest species to breed in confinement,
it is probably not generally known (and certainly not to those who denounce
the cruelty of keeping birds in captivity) how constantly, not Redpolls
only, but other wild birds, will struggle to force their way through the wire
netting of outdoor aviaries in order to join captive birds. I have seen
the Redpoll trying to get into Mr. Seth-Smitli's aviaries, and variours Tits,
the Willow Warbler, Robin, Blackbird, Song-Thrush, and Starlings have
all tried to discover some way of getting into my larger garden aviary.
Not only do wild birds envy those in fairly large aviaries; but those
in captivity frequently make no attempt to escape when they have the
chance. A wild-caught Blackbird in one of my cages has, on two occasions,
had his cage-door (a sliding one) left wide open by my man, after giving
water in the evening, and the discovery was only made when I gave
the bird fresh food in the morning: the bird was only caught in the
winter of 1S96-7, when it voluntarily entered my smaller garden aviary. The
door of my Sliama's cage has also been left wide open on two occasions and
the bird has not taken any notice.
The mischievous meddlesomeness of the Redpoll was noted by me in
" British Birds with their Nests and Eggs," vol. II., p. 75; but it cannot too
often be impressed upon those who are desirous of breeding birds of
greater interest and who, unless cautioned, might associate this little nest-
destroyer with them.
I do not remember to have seen a hybrid between cock Siskin and
hen Greenfinch; it should be rather a pretty bird. A. G. BuTeer.

It is not in a wholly cheerful frame of mind that I take up
my pen, by request, to write about the Olive Finch, for much
water has flowed under Hammersmith Bridge since I parted with
my last specimens and the bird is no longer fresh in my mind *
and its place in the aviary and in my thoughts has for long
been occupied by its cousin the very much rarer Cuba Finch,
Phonipara canora, the "Melodious" Finch, the " Clianteur de
Cuba," so called because its "song" is most frequently, and
sometimes very frequently, only a noise, and, at the best, is but a
poor performance. Moreover, so many people have written about
the Olive Finch ; and, moreover once more, in July and Septem-
ber, 1900, at pp. 191 and 237 of vol. VI. of our Old Series, I wrote
about its very near relative P. pusilla, so nearly related that what
is said of the one applies equally to the other; so those of our
members who are interested in the genus Phonipara --a very in-
teresting genus, by the way--should read the writings of former
times as well as those of the present day.
Before proceeding further, it will be well to clear the air
by saying a few words about other members of the genus, as
there are not a few persons who are or have been happily preen-
ing their avicultural feathers under the idea that they have, or
have had, " Cuba" or "Melodious" Finches, when all the while

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
tlieir birds have been but the humble Olive Finch. The latter
are not, or were not, fashionable, but the Cubas are; moreover,
the Cuba Finch now-a-days is practically never in the open
market ; and so the Olives have been foisted on to the ignorant
public as " Cuba," and even as " Melodious," Finches in some-
thing more than an unblushing manner. Olive Finches are, in
truth, found in Cuba, but those which reach this country seldom
if ever come from that island.
The true Cuba or Melodious Finch, Phonipara canora, is
found only in the island of Cuba. " Male: --Throat and cheeks
black, extending above the eye ; a broad band of bright yellow
extends across the lower throat to the sides of the neck, and
passes in a narrow line, edging the black, to the eye ; top of head
slaty brown ; rest of upper surface bright olive green ; breast
brownish black, shading into pale gray on the belly and under
tail-coverts. Female :--Throat dark chestnut brown, shading
into gray on the cheeks; yellow collar much paler than in the
male ; chest and under parts ashy; the rest as in the male.
Length (skin) 3.75":--so Cory's Birds of the West Indies. The
distinguishing mark of the species is the yellow collar, which
appears at an early age, and can be recognised at a glance. It is
curious that not a single description of this band or collar that I
have ever met with is quite in accordance with the plumage of
the living bird, illustrations being equally unfortunate. The
description given in the British Museum Catalogue of Birds
(XII., 144), although misleading at first glance, is probably meant
to be correct; it runs as follows :--" .... sides of neck and a
collar across the lower throat golden yellow ; fore-neck black."
The word " across " is convenient but not strictly accurate, for
the yellow on the one side is separated from the yellow on the
other by the black fore-neck ; and the illustrations that depict a
broad unbroken band of yellow across the throat, often broader at
the centre than at the sides, are as hopelessly out of court as are
the usual descriptions that altogether omit any mention of the
black fore-neck. The two yellow arms which constitute the so-
called band or collar are broadest on the sides of the neck ; they
narrow as they approach the black fore-neck, and terminate on
each side of the centre with a slight curve upwards (or rounding

off of the corner), abutting but never encroaching upon the
black vertical line, a narrow one if you like but always unbroken.
The black above and the black below are connected by the black
line of the fore-neck, after the manner of a minute-glass. The
same arrangement of feather obtains in the female, although in
her it is but ill-defined. I have recently been examining the
throat of a female :--" Chin chestnut brown, shading downwards
into a very dark, almost a black and by no means obscure, bar
across the throat, just above the yellow collar ; from the centre
of this bar drops the shade of the fore-neck, which entirely dis-
perses as it flows into the ashy breast." Returning to the male,
in a good healthy fully adult example, the black line of the fore-
neck divides below, and, branching off horizontally to right and
left, edges the lower side of each yellow arm of the collar, shading
downwards into the brownish black breast. The density and extent
of the patch of blackish on the breast seem to vary with the state
of the bird's health, and, I think, decidedly increase as the nest-
ing season approaches. This species stands rather by itself in
Phonipara, whereas all the other species, sub-species, varieties or
races in the genus are, in all their ways so far as I know and read
of them, simply Olive Finches, some of which have been taking
a bath in the ink pot--some more, some less--and then have
fluttered down the nearest sooty chimney that came in their way.
The Olive Finch, P. lepida (or olivacea), may be thus briefly
described ; Male : --Above dull olive ; a superciliary stripe, lores,
and a patch on the chin and upper throat orange yellow, very
rich in good fully adult examples; rest of throat, &amp;e., black; a
narrow line of black borders the yellow of the throat and reaches
to the front of the eye ; under parts olivaceous gray. Female :--
&quot;'Racking the black of head and throat in the male ; the yellow
is much less conspicuous and paler; belly dull gray ; the olive of
the back duller than in the male. Length 4 inches." I must
add that although the female " lacks the black " she does not lack
the lines, for in old females the dark lines are well marked. The
young birds lack the black and yellow, which appear during the
first moult, when they are about three months old ; these colours,
especially perhaps the yellow and dark line-marks oir the female,
become better and more sharply defined as the birds arrive at

Mr. Reginald Phileipps,
full maturity. The extent and density of the black about the
breast, &amp;c., of the male of this species, with its sub-species, seem
to vary greatly according to the health of the individual bird, I
think also with the season, and doubtless also with its age. At
the recent Bird Show at the Palace, exhibit No. 2116 was a male
Olive Finch, which displayed about a minimum of the black
usual for this region. This bird, by the way, was entered in the
Show catalogue as a Cuba Finch. No. 2123 was a good pair of
the true Cuba Finch, "claimed " promptly for #\ by some fortu-
nate person. The reporter on the Show for one of the bird
papers, perceiving two very different species each catalogued as a
Cuba Finch, and not knowing the real name of No. 2116, referred
to it as a " Black-breasted Cuba Finch." The level of a Bird
Show would be raised if there were some competent person-
appointed, whose duty it should be to look out for such cases as
this, of which a limited number occur at almost every exhibition
of foreign birds; such an official would attach a notice to the
cage, setting forth the correct name--and in some cases something
more than the mere name--of the occupant. I11 other ways,,
aviculture has greatly advanced, thanks no little to the Avicul-
tural Society and Magazine, but Bird Shows, in an avicultural
sense, remain as they were, while they might be made of real
educational value.*
But to return to the descriptions of the plumage of the
Olive Finch. The following are some brief jottings I made a few
years ago on the plumage of a young male, which had been bred
in the aviary and brought into the house, precise age uncertain,,
say three months :--" Tittle yellow line above eye, and perhaps
small speck of orange on lores ; little spot of yellow on chin ;
dull blackish down throat, fore-neck, to upper chest, not spread-
ing to sides ; little ill-defined black near base of lower mandible ;
no black on forehead."
Habitat :--" Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, San Domingo, and Porto-
Rico."
* At page 198 of the Canary and Cage-Bird Life issue of March 6 , Mr. H. Scherreu
mentions a conversation lie overheard at the Palace concerning certain foreign birds, and.
closes his remarks with--" Their interest was quite real, but how greatly their pleasure-
would have been increased by a little knowledge."

The Museum Catalogue gives two sub-species, P. pusilla
and P. intermedia. These are but Olive Finches, with more
black on the breast region. Pusilla comes from the mainland--
" From Mexico, throughout Central America to Panama and
Columbia" ; in a really good healthy male, practically the whole
of the under parts, from side to side and reaching to the abdomen,
are black or blackish, the orange throat excepted. In hitermedia,
it is the extent of the black 011 the breast that is intermediate
between Lepida and Pusilla ; it is found on Cozumel Island, &amp;c.
All of these may be recognised by the yellow superciliary line,
lores, and upper throat.
Lastly, we come to the birds that want the yellow on face
and throat, of which may be taken as the type--
The Dusky Finch, Phonipai&amp;apos;a bicolor , from the " Lesser
Antilles generally ; Venezuela and Colombia," with its less dusky
edition P. marchii , from "Jamaica, San Domingo, S. Croix, Santa
Lucia, S. Thomas, and Barbadoes." So the Br. Mus. Catalogue;
but Cory does not seem to see his way to recognising P. marchii
as distinct, and includes all in P. bicolor. Mr. Bonhote, whom
we quote below, tells us that P. bicolor is found also in the
Bahama Islands. The Catalogue (p. 151) introduces yet another
bird, P. fuliginosa, from Guiana and Brazil, which is quite un-
known to me. It seems to be like the Dusky Finch, but larger
and more sooty generally, and at page 820 is declared to. be
worthy of being regarded as a distinct species. "Underparts
dull sooty grey ; the under tail-coverts edged with ashy fulvous."
All the birds of this genus are tiny creatures (but full of
fight), ranging in total length from the 3.4 inches of Canora to
the nearly 5 inches of Fuliginosa, the females being a little
smaller. They are so closely allied that one feels they are prac-
tically but local variations of the same bird, with similar habits
modified by local conditions--with the one exception of P. cano? r a,
which, although closely allied, differs from the others in various
little indescribable and subtle ways. Broadly speaking, there are
just three, the Cuba Finch, with its yellow collar "across" the
lower throat; the Olive Finch, with spot of yellow on lores,
chin, and upper throat; and the Dusky Finch, which dispenses
with brilliants altogether.

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
In the following notes, I shall not distinguish between P.
bicolor and P. viarchii, but will refer to them without discrimina-
tion as Dusky Finches, P. bicolor.
In January last, at the foot of p. 90 of our Magazine, Dr.
Butler writes :--.. .the species of Phonipcira he (Ridgwav) calls
' Grassquits,' a name applied to the genus in Jamaica, but the
meaning of which is not evident." The name "Quit" is still
common in Jamaica, and sometimes causes confusion (VII., 227),
so a little digression here may be of occasional assistance to our
readers. The excerpts are from Gosse's Birds of Javiaica, from
which I will quote too on the subject of the Olive and Dusky
Finches. The "Banana Quit" (p. 84), the Black and Yellow
Creeper, Certhiola flaveola (. Br. Mus. Cat. XI., 43), is a Flower-
pecker. The " Orange Quit" (236), the Rufous-tliroated Tanager,
Glossiptila (fTanagrella) ruficollis (XI., 48), seems to hover be-
tween the Flower-peckfers and the Tanagers. The " Blue Quit "
(238), the Grey Grosbeak, Pyrrhuphonia (. Euphonia ) Jamaica
(XI., 85) is also included in the Panagridae). The " Black-faced
Grassquit" (252) is the Dusky Finch; and the "Yellow-faced
Grassquit" (249) is the Olive Finch. Writing of the last two,
Gosse says:--" Both of these birds are permanent inhabitants of
Jamaica; their habits are so similar that the detailed history of
one will apply to the other. Both are quite common and
familiar." He also brings in (253) the " Bay-sided Grassquit,"
Phonipara adoxa , concerning which he is doubtful, but he adds :--
"The name of Quit is applied, without much discrimination, by
the negroes of Jamaica to several small birds .... it is probably
an African designation."
Referring to the fields of guinea-grass, Gosse writes (250):--
" In the autumn, when the grass is grown tall, and the panicles
of seed waving in the wind give it a hoary surface, the little
Grassquits (both Olive and Dusky Finches). .. .throng hither in
numerous flocks, and, perching in rows on the slender stalks,
weigh them down, while they rifle them of the farinaceous seeds.
In March, I have found the stomach of the Yellow-face full of
seeds of the common pasture grasses ; and I have been struck
with the enormous dilatation of the membranous craw, which, as
in the Gallinaceae, occupies the hollow of the furcula. D'Orbigny

....alludes to its prevalence in all the great Antilles. At the
Havanna, he says, it (the Olive Finch) is frequently caged, being
very docile and readily learning to sing. The Grass-birds re-
mind me * much of the European Sparrow (note the reference
below to the Bahama 'Sparrow'). They are very sociable, have
a strong predilection for the house-garden, and, when feeding by
half-dozens and dozens together, are very noisy. They have a
peculiar shrill chirp f: and, in the season when the grasses are in
seed, their diminutive bodies, for they are smaller than Wrens,
may be seen weighing down the culm of the grass, everywhere
about."
At first thought, the references made by writers to Phoni-
para being " quiet " little birds, using the word in the sense of
" amiable," strike one as comical, for every aviculturist who has
personal knowledge of any of these species in captivity agrees
that the males are veritable little x x x x x x if able to get at one
another. Even the young must be removed from their parents
as soon as practicable or they will probably be murdered. But
with the wild birds, leading natural lives, with plenty of space
and having to work for their living, nesting when they will and
without restraint, matters are very different. Nevertheless, al-
though so " quiet " at one season, probably at others there is
many an unrecorded battle over some well-favoured Black- or
Yellow-faced damsel or favourite nesting-site ; but the defeated
swain can always save his scalp by flying across the boundary.
In captivity, restraint is everywhere; even the very seasons are
in league against them ; the fiery pent up feelings and energies
are madly seeking for an outlet, and for an opportunity to be up
and doing; and any probable or possible rival must be swept out
of the way at any cost.
My notes occasionally refer to the song of the Olive Finch,
which I cannot clearly recall to mind, though I well remember
that it had a song, which is more than I should like to say of the
so-called "Melodious" Finch. Over and over again I have
heard if. in my dining-room during the cold season, a short
pretty little oft-repeated song. One of my notes, dated 3 June,

1901, of a building pair in my garden-aviary, says of the male--
" Sings a great deal," and another, two days later--" Male on
high perch in front singing as if master of the aviary." In
January last, at page 91, Dr. Butler wrote :--"... .the more gaudy
Grass-finches, somewhat recalling the colouring of Phonipay-a
and many of them with similar whispered songs." I find myself
unable to follow Dr. Butler here ; none has a whispered song that
I know of, nor has any similarity in colouring attracted my
attention. Neither, may I add, have I noticed any likeness in
habits or carriage between Phonipara and Poephila ; moreover,
the former lay spotted eggs, the latter white.
The nests of Phonipara are domed ; but nests built by the
same pair (for both birds work) differ from one another according
to circumstances and environment. Gosse has the following
curious reference to domed nests (86 ):--"An exceedingly in-
teresting memoir, from the pen of Mr. Hill, on the prevalence of
domed nests within the tropics, and the connection of this fact
with electricity, will be found in the Zoological Transactions for
September 14th, 1841."* Perhaps some Fellow of the Society will
kindly look up the reference, and report to us of its nature.
The nests are constructed chiefly of dried grasses; and,
with me, feathers were freely used, although not necessarily for
the lining ; for these birds, if proper materials are not within
convenient reach, will make use of almost anything that may
come handy, and will build almost anywhere and under any cir-
cumstances. The eggs, when fresh and blown, are clear white,
spotted, chiefly around the larger end, with red or reddish-brown,
ox perhaps with pale brown. As far as I have seen, with healthy
properly kept birds, the spots are of a rich deep reddish or
reddish-brown when laid, but this colour fades. The only eggs
that I have myself seen which were spotted with pale brown were
those of a " pair " of female Olive Finches, who set up house-
keeping together in my aviary ; this was not because they had
become tainted with the suffragette microbe-- pas si beie --it was
only because at the time I had not a male for them ; and, even
in this case, the eggs may have been brightly coloured when first
laid, for they may have been, and probably were, some weeks old
when I rifled the nest.

I cannot do better than add here a few more extracts from
Gosse's Birds of Jamaica , for lie gives ns much information on
the nesting habits of Olive and Dusky Finches in the wild state:
and the digressive references to birds and wasps are too interest-
ing and instructive to need apology.
Page 252 :--" O11 one occasion, some twenty or thirty of
the Yellow-throated Grass-bird (Olive Finch) constructed a mass
of nests within the wide crutch of a baobab tree, and lived in
common." This is suggestive ; but the last four words are not
to be accepted right away, I think. Mr. Hill was the authority
for this note.
Page 251:--" Mr. Hill has favoured me with the following
note. ' Nests of the Grass-bird are frequently brought to me,
but without distinguishing between the yellow and the black-
throated species. A nest in the garden, built in a Nerium
oleander , by the latter (in July), enables me to set down a remark
or two. I see no difference in the structure of the nests of the
two species. They are both domed nests, made of pliable dry
grass, and lined with horse-hair. This nest is built between the
forks of the long vertical stems of the oleander, or South Sea rose.
Three other vertical stems press it close, and the leaves quite
canopy it over. The substratum of the nest, on which it may be
said to be bedded, is a mass of long linen rags, wound in and
round the forked branch.
' It is quite true that the Grass-bird very frequently selects
a shrub 011 which the wasps have built, fixing the entrance close
to their cells. I saw a nest in this secure situation a few years
ago ; it was pointed out to me as illustrating a habit of the
yellow-throated species (Olive Finch).' " At page 85, writing of
the Banana Quit, Gosse says:--"The nest of this bird is very
frequently, perhaps usually, built in those low trees and bushes
from whose twigs depend the paper nests of the Brown Wasps,
and in close contiguity with them. The Grassquits are said to
manifest the same predilection ; it is a singular exercise of in-
stinct, almost of reason; for the object is doubtless the defence
afforded by the presence of the formidable insects." It appears
that it is not only in Jamaica that birds seek the protection of
wasps for their nests. In December last, at p. 446 of Canary and

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
Cage-Bird Life , Mr. H. Scherren wrote :--" In Venezuela, accord-
ing to the report of a collector sent out by the Brooklyn Museum,
there exists a remarkable kind of companionship ('symbiosis')
between a certain species of wasps and the Yellow-rumped Hang-
nest. The wasps build a huge nest, which attains a diameter of
5ft., as is shewn by two specimens in the museum ; and around
this as a centre the Hangnests construct a colony of their own
pensile nurseries. If the wasps' nest be destroyed or abandoned,
the Hangnests forthwith desert their own domiciles." And,
again, page 494,--" In The Field, Colonel W. Giffard reports that
he met with something of a similar kind in Gold Coast Hinter-
land in the case of wasps and a small Waxbill, which I take to be
the Cordon Bleu. He says that the bird nests in bare mimosas,
and of the many he saw each had a wasps' nest about a foot
from the opening of the nest. The wasps and their nests were
very small, the nests flat and roughly circular. The wasps were
particularly venomous, as he discovered when investigating the
Waxbills' nests, not having noticed the wasps. ... After he first
noticed the nests close together he never found a Waxbills' nest
without a wasps' nest at hand, but occasionally a wasps' alone."
Now let us take two ordinary nesting cases of the Dusky
Finch. (1) Gosse, ibid., p. 253:--"....in June was built be-
tween three contiguous stalks of maize, and an ear. It was a
dome composed of slender stalks of grass and weeds woven
into a globose form, flattened in front, on which side was the
opening. The dried beard of the corn entered into the structure,
and a small frond of fern, and a tendril or two of passion-flower
adorned the entrance. Three eggs were laid, measuring by #
inch ; pointed ; white, splashed with dull red, chiefly at the
larger end, where confluent." (2) Bonhote, O71 some Bahama
Birds, Avic. Mag, VIII., 280 :--"Another quiet and sombre in-
habitant of the coppet, as well as of the gardens, is the Bahama
Sparrow... .This bird is remarkably tame and hops about the
verandahs, even coming into the house to pick up the crumbs
from the table. The nest is a very pretty domed structure placed
about four or five feet from the ground at the top of a long
straight sapling. It is made entirely of grass woven and matted
together, with the entrance hole at the side, but without lining

of any kind; the eggs, usually three in number but sometimes
more, are dull white in colour, with brownish spots towards the
larger end."
And now we must turn more directly to the Olive Finch
in captivity, in the United Kingdom.
The following extracts from letters written by a Mr. M. at
Dundee shew us the ease with which this species may be bred ;
the parent pair had been sold to him by a London dealer as Cuba
Finches. Under date 25 Sept., 1900, Mr. M. wrote:--" Ref. the
Cuba Finches. I bred them in a cold room in a small square
cage 10 x 10 and about I5in. high. I placed a small flower pot
well up the cage, with a square hole cut out of the lip 1J x ijin-
(covering the mouth of the pot with wood), put a small quantity
of withered grass in the pot, and gave them cow hair to finish,,
which they did very nicely. There were four of them altogether ;
one died after being 011 the sticks. They, the old ones, were fed
on ripe and well seeded chickweed, with canary and millet; and
the ordinary 7 canary egg food used in the breeding time. T
would have had another nest, as they immediately went to nest
again and laid another four eggs, but unfortunately a wild black-
bird got out of his cage and scared the hen from her eggs, which
were only two days from hatching, that being on the 12th day.
The old hen left the nest every time I went into the bird room
and if I did stop for a time she would pop in and out every other
minute. I am sure I will be able to breed them next year with
better results, provided they are spared to live." On October 11,
he wrote further:--" Ref. Cuba Finches--so far as I can recollect
they hatched about 13 days after fourth egg was laid. I have no
dates, but they were bred in July. I calculated them coming out
same as canaries, and they did as I expected." The three young
birds referred to above I purchased : see my foot-note O.S. VII.,
p. 30--I had been misled by the vender of the parents, for the
young developed into ordinary Olive Finches.
I have myself noticed that the female usually leaves the
nest if it be approached. I have reared several young, and so
has Mr. Seth-Smith. I need refer to only one of my nests--in
the garden-aviary--in which at the time were some rather large
and unamiable birds, who caused the Olive Finches to have rather

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
a bad time. One young one had been reared somewhere in the
depths of the aviary ; after a while, another single youngster
appeared from somewhere. It was one of these two, I know not
which, whose transition plumage I described above. And then
the parents, who from time to time had played at nest-building
in a little thorn bush which was in the very front of the aviary
and fully exposed to view, unable to bear further persecution,
overcame their objections to human society, and completed and
occupied this nest. They had no wasps to act as guards, but
they were equal to the occasion. My laconic notes run as fol-
lows :--" 6. 8. oi--Felt in nest; there were young; funnel sloped
down from nest, and strongly fortified at entrance by thorn
boughs ; suspended--no boughs under" ; i.e. the entrance to the
nest was brought up, or rather down, to a cluster of thorn
branches growing together so closely that no large bird could get
at it without much difficulty. Later, they laid again in this nest;
and, on the morning of September ig, I found this entirely sus-
pended nest apparently falling, owing to the weight of the young
birds, assisted, doubtless, by that of the parents during the night.
While arranging a support, all the youngsters bolted, four, or
possibly five : I thought I counted five, but eventually could
account for only four of them. Later, the parents slept in this
nest, which they had endeavoured to repair. One night, it came
to grief, and I removed it altogether. The succeeding night the
male, who was in perfect health, presumably failing to occupy a
warm or sheltered roosting spot, although there were numbers of
artificial shelters about, took a chill (the weather was cold and
wet) and died in a few hours--so slender is the thread that holds
the life of these tiny creatures, in our inhospitable climate.
The fledglings are noisy little fellows; one of my notes
runs, "Young make great noise, calling tsit ." Both parents feed
the young, the female usually, though not invariably, being the
more faithful in her attentions to them. Both are inclined to be
erratic, as they always want to be nest-building or nest-repairing ;
all being well, they keep to the same nest, brood after brood.
The following note is worth reproducing--" Male fed from crop
eight times without stopping," i.e. fed a young bird. Within the
limits of an aviary, only one pair may be kept, and, if practicable,
the young should be removed from their parents at an early age.

Olive Finches, however sociable they maybe among them-
selves when wild, do not, in captivity, save under exceptional
circumstances, associate or interfere with birds of other genera,
grassfinches or otherwise. Although inseparable, the male aud
female do not usually cuddle together; as a rule, I think, they
prefer roosting in the open, especially in a natural tree, to sleep-
ing in a box or nest; so far as I have been able to observe, when
they sleep under cover, invariably from preference in a natural
nest, they do so for warmth and shelter--and may be in order to
hide from prying eyes when in a small or exposed-to-view cage
or aviary.
Food :--Indian aud spray millet, canary, millet. Needless
to add that, when in the garden at any rate, suitable " green "
seeds would be very acceptable. When feeding young, they
certainly are keen after " green " seeds, although the young may
be reared without them. At page 341 of vol. IV. of our New
Series, Mr. Setli-Smith writes :--" I supplied flowering grass daily~
... .A pair of Olive Finches had a hungry brood near by, which
they too seemed to feed almost entirely upon grass-seed." Pre-
sumably they take aphides, but I am unable to make any definite-
statement on that point.
The female of this species I have found to be a fairly good
liver, quite a good liver when acclimatized, if not left out in the
garden altogether until too late in the autumn, nor left in the
presence of the male say from mid-winter until about May. Not
so the male, who, with me, had a weakness for going off at a few
(30--40) hours' notice from inflammatiomor bronchial trouble. It
seems to have no stamina--great warmth steadily maintained is
the only thing which I know of that affords even temporary relief.
I used sometimes to think that his fiery ardent nature might have
something to do with this. For in truth he is a truculent fellow,
which causes embarrassment in the management. In my judg-
ment, the best treatment during the cold season is to remove the
females out of sight and hearing ; more than one male may then,
be allowed to fly together, the more the merrier if there be plenty
of space. Let them fly loose, with other birds, in a very moder-
ately warmed birdroom, and let them have a little fly and peck
(of inestimable value) in the open garden-aviary on not too cold

Mr. Gordon Dargrrish,
days. They are intelligent, and, with a little guidance at first
will not only find their way backwards and forwards through a
very small opening but may be trusted to return to the shelter
of the room if at all cold, and in any case to come in long before
dark. One would have thought that other small birds might
have sufficient sense to do likewise, but such is not always the
case. Some species will never come in to roost unless compelled
to do so. Others, like my Ringed Finches (Stictoplera annuloscv )
at this moment, cannot find their way backwards and forwards
through a small aperture, notwithstanding that other species are
shewing them the way, under their very noses, all through the
da}&amp;apos;: for the Ringed Finches, I have to throw the window wide
open; and they require a great deal of schooling, delicate though
they be, before they can be taught to sleep in comfort in the
birdroom--I mean, during the winter months. All members of
the genus Phonipara must be regarded as delicate, so far as
temperature is concerned.
To sum up, the Olive Finch is an exceedingly nice little
bird, and is neglected, when imported, only because its merits
are not known. A good fully adult male, thoroughly healthy, is
a pretty little fellow, the deep black and rich orange of face and
throat being very attractive. It is intelligent, sprightly, and
tame, a bird of some character, and much more engaging than is
many a one that is habitually kept by aviculturists in this country.

By Gordon Dargrrrsh.
Since the wearing of bird plumes has become "fashion-
able" an immense amount of harm has been done by certain
Mahommedan natives in India who, finding out some birds are
valuable, slaughter them wholesale, and in the catching of these
they are singularly successful. One very ingenious way they
have is by means of bird lime. The fowler first of all provides
himself with a large screen made of leaves and grass. This he
carries in one hand ; in the other he has a number of bamboos
that can be jointed together like a fishing rod, the last joint being
very thin and forked at the end ; this being smeared with bird

lime. Hiding himself behind the screen he crawls near the birds,
and one by one very cautiously joints the pieces of rod together,
gradually pushing them all the while near to the unconscious
birds. When he thinks he has got near enough he gives the rod
a sharp twist, and the sticky limed ends catch in the birds'
plumage. He then drags the bird to him and slips it into a
closed basket at his side. I have seen a clever fowler catch
several one after the other before the rest of the flock were aware
of what was taking place.
For the capture of Egrets the jointed rod is used, only
instead of having the ends limed a short barbed spear is fixed;
the fowler now creeps under the tree where the Egret is sitting
on her nest and transfixes the unfortunate bird on the barbed
end. A whole "heronry" may thus be cleared in a single day.
For Egret plumes a considerable price was realised in the Cal-
cutta market.
Thanks to efforts made by a Society for the protection of
birds in India great restraint has been placed on these marauders
of the feathered tribe.
Vendors of " Ospreys" as Egret plumes are known to the
trade, try to salve the consciences of the buyers that these
plumes are artificial ; but this has been repeatedly proved to be
not true. It is not possible to manufacture artificial plumes of
this sort and purchasers of " Ospreys " would do well to swallow
this statement cum grano satis. Some slight idea may be formed
of the immense destruction to the feathered tribes from the fol-
lowing sale notice, quoted by Mr. Dewar :--"At the feather sale
at the Commercial Sale Rooms, Loudon, on 19th April, 1904,
there were 161 packages of Osprey feathers, of varying quantities,
these being all the plumes of the various Egrets and small
Eastern Herons, with a few of the Common Heron (A. cinerea )
Of Birds of Paradise from New Guinea, there were 3255, chiefly
P. apoda ; of Impeyau Pheasants from the Himalayas, 648; of
Indian Rollers no fewer than 3913; with also a large number of
East Indian Pigeons, and Pittas, Indian Owls, Parrots and Jungle
cocks. One firm catalogued 469 Chinese Mandarin Ducks. The
remainder of the birds were mostly from America, comprising
52,628 Humming Birds, and numerous Cardinals, Tanagers,

Trogans, Toucans, Parrots, etc. There were also a large quantity
of wing quills from Pelicans, Swans, Geese, Turkeys, and
Eagles." Mr. Frank Finn has suggested that Egrets might be
with advantage " farmed " and kept in captivity like Ostriches,
for the sake of their plumes, and since the public must and
always will have " Ospreys" the suggestion might be considered.
I herewith append a list of the principal " plume" birds of
India with descriptions and notes.

The White Ibis {Ibis melanocephla).
General colour, white. In the breeding season there are
elongate white feathers round the base of the neck and on the
upper breast. The tertiaries or upper wing feathers hang in long
graceful plumes, elongated and loose textured. The head is
bluish black and devoid of feathers. The bird has a total length
of about 30 inches. This Ibis is resident and fairly common in
the plains of India where there are sheets of water of any size,
generally in flocks except when nesting. Its food appears to
consist of small shell fish, worms, and insects. The nest is built
on large trees and is composed of sticks. The eggs vary from
two to four in number and are of a pale bluish white, not spotted,
though occasionally marked with faint brown.

The Adjutant {Leptoptilus da bins&amp;apos;).
The whole head, neck, and pouch devoid of feathers;
there is a ruff of soft white feathers round the base of the neck ;
the whole of the upper plumage with wings and tail black
slightly glossed with green. Lower parts white; the under tail
feathers are soft and downy. Length : 60 inches.
The Adjutant is a large Stork, which has forsaken the
traditions of its family and taken to the ways of a scavenger for
a living, feeding with Vultures, Crows and Kites on any offal or
refuse. Formerly it was exceedingly plentiful in Calcutta, but
now that the sanitary arrangements of that city have improved,
the Adjutant has taken itself off. Besides feeding on carrion, its
food also consists of frogs and small reptiles. It is from this
bird and the small Adjutant {L. javanicus) that "Marabout"
feathers are obtained, these being the soft under tail feathers so

much in demand for ladies' feather boas. When I was at Aden
I had a small bunch of these " Marabout " feathers offered to me
for five shillings. I eventually secured them for fourpeuce !
Adjutants, like other Storks, are completely devoid of voice
muscles, and the only sound they appear to make is produced by
the snapping of the huge bill. They breed rarely in India, but
plentifully in Burmah, and the nest is a huge structure of sticks
placed 011 large trees. They breed in colonies, sometimes in
company with Pelicans, and the eggs are white and three in
number. The fowlers snare Adjutants by means of nooses
fastened on bamboo pegs stuck in the ground. Mr. Inglis thus
describes the process:--"The nooses which are all close to-
gether are put down on three sides near where the bird is feed-
ing, and the men gradually make it edge up to them. If it steps
into them well and good, if not they take them up and put them
farther on. It is generally a very lengthy proceeding but that is
immaterial to the native."

The large Egret (Herodias alba).
Colouration, pure white. The breeding plumes consist of
a very long train of feathers springing from the back--these are
the "Ospreys"--extending from four to five inches beyond the
tail. There are no crest or breast plumes. The bill is black in
the breeding season, at other times yellow. Length about 36
inches.
The large Egret, or as it is sometimes called Great White
Heron, is plentiful throughout the plains of Northern India, and
is also found in Burmah and Ceylon. It breeds like all Herons
in large colonies, but after the breeding season is a somewhat
solitary bird. I have always found it extremely wary and diffi-
cult to approach, but when nesting looses much of its natural
wariness, and is then tame and confiding, and hence falls an easy
prey to the fowler. A good many birds that are at other times
wild and inaccessible lose this trait when nesting, and a case in
point came under my notice a year ago. A gamekeeper I was in
company with found a nest of young Jays (Garrtilusglandarius)
and both the old birds sat close to the nest refusing to leave and
paid the penalty with their lives. The Jay at other times is one

matter to shoot them. This is the case also with the Wood
Pigeon ( Columba palumbas), and yet I have seen one almost
caught before she would leave her eggs.

The Little Egret (Herodias garzetta.&amp;apos;)
This Egret may at once be distinguished from the last by
its smaller size, and possesses a crest in the breeding season,
consisting of two long white feathers : moreover the bill is black
at all season.
This is perhaps the best known and most persecuted of
all the Egrets, and owing to the enormous demand for its plumes,
has, in many parts of the world, been almost completely exter-
minated. In India it is common in many parts, but that the
value there of its plumes is well known is proved from the fact
that as much as Rs. i&amp;apos;5 per tola is sometimes realised for them ;
Rs. 8 and io being paid for those of H. alba and H. intermedia.

The Smaller Egret (Herodias intermedia :).
Pure white. The breeding plumes on the back nearly
touching the ground and varying in length from 15 to 17 inches.
There are also long breast plumes and no crest. Bill in breed-
ing season black, at other times yellow. Total length about 26
inches.
This Egret is found throughout India, Ceylon, and parts
of Burmah. It is also found in China and Japan. Its habits and
nesting arrangements agree with the other Egrets. It breeds in
large colonies on trees. The eggs are a pale bluish green,
generally four in number.
The Cattle Egret (.Bubulcns coromandus).
In winter, pure white, witli the exception of a buff patch
on the forehead. I11 the breeding season, the whole of the head,
neck, and back plumes a delicate orange buff. The back plumes
do not extend beyond the tail. The bill is yellow at all seasons.
Length : 20 inches.
This Egret derives its name from being constantly at-
tendant on cattle and buffaloes, and is frequently to be seen

perching on their backs searching for ticks. It is far less aquatic
in its habits than other Egrets. It breeds in colonies generally
in niungo topes. It would appear that this bird does not always
assume nuptial dress when breeding, as Mr. C. M. Iuglis writes:
" In one colony which was breeding there were quite as many
birds in winter plumage as in the other dress." The orange
dorsal plumes are most valuable, sometimes realising from Rs. io
to 16 a tola.

The Pond Heron (.Ardeola grayi ).
In breeding plumage the head and neck are yellowish
brown, darker on the crown; throat, white; feathers on the
breast long and brownish with narrow white streaks; back
feathers long and deep maroon gradually darkening towards the
tips; rest of body, tail, and wings, white; a crest of long white
lanceolate feathers.
In non-breeding plumage the head and neck is brown
streaked with buff; no dorsal or breast plumes. Bill, blue at the
base, yellow in the middle, tip black. Legs and feet pea green.
Total length : 18 inches.
The Pond Heron or "paddy bird" is not only the com-
monest Indian Heron but one of the commonest of Indian birds
found throughout the country, Ceylon and Burma, where in the
last named country it meets with a closely allied form A. bacchus.
Its range extends to the Persian Gulf and the Malay Peninsula.
It is also found in the Andaman, Nicobar, and Laccadive Islands.
Being an ardent disciple of Isaac Walton's the paddy bird
will spend hours at a time staring in the murky depths of a pool
or pond waiting for its finny prey to come within reach of its
sharp and deadly bill. It also devours numbers of frogs. Any-
one accustomed to see the paddy bird in winter would hardly
recognise the same bird in all the glories of its nuptial dress, and
arrayed in this it is truly a splendid creature, rivalling its near
ally the Squacco Heron (N. ralloides&amp;apos;) of S. Europe. When
flying, the Pond Heron gives utterance to a harsh croak. Most
of the Heron family with, perhaps, the exception of the Cattle
Egret, are sedentary birds, but the Pond Heron is the laziest of
the whole tribe. The plumes of this bird are not so valuable as

those of the Egrets, but it gets persecuted to a certain extent,
not only on account of these but also because certain natives
hold its flesh in high esteem. So very tame is the bird that in
many parts of India it has received tlie name of "blind heron "
and indeed at times is almost trodden on, so loath is it to take
wing. The paddy bird breeds like all Herons in colonies, from
May to September, and lays from four to six greenish blue eggs.
THE BLACK CASS1QUE.*
Cassidix oryzivora.
This somewhat Crow-like Starling was mentioned in the
Magazine some years ago by Mr. R. Phillipps under its Dutch
name of " Zwarte Kivispaal.&quot; It has been called the "Great
Black Rice-Bird"; in Ecuador Mr. Goodfellow tells us these
birds are called " Garapateros " (tick-eaters) from the fact doubt-
less that they often settle upon swine to search for ticks, as
recorded by MangelsdorfF. At Para the name "Grauna" seems
to be given, and at Rio Janeiro " Mairo." I do not know the
translations of these names.
The most interesting fact with regard to this species is
that it builds no nest, but lays its eggs in the nests of other
Icterine birds, such as Ostinops decumanus and O. crisiatus,
Cassinis persicus and C. affiiiis : but, although parasitic, it is not
destructive after the manner of the Cowbirds ( Molothrus ) but is
satisfied for its young to take their chance with the young of the
foster-parents.
This curious phase of parasitism was first discovered by
Dr. Goeldi, who published an account of it in his " Aves da
Brazil," p. 284 ; and subsequently, when on a visit to Para he was
informed that it had the same habit there.
Dr. Goeldi's book being regarded by systematists as an
unscientific publication, his discovery was, to all intents and
purposes, shelved, until in 1896 Herr Kuschel communicated a
note to the "Ibis" to the effect that he possessed eggs of C.
Or should it be "Cacique" as the Americans spell it? In England we adopt the
phonetic spelling for this word !

oryzivora taken out of the nests of Cassicus persicus, and stated
that his collector had seen females of the former entering
nests of the latter, and that one of these when shot and opened
contained in its oviduct a mature egg.
I11 "Timehri," vol. X., u.s. p. 37 (vide "Ibis" 1897) there
is an article entitled "Queer Homes" by Mr. C. A. Lloyd, in
\0x25A0which he appears not quite to understand the parasitic habit, for
he says that Cassidix oryzivora seems never to build a home of
her own, but contents herself with making use of the deserted
Bunyah nests in which to lay her curiously marked eggs. By the
wa}^ T. K. Salmon (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1879, p. 510) describes the
eggs as " wdiite " : he sent home two eggs differing remarkably
in size, the smaller one being presumably that of the owner of
the nest. I11 vol. XI. of Timehri Mr. Barshall confirms the
parasitic habit of the species.
In its wild state the Black Cassique feeds upon all kinds
of insects in various stages, as well as ticks and other pests which
annoy different domesticated beasts ; also certain cereals, rice,
maize, etc. Moreover, according to Mangelsdorff, it is often
caught by the Brazilians, who let it have the run of the house,
after the manner of a Jackdaw, and then it accepts all varieties
of human food. Then again we are told by Mr. Goodfellow that
he frequently shot the species in banana-plantations, where it
was feeding upon the ripe fruit. Thus it is perfectly evident
that in captivity this bird ought to do well upon the usual food
supplied to Hangnests, Tanagers, and many other insectivorous
birds.
It would seem that, after the manner of the Cowbirds, the
young desert their foster-parents and join flocks of their own
species soon after they leave the nest; since Natterer speaks of
coming across flocks in a maize plantation at Camara in January
accompanied by young already fledged. A. G. B.

Three Voyages of a Naturalist, by Mr. J. Nicoll, with an intro-
duction by the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Crawford. WiTherby &amp; Co.,
326, High Holborn, London.
When one picks np a book with the object of reviewing it,
one is not always tempted to read it through from beginning to-
end; but the present one is so absorbingly interesting to anyone
with a love for Natural History, that it is utterly impossible to
read it in a perfunctory manner.
Like Bates' " Naturalist on the Amazons," and Wallace's
" Naturalist in the Malay Archipelago," Mr. Nicoll's account of
his three voyages carries the reader in imagination to all the
scenes which he visited, the illusion being considerably assisted
by the beautiful photographs which accompany the text; so that,
when once taken up, it is almost impossible to lay the book aside
until it has been read from cover to cover.
In the earlier chapters one gets the impression that the
author has a decided preference for sea-birds and waders; this
however is due to the fact that the islands first described appear
to be the homes of very few laud birds, and one often comes
across a regretful note by the author to this effect. Farther on
in the book, these more generally popular types come in for their
full share of notice.
The scientific names of the more important birds and
other vertebrates whicli were secured are given, either in the
text or in foot-notes; and one's only regret in reading through
the book was, that so few names of insects were given. To an
entomologist, though perhaps not to an exclusive ornithologist,
a recognition of the species observed would have made the
narrative more real. The 220 beautiful illustrations and four
sketch-maps leave nothing to be desired, Mr. Meade-Waldo's
photographs are excellent. Those of our members who perused
with pleasure this ornithologist's delightful articles on "Birds
seen during the Cruise of the 'Valhalla' in 1905-6," which ap-
peared in vols. IV. and V. of the present series of our Magazine,
will eagerly study the fuller account in Mr. Nicoll's fascinating

<bodyText confidence="0.990894594594595" page_id="32669135"  page_num="Page 185" year="" vol="">
The March number of this publication begins with an in-
teresting article by William Barren, on the crouching habit of
the Stone-Curlew: four admirable reproductions of photographs
of the young at various ages, crouching amongst different sur-
roundings, accompany this paper, which is a valuable addition
to the many recorded cases of protective assimilation in nature ;
Dr. N. F. Ticeliurst describes some bird remains from the Brocli
of Ayre, Orkney ; Major F. W. Proctor gives us some further in-
formation touching the Lesser Redpole as a breeding species in
Berkshire ; Messrs. H. F. Witherby and N. F. Ticeliurst continue
their account of the more important additions to our knowledge
of British Birds since 1899, and various notes complete the
number ; among the latter an instance of three Cuckoo's eggs in
a Robin's nest and a clutch of seven eggs in the Great Crested
Grebe's nest are perhaps the most noteworthy ; four seems to be
the usual number to a clutch, five being a rare number, yet it
seems odd that two hens of this quarrelsome species should lay
in one nest. -
THE EMU.
The January part of this important publication provides
us with an admirable photographic portrait of Colonel-Surgeon
C. S. Ryan, the third President of the A.O.U. ; it commences
with an account of the proceedings of the seventh session of the
Union, the Balance Sheet for the year, the address of the Vice-
President, on the subject of Bird Protection; the Report of the
Hon. Secretary ; Notes by Robert Hall and John P. Rogers on a
collection of birds from North West Australia ; some notes on
the location of birds in the vicinity of Homesteads, Break-o'-day
District, Tasmania, by Colonel W. V. Legge ; More notes about
Herons, by A. H. E. Mattingley, with two excellent reproduc-
tions of nests with eggs and young of Nycticorax caledo?iicus : a
number of short notes on various subjects; two Reviews;
Notices of Meetings, and lastly an excellent reproduction of the
portrait of the late Professor Alfred Newton which was published
in the October number of British Birds : altogether this number
condenses a considerable amount of information into a very
limited space.

MESSRS. PAYNE AND WALLACE'S COLLECTION.

<bodyText confidence="0.983712212121212" page_id="32669136"  page_num="Page 186" year="" vol="">
During a short stay in Western Australia I took the opportunity of
calling on Mr. Wallace in Freemantle to see his collection of living birds,
etc., which, all being well, should reach England some time in April. Our
members may like to hear what the collection consists of.
I was particularly pleased to see a fine lot of Pileated Parrakeets
(Porphyrocephalus spurius), all in splendid condition. This is certainly one
of the most beautiful of all of the Parrakeets. Next the Stanleys ( Ptaty -
cercus icterus) attracted my attention. There was a fine group of these, all
looking very fit, and in much redder plumage than those that Mr. Wallace
took home last year, which is strange, as these are evidently mostly young
birds.
Then there were several pairs of the rare Rock Grass Parrakeet
(.Neophema petrophild), and one or two Elegants amongst them. About
ten pairs of Crimson-wings |a few " Twenty-eights," three Orauge-uaped
Lorikeets ( 7 &amp;apos;richoglossus rubritorques), and a very nice young Western Black
Cockatoo completed the Parrots.
The Grassfinches were a fine lot, consisting of Painted (Emblemct
picta), Crimson (Neochmia phaeton), Gouldians, Masked, Longtailed, Star,
Ringed, and a few Munia pectoralis. Not a single specimen of M. flavi-
prymna, which Mr. Wallace tells me he has not met with this trip.
Two species of Honey-eaters are included in this collection, namely,
one of the Friar Birds and the Garrulous Honey-eater. Some nice Hawks,
Sacred and Red-rumped Kingfishers, oue specimen of the large Buff-breasted
Kingfisher (Dacelo cervina), two Owls, six Emus, Brush Bronze-wings,
Peaceful, Bar-shouldered, Diamond and Plumed Doves complete the list of
birds so far as my notes go, but Mr. Wallace tells me he hopes to get
several more birds before he sails. Besides the birds I noticed several
Kangaroos, Wallabies and Lizards.
All appeared to be in perfect condition, and I saw ample evidence of
the great care that is bestowed by Mr. Wallace upon his live stock, and he
has my best wishes for a very successful trip home with his stock.

of groups of birds in confined spaces, and asking for the opinion of mem-

bers on the subject.; I cannot help thinking that such articles would be
immensely popular, and would not only increase the sphere of usefulness of
the Magazine but bring new members to the Society.
Of the existing members of the Society there are, no doubt, several
experts in many different classes of birds, and many more members who
have knowledge of one class of bird only and would like to extend that
knowledge to other classes.
Probably, however, the bulk of the members are those who, like
myself, are genuinely interested in bird life without pretending to have any
special knowledge about any class of birds whatever. To such persons the
articles suggested would be of immense utility.
There is no doubt that a good deal of time and money is often wasted
by amateurs in misdirected efforts, which could have been prevented had
certain information within the knowledge of many experts been imparted,
and I gather that it is with the intention of imparting such information
that the articles are suggested.
A series of articles on different classes of birds, similar to Mr. Frank
Finn's little book on "Fancy Pheasants" (which originally appeared in the
Feathered World ),.would be invaluable, even if the articles had to be some-
what shortened owing to limited space.
To mention a few birds which specially interest me, I do not suppose
that many people have had an opportunity of getting to know, except by
dearly-bought experience, the immense difficulties of keeping curlew,
whimbrel, spoonbills, egrets, little bittern and Tliick-knee plover for any
length of time ; whereas, on the other hand, some of the so-called waders
are admittedly very easy to keep, and others not difficult, if only they can
be obtained.
I11 writing as above I am not in any way wishing to detract from the
merits of the Magazine on its present lines, but am merely emphasising the
fact that an article for beginners might appear in each number of the
Magazine without unduly encroaching on the space usually devoted to
those further advanced in aviculture.
Even if the Magazine had to be slightly enlarged the increased
membership should pay for the extra cost. It is usually a sound business
practice to cater for all classes. C. Barnby Smith.
Sir,--A s our Council has asked for the opinion of members, especially
I think our younger and less experienced members like myself regarding the
publication of a number of articles in the Avicultural Magazine on groups of
birds, say for example Waxbills, Tanagers or small Parrakeets, these papers
to give very fully the best methods of feeding in cages and in the aviary,

what birds to mix with and the best information about breeding in captivity.
I think a great number of your members would find something of the above
nature most useful.
These papers it is proposed to reprint in pamphlet form and they might
be sold for the benefit of the Illustration Fund ; they would form a first-
rate asset to the Society, for people who cannot afford to get all the back
volumes or do not want the bother of looking up the volume; or again
others who are not members but take an interest in our hobby might buy
these papers and get them bound separately.
I believe a number of our articles on different species that appear
from time to time might be made more useful if more space were given to
directions about feeding, etc. ; besides the long descriptions, which though
useful are rather tiresome reading, a small woodcut would answer the
purpose of making them much more interesting. I would like to suggest
that measurements of cages should be given where possible.
Later on if this plan now proposed works well we might have a few
papers describing the construction and erection of aviaries with a note of
the cost of material, this I am sure would be welcomed bv those who are
about to construct an aviary, besides a member often designs some little
contrivance which is quite an original idea, which would be most acceptable
to others who perhaps have not such a capacity for working out ideas.*

It is a male, which shows me that the coloured plate in our Magazine

defined collar on the upper part of the back, below the neck, of ' old ' gold
the forehead, face, and breast are a very beautiful emerald green, and the
whole of the shoulders and wing-coverts are silvery grey-green; being
much more extensive than in the coloured plate.

lacking the pink and grey patch 011 the head, etc.

and if so, why its sex was not mentioned.

Sir, -May I ask the assistance of a member of the Society in identi-
fying my Mocking Bird ? Until I saw what are written down as Saturnine
Mocking Birds at onr Zoological Gardens, in the Western Aviaries, I had
supposed him to be that; but he is larger and his underparts are pale sandy
buff; his upper parts brown, not at all grey&amp;apos;, and there is a very distinct
fawnish white stripe over the eyes, with a dark brown one through them
from the nostrils to the ears.
The greater and lesser wing coverts have each feather finely edged
with pale whitish fawn, and there is a spot of such colour at the extremity
of each feather; the secondaries are rather broadly edged with brownish
fawn, and the primaries with whitish.
The central tail feathers are brown, the outer ones white, with dark
brown bases.
I took him last year to the Natural History&amp;apos; Museum at South Ken-
sington, and on comparison with the skins there one certainly&amp;apos; thought him
to be Mimus saturnisms, but if those birds in the Western Aviaries are so,
lie is not.
Several of the Mocking Birds, and there are a goodly&amp;apos; number, bear a
strong family resemblance to each other, and skins in such a case are but
poor things bv which to identify a living bird, for all the shape and very
often half the colouring, has gone.
My bird is an inhabitant of Argentina, and a most gav and charming
songster. Hubert D. Astuey.

it; beyond fanning its tail it never betrayed any emotion when carried
about in an open cage or when a big dog smelt at it.
O. crassirosltis were much wilder. The}&amp;apos; seemed very hardy: I left
them in a large open aviary until November, and when taken in they both
accomplished a very rapid and complete moult. I never saw either species
touch anything bnt canary seed and paddy rice. When caged they would
not look at mealworms or any form of green food. In a large aviary--with
a good deal of natural food in it--it is hard to say exactly what they do eat.
I can answer for their biting power as they nearly cut pieces out of my
fingers when I was obliged to handle them. These are now in the New
Bird House in the Zoological Gardens, where I heard them singing on
Sunday last. E. G. B. MeadE-Wai,DO.

1. History. On the 15th of December 1840, the German
traveller, Ferdinand Werne, was asleep in the sudd-country south
of Lake No, and on awakening was told by his Berberine
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9735835625" page_id="32669147"  page_num="Page 191" year="" vol="">
hunters that they had seen an extraordinary bird, as big as a
young camel, with a bill like a Pelican's, though wanting a pouch.
This was apparently the first time the existence of the Shoebill
was made known to any European.
In 1848 Baron F. W. von Muller saw two of these birds
alive, but was unable to secure them. On his return to Khar-
toum he saw two skins of the Shoebill, for which a high price
was asked, in the possession of the Italian trader Nicola Ulivi;
these were eventually purchased by Mr. Mansfield Parkyns, of
Nottingham.
On the 14th of January, 1851, at a Meeting of the Zoological
Society of London, Prof, (afterwards Sir Richard) Owen being in
the chair, Mr. John Gould read a paper " O11 a new and most
remarkable form in Ornithology; " and for the " most extra-
ordinary bird" brought to England by Mr. Parkyns proposed the
generic name of Balaeniceps , and the specific name of Rex.

The bird being now known to the scientific world, and
wanted for museums, rewards were offered to the elephant hunters
of the White Nile to obtain specimens : but apparently no more
reached Khartoum till, in 1854, the French traders, de Malzac
and Vaissiere, who had been accompanied on the White Nile by
an experienced native collector of von Heuglin's, brought in five
skins, and about the same time the party of the traveller
Barthelemy obtained two more.
Two live Shoebills were purchased by the Zoological
Society of London in April i860 (P.Z.S. 1S60, p. 243) from Mr.
John Petlierick, trader and British Consul at Khartoum, who had
obtained them in the Sudan, having hatched them from eggs
" procured from the Raik negroes... .at a considerable distance
from Gaba Shambyl " ; these two were the survivors " out of six
Balaeniceps shipped at Khartoum, but perhaps out of a score
partially reared" (see P.Z.S. i860, pp. 195-199). These were the
first specimens of this most extraordinary bird ever brought
alive out of the Sudan and, as far as is known, no others have
been since, except the three individuals now living in the Giza
Zoological Gardens, which I brought down the Nile in 1902,
forty two years later than Petherick brought his and under much
easier circumstances.
Between 1854 and 1884 a certain number of skins of the
Shoebill were taken to Europe, but even now, in 1908, this bird
is one of the desiderata of many large museums.
The Mahdist insurrection closed the Sudan to scientific
research for many years, but after the final defeat of the dervishes
at Om Debrikat, 24th of November, 1899, Lord Cromer, who took
great interest in the zoology of the Sudan, suggested that in-
formation should be collected about this little-known and in-
teresting bird', and if possible a skin obtained.
On the morning of the 30th of March, 1900, while the Gun-
boat " Abu Klea " was exploring Lake Ambadi in the Bahr-el-
Ghazal, Mr. Cecil Crawley, with a .303 rifle, shot a Shoebill, which
I made a skin of: the work occupied nearly the whole day in a
damp heat of 97 0 Fahrenheit; this, presumably the first Shoebill
obtained by the present generation, was naturally an object of
great interest to all on board. The following afternoon a fire

on the Shoebill.

broke out on the " Abu Klea," but, owing to the well-disciplined
crew and soldiers on board, was fortunately extinguished before
any serious damage was done : the Shoebill skin had been hanging
to dry under the quarter-deck awnings, which were completely
burnt, and my relief can be imagined when it was subsequently
found, little the worse but for soot and water and scorched feet.
This skin eventually reached Cairo in safety, and Lord Cromer
had it mounted by Rowland Ward &amp; Co.
Other members of the same expedition, Capt. H. N. Dunn,
R.A.M.C. and Lieut. W. B. Drury, R.N. also succeeded in obtain-
ing specimens of the Shoebill; and in, I believe, the same year,
1900, the late Mr. W. G. Doggett shot some near Entebbe, in
Uganda.
When the Sudan Game Preservation Ordnance came into
force the Shoebill was, very properly, made a protected species,
and remains so; and the bird has also Government protection in
the territories of Uganda.
More than one person has told me that the Shoebill must
have been known to the ancient Egyptians, as it was represented
in.their mural paintings at Saklcara or Beni-Hassan. In the
former locality I have so far been unable to find any representa-
tion of a bird that could be referred to this species, the latter
locality I have had no opportunity of visiting.

2. Name. Throughout the animal kingdom there have
been, and are, great differences of opinion among specialists as
to the most correct scientific names for the various species; for-
tunately in the case of the subject of the present article, all
authorities appear to agree, and call the bird Balaeniceps rex:
Gould.
In English it is called the Shoebill or Wliale-headed Stork :
apparently no popular French name is in use as in Prof. Perrier's
recently published " La Vie des Animaux." Monsieur Julien
Salmon (" Les Oiseaux," II. p. 275) merely translates the scientific
name, calling the bird " Le Baldniceps roi." Its application in
German is " Der Scliuhschnabel."
Its Arabic name is " Abu markub," literally " Father of a
slipper" ; the upper mandible resembling in form, but inverted,

of London received two Shoebills in April, i860; one died soon
after its arrival. At the meeting of the Society on the 26th of
June, i860, W. K. Parker read a paper on its Osteology; the
second lived less than one year in London. At the meeting 011
the 26th of March, 1861, A. D. Bartlett referred to "the death of
the survivor of the two birds brought home by Mr. Consul
Petherick."
Over forty years passed without anyone having the oppor-
tunity of seeing one of these great birds in captivity; and then,
in the autumn of 1901, the late Col. W. S. Sparkes, C.M.G.,
brought one from the Bahr-el-Ghazal, where he had captured it
by tipping its wing with a rifle shot, alive to Khartoum, where it
is still living in the Governor General's Palace Garden, and is a
source of great interest to Sir Reginald and Lady Wingate and
their guests.
Early in 1902, the late Lieut. H. L. H. Fell, R.N., who had
been in command of the Gunboat "Abu Klea'' when we got the
skin of a Shoebill on Lake Ambadi in 1900, and had very kindly
promised to try to get me live specimens, obtained four nestlings
from natives on the Balir-el-Djur, in the Bahr-el-Ghazal province.
" One unfortunately died of suffocation, caused by a bunch of
threadworms passing up into its throat" (A. L. Butler, Ibis , 1905,
p. 376). Of the survivors Lieut. Fell presented two to the Giza
Zoological Gardens, and one to Maj.-Gen. Sir Rudolph von Slatin
Pasha, K.C.M.G., who was so good as to present his bird also to
the institution under my care.
Mr. A. L. Butler, Superintendent Sudan Game Preservation
Department, brought one of these birds down the White Nile to
Khartoum, and very kindly looked after all three of them in his
house there, till on the 15th of May, 1902, I was ready to leave
Khartoum for Cairo and took the Shoebills into my charge.
Four very good photographs of one of these young Shoe-
bills when in Khartoum, taken by Mr. W. L. S. Loat, at that time
Inspector of Nile Fish, were reproduced in Hutchinson &amp; Co.'s
"Animal Life," Vol. I., 1902-3, p. 159.

The journey from Khartoum North to Wadi Haifa by
goods train was more interesting than pleasant. The three Shoe-
bills were by 110 means my only care ; with the assistance of
some of the Egyptian keepers from Giza I had also to look after
four Giraffes, nine valuable Antelopes, a Nuer Ox, some Sheep
and Goats, a Lion, a Leopard, three Servals, a Caracal-Lynx, two
Chitas, two Genet-Cats, two Porcupines, an Ant-bear, an Eagle,
five Secretary Birds, four Geese, a Bralnniny Duck, four Cranes,
two Ostriches, five Tortoises and a Crocodile.
The truck in which the Slioebills (and I) travelled had a
single roof of corrugated iron, and became unpleasantly warm.
I do not know what the temperature rose to in that truck, but
the day we passed Berber I was told that the thermometer in the
shade was 118 0 Fahrenheit. The Shoebills required much coax-
ing to feed under the new conditions of a railway journey, and
repeatedly deposited their once, or more often, swallowed food
on the truck floor ; the result being that during the latter part of
the journey I was constantly reminded of the remark of Trincule
"a very ancient and fish-like smell."
By telegraphing beforehand I had tried to arrange for a
supply of fresh-caught Nile fish to be ready at the principal
stations near the river : on one stage no fish being forthcoming I
was reduced to feeding the Shoebills on tinned prawns.
At Wadi Haifa the ruminant animals (although in good
health and free from infection) were subjected to the formality of
twenty-one days quarantine ; so I left them with their keepers to
be fetched later, and with the remainder of my collection, in-
cluding the Shoebills, took steamer to Shellal (Aswan). From
Shellal we travelled by the narrow gauge railway to Luxor, and
from Luxor to Cairo comfortably by express train, reaching Giza
on the 28th of May, 1902; so that now (20th March, 1908) these
three Shoebills have been five years, nine months and twenty-
three days in captivity at the Giza Gardens, and fortunately
appear to be all still thriving.

(P.Z.S., p. 377) pointed out the affinity of the Shoebill to the
equally African Unibre Scopus. Mr. F. E. Beddard in 1888
(P.Z.S., p 284) wrote a very useful paper, which should be care-
fully read by all interested in the subject, on the affinities of this
bird, which he regarded "as a most aberrant Heron, having no
near affinities to the Storks nor to Scopus ."
Dr. Bowdler Sharpe in Volume XXVI. of the British
Museum Catalogue of Birds, and in his latest Handlist of Birds,
places the Shoebill the sole representative of the family Balaeni-
cipitidcie, between the Herons Ardeidae on the one hand, and the
U?nbre Scopidae and the Storks Ciconiidae on the other.
Personally I provisionally consider the Shoebill an aberrant
Heron, which in bygone ages, from what cause we know not,
having deviated from the ancestors of the modern Herons, Night
Herons and Egrets, has continued to develop on a line of its own
till it has reached its present extraordinary form. I11 the marshes
where it exists the peculiar conditions of the country allow of its
continuance, but it is easy to imagine how a geologically small
elevation of the earth's surface and consequent drainage of the
marshes would quickly cause the extinction of the species, now
too specialized to be able to adapt itself to changed conditions of
life.
However the anatomy and development of the Shoebill is
still not fully known, and I would be sorry to make a definite
statement of its affinities and systematic position without con-
sulting, which I have not had the opportunity of doing, Mr.
W. P. Pycraft who, in the last few years, has done so much to
place ornithology on a more scientific basis.
Mr. A. E. Butler in his excellent paper on the Ornithology
of the Egyptian Sudan (Ibis, July 1905, pp. 30T-403) gives far the
best account of the Shoebill yet published, and mentions a
specimen with " distinct, but irregular and not very deep, pec-
tinations on the middle claws," and thus concludes :--" In its
solitary nature, its motionless watching for its prey, and the
nature of its food, as in the colour of its plumage and the pre-
sence of ' powder-down ' patches, Balaeniceps is a Heron, though
an aberrant one, and seems to have little affinity with the Storks."

General. North Equatorial Africa, very local.
Particular. In the Egyptian Sudan the Shoebill is found in
the swamps of the Bahr-el-Ghazal, from Lake No to Lake
Ambadi, Meslira-el-Relc and the Bahr-el-Djur ; and also in the
somewhat similar swamps of the Bahr-el-Gebel between Lake No
and Schambe (See P.Z.S. 1900 p. 963).
Von Heuglin in 1873 pointed out that this bird would
probably be also found to occur in the swamp regions of the
Victoria Nyanza and Lake Chad ; I do not know if its occurrence
has been confirmed in this locality, but it has been so in the
Victoria Nyanza. Sir Henry Johnston, G.C.M.G. "The Uganda
Protectorate," 1904, I. p. 404) writes that Balae 7 iiceps is "quite
common in the creeks close to the Government station at
Entebbe," and adds in a footnote that he believes he has himself
seen (in 1882} this bird in the marshes of the Kunene in South
West Africa, and that Sir Henry Stanley asserts it is found on

high, but at times will stretch itself to almost five feet. The
extent from tip to tip of the wings of the specimen I measured
in the Bahr-el-Ghazal was eight feet and six inches.
The length from the point of the bill to the extremity of
the tail is given as about 46 inches in the British Museum
Catalogue. The female measured by A. L. Butler was 47 inches ;
the bird I measured was 51 inches, and Gould's type 52 inches.
It is possible there is a difference in size in the sexes. Von
Heuglin (" Ornithologie Nord-ost Afrika's," 1873, p. 1096) says:
" The male is considerably larger than the female."
The length from the point of the bill to the end of the
claw of the centre toe was 67 inches both in Gould's and in my
specimen.
The great bill in my specimen was nine inches in a straight
line from gape to tip, and the culmen ten inches following the
curve to the tip ; the width of the bill at the base following the
curve of the upper mandible was ten inches.
The wing is 26 to 30 inches in length; the tail 10 to 12^
inches; the tibia 13 to 15 inches; the tarsus 10 to 12J inches.

logue gives no idea of the beautiful colour of a live Slioebill. I
have noticed that visitors on seeing for the first time one of these
birds in the Giza Gardens frequently at once exclaim " What is
that beautiful blue bird ? " and then afterwards " What an extra-
ordinary large beak it has got." The colour being evidently the
most striking feature.
The followingdescription is drawn up from the three birds
now (March 1908) living at Giza.
General colour a lovely pale blue-grey, more blue than
grey in the sunlight, most of the feathers witli a narrow white
margin, the large feathers of the wings and tail are a slightly
darker blue-grey ; the under surfaces are paler than the upper,
the abdomen and under tail-coverts the lightest; the front and
sides of the neck are ornamented by elongated pale blue-grey
plumes with dark-grey .centres.
The bill is horn-coloured but streaked and spotted with
grey, almost of the same shade as the grey of the bird's feathers;
the legs and feet are bluish grey (black in skins); the claws are
black; the bare anterior space between the rami of the lower
mandible is pinkish grey.
Iris pale yellow : the white nictitating membrane is very
frequently passed over the surface of the eye.
The inside of the mouth and the little tongue are pink
flesh-colour.
A. L. Butler writes : " Nestlings are covered with grey
down of a fulvous tinge."

the Shoebills can be very noisy birds. Ours in captivity when
alarmed or angry utter a shrill kite-like cry; when pleased they
have a half-laughing, half-choking voice which may be rendered
" choua, choua, clioua, choua "; and they also indulge in bill-
snapping, making a regularly timed noise like the tapping sound
of a machine gun in action. As A. L. Butler says (in his Ibis
paper mentioned above) this clattering of the bill is " the only
Stork-like trait" which Balaeuiceps in captivity shews.

9. Habits. Very little is known for certain about its
habits ; the account in most books as, for instance, the " Royal
Natural History" (Vol. IV., pp. 303-4, 1895) is taken from
Heuglin, and even the late Prof. Newton in his " Dictionary of
Birds," p. 839, says that Petherick " discovered its mode of nidi-
fication." From Heuglin's own account it appears his informa-
tion about the Shoebill was mainly based on native reports, he
appears never to have himself examined a specimen alive or in
the flesh, and only to have observed a few in a wild state near
Rake Ambadi.
Pethericlc's account (P.Z.S. i860, pp. 195-198) is interesting
to read, but, I wish to remark, requires confirmation and, to quote
my clever old friend and former instructor the late Mr. A. D.
Bartlett, "I do so with considerable uneasiness lest I should be
accused of casting a doubt upon the veracity of the gentleman to
whom we are indebted for the first living specimens of this rare
bird" (see P.Z.S. 1861, p. 134).
In many pictures of Shoebills in books of natural history
and travel the bird is represented as walking in the water, a most
unusual thing for a Shoebill to do. Of over sixty specimens of
Balaeniceps that I have seen in a wild state, I do not recollect
seeing one in the water. A. R. Butler writes: " I never saw the
bird actually wading in water."
The Shoebills at Giza are kept in a large green paddock,
three hundred and twenty four and a quarter yards (296'5 metres)
in circumference, provided with a small pond and also a piece of
artificially swamped ground, when walking about they always
carefully avoid the swamp, deliberately walking round the dry
edge. In over five and a half years my wife and I have only
twice seen a Shoebill in the pond, and in eighteen months Mr.
M. J. Nicoll tells me he has only once seen the same sight; we
did not see the bird enter the pond, and think that most probably
011 each of these three occasions it had accidentally fallen in.
Of the Khartoum specimen Mr. A. R. Butler writes: "This in-
dividual shews no disposition whatever to enter water, and seems
to prefer the driest and sunniest spots in the garden."
The birds in captivity are very morose and somewhat
quarrelsome ; fierce fights have taken place between them, but

as a rule each Shoebill ignores the presence of the others, and all
three birds stand as far apart from each other as the limits of
their paddock allow.
The Shoebill is capable of inflicting a very powerful bite,
and is by no means a safe bird for a stranger ignorant of its ways
to approach, a fact which we often have to impress on amateur
photographers anxious to obtain "snap-shots" of Balaeniceps at
close quarters. It has been amusing to see how rapidly in some
cases their enthusiasm has waned, when (as requested) confronted
with the great bird screaming shrill defiance and crouching as if
about to spring, with gaping bill and half spread wings. On the
other hand, to known friends the Shoebill can make himself
quite amiable, and is evidently pleased by being taken notice of
and talked to.
The point of the upper mandible is used to preen the
feathers, and not, I believe, to open shell-fish as has been stated.
A. L. Butler believes "the stories about Balaeniceps crushing
shell-fish to be a myth."
In the Bahr-el-Ghazal we believe their food consists princi-
pally of fish, which forms their sole food in captivity. They
have, as before remarked, an unpleasant habit of disgorging their
food before finally swallowing and retaining it. Sometimes they
occupy themselves pretending to eat a twig or large leaf, re-
peatedly picking it up and dropping it again.
The solitary and shy habits of this bird in a wild state
have been noted by myself (P.Z.S., 1900, p. 963) and b} r A. L-
Butler (Ibis, 1905, p. 374, etc.) In captivity one of our birds will
occasionally perch on a low shrub in their paddock ; they are
not pinioned, but have some of the primary feathers of the left
wing periodically cut, at times the cutting not having been done
soon enough one or other of the birds has flown out of the
paddock, but on these occasions they have never attempted to
roost in the trees but have settled on other lawns in the Giza
Gardens and been recaptured by stalking and then running them
down before they had time to rise off the ground. I do not
suppose that this would be possible in a really fully winged bird,&amp;apos;
nor would the nature of the ground they frequent in a wild state
allow a man to run fast enough.

frequently seen the nests with young birds, on the plains inland
from the Jur, at the end of March and beginning of April. He
describes the nests as mere flattened-down spots in the high
grass on dry ground ; they were found singly and not in colonies,

THE CRESTED WOOD PARTRIDGE.
Rollulus roulroul.
By Hubert D. Asteey, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.

remarkable species sent me by Mr. Thorpe of Hedon, (near Hull),
last February, but I proceeded to consider myself exactly the
contrary when the hen bird died about a fortnight afterwards
from disease of the lungs, which she must have contracted on her
long journey from Borneo.
This Partridge--it is not of course a true Partridge--is
about the size of the Californian Quail, perhaps slightly larger.
The male is a lustrous blue black with deep purple and
green tints, 'reflections' they are styled, upon the lower back
and tail coverts. The bill is dark, not exactly black; being red
at the base of the lower mandible. The eyelids, and also the
bare flesh behind the eyes, are brilliant scarlet, broadly serrated,
and the legs and feet are red.
The wonderful crest, reminding one of the crest of the
Crowned Crane, is of a bright maroon chestnut.

Rev. Hubert D. Astrey,
The female lacks the crest, although it is there in embryo.
Her head and neck are dull dark grey, her whole body is a
subdued moss green, and the general effect of the entire wing is
chestnut. As a matter of fact the shoulders are that colour, the
wing coverts are chestnut finely barred with black or dark brown,
and the flight feathers have the inner webs dull chestnut brown,
and the outer ones, light chestnut, spotted with brown. The
liair-like bristles which spring from above the nostrils are very
developed in the male, arching over the head and touching the
forepart of the crest; but less so in the female. It is said that
FEMALE OF R. ROULROUL.
the young birds have a mixture of grey plumes in the breast ;
that is, full grown young ones ; that the legs and red colour of
the bill are much paler and more yellow, while the crest on the
head is not nearly so long or developed.
The egg of this species is of a dull yellowish white.
Diam. 1-25 inch. Axis. 1.55 inch.
This beautiful bird inhabits Borneo and Sumatra, the
mountainous districts in Sarawak, etc.
Lieut. H. R. Kelham mentions one that had been snared
by natives during his expedition on the Perak River in January,
1877. [ Vide Malay Ornithology, Ibis , Vol. of 1S81].
He also writes : --"Though not rare, this bird is seldom
" seen, being very shy, and on the approach of danger trusting to
"its legs rather than taking flight. All my specimens were
' snared in the neighbourhood of Kwala Kangsar."

"Captain Wardlaw Ramsay tells me he found it plentiful
" round Mount Ophir; and I saw several skins in Malaccan
"collections. These birds thrive well in confinement, but are
" not easily tamed ; some which were in my aviary for several
" months, were always wild, hiding directly any one appeared in
"sight; but early in the morning, when all was quiet, and they
" thought they were not observed, they used to come out of their
" hiding places and feed on rice and Indian corn."
There are two native names given, probably being different
in various districts. One is " Serookan," and Mr. C. Hose writing
on the Avifauna of Mt. Dulit and the Baram districts, gives the
name as ' Sengayan.' Whatever the native names may be, they
certainly cannot go further than the Latin title Rollulus roulroul /
What next?
My male bird seems strong and healthy, but bears out
Lieut. Kelham's description with regard to the shyness of the
species. I let him loose in my bird-room at one time, where
he scuttled about behind jugs and seed jars, etc., but in spite of
the flight feathers being clipped off, always went up to roost,
managing to fly on to a table and thence on to the top of a
cage.
When roosting on a bough, the short tail is tucked under
the rump, so that it almost touches the under tail-coverts.
The crest is immovable, and is composed of fine hair-like
feathers, forming a compact coronet, not like that of a Crowned
Pigeon, but as I have said, more resembling that of a Crowned
Crane. The whole form of the body is very round.
I have only heard my bird utter a soft note sounding like
'whit.' He eats seeds, but is very fond of banana and insec-
tivorous food.
It is to be hoped that another mate may be found for him,
though whether such shy birds would nest in captivity, is rather
doubtful.
I am uncertain if I am correct in giving this bird a nail on
the short hind toes: they seem to be rudimentary.

SUCCESSFUL BIRD-KEEPING IN CAGES.
By E. Warren Vernon.

<bodyText confidence="0.9987314" page_id="32669162"  page_num="Page 204" year="" vol="">
Seeing the letter from Mr. C. Barnby Smith re general
management of birds in confined spaces, I am encouraged to
offer a few hints on that subject, having had great success with
all these birds I now write of.
Although I do not like cages as a permanent habitation
for birds, still it is often an utter impossibility for one to keep
them either in aviaries or to give up a whole bird-room to them.
These suggestions may prove of use to those who, like myself,
often have to confine their pets in cages.
For single birds to commence with, such as the Shama,
Hangnest, Inca Jay, and such like, I use a cage of the following
dimensions:--Length, 30 inches; height, 16 inches; width, n
inches; door, 5 inches; wires half inch apart front and top;
wood, sides and back. I find air is fresher and the birds keep in
better health if top is open. Three perches only are given, made
to suit size of bird's foot; food tins or glass arranged so that the
food keeps clean, well away from perches. If fruit is eaten I use
an S-shaped wire, like this, to hang on to side of cage and hold
fruit up. The bird does not then get it messed through its
being on the ground.
A large bath, narrow and long, is given ; as nearly all birds
(but specially fruit eaters) require this every day.
Cages should be enamelled inside, tray and all, as then the
wet sand will not rot the wood, and the often offensive smell will
be avoided. I keep always an extra cage, into which the birds
are turned in rotation, so that their cages may be frequently
washed out with Jeyes' or other disinfectant fluid. The fronts
are all movable and every corner is easily got at.
For keeping several birds together I have two large cages.
Dimensions as follows :--the largest, in which are nine birds, is
length, 48 inches; height, 36 inches; breadth, 30 inches. A
division at 32 inches can be put up at will when cleaning or
catching one of the occupants. In this cage are swing perches
which I find all birds love. There is a food board six inches wide
on both ends, with glasses sunk in it for food and water. A big

bath is hung on the 7-inch door, and some fresh turf, put just
inside this door, prevents the water from splashing the board.
This cage is all wire. At night, if cold, a cloth is put over the
top. The following birds have been in it for six months and are
in the best of health :--Bronze-headed Troupial, Virginian Car-
dinal, Grey Bulbul, Red-cheeked Bulbul, Blue Tauager, Black
Tanager lieu, a pair of Crown Tanagers and a hen Marsh bird.
In the following description of cage there are: pair Superb
Tricolour Tanagers, pair Pekin Nightingales, and a Stonechat.
Length, 36 inches; height, 36 inches; breadth, 24 inches; all
wire ; swing perches ; four food glasses.
All the Fruit-eaters are fed the same, as much variety as
possible being given, and it is astonishing what funny things
they like. First, a very excellent soft food without egg--which
I find they eat heartily--sometimes mixed with sponge cake, at
others potato or grated carrot. Soaked sultanas and currants
they love, also boiled rice ; bread and butter they devour greedily,
in huge mouthfuls. Lettuce they like and eat it all ; of course
the usual fruit, orange, banana, and grapes ; flies, gentles, meal-
worms, even a garden worm is not despised. I notice that all my
Tanagers are partial to seed, eating oats and canary, which is put
for the Marsh Bird and Cardinal. I think keeping the cage
always spotlessly clean, with frequent scrubbing and Jeyes' disin-
fectant, a good supply of gravel and plenty of air, (as the cages
are put out of doors in a sheltered place whenever fine), accounts
for the birds doing so well.
Those birds which live alone, are, as a rule, let out for a
fly every day. They require exercise, and are quite well behaved,
returning to their cages for a mealworm at once.
Now as to the Waxbills: these have been kept in an
aviary cage and have done very well indeed. It is an ordinary
Crystal Palace three-dome cage, the middle dome being filled
with rush nests, in which four or five sleep together. They
are a mixed lot : I have Cordon Bleus, Orange Breasts, St. Helena,
Cape and African Waxbills, with one Lined Finch, one Fire Red,
and one Violet-backed Spermophila ; also a lovely pair of Pintailed
Nonpareils. At present the latter, although so crowded, are busy
trying to nest.

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
These birds are fed on canary, red- white- Indian- and
spray-millet, rice in the ear, soft food, lots of grit, sand, and
cuttle fish, plenty of lettuce and grass seed and the sweepings
of the hay-loft. Last year I reared, out of doors, two Green
Avadavats, three Orange-breasts and three Cordon Bletis. I
hope to turn them out later on, but they certainly do well enough
in a cage.
One thing I feel sure about, and that is, although all these
foreign birds may do all right and survive the cold out of doors
in England, they do not like it; and if I turned my South
American birds out, I would have a part heated in the aviary,
into which they could go at pleasure. I think it must feel rather
as it would to us, if we were put down suddenly in our ever}&amp;apos;
day clothes, say in Lapland, and were expected to keep warm
and comfy with no extra heat. After all, one should consider the
natural climate of these birds--moist heat; surely no frosts, or if
so, the&amp;gt;&amp;apos; are able to fly&amp;apos; farther south and avoid them. Here what
can they do to get away from the cold unless some place is made
for them. I have had mine in a large Conservatory, kept just
above freezing, and all this winter they have sung and seemingly
enjoyed life. I do not for one moment say they do not live in
the cold, as so many have kept them, I only say I am sure they
cannot prefer it.
THE BLACK-CHEEKED LOVEBIRD.
Agat&amp;gt;or?iis nigrigenis.
It may be of interest to some of our readers to know that
a small consignment of this little-known Lovebird reached the
London market this April. So far as I understand the matter,
there are, or were until quite recently, only two skins in exist-
ence, bothofwhich are in South Africa. The bird was discovered
as recently as September, 1904, and is known only from two of
the northern tributaries of the Zambesi. The official description
of the species has been kindly supplied to me, and is as follows :--

Bill rosy-red, paler, almost white at the base; legs brown (in
skin). Length (in skin) 6.25 inches, wings 3.6, tail 1.6, culmeu
.62, tarsus .50.
The female has the front of the head dusky rather than
sienna-brown, and this colour does not extend as far back as in
the case of the original specimen.
Hab. Muguazi River, North-west Rhodesia.
The arrival in this country of not less than five living
examples of Nigrigenis, some of them adults, alters the aspect of
affairs : we can now see (1) That both of the specimens described
above were immature ; (2) That, as was to be expected, the sexes
are probably alike or very nearly so.
As regards the sexes, it is not impossible that all five of
the new arrivals should be males ; I certainly thought that I
detected one female, but I may have been mistaken. But, even
so, it is exceedingly unlikely that any sexual difference in this
class of Agapornis would be indicated in the manner suggested
above.
Even now, I feel that we must proceed warily, in some
respects tentatively. A further examination of my two adults--
I am more than ever satisfied that they are a pair--whilst reveal-
ing points of difference between the two birds, tells me also that
the male is older than the female, and that both are changing tail
feathers or replacing lost ones. Which of the differences are to
be attributed to age, and which, if any, to sex? I have also an
immature male shewing a third stage in the plumage. How are
we to fit in these three stages with the two described by Mr.
W. L. Sclater ? what is the sequence ?
I can only suggest as follows :--(1) The young bird, re-
presented by Mr. Sclater's " female " ; (2) An older but immature
bird, represented by the original specimen, which the discoverer

Mr. Reginald Phieeipps,
did not sex, or could not because too immature ; (3) My im-
mature male ; (4) My female ; (5) My adult male.
Here I may mention that, in all the living specimens I
saw, the under parts were lighter and of a yellowish green ; a
conspicuous white orbital ring, round in front but pointed behind,
perhaps less so and rounder in the female than in the male ; feet
and claws whitish ; and cere white, narrow in the immature bird
with the nostrils hidden, deeper in the adult with the nostrils left
fully exposed by the receding feathers of the forehead.
Adult male: --Generally as per type, but in a good light
with the green above flecked with blue, while below it is yellow-
green, with washes of yellow on flanks, and with the ventral
region yellowish ; the "olive" of the type is more than a tinge,
and extends at least half way down the sides of the neck, where
it meets and partly envelops the ends of the patch of salmon-
red ; the latter is more conspicuous than is suggested by the
description, and is inclined to salmon-pink ; the sienna-brown
occupies rather more of the crown than the front half, and meets
the deep blackish-brown (perhaps quite black below) of ear-coverts
and upper face opposite to the hind and front corners of the eye
--in my other specimens, the colours intermingle at these points,
especially in the front. Quills--above, inner webs black or nearly
so, outer green ; below, with a good deal of blue wash on the
secondaries. Edge of wing green, with a nearly parallel stripe of
blackish on the under coverts; larger under wing-coverts clear
light blue-gray. Upper aspect of tail as usually carried, green
at base, then a broad wash or shade of dark green, tips lighter ;
the tip of every feather fades into a light blue-green wash, almost
white at the point; central pair of feathers green with sub-
terminal wash of darker ; four lateral feathers with a broad patch
of red (? light or yellow vermilion) near base, each patch being
encompassed by a narrow baud of light green ; then some blue
wash, succeeded by the usual patch of black ; then blue again,
and more of it, but too ill-defined to be called a patch ; then the
light tip. The outer pair shew red and black, perhaps as in
female, but I have the note " outer web blue." The general view
of the outspread tail of this bird, below as well as above, reveals
considerably more blue and bluish than I have mentioned--it

seems rather indefinable. Iris dark yellow-brown ; cere broad,
with the nostrils fully exposed. Head broad " between the
eyes."
Female (a younger bird, as evidenced by the narrower cere,
one nostril being hidden, the other partly exposed):--Generally
like the male but smaller, less bulky, more timid and gentle, and
with narrower head ; iris pale yellow-brown (much lighter than
in adult male) ; quills, below, strongly washed with blue along
inner edges, except (I think) the first primary which is brown ;
under wing-coverts green, with the larger ones dirty smudgy
whitish ; edge of wing partly yellow. The tail as in the male
but with much less appearance of blue, and this below inclined
to pale slate-gray ; on the outside feather, the red encroaches on
to the outer web but the black does not; a " dark green stripe
on outer web," i.e., running up the centre of the web parallel
with the shaft, and not including the whole breadth of the web;
tips of tail feathers as in the male but more inclined to yellow-
green, and, I think, not extending to the outer web of the outer
pair.
Immature male :--Generally like the adult male, but
smaller. Upper aspect of whole tail with more of the dark
green shade, and tail tips light yellow green fading into whitish ;
middle pair in other respects dark green ; the next four pairs
with the broad patch of red running up the centre and succeeded
by the usual subterminal black band of Agapornis --no mere
dusky spot as in the original specimen; on the outer pair, the
red and black are confined to the inner web, the outer being dark
green tipped with lighter. The blue, which was conspicuous in
the adult male and well represented in the female, was not
noticed in this example. Ouills, inner webs dusky, outer green--
the blue wash below was not noticed; an ill-defined streak of
\0x25A0bluish or blackish, about parallel with the wing-edge, on the
green under wing-coverts. Cere narrow, with nostrils entirely
\0x25A0concealed. By an unfortunate oversight, the iris was not
inspected.
The foregoing descriptions are inadequate in some respects,
.and some points need further examination ; but it is difficult and
a very serious matter to make a detailed examination of a living

and very nervous subject. As it is, I have broken a tail feather,
a sacrifice which I would not willingly have made to please any-
body, so I handle my birds no more yet awhile. I trust that
some other pen will describe the remaining two--or more, if
there are more--living examples now in this country.
The calls and cries are not identical with but are like to
those of the Rosy-faced species (A roseicollis), the accompanying
automaton-like flick of the tail being equally conspicuous when
the bird is excited.
It is a lively bright little fellow, and, although very nervous
after its terribly long journey, shews a disposition to be friendly
and even familiar.
I fear that it is a little bit inclined to be " wicked" ; let us
hope that it is not quite so bad as A. ca?ia.

THE MIND OF A BIRD.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
Darwin has very justly remarked (Descent of Man, 2nd ed.
p. 114) " It is a significant fact, that the more the habits of any
particular animal are studied by a naturalist, the more he attri-
butes to reason and the less to unlearnt instincts." I take it that
the chief difference between reason and instinct is that the first
quickly solves a difficulty and the second represents a solution
arrived at through the experience of numerous generations, and
inherited. An instance of the former was related to me many
years ago by the artist--Mr. George Ford : When with Sir
Andrew Smith in South Africa an experiment was tried with a
dog and a monkey, both chained up by a collar round the neck, in
a yard ; a bone was placed out of reach of the dog, and a plantain
(if I remember rightly) out of reach of the monkey ; the former
simply struggled against its collar and barked, when it could not
reach its bone ; but the monkey having run the length of its
chain, and finding the desired dainty still beyond its reach,
immediately turned round, adding the length of its body to the
chain, and grasped the food with its hind foot. On the other
hand instinct is represented by the manner in which birds of

different families normally build tlieir nests; inherited habit
which obtains, as I have shewn, even after a lapse of hundreds
of years of domestication, during which time the natural instinct
has been in abeyance.
When a bird alters its method of building, there is always
a reason for the change. It is obvious that, in a crowded aviary,
where many birds may desire to nest simultaneously, it is an
advantage for many birds to build in boxes or prepared Hartz
travelling-cages, rather than in open bushes; in the former there
is only a front entrance to defend ; in the latter the owner of the
nest maybe molested from all sides. This is why, in my opinion,
many of the small finches prefer to build in such receptacles,
when associated with many other birds.
Even in their wild state various species of birds surround
their nests, with the exception of a narrow entry, with thorny
twigs; which offer a formidable protection against the inroads of
marauding enemies. Others, as recorded in various works by
travellers in different parts of the tropics, build their nests close
to the homes of particularly venomous wasps. In these cases,
however, we have inherited reason, which has therefore been
called instinct.
That birds differ considerably in their reasoning powers is
an unquestionable fact, the English House Sparrow being one of
the most weak-minded ; whereas some of the Crows, the Hang-
nests ( Icterus) and the Parrots, are among the most keen-witted.
In 1877 I wrote to Charles Darwin respecting a pair of
House-Sparrows which persisted in building their nest in a roller-
blind. Every morning the blind was lowered to shade the room
from the sun and the nest fell to the ground ; but no sooner was
the blind drawn up again than all the rubbish was replaced.
This continued for nearly a month, and it was only after two or
three wet days, which had enabled the birds to make considerable
progress, when the lowering of the blind again threw out the
materials, that they were convinced of the futility of their efforts.
Darwin's reply to my letter is published in " British Birds with
their Nests and Eggs," vol. II., p. 87. On another occasion I
watched a female Passer domestictis attempting, for two hours, to
persuade a quill-feather, of probably a goose, to remain by itself

Dr. A. G. Butler,
(as a foundation for its nest) across the branch of a tree; of
course the moment the bird let go of the feather to seek fresh
materials, over it fell to the ground, and was immediately retrieved
and replaced, only again to fall.
On the other hand a Hangnest confined in a cage
immediately begins to examine the fastenings of the door; if
this is kept closed by a simple hook and eye, it will probe about
with its long bill and try its utmost to lift the hook; and. no
sooner is this done, than the bird pushes the door open and
escapes ; I well know, to my cost, how extremely difficult so
intelligent a bird is to capture with a net; it seems thoroughly
to enjoy one's discomfiture as it conceals itself behind some
heavy cage, and then, while one is shifting the latter, slips out
at the opposite side and is hidden on the top of some shelf
yards away, before one can turn round.
My English Jay always expects me to play with him when
I give him his food in the morning; I have to put my finger
through the wire of his cage and he makes a dig at it with his
bill, aiming at the wire close to my finger, as though he were
aware that by striking at my digit he might cause pain. Of
course I have to pretend to be alarmed and draw away my finger
hurriedly ; then he turns partly round and pretends not to be
looking, but as my finger remains he suddenly whirls round
upon it; often he even takes a short hop towards his food and
then spins round at me: feinting is evidently a fighting-trick
quite understood by this bird.
It would not be supposed that a predaceous bird like a Jay
would show any sympathy for the troubles of other species, much
less that it would exhibit magnanimity towards small birds, yet
this seems to be the case with my hand-reared bird :--The
Mocking-bird which I now have was the old and valued com-
panion of a lady, who, being about to travel, offered the bird to
me ; since its arrival it has been in my possession about eight
years. From old age this bird's feet are much distorted, the toes
crumpled or wanting to some extent on each foot, in consequence
of which they sometimes become clogged and " balled" with dirt.
When this happens, of course I have to catch the bird out of his
flight-cage, and my Jay not understanding that my object in

<bodyText confidence="0.999250358974359" page_id="32669171"  page_num="Page 213" year="" vol="">
catching the Mocking-bird is a benevolent one, always becomes
terribly angry and scolds me in his harsh natural cry until the
patient has been restored to its cage. He becomes equally angry
if my exceedingly wild hybrid Blackbird rattles about when I am
changing its food.
With regard to the magnanimity of this bird I am a little
more doubtful ; but it is a significant fact that although ex-
tremely fond of dining upon small birds which have died through
egg-binding or have been killed by others ; when, on more than
one occasion, House Sparrows have found their way into my
conservatory and have flown into his cage, he has not made the
least attempt to molest them, but has remained on a top perch
until they have found their way out again : nevertheless I think
it possible that if a living sparrow were held in the hand and
offered to him he would be unable to resist seizing it as he would
a dead one.
All birds with any intelligence are extremely jealous of
attentions paid to their neighbours ; and if one pretends to ignore
them will do their utmost, by song, speech, or cries, to direct
attention to themselves; my Jay will even pick up stones and
throw them from one of his perches through the wire, or he will
drop to the floor of the cage, come to the front and repeatedly
call "Jimmy!" until he is taken notice of.
Fear of cats is instinctive in many birds, and the asso-
ciation of certain sounds with the presence of a cat is sometimes
so: thus, although my Jay was hand-reared from the nest and
had never seen a cat until he came into my possession ; yet the
first time he caught sight of one on the aviary outside my
conservatory, he uttered his harsh alarm-cry, raised his crest and
flew backwards and forwards between his perches in the greatest
terror. After a short time he learned to imitate the miau of a
cat in pain, to perfection ; and now, if after uttering his alarm-
note, he still sees the beast on the aviary he growls like cats
fighting.
The late Mr. Abrahams once possessed a Spotted Bower-
bird, eventually purchased by the Zoological Society, which
when asked " Where's the cat ?" or if one called " Puss, Puss ! "
immediately began to mew; this bird therefore also associated
the idea of the beast with its cry.

on the Mind of a Bird.
Darwin says :--" It is certain that some Parrots, which have
been taught to speak, connect unerringly words with things, and
persons with events." I know that an Amazon Parrot which we
had some years ago, whenever it saw my wife in her bonnet,
would ask--" Are you going out? " "Yes" my wife would reply.
"Are you going in the park?" "Very likely" would be the
answer. " There's a cat in the park" was always the last remark
of the bird.
My Grey Parrot used to know us all by name, and call to
us when it caught sight of any of us, never confusing one with
the other: but, talking of the connection of sounds and things,
my Jay always imitates the sound of seed being poured into a
tin, when he sees me with a tin of seed or insectivorous food in
my hands.
Undoubtedly association with mankind has a marvellous
effect in brightening up the intellect of birds, and this is
especially noticeable with hand-reared birds which are not
allowed to mix with others : thus a hand-reared Pied Wagtail
used to delight in children's games such as "Hide and Seek"
and " Touch," and played the games with as much intelligence
as a child.
Two hand-reared Canaries which we had at different times
would play the first game (which, after all, even wild birds play
at among themselves) but they never had the sense to play at
" Touch." The same Wagtail had such an abnormal variety of
notes that he could express his feelings almost as clearly as if he
had used articulate language. A House-Martin which I hand-
reared used to tumble out of bed in a cocoanut-shell, and fly
from his cage to nestle down in my hand, every evening when I
returned from town and called to him; and my Blue-bearded Jay
flies to the end of his cage and hangs on the wire with his crest
up directly I call "Jack!" though he is not hand-reared, but
has only learned to trust me by degrees.
The strange thing is,--that hand-reared birds although so
tame that they will fly from one person to another when called,
if they are turned loose among other birds, frequently become
far more wild than if they had been trapped when adult: the
presence of the person upon whose hand, head, or shoulder they

previously sat contentedly and without the least nervousness,
now drives them perfectly frantic with terror; so that one is
almost persuaded that the other birds in the aviary must have
been maligning one to them. Yet some species (such as the
Blue-Tit and the Siskin), remain as tame as before and fly to
their owner directly he enters the aviary. Birds bred in aviaries
are sometimes far more terrified of their owners than those
caught wild, but not invariabl)'.
I cannot do better than sum up in the words of the great
teacher with whose remarks I began this article. Speaking of
man and the higher animals he says:--"All have the same
senses, intuitions and sensations,--similar passions, affections,
and emotions, even the more complex ones, such as jealousy,
suspicion, emulation, gratitude, and magnanimity; they practice
deceit and are revengeful; they are sometimes susceptible to
ridicule, and even have a sense of humour ; they feel wonder
and curiosity; they possess the same faculties of imitation,
attention, deliberation, choice, memory, imagination, the
association of ideas, and reason, though in very different degrees."

out to under- rattier than over-colour the plates, so that there is

birds; for this reason we much prefer the photogravures.

The April number includes an interesting article on the
Breeding Habits of the Common Bittern, by E. W. Wade.
Messrs. H. F. Witherby and N. F. Ticehurst write respecting the
spread of the Little Owl from the chief centres of its introduction
into the British Islands; they also continue their account of the
more important additions to our knowledge of British Birds since
1899, and Mr. W. P. Pycraft has an admirable article (with illus-
tration of the breast, with some feathers removed to show the
patch of " powder-down " feathers) entitled " The ' Powder-down'
of the Heron." Among the notes is an interesting one, with
illustration, of a Swallow's nest built on a glass gas-shade; and
a second of a Martin's nest built 011 a window-pane ; these nests
being presumably attached to the glass by means of sticky saliva
secreted by glands as in the Edible Swift. The White-winged
Lark is recorded as having been shot on the first day of the
present year at Pevensey Sluice, Sussex, and is illustrated by a

Sir,--A friend of mine in Nepanl lias sent me over recently amongst
other birds, four liill-partridges ( Arboricol-ct iorqueola). These are charming
little birds--three of them orange-throated and the fourth, a larger bird,
white-throated.
I should like to know if the last named is a different variety, or is the
difference merely one of sex or age ?
All the birds seem very fond of perching, and at present I have them
in a run, with a pair of Crimson Tragopan pheasants, where there are
several fir-trees, also some grass, a little brushwood, etc. I feed on small
seeds--chiefly dari, and give maggots occasionally. Can this be improved
upon? I should also be glad to know if these birds are hardy in winter,-
with the shelter of a wooden shed; also, if they are likely to breed, and
whether the young require any special treatment.
It may interest some of your readers to hear that my Partridge--
Tinamous (Noihoprocla perdicaria ), about which a note appeared in the
Avicultural Magazine for last June, have proved able to stand the winter
well: indeed they seem quite regardless of cold. No artificial heat has been
given, and though I have done my best to induce them to take shelter, they
often insist on being outside in awful weather. They have flourished and
grown fat on small seeds and grass; and, to my surprise, very little insect
food seems necessary for their well-being. At present I have not seen any
signs of breeding. C. Barnby-SmiTh.

After producing hybrid Ouzels for two years in succession--1905 and
1906, I turned the hen Blackbird loose in the garden. It would seem that
she must have paired with an English Blackbird in 1907 and reared young
which have inherited characteristics of her previous mate--the Grey-winged
Ouzel. This year a Blackbird is to be daily seen in the garden accompanied
by a hen ; he is practically indistinguishable from the male hybrids which I
produced in 1906, having the same red-brown patch on the wings: the odd
thing, however, is that he sings like my Grev-winged Ouzel.

Three days' later (February 12th) another was laid, the second following
on the 14th. Both eggs were hatched on the morning of the 26th. I saw
the young about 9.30 a.ui., they looked some hours old and had been fed by
their parents. This makes the duration of incubation twelve days; but I
thought I would wait and see the result of the next nest.
The birds laid again on the 17th and 19th of March ; I was away when
these eggs hatched, but I had left word that the nest was to be closely
watched, and on the 31st (again the 12th day after the laying of the second
egg) both eggs were found to be hatched, one eggshell was picked up in the
flight quite dry, shewing the young had been out some time, as early as
7.30 a.m., so that hatching may actually have taken place the previous day.
I think it is not a little remarkable that such large birds should sit
for so short a time ; the only other Turtle-dove, as I have already pointed
out, that I have known to hatch in twelve days is the Half-collared Turtle
(Turtur semitorqualus), so that size seems to have little to do with it, in fact
the larger species seem to take less time.
The birds have to-day (15th April) just started sitting for the fourth
time this year. T. H. Newman.
Sir, --My Ravens are now bringing up five fine young birds in their
nest in one of my aviaries ; and I shall be happy to give a young one to
any member of our .Society who can give it a good home in the country.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and post-
age paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, Rauherne, Bexley Heath, Kent, and must be
accomoanied by a letter containing: the fullest particulars of the case, and a fee
of 1 /- for each bird. If a reply by post is required a fee of 2 16 must be enclosed.
Domestic poultry, pigeons and Canaries can only be reported on by post.
Pekin Robin. (Mr. Isaac). The bird died of apoplexy.
Lovebird. (Miss Douglas). The bird has suffered with disease of the

Rallus abbotti.
By E. G. B. Meade-Waldo.
The subject of this picture was taken on March 12th,
1906, on Assumption Island, South Indian Ocean. We landed
on this island, which is situated about 300 miles N.W. of Mada-
gascar, about 10 a.m., and after passing over the beach of white
coral sand on which many huge edible turtles were wandering
about, we entered the edge of the scrub and were immediately
greeted by squeals and grunts--a voice strongly resembling that
of our own Water Rails,--and presently several of these White-
throated Rails appeared round us, craning their necks and com-
ing quite close. I picked up one in a butterfly net, which is the
individual figured.
During the two days spent on this island we saw numbers
of these rails, which are evidently very common. They were
not easy to catch, not owing to being wild, but owing to the
extremely thick scrub which they frequented and in which they
climbed about freely. We also saw broods of black young ones.
Assumption Island is uninhabited ; it is some four miles long,
about two miles in width, and the shape of a bean with the
hollow to the South. It has a fringe of very thick scrub all
along the leeward side, and the rest of the island is covered with
grass, bushes, and some scattered trees, mostly Hibiscus. The
island is of ancient coral formation and, with the exception of
some sand-hills about 60 feet high, only slightly raised above
high water mark.
The two rails we caught were easily kept: they would

eat almost anything at once, but did not become, nor are they yet
(two years afterwards) any more familiar than they were on their
native island. They have well developed wings, but do not
appear to fly, although they can do so, as I have seen the in-
dividuals in the Western Aviary, Zoological Gardens, perched
on the highest perches. This rail is peculiar to the Island of
Assumption, and although closely resembling it, is quite distinct
from the rail of Aldabra Island, only some 40 miles away. There
appeared to be 110 springs of fresh water on Assumption, with the
exception of numerous puddles of rain water, but as there are
several land birds, viz., a dove, a ground cuckoo, and a Sunbird,
all peculiar to the Island, the supply must be a constant one.
The numbers of this rail are probably kept in check by rats, of
which we saw a few, and also the cocoa-nut crab (Birgas latro )
of which there appear to be a fair number. The two rails that
we brought back to England on the "Valhalla" would certainly
have bred had they not both been of the same sex.

The following is the account given by Mr. M. J. Nicoll in
his extremely interesting work " Three Voyages of a Naturalist "
which, as it enters somewhat more fully into the notes of the
bird than in Mr. Meado-Waldo's article, may I think be repro-
duced here with benefit to our readers ; he says pp. 10S, 109 and

" On first entering the belt of trees and low bushes which
fringes the shore, we were greeted by a chorus of squeals and
grunts, as though a litter of pigs were hidden in the cover. This
remarkable noise proceeded from a number of rails,* birds much
like our water-rail but rather more stoutly built, and with wine-
red breasts, barred on the flanks and belly with black and white.
These rails were very tame, and walked about close to us in a
perfectly unconcerned manner. We never saw one of them fly,
or even try to do so : they trusted entirely to their legs when
pursued. In several patches of bush we came across family
parties of them, and although the young were mostly full-grown
and feathered, we saw several which were still covered with black
down. They were found 011 all parts of the island, except on

the summit of the sandy hill on the windward side. While
uttering its remarkable note, this rail stands quite still and puffs
out all its feathers ; from wliat I observed I should say that the
skin of the throat is also expanded. The notes are loud--a
strange mixture of squealing, grunting and booming--and during
its song the bird appears to be gradually collapsing, until at the
end it is once more of normal size. I have heard our English
water-rail utter a somewhat similar noise when near its nest, but
its cries are never so loud as those of the Assumption rail. We
caught two of them alive and brought them safely to England,
and they are at the time I write living in the London Zoological

It lias often struck me as strange that, comparatively
speaking, so few lovers of bird-life visit a country so wonderfully
rich in bird-life.
I myself have been to Iceland a good deal, but must plead
guilty to not having gained as much information as I ought to
have done, partly owing to my lack of knowledge of ornithology
and partly owing to the fact that when in Iceland my attention
lias been devoted almost exclusively to trout--and the rule holds
good here as elsewhere that one only sees in a country what one
goes to see.
However, I have noticed one or two interesting birds, and
the tameness of some of them is surprising. On my last visit
three years ago, I got a splendid opportunity of watching the
Great Northern Diver. A friend and I landed for lunch on a
little rocky islet, in the midst of a large lake; and this islet had
evidently been a nesting place for the Great Northern Diver.

Mr. C. Barnby Smith,
One of the old birds greatly resented our approach, and
with loud shrieks and repeated divings, tried to lure us away.
When we left the islet and took to our boat the bird kept
repeatedly diving and coming up fairly near the boat (but always
further away from the islet) and gave us grand opportunities for
observation, though we never managed to find any young birds.
The Red-necked Phalarope is to my mind one of the most
interesting birds to be seen, and it is in certain districts quite
common. I have often watched these birds with much interest
when they were flitting about on the edge of lake or stream, or
(as they are very fond of doing) riding on the water whilst
picking up insects that fell from the overhanging banks. On one
occasion my guide actually caught one in my landing net. This
bird was possibly a young bird though it looked full grown.
These Phalaropes will often rest on the water without showing
the least alarm whilst a large trout fly is repeatedly thrown close
to the spot. I have&amp;apos;never seen a nest and should much like
to find one.
The most noticeable bird to the casual observer is the
Whimbrel. These birds swarm on the moors near the sea in the
summer and their weird cry " tetty-tetty-tetty-tetty-tet " accom-
panies one everywhere. They are very wary however. If some
enterprising member of the Avicultural Societ}&amp;apos; would solve the
problem as to how to keep these birds in health when in
captivity, we should many of us, I feel sure, be grateful.
I am told that the Curlew does not breed in Iceland which
seems strange as it is apparently a most suitable country.
I suppose most people going to Iceland for the first time
expect to see Eider Duck everywhere. They will probably be
disappointed as these birds move off their breeding haunts early
in the season, and though the islands of "Engey " and " Videy"
in Reykjavik Bay are full of Eider Duck in the Icelandic spring,
there are comparatively few birds to be seen there later in the
season.
Other Ducks in endless variety are common where there is
water for them. The one that I have found most interesting is
the Harlequin Duck. As soon as the ducks nest the drakes pack
together for some considerable time and form a very striking

spectacle when flying up and down over the torrent-like rivers or
settling on the banks. They seem to prefer fast running water.
At the same time one may see the old ducks piloting fleets of
young ones in a wonderful way 011 the edge of the rapids.
I cannot find from enquiry that the Harlequin Duck has
ever been kept in captivity or semi-captivity in this country.
The drakes are most exquisitely beautiful birds and if no serious
attempt to keep them has been made it surely would be worth
while for some expert to try. Probably the food would be the
main difficulty though some birds have great capacity for chang-
ing their food. Can anyone speak as to the Harlequin Duck?
Possibly the best way of attempting the matter would be to bring
over fresh eggs to hatch here. If so, I may mention, as a personal
note, that I am starting in the second week in June for the
neighbourhood of Myvatn, in the North of Iceland, where
Harlequin Ducks nest and I would gladly try to bring back some
fresh eggs with me in July if any member of the Avicultural
Society, who is an expert with wild fowl, would care to make the
attempt to hatch and rear the birds in the interests of
aviculture.
I have been told that I have twice seen the " great" or
" solitary " Snipe in an Icelandic "forest," though I must say
that I thought the bird was in each case a Woodcock. How-
ever there are said to be no Woodcock in Iceland. The Common
Snipe is not so plentiful as one would expect even in suitable
localities.
The Icelandic Grouse now exists in sadly diminished
numbers. These birds, even in the South, in August often show
a good deal of white in the plumage. Whether these grouse
could be successfully kept in England is an interesting question.
Perhaps some game expert will give his views.* 1
Golden Plover breed in Iceland in immense numbers, but I
have never seen the Grey Plover. It is curious to note that the
Golden Plover always settle on the home-field of an Icelandic
Farm in preference to open moorland. I suppose they find more
food. In August they are absurdly tame. The Ringed Plover is

Mr. Allen Silver,
another most interesting breeder in Iceland. The Raveti is very
common in the districts where I have been and is much
harrassed by farmers owing to the birds attacking young lambs.
All the Richardson Skuas that I have noticed were of the
dark form--indeed of such dark brown as to appear almost
black. These birds are very common.
The above notes only mention a very few of the many
interesting birds to be seen in Iceland. For the bird lover who
knows his subject the island must be a splendid field for observa-
tion. Moreover there must be many birds which could be
brought from there to be kept in captivity in England and which
in our uncertain climate should be easier to keep in health than
birds imported from semi-tropical countries.

THE. WALL CREEPER.
Tichodrovia niuraria.
By Allen Silver.
A hurried search through the indices of our Magazine
reveals only about one previous reference to this extremely
interesting bird. On page 215, Vol. 1, N.S., No. 6, a list of birds
exhibited for the first time at the Zoo is given, and from that we
learn that two examples were to be seen there on Feb. 4th, 1902.
The only living specimen I have had the opportunity to
observe in captivity was one, until quite recently, in the possession
of my friend, Mr. C. T. Maxwell, of Brixtou (who was at one
time a member), and owing to his kindness I have been able to
closely follow this bird's behaviour since he acquired it.
Those who are familiar with its relative, the Tree Creeper,
as a cage bird, know quite well that, at its best, it is a fragile and
somewhat difficult subject for aviculture ; but, as far as one can
judge from a comparatively short acquaintance, extending over
some six or eight months, the Wall Creeper can hardly be
described as sharing the same disadvantages, for in many of its
characters it resembles the Nuthatch., and provided one could,
acquire an immature specimen and keep it under suitable con-
ditions, I see no reason why such a bird should not thrive

satisfactorily for three or four years in captivity. My first in-
troduction to the bird was soon after its arrival in this country
last year: although it was by no means wild, it was exceed-
ingly energetic, and the way in which it scrambled about over
and under the cork bark fixed up in its cage was, to say the
least, extraordinary. In spite of this, it always kept itself in
excellent condition until the day of its death, and upon examin-
ing it, as I write these lines, I can hardly detect a frayed feather
in the whole plumage. Its death was somewhat disappointing,
as the bird was just assuming its black throat, but during its
whole career it seemed never to have an hour's illness, and in
fact the owner was inclined to look upon it as anything but a
troublesome bird to keep. Its food consisted of the usual in-
sectivorous mixture, which was supplemented by a little raw
meat, mealworms and other live creatures, and it was kept (for
convenience sake) in a cage not more than 30 inches long, 18
inches high and 12 inches deep.
As far as one could judge, I should imagine it was a well-
matured bird when received, and as it only became indisposed just
previous to death, it is just possible its end may not have been
untimely. I, unfortunately, have no account of how long it had
been kept in Germany, but the tarsi were heavily scaled in front;
much more so than would have been the case in a young bird ;
and, as its keeper there had supplied a little raw meat, this had
not been discontinued. Both Mr. Maxwell and myself are
inclined to think that possibly, owing to the sudden increase in
the temperature, a small piece hidden by the bird may have
become putrid and, if afterwards swallowed, would go a long
way towards hastening its end.
A rough description of the bird may^ be summarized as
follows:--Total length about 6'5 inches; culmen ri ; wing 4-0 ;
tail 2'1 ; tarsus 0.95. Above pearl grey, slightly brownish on
crown, the upper tail coverts being blackish ; throat and upper
breast silvery white (becoming black during the breeding season)
breast downwards slaty grey verging into black on the abdomen
and under tail coverts. Lesser wing coverts white, tipped with
pale crimson ; the greater coverts pale crimson ; on the outer web
slate, black on the inner ; primary coverts and primaries exter-

Mr. Allen Silver,
nally crimson for the greater part on the outer webs and dark
slaty black on the inner ; most of the quills black, spotted with
two white bars except the first; on four of the secondary quills
not exposed to view golden brown markings are to be found.
The primaries and secondaries are tipped also with slaty white,
and the rectrices similarly marked, the outer ones far down the
web. Bill and tarsi black; iris very dark brown.
It may be of interest to state certain little peculiarities in
the behaviour of the bird viewed from a range of two feet. After
it had been out to a number of Shows, it would make itself quite
at home at such a short distance feeding fearlessly. A mealworm
was usually beaten on the floor of its cage up against the bark,
to which the bird might be clinging, before it was swallowed,
and small cockroaches were beaten and pinched, until their legs
came off, on the floor of the cage (much in the same manner as
a thrush would treat certain forms of live food) and afterwards
"bolted." Blue-bottle&amp;apos;flies and spiders were pinched between
its mandibles and then swallowed whole. After such operations
the bird usually wiped its long bill upon its perch. Instead of
climbing after the fashion of Creepers or Woodpeckers the bird
really scrambled and ran with lightning rapidity over or up the
bark in its cage not resting its body and tail close against this,
and would frequently expand and close its tail and wings when
so engaged. As before mentioned, many of its movements re-
minded one distinctly of Sittaccesia rather than Certhia familiaris
and like the former bird it perched freely,* sitting fairly upright.
When feeding, the Tree Creeper will hang in any convenient
position and collect food from its food vessel, or drop down
awkwardly on to the edge of it, but the Wall Creeper just hops
down on to its perch in quite a natural manner, and pecks out the
food in a different way. When moving over the cage bottom it
would stand fairly upright and run or scramble, sometimes
quickly and at others slowly, with the wings well tucked up, not
drooped as if to preserve its balance. Food was sometimes
carried up to the bark and pushed in a crevice and then eaten,
or left on the ledge and forgotten, and the bird would run
behind a piece of cork and peep out underneath in quite a
The tarsi are distinctly those of a Nuthatch as also are the toes and claws.

knowing way. I do not however remember hearing it utter a
single note of an\&amp;apos; kind, although its cry is said to resemble
that of Dendrocopus minor.
The Wall Creeper is the only representative of its genus,
which is placed in an intermediate position between Certhia and
Siita \ but resembles the latter in its slaty and dense plumage,
and soft tail not used in climbing, and also shares the character
of white markings on the tail feathers. Its bill however is not
powerful, hard, and sharp like that of many of the true Nut-
hatches, but favours the form peculiar to the Tree Creepers, not
however being anything like so sharp at the end or so curved,
but more round and much longer. I11 this country it seems quite
an accidental visitor, and as early as 1792 it was notified by
Robert Marsliam to Gilbert White. It was also recorded from
Eancashire by Mr. F. S. Mitchell in 1S72, and again by Mr.
Ruskin Butterfield, and for further additions I would refer the
reader to p. no, Vol. I. British Birds (Witherby &amp; Co.) This
birds' range extends from the mountainous regions of Southern
Europe into Central Asia, and as far east as China, it occurs
in most of the mountain ranges eastwards from the Caucasus,
and is also an inhabitant of Abyssinia* to the southward. Its
northward range in Europe (especially France and Germany) is
greater than usually recognized, and this apparently was notified
by Mr. Howard Saunders in the Bull. Brit. Orn. Club, I. p. xlix.
A German writer Dr. Brelim says :--" Riippell saw it 011 the Altai
and Abyssinian ranges. Jerdon tells us it is common on the
Himalayas and is also found in Cashmere and Afghanistan."
He also remarks that " This interesting bird is very commonly
met with upon the Alps, Pyrenees, Apennines, Balkan, Carpa-
thian and other mountains."
This bird is said to nest in the clefts of rocks ; in inacces-
sible situations occasionally, and Mr. Seebolim describes a nest
in his collection as being elaborately built; the chief materials
being moss and grasses, felted together with hair and wool and
feathers. It is said that the bird lays from three to five eggs
which are pure white, except for small black or deep reddish
brown dots, which in many specimens are scarcely visible. The
Its occurrence in Abyssinia is doubted. See Newton Die. Birds p. 986.

So many rare and curious birds have been described lately
in our Magazine that 1 almost hesitate to draw attention to the
little inmates of my aviaries. They are birds which may be
kept by anyone who cares for small foreigners, and who, like
myself, is restricted to keeping seed-eaters, and sorts which will
usually agree with others in a mixed aviary.
The Pileated Finches, which won the Society's medal in
1905, are still in faultless condition and splendid health, though
they must be getting old : the cock was bought in 1903, the hen
a little later in the same year.
They nest regularly every year, but curiously enough have
never yet reared a cock bird ! Last year two eggs were laid and
were hatched, but only a hen lived to grow up, and a beautiful
bird she was, but whether the nestling which died was a cock or
not I could not tell, it died before it was fledged.
The old birds spend their time--from May till November--
in a garden aviary, and build their very tiny fragile nest in a bush
in the open flight. Last year it was in a little yew bush, partly
protected by the wooden porch of the bird-house. They eat
insects, both mealworms and flies, etc., when nesting, also soft
food, but when indoors during the winter months they care for
nothing but seed.
A favourite nesting material is a rather superior kind of
rope, cut into short lengths and pulled to pieces. I find this is
in great favour with various other finches as well as our Pileated
friends, especially Masked Finches and Biclienos.
My Ouail Finches are somewhat puzzling. The cock is
very handsome, and was fully adult when he came, and the hen
was, I supposed, an ordinary adult hen, just a little brown bird
sufficiently shaded to mark her as a Quail Finch. Unfortunately
she disappeared from the garden aviary after a few weeks, and

her poor mate who was, and is, crippled in one wing, lived a
solitary life in the midst of a crowd, till last summer I got him
another hen. She was just like the original one at first, but
latterly she has changed so much that I begin to wonder whether
"she" is really a hen after all.
These birds must surely take a long time to mature, for
this one had been with me for many months before any change
was noticed. Now she has developed the white ring round the
eye and the white patch under the bill, which I had believed
characteristic only of the male, and her markings are now very
much more distinct than at first, though still not as dark and
clear as the mate's. I have seen a good many of these birds at
Shows, but never one as handsome as my old cock, and I con-
clude that they must either be immature birds or hens. I wish
someone would enlighten me. I may add that my two are quite
indifferent to each other, partly perhaps because the cock cannot
fly properly and keeps to the floor of the aviary, while the hen is
active and flies quite well. They spend the summer out of doors
and love to run about in the grass almost like tiny Quails.
I have a charming pair of Dufresne's Waxbills which have
been with me for just two years. They are most lovely little
birds, always happy and well, active in their habits and most
amiable, but they utterly refuse to nest either indoors or out. I
kept them in during the first part of the summer of 1906, hoping
that an aviary entirely to themselves might be an inducement,
but they looked quite lost in it, and as nearly depressed as it is
possible for a Dufresne to be, so I turned them out with the
others into the garden aviary, where they spent a blissful summer
flitting from branch to branch, and basking in the sunshine,
never far apart, for they are a devoted couple. I still hope that
they may win a medal, for several pairs of my birds have been
with me a very longtime before attempting to nest, notably some
Masked Grassfinches, which reared two young ones last year, and
the Pileated Finches before mentioned.
Virginian Nightingales are very showy and hardy pets,
and mine have been out all this winter, and the worse the day
the more persistently do they remain in the open flight which is
really a wired-in flower border. This is not the case with the

Diamond Sparrow or the Yellow-rumped Finches, which are
\0x25A0quite aware of the comfort of their wooden house on cold or
stormy days. The Harlequin Quails too spend a good deal of
time there.
The most charming of my Quails, the tiny Chinese Painted
variety, refused to take refuge inside and looked so miserable
that they were caught up, and have spent the winter with the
Waxbills in the conservatory, perfectly tame and confiding and
seemingly quite happy. The little hen has already laid forty
eggs this spring, but does not attempt to sit on them. We hope
that when she goes into the garden again she may find a nesting
site to her liking and manage to bring off a brood.

Since I last wrote in the March Magazine I have had a
letter from the gentleman in Jamaica who sent me my Black-
bearded Doves. It seems I made a mistake about their habitat,
which I hasten to correct. Though they were sent to me from
Jamaica they are really natives of Cuba. Quoting from their
former owner's letter he says:--" The Black-bearded Doves came
to me from Cuba, hence they are hardly common in Jamaica.
In Cuba they are styled ' Spanish Partridge.' They laid with me
on the bottom of a box hung about four feet from the ground,
and employed no nesting material. More than one egg was
'toe-bored,' and the one young bird I had died quite early,
it appeared to need its parents some time after it was fully
feathered."
This is just what my own birds seem to be doing. They
had never nested with me before, but to-day, May 13th, the hen
laid an egg in a Parrot's nesting box some four feet from the
ground. These boxes were made for me by a joiner specially
for the Parrots. The bottom of the box is hollowed out saucer-
shape and one side of the box hinges downwards like a door.
This I have fastened firmly half-way down so that it now acts

as a broad ledge outside the nest. I put dry heather in the
bottom, but the Doves turned it out. The egg was laid a few
inches away on the hard wood, and of course was broken. I
have tried to make the nest box a safer nesting place since, and
hope some day I shall be able to tell you of the rearing of a young
Black-bearded Dove.
And now I must take you to my last built aviary. This
house is a long way my favourite, and though it has faults, which
I should correct if I had it to build over again, still in many ways it
is very convenient. This aviary is divided into five divisions, each
composed of flight and shelter, which two parts can be shut off
from each other. Part of the roof over the flights is glass, part
wire netting. The roof over the shelter is of corrugated iron
lined with wood. The floor (except under the open part of the
flight) is cemented, and an earthenware shallow tank is fixed
into each house as a bath, fitted with a plug and waste pipe.
These baths all drain into a dumb well, and never get choked or
give any trouble.
At the back of the aviary is a wide passage the whole
length, one end portion however being partitioned off as a small
aviary, the other as a porch and seed-room. I find this passage
and seed-room most useful for storing food, and everything else
of the many articles wanted in an aviary. In the passage are
two large cages let out in the wall. They reach from floor to
ceiling and ai e so arranged that they can be divided into either
two or four cages as may be required. One is at present
tenanted by four sweet little American flying squirrels, but these
are not subjects for a bird magazine,so I must leave them alone.
I find these cages very handy for birds that will not stand roost-
ing out at night in winter, or for sick birds. The cages, as I said r
reach to the floor, but, as it would hardly do to keep birds so low
down as this, I have made the bottom part in one place into a
cupboard for storing sand (of which we use a good deal) and the
other for keeping the coke for the fire in. These most necessary
articles are thus kept neatly out of the way, and having a good
supply on the spot saves many a journey, for the aviary is a long
way down the garden, and the coke and sand have to be carried
a considerable distance.

<bodyText confidence="0.999767052631579" page_id="32669196"  page_num="Page 232" year="" vol="">
The heating is done by a coke stove, the coke used is
*small, about the size of walnuts. I get it through the blacksmith,
it being the same kind as he uses for his forge. It is rather an
expensive quality of coke, but I prefer to use it as it is practically
smokeless, and thus not a nuisance to our neighbours. The fire
is kept going night and day in winter, and, besides keeping the
birds warm, prevents the food stores from spoiling with damp.
A long strip of canvas stretches across the flat wire roof of the
flight, and helps to keep out the snow and cold. Later in the
year the canvas is just moved higher up on the glass roofed
part, where it acts as a shade, for the nests are often built very
high up, and the glass gets burning hot in summer.
Inside the aviary is whitewashed and painted pale green
and cream colour--which shows up the plumage of the birds very
well. Outside is painted dark and light green, and roses and ivy
trained up the walls. Every year large boughs of Scotch fir (the
only fir that I find will retain its needles) are fixed to the walls
of the shelters and glass covered part of the flight. No branches
are put really in the open, so no nests are ever built there, as
I do not like the idea of sitting birds or young ones being
exposed to wet weather.
Doves make such poor nests that I fasten up zinc nest
pans in the boughs--and put inside each nest some dried heather
--with plenty more material scattered on the floor, and this is
*constantly supplied to the birds all through the summer. The
heather, which is of a special kind, I procure yearly from F.
Hiscock, Ashley, Ringwood, Hants, who sells it at a reasonable
price. Of course there is always a good supply of ground egg
shell as grit in the aviaries--especially in the nesting season. If
I see any bird likely to nest I just scatter some grit on the floor,
besides what is always in the pan for the purpose. For often a
bird will pick up what is just in front of it, when it will not
trouble to go any distance to procure it. Years ago I bought an
" Enterprise" grinder from Messrs. Spratts and have found it
invaluable for grinding shell and biscuit. The size ground can
always be regulated, but with the biscuit I always sift it after-
wards (in a wooden box with a perforated zinc bottom) and the
small crumbs and powder come in very useful for mixing with

the soft food. I much prefer it for this purpose to grated carrot.
In addition to their seed diet of wheat, hemp, dari, white millet,
and a little rice--the Doves are very fond of shelled and cut up
monkey nuts (which I get from Messrs. Armitage, seed
merchants, Nottingham) and ground biscuit. I use a kind of
biscuit called " President," and the price per # cwt. is about 16/-. I
think these two kinds of food are very good for the Doves,
besides seed--for they always seem to keep well and in good
plumage--and some specimens I have had for many years now.
Every night a canvas curtain drawn on a wire with rings
is drawn across the open front of the aviary. It keeps the birds
quiet at night, and also keeps out the cold. I cannot keep more
than three pairs of nesting doves in each division of the aviary:
to try and keep more would only mean that if any young ones
were reared the space would be far too overcrowded, and the later
nests would come to nothing. As it is I have to take the young
ones away when they are getting a good size and place them in
another part.
In No. i division live a pair of the Bleeding Hearts, a pair
of Brush Bronze-wings and a pair of Rufous Pigeons. These
latter are very rare and the original pair was sent to me from
Jamaica ; their name was unknown and they had in the first
place come from Barranquilla in South America. Later Mr.
Newman, who is most kind in identifying any rare birds for me,
identified them as the Rufous Pigeon (Columba rtifi.no) from the
skin of the old cock, which I was so unfortunate as to lose. Before
this bird died the pair reared one fine young one--a cock ; then
they nested again, and when the second young one was only a few
days old the original cock died. Just afterwards the second young
one fell out of the nest and was picked up cold and almost dead.
To my surprise, after a time the warmth of my hand revived it,
and finally, under the care of some Barbary Doves, it grew into a
fine bird. When nearly full grown, however, it died, I don't
know from what cause.
This left me with only the old lieu and the young cock.
They nested and have had several fertile eggs--always one egg
only being laid at a sitting--but some months ago the cock began
to suffer from lumps or tumours coming in his face. Up to then

lie had been particularly strong and in fine plumage. I expect
the mischief started in the first place from the bird bruising itself
some time against the wire-netting, for these Rufous Pigeons are
very nervous birds. It was partly fright at being caught to be
doctored that killed the old cock bird, and the young one has
once or twice had a fit after being handled. Seeing the bird was
only getting worse I at last caught it and sent it away to be
operated upon. The operation was most skilfully done, and the
bird came back to me showing no scars and with its head a
proper shape again. I believe several tumours were removed,
one being so close to the eye as almost to press on the eyeball.
The eyes of course were left a little weak, and possibly it may
have been the cold winds we have had this spring, but the bird's
sight a few weeks ago began to be affected and both eyes very
swollen and inflamed. Little by little his sight went, till at last
he was so blind with both eyes as not to be able to see to rise
from the ground. The&amp;apos;dove's strength began to fail, and that
sign of weakness in a bird, a contraction of the toes, as if the
circulation was failing, began to show. I put down a bed of ha} 7 &amp;apos;
and some food and water near and thought I had better leave the
dove to die. I dreaded catching him, and it only seemed like
torture to try any remedy, but he looked so piteous--listening on
all sides and turning his sightless eyes to try and locate the
sound--that I determined to do what I could, though I had little
hope. On the aviary medicine shelf in the porch I keep a bottle
of boracic lotion, the formula of an oculist, and with this lotion in
a little warm water I bathed the Rufous Pigeon's eyes ; at first
three times a day, now, after some weeks treatment only once.
I am thankful to say the bird has well recovered its sight with
one eye, but the other eye I am doubtful of, though it is very
much better. There is a small ulcer on the eyeball and it remains
to be seen if the sight comes back. It is strange how the colour
of the eye went and has now returned. One of the prettiest
points about the Rufous Pigeon is its very bright ruby eyes.
In the eye that has recovered, the colour is almost perfect again,
but in the other it is at present faded and pale, though improving.
When first I began the bathing both eyes were closed and so
terribly swollen that the shape of the head was quite distorted,

tlie eyelids standing out as if peas had been forced under the lids ;
by now the swelling is quite gone on one side and nearly on the
other. Most fortunately the bird could always eat, though how
it found its food I don't know. It is a good plan when you put a
blind bird in a cage to place the seed in a shallow dripping tin (a
fair size) and stand the patient in it. It will feel the food then,
and if it has any intelligence will learn to pick it up.
Now in doctoring birds a little thought is needed, both to
save yourself trouble and the patient pain, and as knowledge
only comes from experience, and these notes are only intended
for beginners in aviculture, it will perhaps not be quite wasted
space to tell you how to nurse a case of this kind. First, before
you catch the bird, get all your things ready on a table. I have
a broad table shelf under the window in the little seed room, and
on this shelf I arrange my things. You need a small clean pot
partly filled with lukewarm water--cold water would chill the
eye too much--and to this add about a third more of boracic
lotion. To bathe the eye use a small piece of medicated cotton
wool, and when bathing do not touch the eye which will be very
tender, just squeeze the lotion over it. When the bathing is
done press the wool dry and with it just mop up any drops that
may have fallen on the feathers. Be sure, and this is important,
to use fresh lotion and water and fresh cotton wool every time
you bathe the eye, don't make an old lot do twice.
This particular Rufous Dove is very difficult to hold and
he gets worse to manage as he gets better ; he is a big strong
bird and very nervous. It is impossible to have a bird loose in
an aviary that you want to catch three times a day, and an
ordinary cage is awkward, as one cannot get both hands inside
the door, and I cannot catch so large a bird with one hand. The
best plan is to have an invalid box. This you can easily make
yourself out of any old wooden box about 20 inches by 14 inches
and 12 inches high. Take off the lid and all round the inside of
the box tack strong paper to prevent the bird cutting its wings
against a stray splinter or the roughness of the wood. Fix a
perch, nearly touching the bottom across the width of the box;
broom handles, unpainted, and costing twopence each, make
excellent perches when cut up, being just the right width for

doves. A piece of cage fronting of wire, rather larger than the top
of the box forms the lid. It should be laid loosely, not fastened
on. What would be better still would be a wooden frame covered
tightly with strong string netting, as there would then be no fear
of the bird knocking its head if it jumped upwards. I think it is
better not to put sand on the cage floor, it might get into the
bird's eyes if it fluttered, but have some pieces of newspaper
folded rather smaller than the bottom of the box, and slip a piece
under the perch (which being low helps to keep it down) every
morning. This should be done and fresh seed and water put
in before the bird is returned to the box after its eyes have
been bathed.
The lid of the box must be loose, not in any way fastened
down, as you want to get your arms under it when catching the
bird. In catching use both hands, and get the thumbs well over
the back keeping the wings down. You can manage to get the
bird out of the box quite well by raising the lid with your arms
when you have once caught the bird. It only needs a little
practice and I do it all myself every morning, fresh food, paper
and water, besides the actual work of bathing the eyes.
When you have caught the Dove hold it in your left hand
against your side, the thumb still over the shoulder, the first
finger across the breast, whilst the second finger acts as a perch
for the feet. The bird held in this way is quite comfortable, but
a safe prisoner and cannot get away. In bathing the eyes don't
hurry--if the bird begins to jerk after a bit let it have a few
seconds' rest to quiet down. When you have finished with your
free hand put in the food and fresh paper (of course removing
the old) and put back the lid on the top before you replace the
bird. You can now raise the lid with one finger and with both
hands carefully put the bird, its back towards you, on the perch,
when it will probably be quite quiet. You may think all these
little details unnecessary, but if you try to replace the patient
with one hand it will most likely struggle, and if you try to put
the bird in first and the box lid on afterwards the bird will pro-
bably get away whilst you are doing it.
Sometimes, in spite of all your care, the Dove will rub a
shoulder raw if it tries to jerk about every time you catch it.

Notes on my Birds. 237
Either vaseline or "New Skin" on the wound is an excellent
remedy. The latter is a liquid antiseptic court plaister, which
you just paint on with a brush. It is most useful for cuts in
humans as well as in birds, and so easy to apply r , but must be
allowed to dry on the wounds, which it does in a few minutes.
Of course any dirt should be well washed out first before the
" New Skin " is put on.
After a little practice you will soon find you can cut over-
grown beaks and claws and dress wounds, holding the birds as
well as operating yourself. I much prefer having no one to help
me, but in the case of setting a broken leg one is obliged to have
assistance.
I have been keeping the Rufous Pigeon in the passage
where there is no strong light to try&amp;apos;- the eye too much. He will
soon be turned into an aviary but not be allowed to be with the
hen for sometime till he is a stronger. At the time I had to catch
him up the birds were nesting. The hen bravely continued to
sit herself for a few days, but finally deserted the egg, which
turned ont to be clear. The Rufous Pigeon is a very handsome
bird, reddish purple in colour, with a grey head and most lovely
metallic green 011 the top of the head and neck ; the eyes are
very bright ruby red.
I have just lost alien Bleeding Heart Dove in this No. 1
division. She was a nice bird, but very nervous and I believe
died partly through fright of the cock. Bleeding Heart cocks
get very vicious sometimes at the beginning of the nesting
season, and harass each and every unlucky bird who crosses
their path. Doves do not often kill each other like parrots,
but they are very quarrelsome. Sometimes I have seen a dove
pecked and plucked by;- other doves till its life was not worth
living, but when the tormented one was removed in pity to
another house it has at once turned on its new companions and
itself acted the part of a bully.
Some birds are naturally aggressive. I remember an
ancient Parson Finch we had, too old to fly from the ground,
who made a point, old as he was, of always jostling any new
comer into the aviary who settled on the floor. He did not
really hurt them, but tried to push them about in a most impolite

fashion. I11 No. 2 division of the aviary there live three very
well-behaved pairs of doves. Bronze-wings, Rufous Doves and
Solitary Ground Doves. I have had all these six birds for years,
and for long they have lived happily together, and every year they
nest and bring up young ones. So far I have only one young
one in this house this year, a little Rufous Dove, but I fancy the
Bronze-wings have hatched, as I saw an eggshell on the floor a
day or two ago. I11 a few days I shall put a good bed of hay
under the nest to save the young ones hurting themselves on the
hard floor when first they come out of the nest, further when
they are once out the hay makes a cosy place for them to sit in.
Dryness and warmth are very important for young birds, and it
takes so little to chill them.
In No. 3 division are an odd Bronze-wing and a pair each
of Bleeding Hearts and Madagascar Turtles, the latter very hand-
some birds in colouring rather like the Barranquilla. The Bleed-
ing Hearts have made a huge nest of dried heather, but so far no
eggs are laid, though I now and then see one of the birds on the
nest.
Into this division I had moved my Bronze-necked Doves,
but the little cock turned so bad tempered in his excitement
over nesting that I was obliged to take him and his mate away.
I one day saw him plucking and beating one of the Bleeding
Hearts, though it was much larger than he was, until the poor
thing was so bewildered it did not know how to protect itself.
Usually I find that the smaller doves are very bad tempered.
One little Picni cock I had was a terror, and thought nothing of
attacking a dove three or four times his size. It is always as well
when turning a fresh bird into an aviary or making any re-
arrangement in the birds to keep a strict look out for a day or so.
Usually if any fighting is going to take place it will begin within
a few minutes, but if the birds are quiet together for several days
they will usually remain so all along and give no trouble.

The May number of British Birds brings to a conclusion
the first volume of this admirable periodical, and we congratulate
the Editors upon the many highly scientific facts brought before
the public in its pages.
The present number contains a valuable article by Mr.
P. H. Bahr on the development of a young Cuckoo, illustrated by
numerous photographs of the bird taken at various ages. Messrs.
C. J. and H. G. Alexander publish the result of their observations
during the past three years on the Song-periods of British Birds.
Mr. W. P. Pycraft discusses the bearing on the simple nest of the
Ringed Plover 011 the evolution of Birds' nests in general ; his
interesting article being illustrated by photographs of five types
of the nest of that bird. The part concludes with a number of
Notes, a review of God man's " Monograph of the Petrels" and a
letter respecting a wounded Peregrine fed by its mate.
A. G. B.
Our member, the Rev. W. J. Constable, has sent us the
Report of the Uppingham School Natural History Society, the
Ornithological Section of which occupies the best part of nine
pages, a nearly identical space being devoted to Entomology
(or more strictly speaking to Lepidoptera, no other Orders being
dealt with).
There are observations upon seventy-five species of birds,
some of which are interesting if authentic ; for instance, a
Wren's nest is described with seven young and one egg--a not
unusual occurrence in the case of our Blue-Tit (which has un-
doubtedly often been mistaken for a Wren) but personally we
never yet found a Wren's nest with more than six eggs : it would
be interesting to note whether the nest was in a hole; both this
and another nest with eight eggs were seen in Stoke Wood. The
full complement of eggs in Tits' nests is not infrequently eight,
and sometimes the whole are reared.
The generic names should have been printed with capital
initial letters and in the Lepidoptera they should have been given
in full (the specific name of the Meadow Brown is usually spelt
janeira not jtinira).

Correspondence.
There is not the least doubt that the principals of our
schools throughout the British Islands are doing excellent work
in training their pupils in Natural Science, and they deserve every
encouragement. Fifty years ago education was either classical,
with a view to the three professions of divinty, law, and medicine ;
or was wholly commercial ; now, happily, all is changed for the
better, and a youth can study Natural History without being
regarded by every passer by as a harmless lunatic.

THE USE OF GENTLES AS A FOOD FOR BIRDS.
Sir, --Can any of my fellow members tell me wliat has been their
experience in regard to the use of " gentles," by which we mean the larvae
of the Blow-fly ? I particular!}&amp;apos; wish to know whether any objection has
been found to the use of the gentle--either alive, after they have been well
scoured, or after they have been scalded--in bringing up young cage or
aviary birds, or as a substitute for the useful, but rather expensive meal-
worm as part of the diet of adult soft-billed birds. I have known them
used with satisfactory results when scalded, by keepers, for young pheasants
at the coops; but my own experience of the gentle in the cage or aviary is
very limited. I believe Mr. Seth-Smith used gentles alive, but well scoured,
in rearing the Ouaiis, Tinamous and Hemipodes with which he has been
so successful. But if a substitute for the mealworm, as attractive, but
less stimulating and heating, it would be a great help to some of us when
we are trying to rear young of the insect-eating birds. I11 the case of
some, for instance, Rock-Thrushes, I have found that the parents, though
quite ready to visit the pan of ants' eggs, yolk of egg, etc., for their own
purpose, are unwilling to take anything but live food up to the nest.

Sir, --A Pied Blackbird with rather an unusual history has lately
come into my possession. It was found frozen in a field at Wickham, late
last November, by a man who picked it up for dead. .Seeing it was an
uncommon bird he thought he would have it stuffed, and put it in his
pocket to take it to our Bromley naturalist for that purpose.
When he reached his destination and took the bird out of his pocket
it was seen to move, so Mr. Dell, thinking he might be able to restore it,
paid the man for it and kept the bird. It recovered, but its feet were

useless, and at the end of six weeks it could only walk upon its stumps;
the toes being rolled up into a ball. Mr. Dell then cut it out some card-
board shoes, properly shaped, and bound the toes to the cardboard with
cotton wool, which was kept in place by Seccotine. After the Blackbird
had walked about on these improvised snow shoes for some weeks the feet
were unbound, and the bird immediately hopped up to a perch. Now it
can get about very well from perch to perch, and down to the bottom of the
cage and up again, and it roosts like any other bird. Of course the feet are
somewhat deformed but quite useful, and the patient seems to be in perfect
health. The plumage is a good deal knocked about owing to the unusual
life it has had to lead, but it is a pretty bird and, if it continues to do well,
will no doubt improve in feather very soon. This " Blackbird" has a grey
head, white round the beak, a white breast mottled with very dark brown,
the wings appear to have alternate feathers of black and white, the tail lias-
a white centre with outer edges black, but as several feathers are missing
from this appendage I cannot describe it accurately. The eyes are dark and
very handsome. The beak now partly black and partly yellow. Sex un-
known at present. It was supposed to be a cock, but a scientific friend of
mine inclines to the belief that it is a hen. I suppose from Dr. Butler's
remarks in our March number pied hens are more rare than cocks. My
bird at present only makes the shrill call, answering I suppose a cock
Blackbird which lives in the room close to it, and which is an accomplished
singer. E. E. WEST.

Sir, --I should be much obliged if anyone would tell me the reason
of my cock Bullfinch having lost every one of his wing feathers in a night.
The bird is one year old and in perfect health otherwise. A hen bullfinch
of the same age has been fed exactly in the same way, and this has not
happened to her. Perhaps I had better mention that they never have more
than two hemp seeds a day. F. Harewood.

Sir, --We are told that "seeing is believing" and although a little
corpse, I send you one of the Chaffinch-Canary which died this afternoon
(the other one is still alive and a fine bird). The beak and the dark line
down the back of the wings I think are odd.
The live bird is larger, and has a pale beak, but its skin is a darker
colour ; the head and wings are yellow. I hope it will live. I have had
several people in, during the pairing and incubation, who can give evidence,
if I can rear the bird which is left, and I have taken every care that no other
male bird was near the hen which laid the eggs. Ar.YS Gortkr.
The dead bird was only just commencing to produce its quill feathers.

most of its body being bare or nearly so; but bad it lived I imagine that,
with the exception of its beak which was larger and heavier than one sees
in pure-bred Canaries, its colouring would not have been strikingly different
from many ticked or pied Canaries; the dark-skinned bird, if it should be
reared, would I think show the Chaffinch characteristics more distinctly.

Sir,--M y Bar-sliouldered Doves (Geopetia hnmeralis) laid some time
ago with no result: now they have laid again and hatched out. I do not
know if there are two, or only one, as I find it is a bad plan to disturb birds
nesting, though some people think otherwise.
I see Mr. Newman mentious in his article on the Madagascar Turtle-
dove that he failed to notice the 'greenish' tinge in the young birds. I
noticed this in my young birds, two of which are now flying in the avairy.
The Choughs have laid again and one appears to be sitting, with what
result I am anxiously waiting for. C. CasteE-Seoane.

The accompanying photo of my male Saras Crane may be
of interest to some of your readers. Sarus Cranes do not appear
to be commonly kept--perhaps on the ground that they are large
birds and require a good deal of room. A rood of land is not
too much for a pair, if it can be given, as they delight to take
long runs with wings outspread. They also spend a good deal
of time hunting for worms, insects, etc., and, if given a lot of
loose turf sods spread out and cut small, will constantly be pull-
ing them about whilst searching underneath.
I feed my bird three times a day on mixed corn (one fourth
part split maize) the rest wheat, husk-rice, dari, &amp;c. This seems
to answer well. In very cold weather I give a little raw meat.
A mouse or small sparrow is not despised.
The Sarus Crane is a bird of temper, and my bird speedily
tried to kill a pair of Demoiselle Cranes which I put into his run.
He, however, lives peaceably with various pheasants, not taking
the slightest notice of them unless they get in his way at feeding
time. They soon learn discretion.
The breeding of Sarus Cranes in England seems to be a
delight reserved for future generations, as Mr. Astley has nothing
to record and the Duchess of Bedford only mentions one bird as
being hatched at Woburn Park. However the old birds are
most stately and graceful in form and of a lovely gray colour.
I11 India the Sarus is generally seen on the plains wander-
ing about cultivated fields near some "jheel," and stands the hot
weather without migrating. These birds can, however, also

endure severe cold and will stand an English winter without
any protection, or shelter.
They usually have only one young one, and there is a
popular superstition in India that they mate only once in their
lives and pine if the pair bird is killed or dies. On this ground
they are held more or less sacred and not usually shot. The
young are caught and tamed.
The Sams is not so noisy as its relative the Australian, or
the Common European Crane.
To give an idea of size, I may mention that the cross wire

THE BRITISH RAILS.
By Percy W. Fakmborough, F.Z.S.
My friend Dr. B-utler has been good enough to honour me
with a request for an article this mouth, and in deference to his
wish I offer these remarks on the two species of British Rails that
most people are more familiar with than the other kinds, but
which, still for all that, they do not often take the trouble to
keep in captivity.
During the past three years, through the kindness of a
friend who is possessed of a small well-sheltered pond--a house
agent would describe it as an "extensive lake"--in a secluded
estate some few miles from a railway line, I have been able to study
many of the different shore or wading birds, as well as many
ethers which do not, strictly speaking, come within this category.
Although during the past ten or twelve years I have taken up
mammalian pets more than others I have not entirely neglected
my feathered friends, and any creature that can reasonably be
called " uncommon " has always possessed a greater interest than
those others which are usually kept in captivity.
The Corn Crake (Land Rail) and the Water Rail are both
common birds in this country, and yet very few people seem to
see either, and still fewer ever take sufficient interest in them to
keep one or the other in confinement. The first, if not often
seen, is frequently heard, for its call of " crek-cre-ek-k " is one

of the most familiar sounds during the spring in the fields, and
the principal difficulty one labours under is that of locating the
bird ; first of all it sounds as though the call was only six or
eight yards away, in a moment or two it sounds as if it were
made at a distance of a hundred or more yards away ; at one
time it seems as though the bird were on the right, next it sounds
as if it had suddenly got to the left of the listener, so that it is
not by any means an easy bird to get a glimpse of. The call of
the Corn Crake has a somewhat different sound when the bird is
kept in an aviary, and is more like the "quacking" of a young
duck than the sound which is heard in the open fields.
The Corn Crake or Land Rail ( Crex crex ), or Quaker Hen
as it is sometimes called, is the commonest of the four species
that have undoubted British rank, the others being the Spotted
Crake ( Porzana porzana), the Tittle Crake ( Zapornica parva ) and
Baillon's Crake ( Porzana intermedia?), all these three are uncom-
mon, the last two extremely so. The Corn Crake is widely
-distributed from May until the end of September throughout
Great Britain, and may be found in almost any meadow which is
left for hay. I have written "found" but it would be better to
say " heard," for it is by no means an easy bird to find even when
heard, especially if the lien has begun to lay. I have kept close
observation in a hay field day after day without finding where
the birds were, (I had been asked not to walk over the growing
crop), for of all the sly skulking birds the Rails are the cleverest,
tliey seem to be able to sneak through the growing hay&amp;apos;&amp;apos; without
appearing to disturb a stem ; and then it was a farm hand who
found the nest and hen during the mowing. The field was one
of the first to be mown and the young when found with the hen
*could not have been hatched very long ; five were caught, the
rest with the hen escaping. The colour of the down of these
little mites was bluish- or ashy-black, not, as I had read and ex-
pected, quite black. It was some few hours before I could get
-down to the farm and they were pretty hungry when I arrived;
but in spite of all my endeavours they refused to take the ants'
*eggs and egg yolk I prepared and, as it was dark, 110 live insects
could be got. At four the next morning when I looked at the
open box in which they had been put with some hay, three were

Mr. P. W. Fakmborough,
dead and, although the remaining two had a few insects almost
directly, they had gone before breakfast was over. Of course
it was the delay which took place before it was possible for me to
get down to where they were and feed them, as well as having to
wait until morning before insects could be procured that caused
the death of these mites ; thus ended the first experiment.
A few days later, after I had left, I received a letter which
said: "Another nest of young Crakes found yesterday; don't
worry! Joe* is feeding them up with that 'stuff' you left
and says they are taking it well." This was good news for
three reasons: first that another nest had been found, secondly
that there was someone there who could look after them, and
thirdly that they were feeding, as it so happened that I could
not leave owing to an official engagement that prevented me
going down into the country, so that I felt quite relieved
to think that possibly things would continue to go until I could
get to the farm and see what was happening. It was nearly a
week before I went--two letters having arrived in the meantime
to say all was well--and then when I arrived Joe met me at the
station with "Well, Maister P&amp;apos;armborough, I'se done th' trick
for ye and gotten them on foine ! you'll be main pleased when
you sees 'em, I'll lay." And so I was for he had got four perky
young Crakes about three weeks or so old, as tame and cheeky
as could be with him, but a bit nervous of me when I tried to
feed them or, to be more correct, put the food in the Tate's sugar
box for them, as they were picking for themselves.
After a few days I had them transferred to an aviary I had
had constructed by the kindness of my friend the owner, by the
lake, so as to have a part of the water enclosed. It was a very
cheaply erected structure, of tarred posts and wire netting;
advantage was taken of two trees which stood six yards apart,
not quite ten yards from the water's edge, to make them one end
of the aviary, the other end being five yards in the water, which
was rather shallow just at this spot. The chief item of expense
was the wire netting, which took more than I had at first judged ;
but as my friend told me to order what was wanted and said he'd
pay for it, it practically cost me nothing.

After being turned in a few days they became quite wild
again, as is the case with many birds when turned into a large en-
closure. They however ate all the food that was put in for them,
and although smaller than the Water Rails which were also in
the aviary, would not let the latter feed from the dish at the same
time but drove them away every time they approached the food
vessel. Both kinds of Rails fed on the same food, which, was
rather a messy looking mixture of bread and milk (the bread
being wetted only just enough to crumble up niceljq), ants' eggs,
mealworms, a little raw meat and a couple of raw eggs broken
over all and mixed tip. There were plenty of slugs, snails, and
worms to be found in the enclosure and these no doubt eked out
the food supply.
I was not down at the farm in the September of that year,
but word was sent to me that the Rand Rails were extremely
restless and that one had severely battered itself against the net-
work ; in the following month I saw the birds and two were
extremely wild and evidently suffering from a bad attack of
migratory fever; the other two fairly quiet. The restless ones
were damaging themselves considerably about the head and
shoulders and so I thought it better to let them go whilst they
could still fly properly, so I caught them and released them out-
side the aviary. They flew away strongly and I trust were
strong enough to reach Africa safely. The other two passed
through the winter safely and commenced their characteristic
call in March.
One thing that struck me was the habit of bathing in the
shallow water at the edge of the lake, a matter which seemed to
give them great pleasure judging from the whole-hearted manner
with which they performed the operation. There were some very
small fishes in the lake and it was most amusing to watch the
Crakes run along the edge of the water chasing the "tiddlers,"
usually unsuccessfully, but occasionally their exertions were
rewarded by the capture of one of the " laggards."

Mr. P. F. M. Galloway,
THE WEATHER AND OUR SUMMER BIRDS. #
By P. F. M. Galloway.
It is interesting to note the habits of our wild birds and
the effect the weather has upon them.
As our last real spring and summer weather took place
in 1906, it allows 11s a fair time of unsettled bad weather to
note its ill effect on birds of the insectivorous species
especially.
During the spring and summer of last year (which never
arrived) our summer migrants had a bad nesting season. They
arrived here well to their time and we had a fortnight of brilliant
warm weather at Easter, which was, as we all know, earlier last
year than this, and that warm settled weather came with the
wind in the N.E. from the very quarter that is bringing Arctic
weather now. After that fortnight, with the exception of an
hour or two of sunshine and this at long intervals, we had
nothing but overcast, cool, windy, and rainy weather until the
grass was cut, somewhere about the end of June or early July,
farmers then had about a fortnight of fine warm weather in
which to make their hay, and those that did not make it then
must have made manure of it, for we had dull gloomy damp
weather from that time right on to the end of the first week of
September, when the harvest had begun, the remainder of that
month being fine and practically speaking the best month of
the year ; after the harvest the same dull weather prevailed and
there was hardly a day passed in which it was not blowing roughly,
cloudy and rainy. The strawberries ripened last year it is true,
but they were ripe one side and covered with mildew the other.
The effect the weather of last year had upon our summer
migrants was this : --The continuance of cold and absence of
sunshine prevented the old birds from rearing all their young,
for they could scarcely find sufficient live insect food to keep
themselves upon, to say nothing of rearing a brood of young.
I found several nests of Tree Pipits, Willow Wrens and even
Tree Creepers, all the young dead in their nests, and I have no
doubt there were many more that I did not find in the same
Written in April, 1908, at Reading&amp;apos;.

state. On examining the birds I found the young were in very
poor condition from want of food and had died from star-
vation.
A few of the nests contained young of about four or five
days old, but most of those found dead were young just showing
their feather, this is easily accounted for. While the nestlings
were very small, they did not require such a large quantity of
food, but as they struggled on to the stage of feathering, the
demand for food was greater and as this could not be found in-
sufficient quantity the young had to go under.
I also picked up several adult birds, Lesser Whitethroats,.
and Willow Wrens, which I had no difficulty in catching, as they
were in a weak state, and on examination found them in a
very poor and ill-nourished condition.
Young Wrynecks in two instances I found drowned in the
holes of trees where they had been hatched, these being well-
feathered. So much for 1907.
In January, February and March, 1908, we had the same
dull dreary weather with a few days on which the sun shone, and
when it has shone, the air has generally been cold and clear
on those days.
I looked about at the end of March in vain for the Wheat-
ear, which I have found on several occasions by the 2Stli of
February ; we reached April, but the old-fashioned true April
shower was missing, the April shower formerly consisted of a
heavy shower, with sometimes a clap of thunder and the next
minute the sun was shining bright and warm, the trees sparkling
with drops of water on leaves and twigs, with probably a rainbow
in the sky, now it was replaced by a sopping wet day, and the
sun if it did condescend to shine, had little warmth.
On the 3rd of April I heard in this district of Reading,
Berks, the first Chiff-Chaff, a fortnight late in its arrival. On
the 6th I heard and saw three Blackcap Warblers, this species
being a week earlier than usual. On the 10th I went to a certain
place where I have never failed to hear and see the Nightingale for
the past 15 years, but up to the time of writing this article I have
not heard or seen it, although I was informed by a farm labourer
that he heard one 011 the 21st iust. On the 10th I heard a few

Mr. P. F. M. Galloway,
Wrynecks, the 21st the Cuckoo was heard, and yesterday the 24th
I saw one Tree Pipit, which sat within six feet of me and looked
as though another twelve hours would end the poor bird's
existence. On the 23rd, during the blizzard, I saw two Swallows,
these could scarcely fly and were only able with difficulty to clear
a low hedge; so starved and numbed with cold were they that it
is impossible for them to have lived through the night.
This season a very few migrants have arrived, but one
thing is certain, that few if any of the smaller migrants that have
arrived can be alive now. The Wryneck, whose food consists
solely of small insects, principally ants and their eggs, cannot
possibly have lived until to-day. The Swallow, which feeds en-
tirely upon winged insects, must share the same fate. Even the
strong Green Woodpecker can with difficulty live through heavy
snow and frost, as its food supply, being ants, is entirely out of
its reach, and those birds of this species that do struggle
through severe weather are just those that are hatched and reared
in woods containing the large nests of the wood ant. These
nests are composed of nothing but small sticks and the needles
of fir trees, and into these nests the bird probes in winter until it
reaches the ants, which are often over two feet down from the
surface of the earth, and there in the winter may be seen holes
large enough for a rabbit to enter, where the Green Woodpecker
has reached the insects, which are to all intents and purposes
hibernating below the reach of frost; but the Wryneck only
devours the small black and the red ant, whose nest is com-
posed of particles of earth brought to the surface by these in-
sects, and these (although we are nearly into the merry month
of May, which by-the-bye, is only to be seen on a canvas in the
Art Galleries) cannot be had.
There is one species of summer migrant which may get
through this terrible weather, the Blackcap Warbler. Its food
consists largely of berries, as well as insects, and as its favourite
food, 011 its arrival in this country, is the ripe ivy berry, it may
share a better fate. There is a plentiful supply of these berries
and strange to say a plentiful supply of these beautiful song-
sters, in fact they are more plentiful than any of our summer
visitors up to the present time. There is one thing I have always

on the Weather and our Summer Birds. 251
contended, and I still contend, that the bird in captivity, properly
kept and properly fed, by those who thoroughly understand the
subject, is far better-off than the bird at liberty ; no doubt this
sounds strange.
I kept a Swallow, the first I ever attempted, for nearly
seven } T ears, in the most perfect health and condition, and the
bird was always in lovely feather and even sang, and birds do not
sing because they are unhappy. This bird had a large aviary to
fly and exercise in, would feed from my hand, and I consider
that that bird was far better off, under my care during those seven
years, than it would have been at liberty, for in its wild state it
would have had to stand the chance of probably being shot at by
some ignorant pot hunter who shoots at everything, there would
be our uncertain climate to face, also vermin and many other
tilings, including the long and trying migration.
It is wonderful what good weather prophets birds are, and
anyone who takes a keen interest in these matters and is a
thorough observer of these things, will notice it. For instance
the Fieldfares, Redwings and Bramblefinches which arrive here
about the first week in October from the far north and take the
place of our summer migrants, which have then left our shores
and gone South for the winter, generally leave for their return
journey to their northern home to breed about the 7th of April.
This year they have appeared in large flocks and for the past
three weeks have been calling loudly, just as they do in winter
on the approach of cold weather. Evidently they were com-
pelled to remain here, although the strong instinct of migra-
tion was in them and their time to go under ordinary circum-
stances, had arrived. We see now, and before the barometer
could tell us, why they stayed. It is certain that they could not
have forged their way north through this arctic weather to pro-
bably find their breeding quarters frozen up and so they have
been compelled to prolong their stay with us.
What I have written is nothing but absolute fact, based
upon my own personal observation and I have studied orni-
thology ever since I was a boy.

Saxicola vionticola.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
This interesting and neat-looking little Wkeatear lias
received no less than eight specific names owing to the remark-
able changes of plumage through which it passes : these appear
to be most marked in the male bird, but if Stark and Sclater's
description of the adult female is accurate, I should say that the
statement that her plumage remains constant throughout life is
not strictly correct. They observe that " Formerly each change
of plumage was considered to represent a distinct species and it
is in this way that the long list of synonyms quoted have (sic.)
arisen."
The seven stages noted are as follows : --
Stage i.--Birds of the year, similar to the female but somewhat
darker in colour.*
Stage 2.--Only differs from Stage i in that the shoulders are
white, though not so conspicuously so as in the
next stage.
Stage 3.--Shoulders white, the median and lesser coverts as well
as the scapulars undergoing the change ; abdomen
commencing to get white.
Stage 4.--The head now begins to become grey ; below from
breast to vent white.
Stage 5.--Head grey or whitisli-grey ; below white (in some the
head becomes white before the belly, in others vice
versa.
Stage 6.--Grey all over; no black ; shoulders greyish-white.
Stage 7.--Whitish-grey all over; shoulders white.
Messrs. Butler, Feilden and Reid, found birds in all these
stages (except the first) pairing with black females and hence
concluded that they represent one single species."
On March 1st Capt. Boyd R. Horsbrugh wrote to me as
follows :-- " I am sending you a pair of Saxicola vionticola and a
* The female is described thus Entire plumage brownish black except the rump
and upper tail-coverts and the bases of all the tail-feathers except the two centre ones, all
of which are pure white."

"Should these birds arrive all right I will send you all my
notes on them for publication. I took a hen Saxicola home the
year before last, but it died on arrival. They feed on ' Century
Food' and mealworms, a supply of each goes with them.
" I brought the Chats up by hand from the nest: the Dong-
Claw was caught adult."
Unfortunately the Dong-Claw died before the ship started,
but the Chats reached Southampton alive, although the food ratr
short the day previously; and consequently they were fed, on the
last day of the voyage, upon raw meat and maggots, which (in
my experience) is a very dangerous diet for young insectivorous
birds.
Owing to a remarkable series of misunderstandings, the
pair of Wheatears found their way to the Zoological Gardens,
and it was not until the 14th that I was able to establish my
claim to them, and get them into my possession. Whether the
raw beef and maggot diet had been continued, I cannot of course
say ; but when I wished to let them out into their flight-cage,
the male would not stir until I put my hand in to fetch him out ~
I noticed also that, although fairly active, he was unnaturally
thirsty ; after two or three days he seemed unable to judge
distances, and when flying up to the lower perch, would some-
times strike it with his chest and fall back to the floor: 011 the
sixth da}' after he reached me I found him crouching on the
floor of the cage half asleep ; and, in spite of nursing and
remedies, he died two hours later. The hen is living and active
as I write.
Now, supposing these birds to be in their first plumage,
they do not answer at all well to Messrs. Stark and Sclater's
descriptions :--
The hen is not brownish-black or even blackish-brown, but
is of a ruddy mouse-brown or smoke-brown colour, with the
exception of the white characters previously noted. The cock
does not resemble the hen at all, but is dark ash-grey, faintly
washed with olive above ; pearly ash-grey, washed with brownish
on breast and flanks below, the lesser wing-coverts are white and

Dr. A. G. Butler,
the median coverts edged and broadly tipped with ashy-white,
the wings otherwise smoky-brown, becoming almost black on
the secondaries, the tail is slaty-black, all but the central feathers
largely white at base, the outermost feathers almost entirely of
that colour ; the rump and upper- (as well as under-) tail-coverts
white.
This male, therefore, although presumably a bird of the
year, seems to correspond most nearly with Stage 6, (almost
\0x25BAS. castor of Blanford and Dresser's Monograph) while the female
is altogether browner than Messrs. Stark and Sclater describe it.
The question is--How many changes, if any, did Capt. Horsbrugh
observe before forwarding the birds to me ? He has not, so far,
sent me on his notes; and I am unable to hold back this article
any longer, because I am short of copy for the Magazine.
The hen is a nice bird, but not particularly confiding; she
flies rapidly backwards and forwards every morning while I am
renewing her food, being evidently nervous until my hand is out
of the cage ; she will not take insects from my fingers, but will
come to the front of the cage and call to me when she wants an
insect ; the sound of the call is not pretty,--a sort of " Hrish
sometimes repeated with variations like the commencement of a
song ; she also sits on a perch looking upwards and opening and
shutting her wings as though she wished to take a long flight.
In Sharpe and Layard's " Birds of South Africa," pp. 246,
247, we read :--" De Vaillant found this bird inhabiting the
mountains of Namaqua Land, and never descending into the
plains, except compelled by great drought. He describes them
as very shy and difficult of approach, hiding themselves in holes
or inaccessible precipices."
Le Vaillant's account of their habits is substantially
correct. We only found them among the rocky mountain sides,
breeding in the holes and crevices. Mr. H. Jackson writes to
us : --" Among the eggs I now send are fourteen of A. monticola,
all from the same pair of birds, our old friends of last 3^ear. This
makes thirty-four of this sort, all or nearl}&amp;apos; all from one pair of
birds. They build in my kraal walls, and no sooner are their
eggs taken than they set to work to make a new nest in a fresh
place, finish it, and lay their eggs in a very short time."

Mr. Ayres observes:--"This bird I shot in the Free
State of Transvaal, but I also saw one 011 the banks of a small
stream near the Tugela in Natal. It appears to be solitary in its
habits, frequenting the steep banks of rivers, and is very shy and
scarce. The stomach of the one I obtained was well filled witlr
insects." Later he writes :--" These chats are to be found in
many localities in the open country of the Transvaal, frequenting,
rocky situations. Their nests are generally placed in crevices
within a few feet of the ground ; but at some of the farmhouses-
tliey may be seen having taken possession of an unfinished
Swallow's nest, under the eaves, where, if not interfered with,,
they become exceedingly tame. Though sombre in colour, they
immediately attract the sight by frequently spreading the tail,
and showing its snow-white feathers. They are also frequently
to be found amongst the ant-hills which are so abundant in the
Transvaal."
Messrs. Stark &amp; Sclater (Birds of South Africa, vol. II.,.
pp. 195, 196) observe :--" The Mountain Chat is very common
in rocky districts, and is generally to be found in the dreariest
and most arid places, especially where there are hills, to which it
generally retreats when disturbed ; like other Chats it moves
jerkily, fluttering its wings and raising and depressing its tail
when it perches on a stone or bush. Its food consists of insects,
which it catches either on the wing or on the ground. It has a
pretty song, which, however, is not often heard. They often sit
in pairs on small ant hills and have a habit, the males especially,,
of soaring a short distance and dropping suddenly again and
then skimming on a considerable way.
Major Butler gives the following notes on its nidifica-
tion : " Found a nest on September 10th, near Newcastle (in
Natal) containing two fresh eggs, and the fragments of another
that had been broken. It was built on the side of a hill under a
slab of rock overlooking a running stream about twenty yards
below, and consisted of fine dr)&amp;apos; grass, roots, etc., neatly put
together and well lined with sheep's wool, horse- and cow-hair,
the whole being supported by a strong embankment of short
pieces of coarse stems, grass-fibres, roots, lumps of dry earth, etc.,
matted together and extended some eight to ten inches from the

edge of the nest to suit the slope of the ground. Eggs pale
green, well-marked with chestnut-red and with a few faint
purplish markings as well, chiefly at the large end where it
forms a conspicuous confluent cap. The eggs measure
*90 x &amp;apos;65."
According to Messrs. Alwin Haagner and Robert H. Ivy,
the eggs are pale blue-green, sometimes plain and sometimes
-speckled with reddish purple (cf. Sketches of South African
Bird Rife, p. 19).
Mr. G. C. Shortridge (Jour. S. Afr. Oru. U11. vol. I, page
.24) says :--" Frequents kopjes : very plentiful; rather wild, going
about in pairs. I did not stay long enough at Hanover to
determine accurately the plumage-changes of the males. I found,
however, all the forms pairing with females. They undoubtedly
change from black to grey, but I believe that the white shoulders
and underparts are peculiar to individual birds which develop
during the black stage ; others never obtain this coloration,
although intermediate forms with more or less white shoulders
are common. The females also vary as to the amount of white
on the tail-feathers."
It would seem that the last word has not yet been said
respecting the changes of plumage in this Wheatear, and therefore
I regret the more that the male should have died so soon after
I received it. Apparently it has not been successfully imported
previously.
I feed the hen upon Trowel's Improved Cecto with a few
.breadcrumbs and a little yolk of egg, well mixed together and
slightly damped ; also mealworms or other insects, spiders, and,
when obtainable, grapes: later I hope to try the hen with
ripe red currants : but I find insectivorous birds such a tie, that
I expect I shall ere long have to give them up ; they have kept
me at home without a day's holiday for about twenty-three
years, and therefore I think I have done my duty by them.

Chamcepelia griseola.
By W. F. Teschemaker.
I recently received an urgent reminder from our excellent
Hon. Correspondence Secretary that a promise I made some
months since to write something for the Magazine had never
been fulfilled. I regret that my choice of subjects is limited, as
I have had no luck with my birds since 1906. The united efforts
of all the inmates of my aviaries this season have only produced
four young Magpie Mannikins, one Yellow-rumped Serin, one
Cirl Bunting and two Ground Doves. As the Foreign Bird Club
is now trying to encourage the breeding of British species,
whereas the Avicultural Society does not (officially at all events)
appear to take much interest in the latter, I am sending some
account of the nesting of the Cirl Bunting to the F.B.C. and I
will make good the promise, previously alluded to, by saying
something about my Dwarf Doves.
The latter were imported by our member Mr. E. W. Harper
last summer and came into my possession in the autumn. My
aviaries were so infested by cats a few years since that I found it
necessary to get rid of all Doves of any species owing to their
great nervousness, but by a system of wire-netting entangle-
ments, such as was not attempted at Mafeking, I am now better
able to repel the attacks of the enemy, so I have recently
acquired one or two species of small Doves. Doves, however,
are not favourites of mine and have never interested me. They
quite lack the three characteristics which I think we admire
most in birds, namely, song, beauty of plumage and vivacity.
The stupidity of the Cohtmbidce is so colossal that I have
often wondered how they have survived at all in the keen struggle
for existence. As a counterpoise to their stupidity, however,
they have great vitality, great fecundity, long life and great
power of flight. With the possible exception of the Diamond
and Cape Doves hardly any I think are attractive from an
artistic point of view, and the weird notes of many of the
foreign doves can only be described as ludicrous. A pair of
Woodpigeons nest in the elm-trees in my garden every }^ear and

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
when their mellow notes ring out in the early morning they
make the voices of the doves in the aviary seem absolutely
insignificant. Doves however have just one advantage, namely,
that they are very easy to breed (or at all events this has been
the case with the few species that I have kept); hence no doubt
their popularity with some of our members.
Chamcepelia griseola is a South American species. I have
not been able to ascertain anything definite with regard to its
distribution or wild life. Mr. Harper writes me as follows :--"I
regret being unable to furnish any particulars beyond stating that
I have often seen these Doves in small parties of two's and three's
on the ground near cattle-sheds in the Botanical Gardens, George-
town, Demerara, where they were evidently feeding upon grain.
I have also observed them up the Demerara River, thirty or forty
miles from the coast, feeding on the ground in the clearings at
the edge of the forest. They appear to be shy birds, easily
taking flight when approached."
Mr. Harper thought that this species had not been pre-
viously imported but, as a matter of fact, I myself had two of
these Doves sent me by a dealer in 1904. They were described
as a pair but, after I kept them over a year, it dawned upon me
that they were two cocks. It is quite likely therefore that others
have been imported and they may even have been bred.
In size they are a trifle smaller than Passerines, compactly
built, wings and tail short. They run and fly well and are very
active. Griseolus of course means "greyish," but I do not think
this is a very accurate description of their colour. The male is
a light blue, when in full colour, and has a few dark metallic
spots on the wings.
The female is a dark fawn colour, inclining to brown, and
has more metallic spots. Her crown is rounded in profile,
whereas that of the male has an angular outline ; she is also
rather smaller. Both sexes have the inner surface of the wings
of the usual salmon pink. The note of the female is a mono-
syllable, generally repeated three times, and sounds like the
word " worp." The note of the male is about a third lower in
pitch and may be rendered " werp." To distinguish them let us
call them "Worp" and "Werp."

07 i the Nesting of the Dwarf Ground Dove. 259
I turned them out in a small division, measuring 12 feet
by 6 feet by 6 k feet high, which I call the "tropical aviary"
because, being entirely enclosed by glazed frames and having
a large pipe area, it generally maintains a high temperature.
Here the}&amp;apos; made themselves quite at home, dividing their time
between the floor and the perches, but they would not take to
any of the nesting sites provided. On the 26th December
" Worp" laid an egg on one of the wire guards covering the liot-
water pipes and a second on the following day, but made no
attempt to incubate them. Several more clutches of eggs were
laid in the same position during the winter, but there was no
attempt at nest-making.
Early in April I turned them out in the Waxbills' aviary,
but here we were at once confronted by a new difficulty. The
outdoor flight of this aviary communicates with the warmed
house by a small aperture in one of the glass frames forming the
sides of the latter. Many species of small foreigners have been
kept in this aviary as well as various Tanagers, Shamasand other
insectivorous species and not one has ever had any difficulty in
finding its way in and out after a few days. But "Worp" and
" Werp " were far too stupid to comprehend the arrangement:
they could find their way into the covered house but could not
get out again. So once more a clutch of eggs was laid on one of
the water pipes.
Again I removed them--this time to my original aviary
which also has a small lean-to house, but one that not even a
Dove could fail to obtain access to. Forthwith "Worp" collected
a little hay and placed it in the fork of an apple tree. As I felt
quite sure that her limited intelligence would not enable her to
build an efficient nest, I constructed one myself and fixed it up
with wire in the position they had selected, with a small wooden
roof over it. I was only just in time for the very next morning
the nest contained an egg. The eggs of this species vary a good
deal in size ; two that I have before me measure &amp;apos;82 by &quot;66, being
rather larger than the average. They are pure white with a
smooth china-like shell.
For a few days all went well. " Werp" used to sit during
the morning and his partner during the afternoon and at night.

260 On the Nesting of the Dwaif Ground Dove.
But one morning I found the eggs on the ground and a hen
Scarlet Tanager in the act of emptying them of their contents.
I decided to catch up everything in the aviary, except the Doves,
so as to give them a fair chance, and in a week's time " Worp"
was once again sitting, and this time she had an aviary entirely
to herself.
I cannot give the period of incubation, because I was
many long miles from home at the time they hatched, watching
the nesting operations of the Montagu Harrier, but on my
return the young were well feathered. " Werp " did most of the
feeding, cramming them after the time-honoured method of the
Dove family-- two at a time.
The young did not leave the nest for nearly three weeks
by which time they could fly as well as their parents and could
run like partridges. They are fawn-coloured, each feather
being margined with .light buff which gives them somewhat a
mottled appearance. I have not so far once seen the young on
the ground but, for all that, I do not think the title of " Ground-
doves " is a misnomer. Their ambulatory powers are great and
they have some of the distinctive habits of ground-birds, as for
instance that of crouching, with beak pressed on the ground and
tail elevated and directed towards the observer, which is a
common habit of some of the Quails and of the Quail-Finch.
The adult pair laid again before the young were inde-
pendent, but I removed the eggs fearing they might desert the
young. " Worp" was furious with me when I robbed her eggs,
clinging to the nest with both feet and striking viciously with
her wings. I had to actually lift her from the nest before I
could secure the eggs.
It is evident that this little species is very prolific, and, as
I said before, absolutely easy to breed.
I am glad to have found a good home for the young pair,
our member Mr. W. T. Page having expressed a wish to have
them.

No. 4 division of the aviary is not used as a nesting house
at all, hut just as a place to turn in one or two odd specimens
and some of the year's young birds when they are old enough to
well do for themselves. It is always useful to keep a place
especially for this purpose, but apart from this, my chief reason
is that not a nest is safe in this house owing to the wickedness of
" Dick," 111}&amp;apos; Masked Parrakeet. He will eat the eggs or even
the young birds, for I once found him eating a young Picni Dove
that was quite a good size. "Dick" is very peculiar with birds
though quite good tempered with people ; I have never known
him bite anyone yet. He has already injured or killed several
birds at different times, but as a rule they have been birds of his
own species. Now I only keep doves in his house, and he
seldom takes any notice of any of them, very rarely he has
sudden outbreaks, and then I have to be on the look out for the
safety of the other birds, but as a rule the offending bird can be
removed before any real harm is done. "Dick" is a very
engaging pet and so tame I can do what I like with him. He
is very gentle and if he may sit on my shoulder or nestle under
my coat he is quite happy, chirping and making strange noises
to show his pleasure. If he sees me talking to another bird and
can attract my attention in no other way he will put on a make-
believe limp in one leg just to get me to notice him. He is a
strange bird in his tastes, and seems to like things the reverse
way on : for instance, he prefers the pips to the orange, the
stalk of the grape to the fruit, and the shell of the pea to the
peas themselves. I have had " Dick " now for some years and
consider him the gem of my small collection. He was brought
over from the Fiji Isles by a sea-captain, and was tame with me
from the very first. The Masked Parrakeet is very handsome,
being a large bird with a very long sweeping tail; the general
colour is very bright emerald green, but the face is black (hence
its name), the eyes bright orange, and the breast yellow shading
into deep orange on the under parts. The long quill feathers in
the wings are bright blue.

In this house is an old cock Greenwing Dove that I have
had for many years--I should think nine or ten. He still looks
very juvenile and in perfect feather. It would be interesting to
know how long doves really live on an average if kept under good
conditions. If a bird is bought adult, as the Greenwing was, of
course its age cannot be determined, but there must be many
cases where the age of aviary-bred birds might be noted.
A Violet or White-fronted Dove in this house is one of my
favourites ; her mate met with a sad end. He was a particularly
fine bird and I do not think bad tempered, but one day I found
him quite blinded in both eyes, they had been pecked, and I
strongly suspected a Bleeding Heart as the culprit. The poor
Violet only lived a few days, his sight was gone and his spirit
seemed quite broken and he had no sense in finding his food.
Violet Doves are never very common, but I expect another mate
for my little hen before the summer is over, as I may have
several birds sent m.e later on from Jamaica.
In No. 6 division I have shut the door between the flight
and the shelter, so dividing the place into two parts, the door is
of wood and wire, and there is a good sized window in the
shelter so it gets plenty of light. In the flight are a pair of
Aurita Doves and their young one, a pair of Cockatiels and my
second Masked Parrakeet "Jack," a very old bird. I have had
"Jack" a long time and have tried to make him care for me but
not with much success. One minute I may pet him in safety,
the next I must look out for a bite. He does not try much to
bite in an ordinary way, but has a method of his own of striking
out with his beak. He is a strange bird--not caring for women
at all--but very fond of men, and was devoted to the groom who
used to see to the aviaries, letting him pick him up and do what
he liked with him without showing the least inclination to bite.
Last spring the groom died, and "Jack's" distress was great
he missed him very much.and sat constantly on the watch with
an expectant look that was pathetic to see. Now "Jack" has
made great friends with one of the gardeners who at present has
charge of the birds, and it is amusing to see how the bird will
come to him (when he will go to no one else), bowing his head
up and down to show his pleasure.

The cock Cockatiel is a dear little bird, that I bred some
years ago. He will not come on your hand, but will take a
biscuit and whisper his two sayings that he is "Tommy''and
"pretty boy" in the softest voice in your ear. Strangely enough
he will come as near as possible to your face, but declines your
hand altogether. A few weeks ago I gave "Tommy" a mate
and he was just overjoyed. It was funny to watch their first
meeting, he was so nearly wild with excitement that he kept
telling the bewildered hen that he was "Tommy" and "pretty
boy " over and over again till she looked as if she really thought
he must be out of his mind. They are now a very happy little
couple for they are sitting very steadily on three perfectly white
eggs. "Tommy" is so filled with pride and importance that he
has rather forsaken me, his time being spent in jealously guard-
ing the nest box or sitting on the eggs, and woe to an Aurita
Dove if it comes too near. If I look inside the box he fluffs out
his feathers and makes a hissing noise at me.
The Shelter in this division only contains some Barbary
Doves (kept as foster parents if needed for rarer doves eggs) and
my Orange Winged Amazon Parrot " Cric." His real name is
" Criccietli," called after the little Welsh watering place, where I
first saw him and bought him. "Cric" is a great pet. He is
very fond of me, and with him I always feel it is not a case of
cupboard love, for his great happiness is for me to talk to him
and pet him, often refusing dainties till I have noticed him. He
is very tame and comes out in the garden on my hand or shoulder
without any fear of his flying away. Sunday is our happiest day
when we see the most of each other, and can sit out together in
the garden, but it usually ends in my not getting much reading
done if " Cric " is there. He is a very gentle bird, and when he
is with me insists on being noticed and will give me little kisses
on my face and neck if I don't talk to him and pet him sufficiently.
His look of supreme contentment when he has achieved his
object is most expressive.
The other parrots I have are a pair of Senegals called
" Max " and " Bridget." The former is a most intelligent bird.
I taught him to pick a nut from my pocket, and he has very
quaint conceited little ways, being very vain and self-important,

but neither lie nor " Bridget" are entirely to be trusted, and even
a pinch on your finger from one of them is no joke, but it is only
fair to them to say they have never really bitten me. The
Senegal Parrot is a very pretty little bird, being bright light
emerald green, with very clear orange breast and a grey head
and yellow eyes. One great drawback to Senegals is their des-
tructiveness to woodwork. Their beaks are so strong that they
will soon ruin any aviary, and even putting special blocks of
soft wood for them to gnaw at will not cure them of biting
where they should not.
I have just had a pair of most beautiful Barraband Parra-
keets very kindly given to me by a friend. I had never kept
this parrakeet before, and am charmed with their gentle ways
and graceful shape. " Madame," the hen, is green with beautiful
salmon rose under feathers in her long tail, and soft blush of
pink and blue mingling-with the greeu on her face. " Monsieur"
is much more gorgeous, he is a very vivid green with bright
yellow on the forehead and throat and broad band of rich scarlet
running round the latter in front. Both birds are getting tamer
(I have not had them a week yet) but the cock is the shyer of
the two.
I have just one more little aviary and flight, but this is
only occupied by several Dwarf or Ruddy Turtles and their
three young ones. This very pretty little Indian Dove is not
common in England, and the hen being hardly ever imported is
decidedly rare. This is a tiny dove (rather smaller than a
Senegal) and the colour of the cock is brick red, with a soft blue
grey head and broad black collar round the back of the neck.
The hen is quite distinct from the cock in colour being dun-
brown with a black collar. The young ones are just the colour
of the hen until some months old. I find these little doves one
of the easiest of their kind to breed, though they are very shy
and must, when nesting, be let severely alone.
A year or two ago there appeared to be none bred in
England (though they had been bred years ago) for the hens
were almost unknown, but I am gradually raising a stock of them
again and hope they will be re-established. They are such
beautiful little birds I think every dove lover should keep them,

and the\&amp;apos; r are of a most peaceable nature. The little flock I have
live in perfect happiness together.
I must apologise, before concluding, to the older members,
that these notes may in part be what I wrote about for the
Magazine years ago, but the Society has greatly changed since
then, there are so many fresh members, that I hope I may be
forgiven, as these are chiefly written for them and for beginners in
aviculture.
If every member would keep an aviary log-book and just
jot down each day any little observation on the birds, the
information so obtained would be of great value to the cause of
aviculture in general, and no bird-keeper who loves his birds
knows, till he has tried it, how interesting it is to read his
old aviary records and compare the days of the past with the
record of the present.

With the June number of British Birds the second volume
commences and the Editors are already in a position to offer an
attractive programme for the months to come : articles by Messrs.
Boyd Alexander, E. Bidwell, J. E- Bonhote, W. H. Kirkman,
Commander H. Eynes, W. M. J. Nicoll and Prof. Eloyd Morgan
being promised.
In the present number Mr. W. H. Mullens gives an account
of some early British Ornithologists and their works ; Messrs.
Robert Newstead and T. A. Coward describe an example of
Sclilegel's Petrel, a new British and European bird found dead
under a tree near Tarporley, Cheshire, on the 1st of April of the
present year. Mr. Heatley Noble explains the means of
identification of the various species of Ducks' eggs, and Messrs.
Witlierby and Ticehurst continue their account of the additions
to our knowledge of British Birds since 1899.
Among the Notes Mr. G. M. Beresford Webb refers to a
notice in last month's number respecting the shooting of a Nut-
cracker in Kent and states that one escaped from his aviaries
three days previously. It would be interesting if we could have

Preliminary Report on an Investigation of the seasonal changes
of Color in Birds. By C. William Beebe. The American
Naturalist, vol. XLII., No. 493, Jan. 1906.
The experiments of Mr. Beebe are all extremelyinteresting,
and that described in the article forwarded to us is especially so :
it deals with the cause and factors which determine the seasonal
change in the males of the Scarlet Tanager (of North America)
and the Bobolink.
Mr. Beebe first suggests seven possible factors which may
influence this change of color ; but, the experiment which he
describes (and which had the remarkable result of completely
eliminating the autumn moult, so that the bird, in the spring,
moulted from nuptial plumage to nuptial plumage--the green
winter plumage being skipped) only dealt with the "general
condition of the bird's body--whether fat or lean."
The selected birds were not allowed to breed ; the supply
of light was gradually cut off, aud the amount of food increased ;
as obesity in caged birds renders any excitement or sudden fright
liable to cause apoplexy, the birds were kept in a room in which
they were never disturbed and where there was no noise : they
took little exercise and naturally became very fat, and when the
time for the autumn moult arrived, not a feather was shed. The
songs diminished and gradually died away&amp;apos;-; but when a bird was
gradually brought into the light for a week or two, and meal-
worms were added to its diet, there was a full resumption of
song.
His experiment tends to prove " that the sequence of
plumage in these birds is not predestined through inheritance
bringing about an unchangeable succession, in the case of the
Tanager, of scarlet-green, scarlet-green, year after year, but

that it may.be interrupted by certain external factors in the
environmental complex."
As Mr. Beebe says :--" There is a great satisfaction in
thus making even the merest beginning at threshing out these
problems." Ed. pro tem.
The World's Birds, a simple and popular classification of the Birds of
the World. By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U., etc.
Hutchinson &amp; Co., Paternoster Row.
An exceedingly useful and handy little book containing a
vast amount of information in a condensed form.
The families of birds are considered alphabetically because,
as the author rightly says, they "are so numerous, and their
relationships to each other, even if they were completely agreed
upon by ornithologists, could not in any case be exhibited
naturally in linear order."
Under each family Mr. Finn gives first a popular diagnosis,
a general idea of size, general form, character of plumage, pecu-
liarities of newly hatched young, account of nest, eggs, food,
gait, flight, notes, disposition and habits, economic quality,
suitability for life in captivity and distribution : the importance
of the work as a book of reference will therefore be at once
seen.
Under Passerine Birds, which Mr. Finn calls the Passeridce,
the various groups usually accepted by Ornithologists as distinct
families are treated as subfamilies, and a few sentences are de-
voted to the characteristics of some of the more striking forms
of each group.
Mr. Finn's book will be welcomed by all bird-lovers as of
considerable educational value, and we trust that it will have a
wide circulation; it is profusely illustrated by photogravures
from living and stuffed specimens, and there are some useful
outline blocks in the text. Ed. pro. tem.

Sir,--A s I have already recorded in the pages of our Magazine, I
turned out a quantity of Japanese Robins (Leiothrix In tens) in the early
spring of 1907, most of which, after a month or two, disappeared. One
pair, however, nested in the garden and reared three young ones, but after
June of last year neither they or their progeny 7 were seen again.
When the great snow fall came in April of this year, a pair of these
birds, presumably the same pair that nested, put in an appearance outside
my garden aviaries, and since that have been seen amongst some thick
shrubs in the wood close at hand during this month (June), where by 7 the
chattering they 7 make, they 7 afe apparently nesting.
Where have they been throughout the period of a year ? One looked
for them, but there was no sign of them.

BULLFINCH LOSING FEATHERS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995564631578947" page_id="32669238"  page_num="Page 268" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I n reply 7 to the question asked by 7 a member concerning a cock
Bullfinch losing his wing-featliers in one night, I think the bird had a fright
and banged about.
Some years ago I kept a pair of young Bullfinches, which I had
reared from the nest, in my bedroom, and I found that, though perfectly 7
tame and healthy 7 , they were rather subject to panics at night when the
room was dark. They would be sleeping peaceably 7 , when suddenly 7 , for no
reason whatever that could be discovered, they would wake and dash about
the cage in an ecstacy 7 of fright. I generally quieted them by striking a
light and speaking, but I almost always found that one or both of them
had knocked out their wing-feathers during the panic. Whether the alarm
was caused by one bird moving in its sleep and touching the other, or
whether it was pure night-mare I never could discover,
The feathers soon grew again, and as the birds became older and
steadier the panics ceased and they 7 only 7 lost their feathers in the usual
way by 7 moulting at the proper season. E. F. ChawneR.
This is exactly 7 the conclusion to which I came myself, on receipt of
our correspondent's letter, and I believe I wrote to that effect.

A BIRD'S VENGEANCE.
On the 30th of October, 1907, Mr. W. E. Teschemaker sent me a pair
of Chingolo Song-Sparrows which he had bred and I turned them into one
of my smaller aviaries in company with a good-tempered Long-tailed
Wliydah (Chera progne).
Soon after the Whydali had resumed its summer dress, about May,
190S, the Song-Sparrow determined to go to nest in a covered box (cigar-

box pattern) hanging high np in the aviarv. After partly filling the box
with hay, feathers and wadding, it suddenly seems to have struck them that
the Whydah's longest tail-feathers could he coiled round so as to form an
admirable lining to the cup ; they therefore watched their opportunity and
stealing up close to the Whydah suddenly tweaked out one of these
feathers and flew triumphantly off with it.
From time to time this trick was repeated, much to the annoyance
of the Whydah, which crouched down and made grimaces at the Chingolos
whenever they approached him : eventually only one of the longest feathers
remained, and the hen Cliingolo coveted it to her hurt ; she appears to have
snapped at it about two inches from its extremity, just giving the Whydah
room to turn suddenly upon her. O11 the morning of June 21st I found her
dead upon the floor, every feather plucked from her back and one side of
her face, the inner secondaries torn out and all the flight- and tail-feathers
broken off short. The place where the Whydah's tail-feather was seized is
clearly visible, the feather being bent abruptly at the spot. A.G.B.

THE WHITE-BELLIED AMETHYST STARLING.
By Dr. Hopkinson, D.S.O.
The Amethyst Starling (Pholidauges leucogaster) is certainly
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99939976" page_id="32669247"  page_num="Page 269" year="" vol="">
one of the loveliest of the smaller Gambian birds which I know
or have seen during my six years service in that part of West
Africa. It is, however, but rarely imported into Europe,--so
rarely that a male I brought home to the Zoo in 1906 was the first
specimen that they had ever had there, and, as far as I could
ascertain, the first to reach England alive. It is a pity from our
point of view that this is so, as judging from my experience with
the two males, which I have kept as cage-birds since I have been
in the Gambia, they are long lived and easily catered for in
captivity, while the male's beautiful plumage--a metallic royal
purple set off by the purest white--must excite the admiration of
all and would ensure high honours on the show bench.
The plumage of the male is as follows : Whole upper sur-
face including the wing-coverts, together with the sides of the
face, throat, and upper chest, royal purple with metallic re-
flections, bluish or reddish according to the light or its angle of
incidence ; this varying sheen, under certain lights, often gives
the appearance of a glowing ember, so that the bird looks red,
although no sign of such colour is visible under ordinary illu-
mination. The rest of the under surface is pure white with a
pale greyish tinge towards the sides. The lores, chin, a line
through the eye and the primary quills are black ; the edge of
the wing white, its under surface blackish grey ; tail feathers
blackish with a purple gloss above, except the two centre ones,
which are entirely purple ; below they are a very dark grey.

Dr. Hopkinson,
Some males have brown edges to nearly all the purple feathers ;
this one finds chiefly in birds shot during the dry season. These
may be young birds, or, on the other hand, there may be an
annual change of plumage, the full breeding dress being only
attained in the rains (the nesting season) by the loss of these
brown edges. Both my birds were caught just before the com-
mencement of the rains, and neither of them had a sign of brown
edging. The female is very different from the male; above
brown, mottled, most of the feathers having lighter edges ; wings
and tail darker; below she is whitish with an indistinct rufous
band across the chest. The young in their first year resemble
the female. The irides are bright yellow in the male, a paler
yellow in the female. Length about 6 \ inches, that is rather
larger than a Nightingale. Bill and feet black in both sexes.
The range of the species extends throughout West Africa ;
in the Gambia they are not uncommon, chiefly within about 50
miles of the coast, where the country is largely forest or covered
with thicker "bush" than further inland. A few are resident all
the year round, but their numbers are much increased in May by
a large influx from other parts, especially from the southward,
mostly paired by the time of their arrival and evidently coming
to breed with us during the rains, though I have never yet had
the luck to find any nest. I expect, however, that they breed in
holes in the larger trees, for when travelling in the forests at this
season or in the two following months one meets with about
equal numbers of these Starlings and Golden Orioles (O. auratus )
flying about the higher branches of the African Mahoganies and
other similar trees. The Orioles are common in the Gambia all
the year round, but increase in numbers before the rains and
mostly move to the thicker " bush " or forest country for the
breeding season, nesting in the higher branches of such trees.
Near Bathurst, the chief town and headquarters of the Gambia,
situated on a swamp-bordered sandy island at the mouth of the
river, the Amethyst Starlings are not uncommon in the thickets
which border the causeway running to the mainland through the
swamp which extends behind the sand-barrier of the seashore.
They are generally seen in pairs, the male usually leaving cover
first, to be followed a few moments later by his plainly attired

mate, and when the light of the setting sun happens to fall 011
the male as he flies by, the play on colours is wonderful,--at one
moment the upper parts and breast may be a deep ruby-red,
flame-like in its intensity ; at the next, as the incidence of the
rays alters, the normal magnificent purple, to be followed perhaps
by another flash of fiery red or by an eclipse-like change to dull
blackish as the bird drops into the shade of some bush.
Their food consists of various berries and busli-fruits,
especially those of the " Soto " tree, a kind of wild fig, which is
very plentiful in this country ; one of these, when its fruit is ripe,
is always alive with different species of fruit- or nectar-eating
birds and among the crowd (at any rate from May to October) a
pair of Amethyst Starlings will probably be found. They also
eat a good many insects, especially, I think, those kinds attracted
to over-ripe or rotting fruit, but at times one sees them hunting
for ants or other creeping things on the ground or, more
occasionally, catching insects in the air, particularly the flying
ants as they leave the earth on their first and only nuptial flight
during the early rains.
In captivity this Starling makes a delightful pet, his lovely
plumage, which he keeps in spotless condition, being by no
means his only attraction, for he soon becomes tame, has a fair
share of the usual Starling intelligence, and although he is no
great singer, his notes, a series of soft fluty whistles, are pleasing
to the ear and very different from the harsh screams and cries of
his relations the Glossy Starlings. Besides, as I said above, he
is not at all difficult to cater for; my two birds lived for the first
month after capture almost entirely 011 live " Bugabug " or white
ants, the insect food (fortunately for birds, but unfortunately
for the owners of stores and boxes) so easily obtainable in West
Africa. Later on I got out a supply of one of the advertised
mixed " Insect-foods," and on this and soaked dog-biscuit the
one which I succeeded in bringing home did well for the three
months he was in my possession.
Eventually he reached the Zoo., fit and well in spite of all
the travelling he had done by land and sea, and there he still
flourishes, eating chiefly the soft-food mixture used there, but
occasionally taking a peck or two at a piece of banana or orange.

On the White-bellied Amethyst Starling.
With me he hardly ever touched any fruit, in fact he seemed
quite content with the very uninteresting looking food-mixture,
his only preference being for the ants' eggs, which he always
picked out first, but when they were finished he always cleared
up every scrap of the meal or the biscuit which formed the
basis of his food. He delighted in his bath, taking one whenever
he got the chance, and very soon became tame enough to take
an insect from the fingers, if it was one he liked; but his tastes-
in this line were distinctly delicate, as he would have nothing to
say to a grasshopper or other hard-skinned beast, but approved
of anything small, soft and squashy ; cockroaches, even babies,
the only sea-luxury available for bird-passengers, he would not
even look at, although he was all the time on rather short rations,
so that on board ship his diet was of the simplest, but simple as
it was it evidently agreed with him, as he arrived in perfect health
and practically perfect condition.
In Senegal and other parts of French West Africa the
native skin-hunters shoot a good many males for their skins, for
which they ask about a franc apiece, but I have never seen or
heard of one being caught alive by the professional native netters,
even by those who catch the ordinary Glossy Starlings. My
birds were both caught quite accidently and unexpectedly by
small boys who had set a few nooses for Weaver birds or doves in
the bush just outside their village. The birds' irregular wander-
ings and comparatively solitary habits are their safeguard, as the
native catcher generally sets his nets at water, or at any rate at a
place where he can catch numbers at a time ; he has no use for
birds which can only be caught "one-one," as the expressive
language of the Coast has it. From Pholidauges point of view
may this long continue, though I must confess to hoping that
sooner or later I may have one or two more of the beauties to
bring home.

Pholidauges leucogaster.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
This beautiful bird was imported by Dr. E. Hopkiusou,
who presented the male from which our illustration is taken to
the London Zoological Society in 1906. Dr. Sharpe places the
species in the genus Pholidauges, and, as it is the rule of our
Society to follow the nomenclature of the "Catalogue of Birds."
that name is retained here ; but Cinnyricinclus, adopted by Captain
Shelley, appears to have priority.
As an aberrant Glossy Starling it might be supposed that
this bird would fail into Oates' family Eulabetidce ; he places
Calornis (a group of birds building pensile nests like many of
the Icteridee) in that family : Shelley however places Sturnus
between the Glossy Starlings and the typical Grackles, and I
am satisfied that be is right in doing so.
Oates' family Eulabetidce is based upon a single character
--the presence of rictal bristles ; if, however, we restrict it to the
genus Eulabes (Mainatus of Shelley's "Birds of Africa") we
have a far better defined family. It is true that both Eulabes,
Calornis , Pholidauges, Eamprocolius and some species of Eampro-
tornis and Spreo lay spotted eggs, but there is vast dissimilarity
in the character of the nests of the different Glossy Starlings
just as there is among those of tli Icier idee, some building pensile
nests, others structures akin to those of the Corvidce, while others
again build in holes, and Fischer's Starling seems to build like a
Weaver bird : then again there are exceptions as regards the
spotting of the eggs {Lamprotornis purpuropterus).
To my mind the great width and remarkable sexual
difference of the bill in Eulabes, the Co?vine aspect of the various
species, and their generally more clumsy build, sufficiently
distinguish them from the Sturnidce. I11 the character of the bill
there is a distinct suggestion of Ptilonorhynchus, only both
maxilla and mandible are less concealed under short stiff feathers.
I therefore do not agree with Professor Ridgway in ignoring Mr.
Oates' family altogether, but would restrict it to Eiilabes.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
although constant in certain families, is very inconstant in others ;
not only is it inconstant in the same family, but in the same
genus, species, and even in the same clutch, and in the various
families of Starlings (which link the two large Fincli-families to
the Crows) inconstancy may well be expected.
According to Captain Shelley Pholidauges leucogaster in-
habits Tropical Africa from 17 0 N. lat. to Gaboon, on the west,
and to the &quot;Equator in Central and Eastern Africa ; he tells us
that, " in Liberia, Mr. Biittikofer met with it most frequently in
the open country, the females and young birds perching together
on the bushes while the full-plumage males kept by themselves
at some little distance."
The female differs greatly in colouring from the male;:
being brown, with pale margins to the feathers; the inner webs
of the flights mostly suffused with pale cinnamon ; the cheeks
white, streaked with brown ; the under surface white, slightly
sandy on the throat, at the back of which and on the breast are
dark brown triangular spots, becoming rounder towards the back
of the breast and at the sides of the vent, and longer at the sides
of the abdomen which are brownish ; under wing-coverts and
axillaries brown with rufescent edges and the flights below
rufescent on inner webs.
Shelley says (Birds of Africa, vol. V., pp. 39, 40) ; " During
my visit to the Gold Coast I met with the species on a few
occasions in February, between Accra and Abokobi, always in
fairly large flocks of about a score." Ussher writes : "This bird
is widely distributed over the whole of the Guinea Coast, and is
of very general occurrence 011 the Gold Coast. It is usually
observed in pairs, and occasionally in some numbers. I have
seen the low bushes in the vicinity of the town of Lagos (on the
Slave Coast) tenanted by them in large quantities, the brilliant
plumage of the male contrasting markedly with the sober colour-
ing of the female and the pied tints of the immature birds. They
were feeding eagerly on the berries of a description of ' wait-a-
bit' thorn, very abundant in some localities of the Guinea Coast.
The male in full plumage, seen flying low in the bright sunlight,
is undoubtedly one of the most exquisite birds in Africa, and a
marked difference of colour is observable among even full-

plumaged males, some having coppery or golden reflections on
the rich puce colour of the feathers, whilst others decidedly
incline to a deep violet blue of equal beauty. Their habits
appear to be similar to the Shining Grackles' in general, and did
not present anything noteworthy to my observation."
" Mr. Hartert met with the species at Loko, on the Niger,
in May and July, feeding on fruit." "On the eastern side of
the continent, the most southern range known for the species
is Nandi"; here Mr. Jackson met with a flock of five or six,
"attracted by the small fruit of a large tree in the garden."
Lord Lovat writes: "Met with only in the valley of the
Blue Nile and its tributaries. I once observed this Starling
hawking for flies like a Bee-eater."
"Heuglin found them in the lowlands of Semien, along
the Mareb and Takase Rivers, and in Bergemeder up to 9,000
feet. In May and June they were abundant on the low ground
of the Samhar coast, at the Anseba and in Bogosland in families
of young and old birds. Early in summer he found them assem-
bled in large flocks, consisting of both old and young birds in
the thick forests between the Gazelle and Kosanga Rivers."
Although the above account gives us very little information
respecting the wild life of this beautiful Starling, there can be
no doubt that it would differ very little indeed from the closely
related P. verreanxi of which we read " Small fruits form their
principal diet, although they sometimes feed on flies and the
winged females of the white ant, rising and taking them on the
wing similarly to Flycatchers."
Stark and Sclater observe of P. verreanxi (which they
regard as merely a subspecies of P. leiicogaster) Birds of South
Africa, vol. I., pp. 46, 47 :--"These beautiful Starlings although
not so common as some of the other Glossy Starlings in Natal,
are by no means rare in Autumn and Winter. At this season
they are almost invariabN in flocks, consisting entirely of either
male or female birds. Towards Spring they appear to migrate
northwards, sometimes after they have paired.
During their stay in Natal they feed chiefly on berries and
small fruit, but also on insects, and particularly upon the flying
termites which they take on the wing, darting upon them from

the top of some convenient bush or other advantageous station.
In the Transvaal many of these birds are resident, particularly
in the Rustenberg district, where they breed ; at the same time
the majority appear to migrate towards Spring. When migrating
or moving for any distance, they fly in flocks and usually at a
considerable height.
Anderson remarks that in Daniara Rand this species is
migratory " arriving at the approach of the rainy season, and
gradually leaving as the country dries up, though I have observed
a few individuals remaining long after the general emigration
was over, and these may probably stay throughout the year. The
exquisitely coloured males arrive first, and, as far as I have
observed, associate but little with the sombre females, from which
they differ so marvellously in appearance."
" Like the other Glossy Starlings, this species builds its
nest in the holes of trees, in the Transvaal in December, lining
some natural hollow, or the old uest-liole of a Barbet, with wool
and feathers, over which they (sic.) place green leaves, which
are renewed from time to time. The eggs, usually four in
number, are pale blue, sparingly spotted with pale brown at the
large end. They measure 0.9^ x 0.70." According to Guy A. K.
Marshall the cries of this bird are somewhat harsh, but the male
frequently utters a very sweet, plaintive whistle. Jackson de-
scribes the nest and eggs as follows:--"Nest found in hole of
hollow stump, five feet from the ground, composed of fine green
leaves, small, like those of privet. Two eggs, pale greenish blue,
with reddish brown speckles."
Owing to the generally high price and noisy habits of the
Glossy Starlings I have never possessed one of them, although
their great beauty has often tempted me. They should be quite
easy to breed in a large outdoor aviary provided that one could
secure both sexes ; but unhappily the females of many species
are rarely imported or not at all. In a natural classification I
should judge that the Glossy Starlings, with Calornis at their
head, should certainly come immediately after the Icterine Star-
lings and at the opposite extremity of the family from the true
Mynahs-- Ac?idothe?-es and allies, which should precede the
Eulabetidee: after the latter the Ptilonorhynchidee and Paradiseidce

<bodyText confidence="0.997933" page_id="32669255"  page_num="Page 277" year="" vol="">
By Hubert D. Astley, M.A., F.Z S.
In May of this year, Captain Perreau brought me some
interesting and rarely imported birds, which he had caught in
India amongst the hills.
I.--The Beue-headed Rock Thrush (Petrocincla cinclorhyncha&amp;apos;)
may perhaps head the list as the brightest in colouring. Smaller
than the European Rock Thrush (JP. saxatilis&amp;apos;) he is also more
brilliant.
The top of the head, occiput, throat and shoulders, are a
beautiful lazuline blue ; the cheeks and back, black ; the wings
blackish with a broad white patch across the secondaries. The
tail black, with a bloom of the same blue as on the head ; the
breast and the whole of the underparts, the rump and tail-coverts,
are full bright rufous : the beak is black, the legs brown.
When the bird is facing one, his colouring is not unlike
that of an English Kingfisher.
My bird is timid in his cage, and yet he will readily take a
mealworm from my fingers, even when I put my whole hand in ;
and when let loose in the bird room he is fairly bold.
Once I heard him utter a few notes, the part of his song,
sounding somewhat like those of a European Rock Thrush.
One day he escaped and was not to be seen for eight hours,
when quite by chance, whilst walking in the garden, I spied him
amongst some Rhododendron bushes. Fortunately his powers
of flight were not great, as his feathers were considerably worn
after his long voyage from India; and it was not long before,
and with the help of a mealworm, I decoyed him into his cage,
which he seemed pleased once more to occupy.
He had evidently been searching for food, for his bill was

278 Mr. Hubert D. Astj.ey,
encrusted with earth : but it looked as if he had been unsuccess-
ful by his puffy appearance and his appetite for supper! It is
curious that a wild-caught bird should be so helpless.
This Blue-headed Rock Thrush must not be confused with
the other Rock Thrush, which is found in the same part of the
world, and which is considerably larger : the male being mostly
blue on the upper parts, with a chestnut breast and lower parts.
This one is Petrocincla erythrogaster. I am not sure that he
is styled Petrocincla by those who love many names and divisions
of families. Gould calls him a "Tardus." He is also a bird much
to be desired.

II. Then there is the lovely little BuJE Bush Chat.
Picture a glorified Wheatear. He is smaller than that
bird. His upper parts are a rich blue-grey ; a black stripe runs
through his eye with a white eyebrow, and his underparts are
bright chestnut. A very graceful little bird, which flirts and
jerks his tail up and down, and by this, tells you a great deal
of what he is thinking about.
Unlike the Wheatear, he keeps amongst thick shrubs ; and
is, I should think, difficult to catch sight of. He too will take a
mealworm from the fingers ; indeed, for that matter, so will all
the birds about which I am discoursing.
There is something very fascinating about all the members
of the Chat tribe, and they are extremely intelligent.
ir 3 ?
III. The Pi.umbeous Redstart. (.Ryacornis fuliginosjis).
There is one to be seen (also brought over by Capt.
Perreau) in the Bird House, at the Zoo, in Regent's Park.
He is not unlike the European Black Redstart. Except
for his tail, which is chestnut, he is wholly of a rich deep grey-
blue, and the said tail is fanned out and jerked in a pretty wa} r ,
not rapidly like an English Redstart's, but veiy knowingly.
When out of his cage, he will get under a table, and in
obscure corners, and there he will sing [sotto voce] a sweet
warble. I suppose one may speak of singing a warble, as much
as of singing a song ! A little rascal as to returning to his cage,
dodging in to pick up the tempting mealworm, and out again in
a flash !

IV. Blue-headed Robin (. Phcenicura cceruleocephala&amp;apos;).
" Grey-headed " would be a more appropriate description, for
grey it is, and not at all blue, as one understands blue.
A fine French grey ! there is no getting over that! so that
" Cceruleocephala " is a misnomer. Well ! this grey occupies the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99575796969697" page_id="32669257"  page_num="Page 279" year="" vol="">
whole of the top of the head, except that the black of the throat
and breast extends narrowly up and round above the nostrils.
The back and tail are also black. The wings, dark brown, with
a broad patch of white on the scapulars and part of the secon-
daries ; the abdomen whitish, the bill and feet, black.
All this means that one sees a little bird, the shape, size,
and style of our Robin, looking at first sight, rather like a Pied
Flycatcher with a grey cap on.
His wife is brown with a tail inclining to chestnut, and
she somewhat resembles a Spotted Flycatcher, when not exam-
ined too closely.
Gould says that the Grey-headed Robin has a tendency
to unite itself to the genus Saxicola.
It's call-note is very Robin-like. I have a pair, and they
are confiding birds, and very pretty. The male bird met with an
unfortunate accident on his way to me. His left thigh was
badly broken, and when he was taken out of his travelling cage,
his poor leg hung loose and helpless behind him. I bound it
up to his breast with a very fine tape, putting it twice round his
body under the wings, and although he managed to loosen it, so
that things looked worse than before, I persevered, with the
happy result that the fracture mended completely, and in three
weeks the leg was as sound as the other one. Before it mended,
the poor little bird hopped about gallantly on one foot, and was
an extremely good patient.

V. Himalayan Ruby-throated Warbler (Calliope
pectoralis&amp;apos;) [Gould].
Past, but not least by any means in point of beauty.
He is the only one that is out in an aviary, and seems to
be doing well, constantly singing his melodious song, which
somewhat resembles that of the Blue-throated Warbler, to whom
of course he is closely allied.

And when he warbles; his brilliant ruby, just under his
&quot;bill, glistens and expands, and shines out brightly against the
rest of his colouring, which is grey and black and white.
Long in the shanks, he runs in Wagtail fashion on the
ground, flirting his tail up and down.
Whilst singing he spreads his black and white tail out
in fan fashion. One always knows when he is going to sing,
or it seems to me that the tail is spread a moment before
the notes are uttered.
Although the beautiful spot of ruby-red does not extend
as far down the throat, as in the case of the Siberian Ruby-
throated Warbler, yet the latter bird is not so pretty as it's
Himalayan cousin, for the Siberian bird is for the most part of a
brown hue above, not that he is not extremely pretty, whilst the
one from India has a fine black gorget extending over the breast
around the ruby, the upper parts are soft dark grey, the abdomen
white, and the tail feathers black with white bases and large
white spots at the termination of each one. A dull white line
runs round and above the nostrils in the form of eyebrows over
the eyes.
All this applies to the male bird ; the female is principally
brown ; but she has the whitish eyebrows, and whity-brown
terminations to the tail-feathers.
Dr. Jerdon states that the White-tailed Ruby-Throat is
found throughout the Himalayas, from Cashmere to Sikkim.
" I saw it," he says, "at Darjeeling, where it is not common,
" frequenting thick brushwood, and coming to the road to feed
" on insects. Adams found it at high elevations, among rocks
" and precipices in the N.W- Himalayas."
The range of the species goes as far as Turkestan, Assam,
and also to the Eastward in Moupin.
These birds nest up to an elevation of 12,000 feet at least,
iu crevices of rocks.
The nest is a warm saucer-shaped pad of very fine moss
and fern-roots closely felted together. The eggs are a uniform
pale salmon buff. So says Mr. Hume in his book " Nests and
Eggs of Indian Birds."
Each of these birds that I have written about would by

in possessing too many, for one is unable to make the most of
their individual charms, or to devote time to taming them, were

A pair of Himalayan Ruby-Throated Warblers in an aviary

be if these charming little birds were to build amongst the stones-

One would want a tiny stream trickling amongst the
boulders to form a shallow pool below, where dainty feet would
trip, and daintier plumage be refreshed by falling drops.

By Edgar F. Stead.
[From The Weekly Press , Christchurch, N.Z , Feb. 26th, 190S.]
Having for four years tried to get some photographs of
keas, and also some live birds and eggs, I readily accepted an
invitation to visit Glentliorn, the last station back up the Wilber-
force, where from past experience, I knew that I should receive
every kindness and assistance. There are, moreover, at Glen-
thorn several keas, more or less tame, kept as call birds, and
these would be invaluable. From behind the homestead, a steep
broken range runs away up the Wilberforce, broken every mile
or so by deep gullies, partly bush clad, and partly bare rock and
shingle. In one of these ravines, appropriately named the Jagged
Spur Gully, I had years ago seen several keas, and it was there
that I decided to go 011 my latest trip.
Saturday morning, January nth, therefore, found me in
the train for Glentunnel, whence I was driven to Mr. Phillips's
station, The Point. There I met a friend, H., and, in company
with him left The Point on Tuesday for Lake Coleridge, Mr.
Phillips kindly lending us a buggy and a nice tame horse for
the journey up to Glentliorn and back.

Mr. Edgar F. Stead,
At Lake Coleridge we were hospitably received, and, stay-
ing there over Wednesday, we left on Thursday afternoon for
*Glenthorn, eighteen miles further on. Reaching the Harper
river we found the crossing extremely rough, all the ford having
been washed away, so we decided to leave the buggy on this side
and pack our swag the remaining three miles. On Friday we
were very busy making traps and cages to carry our call birds.
About midday the musterers came in, our host among them, and
we learned that they were going up the Wilberforce on Sunday
to camp at a gully about two miles past the Jagged Spur, so we
made arrangements to have our swag dropped en route. On
\0x25A0Saturday afternoon H. and I started off up a spur behind the
homestead with a call bird and three traps, which we set in a
shingle slip. Our traps were cages of wire netting shaped like a
pudding-bowl, and we simply propped them up with a " figure
four," which we baited with a piece of meat. The call bird we
placed near the traps, so as to attract the wild keas from a
distance.
THE CAEE BIRD.
Before breakfast on Sunday we climbed to our traps, but
-no keas had been there, so we gathered things together and went
back to the house. The call bird, which had never been in a
small cage before, and was very wild when we first put her in the
evening before, had got quite used to her surroundings, and had
learned how to hang on with her feet and beak, so that she was
not knocked about when being carried. It is marvellous how
quickly a kea will adapt itself to circumstances. This particular
bird, after I had carried her on my back for five or six hours, got
so accustomed to the motion that she would call softly to herself,
or eat snowberries out of my hand as we went along. If the
climbing was rough, and the cage temporarily upside down, she
would brace herself with feet and beak, and quietly wait until she
was righted. So quiet indeed did she become, and so docile, that
we called her Angela.
On Sunday afternoon, having got all our goods and chattels
together--camera, gun, cages, tramps, tent, provisions, etc,,
--we started off up the Wilberforce on our eight miles
walk to the Jagged Spur Gully. We had put a partition in

Angela's cage, and another bird in, and I carried them, as the
day was sorching hot and the pack-horse would have jolted them
too much. O11 arrival at our destination, we climbed up the
hillside above our camp to set our traps.
WILD COUNTRY.
The Jagged Spur Gully is a deep-forked ravine, with steep
rocky sides. The western side of the main gully is quite in-
accessible, being almost sheer rock, with birch and totara grow-
ing in the crevices. The eastern side is covered with bush to a
height of about 500 feet, and is then broken rock all up to the
top. The side gully is bare, inaccessible rock, towering to the
ridge, 7,000 feet up. We chose a rocky promontory with a
stunted birch on the end of it for our traps, as it commanded a
fine view of the gully, and could be seen from camp. Here we
set our traps, and, it being already dusk, returned to camp for
the night. One of the call birds we kept in a wire-netting run
near the tent, and also in sight of the bird up by the traps. The
advantage of this was that, if our distant bird saw any others
early in the morning, and began calling, the bird at camp would
answer, and wake us up.
NOT TO BE CAUGHT.
At about half-past four next morning our ornithological
alarm went off, and I got up, and hurried up the mountain side.
When half-way up to the traps I heard a wild kea screaming
behind me, and looking round, saw him sailing over to me from
across the gully. Almost immediately two others further up
answered, and all three presently arrived at the traps. They
were a pair and an odd male bird, and I sat quietly among the
tussock a few yards away, waiting for them to rush joyfully into
the traps after the meat. But not a bit of it ! After thoroughly
inspecting Angela and her cage, and bestowing a casual glance
at the traps they came over and subjected me to a searching
scrutiny. Finding I was an object of interest to them, I moved
nearer to the traps, and tried in vain to call their attention to the
dainty viands displayed therein. It was no use. If I sat
quite still they went over&amp;apos;and had a chat with Angela, sitting on
the roof of her cage the while; if I moved they hopped

Mr. Edgar F. Stead,
blithely around me, learning everything they could about me
and my ways. The place they didn't hop 011 was the space
covered by the traps. As they came, quite fearlessly, to within
a few feet of me, I decided to try to snare them, so I went into a
little clump of bush near by to get a rod and a piece of fine
creeper for a noose. The keas accompanied me, hopping
round in the trees above my head whiie I cut the stick and pre-
pared my snare. Having got everything ready, I returned to the
promontory, and squatted quietly down under a big boulder.
Almost instantly a head appeared over the edge above me, and
the owner of it gave a quiet little call. Another head appeared,
and another, and then, within three feet of me, the birds sat and
watched me, a whole world of curiosity in their bright little eyes.
Gently I raised the snare and brought it towards the middle one.
He took no notice until it was almost over his head, and then he
quietly took it in his beak and began chewing it. Realising
that I could not snare th&amp;apos;em, I went half-way down the hill and
called to H. to bring up a coil of wire netting that we had. This
we used to make a little run, at the entrance of which we placed
Angela in her cage, hoping that we could drive the wild birds
into it, but half an hour's vain endeavour convinced us of the
futility of this scheme. Then I decided that I would return to
camp for a camera, so that I could photograph the birds, even
though unable to trap them. I descended via a single slide, and
the noise of the stones rattling down with me attracted the birds,
which accompanied me down to camp, and when I got back with
the camera, only one had returned. The sun had by this time
risen over the mountain behind us, and the day was bright and
hot. Everything was propitious for good pictures, but before I
had the camera ready the bird flew, screaming up the gully.
Very disappointed and hot we returned to camp.
That evening at four o'clock we again climbed to the
traps. Shortly after our arrival we saw a bird, and I called it
down, when it proved to be the unattached male of the morning,
readily distinguished by the state of his moult. We set a trap
out 011 a ledge of rock, evening up the surface with small stones.
The bird came down, and, taking the stones one by one, dropped
them over tire edge. Next, standing well outside the trap, he

began chewing one of the sticks, with the result that the cage
fell down. It was very laughable, but it scared the kea, and he
flew away, nor did we see him again.

Next morning, at five, I was again at the traps, and the pair of
birds returned. They hopped round as before, and presently,
taking no notice of me, they began billing and cooing on a rock,
very much after the style of tame pigeons. Then the female
flew on to the top of a dead totara stump, and the male settled
just below her, and held up his head while she scratched it with
her bill. If she stopped, he bit her foot, whereupon she would
go on again. At last the male bird, quite unable to resist the
temptation of a large piece of bread with some raspberry stains
on it, went into the trap. While I w T as taking him out, his mate
sat on top of a neighbouring birch tree, and screamed with
extraordinary vehemence. Within ten minutes she also went
into the trap. I rushed up and grabbed her, though in the light
of after events, it appeared to be quite a needless proceeding, as
she did all the grabbing that was necessary--she worked over-
time on the job, too, it seemed to me.
Later 011 H. came up, and we decided to shift our traps to
a point further up the gully, so we returned to camp, had a
breakfast and lunch in one, and started off up the creek. We
found that the point we wished to reach was quite inaccessible so
we went on climbing, until, at 8 p.111., we got on to a ridge several
thousand feet above our camp, having caught a young male kea
on the way up. We reached camp at about a quarter to ten, and,
too tired to cook any food, ate bread and sugar, and turned in,
only to turn out again in order to prop and stay our tent up in a
howling nor'-west gale until four next morning. That day, the
musterers came in, and we returned with them to Glenthorn.
Two days later we came back to Lake Coleridge, and there turned
our birds out into a cage with four birds they have there. The
row those birds made all night attracted two wild ones down, and
I shot them in the morning. That evening I decided to go on a
mountain, about three miles from the house, and try for some
birds there. Mr. D. Murchison went with me, and almost imme-
diately on our arrival caught two birds, an old and particularly

vicious male, and a young female. As it was coming up a misty
sou'-wester--good for birds--we decided to stay out all night,
and set about cutting some manuka and tussock for a bed, which
we placed alongside a big rock.
A KEA's NEST.
Before dawn I was wakened by more calling, and went up
to our traps. A bird came over and began calling, but would not
come near the traps, staying down by the male bird we had
caught the night before. I went back and saw her, with tail
spread and wings drooping, run to the edge of a bluff and fly off
into the ravine without a sound. I guessed immediately that she
had a nest, and as soon as there was enough light we started
looking for it. When we were just giving up hope of finding it,
and were going to turn the male bird loose and follow him, we
heard the female call away down in the bottom of a big rock slip,
and I caught a glimpse of her as she moved. Hurrying to the
spot, we found a lot of loose feathers and droppings, which in-
dicated the presence of a nest. We soon located it, in a long
hole, the entrance of which was formed by two enormous
boulders, which leaned against one another, forming a triangular
space, partly blocked by a third stone. This latter we removed
by using a thick vine as a rope, and after much scratching and
scraping I reached in, and striking a match, saw the bird on her
nest. More scraping and digging among the small stones and
earth, and then I reached in, but quickly withdrew my hand,
minus a small piece of the middle finger. I then wrapped a
handkerchief round my hand, and very soon had the bird out. I
handed her to Mr. Murchison to hold, and she immediately took
a piece out of his coat and clawed him pretty thoroughly, but my
attention was on the nest, and, to my joy, I found four pure white
eggs. They were laid on the ground among a few chips of
rotten wood and bark, about five feet from the entrance of the
hole.
More than satisfied with our night's work, we returned to
the Take, and that afternoon H. and myself, with many thanks
for the hospitality and assistance we had received, left for home.

NOTES ON MY VISIT TO AUSTRALIA.
By David Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Some time ago Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, the Secretary of the
Zoological Society of London, conceived the idea of holding a

<bodyText confidence="0.986639117647059" page_id="32669265"  page_num="Page 287" year="" vol="">
series of special exhibitions of the fauna of the different portions
of the British Empire at the Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park,
and the suggestion received the hearty approval and support of
the Council. It was decided that the first of these exhibitions
should represent the fauna of Australasia, and arrangements
were made to exchange collections with the various Zoological
Societies of the antipodes, and the Governments of New South
Wales and New Zealand promised their assistance by donations
of animals.
The present writer sailed for Australia by the Orient-
Royal Mail Steamer " Orotava," which left London on December
13th last, on behalf of the Zoological Society, to make all arrange-
ments for the collection and transmission home of animals which
were to form the Australasian exhibition, and it has been sug-
gested to me that a short account of my trip, with especial
reference to the birds I came across, would be of interest to some
of our members.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
On January 16th, 1908, we sighted the coast of Western
Australia, and at 4.30 p.m. docked in Fremantle Harbour. Mr.
E. A. Le Souef, the Director of the Zoological Gardens at Perth,
and his brother Mr. L. Le Souef met me 011 arrival, and sug-
gested that I should drive with them at once to Perth, a distance
often miles, and see the Zoo before darkness fell, and I had to
return to the ship to proceed towards the Eastern States.
The drive was to me of the greatest interest; gum trees of
various shapes and sizes grew everywhere, and Wattle bushes,
many of them in flower were scattered along the roadside. The
Christmas Tree ( Mytsia floiibunda) covered with masses of bril-
liant orange flowers appeared now and again, but the time of
flowers was considered to be past. Birds were scarce save for
a few Magpies (Piping Crows) and dull coloured Honey-eaters
of species we could not determine.
During our drive my companions endeavoured to impress

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
upon me the desirability of my staying for a week or two in
Western Australia, where the fauna is of great interest, and
several species survive which have long since disappeared in the
older and more thickly populated States in the Eastern portion
of the Commonwealth. A most kind invitation to stay from the
Premier also reached me, and as I knew I should have no chance
of staying on my way homeward I decided to return to the ship
and make arrangements to proceed eastwards by the boat follow-
ing a fortnight later. By this time we had reached the Zoo,
which occupies a charming situation at South Perth, overlooking
the beautiful Swan River. There was no time however to see much
of the Zoo that evening, but Mr. Ee Souef had a pair of delightful
little ponies put into a trap and hurriedly drove me round.
The Zoo was started in 1898, the idea originating with Dr.
Hackitt of Perth, who invited the late Mr. Le Souef of Melbourne
to come over and choose the site. It is formed on a bed of some
two hundred feet of whitfe sand, so the difficulties that the present
Director had to encounter can well be imagined. Fifteen acres
w 7 ere at first granted, and this has gradually been increased until
at present the area is about forty-seven acres. However this is
not all devoted to the animals, for with a small population the
only way to make the undertaking pay its way is to devote a
considerable amount of space, some five acres, to sports, especially
tennis and cricket. The houses for the animals are mostly of a
very light description which, in fact, is all that is needed in so-
warm a climate.
Carnivora and almost all of the monkeys succeed admir-
ably and breed freely, but animals which naturally inhabit moist
districts, such as Swamp Deer and such like do not do well in
the dry climate of Western Australia.
There is one large octagonal aviary with open wire netting
all round, which is devoted to Parralceets and Doves. Here I
noticed Stanleys, Kings, Rock Pebblers, Cockatiels, Rosellas,
Many-colours, Redrumps and Bronze-wing Pigeons. Another
aviary of the same kind, but much smaller, contained a collec-
tion of African Weavers of the commoner kinds. A small
enclosure containing a pond with an island in the centre, was
occupied by a pair of blue Porphyrios with several fluffy black

chicks. These birds breed freely here every year. A series of
small aviary compartments contained Piping Crows, Winking,
Boobook and Australian Barn Owls ; Brown Hawks, and a
splendid pair of Bnff-breasted Laughing Kingfishers (. Dacelo
cervina), but perhaps the gems of the collection were six fine
Banlcsian Black Cockatoos which occupied a small aviary to
themselves. These birds lived almost entirely 011 Brazil Nuts,
appearing to care little or nothing for any other food, but four of
them which Mr. Fe Souef allowed me to bring home have now
taken to a much more general diet. Ostriches do well here and
have, I believe, bred, but I do not appear to have made any note
on this point. Turkeys are allowed to wander loose about the
Gardens, where they pick up insects and the crumbs left by
visitors, pradtically keeping themselves, and thriving well in the
dry climate.
Pheasants, especially the j^oung ones, do not seem to
thrive here, probably owing to the scarcity of small insect life in
so dry a climate. Various Waterfowl are kept, and do well, the
most interesting species I noticed being Eyton's Tree Ducks, of
which there were several specimens.
Australian Finches are practically unrepresented in the
collection, and so far no attempt has been made to keep the
various Honey-eaters and other insectivorous indigenous birds.
Some years ago the Director liberated a number of Indian
Doves-- Turtur cambaiensis and T. suratensis, and these have
thriven and are now abundant throughout the district. Piping
Crows with cut wings are allowed to roam the Gardens, one albino
specimen being a great favourite, and wild examples are often
seen walking about the grounds with the captives. I must not
forget to mention a pair of the fine Australian Bustards, known
to the Colonists as "Wild Turkeys," which were allowed the
free run of the Zoo.
Of purely wild birds I saw very few, the most common
being the charming Black and White Fantail Flycatcher
(.Rhipidicra tricolor ), known there, as in other parts of Australia
as the " Willie Wagtail " or " Shepherd's Companion." It is
delightfully tame, and is generally seen on the ground searching
for insects, all the time gently wagging its tail from side to side.

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
Now and then a small party of White-eyes would appear,
busily searching for small insects amongst the foliage and flowers.
This Western form is the Green-backed species {Zosterops gouldi),
which, at the time of my visit was not nearly so numerous as I
found the Grey-backed form, Z. caerulescens , in the Eastern
States. The pretty Yellow-rumped Tit (.Acantliiza chrysorrhoa)
was also fairly common.
We started to drive back to Fremantle at eight o'clock ; the
horses we had used on the outward journey being unavailable we
had to be content with a couple of noted "jibbers" which how-
ever took us allright to the ship. Here it took me some time to
make arrangements to break my journey here and to pack up my
belongings, and it was about eleven o'clock when we left the
second time for Perth.
All went well for the first part of the journey where the
road was good, but presently the horses began to show signs of
fatigue and we suddenly remembered that before us the road was
uncommonly bad, having been pounded up into masses of loose
chalk and sand by the heavy traffic occasioned by the building of
a bridge. My companion knew that if once this pair of jibbing
horses were to stop, it would be extremely difficult to persuade
them to start again, and so it proved. As we approached the loose
track the horses were whipped up to a canter, but as the wheels
sank in the loose surface both steeds suddenly stopped dead, and
nothing that we could do by whipping and pulling would persuade
them to move forward one single step. Some navvies engaged
on the new bridge came from their shanties to help us, and after
some three-cpiarters-of-an-hour had been spent in pulling both
horses and buggy along we got on to a better piece of road and
the horses condescended to pull, but, as one of our navvy friends
observed, by far the worst part of the road was }^et to come, and
we saw visions of a night spent in the bush. The horses travelled
well enough on the hard surface, but we soon approached a stiff
incline where the surface was if anything worse than at the first
place. We rushed full tilt into this and, as before, our steeds
pulled up at once and commenced to plunge and kick while the
traces hung slack and nothing that we could do would make them
try in the least degree to pull. The only thing to be done was

for Mr. Le Sonef to ride one of our steeds back to Perth, a
distance of some four or five miles, for assistance in the shape of
other horses which were not jibbers. This he proceeded to do
while I lit my pipe and prepared to make myself comfortable on
the buggy. The time was now about 2 a.111., the night delight-
fully warm, but the mosquitoes somewhat unpleasantly in
evidence. Presently the "swish swish" of wings sounded clear-
ly overhead as a large flight of ducks passed over. In the
distance a Boobook Owl was uttering its note which has been
likened to the words " More Pork" or " Mopolce," and a second
specimen soon commenced to answer it. This note was long
supposed to be uttered by the Frogmouth ( Poda?~gus ), hence the
latter bird is even now frequently termed the " Mopoke," whereas
its note is really entirely different.
After waiting for about half-an-hour the sound of a gallop-
ing horse greeted my ears and I presently made out the form of
Mr. Le Souef coming towards me. " Well, how have you got
on ? " I said. " Tried to take a short cut home and got bushed,
and have only just found the road again," was his reply. "Let's
have another try with these two horses," he added. We harnessed
in again and my companion got a rope on to their heads while I
took the reins and whip, and with all our might we endeavoured
to make those horses pull. But, not a bit of it, nothing would
induce them to strain a muscle in the right direction. They were
jibbers of the worse type, plunging and kicking for all they were
worth, until finally they smashed the pole of the buggy and we
were left in a worse predicament than ever.
There was nothing for it but for my friend to make a
second attempt to ride home for assistance, and this time he
wisely kept to the road. Meanwhile I settled mj^self down for
another lonely hour, while the Boobooks kept me awake with
their oft-repeated call of "mo-poke, mo-poke."
At four a.m. my friend arrived, followed shortly by one of
his men in a " sulky," who had been roused from his slumbers
with the greatest difficulty. My baggage was soon transferred
from the broken buggy, which we left by the road side to be
fetched later, and we reached my friend's house in the Perth Zoo
just as daylight was breaking.

GARDENS.
The most wonderful collection of living Birds of Paradise
that has ever been got together is now on view at the London
Zoological Gardens, no less than ten species being represented.
The Greater (. Paradisea apoda&amp;apos;). Lesser (P. minor&amp;apos;). Red (P. rubra),
Twelve-wired ( Seleucides alba) and King-birds of Paradise ( Cicin -
nurus regius) have been some time in the Gardens, and on June
30th a new collection from New Guinea arrived, containing five
other species, four of which are now exhibited for the first time.
Mr. C. B. Horsbrugli sailed for New Guinea in December
last, on behalf of the Zoological Society and Sir William Ingram,
his object being to obtain living Birds of Paradise. Considering
the great difficulties inseparable from such an undertaking Mr.
Horsbrugli deserves the hearty congratulation of aviculturists on
the success of his expedition, he has safely brought home the
following birds :--Several specimens of Count Raggi's Birds of
Paradise ( Paradisea raggiana), one of the finest of the genus to
which it belongs, being not unlike the Great Bird (/*. apoda) but
with red plumes instead of yellow ; eight examples of the Mag-
nificent Bird of Paradise (. Diphyllodes speciosa), one of the most
extravagantly decorated of birds; one New Guinea Rifle-bird
(Ptilorhis magnificat) perhaps the most beautiful of any, of a
velvety black colour with metallic reflections and a pectoral
shield of brilliant shining green. The Six-plumed Bird of
Paradise ( Paiotia sexpennis) is represented by seven specimens,
all in good condition, but none at present showing the character-
istic plumes, three of which grow from each side of the head.
There are also some four or five Mauucodes ( Maiiucodia chalybeia ),

two Gardener Bower Birds ( Amblyornis subalaris), three New
Guinea Cat-Birds (. Aelurcedus melanocephalus), one Red-breasted

majority of these birds are imported for the first time.

I was much interested by Mr. Galloway's article on " The
Weather and our Summer Birds." The part which specially took
my attention is his pronouncement in favour of captivity v.
freedom.
Mr. Hudson, if I recollect right, thinks captivity the
greatest misery a bird can endure. How birds regard it is,
like the question of food and temperature, one we have by 110
means found the answer to yet. My experience is almost entirely
confined to parrots.
As a rule you may always despair of getting back the
long-tailed parrots which escape--excepting Macaws--and you
may always hope to recover the short-tailed ones ; and the parrot
that does come back, as a rule, does not much appreciate liberty.
Their great desire to come back into the house, and the mischief
they may do, when they do get in, is one of the drawbacks to
letting them out. But the question of returning is not entirely
decided by their having or not having lost their fear of man. I
knew a Bengal Parrakeet so devoted to his owner that he felt he
might safely take it out of doors on his shoulder. It flew to the
top of a high tree, and nothing would persuade it to return that
day, and by the next morning it was gone never to be recovered.
But only let me find the short-tailed bird that has flown away,
and even if not very tame, he will probably come back to his
cage.
Macaws form the exception to the long-tails not coming
back, and Cockatoos form the exception to the short-tails coming
back, but I think more because they are so very strong on the
wing that they fly too far afield in the first instance. I knew a
Bullfinch, which was caught wild, and got away, and returned of
its own accord. But I have reared linnets by hand, and had them
tame enough at first to return to my whistle, but they very soon
lost their tameness and went for food. When I first came to this
Vicarage, some 34 years ago, I bought a Blackbird. All went
well, till I also bought a Magpie. It may have been coincidence,
but the Blackbird moped and seemed going to die, so I opened
its cage and gave it its liberty, Next day it returned of its own

accord to its cage, quite restored and lived happily for some time
after.
I am left to the conclusion that a bird's preference for
liberty or food is very much a matter of individual taste, and
that it is impossible to say all birds prefer comfortable captivity.

(PI a tycei cus icterotis).
Sir, --In the beginning of June, after one of my hen Stanlej's had
been for some time in a log nest, I distinctly heard the cry of a young bird
when the mother returned from a forage at seed pan, grass seeds, apple,
etc. After a fortnight I looked in the nest box, and saw that there was one
nice young one beginning to feather, and one addled egg.
On the 6tli of July the young bird was all but ready to leave the nest,
and anticipating this with tremblings as to whether it would dash against
the wire meshing, or something of the kind equally prolific of disaster, I
took him out and put him in a cage, through the rather wide bars of which
the mother fed him.
Isay "him," because the bird has a bright patch of red above the
nostrils, and is decidedly reddish on the lower parts. A fine young bird.
The male Parrakeet never paid the slightest attention to his mate;
never fed her when she left the nest to hurriedly obtain what she could in
a limited time ; never seemed to recognize his one and only child as any-
thing to do with him.
But now his son and heir has come of age, he appears to be more
sociable with his wife.
Being youngish birds, it is probable that the first clutch of eggs
would be a small one. I hope that next time there will be more.
Hubert D. Asteey.
Sir, --You will be interested to know I have some young Stanley
Parrakeets just about to leave the nest.
Have Stanleys been bred in England previously ?
I have some interesting hybrids, also between cock King Parrakeet
and hen Barraband Parrakeet, ready to leave the nest.

I should he obliged if you would be so kind to have corrected. I have
compared the printed copy with the type-written one I sent in, and can
find no reason why the printer should have made the following alterations r
P. 193. 4th. line from bottom, for "application" read " appelation."
P. 195. iStli. line from top, for "Trincule" read "Trincnlo."
P. 196. 9th. line from top, for "latest" read "later."
P. 196. 12th. line from top, "Umbre" should not be in italics.
P. 196. Sth line from bottom, for "403" read "401"
P. 197. 11 tli. line from top, the word "latter" has been omitted
from before " locality."
P. 197. Bottom line, for "tarsus 10 to 12J," read "tarsus 10 to io|."
I would also venture to remark that on nearly every page I find my
punctuation has been altered, at any rate in one case altering the sense of
a paragraph.
I am very sorry to make any criticisms on such an excellent and
useful journal as the Avicultural Magazme but accuracy is essential to its
usefulness. S. S. Fi.owER.

CAGE BIRDS AND PANICS AT NIGHT.
Sir, -- I am much interested in a reply from one of your correspondents
in the July Number of the Avicultural- Magazine to the query headed
" Bullfinch losing feathers," and would be glad to give my experience and
suggestions as to the cause of "Panic" which cage birds seem subject to
at night. I have three Canaries, one Bullfinch, one foreign finch and three
Linnets in a large aviary cage which I keep in the greenhouse during the
dai&amp;apos;and on a table in a spare room at night. On four different occasions
I have found on uncovering the cage in the morning that one of the
Linnets was seriously mutilated, the flight feathers literally cut clean off
leaving only the stumps, and the end of the wings grazed and bleeding. I
naturally thought this was due to mice, as these have often been a trouble
in other ways. I then had the cage suspended from the middle of the
ceiling in another room. The same thing occurred again, and I was in
despair. Then I left the door open to enable me to hear them and keep
watch. Between three and four o'clock in the morning the fluttering began
again. I quickly turned on the electric light and quieted the birds by
calling them by name. All were silent at once, and I then felt sure that
"mice" were not the culprits. On mentioning this to a friend who is a
lover of birds and really understands them, he tells me these sudden panics-
are sometimes due to "Moonlight," and also to their hearing the call-note
of a migrant bird during the early hours of the morning, and in their
anxiety to fly with them, their poor wings are cut and bruised against the
bars of the cage. This occurs especially in Spring and Autumn and I find
it is so. I see in Mr. Farmborough's article in the July number on

" British Rails," he gives an instance of the same thing, and calls it
"Migratory Fever." I consider this the solution.
The Linnet I have, rebels against captivity more than any bird I

have kept, and I have decided to give her her liberty. She is always the
sufferer, and has been cruelly injured each time. Last week I heard the
flutter of wings at 3.20 a.m. and very suddenh - . At the same time a
Blackbird was giving his early call-note in my garden. I feel sure the
Linnet heard it and hence the panic. I noticed that two of the Canaries
were sound asleep while the fluttering continued, and my voice soon
pacified the restless ones.
It would be interesting to know if other members of our Society
have had the same unpleasant experience and I should be grateful for any
further light on the subject. (Miss) Georgina Woi.EE.
THE USE OF GENTLES AS FOOD FOR BIRDS.
In the June number of our Magazine, Mr. St. Quinton asks members
to give their experience as to the use of gentles for feeding insectivorous
birds. My experience with these has been perfectly satisfactory, and I
have never known a case in which harm has resulted from their use. But
it is absolutely essential that they should be thoroughly cleaned before
use, by being kept for at least three days in clean dry sand. When properly
cleansed, I believe them to be perfectly wholesome and more digestible
than mealworms. Some birds will not touch them, but most eat them
readily and do well on them.
When I was in Melbourne, I went to see the most interesting collection
of insectivorous birds kept by Miss Helen Bowie, one of the few a viculturists
in Australia and probably the most experienced as regards soft-bills.
She employs a boy to collect the small gentles of the house-fly which
propagate in liorse-mauure. These are much smaller than the ordinary
larva of the blow-fly and seem admirably suited as food for very delicate
insectivorous birds. Miss Bowie has kept for a long time with perfect
success such birds as Blue Wrens, Yellow-breasted Robins and such like.

Turacus corythaix.
By Hubert D. Astley, M.A.
I commenced in 1907 with four specimens of these beauti-
ful birds, and all of them wintered successfully out of doors,
with a warm roosting house to go into, but the windows of it
were always open, by night as well as by day.
I11 the early Spring one Turaco was found dead, in splen-
did plumage and condition. From a bruise on its forehead, it
looked as if it had flown against the wire.
Not long after two of the Turacos began to bully the
remaining third, a fact of which I was unaware until it was too
late, and the poor thing succumbed to it's injuries. It had been
chased constantly, and not allowed to eat, and at length it
became paralysed. This persecution was entirely because the two
that are left are a male and female ; who had evidently made up
their minds that they must have the place to themselves, as far as
their own species was concerned. They never offered to touch or
molest any of the other birds, such as Stanley and Black-tailed
Parrakeets, Palm Doves, Red Cardinal, etc.
Then in June began much ' Touracooing,' by which I
mean much frog-like croaking on the part of the male, whose
voice could be heard quite half a mile away. When strawberries
were thrown in he would call to his mate to come down, and he
then picked a berry up and placed it before her, or else she
would take it from his beak. I placed a large hamper lid amongst
some branches in a secluded corner of the aviary, in the inner
part of the roosting house, and both birds carried up a quantity
of sticks. It was not until about the 15th of July that the heir

29S Nesting of the White-Crested Turaco.
Turaco kept to her nest, whilst the male generally sat on a
branch close by, I believe she came off in the morning and the
evening. Several times I saw him feed her when she was off for
a few minutes in the evening. They are a very devoted couple,
but inexperienced.
On the 12th of August, seeing that both birds were sitting
on the branches outside the nest, I took the opportunity of
introducing my light-weight aviary ladder, a telescopic one, to
have a peep. There is a moment of exciting suspense as one
mounts the ladder to a nest which is placed about twelve feet
from the ground. I did peep, and saw to my great disappoint-
ment, a poor little dark brown body about the size of a Bantam
chick, but only a body. The spirit had flown ! It might have
waited a little bit, and then it could have taken the body with it.
I packed it off quickly for more scientific eyes than mine to
examine it ; but I noticed that the toes were inclined to be like
the majority of other birds, that is : three in front and one at the
back ; whereas the adult Turaco has semi-zygodactylous feet--
with reversible outer toe, like the Cuckoos, two either way. It is
very difficult to write so that one can satisfy our Museum friends
and not fluster our other friends who wonder whether a Turaco
with a semi-zygodactylous foot is a bird at all, or only some
creepy-crawly ! Ret me comfort them by saying that when I wrote
that mouthful (I am not going to write it again !) I glued my eyes
to a reference book, held my breath, and ran my pen along the
paper for dear life! Even the name Turaco is misleading, for
when I possessed four, I told a young member of my family&amp;apos;- that
he must go and look at them. He did so, and announced at
luncheon that he was quite certain I had said there were two
Racoos, and he had seen four !
I feed my birds on boiled rice, potato and carrot, with
strawberries, cherries, grapes, banana and sometimes melon.
The parents are in such splendid condition that I supposed this
varied '11161111' would be suitable for the young one.
I saw 110 trace of any egg-shell, and I had hoped to find
two young birds, for I believe two eggs are laid in the wild state.
Certainly one has very constantly to murmur " Pazienza " along
with the Italians.

By E. J. Brook.
A pair of White Eyebrowed Wood-Swallows (Artamus
superciliosus) have reared one young one that is now flying in
the aviary. Am I right in supposing that this is the first
instance of a Wood-Swallow being reared in captivity?
When I saw that this pair of birds had mated, I found a
bit of a tree root with a rotten cup-shaped hollow in it. I wired
this lump of wood 011 to one of the joists of the roof inside the
aviary, and close up to the boards of the ceiling.
The pair soon took to this nesting-place and carried in a
few very small bits of stick but made no regular nest. The first
egg laid proved clear ; after this one was removed another was
laid three days later but was broken, four days after that another
was laid and successfully incubated.
Both parent birds sat, relieving each other at short in-
tervals. The egg hatched on the 14th day I think, and the young
bird left the nest fourteen days later. Both parent birds fed
the young one, but the cock was the best feeder, and much the
keenest to find tit bits such as small flies, etc. Only live insects
were given to the young bird until it left the nest, but since then
the cock has given it occasional morsels of the ordinary insec-
tivorous mixture.
While the young bird was in the nest the old birds kept
the nest clean by removing the excreta in their beaks as Starlings
do.
The young Wood-Swallow was practically reared on meal-
worms as other insects have been very difficult to get, there
being very few caterpillars in the garden this year, and the old
Birds would not look at woodlice, cockroaches, etc. A dead
rabbit proved very useful to attract flies, and it was a pretty sight
.to see the old birds catching them.
The young Wood-Swallow is a dull dirty grey in colour,
the breast being much lighter than the back, and the whole is
striped and mottled with dirty yellow. The beak is very short
and horn coloured, and this is the colouring of the legs.

In the early part of 1907 I obtained (through Mr. Thorpe,
of Hull) a pair of these Chilian birds and placed them in an
aviary consisting of a roomy shelter shed facing South, with
glass verandah in front, the rest of the run (about 30 square yds.)
consisting of rough grass with plenty of large tufts, some of
which also extended underneath the verandah. I fed the birds at
first on mealworms in addition to small seeds, but subsequently
found that to give the former--or indeed any insect food--was
quite unnecessary, as the birds kept in perfect health on the
small seeds alone, though of course they picked a good deal of
green food for themselves.
These Tinamous are very nervous birds and spend a good
deal of time by day hiding under grass tufts. They make small
hollows to lie in, and the danger of inadvertently treading on the
birds is very great. The flight is very rapid and I had to cut
some wing feathers to prevent the birds dashing themselves
against the top of the aviary when suddenly surprised. Except
when surprised or frightened they do not often take to their wings.
They seem to feed chiefly about dusk. They are very silent birds,
though occasionally, when alarmed, uttering a small piping cry.
They can run rapidly, but naturally move a few steps at a time
and look round with a quick nervous movement. I was doubtful
whether they would stand an English winter without artificial
heat, but determined to try. Accordingly I wired off a good
portion of the outside run and put fir branches, dry grass, and
bracken in the shed so as to induce the birds to seek cover inside.
This was only a partial success, as in the worst weather last
winter I often found them under grass tufts outside the shed.
The cock Partridge Tinamou is said to be smaller than the
hen, and as I had no prospect of getting any more birds I vainly
tried to persuade myself that my birds differed in size, but had to
admit in the end that there was no recognizable difference, and
with this all my friends agreed. However, in June 190S, signs of
pairing were apparent, and on the iSth June under a large tuft of

grass the nest containing five eggs was found. The nest con-
sisted merely of a hollow lined with dry grass. The eggs were
dark chocolate in colour and looked very highly glazed. I never
saw eggs with a more artificial look. They were one and five
eighths inches in length. The cock Tinamou was sitting closely
when found and was noticed to leave the nest for a few moments
on the 20th and 22nd. If disturbed from the nest he would soon
come back to see that all was well after the intruder had gone
awa}^. Between the 18th and 28th June the hen bird kept near
the nest. On the latter date the cock grew restless and the
following morning the hen was accordingly removed. I am sorry
I cannot say definitely the period of incubation. My aviary
keeper tells me the bird was not sitting on the 14th, but he might
possibly be mistaken if he saw the cock bird off the nest on that
day.
On the morning of 5th July the cock Tinamou was found
squatting some distance from the nest and two chicks rushed
through the inch-mesh wire netting of the run into a neighbour-
ing hedge. These were duly secured, as also a third. A fourth
found its way to the Californian Quails and the cock quail
(according to his custom) promptly killed the chick. The fifth
egg was afterwards found to contain a half developed chick,
though how or why this came about, I don't in the least
understand.
The three rescued chicks were put with the old bird into
the shed but one died two days later. The old bird brooded the
others closely for the first few days, after which they began to
move about on their own account, generally taking shelter
in a tuft of grass near the parent bird. For the first ten days of
their existence the chicks lived mainly on cleaned gentles, but
took a little yolk of egg and fresh ants' eggs in addition.
During the first week of their lives they were curious rough
looking little creatures of a mottled brown colour, almost im-
possible to see when squatting at even a yard distant. At the
end of that time they began strikingly to resemble the parent bird,
the head in particular being a perfect resemblance in miniature,
except the eye which was blue. The movements of the chicks
also curiously resembled the movements of the old bird--the same

quick sudden runs ending in sudden stops under tufts of grass,
and the same anxious jerkings of the head. I have never seen
any young birds of this age such an exact replica of the parent.
The chicks were very difficult to feed after the first week as,
apart from the difficulty of finding them, one could never be
sure that they would not rush off to hide and fail to find the
food. On the 19th July the chicks were seen to eat millet and
canary seed for the first, time, and a day or two afterwards were
allowed a considerable portion of the outside grass run--a change
which they greatly appreciated, and afterwards remained entirely
in the open.
There is really very little else worthy of being recorded
concerning these chicks. By the end of July they had got the
full plumage of the parent bird, the only noticeable difference
being that the chicks were a little darker on the back. They
had by this time attained a considerable size and were well able
to look after themselves. They never seemed to care for lettuce
when offered them, and though veiy fond of most kinds of insects,
would not look at blackbeetles. By the 5th August their eyes
had changed colour and resembled those of the old bird, but a
little lighter. I perhaps ought to mention that these birds have
been reared on a dry gravel soil, this I should judge important.

It was in April 1906 that I received the little party of four
Brown-throated Conures from a fellow member of the Avicultural
Society. One has since died, but three so far flourish. The
pair are together, the odd bird being in another compartment
of the garden aviary.
I was away from home when the news reached me that on
the 20th June (1908) the voice of a baby Conure had again been
heard issuing from the nesting-box. I was not very excited, but
hope deferred maketli the heart sick, or at any rate despondent.
I heard of the infant's arrival with the remark " Oh ! I wonder

so many attempts and always forsake the babies when a few days

sitting in a nice tidy run with their proud parents. The first
came out of the nest on July 24th ; the second a week later, on
the 31st; the third 011 the 4th August.
The parents were kept well supplied with soaked bread
squeezed dry and soaked Canary seed ; they also had green stuff
and fruit.
The babies were nearly as big as their parents when they
came out and could fly well, though they do not fly about much,
being content to sit very solemnly on their perches. The eye is
surrounded by a whitish ring and the head is much greener than
in the adult birds. They can feed themselves but much prefer
being fed.

body was forwarded to the Editor. It was a fine, well-grown bird, and had
evidently been well able to look after itself for some time.]

as are their land relations, and when caught adult seem to take
to captivity fairly well. Like nearly all the long-billed birds
they are rather given to using their bills aggressively when
handled, and seem to especially select the face of their supposed
enemy as the target for their " dabs."
The first Water Rail that came into my possession could
hardly be called an aviary bird, or even a cage bird, as it was a
shot bird, injured in the wing, and used to go about the house
moving from room to room at will. This bird would permit
almost anyone to freely handle it without showing any sign of
resentment, and did not in the least mind being picked up and
stroked. Nearly all birds--either wholly or partially of an in-
sectivorous nature--seem to become rapidly reconciled to con-
finement even when caught adult, and many will take food from

one's fingers within a few hours of being captured, especially if
the "tit bit" be a nice "wriggly" mealworm.
Like most of its genus, the Water Rail is not often seen by
the unobservant eye, even in places where it is known to be
plentiful. On Saturday, July iStli, I was going through Kent
in the early morning hours, visiting my family who were staying
at Deal, and I noticed as the train sped through the county that,
in nearly every field in the immediate proximity of water, there
were two or more Water Rails feeding; in one meadow I counted
seven rooting about with their beaks in search of food, within
twenty yards of the railway track along which the train was
passing; in fact, not only were Rails plentiful, but bird-life
generally was well represented.
Apropos of the feeding of Rails and with reference to the
soft foods on which the Crakes were fed, concerning which I
wrote last month, my friend Mr. Frank Finn, whose knowledge
of avian life, and especially the wading and natatory birds, is
encyclopaedic, tells me that he has noticed that the short-beaked
rails, like the Crake, are to a certain extent seed-eaters, and not
nearly so entirely insectivorous feeders as the long bills, like the
species now under consideration. This is a point I had not
noticed, and as there is plenty of undergrowth and herbage in
the aviary, it is quite likely^ that the Crakes have been taking
advantage of the seed pods and heads of the various grasses and
plants which were growing there without myself being any the
wiser.
All the Water Rails in the enclosure were caught when
adult birds and have never shown the slightest disposition to
nest. Two of them were caught one winter; the}'' had been
noticed day after day coming into the farm yard where the warm
chicken food was put out and sharing the contents of the dish
with the fowls. One day a carter was bringing a waggon and
team into the yard and he noticed two rails run off and hide
behind a pile of brushwood ; he left his team and found the two
birds crouched down trying to conceal themselves as they had
got into a cul-de-sac between the brushwood and one side of an
outbuilding. He said they made no attempt to fly away, and all
he had to do was to pick them up in his hands and take them

into the house. The}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were turned into the aviary the same day
and made themselves quite at home at once. They are very fond
of paddling along the shallows of the water and investigate every
floating leaf or moving object on the surface of the water, whether
animate or inanimate, being much more inquisitive in this respect
than the Land Ralls. It was very amusing on one occasion to
observe the excitement set up by the dropping into the water of
a large dor-bettle which had evidently struck the roof netting of
the aviary during its flight and fallen through ; all the water
birds at once went out to see what the curious black whirling
object was gyrating on the water, first one would pluck up
courage to attempt to seize one leg only to drop it almost at once,
then another would try only to repeat the same performance, the
end of it being that a heron who had been gravely watching the
antics from the shore, marched into the water, crushed the beetle
in its beak and sedately stepped back again as if to put a stop to
the unseemly behaviour of the other birds.
CRANES, ETC., AT WOBURN.
By the Duchess of Bedford.
The following notes regarding Cranes and other birds
which have nested at Woburn this summer may be of interest
to some of the readers of the Avicultural Magazine.
The Sams Cranes (jGrus coltares&amp;apos;) have a strong chick about
six weeks old.
A second pair nested early in the year and laid an egg,
which was buried in snow the following day. They nested again
later and sat the full time but the eggs were unfertile. With
praiseworthy persistency they have now made a third nest and
the hen is sitting.
The Common Crane sat for the full time on eggs which in
the end mysteriously disappeared, but they started a new nest at
once, and have now a half grown chick. A second pair sat for a
considerable time but were driven off by a Black-necked Swan.
The White-necked Cranes ( Anlhropoides leucach.en&amp;apos;) have
two thriving young ones, hatched early in June.

Cranes, etc., at Woburn.
The Australian Cranes ( Grus australasiana) also had two,
but they attacked one, which we have had to bring up by hand
and killed the other when half grown.
Amongst the Swans, the Trumpeter and Black-necked,
both have young. Bewick and Whooper Swans lay and sit every
year, but the eggs are always unfertile. The Whoopers, however,
having become bored with the unsatisfactory proceeding of
sitting on unfertile eggs, turned a Black Swan off her nest,
hatched and brought up the young, to whom they behave as
devoted parents.
The Cereopsis Geese have three young as large as them-
selves. Another pair had four young, but they nest very early
and bad weather settled the fate of the whole broods.
Snow and Blue Snow Geese breed here annually ; there is
also a brood of White-fronted Geese and also of Bernicle Geese.

Tut nix lepurana.
By Major B. R. Horsbrugh, A.S.C.
This little Hemipode is quite a common summer resident
in the Potchefstroom district, and I have found it all up the
Western Transvaal as far north as Mafeking.
When shooting Cape or Harlequin Quail it is often met
with, but as a rule it is mistaken for a Quail chick and is not
fired at.
It has a great partiality for mealie fields, and here it runs,
like a swift rat through the weeds, but I have rarely found it in
the grassy vleis in which the two species of Coturnix (delegorguei
and capensis ) lie.
O11 the wing it is really quite easily distinguished from a
true Quail: it looks much lighter and swerves very much more ;
it does not fly far, and after one flight it will rather suffer itself
to be caught by a spaniel than get up a second time. On rising
the true Quail gives a sharp cry of " Kree--kree--kree " but the
Button Quail is quite silent.
Sclater says of this bird "that it is widely distributed
throughout the whole of S. Africa, except perhaps in the western
half-of Cape Colony, Beyond our limits {i.e. S. of the Zambesi
River) it extends northwards to the Gold Coast and to North-
East Africa and Aden."
Like so many other S. African birds its time of migration
depends on the abundance of its food and on the severity of the
cold weather.
In February 1907 my brother bought four of these little
Quail from a Dutch boy in Pretoria and sent them to me ; they
turned out to be three hens and one cock, and in my large aviary
they lived a retired existence among some tall grass till the end
of the following September.
About that time I noticed that the cock and one of the
hens were very friendly and never far apart, so I moved them
into an aviary where there was more cover and which was only
inhabited by a pair of Cut-throat Larks or Cape Long-claws
(Man onyx capensis).
On the 3rd of October we noticed the pair of Button Quail

in a great state of excitement; a nest had been made in a thick
tuft of grass and the birds stood facing away from it, throwing
bits of dried grass over their heads in its direction ; the first egg
was already in the nest.
On Oct. 5th the second egg was laid, and in exactly twelve
days the two extraordinary little ones were hatched. I11 colour-
ing they reminded me of that peculiar caterpillar found on
hedges at home in spring, I think it is the Gold Tail Moth but
I am not quite sure.
The cock bird did the whole of the sitting, the hen never
-came near the nest but went restlessly up and down the aviary
"booming" for another mate, and for some weeks the whole
garden resounded with her curious ventriloquial note which
sounded like " Oooop." One chick was accidentally drowned
and the other was about half grown on October 27th.
I then went down to Cape Town and, to my great annoy-
ance, when I returned ten days later I could find no trace of the
young Turnix. The cock, however, had made a new nest close
to the site of the old one, and was sitting on four eggs, two of
which he hatched on November 19th, when he deserted the other
two. I opened these two eggs and found them to contain dead
young just ready to come out. The chicks after the first or
second day are most wonderfully active and move round the aviary
as fast as mice.
The cock bird I have is wonderfully tame and will allow
himself to be picked up without struggling, and always brought
his young up to my hand, out of which he took mealworms and
fed them. This simplified the rearing of these tiny things very
much, but in this species after the young are a week or ten days
old they are frequently fed and brooded by the female ; this I
have often seen her do, though if the youngster does not hurry
up and come for the mealworm she swallows it herself.
The two young referred to above turned out to be both
hens, and on December 17th their eyes had changed from black
to the pearl colour of the adult bird, which they completely
resembled in all respects.
In the following March (190S) I missed the cock Button

was so thick that I did not risk searching for him and perhaps
disturbing him. On March 24th I found him waiting at the
aviary door with a newly hatched chick under him, which he fed
on some huge mealworms. The next morning, when I went to
look at him, I found three chicks under him, so that he must
have gone back to the nest and hatched off these during the
night. On the 26th, to my great surprise, I found a fourth chick
with him ; he is the only male I have so that there can be 110
question of the young being hatched by different males. Three
of these chicks he has successfully brought up, and I now believe
I have two or three males.
Since starting this article I have been posted to Bloem-
fontein, O.R.C., for duty and have brought the Quail with me,
and I hope this summer to rear a few more if I have any luck.

The morning of the next day was spent in the Zoological
Gardens arranging various business matters in connection with
the object of my visit.
In the afternoon my host drove me round the town of
Perth. The Zoo is situated on the opposite bank of the river
to the town and is usually approached by means of a ferry which
runs every quarter of an hour, but by road the distance is con-
siderable. From the Zoo the road strikes eastward, then runs
along by the river for perhaps a mile, until a bridge of several
spans is reached, which crosses the wide shallow river.
Shortly after starting I was delighted to see my old friend
the Sacred Kingfisher (Halycon sancta&amp;apos;) perched upon a telegraph
wire by the road side. It reminded me of a delightful pair of
these birds I kept some years ago.* Where the road crosses the
river the latter is very shallow with numerous mud banks over-
grown with rushes. Waterfowl were numerous, and as they are
here strictly protected they are very tame. Quite close to the

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
bridge were large flocks of wild duck ( Anas superciliosa), Cor-
morants ( Phalacrocorax carbo and P. hypoleucus ) were numerous,
while here and there on the surface of the water the large body
of a Pelican {Pelecanus conspicillatus) could be seen. Black Swans,
from which the river takes its name, are still much in evidence,
several pinioned birds are kept here and these attract the wild
ones which are sometimes quite numerous. Silver Gulls (. Larus
novcB-hollandicB ) were very common up the river, and we noted two
or three specimens of the Caspian Tern ( Hydroprogne caspia ).
We drove through the King's Park which is of considerable
size and, for the most part left absolutely wild, and therefore, one
would imagine, particularly attractive to birds, but strangely
enough, with the exception of a few Piping Crows and one or
two stray examples of Zosterops gouldi and Acanthiza chrysorrhoa
we saw absolutely nothing, in fact the lack of bird-life in this
\0x25A0district was truly extraordinary and most disappointing.
At the entrance to the King's Park there is a celebrated
avenue of cultivated eucalyptus trees which, at the time of my
visit, were mostly flowering well, though I was informed that
they were not nearly so fine as they had been the year before.
&amp;apos;The flowers vary in shade from white to the most brilliant scarlet
and are extremely beautiful.
A TRIP TO THE GOLDFIEEDS.
I was told that the thing for every visitor to W. A. to do
was to pay a visit to the goldfields at Kalgoorlie, which is situated
some four hundred miles inland from Perth. I asked what there
was to be got there in the way of live animals and learned that
it was a barren dry land where no vegetation grew and where
animal life was therefore practically non-existant. This was
not encouraging, but another informant told me that he had
known of several living examples of the Alexandra Parrakeet
which had come from that neighbourhood. This seemed more
encouraging and I was anxious to go in search of the lovely
SpathopUrus, and at the same time to study the working of gold
mines. Mr. E. A. Le Souef was anxious to go too as, although
he had lived for years in W. A. he had never been inland to
" the fields," consequently we made arrangements to catch the
evening mail train the following day.

Kalgoorlie is situated about four hundred miles inland
from Perth. In 1894 some prospectors discovered gold there,
and the news was a signal for people to flock thither from almost
all parts of the world. The place was then nothing but a barren
desert with practically no rainfall, and the only water that could
be procured was obtained by condensation from some salt lakes
in the neighbourhood. Condensing plant was erected and the
water sold at #6 per thousand gallons. There was no proper
road, and the seekers after the precious metal had to travel
thither as best they could, and many never reached their des-
tination.
In the few years that have elapsed since those days most
wonderful changes have been made. Kalgoorlie is now a fine
city of 30,000 inhabitants, with good hotels, a splendid electric
tram service, a telephone system far superior to that in any
ordinary English town, a most elaborate race-course--the Aus-
tralian cannot exist without horse-racing--and an excellent train
service and water supply. Moreover the gold mines are worked
with the most modern and expensive plant procurable. The
water supply is worth especial mention. As I just remarked the
only fresh water to be had in the first years of Kalgoorlie's
existence was condensed, the average annual rainfall of the dis-
trict being less than six inches. Thanks to the energy of the late
Premier, Sir John Forrest, whose name will always be held in
high esteem in Western Australia, an elaborate water scheme was
inaugurated by which water is now pumped for a distance of
352 miles through a wrought iron pipe, eight pumping stations
being employed ; and thus an abundant supply of good water is
available in the town. But this is not aviculture !
We made enquiries as to what birds were to be seen in
captivity and discovered quite a number of bird-fanciers, but the
ubiquitous Canary seemed to be first favourite. Several people
also kept Budgerigars, but no one seemed to be able to breed
them. Cockatiels, some of which were excellent talkers, and
Yellow-Collared Parrakeets, called locally " Twenty-Eights,"
were also kept. We discovered one lovely specimen of the
Alexandra Parrakeet (which by the way is now in the Parrot-
house at the Zoo), and learned that some three years ago these

beautiful Parrakeets visited the district in some numbers, and
many were captured. Everybody seemed to know the bird quite
well, but unfortunately almost all those which had been caged
had died, probably through their owners knowing nothing of the
correct method of treating them.
Except for a few Swallows ( Hirundo neoxena ) and White-
Eyes ( Zosterops gouldi ) and an occasional Kestrel ( Cerchneis
cenchroides&amp;apos;) wild birds were conspicuous by their absence.
The following day was spent in inspecting the gold mines
and studying the process by which the gold is obtained, and in
the evening we boarded the train on our return to Perth.
On arrival at the Perth Zoo the following morning we
were met by Mr. L- Le Souef, who suggested that we should
spend the night at Monger's lake, a broad expanse of water to
the north of Perth, which is frequented by waterfowl innumer-
able, and that with the aid of long nets, we should endeavour to
capture living specimens. The idea pleased me immensely, and
in the late afternoon Mr. E. Ee Souef and I proceeded to the
lake ; laying in, on our way, a stock of provisions for our supper.
O11 arrival at the water's edge I was charmed with the
notes of the Long-billed Reed Warbler (Acrocepkalus longirostris&amp;apos;),
one of the most beautiful songsters in Australia, many of its
notes much resembling those of our Nightingale. Its song was
continued from time to time during the greater part of the night.
We rowed to the further end of the lake where there are exten-
sive reed-beds, 011 our way putting up numbers of Mountain
Duck," as the Australian Sheldrake ( Cascara tadornoides ) is there
termed, and several other species. The beautiful " Blue Bald
Coot" ( Porphyrio Bellas) was common along the lake side, and
numbers of Cormorants fished in the lake. Solitary specimens of
the Musk Duck ( Biziura lobata) were frequently seen. They are
great divers, rarely if ever flying.
On approaching the reeds we put up numbers of duck of
several species. Mountain Duck, Black Duck and White-eyes or
Hardheads ( Nyroca australis ) being conspicuous, as well as any
number of Shags. Dabchicks ( Podiceps novoe-hollandies) were
numerous, and the reed-beds seemed to contain any number of
Little Crakes ( Porzana palust/is) whose plaintive notes were

heard on every side. One stood quite still, not more than ten
yards from our boat, and gave me an excellent view through my
field glasses.
My companion and an assistant from the Perth Zoo set the
long nets we had brought with us, in the water round the clumps
of reeds, and then we proceeded to set some wire rat-traps baited
with pieces of cray-fish for the fine carnivorous Yellow-bellied
Water Rat which is quite common in the banks of most of the
lakes and rivers of Australia. Having done this we rowed back
to the lauding place, where we met Mr. E. A. Le Souef and pro-
ceeded to discuss our supper in the boatman's shanty, surrounded
on all sides by the chirping and booming of frogs innumerable,
while the mosquitoes gave us 110 peace. After supper we rowed
by moonlight to inspect the nets before turning in, but nothing
had been caught. We slept soundly that night, curled up in our
rugs on the sandy margin of the lake.
Early the next morning we rose, made some tea in a billy-
can and then proceeded to inspect our nets. We were not alto-
gether unsuccessful, capturing two Pied Cormorants (Phalacro
corax hypoleucus ) and two Musk Ducks, as well as a Yellow-
bellied Water Rat.
As we rowed amongst the reeds a Black Swan rose from
the water quite close to us, with loud flappings of its pinions
on the water. Ducks rose from all around ns, while a White-
winged Butcher-bird piped its flute-like notes from a branch
lead gum tree by the water's edge, waiting for his breakfast
\0x25A0 n up in the form of some unsuspecting White-eye or other
bird.

in English. It describes fully the methods which have been
adopted by Baron von Berlepsch, who has spent many years in
studying the habits of birds, especially those which are of dis-
tinct utility to man, with a view to protecting them and inducing
them to live and propogate in his neighbourhood.
Baron von Berlepsch has long seen that the chief cause of
the undoubted diminution in many species of birds lies in the
destruction of their natural homes. The cutting down of woods
and forests, the reclaiming of marsh lauds and the progress of
bricks and mortar. It stands to reason that if there are very few
nesting sites that very few birds can occupy them and hence the
birds must become scarce. This fact led the Baron to supply
artificial nesting sites in the form of hollow logs designed after the
pattern of the Woodpecker's nest-hole. These artificial nesting
logs are now manufactured extensively in Germany and are
largely used. Besides these the Barou has planted numbers of
special shelter-woods, consisting of the kinds of trees and shrubs
most appreciated by nesting birds. Such subjects as the feeding
of birds in winter, food houses and food trees are fully described.
There is no doubt that Baron von Berlepsch has adopted
the very best means to serve the cause of bird protection, and
that his methods have been crowned with success is abundantly
proved as the following extract from the book under notice will
show :--
" The author was able to convince himself that go per cent,
of the 2,000 boxes in the Wood at Kauimerforst (part of the
Seebach experimental station, and nearly all of the 500 at See-
bach, and of the 2,100 near Cassel, were occupied by various
species. The Prussian Board of Agriculture has caused various
experiments to be made with these boxes, with excellent results,
as published documents affirm.
" Of the 9,300 boxes hung up by the Government in the
State and Communal Woods of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, 70-
80 per cent, were used the first year, and all have been inhabite
this year (1907). ,

Baron von Berlepsch, in which there had long been nesting-
boxes, of which there are now more than 2,000, was untouched.

A special Report, by Captain Stanley S. Flower, the Director of the
Zoological Gardens, at Giza, Egypt, deals with the various Zoological
Gardens of Europe in a very useful manner.
In 1905 Captain Flower visited Europe in order to acquire information
for the benefit of the Egyptian Zoological Gardens, and in May of the fol-
lowing year a " Report on a Mission to Europe, 1905," appeared.
I11 1907, Captain Flower again visited Europe and spent much time at
the various Zoological Gardens, with the result that he has been able to
supplement his former Report and to issue one&amp;apos; that cannot fail to be most
useful to those who are interested in the acclimatization of wild animals.
The Report deals with no less than twenty-one Zoological collections, both
public and private, eight Aquariums and seven Museums. A list of all the
living Antelopes seen in Europe is added, as well as a list of those in the
Giza Gardens. Zoologists owe Captain Flower a debt of gratitude for his
useful publication.

Sir, --The following curious nesting arrangements happened in my
garden this Spring, and I think they are worth recording.
A Pied Wagtail had a nest containing three eggs in some ivy just out-
side my dining-room window. I was surprised one day to see a Robin
come from the ivy near the Wagtail's nest, so I examined the nest and
found it contained three Wagtails' and three Robins' eggs ; I never saw the
Wagtails in the garden again, but the Robin sat and hatched two Wagtail's
eggs and two of her own eggs, and reared them successfully, though the
Wagtails were ready to fly some days before the Robins.
After they had flown I observed one young Wagtail trying to induce
a cock Sparrow to feed it, a fruitless effort ! I fancy the Wagtails did not
know who tlieir mother was, however they managed to survive all right and
I constantly saw them about the garden in company with the young Robins.
The Robin had started to build very early in the season in the site
eventually used by the Wagtail, but forsook it and reared her first brood
higher up in the ivy, and then, I fancy, came back intending to rear
another brood in the spot she had first selected, and finding it already
occupied drove the Wagtail out. H. Wormaed.

THE BLACK-CHEEKED LOVEBIRD.
Agapornis nigrigenis.
It seems to me that some of our Museum friends, who
bestow upon our birds their high faluting titles, are sometimes
colour-blind.
The beautiful Love-bird which is figured in this number is
no more black -cheeked than I am !
The cheeks are a very deep brown, perhaps the colour of
the woodwork in an old Swiss Chalet, but most certainly not
black.
The forehead and crown of the head is dark maroon-
cliestuut, and the cheeks may be described as a deep and burnt
addition of that, just as old oak is deeper than newer wood.
The female is to be distinguished from the male by her
lighter-coloured eye,* her smaller head, and her less brilliant
colouring, more especially in the frontal patch of apricot; but one
must look closely to see the differences.
I have had no chance of breeding these birds, because I
have kept them in a small cage for the benefit of the Society ! A
very noble sacrifice on my part ! The artist could not have very
well painted their picture, had I not done so. However it is a
pleasure to know that one of our most enthusiastic and pains-
taking members has successfully bred them.
I believe that Mr. Phillipps and I are as yet the only
possessors of these beautiful little parrots. To him I leave the
reading of the second lesson.

By Reginald Phillipps.
In May last, I introduced to our readers three examples of
this rare and little-known species, and referred to two others that
I had seen. Shortly afterwards, two more arrived; and I learnt
that all the seven, although not "made in Germany," reached
London through that country. These latter, which likewise I
saw, were doubtless a pair : they differed from one another in
sundry small ways--but then they appeared to be of different ages.
To be able to sex a bird at sight is of the first importance to
aviculturists ; so we may well, for a moment, consider the question
of the sex of the Black-clieeked Lovebird.
These seven birds, or some of them, although generally
alike (I am here, of necessity, speaking chiefly of those differ-
ences which may be observed without handling the bird), differed
slightly from one another in the shading of various parts of their
plumage. If they could be divided by these differences into two,
and only two, groups, one might feel justified in saying that the
differences are sexual ; but I am not satisfied that they could be
so divided, even if it were possible to bring the birds together
and compare them with one another side by side. Nevertheless,
some of the differences may betoken a difference of sex.
The male and female of the adult Madagascar Lovebird
(A. canal) conspicuously differ from each other. Roughly speak-
ing, the differences lie in the region of the head and in the
under wing-coverts. Then we have the Red-faced Lovebird ( A.
pullaria ) ; here again the sexes differ, at any rate after the first
moult; and the differences are found in the face, the under wing-
coverts, and in the metacarpal edge. The British Museum Cata-
logue of Birds (XX., pp. 506 and 509) tells us that the adult
Abyssinian Lovebird (A. iaranta) also differs, and again in the
region of the face and in the under wing-coverts. On the other
hand, it is often practically impossible to be sure of the sex of a
couple of the Ros)' , -faced birds (A. roseicollis). The sexes of the

other three species ( A. fischeri , perso 7 iata , and swhidereiiiana )
mentioned in the Catalogue are, or were when vol. XX was
published, supposed to be alike ; and I understand that the same
may be said of A. liliaiue. Concerning A. zenkeri (Handlist II.,
p. 35), I am without information. It might appear, therefore, that,
if any apparent differences in plumage between the sexes of the
subject under consideration do exist, we might expect to find
them somewhere in the region of the face or of the under wing-
coverts.
As regards the under wing-coverts, I think we had better
withhold judgment for the present. Further examinations are
needed.
But possibly the metacarpal edge may help us--yellow in
the male and green in the female. My birds are flying about and
nesting, and cannot be closely inspected ; and my eyes are old ;
so I must leave it to others to look into this and other points.
The shading and extent of the colours which occupy the
upper part of the head, from the cere to the hind-neck, and also
the sides of the face, are elusive and aggravating. It is com-
paratively easy, when one has a couple or a series of skins, to lay
them out on a table side by side, in a good light, and make
remarks and draw conclusions, but try it with living examples,
not seen together perhaps, in any or no light, bobbing up and
down and turning hither and thither! Moreover, in the Black-
cheeked Lovebird, the shades of colour in this region differ
according to the light, and according to the angle at which one
sees them. I was much struck, one day, while looking down at
the nestlings from above --in a poor light. The elder two turned
restive, and stretched their heads up towards the opening at the
side-top of their domed nest, as if meditating a bolt. The sinci-
put of one seemed to be of a deep blackish colour, of the other
not blackish but brown. Assuming that the one was some two
days older than the other, yet the extra two days' development of
feathers which for over a week had seemed to be fully grown
would hardly be sufficient of itself to account for the difference.
When these two appeared as fledgelings in the aviary, the differ-
ence in colouring was almost imperceptible--but I take them to
be male and female, so perhaps there is something in it, and that

the colouring of this region may be different in the sexes ; but
whether the differences are sufficient to enable one to sex an odd
bird at sight is another matter.
When my male is sitting in the garden side by side with
the odd female, on examining them through a binocular, I
observe that the blackish of the cheeks, as it extends upwards,
appears to be more profuse behind the eye in the male than in
the female; but when the comparison is made with the old female
under precisely similar circumstances--and I have examined the
three over and over again as now the one couple now the other
sit on their favourite perch--although the difference exists, it is
much less apparent. As regards age, the male (see my notes on
the three birds which appeared in May--after rectification of
sexes, as stated below) is supposed to be intermediate between
the two females. Therefore, if our premises are correct, the
blackish behind the eye is the more profuse in the old than in
the young female, and more profuse in the grown up male ( ? at
what age) than in the female at any age. In the fledgelings, the
dark colouring behind the eye is at first almost non-existent.
But have we not something pretty sure to go upon in the
colour of the eye ? I have three more or less adult examples, two
of which have the dark yellow-brown eyes I mentioned in May,
the other the pale yellow-brown eye--and the two dark-eyed birds
have now proved themselves to be of the same, and the pale-eyed
of the opposite, sex.
I am told that the two of the first five which I did not
retain also have different coloured eyes, and that they are a pair.
The last two arrivals, almost certainly a pair, were in a
show cage when I saw them ; they were crouching down, quite
mute, side by side on the bottom of the cage, but their upper
parts were well displayed, and the difference in the colouring of
the eyes at once attracted attention. But it was the pale-eyed bh&amp;apos;d
which appeared to be the viale, whereas, in May, it was my pale-
eyed bird which I described as the female, and the other two as
males:--I have since ascertained that the "Immature male" of
p. 209 has the dark eye.
Facts are stubborn tilings. Little by little it dawned upon
&amp;apos;me that I had mistaken the sexes of my birds ; stubborn facts

stared me in the face, and became more and more stubborn as
nests were built, eggs laid, and young birds made their appear-
ance. My pale-eyed bird is the male, the two dark-eyed are
females ; and I must ask our readers to alter " male" to " female,"
and vice versa, in their copies of my previous account, of the
Black-cheeked Lovebird so far as the references are to my own
birds.
It seems to me that the evidence points rather strongly to
there being a sexual difference in the colour of the iris, that of
the adult male being of a perceptibly lighter shade than that of
the female. The eyes of the nestlings, as far as I was able to
make anything of them, were black, or at any rate very dark.
Speaking of parrots generally, in those species which in-
dicate the sex by the colour of the eye, is it not usually the young
and the female that have the darker eye? If so, the Black-
cheeked Lovebird appears to follow this rule.
The story of my odd female--the "Immature male" of
page 209--is of some interest, and may be brought in here.
When the birds, the original five, were unexpectedly
dumped down before me, they were still in the dark travelling
cage in which they had just arrived from Germany. Four of
them were 011 a perch at the back, the fifth on the bottom of the
cage. Of the four 011 the perch, three, directly they were un-
covered, commenced to shriek, and flick their tails, and gesticu-
late like mad creatures, each one encouraging and inciting its
companions ever to greater and more strenuous efforts towards
uproar and confusion : in my innocent and chivalrous heart, I
supposed that they must be males. Alas! I now know that they
were yelling out "Votes for women!" The fourth, sandwiched
in between the shrieking three and the side of the box, had been
horribly mangled by its companions, and was in a bad wajr. I
concluded that it would have been thus maltreated by those of
its own sex, and consequently that it too must be a male. Alas,
once more ; I had forgotten the tricoteuses of '92 over the way,
and the scenes that were going on less than one hundred years
ago in the neighbourhood of Parliament Square, and elsewhere,
revealing to us how unlovely woman can be when she is not true
to herself. So I will not offer any apology for having reversed

Mr. R. Phiixipps,
the sexes last May, and called the males "females," and the
females " males" ; though I feel that one is due to my own male,
for he it was that, ashamed of the company in which he found
himself, was sitting silent and undemonstrative on the floor of
the cage, and upon whom I immediately pounced, under the idea
that probably I had secured the only female out of the lot. In
this dark cage, by the way, I could not see the eyes, and, not
suspecting a difference, did not look for one.
I had the injured bird placed in a separate cage, to give it
a chance for its life. A few days later, it was offered to me again,
at half price; and I accepted it, more out of pity than for any
other reason ; and I am very glad that I did so.
I dressed the poor creature's wounds, which were very
serious, only when absolutely obliged to, for it was impossible to
handle it without giving it acute pain, and, worse still, its agony
of nervous terror when taken up worked more mischief than
continuous dressings would have done good. Slowly and linger-
ingly it faded away, until for two or three days it was seemingly
lifeless ; and on one occasion I actually put my hand into the
cage for the purpose of removing the dead body--when a slight
flicker of an eyelid restrained me. A day or so later, the sun
began to shine ; and I placed the cage in the sun. The genial
warmth of the sun seemed to arouse the invalid from its deadly
lethargy, and to give it hope and a desire to live, and from that
day it steadily improved. She--no longer an "it"--has since
not only been flying about the aviary, strong on the wing but
taking a perch--and only the thick ones--with difficulty, but has
built a nest, and is now sitting steadily, though perhaps on un-
fertile eggs. Having lost not less than three toes, and with one
leg permanently crippled, she is unable to get in and out of a log,
and has built the nest--not a small one, judging by the amount
of material carried--on a hidden-away shelf. The amount of
litter dropped daily from the nest while it was in building spoke
eloquently of the difficulty she experienced in getting the stuff
into position, and of her industry and perseverance.
While the other female was sitting, the cripple sought out
and secured, in spite of many a rebuff, a good deal of the com-
pany of the male ; the latter had no affection for her, but he was

lonely and had nothing to do, and had a certain amount of fellow
feeling for her in her loneliness ; and, as far as I could observe,
he helped her considerably in the by no means light task (a most
serious one for a cripple) of hewing and carrying "timber" for
the building of her house. It is especially noteworthy that he
seemed to assist only in the cutting and carrying of the sticks,
and left her to attend to the more simple work of collecting spray
stalks, hay, and the like. I fear that it will not be possible to
inspect the interior of this nest without damaging the structure.
Moreover, it is in the garden, so that I could not go near it with-
out being seen. The probability is that nothing will come of this
nest, but there is no knowing ; and if she should have but one
young one to cheer up and encourage her lonely heart I should be
exceedingly pleased, for she used often to look so piteously
forlorn.
From the foregoing experience, I think we may regard the
Black-cheeked Lovebird as a good liver and tenacious of life--
but it perceptibly shrinks from cold. It delights in the warmth of
the sun, but betrays in many little ways its love for the gloom
and solitude of the forest--but of the zvarm forest.
The presence of this odd bird has shewn me, which needed
no shewing, that this species is gregarious, but that each pair
keep strictly to their own nest; and also that no female will
permit another to build too near to her own retreat. While the
females are sitting, doubtless the males, with any odd birds, feed
and fly off to water together. Probably they pair for life.
At times they are rather noisy; and their calls and cries
are perhaps less musical than is the case with either of the other
three species that have been brought to this country. But they
can be singularly quiet when quite at peace. After the four
young had left the nest, I repeatedly noticed the family party of
five or six playing or feeding together, hour after hour, without
uttering a sound beyond some soft low chattering.
The nervousness which was displayed by my three birds
for some time after their arrival seems quite to have passed away,
and they now appear trustful and confiding so long as I keep
entirely away from the vicinity of the nest. If I am caught in
the birdroom, I am regarded with grave suspicion. Their natur-

Mr. R. Phiixipps,
ally shy nature still asserts itself in certain little ways, such as
their refusal to stay on or go to the ground should any one be
present, or to remain on even the highest perch should any one
endeavour to go beneath them. More than once, when rushing
out with long stick or hand-net to drive in a youngster from cold
or wet, the male would invariably keep to the side of the nestling
utterly ignoring my wild gesticulations and brandishing of fear-
some weapons--he had long since found out that I didn't matter.
Several birds, some very small, live in the aviary with
them, but not one has been hurt, for there is a sufficiency of
space; though in a small place there might be danger; but they
were never vicious and spiteful like the Madagascar species.
They seem to be honest, straightforward, good-hearted fellows--
and especially were they straightforward ,, for when they used to
go for a bird they would go for him very straight indeed, with
mouth wide open, and without any misleading hesitation or sen-
timental indecision whatever. But this phase likewise seems to
have passed away with their nervousness ; probably enough, both
had origin in the same cause.
In 1896, I wrote two papers on the Lovebirds (O.S. II., pp.
49 and 128)--the true Lovebirds of the genus Agapornis --which,
notwithstanding one or two blemishes, fairly described the
peculiar nesting habits of the Lovebirds so far as they were
known, and to them I refer those of our readers who are un-
acquainted with the private life of these little creatures, so insipid
and uninteresting when kept in tiny prisons, as at the Zoo. for
instance, so full of quaint interest when free in a large place.
Protection from the weather is imperative ( A. cana may be a
possible exception, but I doubt it), but, during the warmer
months, free access to the open air, especially to a well-wooded
natural aviary, is of the first importance if their natural habits
are to be brought out.
To the account above referred to I may add that ten species
of Lovebirds (A gapornis&amp;apos;) are now known to scientists, of which
living examples of only four have found their way to this country ;
a recent report that the Masked Lovebird, A. perso?iata, had
arrived was unfounded.
Since I wrote in 1896, the Red-faced Lovebird has nested

here and in a few other instances, but probably the young
that have been fully reared in this country may be numbered 011
the fingers of one hand. My Red-faced Lovebirds made but very
poor and scanty nests ; they were never seen while carrying
materials, so I am unable to say how they conveyed to their log
the very little that was there. This species is sadly handicapped
by having had its wings cut before it reaches our shores, by the
tainted and often diseased condition (due to overcrowding) in
which it generally arrives, and too often by the injudicious treat-
ment to which it is occasionally subjected after arrival:--it was
\0x25A0" Trade " one dealer was at pains to explain to me ; but a trade
custom which, for the sake of expediting their sale, injures the
birds is of questionable morality and a short-sighted policy. A
thoroughly sound healthy pair of Red-faced Lovebirds, strong on
the ruing and with the muscles, &amp;c., of the wing unstrained , is a
possession to be proud of, a fact which wonderfully few people
are aware of, and last of all judges at the Bird Shows and certain
other " authorities."
The Rosy-faced Lovebird may be bred rather easily. For
an account of its nesting, and mode of carrying materials, see the
Avicultural Magazine for July, 1896. The difficulty with this
species is to obtain a true pair.
Let us now turn to the nesting of my Black-cheeked Love-
birds. Their surroundings here are artificial, not as I should
wish them to be, for oilier birds have possession of my best sum-
mer aviary; so the following must be taken as an account of the
breeding of these individual birds in a particular place, not
necessarily as a typical case of the species.
These two birds came into my hands on the ninth day of
the month of fools--happily April 1st had been safely tided over
before they arrived--and were placed in a small cage in my
dining-room. They shed a few feathers, and seemed to be just
finishing off their moult. On the 25th, I noticed that both of
them were passing bits of spray millet sideways backwards and
forwards between their mandibles. I knew well what that meant,
and immediately transferred them to a rather large box cage, in a
screened corner of which I placed a nesting-log, and supplied

materials of various kinds. They at once took to the log, both
sleeping in it at night, and both occasionally carrying materials
into it in their beaks. While the female was in the log, which
was not of infrequent occurrence, the male would sit outside and
"sing." From time to time the male would regurgitate food,
which at first he did with so much difficulty (being probably a
rather young bird) I really feared that something might be stuck
in his throat. This action was accompanied by a curious low
noise, a sort of kiick, kuck, kick , which doubtless was a call to the
female in the log, for she would promptly come out and seat her-
self by his side, and partake of food from his mouth in the usual
manner. Another very similar note is cook , cook, frequently re-
peated in a low voice. It was uttered by one of the parents, in the
company of its mate and young ones, and seemed to be an invitation
to the mate to come and examine into the merits and demerits of
a possible new nesting-site. As far as I was able to observe, all
their love-passages, even in the aviary, take place in the open.
They favour a particular part of a particular perch, from which,
curiously enough, they cannot see even the entrance to the bird-
room much less keep an eye on the nest; they like to feed in one
particular spot, which, too, has the disadvantage--to our minds--
of being actually as far removed from, and as completely out of
sight of, the nest as the limits of the aviary will permit; and in
many ways they betray their likings for particular localities. In
the wild state, doubtless they keep much to that part of the
forest to which they have been accustomed from their fledgeling
state; while their rapid flight would enable them to go off for
water to their favourite Muguazi river, and return to their homes,
in a very short space of time. Mais a nos perroquets :--no eggs
were laid in this cage. The log was fairly well concealed, but
not sufficiently so for them. By their occasional fits of dashing
and banging about, they plainly shewed that they had a soul
above such straitened quarters; and so, on May 26, they were
transferred to the birdroom, where, having repelled and utterly
routed my old male Varied Lorikeet (N.S. I., p. 287), who resented
their intrusion and continues to resent their masterfulness, they
quickly settled down. The window of the birdroom opens into
that part of the garden aviary in which trees do not live, thanks

to its occupants; the principal dead tree is a common black
poplar; and, fastened up against the outside wall of the house,
are several birch brooms, which really were new once, although&amp;apos;
one might hardly believe it from their present appearance.
During the first half of June, these two birds, but especially
and for a longer period the female, were constantly attacking the
dead poplar. Their desire, of course, was to chip off little strips
of bark, after the manner of the Rosy-faced Lovebird, but, as
there was not any bark, they had to put up with little strips, or
lengthened chips, of the wood itself, which they passed sideways
backwards and forwards between their mandibles, for the purpose
of making them soft and supple. But not once did I notice any
attempt to fix material among the feathers: they invariably
carried in the beak. It is likely enough that, if they had had
access to living trees, they would have carried strips of bark
amongst the feathers of the lower back and upper tail-coverts,,
after the orthodox fashion. They also, but principally the female,
carried hay, stalks of wheat, spray millet stalks, and sticks. Most
of the latter were cut (gnawed) from the birch brooms * fastened
against the house, but some were picked up off the ground.
The female took to her nest on June 20--probably the first
egg was laid that day. O11 the 23rd, noticing the female in the
garden with the male, I slipped into the birdroom, lifted down the
log, and found two eggs in quite a substantial nest. The eggs,
* A curious little episode occurred in connection with this wood-cutting&quot;. A pair of
Cuba Finches, Phonipara canora , built a nest in one of the brooms. Then came the Love-
birds and carried off a large part of the broom, .leaving the nest very much exposed, and
frightening away the tiny Cubas. A little later, however, mother Cuba was sitting on this
nest, when, one morning&quot;, I found that it had been partially destroyed by a female Pied
Rock-Thrush, and the female herself injured, besides the whole of her tail being pulled
out. The nest had been very much dragged about, but I found two eggs still in it, each
hidden away separately in a tiny pocket--not by accident, I think. I shut up the Thrush, the
only evil-minded bird of this species I have ever possessed : and the plucky little Cuba
returned to her nest--but, after two or three days, deserted it as I thought. I saw the male
carrying a little hay, and the female slept in or near the nest at night; but I never
imagined that anything was going on, for the female had not recovered from the Thrush's
attack, and the male also had had a nasty peck. I heard the funny si-si-sl-si of the
baby Cuba ; but this cry is a difficult one to locate, and I connected it with some nesting
Cubas in the adjoining aviary. On September 2, very much to my surprise, I found two
sturdy fledgeling Cubas in the aviary, which are being carefully fed and attended to by the
father. They are often to be seen in the dead poplar with the Lovebirds, and no attemp
has been made to injure them.--R.P.

Mr. R. Phillipps,
of course white, were of a much elongated pear shape, and, in
this respect, different from those of either cana, piillai&amp;apos;ia, or
roseicollis :--but the shape may be an idiosyncrasy of this par-
ticular female and not a typical one of the species. The eggs of
the other Lovebirds in my collection are roughly as follows:--
The Madagascar Lovebird, one specimen, an ordinary oval egg,
but with the two ends practically equal in thickness ; the Red-
faced, ten specimens, larger, a few ordinary oval, but most of them
of a thick, bulky, roundish oval ; the Rosy-faced, ten specimens, of
the same character as the last named but larger. The eggs of
the Black-cheeked Lovebird were, I should suppose, a little
larger than those of the Madagascar species ; probably they were
laid on alternate days.
The nest is in an ordinary trade nesting-log, externally
twelve inches high without the top, which I had removed. It is
placed upright, and reaches to the roof, at the back, of the "house "
inside which it is placed&amp;apos;; but, as the roof is a sloping one, there
is just sufficient space to allow of a bird to creep in at the open
top; there is also the usual aperture high up on the side of the
log. The diameter of the circular inside of the log, measured
across the mouth, is just about 5J inches.
When I peeped into the logon June 23, I found a substan-
tial but quite open nest. Immediately below the side aperture,
and reaching up to it, there were a few upright sticks. As I sup-
posed at the time, and have since found to be actually the case,
one of the motives, doubtless the primary one, for the placing of
these sticks in this singular position was that the}&amp;apos;- might serve
as a ladder to enable the sitting female to climb quickly out, so
as to be ready for immediate flight 011 the approach of danger ;
for the inside of these old-fashioned logs which have been
hollowed out with a lathe is very hard and smooth, and offers no
aids to climbing ; and so to enable her to get in gently, and to
escape rapidly, some assistance was needed. At one time I
supposed that the sticks were placed in the log for the purpose
of making the circumference smaller, but this is unlikely. In
addition to the sticks, there were stalks of various kinds, some
spray millet, a little hay, and a good collection of chawed chip-
pings, which seemed to form a sufficiently comfortable nest--and
probably a sanitary one.

After peeping into the log, I replaced it, or tried to do so,,
exactly as it had been before; but some subtle instinct seems to
have warned the female that Peeping Tom had been prying, for,
with almost frantic energy, she recommenced carrying materials,
one of the objects being to stop up the side aperture, and thus,
according to her lights, absolutely conceal the nest--for what
creature in the whole wide world but a Lovebird, and that Love-
bird a Nigrigenis , could possibly imagine that any ingress to a
nest could by any possibility be obtained by that tiny chink at
the top of the log, in that dark corner, so entirely hidden away
by the overhanging eaves of the "house" which she had with
such cunning and foresight selected as a cradle for her offspring!&amp;apos;
By the 26th, in addition to other important affairs of which I had
not the faintest suspicion, the work of building up the aperture
on the inside was completed ; and, as a display of triumphant
superiority and decorative ingenuity, the whole was finished off
by the fixing in the aperture the stalk end of a long and practi-
cally untouched spray of millet, which was to be seen (for a few
days only, as other birds came to feed on the millet and dragged
down the spray) dangling down from the aperture outside, so-
that all the world and his wife might see that really there was
nothing there. At this time, the amount of stuff which was
carried from the garden to the birdroom by the female was quite
considerable ; on the 25th, she had hold of a curved stick nearly
as thick as my little finger and about a foot long which, owing to-
its bow-shape, gave her much trouble ; for some minutes she
strove with its contrariness in vain, dropping it more than once,
but, undaunted, she persevered and eventually succeeded in
carrying it to the birdroom : if that does not mean broken eggs,.
I thought, well -- ! In all her work, the female was encouraged
and aided by the male, but chiefly out-of-doors, for the male
rarely went into the birdroom during the day.

A COLLECTION OF RARE BIRDS FROM
NEW GUINEA.

By Hubert D. Astley, M.A.
It was a great privilege, through the kindness of Mr. and
Mrs. Johnstone, who invited me to see the beautiful collection
that Mr. Goodfellow brought back at the beginning of Septem-
ber, to be able to examine closely such rarities ; and a privilege
also to be asked to write a description of these lovely birds.
Few there are, one cannot but believe, who would be able
to bring back to England from the mountainous districts of far
*off New Guinea, in such splendid health and condition as Mr.
Goodfellow has done.
The terrible difficulty of transport through pathless forests,
*of keeping up the supply of suitable food, and furthermore of
feeding wild-caught birds even if the food is at hand ; the keep-
ing of many treasures upon board-ship, the varieties of climates
through which they must pass, the heat of the Red Sea, the fall
of the temperature in the Mediterranean ; and finally, may be,
the boisterous waves of the Bay, to be capped by the dampness
and changeability of poor old England, all go to make up a task
&amp;apos;which not many people would care to undertake.
The collection which Mrs. Johnstone has housed includes
*species of birds that have certainly never been brought to England
hitherto, or probably to Europe either. It must be remembered
that Mr. Goodfellow&amp;apos; has done really hard work to accomplish what
he has, spending many weeks in the midst of the melancholy and
vast forests, with the odour of rotting wood and damp vegetation
around him, and the dreary twilight caused by the giant trees
interlaced with a thick net-work of a thousand creepers.
Alone too, except for ignorant natives, who can hardly be
\0x25A0described as perfect gentlemen in their habits, natives whose
" bonne bouche" at supper time may be, and sometimes are, the
brains and other dainty portions of one of their fellow creatures !
Yet much of that is balanced by the intense interest in the beauty
of the bird-life around; beauty that is known, and at times
beauty that is unexpected in the appearance and perhaps capture
\0x25A0of some new species, some Paradise Birds hitherto undiscovered.

But there is no ruthless destruction, no decimation of the
feathered ranks, such as goes on because the women of Europe
and America follows the shameful fashion of wearing plumes
upon their heads.
Just a few pairs of each species are brought home to be
admired in the living flesh by many bird-lovers, and the rest
released. Mr. Goodfellow for instance gave liberty to a large
quantity of Paradise Birds, because he felt he could not house
them properly, or find a home for so many in England. Had he
been a plume-trader, where would those birds be now? Certainly
not in the forests of New Guinea, but only their skins figuring
in a hat in some shop window, perhaps in Regent Street or the
Avenue de l'Opera in Paris, to be finally perched upon a mat of
artificial curls, which in their turn are stuck upon some head, the
brains of which are never troubled (if brains there are!) as to
whether their owners are encouraging the slaughter of thousands
and thousands of birds, the extinction of species.
The birds in Mrs. Johnstone's new collection number just
one hundred.
Some of the species of Paradise Birds have already been
landed in this country this summer by Mr. Horsbrugh who has
been collecting for Sir William Ingram, but Mr. Goodfellow
brought with him two species new to aviculture ; the Superb
and d' Alberti's Paradise Birds, one male of each kind. Both
birds are in immature plumage.
The Superb ( Lophorina superba&amp;apos;) male, when adult, has
the body of the colour and texture of the softest black velvet, a
large cape of the same, which can be erected over the head, lying
on the back ; whilst a marvellous gorget pointed outwards 011
either side of the breast, is of scintillating golden emerald green.
D'Aeberti's Paradise Bird ( Drepanornis alberlisi ) is con-
spicuous for its long and slender arched bill, and for the wonder-
ful double fans covering flanks and thighs; which, glittering
with violet and green, can be spread out in the display.
Besides these two treasures, there are the following: --
The Marchese Raggi's Paradise Bird ( Paradisea rag-
giana) of which there are four pairs and a single bird. Can these
be P. intermedia ? I wondered whether the side plumes were of

Mr. H. D. Astley,
a bright enough red for P. raggiana ? Two of these are hand-
reared, and one of them was found by Mr. Goodfellow in the
form of an egg. The nest was in course of construction, and the
whole process was watched, being built quite low down beneath
the great trees of the forest, as is apparently the usual habit of
these birds, since there are so many birds of prey which would
destroy the young ones in more exposed positions.
Only one egg is laid, and two hen birds were captured
along with their single young birds, so that although the females
of the Paradise Birds are so seldom imported, we are quite
certain of their identity in this case.
The Magnificent Paradise Bird. Nine pairs and a
single hen. In the specimens brought by Mr. Goodfellow, it
seemed to me, although my remarks must not be taken too
seriously, having had little time to examine them closely, that
they are not the bird entitled Diphyllodes magnified (which I
presume to be the type) but either D. seleucides (Lesson's Paradise
Bird) or D. chrysoptera. Their wings are not orange enough for
D. hunsteini; which in any case, inhabits a different part of
the country.
A very interesting fact with regard to the habits of these
birds is that the males select some small tree, from which they
strip all the leaves, carrying them away, and permitting no refuse
around their playground. On the bared branches the males
display and dance, so that all their beauty can be seen. Mr.
Goodfellow threw some leaves down upon the space that they
had cleared beneath the sapling, and the birds with cries of in-
dignation removed the offending obstacles.
Of Lawes' Six-plumed Paradise Bird ( &amp;apos;Paroiia lawesi )
five pairs and one single male have arrived.
I saw more than one male in full plumage, the racqueted
shafts which spring from the sides of the head, lying over the
shoulders, the beautiful blue eyes shining conspicuously against
the velvety black plumage, and the splendid gorget of golden
emerald green as a burnished breastplate.
Of The Magnificent Rifle-Bird ( Craspedophora mag-
nifica) there were three pairs, but most unfortunately one female
escaped at Bnrrswood and was lost to sight amongst the oak
trees.

Of Manucodes, three splendid specimens of Phonygama
p 7 irpureoviolacea arrived, as well as a darker coloured Manucode,
which might possibly be Phonygama hunsteini. These birds
when seen in sunshine, are very fine. They scintillate with
purple and green iridescence.
Five Gardener Bower Birds {Amblyornis subalaris) were
brought, one of which, a male in full plumage with a splendid
crown of golden orange, unfortunately died at Genoa through
battering itself in its terror at the booming of guns around it in
the Port at night. The bird was in the very finest condition, its
skin looking as if it had been freshly killed in a wild state.
One of these five is of a different species, a young male
and larger, presumably Amblyornis inornata. There can be
nothing more intensely interesting and marvellous in nature's
productions than is the bower and garden of this bird, decorated
as it is with a carpet of moss, upon which are arranged bright
blossoms of orchid and other flowers, berries, beetles, etc. Often
the birds have a taste for two particular colours, such as blue and
orange; the primary ones. Mr. Goodfellow caught his Gardeners
by this means. Finding that at one of the bowers a certain berry
of a bright blue was used as a decoration, he placed in a trap a
blue bead which exactly resembled it, and the bird came to fetch
it : and in another instance he filched from the mossy carpet a
scarlet blossom which lay there, and the bird came down when
all was still to take it back ! It is pathetic to know that it was
captured because it loved to beautify its forest home, and that in
evincing such intelligence and aesthetic feeling, it was not in-
telligent enough to distinguish the cunning means which ended
in its loss of liberty. Let us hope that these wonderful birds,
as surely will be so, will find a home in some spacious aviary,
where all will be supplied to make them contented, and where
they will not feel they are "by the waters of Babylon"!
I must not pass away from the subject of the Paradise and
Bower Birds without mentioning the skin of a member of the
latter family which Mr. Goodfellow showed me. It is Loria
viaiice (a lady Macgregor's Bower Bird). A bird of the size of
the Gardener Bower Bird ; the male, a deep velvet black with
steel and violet-blue reflections; the female, greenish olive. A

Mr. H. D. AstlEY,
very curious feature in this bird is it's great gape of mouth, the
edges of which stand out at the sides in rather the same way as
in the case of young birds, such as Starling, etc. : within, the
mouth is primrose yellow and the throat pink, looking when
opened like the cup of a gloximia. This interesting Bower Bird
was found in 1894, (see Ibis , 1895, pi. viii. and p. 343), in the
Owen Stanley Range.
Of Lories, Mr. Goodfellow has brought home many in-
dividuals in magnificent condition and quite tame, representing
three species.
Charmosyna stellce, of which there are five pairs, are most
beautiful. In size about that of a Rosella Parrakeet, but of
much finer build, the gorgeous plumage, which is chiefly of a
rich cardinal red and magnolia green, having a gloss on it which
could be exceeded by no bird in the wild state. The tail is long
and pointed, and slightly curves inwards at the end, being green
at the base, and terminating in bright orange-red. The female
is distinguished by a patch of brilliant yellow on the lower back,
where in the male it is crimson. These Lories would make
charming pets, as they do not give vent to the ear-piercing
screams which most of the members of the family delight in.
Charmosy?iopsis pulchella of which there are four pairs and
two hens is not unlike a miuature edition of Charmosyna stellce.
A lovely little bird, very little larger in the body than a Budgeri-
gar, but not so long in the tail, which however is very pointed
and ends in a beautiful orange colour. It is called the Fair Lory
(or Lorikeet). It's head and underparts of a brilliant cardinal
red, with narrow streaks of yellow on the breast, a patch of violet-
blue at the back of the head, and it's upper parts and wings,
rich green ; the female can be distinguished by a patch of yellow
on the flanks.
Most confiding little jewels are these vividly-coloured birds.
One male of Hypocharmosyna placens (The Pleasing
Lorikeet) was brought, which made one long for more ! It's
colour a brilliant and rich green, the cheeks of a beautiful red
near the bill, and blue over the ears; red also predominating 011
the sides beneath the wings ; and the bill the same colour.
A great, or rather a little treasure died in the Mediter-

ranean, on the voyage home ; namely Hypocharmosyna wilhehnince ,
A Lorikeet of tiny size, smaller than a Budgerigar, and very
dainty in it's plumage of brilliant emerald green with frontal
stripes of yellow, and a turquoise blue patch at the back of the
head; a red bill and underwings, a patch of the same colour
on the rump, with violet just above the tail. The heat was so
great through the Red Sea, and then came chilly winds on the
coast of Europe.
Of Parrots, three splendid specimens of Aprosmic.tus
callopterus (The Yellow-wing King Parrot) were safely brought.
It was originally discovered by Signor D'Albertis during his
expedition on the Fly River, in New Guinea.
Bearing a strong family resemblance to the well-known
King Parrot of Australia, it is still more brilliant, with the upper
parts of a rich lazuliue blue, instead of green, and a broad patch
of vivid grass-green on the shoulders. It is probable that the
female is as vividly coloured as the male, for Mr. Goodfellow
often saw them in pairs, and the two birds were always similar.
A small pair of Parrots would seem to be Cyclopsitta dioph-
thalma , the Double-eyed Parrakeet, but I may be mistaken. It
is a little short-tailed parrot, rather larger than a Peach-faced
Love-Bird, having a body which is chiefly grass green ; red fore-
head, crown, and cheeks, and a brilliant spot of verdigris green
over the eyes towards the bill, from which it derives its name.
The flanks are edged with yellow along the outside of the
shoulders. The bill is strongly formed, after the manner of a
Cockatoo.
I should think that these little parrots would probably
breed in captivity without much ado. They, along with others
that I have written of, are great rarities in the avicultural world.
Still choicer, had they been brought alive, which alas! they were
not, are the Pygmy Parrots ( Nasitenue ).
Mr. Goodfellow had twelve of these delicious little birds,
but was forced to let them go owing to a failure in the supply of
seed.
There are nine known species of this family, but Mr.
Goodfellow had procured the most beautiful of them all, namely,
Bruju's Pygmy Parrot ( Nasitema brujni). It is no exaggeration

to say that these little Short-tailed Parrots, with bills a la Cocka-
too, are no larger than Pong-tailed Titmice in the body. They
are real midgets, and I could have wept freely and loudly when I
was shown the skins of a pair, after having had every hope of
seeing them alive, and even of possessing them ! !
In their wild state, they nest quite low down, either in a
hollow tree or in an ant's nest, and from one of these a native
brought in one night a whole family comprising the two parent
birds with their five young ones, having heard them squeaking as
he passed in the forest.
For many years I have longed for Pygmy Parrots, neither
do I yet give up hope.
Two beautiful Green Bulburs are in this collection ; the
one the size of a Park, the other somewhat smaller. Slenderly
built, and of a soft yet brilliant emerald grass-green, they are
certainly by no means the least lovely. They count for a great
deal " among so many."
Both are believed to be females ; indeed Mr. Goodfellow
knows the male of the larger one, at any rate, which he describes
as being more brilliantly coloured than the female. They are
very tame birds indeed, and would make charming pets, and
create a furore on the show bench.
Then there is a wonderful Drongo-Shrike, which, along
with the Green Bulbuls, came from Java. This bird's colouring
is a mysterious dark greenish bronze, with a burnished sheen
upon the plumage, a velvety black mask to the face, and brilliant
eyes of blue.
Another specimen of Dumont's Grackle ( Mino dumonti)
is included ; a bird which can be taught to speak extremely well.
There are three pairs of the fine White-Throatei&amp;gt;
Pigeon (Janthcenas albigularis). They are of the size and style
of a British Woodpigeon, grain-eaters, their colour is slaty grey,
their wings ate edged with green, the heads and breasts are
pinkish-lilac, and their throats are white, which shows in a
conspicuous patch against the rest of the plumage.
Three birds at once attracted one's attention amongst this
galaxy of varieties and beauty.
Two males and one female of Irena cyanea, the Malayan

Nesting of the Partridge Bronzewing Pigeon. 337
Fairy Blue Bird. They are related to the Bulbuls. In
size they may be compared to a rather large British Starling. In
colour, speaking sketchily, the male has the upper parts of a
gorgeous Turquoise blue which shines like satin, inclining to
silvery cobalt 011 the head, while the underparts and wings are
rich velvety black, and the eyes scarlet.
The female is a duller powdered blue green all over. A
pair of these treasures I carried home.
Finally there are three pairs of Three-coloured Parrot-
Finches (.Erythrura trichroa&amp;apos;). Their colouring is a rich green,
with faces of cobalt blue ; their rumps and tails (which are
pointed) are dull red. A great many might have been caught,
had the seed supply not been exhausted.
I may add that Mrs. Johnstone benefits her avicultural
friends by allowing them to purchase of her any birds which she
may not have room for. Most certainly all bird-lovers will be
grateful to her for giving them this opportunity, and to Mr.
Goodfellow for his zeal and perseverance in bringing to England
such rarities as have been safely deposited in Mrs. Johnstone's

PIGEON.
Geophaps scripta.
By T. H. Newman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The interesting notes on the Squatter Pigeons by our
Editor, which appeared in our August magazine of last year,
will be fresh in the minds of all. At the time that paper ap-
peared the birds had already passed into my possession, as they
came to me on July 5th, 1907. Needless to say how pleased I
was to obtain these most interesting and rare birds through our
Editor's kindness. I would advise all to read his paper before
this article, as I propose to follow up the history of the pair of
Partridge Pigeons. They have nested freely this summer, and
I hope my notes, made during the rearing of the young, may be
the means of clearing up some of the mystery which has hung
round the nestling of the genus Geophaps , for apparently the

Mr. T. H. Newman,
young of no other pigeons have excited so much difference
of opinion, and the statements that the young "are hatched
clothed with down, like a young Quail," and that they "fly
strongly when they are only as large as a Quail" have led to the
belief that these birds, which so wonderfully assimilate a Part-
ridge in appearance and habits, are really more Partridge than
Pigeon. It would be hard to find another case among birds of
one group approaching another so closely in superficial details as
the genus Geophaps does the Partridges. Yet in no point do they
really differ from the more typical Pigeons. As the excellent
photograph given in August 1907 shows, the bird closely resembles
a Gallinaceous bird in build. They run with the ease and elegance
of a pea-chick, the white band on each side of the breast also
adds to the resemblance ; they have a habit of raising themselves
on tip-toe and giving their wings a vigorous flap, in a way that
one almost expects them to give a crow, and I have noticed a
Partridge-like habit of&amp;apos; roosting in a group, their heads pointing
in different directions, their tails coming closely together in the
centre. The old birds are seldom far apart, and seem much
attached to one another, though they seldom indulge in the
caresses which most Pigeons so often do. They seem to keep up
a running conversation in a low " crooning" tone, as our Editor
has so well expressed it ; this doubtless serves to keep the birds
in touch when wandering about the bush. When the male meets
the female he often seems to go through a kind of show-off,
nodding his head and raising the feathers on his head and back,
and frequently salutes her with the coo proper, which is generally
a thrice repeated hurried coo, each accompanied by the usual
elevation of tail and wings. The birds are strictly terrestrial,
but are fond of perching on a stump or thick branch, once or
twice I have seen them perched on the small twigs of a bush, but
this is probably an acquired accomplishment. They never dust
like gallinaceous birds, and I have never seen them bathe, they
will lie on their side with one wing raised during a shower, like
other Pigeons; they are very peaceful and never fight, though one
day I noticed one defending itself against the attacks of a cock
Picui dove, which was flying furiously round its head, the reason
being that the Picui had had two young ones leave the nest on

that day, and I suppose he thought the big "Partridge" might
do them harm. My pair are quite tame, and altogether charming
birds in all ways.
The young birds are much wilder, they always I think
roost on the sand, either in the inner house or under the glass
shelter of their aviary. I will first quote Campbell in his " Nests
and Eggs of Australian Birds," as he tells us all that is known of
the nesting of this bird in the wild state. On page 690 he writes :
" Professqr Alfred Newton, Cambridge, has drawn my attention to
the statement made by Gould that ' the young both run and fly
strongly when they are only as large as a Quail, as I satisfactorily
ascertained by killing one which rose before me ; but at which
bird I had fired I had not the slightest conception until I picked
it up.' Gould's statement is somewhat ambiguous and un-
satisfactory, to say the least of it, and it is with very great
diffidence I have to qualify the statement of such an eminent
authority. It would indeed be remarkable were one of the Pigeon
tribe, after coming into down, to fly before fully feathered. I
wrote to the Messrs. Barnard for their field observations on the
subject. The following is Mr. Charles Barnard's reply : 'I have
noticed the passage in Gould re young Pigeons that you refer to.
I have seen them fly when only the size of a large Quail, but any
person could see it was the weak, uncertain flight of a young
bird, and when they alight they will allow themselves to be
picked up without attempting to escape. I do not think they
leave the nest until they are able to fly.' Mr. Harry Barnard
writes : ' The young Squatter Pigeons remain about a fortnight
in the nest till they can fly short distances; but they are easily
caught for some time after leaving the nest, as their flight is very
weak.' Further, Mr. Charles was good enough to forward to me
in spirits a pair of these young Pigeons about a week old, taken
from the nest. Judging from their unfeatliered wings, it would
have been impossible for them to 4 fly strongly' at such an early
age. Here is Mr. Barnard's own memo, which accompanied the
specimen : ' The young Pigeons were just about a week old when
I bottled them, the eggs were last seen on Monday afternoon,
30th March (1896) and I bottled the young early the following
Monday.'

Mr. T. H. Newman,
" There is another slight inaccuracy in Gonld's notes. He
states that the eggs are laid on the bare ground ' without any
nest.' It may be true in some instances, but the Messrs. Barnard
inform me thejr have frequently disturbed a pair of birds scratch-
ing out their little nesting hollow, which they line with soft, dry
grass. The Partridge Pigeon breeds at almost any period of the
year, but usually from September or October to well into the
autumn, the majority, perhaps, laying in January."
The interest of the subject, and the way in which it agrees
with my notes, must be my excuse for quoting so fully from such
a well-known work.
During the latter part of last year, the cock bird of my
pair would frequently sit by a tall tuft of grass, the leaves hang-
ing over and forming a shelter, uttering a low note to call the
hen, but no serious attempt was made to nest. In April 1908
the birds became anxious to nest, and on the 24th of that month
I found an egg with a hole at one end under an ivy b"L 1, which
is planted just outside the glass shelter. The ivy leaves nearly
concealed the nest. A small willow grows above the ivy, and
long grass surrounds the roots of the plants, the actual nest being
between the ivy root and a board, which forms the base of the
division from the next compartment of the aviary. No nest
seemed to be made, but some of the long grass was beaten down,
and formed a slight protection from the bare earth. A second
egg was laid on the 26th : the birds did not sit. This second egg
was put under some other doves, but it disappeared.
The eggs, of which I have three examples before me, are
small for the size of the bird, being scarcely larger than those of
the Barbary Dove. In colour they are a pale cream, not so
strongly tinted as those of Lophophaps ; in shape they are rather
rounded ovals, slightly more pointed at the smaller end, and are
smooth, possessing a considerable gloss.
I was away during the early part of May and, when I re-
turned, the birds were sitting on two eggs, only a few inches
from the spot chosen at first. I placed a glass shutter leaning
against the partition so as to protect the nest from rain, etc.
When they had been sitting for over a fortnight, I thought the
eggs were no good and gave them a shake, when I was horrified

to hear sundry audible squeaks from them, so I hastily replaced
them. The birds sit very closely. When the nest is disturbed
the sitting bird puffs out its feathers and utters low grunts, and
when the hand is put near the cock strikes out strongly with his
wing, the hen is not so fierce. If driven from the nest the bird
will pretend to be seriously hurt, first one wing and then the
other will be stretched out and quivered. On the 23rd May one
young one was hatched, the other egg contained a nearly full-
sized dead chick. This is my note made the same day : " Young
covered well with rather dark fawn down, but not more so than
many other doves, bill dark brown, almost black on edges of
mandibles, a white knob on both mandibles at tip, tip of bill
very pale grey, feet greyish pink." A later note from another
young one adds " the down is paler (pale yellow) on under
surface," and that there is "a bare line down breast and
abdomen." The two points of interest to be noted are (one) that
the you g is no more clothed with down like a young Quail than
many other species of Pigeons. Here is a note made 11. 8. 08.
" The two young hatched on August 8th are still perfectly helpless,
and differ in no way from the young of other Pigeons; on com-
parison with a young Deceptive Dove ( Turtur decipiens ) one day
old, the latter has quite as much down, but of a bright yellow
colour, while it is dark fawn in the former, though the Deceptive
was only about half the size it had a bill quite as long but thinner
the chief difference in shape lay in the head, the Partridges had a
very round one with a comparatively short thick bill, the quill
and scapular feathers were beginning to sprout. The smaller of
the two young had both eyes, and the other one eye, half open ;
they uttered a soft chirping note when touched." And (two) the
presence of an egg tooth on both mandibles, the upper one is of
the usual triangular shape, but unusually large while the lower
one takes the form of a flattened semi-circular nail. I am not
aware that an egg tooth on the lower jaw has been recorded in
any species of bird, but it is evidently not so uncommon among
Pigeons, as I found it present in the newly-hatched young of the
Brush Bronze-wing ( Phaps elegans ), but very much smaller, and,
to my surprise I could just detect it in two young Picui Doves
(&amp;apos;Columbzila picui), and in a young Diamond Dove fGeopelia

cuneala). I think we shall hear more about this later on, as I
have sent a two days old young Partridge Bronze-wing to
Mr. Pycraft, and he has promised to describe it to us. It would
be interesting if our members would examine any young doves
or pigeons that they may have hatched and report if they find it
present; I think the young of Columba and Turtur have no trace
of it.
To return to the history of the young one hatched on May
23rd, I was away the end of May and beginning of June, but was
told the young one was first noticed out of the nest on June 4th,
when it would be about twelve days old. It could run quite fast,
as I am informed it gave much trouble to catch in order to be
replaced in the nest at night, it was always out again in the
morning. I have no notes of the early stages of this bird, but
later ones will supplement those 011 the second young one, so I
will give them later on. O11 June 7th and 9th the old birds laid
again in the same nest, from which the first young had only run,
I can't say flown, two or three days before. During incubation
the eldest young one would sometimes sit by its sitting parent.
On June 26th another young one was hatched. Duration of in-
cubation seventeen days. On June 30th its eyes were opening
and feathers beginning to sprout, body sparingly covered with
fawn coloured down. (A young pigeon a few days old does not
seem nearly so well clothed as at birth, owing to the growth of
the body, the down also fades). July 5th it first left the nest,
being nine days old. I found it about a yard away; its wings,
top of head, crop and back were now fairly fledged. I put it
back in the nest. On July 7th the young one did not stay in the
nest any more, but ran about quite actively after its parents,
wings well fledged and a band of feathers along top of head,
which were raised when the bird ran, sides of upper surface of
head bare. The white face markings just beginning to show in
quill feathers on each side of ear. It was about the size of a
Picui Dove, ran quite fast, it recognised its parents at some
distance off, ran to them, uttering a sort of chirping whistle, and
nestled under the old bird like a chick. July 9th the white
feathers on face coming. July 10th, saw old bird feed young for
first time, then they went to the end of the flight, and I was

surprised to see the old bird feed both the young ones at once.
No. 1 being then nearly seven weeks old. As this seems to be a
rather interesting fact, I may mention that on all the occasions
when I saw the younger one fed, the elder one always had its
share; the last time I noticed this being on July 29th. No. 1
then being between nine and ten weeks old and hardly inferior
to its parents in size. I cannot say too much for the remarkable
amiability of this species, most Pigeons cast off the first brood as
soon as a second one arrives. I have even seen young badly
pecked by their parents, but the "Partridges" seem to live on
perfectly friendly terms with the young of any number of broods.
At the time of writing (24. 8. 08) the parents seem perfectly
friendly with both the two first young, though there are two
younger ones which have just left the nest, all six roosting in a
group together.

FRANCOLIN.
Fi&amp;apos;ancolinns vulgaris.
I am told that the hens of this species are very seldom
imported. The cocks, I believe, very often pass as " painted
Francolins."
A friend sent me several birds of both sexes from India
early last spring but only one pair survived. I placed this pair
in an open grass run (about 8yds. by 6yds.) partly planted with
broom, laurels, etc., and already occupied by three Amherst
Pheasants and one Rock Partridge.
The Francolins very soon settled down and fed fearlessly
on meal, corn, or almost anything that was given to the
pheasants. The cock Francolin during April and May was
incessant, morning and evening, with his repeated cry " Kek-i-
kek-i-kek" always stopping in his walk and throwing his head
back and opening his bill very wide when making his note, as
though his voice were several sizes too large for him. It is a
question to my mind whether this bird may not have been used
in India as a call-bird.

344 Notes on Breeding the Commofi Black Francolin.
I did not expect the birds to breed and the first signs we
had of pairing were about the end of May when my man
remarked with amusement (pointing to the Amherst cock, rather
a fierce old bird) "That little chap do run him about." It was
quite true. The fierce little Francolin had turned the Amherst
into a regular coward and made him live in a state of terror.
On the nth June the first Francolin egg was laid, the nest
being merely a hollow lined with dead grass under a laurel
bush--indeed it was an old nest of the Amherst Pheasants. The
egg was stone coloured and pointed at the smaller end. Three
more eggs were laid at intervals of two days and then, as the
Francolin ceased laying and appeared to have no desire to sit,
the four eggs were put under a reliable bantam on the 20th June.
One chick appeared on the 9th July and was left in the nest until
the following morning when all the other eggs were found
hatched.
The four chicks Were fed on hard boiled eggs, Armitage's
Alpha Pheasant Food, chopped lettuce, fresh ants' eggs, and as
many live earwigs, beetles, etc., as could be obtained.
The bantam and chicks were placed on short turf in a
coop, with little run attached, and constantly moved on to fresh
ground.
The chicks were very lively in movement from the first,
dashing about after beetles, etc., with great rapidity and always
seeming 011 the alert. They all made a curious little chirping
sound hardly to be distinguished from that of a cricket. They
grew rapidly and their feathers came well.
Within a fortnight the chicks took seeds freely though
showing a strong preference for living insects and lettuce. I then
turned them with the hen into a small grass run where they had
plenty of room to search for insects, etc., amongst the tufts of
grass.
When hatched the down of the chicks was brown and all
had a brown (almost black) line along the top of the head from
the bill to the back of the neck.
By the beginning of August the chicks had got feathered
except on their heads--the feathers being brown with black
bands and gradually growing darker with age except on the

breast where they grew lighter. Three out of the four chicks at
this time showed a good deal of white on the wiug feathers--the
chick that was first hatched was not showing any white. I am
afraid that three at least of the chicks will prove to be cocks.
About the middle of August the birds were put into a still
larger grass run, the insect food gradually discontinued and the
bantam hen removed.
I am well aware that my method of rearing is "ama-
teurish," and might be greatly improved, but when I look at the
four little Fraucolins in perfect health I am tempted to say with
the gentleman in the play " I may be an ass, but I am not a
silly ass."
In conclusion I may mention that all my aviaries are on
dry gravel soil which for almost all game birds is a great advantage.

RAIL.
Aramides ypecaha.
By Gerard H. Gurney, F.Z.S.
In June, 1907, I received a pair of Ypecaha Rails
(Ar amides ypecaha] which had recently came from Brazil, and
which I put into a large outdoor aviary, where they have been
ever since, standing the cold of last winter remarkably well.
At the beginning of June this year, 190S, my man noticed
the commencement of a nest, which I at once thought must
have been made by the Rails. It was built in the middle of a
gooseberry bush, about two feet from the ground, and looked
very much like a Dove's nest, being made of thin sticks, one or
two leaves, and some bits of grass being put inside by way of a
lining. It was completed by about June 16th.
The first egg was laid on June 18th, the second on the 19th,
and by June 22nd all four eggs were laid ; they are about the
size of an ordinary Coot's egg, and in colour like a Corncrake's,
but handsomer, with beautiful pinkish spots and markings. I
was away from home all the time the old birds were sitting, so do

not know what took place, but my man tells me both birds were
exceptionally shy and retiring during this time, and seldom
showed themselves ; on July 4th, on looking into the nest, he
found one of the eggs was on the point of hatching, the egg was
chipped and he could hear the young bird cheeping inside it ;
three of the eggs hatched and the fourth was rotten ; apparently
two of the eggs hatched a little time before the third, as on July
6tli, on going into the cage, two young Rails, evidently a day or
two old, were found lying dead under a tree at the far end of the
aviary, and the third, and only living one, lying just hatched in
the nest, and it looks to me as though the two young birds which
had hatched first, had got out of the nest and perished, probably
from want of attention. The little Rails when first hatched very
much resemble a baby Water hen, and are covered with black
down on the body, the head and neck being quite light brown
colour, legs and beak black.
I was again away from home for a week or two after they
had hatched and on returning found the young Rail had grown
into a very fine strong young bird, with feathers beginning to
show all over it, and the commencement of a funuv little stumpy
tail which it was always jerking about when it walked ; it still
appeared to be black all over and its legs looked very long and
out of proportion to the rest of its body ; now, on August
16th, it is full grown and beginning to look quite olive green
on the back ; it is tamer than the old birds ; does not slink
into cover directly one approaches, and is very fond of wading
about the little water pool in the aviary and probing in the grass
with its bill : if alarmed it will run behind a stump, looking out
first from one side and then from the other, generally standing on
one leg. Its parents seem to pay it no attention at all and keep
quite to themselves, and the young Rail generally seems to prefer
the company of a Knot and an Australian Plover, and on one
occasion I saw it feeding, very complacently, out of the same
dish as a Himalayan Jay was pecking from.
I shall be very glad to hear if any one knows whether the
Ypecaha Rail has been bred before in captivity.

On the whole, perhaps, the average Australian displays
even more ignorance of the habits of the birds of his country
than does his brother in the Mother-land. He knows, for
instance, that the White-eyes ( Zosterops ) which are at times
very numerous in his orchards, occasionally help themselves to
his fruit, especially his figs, and he proceeds to kill every one he
can, forgetting that at most times of the 3 ? ear these little birds
feed entirely upon insects and rid his trees of enormous quanti-
ties of these pests. In the little book before us Mr. Robert
Hall, one of the foremost of Australian Ornithologists, has
endeavoured to point out to his fellow countrymen the good
points as well as the bad, in the birds which are met with in
Southern Australia ; and with the aid of this useful handbook all
ignorance on the subject should be dispelled. The book is
interesting and instructive, and is well illustrated.

Sir,--I n the last number of our Magazine there is a paper on British
Rails by Mr. P. W. Farmborough, in which he treats of " the Water Rails."
I cannot help thinking that in using this name, he does soin a plueric sense
for most of his remarks seem to me entirely applicable to the Moorhen
(Gallinula chloropus) and not to the Water Rail {Rallus aquaticus) at all. If
this is so it is a pity, I think, that it is not made clear in the paper.
My special reason for drawing attention to the matter in the writer's
remarks on p. 304 where he says that on July iStli he saw two or more
(and in one instance 110 less than seven Water Rails) in nearly every field in
the immediate proximity of water, while 011 a railway journey through
Kent. Now if these birds were the common Moorhen, there is nothing
remarkable about it, and it is so utterly unlike the skulking habits of the
Water Rail to wander about in even two's and three's in open fields by the
side of a railway that I cannot but think that Mr. Farmborough's Water

I should like to think that the Water Rail was really as common in
Kent in summer as his remarks would lead one to believe, for if so, it must
breed there, conclusive evidence of which I have been seeking in vain for
years. N. F. TiCEHURST.

Mr. Henry ScherrEn writes:--"Looking over some old Reports
of the Zoological Society, I came on the entry of Artamus superciliosus,
among birds bred at the Gardens in 1870." Later he writes : " I was at
Hanover Square to-day and Miss Schneider kindly looked over the death
book. They were hatched on July 2nd, 1870; one lived until August 5th,
1870, the other we could not trace. It may have escaped or been exchanged
or given away."

In 1906 a female Heck's Curassow (Crax hecki) paired with male
Globose (C. globicera .), nested and hatched one young bird in the large flying
aviary opposite the Eastern Aviary. This unfortunately was not reared.
For some reason the birds were left in the Plastern Aviary the following
vear, where they had 110 chance of nesting.
This year the pair was put into the Pheasantry 011 the North bank,
where the hen hatched out two chicks about the middle of August, which
so far are doing very well, the nest having been built in the shelter at the
back of the aviary. For the first few days the young birds took their food
from the bill of their parent, though they very soon learned to pick for
tlieinselves. We hope to publish a full account next month.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.868114625" page_id="32669338"  page_num="Page 348" year="" vol="">
Medals have been awarded to Mr. C. Barn by Smith and
Mrs. C. H. Williams for having successfully reared young of the
Partridge Tinamou (Nothoprocta perdicariaj and the Brown-
throated Conure (Comums ceruginosus&amp;apos;) respectively. The Com-
mittee much regret that they cannot present a medal also to Mr.
Brook for breeding the White-eyebrowed Wood-Swallow, this
species having been successfully bred in the London Zoo in 1870.
