1901-1902.
It is with much pleasure that we complete our eighth
Annual Volume of the Avicultural Magazine, and present our
Report to the Members of the Society.
The year bore a gloomy outlook at its commencement,
owing to the number of Members who sent in their resignations
-- for whom we have every respect -- and to a not inconsiderable
number who " overlooked " to send in theirs and allowed their
names to remain on the Books of the Society, to whom
reference was made at page 240. But the cloud has passed away,
the outlook has brightened and continues to grow brighter, and
we are able to present to our Members a Volume which we think
beats all its predecessors both in quality and quantity. And the
List of bond fide Members which will appear in our next issue,
and which will be corrected up to the time of going to press,
will speak for itself.
Thanks to the energy and enterprise of Mr. Seth-Smith,
our Honorary Editor, not less than one illustration has been
published in our Magazine every month ; and we have not
stopped short by confining our energies to the present, but have
already several coloured illustrations in hand for Vol. IX.;
and it will be our endeavour with Vol. IX. to make a steady
improvement 011 Vol. VIII.
Next to the illustrations and the increase of the
letterpress, an important feature in our issues commencing with
December has been Mr. Ginn's monthly Post Mortem Report.
His kind assistance has rendered valuable aid to our Members,
and is much appreciated.
Another very noticeable feature of the year has been the
largely increased sale of the Society's Magazine to the general
public. To this we are greatly indebted to the energy of our
publisher, Mr. Porter. On the other hand, we feel that if the
Magazine were not of value it would not be purchased, -- and
therefore that our aim should be to maintain the Magazine
at its present high standard, and, as far as practicable, to improve
upon it.

Report of the Council.
The finances of the Society are in a sound state. Not-
withstanding the heavy outlays on the Coloured Plates, we have
no reason for supposing that there will be a deficit when the
accounts are closed for the year. In any event, we cannot too
strongly urge upon our Members the importance of increasing
our Membership, so that, with au increased income, we may be
enabled to still further improve our Magazine.
We most cordially thank the large body of our Members
who have so faithfully supported us through all our difficulties,
and the growing number who have contributed to our pages.
Highly satisfactory, however, as that number has been, there are
many members who could contribute most valuable articles, but
whose pens unhappily have been at rest so far as our Magazine
is concerned.
We earnestly invite all our Members to assist us by
sending in their subscriptions before Christmas. By so doing,
the}' will be rendering material help, for they will greatly lighten
the never-ceasing burden that hampers our Hon. Secretary, and
set him free for more important work. During the past year,
quite a substantial number of valuable letters never reached the
hands of our Hon. Editor owing to sheer inability on the part of
the Hon. Secretary to find time to put them in order for
publication.
We gratefully thank those who have helped us with
illustrations. We ask specially for assistance with suitable bird-
subjects. In this connection, we are particularly indebted to
the Rev. Hubert 1). Astley, who, notwithstanding serious
indisposition, has painted two illustrations for us, one of which
has already appeared, the second being in hand.
The help rendered by the Officers of the Society and
Members of the Executive we most gratefully acknowledge.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9716064" page_id="10104005"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
The Medal is awarded to ever}' member who succeeds in breeding any
species of bird which has not previously been known to breed in captivity
in the United Kingdom. Any member wishing to obtain the Medal must
send a detailed account to the Secretary, for publication in the Magazine,
within ten weeks from the date of hatching of the young, and furnish
such evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may requre.
The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to
be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their
parents. The decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal is struck in bronze, and measures 2J inches in diameter.
It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing
eggs, and the words "The Avicultural Society--Founded 1S94." O11 the
reverse is the following inscription: "Awarded to (name of donee) for
rearing young of (name of species) a species not previously bred in captivity
in the United Kingdom.

The Rules under which the Society's Medal has hitherto been
granted are under consideration and possible revision. By no Society of
repute that we are acquainted with are Medals distributed so lightly as our
Medal has been in the past; and Medals that are lightly distributed may
come to be lightly esteemed. Nevertheless the original idea in awarding
the Medal--that of encouraging aviculture--must not be lost sight of. We
hope to be able to print the amended Rules in our next issue.
Under the Rules which have been in force up to the end of the
avicultural year just closed, the members whose names are given below
have reared the young of species which it is believed have not been
previously reared in this country. Members and others are invited to
examine the list, and are requested to immediately communicate with the
Secretary should they be aware of any earlier instance of the rearing of the
young of any of the species mentioned. The account of the breeding of
each species may be found at the page indicated. These are in addition to
those to whom the medal has already been awarded this year.

POST MORTEM EXAMINATIONS.

<bodyText confidence="0.9967165" page_id="10104006"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
For a long time the Society has felt the want of some competent
person willing to undertake the examination of dead birds, who would
report through our columns, for the general good, the causes of the deaths
of our feathered friends. Many unsuspected errors in our mode of dealing
with our birds are occasionally brought to light by post mortem examin-
ations, and consequently the lives of the survivors saved and prolonged,
other readers likewise profiting by the warnings disclosed.
It is, therefore, with sincere pleasure that we are enabled to announce
to our members (for the privilege is reserved to members of the Avicultural
Society) that Mr. Arthur Giee, a member of our Council, has most
kindly offered to step into the breach, and, without fee, make the desired
examinations. Our cordial thanks are due to Mr. Gill for this valuable
assistance.
RULES.
Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, care-
fully packed and postage paid, direct to Mr. Gill (Veterinary Establishment,
Bexley Heath, Kent), and must be accompanied by a letter containing the
fullest particulars of the case.
If a reply by post (in addition to any Report that may appear in the
Magazine) be required, a stamped and addressed envelope must likewise be
forwarded to Mr. Gill.
* In these two cases, Medals cannot be awarded unless detailed accounts of the
breeding 1 are duly furnished for publication in our Magazine. Mr. Gedney states that the
young of the Orange-cheeked Waxbill have been reared by his Zebra Finches, to whose
nest the eggs had been transferred; and other cases may perhaps be known to some of our
members.

AUSTRALIAN CRANES NESTING IN ENGLAND.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99693421875" page_id="10104007"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. Hubert D. Asteey, M.A., F.Z.S.
In the year 1852 the splendid Native Companion Crane of
Australia, the only species of the Crane family in the whole of
that huge continent, was imported into Europe, and since 1857
with regularity. All the principal European zoological societies
have kept these birds from that time up till the present, but
never, until this year, have any of them been known to make
a serious attempt to breed. Mr. Blaauw, in his beautiful
" Monograph of the Cranes," states this to be the case, and Mr.
Tegetmeier confirms it. The late Eord Eilford and other
enthusiastic ornithologists and bird-lovers have kept Australian
Cranes in private collections under most favourable circum-
stances, and yet they have failed to obtain even the partial
success which I have been fortunate enough to achieve this
summer.
Mr. Blaauw mentions the fact that an egg was laid in the
Zoological Gardens of Amsterdam, but adds that he knows of no
instance of this species of Crane having bred in captivity. By
this I suppose he means that no eggs have been hatched, and
also that none of these Cranes have truly nested. The pair of
Australian Cranes that I have, were purchased in 1897, but not
until this year have they ever attempted to nest. They live in a
part of the park immediately in front of the house, and spend
most of their time at the edge of the lake, a piece of water of
about 8 acres. They seldom wander to any distance, and, indeed,
seem to have marked out a boundary, beyond which they seldom
or never pass ; nor will they allow the other Cranes (Manchurian,
Siberian, and European) to enter their claimed domain. The
male Australian is pinioned, but the female has her full wings,
although she does not often make use of them in flight. They
are magnificent birds, in colour a fine bright grey, which is
enhanced by the brilliant scarlet skin 011 the back of the head.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999252" page_id="10104008"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
The)&amp;apos;do not stand as high as the stately Manchurian Cranes, nor,
again, as the Sarus Crane of India, but they are not far off those
species in size, and are taller than the common Crane, a bird of
no mean stature.
In May last the Australians showed evident signs of an
intention to breed, and began to build a nest on the immediate
margin of the lake, composed of dead rushes and a few sticks.
Bnt the situation did not please them, and they built a second
nest a few yards farther along, under the overhanging boughs of
a large beech tree, but again close to the water's edge, though in
a less damp spot. The female bird took short flights of a morning
when her mate was courting her, and it was a fine sight as the
great bird flapped her broad pinions and flew on a level with the
tops of the tallest trees, her image reflected in the lake as she
passed over it. Towards the end of May she laid her two eggs,
the usual complement of all Cranes ; but her possession of them
was short, for one was very soon stolen (a Great Black-backed
Gull was the supposed thief), and the other, in consecpience of
the theft, was removed, to be incubated by a farmyard hen, who,
however, failed to hatch it. Bnt in eight days' time the Crane
laid the first of a second batch of eggs in the same nest as
before, omitting, as she had previously done, one day between
the production of the first and second egg. On this second
clutch she sat steadily for ten days, the male bird in the mean-
while attacking with much fury any human passer-by, and
following people for some distance until he saw them safely off
the premises. Then, for the second time, the eggs were taken,
both disappearing simultaneously. This time suspicion rested
upon the Jackdaws ; or it may have been a pair of Herring-gulls,
which had till then appeared perfectly innocent of contem-
plating such destruction. The Great Black-backed Gull had
been removed ; in fact, found guilty and imprisoned.
In any case, I discovered the skin of one of the eggs in the
water of the lake. The loss was all the more aggravating, inas-
much as the skin was covered with veins, showing that the eggs
were fertile, and that young birds were forming in the shells.
Two sets of eggs having been laid, I gave tip all idea of any more
until next spring, when, to my astonishment, some ten days
after, the female bird once more took up her position on the same
nest, which she added to slightly and rearranged. In a fortnight
from the disappearance of the second clutch, the first egg of a
third one was laid, which was again followed by another egg two
days afterwards.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.997392413043479" page_id="10104009"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
But, alas, and alas ! after the Crane had sat only a few days,
the eggs once more were taken. War had been waged against
Jackdaws and Rooks, which had stolen a lot of eggs laid by
different species of ducks, but yet either Jackdaws or Rooks were
the thieves on this occasion, for the shells of the two eggs were
found dropped in the grass, at some distance from the nest,
sucked clean, except for a few veins on the skin within the shell,
and with tell-tale upon the latter of the blows made by the points
of the culprits' bills before they effected their object, and finally
gained an entrance to the contents. Surely that was the end of all
things for the first year of the twentieth century ! But in August,
about a fortnight after this last calamity, the female Australian
Crane was once more to be seen rearranging her nest, and sitting
on it. And once more this pertinaceous and prolific bird laid,
for the fourth time of asking, two eggs, quite as fine and large,
moreover, as any of their predecessors, if not more so.
The eggs are about the size of those of a Goose, of a
creamy colour, spotted and blotched, chiefly at the thicker end,
with dull red and grey. Then I hired boys to watch near by
from early morn to dewy eve, and for ten days all went well,
except that the female bird seemed to sit less steadily than
hitherto. On the tenth day came the news that the eggs had
both disappeared between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m.! Culprits this time
either rats or Jackdaws, the suspicion resting upon the former;
but not the vestige of a shell was discovered. I felt as sorry for
the poor Cranes as I did for myself, and they evinced their dis-
appointment by standing over the nest and loudly trumpeting at
intervals. Mr. Tegetmeier wrote in the Field of July 20th. last
as follows : "A series of very interesting announcements
respecting the nesting of the Australian Crane (Grus australasiana )
has appeared in the Field during the last few weeks. In the
number for June 1st. the Rev. Hubert D. Astley made the
important announcement that his Australian Cranes, known as
the Native Companion of the Colonists, had nested. . . . This is,
I believe, the first example of this species laying in Europe. . . .
It is not only of interest to record the breeding of the
Australian Crane for the first time in the Northern Hemisphere,
but it is also of considerable physiological import to be able to
record the rapid production of eggs in a creature that, had she
not been molested, would have laid only one pair during the
year."

October 5th. last, and is reprinted by permission, and the illustration which
appears as our frontispiece this month was drawn by Mr. Frohawk from a

AVICULTURE.
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
There is a distinct charm in aviculture. It can be carried
on anywhere : in a back slum in S. Giles', in a Belgravian
mansion, in a country vicarage, or in a suburban villa--and you
will always enjoy yourself; and what is more important about
this enjoyment is this, that you will not embitter your present,
nor endanger your future, by getting into a bad temper, whether
you are successful or not, provided always that you are a true
bird-lover.
This, notoriously, is not the case with othei- sports. I
have been assured by an experienced man that it makes you feel
"awfully bad" when, after a long and weary tramp over the
fallows, you at last get a wretched chance at a wild covey-- and
miss; and as for football, hockey, cricket, fishing, and golf, I
need hardly speak of the uncharitable feelings they engender
towards umpires and successful opponents !
When I first went in for birds, I knew no more about them
than does a Kindergarten Board School child about South Africa.
I did not mention the fact, by the way, and a casual observer
might have thought that I had spent my youth in aviculture.
The birds " that caused me to fall " were a pair of Zebra Finches
in a bird dealer's window. These birds have much to answer for.
They cost me seven shillings and sixpence ; but how many seven
and sixes have followed that first one I should tremble to say 7 . I
luxuriated in their exquisite beauty; little thinking or knowing
what there was besides beauty, as Allah in mercy hid the Book
of Fate.
Who would have dared to prophesy that one pair of
Zebra Finches would one day^ necessitate the erection of twelve
huge aviaries !
I know of no more charming way of spending an afternoon
than to sit down quietly and watch the ways of the bird world
around y : ou. If you keep quiet, the birds take no notice of you
and go on with their ordinary avocations, under your eyes,
hunting and playing and feeding and fighting--for sad to relate,
in spite of good Dr. Watts, birds in their little nests do not
agree, nor out of them either, for that matter--until something
frightens them, and then there is a general stampede, a sort of
" general post."
It does some people good to go and see another man's
birds ; it does another a lot of harm. It raises feelings of

kleptomania ; lie will go to a neighbour's aviary, without any
intention of coveting, and you will see him go home full of envy
hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness. Do not imagine,
sister or brother aviculturist, that I am hinting that the gentle
art is bad for the moral nature of people like you and me, but it
is bad for some people.
You or your neighbour, like most of us, can resist any
thing but temptation ; he will resist attempts to reform him,
attempts to make him tell the truth, attempts to keep him tidy ;
he will resist them painfully. But give him a real temptation,
breed something that he can't or hasn't bred, and he will
succumb without a struggle !
From time to time I think that all aviculturists, living
within visiting distance, ought to go and see their brother avi-
culturists; outlie same principle as led a gloomy government
official on the Gold Coast to visit the local cemetery, because,
as he said, he wanted to get used to the place before staying there
permanently. He used to take his visitor across the well kept
grass to the newly dug graves, each covered with a wooden hood,
in a most business like way. He said nothing, but waved his
hand with a take-your-choice, they-are-both-quite-ready style.
" We have to bring them here very quickly you know." Well, I
always feel like that when I go to see a friend's aviary. I always
want to go and see the cemetery. You always find people deny-
ing having any deaths, if they can, without committing violent
perjury; if they cannot deny it, they will try and turn the
conversation.
Some enthusiastic friends, when they come to see me,
always want to see the " pretty nests." I sternly refuse to
gratify what is, no doubt, quite " natural curiosity." I know
we are told that birds don't mind it. Mine do ; and so we must
diminish dead certainties to the level of sporting chances, or
one would never get on.
I should say that, on the whole and unless very severely
tried, aviculturists are a truthful set of men. I will give you an
example. I once, in visiting a friend's aviary, found a nest which
he said he did not blow of: demonstrating that an aviculturist
can speak the truth !
Another pleasing trait in my brother aviculturists I find to
be that, if there is danger ahead, they wish that I should take
first risks. If some particularly delicate and, as a consequence,
expensive birds arrive, I have a friend who always strongly
advises that I should have them. Much as I once read one

late Miss Kingsley's black fellows did when entering on a
dangerous path ; he always urged that she should go up the
road--alone--by herself--first--a mile ahead of the part}&amp;apos;, and
the next time, perhaps, the enemy might not shoot at sight if
they happened to notice that she was something queer, and that
she might explain things, and then the rest of the party would
follow ! !
I have often acted that suggested part in bird-dom! I
suppose that some day the avicultural enthusiast will meet with
the sad fate of the pitcher that went too oft to the well; he will
get "stony broke."
My ignorance in birds is still colossal ; and although the
vast cavity in my mind is only as yet very partially filled up, it
nevertheless contains a great deal of curious information. I say
curious, advisedly; for many books on birds seem to suggest
that, over the minds of all young beginners, a placard has been
set up with a sort of advertisement to this effect : " Rubbish
may be shot here." On that suggestion they had all apparently
acted.
I found in these books statements made which subsequent
experience has completely falsified ; and, concerning some of
the marvellous accounts of nesting and reproduction therein
recorded, I hold the opinion that the old Scotch lady had regard-
ing certain passages in the history of the early Jews--that "it
was a long time ago, and habelings it was not true."
Sometimes, you know, a man will say to you, "I've done
so and so." Its a bit too large for my belief hatch, but, if you
like to get it down yours, you're free and welcome to ship it.
I sha'n't do that. Mine is a record of actual experience,
often bitter and costly; but, such as it is, I humbly lay it before
the reader; and if you ever go to what Aristophanes calls the
" kingdom of birds," you will find things to be as I have
said. I am anxious to make a book that people who do not
know much about birds may believe, even if they criticise its
points, so I give details that a more showy writer would omit.
Aviculture is like the Arctic regions in one particular,
that when you have once visited those regions, you want to
go back there again. I know there are some who deny this ;
but if you were to tell many of those who will, in a fit of the
blues, tell you most emphatically that, if they could " sell out all
those beastly birds, see if ever they would go in for them
again " ; and you were to take them at their word, and buy them
out--you would find them some fine day, in the not far distant

future, sneaking back apologetically to their old love. Brevi
spatio interjecto , as Caesar used to say in the middle of a bad
battle. I said to a friend once, after a bad loss, " Now if you
want some cheap birds, this is your opportunity." He smiled
derisively.; and, when he came the following week and found me
hard at it, he pretended a genuine surprise, but no doubt formed
an even higher opinion of my folly than he had before, which is
saying a good deal.
And now, as the parsons say, one word in conclusion.
Whatever aviculture may have to say against me--for my con-
tinual and unalterable desire for something new ; my intolerable
habit of getting into hot water; or of bringing things into the
house which emit unexpectedly and at short notice varied and
awful stenches--she cannot say but that I have been a diligent
pupil, who has honestly tried to learn the lessons she had tried
to teach me ; though some of the lessons have been very costly.
One by one I lost my old ideas derived from books,
weighed them against the real bird life I saw around me, and,
finding them either worthless or wanting, did metaphorically
what the Ephesians did of old with their books, "burnt them
publicly before all men; " and I can truthfully say to-day
that what little I know about birds, I have learnt from the birds
themselves--they have been my teachers.
Those who have loved birds in life will, I fancy, find the
ruling passion strong in death. Who does not remember the
pathetic tale of the old carter, who lay a-dying. Kindly hands
had smoothed his pillow, tender hands had wiped the death
sweat from his brow; was there anything else that he would like
to have done? There was a wistful pathos in his voice as
he gasped his yearning to "just see t'osses once again."
Immediately his bed was moved quietly towards the window,
and from stable and pasture all the horses were driven into the
farmyard, until the dying man's eyes rested on the old mare he
loved the best. Then, with a faint "Tchk, tchk ! Daisy ! " he
turned away his head and burst into tears. And so he died.
But when the hearse came to bear him away to the little God's
Acre, the dead man's mistress had the undertaker's horse taken
out of the shafts, and Daisy put in to take him to his last resting
place.
Will it not be so with some of us when the end draws
near? We, too, shall want "one last look at the birds," those
feathered treasures we have loved so well -- one last look -- until
we wake up in the Better Land.

PITTAS IN CAPTIVITY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995904085714285" page_id="10104014"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. Hubert D. Astley, M.A., F.Z.S.
I have been fortunate enough to secure a hand-reared
brood of four Pittas (P. bengalensis) which were brought from
India, and landed on the 19th of September in the London
Docks.
They seem strong and healthy, and feed well upon an
insectivorous mixture (Insectivorous Food Co.) and mealworms.
They have also enjoyed ' daddy-long-legs ' whilst in season,
which are easily caught of a morning on the outside of window
sills, etc.
Gould figures and describes these birds (' Birds of Asia,'
Yol. V.) as having black bills with fleshy brown bases, whereas
my birds have almost entirely red bills with a dash of brown on
them, which latter colour has the appearance of fading away
into red: the brown tint seemingly being a feature of the
immature bird.
My Pittas are moulting, the lighter fawn of the breast
appearing through the dull brown of the first plumage. The
whole colouring is the same as in the adult bird (as figured in
Gould's ' Birds of Asia,') except that it is altogether duller.
It will be most interesting to see whether these birds will
live well in captivity, and whether it would be possible to breed
them in an aviary given up to them only.
They are brought over alive only very rarely. For the
\0x25A0edification of those who are not familiar with the characteristics
of this most beautiful family of birds, I would add that in size
and shape they are mostly about that of our Water Ouzel (or
Dipper) with the same short bobbing tail.
The Pittas are all bright and, for the most part, gorgeously
coloured birds. The Bengal Pitta has broad longitudinal stripes
of dark brown and white on the whole head and face; the back,
green ; the wings, black with two large patches of white on the
primaries; shoulders, pale blue; throat, white; breast, fawn
colour ; under tail coverts and bell}', scarlet; upper tail coverts,
sky blue ; tail, black at base, blue at the tip. The legs are flesh-

coloured, long and slender, as these birds live chiefly on the
ground, where the}' move with great activity, taking long hops.
My birds are extremely tame and fearless, and also very
pugnacious, tilting and sparring at one another like game cocks,
so that in all probability one pair of Pittas in a wild state, would
demand a fairly large area to themselves for the purposes of
nesting.
A pair of Pittas were exhibited at the Crystal Palace Bird
Show a few years ago, which, if I remember rightly, were the
Hooded Pitta (P. cucullaiaj .
The Pittas known as Elliot's, Gurney's, Bornean, Neck-
laced, etc., are dreams of beauty, and make one's mouth water to
possess them alive as pets, when looking on their coloured
portraits.

Having undertaken to edit the Avicultural Magazine, may
I ask all our members to help me by sending something for
publication therein. We have not had much about British birds
lately, and I should be very glad if our members would record
the result of their observation of anything of interest concerning
our native species.
I should also be glad to receive accounts of the breeding
results of the past season in the aviaries of members.
Descriptions of members' aviaries are always welcome and
I should like to receive photographs of birds with a view to

BIRD NOTES.
Some discussion has recently taken place in the daily Press as to the
damage wrought by birds on fruit. The remedies suggested are many and
various, but the concensus of opinion seems to be that the only adequate
means of protection to bush- and ground-fruit is to thoroughly net it over.
We have often been told that the birds eat the fruit because they require
moisture, and if dishes of water be placed about the garden the fruit will not
be touched. This theory is, however, exploded by a writer to the Standard,
who had most of his fruit taken by the birds although a stream of the
purest water ran through his garden.
Such fruit as pears and apples is most difficult to protect from
the ravages of Tits, who peck holes in it close to the stem, when the
</bodyText>

io
rain and insects get in and it is mined. We have known whole trees of
choice fruit spoiled in this way, and growers certainly have just cause for
complaint. Valuable pears can be protected by means of discs of cardboard
about two inches in diameter, with a hole in the centre for the stalk, and a
slit, by means of which it can be fixed on with little trouble.
Probably some of the commoner species of fruit-eating birds are too
numerous in certain districts, and need thinning down ; but we would
prefer to leave Nature to deal with them, as she most effectually does when
she sends us a prolonged frost.
The case of the House Sparrow is, however, different: and there is
no doubt whatever that it is far too numerous in almost every part of the
land. We have most of us seen abundant proof of the damage done to the
farmers' crops by this bird : the service it performs by&amp;apos; devouring the
insects being more than counterbalanced by the quantity of grain eaten.
It is also known to drive away more useful and ornamental species. Were
it reduced to one-tenth its present numbers the country would undoubtedly
benefit thereby.
The occurrence at the mouth of the Thames of five Avocets is of no
little interest, seeing how seldom the species is recorded nowadays in our
Islands. These were seen on August 16th, on Canvey Island, by a writer to
the Field, who mistook them for Oyster-catchers and shot one. We trust
the remaining four escaped unmolested.
There has recently been some discussion in the columns of the Field
as to the mode of progression, under water, of the Cormorant: some
-correspondents stating their belief that this species and its allies use their
wings to aid them in capturing their prey below the surface. There seems,
however, to be no doubt that this is a mistaken notion, the large wings of
the Cormorants being adapted only for aerial transit, aud quite unsuitable
for movement under water, in which position they are kept tightly folded.
A most interesting letter appears in the Field of October 5th, from
our esteemed member, the Rev. Hubert I). Astley, on the subject of " White
Storks Remaining in England." Mr. Astley has for many years been in the
habit of purchasing young storks from Holland in the early summer, and
allowing them full liberty at Benliam Park and Chequers Court. They have
always remained in the neighbourhood (coming daily to be fed in front of the
house) until the natural migration season arrived, when they have, in former
years, invariably taken their departure. This year, however, Mr. Astley had
two adult Storks, one (the female) pinioned, and the other, which rarely left its
companion, with full wings. These seem to have acted as decoys to the
young ones, which, up to the time of writing, had not left, although in
former years the date of departure has never been later than August 15th.
It is to be sincerely hoped that they will now remain and withstand the
rigours of the winter, and that Mr. Astley may, in due course, realise his
long-dreamt-of pleasure of seeing storks on the house-tops in England on
their nests."

We have received a copy of a small monthly called " Foreign Bird
Notes." It is issued by a new Society calling itself the Foreign Bird Club,
and contains several papers relating to the keeping and breeding of foreign
birds in captivity. The Editor is Mr. H. R. Fillmer, the originator and
founder of the Avicultural Society. We must all regret that Mr. Fillmer
has seen fit to sever his connection with the Avicultural Society, and we
much doubt the wisdom of starting another bird paper, but we think that
perhaps his new cheap monthly may have tapped a new section of foreign
bird keepers, who require a popular and unscientific journal, and therefore
we hope the new venture will do good work in encouraging the keeping
of foreign birds.

NESTING OF VIRGINIAN CARDINALS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998078" page_id="10104017"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In reply to Miss Hawke--My Virginian Nightingales have
reared three fine young ones this season.
They share an aviary (24 ft. by 6 ft.) with pairs of Cockatiels, Zebra
Finches, Cutthroats, White-headed Nuns, Black-headed Gouldians, three
pairs Budgerigars, a Blue Robin, Liotlirix, Lavender Finch, and Bengalese.
I11 the early spring the Virginians wished to nest; but 110 nest we
coidd supply would satisfy the hen, and she eventually laid two eggs in a
seed tin : then we hung up a wire basket, stuffed it with hay, shaping a
hollow in the middle, and put in her eggs. She laid another egg in the
seed tin, which was just above the basket; we put it in the basket and
removed the tin ; she then put a few blades of fresh grass round the edge,
laid two more eggs, and sat steadil)&amp;apos; for twelve days, when three young ones
were hatched.
The food in the aviary is always canary- and millet-seed ; thin lunch
biscuit soaked in hot water, squeezed dry and mixed with Abrahams' yolk
of egg (two biscuits and about a dessertspoonful of egg); ants' eggs, cock-
roaches, scalded bread, and a few white oats. Mealworms we give as
required.
For the first few days the hen did the feeding; the cock brought the
food and was eager to try, but the hen took it from him and gave it to the
nestlings herself; later both birds fed them. The mealworms were bitten
up small at first, later they had their heads bitten off and were given whole.
Biscuit and egg were given, also green peas and banana, and I think a few
fresh ants' eggs and bits of cockroach ; but I never saw them give dried
ants' eggs. The cock often gave them soaked bread.
They feathered quickly, leaving the nest at the end of a fortnight.
The parents continued to feed them even after their second nest had
hatched, two of which died at the end of a fortnight; then we put the
first youngsters into another aviary.
The parents laid and hatched again (two) ; but they fell victims to
a hen Californian Ouail which, with nine chicks, we were obliged to put in
the Cardinals' aviary.

The Cardinals nested again and hatched three, but failed to rear
them, and, as the parents had begun to moult, we removed the cock. The
hen, however, laid four more eggs which we destroyed, and removed the nest.
She used the same nest all through ; we added a little more hay, and
she put in a few blades of grass. She sings beautifully and is very tame.
Both the parents would beg for mealworms. The young ones--two hens
and a cock--sing well, and are fine birds. BELLE Shepherd.

LINNET IN A DECLINE ; BREEDING GOLDFINCHES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997349108108108" page_id="10104018"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Will you kindly advise me how to treat a Linnet, which is
ailing. It has been in captivity three or four years, the last two in my
aviary; but during the last few weeks it has become very thin, and is
apparently suffering from a bad attack of indigestion. It has been fed on
best Spanish canarv-seed, red rape, and a little hemp occasionally ; with
plenty of groundsel, chickweed, and shepherd's purse. I cannot get it to
eat egg-food, or soaked biscuits, or the seed contained in thistle and dande-
lion heads, though I think these would be beneficial.
Yesterday, he w y as so reduced and weak that I gave him five grains of
Epsom salts in his drinking water, and he seems better for it; but he has a
difficulty in cracking seed, and eats very little else but crushed hemp. Can
you suggest any remedy that I can try ? He has fits of great restlessness,
when he seems to be seeking something. I would let him fly, but am afraid
he might not find food, as he has been in captivity so long.
Can you tell me whether it is possible to breed Goldfinches in an
aviary ? I have been told it has been done, and should be very glad of any
advice you can give me on the subject. Emily Brampton.
The following reply was sent to Miss Brampton :
I fear that your Linnet is in a decline ; and, if he will not eat soaked
biscuit, I hardly see how you can save him. Two or three drops daily of
Scott's Emulsion on biscuit might have done wonders for him.
If this were spring instead of autumn, I should think it quite safe to
let the bird go : I do not think he would find any difficulty about feeding
himself; but, with winter approaching, there would not be much chance
for him.
I have bred Goldfinches in an aviary. They nested in converted
Hartz cages (the pot, trough, and perch removed, the floor made solid with
a piece of cigar-box lid, two of the short bars removed and that end turned
forward for an entrance) hung upon two nails to prevent swinging.
The hen built the first nest, began to lay a day or two later, and began
to sit when four eggs were deposited ; she incubated thirteen days, hatched
and reared three young: but before the latter flew, the cock built a second
nest which she examined and slightly altered. She began to lay the follow-
ing day--six eggs I think, all of which hatched ; but both this family and a
third (of five) were killed by the young of the first brood.
I supplied egg and biscuit just the same as for Canary-breeding, and
gave plenty of groundsel. A. G. BUTLER.

Sir, --This year I have again to record the nesting of my Pennants,
and the successful rearing of a fine brood. The young were marked exactly
as all others have been (vide my articles in past numbers of the Magazine).
The old birds, as I also said, are quite good to tell apart by their tails. They
are, moreover, common or garden Pennants, and not half-bred Adelaides!
My Bloodvvings also nested as usual. They laid four eggs and hatched
three strong young ones. These lived for ten days; then one died and
poisoned the nest, and the parents would not feed the other two. When I
found them the} - were perfectly sweet and not in the least discoloured ; but
the other was like Solomon's love--black--but certainly not comely.
Better luck next time !
One never knows what to do in these cases. If you touch the nest
the old ones desert; if you leave a dead one in, the youngsters are allowed
to perish.
I hope next season, if we all live and are well, to be able to record
the breeding of several rare kinds of Parrakeets. C. D. Farrar.

Sir, -- I have a Mocking-bird suffering from a bad cough, and would
be much pleased to have advice. It troubles him in the day, but, curious
enough, he never seems to suffer at night. It is quite a dry cough, as if he
were choking and trying to get something up out of his throat. He feeds
well on soft food and fruit, but refuses all insect food since getting this cold.
He is fairly lively, but is getting a worn out look since getting this cold. I
have kept him in a dry room, between 6o* and 55 0 , but with no draughts.
So far as I can make out, he is Mimus thenca of Chili. He is a
much larger bird than the North American, with a distinct eyebrow
mark. I have also an Icte&amp;gt;us Hangnest, which was sold to me as the
Baltimore Oriole, but, on examination of skins, I should think it is Icterus
vulgaris. Is not this the one usually imported ? I examined a number in
London the other day, and they appeared to be vulgaris not jamacaii, as
mostly stated. I find the Irish climate very damp for foreign birds, more
especially in summer, when they are out. Very often in June we have wet
days at about 45^. I enclose a photograph of my aviary: the two lower
windows_sliow the heated compartments for birds; one for the seed-eaters,
the other for insectivorous species. H. B. RaThborne.
[We are much obliged to Mr. Rathborue for the photo, which gives
a very clear view of his aviary. -- E d.]
The following reply was sent to Mr. Rathborue :
The cough may be due either to a cold, or to indigestion. You do not
say what soft food you give your birds, and there are several worthless ones
on the market.
I think I have tried most of the foods offered to the public, and I
find the best to be that prepared by our member Mr. Fulljames (almost the
same as I prepare for my own birds). Some mixtures that are sold as food

for insectivorous birds appear to consist of nothing but broken grits aiul
lard, whereas oatmeal sometimes is one of the ingredients of a so-called
food.
An improperly nourished bird naturally is liable to any ailment, is
sensitive to cold and has no power to throw one off. You should try ten drops
of glycerine and a little gum arabic daily in the drinking-water for a week
or so and, if the breathing improves and the coughing abates, give a mild
tonic daily for another week -- say six drops of tincture of iron in the
drinking-water.
I think you are wrong about the Icterus being /. vulgaris. Few birds
are imported from Venezuelaaud Colombia but many from S. K. Brazil, and
I have no doubt that my bird (the common imported one) is /. jamacaii;
but the description of the bill in the Museum Catalogue is incorrect, as it is
dark slate colour with the basal half of the lower mandible whitish ; the
naked skin round the eye is pale blue and the iris pale clear primrose.

OUR SECRETARY AND TREASURER.
The grateful thanks of the Society are due to Mr. J. L. Bonhote, who,
for two years, has held the important and laborious posts of Secretary and
Treasurer of the Society.
Mr. Bonhote is leaving England for several months, on a scientific
expedition to the Bahamas we are told ; but we hope to welcome him back
amongst us next summer.
Mr. Phillipps takes up the post of Hon. Secretary, and Mr.
St. Quintin that of Hon. Treasurer.

By Rosie Aederson.
This aviary, which was built last spring, was at first
intended solely for Parrots and Parrakeets, but as yet I have only
a few kinds, so it has become the home of many Doves and small
birds as well.
I think it was after reading Dr. Greene's " Parrots in
Captivity," with its attractive coloured plates, that I first began
to wish to go in really for Parrakeets. Formerly I had a nervous
idea that the aim and object of a Parrot's life was to bite every-
body it came across, either with or without provocation. When
I purchased my first Parrot, a little Senegal, I do not know which
of us was the most frightened of the other, but it was not long
before we each found out our mistake and became the closest
friends, and I felt that to possess one Parrot was only to long
for more.
Having decided to realize my ambition and put up a Parrot
aviary, the first beginning was to find a site, and the next to
draw my plans and write for some estimates. I found a clear
space could be made in our old orchard, 32 ft. by 22 ft., the
longest side facing south. It is a pretty situation with a tiny
artificial streamlet running in front, and a picturesque old
spreading apple tree overshadowing the eastern end.
I made several plans, but, on the kindly advice of one of
our members, I discarded them, and adopted one something like
his own, with a few alterations and additions.
From my width of 22 ft. I cut off 6ft. (on the north side) to
form a passage running along the whole length of the aviary.
The remaining piece of ground, 32 ft. by 16 ft., I divided into
five divisions, each 16 ft. long by 6# ft. wide (the centre one
being slightly smaller). Each of these five compartments forms a
separate aviary to itself, and is divided into a shelter, glass

<bodyText confidence="0.999190581395349" page_id="10104024"  page_num="16" year="" vol="">
roofed portion, and open flight, and is entered by a separate
inner door of wood and wire.
From each end of the passage I cut off 6k ft., that at the
eastern end for a small seed-room, and at the western end for a
small extra aviary (each 6 ft. by 6# ft.) The latter has a window
at one end, and a wood and wire door (the remaining part of this
division being also wood and wire) opening into the passage.
The seed-room is fitted with shelves for numerous articles, with a
curtain hanging in front ; there is also a bin made with five
divisions for seed and brushes, rails for cloths, and everything
needed for keeping the aviary in order. Like the small extra
aviary it has a window at the end ; and an outer wooden door gives
entrance into the whole aviary. The seed-room is separated
from the passage by a wooden division, and a wood and wire
door. The passage is lighted by two windows, and has three
large store cages let out on its north side.
The idea of having the passage so arranged (with the seed
room at one end and the small aviary at the other) was that if
need be the passage could be used as an extra aviary, the seed-
room acting as a kind of double door, and so making the chance
of a bird escaping a very small one.
Of the five aviaries in front, all have inner doors of wood
and wire, the three centre ones opening into the passage, and the
two onter ones into the seed-room and small aviary.
The shelters have wood and wire doors opening into the
flights ; and wooden shutters, if needed, fasten over the wire part
of the doors, so that they can be entirely closed in winter and the
shelters kept very warm. The birds are able to get into the
shelters (after the doors are shut) through small holes, one in
each aviary, with a ledge on each side which will hinge up if
necessary. Each shelter has a window ; in the three centre ones
in the front part, in the two outer ones at the ends.
The glass roof is rather over five feet wide, and is glazed
with ground glass, and covered inside with wire netting. In
summer I found it got so hot that I was obliged to stretch an
awning over it (as will be seen in the photograph) for the birds
seemed to feel the heat very oppressive. By this means I kept it
quite cool, and on a wet day it is a great advantage to have an
open part of the aviary that is dry under foot. My first idea was
to have this roof of metal, but I found glass was not very much
more expensive, and I think it is a great improvement to having
all the flights entirely open. The open part of the flights has a
fiat roof of half-inch wire netting, all the netting throughout

<bodyText confidence="0.999794214285714" page_id="10104025"  page_num="17" year="" vol="">
the aviary being of this size. The front of the aviary, that shown
in the picture, is wire to within i# ft. of the ground. At the ends
the woodwork is brought 12 inches higher. The divisions
between the aviaries is wood 2^ ft., the rest wire. The roof of
the aviary is corrugated iron lined with wood, and is fitted with
spouting. The building is 6 k ft. high at the eaves and nft. at
the ridge.
The floor is cemented all over, except in the open flights,
where it is sodded with grass, half inch netting being laid under-
neath as a protection against the inroads of vermin. In the
centre of each of the open flights are fixed earthenware glazed
baths (such as are used in cottages for sinks) 24 inches by 16
inches and 3 inches deep. I found it would have been better if I
could have got them shallower, so to remedy this I cemented
some small steps, made of common grey tiles, in each bath. The
birds soon learnt to use them, and are now quite fearless in
making their ablutions. I was amused the other day to see my
hen Barnard's Parrakeet bathing. She splashed the water all
over herself again and again, and made her wings so heavy with
wet that when she came out she could hardly fly.
All the baths are brushed out, and freshly filled with
water, rather over an inch deep, every da}&amp;quot;. They are fitted with
a plug and waste pipe running underneath the whole length of
the aviary, which carries off the dirty water into a dumb well.
The passage and small aviary are also each fitted with a bath and
waste pipe. Bamboo perches, about 18 inches long, are fixed
into holes in different parts of the framework, but I think of
trying some perches made of yellow tapped pine, as, though the
bamboo are very nice, and are not destroyed by the Parrots, yet
I fancy they are rather hard and cold to the birds' feet. Scotch
fir branches are fastened up, with wire and nails, in each of the
shelters and glass-roofed divisions.
Two metal, painted, boxes are hung up in each aviary for
crushed biscuit and grit, and the seed is placed in brown glazed
earthenware pans,which fit into a ring of iron screwed to the wood
work. The seed-pans can be lifted out with great ease, and have
a flanged edge to prevent the seed being scattered. They are very
clean looking, and were made, to my sketch, by Air. Branuam at
the Barum Pottery Works, Barnstaple, at a very reasonable cost.
The outside of the aviary is painted dark sage-green, with
the windows, etc., in a much lighter shade. The inside is cream-
colour, faced with very pale green. The combination is very
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.980364044444444" page_id="10104026"  page_num="18" year="" vol="">
is
clean and cool-looking, and is done partly with paint, partly
with whitewash.
The windows, at the suggestion of Mr. Walker, are made
in the same way as in hunters' stables, the top sash pulling
forward so that there is no down draught. The part that opens has
a casing of wood and wire, so that, even when the window is
pulled wide open, no bird can escape through it. Of course it is
only in the outside windows that this precaution is needed,
though all the windows are covered with wire netting, as
a precaution against any bird flying against the glass. The
size of each window is 2 ft. 3 inches by 3 ft. 5 inches.
And now having given a detailed, and I fear tedious, descrip-
tion of the aviary, I must give some idea of what it cost. I sent for
three estimates, and selected one from Mr. Walker, Meersbrook
Bank Works, Sheffield. He had several advantages in his favour,
and his estimate was very much less than the other two. lie had
previously done work for me that had worn well. Mr. Walker
came over from Sheffield and talked things over with me. I
found him most obliging and ready with suggestions, telling me
clearly the advantages, or the reverse, of each point under
discussion. He strongly advocated a wooden lining to the roof;
and I am very glad now that I followed his advice, and did not
have it only of metal, as I proposed at first. The price of the
actual framework was ^46 5s., but to the original plan I added
several improvements; and of course this sum did not include
the cost of painting, brick foundations, levelling, and cement
floor, and the waste pipes and bath arrangements, all of which
latter items were done by local workmen.
The aviary was made in large sections at the Meersbrook
Works, and took only a few days to erect, the rough cement
floor, baths, &amp;c., having been put down first. After the aviary
was put up the final layer of cement was added, and also anarrow
border of it round the inside edge of the open flights, as a pre-
caution against vermin ; and I should also add the aviary was
erected on a loose square of bricks as a foundation.
The small wire run at the extreme right hand corner of
the picture (which has been reproduced from an amateur's
photograph) is part of a small aviary for my Californian Quails.
The principal items in the cost of the aviary were as
follows :--

carry off the water from the spouting on the north side, and also
partly for the advantage of another aviary a little distance away.
Added to these expenses were many small items, such as seed-
pots, fir branches, wooden nest boxes for the Parrakeets, etc., so
that^roois not too much to put down as the total cost. Of
course it seems a great deal to spend, but aviaries are expensive
buildings to put up, that is of course if you are determined to make
your little prisoners as happy as possible : and surely that is the
duty and pleasure of every bird-keeper.
I have given many details, thinking they might be of use
to anyone thinking of putting up an aviary, as giving them some
idea of the cost. Should any of our members be in the
neighbourhood I should be very pleased to show them the
aviary, or would send them photographs of the back and interior
(which would explain it far better than I have done) and also
more detailed particulars with a ground plan.
I do not by any means set up the aviary as a perfect one,
but the birds (who should be the best judges) seem thoroughly
happy in it. I should add that it is not heated in any way.

By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
In an article which I published in Vol. IV. of our Magazine
(pp. 101-3), entitled "Scientific Aviculture," I attempted to
show how the breeder of foreign birds might render the facts
which come under his notice of value to the cabinet-naturalist:
but the observations of the breeder by no means exhaust the
treasures to which the student of living birds alone holds the
key.
As I have pointed out in other articles, the aviculturist, in
order to be successful in breeding, must learn to distinguish the
sexes of his birds whilst yet alive. I11 many cases this can be

<bodyText confidence="0.999500302325581" page_id="10104028"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
done by examining the form of the skull, the length and width
of the bill, and the comparative length of the longer primaries :
thus in my paper " On Sexual Distinctions, etc.," (Vol. III. pp.
104-6) I pointed out how various finches in which the plumage
showed no marked difference could readily be sexed when taken
in the hand and compared side by side, either by looking down
at the two heads from above, or in profile.
Later, in one or two papers published in the ' Zoologist,'
I called attention to the sexual differences in the wings of
certain birds, the males of which showed comparatively longer
primaries than the females. To these I added a short additional
paper in Vol. VI. of our Magazine comparing the wings of
various common finches, tending to show that this distinction
was one worthy of study.
From what the late Mr. Abrahams told me, it seems
probable that, in many cases, the males of Parrots may be dis-
tinguished from the females by the darker colouring of their
irides ; but he also put me in the way of discovering another
character, which (if constant, as that keen naturalist assured me
it was) should prove of even greater value, both to the avi-
culturist, and to the cabinet-ornithologist :--
Observing that Mr. Abrahams only had to take a parrot in
his hand in order to state unhesitatingly to what sex it belonged,
I asked him to tell me how he managed it. He replied that it
was a secret which it had taken him five years to discover, which
therefore he did not care to share with other dealers (over whom
it naturally gave him an advantage), but he was willing to
enable me to discover it if I would promise not to make it
generally known during his lifetime. In order to discover this
sexual difference Mr. Abrahams diligently collected hundreds of
dead parrots, carefully sexed them by dissection, prepared and
labelled the skulls with name and sex ; and, having eventuall} r
got together a considerable number of skulls, he set to work to
compare the males with the females. He told me that, having,
after a careful study of his material, hit upon a well-defined
difference, he had destroyed most of the skulls, as having
answered their purpose, but he still retained a large box full.
Taking down a box from a shelf, my old friend placed side
by side on a table the paired skulls of some five or six parrots
belonging to widely different groups, and asked me to see if I
could discover the character. Of course, as I had been accus-
tomed to look for the differences in Finches, Thrushes, Crows,
etc., in the crown and the upper mandible, I looked for similar
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999198" page_id="10104029"  page_num="21" year="" vol="">
21
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998378488372093" page_id="10104029"  page_num="21" year="" vol="">
differences in the skulls of the parrots, until Mr. Abrahams told
me I was looking at the wrong part of the skull; then, turning
my attention to the lower jaw I saw it at a glance :--the posterior
angle of the two rami of the lower jaw, was elongated and acute
in the females, but comparatively short and rounded in the males.
Thus, by taking a parrot in his hand, or even by stroking the
side of the head, so as to enable him to feel the back of the jaw,
Mr. Abrahams at once decided the sex.
A character like the above should certainly be studied,
confirmed, or (if not invariably constant) disproved, by the
student of dead parrots ; to whom it might prove invaluable.
Curiously enough, I was speaking this year to Baron von
Plesson (a great admirer of the Psittacidce) respecting the sexual
differences in the Grey Parrot, and he assured me that in
Germany they always sexed this bird without difficulty by the
form of the naked patch on the face which, in the males, was
rounded behind, but in the females pointed. If this is so, it is a
curious instance of correlation in form, without any apparent
object, between a naked patch on the skin and the bones of the
lower jaw.
That the bite of a female parrot is often (if not always)
more severe than that of a male, will I think be admitted by
those who have had much to do with handling them ; and that
this is not necessarily due to the more pointed upper mandible
will be clear, if it can be shown that the jaw of the female offers
a better surface for the attachment of muscle.
In studying the sexual differences in the form of the beak,
the age of the bird must be taken into account. Thus, if it be a
general rule (as I believe it is) that males of the Thrush family
( Tw&amp;apos;didte ) have a longer and narrower bill than the females, one
must not conclude that this character will hold good in birds of
the year ; because even though (as in the case of the American
Blue-bird, Sialia sialis) the young bird acquires its adult colour-
ing in the year of its birth, the nestling character of the bill does
not attain to its adult form until the bird is fully a year old. I
believe it is this fact which has caused the cabinet-ornithologist
to disbelieve in the constancy of the sexual characters which the
aviculturist accepts.
To assert the inconstancy of a character is dangerous;
because it may lead the sceptic into trouble. A bird of the year
may be, and I believe usually is in the Thrushes, smaller than its
parents. I examined all the broad-billed males of Sialia sialis
pi the British Museum series, and found them pretty uniform in
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998787" page_id="10104030"  page_num="22" year="" vol="">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999490464285714" page_id="10104030"  page_num="22" year="" vol="">
length, but noticeably .shorter than the narrow-billed males:
now if a young bird did not acquire its full adult colouring in
any species, and was found to be constantly smaller and with a
broader bill, it would not be surprising if it were regarded as a
well defined distinct species.
So far as I have examined them, I should assume that in
the Coi-vidce the form of the bill is the reverse of that in the
Turdidce, the male bill being broader and shorter than in the
female; whereas in Gymnorhina, the group of so-called Piping
Crows, the male has the longer and more slender bill.
Aviculture and scientific ornithology should walk hand in
hand, as twin studies ; each is of importance to the other. The
study of the soft parts cannot be pursued in the cabinet, only in
life ; and in many instances the colours of these parts have been
incorrectly described ; either owing to the neglect or careless-
ness of collectors, or to the attempt to reconstruct the living
colouring from skins. Perhaps one of the most remarkable of
these errors, frequently repeated, is that relating to the colour of
the iris in the young and adult of our common Jay ; a young
bird which I received as a nestling some years since had pale
blue eyes (just as the young of many other animals have) but
these changed to vinous brown with the first moult, and are of
that colour to the present time: that this is the correct colouring
has been since confirmed by the observations of other avi-
culturists ; and that this colouring should have been reversed in
text-books, is sufficient to prove that the study of living birds
is as much a branch of ornithological science, as the study of
bird-skins.

What the dealer wants to be is what they call in Africa " a
devil man." He must betray no weakness, but possess a character
which I should describe as a compound of Cardinal Richelieu,
Brutus, Julius Caesar, Prince Metternich, and Mezzofanti: the
better to carry on " the bird dealer language " part of the
business. He must stand no nonsense, and strictly adhere to
the motto "No admittance here except on business." This may
cause unpleasantness, but in the end the dealer will flourish and
be regarded as " a devil man."
The shop I have in my mind is a typical one : the space
all round the walls is lined with store cages, thus enabling the

eye of the master to rove round his treasures, like a hen sitting
on her eggs. The floor is--but there, I will not shock your
feelings by entering into particulars, but insect life is not absent.
Though I cite this particular shop as a typical one, it is,
remember, a specimen of the highest class. The owner takes
ever)&amp;apos; care, that lies in his power, of the birds that form his
stock-in-trade--giving them rations of suitable food and waiter :
but this is not so with all firms. I have seen some shops away
dowm East where the unfortunate birds are expected to live on
anything--an expectation the birds by no means realize--for they
usually die.
Although, as I have said, the bird shop at its best is a
place, as Mr. Tracy Tupmau would say, " more fitted for a
wounded heart than for one still able to feast on social joys," it
is a luxurious institution compared to a home-coming ship.
This has one hundred times the danger and a thousand times
the discomfort of any bird shop I ever heard of. Any bird living
through the horrors of the homeward passage deserves great
credit for his courage and enterprise, and may safely be regarded
as illustrating Darwin's theory of the " survival of the fittest."
Every bird dealer looks down on every other bird dealer,
and every other bird dealer looks down upon him. David once
said in his haste that all men are liars ; most bird dealers say it
at their leisure of each other. I do not think that if the whole
of Mr. Pitman's School of Shorthand were present, they could
take down the whole of the crimes which one bird dealer will
lay at another's door. This description certainly hits off the
character of an inhabitant of Sodom and Gomorrah : and one
could really think that those two historic cities had not been, as
the Biblical records tell us--destroyed--but merely removed to
East London. I really think that some future Revision Com-
mittee should substitute the w r ord ' transported ' for ' destroyed.'
From their own account of the state of trade, and the awful and
unparalleled series of losses they have had, you would, if you
were of a trustful disposition, regard the bird dealer with an
admiring awe--as the man who has solved the problem of how to
keep a shop and live on the losses. Nay, not only to live but do
well.
A dealer I knew once told me he had bred almost every
bird I named, " in his back shop." It was all peyfectly easy.
" My dear Sir," he said in his most impressive manner, " anyone
can do it, if he tries." Mr. Hutchinson, in his "Ten Years
Wanderings among the Ethiopians," tells that, at Fernando Po,

Indian corn, planted on a Monday evening, on the following
Wednesday morning will be four inches above ground--within
a period, as he carefully sa)^, of thirty-six hours! I don't dis-
believe him ; but I like to get a great strong man and a Consul
of His Britannic Majesty to say it for me. Well, that is how I
felt about that dealer's stories. I am myself, as Hans Bretmann
says, " still skebdigal."
I often stand and admire the marvellous skill which a
dealer I know displays in catching Parrots. Now, in parrot-
catching there are two players ; and the one wins that gets hold
first. I fancy that the golden rule in the game is invincible
courage. As Captain Boler, of Bony, used to say, " Never be
afraid of a Parrot if you can help it; but never show it anyhow."
It is difficult, I grant you, but the only safe road.
To be a really successful bird buyer you must have no
what our American cousins call "blooming modesty." When
the dealer names a price, boldly make him a bid, but don't be
shocked at what follows. Probably if you turned blue all over,
with yellow spots, he would not assume a more astonished look.
His feelings will fly ahead of his command of language--great
as that is, and he will expectorate with profound feeling and
expression ; his expressive countenance will be a perfect battle
ground of despair and grief at his being thus asked to lower
trade prices, but in the end he will control his feelings sufficiently
to meet your wishes, and the affair will be amicably settled.
Let me mention a little incident that once happened to
myself. I had bought a certain bird of a certain dealer who
shall be nameless. It arrived dead. I carefully cut a nick out of
its tail and returned it; at the same time asking for a live one
in place of it. Next day I received back what purported to be a
new one ; but, on examining it, lo! it was dead too, and its tail
zvas nicked. I wrote to that dealer in a kind and fatherly manner,
and the purport of my remarks resembled the words of Bret
Harte on a not dissimilar occasion :
Which is why I remark--
And my language is plain--
That for ways that are dark
And for tricks that are vain
My bird dealer friend is peculiar;
Which the same I am free to maintain.
Let me give one other very funny scene from dealer life.
Some time ago there lived three rivals in the avicultural world.
We will call them A., B., and C., and all apparently had more
money than sense. Dealers soon got to know their little ways,

and pla) T ed them off one against the other. Whenever some rare
stuff came in, wires went flying about to all the suburbs calling
the three like eagles to their prey. Among the dealers was one
very downy one. One day he received three rare Tanagers ; off
went three wires, all to the same effect: " A very rare Tanager
has come only one in market. Come at once." On receipt of
telegram, A., B., and C. repaired -- fortunately, as the event
proved--at different hours to that bird shop. Mr. Dealer had
put two of the birds away, only one was on view. In rushed A.:
" Has that bird gone ? if you have sold it to B. or C. I will never
buy off you again." "No, Sir; here it is." "How much?"
Dealer names a stiff price. " All right, I'll take it." Hardly has
A. departed when, like Esau of old, B. enters. Mr. Dealer has
just got Tanager No. 2 out of concealment. Same scene
repeated, and B. departs, happy in the thought that he has
circumvented A. and C. Hardly have his footsteps died away
when C. arrives breathless from the City. " I must have that
bird ; I don't care what price it is ; but A. and B. sha'n't have it."
"All right, Sir," says Mr. Dealer, "here it is;" producing
Tanager No. 3. C. goes off happy and smiling. Next day
A., B., and C. meet. They exalt over their enemies. " I have
got the only Blue Tanager living," says A. " No, y r ou hav&amp;apos;n't,"
says B., " I have." " Why," says C., " I have it; what do you
mean?" Tableau! They repair to that bird shop, vowing
threatenings and slaughter 011 their treacherous friend. But, as
the dealer said to me, with a sly wink, " I was oiit when they
called."
But joking apart: we all of us owe the dealer an immense
debt of gratitude. By his means I have obtained birds which I
could never otherwise have seen. I have turned up in his shop
unexpected and unheralded, and, like Solomon did the Queen of
Sheba, " he has shown me all his royal treasure," and, like that
wise king, he has told me all that was in his heart; or, at any
rate, as much as he thought it would be good for me to know.
He has handed down cage after cage under conditions which
must have given him very real trouble and inconvenience, and
for the sake of an individual that, as an old Hebrew prophet
once said, " could not profit him." He has often given me good
advice, which, had I followed it, would have enabled me to keep
out of much hot water. I sincerely hope often to visit him again
in the future; for I have much to learn and he has much to
teach : and I say of him what we say up here of our miners, " he
arns all that he gets." May his losses be few and his profits
large!

NOTES ON BREEDING BUDGERIGARS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990445390243903" page_id="10104057"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
By Emily Brampton.
It has been suggested to me by a member of the Council
that I should write an account of my success in breeding
Budgerigars. Though they are common birds, and the majority
of them will breed very easily under suitable circumstances,
success is not universal, and my experiences may serve to
encourage others, who have failed so far, to go on and prosper in
spite of difficulties.
Budgerigars were the first foreign birds I ever possessed.
At that time I was not a member of the Avicultural Society, but
having read that " Budgerigars are as easily bred as Canaries,"
I was fired with the ambition to try my 'prentice hand. I had
already been very successful with Canaries, and pictured myself
buying a pair of Budgerigars and seeing nest after nest of young
ones climbing and flying about my aviary. Alas! I did not
dream of the four years of disappointment that stood between me
and success, but " its dogged does it," and, when fortune smiled
at last, I forgot all previous disappointments.
Consulting my authority, I found that she who would rear
Budgerigars must procure " imported " birds to start with.
Strangely enough, the dealer to whom I applied had
several "imported" birds in his stock, and I returned
home in triumph with two pairs. It was April, so I
turned them out into an aviary by themselves, supplying them
with everything the heart of bird could desire--and then waited
impatiently for the young birds to appear.
The aviary was a disused summer house with small flight;
--it was liberally supplied with perches, natural branches, and
cocoanut husks, and the birds were fed on canary and millet,
water and grass; with sand and mortar in profusion. I grudged
those birds nothing, and yet they showed the basest ingratitude
and would not even look at a nest. They did not seem very
clever at flying either, and deep down in my heart was the doubt
whether they were as large or as bright in colour as Budgerigars
should be. Still the dealer had warranted them " imported,"
so they must be all right, and I preached patience to myself
and said, " Next Spring they will begin ! " Spring came and went,
and I was still hoping; learning slowly and painfully through
deaths caused by apoplexy, egg binding and mice, and still buying
" imported " birds at many times their real value. And so the
fourth season came round, and, though I had lost one of my hens,

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998804285714285" page_id="10104058"  page_num="27" year="" vol="">
one happy day I found a young bird crouching on the floor. Its
mother certainly did not seem so proud of it as I should have
expected, or as I was myself; and, after a week or two, I did wonder
whether it was the usual thing for a young Budgerigar to be so
long learning to fly, and whether it ought to scuttle away into
corners and tumble about as it did ! It was very tiny too, and
rather short of feathers, but it was the first, and I was not
disposed to be critical.
It was not followed by another, and it never learned to fly,
but when it died I learned what " French moult " meant, and
had advanced another step towards knowledge. Before the next
Spring, I emptied and disinfected my aviary, and, having lost all
faith in my authority, decided to experiment for myself, which I
ought to have done long before.
Having learned that Budgerigars in their native land are
gregarious, I acted on the hint, and in February turned out
five pairs of aviary bred birds from a good breeding strain. By
this time, although determined to keep Budgerigars until they
did rear some young ones, I had ceased to expect success, and
was surprised and puzzled about two months later to find a
stranger in the aviary. It could not surely be a young one at
last, for it was so big and plump, and such a splendid flier, but it
certainly had black eyes, and no yellow cap ! Next day, however,
it was outside again with two companions, and in the course of
a week or so, twelve grand young birds had made their appear-
ance--and I was happy at last. After this the youngsters came so
thick and fast that they overflowed into my other aviaries until
all were over-crowded, and still they came !
When the first dozen young ones had moulted and
assumed their adult plumage, I returned five pairs to the aviary
and they also nested. These five original and five young pairs
reared one hundred and four young birds between one February
and the next. How they managed it I have never been able to
understand ; my success was too precious for me to imperil it by
even a peep into the nests--I just kept quiet, supplying food,
and removing youngsters, and left the birds to manage the rest
themselves; and they certainly justified my confidence in
them.
Having reared so many young birds, the difficult}&amp;apos; was to
dispose of them all; but after a good deal of trouble I succeeded
in doing so, retaining only two pairs of the old ones, who
promptly gave up nesting seriously and only played at it.

Therefore it seems almost necessary to keep a number of
these birds together, otherwise they become too fat to do any
good, and die either of apoplexy or egg-binding. They are
very greedy birds and if liberally supplied are apt to eat more
than is good for them, especially of millet seed. My experience
teaches me to limit the amount of millet, giving it only three
times a week when there are no young ones to be fed, and not
to be too generous with canary; then, if the birds have sufficient
room for flight, and plenty of grit, and grass pulled up by the
roots, with fresh water, the}' will keep each other in good con-
dition if there are several pairs in the aviary.
I think the young ones should always be removed as soon
as they can well feed, as they interfere with subsequent nests,
besides beginning on their own account at too early an age.
Each pair of birds should have two husks or boxes hung up out
of the reach of mice, with a very small entrance hole facing the
light. The birds will enlarge it if it be too small, but I always
found they disliked too large an entrance. My birds never had
sop when feeding young ones, I gave them only white oats.
This feeding seemed to suit them, for they grew into magnificent
birds, as large and bright as any I have seen.

THE CRYSTAL PALACE BIRD SHOW.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99852855" page_id="10104059"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
The sixteenth annual exhibition of the London and Pro-
vincial Ornithological Society was held at the Crystal Palace,
from November 5th to 7th last.
In the British and Foreign Sections there was little of
exceptional interest or rarity, and the Show was by 110 means up
to the average of Palace Shows. No tent was provided, the
Show being held in the centre of the Palace, just in front of
the Royal Box ; and several of the delicate foreigners suffered
severely from exposure to draughts, and on the second day more
than one specimen looked as though it had but few hours to
live.
Commencing with the British Section--there were several
nice birds in the Migratory Class, the first and third prizes going
to Mr. C. T. Maxwell's Blue - headed Wagtail and Blackcap
respectively. The second prize winner was a lovely specimen
of the Black Redstart, exhibited by Mrs. C. Cooper. A nice
Cole-tit was shown, but in a most unsuitable cage, without any
nest-box, which is so essential to these hole-loving birds.
The Mixed Class contained an interesting collection, the
first prize going to a fine Chough, belonging to Mr. W. F.

Plumbridge, one of the best we remember to have seen in
captivity. The second prize was awarded to a very good cock
Mistle Thrush Of the other members of this class, the most
interesting were a Greater- and a Lesser-spotted Woodpecker,
the latter of which looked as though it was not long for this
world ; a Golden-crested Wren, a difficult bird to keep success-
fully; and a Ring-Ouzel. Somebody sent a London Sparrow,
for what reason we were unable to discover.
In the Foreign Section we passed the Parrot Class
without noticing anything unusual or of special interest.
The Class for Budgerigars and Love-birds was cancelled.
The best bird in the Mixed Class for Parrakeets was un-
doubtedly Mr. Hawkins' female Golden-shoulder, but she was in
a horribly draughty position and did not look over happy.
There was a Class for Waxbills, Mannikins, Combassous,
Weavers, and Whydahs, the first prize in which was justly
awarded to a very good pair of Batliilda ruficauda. A good pair
of Pectoral Finches ( Munia pectoralis ) obtained the second, and
a pair of Wiener's Waxbills the third prize.
The Mixed Class for Seedeaters was a large one, the first
prize going to a very ordinary pair of Long-tailed Grassfinches,
shown by Mrs. C. Cooper, and the second to a pair of so-called
White-eared Grassfinches, belonging to Mr. Hawkins, but one
was so dark that it struck us as being much more like a hybrid
between the White-eared and Masked Finches. A good pair of
Olive Finches were sent by Mr. Hawkins.
There were two interesting exhibits of Doves in this
class, belonging to Mr. W. E. Parker, although neither was
in specially good form. One was a specimen of the Violet Dove
(Geotrigon violacea) and the other the White-winged Dove (Afelo-
pelia leucoptera) both from the West Indies.
The Class for Insectivorous Birds contained some interes-
ing birds. Mr. Glasscoe sent two beautiful Wood-Swallows, the
Masked (Artamus personaius) and the White-eyebrowed ( A.
supercilios 7 is), and a Sacred Kingfisher ( Halcyon sanctci). Mr.
Housden sent a fine pair of South American Rails, and Mr.
Gilroy a large Hill Mynah.
Quite a new feature in the Show was a Class for Stuffed
Specimens, and there were no less than thirty entries. The only
exhibits, however, that especially commended themselves to us
as being naturally and beautifully set up, were those of Mr. C.
Thorpe, of Croydon, whose groups of Puffins and Little Auks
were really charming. D. S.-S.

<bodyText confidence="0.982401" page_id="10104061"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
The second volume of Dr. Stark's valuable contribution to
the Ornithology of South Africa is at last to hand. We have
had to wait some lime for it but it is well worth waiting for, and
quite conies up to the high standard of his first volume. The
Editor in his Preface reminds us of the tragic and melancholy
end of the author in Eadysmith, when the first volume only was
in the printers' hands and the manuscript for the second volume
was by no means complete. Dr. Stark's materials were, however,
placed in the hands of Mr. W. L. Sclater who has completed
the volume, which deals with the second half of the Passerine
Birds, and includes the Bush - shrikes, Babblers, Bulbuls,
Warblers, Rock-jumpers, Thrushes, Chats, Robins, Fly-
catchers, Drongos, Cuckoo-shrikes, Swallows, and Pittas.
This work is well illustrated, all the illustrations (with one
exception) being by Mr. H. Gronvold. The only direct repro-
duction from a photograph is most successful and represents a
Cape Rock Thrush with nest and eggs in its natural surround-
ings ; amongst the eggs being one laid by the Solitary Cuckoo.
This is a work that should find its way to the libraries of
all who are interested in South African Ornithology.
THE CAGE BIRDS OF CAECUTTA.
A very interesting paper, and one of considerable
importance to aviculturists, entitled " The Cage Birds of
Calcutta," by our valued member, Mr. Frank Finn, appeared in
the Ibis for July last, and has recently been reprinted and a copy
kindly sent us by the Author.
The taste for cage birds in India seems to date back from a
very remote period, but we are sorry to find that " the fancy " is
no longer what it was, although Calcutta still rejoices in a very
well-known bird market.
The breeding of birds in aviaries appears to be little under-
stood in India, most species being kept either singly in small
cages, or several examples being housed together in larger cages.
Insectivorous birds are the favourite cage birds in India,
and these are fed for the most part on " the flour of gram, a

kind of pulse, made up into a paste with ghee (clarified butter).
This ' sattoo ' seems to suit them very well; it is supplemented,
in the case of purely insectivorous species, by a daily ration of
live maggots and grasshoppers."
The method of obtaining these is certainly most con-
venient, and many of us would doubtless be glad if similar
facilities existed in England. We are told that the breeding ot
the maggots and the collection of the grasshoppers forms " the
trade of a number of professional bird-feeders, who, on receipt of
a small monthly sum, will call daily at the houses of their patrons
and supply insectivorous birds with everything needful."
Although, naturally, the great number of the species
seen in the Calcutta Markets belong to the Indian region, birds
from almost all parts of the globe seem to find their way thither.
Even the lovely Birds of Paradise are occasionally to be seen in
Calcutta, although the males only are imported and appear to
thrive well in captivity.
Mr. Finn mentions nearly every species likely to be met
with in Calcutta. Some are well known to us at home, others
are very rarely seen here, and many are quite unknown in this
country.
We would strongly advise any of our members who are
likely to visit Calcutta to carefully peruse this most useful paper.
The Ibis for October contains papers on : " The Birds of
the Southern Shan States" ; " An Introduction to the Study of
the Drepanididce, a Family of Birds peculiar to the Hawaiian
Islands"; "Two recently discovered Additions to the Genus

BIRD NOTES.
At a meeting of the Society for the Protection of Birds held on
October 25th last, at No. 26, Hanover Square, Mr. Oxley Grabham, M.B.O.U.,
exhibited a number of lantern-slides from his own photographs, illustrative
of Yorkshire bird life, accompanying them with explanatory remarks. All
the pictures were good, and some of an exceptionally high order of merit.
The nest of a Tree-creeper was shown. After the bird had laid her eggs, a

Redstart drove her away, took possession of the nest, and laid her clutch.
Both, however, were lost, for neither bird would allow the other to incubate.
Most of the birds of the moors, and their nests, were exhibited, and there
was a good series illustrating the cliffs and climbers at Flaniborough. The
Robin was, of course, included, for it is a universal favourite. Mr.
Grabham, however, spoke very plainly as to the pugnacious character of this
species ; as he did also ofthe misdeeds of the Sparrow, of which so good an
ornithologist as the late Lord Lilford had spoken as Passer damtiabilis. From
a scientific point of view, the most noteworthy views were a series showing
the nesting habits of the Kingfisher--which Mr. Grabham said was common
on all Yorkshire streams--and the young in various stages. But, as pictures,
the palm must probably he given to the sitting Black-headed Gulls on a
small, reedy island in a placid lake--probably iuvolving no great difficulty,
but very effective and picturesque.-- Standard, October 26th, 1901.
Writing to the Feathered World of October nth last, Mr. D. G. Ricard
observes :--" The two most beautiful birds in South Africa are the Blue Jay
and the Emerald Cuckoo ; which of the birds carries off the palm would be
hard to say, as opinion is divided on the subject. The Cuckoo, which is
about the size of the English bird, is one mass of green and gold, the wings
and head being of the latter colour, whilst the breast is a vivid green. The
Blue Jay is blue as to the wings and head, but with a golden breast. As
these birds fly by in the brilliant sunlight they make a picture such as an
artist would like to dwell on. These birds are only found in certain parts
of the country, namely, where bush is more or less abundant. They are
said to be dying out, the rage for ' curios ' of all kinds no doubt being
responsible for this."
Mr. Hedley Speed kindly forwards us the following cuttings from the
Liverpool Daily Post, October 21st, 1901 :--" Bird Song.--Mr. W. E. D. Scott,
Curator of Ornithology, in Princeton University, United States, reared two-
young Baltimore Orioles away from the old birds and found that they
began to sing of themselves when the}&amp;apos; grew older, but the song was their
own, that is to say, different from the ordinary song of the Oriole. Other
young Orioles reared beside these birds copied their new song. Hence it
would appear that while birds inherit the tendency to sing they learn the
particular song."
Extract from same paper, October 26th, 1901 :--" From the statement
in the Liverpool Post of the 21st that a distinguished American ornithologist
has discovered " that, while birds inherit the tendency to sing, they learn
the particular song " from their parents, it is evident (writes a naturalist
correspondent) that we have still much to learn on this subject. How comes
it that young partridges have been heard to sound their familiar call-note
before they were hatched--five or six hours before they were out of the
egg ? Can they hear before they are hatched, and through the shell ? But
I can mention a more puzzling case. Some years ago an Edinburgh bird
dealer obtained a fledgling Cuckoo from a Hedge-sparrow's nest and
managed to rear it. Now, in this case, the parents of that bird had left
the country before it was caught, and if it heard any " song " at all in
its infancy it was that of its foster parents. But what was the result ?
The young Cuckoo lived through the winter, and in the spring gave out

the familiar song-note, " Cuckoo, cuckoo ! " It may be added that the
bird dealer had no other Cuckoo in his shop.
A specimen of the Great Auk's egg, the last of four belonging to the
late Baron d'Hamonville, was offered for sale at Stevens' Auction Rooms
on October 29th last. The bidding commenced at 100 guineas, and the egg
was eventuallv knocked down for 240 guineas. Of the other three, two
were sold for 300 guineas each, and one for 170 guineas; so that the four
eggs have realised ^1,060 10s.

Sir, --I enclose a cutting from the " Globe " of 23rd October
last regarding the strange and sudden disappearance of the Passenger
Pigeon (Eclopistes migmtorius) which but a few lyears ago, I believe, was
found in countless thousands in the United States. The article has a
melancholy interest for naturalists, for it would seem to shew that this fine
species must be added to the list of those that have been.
Can you tell us in the " Avicultural Magazine" whether this is indeed
the case or whether there is any hope that the bird still exists and perhaps
stands a chance of becoming plentiful again, for it seems so difficult to find
a reason for its complete disappearance in so short a time.
H. C. Martin.
[We are much obliged for the cutting, which we regret being unable,
on account of limited space, to print here. Whether the Passenger Pigeon
is actually extinct or not we are unable to sav, but we strongly doubt the
fact. There is, however, no question as to the rapid decrease that has taken
place in recent years in the numbers of this species.
The last nesting of any importance seems to have been in the year
18S1, and, according to Lydekker&amp;apos;s Natural History , "in 1886, Mr.
Stevens found about fifty dozen pairs nesting in a swamp near Take
City." As late as 1895, the year in which the above work was published,
this Pigeon was "by no means on the verge of extinction," but its
extermination was regarded as " only a matter of time."
The best account of this remarkable species, that we have been able
to lay hands on, is that by Wilson, quoted in Selby's volume of the old
" Jardine's Naturalists Library," and the subject is of such interest that we
may perhaps be pardoned for quoting at some length. Writing of one of
the remarkable breeding places of this bird, he remarks;--"Not far from
Shelbyville, in the State of Kentucky, . . . there was one of these
breeding places, which stretched through the woods in nearly a North and
South direction, was several miles in breadth, and was said to be upwards of
forty miles in extent ! In this tract almost every tree was furnished with
nests wherever the branches could accommodate them. The Pigeons made
their first appearance there about the iotli of April, and left it altogether
with their young before the 25th of May. As soon as the young were fully
grown, and before they left the nests, numerous parties of the inhabitants,
from all parts of the adjacent country, came with waggons, asses, beds,

cooking utensils, many of them accompanied by the greater part of their
families, and encamped for several days at this immense nursery.
The ground was strewn with broken limbs of trees, eggs, and young squab
pigeons, which had been precipitated from above, and on which herds of
hogs were fattening. Hawks, Buzzards and Eagles were sailing about in
great numbers, and seizing the squabs from the nests at pleasure ; while
from twenty feet upwards to the top of the trees, the view through
the woods presented a perpetual tumult of crowding and fluttering
multitudes of pigeons, their wings roaring like thunder. .....
On some single trees, upwards of an hundred nests were found, each
containing one squab only." Audubon, however, states that two eggs are
laid, each brood usually consisting of male and female.
Writing of one of the vast flocks of these Pigeons Wilson proceeds,
" From right to left as far as the eye could reach, the breadth of this vast
procession extended, seeming everywhere equally crowded. Curious to
determine how long this appearance would continue, I took out my watch
to note the time, and sat down to observe them. It was then half past one;
I sat for more than an hour but instead of a diminution of this] prodigious
procession, it seemed rather to increase, both in numbers and rapidity; and
anxious to reach Frankfort before night, I rose and went on. About four
o'clock in the afternoon I crossed the Kentucky river at the town of Frank-
fort, at which time the living torrent above my head seemed as numerous
and as extensive as ever." Wilson estimated this flock to consist of some-
thing over two hundred and thirtj&amp;apos; millions, which, he says is "probably far
below the actual amount."
The species is found, according to the British Museum Catalogue, in
" North America, from Hudson's Bay southwards and westwards to the
Great Plains, straggling westward to Nevada and the Washington Territory.
Accidental in Cuba."
That its numbers should have so rapidly decreased, that, at the
present time, it is a scarce species, if not almost an extinct one, is a
problem that we admit to being quite unable to solve.-- Editor.]

Sir, -- I have bred three fine young Bloodwing Parrakeets -- also two
Redrnmp Parrakeets, this summer in my garden aviary. They are fine
healthy birds, but, so far, do not show by their colouring if any of
them are cocks.
I have also bred Zebra-fin dies, Cutthroats, and two Red-billed
Weavers in another aviary. Sarah E. MorshEad.
VIRGINIAN NIGHTINGALES.
Sir, -- In reply to the Hon. Mrs. Hawke's letter in the October num-
ber re the above, I have pleasure in relating my experience with Virginian
Nightingales. I have had altogether three nests of these truly interesting
birds. Twice the bird built her nest among some dead branches in the
outside portion of the aviary, and on the last occasion in a Hartz Mountain
cage inside the hut.
I may state that the hen bird did practically all the building
operations, the cock appearing to take no interest at all. In the first case
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.968155590909091" page_id="10104066"  page_num="35" year="" vol="">
she laid four eggs, only laying an egg every other day; and, in about
thirteen days after the last egg was-laid, I noticed there were young birds
in the nest. They were covered with white down. These birds lived only
for about two days and then disappeared, and I could find no trace of them.
The hen built another nest almost immediately, and again laid four
eggs; this .time on consecutive days. As I had a suspicion that the cock
knew something about the fate of the last lot of young ones, I caged him
up ; but it made no difference, as the young birds only lived as long as the
first brood had done.
The third time she laid only three eggs. This time I did not trouble
her at all until the young had been hatched a little while. They grew
splendidly until they were nine days old, when one night the largest one
fell from the nest to the ground and was killed. This seemed to dishearten
the old hen, as she deserted the remaining two immediately.
My birds were fed on ants' eggs, mealworms, hard-boiled eggs, green
peas, raw meat chopped very fine, and plenty of green food, etc.
I see that the Rev. C. D. Farrar, in his article on these birds in Vol. V.,
draws attention to Mr. Gedney's remark in his book, wherein he states that
his bird laid four eggs at intervals during eight days. In my aviary, with
the first nest, my experience coincides with Mr. Gedney's, while in the
second and third nests with that of the Rev. C. D. Farrar.

Sir, --It maj- interest you to know that my aviary has done very well
this year. I have lost very few birds, and those I have are all looking well.
They have been out since last Christmas, and have nearly all finished
moulting out of doors.
I reared a nest of Cordou-bleus ; they built in a little travelling cage
box outside and brought out three young ones. When I left for Scotland on
August 12th, they were well and flying about, but when I returned in
September, only the old birds remained.
I have thirty-three young Zebra-finches, two young Cutthroats, two
young Spice-or Nutmeg-finches. Is it not rather rare to rear the latter?
I obtained the parents in 1896, and this is the first year they have nested.
When I came home on September 26th the young ones still had fluff on
their heads though flying about out-side. Parson-finches and Saffron-
finches both laid but did not hatch.
The Scarlet and Superb Tanagers I bought at the Auxiliary Stores
last November were put out in May, and are now very nearly through
their moult.
My losses since last January have been : four Waxbills, five Black-
headed Nuns -- some very old ; two Parson-finches, some Canaries, and two
Combassons.
I am enlarging my aviary, and hope to have the Popes and Virginian
Cardinals separate next year.
The following is a list of the birds I have at present : --
No. 1 Aviary : Twenty-two Canaries, six Cut-throats, two Pintail
Whydalis, thirty-two Zebra-finches, seven Waxbills, four Red Avadavats,
three Green Avadavats, four White-bellied Nuns, eleven White-headed Nuns,

Parson-finches, two Saffron-finches, one Russian Cock Bullfinch, one Blue-
winged Love-bird, two Cockatiels, three Java Doves, one Scarlet Tanager,
one Superb Tanager, one pair Nicobar Pigeons, one Foutenegra from
Madeira, two cock Californian Quails, three Cordon-bleus, one Mountain
Finch, one Mannikin. These have been together all the year.
Aviary No. 2 : Three Pekin Robins, two Indigo birds, four Weavers,
one Green-singing Finch, two Nonpareils, two Teal, one pair Virginian
Cardinals, one pair Popes, one Rosella, one Half-1110011 Parrakeet, one
Redrump, one Indian Parrakeet, two Zebra Doves.
The Virginians built a nest and laid, but the other birds took
their eggs. N. L. F. Duneeath.
[We can find no previous record of the Spice-finch (Munia punctulata)
having nested successfully in the United Kingdom, although one young one
was reared by Dr. Russ in Germany, and we believe therefore that Lady
Dunleath is the first to breed this species in the British Isles. -- Fix]

ORANGE-CHEEKED WAX BILLS BREEDING IN CAPTIVITY.

<bodyText confidence="0.9974252" page_id="10104067"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I know as a rule you do not care for seeing dead birds, but I
thought the enclosed young Orange-cheeked Waxbill might interest you.
The brood was hatched (in a cage) about September 17U1. There are three
more young birds; one is not very strong, but I think will live, the other
two are very fine birds. The little one I send had been ill two or three
days. Can you tell me what it died of? It seemed getting better, but died
rather suddenly this morning. Can you tell me if the Orange-cheeks have
been bred in England before ? Rosie Ai.dek.son.
The following reply was sent to Miss Alderson :
You have been unusually fortunate with your Waxbills; and to
successfully breed the Orange-cheeked Waxbill was considered no easy task
even by the late Dr. Russ.
This species has on several occasions been bred in Germany, but I do
not remember any instance of its being bred in Great Britain.
I was interested to see the bird, and hoped the skin might have been
preserved; but these baby Waxbills decompose so rapidly that, at the first
attempt to skin it, the whole of the feathers came off the underparts. The
abdomen was full of blood and water, so that death was probably due to
some internal rupture, but I fear I am not doctor enough to tell you more.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Author Gill, Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath, Kent, and
must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of the case.
If a reply by post (in addition to any Report that may appear in the Magazine) be required,
a stamped and addressed envelope must likewise be forwarded to Mr. Gill.
Queen Parrot. (The Rev. H. 1 ). Astley). Both this bird and her mate
have died within a few days of each other, after having bred this year,
and having been in an outdoor aviary for four years in perfect health.
[Your Parrot was much emaciated. There was extensive tubercular
deposit in both lungs and liver. The contents of intestines were much too
fluid to be normal, and doubtless your bird has suffered from diarrhoea, for
some days.
Cause of death was syncope (heart failure). No doubt nesting and
moulting have been such a strain upon the system of this bird, owing to
the tubercular disease (which is of some duration) having reduced its
strength considerably, that when diarrhoea set in exhaustion became so
extreme that the heart failed to act].
Bicheno&amp;apos;S Finch. (Mr. Glasscoe). Symptoms:--Stretching of the neck
when breathing, with more pronounced gasping as death approached.
Suggested :--Some formation in the neck.
[Death was due to congestion of the lungs, both of which were
involved. This condition was brought about by chill. The stretching of
the neck simultaneously with each inspiration was merely indicative of an
especial effort on the part of the sufferer to inflate the partially con-
solidated lungs. There was no disease whatever in the throat].
Parrot-finch. (The Rev. H. D. Astley).
[Death was due to pressure on the brain from extravasated blood;
brought about, no doubt, by an injury, in all probability by coming in
contact with some object when flying].
Orange-cheeked Wax bide. (Miss Alderson). Found dead in aviary,
only a few minutes after being seen, apparently quite well.
[Your Orange-cheek died from compression of the brain, owing to a
depression in the skull caused by some injury. Your suggestion of a peck
by another bird is very feasible. The crop was full of seed and the bird
well-nourished].
King Parrot. (Mr. H. B. Smith).
TCause of death : Sub-acute enteritis, of some long standing,
probably due to injudicious feeding, or want of cleanliness during importa-
tion. You furnish no symptoms of this bird, but only of the Oueen Parrot
which survived. In future kindly notice Rules, as in some cases the
symptoms, when given, will save a great deal of time and trouble].
SCARLET Tanager. (Mr. Watson). Showed signs of illness 24 hours after
purchase. It was then in a hanging cage out of doors, and after eating
voraciously of banana and the usual insectivorous mixture, was found
apparently dead. On being thoroughly warmed, and given a small dose
of rum, it revived and again fed greedily at 10 p.m. in a warm room.
In the morning it was dead.
[Your Tanager died of acute inflammation of the lungs, as one might
have expected if so injudiciously placed out of doors in such weather].
Grey Cardinal and Black-headed Gouldian. (Mrs. Johnstone). Both
found dead, after being in apparently good health a short time before.
[The Cardinal died of a fractured skull, and the Gouldian of acute
inflammation of the bowels]. Arthur Gill.

I have long had an affection for Owls as aviary inmates,
and consequently when, for the fourth month, I saw a pair of
Spotted Eagle Owls still confined in the same small cage at a
well-known London dealers, apparently healthy but blackened
by a winter's fog, I took compassion on them and purchased them
at a price considerably below their value when first landed from
South Africa.
The Spotted Eagle Owl fBubo viaculosusj is, for an Eagle
Owl, a small bird, being but slightly larger than the Brown
Owl of our own country. In colour it is dark sepia brown,
mottled and barred with white, and, like all Eagle Owls, has two
conspicuous tufts of feathers, erroneously called ears, situated on
either side at the top of the head. The only other point to be
noticed about the plumage of this species is the patch of white
below the chin, which, though more conspicuous in the male, is
found in both sexes; but is hardly visible except when the throat
is distended as they hoot, and may possibly serve as a dis-
tinguishing mark enabling the vocalist to be localized.
During the first few months, namely the summer of 1900,
after their arrival in my aviaries, they devoted themselves
chiefly to removing the stains of travel, and both moulted out
into a bright and clean plumage ; although unfortunately the
female has an injured wing, which prevents her from flying, an
injury for which I have since been rather grateful.
The aviaries being crowded at the time of their arrival, it
was not until last December that I was able to move them to a
sufficiently commodious apartment; but, being of a rather
sluggish nature, they did not seem to avail themselves of their

extra liberty as much as one would have expected, passing
most of their time close together on the same perch.
About the middle of April I noticed a * scrape ' in a
corner of the aviary. This ' scrape ' was placed in a small
recess open only above and at the end, and formed by two sides
of the aviary and a box placed to make a low nesting place.
Meanwhile, except that they hooted a good deal more,
there was but little change in the behaviour of the birds, who
were still to be seen side by side on the perch.
Nothing further occurred till, on the 2nd of May, the hen
was discovered sitting on an egg ; except for the slight
depression or ' scrape,' there had been no attempt at the
formation of a nest, and the egg was deposited on the bare
ground.
In two days a second egg was laid ; and incubation was
steadily proceeding when, one day, about a week later, both eggs
disappeared.
The cause of the disappearance is still a mystery ; they
were obviously stolen, and not eaten or destroyed by the birds
themselves ; but I was unable to satisfy myself as to whether the
thief was a rat or human. If the former, they must have taken
advantage of the female being off the nest, for she would
furiously resent any interference when sitting ; and even had she
been feeding, I doubt the rats' power to remove the two eggs,
entire and unbroken, over a clear space of some twelve feet to
the nearest hole, without being attacked ; be this as it may,
however, the fact remains that, on the 14th May, the eggs had
gone, and the female was standing disconsolately a few feet
from the nest.
By the next day matters were as usual, and both birds
seemed to have given up all thoughts of nesting ; I was, there-
fore, considerably surprised, when passing through the aviary 011
30th May, to see the female once more 011 the nest ; and the
following morning I found her sitting on one egg.
Two more eggs followed on this occasion, being laid with
a day's interval between each. They are like all Owls' eggs, pure
white in colour and of an uniform oval in shape, and somewhat
larger than those of our Tawny Owl.
The incubation was entirely carried on by the hen, who,
in fact, never seemed to leave her eggs, although I fancy she
probably did so in the still hours of night.

This time further precautions were taken ; and nothing
happened to prevent the successful hatching of two young birds
on the 5th Jul)^, after an incubation period of 35 days, or the
same as that of our European Eagle Owl. The third egg was
addled ; and the second youngster lived only a few hours.
When first hatched the young were covered with light
greyish down, and were assiduously cared for by the parents,
who both became rather savage. The male did not actually
attack an intruder, though, after much snapping of the bill and
many feints, he would occasionally make for one's face ; but, on
seeing an upraised arm, he would alter his course and settle
down again.
Not so however the female, who luckily could not fly, for,
like a flash of lightning, she would leave her young and attack
one&amp;apos;s boots and feet, with much energy but little result. Later
on, finding that their attacks produced no result, they confined
their somewhat rough attentions to snapping the bill ; but on
the least sign of intrusion the female would at once return to
the nest if she were away, and, needless to say, vigorously
protest against any interference with her child.
My Owls are always fed 011 lean raw beef, augmented with
rabbit, rats, or birds, as opportunity offers, generally about once
a week, and with a fast on Sunday ; during the rearing of the
young no especial change was made, except that &amp;apos; fur' was given
if possible three times a week, and there was no period of fast.
A few weeks after the young were hatched the male,
suddenly and for no ostensible reason, died. I was never able to
satisfactorily establish the cause of death ; but, as all his organs
were very much choked up with fat, it is probable that he had
dined ' not wisely but too well ' on the extra rations provided.
And now, as to the baby, who is the j&amp;apos;aisou d&amp;apos;etre of this
article. During the first few weeks of its life it grew apace,
and at three weeks old the wings were just beginning to grow,
although it was not till some time afterwards that the body
feathers came. The tufts of down, forerunners of the so-called
ears, were noticeable about the fourth week ; and the bird was
fully fledged at nine weeks old. Long before this period, how-
ever, the young Owl was quite capable of living without
parental aid, provided food was brought to it; and probably in
a state of nature the young are dependent on their parents for a
much longer period, until they gradually become sufficiently
adept at catching enough food to render them independent.

The baby is now quite grown up, and indistinguishable
from his mother. He does not take kindly to mankind, and on
their approach lowers his head, fluffs out his feathers, and snaps
his bill--an attitude in which he is depicted in the second of the
photographs, though luckily for the readers of this article his
language has had to be omitted.
The bird was about five weeks old when the first

SOUTH AFRICAN CAGE-BIRDS.

By Arthur G. Butler, Pli.D.
Several of our members, who wish, I suppose, to utilize
our South African trouble as a means towards a better acquain-
tance with the avifauna of that country, have, from time to time,
written to various members of the Council asking for an account
of the cage-birds either of S. Africa or some portion of that
country. After conference with our present Secretary I have
decided to make an attempt to supply this desideratum. ( a ).
In giving notes on these cage-birds it is not my purpose to
include Eagles, Ostriches, or any birds which cannot be kept in
a cage. One cannot well ask a friend to bring home a menagerie
of bulky birds when he returns from the seat of war, or even
from more peaceful pursuits in the colony: indeed to ask so
much would probably induce a disinclination to bring anything.
My own invariable experience has been that promises were
always plentiful, but results nil : yet I never asked for anything
either hard to obtain or difficult to import.
Commencing wlih the true Thrushes, which appear to have
hitherto escaped importation from the colon}', the species most
likely to be secured are the ' S. African Thrush ' (Turdus litsits-
irupa ), which is common in Damara and Great Namaqualand,
but appears also to be widely scattered over eastern S. Africa ;
the ' Natal Thrush ' (Turdusgyittalus&amp;apos;) which seems to be confined
to Natal; and the Olivaceous Thrush (Turdus olivaceus ), said to
be one of the commonest of the Cape species, but having a wide
range.
The Babbling-Thrushes (including the Bulbuls) seem to
offer many more suitable subjects for importation ; yet African
Bulbuls rarely find their way into European bird-markets. Some
(rt). The nomenclature followed is that of Sharpe and I.ayard's ' Birds of S. Africa,'
whence I have derived my facts. -- A. G. B.

of the commoner forms perhaps are not attractive as cage-birds--
either for plumage or song,--but others sing sweetly and are by
no means unpleasing in plumage. Of these birds the easiest to
secure would be the 'Yellow-bellied Bulbul' ( Crinigerflaviven-
tris ) which is a common bird about Durban ; the ' Cape Bristle-
necked Thrush' (Phyllastrephus capensis) said to be plentiful near
Swellendam, not uncommon to the east of Grahamstown, and
the commonest bush-bird about Durban; the Sombre Bulbul
(Andropadus importunus) which is not rare near Cape Town
and is known as the ' Boschvogel '; the Red-eyebrowed Bulbul
( Pycnonotus capensis) known as the ' Kuif-Kop,' which is common
throughout the colony ; the Black-eyebrowed Bulbul ( Pycnono -
tus tricolor), a good songster, which is common at East London
and occurs at Nel's Poort and many other places : it is captured
with ease when intoxicated through feeding on the overripe and
fermenting fruit of the Cape gooseberry.
In the Transvaal the Pied Babbling-Thrush ( Crateropus
bicolor) is common throughout the North ; Jardine's Babbling-
Thrush (C. jardinii) also occurs here and on the Tugela river,
and is common in the Beclniana and Matabele countries ; Kirk's
Babbling - Thrush (C. kirkii) is common near rivers in the
Zambesi ; the Dark-faced Babbling-Thrush (C. mclanops) may
daily be met with in Damara Land, is gregarious in its habits,
and very confiding.
Of the far more beautiful Rock-Babblers, the Rufous-
breasted Rock - Babbler is said to be widely distributed,
frequenting high elevations on stony sides of hills, where it
may be seen in small families of three or four individuals.
The Short-footed Rock-Thrusli is tolerably common in
Damara- and Great Namaqua-Lands, feeding on insects and soft
seeds: it is a prettily coloured and rather small bird, 6A- inches
in length ; the Cape Chat-Thrush (or Cape Robin) may be
abundantly met with in all the gardens in Cape Colony, as well
as in the pine woods; it is very confiding and a pleasing songster ;
this therefore is a bird which undoubtedly might be freely
imported.
Among the Chat-like birds the Southern Ant-eating
Wheatear is common at Port Elizabeth, but only in the
neighbourhood of ant-hills ; it would perhaps not be easy to
import, or feed in captivity; perhaps the most suitable of the
Wheatears for aviculture would be the Familiar Chat ( Saxicola
galtoni), which is widely distributed and to be met with at every
farm-house in the colony ; its local name is ' Speckvreter ' ; the

Capped Wheatear ( Saxicola pileaia), known to the Boers as the
' Schaapwachter,' which has a lovely song, is a clever mimic, and
consequently a general favourite ; it is found throughout the
colony.
I do not think it would be worth while to speak of the
Warblers of S. Africa, as these birds are never easy to keep ; and
would, I feel sure, be far less so to import, excepting perhaps
in a private steam-yacht; the Sun-birds also may I think be
profitably omitted from the present paper, with the exception
perhaps of the Tit-like little Cape White-eye ( Zosterops capcnsis )
which is common throughout the colony, and ought to be no
more difficult to bring over than the Chinese species: the Tits
and Flycatchers may also be passed over.
Of the Shrikes, the handsome pied species known as the
South African Long-tailed Shrike (Urolcsles me/anoleucus) might,
I think, be obtained ; as it has a tolerably wide range, and is
generably distributed, though somewhat local, thoughout the
bush-veldt (according to Mr. Thomas Ayres) : but undoubtedly
every possible effort should be made to secure the gorgeously
coloured Natal Bush-Shrike (. Laniarius quadricoloi &amp;apos;), which is not
uncommon in the dense bush along the coast: in colouring it
surpasses, to my mind, the charming Fruit-suckers of India.
Less beautiful, but still a handsome bird, is the Ruddy-breasted
Bush-Shrike (. Laniarius rubiginosus ), a most delightful songster,
which appears to be common at the Knvsna; the Bacbakiri
Bush Shrike (A. gutturalis), which is common at Cape Town and
Port Hlizabeth, would also be a desirable acquisition.
The Pied Wood-Shrike (. Bradyornis silens) is said to be a
sweet singer and clever mimic ; it is common about Rustenberg
and occurs less plentifully over the whole of the Cape Colony.
The African Drongo {Buchan^a assimilis) is plentiful throughout
the coast district of Natal; it is especially fond of bees, of which
it eats great quantities. The South African Black-headed Oriole
(Oriolus 1 arvahis ), which is common along the south-east coast
of the colony, might perhaps be imported without much
difficulty.
The Crows of South Africa appear to be neither numerous
in species, nor especially attractive.
Of the Starlings the abundant and widely distributed
Wattled Starling ( Dilophus carunculatus) should make a most
interesting cage-bird. As regards the Glossy Starlings, we are
all familiar with several in captivity. The Red-shouldered
Glossy Starling is abundant throughout the eastern parts of the

colony, and is very gregarious ; the Common Spreo (Sfireo
bicolor) is found everywhere, and congregates in small flocks;
frequenting grazing grounds to feed upon the insects attracted to
the dung of the cattle; and the Red-winged Spreo, or Cape
Glossy Starling (Amydrus morio), is equally widely distributed ;
it feeds chiefly on fruit, but is said to be also fond of small
mollusca aud crustaceans.
The preceding are all insectivorous or soft-food eaters ;
and I find that the)&amp;apos; have occupied so much space that I shall
have to reserve the account of other groups for subsequent
papers. A mere list of the birds would I think be of little

practical use ; and certainly would not be especially interesting
to many of our members. I may mention here that negro boys
are the most reliable bird-catchers in S. Africa; and a ' lickie&amp;apos;
(3d.) is their price for each bird caught: I do not know whether
I have correctly spelt the word.
BREEDING OF THE BLACK-HEADED OR NANDAY
CONURE.

The Nanday Conure is, I always think, an extremely
handsome bird ; his jet black head, and tail and wings tipped
with black against the brilliant contrast of vivid green, with the
scarlet stockings, make him a much admired bird in my aviary.
His harsh screaming voice is not attractive, and is his one
drawback; for he is most affectionate; and he and his wife are
more like the proverbial Lovebird, for they are never separated,
and always roost back to back in a hollow tree.
They commenced nesting rather late, about the beginning
of June, in a log nest composed of a portion of elm log, hollow,
and the ends boarded up, leaving a hole at one end. The hen bird
was never seen to enter the hole, and the nest remained only
conjecture for some time; but the cock always sat some feet
away, and screamed lustily if anyone approached.
They were much too clever, when the young were hatched,
to allow anyone to see them enter the log nest; and at last,
assured by my man who feeds the birds that they had not even
been near the nest for days, feeling sure they had deserted it, I
forced up one of the boards at the end of the nest and discovered

four fat young birds, with the quills showing black ends on their
heads, and their backs covered with quills with vivid green tips.
They were left absolutely alone for some time ; but finding
they did not fly I ventured to look in again, fortunately , for one
fully fledged young bird lay near the entrance, dead, with its
skull crushed by a heavy blow.
The three remaining birds flew in a few days, and were
carefully fed by the parents. They were taught at once to roost,
as the old birds did, in an upright hollow tree ; and it was pretty
to see the three young birds slowly lowering themselves into the
hollow, evidently hanging by their beaks inside, the old birds
occupying another limb of the same tree. They fitted in most
neatly ; and, as the tree is hollow to the bottom, with no foot-
hold for perching, I can only conclude they hang by their beaks.
They are now fully grown, and exactly like the parents. I could
see no difference between the sexes in the young birds while in
the nest.

BREEDING THE RING-NECKED PARRAKEET IN
AN OUTDOOR AVIARY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993912545454545" page_id="10104081"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
By G. C. Porter.
Having read that considerable success has been attained
by some aviculturists in breeding certain species of Parrakeets,
and being very interested in the Parrot family, I thought that I
would attempt to follow their example.
In January, 1900, I purchased a pair of Ring-necked
Parrakeets (Paltzornis torquata ) and placed them in an outdoor
aviary in April. The aviary is a lean-to, about a yard wide and
ten feet long, and was fitted with natural branches. I11 this I
suspended a four-and-a-half gallon barrel. The hen bird soon
began to persecute the cock in a most cruel manner, pulling out
most ot his feathers and worrying him from morning to night;
" hen-pecked " is a mild term to express her treatment of him.
O11 May 19th, she had a sharp attack of egg-binding, but
fortunately she dropped the egg on the bottom of the aviary.
On May 22nd, she laid an egg in the barrel, which she incubated
very assiduously, and brought off a fine young one on June 18th.
The hen did not exhibit any anxiety when I took it out of the
barrel for inspection.
Young Parrots, as Dr. Greene remarks, aie extremely ugly
little birds, the beak and head being of enormous size in com-
parison with the rest of the body ; this one was 110 exception to

<bodyText confidence="0.989937609756097" page_id="10104082"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
the rule: it made very good progress and is now finger tame,
and as large as its parents.
During the Winter the hen commenced to persecute the
cock again to such an alarming extent that, I firmly believe, she
would have killed him had I not interfered.
No doubt your readers have noticed the peculiar way the
hen scratches in the earth, forming holes and burrows of
considerable size. This, apparently, is only indulged in by the
hen ; the cock, as far as my experience goes, never does so.
Next year the hen laid again, on March 30th, but this
clutch of four, although fertile, were killed by a severe late frost.
The cock Ring-neck did not assist in incubation, but kept the
hen well supplied with food. A small supply of sponge-cake
and fruit was given, in addition to hemp- and canary-seed.
The hen laid two more eggs, from which two fine young
birds were hatched on June 1st, 1901 ; but one, when half grown,
crawled out of the hole and fell heavily on to the gravel below,
the result being instantaneous death : the other emerged from
the barrel in August, and was successfully reared. The hen
treated the young, on their entry from the barrel, in the cruel
way she treated the cock, so after a few days I removed them to
another aviary. These young birds make charming pets, if
taken early from the nest and tamed, allowing themselves to be
picked up and handled, yet showing absolutely no sign of fear.
Contrary to the experience of many writers, I have not
found the Ring-neck a very noisy bird ; the only time that they
do make a considerable amount of noise is when they see a cat,
and then their voices are somewhat penetrating. Altogether,
the Ring-neck has many points in its favour, being a quiet,
frugal bird, and it quite deserves its present popularity.
The young, for the first ) r ear, are much smaller than
their parents.
OUTDOOR AVIARIES.
By John Sergeant.
The shape, size and position of outdoor aviaries are so
often governed by the exigencies of space in our gardens that it
becomes a matter difficult of solution, what form to adopt in
construction. No odd corner, relinquished because one can get
nothing to grow there, will do ; the best and sunniest position
must be given up, or failure will result. The position should be
facing South, or S.-S.-Kast. An aviary I had faced South-East,
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999185209302325" page_id="10104083"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
and I found it successful ; still I think due South is best, unless
very well sheltered.
There is a diversity of opinion in regard to covering the
top of the flight, or leaving it open. I know one owner of a
large aviary who has had it roofed over, and vows that his birds
are healthier for it. On the other hand, I have never had any of
my aviaries entirely covered, and am not aware that my birds
suffered through it. The greatest objection, to my mind, to
having a roof over the flight is, that you are then unable, without
a great deal of labour in watering, to have grass and shrubs and
trees, and all the growing things that give to a well arranged
aviary the appearance of a woodland glade, and that enhances
its attractiveness a thousand fold. Compare a Parrakeet aviary,
with its bare whittled perches, to a mixed aviary, containing birds
comparatively harmless to vegetation, with ivy-covered walls,
lovely green sward and flourishing shrubs and trees ; and you
will at once understand what I mean. Of course the former
makes up to a certain extent by the brilliance of the plumage of
its occupants, but still there is something wanting, and that
something is greenery. Make the surroundings of your birds as
natural as possible, study their requirements, and success will
attend you.
I went the other day to look at an aviary recently erected
at a cost of over _#ioo by a Corporation, in one of their Parks.
The general idea of a long narrow flight, placed against a wall of
imitation rock work, down which in one place a small waterfall
was made, leading into a pool, was very good indeed ; but the
error of having a small dark house or shelter with a low
entrance, not half the height of the aviary, was made. I
prophesied, at the time, that the birds would not go into it, and
have since learned that it is being altered for that reason. The
house or shelter is useless as such, unless it is bright and cheerful.
The birds, except they are forced, in consequence of the food being
kept there, will never enter it, and most certainly will never
roost there ; and this will end by deaths amongst the more
delicate birds as the nights become colder.
The seed should always be kept in the house, as the birds
will become familiarised with the surroundings there, and are
more likely to roost inside ; but, unfortunately, there are
several objections to keeping the insectivorous bird food there,
not the least of which is that it becomes sour much sooner in the
close atmosphere of the house in summer. I, therefore,
recommend a wooden food-holder, made of #-inch pine, the
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999248523809524" page_id="10104084"  page_num="49" year="" vol="">
top, or roof, in the form of a pyramid. Underneath, is fixed a
square platform to hold the food dish ; surrounded on the four
sides by a perch. Mine was suspended from the top of the
aviary by its apex, and the pyramidal roof overhanging the food
saucer on all sides, the food was kept clean and dry, and--being
entirely in the open, though sheltered from sun and rain--very
seldom went sour ; and it also had the advantage of being quite
inaccessible to mice. To take away from the bareness of this
food-holder, and to add to its picturesqueness, the wooden roof
could be thatched with heather, and very pretty it would
look.
The drinking fountain is one of the details, and a very
essential one, upon which a great amount of thought can be
profitably expended. If you have water laid on and are able to
have an outlet to a drain, then the whole thing is at once reduced
merely to the question as to what form the receptacle has to take,
whether merely a zinc dish let into the ground, a picturesque
concrete pool, or a fountain of the conventional type. Whatever
you have, or however arranged, try and avoid any possibility of
the water becoming foul, have every portion accessible for a good
scrubbing periodically, as foul water engenders more disease than
any number of damp raw days. In regard to the general
arrangement of the aviary ; it is better to have the corners
covered in, and packed with pine tree loppings and birch branches,
amongst which large pieces of heather can be crammed, making
an almost impervious screen from the cold winds. In front of this
arrange growing shrubs, to hide the bare branches ; and against
the walls in the centre nail small logs and tree branches
longitudinally, and train ivy over them. The branches form
snug roosting and nesting places, much more so than if the ivy
was nailed flat against the wall.
The centre of the aviary should be laid down with grass;
and if there is room a fairly large tree might be planted in the
middle of the grass plot, but as this would not be required for
cover, it need not necessarily be an evergreen ; a pyramid apple
or pear would be very suitable. The grass should be regularly
mown and swept; the latter is most important, as it continually
freshens the surface and removes all objectionable matter.
A gravel pathway might be arranged alongthe front inside,
as, besides being beneficial for the birds to peck at, it affords a
pretty contrast with the grass.

MY FIRST AVIARY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983006515151515" page_id="10104085"  page_num="50" year="" vol="">
By Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S,
Some months ago it was suggested in the Avicultural
Magazine that members would be rendering a signal service, to
others of our Society who were inexperienced, if the}' would
furnish particulars of the construction of their several aviaries.
I have been hoping ever since that some one more experienced
than myself, would start what should be a very interesting as
well as an instructive correspondence.
Doubtless the secret of success in our pastime is the
suitable housing of our birds, and I venture to give a description
of one of my aviaries, not that I can tell you anything new, but
it may lead to criticism and suggested improvements which
would be of much use to many of us.
I have only taken up the study of foreign birds and their
treatment in confinement some three or four years, but must
confess my attack of avicultural fever was very acute and has
lasted some time now and continues to increase in severity every
day. A great friend of mine has to answer for my taking up this
hobby, as it was the fact of seeing his birds that made me wish
to start an aviary for myself.
The Californian Quails were my first favourites, and my
friend, seeing how very fond I was of these birds, gave me a fine
male, in grand plumage: and as soon as I arrived home I wrote
for a hen, which is now so tame that I can pick her up anywhere,
and she will follow me like a dog wherever I go. She has reared
five broods of lovely birds since I had her, and is now one of my
greatest favourites. However, to return to the aviary question :
Having the Quails, I set to work to make a home that I thought
would meet their requirements and protect them against our
variable climate, for, at this time, I was not aware of the hardi-
ness of this species.
I built my aviary as follows :--The outside dimensions are
16 ft. long, 12 ft. wide, 7 ft. from the ground level. The outside
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.394146" page_id="10104086"  page_num="51" year="" vol="">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998752627906977" page_id="10104086"  page_num="51" year="" vol="">
flight is 12 ft. by 12 ft., and the covered part 4 ft. from back to
front, by 12 ft. wide. The covered part is a lean-to, against a
brick wall. The roof is of wood, covered with felt, and has two
lights each measuring 4 ft. by 2 ft., which are made of Duroline
(a translucent material). The upper half of the ends and front
are glazed, the lower of wood. I11 the centre of the front is a
window, hinged at the top, which may be closed at will. At
the lower part of this window is another small hinged light
which is left open during cold weather, the larger one being
then closed. The wooden part of the front is composed of four
movable sections fixed in position by screw buttons, so that in
very hot weather it can be made into practically an open shed.
The inside is kept cool during very hot weather by means of a
ventilator at the upper part of each end.
Against the wall is nailed 2-inch wire netting reaching
from the roof to within 2 ft. of the ground, into the meshes of
which are inserted small branches which, altogether, make quite
a hedge, which is much appreciated by the smaller birds. The
aviary is furnished with the usual fixed, and swinging perches,
husks, German canary cages, nest pans, boxes, etc., for nesting
purposes. The flight has a good sized apple-tree in the centre,
with wire work stretched round the tree trunk, and bushes dotted
round about at various parts. The earth was dug out to a depth
of two feet, the hole being again filled alternately with clinker,
the stones sifted from gravel, cinder ash, and sharp sand. This
makes the drainage so complete that, an hour or so after even a
heavy rain, the sand is comparatively dry. The flight is
boarded around to a height of 2 ft.
Being anxious to study the habits of the different species I
usually buy several, and, when satisfied that I understand
sufficiently about them, replace them with others. I feel certain
there are many who kill their birds with pampering, and I find
the majority do better without heat if they have plenty of
exercise.
The majority of the commoner species will live well in an
aviary such as I have described, providing they have a liberal and
varying supply of good sound seed, green food, and insectivorous
food (with a fair proportion of hard boiled egg). Although not
a very pleasant pastime, I always breed gentles as long as I am
able, which, when well scoured, are readily eaten by almost all
my birds with benefit. Bread and milk, cuttle fish bone, and
above all a plentiful supply of fresh water should always be
given.

The best thing I ever did during my avicultural career
was to join our Society, and I have to thank Mr. Seth-Smith for
bringing it to my notice and proposing me. I also take this
opportunity of thanking Mr. R. Phillipps and Dr. Butler for the
advice they have kindly given me as to the treatment of birds
I should certainly have lost, without their sound practical advice.

REVIEW.
FANCY PHEASANTS*
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.92846446875" page_id="10104087"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
Mr. Frank Finn is well known to our members, and his
useful, and interesting articles which have appeared recently in
th e Feathered World have been, we are sure, highly appreciated
by them. The appearance, therefore, of these papers in book
form will be welcomed with much pleasure, as it makes a
valuable addition to avicultural literature.
The Pheasant tribe contains so many species, most of
which are easily kept and bred in captivity, and almost all of
which are of exquisite beauty, that it seems passing strange that
they are not studied more freely by aviculturists than they are
at the present time. We can only suppose that the lack of
knowledge as to their many attractive qualities, or of their
treatment in captivity, is alone responsible for their neglect by
the aviculturist.
Mr. Finn's book, which, by the way, is a marvel of cheap-
ness, will be found most useful as a guide to the keeping and
breeding of all the better known Pheasants, and their allies the
Pea-fowl, Jungle-fowl, etc.
The illustrations are, on the whole, good; some are
excellent, although one or two are poor.
BIRD NOTES.
Some few years ago the Government of New Zealand decided to set
apart a small island called Resolution Island, situated off the South-West
of the South Island, as a sanctury for the native avifauna of the country;
as many species, especially the remarkable wingless birds, were in danger
of rapidly becoming extinct. A caretaker was selected in the person of

According to a writer to the Field, Resolution Island has now become
a perfect Paradise for an ornithologist. The most numerous birds at the
present time appear to be the Kakapo, or Owl Parrot, a species which
rarely, if ever, flies, and the Weka-rail. Curiously enough, the Kakapo
breeds only every second year, being perfectly unanimous as to the time of
laying, no birds breeding in the off-season. The males announce the pair-
ing time by a peculiar drumming noise.
Mr. Henry has found the Wekas great thieves; they become extremely
tame and impudent, and some that had been fed on boiled fish were so much
so that he had considerable difficulty in driving them away into the bush.
The Kaka is said to make an excellent pet, and to be full of tricks.
Two were kept by Mr. Henry, each of which knew its name and came when
called.
Penguins are numerous on the island, as are also Kiwis, Roas,
Pigeons, Ducks, Tuis, Thrushes, Crows, and Saddle-backs.
Mr. Henry noticed that the native Thrushes, which are very tame, have
learnt to shell damp oats like Sparrows.
A specimen of the Carolina Crake (Porzana Carolina ) was shot in Tiree,
one of the Inner Hebrides, on Oct. 25th last. This appears to be the third
authentic record of the occurrence of this American species in Great
Britain. In the Field of Dec. 7th last, appeared two excellent, almost life-
size, drawings by Mr. Frohawk, showing very clearly the distinguishing
features between this species and the Spotted Crake (P. maruetta).
Snow Buntings have recently arrived on our South Coast in some
numbers, and the bird-catchers have taken a quantity. The method em-
ployed in their capture is the same as for other small birds--long nets and
a brace-bird. At the commencement of the season, however, there are no
decoy-birds to be had, so a difficulty presents itself. We are informed,
however, that a whitewashed Skylark is used, and answers the purpose
equally as well as a Snow Bunting.

An impression seems to prevail amongst our members, and the public,
that only those who keep birds in captivity are eligible to join our Society.
This is very far from being the case. All bird-lovers are heartily welcome,
whether owners of birds or not. Those who study the habits of wild birds
are specially welcome.
This reminds us that complaint is made that there is not more about
our birds in freedom to be learned through the Society. If some of our
members will take the hint, and help us by writing about birds, British or
foreign, in the wild state, we shall be particularly grateful.
On the other hand, it should not be overlooked that, when writing
of the birds in captivity, we often bring out details in the nature of species
which are practically undiscoverable by the field naturalist, immensely
valuable as his observations must ever be. The two studies should march
together hand in hand, the one complementing the other, both being
steadied aud guided by the work of the scientist. R. P.
THE ILLUSTRATIONS.
From letters received by the Secretary, it is evident that our members
have no idea of the amount of time and work involved in the production of
coloured illustrations. Some complain, in a very injured strain, that no
coloured plate appeared in the first number of the current volume.
We may explain briefly the process adopted for hand-coloured
illustrations. The artist (who is often a busy man, and not always able to
undertake w r ork just when he is wanted) has often to travel some distance
to the residence of the aviculturist who owns the subject of the illustration.
A drawing often takes several days to complete, and, as the artist is
generally unable to devote several days in succession to any one picture,
sometimes ten days, ora fortnight elapses before one drawing is completed.
When the water-colour drawings are finished, the next process is to
re-draw these on stone, a proceeding which again occupies considerable
time. It is desirable, for several reasons, that four pictures should be
drawn on one stone.
The lithographing finished, the plates have to be printed, proofs
submitted and approved; lettering put on, and lettered proofs again sub-
mitted for approval. When these are passed, the whole four can be printed
off (500 copies of each). When the printing is done, each plate has to be
hand-coloured; and, as the colourists are often busy with work for other
scientific publications, it is evident that some time must elapse before the
plates are read}&amp;apos; for the Magazine.
Since we undertook the arrangements for the illustrations, no pains
have been spared, and no time wasted, in pushing the coloured plates
forward as rapidly as possible.
At the present time we have four lithographed plates printed ; and, il
the colourists do not fail us, we hope to publish the first in our next
number. It is the intention of the Executive Committee to issue six-
coloured plates before November next, if possible.

unfairly with regard to the illustrations that we have, in three months,
issued no less than four black and white plates (two of which appear in this
number); and it is our intention to give several more in the present
volume, besides the aforesaid six hand-coloured plates.
Since the first of November last, the Magazine has also been printed
on better paper than formerly. Editor.
CORRESPONDENCE.
MISTLETOE BERRIES.
Sir, -- Can you tell me whether caged birds of any sort will eat
mistletoe berries? So far as my observation goes, and for nearly forty years
I have had exceptionally good opportunities of exercising it, the only one
of our wild birds that will take them is the Mistletoe Thrush. Certainly I
did once see one plucked by a Redbreast, but it was immediately dropped;
while I have known a Blackbird in a state of extreme destitution perch
within a couple of inches of a mistletoe berry and not offer to take it.
I hope you or some one will try whether any, and if so which, birds
will eat mistletoe berries. I think there can be no danger in making the
experiment as the Mistletoe Thrushes eat them so largelj&amp;apos; -- in fact all they
can get; but they will not touch them till they are fully ripe. We have
much mistletoe in the garden of this College--mostly on apple trees, but
there is some on hawthorns, and two large plants on a sycamore -- the first
I ever saw or heard of on such a tree.
I shall be very glad to learn what may be the result of offering
mistletoe berries to birds, but I believe they should be quite ripe -- and that
they generally are not before the end of January. I think the berries on
the mistletoe that is cut for Christmas never ripen at all, but gradually dry
up instead of deliquescing as those which are left on the plant do. ( b ).
Magdalene College, Cambridge. ALFRED NEWTON.
[Perhaps some of our members, especially those who keep British
birds, will experiment with the mistletoe berries, and let us know the
results. Some writers express a doubt as to the Mistletoe Thrush (or
Missel-Thrush as it is often called, a phonetic spelling of Mistle or Mistletoe
Thrush) eating them at all freely; but Professor Newton not only tells us
that it does, but adds the information that the berries must be fully ripe
--the rock perchance over which these writers stumbled. -- R. P.]
A BLOOD-THIRSTY MOCKING-BIRI) : IMPORTATION OF
FOREIGN BIRDS.
Sir,--I am quite sure you will be surprised to hear that the Mocking-
bird that we have had communications about before (see page 13 of current
(i) I have some orchards, the trees in which are covered with mistletoe as I have never
seen them elsewhere. Mistletoe Thrushes also abound in my grounds. Whether they eat
the mistletoe-berries late in the winter I can&amp;apos;t say they certainly do not touch them up to
Christmas, though they have already December 14th) nearly stripped my Vtws, Irish Yews,
and Honeysuckle of berries.--O. E. C.

Volume) lias the same blood-thirsty characteristics as Mr. Pliillipps'
Whistling-bird.
I had several accidents in the aviary that I could not account for,
often finding small birds lying about partly eaten. For some time I kept
my Mocking friend all to himself, but, when feeding him the other day,
a Goldfinch got in from the other compartment. I went away, and,
returning in about an hour, found the Goldfinch on the ground with its
head open, and brains completely devoured. I caught the Mocking-bird
afterwards chasing the smaller birds; he darts at them and catches them
with his legs, and kills them like a Hawk. He still has the cold; but I
will not despair of him as long as he is able to feed on Goldfinches and
Orange Bishops.
I wish some of our members would write about the importation of
foreign birds, and the various ports they are picked up at, and how and by
whom they are caught. H. B. Rathbokne.
[Noth.--T he question asked by Mr. Rathborne embraces too much
ground for any one person to be acquainted with. Hr. Butler's article in
this number deals with a somewhat kindred subject as regards the birds of
South Africa. Perhaps some other of our members may be able to give
us information concerning birds coming from different parts of the
world.--R. P.]

NESTING OF THE BRACK-HEADED GOURDI AN FINCH.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994675730769231" page_id="10104091"  page_num="56" year="" vol="">
SIR.-- Several of our members have succeeded in raising the beautiful
Gouldians, and from time to time accounts have appeared of the nesting.
Each record adds somewhat to one&amp;apos;s knowledge as to the ways and means
by which this happy result may be attained. I therefore take up my pen
in the hope that what I have to tell may contain some little hints that may
be of use to others.
First, it seems to me absolutely necessary that Gouldian-finches
should be perfectly strong and thoroughly acclimatized before they are
allowed to go to nest, or clear eggs only are the result. 1 tried, and failed
again and again with somewhat newly imported birds; but this season I set
to work more hopefully, as my two hen Black-heads had been in England
over two years. I had a good healthy cock ; and a member of our Society
kindly supplied me with another that had been raised in his bird-room.
I gave my Gouldians--and a pair of Diamond Sparrows--a small
garden aviary to themselves. It was late in May before they were put in,
and verv soon after they began to moult. The moulting over, they fussed
about so long over the choice of a nesting-place that the best part of the
summer passed before any progress was made.
For nesting material my Gouldians have invariably chosen a fine
sort of grass that grows on heath land ; and without this, it seems to me,
they would not build at all--they use this and nothing else. The nests
being built, eggs were laid, the sitting commenced, and in due course the
sound of chirps from many voices came from both nests.
Unfortunately they were too close together, one nest being just
above the other : the hen of the upper one began chasing the other, and
preventing her from going to feed the young. I hoped the cock would

carry them on, lie tried hard ; but I suppose they were too many for him ;
and very soon, to my great disappointment, I found that the chirps from
that nest had ceased. The others throve without a hitch, and cries from
baby Gouldies grew stronger and stronger, until on October 31st two strong
little grey birds appeared, and were followed the day after by three more.
The plumage of all five is as glossy and smooth as can be, and all were
able to fly strongly from the first moment they left the nest.
And now as to food--it was simple enough, consisting only of canary
and millet seed--the latter being the large white millet, as it is more
sustaining than the small Indian kind that is sold in the ear. With these
seeds they gave their young a quantity of cuttle-fish, and were liberally
supplied, three or four times a-day, with road-side or lawn grass in seed. In
the aviary is a lump of rock-salt, and I frequently saw them peck at this.

BLUE-BIRD AND AMERICAN CAT-BIRD.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990832285714286" page_id="10104092"  page_num="57" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I have a Blue Robin that has been in perfect health for the last
three years, but, since the moult, he has not regained his tail- or wing-
feathers, but is, in all other ways, perfect.
Will you kindly let me know how best to treat him ? He has been
fed on dried flies, auts' eggs, hard-boiled egg and biscuits, and crumb of
bread and a few currants at times, besides other fruits.
Since I have noticed that he has not regained his feathers, I have
been giving him three mealworms each day, in a cage by himself.
I am having an American Cat-bird sent me within the course of the
next few days, and should be glad to know how best to feed it, and if this is
the correct name. H. W. Burgess.
The following answer was sent to Mr. Burgess :
All that you can do with the Blue-bird is to keep it warm, give plenty
of insect-food, mealworms, cockroaches, (or spiders if you can find any);
also about eight drops of syrup of phosphates in the drinking-water.
I think you are making a mistake in giving grocers' currants to your
birds : they r are very tough-skinned fruit and difficult of digestion.
The American Cat-bird (Guleoscoptes carolinensis) in its wild state
feeds upon many forms of insect life, upon worms, slugs, and snails, also
upon small fruits and berries.
In captivity it maybe fed like the Mocking-bird, upon ' Century food,'
or crushed biscuit, yolk of egg, ants' eggs, and dried flies, made into a
slightly damp or crumbly mixture either with a sprinkling of water, by
adding mashed boiled potato, or grated carrot.
Sweet-water grapes, orange, over-ripe pear, stewed apple, ripe
currants or strawberries when in season, may be given ; and a few meal-
worms or some other insect food should certainly not be overlooked.

Each bird must lie forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing&amp;apos; the fullest particulars of
the case.
If a reply by post (in addition to any Report that may appear in the Magazine) be required,
a stamped and addressed envelope must likewise be sent.
BENGALESE. (Mr. A. K. Boothroyd). Found dead in straw nest: has never
seemed very well.
[Death was due to an abdominal tumour pressing on the artery that
comes directly from the heart, which was much dilated. The immediate
cause of deatli was heart failure.]
Cordon Bleu, female. (Mrs. H. M. Metcalf.)
[Apoplexy was the cause of death ; the bird was extremely fat].
Al^RIO Finch, female. (Miss West). Looked ill for some time ; for a few
days was better, but had a relapse. Showed signs of loss of breath,
puffiness, and weakness.
[Cause of death--tuberculosis ; one lung and the liver being full of
tubercular deposit.]
BENGALESE, male. (Miss Hodgson). Did not seem to ail until a few days
before death.
[Cause of death -- congestion of the liver and bowels, caused probably
by chill.]
Cockatiel, male. (MissR. Alderson). Had been ill two days, but had not
looked very bright for some time. Taken suddenly ill on Dec. 4th ; on
the 5th could hardly stand; breathing became gradually more difficult
before it died.
[Your Cockatiel suffered from cerebral haemorrhage (apoplexy). No
doubt he had fits, although you did not see him in them. The last attack
of haemorrhage was so severe that it caused death by&amp;apos; pressure on the brain
substance, which caused the want of co-ordination of muscular movements].
Pekin Robin. (Mr. H. W. Burgess).
[Death was due to haemorrhage from the liver which was ruptured,
probably&amp;apos; by external violence. It may have resulted from the bird flying
against a perch.]
Californian Quail, male. (Miss B. Shepherd). Died suddenly; had
been fed on canary- and millet-seed, oats, ants' eggs, egg-food, and
mealworms.
[Death l-esulted from acute inflammation of the bowels, probably the
result of a chill. I find Californian Quails do best on canary-, millet-, and
a little hemp-seed, dari, wheat, and a plentiful supply of green food;
preferably, chopped grass. Soft food, with egg and mealworms, is too
fattening and stimulating.]
Redrump ParrakeeT, male. (Mrs. Johnstone). Was bred in aviary
last year; looked a little puffy, which was attributed to severe
weather. Suggested malformation of lower mandible, which appeared
to protrude beyond the upper when found dead.
[The cause of death was pneumonia; there was no malformation of
the mandible; the appearance you describe is common with Parrots after
death ; it occurs during the death struggle.] Arthur Gill-

So popular is the Parrot-finch with those who have kept
it, and so admired is it by all, that I have little doubt the illustra-
tion which appears this month will be highly appreciated by our
members.
This lovely Grassfinch is, unfortunately, at the present
time far rarer in this country than we could wish it to be,
although during the winter of 1897-8 quite a number were
imported, several of which reproduced their kind in the aviaries
of various aviculturists in different parts. But it has, apparently,
nearly died out amongst us, and probably few of our members
own breeding pairs at the present time. This is greatly to be
regretted as the species is a most desirable one for culture in our
aviaries, and is by no means delicate.
I believe our member, Mr. August F. Weiner, was the first
to breed the Parrot-finch in England, many years ago, since
which this most desirable event did not, I believe, again take
place until 1898, when young were reared in Eondon by Mr.
Phillipps, and in Yorkshire by Mr. St. Ouintin (see Vol. IV.
page 199, and Vol. V. page 20), although, in France, Mr. A.
Savage reared several young the year before this, four of which
eventually came into the present writer's possession.
I have never attained success in breeding this species,
although nests were built and eggs laid. My pair would sit
splendidly until just before the eggs were due to hatch, when they
deserted and commenced building another nest. The eggs, in
even 7 case, were found to contain young.
One often succeeds in breeding birds the second year,
although failing to do so the first year, and I quite hoped that I

<bodyText confidence="0.999648214285714" page_id="10104097"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
should eventually be rewarded for my trouble by succeeding in
rearing some young Parrot-finches ; but, alas, these hopes were
never realized, for a horrible stove, which was used for heating the
aviary, went wrong one night, and my fine pair of Parrot-
finches, besides a large number of other birds, succumbed to the
fumes.
The sexes of this species are alike in plumage, and it is no
easy matter for a novice to select a true pair. A practised eye
can, however, usually succeed in doing so, as the cocks generally
have a rather more masculine appearance, and are, if anything,
a shade brighter in colour than their mates. It has also been
stated that the colour of the legs differs in the sexes; but I doubt
if this is always the case. I noticed no difference in this respect
in my pair.
White millet and canary-seed form the staple food of the
Parrot-finch in captivity, but it is decidedly fond of insects of
various kinds, and insect food should be frequently given in
some form. Green food, such as flowering grass and chick-
weed, should be freely supplied in the summer, but the latter
must be given with extreme caution during the winter months.
The subject of this paper is one of the nicest finches that
one can wish to possess, that is providing a s 0 ;^-bird is not
required, as its vocal powers are very limited. It is almost
unsurpassed for beauty of plumage, never seems to mope or be
unhappy, but is always cheerful and happy and becomes very
tame. One that I had took mealworms from my hand without the
least fear.
This species is a native of the island of New Caledonia.

(Continued from fi. 45.)
I now pass on to the more easily imported and more
generally known seed-eating birds, commencing with the typical
Weavers.
As one would expect, from the resemblance which exists
between the young, females, and winter plumage of the males, to
that of the Sedge Warblers ( Acrocephalus ) most of these birds
frequent reeds and rushes ; but that this rule is not invariable
will be evident from the fact that the Olive and Yellow Weaver

(Hyphanturgus olivaceus), which is a common Southern species,
is said " to build indiscriminately over the driest spots, or over
water." The .Eastern form of the Black-headed Weaver
( Hyphantornis nigriceps) occurs in Natal ; but if it takes after its
relative //. viclanocephalus I would not care to have it. The
Western form is extremely spiteful and liable at any time to kill
the smaller species by one blow of its powerful beak ; indeed my
male of //. melanocephalus killed seven or eight Orange and
Napoleon Weavers in this manner a little over a year ago. The
Spotted-backed Weaver (//. spilonotus) also occurs in Natal,
in Grahamstown, King William's Town, etc. The Black-fronted
Weaver (//. velatus), which is very destructive to cereals in
Natal, is frequently imported ; like most of its kind it builds its
nest among reeds : my specimen spends its days in quarrelling
with the Black-headed bird.
As soon as the Orange River is crossed a very striking
species becomes abundant,--the White-browed Weaver ( Plocei-
passer mahali) which would be well worth importing; it builds in
mimosas and is said to be a most melodious songster--a marvel
among the usually harsh-voiced Weavers !
Of the so-called " Bishops," the well-known Grenadier
Weaver ( Pyromelana oryx) is said to be not uncommon ; but
local, though distributed over the whole colony, frequenting only
swampy places on the banks of rivers where it suspends its nest
among the flags.
The Yellow-shouldered Weaver ( Pyromelana capensis) and
its smaller race ( P. xanihomelas) are found in many parts of
S. Africa, the larger and best known form being common near
Grahamstown. I have never purchased this bird because I saw
how aggressive it was in Mr. Abrahams' bird-room.
The Taha Bishop (Z 3 . taha) is allied to the well-known
Napoleon Weaver and is very destructive to cornfields : it is
found commonly in marshy places and ditches, among the reeds,
from the Modder River to Potchefstroom.
The Red-billed Weaver ( Quelca quelea) is already so freely
imported, and so cheap, that it is hardly a fit subject for the
private importer. Of the Whydah-birds the Ultramarine-finch
is also hardly worth importing, for the same reason ; but the
well-known Long-tailed Whydah ( Chera progne) is still far too
little imported ; it is common in many parts of S. Africa and
could easily be obtained in numbers by the negro children. The
Red-collared Whydah ( Vidua ardcns) is said to be common near

King William's Town and Eland's Post, audit occurs in other parts
of Eastern S. Africa ; the well-known Pin-tailed Whydah
( Vidua principalis ) is probably too familiar to aviculturists to be
worth importing.
The Bronze Mannikin ( Spermes/es cucullata&amp;apos;), which is
usually imported from the West Coast, has been seen in
abundance in Grahamstown. The Red-headed-finch (.Amadina
erythrocephala&amp;apos;) is local, and appears not to occur very far to the
South, but it is found in Griqua Eand, Namaqua and Damara
Lands, the Transvaal, etc., and in some places is very common.
Among the Waxbills, the Red-faced-finch (Pytclia melbai)
is believed to be strictly a bird of the interior ; it occurs in pairs,
and is not uncommon on the Crocodile River and in the Rusten-
berg district; it has also been met with on the Limpopo,
Matabeli, Damara, and Great Namaqua Lands. The common
Gold-breasted (or Zebra) Waxbill has been seen near Maritzburg,
but is too freely imported already to be worth troubling about ;
Dufresne's Waxbill (Estrelda dufresnii) is found near Grahams-
town, Natal, &amp;c., but in small numbers, not more than
eight or ten being seen together. The Southern Grey Waxbill
IE. incana) has been found in Natal, but not commonly, but the
so-called St. Helena Waxbill (A. astrilda ) is met with in prodigious
flocks throughout the colony.
The much prized Violet-eared Waxbill (Uueginthus
granatimis&amp;apos;) is tolerably common in the Transvaal, along the
Limpopo, and in Damara Land; two or three of the extremely
delicate African Fire-finches (. Lagonosticta ) also occur in S.
Africa, but the importation of these Waxbills must always be
unsatisfactory, and their price in this country is so moderate that
it is hardly worth while to trouble about them.
Of the typical finches the Alario will probably always be
a favourite on account of its sweet song; it is obtainable at Port
Elizabeth and many other localities, and my friend, Mr. Distant,
of "The Zoologist," got a specimen in the Transvaal which he
brought home with him (I believe it died in 1901). The Cape
Sparrow {Passer arcuat us), of which our Editor recently gave us an
illustrated account in the Magazine, is well worth importing; it
is somewhat local in S. Africa, but has been met with not far
from Grahamstown and in various other localities. The Streaky-
headed Grosbeak {Poliospiza gularis ) may be obtained in Natal,
but it is not a specially attractive bird, and it is doubtful whether
it has any song. The common Green Singing-finch is too easily

obtained in this country to be worth troubling about, and the
White-throated Seed-eater is not a pleasing cage-bird, but is
common at Colesberg, and obtainable at Port Elizabeth. The
widely distributed and common Sulphur Seed-eater, the " Geel
Savsie " of the Colonists, is rarely imported, and though hardly
as pretty as our hen Greenfinch, and with not a very fine song,
might be worth bringing home. The St. Helena Seed-eater, the
" Kleine Seisje " of the Colonists, is abundant and gregarious
throughout the Colony, and ought to be, but is not, largely
imported ; it is the best songster of all the larger Serins and the
most beautiful. The Cape Canary ( Set inns canicollis) is common
throughout the Colony and would be worth importing to cross
with the domesticated Canary, as it produces good songsters
when thus hybridized. The Totta Siskin, known as " Pietje
Canarie," which has, of late, been imported from the Cape, is
another common and easily obtainable species, the male of which
is said to breed readily with hens of the familiar cage-Canary.
Of the Buntings, the Cape Bunting ( Fringillaria capensis)
could doubtless be secured ; it is rather an effectively coloured
bird ; the Eark-like Bunting (E. impetuani) is common about
Nel's Poort and has " a short lively song." It has been obtained
at King William's Town. The pretty Gold-breasted Bunting {F.
flaviventris ) may be obtained near King William's Town, Grahams-
town, Eland's Post, Natal, and is common on the Linipopo, in
Masliona and Damara Lands.
Some years since I called attention to the fact that all
Larks are largely seed-eaters; now in the case of the Finch-
Larks of Africa (. Pyrrhulauda ) the food consists almost entirely,
or entirely, of seeds. The only species of Pyrrhulauda hitherto
imported would seem to be the White-headed Finch-Lark
(. P. verticalis ), specimens of which have been in the possession of
the London Zoological Gardens. It is common near Colesberg
and in Damara and Great Namaqua Lands. Smith's Finch-Lark
(P. smithii ), which occurs at Colesberg, on the left bank of the
Orange River, and is common on the banks of the Limpopo
might doubtless be secured, as well as the Dark-naped Finch
Lark {P. ausifalls), which is found near King William's Town ant
is plentiful near Colesberg. I do not, however, think that these
sombrely-coloured little birds will ever be very popular amongst
aviculturists, as the}^ do not seem to be gifted with song.
Of the Long-billed Larks; Smith's Lark ( Certhilauda
game la), said to be a very noisy bird, might be obtained in the
northern parts of the Colony ; the Grey-collared Lark ( Alcemon

semilorquuta) is found near Graliamstown ; the Cape Lark ( A.
nivosa) is plentiful at Nel's Poort, in the Karroo, and in Little
Naraaqua Laud, These birds feed upon seeds and insects.
The Rufous-capped, or Red-headed Lark ( Tephrocorys
cinerea ) is common throughout the Colony. If imported it
should be plentifully supplied with grit, as it is said to swallow
much gravel with its food.
Another abundant bird is the Thick billed Lark ( Calendula
crcissirostris), a handsome species which ought, I should think, to
be a singer, although Messrs. Sharpe and Layard say nothing
about its notes. The prettily-coloured Bar-tailed Lark is said to be
common at Port Elizabeth and would make an interesting Show-
bird, though its vocal utterances seem to be limited to a long
shrill " phew," most appropriate to the warm sandy spots which
it delights in. The Rufous-naped Lark ( Mira fra africana ) is
generally seen in pairs between Algoa Bay and Graliamstown ;
it occurs in Natal, where it is difficult to flush, as it runs with
great rapidity. At Port Elizabeth it is rare, in the Transvaal
it is tolerably plentiful to the west of Potchefstroom.
Among the Pipits the Cape Long-claw ( Macronyx
ccipensis), which both mews and sings, is very common in Natal.
Port Elizabeth, East London, and the Kuysna district, also locally
in the Transvaal. The Red-breasted Long-claw (/If. amelia ),
which is a handsome bird, also occurs on marshy flats along the
coast of Natal. The commonest of the S. African species,
however, is said to be the Cinnamon-backed Pipit, which is found
in abundance all over the Colony. The tiny Short-tailed Pipit
(A?ithus brachyurus&amp;apos;), a terrestrial bird which always alights on
the ground, is a common summer bird in Natal ; it is said to
make a charming aviary pet
Of the Wagtails,* an abundant species throughout the
Colony is the Cape Wagtail ( Motacilla cape?isis) ; it has a pretty
song. The Blue-headed Wagtail (. Budytes Jlava) appears in the
Transvaal in considerable numbers in the spring.
I must reserve the Doves, Game-birds, etc., for my next
paper.
(To be Concluded/.
*These are unavoidably included in the present papers, though purely insectivorous
(or at any rate not granivorous) birds, inasmuch as they belong to the same family with
the partly granivorous Pipits.--A. G. B.

By Rosie Alderson.
It is with much pleasure that I write about mv little Orange-
cheeked Waxbills rearing their young ones, because they were
bred in a cage , not in the open aviary ; and this, I think, should
be a great encouragement to those who have only a limited space
in which to keep their birds. My pair of Orange-cheeks cost
5/6, and came from Mr. R. Green, of Covent Garden, from whom
I also obtained my breeding Lavender Finches.
It was in April, 1898, that they arrived, in perfect condition
and plumage, and I turned them loose in an aviary with other
small birds as companions. Since then the Orange-cheeks have
made many nests, but this is the first year that they have
successfully brought off their young ones.
I have no notes about them the year they arrived, but
during 1899 they were very busy making nest after nest (chiefly
of hay or grass stems) on the floor. They began in April, and
must have made about six nests ; but it was not until the end of
June that I knew for certain there were any eggs. This time
there were either three or four laid, and the birds seemed to sit
well, though the} 7 always flew off the nest when I went into the
aviary. They are such nervous little birds, and directly I entered
a little red beak would come peeping out, and in a moment the
bird would fly off the nest, only to return when I had gone. But
this nest that promised well was a failure like the others, I do not
know why.
Next year (1900) it was the same thing over again. Three or
four nests were built, and each time the birds were disturbed or
deserted. In one egg I found a fully formed young bird. I could
see its beak, eyes, and even some dark spots in its throat. The
third year passed and still no young ones ; and I determined
that, all being well, another season we would find some means of
doing better.
Last April my brave little birds began to build again, and
as usual the nest was disturbed at once, this time by a Bronze
Mannikin. I felt very indignant, and decided I would catch up
the Orange-cheeks and cage them. They could do no worse in
a cage than they had done already, and at least they would be
undisturbed. I have several large wooden cages let out of the
walls of the aviary. Though it makes the outside shape of the

<bodyText confidence="0.999280325581395" page_id="10104103"  page_num="66" year="" vol="">
aviary rather irregular, I prefer it to having extra cages inside on
the aviary floor, where they take up much room. This particular
let-out cage is 36m. by 2iin. by 2iiu. high. It has three sides of
woodwork, with a strip of glass in the back for extra light, and a
wire front. High up at one end of this cage I fastened a very small
wooden travelling cage, amongst some thick bits of Scotch fir,
and hung a curtain over part of the wire front so as to screen the
end where the nest was. Having completed these arrangements I
caught the Orange-cheeks and put them in their new quarters.
But fora time everything seemed a failure. Nest after nest was
made in the box, and eggs were laid. Once the eggs were
hatched, and a brood reared until they must have been a fortnight
old ; and then they were all thrown out of the nest, and found
dead on the sand tray. One young bird was quite large and
covered with grey down, the quill feathers in its wings just
coming.
It was really very trying, and I began to lose my sympathy
for the Orange-cheeks ; and, being much taken up just then with
my new aviary, I gave them but little attention.
I left home the latter part of August; and, while I was away
my birds' attendant, George Hallam, who had always been
greatly interested in the Orange-cheeks, emptied the nest of all
the old materials ; and at once it was evident what was wrong,
for the nest was badly infested with red mite. My man painted
the box thoroughly with Fir Tree oil (a thing I ought to have
done at first, but stupidly I associated red mite only with
Canaries), and gave the birds some fresh material in the shape of
hay and feathers. They at once set to work and began a new
nest, and by the next day it was finished.
I came home on the 14th September, and found that the
Orange-cheeks had then been sitting well for about a week. Some
two days later I began putting cut up mealworms in a small
saucer in the cage, being careful to always leave some over-night,
in case the young should hatch before morning. I did this
regularly night after night, and kept up the supply in the day as
well. Many of the mealworms were eaten, but whether by the
old birds or young ones I could not tell. I never saw them carry
any to the nest, so possibly they fed the young from the crop
from the first.
And now ensued a weary time of waiting. The old birds
still kept to the nest, and ate a quantity of mealworms, though I
noticed they did not seem to care for the heads, but nearly always
left them. Day after day passed and still no sign, until, when

<bodyText confidence="0.999264139534884" page_id="10104104"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
nearly a month had gone by, I began to think the Orange-cheeks
were playing a heartless practical joke on me, and that all the
dozens of mealworms I had given them through the summer
was so much money wasted.
When the second week in October arrived, I sternly
determined I would not be imposed on any longer ; I would give
them a few days more grace, and, if no young ones appeared by
then, the nest should be taken away.
Now the nest-box was in such a position that we could not
see into it properly; but the little birds evidently thought we
could, for, on October 12th, they drew a very large feather right
across the entrance hole, evidently determined not to allow our
curiosity to be satisfied a moment sooner than they chose.
Next day was Sunday, and imagine my surprise and
delight when my man sent in word, first thing in the morning,
that two little Orange-cheeks were out of the nest. You may be
sure I was soon down at the aviary to see them, and felt that all
our patient waiting was fully rewarded. The parents were in a
great state of excitement and pride ; and really I do not wonder,
for the babies were the very sweetest little things I have ever seen--
so small and dainty, and scarcely larger than a large " grand-
father" bumble bee. Their backs were soft mouse colour, and
breasts grey. Their tails were short and spread like fans, and were
dark with a patch of dull red at the root ; legs and feet grey, beak
black or nearly so, with a tiny spot of white skin at each side, and
eyes very dark and bright. Both birds were fully feathered, and
one distinctly showed the orange cheek-marks. I11 colouring the
young birds were really very like their parents, but in darker
shades. It was most amusing to see how the little things jerked
their tails just in the same way as the old birds. I put a cosy
nest-box on the floor of the cage, and the young birds seemed
very glad to nestle in it, for it was a long climb back to the
old nest.
But the Orange-cheeks had still another pleasant surprise
in store for us. Next day two more young ones appeared, and
the parents' pride in the quartette knew no bounds. The four
made the prettiest little picture ; they would all sit nestling
together on the floor in a row, peeping out at me with their
bright eyes in a most fearless way. They were very precocious ;
I saw one feeding on spray millet almost at once, and another
could fly well about the cage directly it left the nest.
I think the old ones fed them, too, with seed, for some white
millet was seen in the crop of one young one ; but strangely

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999478348837209" page_id="10104105"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
enough I only saw them being fed once, and that was when they
were considerably older. All four birds looked strong and
healthy, though one had its toes curled up, but apart from this
defect it looked perfectly well; they all learnt to fly very soon.
For eleven days the little family flourished, and then one young
one began to look ruffled and ill. Some olive oil seemed to do it
good, but it died rather suddenly a day or two later. (Dr.
Butler very kindly reported ou it--see page 36 of present
volume).
To add to my misfortunes, a second young one suddenly
lost all power of flight, and could not even get on the perch. It
was a very fine bird, and looked in the best of health. So now
out of the four I had only one perfect bird left, for the third
seemed crippled, though looking otherwise quite healthy.
I came to the conclusion that I had better let them all
loose in the aviary, so turned them out of the cage and took
down the nest. It was very dirty inside, and full of red mite,
and several small insects, very shiny and black. There was one
old egg in the nest, and one fresh one. The eggs are pure
white, very pretty, rounded at each end, and about the size of a
green pea.
The Orange-cheeks were delighted to get their liberty, and
at once flew into the branches. I tied a long bare branch from
the floor to one of the upper boughs, and in this way the little
one who could not fly managed to climb up and join the others-
It was very pretty to see the old birds encouraging it, and
showing it the way. Sometimes when it was patient it got up
without mishap, but sometimes it would try and go too fast and
tumble off, when, like King Bruce's spider, it would have to try
again.
Occasionally I caught it, and put it with its family amidst
much rejoicing. I put a little nest-box filled with hay and
feathers on the floor, and the delicate young ones (who kept
much together) frequently used it to nestle and sleep in. Of
course, during the first few days I turned off the running
water ; and also, when they first left the nest, I took away the
bath, for fear they should fall in and be drowned.
About a month after they left the nest, I lost the young
bird with the crippled feet. I was in the aviary at the time, and
heard something fall behind me, and on turning round found the
poor little thing dead on the floor. Only a minute before it had
looked perfectly well, and its feet had much improved, and were
getting quite strong and straight. It was a very bonnie little

<bodyText confidence="0.998945238095238" page_id="10104106"  page_num="69" year="" vol="">
bird, and the prettiest of the three. I sent its body to Mr. Gill,
who very kindly reported on it in the December number.
On hearing that its death was due to injury, I determined
to move the Orange-cheeks back to their old aviary, for the one
in which they were at this time was also inhabited by many
larger birds than themselves ; and now that my suspicions were
aroused I began to find many other conclusive proofs. The
dead bird's tail had been plucked out earlier, and the old birds
and the strongest young one were rapidly getting into very bad
plumage, though at first I put this down to moulting. I have
since found out that the culprit was a new arrival, a Red-crested
Cardinal. After I had moved some of the Orange-cheeks, I
found out that it pecked many of the other birds, though, strange
to say, a Lavender Finch and Cordon Bleu remained untouched.
It was only by watching in the aviary porch that I discovered
this. Sometimes one can learn more from ten minutes' quiet
observation than by passing in and out a hundred times.
And now a very curious thing happened ; after the
Orange-cheeks were put back in their old aviary, the young
one that could not fly for so long began gradually to regain
the use of its wings, and it can now fly quite well again.
It is a very handsome bird, and the larger of the two. The other
one is strong and healthy, but at present is not in very good
feather. I suppose the young ones will now be ten or eleven
weeks old ; and the finer bird can hardly be distinguished from an
adult specimen ; perhaps it may be a shade darker, and the beak
not quite such a clear red, but that is all the difference. The
colour of their beaks began to change when they had left the
nest about a week.
I gave egg biscuit (crushed) and maw seed mixed dry (the
birds were very fond of the latter item), various grass seeds,
canary, Indian, and Italian millet, flowering grass, and an
abundance of spray millet, which they delight in. Besides this,
they had cut-up mealworms, and a few aphides off the rose trees.
The parents seem to have lost much ol their interest in the
nestlings ; but the young birds are devoted to each other. I saw
lately Orange-cheeks could be had for as little as 26 a pair.
Were I to begin again I would tie a small nest-box (with a
hinged back) to the outside of the wire front--bending the wires
just in front of the entrance hole to allow the birds to enter. If
the back of the nest-box had a small piece of glass let in, it
would be all the better ; it could have a little cloth fastened to

overhang the glass, and in this way the nest could be kept clean,
and quiet observations made when the birds were off the nest
without disturbing them.
A DRY BATH CAGE; WEAVERS IN CAGES.
By A. A. Pearson.
A note from the Editor, petitioning members to help him
by sending something to edit, induces me to take up my pen at
the risk of feeling very unimportant alongside the interesting
communications of the experts and veterans of our Society,
which some of us just devour. Perhaps there are others who,
like myself, for one reason or another, have had to be content
with cages, and peruse the descriptions of members' aviaries with
somewhat envious feelings. I think, however, that five years'
study of birds iu cages has given me a more detailed knowledge
of them than if they had been at liberty in a large area. In good
sized cages they can be kept in perfect health and feather, by
good food, ventilation, cleanliness, and regular bathing; and
when the cages are enamelled a suitable quiet colour, the wires
blackened, and tree branches for perches, they show off to much
better advantage than in aviaries. The drawback is the time
occupied in cleaning and bathing. To obviate the latter I
designed a cage which permits a bath to remain in all day without
even a splash on the sand tray. At the bottom corner, close to
the wooden side, and alongside the sand tray, is a partition or
compartment into which slides a drawer 9 inches long by 5 inches
wide, and 4 inches deep, into which I put a common tooth-brush
dish brimful of water. Over the top of the drawer compart-
ment, resting on two inclined rebates, is a pane of glass forming
a lean-to roof over the drawer. The birds see the water through
the glass and enter from the back end, which is left open.
Owing to the depth of the drawer and the slanting roof all the
splashings are arrested. The wooden drawer is well enamelled
inside and outside, and only requires a coat inside once a year to
keep it water-tight. Drinking water is supplied separately iu a
fountain. The cage is 3 feet 6 inches by 3 feet 6 inches by 16
inches back to front.
Referring to Mr. Savage's article on page 199 Vol. VII., I
have for three years kept in the above cage three Weavers and
two White Tavas. The Weavers are a Scarlet Madagascar, a
Napoleon, and (notwithstanding Dr. Butler's warning foot-note) a

Rufous-neck (Hyphantornis cucullataj. The last is a big restless
bird with a murderous looking beak exactly like the pick end of
my Chamonix ice-axe, and evil looking red eyes. I kept it
twelve months before summoning courage to trust it with the
smaller birds. However, beyond elbowing a bird now and then
off a perch it fancies, it has never done any harm, but my
experience is, of course, confined to tlie one specimen. Its
greediness after mealworms and flies is its greatest drawback.
I am simply obliged to scatter ten mealworms over the tray
to give the Madagascar a chance of one.
One of the White Javas is the pest of the establishment.
It lives on the top of a Hartz cage hung up in one corner and
viciously attacks every other bird who attempts to alight on it,
including the Hyphantornis. The latter weaves thick arches
and bowers of the long tough flowering grasses with which I
feed them in summer. Mr. Savage says he has not heard a sound
from his Napoleon. I have one equally silent which also
never weaves, but it has come regularly into brilliant plumage
for five years. Another one, which assumes only a dingy yellow
and black, makes a noise like shaking a heavy chain up and down
in a sack, accompanied by a humming noise in its throat, and
weaves every bit of grass into the cage wires. On our late
Queen's Diamond Jubilee Day it festooned three reels of
coloured sewing silks all over the Dome of a large Crystal
Palace cage, with a perfect rosette of crimson silk on an apple
branch.
I find the Madagascar never colours below the chest
unless it has frequent mealworms and soft food some time before
and during the moult, and also often Parrish's food in the water
for the sake of the phosphate of iron, when it will colour right
down to the legs.
I would like to add, in conclusion, that after a trial of six
winters, during two of which I have done without any heat in
the bird-room, I am convinced that, for a mixed collection in
cas.cs , the temperature should never remain below 48 deg. or
50 deg. Falir. ; for although my Weavers, many of the Waxbills,
Love-birds, Combassou. and Blue-Mountain Lories seem
indifferent to a dry atmosphere 10 degrees lower, yet some of the
others appear to suffer more or less, and the first night of sudden
keen frost last November killed a thoroughly healthy acclimatized
Cordon Bleu, the thermometer registering 38 deg. Falir. I use
Clarke's Atmospheric Syphon Gas Stove, recommended by Mr.
Fillmer, turned as low as it will burn. The objectionable

products of combustion seem to be condensed with the water
which collects in the tray, and there is neither smell, noise, nor
light from it. I think Mr. Abrahams also has a hygienic gas
stove on similar lines.

This publication is probably well-known to our members,
the first volume, dealing with mammals, being now complete, and
the first number of the second volume just published. This
latter commences the birds, and deals with the Ostriches and their
allies, the Game birds and Pigeons.
This is an example of the development of the photographic
art as applied to the illustration of books, the half-tone illustra-
tions being in many cases exceedingly good, and highly artistic
productions. It is, however, much to be regretted that amongst
so many beautiful pictures there should be some positively bad--
obviously photographs of wretchedly stuffed animals.
Part XIII. is the first that concerns us as aviculturists, and this
contains some photographic reproductions that are of high merit;
but here, too, there are one or two that would have been better
omitted. It appears to us to be a mistake to bring the domestic
breeds of poultry into prominence in a work of this kind, and if
a photograph of one of the wild Jungle Fowl had been given,
instead of five different pictures of domesticated varieties, this
would in our opinion have increased the value of the book.
The scientific names of the species are not given, and this
we consider a serious omission, even in a popular work of
this kind.
One ought to be able to perfectly depend upon the letterpress
of such a publication, but when we read that, with Pigeons, " the
operation of feeding is performed by the parent thrusting its
beak into the mouth of its offspring (a) and ejecting therein the
secretion," one's faith is somewhat shaken. The work is wonder-
fully moderate in price, and we must not expect too much for
our money ; after all, most of the illustrations are so exceedingly
good that they alone are very cheap at the price.

We heartily congratulate our esteemed Treasurer, Mr. W. H.
St. Quintin, on having reared young of Cabot's Tragopan. The Tragopans,
or Horned Pheasants, as most of our members are, doubtless, aware, are
some of the most beautiful of the game-birds, and inhabit densely-wooded
regions, at a high altitude, where it is almost impossible to study their
habits in a wild state. Mr. St. Quintin's experience of some examples in
captivity, as published in a letter to the Field of December 21st last, is
therefore of great interest to aviculturists.
Representatives of three species, namely, the Satyr, or Crimson
Tragopan (Tragopan satyra ), Temminck's Tragopan ( T. temmincki), and
Cabot's Tragopan {T. caboti) inhabited a fox-proof enclosure of some five
acres in extent, containing a lawn, shrubbery, and small meadow which was
watered by a stream running through it.
Mr. St. Quintin was much struck by the arboreal habits of all three
species, his specimens, although pinioned, spending most of their time
amongst the branches of the shrubs and trees in the enclosure, descending
only to feed, or dust themselves.
During the year 1900 the female T. caboti laid two eggs, of a buff
colour flecked out with rust} 7 red, and without gloss, in an old Wood-
Pigeons' nest, about ten feet from the ground, which she slightly lined
with green shoots from the tree ; but as at that time she had no mate, the
eggs were, of course, unfertile. The following year (1901) a fine adult male
was running in the enclosure, but the first clutch of eggs, laid as before in
an old Wood-Pigeons' nest (this time in a yew some 14 feet from the
ground), proved unfertile, probably from having been touched by frost. A
second clutch, laid in May in the same nest, was transferred to an incubator
and two chicks were hatched, clothed in coarse, shaggy down, of a chesnut
colour, and with the primaries developed to such an extent that on the first
day they could flutter up and perch on the side of the little yard of the
"foster-mother" to which they had been transferred.
The chicks were, with difficulty, induced to feed, at first on green
caterpillars from a maple, and then on small garden worms chopped small,
and ants' eggs. At the end of a week they ate fresh lettuce in addition
to the other food. They did not take kindly to the " foster-mother," and,
until they had learnt to return to the warm compartment, it was necessary
to shut them in at dusk, and let them out for an early feed at 4 o'clock
the next morning. They soon exhibited the same cleverness as the adults
in climbing and perching, and could fly from branch to branch in their
wire run, as neatly as any young passerine birds. Unfortunately one, the
smaller of the two, was killed by a weasel; but the other, a male, was alive
and well on December 3rd, and is so, we trust, at the present time.
The Christmas number of the New Zealand Weekly Press contains
reproductions of some excellent photographs of nests of the Grey Duck,

Weka or Wood-hen, Tui, Pied Fantail, Grey Warbler, Kingfisher and More-
pork or Common Owl.
The Grey Duck (Anas superciliosa) usually breeds in similar situations
to those selected by our own Wild Duck, but, like that species, sometimes
departs from its natural habit and builds its nest high up on a tree-stump,
or in some dense creeper. One photo, illustrates the nest of this species in
a"Ghia ghia, r ' twelve feet from the ground; and another shows the
photographer ascending a tree to a Grey Ducks' nest fort} - feet from the
ground.
Two photos of the North-Island Woodhen's or Weka's nests are
given, and an interesting account of the nesting of this Rail is supplied,
from which we extract the following--
" After making a number of bogus nests, the bird forms the proper one in the roots
of a big tree, some thick scrub, or in the middle of a niggerhead.The
Woodhen is a great thief in poultry yards, and displays much skill in sucking an egg
without wasting a drop of either white or yolk.But the Woodhen does
not interfere with other Woodhens' eggs. It lays from three to five in a cosy structure
nearly always built of cutty-grass."
The New Zealand Kingfisher (Halcyon vagans) is so closely allied to
the Sacred Kingfisher (H. sa/icta) of Australia (see Vol. VI. page 117) that
authorities differ as to whether the two are really distinct. A rotten tree-
stump is shown in the photograph, containing a number of holes, similar
to those made by Woodpeckers, and the following account is given--
" The birds, in making the nest, dig the wood away with their beaks, and form a
tunnel two or three inches long. This tunnel enlarges as it enters the nest-chamber, to
three or four inches in diameter, and on the floor the bird deposits her eggs among a
few chips of rotten wood. From two to seven eggs are laid, which are pure white and
almost round. The birds show great alarm when anyone approaches their nest,
perching near, and crying until the intruders have gone away. The young ones are
exceptionally ugly, even for young birds, having large beaks in proportion to their
size, and very short legs."

Sir,--S ome years ago, Mr. Babb of the Crystal Palace informed me
that be had heard that Blue Budgerigars sometimes resulted from crossing
Yellows with Greens. Have any of our members ever tried the experiment ?
A gentleman once told me that he had bred a pair of albino Yellow
Budgerigars--very pale Yellows with red eyes. And that he had crossed
the Mealy willi the Common Rosella. And an instance of a white Vasa
Parrot (I forget whether Greater or Lesser Vasa) also has been mentioned
to me. Have any of our readers met with either of these experiences, and
would the hybrid Rosellas be fertile ?
Not only was there a Blackbird-Thrush hybrid at the Palace Show,
but one was likewise exhibited at the Aquarium. I should be glad if any of
our members who visited these Shows would kindly give us a description of
the bird.
I have just read, in some Natural History Notes, that a flock of

twenty Crows had been seen, in company with Gulls, hawking about over
the sea, and evidently looking for fish. Surely this is a somewhat unusual
proceeding on their part! Chari.ES Cushny.
The following reply--in part--was sent to Mr. Cushny : perhaps some of our
members will supplement it.
According to the late Mr. Joseph Abrahams, there have been but two
instances recorded of the rearing of Blue Budgerigars; and the parents of
both of these were Yellows. He had a painting of one or both of these
Blue Budgerigars. More than once he told me about these two birds, but I
forget the particulars ; they were male and female.
Certainly the Rosella and the Mealy have been interbred, and the
young reared; but I cannot say whether the young were fertile.
I suppose a White Vasa is not impossible, but I never heard of one.
Gulls consort with Rooks on land; and it is possible enough that, in
hard weather, when food is scarce, the Rooks might return the visit and
join the Gulls on the arrival, close in shore, of a shoal of herrings or other
small fry ; for the Rook will eat pretty nearly anything when hard pressed ;
and I have seen them feeding along the shore. But a " flock " of twenty
"Crows," whether Hooded or Carrion, would be unusual in any circum-
stances. Nevertheless in some places the Hooded Crows are so common,
especially in the autumn, when the members of each family would be
together, that twenty individuals might be attracted together by some
object of common interest (such as a shoal of fish) ; but they do not go
about in flocks like Rooks, Choughs, and Jackdaws. The word " Crow,
unfortunately, is very loosely used. In many parts, especially perhaps in
Scotland, a Rook is always called a Crow ; and, at any rate in some parts of
the Lowlands, the only " Carrion Crow" recognized is the Hoodie, the true
Carrion Crow not being distinguished from the Rook.

COCKATIEL KILLING MICE.

Sir, --Did you ever know an instance of a Cockatiel killing and
eating a mouse ? I have had one of these birds some years. Of late mice
have been rather troublesome, and have prowled about the cages at
night after waste seed. A few weeks ago I found a mouse dead, and partly
eaten, on the bottom of the Cockatiel's cage; yesterday I made a similar
discovery. The head of the mouse was the portion attacked and eaten.
The equanimity of the bird did not appear to have been disturbed on
either occasion. T. B. \\ hytehead.
THE AGE OF BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY.
Sir,--I have always been interested in testing the length of time
that Waxbills will exist in a state of cage captivity. Have any of our
members known a Zebra Waxbill to live longer than the one I have just
lost ? A hen (the last of my little friends) has just gone to her loug home.
A pair came into my possession on 12th June, 1890. I give an extract
from the letter of that date, sent by the gentleman from whom I bought

them. " . . . . The birds were purchased by me last autumn, so they are
acclimatized, having passed the winter in my possession."
As the hen had been with me years, she must have been over 12
years old. At the time we removed here I was away from home, and the
bird had been placed on a table close to a badly-fitting window. On my
arrival I at once looked to the live stock, and found the poor little creature
panting. O11 putting my hand to the lower sash, I found there was a
dreadful draught. The aperture was at once blocked ; but it was too late,
for the mischief was done. Had it not been for this, I believe the bird
would have still been alive and in good health, for she had never had any
ailments. W. T. Cateeugh.
GOULDIAN FINCHES.
Sir, -- I shall be obliged if you can tell me whether Gouldian Finches
will do well if kept in small cages like Canaries, if so whether it would be
necessary to keep them in pairs or if they would do singly ?
I may mention that I have lost two out of three in a good-sized
aviary-cage. I consider them most beautiful birds, and like listening to
their "bubbling&amp;quot; song.
Thanking you in anticipation for any information you can give.
A. E. Boothroyd.
The following answer was sent to Mr. Boothroyd:
I have kept Gouldian Finches successfully in a medium-sized cage
for three and four years, but I think they are happier and live longer in
aviaries, where they can get more exercise. My caged Gouldians succumbed
to sudden fits in the end, in which they died in apparently fine condition.
I believe that I gave them too much white millet, which is fattening. One
which lived many years in a cage had a defective beak, and so, I believe,
could not overeat.
Those I have at present spend six or eight months of the year in an
outdoor aviary, and the remainder in a large cage in a birdroom. They
flourish and look in perfect health and happiness.
I by no means think it necessary to keep Gouldians in pairs.

Sir,--I f any of our members have been successful in keeping the
Water Ouzel or Dipper in confinement, will they be kind enough to give us
an account of their methods and treatment ?
Our pool aviary--of which I have already sent a description, and in
which I have kept Kingfishers without difficulty--seems an ideal place for
the Dipper, but though I have had two consignments of strong fresh-
caught birds, they do not live, and I do not care to experiment further until
I can gather some information as to the food they require--for I expect
this is the weak point. My birds were plentifully supplied with live earth-
worms scattered in the water, and shredded raw meat both in the water
and placed about the rock shelves, but they soon became weak and died.

The Little Grebe or Dabcliick, too, I have found difficult to keep,
though they generally live longer than the Dipper.
I expect the absence of green weed in the water may afford some
explanation in the latter case, but hardly in the former.

Sir, -- I send yon herewith an account of my aviary. -- It is 33 feet
long, 23 feet wide, and 9 feet high, divided down the centre by small wire
netting. The wooden frame stands on a low brick wall about 2 feet high.
At the end of the aviary is a close-boarded room, fitted up with
perches and nests of all descriptions, to which the birds always have access.
This part is roofed with corrugated iron, and the remainder of the aviary
with wire netting. One whole length of the aviary to the East is built up
with brickwork. It gets plenty of sun, and is partially shaded in the
summer by oak-trees.
One half of the aviary is reserved for different kinds of Parrakeets ;
and the other half for various other birds. Amongst the Parrakeets I may
mention a King and Queen, Pennants, Crimson-wings and Red-rumps : the
two latter species bred last season (1901), and I now have four fine young
Crimson-wings and two young Red-rumps.
Amongst the birds in the other compartment I have Green-winged,
and Australian Crested Pigeons, a Cardinal, Virginian Nightingale, and
Japanese Robins; Grey, and White Java Sparrows; Java, Senegal, and
Zebra Doves; Egyptian Crested Quails; Bohemian Waxwings, Zebra
Finches, Ribbon Finches, and Red-billed Weavers,--the last three named
bred last season (1901). All the birds are in good health, and they do not
seem to feel the cold, although during the severe weather the water in
their drinking fountain is frozen every morning.* S. E. Mors HEAD.

* Lady Morsliead kindly sent us a photograph of the aviary above described, which
we much regret being unable to reproduce, partly because the plates for the year have
mostly been already arranged for, and also on account of the fact that the funds of the
Society are limited, and the Committee cannot afford to give as many illustrations as they
would like. We quite hope to be able ere long, as our membership increases, to publish at
least one plate (either coloured or black and white) in each number of the Magazine : but
illustrations are, unfortunately, expensive luxuries, and, with the Society's present income,
we are hardly justified in doing so.
It is most desirable that the Magazine should be illustrated each month, as we
believe the illustrations are highly appreciated by our members ; we hope, therefore, that
each member will do his or her best to increase the membership of the Society by making
the Magazine better known to bird-lovers, and, by thus increasing the funds, enable the

interest to, at least, a few members. We are often told that to attempt to
keep such and such a bird in a living room is simply to court disaster, and
this, no doubt, deters many from making the attempt. There are, I am
sure, many lovers of birds who, like myself, are either obliged to keep their
birds in living rooms, or give up aviculture.
I have kept a few foreigners for many years now, and, considering
how the temperature of a room differs during the night and da}', must say
that I have been fairly successful, having a few years ago won my share of
prizes, which proves that my birds were not in bad condition. Of course,
if one can have a birdroom or aviary so much the better.
My stock at present consists of a Grey Parrot (which is a most clever
talker), pair Diamond Sparrows, Grey Singing Finch, Blue Robin, Shama,
Dliyal, and Virginian Nightingale. The cages of the three soft bills are
cleaned out every morning and the others twice a week, having a plentiful
supply of sea-sand. All these birds, with the exception of the Dliyal, have
been in my possession three and four years, and all appear in perfect health.
They are kept in good sized cages, and some are let out most days for a fly
round, which I consider very beneficial. In the summer, on fine days, I
hang outside as many as I can. The Virginian, which is kept in a room
in which there is never a fire, may be heard singing ou tlie coldest days, and
I have frequently heard him before 3 a.111.
The Shama and Dliyal are most interesting birds; both will fly from
their cages and take mealworms from my hand; the latter will also perch
011 my finger, peck at it, and sing until I give it some dainty : it seems to
know no fear. The soft-bills are fed twice daily on the usual mixtures,
together with one or two mealworms and as many insects as I can collect.
At night, about 10 p.m., all the cages are warmly covered up; and, although
some aviculturists suggest that this is not necessary, I think that birds kept
in a room in which there has been a fire during the day should have some
protection at night.
I should be glad to hear of the experiences of other members who
keep their birds under similar conditions. H. Speed.

It will be observed that the variation in measurement is not great,
and is probably insufficient to constitute a differentiating sexual character.
The female rami, however, are distinctly rounder than those of the male,
and present a larger surface for muscular attachment, so that the female
jaw must be stronger than the male; which is no more than might be
expected, seeing that the female is the principal, if not indeed the sole,
excavator of the nest-burrow. W. T. GREENE.
A WILD BIRDS' "LARDER."
Sir,--A great deal of pleasure, at very little cost, can be had by
making a wild birds' larder.
A large hawthorn tree grows close to our dining-room window, and
on one of its lower branches we have hung food for the birds. Pieces of
raw bacon-fat and suet can have a hole pierced through, and be tied to the
branch with string. Also ordinary tallow candles, tied through the wick ;
and cocoa-nuts split in halves (a hole can easily be made through them with
a red-hot skewer).
Large and Small Tits, and Cole Tits, come in large numbers, almost
before I have finished tying up the food, and it is very pretty to watch them
swinging from the cocoa-nuts, which are their special dainties. Anyone
who has no tree near at hand to tie the "larder" to, could fasten it to a few
nails in the wooden framework of the window, or could stretch a cord
across it from side to side. Rosie Aederson.
OUTDOOR AVIARIES.
Sir,-- I have only a small garden, but a very sunny one. A long
border, which we used to devote to roses, I have now turned into an aviary
which is the home of various foreign birds. I have a Mealy Rosella, a pair
of Orange-breasted Parrakeets (b), some Zebra Finches, and about twenty
Budgerigars, in it at present.
It is thirty-four feet long. One end is the sleeping compartment,
which has a wooden door opening into the flight : I keep it shut in the cold
weather. Two holes are cut in the wooden division, through which the
birds can get in and out. The floor of all is thickly covered with sand, old
mortar, and shell-grit. For bathing, I have a glazed earthenware basin,
very shallow, with plug and waste-pipe. The exact sizes are--length 34 ft.,
height 14 ft., width 10 ft. I may say that it cost about #5 to put it up.
My favourite birds being Parrakeets, and, finding I could not keep as
many as I wished in this aviary, I put up another, which cost me about # 4.
It is wider, but not quite so long as the first one. My birds seem very
happy in it. I have reared young of Red Rosellas last year, besides
numerous Cockatiels. My hen Pennant died just as I was hoping to have
a nest.
I thought perhaps this little description might interest some of our
members who are unable, for various reasons, to go in for such an elaborate
and expensive structure as the one Miss Alderson described so vividly, and
which, I confess, made me feel horribly envious. M. B. Lancaster.

Sir,--T here is a species of Long-tailed Partridge common in the
River Plate, and known there as the "Martinetta." I think, though I am not
sure, that it is the Nothin a major (c), mentioned by Darwin in the "Voyage of
the Beagle ," but I can find nothing more than a passing reference to it in
such books as I have been able to consult, and should be much obliged if
you could identify it for me, though I have given you very meagre details
I am anxious to know whether the species would do well in our
climate, and whether, given suitable conditions, it might succeed if turned
down. As an aviary-bird it would, no doubt, be very easily 7 kept.
Could you recommend any 7 particular caging or treatment for this
class of bird on board ship while being brought over ? II. C. Martin.
[We cannot be sure to what species you refer, as the Long-tailed
Partridges ( Dendrortyx) are confined to Central America.
As to whether the birds you mention would do well in our climate--
this can only 7 be ascertained by 7 experiment.
Whatever species these birds belong to, we should doubt their
capabilities of withstanding the rigours of an English winter in the open,
although they would do well enough in a properly-sheltered aviary and
with little or no artificial heat.
There should be little difficulty in importing these birds. On the
voyage they should be confined in a box-cage, say five or six feet long by 7
three or four feet deep and fifteen inches high, wired only in the front, and
with the top made of canvas or other similar material to prevent the birds
injuring their heads.
The Partridges, if such they be, must not, of course, be overcrowded.
We should recommend them being fed on canary-, white millet-, and
dari-seed, and a little hemp.--E d.]
We would remind our members that some of the back numbers of the
Magazine are getting very scarce ; those, therefore, who wish to make up
sets, should obtain them at once. We should also like to point out
that the sale of back numbers helps to benefit the Society and enables the
Committee to improve the Magazine.
The Editor regrets that the present number is somewhat late in its
appearance. This delay has been caused by the colorists being unable to
have the plate ready in time.
{&amp;lt;.) The same as A 7 , maculosa. The Spotted Tinamou is often represented at the Zoo, where
it has bred.--R. P.

<bodyText confidence="0.983257083333334" page_id="10104118"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case.
If a reply by post (in addition to any Report that may appear in the Magazine) be required,
a stamped and addressed envelope must likewise be sent.
Dhyal, male. (Mr. Iledley Speed) This bird had been ailing for several
weeks, gradually becoming worse. Owner was of opinion that lungs
were affected.
[Your opinion is correct : the cause of death was pneumonia of long
standing.]
Green AvadavaT. (Mr. A. E. Bootliroyd). The temperature of the bird-
room fell to 32 0 Far. one night, and the bird was found dead next day.
[Death resulted from acute inflammation of the liver, caused bv the
cold or some error in feeding. You do not state method of feeding. This
species is cpiite hardy: I have a pair which have been out of doors all the
winter and are now in splendid condition.]
Bueefinch, female. (Miss E. Brampton). When found dead showed no
sign of injury, and was very fat.
[Death was due to pressure 011 the brain from a depression of the
skull, and a blood-clot extending over most of the upper surface of the
brain. Direct injury could have been the only cause of this condition.]
Canary-Goedfinch, mule. (Mr. W. Osbaldeston). No particulars what-
ever given.
[Death was caused by cerebral apoplexy. In future kindly send par-
ticulars of feeding and symptoms, as the post mortem reports are intended
for the benefit of the members generally as well as individually.]
Lavender Finch, female. (Mr. R. Pliillipps). Found dead.
[Death was due to haemorrhage from the left lung, caused apparently
by external violence, as the muscles between the ribs were ruptured, and
a blood-clot extended to the subcutaneous tissues over the left side of the
chest.]
Zebra Finch, hen. (Mr. A. E. Bootliroyd). Found dead.
[This bird died from inflammation of the oviduct, consequent on
inability to lay a soft-shelled egg.]

THE GREATER SULPHUR - CRESTED COCKATOO.
( Cacatua galerita).
By the Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton.
With Notes by Sir C. Lawes.
This bird is one of the commonest parrots in the market,
and can therefore be bought at times at as low a price as 25/- the
pair. Its hardiness enables it to be imported in great numbers;
but there is not the traffic in these birds that there is in Grey
Parrots. And this is because, in spite of its snowy beauty, it is
not nearly so clever a bird (a).
I have had no great experience of them myself, because
they are too noisy and mischievous for pets for the house: the
most attractive that I have come across were noisy ( 6 ). I have
not myself seen or known of one that was a good talker. And I
have been told that they are uncertain in temper (c ); but I
rather incline to think this a libel, and that tlley r are always
affectionate with those they are fond of. They are better suited
for aviaries than for cages. Of all parrots they are the least
sensitive to cold. In fact Mr. Buxton, in his interesting paper
on the parrots he kept at Northrepps, found this insensibility a
positive disadvantage. The Grey Parrots would come in for
shelter in severe weather, he tells us, and the Cockatoos would
not and consequently got their toes frost bitten.
Perhaps the best commentary on the suitability of the
Lemon-crested Cockatoo as a cage-pet would be a visit to the
room downstairs in the Crystal Palace devoted to parrots. The

( c ) . Bad handling! All Australian birds have nice dispositions. The

<bodyText confidence="0.962038" page_id="10104122"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
males are apt to bite, but not from spite, and a quick blow with the other
hand soon teaches them. The Small Island Cockatoos are very spiteful.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.997476555555556" page_id="10104123"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
parrots are almost all Sulphur-crested Cockatoos "presented" by
their owners !
The nicest I know I have promised to have when its
owner dies, and I am always in terror of hearing of her death.
It is intelligent, affectionate, amusing, miserable in a cage,
destructive out, and noisy when not being played with.
Russ seems unaware of any distinction between the sexes,
but I believe the eye test to be good, and that the males have
black eyes and the hens brown ( d ).

As the Barbets have, of late }^ears, become somewhat
popular as cage-birds, it would perhaps be well to mention that
two of these pretty little fellows should be obtainable,--the
Black - collared Barbet ( Pogonorhynchus torquatus ), which is
common near Hast London, Graham's Town, Eland's Port,
Pinetown, and Rustenburg; also the Pied Barbet ( P. leucomelas)
which is a wide-ranging and not uncommon, though somewhat
local, species.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.860155625" page_id="10104123"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
Of the South African Parrots the Rosy-faced Love-bird
(. Agafornis roseicollis ) is plentiful and gregarious 011 the Limpopo ;
Meyer's Parrot ( Psittacus meyeri ) occurs commonly in the same
country and in Matabeleland ; Riippell's Parrot ( P. rueppelli ) is
common in Damaraland.
One Fruit-Pigeon might perhaps be secured--Delalande's
Green Pigeon ( Tver on delalandii) which is said to be not un-
common at East London and has been shot in various other
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9946594" page_id="10104123"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
localities. The S. African Speckled Pigeon ( Columba phceonota),
known as the Bosch-Duif or Wilde-Duif, is common everywhere,
aud could be obtained with ease; the Spotted Pigeon (C. arqua-
trix ) which has been seen in our Zoological Gardens visits the
Knysna towards the end of the year in large flocks and extends
to the Cape peninsula to feed on the berries of the wild olive.
(d) This is the case with all Cockatoos without exception -- males
black eyes, females coloured more or less.
The most mischievous and amusing bird I ever knew was a large hen
Sulphur-crest.
</bodyText>

The Rufous-necked Wood-Dove (. Hapiopclia larvala) is
occasionally imported ; it is the " Lamoen Duif " of the colonists
and is common near Cape Town, at the Knysna, in Natal, and in
the Ly den burg district of the Transvaal. The well-known
Half-collared Turtle (Turin? semitorquatus ) is common at East
London and has been met with in other parts of S. Africa ; the
Cape Turtle-dove (T. capicola ) is plentiful near Port Elizabeth,
throughout Natal, the Transvaal, and elsewhere.
The widely distributed Cambayan or Senegal Turtle (Tui ha
sencgalcnsis ) is reported as common on the Fish River, in the
mimosa bush along the Tugela, and in the Mariqua district of the
Transvaal.
The beautiful Emerald T)oxe(Chalcopelia afro) is abundant
throughout Kaffirland, is common about Durban and Pinetown,
and has been recorded from other parts of S. Africa; and the
charming Tambourine Pigeon (Tyvipanistria tympanistria ) is
very plentiful in bushy country on the coast line about Durban in
Natal.
The familiar Cape-Dove is to be met with all over the
colony ; but it is to be regretted that hen birds are so much more
rarely imported than cocks.
Among the Game birds there are various Guinea-fowls
which might be interesting for large aviaries or poultry-runs, but
which one can hardly reckon among cage-birds. The same may
perhaps be said of the Francolins, some of which are easily
captured, become quickly tame and are said to make excellent
pets. The Harlequin Quail (Cotumix delegorguei ) occurs near
Grahamstown and in Natal, and a few have been shot at various
times at King William's Town, but it does not seem to be very
common.
The Hemipodes, which make most interesting cage and
aviary pets, are represented in S. Africa by two species,--the
South African Hemipode (Turnix hottentotta) found sparingly
throughout the colony, and the Kurrichane Hemipode (T.
lepurana) which is far more local, but is said to be not uncommon
in Great Namaqualand during the rainy-season.
Doubtless there are many other S. African birds suitable
for Zoological Gardens or for extensive private aviaries ; but, in
the present account, I have thought it better to limit myself to
those which may fairly be regarded as cage-birds.

NOTES ON THE MALABAR AND GOLD-FRONTED
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96909555" page_id="10104125"  page_num="86" year="" vol="">
CHLOROPSIS.
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
Our Secretary has asked me to contribute an article on
these species, so I must perforce try to say something about
them, albeit the information I can give is but scanty. Indeed,
I cannot recall ever having seen the Malabar Chloropsis (Chlo)op-
sis malabarica) alive, and the Indian Museum contains but few
specimens of this bird.
The commonest species of this beautiful genus exported
from India is undoubtedly the Gold-fronted (C. aurifrons&amp;apos;), which
is well known as a cage-bird here under the name of Harewa
(pronounced Hurrywali). This name should, I think, be used
for the group, as they are certainly very distinct from all other
Babblers and Bulbuls, although claiming with justice a place in
one or other of these groups ; I think, myself, that they unite
the two. The Gold-fronted Harewa, then, is a bird whose general
hue is the brightest grass-green, relieved by a patch of shining
turquoise blue on the "shoulder" of each wing, displayed when
the bird is excited. The sides of the face and the throat and
fore-neck are black, and the centre of the throat, light up to the
beak , rich bj&amp;apos;ight blue. The forehead is fiery orange, and a yellow
zone borders the black throat below, extending more or less
faintly up the sides thereof. The hen is said to be less brilliant
in colour, but all the birds I have seen look much alike. Her
mouth is said to be brown, while that of the cock is bluish grey,
and this may afford a means of distinction. Young birds have
no black or gold on the head and only a moustache of blue.
Many are brought into Calcutta at this stage.
The Malabar Harewa resembles the Gold-fronted exactly
in size and general colour, but the black on the throat runs up
right to the base of the beak, leaving only two stripes of blue, one
on each side, like moustaches. There is no zone of yellow
bordering the black throat in those I have seen, though some are
said to show it. The hen is said hardly to differ from the cock,
and the young to be green all over.
It will be seen from this that there is about the same
difference between these two species as there is between a
" Cheveril " and an ordinary Goldfinch; and it is not to be
wondered at that they have got mixed up in the Zoological
Society's list, which gives the Malabar Chloropsis as C. aurifrons.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999088720930232" page_id="10104126"  page_num="87" year="" vol="">
For the benefit of those who do not know these lovely
birds, I may mention that the Harewas are very easy to keep,
devouring soft fruit and insects with equal avidity, and lapping
up sweetened milk-sop with great gusto. They are very active
on their feet, and will keep in good order in quite a small cage.
But it is a shame to shut them up closely, as they are also very
strong on the wing, and will make good use of space for flight.
They can hover well, and when going far travel in bounds or
undulations like a Wagtail; at any rate this is the method of
flight of the Gold-fronted species.
In disposition they are very uncertain ; some are perfect
fiends, and will not let other birds alone, while others are quiet
and harmless, although not given to cuddling and tickling
strangers. A pair, however, will keep close together. On the
ground, to which they do not very readily descend, they move
by awkward hops, and do not look at all well.
Their natural habit is to search the leaves of trees for
insects, and hence they have a queer trick of peering sideways
at anything that attracts their attention. They will search
under other birds' tails as if they were leaves! Most of those I
have seen have been fascinatingly tame, and they are very much
liked by everyone who has kept them.
I have seen one or two wild here in Calcutta, but I expect
they were "escapes." A very nice bird I had (C. aurifrons) got
away twice, the last time for good, and no doubt many others do
so. This specimen would pull my hair if I put my head near
enough to the cage, and when I went inside to catch another bird
it would be much interested in the net.
The only other species I have seen much of is the splendid
Orange-bellied or Blue-winged Harewa (C. hardwickii), and this
is rare compared with the Gold-fronted. It is a stouter, stronger
bird, and is feared by the slighter species when they meet in a
wild state.
I may mention finally a curious fact that a Gold-fronted
Harewa, belonging to a friend of mine, having had some feathers
pulled out by a rat, reproduced these of a greenish blue ; thus
shewing that variation of tint in this bird indicates a failure of
constitution affecting the colour of the feathers.
[It has become such a persistent habit of bird-keepers in this country
to refer to the Gold-fronted Harewa as a "Malabar" Green-Bulbul, a
"Malabar" Fruitsucker, and the like, that I invited Mr. F&amp;apos;rank Finn to
give us an authoritative statement on the point. I hope our readers will
now see clearly that they are in error when they apply the word " Malabar "

to the now familiar C. aurifrons, the Malabar bird (C. malnbnrica) being a
different species (it is treated as specifically distinct in the Museum Cata-
logue) and rarely imported. The Zoological Society's List is mainly
responsible for originating and disseminating this error. I thank Mr. Finn
for so promptly responding to my application for assistance. -- R.P.]
THE BLACK BULBUL.
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
If ever a rare bird comes into the market, you should
advise one of your friends to buy it; much on the same principle
that all wise men are bankers--because it is easier to play with
other people's money than with your own. Failing a victim,
there is only one other course open, you must sacrifice yourself
on the altar of avicultural duty. I had to adopt the latter course
when some months since I was offered some Black Bulbuls.
The Black Bulbul would have been quite sympathetic
with the Irishman who was fined ^5 in some English town for
fighting and who exclaimed, on hearing the decision of the
Bench, " Begorra, but wait till I get yez in Limerick where
fighting is chape! " I will back him for his fighting weight for
ver3&amp;apos;long odds against any bird I know, bar a Shama or a Dhyal.
In that case, perhaps, he will make him haste to escape, and will
seek him a place to flee unto until the tyranny be overpast. As
a sly and crafty slayer of small and inoffensive birds, he could
give points to the Thugs. When I bought my Black Bulbuls all
this was hidden from me. I often think a good motto for us
aviculturists would be " Spero infestis," which I will translate
for the sake of the unlearned " Hope on in spite of bad luck."
Of the iniquities of these Black Bulbuls I could write
" currente calamo," but I dare not do it, for I feel like that fat
old gentleman in India, who remained in the plains because he
was sensible that in the hills he might begin to roll and go on
rolling until he rolled out of the world altogether. I have so
much material that I dare not cut the wire which holds the bale
together. One or two straws, however, may be pulled out
without disturbing the heap. One morning I found a very rare
African Sparrow, whose name I cannot discover, dead on the
floor: a few mornings later a little Bibfinch hen scrambled
across the floor with a broken wing. I wondered at first what
had caused the damage. The Black Bulbuls were the biggest
oc cupauts of the aviary, and next to them came a pair of
A merican Song Sparrows. I wondered which were the culprits.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.990249911111111" page_id="10104128"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
s 9
I found out quite by accident. I caught the Song Sparrows and
put them in an outdoor aviary. Then I netted the Bulbuls.
When I took out the first one I have seldom received a more
hearty grasp of the beak than he gave me, and I said to myself
" Now I can understand how that Bibfinch felt when you got
hold of her wing ! " I promptly caged the pair of sinners, and
put them together into a fair sized aviary where they remained
all the summer.
I will try to describe their appearance. I think myself
that Black is a misnomer. Did you ever hear the story of the
two young ladies who were discussing the colour of the devil,
one maintaining that he was black and the othersoniethingelse ?
At length one of them closed the conversation, which was
getting a bit heated, with the crushing remark, " I think you
will find that I am right, dear." And when I have given my
description, I venture to think that readers of this Magazine
will think that the Black Bulbul is not so black as he is painted ( e ).
The head, nape, and back of the neck, the chin, throat
and breast are black; the breast beautifully laced with silvery
white like a Birchen bantam, the ears rich glossy brown, wings
blackish brown, shoulders laced with silvery white, vent rich
crimson, bill and legs black, iris brown.
I fully intended to breed Black Bulbuls next year, and
make somebody perfectly green with envy ; but alas for our good
intentions!
There is always something peculiarly soothing in village
news. This is a village. We all love to hear which man has
grown the biggest lettuce, or the most alluring cabbage ; which
children have let the family pig into their neighbour's garden,
and with what results. It is the best possible news--always
supposing that the said devastated garden is not ours! In the
same way, aviculturists always like to hear of disasters--to other
people. W 7 hat follows, therefore, will be of a cheering nature to
many.
The atmosphere of Micklefield--summer and winter--is
simply that of a roofed-in railway station open at both ends. It
is not conducive to longevity in birds, though perhaps it may be
( e ). Here, in another sense, I quite agree with Mr. Farrar. Years ago I had a pair of
Black Bulbuls flying loose in the aviary, but they never did any mischief. Nevertheless, as
a race, and I have kept several species and still have four--six individuals. I have found
the Bulbuls exceptionally spiteful, and very much more so than the much maligned
Weavers, of which I have had many for long periods, and still have about a dozen. A
little Madagascar is the only spiteful one, some of the others being&amp;apos; right down jolly good
fellows.--R.P.

called "bracing" by the faculty. At any rate it was too bracing
for Bengal Bulbuls, for one morning I found them both dead on
the floor. Marius amid the ruins of Carthage could not have
worn a more tragic air than I did that morning.
There are some few aviculturists that have the gift of
sympathy, and to them I appeal with confidence.

REARING RINGED-PLOVERS FROM THE EGG.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993915090909091" page_id="10104129"  page_num="90" year="" vol="">
By W. G. Percivae.
On May nth, last year, I took a clutch of four eggs of the
Ringed Plover, sEgialitis hiaticola (Linn.), and, while drilling
one in order to remove its contents, I found that the young bird
was on the point of being hatched. I at once put the remaining
three eggs into an incubator, in company with a number of
fowls' eggs. Two of them were chipped on the following
morning, and the young birds emerged about six o'clock the
same evening. The third egg produced a weakly bird the next
evening, but this one only lived until the 28th. As soon as the
young were hatched, I transferred them to an incubator by
themselves. They were not able to stand up on their feet for
some hours, and I noticed that they took some time to get
thoroughly dry.
Food was the next question, so I took my water-net and
collected a lot of weed from a pond which was close at hand.
The next morning I placed the chicks in an open box in
the conservatory, and put beside them some of the pond-weed,
which contained a number of minute insects. After a few
minutes one of them began to peck about a little, but they
would not feed properly. They soon got cold, and had to be
replaced in the incubator, where they remained for the rest of
the day.
On the 14th I placed them in a large glass case (about 5ft.
by i8iu.) on which the sun was shining, having previously
covered the floor with sand. They at once began to run about
in a very lively manner, and to pick up insects from the weed
which I offered them ; but directly a cloud came over the sun
they became dull, and soon lay down and appeared to be dying,
so I had to return them at once to the incubator, where the
warmth soon revived them.
After this they were put out for a short time ever)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; day,
while the sun was shining, and I sometimes allowed them to run
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999576261904762" page_id="10104130"  page_num="91" year="" vol="">
loose on the lawn, where they caused me much amusement as
lliey ran about catching insects, in the pursuit of which they
frequently overbalanced themselves. When I attempted to
catch them they would not always run away, but frequently
crouched close to the ground, following, no doubt, their natural
instinct, by which they often escape detection, when young, by
hiding among the pebbles on the sea shore.
For the first two weeks they were fed entirely on water
insects, such as dragon-fly larvae and gnat grubs, etc., but then I
thought I would give them a change of food, so I dug up some
ants' nests and put them in the case where they were kept.
They seemed to like this, and eagerly picked out the cocoons;
they also showed a liking for gentles, and after a time would
take small mealworms. Now and then, when very hungry, they
would eat a little hard-boiled egg and small pieces of meat, but
very seldom, and only when nothing else was left. When
hungry they constantly uttered a sharp shrill cry, and would
always answer me if I whistled to them. After they were able
to fly, I often let them loose in a large and lofty billiard room
which was not in use, and they would fly about for some time,
appearing to enjoy their comparative liberty.
They were very fond of bathing, and when their dish of
water was placed in their case, they would rush at it and jump
and make a great fuss, often remaining in the water for some
time, then they would come out almost drowned ; but as soon as
they got a bit dry in they would go again. But they were
particular that the water should be clean.
I regret now that I only made one or two notes as to the
growth of their feathers. On June ist, the twentieth day after
they had been hatched, the primary feathers were half-an-inch
long, and the body feathers were just beginning to show under
the down.
I always put them into the incubator at night until they
were about two months old, and then I kept them in a closed
cage in a warm room. During the day they were kept in a
covered-in wire run. When they were about twelve weeks old, a
tragedy occurred which caused me to lose them both. A Magpie
managed to seize and kill one, through the wire; and the other
chick died soon after, either from fright or from solitude.
I do not remember to have heard of anyone who has
previously reared this interesting species from the egg ; but if
any members of the Avicultural Society have done so, it might

I also reared a Moorhen in the same way.

THE CRYSTAL PALACE BIRD SHOW.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997389277777778" page_id="10104131"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
This exhibition was certainly not up to the average of Crystal
Palace Shows, and there were very few specimens of exceptional
rarity or interest.
In the British Section we were much struck by the Cinna-
mon Thrush which obtained the first prize in the class for
" Pied, Albino, or rare feathered specimens."
Mr. Maxwell's Golden-crested Wren, which was well
shown and rightly awarded a first prize in the "Resident"
class, testifies to that gentleman's great skill in keeping the more
delicate British insectivorous species. It was in excellent form
and one of the most charming birds in the Show. The same
exhibitor sent a Lesser-spotted Woodpecker, a species not often
placed on the show-bench. A very nice Long-tailed Titmouse
was also here, as well as a Green, and three Greater-spotted
Woodpeckers and several other interesting specimens.
In the class for Migratory Birds, the first prize was
awarded to a very fine Blue-lieaded Wagtail belonging to Mr.
Maxwell. A good Black Redstart was also well worth
inspection.
In the Foreign Class, amongst the Parrakeets the most
noteworthy exhibit was the female Golden-shoulder belonging to
Mr. L. W. Hawkins, and now so well-known at the leading
bird-shows : it was awarded a second prize. A good pair ofMany-
colours, owned by the same exhibitor, taking first. A moderate
Blue-bonnet, some Kings and Crimson Wings, a Port Lincoln
and several commoner species were also shown.
The Dove Class was better filled than usual, and con-
tained some uncommon birds. A beautiful pair ot Wonga-
Wonga Pigeons, belonging to Mr. Housden, obtained the first
prize, and this gentleman also sent a fine pair of Nicobars. The
rarest birds in this class were, however, the White-crowned
Pigeons (Columba lencocephala) and White-winged Doves
( Melopclia leucoptera ) exhibited by Mr. W. PL Parker, but these
were not in show form, and the male White-crowned Pigeon had
lost half its right wing. An exhibit catalogued as "Madagascar
Doves" proved to be a pair of Senegal Turtles with an odd

specimen of Zenaida anrita with them. It is a pit}&amp;apos; exhibitors do
not take more trouble to name their entries correctly. In the
class for Waxbills, Grassfinches, etc., the most noteworthy
exhibits were the Wiener's Waxbills (. Pytelia afro. ) and Rufous-
tailed Finches ( Bathilda ruficauda&amp;apos;) sent by Mr. L. W. Hawkins.
There was also here a good pair of Pectoral-finches ( Muni a
pcctoralis).
The class for ** Grosbeaks, true Finches and Buntings,"
was judged somewhat peculiarly; the first prize being awarded
to a couple of cock Black-headed Buntings ( Embcriza melano-
cephala). We should have expected the author of a work on
British birds to be able to distinguish the sex of a bird which
is included in the British list, and in which the sexes differ
considerably in plumage. The only bird of any rarity in the
class was a very nice Cuba Finch.
Amongst the " Tanagers, Sugar-birds, Honey-eaters,
Zosterops, and Bulbuls," were some beautiful birds of great
rarity, but the judging was most remarkable. The first prize
was awarded to a pair of common Chinese Zosterops and the
second to a Superb Tanager, neither of which was worth a
tithe of the value of either Mr. Swan's fine White-capped Tanager,
or Mr. Townsend's so-called Archbishop Tanager, or his Blue
Tanager, all of which were of great rarity. The latter exhibitor
sent an Indian Sun-bird, which most unfortunately got so
besmeared with honey, upon which it was fed, that it died
before the Show opened. It was impossible to discern the
colours when we inspected the body, but it was evidently an
exceedingly rare bird, and probably the first of its kind ever
seen at a show in this country.
A very fine Malabar Green Bulbul was singing splendidly
in this class, and there was a good Warty-faced Honev-eater.
The Mixed Class, for all species not included elsewhere,
contained perhaps the finest collection of rarities in the Show.
The first prize winner was a Cinereous Struthidea, rare, but not in
show form/yy. A fine Masked Wood Swallow (Artamus personatus)
was awarded second (both of these belonged to Mr. Glasscoe).
A White-eyebrowed Wood Swallow (A. superciliosus), equally
good and perhaps slightly rarer than the Masked, was entirely
passed over by the Judge, as was also a good Barbet (g). A Shama
(/). See Vol. VII , pp. 75 and 146.--K.P.
( g ). We visited the Show 011 the Friday, the opening day, and the White-eyebrowed
Wood-Swallow certainly had no card then; Ur. Butler informs us however that on the
Monday there appeared an alteration in the awards, the White-eyebrowed Wood-Swallow
being labelled third, and the Shama passed over.-- Eo.

obtained third, and a Sacred Kingfisher, which was not in Show
form, fourth prize. A Red-headed Starling, a very rare and
handsome bird, was only given a V.H.C, card, and a Pnrple-
headed Glossy Starling was Commended. There was also here
a good Brazilian Hangnest.
REVIEW.
THE EMU*
We are favoured with a copy of the second part of Vol. I.
of this quarterly publication,--the official organ of the newly-
formed Australasian Ornithologists'Uuion,which has been formed
on the lines of the B.O.U., and promises to accomplish much in
the working out of the ornithology of a region rich in feathered
creatures.
Our space will only permit of a very brief notice of the
Emu which, there is little doubt, will prove an exceedingly
useful journal to all who study Australasian birds,whether ill their
native wilds, or here at home in our aviaries. It is edited by
Mr. A. J. Campbell (whose standard work on " Nests and Eggs of
Australian Birds" is known to many of our members&amp;apos;) and Mr.
H. Kendall.
The present part contains accounts of the meetings held
at the inaugural session, during which lectures were delivered
and excursions made into the surrounding country in search of
birds. Papers are published on the following subjects --Porphyrio
melano?iotus in New Zealand ; North Western Notes ; Protective
Colouration of Australian Birds and their Nests; Corresponding
and Observatory Stations ; Notes on certain Maluri , with a
description of a new species ; Description of a new Bristle Bird;
Should the Mutton-Birds be protected? etc.
Three good photo-tint illustrations are given of nests.
Many of our members are especially interested in Aus-
tralasian birds, and will hail with delight the advent of the Emu,
which must, wuthout doubt, rank high amongst ornithological
publications.

Nine specimens of the Pheasant - tailed Jacana (Hyd/ophusiattus
chirurgus) were recently presented by Mr. Frank Finn to the Zoological
Society, and arrived at the gardens on January ntli last. This is the first
time this curious species has been represented in the Society's collection.
It is unfortunate that they should have arrived at a season in which
climatic conditions are against their being placed amongst more or less
natural surroundings, as they might have been in the summer. The dry
sanded floor of the inner part of the Western Aviary is a poor substitute for
their home amongst aquatic vegetation, and we were much disappointed
to find, on visiting the gardens on February iotli, that only five of the
nine then survived, and these did not appear to be doing well.
The Jacanas ( Purridce) form a link between the Snipes and the
Plovers, while they differ from all other birds in possessing extraordinarily
elongated toes, which enable them to walk with ease on floating leaves of
aquatic plants. The Pheasant-tailed Jacana, or Water Pheasant, is the
sole representative of the genus Hydrophasianus, and the largest member of
the family. The specimens now in the Zoological Gardens are in winter
plumage, the breeding plumage being assumed in May or June, at which
time the short tail-feathers are replaced by others of about a foot in length.
The Water Pheasant is comparatively common throughout India and
Ceylon, and is found wherever there is water in which aquatic vegetation
is abundant; feeding upon insects and grain. The nest, composed of
weeds and rushes, is placed in some thick grass-clump in the midst of a
pond or swamp. According to Hume, "in shape the eggs of this species
are so peculiar that when once seen they can never be mistaken. They
may be described as pegtops without pegs--cones slightly obtuse at the
point, based upon somewhat flattened hemispheres.When quite
fresh they are of a rich deep bronze colour." The clutch usually consists
of four eggs.
Mr. Frohawk has contributed a very life-like drawing of Tengmalm's
Owl (Nyctala tengmalmi) to the Field of Feb. ist, with an account of the
capture of two of these rare wanderers in an exhausted state on the East
Coast, after an easterly gale. Both of these Owls appeared to be perfectly
tame, and readily took to a life of captivity. Two more have since been
recorded in England -- one shot in Northamptonshire, and the other near
Henley. This brings the number of cases in which this species has been
recorded in the British Islands to about thirty-three.
Ostrich farms are, we learn, being established at several places on the
Riviera, where the climate seems favourable to the industry. The demand
for good plumes is said to be ever increasing, and, at the present time,
greater than the supply ; so that there is every prospect of the undertaking,
which appears to be entirely a British concern, proving very remunerative.
In the Field of Feb. 8th, Mr. J. H. Gurney records the occurrence of
Allen's Gallinule (Porphynola alleni) on Dec. 31st last at Hopton, near
Yarmouth. There is no previous record of this African species having
been taken in Great Britain.

A pair of Red-backed Parrakeets (Psephotus hcematonotus) have been
for months frequenting the vacant pieces of ground between the Australian
Wharf and the Victoria Dock. Possibly they roost in the roof of some
adjacent buildings, probably the Gasworks.--(From the Emu , Jan., 1902).
CORRESPONDENCE.
COCKATOOS, CRANES, AND RAILS.
Sir, -- I have a Cockatoo, the Great Salmon-crested Moluccan, which
is very fond of fir cones. I am in the habit of giving him two or three
freshly gathered ones daily, which he strips, and eats the seeds. Will they
do him any harm ?
I should be much obliged, too, if you could tell me the cause of my
Demoiselle Crane having plucked out five of her wing feathers (one of which
I enclose for you to see) during the last few months. She is fed almost
entirety on maize, as I find she eats only very little wheat, and will not
touch barley meal. She seems in perfect health and spirits ; but, each
time she has pulled out a feather, the place has bled considerably.
Then I have just bought a South American Rail, and am anxious to
know what kind it is. It has a greenish yellow beak, blue grey breast, red
legs and large feet, and pretty golden brown wings. I keep it with my
Golden and Amherst Pheasants, and feed it with the same mixed corn and
oats. Is this right ? Octavia Gregory.
The following reply was sent to Mrs. Gregory.
One or two fir cones a day will probably not do your Cockatoo any
harm--but watch for any bad symptoms, such as feather-eating, or the half
closing of the eyes. The employment is excellent for it.
The condition of the Crane's feather which you sent me points to a
heated state of the blood and consequent irritation of the skin. This
indicates something wrong in the feeding. So much maize can hardly be
right.
Lessen the supply of maize, and give bread, biscuit (hard biscuit may
be soaked), peas, worms, slugs, snails, mice, frogs, newts, scraps from the
table, and also vegetable food of some kind. I do not know how you
keep your Crane, but it requires vegetable matter if it has not a good run.
Plant some wheat thickly--and the growing wheat will suit it well.
I take your Rail to be the Ypacaha Rail, Aramides ypacaha, from
Southern Brazil and Argentina.
It should, if possible, be supplied with insects, or something of that
nature, in addition to the corn. Or with some yolk of egg (dried flakes, 01-
hard boiled), if nothing else comes handy. Some tame Rails become very
fond of bread and milk. Reginald Phieeipps.
DISEASED BEAKS.
Sir, -- I shall be very much obliged if you can tell me what I can do
for some Gouldian Finches, who are suffering from a white cheesy growth
on their bills; it seems to be infectious, at least it has spread from one bird to

another, though not to any but Gouldians. When it is scraped off with a
penknife the beak seems to have perished, the horn being quite soft. The
birds appear to be in perfect health and plumage. B. Shepherd.
The following reply was sent to Miss Shepherd.
I cannot say what is the cause of the disease, unless, indeed, the cage
in which you keep the birds has brass wires, which might poison the beak
when corroded by verdigris; but after scraping off the cheesy growth, I
should have powdered the beaks with an antiseptic -- boracic acid or some-
thing of that kind. A. G. Butter.

PARTIAL ALBINISM IN BLACKBIRD.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9929080625" page_id="10104136"  page_num="97" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- It may interest some of our members to hear that there is a
Blackbird here in the village in East Kent, where I am visiting, which has a
white patch on one side of the head. The patch of white feathers extends
over the eye and ear and is very conspicuous. The bird is otherwise pure
black.
This Blackbird has been a regular visitor to the lawn outside the
window every winter for the last five years. He is very tame, and comes
with a crowd of other birds to be fed whenever the weather is cold or
snow}'. We have seen a good deal of him this last week, and I can answer
for his having an excellent appetite. It struck me as curious that the white
patch should not disappear when the moult takes place. Can any of our
scientific members tell me the reason why it does not do so ?
Emii/v E. West.
[With the exception of the House-Sparrow, the Blackbird is, probabl}',
the most subject to albinism or partial albinism of any British bird ; and, in
most cases at least, a bird so affected never attains the normal hue. -- E d.] (h).

Sir,--I was much pleased to see that Dr. Greene had published some
extra facts bearing upon the important point of the sexiug of Parrots, in the
last number of our Magazine.
I find that, in my little book, " Foreign Bird-Keeping," I have not
mentioned all the sexual differences in the Red-eared Bulbul. I will, there-
fore, do so now. The male is longer and stouter than the female, the bill
shorter, not abruptly tapering from beyond the nostrils, the culmen rather
more arched, the lateral depth much greater, the crown wider, feathers of
the crown and crest more glossy and jetty black, the back of a deeper more
smoky brown, tail rather blacker, under surface more purely white, less
sordid, the posterior flank feathers more prominently washed with sandy
brownish, vent and under tail-coverts of a brighter and more pronounced
rose-red ; wings distinctly longer.
(It). Some friends of ours, in Surrey, have had a Blackbird, about one-half white,
living; in their grounds for several years. It is a frequent visitor to the lawns, and is very
conspicuous, the more so as the wing&amp;apos;s are white. It is carefully preserved, as, indeed, are
all the birds.--R.P.
Albinism tends to increase with age, instead of decreasing ; I have proved this with
the Blackbird, Chaffinch, and Cordon Bleu. -- A.G.B.

I have long wished to discover some distinctive character between the
sexes of the Grey Singing-finch, and some time since, I determined to save
the skins of any which I might lose. During the last month first a female,
and then a favourite male (which I have had in full song for three years)
died. A comparison of the two skins shows that the male is decidedly
larger, nearly half-an-inch longer in the skin, but this may be partly due to
stretching; the skull is unquestionably broader, the rump is whiter, and the
abdomen, excepting at the sides, is pure white, whereas in the lien it is
washed with brownish grey like the breast, but without the darker streaks.
I should be grateful to any aviculturist who has an opportunity of doing so,
if he or she would test these characters by&amp;apos; any living or dead Grey&amp;apos;Singing-
finches in his or her possession, and let me know through the pages of the
Magazine whether they prove to be constant, as it is most desirable to know
definitely how to sex this sweet little songster (z). A. G. Butler.

THE SEXING OF GREY SINGING-FINCHES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9817088125" page_id="10104137"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
Sir,--R eferring to Dr. Butler's letter above, several years ago I
bought four of these birds, two true pairs as it transpired, as each couple
reared several young. One died the other day&amp;apos;, apparently&amp;apos; from old age,
but the other three are still flying about the aviary.
I have frequently tried to sex these birds ; of course one can often
see, from its movements, that a particular bird is a male or a female; and
one I can usually sex by its wing (Vol. VII., p. 57) ; but, from the plumage
alone, I have not often been successful. At the commencement of the
breeding season, as with the Green Singing-finch (at least it seems to be at
this season), the plumage of the male is brighter, but it does not last
throughout the y&amp;apos;ear. The clear white referred to by Dr. Butler, at any
rate in my&amp;apos; aviary, is not maintained. Neither can I always detect any
difference in size, though I think sometimes that the male seems to be a
trifle larger than his mate. Reginald Phillipps.
CORDON BLEUS, ETC.
Sir, --As I had a hen Cordon Bleu die of apoplexy in my birdroom a
week ago, I should be glad if you would advise me as to the giving of soft
food. I am wondering if I have been feeding my birds too well. I give, of
course, a plentiful supply&amp;apos; of seed--white millet, canary, Indian and spray
millet; and in addition I have every day been giving a dish of Abrahams'
mixture and grated bread or biscuit, with some preserved yolk and some-
times ants' eggs. This mixture is greedily eaten by my birds, a mixed
company of Waxbills, Bengalis, a pair of Pileated Finches, and Silverbills, etc.
This is the second winter I have had the Cordon Bleus; and I was
admiring the beauty of their plumage only' the day&amp;apos; before the lien died. I
found her to mv surprise and sorrow on the floor dying on Sunday week.
Mr. Gill certified that apoplexy was the cause of death. E. E. West.
The following reply was sent to Miss West:
You feed your birds much too sumptuously&amp;apos;. These little finches do
very much better if fed on seed alone (do not give too much white millet),
(i) Two males which I lost some years ago agree in all respects with the one which
I recently lost.--A. G. B.

with some green food in the summer. In the winter I never give raw green
food to the little birds, but plain boiled cabbage. When nesting, a little
plain biscuit and preserved j&amp;apos;oik of egg may be supplied ; and at all times a
taste of soft food may be given to the Pileated Finches. The larger the
place in which your birds live, and the more exercise they can have, the
more liberties may be taken with their food. The dried ants' eggs are, in
mj- opinion, the cause of deaths innumerable. If your Cordon partook of
them, that alone will be sufficient to account for the apoplexy.
Yes, the Cordons are beautiful little creatures. I always have some
here, and have bred several, children and grandchildren. When once
established, they are easily kept, and will live for many years.
Reginald Phiecipps.
CROWNED PIGEONS.
Sir, -- In another mouth or so, I expect to receive a pair of Crowned
Goura Pigeons from New Guinea; and perhaps some member who has kept
the species will give me information about them in the Magazine. How
should they be fed, and how should they be treated ? I particularly want
to know what shelter they require, and if the house ought to be almost
closed, or open on one side, as for Golden and Silver Pheasants.
Octavia Gregory.
[When acclimatized, the Gouras are comparatively hardy, but if
Mrs. Gregory's arrive in March they should be kept faitly warm until the
spring is somewhat advanced ; and by next winter they should be able to
stand a moderately low temperature. But with birds hailing from hot
countries it is never advisable to let the temperature of their abode fall as
low as freezing point, however hardy they may appear to be. Durin g the
summer months they should occupy an aviary, at least half of which is
open to the elements, and turfed ; the other half being roofed in and sanded
with coarse grit.
As to food, a mixture of small maize, barley, wheat, and peas should
suit them. -- E d.]
CHINESE OUAILS.
Sir, -- I have noticed no article or mention of the Chinese Painted
Quail during 1901. Will not members who bred them last summer let us
know the result ?
I was unfortunate; my hen laid nine eggs, but would not sit; and I
concluded the nest was too dry and hot.
I have sown wheat and rye grass in a compartment exposed to the
elements this year, hoping they will do better next time.
Both are well and very tame. Grace Ashford.
[Very few of these charming little birds seem to have been bred by
our members last year ; we hear of several failures but few successes.
We have found that ordinary grass is much preferred by the Quails to
wheat or rye-grass, which is too coarse. The nest is usually a hollow
scratched beneath overhanging tufts of grass, and very slightly lined with

hay. It tlie lien is missed, and a nest is suspected, it is a mistake to search
for her, as the nest is generally so cleverly hidden beneath the grass that it
is almost impossible to detect it without disturbing the surroundings, and
very possibly causing the bird to forsake. Wait patiently until she appears
with her brood of wee chicks. Fresh ants' cocoons, dug straight from the
ground with the whole nest, are the best food for the chicks at first: but
they&amp;apos; will soon pick up the small " Indian" millet. They grow wonderfully
quickly. We reared about thirty from two pairs in 1900 . -- Ed.]
ORIOLES.
Sir, --I have received a new bird, and would be grateful if you
could identify it for me. I am sending a sketch made by my wife, which
will give a nearer idea of it than any description. It comes I believe from
India, and appears to be an Oriole, I think a Kundoo. If so, I wonder if it is
a male, which I hope and am inclined to think it is, owing to the trace of a
dark marking round the eye. You will notice the irregular patching of
yellow 011 the back. It is very greedy, always gorging on bananas, and has
all the appearance and manners of a young bird, and prefers being fed from
the hand.
I understand all Orioles are streaked 011 the breast when young, and
I think the hens likewise have some streaks. Henry B. Rathborne.
The following reply was sent to Al&amp;gt;. Rathborne :
Mrs. Rathborne's interesting painting, which accompanied your
letter, shews that your bird is unquestionably an immature Oriole; and, as
the black loral spot seems to extend round and behind the eye, it is very
likely&amp;apos;, as you suggest, a Sykes' Oriole, Oriolus kundoo, from India. But, if
the black should develop into a horse-shoe band round the back of the
head, it will probably be the Black-naped Oriole, Oriolus diffusus, from India,
China, etc. The yellow patches, as represented in the picture, are indi-
cations of moult. I have kept the kindred species, the Golden Oriole, from
babyhood to the adult plumage; and, if O. kundoo passes through the same
stages, then your bird is in its second feather and about to moult into the
third.
I have been comparing your picture with an immature Black-naped
Oriole which I now possess; and it is curious to notice that, whereas the
dark markings on the bill of your bird and on that of the immature Golden
Oriole seem to be identical, the black on the bill of my Diffusus is arranged
quite differently. Moreover my bird, although not so forward as yours,
already&amp;apos; shews traces of the black horse-shoe band, which does not appear
in your drawing; all these things point almost conclusively&amp;apos;to your bird
being O. kundoo. I am not sure about the shade of y&amp;apos;ellow of the new
feathers on the back. If very bright, it is likely that your bird is a male.
The fully adult females do not, I think, have any&amp;apos; bieast streaks.
The streaks are signs of immaturity in most of the Orioles, but not in
all. For instance, the Australian Green Oriole, O. viridis, of which I have a
fine specimen, keeps its " baby " plumage all its life, and is, in this respect,
rather a scientific curiosity.

THE WOODLARK AS A CAGE-BIRD.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986179029411765" page_id="10104140"  page_num="101" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I am thinking of purchasing a Woodlark, but before doing so
I am anxious to know whether you consider it a desirable cage-h\td.
A Skylark I cannot bear to see caged, as it seems for ever dashing
about to get out, and if the Woodlark behaves in the same manner I had
much rather not have one. H. Speed.
1 he following reply was sent to Mr Speed :
A Woodlark makes a delightful cage-bird when it has become tame :
its song is less sustained than that of the Skylark, but is much varied,
liquid, rippling, and bell-like.
I have found Skylarks satisfactory cage-birds. When newly caught
they are nervous, and apt to jump up and bump their heads against the
roof of the cage ; but if the roof is made of canvas, it does not hurt them,
and they get tame very soon : hand-reared birds are better, because the}&amp;apos;
begin tame, and they add the notes of other birds to their song.
Of course you are aware that the Woodlark requires a cage with
perches; for, though it roosts on the ground at night, it is far more arboreal
in its habits than the Skylark. A. G. Butler.
THE SEVERE WEATHER.
Sir, --I was walking tln-ough the village yesterday (Feb. 12th) when
a Sparrow suddenly dropped on the road, and, in trying to rise, fell back-
wards over its tail, as a Swift will do when it tries to rise from the ground.
It was not until I took it on to my hand that it was able to fly off.
Chas. Cushny.
The folloit&amp;apos;ing reply was sent to Mr Cushny :
It was very curious about the Sparrow. Probably it had some slight
seizure, most likely from the cold, or faintness from want of food or water.
The poor wild birds suffer terribly in a severe winter, and many die. Their
case is very different from that of our own pampered pets; and aviculturists
should succour them also--with water as well as food.
Reginald Phillipps.
It is with much pleasure that we are able to announce that
the Council of the Zoological Society have decided to award its Silver
Medal to our member Mr. E. W. Harper, in consideration of his
numerous gifts of valuable Indian birds.

THE EUROPEAN BEE-EATER.
Merops cipiastcr.
By Reginald Phillipps.
A common bird is the European Bee-eater ; ho ! a rare rare
bird is the European Bee-eater--just according to circumstances.
If you will pack up your trunks, and take your walks abroad in
the summer time, you will find the species pretty generally
distributed around the Mediterranean, growing rapidly scarcer
as you travel towards the cold, though a few misguided
individuals straggle quite a considerable way northwards. In
some parts of Greece, Turkey, South Russia, Asia Minor, and
Northern Africa, at certain seasons it is common. It would like
to be common in Southern Italy, but the Italians make their
country too hot even for such a heat-loving species as the Bee-
eater, for the Italians' one idea of aviculture is to eat the birds.
Round and about Tangier, it receives a gentler welcome, for
there it breeds, or used to breed, in the walls of the courtyards
of the inhabitants. And as to Spain, well, in Southern Spain
the natives use it as a means by which to partake of their hone}',
and this is how it is done. The bees gather the honey, the Bee-
eaters partake of the bees, and the bee-owners partake of the
Bee-eaters--an arrangement which sounds as if it were perfectly
fair and equitable to all parties; and, indeed, it is only the cries
of the bee-owners which, so far, have reached our ears--but it is
not always those who shriek the loudest who are hit the hardest !
Nevertheless, on the other hand, if, like the typical
Britisher (who lets his country go to the --, to the Germans, I
mean, just from want of a little energy and enterprise), you will
not go to look for the bird, but say, " Books tell me that the Bee-
eater is a British species, and has appeared to the English, to
the Irish, yea, even to the Scotch, and it may just come and
appear to me; I will take my most comfortable arm-chair, and
sit in my garden until I see a Bee-eater" ;--well, there you may

.sit until your chair and you alike take root, or crumble into dust
as the case may be, before ever a Bee-eater will come your way.
For the majority of the stay-at-home inhabitants of these Islands
pass their lives without seeing so much as a single specimen of
this interesting species. And should you trust to the dealers, to
whom, you know, you have only just to "state your wants," you
will probably fare as badly; captive Bee-eaters, I am well aware,
have previously found their way to this country, but their visits
have been much rarer even than those of the wild bird.
Before I take up the story of the two little troublesome
pets which have stirred up my slumbering pen to write this
article, I may well say a few words about Bee-eaters generally.
There are some seventeen species of true Bee-eaters
( tl/erops ), which may be distinguished from their kinsfolk by
the elongation of the central tail-feathers (see uncoloured
illustration) ; and some one or more of these may be found in
Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, but not in America. They
are bright coloured, short legged, long winged, curved billed,
slim birds of the air, taking most of their prey on the wing ;
like Swifts when aloft, like Terns when on the ground, like
Todies ( Todus ) when sitting side by side on a perch. Like
Todies and Sand Martins, they breed in colonies, in holes in the
banks of rivers, etc., from preference, but in other holes, even in
holes on the level ground, when more convenient premises are
not forthcoming. The holes are tunnelled by the birds them-
selves with their bills, and the eggs are pure white ; no nest is
made. Mr. Layard (Royal Natural History , Vol. IV. p. 55) says
of the nest-holes:--" It does not always seledt a bank into which
to bore the hole destined for it's nest, for we found one flat piece
of sandy ground perforated with numberless holes, into which
the birds were diving and scrambling like so many rats."
The Common or European Bee-eater is the only species of
the genus which regularly visits and breeds in Europe ; but it is
by no means confined to Europe, for it's range extends as far to
the East as North-east India ; and, as has been already stated, it
breeds in Northern Africa, that continent generally being like-
wise it's winter home, where in the autumn it is by some supposed
to breed a second time; but we have no means of knowing that
the individuals which have been found breeding south of the
equator in the autumn are.the identical birds which bred or
will breed, in the previous or following summer, on the shores of
the Mediterranean.
&amp;apos;l&amp;apos;lie adult Bee-eater is about ten inches in length, and the

plumage very much more chestnut above than in the immature
bird. The scapulars and back are creamy buff; and it. is stated
that the forehead is white and the iris lemon-yellow. The throat
is bright yellow, and the under parts of a brighter and more
blue-green than in the young bird ; and a black band crosses the
lower throat, separating the yellow from the green. This black
band does not appear in the first or second feather, though I
think I detect some indications of it in the second feather. The
sexes are fairly alike; but the male is the larger and more
brilliant bird, with little or no green on the head and back. I
feel inclined to say that, as a general rule, and at most ages, the
male may be distinguished from the female by its larger size and
by having so much more chestnut (instead of green) above,
especially on the crown.
Thanks to the courtesy of our Publisher, Mr. Porter, we
are enabled to present to our readers an excellent print (from a
block in his possession) of the adult Bee-eater, shewing the
elongated central tail-feathers and the black band which crosses

<bodyText confidence="0.999436113636364" page_id="10104147"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
the lower throat. There are a few other minor differences in
colour between the young and the adult, for the bird is adorned
with quite a number of beautiful tints of yellow, blue, green, etc.
The unhealthy craving of ladies for bright colours, no matter at
what cost of avine life, causes countless numbers of these and
other Bee-eaters to be slaughtered. Doubtless, locally, perhaps
especially in Spain, the Common Bee-eater kills quantities of
honey-bees. But in many or most hot climates the number of
other bees, and of wasps and hornets of spiteful and vindictive
natures, not to mention locusts, and other hurtful creatures, is
so great that some districts would be practically uninhabitable if
it were not for the splendid services of the Bee-eaters of various
species. The tiniest Bee-eater will unhesitatingly pursue and
capture the largest hornet, killing and rendering it innocuous by
banging it against it's perch, and by passing it sideways back-
wards and forwards between it's tight-closing mandibles. These
latter close together with a spring, like the two jaws of a steel-
trap or gin, so that, when the bird is preening it's feathers, the
snip, snip, snip, of the mandibles as they close upon one another
after passing along the feathers is incessant, only to be out-done
by the tap, tap, tap, bang, bang, bang, of the side of the bill
against the perch, as it knocks the life out of numberless
imaginary wasps and hornets, the slightest atom of food or drop
of water on the bill setting it going like an "alarum." The
place of the Bee-eater in the Economy of Nature is very
important.
The immature Bee-eater is mostly green above, and lacks
the elongated central tail-feathers and the black band across the
lower throat. In both the first and second feather, judging by
my birds, the forehead is light yellow instead of white, and the
iris dark brownish. Towards the end of February, in a good
light, traces of the prospective change in the colour of the iris
were perceptible ; perhaps, if the light had been better, they
might have been detected earlier.
The bill, which appears to be black at all ages, is slightly
curved, sharp pointed, and long--considerably longer in the
adult than in the inmature bird. After the birds have been
excavating, it is usually much worn away, especially where the
soil has been hard and sun-baked ; but it grows again to it's
normal length during the off season. Probably, like the Black
Lark engaged on her nest-hollow (Vol.V., p. 170), the Bee-eater,
when tunnelling, works the bill sideways, though perhaps not
with a full right-and-left movement, I think this is probable
from what I have seen of the habits and movements of my

own birds, and also because wild specimens have been observed
with one side of the bill greatly worn. It taps the perch with
only one side of the bill ; and the bill being worn mostly on one
side might seem to suggest that it works in a somewhat similar
one-sided manner. I am unable to say which sex is the more
industrious, or whether both alike assist in the work of
excavating.
In the young and adult of this species, from and in a
straight line with the black bill, there runs backwards a black
line across and embracing the eye and terminating with the ear-
coverts, which are produced behind so as to form what might be
popularly called an external ear. When the bird is sitting in
it's ordinary posture of observation, with the head down and the
bill slightly raised, this ear is not observable ; but it becomes
conspicious when the back of the head is drawn up and the bill
is pointed downwards. It is perhaps rather more observable in
the male than in the female.
Our artist, Mr. Herbert Goodcliild, has done his best--and
a very pretty best it is--to let 11s see what young Bee-eaters in
their first feather are like. I was rather urgent that the
painting of my two birds should not be deferred, notwith-
standing the fog and darkness, for one of them seemed to be
dying ; but just as the fates have so far been disappointed of
their victim, so were they disappointed in their endeavours to
spoil the portrait; perseverance and skill gained the day; and
the painting, which was commenced on the 10th October, was
completed on the 21st., and speaks for itself. I fancied, from
the amount of chestnut on the head, that the male must have
commenced his moult before I received him, but perhaps I was
wrong ; and this may be the normal colouring of the young
male: certainly it was later before he shed feathers with me.
They moulted very slowly and gradually during the winter,
perhaps because of the comparative cold ; but it is possible that
it is a beautiful provision of Nature that birds who largely
depend on their powers of flight for obtaining their daily bread
should have a gradual moult, so as not at any time to be crippled.
It was not until February that they began to moult the breast
feathers, the bright new feathers shewing out conspicuously from
among the old, and proclaiming to all how the work was pro-
gressing in that particular region. Since their portrait was
taken, they have changed considerably, the colours of the adult
slowly but steadily superseding the green plumage of the young
birds on the upper parts ; and the bills are much longer. Perhaps,

before I complete this article, I may be able to find time, on a
bright day, to record more in detail the particulars of the
plumage up to date.
So far as we may venture to judge from an isolated case,
it will be seen that the moult of this species is a winter rather
than an autumnal one.
(To be continued ,)
THE YELLOW-EYED BABBLER.
(.Pyctorhis sinensis ).
By E. W. Harper, M.B.O.U., F.Z.S.
This delightful little bird was first acquired by the London
Zoo, in 1868, when four specimens were purchased; and, as it
has never since been represented there, I think we may take it for
granted that the species is not at all commonly imported into
England. Neither in India, its home, is the Yellow-eyed
Babbler a common cage bird ; although, in a state of freedom, it
extends almost all over the Empire. Probably the fadt of its being
attired in a somewhat sombre garb, and also that it is not what
can be called a "song-bird," account for its 11011-popularity
amongst native bird-keepers. The plumage of the bird is
rufous-brown above, and white on the chin, throat and breast ; a
white streak also extends before, above and behind the eye. The
sexes are alike. The most striking part of the bird's appearance,
however, is that from which its name is derived, namely, its eye-
lids, which are of an intense golden-yellow colour; these give
the bird the appearance of wearing a pair of spectacles. The
" spedtacle-bird " proper (Zosterops) has a ring of white feathers
round each eye ; while our little friend now under discussion
has its eyelids prominently coloured, somewhat after the
manner of a Barb Pigeon, Oates gives the bird's entire length
as "seven inches" (of which the tail measures about half) and
" the tarsus one inch." The extreme length of leg gives great
facility for hopping; the bird is an adept at clinging in ever}'
conceivable position.
Its prey is held under one foot, whilst it tears it to pieces
with its beak. In the case of maggots, the poor, unfortunate
insedts are literally stretched like elastic by the bird's foot
and beak, until they break from the strain.
What the Golden-eyed Babbler lacks in beauty of plumage
and power of song, is more than balanced by his interesting and

<bodyText confidence="0.998756704545455" page_id="10104150"  page_num="109" year="" vol="">
engaging habits. By the way, do not for a moment imagine that
he cannot sing! For, when dancing for very love before his
mate, his little head bobbing from side to side in his endeavour
to show her how much he admires her, his sweet, little voice is
heard to great advantage. Alas ! that anger and rage should
also make him sing; but true it is, nevertheless. Some weeks
ago I introduced five Golden-eyed Babblers into an aviary
already containing three of these birds. One of the new comers
was immediately surrounded by the three old tenants; who,
with glaring eyes and snapping beaks, caused him to assume a
defensive attitude by lying upon his back upon the floor, and
defending himself with feet and beak against his three assailants ;
they, meanwhile, singing and bobbing their heads from side to
side in the greatest excitement. I believe that each of the new
arrivals was " initiated " and put through his paces in the same
way; by roosting-time, however, peace--and I hope, joy--
reigned supreme ; for they were all to be seen sleeping quietly in
a row, as closely packed as the proverbial " herrings in the
barrel! "
All Babblers like society--I merely mean companionship,
not necessarily the "high society" into which some humans
(new word) are eternally striving to enter. Just as we have all
heard that there are some greedy little children who live to
eat, so the Yellow-eyed Babbler -- and all other Babblers --
live to be tickled. Failing being tickled, there is only one
other recreation under the sun that will satisfy him ; that is to
tickle someone else. When these birds are not eating, drinking,
bathing or sleeping, they are unhappy if not engaged, either
actively or passively, in the art of tickling. The one who is
undergoing the operation of being tickled holds up his head,
closes his eyes, puffs out his throat, and turns first one side of
his head and then the other to the operator--just like a man
being shaved in a barber's shop. Should the tickler cease
operations, the eyes of the tickled one are half-opened, to make
sure that the tickler has not quietly disappeared. A short time
ago, 1 put a Striated Babbler (.Argya carlii ) into the same aviary
in which the little Yellow-eyed Babblers were. Although many
times their size, he and they were soon engaged in their mutual
pastime. One little fellow, in order to reach the top of the head
of his big cousin, actually clung on to the wires of the aviary,
three or four inches above the level of the floor. If he had only
been born a biped, instead of having been hatched a Babbler,
we might have expected a display of his inventive genius !
This same Striated Babbler is a veritable ring-master ; in less

than a week he has taught a Black Drongo (Dicrurus ater) to
tickle him. This is remarkable when we remember that tickling
is as unnatural to a Drongo, as swimming to a fowl.
Stolen apples are said to be sweet. How about stolen
maggots? Frequently I have seen a little Golden-eyed Babbler
snatch a maggot from the beak of a Pied Crested Cuckoo
(Coccystcs jacobinus), which the latter had just picked up and
was about to swallow. Another of my birds which used to be
considerably annoyed by the Yellow-eyed Babbler was a Larger
Racket-tailed Drongo (.Dissemurus fiaradiscus ) ; his half-yard or
so of two wire-like tail-feathers with their knobbed extremities
were evidently regarded by the little Babbler as playthings. He
would clutch one of them in his foot, and try with his little
beak to nip off the end. PIven a man's moustache, if held close
to the wires of the aviary, is sure to be explored by the
inquisitive little bird.
Now for a few words about the Yellow-eyed Babbler's
diet. Dr. Butler's famous mixture of powdered biscuit, ants'
cocoons, egg yolk and dried flies would doubtless suit him
excellently as a staple food. Personally, whilst in India, I do as
the Indians do : that is to say, pea-meal, well mixed with a little
refined butter, forms the staple diet of nearly all my insectivorous
birds. With this is intimately incorporated, every alternate
day, a little raw, finely minced liver or kidney. Whatever food
be given, meal-worms or maggots should form part of the daily
menu. Tit bits of a hard and shell}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; nature, such as grass-
hoppers, cockroaches, dried flies, etc., must be given at intervals,
to cleanse and stimulate the digestive organs; for the same
reason that beasts and birds of prey require hair, fur, or feathers,
to keep them in continued good health. At the suggestion of
our esteemed member, Mr. F. Finn, I have tried raw, fresh-water
shrimps as an occasional food for insedtivorous birds; with
most satisfactory results. All Babblers are more or less
frugivorous, and our little yellow-eyed friend is no exception.
An orange, cut transversely, or a slice of pineapple is a great
treat. Chopped lettuce is a most useful addition to the larder of
most soft-billed birds ; P. sinensis appears to appreciate it, hold-
ing a piece under one foot as though it were an insect.
In conclusion, let me entreat the aviculturist not to confine
the Yellow-eved Babbler in an ordinary Canary cage. His
extremely adtive habits demand space ; and when an aviary is
not at hand, nothing smaller than a breeding-cage, such as is
used for Canaries, will suffice for the bird's comfort and his
owner's entertainment.

ON THE MAKING OF AN AVIARY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990596" page_id="10104152"  page_num="111" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
I have met people who possessed a "Crystal Palace Cage,"
who thought they had done all that could be recpiired in the way
of aviaries. Of such I will not stop to speak. By an aviary I
mean a fairly large enclosure where the birds have opportunity
to stretch their wings and maybe to nest.
Now, it by no means follows that because a man has
money and can put up such a place, that you would call him an
aviculturist. A man may have a big library, who never takes
down a book ; and a man may have a fine stud of horses, and
yet never ride. In the same way there are numbers of people
who tell me in confidence "that they love the dear birds, but"--
yes, there is always a 'but,'--"the English climate is so detestable,
cold searching winds, black frosts, drenching showers,--render
for them aviaries impossible. There are others, again, for
whom "aviaries are too expensive," and so they are obliged to
put up with cages.
The more I study things, and the longer I live, the more
clearly do I see that these persons do not really love birds at all ;
if they did they would overcome their difficulties, and with them
" nothing would be impossible."
A very decent aviary can be put up at a very trifling cost,
and as for climate--well, Yorkshire has samples of all sorts, and
yet I do fairly well with the dicky birds, in spite of the fact that
the air here is often what Hamlet calls " nipping and eager."
In building an aviary, it is not so much a cpiestion of
money as common sense; and I will always back the latter
commodity against the longest purse.
You must (i) Select a suitable spot. (2) You must arrange
the whole as much like nature as possible. (3) You must
lavish on your birds constant, personal, and untiring love.
Now, before trying to build, I should go and visit all the
aviaries within calling distance, and from the best points of each
I should construct my own. The one model I should severely
avoid is the Western aviary at the Zoo.
I11 this country of East winds and uncertain climate, we
are wont to exaggerate the delicacy of foreign birds, and in
countless cases the pursuit of aviculture is abandoned for want
of confidence in the ability of the birds to endure it. With a
southern aspect--because all birds love the sun--and protection

from that chartered libertine, the East wind, many of the
tenderest and most reputedly delicate foreigners will live and
thrive. I should be the last to suggest the introduction of birds
which are certain to succumb to the amenities of our charming
climate, and which seem to be continually apologising like
Charles II. for their " unconscionable time in dying." I do not
believe in " riding to a fall," but no sportsman deserves the
name who will run no risks.
It must be borne in mind that birds are far tougher than
some people think, and, given good shelter and plenty to eat,
they will take little harm and, like Hamlet, will bear the slings
and arrows of outrageous fortune.
When I first began to keep birds in the open air all the
year round, men held up, not maybe holy--but certainly aston-
ished, hands. They said that such things ought not so to be,
but when they had gazed a great while and saw no harm happen,
they, like the barbarous people of Melita, changed their minds,
and said that I was a god or something very like it.
In making an aviary, be natural. Wire there must be to
secure the inmates, but it should be as unobtrusive as possible.
Cover it over as soon as possible with trailing creepers and great
bunches of glory roses. Nature will do the work if you will
give her a free hand.
For supports choose old gnarled trunks with the bark on
and moss still adhering to them. No straight perches of joiners'
laths, but old lichen-covered branches of apple and plum
arranged as like Nature as possible.
As with a garden, so with an aviary : it is impossible to
give definite designs and absolute decrees, where often the
extent is unknown and the site and surroundings are different.
My suggestion would be to follow Nature as far as possible, and
to remember that " ars est celare artem," and we may always
rest assured of this that, where we humbly try to copy Nature
there will always be signs and tokens to guide us.
Of aviculture it is true as of everything else : "Whatsoever
thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might." Even in our
recreations we should aim at perfection, rather than remain on a
dead level or become a good all round duffer. We should take as
our motto the old words, " Quod facio, valde facio." Some men
I know have attained such stupendous heights of knowledge
that I feel before them like the insignificant worm ! They pro-
duce in me that "feeling of dropping down deadness," which

Sydney Smith used to say a certain Bishop of London loved to
see in his clergy.
It should be the primary endeavour of every true avi-
culturist to collect all the most beautiful specimens which he
can obtain, and arrange them with all the knowledge he
possesses as to their nature, dispositions, and size. He will
make some mistakes, but these will suggest their own rectifi-
cation ; whereas, all the endeavours of wealth and self-conceit
to drive out Nature with a pitchfork, will end in pitiful failure.
Again and again I have seen the most beautiful results attained
where means were scanty, but where love was large. I have
seen lamentable results of lavish expenditure but absence of all
true love. I remember once a rich man came to see my birds
with his poultryman. "Ah," he said, turning to the lad, " we
have the houses." "Yes," was the reply, "but Mr. Farrar
has the birds ! "
In every aviary there must be Seclusion, whatever else
goes short--quiet spots for rest and retirement. Our aviary
should be like Jerusalem the vision of peace." No ravenous
beast must be there in the shape of the domestic cat, it shall
not be found there. What the birds want is a place where they
may dwell safely and none shall make them afraid.
The man about to build an aviary will always meet with a
warm and fraternal welcome, and he will speedily find that one
touch of nature makes the whole avian world kin. Since I first
began to keep birds and passed from darkness to light, more or
less comparative--I have met with nothing but kindness and
help.
The third and most important rule is this. You must give
the birds close, constant, loving, personal attention. There is a
vast difference between the man who merely keeps a lot of birds
because somebody else has got them, and the man who really
loves birds for their own sake. The one pays a lad to look after
them and hardly knows their names--the other attends to them
himself and knows every sign of health and sickness. It is the
old case exemplified over again : " The hireling caretli not
because he is an hireling."
I have seen some of the saddest sights in such aviaries as
it is possible to imagine. Birds sitting about on the perches with
a sort of Roman gladiator expression, " Morituri te salutant " ;
water pots empty, rat holes abounding; and all for the want of a
little care, a little attention, a little love. You can never keep

birds by deputy. Money will do a lot of things, but money can-
not keep an aviary going ; a man may be ever so rich and yet
the humble vicarage will beat him, because the vicar, although
like S. Peter, he has " neither silver nor gold," has love and
common sense.
In the vicar's aviary you will find birds that always die
elsewhere. Many-colors rejoicing in the snow, Zosterops happy
at Christmas, Rufous-tail Grassfinches singing in spite of stormy
wind and tempest. Ask the priest how it is done ; he will tell
you that " Amor omnia vincit."
There was a time, and not so very many years ago too,
when albeit a Bachelor of Arts and also a quondam scholar of
my College--so far as foreign birds were concerned, I was sitting in
darkness and the shadow of death. I could not have told you
the name of the commonest bird that hops, and had I gone in
for an examination on foreign birds, I should have undoubtedly
received a polite intimation that I had "failed to satisfy the
examiners."
Since then I have read every book I could lay hands on ;
I have interviewed countless patient aviculturists; and the birds
I have bought and lost would fill a fair sized cemetery. I have
at present enough travelling cages to start a bird shop ; and as
for boxes, I could keep the house in firewood for six months--
and yet I am not satisfied ; but, like Oliver Twist, am " always
asking for more." My wife often tells me that I am a perfect
godsend to the dealers, as they all know that they can pack off
their rubbish to Micklefield, and it is sure to be kept; and sad
prophecies are frequently uttered that we shall end our days in
Tadcaster Union. Let us hope not: "Video meliora."
Sometimes, when I go and see a very gorgeous #\o&amp;lt;e&amp;gt;
aviary, I feel "a little bit down," as they say up here; some-
thing like Martha Penny felt anent the Dissenting Meeting
House after she had witnessed the gorgeous ceremonial of Rome :
" Law," she said, " but it do look mean and pokey ! " But then
I think of a story told of Sir Tatton Sykes. A visitor, small in
stature but large in self importance, severely criticised some of
the famous thoroughbreds. " Well," said Sir Tatton, "perhaps
you are right, we can't get everything we want. If we could,"
he added drily, " perhaps your father would like you to have
been a little longer in the leg! " but there, you can't have
everything! !

By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
[Mr. Frank Finn has kindly sent us a copy of The Asian
Sporting Newspaper , to which he is contributing a series of
articles entitled " How to know the Indian Waders," and in
which we find the following interesting and practical paper on
this momentous and burning question, to which we draw the
special attention of our readers.--R.P.]
HERONS.
The true Egrets, with which we are now concerned,
have attained a melancholy celebrity on account of our own
woman-kind looking with an envious eye on their wedding gar-
ments. For the nuptial plumes of these birds, which are long,
with thread-like, disunited webs, constitute what are known in the
plumassiers'jargon, for some inscrutable reason, as "osprey."
To obtain these, the poor birds have been most ruthlessly killed
off in many places, notably in America and in China, and
although such destruction has not overtaken them here as yet,
they have not altogether escaped by any means. The special
cruelty of killing Egrets for their plumes lies, of course, in the
fact that they bear them only when breeding, and that thus the
helpless young are left to starve when their parents have been
shot down. There has been lately some attempt made to
effectually stop this atrocity by rendering the wearing of " osprey
plumes " a legal offence ; and certainly something ought to be
done, for to kill a brooding bird is not only an unsportsmanlike
and cowardly act, but is set down as a serious sin in the Old
Testament. At the same time, it seems to me that in this case,
as in so many others, a compromise can be effected. The Ostrich,
whose plumes were once his cause of destruction, has now been
domesticated for their sake, and thus given a better chance of
survival than he ever could have had otherwise ; and I should
like to suggest that a similar policy be followed with our Egrets.
I have heard of an Egret-farm in Algeria ; and no doubt our birds
could be kept to supply plumes at a very cheap rate, if allowed
the run of a shallow tank enclosed in a wire-netting fence, and
fed on small fish, shrimps, chopped refuse meat, &amp;c. Another
plan would be to regulate the taking of the birds, making the
capture of Egrets a monopoly of licensed bird-catchers, who
should pay a tax to Government, and be under strict obli-
gations to let the birds go after clipping off the coveted plumes.

This would do the birds no harm, and ensure the ladies a con-
stant supply of what is undoubtedly a very beautiful article of
decoration.
That the idea of taxing wild birds of their plumes, so to
speak, is not an impracticable one has been proved by practical
experience in several instances. In Central America the natives
before the Spanish conquest habitually treated the magnificent
Ouezal or Resplendent Trogon ( Pharomacrus mocinno) in this
way; no one was allowed to kill the bird, but it might be
limed and robbed of its yard-long, burnished-green train,
for royal wear only. Similarly, in the Sandwich Islands, the
O--o, ( Acrulocercus nobilis ), a large black Honey-Sucker, was
regularly caught and despoiled of two brilliant yellow tufts grow-
ing under the armpits, which were wanted for the regal feather-
mantles. Both birds have survived to the present day, whereas
had they been killed outright for their feathers they would
undoubtedly have been exterminated long ago. Indeed, this has
happened with another Sandwich Island bird used for this
purpose, the Manio (Drepanis pacifica). This bird was about
half yellow, and hence either had to be killed outright or could
not stand so much plucking.
Of course, I don't for a moment advocate that Egrets
should be plucked ; clipping off the plumes would be the proper
course to pursue in all such cases, and this should be insisted on.
Thus a valuable product would be secured at very little incon-
venience to the birds, and an additional motive would be given
for their protection, while the Government might derive some
benefit from the licences.
After this somewhat lengthy discussion of Herons' and
Women's Rights, we will proceed to the discrimination of the
different kinds of Egrets. They are all, as 1 said before, long
slender birds ; and their necks are closely feathered and hence
look particularly slim. They have the usual sedentary and
piscatorial habits of Herons, and all associate when breeding.
They are always all white, and, except for size, look very much
alike out of the breeding season. At that time, however, they
are sufficiently distinct, as each has a different style of trousseau,
which, as usual in Herons, is worn by the bridegroom as well as
the bride ; and it is amusing to note that the smaller the bird, the
more elaborately it dresses. There are three sizes of Egrets, of
which the biggest is : --

THE LARGE EGRET.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.894965634146341" page_id="10104158"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
(Herodias alba).
Native names : Mallang-bogla, Torra-bogla , Tar-bog/a,
Burra-bogla , Hind.; Dhur-bogla, Bengali; Pedda-tcllakonga ,
Telugn ; A/ala-konga, Gond. ; Vella-koku , Tamils of Ceylon ;
Baddadcl-koku, Cingalese.
This Egret is nearly up to the typical Heron size, being
about a yard long, with the wing nearly fifteen inches, shank
six, and bill a little shorter. But these are merely average
measurements, for it is a most variable species in size; the wing
may be only thirteen inches, or as much as seventeen, and the
shank only just over five or more than eight. The colour cannot
very well vary, being white only ; but the bird puts on a splendid
train of plumes in the breeding season, reaching several inches
beyond the tail. At this time also its complexion (presumably
under the influence of intense jealous} 7 !) undergoes a change ;
ordinarily both bill and face are yellow, but at nesting-time the
bird gets green in the face and black in the bill. The legs are
always black, and the eyes yellow like those of most Herons.
The bird is found practically all over the world, but does
not seem very numerous anywhere. In England it of course
gets shot at sight for being a "casual straggler" ; and in New
Zealand it was so well known as a rarity, and so much admired,
that, " welcome as the Kotuku " was a Maori proverb. The
Maories used to keep the bird alive when they could get it, and,
I regret to say, pluck its plumes regularly.
With us this species is a resident, though migratory in
some instances. It is less fond of society than the smaller sizes
of Egret, but will condescend to associate with these in the
social gatherings so much affedted by Herons at the breeding
season. This is during the rains, whenever these may happen to
fall. The eggs are blue-green, and generally three in number.
On account of its great size, which would render it more
secure against the attacks of vermin, this Heron would be a
particularly good species to keep alive in enclosures for the
supply of plumes. It does well in captivity, one having lived
for over twenty years in the Calcutta Zoological Garden, during
which time he must have grown and dropped many pounds'
worth of plumes. He was not a bird of the most genial
disposition; indeed, I used to call him " Hannibal chollop,"
because, like that celebrity's, his motto seemed to be " Two feet
in a circular direction is all I require."

(Herodias intermedia).
Native names: Patangka or Patokha bogla, Karchia-bogla,
Hind. ; Puruwallai-koku , Tamil of Ceylon.
This size of Egret corresponds, when in winter plumage,
very closely with the last, but it has a proportionately shorter bill,
and is smaller, though not very much less than small specimens
of the Large Egret, the total length being twenty-six inches,
and the wing a foot. The shank, however, is less than five inches
long, and the bill under four. In complexion, and in the change
thereof in the breeding season, it resembles the Large Egret,
but it carries a more costly wedding-robe, having "osprey"
plumes not only on the back but on the breast also. The train
is particularly long, sometimes reaching nearly a foot and a half,
and almost touching the ground.
This species is found throughout a large portion of the
warmer regions of the Old World, from Africa to Australia. It
is resident with us, and breeds in closepacked colonies in trees,
laying four pale blue-green eggs. It is a particularly tame
species, often breeding in towns, and on this account and of the
abundance of plumes it carries, would be particularly suitable
for protective cultivation in the open.
THE SMALL EGRET.
(Herodias garzetta).
Native names: Kilchia or Karchia bogla, Hind.; Nella
nucha konga, Telugu ; Sudu-koka , Cingalese.
This smallest size of Egret is only a little over two feet
long, with an eleven-inch wing, and four-inch shank and
bill, the last-named member being thus proportionately longer
than in the two larger species. The bill is always black and the
face yellow ; the legs are black, and the toes more or less yellow.
In breeding dress this bird carries a train of the usual style, but
gracefully turned up at the end; it also has a tuft of breast-
plumes, but these are simply long ordinary feathers, not filamen-
tous ones; and a crest of two long ordinary plumes adorns the
head.
This dainty looking bird inhabits practically all the
warmer parts of the Old World, and is a resident with us; it is
more prolific than the other species, laying as many as half-a-
dozen eggs. For aviary cultivation this would be the best
species of our three ; but there is a better species of even smaller
size in America, with filamentous plumes on head, breast and
back: -- the Snowy Egret ( Leucophoyx ca?ididissima).

Many of our readers will be interested to learn that a
consignment of these interesting little finches reached the
London Market in January ; and, as most of them were offered
for sale at a business, as contrasted with a fancy, price, they were
soon scattered about the country in the homes of various lovers
of small seed-eaters. Hitherto, so far as our knowledge of the
matter extends, the species has been represented in this country
only at uncertain intervals by a few straggling pairs.
All of us know the "Double-banded'' Finch; and many
of us have expressed surprise that a name so simple and well
adapted should be so often rejected in favour of that ot
" Bicheno&amp;apos;s Finch." The reason is that there are two Double-
banded Finches; and the name "Bicheno's Finch" has been
given to our old familiar friend to distinguish it from the species
which now claims our attention.
I have placed my new arrivals, consisting--judging by the
plumage--of birds of different ages, conditions, and sexes, in a
flight cage near to that occupied by my Bicheno's ; and as I look
from one to the other, and compare their plumage, voices, and
movements, and observe how like they are to one another, I
wonder to myself why they should have been treated by scientists
as specifically distinct. I am not finding fault--quite the
contrary ; but I cannot help feeling that, if a number of the two
were thrown together in a confined space, in a warm climate,
they would interbreed and get mixed up together as readily as
Gouldiaus have. But, after all, this sage remark applies nearly
as forcibly to other closely allied species, such as the Masked
with the White-eared, and the Parson with the Long-tailed,
Grassfiuches.
The Bicheno's Finch (Stidoptcra bichenovii) is found,
broadly speaking, in North-east and Eastern Australia; and it's
place is taken in the Northern Territory and in North-west
Australia by the Ringed Finch. The lower back of Bicheno's
Finch is white, and the lower back of the Ringed Finch
is black; and this distinction has caused persons in this
country who are unacquainted with it's real name to call it the
Black-backed Finch. Not only is this name not nearly such a
happy and distinctive one as that of Ringed Finch, but it is a
name which has already been given by the Australians to

PocphiLa alropygialis, a rare Grassfinch which was discovered not
so many years ago, and which, not so many years ago, eluded
even Dr. Bowdler Sharpe (Br. Mus. Catalogue ; Vol. XIII, p.375).
We and the Australians, thanks to the Boers and Mr. Chamberlain,,
are now one people ; and it will be a pity, as has been done with
several other species, if we call the Ringed Finch by a name
which properly belongs to a quite distinct species, and which we
may hope some enterprising dealer will before very long
introduce to the aviculturists of this country. When it arrives,
let us be ready with its proper name, and not thoughtlessly
dispose of the name beforehand.
Mr. Keartlaud, quoted by A. J. Campbell in Nests and Eggs
of Australian Birds, says of the Ringed Finch, " This pretty
Finch was only seen near the Fitzroy River, where it was
breeding during February and March. By a close observation of
the material used it is possible to determine to which species of
Finch the nest belongs. The Ringed Finch usually chooses a site
in some drooping branch about ten feet from the ground. In
the case of those examined the outer covering was invariably
very coarse--dead grass loosely woven together--but the lining
was of the finest silver-grass, and a marvel of neatness. Six
eggs form the usual clutch. Although some were perfectly white,
one clutch from which I caught the bird had a faint bluish tinge,
similar to those of the Chestnut-eared Finch."

Witherby was joined by two taxidermists who were to accompany

BIRD NOTES.
A short time ago. Professor Newton invited our members to try which
birds would eat mistletoe berries, but so far we have heard no further on
the subject. Apparently mistletoe berries are not very readily eaten bv an}&amp;apos;
wild birds, and it is not until severe weather sets in and other food becomes
scarce, that these berries are taken. Mr. F. Boyes, of Beverley, wrote thus
to the Field of March 1st, last:
The berries oil the mistletoe remained untouched until the spell of severe weather a
fortnight ago, when the ground became covered with snow, and the birds were driven
almost to starvation. Then it was, on the last day before the thaw, that everv berry in the
garden disappeared. I think, though I am not certain, it was the Redwings which got
them, for these birds were then remarkably tame through hunger, and they are always the
first to suffer during frost. The Mistletoe Thrushes are singing finely now the winter has
gone. They might have taken the berries, for they came about the garden during the frost.
The Zoologist for Feb. contains an interesting account of the South
African Ground Hornbill or Brom-vogel (Bucorax cajer) from the pen of Mr.
W. L. Sclater. This bird (of which an illustration is given) inhabits the
eastern half of Cape Colony, where it is known as the " Turkey Buzzard"
or "Wild Turkey." They move about the country in small flocks and feed
entirely on the ground, and, unlike other hornbills, they walk and do not
hop. All kinds of insects and grubs, snakes, frogs, lizards, tortoises, rats,
and mice, form the food of this species.
The South African Natives attach magical properties to the Brom-
vogel, chiefly in connection with the production of rain. "The Kaffirs of
the eastern portion of the Colony," writes Mr. Sclater, " during times of
severe drought, will kill one by order of the ' rain doctor.' A stone is then
attached to its neck, and it is flung into a ' vlei,' or sometimes into a river.
The idea is that the bird, having an offensive smell, will make the water
sick, and that, in order to remedy this state of things, rain will fall in great
quantities, which will flush out the ' vlei ' or river."
"In captivity," Mr. Sclater proceeds, "this bird makes a charming
and delightful companion ; it is very sociable, and loves to come and squat
close to one to be petted. It is most useful in the garden, as it spends a
great deal of its time searching for caterpillars, snails, worms, and grubs of
all kinds; should, however, any young chickens or ducks be about, it is

Sir, --The Gouldian Finch seems to be rather subject to this affection
which, however, occurs in many other species. The best result is obtained
by scraping off the growth directly it is first noticed--if it has made
much progress, the case is practically hopeless--and then painting the
part with a solution of ten grains of nitrate of silver to one ounce of
distilled water. The application may have to be repeated a second time.

BREEDING EXPERIENCES IN OUTSIDE AVIARY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99815359375" page_id="10104163"  page_num="122" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I think it may interest some of the members of the Society to
hear that I have successfully reared three young Saffron Finches, in an
outside aviary without any heat whatever. My outside aviary has a run of
eight feet by four feet and height 6 feet, with a wooden house at the end, in
which are the nest boxes of different kinds, and seed hoppers and swinging
perches; so that the birds get exercise inside when shut in on account of
the weather; but I find both in snow and rain they are usually outside all
day; during the night they are shut in. They have a good sized enamelled
tin dish of fresh water each day on the ground in which they bathe, all
weathers.
In October, 1899, I stocked it with the following birds, viz., a pair of
Popes; a pair of Cardinals ; a pair of White Java Sparrows (these, in the
Autumn of 1900, laid several sets of eggs, but never sat, and the hen died of
exhaustion); two pairs of Budgerigars; and a pair of Saffron Finches
(which reared three broods last Autumn) all of which are still living and
thriving outside. The first Winter I put a small lamp in the house all day
during the very cold weather, but took it out at night when the birds
were shut up, for fear of fire; but have never required to do this again.
I found the two pairs of Budgerigars did not agree, so I took one pair away.
In January, 1901, I had three young Budgerigars, but, unfortunately, one
very severe night, after a span of warm weather, they were found dead in
the nest. I am expecting a young brood of Budgerigars to be hatched
out soon.
I have also succeeded in rearing some Green Singing Finches in a
large aviary cage that stands in a corridor, where they are seen by everyone,
and they did not mind a bit being looked at.
I have not been successful with Gouldians. The hen has twice been
egg-bound, and another time laid an egg at the bottom of the cage: so,
finding it was of no use, I have taken away the nest and hope for better
luck next Autumn. The cock is in most lovely plumage. I give them
Setaria glanca seed occasionally, which they seem to like very much; but
the}- are difficult birds to cater for. They eat very little, I find ; but have a

till each of canary-seed, red millet, and fine and white millet mixed. They
do not care for green food of any kind, nor banana or apple, so it is very
difficult to make a change in their diet. I am not able to put my Gouldians
outside, as I do not come down to the country until August, when it would
be too late to put them into an outside aviary for the first time; so I keep
them in a cage by themselves.
All my foreign birds like the red millet better than the white, and I
give them occasionally "Arthur's mixture" mixed with cold potatoes. And
I find the birds in the outside aviary are very fond of cold potato by
itself, when I place it between the mesh of the aviary.
I have never found the Green Singing Finches or Saffron Finches
the least bit quarrelsome or egg-eaters. I give all my birds scraped cuttle-
fish bone and rock-salt; I do not find that they care for the salt. The
Budgerigars are the only troublesome birds I have had : they killed the
first nest of young Saffron Finches and quarrelled together, so I had to
take them out of the aviary until the young Saffrons got old enough to
take care of themselves ; and I only put back one pair, which are now
nesting. The Popes and Cardinals have not attempted to breed.
I planted a small fir tree in the centre of the run and a box in each
corner, and the run is gravelled over ; but the fir tree was soon destroj&amp;apos;ed ;
the box trees, however, are still living. Mary Mii.^kr.

[The following extracts from a letter received from the Rev. H. D.
Astley (published by permission), and written from the Island of Teneriffe
"in almost constant and brilliant sunshine, with the temperature night
and day at 68*," will probably interest many of our readers. The species he
refers to is quite new to me, but the painting enabled me without difficulty
to identify the bird as a male Hooded Siskin (Chrysomitris cucullata )--
exemplifying the great value of coloured plates. &amp;apos;\0x25A0&amp;apos;\0x25A0Habitat --Venezuela and
Trinidad. Introduced into Cuba and Porto Rico."--R. P.]
I am enclosing you a very rough water-colour sketch of a lovely little
bird that I bought in Santa Cruz, and whose proper name I do not know.
Can you identify him for me ? I have never seen him in England, which
may be an oversight on my part. It is a Finch from Caracas (South America)
which is imported to Teneriffe, and mated with the Wild Canary, producing
a mule-binl like a Wild Canary dipped in saffron. The Caracas Finch is
called "Cardinal" by the Teneriffe people. I have also got a " mista
Canaria," alias a hybrid Canary; the father is the little orange Caracas
Finch, and the mother a Wild Canary.
Both these birds are thought highly of by the people in Santa Cruz.
The "Cardinal" (so-called) has a vivacious merry little song, which
reminds one of a Goldfinch and a Linnet (or Siskin); and his ways are very
much like a Goldfinch's.
He has a shrill little call-note (or perhaps an alarm-note), like a
\0x25A0sw^-sounding slate pencil drawn for half a second along a slate. Such a
jolly little bird, and quite tame when I let him out of his cage in a room.
The hybrid takes very much more after the Canary (Wild) than after
the "Cardinal."
It is the shape and size of the former, with it's song almost exactly

reproduced. In colour, it is just as if you took a Wild Canary and dipped
it in a dye-pot of saffron orange. The greenish yellow of the Canary
tempers the orange, and tones it down; and a very pretty bird is the
consequence. He lias a suspicion of a darker head than a Canary, but
nothing so marked as his father's !
The "Cardinal" would make (if properl}&amp;apos; painted) a charming
subject for an illustration.
The Wild Canary is the commonest bird on this island ; and it's song
all about makes one think one is perpetually passing by some outdoor
aviaries! You see them in large flocks, like one sees Linnets in England.
Hubert D. Asteey.
[The Hooded Siskin (adult male) is about four inches in total length,
the general colour being vermilion of different shades, with black markings
on the wings. The quills and tail-feathers are nearly black, the thighs and
abdomen white, while the crown of head, sides of face, ear-coverts, cheeks,
and throat are black. The female is different, and the colours of the young
male are oversliaded with brown.--R. P.]
THE CROWNED CRANE: NOTES ON PINIONING.
Sir, --Yesterday I received a Crowned Crane, and had it's wings cut
on arrival. Would you kindly advise me as to whether I should have him
pinioned later on ? as the feathers growing again I suppose there is risk of
his flying away if not done just at the right time. He has been two years
in England, kept in a run five yards square, shut up in a house at night,
and fed on maize, boiled potato, and bread and milk. Being in such a
confined space, it seems extraordinary he should be in such beautiful
plumage. How should he be fed ? Do they dance like the others ? he
seems so slow in his movements, but perhaps has not yet recovered from
his journey. I suppose it will do him no harm shutting him up at night?
he has no objection, and they told me he would be noisy early in the
mornings unless I did so.
I imagine that my bird is the Balearic or Western Crowned Crane
(Balearicn pavonina) as it comes from West Africa, and has so very little
white on the face, and no wattle under the chin; the body too is of a dark
slate colour. The plumage is very fine. Octavia Gregory.
The f)llu 7 ving reply was sent to Mrs. Gregory.
I should most strongly advise that the bird should be presently
pinioned--when the weather becomes more genial. There is great risk of
the exact time for feather-cutting being allowed to slip by. For the feathers
coming down in the "pen" cannot be effectually shortened, as they will
continue to grow, perhaps sufficiently to allow of the escape of the bird.
While, if the operation is delayed until the moult is completed, a windy
day may come, and, if the captive is alarmed or excited, he may easily rise
high enough to get over the fences, etc.
Moreover, the periodical handling arouses suspicion,and the pinioned
bird tames much more readily.
I have superintended the operation in the case of many species, from
the Whooper Swan to the Chinese Quail, and have never lost a bird. But,
on the other hand, I have lost not a few by escape ; or by the bird falling

<bodyText confidence="0.993975770833333" page_id="10104166"  page_num="125" year="" vol="">
into danger, after getting out of it's enclosure. I once lost a fine pair of
Common Cranes, by a fox, from this cause. And, only three years ago,
three of the magnificent Mantchurian Cranes escaped from Woborn, from
being imperfectly pinioned, and were murdered in this district (E. Yorks.),
having been able to stray so far.
A Crane, like a Seagull, can fly with a considerably shortened wing ;
and it is necessary, in pinioning them, to take at least eight feathers off, if
their enclosure is spacious enough for them to take a run against a head
wind.
I may add that three persons are required to operate on a bird of the
size of one of the larger Cranes.
In the case of a waterbird, the cold water staunches the bleeding at
once. Rut it is surprising how little notice any bird takes of this operation,
if quickly performed; and it appears to mind it a good deal less than it's
owner.
As regards the food of the Crowned Cranes, in the splendid collection
of these birds at Lilford, the two species are represented ; and I find on
enquiry that they are fed entirely on grain, bread, and barley meal. And
there they do not appear to care for animal food of an}- sort, contrary to
what has been recorded of these birds in the wild state, where they are
both described as feeding on small reptiles, and wading in flooded places
after fish (Tegetmeier's ' Monograph of the Cranes.'*) In the same work,
Buffon is quoted as having found that a Western Crowned Crane in his
possession preferred boiled rice to anything else. vSome Sarus and Demoi-
selle Cranes of mine are all very fond of .Spratt's meal and crissel, scalded,
and dried into a crumbly mass with ground oats. This, with grain of
various kinds, boiled potato, and bread, is their food ; besides what they
can pick up in their enclosure, which in summer amounts to a good deal.
Except in warm weather, the bird under notice had much better be
shut in at night. In fact it would be wise, in every possible respect, to
continue, during the cold weather, the treatment to which it has been
accustomed.
At Lilford Hall, the Crowned Cranes are shut in all the winter in
sunny, but unheated, houses.
As to whether the Crowned Cranes dance -- I am almost certain that I
have seen them do so at Lilford. Mr. Tegetmeier's Enlarged Reprint of
Blytli's 'Monograph of the Cranes,' on p. 22, speaks of the B. pnvonina
dancing. I think there can be no doubt about it at all. But a bird of this
size, which has for two years been confined in a ' cage ' five yards square,
would scarcely find room to ' do his steps ' ! I am well pleased to hear that
he will have more space now, at his new home. W. H. ST. Quintin.
[Note. -- There is also the Cape Crowned Crane, Baleaiica chrysopelar-
gus, which has the bare sides of the face white with a line of vermilion on
the upper margin, which is rounded. I11 the Museum Catalogue, a third
species is recognised, B. gibbericeps, in which the upper margin of the bare
face is produced in a small triangle to the sides of the occiput. -- R. P.j

I have had an interesting experience with my pair of old
Rheas. The female laid twenty-three eggs, some of them many
weeks after the male had commenced to sit. After sitting the
usual six weeks he hatched ont six strong little birds and left the
nest with these. I took nine eggs which remained in the nest
and placed them under large barn-door fowls, one of which
hatched out two young Rheas shortly afterwards. On the
appearance of these strange youngsters, when the eggs burst
open in two halves with a slight explosion, the hen immediately
rushed away with a cry of terror, leaving the chicks to their fate.
I thereupon wrapped them in flannel until the evening when
they were put under the male Rhea, who took to them all right.
The accompanying photograph shows the male Rhea with
the eight chicks, nearly full grown, being fed by me.
The Rhea is a native of South America, and inhabits a
district of country about 200 miles in breadth running from the
north-east to the south-west, (a)
My experience with these birds, during many years, is as
follows : --The hen lays her eggs promiscuously about the field,
and her mate, with his beak, collects them into a hollow, which
he scoops out in the ground. He then sits and hatches out the
young birds in 42 days. The female has nothing further to do
in the matter, and, in fact, is apt to tease her mate and cause
trouble if not removed into another field. The male Rhea
becomes exceedingly savage and dangerous during the breeding
season, and, at that time of the year, makes a loud, booming
sound which I have heard quite a mile away. The female makes
no sound whatever.

[Note. --The first part of this article had to be published
last month, to accompany the coloured plate, but it was
premature in the sense that my Bee-eaters had not completed
their moult, were not in fact so far advanced as I had supposed.
After moulting the breast feathers (p. 107), to my surprise they
commenced moulting, both together almost to the day, the fore-
head, cheeks, and throat down to the black line. This throat-line
has now become fairly distinct, so that my statement on page 105
that it is absent in the second as in the first feather of this species
cannot stand. The light colour of the forehead, hitherto a
narrow line of yellow, now extends backwards towards the
crown, but the future colour remains doubtful : at present it is a
light green. The eyes of both the birds remain dark. The ends
of the tail have been somewhat broken, but the elongated central
feathers were, I think, attained at the close of the year, and the
female still retains one perfect elongated specimen, which is but
little longer than the others. The last of the old flights, an
inner secondary, was shed on March 30; they&amp;apos; - have been some
four months moulting these and the tail feathers, just dropping
one or two at uncertain intervals, exemplifying my suggestion
which appeared on page 107. The bills, which are of a dense
dull-black colour, are a good deal longer, a little stouter, and
more decurved than figured at page 105. The black band, also,
which runs from the bill to the ear-tufts, is broader, and
practically in a straight line with the bill.--R. P., April 4, 1902].
In September last I received an affectionate invitation from
a London dealer to come and pay him a visit, as he had a pair of
young Bee-eaters which he thought I might "like to see."
According to his account, they had been taken from a nest in
Roumania (the}'' breed along the banks of the Danube) ; and he
had purchased them in Vienna, and had himself brought them to
this country.
This invitation sorely exercised my mind. There had
been a time when the subject of Bee-eaters had been brought
rather prominently before me, and I had even entertained visions
of having them flying about in my aviary as plentifully as
Weavers and breeding as freely as Bengalis ; but I knew enough

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99914188372093" page_id="10104172"  page_num="129" year="" vol="">
about them by this time to hold very different views. And now
I am old, and have my hands very full ; and to have such a
handful as a pair of baby Bee-eaters would, I thought, be the
proverbial last straw that would assuredly finish off my already
partially broken back. I have an unfortunate weakness for
getting hold of most troublesome and burdensome species, and
had been bitten so often that I was very shy of the invitation.
But I did want "just to see" the birds,--and, I argued that,
behind the enormous price the dealer would ask, I should be able
to beat a not too undignified retreat, and so, on the following
morning, went to meet my fate. They were in better condition
than I had expected to find them, but had been fed, as I had
suspected, solely on mealworms. To keep a bird for weeks or
months solely on mealworms is not impossible, however
detrimental to the bird's health ; but no bird can last under such
conditions, and where could a substitute for the mealworms be
found ? Birds like these will never look at insectivorous food;
and I gave this, and the heavy price demanded, as reasons for
declining the birds, and turned to depart. " Then what zvill you
give ?" asked my friend, and I responded--" Well, I suppose I
cannot offer less than so much," mentioning just half his price,
and expecting a prompt dismissal.--But, no, I was not to be let
go so easily. " If I cannot find anybody else to buy them, I will
let you have them." This was not a bit what I had intended;
and I went home slowly and sorrowfully ; and rating myself
soundly for my weakness and folly.
A few days later came the much-dreaded letter :--I could
have the birds at my price ; and, on the 20th September, 1901,
like a man crawling to the scaffold, I once more entered the
fatal door. One of the Bee-eaters was looking fairly well, the
other fairly unwell; and in their cage there was a dish of the
nicest-possible-looking moistened ants' cocoons that bird-lover
ever beheld. Our friend, by the way, sells ants' eggs, as well
as mealworms, and always has a good word for them. " Have
you got any ants' eggs ? they will do well if you feed them on
ants' eggs and mealworms ! " and he drew my attention to the
dish in the cage :--but, alas ! I knew full well that that dish so
artfully prepared had not been prepared for the Bee-eaters to
swallow -- but for me! "You have them cheap," shouted he
after me as I walked down the steps--" CHEAP ! !! " And from
his point of view they were--but from my point of view they
were dear at any price ; and, instead of bearing my Bee-eaters
home in triumph, I returned as downcast and depressed as I felt,

but a few weeks later, when I found myself constrained to take
up the Secretaryship of the Avicultural Society.
I had prepared a cage in my dining-room, 6 ft. long by
2 ft. by 2 ft., and had arranged the perches as best I knew how
for the reception of the Bee-eaters, the open food saucers being
placed on two little tables which raised them to the level of the
lowest perch, which ran parallel with them along the lightest
end of the cage, a few inches above the ground. In theory,
the arrangements were perfect, but they did not work out
properly in practice. The birds cuddled together on a high
perch, and never budged an inch, and to save them from
starvation I tried to hand-feed them. They were ravenously
hungry, and pecked wildly at what I offered, but seemed quite
unable to take the food from my fingers, and eventually became
discouraged and gave it up. To make a long story short, I
discovered two points about them for which I was totally un-
prepared. I found that, accustomed as a species to the intense
glare of an African sun, they could not see except in a very
good light--which was decidedly encouraging when I thought of
the fogs and general gloom of a London winter. For years the
cage had been standing on the side of a large bay window, in
excellent light for London, and birds of many kinds had
approved of the position. The new tenants, however, could not
see to move about, much less to take food, and there was
nothing for it but to swing the cage round so as to bring it
nearly across the front of the window--an excellent arrangement
for the birds, but one which so darkened the room (for there was
another cage of the same superficial dimensions, but loftier, on
the top of the Bee-eaters') that I and my birds, Bee-eaters and
all, would have found ourselves in a warm corner if the Queen
of the Establishment were not exceptionally amiable, and as
keen an aviculturist as myself. Even with the cage in this
unexceptionable position, on the bright mornings, they would
not venture down to the food dishes until after 9 o'clock, and on
dull days not till later ; and in the afternoons, after having been
caught a few times by evening gloom before they were safe in
bed, they stopped feeding about 2 o'clock. Three powerful
hurricane lamps did not seem to aid them in the least; so that
for a good part of the winter, during which they were slowly
moulting, I could rarely get them to feed as much as 5-6 hours-
out of the twenty-four, a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.
Their great terror in the afternoon was lest they should be
caught by the dark ; and, although I would lift them down to-
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.997927357142857" page_id="10104174"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
the dishes, they would not feed. The shortening, and later the
lengthening, of the days puzzled them immensely, and the latter
was productive of comical scenes. In the early afternoon they
would be safe in bed; but darkness came not, and hunger
pinched them, and the food dishes were inviting; and after
much chattering they would cautiously sidle along downwards in
the direction of their dining tables, rushing back to bed after
partaking of a hurried snack.
After a while, rather a pretty state of affairs was developed,
a representation in avine life of Noel Patou's beautiful picture
"Faith and Reason," which will be remembered by our members
north of the Tweed. Whenever the Bee-eaters are in the
slightest difficulty, it is their custom to call out for Daddie ; and
eventually the hen became so satisfied that sooner or later I
would come and put her safely and comfortably to bed that she
ceased to be frightened at the approach of the gloaming: she
had faith in me ; but the male, trusting to his own reasoning,
would not feed so late, even if lifted down, but would rush
frantically off to bed.
During this present almost unprecedented foggy March,
the} 7 both seem inclined to leave everything to me. Having
learned wisdom from experience, they proceed to their dining-
room at the latest possible moment, and then, after feeding,
sitting side by side, they commence whistling for me ; and there
they sit and whistle until I come and put them to bed In doing
this, I just take hold of them across the back with their heads
towards me, and place them on the long sloping bough which
terminates in the bedroom at the extreme upper inner corner of
the cage; and then they sidle along to bed. But this act, simple
as it may seem, has to be executed with discrimination.
Occasionally, after seeing them safe to bed, perhaps an hour or
so later, I would hear agonizing calls for help, and, on coming to
the room, would find the excited male craning over the side of
the bed, and whistling:
" Oh where, oh where is my little wife gone,
Oh where, oh where is she-e-e-e ? "
and down below, demurely and quietly squatting on the floor,
and patiently awaiting my arrival, would I find the poor little
woman. I would place her on her perch, and then the two, as
if drawn together by some irresistible magnetic power, sidling
along the perch, would rush sideways towards one another
until they came into contact, when they would cuddle together,

shake out their feathers, utter a few warbling whistles or
intense satisfaction, and settle down for the night.
These falls, at night, of the female from her perch
concerned me greatly, for she had always betrayed a pre-
disposition to apoplexy ; and some time elapsed before my mind
was relieved by discovering the real cause of the out-of-bed
tumbles. I discovered that, like other folk, each one has it's
own particular side of the bed, the male ungallantly electing to
sleep next the " wall." If, by any mischance, the lady gets (or,
rather, got--for she is too wise to do so now) on to the sloping
perch before the gentleman, or if I, unwittingly, placed her on
the inner side, as they sidled along, little by little as the darkness
increased, she would eventually find herself in her lord and
master's place next the wall, and, sooner or later, would assuredly
be landed on the floor. The exact modus operandi I never
discovered, for, although much the stronger bird, the pushing of
the male would only push her against the side of the cage. I
can only suppose that, in his dreams, he squeezed more and
more against her until she was in some way squeezed off the
perch. Let us hope that it was nothing worse than this !

FEATHERS CHANGING COLOUR.

By Arthur G. Butter, Pli.D.
An American ornithologist has positively asserted that
when a feather ceases to grow it becomes to all intents and
purposes dead, having no vital connection with the body upon
which it has grown. If this were the case it would be impossible
for the plumage of birds to change excepting by a complete
moult either of the whole of the feathers or of the overlapping
portions : it would also be impossible for a healthy bird to show
greater brilliance of colouring than an unhealthy one, or a dead
bird to lose its vivid tints within a few days; or, if protected
from the light, within many years of its decease.
Every man who has kept birds in any numbers, is well
aware that a healthy bird is not only more glossy in plumage
(perhaps partly owing to the healthy condition of the oil-gland),
but is more vivid in colouring than a sickly one ; but lest this be
doubted, I will go one step farther, and say that everyone who
has kept birds, and after their death has had them prepared as
dried skins, will admit that, even though preserved in the dark, the

colouring rapidly loses its brilliancy, and in some cases entirely
changes in character: so that descriptions prepared by a
scientific ornithologist from skins alone, may be incorrect when
compared with living specimens.
If you look at the description of the Red-headed Gouldian-
finch (Poephila mirabilis ) in the British Museum Catalogue, you
will find it described as very pale grass-green, the belt across the
breast beautiful lilac, and the lower body below golden yellow.
In the living bird the colouring is brilliant vivid green, with the
breast bluish violet or ' pansy blue,' and the abdomen saffron
yellow. The change begins to take place soon after death,
proving conclusively that the feathers are fed by the juices of
the body.
In some birds the pigment of certain feathers is soluble in
water. I am told that this is the case with the Touracous, which
when bathing stain the water, and greatly reduce the brilliancy
of their colouring; but that subsequently the feathers again
assume their vivid hues. If this is true, it can only be explained
by the fact that the feathers are still acted upon by the body, and
are living.
It has been widely and unhesitatingly asserted of
many birds, that they moult twice in the year ; and of others,
that the spring moult is a partial one, consisting in a shedding of
the terminal fringes of the feathers, so as to expose the brighter
colouring overlapped by them : the late Henry Seebohm was
much devoted to the latter explanation of those changes from
winter to summer plumage which are observable in many birds.
In some cases undoubtedly the change is effected as
described: it is certainly so in the House-Sparrow, and probably
in the Brambling ; but an examination of a Redstart, which died
in the middle of the spring change, conclusively proved that the
fringes were not shed, but changed their colour ; no broken
fringes existed in this specimen, but the tips of many ot the
feathers were particoloured.
Seebohm speaks of the Wagtails as having both an
autumn and spring moult. I kept the Pied Wagtail for about
three years in a cage, and can positively assert that it only
moulted in the autumn; I purposely kept both the Grey and
Yellow Wagtails in cages, in order to watch the change to the
spring plumage, and in neither case was a feather shed ; the
colouring grew, day by day, in the feather&amp;apos;s themselves.
Speaking of foreign birds; if all the changes which take
place, say in the common Amaduvade Waxbill (commonly called

Avadavat) were due to a moult: the unfortunate bird would be
perpetually moulting throughout the live-long year; but if this
vverethecase I should be continually tormented with letters asking
at what season this Waxbill ought to moult, and informing me
that its cage was always in a litter from perpetual loss of
feathers ($).
A careful study, day by day, of a good series of Weavers,
for a succession of years ; and an examination of the skins of
those which died during the change ; proved conclusively that
the assumption of the summer plumage was only partly effected
by moult; all the short feathers which had to be replaced by
ornamental crests, ruffs, tail-coverts, or flank-plumes, were
moulted out, but the feathers of the back, breast and abdomen
simply altered their colouring. I y ast year I showed Dr. Sharpe
an example in which some of these feathers were particoloured,
others (manifestly of the winter plumage) were washed with
orange, others again were fringed with orange.
One autumn I purchased about two dozen Weavers,
freshly imported, and several of them coining into colour: the
colouring continued to increase steadily until the cold ot
approaching winter began to be felt: then, to my surprise, the
colouring as gradually receded from the feathers leaving all my
birds in winter plumage. No moult took place from first to
last, nor was there a moult of the feathers of the back breast and
abdomen, when these same birds assumed their breeding-plumage
in the succeeding summer.
The case of the Indigo-Bunting is still more convincing;
inasmuch as the greatest care failed to satisfy me, that any
feathers were moulted during the assumption of the summer
dress ; whereas, on the other hand, every example of three or
four which died during the change showed feathers in all parts
of the body partly of the winter and partly of the summer
colouring. I gave one of the specimens to the late Sir William
Flower (who had been half persuaded that the colouring of
feathers was permanent) and he was constrained to admit that
the evidence before him was convincing. In the same skin you
may see every gradation from brown to blue, some feathers
showing the faintest wash of the coming colour, others fringed,
others again splashed with blue : no moult would account for
such peculiarities.
( b ). I daresay many who have Goldfinches have noticed that, just after a moult, the
blaze on the face is sometimes golden, but that it deepens to crimson later on.--A. G. B.

For a man sitting before a cabinet of bird-skins, among
which in all probability no spring changes are to be found, to
assert that the colouring of feathers once formed is fixed and
unchangeable, is presumptuous. It may be that we have no
microscope powerful enough to show how the juices of the
bird's body nourish and modify the delicate webbing of a tiny
feather; but "seeing is believing" and "facts are stubborn
things."
The idea (which has been suggested) that the surface of a
feather scales off revealing the different colour below the surface,
is an ingenious one ; but it does not account for the changes due to
sickness or death, it does not explain the increase and subsequent
decrease of colour in my Weavers. A far better explanation would
be to assert that heat produced a chemical change in the colouring
of feathers ; only unhappily, if that were true, we should have
all the skins in our cabinets changing periodically from summer
to winter plumage, and back again ; which would, I think, be
somewhat of a hindrance to scientific study.
When one knows that insects exist so small that they are
barely visible to the naked eye, and yet with every delicate
joint of each limb not only supplied with muscles, tendons but
undoubtedly with blood-vessels, why should it be difficult to
believe that even the finest filaments of a bird's feather may be
equally well nourished? If you pluck a feather from a bird's
wing or tail the root of the shaft is by no means dry and
shrivelled, as it should be in a dead feather ; for what purpose
does moisture remain in the shaft excepting to convey vitality to
the other parts ? Is it conceivable that a dead feather would
retain its secure hold on the skin of a bird for months together?
We know that even our teeth are apt to get loose when the nerve
perishes ; and the latter are far better secured than the feathers
in the skin of a bird ; as anyone who has carelessly handled a
bird, and seen it fly away leaving all its tail feathers in his
grasp, is well aware. Depend upon it, as the hair of our head is
nourished ; as it loses lustre when we are sick ; as trial, distress,
or extreme fear will bleach it; so the feathers of birds are
nourished ; only losing their living connection with the body at
the approach of the moulting-season, when the new feathers are
pushing forward to replace them.

NESTING OF CALIFORNIAN QUAILS.
By Rosie Alderson.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97951712195122" page_id="10104179"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
When a friend of mine, last winter, said to me, 'Would
yon care for a pair of Californian Quails,' I at once said 'Yes,
thank you,' although I knew I had not very much room to spare ;
' Still,' I thought, ' I will find a corner for them somewhere.'
Besides I had an idea that Ouails were purely ground birds, but
in this I made one of many mistakes as you will hear later on.
The little couple duly arrived looking very smart and trim,
especially the cock with his black face sharply lined with white,
and curved crest on the top of his head. I put the new arrivals
into an aviary with a pair of Australian Crested Doves, who
were starting to nest. To my surprise the Quails, instead of
keeping to the ground, began to fly into the branches, and so
disturbed the Doves, that after a time I had to remove them, as
it was evident that the Doves would do no good whilst they were
there. So I took the Quails out, and put them with my small
finches in the heated aviary, but found I had only gone from bad
to worse. The Quails, as before, flew right up into the branches,
and instantly the whole aviary was in confusion. I hoped that
they would soon settle down, but next day, seeing the little birds
were still very frightened, I took the Quails away, feeling rather
unhappy. Why the other birds should be so terrified I don't
know, for they did not object to large Doves amongst them, but
certain it is the Quails had only to move and the greatest excite-
ment prevailed amongst the other birds. Finally I put the
Quails in my large dove's aviary. Here they were very happy ; the
little cock was often heard to crow, and the couple spent most of
their time sitting high up amongst the fir branches that were
wired to the walls. I put them a heap of earth in the shelter,
but though a hole was scratched, and sundry eggs laid away from
the nest, the birds never set to work seriously.
About the middle of June I put the Quails in a duck-house
that was fortunately empty just then. It is between 7ft. and Sft.
long, ft. wide and 2ift. high. About 2^-ft. is boarded off at one
end as a shelter; the rest is wired in front, with a door at the
further end of the front. The roof is of wood, and lifts up
in two parts. I took the door in the front off its hinges, and
fixed in front of the house a run the same length as the house
and 4ft. wide, covered with i-inch wire netting. Some sods
of grass were put in the inner shelter, and here the hen Quail
soon scratched a hollow, and lined it with a few feathers. By
June 25th, she had laid four eggs, and three days later there

were seven. About five eggs had been broken before the
Quails were put into the duck-house, so I thought nearly the
full sitting must have been laid. I had read it was best to
put your eggs under a broody Bantam, so I got a lieu and
gave her ten eggs. She was a very good mother, and sat
well. Most of the eggs hatched, but I only reared five of the
young ones. Meanwhile the hen Ouail still went on laying, and
showed no desire to sit. I got a second Bantam, and put nine
eggs under her; from these I reared four young birds. The
hen Quail laid fifteen more eggs and then she began to sit herself
very steadily.

Now here I did a very foolish thing. A friend offered me
yet another broody Bantam, and I thought as the Quail could
not cover all her eggs, I would wait until she went off to feed,
and then take some of them away. But my greediness was very
properly punished. I watched my opportunity and took away
some of the eggs, but tliehen Quail on her return to the nest refused
to sit on the remaining eggs left to her, and to complete the mis-
fortune the Bantam turned out not to be broody at all, and
utterly declined to sit, but marched about the aviary in a most
absurd fashion. I hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry, it all
seemed so foolish; however I sent the Bantam back to her

mistress and put back all the eggs into the Quail's nest. The
eggs had been sat on two or three days and were quite cold, and
I concluded wasted, but I thought if I could only induce the
Quail to recommence sitting it would at least give her a rest. I
drove her back into the shelter where the nest was, though with
very faint hopes that she would settle down. For about twenty
minutes I guarded the entrance hole, and sent her back every
time she tried to come out; finally she made up her mind to stay,
and from that time sat steadily until the young were hatched. I
now realised at what cross purposes we had been playing. The
poor Quail lieu had gone on laying egg after egg trying to make
up the certain quantity of eggs that she considered the right
number to sit on, and I had been taking the eggs away, quite
convinced that as she seemed to show no inclination to sit, it
was just wasting the eggs to leave them with her.
Of these 15 eggs under the Quail ten hatched, and I reared
five birds, all of them cocks. They were not so strong as those
brought up under the Bantams in consequence of being later
hatched. Three grew into healthy, handsome birds, but the
other two were very delicate, and I had to bring them later into
the heated aviary. One, I think, will never be strong, but it is a
very bright little bird ; the other is improving very much. When
first I brought it in from outside it had one foot with the toes
quite curled up, and it hobbled about on the stump in a very
miserable way. I had serious thoughts of binding each toe up
in a starch bandage to try and straighten them, but I think the
lameness must have been chiefly owing to weakness, for now the
bird is stronger the foot has got quite strong and straight.
Young Quails soon seem to get tlieir feet dirty if they have not
a large space to run in and probably this was what first started
the mischief.
The young Quails were brought up on Mr. Arthur's food
mixed with dry crushed biscuit and preserved yolk of egg. The
two earlier broods also got a quantity of small house beetles (the
larger ones they could not manage) and many hundreds of ear-
wigs. These latter I caught in inverted flower pots half filled
with crumpled paper, and placed on the dahlia stakes.
It was a pretty sight to see either of the Bantams kill an
earwig and then call the young Quails to come and eat it. The
little things would come running up chirping shrilly. They
were very fond of their devoted foster mothers, and always
followed them about.
The young Quails were sweet little things during the first

week or two of their lives; later, when they began to get their
quills, they were not so pretty. When first hatched they were
like downy balls of tawny plush with dark markings down their
heads and backs, and very bright dark eyes. They were very
adtive and very mischievous. Soon after they were hatched ten
of them determined to make an excursion to see the world, and
with a little struggling got through the #-inch wire netting round
their run. When it was found they had escaped a hunt took place,
and it took two hours to collect them all and put them safely
back. After this I fastened boards up all round the run, and so
stopped their exploring. Several young ones I lost through
drowning, for they persisted in getting into the water-pot, and
another time I should always use one of Mr. Jones' patent
fountains with which there would be no fear of accidents. Some
of the other young ones died from exhaustion. At first I
allowed the grass in the run to grow long, thinking it would be
a nice shade from the sun, but finally I had it cut short, for the
chicks were always getting either lost or entangled in it, and
were picked up almost dead and quite unable to get back to
their mother. You may imagine how very wee the little creatures
were when I tell you that I brought three little ones into the house
to be revived all in the palm of one hand (and my hand is only a
small one as I know to my cost when trying to hold a large
bird). I held the three chicks to the fire, and gave them weak
brandy and water ; soon they could hold up their little heads and
open their eyes again, and finally tried to make themselves
comfortable by nestling up my sleeve. It is wonderful how
easily a young Quail collapses, and yet if found even just alive it
will soon revive with care and warmth.
The brood brought up by the Quails themselves were
brooded (out in the wire run) almost entirely by the old cock.
The poor fellow used to seem perfectly ashamed of himself if
caught in the act and always looked as if he wished I would
look another way. He would sit with his feathers fluffed out,
and first a tiny head would peep out under one of his wings, and
then another from somewhere else. The hen would sit beside
her husband, but chiefly to see that he did his duty properly.
She rarely ever brooded the young ones herself. It was on June
the 12th that I put the eggs under the first Bantam, and by
September 20th they were entirely independent of her. Their
crests had begun to show some time before, and now began
to curl and divide. They varied very much in shape; in
some the crests curled forward, in others backward, in each case
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998759" page_id="10104183"  page_num="140" year="" vol="">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997082" page_id="10104183"  page_num="140" year="" vol="">
shaped like one feather. In another the crest was divided into
three or four separate wavy plumes. Soon it was quite easy to
tell the cocks from the hens by their colouring. As the young
ones got older I began to give them seed--canary and millet--as
well as soft food. They were very fond of green food, lettuce,
watercress and rape seedlings, or a sod of fresh grass. Quails
delight in a mound of dry earth or sand to take a dust bath in.
I do not think these birds at all delicate after the first stages are
passed. I did not lose one that had got over the first few weeks
of its life.
My old hen seemed none the worse for having laid so
many eggs, she was always well and adtive. She must have laid
at least fifty eggs altogether, for some mouths afterwards we
found nine aggs in the Dove house, where she was first put in
the early part of the year. This clutch was laid in a wicker
nest basket very high up amongst the fir branches. I quite think
that Quails are not entirely ground birds if they have the chance
of getting in trees. All the nine young ones of the first two
broods used to spend most of their time sitting in the highest
fir boughs in the aviary.
The eggs are shaped like a Partridge's and are rather large
for the size of the bird.
Of the fourteen Quails I bred, nine were cocks and five
hens. This year I hope to do better and avoid making so many
errors; truly in bird keeping (as in many other things) one
chiefly learns by sad experience; there is this consolation, the
lesson is generally well learnt.
[Since writing the above my hen quail has laid her first egg
on April 8th. I forgot to mention, it is as well to have a small
door made in the front of the wire run, so that if a chick is
exhausted in the run it can be taken out without trouble. Also
it is a good plan to have a small pane of glass let into the roof
of the inner shelter so that the sitting hen may be observed
without disturbing her.--R. A.]

and Gcopelia by drooping its wings, because if it did so its chief
beauty, the larger wing coverts, would be concealed, so to avoid
this, it raises its wings until the coverts almost join, making a
band of colour behind the head. Now my bird certainly does
not do this, but trails its wings on the ground as it bows, giving
a brilliant display of the colours. Individual birds differ very
much in their ways and I have found this to apply to the Doves,
even more than other birds.
My Ring-necked Parrakeets have eggs already, the first
being laid on March 9th. The cock bird spends a considerable
part of his time in the barrel with the hen. Rather a change for
him, because if he had gone inside a month ago, she would have
done her best to kill him there. It is wonderful how savage that
old hen Ring-neck is. This spring she burrowed into the next
aviary, making a hole like a rat, and set upon her last year's
young bird, biting a large piece out of its cheek and cutting two
of its toes off. It lost a considerable quantity of blood but I
think it will pull through all right now.
During the very severe February frost I was afraid the
Corncrake would get his toes frost-bitten, as he persisted in
standing on the ice on the large water-dish for hours together,
and upon my breaking it he would have a bath with great enjoy-
ment. His feathers used to freeze stiff afterwards, but this never
seemed to do him any harm.
It seems to me that the food supply has more to do with
the migration of this bird than the severity of the weather, as he
seems to be much happier in an outdoor aviary than indoors.
The Corncrake's feathers are very greasy. I examined
one that had been shot and found the grease could be scraped up
like butter. I fancy this must protect it when running through
the long wet grass.
I have read that kitchens are very unsuitable rooms to
keep birds in, but my experience shows that such places are
quite the reverse. The one I am writing of is very dark and
faces North, but still the birds seem to do very well in it. My
Redstart, for instance, came into song in November, has become
finger-tame, and looks as if the place suited him admirably. Of
course this is only to winter certain birds, for I object strongly
to keeping birds in cages as a rule. I think they should be in
outdoor aviaries as far as possible.
It is very interesting to watch the birds bathing. The
Crake stands in the water and jerks up and down just like a

duck washing, and indeed most of the wading birds wash in this
way, the Reeve being the only one I have seen flapping its wings
to wet itself.
I had a very large pan in the aviary which only the Red-
crested Cardinals would use. Thej^ used to look very funny
standing in the dish with only their heads above water, but they
never seemed to be at all alarmed. The Brown-throated Conures,
Rosellas and other Parrakeets simply walk through the water
about ten or twelve times, before they fly up to dry themselves.
I wish Parrots were not so destructive to plants and trees
for they are extremely nice birds. A very large Alexandrine I
used to let out in the garden would cut through stout branches
as easily as one could break a match. He also did his best to
destroy an aviary, so I was reluctantly compelled to part with
him, although he was the tamest and most affectionate bird I
have ever had.
[The fadt of birds existing through the winter in a kitchen without
apparently suffering any ill effects, is no proof that such a place is well-
suited for keeping them in.-- Ed.]

[The following interesting account of a " Bird-lover's home," near
Adelaide, which was recently visited by members of the Australasian
Ornithologists' Union, is taken from the Australasian of December 14th,
1901, and has been kindly sent to us by Mr. John Sergeant.--E d.]
" Those privileged to stay there woke in the morning to the song of
native Thrush and chatter of Brush Wattle Bird, and standing 011 the
balcony could see, amongst a wealth of roses and imported flowers, what
are usually regarded as denizens of the bush in search of breakfast or
preparing for a coming brood. Upon one path a little Blue Wren--polj&amp;apos;-
gamist of the first rank--led a troop of four less showily attired, but
equally perky wives, and selfishly repelled them when some delicacy was
found; female rights, on that occasion, being evidently absent from his creed.
Where scarlet bottle brushes swayed, the New South Wales Honey-eater--a
pretty creature in black and white and yellow garb--clung closely to their
branches, and probed the blossoms for the nectar there. A leaden-coloured
one was on Teconia blooms ; a third species, the " greeny" of one's boyhood
days, investigated the opening flowers of the silky oak. The singing
variety was never far away, its double notes coming at intervals from
melaleuca boughs that overhung a portion of the drive. Whilst one
watched, a Black and White Fautail, whose voicings had been heard
throughout the night, lit near one's feet, seized some (to us) invisible prey,
passed to verandah post, and plucked a cobweb there, then went nest-
building in a ficus tree. Another glance showed Crested Doves at large,
whilst White-backed Magpies' notes and chuckle of the large Kingfisher
proved the presence of those birds. The "voice of the Turtle" was

\0x25A0constant in the land. This was the keynote to what later day revealed.
Birds constantly reminded one that they were about. The place had manv
feathered denizens, whom experience had taught that they hail nothing to
fear, and that their presence was most welcome. Some of the species were
*elsewhere in the district regarded as extinct.
" Upon several trees were fastened sections of a hollow log, a bunch of
grass, or other provision made for hidden nest. The tiny Martins which
are usually found nesting in hollow trees in the bush were here in hundreds,
*dwelling happily in suspended bamboo stems, in the sides of which holes
had been cut, so that each section of the jointed stem was usable for
breeding purposes. Every available nook or ledge was occupied by them
too--even a large funnel suspended on a shed wall had been utilised. It
was a pretty sight when the funnel was gently taken down to see the little
lien bird remaining on her clutch of eggs and looking at her visitors as if
wondering what this disturbance of her home could mean. An old watering-
can, some six feet from the ground, had been made use of in a similar
way, but here the female had not completed her tale of eggs, and resented
being gazed upon, preferring rather to watch our actions from a few yards
away. The nest took up a large portion of the can, and had been made of
gum leaves and some grass, that in the funnel being principally of the
same materials. How rapidly Tree Martins find a new nesting-place was
shown when, a few days before our visit, some pierced bamboos were
suspended in a new piggery, close under the roof. Not many hours
elapsed ere each hole had its occupants, who were now bringing mud
pellets for their architectural purposes. A Shrike Tit, whose nest is usually
not easily found, had made a home above the kitchen roof.
" The farm still bears some of the natural vegetation of a damp place.
Along the creek a thick fringe of timber flourishes -- tea, gum, and
other native trees--and where some large aviaries are built the reeds grow
thickly enough to afford shelter to the Bronze-wing Pigeon, who, with head
laid sideways on the edge of the nest, permitted inspection of its home.
(The male bird was sitting at the time.) They grow also where two Cape
Barren Geese marched proudly at the head of a brood of goslings, the male
bird quacking and his mate replying with porcine grunt.
"No shooting is allowed in this bird refuge; all living creatures
excepting rats, mice, and sparrows, are encouraged there. In a con-
servatory lay basking a fine brown snake (a Denisouia of lighter hue than
the species usually seen near Melbourne) ; a smaller one was where some
Pheasants had a home, and seemed quite undisturbed when one pugnacious
bird, endeavouring to fight with an annoying Bald Coot, his next door
neighbour, through the netting trod close beside its head. The snakes
keep down the mice and such " small deer," who otherwise would overrun
the place, and hence are looked upon as friends.
" A pair of stately Black Swans reared two fine cygnets during the
last season, their offsping now being as large as themselves, and all roamed
at liberty about the yards or plunged into a tank with evident enjoyment.
To enumerate every native bird which still clings to the spot would need
much patient watchfulness--new seasons bring new kinds, and weeks
would be necessary to find out all that now are there. Amongst those
heard of, but not seen, were visitors from the interior of our continent,
who usually find haven here when drought-driven from their inland

haunts. Their coming is delayed this spring, no doubt on account of the
more favourable season in the north. The tameness of all the birds that
were seen was very noticeable.
"For those birds which would stray away large aviaries, with many
sub-divisions, have been erected, and it takes some hours each morning to
attend to the w&amp;apos;ants of their occupants. Parrot and Finch, Wonga Wonga
Pigeon and Peaceful Dove, Wood Duck and Eagle, a pretty Kestrel, and a
covey of Brown Quail, all welcome eagerly the hand that feeds. Many of
them come closely to the netting when any one appears.

" The Shell Parrots suggested peace in all their ways. Their nests
were in some hollow limbs, and a little head would now and then emerge
from a knothole to look around. When the hen came off one nest, the
male bird drove her back again ; but the majority were " kissing " or
whispering sweetly to each other. Barraband and Port Lincoln, " 28" and
Cockatoo, Rosella and Betcherrygali were amongst the Parrots and
Parrakeets kept ; of larger kinds the White, Long-billed, Rose-breasted, and
other of the Cockatoo clan were there. In another portion of the aviary, a
little Tribonyx (or native hen) was laying. She had Maned Geese as her
near neighbours, some Assam Pheasants, and a young Muscovy Duck, which
had deserted its kin, bearing the latter company. The Queensland Green
Pigeon cooed, and seemed thoroughly at home. How many birds are in
captivity is hard to discover, since the bushes and reeds are not easily seen
through. One secret of success in keeping all these birds is that they have
abundance of room, and that natural surroundings are provided as far as
practicable ; another is that those wdio keep them love the task of caring for
them, and would as soon think of neglecting their own kin as not supply-
ing the wants of the birds."
BIRD NOTES.
Mr. J. H. Gurney contributes his annual Ornithological Notes from
Norfolk and the north of Suffolk, to the March number of the Zoologist.
Among the rarities noted during the year (1901) are the following : Lesser
White-fronted Goose in January; Golden Oriole, White-winged Terns,
Goshawk, and Orange-legged Hobby in April; Woodchat Shrike in June ;
Caspian Tern and Avocet in July; Blue-throat and Roller in September;.
Sabine's Gull and Teugmalm's Owl in October; and Allen's Gallinule in
December.
A specimen of the Yellow-eyed Babbler (Pyctorhys sinensis), which
species was ably described in our last number by Mr. E. W. Harper, has
recently been deposited at the Zoological Gardens by the Honble. W.
Rothschild. It is the first example received by the Society since 1S6S,
and is well worth inspection. It occupies a spacious cage in the Insect
House.
On March 28th last the Zoological Society received a consignment of
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.982417125" page_id="10104188"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
ten valuable Indian birds, presented by Mr. Harper, all of which are new
to the collection.
Our space will not permit of our giving more than a bare list of the
species: Brown-headed Stork-billed Kingfisher (Pelargopsis gurial) ; Eastern
Calandra Lark (Melanacorypha binuiculata) ; Eastern Linnet (Acanthi&amp;apos;s fringilli-
rostris) ; Pale Rose-finch (Rhodospiz i obsolete) ; Glossy Calornis ( Calornis
chalybeius) ; Small-billed Mountain Thrush (Oreoctncla dawna) ; Large Pied
Wagtail [Motacilla made ra\pa tens is) ; Ashy Wood-Swallow (Artamns fuscus );
Bay-backed Shrike ( Lanins v it tat its) ; Indian Great Reed-Warbler ( Acioce -
phalus stentoreus).
All who are interested in the migration of birds should carefully
study Mr. W. Eagle Clark's paper entitled "A Month on the Eddystone,"
which appears in the April number of the Ibis. By residing with the light-
house keepers, cut off from the world for a whole mouth, Mr. Clark was
able to make observations of the highest importance in the study of this
remarkable phenomenon.
The cleverness of the Grey Parrot is well known, but we think that
specimen below described must almost beat the record. The following is a
cutting from Nature of December 12i.l1, 1901 : --
" My daughter had a very clever young Grey Parrot, which,
unfortunately, died on the first of this month, after a severe illness of three
weeks' duration. He was brought to my daughter straight from the nest in
Africa, and had he lived another month would have been about two years
old. He was a singularly clever bird, and of a charming disposition to his
friends, though very shy and inclined to be hostile to strangers. He was
an exceptionally good talker for his age and showed remarkable intelligence
in fitting his savings to the occasion. He was very fond both of fruit
and sugar, but I never knew him ask for sugar at dinner or apple at
breakfast. For nuts, which were kept in a cupboard in the room, he would
ask at any time; and in many similar ways he showed a vivid association
between the words and the things represented by them.
" But the remarkable, and to me novel, power which he displayed at
so young an age was that of acting. He played with a bit of wood exactly
as a clever little girl plays with her doll. For example, he would take the
wood in his claw and would say to it, imitating the voice and gestures of
my daughter or of one of the servants, ' What ! are you going to bite me?
How dare you ? I will take the stick to you ! ' Then he would shake his
head at the wood and say, ' I am ashamed of you ! Whom did you bite?
Go on your perch ! ' Then he would take the wood to the bottom of his
cage, and putting it down on the floor would hit it with his claw several
times, saying, 'Naughty! I'll cover you up, I will!' Then he would
step back from it one or two paces, put his head on one side and say, as he
looked at it, ' Are you good now ? '
" No attempt was ever made, deliberately, to teach him this or any
other of his histrionic performances. He picked them up spontaneously
from his own observation and memory.
" It would interest me much to know whether this capacity for
acting is often found in Grey Parrots.

GOULDIAN FINCHES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983784069767442" page_id="10104189"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- Perhaps Air. A. K. Booth royd may be interested to hear my
experience with Gouldians, or, as they are called in their native Queensland,
"Painted Finches."
I had two of these beautiful birds given me in September or October
(I forget which month) of 1899. I placed them in a large cage, 3 feet long,
3 feet high, all wire, small mesh, and settled them in the warmest corner of
my birdroom. I11 November of the same year, while I was away from
home, one of the birds was found disabled and was put in a little cage to be
nursed, but it died during the night. It was sent to a naturalist to be
examined, and was found to be perfectly healthy in every respect, but its
leg had been broken, and it probably died from shock. I believe both birds
must have been cocks, and they probabl}- fought -- both birds had the long
pin-feather in the tail. I do not know if the cocks of this species are
usually quarrelsome.
I put a pair of little Indian Silverbills in the cage to keep the
surviving Painted Beauty company, and they have always agreed perfectly.
One unfortunately died lately, but the remaining one and a tiny Avadavat
live with the Gouldian in perfect friendship.
I supply them daily with a liberal quantity of small Indian millet,
white millet, and millet in the ear. I add a small pan of canary seed, but
as this never decreases I conclude none of the birds in the cage care for it.
The Gouldian lives almost entirely on the Indian seed and that in the ear,
but I have seen him partaking of the white millet. I sometimes scatter a
little common grass seed on the sand, and it disappears. I also occasionally
put in a little bit of sponge cake or preserved yolk, but I do not know it
the Gouldian eats any of these delicacies. I use sea sand and give cuttle
bone; also plenty of freshwater, one pan large enough for the birds to
bathe. I must add that my bird seems perfectly happy without a mate, aud
sings his bubbling song constantly.
The temperature of my room is never over 55 deg. in Winter, and
very often lower : the glass went down to 32 deg. on two nights during the
cold weather of last month, but the Painted bird seemed in no way to
suffer or to be the worse for it. I am told by a friend, who has lived for
many years in N. Australia, and kept them there, that these birds can stand
frost much better than damp, and sometimes get it in their native laud --
although it seems strange to think of frost in the tropics. I cover the
back and one side of the cage to protect him from any possible draught
when the window is opened in the birdroom.
I must not boast of my bird, but he really is a beauty: seems healthy
and strong, and is in most magnificent plumage. The blending of colours
in this species is truly marvellous, and I believe impossible to exactly re-
produce on paper, although Mr. Frohawk's picture in Dr. Butler's useful
book on "Foreign Finches" is remarkably lifelike. EM1 L,Y WEST.

BLACKCAPS, ETC.
Sir, -- I see from some of your past issues that one of our members --
Mr. Rotliera (*) -- kept his Golden Pheasants with Quails -- Californian and
Chinese -- and many other small aviary birds. Would this be practicable in
a well-planted aviary fifty-seven feet long and about six feet wide ? Would
there be any danger of the Pheasants killing birds smaller than themselves?
Are there any instances of the successful wintering out-of-doors of
Blackcaps, Redstarts, and Gouldians ? G. C. PORTER.
7 he following reply w&amp;lt;is sent to Mr. Porter :
I have not tried the experiment of keeping Golden Pheasants and
Quails together, and therefore cannot speak with certainty. I am inclined
to think that in an aviary of the size you describe it would be safe. Cock
Golden Pheasants vary immensely in disposition. I have had most harm-
less cocks which never touched any other Pheasant. I have had at least
one which, in the nesting season, has scalped and even killed his own hens,
and other Pheasants left with him, but not in so large an aviary as yours;
and since I have constructed my large Pheasantries, with hedges and shrubs
and small trees in them, such disasters have almost entirely ceased.
O. E. Cress we ee.
I have been told of a Blackcap having been successfully wintered
out-of-doors. Personally, I should be exceedingly sorry to put a Blackcap
to so severe a trial, through which it could scarcely pass unscathed, even in
an exceptionally well-sheltered aviary. Moreover, some of the Blackcaps
in confinement in this country come from the continent, and seem to be
decidedly less robust than our own summer migrants.
Redstarts and Gouldians are delicate as regards temperature, and to
attempt to keep them out of doors through an English winter would, in
my opinion, be an act of cruelty. -- R. P.

Sir, --Would yon kindly give me advice as to the treatment of my
Pennant Parrakeet ? I have had him over a year, and when purchased he
was in brilliant plumage. Last August he began to moult, lost all liis
bright colour, and still continues very shabby -- not like the same bird. He
came from an outdoor aviary, and had been fed on oats, hemp, and canary-
seed. I have given the same, with the addition of a little " Hyde's Parrot
Food." The bird seems in perfect health, eyes bright, and very active;
bathes two or three times a week. He has plenty of wood to bite up, and
a bit of rock salt in his cage. lie lives with a Yellow-rumped Parrakeet,
and is always lively and bright; but his plumage is very shabby. I don't
know what to give him in the moult. M. HamieTON.

The following reply was sent to Mrs. Hamilton :
Your letter has been forwarded to me, but I am afraid I cannot help.
I can suggest no improvement in the food : you can add millet if yon like.
It is one of those cases where, the cause of the mischief being unknown,
one can suggest no remedy.
I have known the same thing happen to aviary-bred birds : the first
plumage was quite sound, but a sort of French moult came on in the
second year. I presume the bird has been kept out of doors and without
artificial heat.
You can try a few drops of Parrish's Food in the water, but I do not
expect any amendment. If one could administer sulphur, it might do
some good (c). F. G. Dutton.

THE CALIFORNIAN OUAIL-
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999182583333333" page_id="10104191"  page_num="148" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Referring to Miss Aldersou&amp;apos;s interesting article on page 136, all
the Old World Quails, so far as I am acquainted with them, are true ground
birds; but the American Quails belong to a different sub-family. In the
wild state, the Californian Quail {Lophortyx califomicus) does not seem to
perch very much on trees, but in an aviary a good specimen invariably takes
freely to the perches: and a beautiful addition it is to a large mixed aviary,
from which, however, it has usually to be summarily expelled on account
of its quarrelsome nature. On one occasion, to mate with an odd female, I
obtained a fully adult aviary-bred male which had been reared in a " run,"
and never saw a perch until it reached my hands. This bird kept almost
entirely to the ground, and for weeks did not attempt to follow the female
to the perches, and never took kindly to them.
Not onl) ? in the aviary, but also in the wild state does this species
occasionally nest in trees. I suspect that, as with Ducks, this exceptional
site is resorted to only when the bird is not satisfied with the privacy or
safety of the quarters provided for it on the ground, or (in the wild
\0x25A0state) has been alarmed or had its nest destroyed by some ground creature.
The average number of eggs laid by the wild bird is about fourteen ;
occasionally the number found in a nest is much greater, presumably
produced by two birds.
As a rule, the female broods the young; but, if she should go to nest
a second time, which is probably the exception rather than the rule, it is
her custom to hand the first batch over to the care of her mate while she
sits on the second clutch of eggs. Reginald Phiixipps.

NOTES ON SHAMAS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9920841875" page_id="10104192"  page_num="149" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- Many of our members will, no doubt, be able to confirm my
opinion that the Sliama is the songster par excellence amongst foreign birds.
Those who have heard one can imagine the grand variety concert, given by
an assembly of some twenty of these birds at the same time, each singing as
only a Sliama, in A. i form can. It has been my good fortune lately to hear
such a concourse.
The tame and docile manner of these birds, when once accustomed
to their owners, makes them loveable pets, but at the same time they have
plenty of spirit and are well able to hold their own if put on their dignity.
A Sliama can give expression to it's movements by it's tail, as no other
bird can. He is always on the alert for a mealworm, and will fly out of
his cage for one instantly the door is opened. As these birds are so tame,
they require little teaching before they may be allowed to fly loose, and
they will very soon go in and out at will.
Being so bold it is no wonder that the}' should be used for fighting by
the Indians ; and they are pitted against one another in large cages, where
they fight until one is killed ; as in the old cock fights indulged in by our
forefathers. So pugnacious are the cocks that they will not allow a hen of
their own species to be caged with them, and I would never advise anyone
to put two Shauias together in a limited space.
The hens are much more sombre in colour than their mates and the}&amp;apos;
sing a little, but the song is more disjointed than, and not so free and
voluminous, as that of the cock.
When Shauias are young it is difficult to distinguish 'between the
sexes, but after the moult the difference is very evident.
It is very amusing to see two or three Shauias on the aviary floor,
while the cages are being cleaned out, having a go at one another, with tails
erect and singing at full concert pitch. I have spent many a pleasant hour
lately listening to my Shamas singing. I have heard them at three o'clock
in the morning, and at midnight, or until the light has been put out.
Shamas are very little trouble to feed ; they like a bath very much,
and keep themselves beautifully clean. W. Osbaudeston.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gili., M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case.
If a reply by post (in addition to any Report that may appear in the Magazine) be required,
a stamped and addressed envelope must likewise be sent.
Avadavat. (The Hoiible. Lilia de Yarburgh Bateson). Found dead - t
apparently quite well tin hour before.
[Death was caused by concussion of the brain].
Gouldian Finch. (Mr. H. E. Goddard). In owner's possession only ten
days, ailing more or less all the time. Fed on millet (white and spray)
and canary-seed.
[Pneumonia was the cause of death].
Gouldian Finch. (Mrs. Gorter). Had been treated for egg-binding, and
apparently revived : ate heartily and seemed all right up to io p.m., but
died at night.
[There we,re no symptoms of egg-binding, but the lungs were much
inflamed, which was the immediate cause of death].
Dead Bird. (Mr. Rotliera).
[Was so decomposed on receipt, that a satisfactory examination
was not possible]. _
Two Double-banded-, and two Masked-Finches. (Mr. Hayward W.
Mathias). Owner had had one Double-banded-, and one Masked-Finch
in unheated outdoor aviary all winter. Mates were obtained, in
apparently good health. Each pair was put in a separate cage, and
cages put in a greenhouse with an average temperature of 55 deg. Fall,
at night, and day temperature not exceeding 80 deg. Fall. Fed on
millet- and canary-seed. Had no bath. Atmosphere dry.
[Cause of death was enteritis, and the loss of all four suggests a
contagious form of disease. But all the birds were subjected to
extremes of temperature, and a variation of some 25 deg. between day
and night temperature is excessive and prejudicial. The drinking-
water would have a similar variation in temperature which would, in
all probability, cause the symptoms named. The change from your
cold aviary, and the hot shop, would be equally trying for the original
birds and the new arrivals]. _
Yellow Budgerigar. (Mr. C. Dell). Purchased on March 15th, appar-
ently in good health : seemed dull on the 18th, and died on the 20th.
[Death resulted from concussion of the brain caused by injury. It
was a hen]. _
Cordon Br.EU. (The Honble. Mary Hawke). Died day after purchase.

THE AUGUST AMAZON.
(Chrysotis augustaj.
By the Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton.
This Parrot is the largest of the Amazons. The illustra-
tion, taken from Mr. Plerbert Goodcliild's admirable water
colour, renders a description of the colours of the bird
unnecessary. But as it conveys no impression of its relative
size I may as well note the dimensions given in the British
Museum Catalogue: "Total length, 19 inches, wing n, tail 7,
bill 17, tarsus 075."
I should have said Guilding's Amazon was as large, but the
Catalogue gives its length as 17 inches.
These two birds are very much larger than any other
Amazon. Though Versicolor with 167 inches comes near
Guilding's in size.
My bird fell when its companion was shot, and was picked
up quite uninjured. As the companion proved on dissection to be
a male, the presumption is that mine was a female. Some people
think female Parrots are much gentler than male birds. If so,
my bird may help to establish the theory. For though it was
caught adult, it was very tame, and quite willing to be played
with, and soon learned to say several words. It may have been
young when it was obtained, for Mr. Goodchild tells me it has
grown much darker since he painted it, that the skins in the
Natural History Museum are darker, and that one deposited at
the Gardens, but which died soon after its arrival, was darker.
Certainly Mr. Goodehild's drawing was a most faithful repre-
sentation of the bird when I had it.
It is impossible to draw conclusions from one bird, and I
am afraid more are not likely to be soon procured. They are
entirely confined to Dominica, and are not common there. But
I believe a new road was cut in the forests, which revealed that

tliey were not quite so rare as was supposed. Mr. Branch sent
home some dozen skins to Mr. Rothschild. But there seems to
be no means of getting nestlings, therefore the chances of getting
live birds is always doubtful.
It is curious that Guilding's Amazon does not seem to be
a good talker, while a Versicolor which Lady Thompson got, and
which also must have been caught old, grew tame and talked soon
after she acquired it. I found my august a rather noisy, like most
Amazons, but the drawback to them as cage birds is their great
size. They want a cage as large as a Macaw's.
THE EUROPEAN BEE-EATER.
Merops apiastcr.
By Reginald Phillipps.
(Continued from page 132).
What happened during the very bad fogs of the winter
I will not venture to describe. It was only with the greatest
difficulty that I could keep their fragile little bodies and
souls together. Indeed, they continuously oppress me with
the feeling that they may slip through my fingers any day.
Some of our members will ask why I did not feed them a little
by hand during the short winter days. I found that, Cuckoo-like,
if fed on their perches, they would sit side by side clamouring
for food, waiting for me to feed them, but would not come down
to feed themselves ; so that, except when compelled to act other-
wise, it was the greater kindness to leave them alone. But times
without number I was compelled to hand-feed them, usually by
handing the food to them in a white china dish which shewed up
the colour of the cockroaches, but sometimes to the extent of
placing them 011 the carpet in the lightest spot, and even carry-
ing them in my hand right to the window and holding the food
to the tips of their bills ; or doing the same with one hand while I
held a lamp to their faces with the other. I may just mention
that opening the doors of their cage at one time was dangerous
work, as they dashed off against the window, or, at the best, after
a rapid flight round the room, like Mrs. Leslie Williams'
Parrakeet (Vol. VII., p. 227), would quickly alight "without
discrimination and equally without dignity"--on the floor or
anywhere else as luck might have it.
The second difficulty was that I found their eyes were so
focussed that, when pecking at their food, the point of the bill
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999831" page_id="10104198"  page_num="153" year="" vol="">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999801139534884" page_id="10104198"  page_num="153" year="" vol="">
would fall short of it's object by about one-third of an inch. My
theory is that, descended from ancestors who for countless
generations had been in the habit of taking their food while
flying at no inconsiderable pace, they instinctively commenced
the action of closing the bill while the prey was still ahead of
them. In a few weeks' time, however, this difficulty wore itself out
to a certain extent; but it occasionally re-appears when the birds
are nervous or in a bad light. The female, to this day, cannot
seize her food out of a dish except in a very good light; and,
when I hand them a cockroach, they more often than not seize
and endeavour to swallow my finger or thumb.
Not altogether unconnected with this feature (eye-
focussing) is another point, concerning which I should like to
raise a question, and invite the criticism of our scientific
members. Extending backwards from the mouth there runs a
black band right across the eye and terminating in the ear-tufts.
Often as I have looked at the pictures of Bee-eaters, nothing in
connection with this black band has ever struck me, although I
have often wondered why so many species should have a similar
line, or a dark lore spot. But when I am having a little chat
with my Bee-eaters, and they, sitting side by side on a perch as
is their wont, and with but a few inches between us, are looking
me straight in the face, with .he crown flattened and the bill a
trifle raised, the line of the black bill, and the eye, and the black
band seem so closely connected that it is impossible not to feel
that the line, in some way, helps them while pursuing their prey
in the air, or saves their eyes from dazzling reflections. Probably
a brilliant African sun, if allowed to fall on a bright shining
lore, would have dazzled the eye, and might possibly have
affected the sight, or it might have reflected the light so as to
mar the true aim of the bird when in pursuit of it's prey. The
dead-black lores, on the contrary, would not reflect, but rather
absorb, the brilliant rays, and may be something more than an
unspeakable comfort to the birds. Perhaps the birds look down
the black lines when taking aim as through a telescope or along
a gnu barrel! The projecting brows--or rather the deep-set
eyes--afford a further protection to the sight.
The Bee-eaters are verily birds of the sun. Not only do
they require a brilliant light to enable them to take their
ordinary food with comfort, but the Bee-eater in the sun-shine is
a different bird from the Bee-eater in the gloom. On a dull day,
they sit huddled together in a lump, afraid to move, taking their
food in fear and trembling--and an insufficiency of that--and

calling to me in distressful, dejected tones. But when the sun
bursts into their cage, they are alive at once, and as happy as
kings. Then it is that they go down to the ground ot their own
accord, scoop up stray morsels of food, and scramble about in
a manner which adds intense life and interest to Mr. Bayard&amp;apos;s
happy description of this species on the ground, already quoted
(p. 104).
Although so fond of sitting together upon a perch, it must
not be supposed that they are dull and lifeless birds. Their
heads are always 011 the move, their eyes are always on
the look-out, their senses are always on the alert. I never
can catch them napping, either by night or by day. They
can distinguish the sound of my footstep from that of any other
person in the house ; and in the dead of night, when I creep
down with unslippered feet to visit a mouse-box I have in the
dining room, they will detect and whistle to me before I reach
the room, while the mice, now ultra wary, will fail to notice my
presence until my hand is upon the fatal box. With the back of
the head depressed, and the bill slightly raised, not a fly can wink
nor a gnat blink without their noticing the movement, and the neck
and body will become lengthened out to nearly double the length
and a quarter of the circumference of the figures depicted by our
artist in the fogs of October.
I have referred more than once to the voice of this bird.
It may best be described as a warbling whistle, with almost
endless variations. They talk to one another and to me as
plainly as plain can be. And not only have I never heard them
utter a discordant note (I suppose I must except the ' snarl,'
presently to be mentioned) but every note I have heard
has been pleasing, and many of the notes are sweetly musical.
We are told that the call-note of the species is quilp. To this I
do not fully agree. The quilp or quip note is usually a note of
alarm, surprise, or interrogation. I come back from Church, and
peep into their cage with my tall hat 011, and it is quilp. A cat
appears on the window-sill, and it is quilp , or quip-quip repeated
rapidly. The greater the excitement, the more quickly and
sharply is the note brought out, and the more like quip or quick
as distinguished from quilp, sometimes even repeated lour times
or oftener, as rapidly as the notes can be uttered. The ordinary
call-note is Q (Kew), with modifications and variations. My
male has not yet attempted to sing, but, should he ever do so, I
should be surprised if the song were otherwise than musical and

pleasing.* He is much more talkative than the female, and is
the first to commence the conversation or sound the alarm.
For a long time after their arrival, my birds seemed to be
totally unacquainted with the not unusual accomplishment
amongst birds of drinking cold water for the purpose of quench-
ing thirst. Nevertheless the sight and sound of running water
have always more or less excited them. Knowing that some
non-drinking birds obtain a certain amount of moisture by eating
fruit or green-stuff, I offered these to the Bee-eaters, but mostly
with negative results. All ordinary green-stuff has, so far, been
refused, but I have scored a partial success with grapes cut up
into small pieces. For a little while, both more or less accepted
them when offered by hand ; but before long the female refused
them, and has continued to do so ever since. The male, on the
contrary, has regularly taken to them ; they are associated in his
mind with water ; and when I pour water, or even paraffin into
the stoves, they both become excited, the male for grapes, the
female for water. The water dish on the floor of their cage they
never touched, but I have an open glass receptacle suspended
close to one of their favourite perches. With a small house
water-can, I slowly pour the water from a little height
into the glass, emptying the latter and repeating the
operation as often as time and patience will allow. The
female seizes the mouth of the can and endeavours to
swallow it. A certain amount of water gets on to her face,
and then she flutters her feathers after the manner of a bird
washing, and bangs her bill again and again with such violence
that one wonders which will break first, the bill or the perch.
On November 14, for the first time, she touched the water in the
glass with the tip of her bill, as if about to wash, but nothing
came of it. Although she regularly came to the can as
described, once or twice a day, it was not until January 2 that
she sivalloiued a drop of water. O11 February 22, for the second
(*). It was on March 31st, a comparatively warm day, that I first heard the '*song"
of my Bee-eater. He was on a high perch, facing towards his mate, who was a little below
him, and was slowly waving his extended wings, and swaying his body to and fro like a
Scutari Howling Dervish, as he warbled forth liis whistling lay. It was little more than a
varied and sustained rippling whistle, with runs and quavers, and was distinctly pleasing.
It reminded me of a person singinga song with really a good but untrained and uncultivated
voice. When one remembers how often the song of the hand-reared Nightingale is a
failure, one must not be too hard on the first efforts of a bird who has never seen or heard
one of his own kind (save his wife) since the day when, as we suppose, he was taken from
his parents' nest-hole in the banks of the Danube. Regularly since, he has occasionally
broken out with snatches of song as, with waving pinions extending and contracting, he
goes for Mrs. B , and pursues her with open mouth and un-lover-like snarls as she
continuously avoids his clumsy bucolical advances.--R. P.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998225627906977" page_id="10104201"  page_num="156" year="" vol="">
time, she lowered her bill into the glass, and made a show ot
washing ; and on the 24th and following days she really gave her
face and neck a respectable wetting. Nevertheless it was not until
April 3 that I saw her touch the water-glass at any time other
than when I pour in the water.
It was on March 24 that she, for the first time, attempted
to drink out of the glass. She did not know how to drink ; all
she managed to do was to lower her open mouth into the water,
keep it there for a few seconds, and then lift it up to a nearly
horizontal position, and swallow whatever moisture might remain
in her mouth. The more I watch this bird, the more I feel that,
in the wild state, the Bee-eater must scoop up water from the
surface while on the iving. Their fondness for river banks for
breeding in has often been noticed.
More than once the female has been seriously threatened
with fits, which so far I have happily averted by dosing her, by
hand, with fluid magnesia ; but it is a most difficult operation, as
swallowing any fluid seems to be a difficulty. Even when
feeding, they do not swallow without a great deal of fumbling and
dropping of food. Now, 011 the appearance of any bad symptoms,
I dip cockroaches into the magnesia and give them to her as wet
as possible, and for some time continue to dip them in water that
she may have the benefit of the moisture. It is worthy of
notice that the male, who at one time was most seriously ill, has
for a considerable while been in a fairly robust and vigorous
condition--and he obtains moisture in the form of grapes,
eating a limited quantity every day. Whereas the female, who
for so long would never drink, and persistently refuses grapes, is
not nearly so healthy a bird ; but she has improved, I think,
since she has taken more kindly to the water. I conclude that in
their wild state they never drink water, unless on the wing, and
" wash" in the falling rain ; and I suppose they do not partake
of fruit. But they seem to need moisture, and probably, like
Swallows, as already suggested, drink (and perhaps bathe) as
they skim over the surface of the water. The shape of the bill
might seem to militate against this theory ; but, when I observe
how greatly they prefer scooping up their food to picking it up
at the point of the mandible, I feel that it is not at all an
improbable supposition.
For the most part they seem to be remarkably amiable
birds, although, when ruffled by the presence of strangers, or a
strange bird, or when they fancy they may be in danger, like
dogs, they erect the " bristles " along the back of the neck,

<bodyText confidence="0.996534953488372" page_id="10104202"  page_num="157" year="" vol="">
and open their bills in a threatening manner with a not too
musical snarl : but their bark is worse than their bite. These
little failing&amp;apos;s of temper, it seems to me, are often only evidences
of the natural nervousness of a species which has no power to
resist attack. More than once I have tried to keep an odd bird
or two in their cage, but it does not do, for the visitor takes the
best of the food, and the Bee-eaters evince a disinclination to
descend to the food-saucers at all.
Towards the middle of March, the fogs dispersed, and
daylight appeared, and I swung back their cage a little for the
benefit of the room. The male then took it into his head to
sleep with his back to the window; and, on putting them to bed
in the evening, I placed him in his usual place, next to the
" wall." But he would not consent to this ; and I found that,
whatever the circumstances, he must have his wife on his left
side ; and a day or two later when the patient little woman, not
accustomed to the new order of things, inadvertently approached
his right wing, the Tartar threatened her with all kinds of
pains and penalties, and I had to hastily remove her to his left
wing, when he received her with his usual affection.
The great difficulty with birds of a nature like that of the
Bee-eater is the food. My birds had been so " saturated " with
mealworms before I received them that I found it necessary, if
they were to be reared, to practically stop the mealworms
altogether, although they devour them greedily. There is
something about the mealworm which seems to have a like
effect on certain species of birds as drinking, gambling, smoking,
etc., have on some persons--the more it is indulged in the more
the craving impels them to indulge further, no matter how
certainly and surely they are travelling to destruction.
Nothing but total abstinence is of any avail in such a case,
be it human or be it bird. The mealworms had to be stopped ;
and, as cockroaches were very scarce (until much later, when a
kind friend came to the rescue), and as no spiders nor insects
were obtainable, I had to fall back upon meat. Insectivorous
food is placed in their saucers, which is never touched ; but of
cooked meat, carefully scraped, the}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sometimes take a good deal,
occasionally deserting it in favour of egg-flake. As already
stated, they seem to prefer scooping up the food off the ground to
taking it out of the food saucers, and so I regularly scatter the
flake over the bottom of the cage. Raw meat I give very rarely
and very sparingly. An occasional dole of sultanas carefully
cleaned and cut up is usually well received. Cockroaches I

supply as freely as I can obtain them ; these now, whenever I
can spare the time, are regularly dipped in water, to the
benefit, I think of both the birds.* In the country, during
the summer, many other insects might be obtained. Milk sop
would be good for them, but it is so squeezed and banged
about that nothing remains to be swallowed.
In February, it was suggested by our practical Treasurer :--
" Have you tried bees?&amp;quot; Singularly enough, I had never so
much as thought of them in connection with my own birds ; but
having received the idea, I soon obtained the bees, and, on
March i, offered the first supply to my unsophisticated babes.
They, not acquainted with them, and accustomed to gulp down
cockroaches without any preliminaries whenever the)^ could get
them, immediately gulped down some bees--and the female got
stung somewhere inside. How the poor bird--all too late--
banged her bill against the perch ! This proves that Bee-eaters
have no power (I have seen the contrary suggested) to resist the
effects of a sting. They make their prey harmless, as already
described, by banging it against their perch, and by passing it
backwards and forwards between their tight-closing mandibles.
For some weeks afterwards, the female would seize the bees and
bang them to atoms, but would rarely swallow them ; and the
male seemed less and less inclined to take them. This was more
than unfortunate, for the change of food would have been most
beneficial ; but they had acquired a taste for other things, and
rejected such plain and simple fare--a caution to parents.
Eventually, however, a happy thought came to my assistance. I
dip the bees in water, and now both birds take them pretty
freely--but never hurriedly as on the first day.
They regularly cast up the indigestible portions of the
cockroaches in the form of black oblong pellets.
In a really good light, the}'' can pick up a very small
cockroach without difficulty. And, as may readily be imagined,
they are by nature very good " catches."
They are exceptionally clean and inoffensive, not causing
the slightest annoyance in the warm dining-room, although
rather untidy, throwing morsels of food about the vicinity of
their cage.
I do not consider them to be specially intelligent.
They seem to be particularly sensitive to cold.
They cannot hop, and have to fly when changing from one
(*). Since I commenced the practice of wetting the cockroaches before.handiug them
to the male, his appetite for grapes has moderated. -- K. P.

perch to another. On the ground they crawl and scramble, for
their legs are much too short to enable them to run.
They are nervous and timid by nature ; and, although my
two are so tame, their inherent wildness would impel them to take
a rapid departure should they have the chance, notwithstanding
their daily and hourly protestations of affection.
The two birds are wondrously fond of one another, and
cannot bear even a temporary parting ; and I cannot help
thinking with apprehension of the advent of old Father Time
with his scythe -- for what will the survivor do ! Human beings
have to bear such partings, but they can look forward to The
Better Land. But not so the birds, whatever future there may or
may not be in store for them. Some lonely birds will take up
with a kindred spirit, but the Bee-eaters seem to be so different
that one cannot fancy them taking to any other kind : they are
all in all to one another.
And now I must draw my long story to a close--with a
moral :
" Let no man take unto himself a Bee-eater unless he is pre-
pared to take care of it." It will be gathered from what I have
written that to take care of a Bee-eater is a serious matter. But, on
the other hand, it is impossible not to grow fond of little helpless
creatures who trust in you and look to you for the supply of
every want. My Bee-eaters are the pets of the house.
Some years ago, a charwoman, who was doing something
about the place, referring to some birds, I forget which, said,
X( Why, Sir, you take as much care of them as if they were
babies ! " I turned upon her with an awful look of horror and
indignation. " Babies /" I gasped, " Babies! ! ! Babies can be
found on every door-step, in every 7 street, round every corner.
Babies ake common ! !! But my birds y 7 ou cannot get for love
or money. They are Rare ! ! ! " The poor woman was flabbi-
gasted. She was the mother of a goodly 7 crew, and outraged
maternal feelings must have utterance, although she was greatly
impressed with the force of my remark, which came upon her
with startling freshness. " Well, Sir, babies are common I
suppose ; but zee mothers set great store by them&amp;quot; :--which is just
as it should be.
[Supplementary Notes, iotli May, 1902.--My Bee-eaters

general appearance, they are fairly 7 alike. The crown, hind

neck, mantle, etc., of the male are of a deep, rich, almost
velvety, chestnut, which passes into the creamy buff of the
scapulars; but, in the male, the latter region is of various
shades, and edged with yellowish. Lesser wing-coverts, green,
the remainder dark chestnut-brown. Forehead, not white, but
pale yellow, passing into pale green, the two colours, much
mixed where they join, occupying the whole front of the crown.
Eyebrow green. A streak of green-blue runs from below the
base of the lower mandible, under the black band which covers
the eye, and terminates in a suspicion of a white spot--for only
occasionally can a trace of the white hinder cheeks be detected
in the male, and not at all in the female. Lower back buff,
freely interspersed with green feathers. Length of male's bill
(culmen) one and three-eights inch, female's a little less. The
yellow forehead of the female contains a few chestnut feathers ;
the chestnut crown, etc., is not of so deep and rich a colour, and
contains a few green feathers; and the somewhat varied creamy
buff of the scapulars, etc., is rather more uniform in the female.
The yellow throat is more brilliant and extensive in the male,
while his black throat-band is less distinct and defined. The black
lore-stripe is narrower in the female, and narrower than it was
before the moult. The general plumage above of the female is
lighter in colour than in the male, but less pure. The eyes of
both birds are very dark brown ; several times lately, and again
this day, I have carried each bird to the window, but fail to
detect a trace of the lemon-yellow of the adult.
In their behaviour, up till quite recently, the two have
been very different. The male receives me with outspread wing
and garrulous tongue, while the female had been quite un-
demonstrative. Although the singing has been nearly quenched
and the courting greatly suppressed by the excessive cold, the
latter has been only suppressed , and on a warm afternoon breaks
out with a little warbling and much aggressive pursuing, during
which unfortunately many feathers of wings and tails have been
broken. The female was quite unresponsive until about the
beginning of May, when a wave of migration-wildness and
" looking into space " came over her, which lasted several days,
and during which she scarcely fed. She has passed through this
phase fairly well, however; and now the two, sitting nearly face
to face, will "Q" at one another in a pleasing responsive manner:
she seems to have passed from girlhood into the adult woman
almost at a bound. Nevertheless I could hardly expect them to
lay in a cage, and to loose them in my exposed aviary would
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.995914255813954" page_id="10104206"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
probably be fatal, not only on account of the cold but because
they would most likel}&amp;apos; get hung in the trees. Even if eggs
were laid, they would hardly be fertile, as probably such birds
would copulate in the air on the wing.
The tips of the long wings, when the bird is well braced
np, cross much more extensively than represented at page 105.
They remind me of the Hobby in this respect.
There is now no mystery as to the cause of the out-of-bed
tumbles referred to at page 132. It would neither be pretty nor
anatomically correct to say that the husband kicks the wife out
of bed whenever she has the misfortune to be on his right side.
Without mincing matters in the least, and without a moment&amp;apos;s
delay, he now promptly " mandibulates " her off her perch,
although receiving her with sweetness and satisfaction when she
is fortunate enough to find herself on his left wing.
Only to-night a very noticeable little incident occurred.
At the entrance to their bedroom, another perch runs across the
usual roosting-perch, close to the side of the cage, and the male
often gets on to the wrong perch -- the female, on the other,
almost touching him, but not with the habitual side-to-side
pressure. Usually, at roosting time, I arrange them comfortably
(for they cannot hop about the perches like other birds), but
failed to do so to-night. Some two hours later I came into the
room, and the male appealed to me with great earnestness ; but I
heeded him not, for it was long after dark, and he was in a very
snug place. After a few minutes, finding that I did not take any
notice of him, he deliberately flew on to the bottom of his cage,
well knowing that I should not leave him there; and in a few
moments the two were cuddling together in complete satisfaction.
Mrs. Phillipps (who was present) all along has most solemnly
protested against a little paragraph I had inserted reflecting on
their intelligence ; and, after such an act, performed after a pause
of deliberate reflection -- call it instinct or reasoning or whatever
you like--I have no option but to withdraw the obnoxious state-
ment. And yet this is a bird--such is the force of habit -- who will
unhesitatingly eject his helpmeet from the bed if she chances to
be on the wrong side.
One of our old friends, probably the father of the Society
in respect of age, and still an enthusiastic aviculturist, Mr.
Turner, of Cullompton, reminds me that the French name of the
genus is Guepier, the species under consideration being " Ee
Guepier vulgaire" of Eevaillant. This is a great improvement on
our name of " Bee-eater," which prejudices unthinking persons

against a very valuable class of birds, while that of " Wasp-
eater " reminds us forcibly of the great service they render to
mankind by destroying countless numbers of injurious and
harmful creatures.
This evening, while I was engaged on these Supplementary
Notes, a letter arrived from Mr. Frank Finn, of the Indian
Museum, Calcutta, with an extract from which I will close :--
" Many congratulations on the Bee-eater article and plate. The
Green Bee-eater (Merops vifidis ) is a very familiar bird out here
and much admired."--R. P.j

By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
When you have built your aviary, the next question will be,
where to get your birds ? I may say as a sort of certainty that
you will have to buy your experience. Do not try to get what
look like cheap bargains ; in the case of foreign birds you will
always find them very dear ones. If you can do so, I should
recommend you to draw your supplies from the outdoor aviary of
some friend or neighbour, as by so doing, although you will pay
more, you are likely to get something that will live. It is far
cheaper to buy one acclimatised bird at ios., than ten just come
over at is. each. In buying of dealers, go to men of repute,
following the advice of Buckstone, who, when certain rabid
sectaries wanted to hire his theatre, replied, " that he confined
himself to the legitimate Drama."
On the question of when to buy ? acclimatised birds may
and should be procured at any time ; but for newly imported
stuff the summer should be chosen, as the risks at any other
time are enormous. To purchase delicate little finches in early
spring or winter is tantamount to throwing your money away.
When is the best time to turn birds out ? I should
personally always hesitate to do so till, what Chaucer calls,
" sweete May "--(though why he so designated that beastly
month I never could understand)--has safely passed. Then
when a nice warm week of sunshine conies, seize the opportunity
and give hostages to Fortune.
Isolate new comers for at least a fortnight, even though
they look all right when they come. It is better for the birds
themselves, as they have time to get over the hardships of their
past life ; and it is infinitely safer for your own stock; as,
when disease breaks out in a big aviary, it is very difficult to stamp

it out; whereas, if a bird goes wrong in a cage, why, there you
have him.
Do not be above learning. " We can all learn," as Jowett
once said, " even the youngest undergraduate." Remember
Luther's words to Melanctlion : " Tell Philip that he does not
know everything in the world." It is wonderful what a lot of
useful information can be picked up, if only ycu will not
pretend to be omniscient. S. Paul's words are worth remembering:
" Be not wise in your own conceits." What to buy is of course
largely a matter of taste and--pocket.
I append a list of birds--some rare and some otherwise--
from which, as the horticultural dealers say, we can make a
" suitable selection."
The Silverbill. An old and honoured friend, in spite of his
sober, snuff-coloured garments. He has the great merit of
hardiness. I might say that he is as hard as nails.
The Zebra Waxbill. A charming little bird, but alas !
common. "How can you keep such common stuff?" I was once
asked, " anybody can buy them ! " I say, " Happy anybody.
Are we to keep nothing but what is rare and expensive ? " Rather
let us thank God that there are birds within the reach of all !
The Dhyal is as quarrelsome as the natives of Sumatra
after the pepper harvest. He is a gentleman that, as the gardeners
say of certain plants, "needs perpetual restraint." Like a
naughty child, he is always getting into mischief, and is like a
certain boy I once knew, of whom it was said, you never
knew what he would be up to next. As a sly and crafty slayer
of small and inoffensive birds he could give points to the Thugs.
Given a nice big aviary all to himself, he will live and prosper,
and if you can find him a wife, he will do his best to increase and
multiply in the land.
The Cherrvfinch. The brave aviculturist will not be
content merely with gaudy and showy specimens ; he will
experiment with this modest Grassfinch, so-called from his sober
colouring. A charming little bird and fairly hardy.
The Scarlet Tanager will always delight and surprise with
its beauty ; just as when we sometimes come upon some glorious
sunset, we cry, " How lovely ! " so shall we do as often as we see
our scarlet friend flashing about. The hen is a very rare and
difficult bird to light on ; therefore, if you should find one, prize
her, for her price is above rubies. She is of sober olivaceous
tint above, and yellow on the breast and underparts.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998944976744186" page_id="10104209"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
The Dibfinch is a sober little fellow, clad in snuff with a
small black bib, and reminds one of a very respectable trades-
man with a nice bit in the bank. When I say that he is rare, I
have said enough to make some people determined to have him.
The Bicheno is quite a pigmy among birds. Gulliver
might have seen him in Lilliput. He is among birds what a
Shetland pony is to a Clydesdale. I should not advise you to try
him too much in the way of climate ; but up to a certain point
I should say he is fairly hardy.
Ihe Many-color is a most difficult bird to acclimatise. As
they sit in a row looking extremely sick and sorry, they always
suggest to me the words of the Roman gladiators when they
entered the arena, " Morituri te salutans." To those who
delight in funerals, when expense is no object, Many-colors will
afford every gratification, and, as an old woman once said to me
auent something else, " They make a lovely corpse."
The Superb Tanager is a lovely bird, and fairly hardy if
you do not expose him to too much frost. If the air should
become suddenly too nipping and eager, he will quickly shuffle
off this mortal coil. He, again, is lovely even in death; and if
you are of the same opinion as an old lady at Filey, who said
of a poor young lady who was drowned there, and whose body
was afterwards found, " Ah, but it is nice to have a dead body,"
then, even in your sorrow, you will find consolation in one who
is beautiful even in death.
The African Fire fin eh. Described by some as " not
perfectly&amp;apos; hardy&amp;apos;." I have kept these birds in a large outdoor aviary
in Yorkshire, winter and summer alike, and I never saw that they
" ailed aught." They should find a place in every aviary, for
their beauty is undeniable, and they have the merit of being
cheap. His coat always reminds one of the line in "Jerusalem
the Golden,"--" With jasper glow thy&amp;apos; bulwarks."
The Shamah is rather like his neighbour and cousin the
Dliy&amp;apos;al, and delights, when other birds speak to him of peace, to
make him ready&amp;apos; to battle. He loves a wide range, and requires
ample space wherein to exercise his wings. If you hear a great
stampede in the bird world you may be sure the Shamahs are
coming, and then it is a case of " sauve qui peut."
The Cordon Bleu is a striking little bird as long as he
lives, but the period is of very&amp;apos; uncertain duration. I have had
him as long as seven years, and I have lost him in less than
seven days ; so that to those who delight in games of chance, I
should say&amp;apos;, try the Cordon Bleu and you will not be disappointed.

The Australian Crimsonfinch is a very quarrelsome bird.
He would have quite sympathised with the Irishman who was
fined ^5, in some English town, for fighting, and who exclaimed,
on hearing the decision of the Bench, " Begorra, but wait till I
get ye in Limerick, where fighting is cheap!" I will back him
for his fighting weight for long odds against any bird I know
bar a Scarlet Tanager. I11 that case he will make him haste to
escape, and will seek a place to flee unto until the tyranny be
overpast.
The Sydney Waxbill is a bird for those who love "the
harvest of a quiet eye." He is none so common either, and when
I add that he is a "shy breeder," I have said enough to
recommend him to many.
The Green Cardinal is a beautiful bird with its blended
green, and yellows; but, alas, it cannot endure our gloom, and
damp, and fog. Cold it does not mind, but fog induces asthma,
and asthma ends in death.
The Virginian Cardinal, with his scarlet coat, has a sub-
tropical appearance, and, when you first see him in the aviary,
looks as though he had escaped from some happy land " Where
the flowers ever blossom, the beams ever shine." No frost can
hurt him, no weather make him afraid, and like Mark Tapley, he
always tries " to be jolly," and enlivens thedulness of winter like
the scarlet coat of the huntsman on the snow.
The Zostejops always reminds me of a " little girl wearing
granny's specs." He is a charming little bird, whose pretty
graceful ways one never tires of. He is an indefatigable hunter
after spiders, and will keep a large enclosure quite free from
blight, to the great benefit of the shrubs and of his own internal
economy.
The White-throated Finch is what cricketers would call a
"good all-round bird"; neat but not gaudy in appearance;
hardy in his nature and frugal in his ways. He seems to care but
little for the "joys of home"--at any rate in England--and
therefore to those who like a shy breeder I would say, "Try the
White-throated Finch and you shall not be disappointed."
The Nonpareil is a gorgeous fellow. One poetic dealer that
I know, with a view to increased prices, has christened him the
" Rainbow Finch." If a thing of beauty is a joy for ever, then the
Nonpareil should be in every aviary; but remember if you want
him to live long and see good days, you must feed him
property. Insect food is indispensable to his well being.
The Indigo Finch is a bird that does not believe that it is a
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.991005302325581" page_id="10104211"  page_num="166" year="" vol="">
good and joyful tiling for brethren to dwell together in unity. Put
a rival in his enclosure and he will hunt him as keenly as Saul
hunted David on the hills of Engedi ; and what is more, if he
gets him, he will make an utter end of him. "Azure Finch"
is the poetic name by which he is known to dealers, who "set
traps to catch men."
The Java Sfiarrozv in the white variety, is, with regard to
colour, like the cream of which we are told that " it is seldom
what it seems." Generally certain spots and blemishes have been
removed before his appearance in public, and these, like the weeds
in our garden, sooner or later reappear to the great sorrow and
indignation of the purchaser. Added to this, he is a dull
vicious bird, and therefore I would always prefer his room to his
company. The grey variety is a good tough bird, on which the
prentice hand should try his skill. I doubt that he could kill
him except by personal violence.
The Zebra Finch is a bright and cheerful little fellow, and,
"like a brother born for adversity," is always welcome. His life
is what Insurance Agents would call a " good one," and his gay
coat and sprightly ways will enliven the aviary at all times. He
is, moreover, a " free breeder," and Dr. Butler says he likes his
nest cleaned out and re-arranged ever so much ! ! !! ( a ).
The Pintail Nonbarcil is undeniably beautiful, but I dare
not recommend him as hardy. Still, I have wintered him out of
doors; but then you must be prepared, as the furniture removing
people say, " to take all risks."
The Parrot Finch. There are some birds that once seen are
loved for ever. The Parrot Finch is one. I have found him
pretty hardy ; and his beautiful crimson head and green body
colour are always admired.
The Cutthroat is a very desirable bird for a beginner to try
his prentice hand on, and the broad band of red on his throat
always suggests the idea that he has had an accident whilst shaving.
The Gouldian Finch is rather a sad and depressing bird,
suggestive of a text on human life, " So soon passeth it away
and we are gone." Their beauty is undeniable. Solomon in all
his glory was not arrayed like one of these ; but as a liver he is
distinctly disappointing, and always reminds one of a quaint
epitaph on a little child, I once saw : --
" I was so very quickly clone for,
I wonder what I was begun for."
Still, if money is no object, there is no harm in trying him.

Ihe Lavender Finch, if able to recover from the prostra-
tion of importation, is a charming little thing, and will long live
to charm by his soft and tender beauty.
&amp;apos;Ihe Avadavat, if not so common, would be valued by all.
In spite of this, he should find a place in what florists call " our
selection."
It has suddenly struck me that I had better stop here. A
story was told some time ago of a poet who wrote some verses
entitled, "Why do I live?" The Editor to whom they were
submitted returned them with these lines: "You ask the
question ' Why do I live?' We will answer it. Because you
sent your poem to us instead of bringing it.&amp;quot; My readers will
supply the parallel.
THE BLUE MOUNTAIN OR SWAINSON&amp;apos;S LORIKEET.
f Irichoglossns swa bisoni ) .
By W. OSBALDESTON.
The breeding of this species was accomplished, year after
year for some four years previous to 1S90, at the Blackpool
Aquarium and Menagerie, before the present Tower buildings
were erected. The place was then owned and kept by Dr.
Cocker, and then the birds were well looked after. His house
stood in the centre, with a toy arcade on the one side, and the
Menagerie, Aviary, and Aquarium on the other, and with the
large seal pond in the front, outside, as at present.
The Aquarium, since much altered in appearance, was on
the ground floor, as it is now.
The aviaries and cages were arranged on the upper floor,
along each side of the room in a continuous string, on a two-foot
high brick foundation covered with concrete, and were kept
scrupulously clean. Each cage was 7ft. high, 5ft. long, and 4ft.
deep. The back was a brick wall, with ends, divisions, and front
of strong, well made, one-half inch straight wire. The tops
also were wired, so that the fancy ceiling might not be damaged.
I11 some instances, two of these cages were made into one, and
this was the case with the Blue Mountains' home. The bottoms
were kept well supplied with fresh grass sods daily. The
temperature, winter or summer, was not allowed to fall below
50--60 degrees Falir.
The Bine Mountains were fed on canary seed, with now
and again some spray millet. Fresh water, for bathing and
drinking, was supplied &amp;apos; regularly, in large round earthenware

pans, iJin. deep. Apple, with a ripe grape or two--which they
liked -- was given by way of fruit, but none of the soft swashy
concoctions fb) which these birds are supposed to require. Log
nests were supplied, and also specially picked cocoa-nut husks of
a large size. Two or three pairs were generally kept together ;
and with them there were also some Rosellas (which they could
not get to breed) and Cockatiels.
These birds make fine pets, and are of an extremely lively
disposition, and rather excitable, at times dropping dead without
warning or apparent cause. They are sometimes rather noisy,
having the penetrating voices common to the whole tribe of
Lories and Lorikeets.
This species is much sought after, and finds a ready sale,
owing to its beautiful plumage. The young, when just fledged,
are like the parents, but not so vivid in colour. The male, which
as a rule is much larger than the female, has a deeper coloured
neck band--more of a dark blue. The breast plumage also is
more ruddy, and of a reddish orange shade, and the under tail
feathers are yellow and without spots. The hen has the usual
hennish look--if I may use the expression. The breast is more
yellow, the tail more greenish-yellow, and with spots ; and the
ring on the nape of the neck is green instead of dark blue. A
good representation of a pair is shown in " Vogelbilder aus
Fernen Zonen." When courting, the fantastical contortions of
the male, in his desire to please his mate, are exceedingly
amusing to behold.
One year a very curious, handsome, " sportively "
plumaged bird was reared. The head was red with lacings of
white, and the shoulders were tinted with green. The greater
portions of all other parts of wings, body, and tail were of a
bright chrome yellow, intermixed with green feathers here and
there ; and the tail feathers were tipped with red ; making a really
handsome, showy, and rare bird. It was a young bird in May,
1891, and was alive some three years afterwards to my know-
ledge. I went many times to look at and admire this rare-
feathered Lorikeet, for I took a great liking to it ; I wanted to
purchase, but they would not part with it. On one occasion, I
noticed that its claws had grown very long. It was always kept
in the same cage with the others.
The hardiness of this species, when properly acclimatised,
commends it to all.
(b). But how about the " dropping dead without warning or apparent cause ? " -- R. P.

They have bred some grand lions in the corridor next
to the aviaries, both before and since the desecration of the
latter ; for now the birds are kept in quantities, all jumbled up
together any how, simply for the purpose of attracting the
public.

this article for the information of our members. -- R. P ]
[We should be glad of the experience of other members as to the
difference in the plumage of the sexes of Swainson&amp;apos;s Lorikeet. We have
owned several of these birds and have invariably found the males slightly
larger than the females; but in one pair in which there was not the slightest
doubt of the sexes, the female was by far the brighter coloured bird, with
an almost entire!}&amp;apos; red breast ; whereas the male had very little of this
colour on his breast at first, although it became redder as he grew older.
We believe that the extent of the red on the breast depends entirely upon
age, and not sex. -- Ed.]

Mr. Finn's little book on the Birds of Calcutta (c) consists
of some twenty-four articles which-have from time to time
appeared in the Asian. It is written in a popular and pleasant
style, and contains many interesting notes on the habits of the
birds, their nests, and eggs. Under most of the headings are
included several species, which bear the same popular name.
Those who are interested in Indian birds will find much that is
well worth reading in this little book, which especially appeals to
residents in and visitors to Calcutta.
Professor William E. D. Scott, of the Princeton Museum,
has contributed a paper to the American journal Science , on
Data of Song in Birds, and the acquisition of new songs, which
should be read by all interested in this subject. He mentions
several instances of birds imitating the song of other species, and
acquiring new songs. A remarkable case of a wild Rose-breasted
Grosbeak {Zamelodia ludovicianci) saying several sentences quite
plainly, is mentioned ; but we can only suppose that the bird
had escaped from captivity.
Part 3 of the Emit, which is a considerably enlarged
number, completes the first Volume of this journal, which has
already been noticed in our pages. The present number contains

Our Society has probably sustained a greater loss than it
is aware of in the sudden death announced in The Tunes of Sir
Harry Thompson, K.C.M.G., Administrator of S. Lucia.
Both he and Lady Thompson were interested in birds and
might have been trusted to do the best they could to secure the
birds of any places in which they might reside, and as Sir Harry
was in the prime of life, we cannot say to what places he might
not have been appointed, from which he might have secured
bird rarities. Apart from this, however, Lady Thompson will
have the sincerest sympathy of our members in her bereavement.
BIRD NOTES.
Mr. Finn contributes some interesting notes on the White-breasted
Kingfisher Halcyon smyrtiensis) of India, to the April number of the
Zoologist. This bird occasionally practices piracy. " An individual which
haunts the Museum pond," Mr. Finn writes, " wherein there are some
Dabchicks, has several times been seen by me to attempt to rob one of
these birds of a fish which it had captured, and once, at all events, with
success."

European birds in Tasmania. The commonest species, as might have been
supposed, is the House-Sparrow, which appears to have been introduced from
Adelaide some thirty or forty years ago, it is thought, in mistake for
the Tree Sparrow. It is now so numerous that it does an enormous
amount of harm to the grain-crops and is detested by the farmers in
consequence.
It is pleasing to hear that our delightful Goldfinch, which was
introduced some twenty years ago, has thriven well, flocks of forty or
fifty individuals being seen at a time. Its increase appears to be regarded
with favour, as it is said to do much good "by feeding on the Scale and
other insect pests with which the trees are infested."
The Starling {Sturnus vulgaris) was brought to Tasmania from New
Zealand about the year 1800. It has thriven and multiplied; but, although
it does much good by destroying harmful grubs, it becomes a nuisance in
the fruit season by its " depredations in the orchards " and legal protection,
which was at one time extended to it, has now been withdrawn.
The introduction of the Skylark into Tasmania is of a more recent
date. Some thirty or forty years ago a number were imported from
England and liberated near Newtown, but these did not thrive; and as recently
as ten or fifteen years ago others were introduced, which have succeeded
well, and their descendants are now fairly numerous in the paddocks in
the Newtown district. Others have been introduced into various parts of
the Island and have done well.
Pheasants, Partridges and Red Grouse have all been tried, but have
not become established up to the present time. The great drawback to the
successful rearing of game birds in Tasmania seems to be lack of sufficient
suitable cover.

Sir,--I am getting along famously. I get some one to wheel me to a
nice sunny spot where, with the aid of my glasses, lean watch the birds.
This afternoon (April 29) I spent watching a pair of Long-tailed Tits building
--I was within a few yards of them the whole time ; it was most interesting
and amusing ; only the foundation of the nest is laid so far. It is placed
on the branch of a pine, overhanging the drive. A number of Jackdaws
have again taken up their residence in the old elms that border the drive ;
also a pair of Stock Doves. There is also a Brown Owls' nest in one, but of
course I cannot climb about to find it out yet.
Starlings are everywhere. I found one nest in the middle ofa thick fir,
containing five pure white eggs. I have a young friend with me who investi-
gates any nests I discover. On Sunday, a brood of Moorhens hatched in a nest
in one of our Fancy Duck enclosures. I think one of the old birds is one

I reared last year, but am not sure ; I mean to try and find out ; I can
identify it by the left foot, as one of its toes is broken and bent out of
position. I will examine the traces in the mud at the side. I have been
watching the old ones for about an hour, but have been unable to get a
glimpse of the feet. One old bird was on the nest while the other fed on
the bank ; in about a quarter of an hour the latter swam to the nest, which
is placed iu the centre of the roots of an alder growing out of the water about
six feet from the bank. The little ones immediately clambered out of the nest
and waited to be fed ; the old one then disgorged the food, giving its head a
good shake each time, and then fed each one in turn ; after being fed, they
climbed back into the nest and tucked themselves away under the mother.
I am afraid they will not survive long. Crows and rats are too numerous.
In this enclosure are Mandarins, Sheldrakes, Carolinas, Fulvous,
Indian Spotted-bills, Rosybills, Pintails, Magellan Geese, Black Wild
Duck, call Ducks, and others I do not know. The Mandarins, Carolina,
and Black Wild Duck all have nested this year, and are sitting I believe.
The Cuckoo is very much in evidence here. I noticed a pair of
Redstarts yesterday ; and several pairs of Swallows were flying about the
lofts and outhouses.
One of the boatmen at the coast is going to try to obtain some Ring
Plovers'and Oyster Catchers'eggs to-morrow; I hope to rear a few in the
incubators.
I am afraid you will think me somewhat childish, writing like this,
but nothing gives me so much real pleasure as the study of the living
creatures by which we are surrounded. Wai.TKR G. Percivae.
[Mr. Percival knows how to make a good use of the long, and too
often tedious, hours of a slow recovery. The nest of the Long-tailed Tit
is a wondrous and beautiful structure. I was not before aware that the
Moorhen regurgitated its food for the benefit of its newly hatched young.
But, when one comes to think of it, there is no other way in which such a
bird could carry the food to its still feeble and chilly brood. At the earliest
stage that I have ever had an opportunity&amp;apos; of making an observation, the
parent (only one visible) continuously picked up minute--to me invisible,
though not many feet distant -- specks of food, which it placed on the
ground just in front of each chick in turn, as they&amp;apos; slowly and silently&amp;apos;
hunted along the edge of the water, the chicks picking up each atom of
food so placed before them, but little or nothing besides. Nevertheless
they appear to feed independently&amp;apos; of their parents at an early&amp;apos; age, but
perhaps not so early as some of us may have supposed. -- R. P.]

Sir, --It may interest you, and perhaps some members of our Society,
to hear of the escape of my Crowned Crane last Friday. Iliad intended
taking Mr. St. Quintin's advice (page 124), and had arranged for Mr. Hart,
owner of the Museum for Birds at Christchurch, to come over and pinion
him on the following Wednesday&amp;apos; ; for we had noticed he had once or twice
in the evenings flown on to the top of a fence over six feet high. At about
7 o'clock on Friday, April 25th, he suddenly flew on to the top of a house,

aiul, a few minutes afterwards, on to the roof of the Church, which we can
see from our windows. After that he was seen in a garden at some
distance ; but it grew late and dark, and we could not do anything. We
had bills posted, and advertised in several papers, but heard nothing; so I
greatly feared he had been shot, or was starved for want of food.
On Sunday morning, we were told he was in the Churchyard, and
there, standing on a tomb enclosed all round with high iron spiked
railings, we found him ! He did not make the slightest resistance to being
caught ; and, indeed, I cannot help thinking he put himself there on
purpose to be seen and taken. It was .so clever of him to fly back to the
Church, which he evidently remembered was close to his old home.
He ate and drank ravenously, and slept for many hours. Beyond
seeming very weak, and having a scratch on his leg, he was none the worse,
and is now daily getting back his strength. He seems perfectly happy to be
back, and I don't believe would fly away again ; though we took the
precaution to cut the wing feathers shorter (they had scarcely grown in the
two months) ; and to-morrow he is to be pinioned.
I know you will understand how glad I am to have him back again,
for I never thought he would return of his own accord-- and he is such a
beautiful bi?d ! ! ! OCTAVIA GREGORY.
[The advice of our experienced Treasurer should not have been
disregarded. But Mrs. Gregory is to be heartily congratulated, not so much
on the recovery of the Crane--with which we have every sympathy -- but on
the remarkable occurrence that she should have found a locality in England
where the inhabitants have attained to such a pitch of civilization as to
allow a strange bird to be at large over one full day without butchering it.
I can quite agree that the return of the Crane to the Church could not
have been altogether an accident. Doubtless the outline of the Church was
associated in the bird's mind with safety, peace, and plenty, and
instinctively, when he found out what a mistake he had made, he flew back
to the well remembered landmark.--R. P.]
THE BLUE MOUNTAIN OR SWAINSON'S LORIKEET.
Sir, --I bought six Blue Mountain Lories in November, 1900, and put
them in cages in a cold greenhouse. One died, one I got rid of, leaving the
two pairs, which I turned into an outdoor avairy (by themselves) in
September, 1901 ; they appear to be in perfect health. Will you please let
me know, (1) Have they ever been bred in England ? (2) What kind of
nesting-places should I provide ? (3) Would you leave them in the aviary f
for good ?
I feed them on baker's bread soaked in milk, canary seed, and lump
sugar, of which they will eat three or four lumps each a day ; oranges the)&amp;apos;do
not seem to care for. C. CasTI.E-Si.OANE.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Castle-Sloane :
Swainson's Lorikeet, the familiar Blue Mountain "Lory," was
successfully bred in the Blackpool Aquarium in the autumn of 1890. Two
young were reared. I heard a good deal about them at the time, but forget

particulars. See the U.K.F.C.B. Society's Reports, Sept.. 1890, pages, and
May, 1S91, page 3. See, also, " Notes on Cage Birds,page 163. I rather think
that it has been bred since, but am not sure. Of course it has been bred in
Germany. It nests in holes and hollows from preference. Log-nests are the
best, if the holes are large enough ; many of the log-nests sold are
unsuitable. The best results are often obtained by the log being placed
sideways, but slanting well up, fixed close under some shelter, with the top
partly removed, so that the birds may use both top and aperture. But all
these birds are very accommodating when really in good breeding
condition ; get them into perfect health, and keep -warm, and they will nest
fast enough -- but take care that the nest has a saucer-shaped depression, so
that the eggs may not roll about. I)o not use sawdust as, in a dry place, it
chokes up the pores in the shell, and the young die before coming out.
Their proper nesting season is the autumn, and the normal number of eggs
is two.
They do much the best in an aviary, the larger the better ; but for
successful breeding, like other Lorikeets, they will probably require to be
kept warm.
The stronger they are, the more savage they become, and cannot
with safety (unless there be one of each sex, forming a pair) be kept with
Lorikeets, Conures, Brotogerys, or birds at all like themselves. If the aviarv
be large they will not, as a rule, injure other birds : but they are selfish,
interfering creatures, and often spoil the nests of other species.
If the aviary be sufficiently warm and sheltered, they had much
better be left alone, for the}&amp;apos; will be less likely to nest if moved about and
interfered with.
I am very doubtful if the two pairs can be kept together should
either think of breeding. I hardl} r think that they are sufficiently sociable
to nest together like Budgerigars, but do not know. I should fear murder,
and recommend that they be closely watched as the nesting season
approaches.
I do not quite like your food. I should stop the bread and substitute
plain biscuit : give plenty of milk. If you sweeten it, use white sugar in
preference to brown. Try and get them on to fruit. I use grapes, cut up
and served in china (not metal) dishes, of which my Lorikeets used to be
very fond. Try also banana and apple.
Fits are what you have to guard against. These may be brought on
by excitement, so if possible never catch or hunt the birds. But the fits
are usually brought on by indigestion in some form or another, stomach or
liver. Therefore feed them on slops and fruit as much as possible--and a
mealworm may be given occasionally. Fluid magnesia in the milk or
drinking water is the best preventative, should you see a bird lumpy, or
closing its eyes as if it had a headache ; occasionally, too, when threatened,
it will shake its head, or rub it against its perch, as if trying to get rid of
something. Reginald Philupps.

Sir, -- Without pretending that the method I am about to describe of
determining the sex of a given bird is infallible, I believe that, as a general
rule, it does obtain, the exception being young subjects of the year.
I have had a good deal of experience in handling birds, more often
dead than living ones, and I find that if the bird is placed on the left palm
with its head away from the observer, the feathers on the breast will, if the
bird is a female, part readily, leaving a bare space, varying in width, with
the breast-bone for its centre ; if, on the contrary, the bird is a male, the
feathers will not divide in the same even manner, but will be found growing,
more or less closely, over the whole surface, even over the edge, or margin,
of the breast-bone, or keel.
I shall be glad if other aviculturists will make observations in this
direction for themselves, and either confirm or disprove my theory.

GOLDEN PHEASANTS WITH QUAILS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98351294117647" page_id="10104220"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I see in the May issue of the Avicultural Magazine a correspondent
asks, if it would be safe to keep Golden Pheasants with Quails and other
small birds ? I have done so for over five years and have never had a little
bird injured in any way except by accident ; and that was when some
young Chinese Painted Quails were newly hatched off, and two were trodden
on. The Pheasants never attacked the smaller birds, and I have had various
cocks.
Want of space necessitated my putting one pair of Quails into the
Pheasant aviary for about eight months, otherwise I should not have done
so, as the Pheasants disturb them too much by walking about, and over
their nest, and it was difficult to protect it properly.
My aviaries are only 21 feet long by 9 feet wide; probably in your
correspondent's aviaries, which are 57 feet long, the Quails would be
perfectly right.
I have kept Golden Pheasants for eight years, and never had a bad
tempered cock yet, although I cannot make them quite as tame and
confidential as the hens. A. H. Brooksbank.

longisli, thick at the end and slightly curved ; colour, greenish brown
above; head dark ; light grey below, with a dark bar running down sides
and crossing abdomen behind legs.
I should say that No. 2 was insectivorous, from its Tit-like move-
ments. Chas. Cushny.
After receiving Mr. Cushny&amp;apos;s letter , I wrote for more information , to which he
replied on May 6th. The following answer was then sent to him :
I am afraid your descriptions are not exact enough for the identi-
fication of the birds.
No. 1 was probably a Bunting or Lark, judging from the reddish-
brown cheeks ; but I do not remember any Passerine British bird with a
dark bar down the back ; it sounds more characteristic of a young
Gallinaceous bird.
No. 2 may, I think, have been a Tree-Creeper; its constant
activity and nervousness seem characteristic of that bird ; but, in your first
description, you mention a yellowish patch on head, in addition to the
stripe over eye, which is perplexing.
The description of the bird seen on May 4th is more puzzling, if
possible, than the others. I know of no small British bird in which the
abdomen, behind the legs, is crossed by a dark bar.
Descriptions of birds seen in the woods, or during a country ramble,
are never satisfactory. A bird constantly on the move in bright sunshine
may seem to be marked with bars hicli, perhaps, are merely strong
shadows of twigs, cast upon the bird's body by the sun. Sunlight also
greatly alters the apparent colouring of a bird; changing browns to
glistening gold, or white to buff; it intensifies reds and greens in a
marvellous manner.
When descriptions of birds are sent to cabinet ornithologists, their
reply is : "Send vis the birds and we will name them for you," and I think
they are wise. A. G. BUTXER.

"I have a Pennant's Parrakeet that, instead of having a red breast, is

it a distinct species ? "
The following answer has been sent to Signora Baldelli.
In Gould's ' Handbook to the Birds of Australia,' Vol. II. p.p. 45 and
46, the author states, respecting Pennant's Parrakeets, that -- "The colour-
ing of the sexes when fully adult is alike, but much variation exists
between youth and maturity; during the first autumn the young birds are
clothed in a plumage of a nearly uniform green ; to this succeeds a parti-
coloured livery of scarlet, blue and green, which colouring is continually

changing until the full plumage of maturity is assumed ; and hence has
arisen no little confusion respecting this species in the writings of the older
ornithologists."
Your bird, therefore, is probably not fully matured.
A. G. Butler.
[There is a very rare Parrakeet, which is said to inhabit the interior of
New South Wales, known as Masters's Parrakeet {Platycet cits mastersianus) a
specimen of which is at present on view at the Zoological Gardens. It is
very like Pennant's Parrakeet but has much more blue on the plumage,
and it is possible, although hardly probable, that the bird owned by Signora
Baldelli is referable to this species. -- E d.]
THE PRAIRIE OR BURROWING OWE.
Sir, -- I should be greatly obliged if you could tell me if the sex of
the American Burrowing Owl can be distinguished by the plumage.
About two months ago, I bought a couple from a dealer in
Bournemouth. When they arrived, they had chocolate-coloured head
feathers, and a few largish speckles on their breasts, the under parts being
brownish. In a very short time they assumed what I suppose is their adult
plumage, viz., speckled heads and thickly spotted breasts, the under parts
in one bird especially becoming much whiter. This bird has white eye-
brows, and a white patch under the chin. It is the larger and more
forward of the two. The other bird much browner, and has very little
white about it; it is also slighter u build.
The backs, wings, and tails of both resemble those of the Little Owl
in colouring. E. F. Chawner.
The following reply was sent to Miss Chawner:
The female Owl is usually the larger ; and my female BurrowingOwl
is slightly larger and more thick-set than her mate. But, as far as plumage
is concerned, it is your smaller bird that is most like the female.
Have you noticed which bird hoots ? Towards evening, I frequently
see the male hooting, but have never detected the female so doing. Of
course, during the night, I do not know which bird it is that hoots.
Watch your birds, and observe which is the more talkative and
sprightly, and the more ready to come to the front to do battle.
My female is a splendid mouser. Reginald Phillipps.
[Note. -- Further information received seems to prove that, in this
case, it is the larger, lighter-coloured, white-chinned bird, which comes
bowing to the front with out-spread wings to protect its mate, that is the
male.--R.P.]

Pitta brachyura.
By Reginald Phillipps.
In November last, at page 8 of the current volume of our
Magazine, the Rev. Hubert D. Astley gave us a short sketch of
the Indian or Bengal Pitta, Pitta bengalcnsis, or Pitta brachyura
as the Museum Catalogue (Vol. XIV. p. 423) has it, a brood of
four young hand-reared specimens of the species having reached
his hands in the previous September. They were, at the time of
writing, moulting from the dull brown of the first plumage into
the second feather, the whole colouring being then " the same as
in the adult bird (as figured in Gould's ' Birds of Asia') except
that it is altogether duller."
Mr. Astley was very fond of his Pittas, and probably
looked forward to breeding them during the present summer, as
I certainly had hoped to have done. But "Thebest laid schemes
o' mice an' men , Gang aft a-gley." Mr. Astley's schemes ganged
all a-gley through the cruel tyranny of the medical men who,
almost without notice, heartlessly banished him from his native
country ; and for months he has been a wanderer and an exile
in foreign lands. And my visions of baby Pittas ended as
castles in the air and soap bubbles are wont to do, as those who
will take the trouble to read this article will shortly perceive.
When ordered abroad, being unable to take the Pittas with
him, Mr. Astley most kindly gave me the refusal of them ; and,
on the 19th December, 1901, the four birds found themselves in a
cage in my dining-room.
Before parting with them, Mr. Astley had made a very
pretty painting of one of his pets, which he most kindly
presented to me for the Magazine. It was too large, and has
suffered considerably in being cut down and reduced, so that it
might be brought within the limits of our pages. Nevertheless
it gives us an excellent idea of the Pitta in the second feather,
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.988208318181818" page_id="10104227"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
I.So
which, as already stated, is like to but duller than the plumage
of the fully adult bird. Hut the birds have left Mr. Astley's
hands, and so it has fallen to my unhappy lot to write the account
of the species which has to accompany the coloured plate. Yes,
my unhappy lot, for my story is a story of failure, and it is not a
pleasing performance- not pleasing to oneself at any rate -- to
trumpet abroad one's own incompetency. Nevertheless failure is
an experience ; and Dr. Greene, in days long since gone by, once
told me that all experiences are valuable. This paper, con-
sequently, is, or ought to be, of exceeding value, and should
therefore be read by every aspiring aviculturist who may be
thinking of investing in the not inexpensive luxury of a family
of Pittas.
It will clear the air, and help our readers to understand
the situation, if J state at once the two main causes of my failure ;
these were, the pugnacious character of the species, and my want
of space which prevented me from providing suitable and
separate lodging for each of the four birds. They are not
quarrelsome, .although a great nuisance, with birds of other
genera ; but no two Pittas, no matter the sex, could be kept
together, even in the comparatively large spaces (loose I mean)
of dining-room, bird-room, or aviary. My accommodation for
the birds is limited, especially during the cold season, when so
many, practically all of my So -- 90 birds, have to be brought into
the house. A vieulturists who live in the country cannot form an
idea what it means to be unable to extend one's boundary in any
direction by as much as two inches. Again, although my
summer arrangements are rather nice, in winter my bird-room,
which opens on to the back of the house and is shut in by pro-
jecting buildings, is hopelessly dark and altogether abominable.
And when I add that the Pittas, although so welcome, for one
cannot secure a Pitta every day, came to me quite unexpectedly,
after every inch of available space had been very much more
than appropriated, it will be readily understood that it was
impossible for me to treat them as Pittas should have been
treated.
They are not small birds, and require a good deal of space
if they are to be maintained in health ; and I found too that,
owing to the darkness, they did not get on well if shut up in any
of the "houses" in my bird-room, although the smallest of
these is slightly over 4ft. long by eft. by eft. Besides all this,
they are delicate as regards temperature ; and, having but
partially-moulted wings, for some months they kept chiefly to
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.995540395348837" page_id="10104228"  page_num="181" year="" vol="">
the ground, and thus were more liable to take chills. And here
yet another misfortune came in. At Benliam Park they had
evidently been kept at a far higher temperature (in a greenhouse
I understand) than I was able to give them, and the moult of
some of them, especially of the flights, seems to have suffered a
check. This may have been caused by the terribly cold journey
from the country to this house ; for, notwithstanding the care
with which they were packed up and brought to me by hand,
they looked pinched and tucked up for two or three days after
their arrival. One queer little fellow, smaller than the others,
did not progress with the moult, could not fly comfortably, and
eventually died of consumption on April 7th last, the best bird
of the four dying, likewise of consumption, five days later. This
latter I had let loose in the bird-room with a female, in the hopes
that they might pair up ; but one day she turned upon him and
drove him out into the garden (during a part of the day, if not too
cold, the window would be left a few inches open, to allow the
hardier birds egress and ingress), where I found him hiding away
in terror in a damp hole, soaked to the skin and shivering with
cold. I am not satisfied that he died from the effects of this chill ; I
slightly lean to the suspicion that the female had previously
detected weakness, an unpardonable crime in the eyes of birds of
this class, and had instinctively turned upon him to his
destruction.
This habit in some creatures of killing off the weak
and sickly members ot their respective species has often
been used as an argument in support of the "Survival of the
Fittest " theory ; but, taken by itself, it does so only in a limited
degree. Some species are vicious and pugnacious and some are
not. A pugnacious or vindictive bird will unhesitatingly murder
its fellow, although a better bird than itself, if it can catch it at a
disadvantage, (hie of the best Shamas I ever had, in perfect
health, was murdered in my aviary just because he had indulged
too freely in a bath and was unable to defend himself. I have
noticed on several occasions, with various bellicose species, that
if there be two foes in the same aviary, neither will dare to wash
lest he might be caught by the other, for, whether it be tubbing
or moulting, they know perfectly well how completely they will
be at the mercy of their antagonist. Again, I once had a fairly
good Bluethroat ( Erithacus cyaneculus) nearly murdered (he would
have been wholly murdered had I not come to the rescue) by a
fellow Bluethroat who was dying --he was actually dead by the
next morning.

On the other hand, as every practical aviculturist knows,
with many species, the healthy and the dying will live together
to the last moment, cuddling together, the healthy bird kissing
and fondling the dying mate or friend, and bewailing its
inevitable departure.
No. 3, No. i in order of time, was run to death by the
same female that afterwards caused or hastened the death of No.
2 ; and the study of her case leads us on to another feature in the
economy of the Pitta which I must bring under notice for the
information and guidance of aviculturists ; and I feel sure that
Mr. Astley will forgive me if, in the cause of aviculture, I differ
from him, and may seem to find fault with the management of
the birds whilst they were under his care.
Before forwarding them, Mr. Astley warned me that their
feet were delicate, and that I must take care not to have coarse
sand on the bottom of their cage.
It seems many generations ago since I received my first
Pied Rock-Thrush. Those I first obtained had been fed on
mealworms, and I continued the high feeding ; and swollen feet
and abcesses on the faces quickly followed. I studied the case
carefully; and I came to the conclusion, a conclusion the
soundness of which I never have had occasion to doubt or cause to
modify, that it was the too high feeding that had produced the
evils referred to and others besides. For years and years I have
kept the Pied Rock-Thrush, up till this last April to be precise, but
have never since had a tumour on a Rock-Thrush--nor on aii} r
other species excepting the Pitta.
Some years ago, I obtained a couple of immature Golden
Orioles. A well known German aviculturist chanced to pay me
a visit, and, seeing the Orioles, warned me against allowing the
perches in their cage to become dirty as they had very tender
feet, and would get swollen feet if I were not careful. I
remembered the Rock-Thrushes, and was satisfied in my own
mind that my visitor was mistaken. Between that day and this
I have had many Orioles, Golden and others, and have some still,
but have never had an Oriole with a suspicion of a swollen foot.
With these experiences to look back upon, I naturally, if
egotistically, attributed the swollen feet of the Pittas to the
bounteous hospitality of their owner rather than to the sand.
The feet of three out of the four Pittas were bad, one very bad.
So ill has this last bird been sometimes that I have looked upon
her case as almost hopeless. And yet this is the sole survivor of
the four Pittas, the slayer of one, perhaps of two, of her companions.

Little notice was taken of her after she had been left alone with
no one to murder. Neither mealworms, cockroaches, nor dainties
fell to her lot; she had to fare as best she might and rough it
with all the rough ones of the miscellaneous aviary ; and yet her
feet have not been exhibiting any signs of tenderness for quite a
long time past.
The one that came to me with sound feet is the male I
have already referred to as the "best" of the lot.
The first death in order of time was in connection with
these swollen feet. The murderess in esse and another female
were together in a cage in my dining room, both with bad feet:--
they were too ill to quarrel. They were being specially treated
with fluid magnesia and taraxacum, and externally with sperma-
ceti ointment. Occasionally I would open the door of their cage
and allow them the run of the room; and the softness of the carpet
was unquestionably acceptable. On January 21, I noticed marks
of profuse bleeding. The murderess had, with returning health,
recovered her natural vindictiveness, and given chase to her
companion ; and a swollen foot of the latter had burst, and the
bleeding had been very serious. Direct^ I noticed what had
\0x25A0occurred, I caged the sufferer and carefully nursed her, and the
next morning she seemed very much as usual. Then I made a
fatal mistake, for which I cannot be too severely censured. The
bird was an invalid ; and if I had continued to treat her as an
invalid all would have been well. Again I let them both out
together, loose in the room, not having at that time fully
realized the nature of the Pitta. All was quiet at lunch time,
but, some two hours later, I found that the sick bird had been
pursued to such a condition of faintness and exhaustion that all
efforts to revive her were fruitless, and she died from collapse,
owing to the loss of blood, a few hours later. This bird's life was
thrown away, a consequence, not (as I am often told by one who
ought to know) of my having too many birds, but just from want
of space.
How easy it is to be wise after the event ! How little did I
dream when I received these four Pittas with so much pride and
satisfaction that such a mournful story was before me ! Pride
*coineth before a fall. One must buy one's experience.
I have referred incidentally to the Pitta being a nuisance
when kept with other birds. It is in a sense a bold and forward
*species, and always helps itself to the best of everything.
And it does not stop at this, for, standing in the food as it usually
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.995956302325581" page_id="10104231"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
does, it keeps away other birds, and fouls the food in an
unusually objectionable manner.
The Pitta is an insectivorous species, and must be fed
accordingly. From time to time my birds would gladly partake
of cut up grapes, but this probably more as medicine than as
food; and seed was occasionally picked up. It likes everything
to be very small; and when given even quite a moderately sized
cockroach it often loses it, owing to the inordinate time it takes
in pulling it to pieces ; in this connection, it is about as silly a
bird as ever I came across. When given a cockroach, it sets to
work to dismember it, looking up every second or two to see if
there are any enemies near; and, the more enemies there may be
about, the more does the Pitta hold himself up and wag his tail,
and the slower is he over his work, until one sometimes loses all
patience with him; for in the bird-room it is almost impossible
to get him to swallow any tit-bit unless one stands guard over
him to keep away the other birds. If left to himself, up conies
some other bird ; and the Pitta, leaving the cockroach
unprotected on the floor, stands perfectly upright on his long
legs like a Crane, his tiny tail, rapidly moving up and down,
appearing between his straddled legs, like a very much shortened
tail of a gentleman's dress coat as our host stands on the hearth-
rug with his back to the fire in the traditional attitude of John
Bull. It is in this position that I should like to see the species
portrayed ; but, when one is not one's own artist, the most
interesting and characteristic positions and movements of one's
pets are usually lost to the world.
The boldest of his adversaries is the male Rufous-chinued
Faughing-Thrush (Trochaloptemm rufigulare \--Museum Cata-
logue, Vol. VII. p. 365), a jolly, straight-forward, simple-hearted
bird, without viciousness or vice of any kind, and always waited
upon by his admiring wife as by a shadow. So sweetly innocent
is he that, when he sees a cockroach, he concludes that it must
be intended for himself and for himself alone, and goes for it in
the most simple-hearted and straight forward manner imaginable,
without frown, or raised feather, or threat of any kind, and
equally without regard for the blustering attitudes of the Pitta.
As he advances, the Pitta recedes, holding himself up to his
highest stretch, and opening, expanding, and waving his wings,
in order to intimidate the intruder by the unexpected sight of
the large patch of brilliant white within. I11 a gloomy swamp or
jungle, where the bird itself would be practically invisible, the
flash of white might have the desired effect. Punch is as bold

as a lion, albeit somewhat cautious, and for a day or so kept at a
distance from so uncanny a fowl as the Pitta. But a coward is
soon found out. Punch soon took his measure ; and, in all
simplicity, he now blandly hops up to the cockroach, and with
perfect urbanity hops off with it to some cpiiet retreat.
But by far the slimmest thief is the Brown-eared Bulbul
(Hemixus flavala :--Museum Catalogue, Vol. VI. p. 49). This
individual bird, the only specimen of the species I have ever
seen (*), is not very forward when the "Advance " is sounded.
He is hardly the kind of champion the trembling maid of ancient
history would select to do doughty deeds on her behalf, nor quite
the kind of man a prudent general would choose to head a
forlorn hope ; but a more capable person to lead an advance to
the rear could not be found in all India. He would as soon
think of bearding the Pitta in his den as of eating his own head.
So clever on the wing and quick at dodging is he that one
cannot imagine the hawk that would be sharp enough to
strike out a single feather.
Picture to yourself the Pitta in the bird-room occupied with a
cockroach, the window being a few inches open, and your humble
servant standing over both with a long stick in his hand, in order
to drive away the adversaries. O11 this occasion, however, these
precautions seem unnecessary ; all the larger birds are in the
garden, or are supposed to be ; not a foe is visible ; and the Pitta
and the cockroach are happy. Suddenly a wild piercing
shriek, a kind of double shriek, rings through the room, and the
Pitta starts up in alarm. There would be a faint sound of a flutter
of something somewhere, a sort of a shadow across the retina,
a half impression that a ghost had brushed past uncomfortably
near to one, and then all would be as silent as the grave. The
startled Pitta would look carefully around, would slowly
recover himself, would give a wag of relief, and turn once more
to his cockroach. But the cockroach has disappeared! In vain
does the Pitta turn himself about, and search hither and
thither and between his own legs : it slowly seems to dawn upon
him that he has been fooled, and like a snubbed cur he slinks
quietly away with his tail between his legs, and is seen no more.
Outside, in the aviary, a crowd of birds are pursuing one of their
fellows which has a cockroach in his bill, but all in vain ; at the
very first pause the cockroach disappears down the artful one's
throat--and I feel about as foolish as the Pitta.
(To be contimied).
Since this was written, one specimen of the species has reached Mr. Hamlyn&amp;apos;s hands.

By W. T. Greene, M.A., M.D.
There is nothing particularly accipitrine-looking about
Deroptyus accipitrimis except its name, or names, which are more
*or less inappropriate, and if I had the re-naming of it, I should call
it the Ruffed Parrot, for it raises the feathers of the neck and the
back of the head into a kind of ruff or nimbus that imparts a
wonderfully weird and characteristic appearance to it, and
differentiates it at once from every member of its family.
Like all the Caiques (unless its temper is spoiled by
teasing), it is a merry, gentle, and loveable bird, not exceptionally
intelligent, perhaps, but full of tricks, and capable, too, of
repeating a few words, and even short sentences. It certainly
discriminates between different people and never addresses one
person in mistake for another.
For example, one of these birds that I had the happiness
of possessing, "Joe}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;," whom (I cannot say "which" in this
connection) I bought at the door from a pedlar for half a
sovereign and some old clothes, never said, " Ah, ha, papa! " to
anyone but myself, whom he evidently considered to be the head
of the house ; nor did he ever begin to cry like an infant except
when my youngest boy came into the room and approached
his cage ; but he would say " Ta," (tali) to anybody who
presented him with a grape or a bit of biscuit, and if he liked
the morsel he could keep on repeating his thanks while he
sucked or ate it ; but if it was not to his taste, he would fling
the morsel to the ground with an exclamation that sounded like
an expression of disgust, " Huah," and scream, which I regret
to say he could do, and occasionally did : but he was a dear old
fellow for all that--alas ! that I should have to speak of him in
the past tense, but the best of friends must part in this transitory
life of ours.
Joey had a very funny trick of revolving round his
perch with a celerity that made one dizzy to look at him when so
engaged ; what his idea was, it is impossible to guess, but if I
said to him, "Turn round, Joey," off he would go at the rate of
many revolutions to the minute, although the moment before he
might have been half asleep, and the revolutions did not even
seem to make him giddy ; then when he had revolved as much,
or as often, as he deemed advisable, he would erect his
head and neck feathers, look you full in the face and exclaim,
" There! " as much as to say, " Was not that well done ! "

The performance was always rewarded with a tit-bit of
some kind, and perhaps that was the reason he was so ready to
obey when he was asked to " turn round."
Another trick of his was to hang by one leg from the
upper perch in his cage, ruffle all his feathers, let his wings
droop, and whine exactly like an infant in distress. So realistic
was the imitation that visitors who heard him for the first time,
but did not see the bird, have said to me, " I did not know you
had a baby in the house," and would scarcely believe me when
I told them that the noise they heard was the utterance of a
Parrot and not of a child. This performance Joey would
frequently indulge in when alone and probably felt himself to be
neglected, but if a real baby voiced his, or her, feelings in his
hearing, at once the bird would fling himself from his perch
and try to out-whine the little human performer.
He had his antipathies as well as his preferences had
Joey, and one of the former was my youngest son, then a child
of about seven or eight years old, who used to tease the Parrot,
and had been cautioned against doing so, for Joe had a powerful
bill, and I feared that he might make it felt if provoked too far.
He was let out of his cage every day, and at such times
Charlie was enjoined by no means to go near him, but on one
occasion he did, and the Parrot " went for him " with a yell of
defiance, or of exultation in anticipation of revenge. Charlie
fled, with the Parrot after him ; hearing the commotion, the cook
rushed out of the kitchen, just in time for my little boy to bury
his head in her apron, and for Joey to nip her arm, which he did
so effectually that the wound had to be sewn up. The good
woman, however, who was partial to the Parrot, took the
mischance in excellent part, with the remark, " Never mind, sir;
better it be my arm than Master Charlie's face, and I know he
(the Parrot) didn't mean it."
Although he had large and powerful wings, Joe had not
the least idea of flying, and when I thought to induce him to
use his dormant powers of flight by turning him into the garden
aviary, he was evidently so unhappy there that I had to take him
in again, and on being restored to his cage he exclaimed " Tah,"
several times with unction, and then began to twirl round his
perch with more than his accustomed energy.
Joey was not a young bird when he came into my
possession, and had begun to pluck himself--the man I bought
him from (I hope he had not stolen him) said the Parrot was
" moulting," but I knew better, and thought I could cure him;

but no, he gradually got worse in this respect, and at last looked
the veriest scarecrow, though I had introduced him to a lady of
his own species that had been given to me some time before, and
her society for a time seemed as if it might wean him from his
evil habit.
"Pinto" was the name we had given to the lady in
question in honour of the friend who had made me a present of
her, which reminds me of a funny misprint that was made in
a paper I was contributing to a monthly magazine. I had
written : " The first bird of this species that I had seen was
presented to me by a Portuguese friend," but the compositor,
whose thoughts were evidently running on his dinner, turned the
last word into " fried," and when I corrected the error and sent
back the slip to the press reviser, the proof was returned to me
with a query mark against the word " fiend," which was the
compositor's second attempt to make me say the thing that was
not ; but the sentence appeared as I originally intended when
the article came out in the magazine for which it had been
written.
Needless to say, I was much delighted when I received a
letter from Senhor Pinto asking me to accept a rare Parrot from
the upper regions of the Amazon, a beautifully coloured bird
about as bigas the African Grey Parrot with the red tail. It had
a curious habit, he said, of erecting the feathers at the back of
the neck and head into a kind of Elizabethan ruff, which gave it
a very singular appearance.
I accepted with effusion, as the P&amp;apos;rench say, and the
Parrot arrived in due course. Naturally, we were all curious to
see the strange bird, and the whole family crowded round to
watch me open its travelling cage.
" Pinto," as we immediately named the Parrot, or as we
had done in anticipation of its coming among us, I forget which,
immediately stepped out upon the table, shook itself, and then
gazing calmly round upon the assembled multitude, ejaculated
" Well," with a distinctly interrogative inflection, as much as to
say, " What are you all staring at, I should like to know ? "
There was plenty of seed in the travelling cage, but I
thought the Parrot might be thirsty, so I offered it some water in
a cup, of which it took a few sips, and, dear me ! what a funny
bill it had ! The lower mandible projected beyond the upper
one, which rested upon it, for quite half an inch, and had the
appearance of a little shovel or rather scoop.
When Pinto had satisfied his thirst he put his bill on the
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999335428571429" page_id="10104236"  page_num="189" year="" vol="">
table (there was no cloth on it) and ran round it several times,
every now and then emitting a curious little squeak. He was
wheeling a barrow one of my boys said, and the noise he every
now and then made reminded me of a revolving wheel, of which
the axle wanted greasing.
This, we afterwards found out, was a favourite trick of
Pinto, and was probably done with a view to rubbing down the
redundant portions of the lower mandible.
Pinto was perfectly tame, and talked a great deal in an
unknown tongue, one of the dialects, no doubt, of some native
Indian tribe on the Amazon, but his only English word was
"well," and he never picked up another.
He had his likes and dislikes too, and was particularly
inimical to a lady visitor who often came to see us, but he never
attempted to bite, though evidently enjoying the fright he used
to put her into by pretending to run at her with all his feathers
bristled up, hissing vehemently the while, but Pinto's bark was
much w T orse than his bite.
When I afterwards, several years afterwards, acquired
Joey, I noticed that there was a good deal of difference in the
appearance of the two birds, and that Pinto was somewdiat
smaller than my new acquisition, whose head, face, and pointed
nuchal feathers were creamy white, while our old friend had the
same parts of a dull or dingy grey.
Subsequently I ascertained that this was the sexual
difference, and that Joe} 7 was the gentleman and Pinto the lady.
I had a pair, and why not a little family of Hawkheads by
and bye ?
It is not well to count one's chickens before they are
hatched, but we are all apt to do it, and prepare a disappointment
for ourselves, and I am no better than the rest.
The tw 7 o birds u 7 ere never very friendly, but they did not
exactly quarrel, and in time, perhaps--but I have reason to
believe that Pinto was advanced in years, and that Joey had
passed his first youth, but whether it was the thought of lost
opportunities, or jealousy of the new comer, I know not, but to our
great regret Pinto seemed to pine away, and, in a few months
after her introduction to Joe, passed to that bourne-.
Is it necessary to describe the plumage of those well-
known birds? I think not; a glance at the splendid portrait of
the August Amazon in the June number of our Magazine, and
a little draft upon the imagination, will give our members a
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.99721675" page_id="10104237"  page_num="190" year="" vol="">
very fair idea of the personal appearance of the Hawkhead,
which has longer feathers on the back of its neck than the August
one, and a different coloured head, otherwise the likeness holds.
I have understood that these birds, the Hawkheaded
Parrots, are not very uncommon in their native zone, where they
are frequently tamed and kept by the inhabitants, but they are
not often taken down stream, and not many of them find their
way to Europe; those that are imported are, as might be
expected from their up-bringing, charmingly tame.
It is well not to tease them, however, for it is possible to
ruin the most angelic temper by so doing, and make the gentlest
of created beings vicious--not that either of my Hawkheads ever
deserved so crushing an epithet, but I must admit that Joey was
somewhat irascible at times, though Pinto never was.
On referring to the plate of the August Amazon, I see that
both sides of its tail are brown ; in both my Hawkheads it was
green above, and black on the under surfaces. The head and
face feathers of the Hawkheads are narrow and pointed, and
there is a wide margin of dark corrugated skin round the eye,
but with the differences mentioned they resemble the August
Amazon exactly.
THE REDSTART.
Ruticilla phocnicurus.
By A. G. Butler, Ph. D.
Of this charming little Thrush I have had a good many
examples at various times, chiefly owing to the liberality of my
friend, Mr. E. P. Staines, of Penge, formerly a member of this
Society.
Although, like its relative the Robin, the Redstart cannot
be regarded as a very long-lived bird ; it is an extremely pleasing
addition to a mixed aviary, soon becomes confiding, is not
dangerous to birds of other species, and has a pleasing plaintive
Robin-like song.
The wild life of the Redstart is pretty well known, and I
am afraid I can add nothing to the facts already recorded
respecting it ; the bird itself is readily recognizable, the upper
surface showing much slaty grey colouring, the under surface a
good deal of rusty reddish ; the characteristic features however
are the chalky-white forehead and the large black gorget
enclosing the base of forehead, lores, eyes, cheeks, and throat.

The singularly springy vibration of the tail is also a distinguishing
peculiarity of Redstarts.
This species, being a summer migrant to Great Britain,
was formerly supposed to be extremely delicate ; Swaysland
(Cassell's Cage-birds p. 313) quoting a correspondent who con-
sidered it impossible to winter the Redstart without a fire. In
very severe seasons this may be the case, as witness the effect of
21 degrees of frost upon a specimen given to me by Mr. Staines
in 1S93 ; although that bird appeared to be none the worse for
the cold, it died during the change into summer plumage in the
succeeding spring.
The spring change, not being produced by a moult in this
species, nor even by shedding the margin of the feathers, as
Seebohm asserts* (Brit. Birds, Vol. I. p. 291); but, by an extension
of the bright colouring into the margins of the feathers ; would
not be expected to weaken a bird, so as to accelerate its death ; yet
I have lost a good many birds, of various non-moulting species,
at that time ; and, in nearly every case, death was manifestly due
to exposure during the winter. For this reason, although the
Redstart and many other species may not be especially delicate,
I think it better that they should pass the winter in a temperature
not lower than 50 deg. Fahr.
Although like the Robin in many of its actions, in its
tawny russet breast, in its song, and its habit of nesting in holes ;
its eggs are quite dissimilar, being indistinguishable from those
of the Hedge-Accentor. The Robin is a very dangerous
associate for other small birds, and played havoc in the aviary of
the present Editor of " The Zoologist " some years ago, drilling
holes in the heads of three or four of his finches in one night ( a ) ;
I have however always found the Redstart quite indifferent to the
presence of other birds, except when feeding ; and then a
Zebra-finch, or even a Waxbill, could scare him away.
But, though Riiticilla is so polite to strangers, what I have
to record will prove that he is anything but a gentleman. In the
autumn of 1901 Mr. Staines brought me a pair of Redstarts
which I turned out together in my long covered aviary, among
Waxbills and other tiny finches. During the winter they
* The specimen just spoken of showed the fringes entire, but some of them parti-
coloured, in all gradations from ashy to tawny red. A. G. B.
(a). Of the many Robins which I have kept in aviaries, not one has done any
mischief; which should, I think.be a caution to some of our friends, not to decide upon
the innocence of any bird from their personal experience of its behaviour. A. G. B.
Mine, if allowed to, would sooner or later murder the Nightingales, irrespective
of sex. R. P.

behaved fairly well, excepting that whenever the male wished
to feed he objected to his wife sharing the meal, and invariably
drove her away. This, being a not infrequent failing among
savages, I did not consider a dangerous symptom ; and therefore
looked forward hopefully to a more amicable state of things at the
approach of spring, and to the prospect of breeding this pretty
species in captivity.
Alas ! when the (unusually wintry) spring of this year
ought to have arrived, the male bird was anxious to enter the
estate of matrimony ; but the female was by no means prepared
for so early a wooing, and fled in terror from her boisterous lover.
Being more swift of wing, the male bird always succeeded before
long in capturing his coy charmer, whom he hammered over the
head in the most brutal manner ; so that, one day, I discovered
the unfortunate bird in a corner with all the feathers torn from
her scalp : she was so dazed, that I picked her up without
trouble ; and, after anointing her head with vaseline, put her by
herself in a flight-cage, gave her two or three mealworms, and
some fresh food. In an hour she seemed much better, and, for
about a week, I hoped that she would yet be all right before
May ; in which case, I might still have a chance of breeding
with her ; but one morning I came down to find her dead.
Now, although the cock Redstart ought to have known
that his brutal treatment of the hen bird was the cause of her
disappearance ; I had no sooner removed her, than he began to
bemoan her loss,--" wheet-tit, wheet-tit " all day long; as he
wandered restlessly about, evidently searching for her in all
parts of the aviary ; and this he did, day after day, for several
weeks ; after which he resumed his song, and seemed reconciled
to his bachelor condition.
This experience, I think, tends to show that the sexes of
the Redstart ought to be kept apart, until the arrival of the
natural breeding season ; when, in all probability, they would
soon make friends : it also suggests the likelihood of two
male Redstarts fighting as fiercely as two male Robins, if kept
together in the same enclosure.
How long Redstarts live when at liberty, I don't know ; but
repeated observations upon the Robins which build in my garden,
or my son's, year after year, has convinced me that three years
see the beginning and end of their existence as breeders. Each
cock Robin has some peculiarity in its song, which, to one who
hears it daily, stamps its individuality; it is thus easy to
recognise a new singer, in place of the old.

In captivity, I believe it is possible to keep a Robin in
health far longer than three years ; and, therefore, I hope to be
more fortunate with my present Redstart, than with any of its
predecessors ; none of which, I think, has lived with me for
more than about two years.
I do not doubt that the majority of male Robins are
parricides, fighting with and murdering their fathers, as soon as
they have become vigorous enough, and their male parents
feeble enough, to render the result of a combat a foregone
conclusion. Is this also the case with Redstarts ? I fear it is the
case not only with these, but with many other birds ; probably
with Blackbirds, which one sees grappling, fiercely pecking, and
tumbling over in the dust, regardless of all else, but the desire
to kill one another. This struggle for existence is necessary now,
to enable all the young birds which are born to live; if the older
did not go to the wall, the feeding grounds would not be
sufficient to supply the needs of the rising generation : so the
birds, which might have been caught and petted, are condemned,
by the present law of England, to be slaughtered by their own
offspring. Man often muddles when he tries to help nature : this
country will onl} 7 maintain a constantly decreasing number of
birds; they must eat in order to live; and where their food is
not to be found, no law that ever was framed will induce them to
settle. Goldfinches, say the ignorant, are becoming scarce,
because of the birdcatchers: not a bit of it ; they are plentiful
as ever, but not here; because of the incessant building on all
pleasant places, and all waste ground ; because of the wholesale
levelling of copses and spinneys, and the mowing down of acres
of thistles and hard-heads. The Goldfinches arrive in their
myriads as aforetime, and they cry to one another, "Where are
the desired habitations of former years ? Where are the pleasant
woodlands which our fathers have spoken of? The land of
England has become a waste wilderness of bricks and stucco,
where no sensible Goldfinch may find rest for the soles of his
feet." Therefore they pass on to lands less civilized, and more
congenial : and so shall it be with the Redstart and many others.

THE BURROWING OWL.

<reference confidence="0.695174">
Speotyto cu?iicula)ia (Mol.).
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Most of us remember the story, told to us in our child-
hood days, of the little Owl of the American prairies, which
lived with the prairie dog and the rattlesnake, and how the latter

member of this happy family usually broke up the party hy
devouring its two companions ! Needless to say this was nothing
but a fable ; but that the Burrowing Owl very frequently
occupies the burrows of the prairie marmot in North America,
has been proved by good observers, who also tell us that the
young marmots form one of its chief articles of diet. This
pretty and interesting little Owl inhabits both North and South
America. In the Northern Continent it appears to be more or less
migratory, according to Captain Bendire, who tells us that in
Washington, Idaho, and Oregon, they migrate about the
beginning of November and return in the early part of March.
The burrows of the prairie marmot are very numerous in many
parts of North America, and where this is the case the Owls very
seldom excavate burrows for themselves. In districts where the
burrows of mammals are scarce however, as on the South
American pampas, Mr. Hudson tells us that he believes nine-
tenths of the Owls make their own burrows. " While stationed at
Fort Lapwai," Captain Bendire writes, " I had an opportunity to
see an Owl at work enlarging and cleaning out a burrow. The
loosened dirt was thrown out backwards with vigorous kicks of
the feet, the bird backing gradually towards the entrance, and
moving the dirt outward in this manner as it advanced. These
burrows vary greatly in length and depth, and are rarely less
than five feet in length and frequently ten feet and over. If on
the level ground they usually enter diagonally downward for two
or three feet ; sometimes nearly perpendicularly for that distance,
when the burrows turn abruptly, the nesting chamber being
always placed above the lowest part of the burrow. If on a
hillside it will frequently run straight in for a few feet, and then
make a sharp turn direct to the nesting chamber. At other
times the burrow follows the curves of a horseshoe, and I have
more than once found the eggs in such a burrow lying within
two feet of the entrance, and close to the surface of the hill on a
trifle higher level ; where, had it been known, they could have
been reached with little trouble. These burrows are generally
about five inches in diameter, and the nesting chamber is
usually from one foot to eighteen inches wide. After the burrow
is suitably enlarged, especially at the end, dry horse, and cow
dung is brought to the entrance of it, where it is broken up in
small pieces, carried in and spread out in the nesting chamber,
which is usually lined with this material to a thickness of one or
two inches, and I have never found any other material in the
nest. In California, however, they are said to line them
occasionally with dry grasses, weed stalks, feathers, and similar

<bodyText confidence="0.997694279069767" page_id="10104244"  page_num="195" year="" vol="">
materials. On one thing most observers agree, namely, that
these burrows invariably swarm with fleas." The number of
eggs laid to a clutch is said to vary from six to eleven.
This Owl is far more diurnal in its habits than most of its
congeners, and never seems to be dazed by bright sun light. It,
however, becomes much more active towards dusk, and feeds
principally between sunset and sunrise. Their actions are most
quaint ; if approached they generally bob up and down, then
spread out their wings and clap their mandibles together with a
*curious sound. " If closely approached," Mr. Hudson writes,
" it drops its body or bobs in a curious fashion, emitting a brief
scream, followed by three abrupt ejaculations ; and if made to fly
goes only fifteen or twenty yards away, and lights again with face
towards the intruder ; and no sooner does it alight than it repeats
the odd gesture and scream, standing stiff and erect, and
appearing beyond measure astonished at the intrusion." My own
birds never screamed when approached, but if they saw a dog in
the distance they immediately commenced to emit the scream,
followed by the three abrupt ejaculations, described by Mr.
Hudson.
The food of the Burrowing Owl consists of any living
creatures that it is capable of killing, from prairie dogs to
beetles. In North America young marmots, ground squirrels of
several species, chipmunks, gophors, mice, rats, frogs, lizards,
snakes, and insects of almost all kinds, are devoured; and
Captain Bendire believes that these birds will eat more than
their own weight in twenty-four hours. Mr. Hudson tells us that
" occasionally they are seen preying by day, especially when
anything passes near them, offering the chance of an easy
capture." " I have often," he writes, " amused myself by
throwing bits of hard clay near one as it sat beside its kennel;
for the bird will immediately give chase, only discovering its
mistake when the object is firmly clutched in its talons. When
there are young to be fed, they are almost as active by day as by
night. On hot November days multitudes of a large species of
Scarabceus appear, and the bulky bodies and noisy bungling
flights of these beetles invite the Owls to pursuit, and on every
side they are seen pursuing and striking down the beetles, and
tumbling upon them in the grass."
In captivity these little Owls are very easily kept. They
should have a good sized aviary, and an artificial burrow should
be constructed for them. A good way to do this is to place an
inverted wooden box, with a large hole cut in one side, in a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999819" page_id="10104245"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
196
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.990894075" page_id="10104245"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
corner of the aviary, and from this lay a good sized drain pipe,
about three feet long. The whole should then be covered with a
large mound of sand, leaving only the end of the pipe visible.
The drain pipe should be of considerable size, say nine inches in
diameter, and should have about two inches of sand on the
bottom, or invert, so that the Owls will not have to walk on the
cold earthenware pipe itself. As to food, nothing conies amiss in
the way of dead creatures, providing that they are fresh ; birds,
mice, rats, or even butcher's meat. Insects are also greedily
eaten, especially beetles of all kinds.
Mr. Meade-Waldo, who has bred this species several times
in his aviaries, tells me that the young ones burrow as soon as
they can run ; and, curiously enough the young of the kittle
Owl, Athenenoctua, does the same, but leaves off when grown up.
He has also pointed out another very interesting feature in which
the young of this species and those of A. noctua , are alike, namely
that they have a complete juvenile plumage, between the down
stage, and the adult plumage; whereas in the Scops family
the young moult direct from the down stage to the adult plumage
as do the Hawks.
A DEMOISELLE CRANE.
By Mrs. Gregory.
" Kra-aak -- kra-aak -- kra-aak " -- that is the voice of
Cocpiette outside my window. Coquette is the name of my
hen Demoiselle Crane, and that thrice repeated gutteral cry
brings back to my memory another voice, more powerful, more
resonant, in its trumpet-like notes--the voice of my beloved
" Carlos Mateo," a bird of such wonderful fame--" his like shall
ne'er be seen again " ! He was a fine specimen of a Demoiselle
Crane was Carlos--upright, defiant, bold as a lion when he had
his mistress to defend; walking up with his stately measured
tread at the first advance of a stranger, his red eyes shining like
precious stones, and his whole bearing alert and watchful.
Bound me he would sidle keeping very close guard, and the
moment the intruder's eye was off him, instantly he would fly
with outstretched wings, beating then; violently, and occasionally
giving a sharp peck with his beak if it were a gentleman ; with
ladies he did not behave quite so badly. If anyone touched
anything belonging to me he was up in arms in a moment, even
to the extent of standing before particular seats and nooks in

the garden, and guarding them jealously, so specially did he
associate them with me.
As all who have kept Cranes know, insects form a large
portion of their food, and are sought by them continually
with great diligence. Now, I have observed that all outdoor
birds are particularly partial to Spiders --certainly Demoiselle
Cranes have a great weakness that way. If my husband found a
nice, large, fat spider and offered it to Carlos, thinking to pro-
pitiate him--down he would flop upon his breast in that sudden
unexpected way these birds have--right on the top of the spider
which remained hidden underneath, until my husband walked
away ; then the Crane immediately allowed it to crawl lortli,
when he would eat it with much relish. He would never allow
anyone but myself to give him any food. To walk into the
aviaries behind me (closely following like a dog, which was his
habit always in the garden) was a daily pleasure to my dear bird ;
and he would patiently wait, standing by my side, as I fed
Golden, Silver, and Amherst Pheasants with mealworms,
knowing his turn would come last of all; and this, with his
imperious masterful disposition, was very wonderful, for I have
never known him to allow the hen Crane either to eat, drink, or
enter their enclosure before him.
One of his prettiest ways was to come to all the lower
windows of the house in turn, peering into each room and gently
tapping with his beak to find out where I was. As soon as he
caught sight of me he was perfectly content to take up his stand
and remain for hours watching me, and waiting till I came out.
Without exception he was the most faithful follower that ever
was, outdoing dogs in his affection, which was never that of
cupboard love or greediness : in this he differed from most pets.
His dancing (which he always commenced at a signal from me),
his posturing, bowing, and curtseying, were all of a piece with
his graceful form and elegant exotic appearance, so that he was
a thing of beauty from morn till dewy eve ; and on my first
rising, his dear face and keen and anxious eyes would be gazing
up at my window; and the last thing, as I looked out on a fine
moonlight night, I would see him standing like a sentinel,
guarding--not only the other birds--but the house in which he
knew his mistress slept.
And now to tell the sorrowful end of this most loved and
loving bird! One morning after dancing over the lawn in
perfect health and spirits, seeming as if in the joyousness of his
heart he could go on for ever--I left him--and in another hour

my Crane lay stiff and stark in violent convulsions. I carried
him in my arms to a sheltered spot, for he could not stand, and
although I saw plainly from the first I could do nothing to save
him, I tried all possible means. To the very last he gave a little
" purr " each time I stroked his head or neck--then all was still
and his sufferings were at an end !
" Arsenical poisoning" was the verdict! He had pecked
at some wire netting, newly painted with green paint, which had
been put up to keep dogs from entering the garden, and which
Carlos resented, as it prevented him from walking up to the
front door to wait for me--his daily habit. Thus through his
devotion he died.

Avery interesting paper entitled ' A visit to the Furneaux
Group of Islands,' was read before the Field Naturalists' Club of
Victoria, by Mr. D. Le Souef, C.M.Z.S., on Feb. ioth last, and
was published in the Victorian Naturalist, (Vol. XVIII. No. 12).
These Islands are situated in Bass Strait, off the North-Fast
corner of Tasmania, and appear to be seldom visited from the
mainland, although some of them are inhabited. Sheep and
cattle are kept by the inhabitants, whose chief industry, however,
lies in the taking, and preserving as an article of food, of the
young of the Short-tailed Petrel f Puffinus tenuirostrisJ commonly
known as the " Mutton-bird." The following account is ex-
tracted from Mr. Le Souef's paper.-- Ed.
" These interesting birds nest on many of the smaller
islands, such as Chappell Island, Little Dog Island, Little Green
Island, Great Dog Island, Babel Island, and many others. The
Tasmanian Government have prohibited the taking of the eggs
of the bird, but allow the young birds to be taken for six weeks
during the months of March and April. These birds, as is well
known, come in from the sea to lay about the 25th November,
and deposit their one white egg at the bottom of a burrow about
four feet in length, which is sometimes straight, other times not.
Both birds take turns in sitting on the egg, the absent one being
away at sea during the day feeding, returning just after sunset
to its patient companion in the burrow, but occasionally both
parent birds are found together in the burrow during the day.
One egg is laid, but it is probable that if that is taken they lay

another in the course of about ten days, but this has not yet been
finally proved. We were enabled to visit a rookery just at dusk
and to witness the wonderful incoming of the birds -- a never-
ending source of interest and wonder. How the birds, as they
fly swiftly in in the semi-darkness, are able to pick out their
right burrow from so many thousands of other burrows,
apparently almost identical, is a matter of wonder, and so far it
has completely puzzled us. It is a fascinating sight seeing so
many thousands and thousands of birds whirling round over
one, but mostly flying low; and then, as the new arrivals enter
their burrows, they are welcomed by their mates with extra-
ordinary kinds of sounds which, coming from the earth, seem
to make them all the more weird. The birds leave again at early
dawn. Apparently their object in coming in during the dusk is
to escape the attacks of the birds of prey, which during the day
keep a fatherly eye on any stray birds they may find on the
land, especially the Ravens. These birds hunt over the islands,
and any egg they find on the surface or in a shallow hole is soon
disposed of, and any Mutton-bird or smaller Petrel they find
near the surface and within view as it sits in its burrow they at
once pounce upon, and, after a hard tussle, generally end in
dragging the unfortunate Petrel out and eating it; consequently
those birds that nest in deep holes fare best, and the tendency
naturally is that those who make deep burrows survive, and those
who make shallow ones run a great risk of not surviving, as
flocks of Ravens, Co?one australis, are to be found in all these
islands. The young birds are taken in March and April, either
out of their burrows, or caught when they are on their way to the
sea. They are then plucked, cleaned, and salted down in casks,
and every islander, and others also, have a busy time of it while
the " birdiug," as they call it, lasts. It is estimated that about
600,000 young birds are yearly taken for food, yet, although such
an enormous number is captured, they do not seem to diminish
to any appreciable extent, which shows that a great number of
young birds escape every year. Some rookeries are diminishing,
but I think that is more due to cattle being allowed to wander
over them and break in the holes, even when the birds are
nesting, as it is apt to drive the birds to other places were they
are less disturbed."
Among tlie recent additions to the Zoological .Society's collection,
is a fine specimen of the Greater Bird of Paradise (Puradisea apodaj from
the Arrow Islands.

Our Secretary has asked me to review the first part of this
admirable work : and, although others of our members would
doubtless be more competent to do justice to a treatise upon the
Psittaci, it is delightful to be able to express one's pleasure at
the appearance of another well-illustrated avicultural book, by
one of our scientific members.
At one time Aviculture was looked down upon as a mere
pastime, by systematic ornithologists : the fact being, that its
methods of observation were unenlightened, its attention
to scientific details wanting, its publications frivolous, and
abominably illustrated. Of late years all this has changed:
so that the avicultural publications now being issued compare
favourably with those produced by cabinet-workers; and have
an equal claim to recognition by the scientific world.
The first part of Mr. Seth-Smith's book now before us,
comprises an account of the Loriidce ; of Calopsittcicus, Ncisitcrna,
and the Conurince; and consists of forty pages of clearly printed,
concise, instructive, information ; invaluable to all who elect to
make a study of these birds.
The three new coloured plates, by Goodehild, are admir-
able in drawing and pose of the subjects ; but I could wish that
he had been willing to sacrifice some of the brilliant colouring
to light and shade : it would have relieved Forsten's Lorikeet of
its flatness, if there had been shading on the tibial feathers and
under tail-coverts.
Frohawk's plate of the Ornate Lorikeet is one of the least
pleasing of that artist's productions : certainly the subject is an
unhappy one for any artist to portray, from its resemblance to an
old-fashioned worsted mat ; but Frohawk has done many better
plates than that.
Two of the blocks in the text are unsatisfactory:--the
Cockatiel contemplating suicide on page 21 ; and the hunch-
backed Golden Conure with a gum-boil, on page 31: the latter
reminds me forcibly of an old apple-woman who used to sit at
her stall in St. Paul's Churchyard, hard by Shan the baker's,
when I was a lad : it is far too decrepit and surly-looking for any
Parrakeet I ever came across.

I can find no fault with the text. Mr. Seth-Smith recom-
mends bread and milk for Lorikeets, which makes me shudder :
but then he knows and I don&amp;apos;t; because I never tried to keep

<bodyText confidence="0.98238525" page_id="10104250"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">
This is a work that should commend itself, not only to
those who are interested in the avifauna of Gloucestershire, but
to all who take an interest in British birds and their life history.
The author is a keen observer and his book can be relied upon
as thoroughly accurate, and as the habits of birds differ but
little in different localities, his observations will be found useful
to ornithologists in all parts of the country.
The author has divided the book into two parts. In the
first he considers those causes and effects that may be more or
less peculiar to the county, such as the influence of its position,
of geological and physical features, of its climate, accidental
causes, etc. In Part II. he divides the county into four districts,
each very distinct in its natural features, and possessing, more or
less, an avifauna of its own. The North-West District, com-
prising the Forest of Dean with its forest-loving birds; the
Severn District, with its Waders, Ducks, Geese and Gulls; the
Vale District, comprising the flat lands, chiefly consisting of
pasture fields, of the Severn Valley ; and the Cotswold District--
" an elevated country of stone-walls, downs, sheep, arable land
and scattered woods."
One of the most interesting accounts in the book is that
of the Severn Sheld-Ducks, part of which we herewith print :--
" These ducks are summer visitors, but occasionally one stays
late in the autumn, or indeed into the winter months. The local
names of " Barrow-duck " and " Burrow-duck," are due to the
birds nesting usually in holes. Many of these are situated up
the red sandstone cliffs, and cleverly chosen, if possible, about
five or six feet under a projecting top. Frequently the nest is
inland. Various sites are then selected in banks and hills, and

the holes often are rabbit burrows. Nests seem also to have
been found nearer Gloucester, on the tops of short broad willow
trunks out of which spring the dense growth of withies. A
somewhat remarkable feature is the distance inland the birds
will go to nest. Two miles is no unusual distance, but in June,
1S96, a nest and eggs were found at the top of Stinclicomb Hill,
4^ miles from the river and about 700 feet above its level. In
order to bring down the young birds to the water, the old birds
carry them from the cliffs, usually in their bills, by the scruff of
the neck, like cats carrying kittens, but occasionally tucked up
between the legs. Sometimes, too, if they are walking 011 land,
they carry the young on their backs. This method seems to be
adopted in dense withy-beds, probably because taking out the
young in the other ways, would bruise them either against the
withies or the ground-growth. However, when the birds nest
some distance from the river, they do not necessarily carry their
young the whole way ; for on several occasions early in the
morning, the old birds have been seen crossing roads, escorting
their broods towards the water. Such a procession too is formed
from the high-water mark if the tide is out. When the sun is
rising on some June morning, and trying to pierce, with a cold
yellow gleam, the fog that still clings to the river, there may
faintly be seen in the dimness what appears to be a curious long
animal, slowly wending its way over the sleek shining mud. As
it conies out of the mist, it will be seen to consist of a Sheld-
Drake followed by a newly-hatched brood : the Sheld-Duck is
the last and helps with her bill the little running stumblers if
they fail to go fast enough."
This book is written in a distinctly novel style ; it is not a
mere list and description of the species to be met with in
Gloucestershire, like most works on county Ornithology; but is
written in a continuous form, and the distribution of the county's
avifauna is discussed in a philosophical manner. Each
pa^e contains some solid fact, recorded from the observa-
tions of a keen observer and true naturalist ; and we put the
book aside with a feeling that Mr. Mellersh had taught us much
of the life history of birds. Six good drawings by Mr. E.
Neale, M.B.O.U., illustrating birds in their natural haunts and
surroundings, are given. Of these that of the Buzzards sailing
over the Forest of Dean is perhaps the most pleasing.

Local Names for the birds in Gloucestershire, and a Reference

In a very interesting article, published in the Field of May 17th last,
Mr. Dalgliesli describes the birds to be met with in an Indian garden. The
commonest bird is the blouse Crow ( Corvus splendens) which, although the
tamest of birds is also the wariest. "Provided you have not a gun," Mr.
Dalgliesli writes, " he will let you approach within a few yards of him ; but
at the sight of a gun he is off at once, and, as they say of the Rook, he
seems to smell powder."
The Indian Magpie ( Dendrocitta rufa) is also common, and a great
nuisance in a garden, as 110 vegetable or fruit is safe while he is about.
Mynahs of four kinds are common, namely the Common Mynah ( Acri-
dotheres tristis), the Pied Mynah ( Sturnopastor contra ), the Grey-headed, or
Malabar Mynah ( Sturnia tnalabarica), and the Black-headed Mynah ( Sturnia
pagodarum). Orioles of two kinds (O. melatiocephalus and O. kundoo) are to
be seen. "The two species," Mr. Dalgliesh tells us, "build beautiful
hammock-shaped nests, suspended, as a rule, between two branches."
The Crimson-breasted Barbet ( Xantholcema fuemacephala) has a monotonous
note which resembles the sound of someone beating a copper, hence it is
known amongst Anglo-Indians as the " Coppersmith."
The Hawk Cuckoo ( Megalcema caniceps ), an exceedingly common
bird about Bengal, is known as the " brain-fever bird," from its note,
which is supposed to resemble the word "brain-fever." The Indian Koel
(Eudynamys honorata), another bird of the Cuckoo tribe, lays its eggs in
the nest of the House Crow.
A colony of Spotted Owlets ( Athene bratna) haunt the garden of which
Mr. Dalgliesh writes, and one of these birds, which had a nest near, took a
violent dislike to the owner of the house, and would swoop down at him if
he went anywhere near the nest, and on one occasion actually took off his
cap. _
Two species of Bulbuls, the Red-vented and Red-eared, and the
Magpie Robin, better known to aviculturists as the Dhyal Bird, have been
noticed in the garden.
The Purple Sunbird (Cinnyris asiatica ), the Indian Roller (Coracias
indica), the Indian Nightjar ( Capritnulgus asiaticus), a Fruit Pigeon ( Croc opus
phcenicopterns), and three species of Turtle Doves, are also frequent visitors
to the garden, as is also the Black Drongo, or King Crow (Buchanga atra).
This latter is one of the most quarrelsome of birds, and always ready to
fight when opportunity occurs. When the fruit is ripe both the Rose-
winged and Blossom-headed Parrakeets arrive to take toll. Hoopoes, both
of the common and Indian species, are of frequent occurrence; and the
White-breasted Waterhen (Amaurornispkcenicura) is met with on the ponds,
or, in the early mornings, searching for worms in the vegetable gardens.

Sir. -- I should be verj&amp;apos; glad if you can tell me if a Pennant (hen),
which I have in my aviary, is a freak or a distinct species.
I purchased several young birds (imported) out of colour last autumn,
and when the others came into colour, this particular bird turned a pale
canary yellow, but with the blue tail, wings, and face of the ordinary Pennant.
Where the other birds were a deep rich crimson, this bird is pale yellow.
She is rather smaller than the other Pennants, and is, I think, now nesting,
having paired with a Pennant.
I was much interested to read the account of the unusual colouring
of a Pennant in the last number of the Avicultural Magazine.
Marion Johnstone.
The following reply was sent to Mrs. Johnstone :
Without seeing your bird, it is not very easy to say what it is. It
sounds like the Mealy Rosella or the Yellow-rumped. If you have
" Parrots in Captivity " a reference to the plates of these two, would tell
you, if that is so. F. G. Dutton.

In a letter to Mr. Phillipps, dated May 12th, Mr. Clias. Cushny quotes,
various items from a Review of Audubon's ' Birds of America.' Mr. Cushny
says -- "Amongst other things he mentions that the White - crowned
Sparrow of Labrador has a most melodious note ; which rather surprised
me, as I thought that none of the Sparrows were very good songsters.
" He also speaks of a Rose-breasted bird which sings at night. Can
it be the Virginian Nightingale?"
Not having Audubon&amp;apos;s book by me, I cannot say whether the White-
crowned Sparrow is a species of Passer, but I should think it more likely to
be one of the Song-Sparrows. The Rose-breasted Grosbeak is a well-known,
though rarely imported, cage-bird; and far more beautiful in colouring than
the Virginian Cardinal: its voice is said to be full and powerful as that of a
Thrush. A. G. Butter.
THE WOOD WARBLER, OR WOOD WREN.
Sir, -- I am sending you the body of a little bird, which I should be
very much obliged if you would kindly identify. Yesterday afternoon
(May 19) two birds flew with great force against the window ; one of them
fell to the ground; and, after a few convulsive movements, his pretty
bright eyes closed for ever. The other remained standing on the window-
sill, apparently stunned, for some time, -- but at last he flew away. The two
were exactly alike. The only bird-book our friends here (Montgomery-
shire) have, gives no information or description of these pretty birds, and I
should so like to know what they are. The shape and attitude when living
are very like that of a Siskin, but the colouring is very different.

The following reply was sent to Mrs. Rotcli :
The exquisite little bird which you forwarded to me is the Wood
Warbler, or Wood Wren as it is often called, Fhylloscopus sibilatrix, one of
our regular summer visitors, arriving about the end of April and departing
in September. It is a charming little bird, keeps a good deal to the woods,
and builds large semi-domed grass nests on or very near the ground, often
cleverly concealed. It is the larger of three allied species which visit us
ever}&amp;apos; summer, the other two being the Willow Warbler (or Willow Wren),
and the familiar Chiffchaff. Doubtless this was a case of an nnmated male
approaching too near to the female or nesting-site of a more fortunate
rival, who gave chase with murderous intentions.
Reginald Phillipps.
THE PARSON FINCH.
Sir, --I enclose a rough water-colour sketch of two small birds; one
died, but the other I still have. They were bought in Malta, and sent to
me about eighteen months ago. Will you kindly tell me if they are
Weaver Finches, and where their native home is; also if they are
common, and if it would be likely I could easily get a mate in England for
the one I have left. I keep it in a cage in the sitting-room ; although I
have an outdoor aviary, I have never liked to put them there, knowing so
little about them. As far as I could tell, they were both alike in plumage ;
the bird I have still sings seven or eight sweet notes constantly, so I conclude
it is the male ? I will feel much obliged for any information about these
birds. M. H. Woods.
The following reply was sent to Miss Woods :
The sketch which accompanied your letter enables me to see at a
glance that your bird is the Parson Finch (Poephila cincta); and, as it sings,
it is almost certainly a male. It is common in some parts of Australia,
where it is usually known as the Black-throated Grassfinch. It is not a
Weaver, although it builds large bulky, covered nests, laying white eggs.
From time to time, large numbers reach this country ; but many die soon
after arrival, through not being kept warm enough. When acclimatized,
they are fairly hardy, but not so hardy as is usually represented. When
not over exposed, they will live for many years. During the summer, they
do very much better in a moderately protected outdoor aviary than in a
cage in the house. Like Australian birds generally, they want to nest
during our cold season. It is a mistake to permit this. Do not allow them
to nest until about the middle of May ; place a few covered nest-boxes
about, in sheltered private places, give them plenty of hay, dried grasses,
and a few small feathers, and pretend not to see or know anything about
the nest, and they will breed fairly freely. The chief points in my opinion
are -- not to let them nest during the winter (if necessary, separate the
birds), and not to go near the nest. The more it is hidden away the better.
But I am premature. You can certainly obtain a female Parson
Finch, but you may have to wait, which is unfortunate, as a new bird
ought not to be allowed to nest until quite strong. It is difficult to
distinguish the sexes, often very difficult. The song is the best sign of
distinction, but birds will not sing to order. Sometimes the black throat-
patch is distinctly larger in the male; and usually lie is a more perky,

NOTES ON THE RED-BACKED SHRIKE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999442388888889" page_id="10104255"  page_num="206" year="" vol="">
Sir, --On May 3rd, 1900, I saw a cock Red-backed Shrike, for the first
time, flying about, and resting for a time upon one of the oak trees wdiich
were growing upon the bank of a circular pond, about forty feet in
diameter, in the middle of a large grass field, near Uckfield, Sussex. This
bird came very close to me, flying from branch to branch uttering a very
harsh note. I thought I must be very close to the nest, but I was not.
On the 5th, I saw both birds and followed them into an orchard and
back again to the pond. They flew very quickly, and in a kind of cork-
screw way, showing their dark back and light underparts alternately.
On the 8th, I found the nest, in a large V-shaped patch of bramble
growing upon the sloping bank of the pond. The nest was about three feet
from the ground and about a foot from the top of the brambles, in rather
an exposed position, and could be seen quite easily without disturbing
anything. It was made of bents, lined with moss, with an inner lining of
red cow-liair, from one of the cows in the same field, which had been
scraping off her winter coat on to one of the oaks close by.
On the 13th, there were three eggs in the nest, of the greenish type.
On the 14th, I saw the hen on the nest at 5 p.111. Is not this rather an unusual
time for birds to lay ?
On May 29th, there were six eggs in the nest, the hen must have been
sitting by then. This was the only time I had found her off the nest since
the 14th. O11 the 8th of June, the young Shrikes were fledged. They were
all coloured alike. By the 12th they had left the nest, which contained an
unbroken addled egg. By the behaviour of the parent birds the young
were evidently close by the nest, but I could not find them anywhere.
The T4U1 of June was the last day on which I saw the Shrikes.
These birds had a very peculiar habit of raising their tails up and
bending them down, and sometimes they twisted them round, describing a
large circle with the tip, while they were perching upon a branch. Before
the hen began to sit, I often found them perching upon the same tree, but
only occasionally taking any notice of each other : they were apparently
watching for food. The cock I saw three times come and flutter about the
hen, and they seemed to kiss each other, on the tips of their beaks. When
the hen was sitting in the nest (in which she looked very much like a small
Song-Thrush) the cock was always somewhere about and behaved very
much like a Spotted Flycatcher, sitting on a branch or fence-rail, and

suddenly darting off to catch some insect, but always alighting on the
ground, pulling up suddenly with outspread tail, and sometimes returning
to the same spot.
The birds always became very excited when I came near, and began
calling out whenever I came into the field, sometimes beginning when I
was about a hundred yards off. The hen was by far the bolder of the two,
calling out loudly and defiantly and coming within a yard or two of me :
the cock preferred to keep from six to eight yards off. I have seen these
birds again this and last year, but have not seen their nest. These notes
were taken at the time of the occurrence. H. L. Sich.
THE BLUE MOUNTAIN LORIKEET.
Sir,--A s one who has kept the Blue Mountain four years, may I
venture to give my experience ?
(a) . In my judgment they want no heat. They are as hard as nails,
and mine were out of doors winter and summer.
(b) . Never give them any slops, as suggested last month. I believe
that it is the ' slops' that kill them. Notice how bad and soft in feather
they are at the Zoo, where they are fed, poor beggars, on bread and milk !
If fed on canary-seed, and given half an apple per diem, with water to
drink, the)&amp;apos; will live for years. Mine never had a fit, and I attribute it
solely to natural feeding ; and I had them four years.
(c) . They are very spiteful birds, and will brook no rivals in their
enclosure.
fd). They are very shy and difficult breeders.
(e). The male has a more cruel looking head than the hen, and is a
bigger and brighter coloured bird altogether. If a true pair they will
be always together and feeding each other. C. D. Farrar.
[Does Mr. Farrar seriously mean to tell us that to feed Brush-tongues
on a diet of dry canary-seed and fruit is " natural feeding ? " We much
doubt whether dry seed is ever eaten by Lorikeets in a wild state. The
addition of milk-sop , properly prepared, has been proved by many experienced
aviculturists to be well nigh indispensible to Lorikeets, and, although the
comparatively hardy " Blue Mountain " may live for years, as indeed Mr.
Farrar's have done, on a diet of dry seed and fruit, the more delicate and
rare species would, in all probability, succumb to such treatment within
a few months. Ripe fruit is absolutely essential to the Brush-tongued
Parrots, which will sometimes live on this alone for a time, and we strongly
suspect that the apple that Mr. Farrar gave his birds each day kept them
alive and well, and that very little canary-seed was eaten. Such active
birds as Lorikeets are hardly likely to keep in good feather in the small
Zoo. cages; nevertheless their food in the Parrot-house agrees with them
so well that they often live there for a number of years.--E d.]
[Mr. Farrar has missed my point. I wrote of warmth in connection
with the breeding of the species. I have kept a good many Lorikeets,
including the Blue Mountain, and, so far as my experience goes, female
Lorikeets usually seem to find that our climate, taken au naturel, is too cold
for egg production. Perhaps, if Mr. Farrar were to try a little heat, he

might find that, even with him, Blue Mountains were not " very shy and
difficult breeders."
The length of time that some of the Lorikeets have lived at the Zoo.
is remarkable.-- Reginald Phielipps.]
Sir, -- I have had a pair of these beautiful birds for nearly three years,
and have never detected the slightest difference in appearance, except that
the blue lacing on the edges of the orange-red breast feathers is a trifle
more pronounced and the green collar rather yellower in one. I have no
guarantee that they are a true pair, except that they often break off feeding
to kiss and croon to each other: that is, they link their coral beaks together
and talk in a gentle rasping tone, which is no doubt melodious to them but
sounds to me as if they wanted their larynxes oiling.
Circumstances compelled me to keep them the first eighteen months
in a i4in. round parrot cage, and since then they have been in a i6in.
square cage : someday they hope to be in an aviary. I am doubtful whether
two of one sex would have agreed together so long in such quarters.
They are delightfully healthy and hardy. When they were in the
small cage I used to put it once a week in the bath, and pour several gallons
of cold water from the tap on to them, or half fill the bath and roll the
cage in it until they were drenched to the skin. Now there is room to get
a deep porcelain dish in the cage, through which they slide their bodies
time after time in a most comical manner, until they have emptied every
drop of water and splashed it all over the floor.
When I first bought them the dealer of course told me to feed them
on hempseed with a little canary. I am glad I took Mr. Fillmer's advice
and removed the hemp, leaving the canary, but making the staple food of
biscuit soaked in hot milk. Every morning at breakfast I put a potted-
meat pot on the trivet with six to seven teaspoonfuls of milk in. By the
time breakfast is over, this is hot enough to have scummed over and will
not turn sour in summer. Then I add three teaspoonfuls of a mixture of
thin arrowroot and milk biscuits crushed to a powder, and a quarter to a
third of an average banana mashed up with it. This, with six spoonfuls of
canary seed in the seed tin, keeps them robust and flourishing all the year
round. The only change I have ever made has been to substitute
stewed apple when I have run short of banana, or go without altogether
occasionally.
I sometimes put coarse sea-sand into a tin, but they only amuse
themselves by transporting it grain by grain into the water bottle or food
pot. I often sprinkle powdered cuttle-fish bone into the soft food to supply
lime. Pine sawdust in the tray, and willow branches to peel (they have
already craned their necks through and peeled the wall-paper oft).
I am not given to exhibiting, but sent the pair, last October, to the
Leeds big exhibition, and was quite surprised to receive 2nd prize for large
foreigners: the ist going to a Giant Macaw exhibited by Mr. Osbaldeston,
who wrote about the Swainson's Lorikeet in the June number.

Russ' Weaver. (Mr. R. Phillipps). In owner's possession three years;
quite well until three weeks before it died; it became less lively and
sometimes puffy. [Congestion of the lungs was the cause of death ; it
also had fatty degeneration of the liver].
Young Budgerigar. (Mr. C. P. Arthur). Just left nest. [Death was due
to pressure on the brain, resulting from extensive extravasation of
blood over left side of head, caused by an injury].
WHITE Ibis. (Lady Sutton). .Seemed in usual health when fed in morning,
but was found dead in the afternoon. [Death was caused by external
violence, there being extensive extravasations of blood over the region
of the abdomen, neck, and head].
Cordon Bleu. (Honble. T,illa de Yarburgh Bateson). [Immediate
cause of death was congestion of the lungs. Inability to reproduce
feathers on the head was doubtless due to constitutional debility. The
deformity of the beak was caused by an injury at the base, which
prevented the normal production of bone-structure].

The Fine Broadtail, which forms the subject of our illus-
tration this month, inhabits the North of Australia, from Port
Darwin to Port Essington. Gould writes:--"This is a very
abundant species on the Northern and North-Western coasts of
Australia, where it inhabits grassy meadow-like land and the
edges of swamps, and mostly feeds upon the seeds of grasses
and other plants, sometimes it is seen in pairs, but more fre-
quently in families of from ten to twenty in number. It fre-
quently utters a rapid succession of double notes resembling
' trin-se trin-se Its flight is low, somewhat rapid and zigzag,
seldom farther prolonged than from tree to tree."
The first living specimens of Brown's Parrakeet I ever saw,
were a pair exhibited at a bird-show at Balham, on the 7th of
November, 1899, and these were probably the first living speci-
mens seen in England. Soon after this two pairs were deposited
at the London Zoological Gardens by the Honble. Walter Roths-
child. At the present time there are perhaps half a dozen pairs
in the country.
Mr. Goodchild's excellent drawing renders a description
of the colours unnecessary, but I may remark that individuals
differ greatly in markings. One specimen figured by Gould, has
a considerable amount of red on the head, and some examples
have many of the feathers of the breast and back washed with
blue. According to Gould the young are similar to the adults,
but all the markings are dull and indistinct.
Mr. Campbell tells 11s that the nest and eggs are, as yet,
undescribed ; but there is little doubt that the nesting arrange-
ments of this species do not differ from those of the other
members of the genus, which it resembles very closely in every-
thing but its colours.

I have not found this species delicate, although it inhabits
a hot region. My pair were kept indoors during the winter
months, but were transferred to an outdoor aviary in May, where
they did not seem to feel at all discomforted by the December-
like weather which prevailed during a great part of that month.
They are lively and engaging birds, and at times whistle
very prettily. The cock is, I regret to say, occasionally, a little
troublesome with the other birds; he has up to the present
committed four murders,--a Chinese Quail, a Red-backed Bunt-
ing, a Zebra-finch, and a Budgerigar. I have often seen the
pair examining nest boxes, but they have not, as yet, decided
upon one for a future brood.
Canary, millet, hemp, oats, sunflower, and such like seeds
form the staple food of my ' Browns.' They are not especially
fond of fruit, except grapes, of which they ate a number in the
winter, when green food was scarce. Their favourite green food
seems to be chickweed, a bundle of which is now supplied to
them every day.
Although not so brilliantly clad as some of the Platycerci ,
I consider the "Smutty Parrakeet,' as the Colonists call it, one
of the most beautiful of the genus; a genus which, I must say, I
am very fond of, in spite of the fact that some writers have called
them 'uninteresting' and 'unintelligent.'

By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
I hardly like to remember now how many years it is since
I possessed my first Many-Colours. I remember distinctly the
first time I ever saw any alive. It was at a shop in the West
End ; and by their sick and sorry look they reminded me at once
of the chant of the Roman gladiators, " Ave, Csesar, morituri
te salutant." As, I believe, the price asked was #\o, I did not
invest in them, but I fell desperately in love with them. It was
a genuine case of love at first sight, and I made up my mind, if
I could ever afford it, to get a pair.
Many-Colours are very hard to get and still harder to keep.
Only a very few come over every year, and these are eagerly
snapped up by rich people at prohibitive prices.
The first time I had a chance of any was about five years
since. A friend who used to go to Sydney wrote to me from
Port Said that he w r as bringing over six Many-Colours: four

hens and two cocks. Would I like them ? I wrote a big " Yes,"
and anxiously awaited the next news. Alas ! it was sad when it
came. The cock Many-Colours had all died in the Mediterranean.
Would I have the hens. I said I would. One morning they
arrived quite safely. For weeks I kept them indoors, and as the
weather got warm (it was Xmas when they landed) I put them
out of doors. How I used to watch them ; how I hoped against
hope that one might develop into a cock. I thought it had a
rather masculine head and a rather brighter shoulder patch, and
--I wanted it to be a cock so badly , but it was no good ; they all
remained of the feminine gender. Of the four, two, alas, died.
Some disease of the throat carried them off. If you see a Many-
Colour with an apparent difficulty in swallowing, make up your
mind to lose him.
Where was I to get a cock from. I wrote to my friend Mr.
Savage, but he could not help me. " Many-Colours are," he wrote,
"as scarce here as in England. I have not seen any offered for
years." Then I wrote to Mr. Pekholtz. Could he help me ? No !
But lie gave me the address of a German dealer who sometimes
had Many-Colours. I wrote off; and after a time got the offer of a
cock at a very great price. They say " a fool and his money are
soon parted ; " they were in this case. I sent off the money
and the Many-Colour arrived. He " had been " a good one,
but was so no longer. Moreover, he had that horrid difficulty in
swallowing. I tried to think he was healthy, that it was only the
infirmity of a noble mind, but in my heart I knew better, and I
felt that the days of mourning were at hand. They were. He
lingered about a fortnight, and then I had a lovely corpse!
Months now passed away, and there was no sign of a Many-
Colour anywhere.
One morning I got a post card from the celebrated J. D. H. :
"Am sending you two cock Many-Colours." How my heart
went pit-a-pat. Alas! when the} 7 came, and I opened the cage,
one was quite dead. He was such a beauty too. The} 7 had
arrived by the last train at night, and were not delivered till the
next morning. The other, I was delighted to see, was equally good
as his dead brother, and seemed all right after a rest and some
needful refreshment.
For a long time I kept him in a cage, as I did not dare to
trust his precious life to our abominable climate. The two hens
wintered out of doors, in separate compartments, as the} 7 did not
seem very amiable. As the spring advanced last year, I suddenly
missed the younger hen. I feared she was dead, or had got out

<bodyText confidence="0.998714604651163" page_id="10104265"  page_num="214" year="" vol="">
of the aviary somehow. What was my delight and astonishment,
after a long and careful search, to find her sitting hard on four
eggs. She was sitting so close that she even allowed me to pull
her off the eggs. (What a treasure this bird would be to some
of our members, tame and warranted to like being taken on and
off her eggs). She sat steadily, but, of course, with no result.
Just as she had done sitting I got the cock. Too late of course,
and a season gone.
Any intelligent man will understand that it was a situation
calculated to amuse the ungodly, but without any real fun in it.
I know I felt as melancholy as if I had been editing a comic
paper, but there are limits even to depression, and after the most
awful fit there surely comes the rebound, as certainly as day
follows night.
However, as the season advanced, I put out the cock with
the old hen, as she had not nested, thinking she was the most
likely of the two to do so. With the perversity of the male
creature, the cock did not approve of my selection. You re-
member that when Alcides, having gone through all the fatigues
of life, took a bride in Olyunpus, he ought to have selected
Minerva, but he chose Hebe. So did my cock Many-Colour.
He evidently, like Jacob, preferred Rachel to Leah. He was
always seductively whistling through the wires and making love
to the younger and fairer lady ; and so, at last, I had to let
nature have her way, and transferred Leah from his side and
substituted Rachel. Leah did not take at all kindly to the
arrangement, and but for the dividing wires I would not have
been answerable for the consequences, as the police say'.
Nothing further happened last year in the way of breeding,
but the happy pair passed all the winter out of doors in the most
perfect health and contentment.
The Many-Colour, I may say in passing, is a very frugal
liver, and a plain and simple diet suits him admirably. All that
mine have in the way of food is Indian millet, canary seed, and
soft food mixture if they care to take it.
Many - Colours may be safely trusted with the tiniest
finches. This year's breeding operations commenced very early.
It must have been early in February (bitter cold weather) that
the lieu disappeared into a log. I feared the result--unfertile
eggs. It proved I was right, for when she gave over sitting I
found five clear eggs in the nest.
After a very few days, my experienced eye saw that a
second batch of eggs was in preparation. Soon Mrs. Many-
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.997856186046512" page_id="10104266"  page_num="215" year="" vol="">
Colour disappeared once more, and hope and expectation ran
high over again ; and again she left her lord and master " alone
in his glory."
How long and weary the weeks of waiting seemed. At
last one day, I fancied I heard the well-known noise that young
Parrakeets make, which once heard is never forgotten. It was
days before I heard that sound again. You may listen for hours
and you will hear nothing. The old birds signal the youngsters
to shut up if anyone is about. If you hear them it is only by
accident.
One day I saw the cock slinking out of the nest in a most
apologetic way. I wondered what he had been in for, as when
the hen wants feeding, she always conies oft to be fed. I hoped
that he had gone to feed his family. Later on I found out that
he had. The moment I suspected youngsters I gave green meat
ad libitum. During early days the young are fed on little else
and egg food.
How can you tell when there are young ones about ? Some
people say, " Go and look in the nest." Wisdom says, "Do
nothing of the sort. Watch for signs."
When you see a cock Many-Colour, or for that matter any
other Parrakeet, eating all day long against time, or as if there
was no hereafter, you may be certain of one of two things. He is
going to die, or he has a family to provide for. As my cock
looked the picture of health, I took the latter view.
This is not intuitive wisdom, but gathered slowly and
painfully among the thorns of experience. My duties now
blossomed forth like Aaron's rod, and I became in turn feeder,
watcher, and general supervisor.
For weeks I literally lived on thorns. Was all my labour
for nought! Should I just take one little peep, like Bluebeard's
wife? Curiosity said "Yes." Prudence whispered "No."
Prudence won the day.
One morning in June, as I entered the aviary at 8 a.m.
there was a rustling demonstration of surprise, such as you may
have observed in a country congregation, when they hear an
allusion to their week-day sins from the pulpit. Mr. and Mrs.
Many-Colour were running about and calling to each other in
the most frantic and excited state of mind, and I was not long in
perceiving that the cause of all this parental joy and fussiness
was the advent of a beautiful Many-Colour. I never saw a
youngster that could fly so swiftly and well from the first.
Many young Parrakeets go back to sleep in the nest for

<bodyText confidence="0.995443585365853" page_id="10104267"  page_num="216" year="" vol="">
quite a long time. This one never did. The reason may have
been that the hen went to nest again about a week before it
came out, and she is now sitting steadily on a third batch. In
the second batch there were three eggs--two clear and one
youngster. The young one is a hen.
When I went into the house and told what I had found,
neither Demosthenes, nor a Nationalist Member at a Cork
Election could have been listened to with more gratifying
attention.
Mr. Many-Colour is left in sole charge, but the youngster is
quite able to scrape for itself now, and is highly proud of itself
as the first Many-Colour ever born in the British isles. As I
look at her, I lift my hat reverently and whisper, Laudate. I feel
almost like Jeremy Taylor's widow--that I may now almost sit
in a clean apron, and my hands folded, and my work done.
I hope my readers will all go and endeavour to follow my
good example. All that you require, as I saw in the Feathered
World last week, is a pair of Many-Colours, a small barrel on
end, a large garden aviary, and--that was all ! I fancy my
readers will say there is something else.
As I have seen several sneering remarks of late that my
success is due to my immense aviaries, I should like to say that
I have none. The aviary in which the Many-Colours bred is
about six feet square.
I have just (July ist) been looking at the young Many-
Colour. She is about three quarters of the size of the parents.
Beak, flesh colour ; eye, black ; the red mark on the head very
faint and indistinct at present; the breast, pale mauvish green,
verging into yellow green below ; the breast crossed with tiny
lines; flights, dark blue; the shoulder has the pale red patch ;
under tail blue. This is only a rough description, as it is difficult
to describe shades of colour in words.
THE ST. HELENA SEED-EATER.
(,Serimis flavivcjitris&amp;apos;).
By W. Geo. Creswele, M.D.
With all my love of birds it has unfortunately happened
that I have never had access to good or rather to full books on my
favourite hobby, and that, therefore, much that I know has had to
be ground up, by slow degrees, so to speak, from a mixture of
practical knowledge and stray bits of information. The hope,
therefore, that I may be of some help to those situated like

myself must be taken as my excuse for much of what will perhaps
appear to be too elementary in the following lines.
The Serin under consideration, like many another bird,
has by no means always been constant in its name, either
scientific or trivial. I have identified it in the Natural History
Museum under the title of Yellow-browed Seed-Eater, or Crithagra,
Jlaviventris, of which the English name seems to be on every
hand much more scientific than the one generally adopted;
dealers have sold it to me as a Cape Canary ; and I have
purchased it from a gentleman who brought it from Vryburg
and who knew it only by its local name of Scasie or Scasies.
Dr. Butler, in his valuable paper on South African Cage-birds,
speaks of it as the Kleine Seisje ;--may it be that Scasie is the
phonetic rendering of the latter ?
The size of the bird is a trifle in excess of that of our
Einnet, to which the hen has some resemblance at a little
distance. In build it is stout and in its lines not too graceful.
The beak is short and thick, and when open the edges are seen
to curve slightly downwards, as also does the culmen or upper
ridge of the upper mandible, which latter is dark while the
lower one is horn-coloured.
The crown of the head, nape, and back are green, with
dark pencillings. A pronounced yellow stripe crosses the fore-
head and is continued over the eyes. The chin, breast, and
under parts are yellow with a green tinge in it, especially an
ill-defined patch in the middle of the breast which shows up as
almost distinctly green. From the base of the lower mandible
there runs obliquely downwards and backwards a dark green
moustache mark. The wing coverts are green--the secondaries
black with pale greenish grey outer edge. The primaries are the
same except that the edging is narrower. The tail feathers are
the same colour as the primaries, with the upper coverts green
and the lower ones yellow.
The female is slightly smaller and much more sombre in
colour. Her upper parts are dark grey with a decided green
tinge in it and pencilled in a darker shade. The breast and
underparts are greyish--somewhat indistinctly pencilled and
showing no indication of yellow whatever. A darker shade
shows up an attempt at moustache marking, and an eye mark can
be detected in some lights.
There would seem to be a considerable amount of difference
between individual specimens of this bird. For instance, the
one from Vryburg is larger and has the eyebrow and forehead
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999778511627907" page_id="10104269"  page_num="218" year="" vol="">
stripe wider than seems usual. In addition to this the upper
parts are darker as to the green, while below the yellow is deep
and bright, the diffused green tinge in the centre of the breast
being entirely absent. His hen, while a complete replica of the
others as to shape and markings, was brown rather than green in
the general colour, this brown becoming almost ruddy brown
about the head, throat, and underparts. She was also white-
legged, but this may perhaps be accounted for by their having
been house-moulted in a small cage. Still, in spite of this,
the cock's feet and toes were black. Since this Serin is
universally found over the whole of the Cape Peninsular and
from there to the British Protectorate, the slight variations in
colour may be due to local environment.
Both sexes of this species (but especially the malej
have a queer way of flicking or flirting the tail up and down, the
down stroke being rather accentuated ; while the cock, when
excited, has the most extraordinary trick of humping himself up
and elevating one or other side of the body in the funniest
possible manner. As may be imagined, a gentleman who so
comports himself is not too amiable towards his wife or any other
bird, but a Green Singing Finch may be relied on with every
confidence to bring him to a more humble bearing. As far as I
can judge from the specimens I have had, these birds are easily
tamed and become very steady. One cock that I kept indoors for
a time would sing anywhere the cage was put and has trolled
forth many a stave on my dinner table by gaslight and within a
couple of feet of myself. The song is clear, well sustained,
powerful, and yet sweet and quite free from any shrill and
ear-piercing notes.
Altogether I have had three pairs of these birds, and
although they have been out in aviaries I have never seen the
slightest attempt at building. One hen, however, is most
friendly towards any young birds that may be about, and is
apparently never so happy as when she is feeding them. She
even fed a hen Sulphur Seed-eater that was not well, and it was
quite pretty to see her stand close up to the poor thing that
had its head tucked under the wing and presently gently
pluck it by the shoulder to wake it up and then proceed to feed
it. She would then turn round to be fed herself by her
Platonic lover, an English Linnet, to whom she has been warmly
attached all the spring and summer.
I have said that the cock is a more than pleasing singer,
but that only applies to indoor cage life. In an outdoor aviary

with other birds I have seldom heard or seen one sing, although in
the absence of a male bird I have heard the hen give out a
distinctly pleasant though low-toned imitation of her lord and
master.
I wish these birds were more freely imported.

NOTES ON DOVES.

By Rosie Aederson.
Foreign Doves and Pigeons have always had a great
fascination for me. In several ways they have advantages over
other species of birds. Most doves are hardy (at least the
larger kinds), healthy and long-lived. They are easy to keep,
and many kinds will breed freely in confinement. Doves seem to
adapt themselves to captivity more easily than many other birds,
and though Doves and Pigeons are but soberly plumaged com-
pared to the gorgeous colouring of the Parrakeets, yet the
beautiful blending of their quiet tints is very restful to the eye.
I have kept Doves now for nearly four years. At the
present time I have eighteen varieties; and in these few notes I
purpose to first tell you how I keep them, and then give a short
account of each kind of bird. It may be useful, too, to give
about the value of the different Doves, not as a strict guide, but
only to give some idea of their worth to any member who may
be thinking of getting the same varieties.
To begin with, I keep all my larger Doves in outdoor
aviaries all the year round, exceptions only being made if a bird
is getting old and feeble, or if it is purchased newly-imported in
winter. In the latter case I should probably keep it in my heated
aviary until the spring. My outdoor aviaries, of course, have
shelters provided, but I find the birds use them very little,
preferring to sleep in the fir branches outside in the flights.
Fortunately I live in a well-wooded county where there is no
difficulty in getting a load of fir branches--the price being io/-
for a large load, including cartage. The most durable kind
is that known as the Scotch fir. The " needles" stay on for a
long time, and do not fall off nearly so quickly as in the case of
some of the other varieties of fir. This is a very great advantage
as the thickness of the boughs affords protection from the cold
in winter, and privacy during the nesting season. My bird man,
George Hallarn, is very skilful at fastening up these branches on
the walls of the aviaries, by means of driving in a long nail and
lashing the boughs to it with wire. Of course all ends of the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995845" page_id="10104271"  page_num="220" year="" vol="">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999483953488372" page_id="10104271"  page_num="220" year="" vol="">
wire must be turned in so as not to injure the birds in anyway.
The branches are usually renewed twice a year, in spring and
autumn, and are wired several feet clear of the ground. Some-
times, if heavy, they require wiring in one or two places. By
keeping the boughs well off the ground it gives more floor room,
and also hinders mice from easily running up them.
I find, too, that Doves usually prefer to nest high up, often
almost close to the roof. The branches should not be all fastened
in the same place, but in different parts of the aviary, and I
always help and arrange with the fixing of them myself.
Doves are strange birds, and you will find many of them
have one special bough for roosting on, and if another bird comes
near it quarrelling will ensue, so it is best to put the branches in
different corners. Doves are noted for their fragile nests, some
of them so frail that the eggs can be plainly seen through the
bottom, and it is a wonder the structure holds together. Some
few years ago I learnt wicker basket making, and I have found
it come in most usefully in making shallow nest-holders (shaped
like a large saucer) for my Doves to build in. These baskets are
easily fixed to the branches by passing string through the wicker
in several places, and I find the birds appreciate these nests
very much, and seldom build except in one of them. After the
nesting season is over the baskets are taken down and well
washed, and put away until required again. With care they will
last for years. Doves delight in a particular kind of dead
heather to build their nests with, and every year I get several
bundles in good time for the nesting season, from a lad named
Hiscock, of Ashley, Ringwood, Hants. The heather should be
separated before being given to the birds, care being taken that
the pieces are not too long.
It is very pretty to watch the cock Dove carrying up the
heather, whilst his lady 7 sits proudly in the nest, and tucks each
piece in as he brings it. He is very critical, and it is
amusing to see how he will pick up bits of heather and then
toss them aside again and again until he finds a piece that
pleases him. Both birds look so happy and important, as if for
the time being they had quite forgotten their liberty and their
home across the sea. The amount of heather a single pair of
birds will use for their nest is really astonishing. In keeping
Doves, as indeed with any other bird, if you want to succeed you
must study their little way&amp;apos;s, however eccentric they may seem,
or you cannot hope for good results. I have found it a good
plan to observe which is your pair of birds' favourite bough ;
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998657" page_id="10104272"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">

<bodyText confidence="0.998972279069767" page_id="10104272"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
there tie up your basket, aud then in all probability a nest will
be built in that particular spot almost at once. When your
birds begin to sit keep them as quiet as }&amp;apos;ou can. On no account
turn an}&amp;apos;- strange birds into the aviar\ r , nor attempt to catch an&amp;gt; r
of the others.
Doves are very nervous birds, and if one is frightened it
will infect all the rest, and there will be a general panic, and
\ T our nest will be probabl&amp;gt; T deserted, and it is very seldom a
Dove will return to a nest it has once left, unless it is very tame.
Two eggs are generally laid, and sitting lasts seventeen to
nineteen da}&amp;apos;s, in some cases possibly a little longer. The eggs
are pure white, aud of course var} r very much in size and shape.
When catching a bird, it is safer to use a trap cage, which can be
made at a small cost; but failing this if a bird is caught in the
hand it should be well grasped over the back, so as to keep
down the wings. If this is not done the}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; will probably be
injured and the bird be unable to ever fly again. Some time ago,
before my trap cage was made, I was moving a hen Crested
Dove to another aviar\ r . She was caught in the hand, and some-
how in catching her she hurt her wing. The cause must have
been ver\ r slight, for we had no idea she was injured in any way
until she was let loose in the other aviar}\ One wing has been
useless ever since ; it does not droop, but never fits quite closely to
the bod} r . The bird never looked ill, and has always kept
healthy. As she could not fly, I tied her a long bare bough placed
very slanting from the aviar}&amp;apos; floor to the fir branches above, as a
sort of ladder. The hen soon learnt to climb up into the boughs,
and had several }&amp;apos;oung ones in a nest quite high up. This plan
might be adopted, too, for birds that have lost their wing power
through age. All my large Doves have for their staple food a
mixture of wheat, dari, hemp, and a little rice. The smaller
Doves have canar\&amp;apos;, millet, etc. Both large and small are very
fond of crushed " broken biscuit " which may be had from a
grocer at 2d. or 3d. lb. I grind it into small pieces in one of
Spratt's biscuit crushers, (" The Enterprise,") and I think this
addition to their seed diet keeps the birds in good condition aud
their plumage ver\ r gloss}\ As well as biscuit the birds are, of
course, furnished with grit and ground cuttle fish bone. I had
some small tins made and two of these are hooked on nails in
each aviary a few inches from the ground, one tin being for
biscuit, the other for grit.
In my larger Doves' aviary the roof is of glass, and
stretched tightly across it (a few inches under the glass) is a

lining of canvas muslin (known as strainering). This is a great
protection to any bird that might fly suddenly upwards, and other-
wise injure its head. Cats and rats are great enemies to the
inmates of our aviaries. To keep the former from frightening
the birds at night, I have either a curtain of sheeting (run on a
wire with rings, and fastened tight with hooks and rings) or else
blinds that are let down at night. I think the former plan is
the best, as the curtain is simple to make and can be tied back
during the day. Besides keeping the birds quiet this serves as a
protection from the cold in the winter months. Before I adopted
this plan the cats used to frighten the Doves very much, though
they could not actually get at them to do any harm. The birds
would dash wildly about, and cut their wings against the wire
netting.
Rats are more difficult to deal with. It seems impossible
to be really free from them, as they will always find out where
there is grain. The aviary floor must have a good layer of
cement, or if this cannot be done it must at least be underlaid (if
the floor is of grass, wood, or earth) with fine wire netting.
Tiles are not as good as cement for a floor, as the rats can
burrow under a tile and cause it to sink. A rat can easily kill a
Pigeon, but oftener it seems to maim them. I have at present a
hen Bleeding-heart Dove that belongs to a friend. This bird at
some time or other has been nearly scalped by a rat (I believe
I was told the cock was killed outright), and the head has been
partly bare of feathers ever since. I remember when a child we
kept some Nun Pigeons. In those days my only idea of a bird was
how to love and pet it, not to study how to keep it properly. One
morning we found our poor Pigeons had had their claws bitten
clean off by a rat, but it had not injured them in any other way.
A few days later, to our great joy, the culprit was found fast in
the wire netting roof. It had got its head through and could not
get it out again. You may be sure it never had the chance of
harming our pets a second time. When you think what fearful
agonies the poor imprisoned birds must go through, with the
knowledge of an enemy from whom they cannot escape, surely
if alone on that account it is only right to thoroughly protect an
aviary from such vermin.
Next month I hope to describe shortly my different Doves.
The following are the kinds I have kept so far. Of the small

A TRIP TO AUSTRALIA.
By George Cakrick.
A short sketch of a trip to Australia and back with, I
might say, the birds of all nations, would make a most interest-
ing paper, if in the hands of one who could do justice to the
many little episodes met with. We left the Mersey last December,
with a very varied stock, including most of our British Finches
and a few soft-bills (among the latter a Yellow Wagtail, ist in its
class at the November Aquarium Show), Siberian Bullfinches
and Goldfinches--Bishops, Whydahs, Nonpareils, Cardinals,
Amazons, Macaws and Grey Parrots, and a few prize poultry,
Pigeons and Canaries, and one Diana Monkey ; supplementing
the collection at Madeira with a few Goldfinches, Mules, Conures,
and Peach-faced Love-birds. But the most interesting addition,
and one worthy of particular note, came on board of its own
sweet will, in the shape of a common Nightingale. I say
partiatlar note, because of our position at the time, viz., Lat.
39*03 S., Long. 26*46 F.--306 miles from the nearest land and
almost due South of Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Needless to
say he was immediately captured and caged, and with a plentiful
supply of mealworms he was soon quite at home and seemed
most thankful for the little kindness shown him, taking readily
to artificial food. He became very steady in a few days, and
ultimately shared the same home with the Yellow Wagtail in
Melbourne. I may here mention that I have visited Mr. Archie
Campbell, author of " Birds of Australia," who invariably looks
me up on arrival, and is always delighted with a view of my
collection of "the Old Country" birds. British birds stand the
variable changes of climate on the outward journey exceedingly
well; the same might be said of most of my outward stock,
with the exception of Grey Parrots. When we call at the
Canary Islands I always purchase my Greys there, and they
generally live well ; last voyage I purchased thirty-five at Las
Palmas and lost only one bird. When instead we call at Madeira,
where Greys are only to be purchased in units and always at high
prices, I procure them in Liverpool before leaving home, at
least, I have done so three times now, and each time with
disastrous results. The first time 30 Greys--30 deaths ; second

time 50 Greys--35 deaths; and on the voyage jnst completed 36
Greys--35 deaths ; the 36th bird and only survivor was one
purchased privately.
Australian birds as a rule take more readily to confine-
ment than Britishers, although there are a few which never seem
to take to it. The Many-coloured, Barnard's, Blue Bonnet,
Mealy Rosella and Crimson-wing Parrakeets are always hard to
cage off. Among the small fry the Crimson Finch stands out
pre-eminent, as a difficult subject, followed closely by the Sydney
Waxbill and Bicheno's Finch ; the latter at certain seasons only,
however ; at other times it lives splendidly, as was the case with
a lot I brought home last voyage; I had 264 on hand when
leaving Queensland, and lost 14 only. I fed them on Hungarian
millet and spray millet; they would never look at white millet or
canary seed. Hungarian millet I buy in Australia, and am
forwarding a sample to our Editor who may be able to ascertain
its proper name.
I am repeatedly asked to bring home rare Parrakeets, such
as Turquoisiues, Grass, Elegants, Paradise, etc., and, prior to
taking our departure each voyage, I write to all dealers of any
note to secure me such, but invariably with the same result ;
nearly all the rare birds come from far inland and from most
inaccessible spots ; consequently very few catchers venture so
far, or could even afford to do so. One enterprising party
springs up occasionally who has a good supply of real gems, but
it may be years before another will venture so far ; hence the
reason we see a quantity of rare birds in the market to- day, and
perhaps, years may intervene before they appear again. The
droughts often have a lot to do with the changing of breeding
grounds making migration compulsory.
The most desirable of the soft-bills are to be had in the
winter months, near the coast, but they seem to go inland
during the nesting season ; and it is hard to get them to England.
The great difficulty is the differences of season, and scarcity of
mealworms when the best soft-bills are obtainable. This last
voyage I took out witli me five quarts of mealworms, besides a
plentiful supply of egg-yolk and ants' cocoons (none of which
can be bought in Australia), and only secured a few Superb
Warblers (Malurus cyaneus ), one Whip Bird {Psophodes crepitans),
one Regent Bird (Sericulus melimis ) and a few common kinds.
Next voyage, leaving here at the beginning of July and return-
ing in December, I could secure no end of lovely soft-bills, but
one will easily see wherein lies the difficulty ; during these
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.995206604651163" page_id="10104276"  page_num="225" year="" vol="">
months mealworms are out of season, and without these it is
hopeless to keep insectivorous birds ou a sea voyage of such
duration.
I meant last voyage, to visit all the Australian Zoo-
logical Gardens, and thought to have some pleasant recol-
lections thereof. My first and last outing was at the Adelaide
Zoo, where I spent a " woefu'" half hour; the ground inside
all enclosures seemed very hard and thoroughly dried up;
and about one-third of the enclosures were empty. As for birds
they were few and far between, and all , without exception, in a
miserable state. I have often seen them better cared for in an
East-end dealer's shop.
One aviary contained about 30 of the Cockatoo family,
comprising Lemon-crested, Rose-breasted, Slenderbills, and
Leadbeaters ; another aviary contained a few Cockatiels,
Rosellas, Adelaide Parrakeets and Pennants ; another contained
three Blue and Yellow and one Red and Blue Macaws " all in a
row," depending one on the other for support on the perch, and
all in a half-nude state. The largest and most interesting aviary,
if one could centre a little interest in any of them, contained a
mixed collection of common Australian Finches and a few
Cardinals, with one or two Pectoral Rails and a few Plovers. Two
more aviaries, with fronts covered in, were shaped to imitate the
doors of a marquee drawn on one side, and the whole was painted
in a very inartistic way with broad bands of blue and white and
red and white, and contained a few Doves and Pigeons, and were
tenanted on the ground with an abundance of mice, which
seemed to attract more attention from visitors than the winged
inhabitants. A great deal of time and expense has apparently
been spent in trying to decorate the different houses outwardly:
for instance, a wooden house built to represent a cottage or villa,
and painted to imitate a brick erection with windows painted in
and curtains half drawn, and a miniature fence run round and
painted green--all seemed to be got up to please the juvenile eye.
I am sorry to have to write in such a deprecatory manner of a
spot where one would most expect to see the rarest of the rare
Parrakeets. After this experience I could not be tempted to
visit either the Melbourne or Sydney Zoos. I did visit the
Melbourne Zoo some three or four years ago, and it was then far
ahead of what Adelaide is now.
[We forwarded the sample of millet seed to Messrs. Sutton and Son,
of Reading, who very kindly inform us that the botanical name is Setaria
germanica --German, or Hungarian Millet.--E d.]

THE NESTING OF THE CAT-BIRD.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99935230952381" page_id="10104277"  page_num="226" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
For weeks I have been toiling like Cicero in his retirement
at Tusculum. The cause of my toil has been a pair of American
Cat-birds bent upon reproducing their kind. A wise man has
somewhere said "that if you want to know what a man is,
examine his castles in the air." Here is one of mine, to breed
the American Cat-bird.
Somewhere about the beginning of May my Cat-birds set
about founding a dynasty. I had kept them all the winter in my
bird room, intending, when what Fox once called " this little
shower" has stopped, to enlarge them out of doors. Apparently
they got tired of waiting for the improbable ; for one day when I
went up to feed them, I was surprised to find Mrs. Cat-bird trying
to build a nest with orange papers I had dropped on the floor
after feeding the Tanagers. A bird, I thought, that will do this
deserves encouragement. Accordingly I went out into the
garden and found a deserted Blackbird's nest. This I pulled to
pieces and scattered the fragments over the floor. The hint was
not thrown away and Mrs. Cat-bird at once set to work to
construct a really beautiful nest in a bush. Externally it is com-
posed of dead leaves and stalks of grass, and is smoothly lined
within with the finest fibres. The building operations occupied
about three days and then there was a solemn pause of expecta-
tion. About the fifth day, on looking casjcally into the nest, I
was delighted to see a beautiful blue egg almost exactly the
colour of that of our own English Hedge-Sparrow, only slightly
larger and rounder in shape.
Two more eggs were laid on successive mornings, making
a total of three in all, and then the hen sat steadily. A difficulty
now presented itself. I had a number of Buntings flying loose
in the room with the Cat-birds, and I knew that if they were
allowed to remain, they would eat a large share of the live bait
intended for the young Cat-birds in fore. This I naturally wished
to prevent. I saw therefore the only thing to do was to catch
up everything but the Cat-birds. This entailed a great risk, as
in catching the other birds I might frighten the Cat-birds ; but if
I left the other birds I should probably starve the young Cat-birds.
I remembered the old saying--of two evils choose the lesser. I
fetched the net and set to work catching. Incredible though it
may seem to my readers, the hen Cat-bird took no notice of all
the row (for you are bound to make a row, catch birds as deftly
as you like) but continued to sit steadily throughout the

performance. The cock did seem a bit scared and made himself
as small as he could up in a corner. Talking of the cock, I may
say in passing that he is, without exaggeration, one of the
sweetest and most refined singers I have ever heard. I far prefer
him to the Mocking-Bird, and I fancy that he can run our
English Nightingale very close. He sang most beautifully before
the nesting began, but has been silent since.
At the end of about twelve days, as far as I can judge, the
first egg hatched, followed by the others on the succeeding days.
The nestlings, on their arrival in this wicked world, were in a
state more approved of by Praxiteles than the general public
nowadays, for they were, as they say up here, " as naked as
Robins," and of a dull leaden colour.
For more than a week, to be exact, for ten days all went
well with the precious cargo. On the eleventh morning when I
entered the bird room there was a smell so high that it reminded
one of what John Leech once said anent another smell, "I
think that stench is strong enough to sketch." With deep
sadness I located the smell at the Cat-birds' nest. It made me
think of the young lady who once innocently asked her master
of Bach, "And pray, sir, what is Bach composing now?"
" Composing, madam," came the answer with a roar, " Bach is
not composing--he is decomposing "--so was my poor little Cat-
bird. It was a sad blow. I felt rather like the late Captain
Machell must have done, when the Duke of Hamilton knocked
him senseless in the third round, and then standing over him,
waited till he came to, and then asked him in the most casual
way when it would be convenient for him to rise? However, I
had to rise--and go on--I said to myself, spero infestis, go on
hoping in spite of ill luck ; you have two more arrows in your
quiver yet. Alas, the next day there was another death. All my
hopes were centered now on No. 3. For three days all seemed
to go well, and already I saw visions of a " Coronation " Medal ;
but it was not to be. When I went up to feed on Thursday
afternoon, June 12th, I found the tragedy was just completed.
Mrs. Cat-bird was off the nest, and when I looked within I saw
the poor little body--dead, but barely cold. Marius amid the
ruins of Carthage could not have worn a more tragic air than I
did when I picked up my poor little departed one. But then we
learn by suffering. Pathemata mathemata. I thought of what
Mark Tapley said to himself on a very similar occasion : " Now,
Mr. Tapley, things is looking about as bad as they can look,
young man. You'll not have such a opportunity for showing

<bodyText confidence="0.993141119047619" page_id="10104279"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
your jolly disposition, my fine fellow, as long as you live. And
therefore Tapley, now's your time to come out strong--or never."
Knowing that some people are very incredulous, like certain
old ladies we all know, that find it difficult to believe that the
train is going direct to the place appointed of Bradshaw, until
they have been verbally assured upon the point by two guards,
one porter, and a newspaper boy, I took the precaution to send
one of the little bodies to Mr. Phillipps to show that I was not
romancing. The little birds were getting into quill, colour
leaden, beak pinkish, feet flesh coloured and very big for the size
of the bird, head covered with a few scanty hairs, like some of us.
I am trying to bear my disappointment bravely, like the
Irishman who said that his pig had not weighed as much as he
expected, but then he never thought it would !
For those who do not know the Cat-bird, I may add that
it is about 9 inches long, clad in a lead-coloured suit, relieved by
a black cap on the top of the head, and with the feathers below
the tail rusty brown. The top of the tail, the bill and feet are
black in the cock, and the eyes black in both sexes. The hen is
much lighter on the b?east than the cock, has lighter coloured legs,
and lighter eyebrows ; and, whereas, the head of the cock is very
snakey, that of the hen is roundish.
When next I write on my Cat-birds, I hope to be able to
record an absolute success. We came very near it this time, and
neither men nor Cat-birds can do more than their best. Many
a deed is done, recorded only in that Book that holds the names
of those--men or animals, souls or no souls -- who Tried.
(To be continued).
[Mr. Farrar was manifestly on the high road to recording an absolute
success, for the young bird must have been hatched out strong and lusty,
and ought not to have died. If it was really some fourteen days old, as I
gather from Mr. Farrar's article, it was very backward, which would seem
to point to something wrong in the food or feeding; but Mr. Farrar does
not furnish any information as to the treatment. -- R.P.]
BIRD NOTES.
I11 the June number of the Zoologist, Mr. Robert Service draws
attention to a little-known, and apparently recently-acquired habit of the
Black-headed Gull, namely, that of capturing moths. He first watched
them do this in 1868, but the habit does not appear to have become common
until several years later. During the last dozen years the catching of
Lepidoptera, by the Gulls, after nightfall has become a confirmed annual
practice during the months of June and July. Mr. Service believes that

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99944387755102" page_id="10104280"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
the habit commenced with the capture of the ghost moth, but now every
species that can be caught, falls a prey to the Gulls.
Mr. Lanceloth Haslope kindly sends us the following extract from a
letter received from his son in India, dated June 13th, 1902. The bird referred to
is the Hawk Cuckoo, Megalama caniceps. (Seepage 203.) "The other day a
bird came into a myrtle-bush growing in a tub below my front steps. I thought
it was a young Crow; but when I examined it, it turned out to be a Brain-
fever Bird. It is a kind of Cuckoo which has a not unmelodious whistle,
which it repeats with maddening iteration; hence its common name and
the fact that every man's gun is against it. The cock is blackish, the hen
spotty, something like a Cuckoo. It comes in the hot weather, when
nerves and tempers are worn tliinnish. This one had been abandoned by
its parents because the Crows were persecuting it--so my servants said. It
was very draggled with wet when I found it, and looked miserable. The
Brain-fever Bird I dislike, but I do not love the Crow either, in fact I
shoot him whenever there is a caws; and I could not bring myself to leave
the poor youngster to his ver}&amp;apos; untender mercies. So I took him in, after
trying to get his parents to remove him. He adopted me as his father and
mother at once and without reserve; came on to my hand and gave the
usual signs of hunger. He has only been with me about four days now, but
from the first he has hardly been comfortable when I am in another room.
He sits on the back of a chair near me at meals and on a box in my study ; I
have not got a cage for him yet. He often tries to fly on to my shoulder and
head, with occasional success. If I go into my dressing-room he comes
after me, with ungainly, frog-like leaps, but is quite happy and goes to
sleep when I put him on the top of my looking-glass. He shows perfect
confidence in me ; even affection ; in fact, he is a most engaging pet
already. I do not know how to feed him, so he gets about what I do :
just now he is particularly full of porridge, which seems to suit him. In
colour he is blackish above, spotted with white on his legs and under his
wings. He is about the size and shape of a Cuckoo. The native poet calls
him the Indian Nightingale, and compares his (the poet's) lady's voice to
that of the bird. So they tell me, for I do not read the native poets : it is
not that I deem them low, but for many other reasons, the first of which is
I cannot. . . . The Brain-fever Bird has come on to my shoulder and is
investigating the back of my neck, so I shall stop."
Those of our members who are fond of reading about foreign birds in a
wild state, will be interested in the following extract from a paper on West
African birds, by Dr. G. Hopkinson, which appeared in the June number of
Bird Notes : -- " Every village swarms with Firefinches, the cocks gorgeous in
their scarlet plumage, attended by about a dozen more soberly-clad hens.
They are absolutely domesticated, flying in and out of the houses and building
in the grass roofs, and finding the greater part of their food in the compounds
around the houses. This for the most part consists of the wasted seeds of
the millet, and one often sees the heap of husks, which accumulate where
the women winnow the ears, red with these little birds. Besides they also
hunt for and catch a large number of small insects in the thatch, and
perhaps the fact that they require more insect food than their congeners
may partly account for their undoubtedly greater delicacy as cage-birds.

"Cordon Bleus and Common Waxbills are the next most noticeable
birds. These, although they do not actually live in the villages, are confined,
like all the small seed-eaters, to the cultivated ground immediately
surrounding the villages ; here any day one sees, besides the above,
Lavender Finches, Zebra Waxbills, Singing Finches and many other small
seed-eaters, while Glossy Starlings (both Long-tailed and Purple), Pipits,
Reed Cuckoos, and Warblers in hundreds, represent the soft-billed birds."
A specimen of the Racket-tailed Tarrot (Prioniturus platurus ), from
the Celebes, imported by our esteemed member, Mr. E. W. Harper, has just
been purchased by the Zoological Society of London, and is now on view
in the Parrot-house. This is the first example of this species received by
the Society, and in all probability the first ever imported alive to Europe.
Space will not permit of our describing the bird here, but no one, who is
interested in the Psittacidcs should fail to inspect it. We may mention that
the spatules or ' rackets' have been broken off on the journey from India,
but otherwise it is in good plumage.

CORRESPONDENCE.
THE BLUISH FINCH ; PUTTING UP BIRDS FOR NESTING.
Sir, -- I should much like to identify a pretty little finch that I have.
It was caught in Brazil near Santos. It has a thick bill like a Gouldian's,
yellowish in colour. It is about the size of a Black-headed Mannikin, but
slighter in build, and with a longer tail, and is nimble, and wags its tail
like a St. Helena Finch. It is very sober in appearance, being of various
shades of grey, the head almost black, wings and back dark grey, sides
light grey, breast and belly white. It has a small triangular patch of black
under the chin, bordered by a baud of pure white which goes to the open-
ing of the beak on both sides. The white is bordered by a stripe of black
that is placed just above the breast, and meets the black cheeks and head.
It is a charming pet, tame and lively, and always in perfect feather, except
when it moults, which it does suddenly, and remains without its tail or with
a bare head for several days. It sings like a Canary but in a much softer
tone, and will sing even at night. In Brazil it is called " Papacape," so the
lady who caught it in her own garden told me; but as yet I have not found
its description anywhere.
I do not quite understand what you mean bv " Putting up your birds
for nesting." Mine have built nests all winter and slept in them. Do you
separate the hens from the cocks in the winter?
G. Tommasi Bai.dei.LI.
The following reply was sent to the Contessa Tommasi Baldelli:
Your little Papacap&amp; from Santos is the male Bluish F&amp;apos;inch
Spermophila ccerulescens ; it is found in Southern Brazil, Argentina, etc. The
female is different.
During the winter months, I do all I can to prevent my better birds
from nesting. If necessary, I segregate the sexes. As a general rule, how-
ever, it is sufficient to keep a number of birds together in large flight cages,
especially if you do not let them have any sleeping boxes of any kind
whatever. Towards the end of May, the birds are transferred to the best
garden aviary, in which there are a large number of nesting boxes and
places of many kinds, with abundance of material; and practically every
bird goes to nest forthwith. With me, I find this course produces the most
satisfactory results. But the great mass of the birds have to take their
chance in the birdroom and general aviary. When the more delicate species
have to roost on the open perches, they require more warmth. This point
may not be disregarded with impunity. Reginald PhillippS.

They were born in July last year, and, as the following description of
the plumage of the survivor will show, resemble both parents.

salmon tinge; bill, very pale pinkish horn colour; the size of the bird is
about midway between both parents.
Both young birds, up to being a fortnight old, were almost bare, but
on leaving the nest at the end of 26 days were then full)&amp;apos; fledged. They
were fed and reared entirely by the Silverbill. The bird now living has

WAX BILL, &amp;c., &amp;c.
Sir, --I wrote and asked last year how to rear young Virginian Night-
ingales, and I am writing this year to say I have been successful in rearing
a fine cock bird. In May the)&amp;apos; had one young one, which disappeared at a
week old, so, when the hen hatched out two the next time, I took the cock
right away. The hen brought them up until they were three weeks old,
but the w&amp;apos;eather was very bad and one succumbed. They came out of their
nest too soon, at ten days old. She fed them on bread-and-milk, egg-food,
cockroaches and mealworms. She is just going to nest again (July 2nd).
I have two Cordon Bleus in the nest, and one Silverbill out, bred from
a cock Silverbill and hen fawn Bengali. I have had fertile eggs from a
cock Goldfinch and hen Green Singingfinch, also from a cock Saffron
Finch and hen Canary, but both pairs forsook their nests. The latter are
nesting again, so I am going to put their eggs under a reliable Canary.
I should like to know if St. Helena Waxbills breed freely in aviaries ;
mine are always making large nests. A Zebra Finch hen brought up six
strong young ones in one nest, but unfortunately died, I think of egg-
binding, soon afterwards. Could any ot the members tell me if maggots
are injurious to Cordon Bleus and other birds bringing up their young ?
M. C. Hawke.
The following reply was sent to the Hon. M. C. Hawke :
The St. Helena Waxbill is a very free uester,--and will rear its young
in good sized aviaries, but not usually in small places. During the summer,
at any rate, it does better in every way out-of-doors.
It is my own opinion that maggots may be very injurious to Cordon
Bleus, as they are heating, more so even than mealworms. I think Cordons
are better without either. But I may be quite wrong, and invite other
members to give their experiences. Reginald PhillippS.

Sir, -- W ill you be good enough to let me know how to treat a pair of
Quails I have recently purchased, and which are now being advertised by
the dealers under the names of Black-throated or Indian Pigmy Quail.
Having no outside convenience, I am compelled to keep them in an inside
aviary, with an area of about 12 feet by 8 feet.
I find them extremely wild and shy ; and they remain under cover of
a small bundle of hay and branches thrown into a corner of the aviary for
their shelter.

Is there a probability of their becoming tame, or at least bold enough
to constitute themselves interesting by giving their owner an opportunity
of seeing them, without the necessity of entering the aviary to turn them
out of their favourite retreat ?
I do not know the true name of this bird, but fancy I recognise an
old acquaintance in the cock; as I believe him to be the type of bird which
I have seen kept by a certain class of the natives of Southern India in
small wicker cages for fighting purposes.
At present they have access to the usual seeds -- millet, canary, rape ;
but no hemp; mealworms they&amp;apos; - appear to ignore--but they may possibly
eat them as I have had no opportunity of watching them feed, owing to their
shyness. Archibald Simpson.
71 le following reply was sent to Mr. Simpson :
If your birds come from India, the)&amp;apos; cannot be the Black-throated
Ouail (Eupsychortyx nigrogularis -- from Central America, &amp;c.). But doubtless
you have the Black-breasted or Rain Quail, Coturnix coromandelica, of which
there are a good number in the market. It is a common Indian species,
often shifting its ground with the rains, to which circumstance I suppose
it owes its second name.
I have had a pair since May 23rd last. The) 7 have been very shy, but
little by little are gaining confidence, and are usually to be seen when one
is quiet.
You cannot force an habitually shy and timid bird to be tame. Reave
them alone, never handle them, do not disturb them, be gentle and slow in
your movements, keep your arms still (some people, especially ladies, wave
their arms about like windmills), and gradually they will gain confidence.
It is simply a matter of time, patience, and leaving them alone.
The treatment is very simple. They are much like chickens. Feed
them on small grains, insectivorous food, fresh ants' cocoons if obtainable,
and any small insect life. An occasional mealworm may be given. Dried
ants' cocoons are best mixed with the insectivorous food, to take off the
dryness.
They require water to drink, but never wash. The}&amp;apos; take dust baths.
Give them a lump of clean dry earth, in a sunny place if possible. If
earth is not convenient, give sand.
They should have green food of some kind. Growing wheat, grass,
&amp;c. is best, but let them have something, if it be only a lettuce or cabbage
leaf. If you could give them a green turf occasionally, it would be
beneficial.
They are naturally very strong on the wing; but in an aviary of the
size you mention probably they will not hurt themselves. In time, they
may give up flying, if not frightened. Reginald Phillipps.

same place as ants' eggs do in England. I believe the Italians call them
" dried silkworms," but of course they are the pupae or chrysalides of the
silkworm, killed with boiling water, and then the silken cocoon removed.
I understand that the}&amp;apos; are to be obtained everywhere in Italy at about id.
per lb. -- Lucky Italians! I feel sure they would prove an extremely useful
addition to the English soft-bill fanciers' larder, if we could get a sufficient
supply. John Frostick.
[The food is quite new to me ; and I thank Mr. Frostick for bringing
it to our notice, and forwarding me a sample. I crumbled it up with my
fingers, and offered it to some of my birds, but they did not seem to care for
it very particularly. However, this is no argument against the food, as we
should treat our birds as a sensible mother does her children -- give what is
good for them, not necessarily what they like. Moreover, I fear that my
birds are a little pampered. Besides, any such food should be mixed with
the general supply, and not given separately. The only real objection to
the food that I could see was that the core of each pupa is now a solid hard
lump, too large for ordinary birds to swallow, and too hard to be readily
broken up. If it were not for these lumps, I should certainly recommend
this Italian food, and endeavour to obtain a supply for my own use. I did
not try, but perhaps soaking the lumps in water might make the food
more suitable for our insectivorous pets. -- R. P.

A brood of seven young Zebra-finches recently left the nest in my

terested on June 15th to see some of the elder young ones, still with black
bills, and only very recently able to feed themselves, feeding their younger

It is extremely difficult to identify a Quail by a few feathers from the
body of the bird. I took your letter with enclosure to the Natural
History Museum, to-day, and consulted Mr. Ogilvie Grant, the great

with those on prepared skins of that species. A. G. BuTEER.

Sir, --I should like to know if there is any chance of the eggs from a
cock Goldfinch and hen Green Singing-fincli being fertile ? They have
paired, and she has laid two white eggs, in a box. I can put them under a
Canary who is a good mother. I also saw a Canary pairing to a Saffron-
finch, and I think one of her five eggs is good, so I have put it under the
good Canary who has a nest of clear eggs by a Grey Singing-finch
--Canary mule. This is his second attempt, and all clear eggs. He is
now pairing again with No. i hen. Have Saffron-finches ever bred mules
by a Canary, or Green Singing-finches and Goldfinches? There are a lot
of Canaries which the Goldfinches might have paired with. I have two
young Virginian Nightingales that are giving me^a lot of trouble; they left
the nest at ten days, half feathered, and the weather is so cold. I go and pick
them up and try to get them to sit in a travelling box. I took the cock
away, as he ate the last. The hen feeds them on beetles for choice.
- M. C. Hawke.
The follow ihg reply was sent to the Hon. Mary Hawke :
It is quite possible for eggs produced by a hen Green-singing-fincli
paired to a Goldfinch to be fertile, and the resulting mules ought to be very
pretty birds.
It would certainly be safer to let a Canary hatch the eggs ; as. on three
occasions, when Green-singing-finches have laid in my aviaries, the eggs
have all disappeared on the completion of the clutch, either the cock or
hen having evidently eaten them.
Your question respecting Saffron-finches having mules by a Canary
interests me greatly; as I made several attempts to breed with cock
Saffron-finches and hen Canaries in 1899, without result, but, the year
previously, a Saffron-finch hen which had paired with a Canary in one of
my aviaries brought up three mules, two of which unfortunately died during
their moult; the third,--alien, I exhibited at the Crystal Palace, where it
was ignored by the judge. This bird is still living, but has so darkened
with age, that its Canary characteristics have almost disappeared. one
strange peculiarity about it is, that male Saffron-finches are afraid of it ;
whereas a cock Yellow-Hammer chases it continually, under the impression
that it is a hen of its own species.
I hope you will be successful with the Cardinals. A. G. BuTEKR.

Is there any method of ascertaining the sex of the Blue-fronted
Amazon ? Lanceeoth Haslope.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Haslope :
Lice, I consider a sign of ill-health. If the Amazon were mine, I
should get a big zinc tub, in the bottom of which I should fix a perch. I
should then get some one to put on two stout gloves on his left hand, and
after the bird was on the perch, make him hold the bird by the beak.
Another person should then be told off to fill the tub with water, with
Jeyes' fluid in it -- Condy's is of no use -- at a temperature of 99 deg.
Fahf. Then the person holding the Parrot should see that it is thoroughly
drenched to the skin, up to the very beak. Take it out, dry it, and put it
before the fire to dry, keeping it away from draughts.
There will probably be nits on the feathers round the vent. These
must be removed, as the water will not injure them, and if left they will
provide a future brood of lice.
I should prefer doing it myself, but one might alienate the bird's
affections for ever, so an indifferent person had better be called in.

than that of the male.
A SICK NONPAREIL.
Sir, --I should be very grateful if you could give me any help about
a Nonpareil who has a lump on his head just above his beak, and
apparently little ulcers at the joint of the beak, and I fear inside the beak
and throat. It began about a mouth ago, the result, as I believe, of
fighting through the bars ; and since then he has not been able to crack
seed, sol am giving him a mixture of scalded bread and hard boiled egg,,
and crushed scalded rape, with six ants' eggs, and two drops of Parrish's
food. I also give bread and milk sop, which I take away after three
hours, for fear it should get sour. I also give six flies a day, two of them
soaked in oil. He seems quite strong, and often flies vigorously round liis
cage, but has a difficulty in swallowing, his first mouthfuls especially. He
has 20 drops of borax in his water, but I do not see him drink. He gasps,
but does not seem ill. I am very anxious to save him, if possible, as I am
very fond of him, and he is a really magnificent specimen which I bought
at the Zoo in November, 1898. He then had a yellow breast, but got red
in the spring; and even now he is much finer, better plumaged bird than
those at present in the shops.
I am going to the country on Saturday, and hope the air may
have a good effect, but am anxious to know wdiether it is a known disease,
and whether there is any chance of the ulcers coming to an end. My
birds are always kept scrupulously clean, and the cage is not a brass
one. He often chokes, as if perhaps bringing up matter.

dressing the sore places with glycerine of boric acid, to be obtained from any

condition. Give the bird as much insect food (insects) as possible.

Sir, -- I think I have always been under the false impression that
canary-seed was what we call punico and which, from the samples, I find you
call Indian millet. Is alpiste then canary-seed or is it inga ? Iwillsendyou
samples of my seeds, so that you may tell me if you think me right. I can get
the spray millet, for I have it sown, and when ripe I have it gathered and
kept in the ear. Last year I had much trouble in getting it, and they
brought it to me before it was ripe. I also got white millet in the ear.
The Gouldians, Masked Finches, and others seem to prefer the alpiste
seed to others, but I don't know whether it is good for them. Sometimes
I give a sprinkling of turnip seed and chicory seed, when I can get it, also
lettuce seed; but in the spring and summer I give bundles of different
grasses in the ear, and they love to pick out the seeds. The Cockatiels
and Budgerigars love oats in the ear, and dandelions and chicory. I
have learnt to know what grasses they like from a little Rose-breasted
Cockatoo, who walks out with me and shows me what he wants.
G. Tommasi Baedeeei.
The following reply was sent to the Contessa Tommasi Baldelli:
Panico is, as you say, Indian millet. Alpiste is canary-seed; but a
very poor sample. The best Spanish canary has about double the bulk of
your seed.
The sample of spray millet which you send is, I presume, that which
you speak of as taken before it was ripe ? It is not only of a very sickly
hue, but many of the seeds seem shrivelled up : the sample of white millet
(Miglio ), in the ear, looks better : I have grown similar panicles of millet-
seed in my own garden.
The only Gouldian finch which I still have alive, of eight bought in
1896, eats both canary and white millet indiscriminately ; but it will always
leave both for spray millet.
Lettuce, dandelion, and the various grass-seeds are excellent as a
change; but I am doubtful about chicory and turnip-seed : the latter I
consider decidedly bad.
I do not know what Motea is : in form it is not unlike Sesamum ; but
the latter is yellowish ; never blackish, I think. A. G. ButeER.

heat whatever. If all that Blue Mountains require to breed is heat,\x by did
not Mr. Phillipps give it them ? Had he tried (even with heat) he would

C. D. Farrar.
[We do not pretend that a diet of milk-sop is natural to Lorikeets, but
we assert that, being naturally soft-feeders, they require a diet of soft-food
in captivity, and milk-sop is at present the best we know of for them. Dry
seed is entirely foreign to them, and unless given with plenty of fruit is
likely to cause indigestion and fits. -- E d.]
[Mr. Farrar misrepresents me. I did not say "Parrakeets" but
" Lorikeets." All Lorikeets are Parrakeets, but neither of the Parrakeets
he mentions is a Lorikeet. And I referred to heat in connection with
Lorikeets in general not Blue Mountains in particular.
The reason why I do not do this, that, or a multitude of other things
I have a strong desire to do, is that, unlike Mr. Farrar, my space is limited,
and the brick boundary wall inelastic. Moreover, nearly all my birds but
the tiny Finches have to be shut up from sunset till nearly 9 a.111., because
of my neighbours' slumbers. My space is so overcrowded that I have to
consider how to keep my birds in health not how to breed them. Never-
theless, a few perverse birds, like Bicheuos (which were too much even for
Mr. Farrar), will persist in rearing young, in spite of everything that may
be done to discourage them.--R. P.]

At a Special Meeting of the Council, which was held at No. 26,
Cromwell Grove, on the 4th of July -- referring to the heavy losses which
the Society had sustained of recent years owing to its trust in its members
having in many cases been misplaced -- it was decided that much more
stringent measures shall be taken in future, not only with those who
systematically obtain the Society's Magazine without paying any subscrip-
tion, but also with those who deliberately or thoughtlessly postpone
payment until towards the close of the year. The names of those who had
obtained the Society's Magazines in the past without paying for them were
read out at the meeting. The names of those who had, at a late date , paid
in previous years, but have not, so far, paid their subscription for the
current year, were likewise read, as it was pointed out that it is impossible,
judging by the past, to know who intend to pay and who do not, as all
alike, with the rarest exception, ignore the Secretary's communications, and
month after month obtain and retain the unpaid-for Society's Magazines,
besides putting the Society to trouble, vexation, postage and packing
expenses, and heavy and serious loss by the breaking up of many whole
volumes of the Magazine.
At the Meeting, Rules 3 and 10 were entirely remodelled ; and the
new Rules are printed below ; and also -- as it is the manifest duty of the
Society to safeguard the interests of the general body of its members, who
subscribe so freely and punctually, often a year in advance--it was resolved
that those who make a custom of deferring their payments shall not, after
Christmas, have the Society's Magazine sent on to them until their
subscriptions shall have reached the hands of the Honorary Secretary.
[NOTE :--In future, Rule 4 shall be No. 3 ; No. 3 shall be No. 4 ; No.
10 shall be No. 5 ; and the present Rules 5--9 shall be numbered 6--10.]

Rule 3--now No. 4 -- as revised.
Each member shall pay an annual subscription of io/-, to be due and
payable in advance on the 1st of November in each 3 r ear. New members
shall pay, in addition, an entrance fee of 2/6 ; and, on payment of their
entrance fee and subscription, they shall be entitled to receive all the
numbers of the Society's Magazine for the current year.
Rule 10-- now No. 5-- as revised.
Members intending to resign their membership at the end of the
current year of the Society shall be expected to give notice to the
Secretary before the 1st of October. Those who fail to give notice of
their intention to resign, and who, by failing to give any intimation of
their desire to leave the Society, permit their name to appear in the
November Magazine in the "hist of Members," or to remain on the Books
of the Society, and thus allow the Society's Magazine to be forwarded to
their published or other address, and those who, not having paid their
subscription, may at any time desire to resign, or shall have had their
Magazines stopped on account of non-payment, shall send if- to the
Secretary for every unpaid-for copy of the Magazine which shall have
been forwarded to or obtained by them ; and this sum of 1 /- per Magazine
shall become due to and recoverable by the Society in each and every case.

other, and a few hours afterwards they die. Fed on Spratt's chicken
food, coarse oatmeal, green fly, chopped meat, chopped grass, etc.
[Your chicks have died from starvation, being little bags of bones:
your food, although plentiful, is too indigestible. I raise great numbers
annually without trouble, as follows : -- Ground Osborne biscuit crushed,
mixed with hard-boiled egg, put through a masher, and ants' eggs, all
slightly damped : plentiful supply of well-scoured gentles, and finely-

THE BLUE-WINGED SIVA.
Siva cyanuroptera.
By E. W. Harper, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
For the benefit of those who may never have studied
Hindu mythology, it may perhaps not be ont of place to mention
that Siva is the name of one of the gods of the Hindu Trinity ; that
lie swallowed a quantity of poison, which produced a blue
colouration upon his throat, and that he thereby became immune
to poison ever after. Although the bird now under discussion
has no blue upon its throat, the colour is evident on its wings
and tail. The Indian Roller, which may be said to glow with
both Oxford and Cambridge blue, is in great demand amongst
many castes of natives in India during certain religious festivals,
when it is liberated with due solemnity by the people who
purchase it for the purpose.
The plumage of the Blue-winged Siva has already been
described by our two esteemed members, Mr. F. Finn and Mr.
W. T. Page, in the Feathered World and the Avicultural
Magazine respectively ; and the excellent plate which, I am told,
is to appear in our Magazine will give a good idea of the beauty
of the bird. Speaking generally, the bird may be said to be
fawn-coloured on the upper parts ; light grey below ; the head
is blue, streaked with grey, blue also predominating on the
wings and tail. Oates, quoting Scully, says : " Bill grey-horny,
brown about the nostrils, and the base of the lower mandible
yellow : iris brown ; feet fleshy ; claws horny-brown." Oates'
measurements are : " Length about 6 ; tail 2'6 ; wing 2-4 "
(inches). The sexes are alike in size and plumage. A peculiarity
about the tail of the Blue-winged Siva is that the two outer pairs
of feathers are graduated, whilst the remaining ones are all
equal in length. Jerdon called the bird the Blue-winged Hill
Tit ; but it is evidently more nearly related to the Babblers than
the Tits. I11 a state of nature it is arboreal in its habits, going

about in small flocks, and feeding chiefly upon insects and
fruits. Its home isin the Himalayas at an altitude of from 3,000
to 6,000 feet: the temperature at the latter height being very
much like that of England. It displays the same desire for
tickling and being tickled which all Babblers do. Its food,
whether a piece of lettuce leaf or a struggling grasshopper, is
firmly held under one foot and torn to pieces with its beak.
Having isolated one bird in a small cage for the purpose of
observing whether "quids" of indigestible food were cast out
through the beak--as is the case with Shrikes, Flycatchers, etc.--
I was unable to discover any evidence to that effect ; even
though the diet consisted largely of material so favourable for
quid-production as dried flies.
A year or two ago, I possessed two Blue-winged Sivas of
doubtful sex which were in the same cage as a single male
Silver-eared Mesia--a bird resembling the Siva very much in
general habits. One of the Sivas struck up a friendship with the
Mesia, and was continually in its company, tickling being, of
course, mutually indulged in. Strange to say, as the affection
between the Mesia and Siva increased, the latter began to
quarrel with the other Siva, and before very long it was never
allowed to come near the Mesia, such was the jealousy which
sprang up in the tiny breast of the Siva !
Sivas generally become much attached to others of their
own species. On one occasion, two escaped from an aviary in
which about half-a-dozen more were confined ; but those which
had regained their liberty refused to take advantage of it. They
continued to haunt the trees in the vicinity of their confined
companions ; and one of them I was able to recapture, by means
of a dextei&amp;apos;ous drenching with a tumbler or two of water. At
the present time I have Sivas, Mesias, Yellow-eyed Babblers,
Sibias, and Common Babblers all in one apartment. These birds
are almost exactly alike in general habits, and are on the best of
terms with each other. A glance at them after roosting time is
sufficient to verify this, owing to the snug way in which they
are packed side by side upon the perches. So closely do they
sit, that their tails almost invariably cross those of their
neighbours.
There exist few more active birds than the Siva. Given
space, he will dart like an arrow from perch to perch, scarcely
touching them with his feet, reminding one of a deer which
appears to scorn the ground in its succession of bounds. In
confinement, the Siva thrives upon any good ordinary diet for

insectivorous birds ; lettuce leaves and fruit--such as oranges
and bananas--should also be given. A bath is daily appreciated.
Besides its call notes, the Siva has a soft, sweet song, which
is delivered in sotto voce accents with the beak almost closed.
Of its breeding habits, Oates says : " It constructs a cup-shaped
nest of moss lined with leaves, in a fork of a small tree."
THE EMERALD BIRD OF PARADISE.
(Paradisca apoda ),
By David Ezra, Calcutta.
This bird is a native of the Aru Islands. It is about the
size of an ordinary Jay, except that its head is a little smaller.
The major portion is of a rich dark brown, the top of the head
extending to the back of the neck is of a pale yellow, and the
portion from the beak to the breast is a dark shining green. The
principal beauty of the bird lies in the long tufts of fine delicate
light yellow feathers which grow under the wings, and vary in
length from six to ten inches, and resemble an " Osprey." I
have two such birds, each in a very large cage in remote corners
of my sitting room, to avoid a draught, which is detrimental to
their health. This is the second year I have had them. I place
them in the sun in the early morning for about a couple of
hours. They are fed twice a day ; first, in the morning on boiled
milk and bread ; about two hours afterwards I give each of them
from my own hands half a dozen live grasshoppers, which they
take quite eagerly one after the other, showing great impatience
if there is any delay by shrill repeated calls. At midday, their
feeding cups are cleaned, and papaya fruit, cut into bits less than
halt an inch, is given to them. At sunset the cages are well
cleaned, and all the cups are removed for the night, lest they
should eat at night when there is a light in the room and so get
indigestion.
Some of their movements are very graceful; for instance,
when they are in full plumage they throw all their beautiful
" Osprey ''-like feathers forward, covering their head, at the same
time skipping along the perch from end to end, making a low
cawing sound all the while. This is what they do when in
perfect health. Their moulting lasts for three months, beginning
in April, sometimes earlier, during which time they are languid
and dull. At the end of six months they are in perfect plumage.
They are not song birds, but have a powerful caw with about six

tones, each of which is louder than the previous one. They are
rather noisy, and, for those not accustomed to them, they are very
aggravating. When I find either of my birds off its feed, and
quieter than usual, I give it, instead of the daily grasshoppers,
two live cockroaches, which seem to act as a tonic. Once a week
I give them a douche with a garden syringe ; this they appear to
enjoy, as they move their wings so as to receive the water. Both
my birds are cocks, and I have never seen a hen ; since they are
not as beautiful as the cocks they would not find a ready sale.
The " Osprey''-like feathers are valuable ; and, as my cages are
kept scrupulously clean, they are collected in perfect condition,
and given to my lady friends. I have been able to tell } r ou so
much of these birds as they are in my room, where I have many
opportunities of watching them. I hope this account that I have
given will interest some of your readers ; I have never attempted
to write before for any magazine an account of my different pets.

our pages.--R. P.]
THE BLUE WREN.
Malums cyaliens.
By Reginald Phillipps.
This morning, July 26, I was paying a stealthy visit to the
food-corner of my reserved aviary, and was trying to localize
certain baby voices which recently have been rather pronounced,
and which, as I supposed, came only from Bicheno's and Ringed
Finches, when my eye lighted on a long thin cane, fixed
horizontally high up in the aviary, on which was glued, in the
sun and quite in the open, a tiny mite of a very light brown
colour. It was being assiduously attended to by a pair of Blue
Wrens, one on either and always on the same side, who every
few seconds disappeared and returned with some invisible
speck, which it popped into the open mouth of the youngster, this
mouth turning to one side or the other as either parent
approached. The female was the principal feeder, the male being-
more disposed to act as guard, for not for a moment was the baby
left unprotected. The parents, by the way, have always been
much persecuted by the Bichenos.
The young bird was a very fair reproduction of the
mother, with a shorter but by no means short tail. It was fully
feathered, and seemed in perfect health and condition.
On June 21, I had noticed one of the females feebly
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999382" page_id="10104300"  page_num="247" year="" vol="">

<bodyText confidence="0.999690139534884" page_id="10104300"  page_num="247" year="" vol="">
building in the centre of the aviary amongst some Virginia
creeper stalks, about five feet from the ground, in just such a
place as au English Wren might select. On the following day
she was building steadily, and was then using only hay. Just
about the time, I ceased to feed the birds from that door, and have
not since seen the nest. The male was then coming into but was
not in full colour.
Probably many of our readers are unacquainted with this
species. Take a new physic-bottle cork ; into one end stick
one canary seed to represent the bill; on to the other end, at a
right angle, fix two inches from the top of a quill pen, pointing
straight upwards to the sky ; a tiny sprig of hay will do duty for
the feet. This is the female. Dip the canary seed into the ink
pot, adorn the head, neck, and front all round with the blackest
black and the bluest blue, mop up any drops that may have fallen
during the performance with a rag and wipe down the tail
therewith, and there you have the male when in colour. When
out of colour he is more or less like the female, but with a
blackish bill and darker tail. At least this is how my male was
when he arrived on May 26 with two females. Speaking with all
seriousness, this species, which has a long tail, is otherwise so
small that one of the females has, from the first day they were
turned into the garden, spent more time outside the aviary than
in it, passing freely to and fro through the tliree-fourths inch
mesh of the roof. She can also pass between the one-half inch
straight wire bars of a cage in the house.
This species is reputed to be polygamous. It would be
childish in the extreme if I were to make an assertion to the
contrary, considering that my experience is strictly limited to my
own birds. So far as my own three adults are concerned,
nevertheless, the evidence points directly to an opposite
conclusion. The two birds which constitute the pair have
always been dead against the odd female, and to their persecutions
and her loneliness I have attributed her uneasiness. She behaves
like a female who is in search of a mate, or at any rate of a
quiet home. Her plumage at this moment is so faultless that she
could not have been taking part in the work of incubation. I
feel inclined to suggest (of course it is only a suggestion) that the
males, owing to their brilliant plumage, are killed off, leaving a
large surplus of the soberly clad females, who follow each male
about in little flocks (four females to a male is supposed, I
believe, to be the outside limit) for the sake of companionship,
and are constrained to do so by a natural deep-rooted instinctive

<bodyText confidence="0.999554325581395" page_id="10104301"  page_num="248" year="" vol="">
craving for maternity in their own poor little breasts. To me
the odd females seem to represent the Spinster Aunts of the Blue
Wren community.
I send this hast}&amp;apos; sketch at once, while my spirit is stirred
lip within me, for my avicultural duties are so heavy that r
if I were to put off writing until " to-morrow," probably nothing
would ever be written about my Blue Wrens. But hasty as the
sketch is, it will be of interest to our Australian cousins, to whom
the Blue Wren is almost as typical an emblem of their country as
the Emu.
It has since occurred to me that, on the morning of July
24, I saw a young bird above me I was unable to identify. It was
flying about a little, and had a shorter tail, but probably it was
this young Blue Wren. On the previous day, the Spinster Aunt
had been altogether exceptionally uneasy, flying about the
neighbourhood, and returning to the aviary only hurriedly and
as hurriedly departing. It did not return to the aviary to roost
until it was nearly dark. In the afternoon, one of my neigh-
bours (who keeps the most dangerous cat about, or rather does
not keep it) came round to tell me that the bird was constantly
coming into one of her rooms through the open window, but
always flew out before she could shut it in. I let down a cage-
trap from one of my upper windows 011 to the top of the aviary,,
and caught the runaway before breakfast the following morning,
and have since kept it in the house.
Why was the odd female afraid to remain in the aviary?
My theory is that the two parents, excited by the presence of
their little branclier, had treated the Spinster Aunt so badly that
she feared for her life.
If this species is really polygamous, would my birds have
behaved in this manner? I know we may not judge by
individual experiences ; but I do not find that polygamy has
been fully proved. In any case, the behaviour of my birds is
worthy of being placed on record.
[August 5.--I cannot return the printer's proof-sheets without adding
one word.
I have been out to see the young Blue Wren, which is basking in the
sun on a high perch side by side with its mother. The two birds are
practically alike, excepting for the baby expression and shorter tail of the
younger. The parents still feed the latter, but as a rule the female does
most of the feeding while the male keeps guard. The young bird hunts
freely amongst the foliage for insects ; but I have not seen it come down to
the food-saucers, nor to the ground. Wild, in a hot country teeming with

insect life, it could now fend for itself ; but there is great difficulty in
inducing the young of purely insectivorous species to take to artificial food.
The young Wren conies out when the sun shines, but has keenly felt
the cold weather we have been having, and has spent much of its time
hidden away in the most sheltered shrubs. Doubtless at night the three
sleep together in the nest.
At p. 12, Vol. II. of the Emu, I find the following : -- "Specimens of
the male Blue Wren were seen in August, and again in February, under-
going the moult from the brown into the blue livery for summer and
vice versa." In the wild state, therefore, the male is found coming into
colour in August for the Australian summer, and going out of colour in
February for the Australian winter. My bird is evidently somewhat mixed
in his mind as to the seasons, and cannot determine whether he ought to
stick to the blue and nest again or doff his brilliant jacket and retire into
private life.
I n Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds, Mr. Campbell tells us that the
eggs are from three to four, occasionally five, in number, and are of a
delicate pinkisli-white, finely freckled (sometimes slightly blotched) with
reddish-brown or pinkish-red, the markings usually being thickest at the
larger end, where they generally form a zone ; and that the breeding
season is included in the months from August or September to January,
during which time it rears two or three broods. lie adds that the male
always retains his deep-bluish tail, while he may also be distinguished by
his darker or black bill.
I do not anywhere find any remarks on the plumage of immature
birds. The Spinster Aunt is happy with the Bee-eaters, cuddling at night
under the male, but always facing in the opposite direction. -- R. P.J

By Mrs. Johnstone.
It is with much pleasure that I am able to record the
nesting of this very beautiful Parrakeet in my aviaries this
summer. It was really surprising that they realized the spring had
come at all, for it was the coldest and rainiest known on the E.
Coast of England for a great number of years. My Barnard's
Parrakeets are a lovely pair, the cock and hen so alike and both so
brightly coloured that for some time I feared I had two cocks.
The hen I had recently purchased from a well-known member of
the Avicultural Society, and had assured her she had sent me a
cock bird. This wrong opinion was soon dispelled by the pair
taking possession of an old hollow tree, admirably adapted and
quite rain-proof; all the holes, with the exception of two small
natural holes, were covered over, the said holes being one about
4ft. above the solid part of the tree and the other quite at the top,
the whole trunk standing about 8ft. high. It was an old elm, the

wood inside being quite soft, large pieces falling in when touched ;
the most easily removed I thought it safer to take away, as I
feared the eggs or young might be smothered with the soft tinder.
I may here mention that the tree I have attempted to
describe is evidently of a very popular description amongst
Parrakeets for nesting purposes. The little hen Many-colour was
most envious, but she consoled herself later with an old barrel
with some decayed wood at the bottom from the same tree.
The aviary was shared with the Barnards by a pair of
Mealy Rosellas and a pair of Many-coloured Parrakeets. The
Barnards commenced house hunting very early in April during a
week of fine weather, and on April 8th the hen commenced to
sit, so they were not long in making up their minds. They were
fairly peaceable to the other birds, but constantly chased the
cock Mealy Rosella round and round the aviary. This was not
surprising, for he was a most interfering bird, and would have
undoubtedly spent a large part of his time in investigating the
Barnards' new house, and was constantly driven away from the
entrance hole by the long-suffering cock Barnard.
The Many-colours they left alone, and the Mealy Rosella
(whose wife by the bye had died) persecuted the poor little pair,
not by actual pecks or attacks, but by constant worrying, until at
last I moved him into another aviary. The hen sat very closely,
as nearly as I could judge, three weeks, only coming off in the
evenings and early mornings for a little exercise ; the cock usually
sat just outside the hole and kept off the Mealy Rosella.
The cock had greatly improved in colouring, or else the
hen had become duller during the time she was sitting in the
dark tree ; there w 7 as no doubt now about the sexes, the cock
being quite brilliant in comparison to his wife.
They did not seem to mind the cold and wet at all, and
were simply fed on the usual seeds, as much as they liked to
take. There was plenty of flowering grass in the aviary, growing;
and they seemed to appreciate, with the Manv-colours, a plant of
flowering mustard, the flowers of which the) 7 stripped in pieces
and lay about everywhere.
The morning on which, I believe, the young hatched
(May 7th) there was a sharp frost, and ice on the birds' drinking
water, storms of hail and sleet, and a N.W. wind.
On June 19th, a fine bright morning, after some wet cold
weather, the first young Barnard appeared ; he was seen clinging
to the top of the wire netting in the aviary, perfectly motionless.

As far as I could see from a distance he was a dull edition of the
old birds, the ring clearly marked, and the red patch on the
forehead, the whole colouring olive green in different shades, as
compared to the beautiful emerald shades in the parent birds, but
the tips of the two long feathers in the tail were quite white.
The next day another appeared, exactly like the first, perhaps a
shade brighter in colouring, and he took up his position next the
first, at the top of the aviary, clinging with his beak and quite
motionless.
They soon improved in their flying and perching, and
were adopted (when the parents were not looking) by the Mealy
Rosella who fed them industriously. If he was seen he was
immediately chased away by the old birds, but at any rate this
proved he had no evil intention. They are now (July 8th) nearly
as bigas the old birds, but as dull in colouring as ever, and are
very sober editions of their lovely parents. They feed them-
selves, and the old birds are investigating their old tree-hole
again, I hope with further nesting intentions.

" There is a pleasure in the pathless woods ;
There is a rapture on the lonely shore;
There is society, where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and music in its roar."
Among all the species of the duck tribe which visit or
reside in the British Islands, the Sheld-duck is perhaps the
handsomest and the most conspicuous. The sexes are much
alike in plumage, but the male bird is larger and his colouring
rather brighter than that of his mate. The striking contrasts of
dark green, white and rich chestnut in his plumage are well
known to many of us, and it is probable that he gets the prefix
' Slield ' to his name from an East Anglian word, signifying pied
or parti-coloured.
Those of us who have lived by the sea, where the coast is
low and sandy with a fringe of sand hills, and where at low tide
the sea retires almost out of sight, leaving bare stretches of mud-
flats, are probably familiar with this interesting bird, Such are
the localities he loves to haunt; and in just such a locality in the
West Country have I often met with him during my rambles
among the birds, and so will try to describe some of his habits

in a state of freedom, in the hope of interesting some readers
who have not many opportunities of visiting the haunts of this
handsome species.
The Sheld-duck is a bird of the sea-shore. He is, it is
true, occasionally found a considerable distance inland, but only
on rare occasions, and there is hardly a species of duck found in
our Islands which is in a truer sense a sea-duck than the species
we are considering. The young duckling is usually hatched only
a short distance from high water mark. His infancy is passed,
not on some secluded pond or reedy lake, but among the tumbling
billows and the nooks and crannies of the sea-shore, and when
he has arrived at maturity he seldom strays from the ever-
changing line where the sea meets the land.
On the muddy flats and lofty sand hills which are so con-
spicuous in parts of the Somerset coast-line, the Sheld-ducks
find all the requirements suited to their habits. They are never
entirely absent from these haunts, but are perhaps most con-
spicuous during the nesting season. At the end of March, or
early in April, they begin to collect at their breeding places,
which are quite near to the large expanses of soft mud and sand
which have been their feeding grounds during the winter
months.
It is probable that the habits of these ducks differ some-
what, according to the locality in which they are found, and my
own observations refer only to a certain part of the Somerset
coast. I have been struck by the different breeding habits of
the birds, even in this small area. During the winter the ducks
are scattered over the feeding grounds in the Bristol Channel in
parties and flocks up to 300 or more in number. Early in
spring the birds congregate in the spots where they intend to
breed, and I know of two nesting stations, each holding more
than a hundred pairs, but in which, although they are practically
contiguous, the habits of the birds are, owing to physical con-
ditions, somewhat different.
One colony breeds on a bold headland which runs out a
mile or more into the sea ; the other colony breeds among the
high sand dunes which stretch from the base of the Down south-
ward along the coast. So close are these two colonies that per-
haps they should be regarded as only forming one, and yet it is
curious to notice that the different physical conditions have
slightly modified the habits of the birds. The Down, which is
steep and rocky near the water's edge, is partly covered with
thick vegetation and tangled masses of privet, bramble and other
</bodyText>

bushes, and the ducks which nest here often lay their eggs
beneath the thickest parts of a bush and in crevices of a rock,
instead of choosing the more usual site which is below the
surface of the ground. In the adjacent colony, however, the
birds breed among the sand dunes, where bushes are scarce and
rabbit-holes very numerous. In this place a hole is almost in-
variably selected for nesting purposes, and the eggs are often laid
many feet from the entrances to the burrows. This habit of
nesting in rabbit-holes has acquired for the bird the local name
of ' Burrow Duck.'
There can hardly be a spot in England where the habits of
these birds, in quite a wild state, can be better observed than on
this part of the Somerset coast. During a visit to the Down in
April of the present year, I came suddenly upon at least 300 of
these birds, resting in scattered parties on the sloping surface
and waiting for the tide to ebb and lay bare their feeding
grounds. The birds rose as soon as they were aware of my
presence, and it was a beautiful sight to see a hundred or more
of these birds on the wing at once, in the brilliant sunshine, and
crossing one another in all directions. The flight is more Gull-
like than that of most of the ducks, for the wings are more
slowly beaten, and this fact enables an observer to distinguish
the species at a great distance.
The Down is a favourite resting place for the birds at high
tide, but it requires very careful stalking to get a good sight of
them, as they are extremely wary and fly out to sea if disturbed.
The colony among the sand-hills loves to rest on a low island
near the river bar, or on a sand bank opposite to it, which is only
covered by the spring tides.
This bird, though usually one of the shyest and waryest
of wild fowl, will sometimes in the breeding season admit of a
ver} r close approach. I have several times walked up to within
a few yards of a pair on the bare sands while they were busily
engaged in feeding, and have also, among the sand hills, crept so
close to parties of thirty or more, that with a glass I could follow
all their movements. The drakes are at this season very pugna-
cious, and are continually chasing each other about, though I
have never seen a very serious combat. The pair seems to keep
together, though many pairs may be seen in close proximity,
which give the appearance of a flock. When disturbed, how-
ever, they scatter in all directions, the pairs still keeping close
together.

The drake is larger than his mate, and though very similar
in plumage, his note is altogether different. This is very
difficult to describe, but sounds like a low squeaky chattering
whistle, if such a noise can be imagined, and is apparently
uttered with some exertion, as it is usually accompanied by a
curious bowing movement of the head, as though the bird were
pumping up the sound with much labour. The note of the
female is either a harsh long-drawn bark or a chattering quack,
which, when heard at a distance, has some resemblance to the
harsh cry of the Peregrine Falcon.
I well remember the first Sheld-duck's nest I found. It
was early in the month of June, and I was at the time very eager
to get some eggs of this species to add to my collection. I had
often before been unsuccessful, but on this day fortune favoured
me, for while I was burrowing my way through nettles and
prickly shrubs, I came upon a ' run ' in a very thick privet bush,
which I knew had been used by a duck owing to the presence of
some of the lavender-coloured down from the bird's body.
Following up this ' run' I soon came upon a female Sheld-duck
sitting in a little hollow from which she could not escape except
by passing me. This she would not do, so I caught her, and
after admiring her plumage, let her go, whereupon she flew out
to sea with much quacking. The nest consisted of a mass of
down plucked from the bird's body, mixed up with bits of stick
and dry grass, and contained sixteen eggs of a creamy colour,
piled one on the other so as to occupy less space. Two of these
I took away, and they were nearly fresh, having been sat on fora
day or two only, but the bird had evidently laid her full com-
plement. This is perhaps rather above the average number of
eggs for this species to lay.
Since that day I have found many Sheld-ducks' nests in
a variety of situations, such as deep down in rabbit-burrows, in
crevices of the cliffs, and under thick bushes. One nest that I
saw, last year, was placed in a bed of nettles, and the eggs could
easily be seen from above without touching the surroundings.
Such a site however I regard as quite exceptional, and the
commonest situation for the nest is deep down in some rabbit-
burrow. The young are hatched about the middle of June, but
the date varies with the season, and are immediately taken by
their parents to the sea, where very often several broods may be
seen swimming together. The young are active little creatures,
and scatter in all directions if alarmed. I have never been
fortunate enough to see the parents taking their young to the sea,

<bodyText confidence="0.999552111111111" page_id="10104308"  page_num="255" year="" vol="">
but I have been told on reliable authority that they sometimes
carry them down singly in their bills while on other occasions
they lead them in a brood to the water. The situation of the
nest would probably determine the mode of transport, the young
which were hatched on rocks and slopes above the sea being
probably carried down in the parents' bill, while those which
first saw daylight at the entrance of a rabbit-hole on the shore,
could easily follow their parents over the sand and mud-flats into
the water.
When these birds wish to change their feeding grounds
and to pass over a few miles of intervening laud, they mount
high into the air for the sake of security. When, however, they
only wish to pass farther along the coast they do not trouble to
rise many feet above the water. I have seen parties flying over
a sea-side town in a long diagonal line. They seem to be regular
in their habits, and pass daily over the same spot, but their hours
are naturally less regulated by the sun than by the state of the
tide.
I have heard of many other interesting habits of this species,
such as a curious trick they are said to have of paddling quickly
with their feet on the mud to attract the worms to the surface.
My object, however, in this article has been to record as far as
possible only my own observations, and so I will refrain from
giving second-hand information. The above notes are of
necessity very imperfect, but are, I believe, as far as they go,
accurate, as they have been gleaned from Nature herself, with
the aid of nothing more formidable than a good field glass.

BREEDING OF SHELD-DUCKS IN CONFINEMENT.

In 1895, my father succeeded, after many failures, in
rearing a few Sheld-drakes from eggs hatched under hens. Of
these birds only two (a pair) reached maturity. They were
allowed perfect liberty, but were pinioned. To induce them to
breed, holes were cut in the banks near the water; hollow roots
of trees laid about, and shelters of faggots piled up in quiet
spots, but all of no avail. The first season they made no nest at
all but wandered about, sometimes dropping eggs in the hen-
houses, sometimes in the fields and orchards.
The following spring they wandered about in the same

way, invading all the hen-houses, and at last fixed upon a nest-
ing place in a large dark cider-house. Getting through a hole
in the door (cut to allow cats to enter), the duck scraped a
hollow in some sand at the back of the barrels, which she
lined with down from her body, and there deposited her eggs
and brought off five young ones ; and every year since they have
nested in the same place and reared broods of from 5 to 9.
The old birds are very proud of their young, and march
them round the poultry-yard, driving away the chicks from the
food in order that their own young may enjoy it.
The drake becomes so aggressive that he has to be shut
up. He will attack anybody or anything. I once saw him rush
at a fox terrier and seize it by the ear, but fortunately the dog
did not turn on him. Another time he seized my father by the
trousers and held on.
Confining the whole family in an enclosure proves fatal
to the young, though in the open they run great risks, as rats
and crows are very fond of them.
They feed with the poultry on soft food containing about
equal proportions of barley, maize-meal, and sharps, and hard
food as maize, wheat, dari, &amp;c.
If confined they should have a little half boiled vermicelli
scraps of meat, and as much duckweed as they can eat.
A peculiar and amusing habit of the young when a few
days old is the stamping about on the grass as if to warm their
feet; possibly on the sea sand, their usual nursery ground, this
would driye the insects to the surface.
Nothing can be more delightful than to see these ducks
flying round, and it seems a shame to pinion them ; but, if this is
not done soon after they can fly, they eventually disappear.
Last year an amusing incident took place while the male
bird was penned up. A male Fulvous duck, who had recently
lost its mate, took charge of the young Sheld-drakes and re-
lieved the female of a lot of trouble, often taking sole charge of
them while she went to feed. At this time the young ducks were
bigger than their foster parent.
I do not think Sheld-drakes are often met with breeding
in captivity, but several instances are recorded of their pro-
ducing hybrids with the common duck.

Pitta brachyura.
By Reginald Phillipps.
(Concluded from page /SjJ
When first I wrote out the earlier part of the account of the
Pitta, which appeared in onr July number, I gave quite a glowing
account of the solitary survivor, of its powers of flight, how it
kept to the high perches, and of other matters, in a general
vaunting strain, to impress upon my readers what a successful
keeper I am of a single Pitta--but once more I had to haul down
my flag. Before the MS. had left my hands, it dawned upon me
that the Pitta was unwell, was ill, was dying, could not possibly
survive the night. I suppose it was the sudden cold that came
back upon us in June. Moreover a fresh arrival, a Coach-whip
Bird, had driven the Pitta Irom its usual haunts, and probably it
got into a draught; any way, the bird was suffering from a
serious internal chill, and was in a critical condition. I shut it
up, gave it fluid magnesia, then ipecacuanha wine, then sulphate
of quinine, feeding it all the while on the very plainest food
possible; and the dying bird, after trying to die for a few days,
thought better of it, and slowly, very slowly, recovered. But the
boastful lines had to be erased, and the milk-and-watery
sentences substituted, which have already appeared. I mention
this sickness of the Pitta for more reasons than one. The Pitta
never left the shelter of the bird-room, but was so susceptible to
atmospheric changes that the cold of an English June nearly
proved fatal to it. Again, I have had several cases of chill in which
I have found ipecacuanha wine in the drinking water most
beneficial. The Pitta, by the way, is a thirsty soul--an invaluable
lever to assist one in pitchforking a bird out of the grave. And
yet again, some species are chicken-hearted, and when they fall
ill they make no fight, but settle down to die. Thus the Pitta:--
and a tonic of some kind is indispensable. The symptoms of
this particular sickness were those of certain death, and yet it
lives. At the present moment (July 15th) it seems in perfect
health, its feet exhibit no signs of tenderness, and its powers ot
flight have been fully recovered, as I find to my hindrance when
I try to get near enough to examine its present plumage.
Visitors to my bird-room not infrequently remark, in one
form or another, when the Pitta is pointed out to them, that they
had expected to see a much brighter plumaged bird. The
remark is not an unnatural one, but it shews that those who

<bodyText confidence="0.998593348837209" page_id="10104311"  page_num="258" year="" vol="">
make it are unacquainted with the nature of the species. In one
respect, in fact, to which I will refer later, the bird is actually
brighter than represented in the coloured plate. It is in cases
like this--but this is but a mild instance--that those who keep
the living bird are able to detect and observe the true habits of
a species in a way that is closed to the Cabinet Naturalist and
usually inaccessible to the Field Naturalist.
When my Pitta was left alone in the world, it became as
wild as the wildest Pitta in India ; and for some weeks I had the
gratification of studying the bird as it is in the wild state. It
had arrived at the conclusion--poor thing, it was not far wrong
perhaps--that I was the murderer or the something of its com-
panions ; it most certainly connected me in its mind with their
disappearance, and looked upon me as a most dangerous charac-
ter. At first it kept to the highest perches, flying about with
great power, and rarely descending to the ground. But the
safety of a Pitta lies not in its wings, as the bird knows well, but
in its cleverness in assimilating itself to its surroundings. It is
not a bird of the ground, as is generally stated, nor yet is it a
bird of the air. The flight is fairly powerful, up to a certain
point, and is straight like a Partridge's but not nearly so noisy.
In comparatively open ground, it could rarely escape from a bird
of prey, and in the jungle would soon be destroyed, and become
extinct, if it were not that Nature has taught it how to hide its
bright colours and become inconspicuous. Not on the ground,
remember, but in some bush, some few feet from the ground,
when it spies a foe, it does not fly until it knows it has been
detected, but braces the feathers tight to the body, stoops and
leans straight forward pointing to the enemy, and offers a re-
markably small and inconspicuous object to the view. The
bracing up of the feathers hides every bright speck, and the
stooping and pointing-forward position of the whole bod)&amp;apos;render
the red underparts wholly invisible. In the gloom of a forest, the
tiny fawn-brown speck, in the midst of a bush some 3--5 feet
from the ground, would be a most difficult object to detect. Half
the world would pass by within a few feet of the bird without
having a suspicion of its presence. When high up, on the other
hand, it usually flies when approached, as if conscious of its
inability to effectually hide itself. My bird has now become
fairly tame again, although still remarkably suspicious, and has
given up hiding; but when visitors come, although it does not
play 'possum, but wags his little tail about, it still habitually
braces itself up, and invariably faces the visitor, so that no bright

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998520023255814" page_id="10104312"  page_num="259" year="" vol="">
colours are visible. I think I have nearly always to point out
the Pitta to visitors before the}'' see it. On a few occasions I
have seen a Pitta endeavouring to escape observation by pre-
senting only the dull green of the back parts to the gaze of its
pursuer, putting its head into a hole or corner for instance, but
that is altogether the exception, and I think only resorted to
after it has been discovered, and is endeavouring, in mad terror,
to hide from some cruel pursuer. On a perch, it never turns its
back to the enemy.
I must mention that the general idea that the Pitta, when
in health and plumage, is a ground bird is an erroneous one. It
is a bird of the bush and jungle, not of the ground. If it were a
ground bird, it would run like a Quail, or would walk like a
Jackdaw. It does neither, however, but proceeds by hopping,
getting over the ground remarkably quickly all the same. My
bird particularly dislikes the open garden, infinitely preferring
the gloom of the birdroom. A Pitta will never roost on the
ground, unless absolutely compelled to. In the birdroom they
usually went to roost far beyond my reach. I do not find that
they like to perch on stones or mounds, but invariably take to
the perches. The statements that I have met with that " it
rarely alights on a tree" I think must be wholly erroneous,
unless high forest trees are meant. When not frightened, it
prefers the bush; but my birds, when flushed, invariably took to
the highest perches. I observe, too, that most of the accounts
of the Indian Pitta are simply cribs from Jerdon, who is ignored,
and the statements advanced as if they were the result of modern
and independent observation. It is thus that errors are per-
petuated.
I have mentioned the wagging up and down of the Pitta's
tail. I must also mention that sometimes, when perhaps a little
nervous and doubtful of one's intentions, it commences flicking
its wings, and continues to do so for some time.
It occasionally takes a bath, but with me, not often. Per-
haps I am too cold. It is only I think when two or more are in
a cage, and get dirty, that they take to tubbing at all freely.
I made many attempts to sex my Pittas. In July, I
"he'd" and "she'd" them as if I knew all about it but, as a
matter of fact, I have never been able to sex them with certainty
while they were alive. While they were alive, I sexed them more
by their ways than by their plumage. I may be wrong, but am
inclined to think that the " crow " is a sign of the male. My
survivor is, I believe, a female--and it crows; but I think it did

not crow while its fellows were alive, and I fancy its crow is not
nearly so loud and shrill as were those of the males. It is well
known that a solitary female of some species will sing ; the
common Virginian Grosbeak is a familiar example. I feel, there-
fore, that the crowing of my supposed female, being a solitary
bird, does not necessarily disprove my suggestion that, under
normal conditions, the crow may be a distinctive sign of the
male.
On referring to my Bird Journal, under the date of Feb-
ruary 12th last, I find the following entry :--" A double whistling
scream is their most common note, sometimes a single scream--
longer, sharper, and louder. The war-cry is quite different, and
means murder." I cannot recall to mind this war-cry, so must
be content with the simple extract. It does seem silly, but the
Society is to blame, for giving me so much work to do that often
I am unable to post up my own Bird Journals.
The only cry I ever hear now is the " crow," or " double
whistling scream " of the above extract. But it is now never
loud and shrill enough to be called a scream. What is this cry?
Is it a song, a call-note, or a crow of defiance ? Certainly some-
times the latter. When one bird has been shut up, I have seen
another go to the outside of its house and crow at it in a way
that there was no mistaking. Yet very often one feels that it
must be the call-note. As I write this, I hear my Pitta in the
next room. It is not a crow of exultation, but mournful, as of
one who calls and there is no one to answer. This call is a kind
of double whistle, sometimes pretty frequently repeated, shrill,
resonant, unmusical, practically without variation, and in the
jungle might be heard at a considerable distance.
According to Jerdon (Vol. I. p. 504),--" Its Singalese name
is said to be derived from its call Avitch-i-a ,pronounced slowly and
distinctly." Doubtless this is my double-whistling note, but, if
I may judge by my own birds, the description is not good. It is
rather Who-ee ; zvho-ce-oo, pronounced rapidly, so rapidly some-
times that the first note of the second whistle is lost in the
second, and the call becomes Who-ee ; whee-oo. There are two
quite separate sibilant whistles, the component parts of each
being slurred together, the emphasis in each being on the ce.
Jerdon adds " Blyth was informed that it has a screeching note."
Perhaps this is the single note I have referred to. Years ago I
had four Piping-Crows (GymnorhinaJ ; one old White-Back used
to belch forth (I can use 110 milder description) a single scream,
full of venom, malice, and hatred against a Bantam in the next

garden, whose crow infuriated the Piper to the last degree. The
single scream of the Pitta was like this, but milder; and in each
case the scream seemed to be tinged with a ring of impotent
rage, generally, with the Pitta, when the rival was in another
room. The war-cry of the Pitta was the blood-thirsty war-whoop
of Fennimore Cooper's Indian brave, as he hurled himself upon
the sighted pale-face in the hopes of raising his scalp. I
have seen the weaker Pitta cower with terror at the sound of the
dreaded note.
It is usual to refer to birds of the vindictive nature of the
Pitta as being pugnacious. I consider the word to be unsuitable.
Pittas, like many other species, do very little indeed in the way
of actual fighting : -- one just runs away, and another just runs
after it -- at least that is my experience ; I do not call that fight-
ing. hike many other birds, when kept huddled together in a
confined space, beyond a little tilting, they do not very seriously
interfere with one another. Give them liberty, and a run for life
commences.
All writers seem to agree that the Pitta, in the wild state,
is a solitary bird ; and that such is the case is fully supported by
the behaviour of my anything but " happy family."
With a few notes on the plumage of the Pitta, I will bring
this paper to a close.
There is one serious blot in the Coloured Plate ; and it is
difficult to say exactly how it came about. On the wing-shoulder
(lesser wing-coverts) of my Pitta, as there was on the shoulders
of the other three, there is a patch--varying in size and shape
according to the movements of the bird--of the most brilliant
light azure blue, more brilliant than can be produced by art of
man. This spot was represented in the original painting. In
the proof (three-colour process), this spot was dull, and I was
told it could be improved ; but instead of being improved it has
practically been wiped off the face of the picture altogether,
shewing the inferiority of any mechanical process compared with
the work of that inimitable structure the human hand. Please
bear in mind, therefore, that, on the spot indicated, although not
often to be seen by strangers, there is a beautiful patch of
brilliant light blue, which in the sun sparkles like a gem.
Another point in the plumage I must refer to, as only a
trace of it can be found in the illustration, owing to the portrait
having been taken before the new feathers had fully developed
themselves, but which is now, as a rule, fully apparent in the
living bird.

In the description of the Bird, the Museum Catalogue
(Vol. XIV. p. 423) says,--" narrow superciliaries buffy white,
produced on the nape into pale bluish lateral tufts." Jerdon
gives it,--" a white superciliary line extending to the nape, but
not quite meeting its fellow." On my bird, the superciliary
streak is mostly buffy white, except at the tufts, which seem to
be white ; but I may be mistaken, for, if I now look attentively
at the Pitta, it is off in a moment. Jerdon does not refer to the
tufts, but describes their position well, for they are hardly lateral.
Some times these tufts are rather conspicuous, and at one time I
thought to sex the species by their aid ; but I will not now do
more than throw out the hint for some one else to work out.
With another extract from my journal I will close:--
"When courting, perhaps they turn their backs to their mate,
standing up and folding and unfolding wings, tail wagging
perpendicularly."

Prioniturus platjirus.
By E. W. Harper, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
I don't like rushing into print, especially when I feel that
my knowledge of the subject upon which I am writing is very
small. Parrots are not birds which I am particularly partial to.
From an early age, I have been under the impression that
Parrots in general are birds which delight to render themselves
objectionable by making hideous noises ; this impression was
doubtless given by frequent visits to the Parrot-house at the
London Zoo, when my age was what is generally known as
tender. Another reason why Parrots are not favourites of mine
is that everyone who sees a Parrot--specially if it be a lady--is
sure to ask, " Can it talk ? " In the case of the bird I am now
writing about, I had to reply in the negative ; at the same time
looking and feeling very sheepish. Nearly everyone to whom I
had to confess that the bird was not of a conversing nature,
appeared to give me a look which embraced contempt as well as
pity. Contempt for a man who was unable to teach a Parrot to
talk : pity for the individual who could be such a confirmed idiot
as to keep a bird which could not talk! Things got to such a
pitch that I dreaded telling anyone that I had a Parrot at all ;
lest I might be requested to bring it forth for inspection. If it
got to the inspection stage, and such exclamations as " Pretty
dear," " Oh ! what a beauty," were indulged in (to the Parrot, of

course) b} r the visitor, I knew it was only a question of seconds
until the fatal question, " Can it talk ? " would be asked. It was
of no earthly use for me to hint that I had not time to teach the
bird ; that it was a young one ; or, that I had not possessed it
very long. Such paltry excuses only tended to heighten my crime
of keeping a non-talking Parrot. Now, all that is over : I can
show my other birds to friends, without feeling that they will
have a chance of asking that question which once seemed to be
continually clinging to me like a nightmare. Gentle reader, to
ask the owner of a non-talking Parrot whether it talks, is as bad
as asking a man if he has paid for his last new hat ! Don't do
it. But, " What has become of the Parrot ? Is it dead?" I hear
someone ask. No ; the London Zoo has purchased the bird, and
the Secretary writes to say that it is the first one of its kind they
ever had. Its home is in the Celebes.
Our esteemed member, the Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton,
is to be thanked (or blamed ?) for these notes. Tho other day,
after I had written to say that I had not time to write an article
for the Avicultural Magazine at present, he replied, " I hope you
will not be obdurate, but will write a short account of the bird."
So I gave in. As I have not the bird before me, I must trust to
my memory in describing it. The general colour is green, with
a bluish tinge about the neck. The inner feathers of the wings
are yellow, this colour being often visible when the wings are
naturally folded upon the back. The most important part of the
bird's plumage, however, is its tail, the peculiarity of which
gives the bird its name. The two middle tail feathers are
elongated, something like those of the Racket-tailed Drongo.
That is to say, the webs of the two feathers, at a distance of three
or four inches from their base are wanting, only the stalk of
the feather being present for two or three inches. At the extreme
end of the "stalk" is a flattened circular knob or "racket,"
about the size of a split pea. When I first purchased the bird
from the establishment of a well-known Calcutta dealer, no
evidence of the " Rackets " was visible ; but our learned
member, Mr. F. Finn, of the Indian Museum, who was with me
at the time, at on-ce identified it. Another striking point about
the Racket-tailed Parrot is the colour of its beak, which is slaty-
blue. The legs and feet are of a leaden colour. The bird,
before I purchased it, had been fed upon " gram " (a kind of pea)
previously soaked in water. So on tiring of the bird, and being
overcrowded, I sent it on deposit to the Calcutta Zoological
Gardens, where it was also fed upon the same kind of soaked

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997122851851852" page_id="10104317"  page_num="264" year="" vol="">
" gram." Upon this diet it throve, and kept in good condition.
It shared the same cage as another Racket-tailed Parrot, which,
by its brighter plumage, I took to be a male. After removing the
bird from the Calcutta Zoo, for the purpose of bringing it to
England, I fed it as I would have done an African Grey Parrot,
viz., on canary seed, hemp, dari, rice in the husk, and millet ;
it was particularly fond of canary seed. A bit of dry biscuit,
toast, or crust of bread was always relished; as were also fruit,
such as banana or orange, and a little lettuce now and then.
During the first week or two of the voyage home, the bird was
continually gnawing its perch ; in fact, I had to get it renewed
by the ship's carpenter. Latterly, it quite gave up the habit; and
I am inclined to think that the diet of hard seed and dry biscuit
effected the cure. Water was always left in the cage, but the bird
did not drink much ; it did little more than taste the water three
or four times a day. I use the word " taste" in its correct sense
--some people who live in Scotland are apt to misapply the word
and exaggerate its meaning. (I am an Englishman ! ) When
pleased or excited the bird uttered a single note like the word
" click." At other times, especially when its cage was placed in
the sun, or after it had partaken of a juicy slice of a ripe
orange, it would cry out rather loudly in a chattering voice.
In the dark, if the cage were moved suddenly, the bird would
make a harsh, gutteral, hissing noise. I11 conclusion, I must
give the bird a good character, by stating that it never made
itself a nuisance by continually screaming, as so many badly
behaved Parrots are wont to do.

Stictoptcra annulosa.
By Mrs. Howard Williams.
We bought two pairs of these finches in January last, and
after a few weeks passed in a good sized flight cage, they were
turned into an aviary placed in our conservatory, containing
Gouldians, Long-tailed Grassfinches, Double-bands, a pair of
Zebra Waxbills, and a few Canaries and Avadavats.
They settled down happily, and took their share of all the
food going, consisting of Indian spray and white millet, ants'
eggs, Abrahams'preserved egg, canary seed, and, most important,
cliickweed, which we grow in frame all winter, and which we find
much less rank and coarse than the ordinary garden variety, and

flowering grass as soon as we could find any. We also give
soaked canary and millet.
We did not pay any very special attention to them for some
time, being much interested in some Long-tails and Gouldians
which were all nesting, but at last I noticed that a hen Ringed
Finch was sitting in a very old rush basket with a hole in the
back, which was hanging on the wire front of the aviary, about
the level of my eye. I could plainly see the hen sitting through
this hole, but foreign birds being shy we scarcely looked at her
at all lest she should desert.
However, one day a Red-headed Gouldian, in a fit of
jealousy, went to a cocoanut husk belonging to a Black-head and
threw out six infant Gouldians, scattering them over the floor.
Someone climbed into the aviary (no easy task as it stands on
four legs), collected the poor mites, and replaced them, and
reported that the Rings were not only hatched but were feathering
well. The Gouldians were thrown out again and died, but we
caught the murderer before he did any more harm, and our
precious Ring Finches escaped his unwelcome attention. Finally,
on May 29, they left the nest. There were three of them, one
rather larger than the others. I11 appearance they were very
much like their parents but much lighter, especially the wings
and tail, and the dark shading at the top of the beak was hardly
noticeable. I11 one important point, however, they were entirely
different. Seen full face they were absolutely ringless, and their
breasts were pure white. In profile, they showed the beginning
of the upper ring which encircled the face. In a few days, there
was a faint indication of the lower ring in the two smaller ones,
but the eldest kept his pure white breast some time longer. They
were very small, but scrambled about vigorously, and managed
to get back to their nest whenever they were tired, and always at
night.
They are now (July 12) about nine weeks old. They
show both rings fairly distinctly, though they are not clearly
defined yet. They seem to be moulting a little, and we imagine
the rings will perfect themselves, and the plumage darken when
the moult is finished. They are very healthy, feed themselves
entirely, and are very fond of green fly which they pick off the
rose and honeysuckle sprays placed in the aviary.
It is interesting to notice the difference between them and
the ordinary Bicheno's Finch, which has bred with us several
times. We think they leave the nest about the same time, at
three weeks old, but whereas the Ringed Finch emerges ringless

his relative has both rings quite as clearly marked on leaving the
nest as the Ringed Finches have now at nine weeks old.
They are very tame confiding little creatures, and very
gregarious in their habits, feeding, bathing, and playing about
together with no quarrels or jealousies over food, mates, or nests.
Our aviary was made to stand in a sheltered verandah, but
is a great success in a conservatory. It is made of wood, wired
only in front, with a high wooden gable roof, and this probably
protects the birds from the extremes of heat from which they are
said to suffer in a conservatory. If it is very cold in winter and
early spring, and the usual heat seems insufficient at night, we
set a powerful lamp on the floor close to the aviary, which gives
out a good deal of heat as well as light, and lasts all night. It is
also used for an hour before bed-time as long as the very dark
evenings last, to give the birds a chance of a late supper, of
which they take full advantage.
The Ringed-Finches used grass for their nest, and also
some New Zealand fibre, which we threw into the aviary on the
chance of some bird taking it.
The parents seem to be nesting again ; and the other pair
bought at the same time have eggs, if not young ones, so we are
hoping for an increase in the number of our little family before
long.
BIRD NOTES.
The July number of the Zoologist contains a most useful paper on
aviculture by our esteemed member, Dr. A. G. Butler. For twenty years he
has kept birds in captivity, not only as a fascinating hobby, but as a means
of acquiring a knowledge of the habits and life of birds, of which the
" cabinet ornithologist " often knows next to nothing. During the whole
of the time that Dr. Butler has been an aviculturist he has striven, as he
tells us, " to make this labour of love useful to ornithologists generally."
A pair of White Storks, which have lived in Kew Gardens for three or
four years, have this year reared one young bird. This is a matter of con-
siderable interest, as it is probably the first instance of this species having
bred in this country. An interesting letter on the subject, from the pen of
Dr. A. Gunther, appeared in the Field of August 2nd, to which we would
direct the attention of our members.
Some of our members will be interested in the following letter which
appears in the current number of the Emu , from the pen of Mr. E. H.
Webb, of Macknade, North Queensland, dated May 12, 1902 : " A few days
ago I found a nest of the Crimson Finch {Neochtnia phaeto?i) in a curious

position. It was placed in the thatch of a grass-built hut, just below the
edge of the roof and close to the door, the hut being occupied by some
Chinamen. It was firmly wedged in, the entrance being scarcely visible,
and contained three eggs in a very advanced stage of incubation. Though
by far the greater number of these finches build in this district in the pand-
anus palms, I have often found their nests in growing sugar-cane, wedged
in amongst the dead 'trash' which adheres to the stalk. Both the Crimson
Finch and the Chestnut-breast [Munia castaneithorux) are at present breeding
plentifully, and appear to do so all the year round."
Dr. W. T. Greene has kindly sent us the following account of the
adventures of a young Cuckoo, which he has received from a correspon-
dent : "Two little Redstarts had built their nest on one of the stone pillars
that support the balcony in front of the dairy. We were amazed at their
folly, wondering how they expected to get their babies fledged without
Brian (one of the cats) eating them. One day M - was greatly
distressed at seeing Tabs (another cat) walking up the stairs with a dead
naked bird in her mouth. M - took it from her, but evidently Tabs
had not killed it, for it was quite cold, and M - had seen her go down
the stairs and come back immediately with the bird. In a minute or two
Tabs went back and looked about on the ground round the pillar, so that
seemed to show she had found the young bird on the ground. We thought
the parents had somehow made it fall out of the nest in fright at the cats,
or something of that sort, and we thought no more about it until Sunday,
July 6tli, when M - called me to come and see something extraordinary.
I went, and there was a creature that looked more like an Egyptian god
than anything else, rising slowly up and down in the nest -- like a Jack-in-
the-box, only slowly. I got a chair and looked nearer at it. It was unmis-
takably a young Cuckoo. Well, that bird has kept us waiting on him until
yesterday. On Wednesday, when the great storm was, the water was
coming into his nest, so we put a cage up near it, covered over with water-
proof paper and a little board, and put the Cuckoo in that with the door
open. His foster-parents were very good and fed him there. But INI - ,
having read that foster parents often die from starvation, not being able to
feed their foster-child and themselves, made me help them by catching
grasshoppers for the Cuckoo.
He got quite used to me, and M-- -- was meaning to write and ask
D - if one could keep a Cuckoo in a cage. Yesterday, the maid woke
M- and me up with the news that the Cuckoo was on the ground.
We ran down and I watched him while M - prepared a larger cage,
having its door some way up the side. We hoped he would stay a bit in
this new cage, for he seemed very weak and not able to fly. He had
managed to get into a sweetbriar bush, and seemed quite relieved when I
took him out. He sat on my hand and talked, and was quite pleased with
his new cage. He sat in it for some hours, attending to his wing and tail
feathers, and eating with equal pleasure the flies and things that I or his
foster mother brought him. But between n and 12 o'clock, when we were
sitting 011 the lawn with M - and M - , I -came running to
tell us the Cuckoo was on the ground again. We fled down and found him
in a rose bush. Again he seemed pleased to be caught, and I put him back
in the cage and shut the door. I hoped the Redstart would feed him
through the bars, but she would not, the bars seemed to be too close

together. After dinner we prepared him the old Parrot cage, hoping the
bars would be close enough to keep the Cuckoo in and wide enough to let
the Redstart in and out to feed him. But she meant to have him out, and
at half-past three she succeeded and got him on to the perch outside the
cage. After about five minutes rest there she called to him from a rose
bush, and he fluttered off, the foster-mother in front. They went across-
the border, and M - ran along one path and I along the other, in an
agony lest a cat or kitten should turn up and get him, I thought we looked
for all the world like the Redstart, only a little bigger! At last, to our
great relief, his foster-mother got him into the little ash tree. He quickly
went up from the lower branches to the top, and then we felt fairly happy
about him, for he evidently could use his wings much better than in the
morning. The Redstart seemed contented with that much for one da)% and
the Cuckoo passed the rest of the afternoon and the night there, for I went
at 9 p.m. to see if he was still safe, and he was. This morning at six I went
again, hoping to assist at his farther moving, but his foster-mother had
been before me and had already got him away. I feel certain he is safe, for
neither of the parents have come round all day, as they would have done
to look for him if they had lost him, so I hope lie is with them all right.
We would have kept him, only all the books say they live on nothing but
insects, and eat over 2,000 in a day. I did not feel competent to catch so
many, and beside, what could we have done for him in the winter ? So we
decided to let him go in the natural way with his foster-parents. But he
was a comical dear, and so tame."
CORRESPONDENCE.
THE MANY-COLOURED PARRAKEET.
Sir,--C ould you give me a reason why the enclosed eggs (3) did not
hatch ? The hen Many-coloured Parrakeet sat perfectly , and very closely,
and rather over the full time. She evidently tried one egg and found it was
not right. I have wondered if the hen turned the eggs; or possibly the
decayed wood at the bottom of the log-nest was too dry ? I found one egg
with two pecked holes in it, and the others were whole when I took them
from the nest.
The lieu had been out all the winter, and the cock, a most brilliant
bird, was in perfect condition.
. . . . I have since wondered if the eggs were fertile. If not, I
feel certain it would be due to the presence of the other Parrakeets,
particularly the odd Rosella. Marion Johnstone.
The following reply was sent to Airs, fohnstone :
I cannot detect any trace of there ever having been young, in any
stage, in the eggs of your Many-coloured Parrakeet; I feel sure that they
must have been clear eggs; so the cause of failure must be sought for in
the birds rather than in the nest.
You do not say for how long you have had the male, nor when the
two birds were put together. It is quite likely that one or other, or
perhaps both, had not been long enough in this country, or even in their

aviary, to have become sufficiently naturalized to our seasonal changes, and
possibly they were not in proper nesting condition in consequence.
It should be borne in mind that these Parrakeets naturally breed in
our autumn ; in this country, as a rule, the cold restrains them, more or
less according to circumstances; but towards the end of our winter the
restraint is overcome, and then it is that they are simultaneously (a most
important point) most likely to be in good condition ; and the longer this
critical time is passed the greater the probability of clear eggs.
I have had five of these birds, but have never had an opportunity of
allowing them to nest with any chance of success. If I should ever have
such an opportunity, I should keep them comfortably warm all through
the winter, in the hope that they might nest in the early spring. The
darkness does not affect them like it does Finches and such like species; I
sometimes think that they seem more inclined to breed in a dark place
than in a light one : perhaps they feel more private.
Notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary, I cannot think
that keeping your female out all the winter could have improved your
chances of success.
In our next (August) number you will find an account of the rearing
of one young Many-coloured Parrakeet by the Rev. C. D. Farrar, from
which you may gather some useful hints. You will observe that, of the
three eggs forming the clutch, two were clear.
I note the additional information you furnish in your second letter.
Quite irrespective of what I have said, the presence of such a forward and
interfering bird as an odd male Rosella would have been sufficient of itself
to account for the clear eggs. Reginald PhillippS.
THE BRAIN-FEVER BIRD.
Sir, -- With reference to Mr. Haslope's note in your last number
(above, p. 229) the 'Hawk Cuckoo' is not Megalcema cauiceps, but some
species of Hierococcyx. Megalcema cauiceps is a Barbet {=Thereiceryxzeylonicus
Blauf. B. of Iiul., iii. p. 86) -- a very different bird. The bird described by
Mr. Haslope is apparently the ' Koel ' -- Eudynatnys honorata. Which is the
real 'Brain-fever Bird'? P. L. Sclater.
[We thank Dr. Sclater for pointing out this error. The species which
is known to Anglo-Indians as the ' Brain-fever Bird ' is the common Hawk
Cuckoo, Hierococcyx varius. Mr. Finn tells us that its note fully entitles it
to its popular name, " whether from its 'damnable iteration' or from its
remarkable resemblance to the word ' brain-fever ' repeated in a piercing
voice running up the scale." (B. of Calcutta, p. 37 ). -- Ed.]
THE RED-BILLED CHOUGH.
Sir, --Two or three years ago, I bought a pair of Choughs (Cornish)
in Leadenhall Market. Each spring since I have had them they built nests
of broken sticks in logs of wood, but never laid any eggs, having destroyed
their nests immediately after constructing them. I am anxious to breed
some of these birds, and should like to know if any members of the
Avicultural Society have done so, and what has been their experience. Are
logs of trees, straw thatch, or boxes with holes in them suited for them to
build their nests in ? and of what materials should those nests be con-

structed ? I feed mine on hemp-seed and hard-boiled eggs, with a certain
amount of insects : -- is this the most suitable food for these birds ? As they
belong to the Crow kind, I presume they should breed early in the spring.
The cock bird died some weeks ago, so I should be glad to purchase
another in his place if any of your members have one to spare.
Some time ago I saw a statement in your Magazine that one of the
members of the Avicultural Society had succeeded in pairing a Jackdaw
and a Chough. I should be interested in hearing whether there was
any offspring from the union. Wm. B. Gibbins.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Gibbins :
Matty years ago, I was visiting in Pembrokeshire for several weeks.
At that time the Chough was a common bird along the cliffs ; I have since
been told that the species is now unknown in its old haunts, having been
exterminated by the egg-collector. The trade egg-collector is a terrible
curse, and should be exterminated in his turn.
I found many nests of the Chough. They were all in shallow clefts
in the rocks, or on ledges in the cliffs. I did not notice one in anything of
the nature of a deep hole, after the manner of a Jackdaw. They were all
more or less in the open, some so full}' exposed that I could see into them
and count the eggs from the top of the cliff. Most of them were in rather
inaccessible spots to climb to, but, when reached, were within arm's length.
One was in a detached rock on the beach below the cliffs, and quite easy' to
get at when the tide was out.
I hardly like to trust my memory as to the materials. So far as I
recollect, the nests were very like those of the Carrion Crow, but less bulky
and more shallow. Thus the nests in new sites. In a few favoured
positions there was quite an accumulation of material, the same spot
having been resorted to year after year. The base of each nest, if I mistake
not, was of sticks, and sheep's wool formed part of the lining--but I will
look up some books and quote below.
The Chough, in the wild state, hunts along the shore, thrusting its
curved pointed bill into holes and crevices and under stones, levering
up and turning over smaller stones, all in search of insect life. I used to
see them inland also with the Gulls, feeding over the freshly ploughed
lands, doubtless on insect life in some or every form.
Your reference to the Jackdaw is, I suppose, to my own birds ( Avic.
Mag., Vol. IV., p. 138); I do not recollect any' other case. My female White
Jackdaw, after a while, repudiated her own mate (by whom she had had
young a year or two previously), and was taken possession of by' the male
Chough ; all the eggs were clear, and are now in my cabinet. Thanks to my
beloved neighbours, after I had obtained a female Chough I had to send
the pair away: but I am satisfied that they would have bred.
I should suggest open boxes, hidden away' in high and secluded
nooks, and a good sized barrel or two, likewise hidden away, with one end
off, excepting a little piece along the bottom of the end, to help to keep the
nest safe inside. You do not say' how y'ou keep your Choughs. Their
behaviour shews that they' are thoroughly dissatisfied. Whatever the cause

they will never breed as matters now stand. Either the aviary is too small,
too exposed, or too something they do not approve of.
Mr. St. Quintin ( Avic . Mag., Vol. V., p. 73) mentions some Choughs in
his possession which annually nested in a box, but did not lay. The nests
were made of birch twigs lined with horse-hair.
Mr. Howard Saunders, and also Dr. Butler in "British Birds with
their Nests and Eggs," refer to the more or less successful breeding of the
species in semi-captivity by Lady Dorothy Nevill (a). I observe that Dr.
Butler connects my name with the " appalling " noise made by my
Choughs. This is not fair to the Choughs. / never found the noise
appalling, very much the contrary; and as to my neighbours-.
All authorities agree that the nest is built of sticks, stems of heather
or "some deciduous plant," and lined with hair, or " wool and hair."
Doubtless the slight differences are governed by the nature of the locality.
Breeding season--" End of April to middle of May." In Pembroke-
shire, on the occasion I have referred to, the first eggs -were being laid early in
May.
On looking up my Notes, I find that 1115&amp;apos; male Chough (I received the
female one year later) was a most determined nest-builder, commencing as
early as February. He carried sticks, leaves, roots, straw, practically what-
ever came to hand--but " preferred the roots." He was ever at war with
the male White Jackdaw (at this time paired with a Chinese Blue-Pie), but
would spend hours with the female in her old nest, a good-sized barrel,
hidden away at the top of the aviary. Take the male White Jackdaw, he
seemed inclined to destroy the eggs, so had to be watched and shut up.
This is not unusual with large birds of this kind when nesting in a confined
space. The}&amp;apos; ate raw meat, scraps of many kinds, insects, etc., but the
female did not care for mealworms. Both were fond of hemp.
I have strong reasons for suspecting that, in the wild state, they
occasionally fish in the shallows along the shore for crabs, shell-fish, etc.,
and perhaps even fish. They are as ready with their talons as a Hawk,
seizing and holding things with great power, simultaneously "stocking"
their victim with their bill; and their long legs render them indifferent to
a little water; and observe how " they tuck up their trousers" out of the
wet! I have been told, by the way, that the Chough in confinement does
not tub; mine did " regularly but not frequently," according to my notes.
They are said to feed on berries, but I am without knowledge on that
point.
The\ T readily pounce on other birds, and doubtless kill the young of
shore birds when they get the chance. Morris gives "grain and berries,
and certainly carrion sometimes," of course in addition to various insects.
Your feeding would seem to be hardly sufficiently generous.
To return again to the materials for nesting, Mr. Howard Saunders
refers to the long wiry stems of heather, and I have mentioned that my bird
preferred roots to sticks. Probably, therefore, when there is choice, the bird
likes something not too stiff; but doubtless, if a Chough is determined to
nest, it will not be too particular about the materials. If you should
succeed in obtaining another male, provide them with plenty of space.

\0x25A0with private nesting places fixed as high as possible, and feed principally
on animal food and insects. Give cooked meat as well as raw, the latter
not too bountifully especially to a single bird. REGINALD PhillippS.
[The Choughs did not breed in the higher cliffs, but in the lower
ranges. Why was this ? The higher cliffs were occupied by Kestrels ; but a
Chough would not care a feather for a Kestrel. There was hardly a Chough's
nest that I could not have climbed to with a little amateur assistance;
several I did reach, some quite easily. The Kestrels' nests could have been
reached only&amp;apos; by a skilled cragsman with an experienced assistant and rope.
I did not succeed in visiting one. I did try 7 for one ; but the faces of the
high cliffs were rotten and impossible. Was this the cause ? The lower
cliffs were not rotten to the same degree. The comparatively 7 few Kestrels
could have found plenty of deep ledges where they would be sheltered
from falling stones. And they 7 are not always on their feet like the Choughs.
The latter, nervous, cautious and restless, sitting, roosting and nesting
nearer the surface of the cliff, may have objected to the crumbling
precipices; on the lower cliffs, too, they would be nearer their food, and
could watch the shore, and drop down in a moment on any 7 attractive
object or for the purpose of following their favourite pursuit of hunting
amongst the stones for insects. Or were the high cliffs too much exposed
to the cold winds and storms ? In severe weather my Chough would go to
roost in the birdroom, and would fight like a demon rather than budge one
inch. Directly the weather softened out he would go, and nothing would
induce him to roost inside. In this he differed from the Jackdaws who,
whether normal or White, preferred roosting out of doors. Does this
prove that the Jackdaw is more hardy than the Chough ? Not necessarily 7 ;
the former sleeps in holes, but the Chough rarely or never. As I have
pointed out more than once, species that sleep in holes and boxes can stand
cold which will kill others, perhaps equally hardy, which roost more in
the open.
The more I consider the matter, the more satisfied I feel that the
Choughs frequented and bred in the lower cliffs because of their restless
nature, and desire to be constantly stretching their legs and using their
bills among the stones. This view is supported by 7 their preference for
those cliffs against which the waves did not beat at low tide. Those that
were not faced by any 7 foreshore were avoided.
In those days I practically never saw a human on the shore, excepting
only in one spot which the Choughs did not favour. But when I add that
a railroad has long since been run into the neighbourhood I have said
enough. -- R. P.]

Sir, -- Perhaps Miss Hawke may be interested by my experience with
Saffron-finches and Canaries.
I once had a cock Saffron paired with a hen Canary, and a most
devoted couple they appeared to be, but all the eggs were barren. Imagine,
then, my delight when I saw a young bird in the nest one day, and
especially when I perceived both the old birds feeding it.
My joy, however, was damped when, as the hybrid grew up, I found
that it was not the rara avis I had thought, but a common, uninteresting
Greenfinch - Canary mule! There were several cock Greenfinches and
some more hen Canaries in the aviary, but I had never noticed any of
the former paying attention to the Saffron's mate, who appeared to be
devoted to her handsome spouse. Nevertheless and notwithstanding, the
facts are as here related ; but, although many other nests from the same
pair followed in after years, there never was a fertile egg in any of them, so
that hybrid must have been an accident after all; perhaps another hen
Canary laid the egg from which it was hatched. W. T. Greene.
Referring to the notice of Mr. Frank Finn's book on The Birds of
Calcutta, which appeared at page 169, the author asks us to state that it can
now only be obtained from Mr. R. H. Porter (7, Princes Street, Cavendish
Square), and not from Calcutta.

The .Society's Medal has been awarded to the Rev. C. D. Farrar, for
having bred the Many-coloured Parrakeet, Psephotus multicolor, it is believed
for the first time in the United Kingdom.
Mrs. Howard Williams has succeeded in breeding several specimens
of the Ringed Finch, Stictoptera annulosa, as announced at page 239 of our
last issue.
A few Ringed Finches have since been reared by at least one member;
but it is believed that Mrs. Howard Williams' birds were the first.
Airs. Johnstone has succeeded in breeding two specimens of Barnard's
Parrakeet, Bamurdius barnardi. No other instance is known of the rearing
of the young of this Parrakeet.
Articles on the successful breeding of these two species are now
published.
The Society proposes to award a Medal to each of these ladies for
having bred these species it is believed for the first time in the United
Kingdom. If any previous instance should be known to any of our mem-
bers or readers, it is requested that they will be so good as to communicate
at once with the Honorary Secretary.
We have received an article from Miss R. Alderson on the successful
breeding of the White-winged Zenaida Dove, Melopelia leucoptera, which we
hope may be published next month. If any of our members or readers
should know of any previous instance of the breeding of this species in
the United Kingdom, they are requested to communicate with the
Honorary Secretary. It was imported last year in considerable numbers,
and has been called by dealers the Pecunia Dove.

THE ST. LUCIA PARROT.
By Lady Thompson.
The St. Lucia Parrot ( Chrysotis versicolor ) is one of the
three largest Amazons, but it is very unlike C. augusta and still
more unlike their neighbour of St. Vincent, the Chrysotis
guildingii, which does not possess the familiar blues and greens
of all other Amazons.
The Versicolor is not uncommon in the high woods of St.
Lucia, but very few uninjured specimens are found in captivity,
and even in St. Lucia they command a high price alive.
Unfortunately dead birds may be found almost every week in the
market of the little town ol Soufriere, and they are eaten as a
delicacy by botli black and white Creoles. The Parrots, called
in patois "Jacquots" or " Perroquets," are protected by
legislation during the nesting season, but, owing to the wild
nature of the country where they are found, it is difficult to
enforce the law. I have heard the unmistakable cry of the
Parrots more than once in my rides through mountain tracks,
and once I saw three birds together.
Of those that I have known in captivity, one only was a
good talker, and that bird had been for many years in the
possession of a Creole family in St. Vincent. The other caged
birds I have come across were tame, but the only words I have
heard them speak were the usual Creole " Chere cocotte " and
" Macac " (i.e., monkey, a patois term of abuse). But both
these words so closely resemble the natural little cry the birds
constantly utter that I rather doubt if they spoke genuine words
at all.
The three birds that I had became perfectly tame, but
they were, I thought, uninteresting pets ; as a rule they took
little interest in their surroundings, but, when excited by certain
sounds, I have seen them spread their tails, and perform a kind of

extensive or long. Lady Thompson brought me one from St.
Lucia, which I had on May 27th, and besides that I have seen two.
One, in the Zoological Gardens from which Mr. Goodchild drew
the plate, and one, in a dying state, in the Berlin Gardens.
As mine has not the rich colouring of the one I saw in the
Gardens, I gather it is young, and has not yet gained its full
plumage. If Mr. Goodchild could have found the time to
sketch my bird, I should have had it done to have placed the
difference of plumage on record. The one in the Gardens is, I
regret to say, now dead. It was very tame, and delighted in
being noticed. From a bird-lover's point of view, it was
quite thrown away in the Gardens.
I look on C. versicolor as the handsomest of the Amazons,
though C. guildingii, with its mixture of orange, yellow, brown,
and blue, runs it very hard. It forms the third of the great
Amazons.
C. augusta is the largest, and then come C. guildingii , and
C. versicolor. I cannot say that I have seen a tame Guilding's, but
I have heard of one. The A?(gusta and Versicolor are both very
tame, though Augusta was obtained by a shot. How my
Versicolor was secured I do not know, but it is so very tame and
so loves notice that it makes me think it must have been brought
up from the nest.
Its size is no doubt a drawback to it as a pet ; as a parrot
cage, which would be big for a Grey Parrot, would be too small
for this species. I keep it in a cage originally built for a
monkey, and yet that is rather too small for it. The size of the
cage is 2ft. sq. by 3ft. high. It would be large enough if the
bird were not fond of flapping its wings. It is then that it is
rather small.

I must admit that the bird is very noisy. I can stand more
than most people can from Parrots, but C. versicolor has to spend
a good deal of its time under a sheet, when I am in the room.
I expect it would make a good talker, if any one would devote
his time to it. But as my Spix Macaw, who lives in the study
too. is picking up a good deal of conversation, without any
special attention, I am not without hopes that Versicolor may do
the same, especially as the Spix is certainly six or seven years old.

Priojiiturns platurns.
By F. E. Blaauw, C.M.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Some excitement having been caused in the Parrot-loving
world by the arrival, in the British Islands, of a living specimen
of this species, it may interest the readers of the Avicultural
Magazine to hear of an example which I obtained as long ago as
1888.
This bird was an adult male in fine plumage, with the
racket feathers of the tail well developed. Unfortunately it
arrived in mid-winter, during a rather sharp spell of frost, and so
probably took cold on the way from Rotterdam to my house. *
The result was that it was not in very good health when
it reached me, and it did not live very long. It was quite tame
and gentle, not moving much during the day, but generally
becoming much more lively, and sometimes even very much
excited towards the evening. It would then run backwards and
forwards on its perch, making some slight noise, and whilst so
occupied, often looked so sleek and well that I had every hope it
would ultimately recover. However, it did not get well, but
became slowly worse, and died only a few weeks after it had
come into my possession, I need hardly say much to my regret.
This Parrot fed on seeds, with the addition of stale bread
soaked in milk, with some sugar over it; a food which I have
often found very beneficial to Parrots when in rather a poor
condition.

Part I.
On returning from a journey in distant regions one is
expected, if one is anything of an Ornithologist, to write about
the birds one has seen ; and more especially is this the case when
the object of the journey has been the study and collecting of
natural history objects. I feel, therefore, that I should be wanting
in my duty to the Society did I not endeavour to give a short
account of some of the birds seen and procured.
The Bahamas are a group of islands and isolated rocks of
coralline formation, lying S.S.E. of Florida, from which they
are separated by the Gulf Stream ; the resident avifauna is, in
consequence, rather scanty, the greater part of the birds being
migrants from the United States with a small minority from
South America and the West Indies proper.
The country may be divided into four classes, each of
which contains its own characteristic birds, and I shall propose
to deal with each in turn ; they are as follows :--
1. The thick bush known locally as " coppet," consisting
of a dense mass of trees and bushes of an average height of some
20 feet, and forming, on most islands, the greater part of the
vegetation. Certain portions of the coppet are swampy, and in
such places the bush gives way to long rank grass interspersed
with clumps of palmetto, and in the wetter places with a con-
siderable growth of mangroves.
2. The " Pine Barrens " are practically large stretches of
bare rock with a very slight sprinkling of soil on which the pine
tree alone flourishes. The pines grow to a good height, and the
ground below is fairly clear, although, owing to the unevenness
of the rock, quick walking is out of the question. Here and
there are clumps of bushes round which most of the birds seem
to congregate.
3. The open swamps or lagoons are great plains of mud
and rock, which, raised but a few inches above sea level and
intersected by broad and shallow lagoons, stretch out on all sides
as far as the eye can reach. Practically the only vegetation on
these bare tracks is the universal mangrove, which in most places
grows only to a height of two or three feet, but in the centre of
the lagoons large clumps form islands and reach a height of 15 to
20 feet.

<bodyText confidence="0.989967357142857" page_id="10104334"  page_num="279" year="" vol="">
4. The outlying rocks, known as " Cays." These are bare
rocks lying out at sea often well out of sight of the nearest
mainland and generally marking the seaward boundary of the
reef. In most cases these islands are destitute of vegetation, in
others they are covered with a growth of prickly pear or small
bushes of a very thorny character.
I should perhaps have stated that nowhere in these Islands
is there any soil as we understand it in England ; the only soil
is that which has been formed by decayed vegetation collected
in holes and crevices on the surface of the rock and has at
the most an average depth of three or four inches.
Having thus dealt roughly with the general features of the
islands we will now consider some of the most characteristic
birds inhabiting the coppet. .
The Bahama Mocking Bird, a fine large species about the
size of our Missel Thrush, though of rather slimmer build, will
probably be the first bird heard by the observer ; he is
common on most of the islands, and the smaller the island the
more abundant he seems to become. East March we visited some
of the islands forming the reef of Abaco, and on landing the
whole island seemed alive with the song of these birds although
not one was to be seen ; however, I crept along under the thick
bush, which covered the interior of the island, and sat down
under a tree where the ground was somewhat clearer. At first I
saw no signs of a bird and only heard the song at some little
distance, then I made out a bird sitting about three feet away,
and then another and another until I was able to count ten,
within a radius of some 15 feet, the majority of whom soon
re-commenced singing.
Some author, with whom I quite agree, once suggested
that observers who could not describe the songs of birds had
best not attempt it, and consequently I will content myself with
saying that the song most reminded me of that of the Song
Thrush, although it struck me as being rather more varied. I was
staying at that time at a sisal plantation ( a ), where the American
species (M. polyglottus ) abounded, and was thus able to compare
the habits of the two. I11 the first place the American bird was
by far the most confiding and lived round the house, even nesting
on an orange tree close to the back door. Everywhere in the
open country where the land had been cleared, sitting on the
topmost bough of a sisal pole (as the tall flower of that plant is

called) might be seen one of these birds pouring out his song
hour after hour apparently to the empty air, but on closer
inspection his mate would be revealed sitting on a lower branch
and doubtless thoroughly approving of the performance. Not so
with the Bahama form: he prefers the thick bush,being aware from
the experience of many generations that a sub-tropical sun can be
hot. Although I have occasionally seen him sing on the ground,
he prefers the upper branches, but generally takes care that there
is a leafy bough just higher than himself to screen him from the
sun and observation.
Another quiet and sombre inhabitant of the coppet, as well
as of the gardens, is the Bahama Sparrow (.Eudheia bicolor ) better
known to aviculturists as the Cuba Finch, with which it is nearly
if not quite identical ib). This bird is remarkably tame and hops
about the verandahs, even coming into the house to pick up the
crumbs from the table. The nest is a very pretty domed
structure placed about four or five feet from the ground at the top
of a long straight sapling. It is made entirely of grass woven
and matted together, with the entrance hole at the side, but
without lining of any kind; the eggs, usually three in number
but sometimes more, are dull white in colour, with brownish
spots toward the larger end.
A most characteristic bird of the Bahamas is the little
Honey Creeper (C. bahamensis) known locally as the Banana
bird. This beautiful little bird, which is about five inches in
length, belongs to a typically West Indian genus, the forms met
with on the various islands differing slightly from each other.
The upper parts are black, the underparts and rump yellow, the
chin and a broad stripe over the eye pure white. The bill is
slightly curved downwards and is moderately broad at the base,
but ends in a sharp point; a noticeable feature of this bird is the
beautiful crimson patch of skin formed by the loose skin of the
gape, and occupying the same relative position as the loose
fleshy gape so conspicuous in the nestlings of many species.
This bird is common throughout the islands both round houses
and in the coppet. It has a peculiar habit of drilling a small
circular hole at the base of the large flowers of the Hibiscus, but
whether for the sake of the honey or insects I cannot say. As a
rule it utters no sound beyond a short shrill note ; in early spring,
however, it has a very sweet little song reminding me not a

throat, is I think invariably treated as distinct from either the Cuba Finch (P. canota),
the Olive ( P. lepula or olivacea), or the Little or Yellow-throated Finch (P. pt/silla).--R. P.

little of our Common Wren. The breeding season is in March
when it builds, I believe, a dome-shaped nest, but I have never
actually taken one. When the young first fly it may be met
with in family parties, being especially partial to a certain
flowering tree (sp. ?), where it may almost always be found in
numbers at the end of April and the beginning of May.
Walking through the thick coppet one is often startled by
hearing at one's ear a clear but short song repeated again and
again with constant frequency. The vocalist will need a long
search to find, as his colour harmonises well with the thick
tangle in which he lives ; his nature is, however, inquisitive,
and instead of retiring, when his domain is invaded, he advances,
keeping, it is true, well out of sight, but nevertheless singing all
the time. If you move to try and get a better view of the
unknown songster, the song will cease only to be repeated a few
seconds later from a more distant bush ; should you, on the
other hand, remain still, a dark green shadow will soon appear
gradually climbing through the thicket by short hops till, as it
emerges from the thickest of the foliage, you recognise the
beautiful little white-eyed Vireo ( V. crassirostris). A little more
patience and you will detect his hen, as curious as her lord, but
lacking his boldness, and peeping out at you shyly from the rank
herbage near the ground. Several species of this genus are
found in the Bahamas ; V. crassirostris appears to be resident,
but in spring and summer the most common and conspicuous
form is V. calidris , the Red-eyed Vireo, a bird by no means as
shy as the previous species, though from its dull colouring very
difficult to distinguish amid the surrounding scenery. Its song,
which is rather monotonous and not unlike that of our common
Chaffinch, is generally&amp;quot; uttered from a moderate elevation in a
thick bush.
When returning home at sunset, twilight being absent in
these latitudes, except at midsummer, it is surprising how,
if one's eyes be closed, one is carried back to the green
lanes of England. The air, especially at spring time, is full
of the songs of many birds; the confused and hurried notes
of the Bahama Woodstar, as the local Humming Bird is
called, the shrill squeak of the Creeper, the harsh scream of the
Rain Crow, and the cooing of the Doves, all mingle to form a
confused but none the less suitable accompaniment to the
Thrush-like notes which ring forth high above all the rest. The
large majority of these last proceed from the Mocking Bird, but
a very fair proportion emanate from a very beautiful species.

known locally as the Blue Thrasher (M. rubripes) (c ). Like the
Creeper, this is also a typical West Indian form, of which the
races on the various islands differ slightly from each other ; it is
of moderate size, having a total length of nine inches, of which
five are made up by the tail. The general colour above and
below is slate grey, the quills are black with broad light
external edgings of paler grey ; the chin, fore part of the throat
and the space in front of the eye are black, while a small patch at
the base of the lower mandible is pure white. A most handsome
finish is given to the general appearance by the bright crimson of
a ring of skin surrounding the eye and of the legs. Although
tolerably common this bird is a great skulker and thus frequently
escapes observation ; it generally moves about on the ground
or in the lower branches of thick coppet, and, when disturbed,
it renders itself, by remaining motionless, quite the reverse of
conspicuous. The male sings, as a rule, at a moderate elevation
in somewhat similar situations to those chosen by the Bahama
Mocking Bird, but if he fancies himself observed he will change
his post so frequently that one is often led a long way before a
glimpse of him can be obtained.
Round many of the trees, especially the cocoanuts and
almonds, may be noticed a series of rings formed by small
punctures in the bark about a quarter of an inch in diameter,
which surround the trunk and are in many cases continued
from near the ground to the top of the tree. These are the
work of the Sapsucker (S. varius.) which in its immature dress
is a very common winter visitor. I have never seen it actually
tapping for the sap, but I presume it works like a typical Wood-
pecker which it closely resembles in structure. Its size is that
of our Greater Spotted Woodpecker ( D . major).
Lying as they do on the edge of the tropics the Bahamas
contain several well-marked forms ol Cuckoos, whose chief
external resemblance to our familiar bird lies in the shape of the
foot, which is zygodactylate, i.e., having two toes pointing
forward and two backwards. The typical Cuckoo note so
pleasing to our ears every spring is unfortunately absent, and the
only note they make is a short harsh scream which has certainly
nothing to recommend it from a human standpoint, though it
may bring delight to the Cuckoo's breast. The general shape
and proportions of these birds are much as in the old world
form, but their flight is weaker and seldom long sustained, so

that their hawk-like appearance is almost entirely lost. There
are three species which are deserving of notice, viz. :-- Coccyzus
minor , Saurothera bahamensis, and Croiophaga ani , but the last-
named we will notice later on when dealing with the fauna of
the pine barrens. Coccyziis minor, a near ally of the American
Yellow-billed Cuckoo, is about 13 inches in total length, of
which the tail forms seven ; the general colour of the back is
olive grey, and of the underparts ochraceous buff, the colour being
deepest on the vent and abdomen ; the bill and legs are slaty
blue, the basal two-thirds of the lower mandible being yellow.
This bird, like most of those inhabiting the coppet, is rarely seen,
but once the note is known it can be easily found as it is quite
tame, not attempting to fly away on one's approach, This species
builds a nest, albeit a somewhat flimsy structure, made of twigs
and resembling that of a Pigeon ; the egg is large for the size of
the bird and of a blue colour, having frequently a rough deposit
of chalk on the outside. According to Audubon the eggs are
laid at intervals, so that in some cases young and fresh eggs are
found together in the same nest. The other species of Cuckoo
which I will notice here is peculiar to the Bahamas, although
nearly allied forms are found in Porto Rico, Hayti, Cuba, and
Jamaica. It belongs to a group of Cuckoos known as Ground
Cuckoos, and runs, considering the shortness of its legs, with con-
siderable agility. In size, shape and colouring it agrees closely
with the previous species, but is considerably larger, having a
total length of 18-20 inches, and a large bare patch of skin above
the eye of a bright red colour. From the habit of uttering its
cry most vigorously before rain it is known locally, in common
with the previous species, as the Rain Crow.
It is a well known law of nature that a similarity of envi-
ronment tends to produce similar modifications and habits, con-
sequently, strange as it may seem at first sight, it is only natural
that one should meet in the palmetto swamps of the Bahamas
with a bird whose habits closely resemble those of the Grass-
hopper Warbler, a common and well known inhabitant of our
fens ; I refer to the Maryland Yellowthroat (G. trichas). This
bright coloured little warbler with yellow breast and, in the male,
a black mask across the crown and sides of the face, is generally
distributed throughout the islands, preferring open swampy
country where the vegetation is low growing but thick and rank.
In such a spot throughout the winter its distinctive note may be
heard repeated, as is usual with birds inhabiting places of dense
growth, with great frequency. It is not so often seen, but has

the habit in common with the Grasshopper Warbler of sitting on
a high stem of grass and, on being disturbed, of diving
down into the thick vegetation whence it can only with
difficulty be made to show itself. From a systematic point of
view these birds form a difficult and intricate group, into the
details of which we need not enter here. Mr. Palmer has lately,
in the Auk for 1900, written a paper on the subject, and seems to
have fairly established the fact that those birds that pass the
summer farthest North have their winter quarters farthest South ;
a feature which is probably common in many species, although
at present it has not been definitely proved for any. There is
another species of this same genus (Geothlypis rostrated) also
inhabiting New Providence, but, curiously enough, it is found in
quite a different situation, being almost entirely confined to the
pine barrens or dry coppet. This species is peculiar to this one
island and is much finer and larger than the migratory form ; it
is, however, much the same in its habits, and is excessively
difficult to find. As is the case with most island races, the legs
have become larger and stronger while the wings are pro-
portionately shorter, being scarcely larger than in the smaller
form.
While still dealing with the small birds, mention should be
made of the Chestnut-headed Warbler ( D. palviarum). This
little warbler is dull brown on the back and dirty white below,
but wears, during the summer, a bright patch of chestnut on the
head. It is common everywhere, especiall&amp;gt; r in and about the
town, where it may be seen in almost every street and garden.
In its habits it is much more of a ground bird than its congeners,
merely perching on trees to roost or when alarmed by passers by,
and, as far as I could judge, it seems to feed almost entirely on
the ground. Dendroeca discolor , the Prairie Warbler, may be taken
as the type of a typical Warbler : it is a bright and sprightly
little bird with a yellow breast and green back, and spends its
time diligently searching the trees and shrubs for insects,
occasionally darting into the air after them, like a Flycatcher,
and the next minute hanging head downwards investigating the
interior of some bell-shaped flower after the manner of a Tit. It
is only a winter visitor but it stays so late, and appears again so
early in the autumn, that I am inclined to suspect that a few
may remain to breed. One more species of interest may be
noticed before we leave the coppet, namely the Grosbeak
( L . violacca ) which is known locally as the Spanish Paroquet.
In this bird the sexes are different, the male being jet black with

a bright patch of reddish brown above the eye, under the chin,
and on the under tail coverts ; in the female and young the black
colour is replaced by olive green. It seems to me in every way
a very shy and uninteresting bird. I did not discover their note
nor did it appear to have any habits worth recording ; they come
in numbers to feed on a tree which bears a small black berry, and
were it not for that habit my acquaintance with it would have
been most scanty, although the bird is by no means rare.

By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
(Continued from page 228).
About a week after "the late sad event" (see p. 227) I
noticed the female Cat-bird very busy repairing her nest. She
is evidently fond of colour, for she stuck several Blue-bonnet's
tail feathers in the outside, and altogether made it a very neat
and natty affair. After about a week of more or less desultory
labour she deposited three eggs, rather larger than the first
clutch, from which I infer that it was her first effort. No bird
could have sat in a more exemplary manner; and on the twelfth
day her efforts were rewarded by the appearance of one little
bird to be followed the next morning by another. The
remaining egg was clear ; and I hoped to save it, but the young
birds kicked it out and broke it the day they left the nest.
One of the most difficult things in the world is to get
these birds to build, lay, hatch, and rear, even half way--as I
know by sad and bitter experience, but I felt that if success was
to be mine I would win it.
The difficulty I knew, of course, would be the feeding.
People may tell you a lot of fairy tales about giving birds raw
meat chopped up and mixed with soft food, to give the old ones
plenty of healthy employment; but the said old birds will not
so much as look at it, much less feed with it. Live insect food
of some sort is the only thing they will feed with, and if they
can't get it the young will be allowed to die incontinent. I felt,
therefore, that I had six weeks of healthy exercise before me ;
and that there would be no need for any summer holiday.
A few days before hatching time you might, one evening,
have seen the Vicar of Micklefield and his youngest son sallying

forth with a bag, a spade, and a sieve. We were not going
poaching--though our appearance was suggestive--we were only-
bent on ant hunting. We walked many miles ; we turned up
acres of ground, or at any rate we thought so, and the result
of all our toils was about a thimble full of eggs. The season
was not advanced enough. However, we went forth again and
had better fortune and good kind souls helped me, and my supply
of live bait, like the widow's cruse, has never failed, though
often on the verge of doing so.
The parent Cat-birds were really admirable ; both seemed
to have recognised from the first that their " reason of existence "
was to tend and foster those two delicate little beings; smooth-
ing the rough places and acting as buffers between them and
the east winds of life.
For some days I felt miserably anxious as to results, as
uncertain of the morrow, as an early Christian in the days of
Nero. On one point, however, I had no anxiety--the weather.
Had the nest been out of doors I should have felt very uneasy as
the weather turned that nasty, that as a friend said to me, "you
would'nt meet a Christian out of doors, unless it was a snipe
or a dispensary doctor."
Early and late the feeding went on, and only, as Longfellow
says, when "The shades of night began to Tall "
did rest come to the weary parents and feeder.
I left the young birds severely alone. About the eighth day
they opened their eyes. They were hatched on July 12th. They
left the nest July 24th. When they came out they were fully
fledged, but had no vestige of a tail. One was very dark in
color; the other much lighter. I inferred that they were cock
and hen, and my surmise has proved correct. The cock bird has
a very indistinct black crown, and a very faint red color under
the tail; the legs of both, which were at first flesh color, are now
turning black like those of their parents.
It is very pretty to see the old birds feed. They always
get above the youngster to be fed, and pop the provender into his
mouth like lightning. When I tell you that they think nothing
of giving each youngster seven or eight mealworms at a mouth-
ful, I am reminded that mealworms, like silver in the days of
Solomon, are nothing accounted of by the parent Cat-birds.
As I stand and look at these young Cat-birds I feel much
like an astronomer who has discovered a new planet; like the

The following lines, which I came across the other day, so
well describe the song of the Cat-bird, that I make no excuse for
quoting them here.
A Cat-bird sat on a mulberry spray,
And told his tale to the night:
He had nothing to tell, but he told it so well,
That the moon she was filled with delight.
She listened all night, and she listened all day,
To the mystic charm, which I might as well say,
Was nothing on earth but a Too-ral-a.
Such a ravishing, rollicking, mellowy strain,
It was half of it gladness, and half of it pain,
Till it seemed she could listen for ever and aye,
To his pretty little too-ral-oo-ral-a.

Columba leucocephala.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
The subject of this paper inhabits the Greater and Eesser
Antilles, Floridor Keys, Honduras, Cozumel Island and the
Bahamas. Mr. Bouhote met with it during his recent expedition
to the Bahamas, and, at my request, has most kindly supplied
me with the following notes ; he writes :--
" The White-crowned Pigeon is, in the Bahamas, essentially a sea-
loving bird, breeding sparingly everywhere, but mostly on very small
islands lying some five to ten, or even twenty miles from the larger islands.
On some of these small islands they nest in thousands, generally rather
late in the year -- about June, and in August shooting parties are organised
against them. When nesting away from the mainland there are two great
flights morning and evening, when the birds go and return from their
feeding places on the mainland. They are very shy, and inhabit the
thickest bush, where they are difficult to see and shoot. The nest is
the usual flimsy structure of twigs, and is generally placed about three or
four feet from the ground near the tops of the bushes, and the eggs in no
way differ from those of the other Columbidce. These birds are not often
met with during the winter in the Bahamas, whether because they retire to
the thickest bush, or because they are migratory I am not prepared to say."

the West Indies, is very seldom brought alive to Europe, and
when, in the autumn of last year (igor) some of these birds were
imported by Mr. Parker, of Frodsham, and offered for sale, I
was tempted to try a pair in my aviar} r . On arrival I found that
the male was unable to fly, and an examination shewed that one
of its wings had been seriously injured, presumably by a shot.
Mr. Parker, however, promised to do his best to secure me
another specimen from the West Indies, and early last spring a
fine male arrived. The female was as wild as a hawk from the
first, but the male, which was said to have been bred in captivity
in Jamaica, appeared at first to be quite tame. He soon, however,
caught the wild fever.
Although very timid, it was evident, soon after the arrival
of the male, that the pair intended to rear a family; but they
were so wild that I hardly expected they would succeed in their
object. Whenever one approached they would fly up with a
tremendous commotion, scaring every other bird almost out of
its wits. However, as the weather became warmer and the birds
were allowed to fly into the outside wire enclosure, the White-
crowns were left more in peace, and they built a nest forthwith.
In each of the first two nests one egg only was laid, and it was
hatched in both cases, but the young bird, when about a fortnight
old, was left, and a new nest begun. In the third attempt two
eggs were laid, which were transferred to a pair of tame pigeons,
which had been kindly lent to me by one of our members for the
purpose. These hatched and fed the young ones also until they
were nearly able to fly, when they apparently discovered that
the ugly little dark grey birds were imposters, and promptly
discontinued to feed them. The White-crowns had, meanwhile,
laid again in a very quiet corner of the aviary, in some faggots,
about four feet from the ground. Here they were entirely
undisturbed, the consequence being that a fine young bird left
the nest on the first of July. It was nearly as large as its
parents, and of a dirty brownish - grey colour all over. No
white was visible on the crown, although the feathers on that
part were slightly lighter than those on the other parts of its
body.
From the first day it left the nest this youngster was as
wild as it could be, dashing itself about whenever anyone went
into the aviary, and it finally succeeded in scalping itself in one
of its mad headlong dashes.
The parents have since reared a pair of nestlings which
were hatched on August 8th, and left the nest about August 30th.

They are not quite so timid as their elder brother (I believe the
first is a male). They are evidently a true pair, as one, presum-
ably the male, is decidedly darker in colour than the other,
which is more or less brownish. The supposed male also has a
decidedly lighter cap.
The White-crowned Pigeon is a very handsome bird,
about fourteen inches in total length. The male is dark slate-
blue, or plumbeous ; the top of the head, and a line below the
eye, spotless white; the nape dark maroon, and below this " a
cape extending upon the sides of the neck of bronzy-green, each
feather distinctly bordered with velvety-black" {Cat. Brit. Musi)
The legs and feet are bright red; the bill carmine-red at the
base, and greenish-white at the tip ; iris pale yellowish-brown.
The female is slightly smaller than the male and much
duller grey ; top of the head dirty white.
I can only recommend the White-crowned Pigeon to those
who have large aviaries. It is undeniably handsome, and breeds
freely if quite undisturbed.
THE AUSTRALIAN WAXBILL.
sEgintha te?nporalis.
By Reginald Phillipps.
This is a very common species in Eastern Australia; and
the name of " Sydney " Waxbill, the one invariably given to the
species in this country, is about as appropriate and sensible as
that of " Bohemian" Waxwing, which was customarily applied in
my younger days to the widely distributed Ampelis garrulus.
The name of Australian Waxbill, which is the one given by our
Zoological Society, is consequently preferable in every respect.
It is sometimes called the Australian Grey Waxbill; in Australia
it is commonly referred to as The Waxbill ; and, in Nests and
Egg s of Australian Birds , Mr. Campbell calls it the Red-browed
Finch.
Although found in Queensland*, New South Wales,
Victoria, and South Australia, the species is not commonly
imported into this country, which is unfortunate, for it is a quiet
The smaller northern bird is possibly a distinct variety or species. -- K.P.

amiable bird in the aviary, moderately hardy, and, as will be seen
from the following account, apparently a free breeder when it is
given a fair chance. Whether it lias actually bred in this
country or not I do not know. Our Vice-President, Mr. Wiener,
who, by the way, was the first to breed the Parrot Finch in this
country, says :--" With me the Australian Waxbill never
attempted to build a nest, whilst Dr. Russ managed to see several
broods hatched, but even lie did not succeed in bringing them
up." Mr. Gedney refers to the breeding of the species in a light
and airy way, but, as he says nothing definite, and makes no
reference to the immature plumage, we feel inclined to think it
likely that he has neither bred this Waxbill himself nor seen
the young bird. Mr. Fillmer, in his little Handbook 011 Waxbills,
which was published in 1897, sa ys *--" Mr. Gedney speaks of the
Sydney Waxbill as being easily bred, but I am not acquainted
with any English aviculturists who have succeeded in breeding
it." Under these circumstances it would seem to be my duty to
place on record and give a short account of the successful
rearing of three young Australian Waxbills in my aviary this
summer.
I have nothing of interest to record of my earlier
experiences of this species, but will confine my story to three
specimens which reached my hands on the 12th October, 1901.
On that day Mr. Carrick, just returned from Australia, sent me a
pair, and threw in an odd female. Whether it was the despised
bird whose domestic life is now about to be immortalized in the
pages of our Magazine, or the true pair which were bought and
paid for, I do not know. Many a time in the history of the
world it has been the despised one that has eventually taken the
front place.
The three birds were in good health and plumage when
they arrived, and retained their good condition all through the
winter ; and 011 the 17th of May of this year they were
transferred to my garden avian'.
In the centre of the aviary there is a lime tree. Last year,
instead of cutting the long shoots, I twisted them round and round
and in and out; and in the early spring of this year I continued the
process, thus forming a really good platform some three feet long
by nearly two broad on which the birds might comfortably build
their nests, the shoots of the year rapidly growing up and
forming a beautiful shelter. I have adopted the same course with
other trees and find the result most satisfactory, quite a number
of species adopting these trees for nesting purposes.

<bodyText confidence="0.99889" page_id="10104348"  page_num="291" year="" vol="">
Immediately they were enlarged, two of the Waxbills
commenced to build in the lime tree, the odd female frequenting
the spot with a motherly desire to assist ; but I fear she was not
greatly encouraged by the happy couple who, after the manner of
" happy couples," thought only of themselves, and had but scant
sympathy with their less happily situated neighbours.
This first nest of the Waxbills came to nought, the poor
birds being flooded out by heavy rain, or discomfited by the cold.
O11 the 19th of June they were again building in the same tree,
but in another place. They were greatly disturbed by the
Bichenos, who certainly tried to turn them out of their nests,
and who reared a brood of young in the same tree, though I am
not sure in which nest. A pair of Ringed Finches also
successfully bred in this tree, or close by, the three broods being
reared to maturity simultaneously. During the whole period,
the Bichenos were incessantly attacking the other four parents,
who, immediately their young were old enough, transferred them
and themselves to the most distant parts of the aviary, leaving the
Bichenos in proud possession of these three nests and of that of
a pair of Blue-breasted Waxbills in a thorn close by who, not
having the quiet steadfastness of the others, allowed themselves
to be ejected from their home at a somewhat early date.
So quietly did the little Australian Waxbills slink off with
their young, and so closely did they keep them in concealment,
that it was not until the 31st of July, when I found myself
within a foot of a startled youngster with his mother when I
crept into the aviary to attend to the water, that I knew for
certain that young had been reared. Since that day I have
frequently seen the young flying about, and occasionally a little
group of three on the ground clamouring round one fond parent,
who continued to feed them long after they were capable of
feeding themselves. O11 one occasion I think I saw four young
birds, but am not sure. The immature Australian Waxbills may
readily be distinguished from the adults by their black bills, the
absence of the red brow stripe, and by their generally duller
appearance. They are little dull birds with a tinge of olive
above, lighter below, with just a little red in the region of the
upper tail-coverts. But they are not uniform in the general
shade of their body colouring, some being darker Ilian others,
presumably a sexual distinction.
Referring to the black bill and the absence of the red brow
in the immature plumage, it is curious to observe what Dr. Russ

says (quoted by Dr. Butler at p. 151 of Fo? r eign Finches) : --
" Young plumage dull earthy-grey, feebly tinted with olive-
green ; underbody dirty yellowish-grey, with grey-black tail
above and below ; only recognisable by the already existing soft
red of the superciliary stripe and croup. The change of colour
I do not know as the young always died before it." Mr.
Campbell (p. 491) is more satisfactory:--"The bill is black in
youthful birds up to the age of three months, or the first moult,
and the red eyebrows. . . . are not donned until the same
age." My young birds have not any visible red on bill or brow,
and the} r are now often plainly to be seen, for, like many young
birds that have never been handled or frightened, they are very
tame, and come freely to the front of the aviary. Occasionally
they may be seen busily hunting amongst the foliage for insect
life ; in wet weather, too, if not cold, they sport amongst the wet
leaves with great delight. The parents have almost disappeared,
so probably are nesting again.
So far as I have been able to see, for I may not yet inspect
the nests, the first nest is of ordinary size, while the second is a
very large long structure. Here again I cannot do better than
quote Mr. Campbell :--" Nest: Bulky, bottle-shaped, with a side
entrance through the neck ; constructed of grasses generally
gathered green ; lined inside with fine grasses and feathers ;
usually situated in the upright forked branches of thick bush or
small tree, often near a stream. Dimensions about 12 inches in
length by a girth in thickest part of 18 to 20 inches. Fggs :
Clutch, usually five or six ; lengthened or pointed oval in shape ;
texture of shell close and fine; surface slightly glossy; colour
pure white."
I think I have nothing special to add respecting these
birds. Perhaps the frequent feeding of the fully fledged young
on the ground is a little unusual. But there was just one little
domestic incident which struck me as somewhat out of the
common. On the 19th of June the male flew on to a high thin
perch with a feather, nearly as large as himself, in his bill. He
was at once joined by the female, and pairing, presumably
unsuccessful, followed. The pairing was repeated, and the two
birds dropped into the shrubbery and disappeared. From first to
last, during the whole time they remained in sight, the male
retained the feather in his bill.
I have been invited by one of my colleagues to suggest a
Medal (of course under the usual restrictions) for breeding the
Australian Waxbill. At first I was disposed to decline the kind

offer, as there seemed to be a possibility that it may have been
previously bred, although such an event remains unrecorded as
far as we know, notwithstanding that it does seem to be such an
easy species to breed. On the other hand, aviculturists have had
their eye on it for such a number of years that any instance of its
successful breeding would hardly have been passed over
unnoticed. And when I observe how many aviculturists of the
first water have not been successful, it slowly dawns upon me
that my little black-billed friends are quite worthy of so great
an honour, and introduce them to the Members of the Avicultural
Society accordingly.
[On August 29 l again saw the male retaining a large feather in his bill under the
circumstances already related. O11 August 31st I first noticed one young bird shewing
red on the brow, and from that day the red tinge 011 bill and brow has been steadily
becoming more apparent 011 all of them. To-day, September 10, I saw the group o
three little ones together, all apparently in perfect health and condition, and all slowly
coming into colour. -- R. P.]

THE BRAZILIAN HANG-NEST.
Icterus jainacciii.
By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
Up to 1897 I always longed to possess a specimen of this
American Starling; but, though I saw one or two in the shops
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976403" page_id="10104350"  page_num="293" year="" vol="">
of various dealers, they were either too high-priced, or had some
defect. Mr. Abrahams once showed me a beauty, which would
come out of its cage and take a mealworm from his hand ; but
he wanted two pounds for it, and that was more than I cared
to give for so common a bird. Some years later I saw a nice-
looking specimen in Mr. Maschke's shop, and, as he asked a
pound for it, I was tempted to buy it; until I noticed that it had,
apparently, been pinioned. It maj^ have been all right, but I
was not inclined to risk it.
In 1897 my friend Mr. Housden brought me a specimen,
somewhat ragged in plumage and a good deal pecked about the
head. It was cheaper than Maschke's bird, but a much more
risky venture ; nevertheless, I had waited so long that I was
tempted to try my luck; and, on the thirteenth day after I
bought it, the bird died.
No more specimens came my way for two years : then Mr.
Housden again assisted me, and this time brought me a really
good specimen, but little damaged in plumage and in good
health, and asked me if I cared to have it: the price was even
lower than that asked for my previous venture ; therefore it may

be taken for granted that I did not hesitate. I have the bird
still, in splendid health and plumage. It is probable that the
Brazilian Hang-nest is chiefly imported from Pernambuco.
According to Burmeister, it frequents the woods in the
interior of Brazil, but not to the south or east. It is seen singly
or in pairs, revealing itself by its many-toned and variable voice :
it feeds largely upon insects and their grubs which it chiefly
seeks for on the ground, but it also feeds upon various fruits.
This Hang-nest first reached the London Zoological
Gardens in i860, and those of Amsterdam in 1885 ; but up to the
present time it appears not to have been bred in captivity. Dr.
Russ had four specimens which, he says, agreed perfectly all the
winter; but, at the approach of spring, had to be separated.
Although most tame and confiding towards their owner, they
appear to be quarrelsome with other birds, and therefore are
usually kept separately.
The brilliant colouring of this bird, in which jet black
contrasts with two shades of cadmium yellow; the wing being
ornamented with a broad belt of snow-white, would alone render
it attractive as a pet; but its bright pale amber eye, the singular
elongate pear-shaped ashy-grey naked patch enclosing it, and the
still paler ashy patch at the base of the lower mandible render it
even more pleasing : then the cool impudence and cleverness of
this bird, which will, at all times, attack its master, if his hand
approaches too near; and will discover a way of opening any
simple fastening to its cage ; the strange attitude assumed when
singing its loud ringing song, and its marvellous tameness, all
render the Brazilian Hang-nest one of the most fascinating of
cage-birds.
My present bird has now been in my possession for more
than three years, and has never had a day's illness. Twice he
opened the fastening of his cage and escaped into my conserva-
tory where he kept me busy, on each occasion, for quite twenty
minutes before I succeeded in netting him : yet the chase and
final capture did not appear to have any effect upon his spirits,
nor did they render him one whit less tame. After the second
escapade I put a second fastening on his door, and took care that
it should be out of the reach of his long bill; but I always have
to watch him when I change his food and water, or he would fly
down and slip past my hand without hesitation. If Hang-nests
were not so mischievous they would make charming house-pets.
I do not think they would either attempt or wish to desert their
owner, but they would certainly destroy lace curtains or woollen

work whenever they came across it, by piercing it with their
bills and then opening their months wide. Mrs. Olive Thorne
Miller noticed this mischievous habit in the case of her Baltimore
Oriole, and I note that my Hang-nest divides all his food up by
the same method.
When the Brazilian Hang-nest is going to sing, he stands
high on his feet, throws back his head, points his bill straight
upwards and raises the feathers on his throat; then he begins to
make a regular clicking sound in his throat, or sometimes a
prolonged rattling sort of guttural note : then, clearly whistled,
comes the sound of Hookcirce, hookaree, repeated from two to
perhaps five or six times, followed by clear resonant notes some-
what reminding one of the Virginian Cardinal's song, the same
note being repeated perhaps eight or ten times, then varied to a
lower tone and again repeated. It ends quite abruptly and the
bird may not be heard again all day, or it may be heard at inter-
vals of perhaps half-an-hour throughout the day. To hear this
bird in its native forest would be very exhilarating.
My bird has been the cause of my smashing several food-
saucers : it is startling, when lifting up a fresh-filled saucer of
food, to feel a sudden dig from a sharp bill on the knuckle of
your thumb: one cannot always bear in mind the length of that
bill, or the rapidity with which it can be brought into play. I
feed upon my usual mixture and fruit, with occasional insects.

Melopelia leucoptera.
By Rosie Aederson.
I.
I purchased a pair of White-winged Doves for 15/- in
1901. The birds were newly imported, and were in good
condition when sent to me. Unfortunately the poor cock injured
his head very badly on the journey. The crown was covered with
dried blood ; and one side of the bird's face was quite pushed in,
though the eye itself was uninjured. It gave the bird a most
curious appearance, as if the face were quite 011 one side. It is
not a bad plan to tack a piece of cotton wool (leaving, of course,
the foundation outside and the edges turned in) to the top of
the inside of the travelling cage when sending Doves by rail, as
it prevents them injuring their heads by striking upwards.

<bodyText confidence="0.997694093023256" page_id="10104353"  page_num="296" year="" vol="">
With care and attention the cock quite recovered ; he is
a good deal larger than the hen, and the sheen on his neck is
much brighter.
The Wliite-winged Dove comes from America and the
West Indies. In colour it is a soft drab, and whitish on the
under parts. The long quill feathers in the wings are dark
brownish black ; and when the wing is in repose there is a very
decided broad white band down it, from which the Dove
evidently derives its name. The feet are bright crimson. On
the neck there is a lovely purple and gold sheen, very beautiful
when seen in the sunlight. Below the ear is a small slanting
black mark. The eyes are bright orange and surrounded by a
sky blue skin which adds greatly to the beauty of the bird.
In the aviary where I have my White-winged are also a
pair of Shamahs and a pair each of Necklace, Senegal and
Bleeding Heart Doves. The size of the aviary is 16ft. by 6ft. 6in.
All these Doves have reared young ones this season, though they
took a little time to each settle in their particular corner. I
think really three pairs of Doves would be quite enough in an
aviary of this size, as when the young birds leave the nest the
place becomes rather full.
About the middle of May, the White-winged began to
nest. They sat well for some time, then forsook the nest,
apparently for no reason ; both eggs were fertile. A second nest
met with the same fate ; and I began to think the birds would do
no good, for they seemed to tire of sitting some time before the
eggs were due to hatch. During this time the cock began to get
very aggressive towards the other doves. He never really
harmed any of them, but used to chase them about. Towards
the end of June a third nest was made, and this time the birds
sat very well. On July 9th I found an empty egg shell on the
aviary floor, and a few days later a pair of fine young ones could
be seen quite plainly. They were very pretty little creatures,
soft drab with brown eyes ; and the white in the tail, and the
band on the wings was very decided. By July 22nd, the first
young one came out of the nest. It was now about a fortnight
old, and between 7 and 8 inches in length, and very long and
slender for its width. Both this young one and the second
(which appeared a day or two later) seemed rather weak in the
feet. It is a great help to young birds just out of the nest to put
a shallow wooden box, without a lid, partially filled with hay,
on the floor. The young bird may not stay in the box. but it
will be very happy sitting on the edge ; and after the warm nest

<bodyText confidence="0.975613585365854" page_id="10104354"  page_num="297" year="" vol="">
this is much better than being on the cold floor. Young Doves
do not seem to understand a branch placed for them on the
ground to perch on, and in this case the nest was 12ft. or more
from the floor, so they could not fly back to it. By August 1st,
both birds stayed out of the nest altogether (vve had once or
twice put them back at night), and by now they are nearly as
long as the hen, but more slender. Both young birds are growing
very fast. They are drab like the parents, but rather darker,
and with no blue skin round the eyes, nor sheen on the neck.
The feet are pale flesh colour, the beak pale pinkish, and the
eyes dark brown. The feathers round the eyes are whitish, with
a wash of pale chestnut below the eye, merging on to the throat.
In one young bird I can just see the dark mark coming below
the eye. The rest of the colouring is just like the old birds. I
have never seen the latter feed the young ones ; they seem to
leave them quite to themselves. A fourth nest has been started,
and the Doves are sitting well. I think it often happens in
breeding foreign Doves that the birds do not settle down to sit
really well until the 2nd or 3rd nest; at least this has been my
own experience.
CORRESPONDENCE.
vSICK GREY PARROT.
Sir, --Can y r ou give me any advice as to the treatment of a Parrot,
which has a most extraordinary growth all round its head ? The latter is
swollen greatly, and the bird is unable to close its mouth.
It is a common Grey Parrot, but it is rapidly becoming quite black,
and has a sort of shiny appearance all over its feathers such as one notices
on the feathers of a Rook. The growth over the eyes resembles that of
a Carrier Pigeon ; but there is a growth of flesh all round each eye, and one
is nearly closed. The illness has been coming on for about three months,
I believe, but am not sure. The bird is a most distressing sight, and I
think the kindest thing would be to destroy it ; but it is not mine, and is a
great favourite with its owner. The growth to me looks like cancer, if a
bird can have such a disease. The bird has been kept on mixed seed, but
lately has been given bread and milk as well. Mary Keene.
The following reply was sent to Mrs. Keene :
From your account of the bird I should say the disease is either
scrofula or cancer, to which latter complaint Parrots are very&amp;apos; subject. I do
not think there is the least probability of its recovery, and were it mine I
should decidedly chloroform it and put it out of its misery. The local
chemist would no doubt administer the chloroform. W. T. Greene.

A PROLIFIC CALIFORNIAN QUAIL.
Sir, --Having kept and reared many of these handsome birds during
the last few years I found the number of eggs laid per nest to vary from
12 to 30.
I only have one pair this year. The cock is an old bird (the first
foreign bird I had, and was given to me by a friend to start me in this
hobby) the hen is a last year's bird.
She has laid sixty-seven eggs, one being deposited each day without
intermission. I have sixty in an incubator, two were left in her nest, one
was laid and broken in the basket on arrival here (so in all probability this
was not the first she had laid) and four have been laid about the aviary and
broken.
I think this should be a record number. There can be no mistake as
I have only the one hen. Arthur. Giee.
DISEASED BEAKS; MEDICINES FOR BIRDS.
Sir, --In the March and April numbers some correspondence
appeared about a contagious cheesy growth which forms at the base of the
mandibles in Gouldian-finches. In my experience this disease is not
confined to Gouldians, but it may attack other birds who may happen to be
lodged in the same cage or aviary as the Gouldians. If taken in time, the
disease is certainly curable. The growth should first be saturated with
a four per cent, solution of cocaine and then scraped with a blunt knife;
hot or very cold water w&amp;apos;ill soon stop any bleeding, and then the affected
parts should be well dusted with equal parts of powdered boracic and
iodoform. For a few days after this, the beaks should be bathed twice
daily with boracic lotion, and the powdered application repeated. It
might also be necessary to repeat the scraping operation if the growth
has not been effectually removed the first time. Any respectable chemist
will supply the medicinal preparations required.
Chemicae Food. --There are many, no doubt, who, like myself, have
with advantage used this preparation in their aviaries during the moulting
season or when any of the birds have appeared out of condition. Lately, I
have been using instead Allen and Hanbury's " Byno-Phospliates " (one
teaspoonful mixed with a gill of water). The birds like this combination
better (being really a malted chemical food), and besides, it has not the
constipating effects on the bowels like the older preparation.

Sir,--I note some correspondence on the feeding of this species.
Perhaps I may claim to have been as successful as most people in keeping
one of these birds in health.
One of my sons brought a hen home from Sydney seven or eight
years ago, and she is still alive and well. She is fed on both hard and soft
food, and has always a supply of canary seed, but does not care for any
other kind. Every day we give her either bread-and-milk or milk pudding
with plenty of sugar; and two or three times a w'eek she has a bit of lettuce
or groundsel : we give her, moreover, an unlimited supply of water, both
for drinking and bathing.

She is the tamest bird I ever had, and will allow me to pull her
about and roll her on the table ; she makes a kind of warbling noise of
satisfaction all the time.
Every summer she has laid two or three eggs. Before laying she gets
uneasy and seedy, and we give her a teaspoonful of brandy in a table-
spoonful of water. This she drinks greedily, and next morning there is an
egg at the bottom of the cage. T. B. WhyTEHEAD.
TOUCANS.
Sir, -- Will you please let me know the following: --
Can Toucans be kept in an outdoor aviary ? How many pairs could
be accommodated in an aviary -- run 15ft. by 12ft., house 12ft. by 9ft. ? How
are they fed? What different kinds could be kept together? Would they&amp;apos;
be likely to nest and what should be provided for them ?
C. Castpe Seoane.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Castle Slonne :
Many years ago I had an Ariel Toucan; and my personal knowledge
of Toucans is limited to this one bird.
During the warm weather it was occasionally&amp;apos; loosed in the garden
aviary; but it was very aggressive, and was usually kept in the house.
And often as I have seen Toucans I have never met with one in an outdoor
aviary, neither have I ever heard of one being so kept in this country.
I can suppose that a well-seasoned bird, in a large well-protected
aviary', might stand a good deal of outdoor aviary life, but do not think it at
all likely that it could stand our winter and spring without artificial warmth.
It is looselv feathered about the body, conies from the tropics, and 1
earnestly hope you will not make the experiment.
I11 the aviary y'ou mention, two non-nesting pairs might be kept
together, or even three; but they are active birds, and like plenty of space,
and, although sociable, are not over amiable in confinement.
I am referring to the true Toucans (Ramphastos), which are large
birds. The Aracaris are much smaller.
In a good sized place, if kept warm enough , I see no reason whatever
why a pair should not breed, for they are not shy birds in captivity&amp;apos;. I think
they all nest in holes of trees; and the more natural the hollow tree-trunk
you could manage to supply them with the more likely would they be to
take to it.
Feed on fruits, vegetables, raisins cut up, boiled egg, and a little raw
meat. Their food should be in lumps or pieces which they can readily pick
up. For instance, bananas, boiled carrots, and the like should be cut up
into lumps. I should also offer them mealworms and cockroaches. If
they will take these, it might be better not to give meat. My Toucan
would dart into the air as straight as a bullet at any small bird flying past
within four or five feet. I am satisfied that they do not live only on fruit
and berries. In our cold climate, too, they require something more
substantial. The warmer they are kept, the less meat food they require.
Young sparrows and mice are better for them than solid meat.
As regards species, I am not able to advise you. Although sociable, I
do not know that different species associate or would live in peace together

within the limits of your aviary. The Toucans are not commonly imported,
and generally one has to take what one can get.
The Ariel Toucan is not uncommon, and is a nice bird. The Toco
Toucan is famous for its large bill. The Short-billed is a handsome bird
and occasionally comes over. There are a great number of Toucans, but only
a few come to England.
Maximilian's Aracari (pronounced Arasaree, with the accent on the

All these are much smaller birds. Reginald Philripps.

NESTING OF BURROWING OWLS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994607194444445" page_id="10104357"  page_num="300" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- When I bought my Burrowing Owls last June, they&amp;apos; had been
kept in a small cage for over eight months, so that when I let them out into
a good sized aviary' their delight was very&amp;apos; great, and they' at once began to
fly about, and make themselves quite at home.
I put in a large heap of sand, of which they took no notice ; then a
happy thought struck me. Knowing that in their own country they are
fond of perching on telegraph posts, I had two very large pine stumps put
into the aviary, one of which had a high flat top on which the Owls speedily
perched themselves. These stumps undoubtedly gave them the idea of
burrowing. Almost immediately they began to dig out the earth, with
vigorous kicks, between the two stumps, choosing a sheltered part with
branches overhanging. They dug for some hours every day', the male bird
doing most of the w&amp;apos;ork. The soil here is very sandy and light, and this
made it easy for them.
On the 12th of June I saw one bird with a leaf in its mouth, so I at
once threw in a handful of leaves and grass--but they' did not touch them.
Then I tried lumps of dried (harbour) seaweed; these the Owls seized upon
at once and carried down the burrow, in beak and claws. Next day&amp;apos; they'
made a second entrance under the stumps, and for a fortnight continued to
carry down the seaweed, often quite large pieces at once, looking so excited
and interested, and when below making queer suppressed noises which
sounded wierdly' up above.
Now the nest was evidently finished, and I was wondering if the hen
had begun to lay, when unfortunately the weather turned very hot, and the
Owls took their food down into the burrows, which was trying, as I dared
not rake it out for fear of disturbing them ; and indeed at this period they
were so fierce, and so unlike their usual gentle tame disposition, that they
would not have allowed me to interfere. .So I was obliged to shut the Owls
up, and commence a raid upon the burrows.
We moved away the stumps, and my husband dug down from two to
three feet but could not find the nest, although he traced the burrows as-
far as he was able, until the sandy earth fell in and destroyed all clue as to
where the nest might be. When the Owls were put back again they looked
much distressed and disappointed, and next day began digging again under
the one and only stump we had left. We filled up the hole, but they' tried
a second and a third time.

It seems very hard that they cannot be allowed to do what is
natural to them, but I can only hope that somebody else will be less
squeamish and more successful with them than I was.

WEAVERS.
Sir, -- I have had a red Weaver for some years, which I always
thought was a Madagascar Weaver until I saw, the other day in . . .
. . . that the Madagascar Weaver had a white beak, while my bird's
beak is black. I have now obtained, I suppose, a true Madagascar Weaver,
but I shall be obliged if you can inform me of the name of the red Weaver
with a black beak. It is a very handsome bird. Can it be the Oryx Weaver ?
.says, in his book, that the Oryx Weaver has an orange beak, and
he also says that the Madagascar Weaver's beak is white. I have also a
black and yellow Weaver which I suppose is the Napoleon Weaver, and
one that is orange and black, with a great ruff round its neck ; and another
is crushed-strawberry-colour with a beak of the same colour. I should be
glad to know the names of all these. Mary Miller.
The fallowing reply was sent to Lady Miller :
When out of colour, the beak of the Madagascar Weaver is horn
brownish ; but, when the bird is in its crimson livery, the beak is black.
There can be little doubt that your first bird is a true Madagascar Weaver
(Foudia madagascariensis) (d). If you have a red Weaver with a white beak,
I do not know what it can be.
The Oryx or Grenadier Weaver (. Pyromelana oryx ) also has a black beak
when in colour; but it is rather a fiery orange, than crimson bird.
Your black and yellow bird is probably the Napoleon Weaver (P.
afra); the black and orange bird is doubtless the Orange Weaver (P.
fra?iciscana). and I should think the 'crushed strawberry' bird is Russ'
Weaver ( Quelea russi), a form of the Red-billed Weaver (Q. quelea) in which
the black face-mask is undeveloped : the female of the latter has an orange
beak. A. G. Butler.
OWLS.
Sir, -- I shall be grateful for information about Owls.
I had a pair of Brown Owls; one unfortunately got out and was
killed by my fox terrier. Through a friend I procured another nestling, but
it is a Long-eared Owl. I am anxious to know if they would agree if placed
in the same enclosure.
What food should they eat ? I catch mice occasionally, which they
seize frantically ; I also give them sheep's liver; they do not seem to care
for anything else. I am afraid they will not keep in health unless their
food is more varied. M. Husband.
The following reply was sent to Miss Husband :
You do not state the size of the enclosure in which you keep your
Owls. If large enough, the two birds will probably do very well together,
at any rate until the spring, especially as they are young -- at least so I
understand from your letter. I have myself kept (single birds) a Brown, a
White, a Long-eared and a Short-eared Owl together, and they did not

quarrel; but tlieir aviary was large, with plenty of secluded nooks, so that
each Owl could select its own home without any bad feeling being aroused.
But you must be judicious when feeding them. If you should have
one mouse, and toss it down to the Long-eared Owl, the Brown Owl (if a
good specimen) would at once dart down, and a battle might be expected.
Cut the mouse in halves, toss a half to each, helping the most savage of the
two birds first.
Remember that both these Owls are nocturnal, and should have dark
corners in which to pass the day. Fix up a stout perch in every dark
corner; a natural bough with the bark on is best, with all small side boughs
removed ; the higher it is fixed up the better. They should be fed towards
evening, and remains of food should be removed in the morning.
Feed on mice (field mice or voles from preference, but house mice
will do very well), rats, birds, baby rabbits, -- almost any small creature
including beetles, etc. When these fail, buy a rabbit and cut it up, giving
the skt/i and fur as well as the meat. Also get fowls' heads, necks, etc.,
from the poulterer. When these fail, you must fall back upon raw meat in
some form or another. But you must bear in mind that they must have fur
or feather, which eventually they will eject in the form of castings. If you
neglect this, not only will their health decline, but one, impelled by an
irresistible craving, might even hurl itself upon the other for the sake of
the "feather." If the worst comes to the worst, roll up small pieces of raw
meat in fine feathers of any kind, and place in their house.
If they leave much food until the morning, or seem to be getting fat
and lazy from over-eating, cut the supply a little short. Experienced
persons tell us to starve them one day a week. Personally I have never
gone quite so far as that---but perhaps I am wrong.
Supply fresh, clean water every evening, both for drinking and
bathing purposes. If they should seem at all disposed to be quarrelsome,
give a separate bathing pan to each bird. Rkginald PhillippS.
THE AGE OF BIRDS.
Sir, -- The age of birds, especially in a wild state, is a matter about
which little or no reliable evidence can be found, so that I think the follow-
ing note from Country Life worth inserting in the Magazine.
"Sir, -- Your correspondent may be interested in the story of a Robin that built in
Bristol Cathedral for fifteen years. It usually perched on one of the pinnacles of the
great organ during divine service, and would occasionally accompany the solemn strains
of the music with its clear, trilling voice. It was so tame as to follow the verger to be fed.
It died during the severe winter of 1889, and the minor canon of the cathedral, Mr. Samuel
Love, composed a poem on it, a copy of which I have. -- B. A."
There is 110 positive proof that through the fifteen years it was the
same individual, but as it became tame enough to follow the verger there
is great presumptive evidence that it was, as a fresh bird would have
required coaxing, which could not fail to have been noticed.
Of course the idea with which the note was originally written,
although very interesting as a subject, does not have much point in the
present instance. The pinnacle of the organ was probably chosen as being
the most convenient perch when the church was full of people, and the
'accompanying of the strains of music ' is a common occurrence with most
birds, which love to sing when a noise, not necessarily musical, is made.

Nevertheless some interesting results might accrue if some of our members
would try the effect of certain notes on their various birds. I fancy a violin
would be the best instrument to play on, and I would suggest playing out
of sight of the bird, at the back of the cage, and watching its motions by
means of a mirror. J. LEWIS Bonhote.

<bodyText confidence="0.998573023255814" page_id="10104360"  page_num="303" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- Referring to your enquiry re "Young birds feeding other young
of the same brood," as already recorded, two broods of Gouldians were
reared in my out-door aviary last year from one pair. The first brood of
four helped their parents rear the second--six in number; and a very
pleasing sight it was to see one of the elder absorbed watching a parent feed
one of the younger. Off would pop the parent, up would sidle the young-
ster and repeat the performance it had so intently watched, much to the
gratification of itsyounger relative. Whether the feeders were confined to
the first brood or assisted by the more robust members of the second I
cannot say, as I did not regard the incident as being anything remarkable.
The young branchers did not appear able to distinguish their parents from
the other adult Goulds. At all events, they never lost an opportunity of
beseeching to be fed by them. Their appeals, however, were always ignored.
I may be allowed to state for the information of interested members
that young males of this species begin in earnest to assume adult plumage
when fourteen months old. I say in earnest, because as far back as Dec.
small ticks of adult colour were observable on some of them. The young
hens still retained the modest garb of the nestling, although they were
undergoing treatment for egg-binding when eleven months old. In support
of my observations in the matter of colour I will quote what a lady member
wrote to me on the 15th of August : " Baby Gouldian is a beauty, day by day
he becomes brighter, and is in perfect health. I never saw such a cheery
little fellow, he sings from morning till night. His back is quite green,
and the mauve feathers are coming in his breast, the black on the head
has not appeared as yet."
The weather this year has been all against successful nesting opera-
tions, but, as I write, a fine brood of Rufous-tails are being reared by their
parents in a cage indoors. Should they reach maturity I suppose it may be
considered going one better than having done the same thing in an out-
door aviary last year. At an early date I must send you for publication a
very necessary warning re this species, when the feeling of propagating
their kind is on them. Agf. E. Nicholson.
A LAME CRANE.
Sir, -- My young Demoiselle Crane has been most unsatisfactory,
always lame as if from a strain. It can walk only very slowly, and never
flies or dances like the other; and lately I have noticed a corn or something
on the foot. It very seldom stands, but either rests on its " elbows" or lies
down ; but it eats well, and is lively in hunting for insects. If we could do
anything it would be a great comfort, as the poor bird would enjoy life so
much more. Octavia Gregory.
The following reply was sent to Mrs. Gregory.
The Demoiselle Crane should be caught up, and the lame foot
examined. If it is a corn, I should think a mild application of nitrate of

silver could do no harm ; and I should keep the bird on grass; or, if that
be impossible, on peat moss litter frequently sprinkled with water (at any
rate not on sand). If the toe be swelled, and no thickening of the skin
noticeable, I should fear that it may be due to some constitutional weak-
ness (akin to gout), such as some Pheasants and the northern Falcons (Ice-
land and Greenland) are so liable to, and which is much more difficult to
treat. If any matter (pus) be suspected, and the swelling be ripe for open-
ing, a sharp clean lancet should be used, and the bird must be kept on clean
ground, or grass if possible. W. H. ST. QUINTIN.

IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MAGAZINE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993519717948718" page_id="10104361"  page_num="304" year="" vol="">
Sir, --At the meeting of the Council on July 4th, it was agreed that
the front of the cover of the monthly Magazine should be rendered more
attractive and suitable by the addition of a line drawing of a bird, the
whole design to be executed by some well-known artist.
For my part I am perfectly satisfied with the plain, suitable green
paper covering of the Magazine that we have hitherto had ; it answers
admirably for the purpose for which it is intended, namely, to preserve the
interior of the Magazine.
I, possibly as some of the other members do, keep all my Magazines
in their original published state. Members who wish to have their Magazines
bound are able to obtain covers and get them bound at the publishers for a
small sum.
I think that it would be far better if the money, that is intended to
be spent for outward show and decoration of the cover of the Magazine,
was spent in improving the interior by giving an extra coloured plate
or a good engraving of some bird, 011 which articles are written from
time to time in the Magazine, or of the rarer birds that some of our
wealthy members possess, who, I am sure, would willingly help to make the
Magazine more one of useful knowledge and information rather than one
of outward decoration. Certainly some of the Magazines of the present
day have artistic and decorative covers, but these Magazines are for the
millions. Professor Herkomer&amp;apos;s " Magazine of Art," of 1SS0, had a lovely
" wood-cut " cover.
An extra coloured plate or an engraving would be preserved, and not
get roughened or dirty as would an engraving on the cover of the Magazine.
In the case of those members who have their Magazines bound the
cover would go the way of all covers, namely, to the waste-paper basket.
I am very pleased to see the new rules brought out by the Council,
and wish the Magazine every success which it deserves. E. G. Salt.
[We are sorry that I)r. Salt does not approve of the decision of the
Council, to render the cover, as well as the interior of the Magazine, more
attractive than heretofore. It is, however, too late now to make any
change in what the Council have decided upon, even if it were desirable to
do so, and we have little doubt that when the first number of Vol. IX.
appears next month, the majority, at any rate, of our members will be well
pleased. We would remind Dr. Salt that no less than seven coloured
plates have been given with the present volume, besides numerous black
and white plates, so we think there can be little to complain of in the way
of illustrations. -- E d.]

THE SOCIETY'S MEDAL.

<bodyText confidence="0.889997" page_id="10104362"  page_num="305" year="" vol="">
The Society's Medal has been awarded to Mrs. Johstone, for having
bred the Barnard's Parrakeet, Bamardius baniardi, and to Mrs. Howard
Williams, for having bred the Ringed Finch, Sticloptera annulosa , it is
believed for the first time in the United Kingdom in each case.
Miss R. 'Alderson has succeeded in breeding the White - winged
Zeuaida Dove, Melopelia leucoptera, as already announced.
The Rev. C. D. Farrar has succeeded in breeding the American Cat-
bird, Galeoscoptes carolinensis. Members must be careful not to confuse this
species with the famous Australian Cat-birds ( Adlurcedus ), which are closely
related to the Bower-birds.
Mr. Phillipps has succeeded in breeding the Australian (Sydney)
Waxbill, sEgintha temporalis, and the Australian Blue Wren, Malttrus cyaneus.
Articles on the breeding of all these species have now been published.
A further account of the Blue Wren will appear in November.
The Society proposes to award a Medal, in each case, for the breeding
of the several species it is believed for the first lime in the United Kingdom.
If any previous instance should be known to any of our members or readers,
it is requested that they will be so good as to communicate at once with the
Honorary Secretary.
NEW MEDAL RULE.
"The parents of the young must be the bond fide property of the
breeder. Any evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only
disqualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or other species.
" In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final."

It has been found during the year that, when the Society issues what
may be called a Popular Number of the Magazine, it is freely purchased by
the public, other less attractive numbers being disregarded.
The result is a serious loss to the Society, as not only are the less
saleable numbers left on hand, but a large number of complete sets of
twelve are broken up and rendered almost valueless.
In order to protect the Society, it has been decided to increase the
price of each monthly number from i - to 1/6, commencing with our next
issue.
Members of the .Society who shall have paid their subscriptions will,
of course, continue to receive one copy of each number free, as in the past.

The Fauna of South Africa.
Edited by W. L. SCLATER, M.A., F.Z.S.,
Director of the South African Museum, Cape Town.
Under this title is being published a series of volumes dealing with
the Fauna of Africa south of the Zambesi.
The volumes will be of uniform size and arrangement, with numerous
illustrations in the text, the greater number of which will be specially
prepared for this purpose. The price of the volumes will vary from
15s. to 21s. each net.
The northern limits of South Africa, as treated of in this work, will be
a line drawn from the Cunene River on the West to the Zambesi at the
Victoria Falls, and thence along that River to its mouth. Within it will,
therefore, be enclosed the British Colonies of the Cape, Natal, Transvaal
and the Orange River, the southern half of the Chartered Company's
territory, German South-west Africa, and that portion of Portuguese East
Africa which lies south of the Zambesi.
The following volumes have already appeared.

The Fauna of South Africa.
Edited by W. L. SCEATER, M.A., F.Z.S.,
Director of the South African Museum, Cafe Town.
Under this title is being published a series of volumes dealing with
the Fauna of Africa south of the Zambesi.
The volumes will be of uniform size and arrangement, with numerous
illustrations in the text, the greater number of which will be specially
prepared for this purpose. The price of the volumes will vary from
15s. to 2 is. each net.
The northern limits of South Africa, as treated of in this work, will be
a line drawn from the Cunene River on the West to the Zambesi at the
Victoria Falls, and thence along that River to its mouth. Within it will,
therefore, be enclosed the British Colonies of the Cape, Natal, Transvaal
and the Orange River, the southern half of the Chartered Company's
territory, German South-west Africa, and that portion of Portuguese East
Africa which lies south of the Zambesi.
The following volumes have already appeared.
