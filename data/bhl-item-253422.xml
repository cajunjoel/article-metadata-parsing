The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send
a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly in-
dependent of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids,
or of local races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2^ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

THE KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM
GOMES OF AGE
By Edward Boosey

Nowadays, if we are to contribute to the magazine at all, most of
us have perforce to emulate the aged and live in the past. This, while
it makes one feel distressingly like a doddery old gentleman poring
over his memories in the twilight, is nevertheless a pleasanter occupa-
tion than contemplating the bleak present and no less bleak future
outlook for aviculture in this country.
It therefore seemed to me that, as the Keston Foreign Bird Farm
has recently come of age, now would be the most appropriate time to
record its history from its very modest beginning--four weather-
beaten aviaries surviving from my boyhood days--right up to the
present time.
My partner, Alec Brooksbank, and I started the farm in the year
1927 at a time when no other venture of its kind existed, at any rate
in the British Isles.
The site chosen proved to be an ideal one for the keeping and
breeding of foreign birds, and consisted of a long strip of rough
meadowland, of about one acre in extent, on a southern slope. The
two ends of the strip faced respectively east and west, so that the
whole site lay, as it were, broadside to the sun, with a thick laurel
hedge along the bottom and a thicket of blackthorn along its eastern
boundary. The top, facing north, was admirably protected by the
continued upward slope of the land, reinforced by a dense belt of
large wild cherry trees.
This site was gradually made into separate terraces, each terrace
being stepped down about 18 inches from the one above, so that ample
light and sun could penetrate to all the aviaries.
In 1932 the rapid expansion of the farm necessitated the acquisition
of more land, and we were able to purchase an adjoining 8-acre
meadow. The aspect of this, however, was very much more exposed
than the terraces, and the aviaries had to be specially designed to
ensure maximum protection from the prevailing winds. Although the

<bodyText confidence="0.999203911111111" page_id="56287736"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
breeding results on this field have, on the whole, been very satisfactory,
nearly all our most notable successes in the breeding of the rarer
Finches and Parrakeets took place on our original piece of land, the
Finches, particularly, appreciating its warm and sheltered situation.
Unfortunately, at the time of the Battle of Britain, the terrace
aviaries were blitzed, and so badly damaged that since then we have
kept all our birds on the field, where we endeavour to keep the aviaries
in reasonably good condition by using the wood from the blitzed
terrace aviaries for repair work.
Our next door neighbours are Cook's chicken farm and only 3 miles
away is the famous Biggin Hill fighter aerodrome, and it was really
the combination of these two factors which caused the destruction of
our terrace aviaries. What actually happened on that memorable and
particularly lovely September day in 1941 was that the Luftwaffe
dive-bombed Biggin Hill aerodrome in daylight, and when we
eventually emerged from our slit trench on the field we found that
the German planes had also dropped a stick of bombs on our next
door neighbour's extensive range of " battery " chicken houses, which
were only about 50 feet from our terrace aviaries, having possibly
mistaken the former for part of the aerodrome.
Now, however, to return to the early years of the farm.
The year 1929 was our first " selling " season. Of the Parrakeets
we then possessed, Manycolours, Barrabands, and Brown's successfully
reared young and a number of Budgerigars were bred, including
Blues, Cobalts, Mauves, and what we then called Grey-washed Whites,
which were doubtless what are now known as White Mauves. In those
days, of course, true Greys had yet to be produced, the nearest thing
to them being young Mauves when they first fledged, which, if one
was breeding them for the first time, gave one the impression that one
had bred a real Grey at last. The only Parrakeets which failed to
breed were Malabars.
I should like to say here that nearly all the rarer pairs of Parrakeets
with which we started the farm had been most kindly and generously
given to me by the present Duke of Bedford, who was at that
time Marquess of Tavistock, and to place on record the deep debt of
gratitude we owe him for this and many subsequent acts of kindness
and encouragement. I first met Lord Tavistock about the year 1923,
and even in those early days frequently discussed with him the
possibility of starting a Foreign Bird Farm, and when, four years
later, the Keston Foreign Bird Farm actually came into being, he
immediately took--as indeed he still does take to this day--the keenest
personal interest in the farm's progress.
When we first started the farm my partner and I decided to each
confine ourselves to separate branches of bird breeding and, while we
both took a hand at the Gouldians, generally speaking he was entirely
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.969618" page_id="56287737"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
E. BOOSEY-THE KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM COMES OF AGE 3
responsible for the excellent breeding results with the Budgerigars,
Diamond Doves, and Finches, as well as the acclimatizing of imported
birds for sale and the general business management of the farm, while
I concentrated on the breeding of the Parrots and Parrakeets and also
various odd pairs of miscellaneous species we had at different times,
such as Occipital Blue Pies, Hunting Gissas, Rufous-bellied Niltavas,
Dhyal Birds and Shamas, and also Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeons
and Jamaican Ruddy Quail Doves.
The 1929 breeding season proved an excellent one for Finches, four
pairs of Red-headed Gouldians successfully rearing twenty-three young
ones, while about thirty pairs of Zebra Finches reared an average of
nearly ten young per pair. I have no actual record of the number of
breeding pairs of Diamond Doves we then possessed, but fifty young
birds were reared so our breeding stock must have been considerable
as so many--I would even say the majority--of Diamond Doves are
such rotten parents. It is true some of the pairs we have had have
been perfect paragons, successfully rearing every young one they
hatched, but only too many pairs either forget altogether that they
have young ones to feed and when they eventually remember a few
days later, find to their astonishment that the two small cold corpses
in the nest have no further use for food ; or else continue to feed the
first to fledge, leaving the younger one still in the nest to perish from
starvation.
By 1930 our stock had grown considerably. We had quite a number
of the rarer Parrakeets and Finches, and the following is a record of
the largest number of young reared by any one pair during the
season :--
Parrakeets. --Brown's, seven (first nest four, second three) ; Many-
colours (which did far better in subsequent years), three ; Barrabands,
four ; Turquoisines, four ; Elegants, four ; Budgerigars, sixteen (first
nest three, second five, third eight).
Finches .-- Ruficaudas, eleven (first nest five, second six) ; Long-tailed
Grass Finches, ten (two nests of five) ; Gouldians, six (they had, at
the time of writing, a further brood of four in the nest which, if
I remember rightly, were all reared) ; Java Sparrows, seven (first nest
three, second four) ; Diamond Doves, fourteen (seven nests of two).
The following did not breed : Malabar and Hooded Parrakeets and
Pectoralis Finches.
During 1931, young of the following species were bred : Parrakeets :

Among the Parrakeets one outstanding success was the rearing of
eleven young ones by two pairs of Manycolour Parrakeets, six young
being reared by a fifteen-year-old pair and five by one of their sons
mated to an imported hen of particularly good colour. There are
clearly two races of Manycolour, one a rather dark green and the
other the beautiful emerald green race in which all the other colours
are correspondingly more vivid and, incidentally, rather more extensive
in area.
The hen of the old pair belonged to the brightly coloured race, the
cock to the other darker green one, and fortunately this young male
took after his mother and was about the loveliest cock Manycolour I
have ever seen, though we have one here as I write given to us by the
Duke of Bedford since the war which certainly runs him very close
in the brilliance of his emerald green body colour, though the scarlet
patches on the flanks are rather smaller.
Brown's Parrakeets again did very well indeed, in fact, the per-
formance of the old pair was certainly the outstanding achievement
of this or any other season, for they reared no less than nine remarkably
fine youngsters, five in their first nest and four in the second.
Altogether this pair fully reared quite thirty young ones during the
time they were at the farm, which constitutes a truly remarkable
record in view of the fact that Brown's is not only the rarest but also
the most difficult of all the Broadtails to breed, the main reason for
this difficulty being that they alone of their family--like the Hooded
Parrakeet among the Psephoti--in practically every case refuse to adapt
themselves to our seasons, insisting instead on going to nest in late
autumn, which is always quite hopeless, as even if any young ones are
reared in a heated shelter they are usually rickety degenerate specimens.
Before our pair bred so successfully at Keston, Brown's had only
ever been bred on two previous occasions : once right at the
beginning of the present century and again between the wars by
Lord Tavistock.
Elegant Grass Parrakeets which had bred successfully the previous
season failed to rear young in 1931, but pairs of newly-acquired
Blue-wings and Bourkes were successful. Incidentally, the breeding of
the latter was still something of an event in those days when Bourkes,
having only just started--after a hiatus of many years--to reappear
as aviary birds, were still considered great rarities. Later on, of course,
in the halcyon years just before the war, they were to become the
most widely-bred of all the Grass Parrakeets, even successfully rearing
broods at Zoos !
Turquoisines, to my sorrow, as I have always thought them
particularly lovely little Parrakeets, never for some reason did par-
ticularly well here, though small broods of young were reared during
this and one or two subsequent seasons. Not only were the broods

E. BOOSEY--THE KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM GOMES OF AGE 5
disappointingly small, but the parent birds themselves never seemed
to flourish for any length of time. It may, of course, be that we were
unlucky in the particular pairs that happened to come into our
possession, but personally I think it was more probably just " one of
those things ", the most likely explanation being that this particular
locality just did not happen to suit them. I should very much like,
however, to try one day some from a different strain, as it seems
difficult to believe that Keston--where all the other Grass Parrakeets
do so well--should not also suit Turquoisines.
I noted this year that we possessed and had bred four of the seven
known species of Grass Parrakeet, and that it seemed extremely
unlikely that the remaining three, namely the Rock Grass, the Orange-
bellied, and the Splendid, would ever again come into the hands of
aviculturists. This, however, proved not to be the case, for we heard
shortly after that Mr. Harvey, of Adelaide, Australia, had obtained
about six Splendids, and later on Lord Tavistock was to send us a
pair of Splendids from which we bred the first young ever to be bred
in Europe.
He also lent us some Rock Grass Parrakeets. These, however, got
no further than the laying and incubating of infertile eggs owing
mainly, I think, to the fact that Rock Grass seem always for some
unexplained reason to become so grossly over-fat in aviaries. While
we were naturally sorry not to breed them, I am bound to confess
I always think them quite the dullest of all the Grass Parrakeets both
as to temperament and colour.
Splendids, on the other hand, while equally rare, present a complete
contrast, for not only is there no lovelier Grass Parrakeet but there is
surely no more exquisite little bird of any kind in the world. To
possess, and even one day perhaps to breed Splendids, was always
my chief boyhood's dream, and that I was eventually permitted to
achieve both is something for which I shall always be grateful.
The only Grass Parrakeet we never possessed at Keston was the
Orange-bellied, and as far as I know it has never been imported into
Europe, though I believe specimens are, or were, living in Australian
aviaries. That this Grass Parrakeet is beautiful and quite distinct in
colour was evident from a skin which the well-known Australian
aviculturist, Alan Lendon, brought down for us to see during a visit
to the farm. As far as I can remember it was of a remarkably rich
though considerably darker green than the rest of the family, and this
made an admirable foil for the brilliant orange patch on the lower
belly.
Now to turn to the Finches : these were delayed by the cold wet
spring ; nevertheless, the final results proved more satisfactory than
we originally anticipated. By now we had further increased our
breeding stock of Zebra Finches and a large number of young ones

were reared. All our Ruficaudas nested, but only once, not being, as
was usually the case, double-brooded. Some were successfully reared
under Bengalese foster parents. We found with Ruficaudas that while
most parents require live food when breeding, a minority will rear
their young on dry seed and flowering Rye grass alone.
Another Finch, and one which was very seldom bred, and in many
ways a most difficult subject, namely the Australian Cherry Finch,
was successfully bred during the season. My partner's most spectacular
breeding results, however, were undoubtedly with the Longtailed
Grass Finches, all of which did remarkably well, one pair alone fully
rearing sixteen young ones during the season, both the parents having
been bred here in 1931, while an ordinary hen mated to a Heck's
cock reared ten youngsters.
It was during the late spring of 1931 that we had a whole aviary
of breeding Gouldians stolen as well as all their nests and eggs. This
was a bad setback just when we had managed to get together a really
good breeding stock of these lovely Finches and, moreover, was
particularly galling as all the pairs stolen had been imported in
perfect condition the same spring and instead of dropping into a moult
had surprised and delighted us by going to nest straight away.
Fortunately, however, we still had some breeding pairs left, and in
the end quite a fair number of young were reared.
The remaining breeding success to record was with Jamaican Ruddy
Quail Doves, a species at one time not uncommon but which had
become very rare owing to the depredations of the introduced
mongoose on its native island of Jamaica.
These are rather attractive and extremely terrestrial little Doves,
and I well remember our consternation when their first two young
ones were missing from the nest (a rudimentary affair in a flat
earthenware flower pot saucer) only a few days after they were
hatched. We need not have worried, however, for they were found
running about on the ground quite happily with their parents, and
though only about a week old, were even capable of perching on low
branches.
As far as I can remember the young Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Doves
we bred a year or two later also left the nest at a very tender age and
were equally agile and capable of fending for themselves at an age
when most young Pigeons and Doves are still helpless squabs sitting
pressed tightly together side by side on the nest and entirely dependent
on their parents.
It was towards the end of this year that we acquired the 8-acre
meadow to which I have referred earlier in this article, and which
gave us the extra space we so badly needed for the rapidly expanding
farm.
By this time we had acquired pairs of Pennants, and Stanley

THE BIRD COLLECTION AT THE CHESTER ZOO

During the last year I am pleased to say we have at last been able
to make a start on the avicultural side of the zoological collection,
and I thought it might be of interest to members of the Avicultural
Society to know what we have done, and hope to do in the future.
During the war our bird population fell considerably from a variety
of causes, from bombing to the shortage of suitable food, and it was
not until 1948 that we were able to give any serious attention to
building new aviaries.
The Chester Zoo has altered considerably and is now nothing like
it was at the outbreak of war in 1939. In those days the Zoo covered
less than ten acres, to-day it covers nearly forty acres and several
more acres remain to be developed. Our object is to give as much
room as possible to all the exhibits, and this includes the birds as
well as the other animals.
In the spring of 1949 we erected a range of seventeen aviaries,
designed mainly for the breeding of Parrakeets. They are long and
narrow so as to allow the birds to retire well back from the public.
Sixteen of these aviaries are 4 feet wide and 40 feet long, and between
8 feet and 9 feet high.
A flower border runs the whole length of these aviaries to keep the
public from getting too close to them, for, as I have just stated, these
are essentially breeding quarters. The birds were introduced too late
in the season to give many results during 1949, but we did succeed
in breeding Leadbeaters ; Cockatoos, Lutino Ring-necks, Red-rumps,
and several others laid but were not properly settled.
The seventeenth aviary is 40 feet deep, 9 feet high, and 12 feet wide,
and it was in this aviary that the Leadbeaters reared their young.
We have moved these birds now to the new Parrot House on account
of their destructive habits, and in their place I propose trying out an
experiment of keeping three or four pairs of Princess of Wales
Parrakeets together.
I have just said that we have moved our Leadbeaters to the Parrot
House. This is a new building and does not by any means resemble
the old fashioned Parrot House, which is still in existence in so many

zoos to-day. Nothing makes me feel so miserable as to see some of
the world's loveliest birds confined in a cage wherein they cannot
even stretch their wings, let alone fly, or fastened by a chain to some
perch, which they are compelled to sit on for the rest of their lives.
I do appreciate the need of room in many zoos, but very often so
much space is wasted above, below, and between the cages when with
a little thought and planning each bird could have at least three times
as much room in the same sized house. However, it is sometimes very
difficult to rearrange existing buildings because of the light factor,
and this to me is a very important point. So many of our birds must
miss the clear light of their native lands very much, and I feel we
ought to try and give them as much brightness as we possibly can, at
the same time providing them with ample shelter from the rays of the
sun if the birds do not require them.
This new Parrot House at Chester Zoo is an experiment, and we
may find that we will have to modify some of our ideas as time goes
on, but I have been keeping Parrots and Parrakeets now for a good
many years, and have incorporated many things which I have found
these birds require.
The main building is 64 feet long and 28 feet wide with aviaries
on either side. On the left are eight strongly built aviaries each
approximately 8 feet square and 11 feet high, and each aviary is
covered almost entirely by corrugated " Perspex " so as to admit as
much light as possible. Each of these cages has an outside flight 8 feet
by 16 feet and 9 feet high.
On the opposite side are the same number of cages, not quite as
high but a foot deeper, that is, 8 feet by 9 feet. These are also roofed
with " Perspex ", but are not yet completed ; when they are, which
we hope will be about February, each cage will have an outside flight
the dimension of which we have not yet decided on, as one or two
other factors have to be taken into consideration, but they will
certainly not be less than 20 feet in length, possibly 30 feet or more.
The building is constructed of aluminium alloy staunchions filled in
with breeze blocks, and the public passage is roofed with corrugated
asbestos. The wire is all " Weld-mesh " and should stand the hard
wear that some of the Parrot species give to their cages. The house is
heated with hot water pipes, and some are fixed in the roof to reduce
the risk of condensation. The building is well ventilated and although
our main object has been to meet the requirements of the birds, the
public have room and space to view the exhibits, and I am hoping
that some of the birds will find their quarters congenial enough to
breed in. We have also introduced fluorescent lighting, which is used
on dark days and when the days are short.
We have several other aviaries placed in different parts of the Zoo,
but a range of four built about four years ago have been very successful

as breeding aviaries. In these, Rock Peplars, Rosellas, Red-rumps,
Cockatiels, and Ring-necks have bred and reared numerous young,
despite the fact that they were very exposed and had no closed-in
shelter.

The majority of these species are in pairs ; in some cases we have
two or three pairs.
A Waders' aviary is about to be built and we shall have to provide
a range of Bird of Prey aviaries before the spring as our Vultures, etc.,
are occupying a site which is required for Leopards, Pumas, and
such like cats.
Although the Zoo grounds contain several natural ponds, we have
added a lake and other pools so that we can get, as time goes on,
a collection of Waterfowl. So far we have only the following species :--

Chinese (domestic variety), Mute Swan.
There are a large number of Ducks and Geese which are not pure
bred, and these we are weeding out as our stock of pure bred specimens
increase.
Although our present collection apart from the Waterfowl is mainly
birds of the Parrot family we hope during the next few months to
build aviaries for many other species of the feathered world, and one
of the Society's ambitions is to build a large tropical house where
delicate tropical birds can be kept amongst their own tropical
vegetation. But Chester Zoo is only still in its infancy, and accom-
modation has to be provided for many of the larger animals, and here
again we are trying to give them all the best possible accommodation
in pleasant surroundings.

(Ara nobilis cumanensis )
By E. N. T. Vane
Comparatively little appears to have been written to date about
Macaws either in captivity or freedom. The breeding of Noble
Macaws in captivity for the first time in this country sounds a very
grand achievement, because all Macaws are noble and most striking
birds.
Whenever Macaws are mentioned one naturally envisages
magnificent large birds, such as the Blue and Yellow, Red and Blue,
or Hyacinthine, whereas the Noble Macaw, although so exalted in
title is only a little larger than the Rosella. Nevertheless, he is a very
interesting bird and an excellent aviary subject.
The only illustration I have been able to discover is in Selby's
Parrots , in the Naturalists' Library Series. In spite of its age, this
engraving by Lear is quite good. There is absolutely no difference
in the sexes, not even in the eye or wing patches or other plumage
can any difference be noticed in the specimens I have had. Neither is
there the least variation in size or shape of head or bill. The pelvic
bone test was not of any assistance with young birds. I have not tried
it since breeding results.
The general body colour is a rich dark bottle green, the underside
of its tail being dull yellowish green. The crown and front of the
head are a deep azure blue which merges imperceptibly with the
green of the nape and head. The eye is dark brown and surrounded
by a characteristic bare skin patch of greyish white which extends right
up to the bill. The upper mandible is partly horny white with black
edges and tip, the lower is black. The only other relieving colour is
on the bend of the wing, which is red. Several red feathers are also
present on the underwing. The feet and legs are black, and the size
of the bird as previously mentioned is a little larger than a Rosella
and smaller than a Pennant, about 14 inches overall.
From skins examined at the Museum the size of the bird appears
to vary considerably. It is possible that these represented both Hahns
and the Noble as they were stored under the duplicate denomination
Ara noblis. Some specimens had the sex recorded but in no case
could any distinction in plumage be detected. All appeared to have
been obtained from Brazil (Matto grosso, Para, Miranda, Chapada)
and were collected between 1875 and 1914.
Immature birds are very similar to their parents, but on leaving
the nest the skin patch is duller and smaller ; there is no blue on the
head, and no red on the bend of the wing. The red is present,

however, on the underwing, only being noticeable in flight. The bill
is whiter with less black on the upper mandible.
When the first four birds came into my possession they were evidently
in immature plumage and were originally believed to be Green Gonure
(Aratinga leucopthalma ), but these skins have also been inspected, and
although similar and of the same size (both varying considerably) the
Conure is easily distinguished as it has a whiter bill, the upper mandible
being almost clear white. The skin patch is only a small circle round
the eye with feathers between the eye and bill. They are nearly all
flecked with red on the nape and mantle, and the red on the wing
is much duller, they also lack the lovely blue on the head. Nevertheless,
immature birds could easily have been mistaken with only a written
description as guide. One bird is characteristically a Macaw, and
living specimens would never be likely to be confused by one familiar
with both birds.
They are most attractive aviary birds, and on account of their
rarity, in this country at least, their habits are quite a change from the
Australian Parrot-like birds to which we are more accustomed. They
are active and fly about a good deal, although their flight is powerful
and rapid it is not so hawk-like as the Rosellas. They sit together in
pairs preening each other in an affectionate manner, and although
they appear to like the sun they seldom sit in direct sunlight for long.
In April, 1948, they were turned out into an aviary which had
housed a pair of Leadbeater's Cockatoos for some time. The wooden
framework had therefore suffered considerably, and the wire netting
which was pre-war heavy gauge (19 Jin. mesh) was very patched.
Trouble was therefore anticipated from these South Americans, but
they have lived there for nearly two years and have never attempted
to damage their quarters. Although they like new perches, they are
not so destructive to them as one would expect.
The aviary is 21 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 6 ft. 6 in. high--the
shelter is 4 feet square, of asbestos sheet with cement floor, and from
the start the birds have been trained to sleep inside as the aviary has
a northern aspect. They were shut in every night, mainly because
they are early risers, and greet the dawn with their rather harsh cry,
which is not so terrible as a Cockatoo's but was too penetrating to risk
disturbing neighbours at an unreasonable hour. After all, four birds
with voices like theirs can create a lot of noise. They have always
been kept together in the one flight and have always been perfectly
behaved with no quarrelling. No nest boxes were provided for their
first season. This may have been a mistake as they like to sleep in
a box, but results were not anticipated as it was assumed by observation
that they were young birds and in no condition to attempt breeding
as yet. Anyway, they improved immensely in condition. They appear
to enjoy young grass shoots but spent very little time on the floor of

their flight. Neither did they bathe much, in fact not at all in the first
place, preferring to hang on the wire during heavy showers with their
wings open. But since breeding they have bathed quite regularly and
made a very thorough job of it, being scarcely capable of flight in the
soaked state into which they got themselves.
They remained outdoors without heat all last winter, but at
Christmas time one succumbed to pneumonia, to which they appear
very susceptible. The progress of this illness is always very rapid and
sudden, but particularly so with these birds. In the morning the birds
all looked quite well, at midday one looked a little off colour, so it
was brought in in the afternoon and placed in heat. By the evening
it had recovered, and I quite thought it was a case of over anxiety,
but it did not eat yet drank a lot. About io o'clock at night it
suddenly started gasping for breath, although the eye seemed quite
bright, but by midnight it was dead. Two others have behaved in
the same distressing manner.
This is a digression from " breeding Noble Macaws ", so let us
return to the spring of 1949. There were then three birds which still
gave no clue as to their sex. In April a nest was provided. The site
was unusual as it was considered desirable to close the birds in at
night, yet to put a nest box inside the shelter was not conducive to
raising healthy progeny. A box was accordingly fixed to the outside
of the shelter, a hole cut through the shelter wall to provide access
for the birds, who could thus still be shut in without disturbance, and
subsequently this arrangement proved most convenient as the progress
of nesting was easily observed without interfering with the birds at
all--a thing quite contrary to usual procedure. (See Fig.)
The box itself was exactly similar to that described (Avtcultural
Magazine, 47, p. 64) : a sloping box 8 inches square, 2 ft. 6 in. long,
with 6 inches of peat in the bottom. The top slid open and being situated
outside both the shelter and flight could easily be opened to inspect
when both birds were out in the flight. Within a few days of the box
being placed in position it was evident that the birds were using it.
It also now became apparent that these were probably two hens and
one cock, and although these three remained together throughout all
nesting operations there was never any friction or disagreement even
after the young flew.
It soon became the habit of two of the birds to sleep together in the
box whilst the third was left out in the shelter on its own. It was not
until 10th June that the first egg appeared. It was a little larger than
a Pennant's, but no measurements were taken as all inspections were
made on the supposition that the birds did not know they were
observed. The eggs are rounder at the ends than most Australian
Parrakeets' eggs, pinkish and glossy white. The second egg was laid
on the 12th. On the 13th one bird stayed in the box all day. There

were still only two eggs on the 14th, after which I could not look
until the 17th, when they had increased to three. The fourth and last
was laid on the 18th. After this the birds sat closely until the 27th,
when both were off for a few minutes, and for the first time I saw
them after having had a bath. The eggs then appeared fertile and
had taken on a leaden hue. I believe the hen did all the sitting, and
was mostly fed inside the box by the cock, but they are so absolutely
alike that they could not be distinguished apart. (Rings are easily
removed without delay by their powerful bills, and after one closed
one up tightly their use was discontinued.)
The first young one hatched on 5th July and was distinctly heard
about midday, the noise being quite considerable for a youngster less
than a day old.
By now I had become certain that there were two hens and one cock,
as whilst the hen was incubating the cock passed his days sitting with
the odd bird ; they preened each other and were observed mating.
This hen made efforts to get at a nest box in the adjoining flight
occupied by Princess of Wales, and I believe both hens might have
raised families if given the opportunity, but I did not wish to take any
unnecessary risk. I felt that I was doing quite enough in that direction
by letting the odd bird remain, but there never was the least sign of
trouble. At night the cock always roosted inside the box with the
incubating hen and the odd hen remained just outside, about 18 inches
from the hole. She was never allowed inside, but again without any
malice or disturbance.
On the 7th July I was able to look fairly closely while the birds
were exercising in the flight. There were two youngsters of a slaty
pink colour with traces of down and still two more heavy looking eggs.
The young made quite a lot of noise when being fed. On the 9th
there were three young, now quite pink and covered with white down.
The weather was hot and the parents bathed every day very
thoroughly. The last egg hatched on the 12 th July when the oldest
was one week old, thus the time of incubation was twenty-four days.
The parents soon began to come off a good deal, but in view of the
hot weather and the oldest bird being ten days, this did not cause any
undue concern as, judging by the noise now coming from the brood,
everything was now going well. Incidentally, in view of the hot dry
weather and the way in which the parents bathed so frequently, I had
taken the precaution of injecting about 50 c.c. of water daily into
a small hole in the bottom of the nest, and this may or may not have
helped.
On 16th July there was a violent thunderstorm and the rain fell
down in torrents, with the result that the lid of the nest became swollen
so that it could not be slid open. At this period the quill feathers were
just showing in the two oldest birds, and on the 22nd when I was next

able to inspect, the green coloured tufts were showing and their eyes
were well open. Matters now proceeded somewhat leisurely and
uneventfully. The parents were off nearly all the time but could be
heard feeding their noisy family at all hours. The cock still made
advances to the odd hen whenever he was left alone with her.
I expected the young to fly towards the end of August. Sometimes, on
going in the shelter to feed, a cautious inquisitive little eye could be
seen looking out from the nest hole. The great event happened on
3rd September when the shelter door was opened as usual early in
the morning ; instead of the usual three birds flying out, four came
out of the hole, and the youngster could fly and perch almost as well
as the adults--the differences in plumage have already been recorded,
but he certainly was a fine healthy bird, perfect in every respect.
He returned to the box later in the day and did not venture out again
until the gth, when all four came out together, and I had seven Noble
Macaws making a wonderful show in one flight.
Every youngster was perfect and able to fly with absolute con-
fidence. They all returned to the box and continued to sleep there
for several weeks. The nest had been kept very clean, the faeces
having been removed regularly by the parents, although they were
not actually observed while doing so.
One youngster caught a chill, and after a spell in the hospital cage
and a week's recuperation he was treated as a stranger when returned
to his parents, and although there was not any vicious fighting, as in
the case of Broadtails, he was cold shouldered and looked unhappy, so
he was removed. At present the parents still use the nest box as
sleeping quarters (December) ; the two young still remaining in the
flight behave like a pair and sleep just outside. They are all in perfect
harmony and do not interfere with each other, but definitely keep in
pairs and spend all their time preening their companions.
The winter 1948-49 was not severe, and the original birds never
had any heat ; one died of pneumonia but the other three never
looked anything but perfectly fit under these conditions. In view of
their suspected susceptibility to pneumonia very slight heat has been
provided for this coming winter, but it only takes the form of a Putnam
paraffin heater in the shelter, which is only lit at night and will be
left on during very cold days.
Their normal diet consists of buckwheat, sunflower, oat screenings,
peanut, and canary, with a little hemp every other day. They are
very fond of pears and apples to a lesser degree. I think it inadvisable
to give fruit in very cold weather. They are also inclined to eat the
green grass in their flight, and this again causes some concern when
covered with frost. They are very fond of chickweed and consumed
a lot when rearing. They also had groundsel, shepherd's purse, sow-
thistle, and spinnach as available, and these are, in fact, given

whenever conditions permit. The consumption of food whilst rearing
was colossal.
It is obvious that considerable strain must be put on the parents in
semi-digesting all this for their family. I therefore do my best to help
them by supplying sprouted seed liberally--wheat, sunflower, and
canary--and also soaked bread--in giving the latter it is most
important not to supply a stodgy wet mess. Roast the bread crusts
thoroughly, crush them up small, and then just before use add
sufficient boiling water to make the rusks swell to a crumbly con-
sistency. This mixture saves the parents a lot of work, and by the
way they devour it at once it is clearly appreciated. It is also a
wonderful means of feeding tonics, vitamins, etc., to the birds.
When I first had these birds there used to be one who said " Hallo ",
and they all appeared to chatter in some foreign dialect. Another cried
just like a baby--a universal language, but since they have been out
in an aviary they appear to have forgotten these talents. The young-
bird who came in with a chill, although only indoors for a fortnight
or so, soon settled down in a cage and learned to say " Hallo ". There
is every indication that these birds are very intelligent and would
make excellent companions in a cage. No doubt if we are able to
produce a few more the experiment can be attempted. I have been
able to find out practically nothing about their life, habits, and
territory in a natural state.
For my own part, I am delighted with them as aviary birds as they
make a most welcome and interesting change from the Australian
species, to which we are so much more accustomed. You will gather
that I like them very much. Quite rightly.

The Duke of Bedford has suggested to me that you might care to
publish the enclosed records of longevity of my cage-birds--Waxbills
and allied Finches, kept over a period of twenty years, merely as pets,
not for breeding.
The birds--usually nine to eleven of them--were kept altogether in
a box cage (2 feet long by 15 inches high, or in a much higher 2J ft.
cage in winter) in the living-room with no central heating and not
much warmth before midday. They were fed on Indian and white
millet seed only--home-grown since importation ceased--and a very
few mealworms in the coldest weather--grass, etc., as available.

Until the war I took them away with me two or three times a year,
all together in a quite small cage, long journeys in all weathers, with
no ill effects.
They were bought at ordinary London dealers' shops for the most
part, and of course I have no idea of their ages when acquired. The
Lavender Finches would probably have lived longer if not amongst
so many others ; this also applies to the Silverbills, who were not too
happy in the crowd when I decided to reduce numbers for lack of seed.

BREEDING RESULTS AT THE KESTON FOREIGN
BIRD FARM, SEASON 1949

The 1949 breeding season at Keston has been, with one notable
exception, a remarkably prolific one, the number of Budgerigars
reared alone running into thousands.
The one exception was our stock of Golden-mantled Rosellas, which
for some mysterious reason failed lamentably, several of the hens of
the best breeding pairs either failing to go to nest at all or else having
infertile eggs.
Most of the Meally Rosellas did quite well, but there again, our
best breeding pair took an unusually long time going to nest and then
the eggs were clear. One pair which utterly refused to go to nest
were moved into a different aviary and given two nest boxes--their
old one and another of a different type, whereupon the hen instantly

took to the original box which she had previously scorned, and a nice
brood was reared !
A cock Browns mated to his hybrid Browns X Rosella daughter had
infertile eggs, which was scarcely to be wondered at as the Browns
must by now be a very old bird, having been at Keston for at least
i o years and in the present Duke of Bedford's aviaries for some time
before that. They have not been a prolific couple, but before the war
they did produce a most beautiful male three-quarter Browns hybrid,
which we still have. The Browns was originally mated to a hen
Golden-mantled Rosella, and next season I propose, if possible, to
mate him to one again, as this mating produces quite the loveliest
Broadtail cross I have ever seen. I say if possible, as I have tried to do
this before, but without success, as Browns are, of all Broadtails--and
possibly of all Parrakeets--the most faithful to their lawful spouses.
They are not easy to mate in the first place but, once mated, it usually
seems to be for life.
All our pairs of Stanleys reared young ones of excellent quality.
This was satisfactory and rather interesting, considering that the
aviaries have not been moved on to fresh ground since the beginning
of the war, and would certainly drop to pieces if one attempted to
move them now !
There were none of the large broods of pre-war days, but that,
I find, applies to all our Broadtail Parrakeets, whose broods nowadays
consist mainly of threes and fours. Whether this has anything to do
with stale ground I don't know, but it will be interesting to try some of
our Stanleys on fresh ground when our new aviaries with angle-iron
flights are completed. It is curious that if stale ground does cause
a degree of infertility it apparently has no detrimental effect whatever
on the quality of the comparatively small number of young ones
reared.
Ringnecks did particularly well, and both Lutinos and Lutino-breds
were reared, including a fine brood of three Lutinos and one green
from a Lutino hen mated to a Lutino-bred cock. It is interesting that
Ringnecks did so well this season because latterly they had become
increasingly unproductive, which decided me to have a general post
of husbands and wives--with the most rejuvenating results !
A cock Alexandrine mated to a hen Lutino Ringneck again reared
their annual three youngsters, all magnificent specimens, as hybrids
usually are. The Ringneck always has to be removed just before the
young ones leave the nest as she is one of those strange hens one does
occasionally meet with among Parrakeets, who is mother-love per-
sonified while the brood is in the nest but murders them the moment
they leave it. So far she has, before I could prevent it, made mincemeat
of three of her offspring over a period of several years. Now I see to
it that she never gets the chance.

E. BOOSEY---BREEDING RESULTS AT THE KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM 1 9
We now have a number of these handsome hybrids of various ages,
one of which has just assumed full adult male plumage. He is hardly
distinguishable from an ordinary cock Alexandrine except for his
slightly smaller size and rather less massive head and beak--the latter
a distinct improvement.
We have been trying for years--with a view to eventually breeding
Lutino Alexandrines--to get a hen Alexandrine to mate to a cock
hybrid, but as none seem forthcoming I shall doubtless have to mate
him to one of his sisters. It's a great pity one cannot go one step
further, and if anyone who reads this has a hen Alexandrine for
disposal we should be very pleased to hear from him.
Green and yellow Redrumps did very well, rearing an average of
eight young per pair. More than forty were bred.
Four pairs of Cockatiels, most of them bred here last year, reared
twenty-eight young ones, and it is nice to have a breeding stock of
these quaint and unique members of the Parrot family again.
Blue-fronted Amazon Parrots were a disappointment. A hen bred
here before the war, who regularly lays and incubates four eggs each
year, had as usual an infertile clutch---this time with a new husband.
Another couple, obtained separately, and put together in the spring
as a pair, have spent the summer recovering from many years spent
in Parrot cages. They were thrilled to death at the sight of a nest box,
and with their stiff joints creaking from long disuse, climbed laboriously
into it accompanied by a curious combination of uproarious human
laughter and the savage barking of dogs, both having obviously, at
some time, been the pets of light-hearted dog-lovers !
Unfortunately they soon lost interest in the nest and concentrated
instead on planning the amputation of my fingers when I fed them.
Another Blue-front--a fine bird, and I should say a cock--was
obtained later and given a presumed hen which, in some extraordinary
way (since she was extremely agile and he quite the reverse) he
managed to murder, scalping her very savagely after they had been
together for several weeks. I propose to try him with another presumed
hen, putting them in adjoining aviaries for the winter and, if things
look favourable, trying them together in the spring. This is a rare
precaution to have to take with Blue-fronted Amazons.
Roseate Cockatoos eventually reared two excellent young ones,
having chewed up the first nest box they were given until it was a mere
pile of sawdust. Their second nest box was entirely armour-plated
with sheet zinc, which they did their best to whittle, with negative
results, eventually deciding there was nothing for it but to go to nest.
It is interesting that, in spite of increasingly stale ground, their two
youngsters were quite the finest they have ever reared, and I can only
put it down to the fact that I gave the parents for the first time
sweetened bread and milk, of which they ate large quantities. Not all

birds will eat bread and milk--particularly if unsweetened--but I am
quite sure that for those that will, it provides the most completely
nourishing and satisfactory of all rearing foods.
A nice young pair of Manycolours bred this season at Barrington
House from an imported pair, was obtained from the Duke of Bedford.
Of two pairs of Diamond Doves--one has reared seven young ones
and they are sitting again, while the other pair had an early nest,
which they forgot to feed when almost fledged, and spent the rest of
the summer having abortive nests, but now have young again.
Upwards of a hundred Zebra Finches, Greys, Whites, and Silvers
have been reared as well as Bengalese.
Fawn Zebra Finches, received rather late in the season, proved
difficult to breed, one pair refusing to go to nest at all, while another
pair always let their young ones die. A clutch of the latter's eggs
were changed over and given to a particularly reliable pair of Silvers,
with the typical result that the Silvers hatched but failed to rear the
young Fawns, while the Fawns hatched and successfully reared the
young Silvers !
I have a few Pheasants in my private planted aviaries, Amhersts,
Golden, and a charmingly tame and beautiful male Temminck's
Tragopan which feeds out of my hand, also Giant and Paradise
Whydahs, Taha and Grenadier Weavers, a male South African
Golden-breasted Bunting, and a pair of Bullfinches. The latter reared
two nice young ones in a Cupressus bush with no extra foods except
egg and breadcrumbs, bread and milk, and, of course, any insects
they managed to capture for themselves. They seemed to rear their
young largely on sunflower seed, which they adore, and I think it is
much better for them than their other favourite, hemp.
The Golden-breasted Bunting--which incidentally is the first we
have ever had here--is a really beautiful bird, with its brown back,
black tail, black white-banded wings, head handsomely striped in
black and white, and its copper-coloured upper breast shading into
bright yellow beneath.
I am afraid this account of breeding results at Keston is not up to
pre-war standard, but my excuse must be the notorious difficulty of
making bricks without straw, which is what trying to write an article
about one's birds really boils down to nowadays.

{Continued from Vol. jy, p. iyg.)
(22) Red-rumped Parrakeet {Psephotus hamatonotus)
Synonyms. --Red-backed Parrot (R.A.O.U. Checklist, 1926), Grass
Parrot.
Distribution. --From southern Queensland, through most of New
South Wales and Victoria, into the eastern portion of South Australia.
Description. --A rather plump little Parrakeet with marked dis-
similarity between the sexes. The adult male has the head and breast
bright grass green, the abdomen is yellow, and the under tail coverts
are white. The mantle is bluish-green and the rump is red. The
general colouring of the female is a greyish-olive with dark edges to
the feathers, giving a scaly appearance ; the rump is green and the
abdomen and under tail-coverts are white.
Immatures are easily sexed when they leave the nest, the young
females being identical with the adults except in regard to the colour
of the beak which is yellow, whereas young males are duller editions
of the adults, the red area on the rump being considerably reduced
in size and the bright green of the head and breast being of a con-
siderably duller shade. Adult plumage is acquired by a complete
moult of body feathers which usually occurs when the birds are about
three months old. Young males, however, retain the spotted flight
feathers for about a further year.
Variations. --Several subspecies have been described but none of them
appears to be valid, to my mind. The very attractive yellow sport has
been developed in England and appears to be firmly established now
{vide Boosey, Avicultural Magazine, 1949, p. 12).
Coloured Plates. ---Roland Green's plate of a pair of these birds in
Mathews (vol. vi, p. 395) is very good. The plate of a male in Greene
(vol. ii, p. 23) is reasonably accurate but depicts the bird in a most
unnatural position.
Field Notes. --A very common bird in South Australia, being found
in all classes of country. It is quite common in the parklands around
Adelaide and pairs of wild birds often alight on my aviaries and
squabble with the inmates thereof. Pairs are occasionally seen on city
buildings in Adelaide and they probably breed under roofs and in
other crevices in buildings. This species is usually seen in pairs or in
small family parties, but occasionally congregates in quite large flocks.
Aviary Notes. --Being such a common bird in this State it is not greatly
sought after as an aviary bird. In a mixed collection it is inclined to

be rather aggressive and the combined assault of a pair will usually
result in the rout of a much larger adversary.
I usually had one or more of this species in a large mixed aviary in
the early days of my collection but made no serious attempt to breed
them until 1944 when a hen that I had obtained late in 1938 and
a cock secured about a year later were segregated. The hen laid the
first egg of a clutch of five on 17th September and young were first
observed on 16th October, having obviously then been hatched for
some days. A few days later four could be counted, the fifth egg being
clear. The first two young, both hens, left the nest on 10th November,
the third, another hen, on 13th, and the fourth, the only cock, on 16th.
In 1945 the old hen died and the cock escaped, but one of the
young hens was mated to her brother and they went to nest early in
November, laying four eggs, all of which proved clear. The following
season two eggs were laid late in September and disappeared, then
another was laid from the perch, and ultimately seven more in the
log. These were incubated but were all clear. 1947 saw a repetition
of the previous year in that a clutch, commenced at the end of August,
were all clear as were a further clutch of five laid early in October.
About this time a wild cock bird became very attentive to the hen,
and I eventually caught him and liberated the old cock, who had
become extremely fat. The hen seemed very pleased with the change
and laid a third clutch early in November but became egg-bound
with the fourth egg, and after eventually laying it, did not incubate.
In 1948 four eggs were found in the log early in September, but the
hen then looked sick and eventually laid a soft-shelled egg and
thereafter did not incubate. She spent a good deal of time in the log
early in October but did not produce another clutch.
Red-rumps differ from most of the Broadtails in that a pair become
very attached to one another, but they are very easily consoled after
the loss of a mate and will readily accept a newcomer. They are one
of the few species of Australian Parrakeets that indulge in preening of
their mates.
Red-rumps were deemed ineligible for a medal by the A.S.S.A. as
the species was known to have been bred on several occasions before
the formation of the Society.
(23) Many-coloured Parrakeet (Psephotus varius)
Synonyms .--Mulga Parrot (R.A.O.U. Checklist, 1926), Varied

Distribution .---A bird of the interior, ranging from southern Queens-

difference in the plumage of the sexes. The adult male has the head,
back, and breast a bright green, the frontal band, shoulder patch,
and under tail-coverts yellow, the margins of the wings and the tail
blue, and patches on the nape and rump and the abdomen are red.
The female differs in that the bright green areas are replaced by a
brownish green, the shoulder patch is dull red, the frontal band is
dull yellow with an occasional reddish tinge, and the abdomen is
green with an occasional red flecking. Immatures are easily sexed on
leaving the nest, the young females being identical with the adults
except for the yellow colour of the beaks, whilst the young males are
considerably duller than the adults but still much brighter than the
females ; the red area on the belly is either absent or considerably
reduced. In addition the shoulder patch in the young male is generally
yellow, but occasionally has a brick-red tinge. Adult plumage is
obtained by a complete moult of the body feathers occurring when
the birds are about three months old. Young males, however, retain
the spotted flight feathers until they are over a year old.
Variations .--It is doubtful whether any of the subspecies described
are worthy of retention, as a considerable variation exists amongst
a number of birds from any given locality.
Coloured Plates. --Boosey's figure of a cock in Tavistock (p. 218) is
excellent, as also is Goodchild's plate of a pair in Seth-Smith (p. 206).
Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 401) is also very good
but the figure in Greene (vol. ii, p. 21) makes all the colours appear
somewhat unnatural in shade as well as giving the bird the squat
figure of a Red-rump.
Field Notes .--I have observed this bird on numerous occasions in
the mallee districts of South Australia and have always been struck by
the beauty of the birds when seen in the natural state. They are almost
invariably observed in pairs or small parties ; in fact, I have never
seen them in large flocks like their ally, the Red-rump.
Aviary Notes .--A bird with a very bad reputation for delicacy when
first trapped ; in fact, many aviculturists declare that they have
abandoned the attempt to acclimatize newly caught birds. I cannot
help feeling that this supposed delicacy is due to the birds being kept
under dirty conditions and badly fed by the trappers.
My initial experiences with this species were in keeping with those
of many others in that none of nine trapped birds survived more
than a few weeks. In February, 1936, I obtained a pair of acclimatized
birds which were alleged to have hatched young during the previous
season but to have failed to rear them. This pair went to nest in August,
1936, the first egg of a clutch of five being laid on the 28th of that
month. The hen sat very closely and young were first observed on
20th September and eventually all five eggs were found to have

hatched, but four of the young had succumbed by the beginning of
October. The fifth, a hen, survived and left the nest on 20th October.
This appears to have been the first record of the species having been
bred in captivity in South Australia, although the A.S.S.A. medal had
been awarded in 1930 to Mr. F. G. Kitchen, a resident of Broken Hill.
The hen of this pair died suddenly in August, 1937, and it was not
until February of the following year that I was able to procure a
satisfactory substitute. This new hen laid two clutches of eggs that
season but did not incubate either of them ; however, in 1939 she
commenced a clutch of six late in July, of which five were fertile.
These duly hatched and all were reared, leaving the nest towards the
end of September and being two cocks and three hens. A second
clutch laid towards the end of October consisted of five eggs, four of
which were fertile and from which four young, two of each sex, were
reared, leaving the nest in mid-December.
From that time onward this pair of birds had a remarkable record,
rearing eight from two nests in 1940, 1941, and 1942 and four from
a single nest in 1943. In 1944 they were again double-brooded, rearing
three in the first nest and four in the second and exactly repeating
these results in 1945, whilst 1946 saw two reared in the first clutch
and four in the second. In 1947 their first clutch was removed and
Little Blue Bonnet eggs substituted, and they duly hatched and reared
three fine young ones and then proceeded to rear four young Many-
colours from the second clutch. By 1948 the cock was beginning to
show signs of old age and, although Little Blue Bonnet eggs were
again substituted for their first clutch, only two hatched and only one
survived to leave the nest. They did not go to nest again and the cock
died in early November and the hen later in the same month. They
had, I think, a remarkable record in rearing sixty-five young birds in
ten seasons.
Many-colours, when once established, make delightful aviary birds,
becoming very tame and confiding and not being nearly as pugnacious
and aggressive as are Red-rumps. They are very devoted to their
mates but are very easily consoled after the loss of a partner and
readily mate up with a substitute. Together with the Red-rumps and
Blue Bonnets they are unique amongst the Broadtails in the habit of
preening the feathers of their mates. Towards the end of winter they
become very active, flying up and down their aviary and uttering
their very pleasant whistling call notes. At this time, too, the cock
frequently displays to the hen in the usual Broadtail, shoulder-squaring
manner.

of country, ranging from south-western Queensland, through western
New South Wales, down to north-western Victoria. In South
Australia it has an extensive distribution in the drier parts, from the
Murray mallee in the south to the vicinity of Cooper's Creek in the
north and westward to the upper parts of Eyre's Peninsula.
Description.--A rather slim Parrakeet in which the sexes are super-
ficially very similar. The prevailing colour is brownish-grey on the
head, wings, rump, and upper breast with the head, face, and wing
margins bright blue. The upper breast and sides of the abdomen are
yellow and the centre of the abdomen is red. In what may be regarded
as the typical race (the Yellow-vented) the subcaudals are pale yellow
and there is a broad band of olive adjacent to the blue wing margins.
The adult male has a considerably larger beak than the female, and
in the latter sex the red patch on the abdomen is generally neither
as intense nor as extensive ; in fact, most of the red feathers are
narrowly margined with yellow. Immatures closely resemble the
adults but all colours are slightly duller and the red abdominal patch
is much restricted in size. Adult plumage is attained by a moult of
body feathers which occurs when the birds are about three or four
months old. The sex of immatures can usually be determined with
reasonable certainty, as in the adults, by the size of the beak.
Variations .--The Red-vented race, which is found in south Queensland
and northern New South Wales, differs considerably from the better-
known Yellow-vented bird and has been regarded as a good species
by many authorities. The most striking difference is in the colour of
the wing-bars, the olive being replaced by reddish-chestnut, while the
subcaudals are red instead of yellow in the male and red margined
with yellow in the female. Immatures of this race show the chestnut
wing colouring very distinctly but the amount of red on the subcaudals
is very variable. This race is usually larger than the Yellow-vented
and adult males show a small pale green patch at the point of the
shoulder, an area that is blue in the Yellow-vented. Intermediate
forms between the two typical extremes are often seen, suggesting
a merging into one another of the two races and tending to disprove
the theory that they are specifically distinct.
I doubt very much the validity of the pallid form described from
northern South Australia ( pallescens ) ; such skins as I have examined
rather suggest a pale mutation.
Coloured Plates .--Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 410)
is an excellent portrayal of the two races ; Gronvold's plate in
Seth-Smith (p. 192) is fairly good but the colouring on the wing of

is poor in that the wings are too green, there is an incorrect violet
shade on the chest, and the red on the abdomen extends too far
laterally.
Field Notes .--I have seen the Yellow-vented race in the wild state in
several places in South Australia, notably near Peterborough and in
the vicinity of Blanchetown. They are usually seen in pairs and are
noisy birds, giving their loud alarm note when disturbed and indulging
in the characteristic jerky, bobbing movements.
Aviary Notes .--Prior to the 1939-45 war large numbers of the
Yellow-vented birds used to appear in the local bird shops ; they were
extremely shy when first caught and had the reputation of being rather
delicate. In addition, they have always been rather unpopular as
aviary birds on account of their notorious pugnacity ; pairs being able
to take on, defeat, and even kill other Broadtails much larger than
themselves. The Red-vented race is quite unknown in local bird
shops, any specimens that I have possessed having always been
obtained from Sydney or Brisbane. Blue Bonnets have always been
regarded as extremely shy breeders, both in Australia and abroad,
and my experiences with them have been rather unusual.
Dealing first with the Red-vented race, I obtained my first pair of
these birds from the late Mr. Wachsmann, of Sydney, in 1937, but
these two birds were never well disposed to each other. Early in 1939
I was fortunate enough to obtain another hen from a Melbourne
fancier ; this bird had laid whilst in his possession the previous year
and it immediately became very friendly with the original cock bird,
and the first egg of a clutch of six was laid on 17th August of that year.
All the eggs were fertile and eventually hatched, young being first
seen in the nest on 13th September. However, three young birds died
during the first week and another when about half-grown ; the
remaining two were reared and left the nest on 19th and 21st October.
They were a pair, and it was interesting to note that both had well-
marked chestnut wing patches and that the male had yellow sub-
caudals, whilst those of the female were red. At the first moult, which
took place in December, the subcaudals of the male changed to bright
red. This being the first recorded breeding of the species in South
Australia gained the A.S.S.A. medal and also the silver medal of the
Society for the most outstanding breeding achievement of the season.
Unfortunately, the breeding pair escaped during the winter of 1940
and were not recovered.
In March, 1943, whilst stationed near Brisbane, I was able to
acquire another pair of birds of this race and brought them back
with me when I came home on leave. They made no attempt at
nesting that year, but in 1944 the first egg was laid on 28th August,
and promptly broken. Five more fertile eggs followed and the first
young bird was seen on 23rd September ; two days later, three living

and one dead young were seen in the log, the fifth egg having failed
to hatch although it contained an almost fully developed embryo.
Three young were duly reared, leaving the nest between 26th and
30th October, and being one cock and two hens. The following
season (1945) a clutch of three was laid at the end of August. One of
these was infertile but the other two hatched and were reared, proving
to be two cocks. In 1946 a clutch of six was laid early in August.
Of these, two hatched and died when quite young, a third was dead
in the shell, a fourth had a very small embryo, and the remaining
two were clear. The following year a clutch of five eggs was laid in
mid-August but all proved infertile and in 1948 the old hen died in
October without having laid.
In regard to the Yellow-vented race, I had almost given up hope
of ever breeding them as they had been represented continuously in
my collection over a period of ten years or more without ever showing
the slightest inclination to go to nest. For the 1947 season I had an
old hen known to have been in captivity for many years, mated to an
exceptionally vigorous cock alleged to have bred young when mated
to a Red-vented hen in Victoria in previous years. As the breeding
season approached he drove the hen about a lot, and when a log was
provided he forced her to spend a considerable portion of each day
therein, much against her will. However, an egg was laid on 24th
August and was soon broken, but it was followed by five more, all of
which proved fertile and eventually hatched, the first young being seen
on 17th September and the fifth not until a week later. All were
reared and left the nest between 21st and 28th October, being two
cocks and three hens. This success also gained the medal of the
A.S.S.A. as this variety had not been previously bred in South
Australia ; in fact, the only other Australian breeding that I am
aware of is that by Mr. H. R. Waddel, of Melbourne, in 1938.
Unfortunately, the hen of the above-mentioned pair died before the
next breeding season and was not replaced until too late to expect
any results in that year.
Blue Bonnets are not very easy to mate up, frequently disapproving
of mates provided for them. Once mated they are extremely devoted
and indulge in a good deal of mutual preening, an unusual trait
amongst Broadtails. They also play, rather in the manner of Lorikeets,
with sticks or stones or occasionally with one another. They have the
ability to raise the forehead feathers when frightened or excited, in the
form of a small crest ; this is usually accompanied by vigorous bobbing,
especially on the part of the cock bird, and the loud " chop, chop 55
alarm note is uttered at the same time.
Hand-reared Blue Bonnets lose all fear of humans and usually
become extremely aggressive and savage ; they make, however, quite
fair whistlers.

(25) Little Blue Bonnet Parrakeet ( Psephotus naretha)
Synonyms. --Naretha Parrot, Oak Parrot.
Distribution. --The full extent of the range of this species is quite
uncertain but it has only been found in the Desert Sheoak country
that fringes the western edge of the Nullarbor plain in the vicinity of
the Naretha railway siding.
Description. --A smaller, slimmer bird than the preceding species,
with a more obvious sexual difference. The adult male has the
general coloration of the back, rump, and chest more of a yellowish
olive, the blue of the forehead is a turquoise shade, the abdomen is
yellowish orange without any trace of red and the subcaudals are
bright scarlet. There are, in addition, a few scarlet feathers just below
the bend of the wing. The adult female is easily distinguished for,
in addition to having a smaller head and beak, the turquoise on the
forehead is duller, the abdomen is yellow without any orange tinge,
and the small patch on the wing is brick red. Immatures resemble
the adult female, but are duller in all respects ; they attain adult
plumage within a few months of leaving the nest, prior to which they
are best sexed by the size of the head and beak.
Variations. --As is to be expected from a species whose known range
is so limited, no variations have been described.
Coloured Plates.-- The plate of a pair by Cayley, which appears in
The Emu (vol. 21, pi. 12), together with an account of the discovery
of the species, is quite good. The only other plate of which I am
aware is the excellent one by Gronvold in the little-known Supplement
to the Birds of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands , by Mathews (p. 25, pi. 63).
Field Notes. --On my only trip on the Trans-continental Railway
I passed through Naretha at night and consequently had no
opportunity to see the bird in its natural state.
Aviary Notes. --This bird was quite unknown to aviculture until an
Adelaide dealer obtained two small consignments early in 1936.
I secured a pair from the first lot and lost the hen after about eighteen
months. A substitute was secured and survived about two years, and
a third hen obtained early in 1942 escaped, together with the original
cock bird, during 1943. None of these hens ever showed any real
desire to go to nest, although the log was visited occasionally by the
second of the trio. A new pair obtained in 1944 went to nest in
mid-September, breaking the first of a clutch of six eggs but thereafter
incubating steadily ; unfortunately, the eggs were all infertile. Prior
to the 1945 breeding season a new cock was obtained and a clutch of
five eggs was commenced on 6th October, three of which were fertile
and duly hatched. Two of the young birds died very early but the
survivor, a cock, was reared and left the nest on 11 th October. This
success gained the A.S.S.A. medal, the only other known breedings

being that in the Adelaide Zoo in 1941 (recorded in Avicultural
Magazine, 1945, p. 7) and an almost simultaneous success by Mr. Catt,
of Carlingford, near Sydney. In 1946 the same pair commenced a
clutch of five eggs on 9th August but investigation in mid-September
showed two dead young, two eggs with fully developed young dead
in the shell, and a clear egg. In 1947 the first egg of a clutch of five
was laid on 15th August and promptly broken ; of the remaining four,
three proved fertile and in view of past performances were transferred
to my reliable old pair of Many-colours and were duly hatched and
reared by them, proving to be two cocks and a hen. The Narethas
were given the Many-colours' three fertile eggs, which they hatched
and eventually succeeded in rearing two of them ; the elder was one
of the finest young cock Many-colours I have ever bred but the
younger was a miserable little runt. In 1948 the changes were rung
again, but out of four fertile Naretha eggs given to the Many-colours
only two were hatched and one reared while the Narethas successfully
reared two good young Many-colours from three fertile eggs !
Narethas closely resemble common Blue Bonnets in their habits
and behaviour and in spite of the recent action of the R.A.O.U.
Checklist Committee in their wisdom (or lack of same) in relegating
them to subspecific rank, I am firmly of the opinion that they are
a valid and a very distinct species. Furthermore, any odd birds that
I have possessed have never shown any desire to mate with common
Blue Bonnets of the opposite sex.
Until this year (1949) I do not think they had been taken to
England, but a dealer left for America with some just prior to the
outbreak of the 1939-45 war &gt; I have no information as to whether
they were landed successfully or not.
(26) Hooded Parrakeet (.Psephotellus dissimilis)
Synonyms. --Black-hooded Parrot. Often erroneously called Golden-
shouldered Parrakeet.
Distribution .--As far as is known this species is confined to the
northern part of the Northern Territory. There is no record of it
reaching the Kimberley district of Western Australia, like the Northern
Rosella does, nor has it been recorded from north-western Queensland.
Description .--A very slim, relatively long-tailed Parrot with a very
marked difference between the sexes. The adult male has the head
black, mantle brownish grey, and a broad band of golden-yellow on
the wing margins. The rump is pale blue and the under surface is
a vivid bluish-green which alters in appearance in different lights.
The subcaudals are salmon colour with a faint edging of white to
each feather. The colouring of the adult female is mainly a yellowish-
green, with the rump, cheeks, and abdomen pale blue and the under
tail-coverts salmon tipped with white as in the male. Immatures

almost exactly resemble the female, apart from the yellowish beak
which later changes to horn colour; young males, however, invariably
exhibit very much brighter blue cheeks than do young females.
Young Hoodeds undergo a moult of body feathers when about three
or four months old ; young males do not begin to assume adult
plumage for some considerable time thereafter and the transition is not
completed until they are about fifteen or even eighteen months old,
depending to some extent on the season of the year in which they
were hatched.
Variations .--I have never seen any variants but the species was
originally described as having the forehead, lores, and crown dark
chestnut. In this connection, reference should be made to two
interesting letters to the Avicultural Magazine (1926, pp. 256 and
287), written by Sprawson, in which he claims to have seen a brown-
headed bird and also draws attention to other less-marked variations.
Coloured Plates .--These are singularly few in number. Roland Green's
portrayal of a pair in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 425) is quite good, although
it gives the male a rather unnaturally bulky appearance. Cayley's
plate, in The Emu (vol. 24, pi. 1, upper figure), is good of a male.
Field Notes .--I have never seen this bird in the wild state and
comparatively little has been recorded of its habits ; the species is
said to frequent open country. It is well known that the three members
of this genus make their nests by tunnelling into termites' mounds.
Aviary Notes .--A hardy and most attractive aviary bird and one
which has proved a relatively free breeder in captivity. This species
is, however, quite unsuited to a mixed collection on account of its
pugnacity.
I obtained my first pair of these birds in October, 1935, the male
being almost fully coloured when procured. They first went to nest
late in March, 1936, laying three eggs, all of which hatched and were
reared, the young leaving the nest between 20th and 24th May and
all three being cocks. At the end of July the hen commenced a second
clutch, which on this occasion consisted of five fertile eggs, all of
which hatched but only three of which were reared. These young left
the nest at the end of September, the youngest having deformed feet
which necessitated its being destroyed. The old pair of birds started
to moult early in October, and in the following year (1937) the first
clutch consisted of four eggs laid towards the end of March. Three of
these were fertile and were duly hatched and reared, leaving the nest
in the middle of May. A second clutch of four was laid about a month
later and were inexplicably deserted early in July ; they were all
fertile and were on the point of hatching. Of a third clutch of four
laid in August, only two were fertile but these were duly reared and
left the nest early in October. The hen, who was not young when
obtained, died in November whilst in the moult.

For the 1938 season the original cock bird was mated to an unrelated
hen and for a period of eight years thereafter they had a remarkably
consistent record of success. They started slowly with two young
reared in September, 1938, followed by three young each in April and
August, 1939. For the next four years the tallies were six, five, six, and
four young successfully reared ; on some occasions three clutches were
laid in a season but two was the usual and in 1943 the only clutch
was not laid until the late winter. In 1944 the first clutch was laid
late in July but the eggs were deserted when the hen sustained an
injured foot, only two of the five being fertile. A second clutch,
consisting of four, laid early in September, resulted in a single bird
leaving the nest on 1st November. In 1945 the first clutch did not
appear until mid-August, only three out of five were fertile but these
were successfully hatched and reared. A second clutch of six was laid
late in October but the hen deserted when the ring on her leg caused
a constriction which ultimately resulted in the loss of her foot. She
laid two clutches of five eggs each late in 1946 but all were infertile
and I did not try to breed from her again.
For the 1947 and 1948 seasons I had one of the 1945 cocks mated
to an unrelated hen, but they showed very little inclination to go to
nest in either year although they had produced eggs in 1946.
Hoodeds, whether trapped or aviary-bred, seem to come into
breeding condition in the autumn when young but after several years
in captivity or as they get older seem to accommodate themselves
more and more to the normal breeding season. Even so, they are
usually ready to go to nest before the winter is over and always moult
particularly early.
The display of the Hooded is very pleasing and consists of the cock
alighting with great ceremony on the perch near the hen or following
her along the ground in a series of exaggerated hops, the shoulders
being simultaneously depressed and the feathers on the head being
erected in the form of a tiny crest. Hens also have the power of
erecting these feathers but seldom do so unless very excited.
The medal of the A.S.S.A. was awarded in 1930 to Dr. W. Hamilton
for the first breeding of this species ; his pair succeeded in rearing
a single youngster in an artificial termitarium. Since that date the
species has been freely bred in South Australia and little difficulty
has been experienced in inducing the birds to take to an ordinary

Description. --Very similar to the preceding species, but differing in
the following respects, as well as being slightly smaller. The adult
male has a well-marked pale yellow frontal band, the black cap does
not extend as far on to the sides of the head, the yellow wing patch
is smaller, and the feathers of the abdomen as well as the subcaudals
are pinkish, edged with white. The adult female differs only slightly
from the female Hooded ; the frontal band is present but is a pale
cream and not very obvious, there is probably even less blue on the
cheeks than is the case in the average hen Hooded, and there are
a few pinkish feathers on the centre of the abdomen. Immatures differ
little from the adult female, but the young males, like Hoodeds, have
bright blue cheek patches. By analogy it is to be presumed that adult
plumage is not acquired by the young males until they are about
fifteen months old.
Variations. --None has been described.
Coloured Plates. --Gronvold's plate in Mathews (vol. vii, p. 430) is
very good of the cock, but the head and cheeks of the hen are much
browner than is the case in any skins that I have examined. Cayley's
plate, in The Emu (vol. 24, pi. 1, lower figure), is good of a male,
and the differences between this species and the preceding are well
shown. The plate by Renaut, in Seth-Smith (p. 202), completely
misses the lovely blue-green colour of the rump and breast of the
cock, these being shown as of a rather slaty blue colour.
Field Notes. --The best notes are those of Donald Thomson, in Birds
of Cape York Peninsula ; the species is described as inhabiting open
forest country and nesting, of course, in anthills, frequently twice in
a season.
Aviary Notes. --I have never seen a living example of this species
and the only records of it in captivity are of a small consignment
taken to England in 1897, a pair, probably from the same lot, obtained
by Mrs. Johnstone, of Bury St. Edmunds, in 1902, and the birds
which were hand-reared by McLennan in 1922, four of which were
presented to the Taronga Park Zoo, Sydney. Cayley, in his Australian
Parrots , records that these birds were extremely tame (as would be
expected as they were hand-reared) and were noticed on occasions
investigating holes in the floor of their aviary. A. S. le Soeuf also
studied these birds and has stated that their call-note was not as harsh
as that of the Hooded and that they raised the feathers on the head
in quite a different manner.
Whilst in Brisbane recently a dealer in that city informed me that
he had had seven examples since the war, which he had sold to a ship's
officer ; other Brisbane fanciers also claimed to have had or to have
seen them in the past. As Donald Thomson has recorded, this species
is not uncommon in its restricted habitat, and with the opening up of
Cape York Peninsula during and since the 1939-45 war there seems

Synonyms. --Beautiful Parrakeet, Red-shouldered Parrakeet, Soldier
Grass Parrot.
Distribution.--The range of this species does not appear to have ever
extended beyond south-eastern Queensland and north-eastern New
South Wales.
Description. --A slim, long-tailed Parrot with well-marked sexual
differentiation. The adult male has the forehead, wing-bar, centre
of the abdomen, and under tail-coverts red, the crown of the head
black, mantle brownish-grey, rump pale blue, face and breast bright
green shading to blue on the sides of the abdomen. The female differs
in that the frontal band is yellowish with a few red flecks, the crown
of the head is brownish, the face and upper breast are yellowish with
a grey shading, and the abdomen and under tail-coverts are pale blue
with some pinkish flecking on the centre of the abdomen. In addition,
the red wing-bar is neither as bright nor as extensive as in the male.
Immatures are said to resemble the female but to be somewhat duller
in all respects, with young males distinguishable by better marked
wing patches. Presumably they would take over a year to come into
full colour.
Variations. --None has been described.
Coloured Plates. --Roland Green's plate of a pair in Mathews (vol. vi,
p. 421) is probably the best available, although it gives both birds
a rather fat appearance ; the plate of a male in Greene (vol. ii, p. 29)
is fairly good but it, too, makes the bird look rather bulky. Cayley's
plates in The Emu (vol. 24, pi. 14) and in Chisholm's Birds and Green
Places (p. 100) are both good.
Field Notes. --Since Chisholm's account of the rediscovery of the
species some twenty-five years ago, to which any interested reader is
referred {The Emu , vol. 22, pp. 4-17), the only reports of the continued
existence of this bird are those referred to by Cayley in his Australian
Parrots (pp. 226-7). There seems to be little doubt that on occasions
the species bred in creek banks and hollow stumps as well as in
termitaria.
Aviary Notes. --I have never seen this bird in life, nor do I know of
anyone in Australia who has seen or kept the species in captivity.
All the reports of its habits in captivity are the oft-quoted ones of last
century. It is said to have been bred on the Continent and in England
by Mr. C. W. Gedney, but the latter, although he gives the incubation
period and describes the young in his Foreign Cage Birds , does not make
any definite claim to have bred them.

It would appear that this species was exported in fair numbers
towards the end of the last century but that in Europe it had a
somewhat doubtful reputation as regards delicacy ; however, it would
seem probable that in Australia, at any rate, it would prove as hardy
as the Hooded and no more difficult to breed in captivity.
Whether its numbers have suffered a severe decline during the
present century is largely a matter of conjecture ; it seems probable
that it was never a very common species at any time. Having regard
to the way in which supposedly extinct species have reappeared in
the last twenty years or so and have now become relatively common
in captivity, it would seem pessimistic to regard this bird as finally
lost to aviculture, and yet I have a sneaking feeling that such is the
case, principally because the districts where it formerly occurred are
relatively settled ones.
It is interesting to note that in Avicultural Magazine, 1924, p. 65,
Tavistock states that " within the last few years ... an odd Paradise
Parrakeet or so have been sent to America It would be interesting
to know the writer's authority for this statement ; I am not aware
of any further notes in this regard.

By Alex Hampe (Coburg)
The last number of our Magazine to my great delight was a Pheasant
number and I need not mention that I read it from beginning to
end with great gusto. May I be allowed here to make a few comments
on some of the articles ? Mr. Lowes' recommendations for rearing
and feeding young Pheasants is of special interest. I quite agree
with him that the very best food for Pheasant chicks are ant eggs.
I should, however, like to know what experience Pheasant fanciers
of our Society had when feeding eggs of the big wood ants. When
I was a boy I reared a lot of Partridges and common game Pheasants
and fed them a good deal with eggs of wood ants without detrimental
result. These chicks had, however, absolutely free range with their
foster-mothers in large meadows and found a good deal of their food
themselves. During the last few years I had regularly some young
blue Crossoptilons. They prospered until nearly full grown but then
a good many of them died and my doctor friend with whom my old
pair is billeted attributed their death to too much formic acid contained
in the large eggs of wood ants which were extensively fed. I doubt
whether this diagnosis is correct, but I remember an article by the
late M. Malisoux in which he stated that he had bad results when
feeding these large eggs unwashed and when I corresponded with him
on this subject he told me that these eggs were obnoxious as food for
insectivorous birds if not thoroughly washed before being used.
I am very anxious to hear the opinion and experience of fellow-fanciers,
but should my Crossoptilons again present me with a brood of
youngsters I will certainly feed eggs of the small black meadow ant
only. Mealworms must also be given with precaution for if they are
not fed on vegetable matter only, they can be very dangerous. Maggots
I never fed and do not recommend them. For hardy Pheasants like
Silvers, Swinhoes, and also Crossoptilons, a good custard is very good.
Of course one must be careful that this food does not get sour during
hot weather.
As broodies Bantams seem to be used mostly in England. But what
kind of Bantams please ? A good many Bantams are very nervous
birds and therefore cannot be recommended as foster-mothers, besides
on account of their small size they can only cover a few eggs and
chicks. For very delicate Pheasant chicks as Peacock-Pheasants,
Versicolors, etc., a cross of Japanese and Wyandotte Bantams is very
good. For Goldens, Amhersts, Elliot's, viz. for all Pheasants of medium
size, I have found Sumatra game, Yokohamas, and Silkies very satis-
factory, while for Peachicks, Crossoptilons, Monauls, and should
anyone be so lucky as to get Occelated Turkey chicks, a light, steady
Turkey hen is excellent. She can cover a whole clutch of a Crossoptilon

hen and remains with her children until they are full-grown, a great
advantage, besides which she is able to defend her brood successfully
against cats and dogs. If one has a fenced meadow, an orchard, or
park for a rearing ground and has not too many coveys I strongly
recommend the brood and their foster-mothers be given free range
after the second or third week when the weather is favourable. The
chicks then develop rapidly and find a good deal of wholesome food
themselves.
Mr. Terry Jones, in his article " Pheasants in Captivity ", says
the White Crossoptilon was not so badly hit by the war and Mr. Weaver
gives a list of the Pheasants now bred in America in which Mr. Lee S.
Crandall lists the White Crossoptilon as " fairly common ". These
statements surprise me, for I have always regarded the White
Crossoptilon as one of the rarest of Pheasants. As far as I know White
Crossoptilons have never been bred in England or in France but
only in America. To my knowledge all the White Crossoptilons
have derived from a few pairs which were collected by a Chinese
gentleman, I think his name was Young, who went, for the late
Mr. Booth, of San Francisco, to the west of China and collected such
rare Pheasants as White Crossoptilons, Chinese Monauls, Pheasant
Grouse, etc. These birds were consigned to a game farm of a
Mr. Laidlay in which Mr. Booth was interested. Also my late friend
Tangier Floyd-Smith collected White Crossoptilons in western China
and as far as I know some of his birds reached the aviaries of
M. Delacour in Cleres. But all these White Crossoptilons were
Crossoptilon drouynii (Verreaux) and not the pure white kind of
Crossoptilon crossoptilon (Hodgson). I saw a mounted bird at a taxi-
dermist's when I was last in Shanghai in 1937. In my opinion it is
not a very handsome bird.
Some pure white Crossoptilons reached Europe in the last ten years
of the nineteenth century and a pair lived in the Berlin Zoo. They
produced eggs but of a successful breeding nothing is known. During
my long sojourn in China I tried hard to get White-Eared Pheasants,
but all my efforts were in vain, so it is the more astonishing to me that
this Pheasant is now listed as fairly common in America.
The rarest Pheasants I obtained was a trio of Chinese Monauls
which I bought from my friend Floyd-Smith in 1937. To my great
and everlasting regret these magnificent birds died during my home-
ward journey in Singapore where I had an involuntarily prolonged
stay of eighteen instead of three days. Even for Singapore it was
unusually hot and a good many of my Pheasants, Cabot's and Tem-
minck's Tragopans, Soemmering's, and the Chinese Monauls died
like flies. Another rare Pheasant I had was Phasianus elegans, of which
I landed a pair in 1937 in England. Phasianus elegans is, of course, a
game Pheasant, but one which very justly deserves his name. He is

indeed a very elegant bird, very slim, small, and of rich coppery
colour without neck-ring. Game Pheasants, interesting as a collection
of them would be, have the disadvantage that all their hens are very
much alike and that they cross easily. Besides an acquisitive fancier
who wants to cover the food bill of his Pheasants by the sale of their
progeny might be disappointed and find it difficult to dispose of his
birds. The Zoological Gardens should endeavour to show as many
kinds of pure game Pheasants as possible. The Berlin Zoo had a
fine collection consisting of Golchicus, Mongolians, Chinese Ring-
necks, Tenebrosus, Versicolors, etc., pre-war times ; probably this
collection has come to an end.
That some of the Pheasants introduced during the last thirty years
could not be established, like Imperialis and Lewis' Pheasant, I chiefly
attribute to the fact that only very few of these species have been
imported and that the fanciers were therefore forced to over inbreed-
ing. It is true that our stock of other Pheasants like Elliot's, Brown
Crossoptilon, Swinhoes, etc., has derived from only a few birds impor-
ted many years ago, but all our Pheasants would certainly greatly
benefit from an infusion of fresh blood of wild caught imported birds.
I observed especially with Brown Crossoptilons that a good many
cocks do not take any notice of their wives. Already the late
Mr. Cronau, many years ago the doyen of Pheasant fanciers in
Germany, complained that the Brown Eared-Pheasants which were
so promising soon after their introduction in 1864 produced only
infertile eggs. In his book, Die Huehnervoegel (the gallinaceous birds)
he relates that from three pairs he got for several years each season
nearly sixty eggs but never a chick. The question of the reason for this
infertility Cronau does not answer, but attributes it chiefly to the high
degree of inbreeding and I agree with him. Also of Blue Crossoptilons
I had a cock which absolutely neglected his hen and another cock
was madly in love with a White Wyandotte hen, but ignored his
proper wife completely.
To import wild caught Pheasants from oversea is at any time
a tricky enterprise. One may have good success, one may have
total loss. That some very desirable Pheasants as the Chinese and
Sclater's Monaul, the Burmese and Hume's Bar-backed Pheasant,
the Western Tragopan have so to say never been imported and other
kinds, as the Imperialis and Lewis' Silver Pheasant in only a few
specimens I attribute chiefly to three different causes. The big zoo-
logical firms chiefly do business in animals and birds suitable for
zoological gardens or such birds which can be bought in quantities
and care little about rare Pheasants, of which a few specimens only
usually can be acquired if at all. Persons who reside abroad and are
really interested in Pheasants are as a rule too busy and occupied
with their profession so that they can devote only very little time to

a hobby, as was my own case during my long stay in China. Collectors
who go in for rare birds, have not visited the countries where rare
Pheasants live and will do so only when commissioned by interested
fanciers who are willing to pay the high prices such importations
command. Besides rarities remain rarities even in their native
countries. For instance, in Singapore I have always found Crested
and Crestless Firebacks and Argus in the market, but never Malayan
Peacock and Bronze-tailed Pheasants (Chalcurus inopinatus). Cabot's
and Temminck's Tragopans were sometimes obtainable in Shanghai,
but never a Brown or Blue Crossoptilon and only once during the
twenty-four years of my residence in this city did I find a pair of
Amhersts and a single Darwin's Koklass. That Pheasants have
greatly suffered by warfare and turmoil in their different habitats
I do not believe. They are wary, cautious creatures and soon wander
away from a disturbed district. Of course hardly anything alive
can be imported under circumstances prevailing at present, but let
us hope that the world will come back to her senses and peaceful
times are in store for us which will allow able collectors to proceed
to the interior of the Far East and bring these gems of the bird world
to our aviaries. This is the fervent wish of Alex Hampe.

Pheasant lovers in this country will be interested to learn that
the old Ornamental Pheasant Society has been reformed in Belgium,
and to inaugurate the occasion an excellent issue of the Journal has
been published this January in French.
Mme. Yvan Malisoux, who is an energetic and untiring Pheasant
breeder, has taken over the duties of Secretary, whilst the offices
of President and Vice-President are filled by those well-known authori-
ties M. Jean Delacour and Professor Alexandre Ghigi respectively.
In his message to Pheasant lovers, M. Delacour dwells on the
pre-war activities of the Ornamental Pheasant Society and mentions
that the Journal was published in both French and English up
to 1940. Unfortunately, he continues, the progress of the Society was
halted by the war and in 1946 a meeting was held in London to review
the situation. It was decided in view of the great decrease in mem-
bership due to the many restrictions prevailing, that the Society
as such should become dormant, the Avicultural Society to act mean-
while as a medium.

<bodyText confidence="0.997986111111111" page_id="56287779"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
Post-war conditions in England have not proved suitable for this
country to continue to serve as a centre for Pheasant breeders, and so
a group of Belgian fanciers resolved to resurrect the Ornamental
Pheasant Society without more delay, the membership to be inter-
national as before, and everyone interested in these beautiful birds
is invited to become a member.
The President says how happy he was to be in contact again with
so many of his old friends, in particular Mme. Malisoux and Professor
Ghigi, and at the same time he pays tribute to the memory of such
well-known fanciers as Y. Malisoux, Jean-Marie Derscheid, and
F. R. S. Balfour, whose deaths had occurred during the past ten years.
In her Editorial Mme. Malisoux remarks that although the present
Journal (No. 8) is a modest effort compared with its predecessors,
it is hoped nevertheless through its medium to bring together numerous
old members and to attract new ones. The subscription has been
provisionally fixed at 100 Belgian francs, and all members will receive
a copy of the Journal , which to commence with will be published twice
yearly. Generous terms are given to members who desire to advertise
therein and anyone interested in joining the Society is invited to write
without delay to Mme. Yvan Malisoux, Beez, prov. de Namur,
Belgium.
The Journal also contains interesting articles from the pens of
Professor Ghigi, Mme. Malisoux, M. Andre Dupont, and Dr. J. H. J. M.
Vallen, and there is little doubt that enthusiasm is running high on
the continent so far as the cult of the Pheasant is concerned. To date
nothing has been decided regarding the formation of an English
branch and we await developments.

The Chairman, opening the meeting, said that for the third year
in succession the Club had the honour and pleasure of the presence of
Madame Derscheid ; Dr. J. M. Derschied would long be remembered
as one of the greatest aviculturists in Europe and she sincerely hoped
that Madame Derscheid's visit would become an annual event. She
also welcomed Mr. Anthony Jack, Hon. Secretary of the British
Falconers' Club ; the aims of the Avicultural Society had much in
common with those of the British Falconers' Club and she urged closer
co-operation between the two organizations. A third guest,
Mr. H. B. Usher, at present in charge of the Bird Room at the Natural
History Museum, had for many years been of very great assistance to
members of the Society and she was glad to have this opportunity
of thanking him for all the help he had so willingly given.
The Chairman reported that the Council had awarded the
Society's medal to Mr. E. N. T. Vane for breeding the Noble Macaw
for the first time in Europe and the President presented the medal to
Mr. Vane.
The Chairman then paid tribute to Mr. C. S. Webb's outstanding
services to aviculture and in particular to his rediscovery of the
Grey-necked Picathartes and his great achievement in bringing
a specimen back alive to England. It was decided to publish a coloured
plate of this bird in the Avicultural Magazine to illustrate

a portrait. He had produced an excellent picture of the bird and the
Society was much gratified to be the first to reproduce a colour plate
of this rare and interesting species in its journal. Miss Barclay-Smith
asked Mr. Webb to accept the original painting of the Grey-necked
Picathartes as a token of appreciation and admiration from the
Avicultural Society for his outstanding achievement. The President
then presented Mr. Webb with the picture.
Mr. Webb said that he felt very greatly honoured to receive
this expression of the Society's appreciation of his efforts. The Society
had always been of very great interest to him and he hoped to help
it in every way possible for many years to come.
The Chairman then called upon Mr. Green to speak, saying that
he had done more illustrations for the Magazine than any other
artist and he was so well known to aviculturists that he needed no
introduction.
Mr. Roland Green dealt briefly with his early efforts to become
an artist and said that such success as he had enjoyed was mainly
due to the fact that he had been able to study birds at close quarters
at the Zoo, Foxwarren, and elsewhere. He then gave an exhibition
of lightning sketches, some twenty species, including such varied
birds as Godwit, Goshawk, Shama, Treecreeper, Curlew, Barn
Owl, Bearded Reedling, and Great Crested Grebe being drawn.
Hearty acclamation followed the Chairman's thanks to Mr. Green
on behalf of the Club.
Madame Derscheid was presented with a bouquet of spring flowers,
tied with the Belgian national colours, by Miss Kay Bonner on
behalf of the Club.
The next meeting of the Club will be on 8th March, 1950.
The Treasurer begs to remind all members who have not already paid ,
that subscriptions ($s.) became due on 1st January, 1950.

RECORDS OF PARROT-LIKE BIRDS BRED IN THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA. By Arthur A. Prestwich. (Prestwich :
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98418012195122" page_id="56287783"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
Chelmsford Road, Southgate, London, N. 14. $2.)
Although the southern United States are ideally situated as regards
climate for the keeping and breeding of foreign birds, it is only within
the past twenty-five or thirty years that serious aviculture has been in
vogue there. It was the Marquess of Tavistock, now Duke of Bedford,
who pointed out to a few American friends, who had an inclination
in that direction, that they might take up the breeding of some of the
rarer of the Australian Parrakeets and so help to prevent their
threatened extinction. He actually sent them a number of mated
pairs and the marked success that has been achieved must cause him
considerable satisfaction.
The Avicultural Society of America came into being prior to 1929,
in which year its first volume, Aviculture , made its appearance. Since
then its pages have contained many records of the successful breeding
of various species, including a number of the Parrot tribe. (Personally,
I dislike the term " Parrot-like Birds ", it is just as correct to call
them all " Parrots ", which they are.)
In compiling his forthcoming Records of Parrot-like Birds Bred in
Captivity Mr. Prestwich had to search through all the volumes of the
American Aviculture , and so impressed was he with the successes
recorded therein that he decided to publish a compilation of these in
a separate volume. This has now appeared and will be welcomed by
all who are interested in this group but do not possess a complete set
of Aviculture. The compiler has certainly done his work very thoroughly,
as is his wont, and his book is as complete a record as can be obtained,
though, as he says in the Preface, some records may not have been
published and so have escaped notice.
The success in America with certain species has been phenomenal ;
for instance, Dr. Patrick wrote of Bourke's Parrakeet in 1938 : " But
a decade ago the Bourke's Parrakeet was declared by Australian
ornithologists to be so near extinction that little hope was held for its
perpetuation. Lord Tavistock first called the attention of American
aviculturists to the fact, and very graciously supplied some breeding
stock. The result is avicultural history. Among others, such eminent
Californian breeders as Arnold, Purvine, Rudkin, Sheffler, Woods,
obtained breeding stock and were successful in propagating the species.
As a result there are to-day enough Bourke's in California alone to
assure the perpetuation of the species. Without applied aviculture
this could never have happened."
It is strange that we find no reference to the Many-coloured
Paarakeet. c c

The National Exhibition of Cage Birds.
The National Exhibition of Cage Birds was held at the Royal Horticultural (New)
Hall, Westminster, on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd December, 1949. Organized by Cage Birds,
the proceeds are being divided between the Forces Help Society (Lord Roberts'
Workshops) and the National Council of Aviculture.
The Foreign Section attracted 172 entries--a remarkable number at any time,
but more especially during the continued great shortage. The judge, our own
Allen Silver, must have been very pleased to find so many birds awaiting his placing.
Last year our President won the National Award of Merit and the National Silver
Trophy for the best foreign bird with his Brown-eared Bulbul. This year he secured
supreme honours with his exquisite West African Collared Sunbird {Anthreptes collaris
hypodila ).
The Psittacine classes were slightly down in numbers, but the quality was excellent.
First prize winners were R. Best's Peach-faced Lovebirds, H. Mitchell's Stanley
Parrakeet, P. A. Birch's Crimson-winged Parrakeets (Best Parrot-like Exhibit),
A. Ezra's Green-winged King Parrakeet, last year's winner, and J. Ford's Hyacinthine
Macaw. The last-named exhibitor was also second and third with a good pair of
Blue and Yellow and a Red and Green Macaw.
The class for Common Waxbills contained twenty-two entries and was won by
B. H. Dulanty's Fire Finches, with S. N. Pinfield's Orange-breasted second and
J. E. Williams' Bengalese third. Mrs. K. M. Scamell won the class for St. Helena
Waxbills, etc., with a pair of Cordon Bleus. Mannikins and Weavers was won by
J. Byrne's Chestnut-breasted Mannikins ; Whydahs by H. Cole's Paradise Whydah,
and Gouldian and Parrot Finches by T. R. W. Crewes' Parrot Finches.
The class for Long-tailed and other Grassfinches was the largest in the section,
twenty-six entries. G. Allerston's Painted Finch, possibly the only one in the country,
won from A. Ezra's Gay's Finch and T. R. W. Crewes' Parson Finches. Another
notable exhibit was B. H. Dulanty's Black-cheeked Waxbill.
Cardinals were unexpectedly numerous ; several good Green being beaten by
Mrs. E. Clarke's Red-crested.
All species Sunbirds, etc., contained but two entries : A. Ezra's West African
Collared and D. J. Hutson's Grey-throated.
Three classes were provided for all other insect and fruit-eating birds, divided
according to size. Small was won by D. J. Hutson's really splendid pair of Scarlet
Tanagers ; medium by B. H. Dulanty's Blue-headed Rock Thrush, followed by his
Superb Spreo Starlings, and large by G. C. Lynch's well-known Donaldson's
Touracou, repeating its last year's success. The class for Mynahs was won by
A. Ezra's Rothschild's Grackles.
The remaining class for lutinos, hybrids, etc., was won by a pair of Turquoisine X
Elegant Grass Parrakeets. bred by E. N. T. Vane, and exhibited by T. R. W. Crewes.
It was interesting to compare these birds with J. E. Williams' Blue-winged X
Turquoisine.
Finally, mention must be made of the fact that the Editor made her debut as a
judge. It is at any time rather a thankless task judging the talking, singing, and
whistling bird class, but especially when there are fifteen entries. After much patience
and perseverance the prize was finally awarded to Mrs. D. K. Draper's Hill Mynahs.

Additions to the London Zoo.
October, 1949- --The registered additions for the month numbered ninety-seven.
The most important arrivals from the visitor's point of view were three Great Birds
of Paradise ( Paradisea apoda) and one King Bird of Paradise (Cicinnurus regius) , part
of the collection brought by W. J. C. Frost from New Guinea. Other birds purchased
from this collection were one Malay Shama (Kittacincla macroura ), two Yellow-crowned
Bulbuls ( Trachycomus ocrocephalus) , two White-fronted Bronze-winged Pigeons
(Henicophaps albifrons) , two White-naped Pheasant-Pigeons (Otidiphaps nobilis aruensis ),
three Crowned Pigeons ( Goura cristata) , six Chinese Painted Quail (Excalfactoria
chinensis ), and one Two-wattled Cassowary (Casuarius bicarunculatus ).

Peter Scott presented a number of Ducks--one American Green-winged Teal
{Anas carolinensis ), two American Black Ducks ( Anas rubripes ), two Louisiana Mottled
Ducks * {Anas fulvigula maculosa ), and two Australian Grey Ducks {Anas superciliosa).
Eight Curlews {Numenius arquata) were presented by the Rotterdam Zoo ; two
Sclater's Curassows {Crax fasciolata ) by the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp ;
and two Golden Eagles {Aquila chrysaetos ) and two Imperial Eagles {Aquila heliaca)
by the Zagreb Zoo.
John Bowden presented one Pied Crow {Corvus albus), one African Barn Owl
{Tyto alba affinis ), and one Abyssinian Spotted Eagle-Owl {Bubo africanus cinerascens),
and W. H. Chippendale two Brazilian Kestrels (Sp. inc.).
Dr. Ludwig Koch presented a Puffin found by the police in London Road, Stanwell,
Middlesex !
Amongst other birds received were two Gadwells, one Wigeon, one American
Wigeon, two Pintails, three Bahama Ducks, four Indian Wood Ibis, four Golden
Plovers, one Mikado and two Lady Amherst's Pheasants, two Brazilian Hangnests,
three Superb Tanagers, and two Superb Manakins {Chiroxiphia pareola ).
The following were " Hatched in the Menagerie " : five Bob Whites, four Indian
Chukors, one hybrid Swinhoe's X Reeves's Pheasant, and one King Penguin. The
last-named was the first ever hatched in the Gardens, and the prospect of its being
reared looked good ; unfortunately, however, it was crushed, possibly by its parents,
when about four days old.
November , 1949. --The majority of the birds taken on the strength during the month
were bred in the Menagerie : ninety-four Budgerigars, one Long-tailed Grass Finch,
two Greenfinches, four Diamond Ground Doves, three Crested Pigeons, four Gambel's
Quails, and one Black-footed Penguin.
Very important from the avicultural point was the arrival of eleven Masked
Lovebirds, blue variety, mainly due to the good offices of F. H. Rudkin, jun. Here,
indeed, is a fine opportunity to establish this variety in England.
A Dumont's Grackle {Mino dumonti), two Banded-tailed Pigeons {Columba fasciata ),
and a Peacock Pheasant {Polyplectron bicalcaratum ) were received in exchange.
Whipsnade. ---The new arrivals included one Black-winged Peafowl, one Barnard's
Parrakeet, two Rock Pebbler Parrakeets, two Ring-necked Parrakeets, lutino, and
two American White Pelicans.

News from Italy.
George de Southoff writes from Florence :
" It may interest you to know that Italy, only a few years ago a poor market for
foreign birds, is now actually flooded with them. Senegal small seed-eaters are
largely imported from France. The price is 700-1,000 lire per pair (#1 = about
1,800 lire) ; Whydahs are a little dearer. An enterprising Turin dealer, Molinar, has
imported great quantities of Indian birds and species that are on sale there, I under-
stand chiefly for export abroad. But many have been put on the Italian market
through retail dealers who scarcely ever know what they sell, and often under many
names : Shamahs, Fruit-suckers, Garrulaxes, Blue Pies, Barbets, several Mynahs,
Bulbuls, Pekin Robins {Liothrix ), several Cranes, Adjutant Storks, Indian Porphyrios,
Flamingos, several Palaeornis, Cockatoos, Red-faced Lovebirds, Abyssinian Lovebirds
{A. taranta ), Red-crested Grey Cardinals, Bar-headed Geese--and last but not
least--Australian Broadtails, Eclectus, Hanging-Parrots, and many Lories and
Lorikeets. Prices are out of proportion ; Mynas 4,000 lire, Lories from 45,000 to
60,000 lire, per pair. A small shop here in Florence had : Pied, Bank, and Jungle
Mynahs, Rosellas, Pennants, Chattering Lories, Ornate, Forsten's and Violet-necked
Lorikeets {E. riciniata ), all in splendid condition. I did not buy as I cannot afford
the prices, not having the benefit of the exchange. I have never before seen such
a collection of birds for sale in Italy, and I have lived here all my life. Lately
Fischer's Lovebirds, I believe aviary-bred, have arrived from France. There are no
longer any cage-makers, and one has to be content with second-hand cages, a great
drawback. Wire netting is available, also wood, iron, etc., but labour costs far
too much."

Mistaken Identity of Plate of Common King Parrakeet.
The suggestion put forward by Mr. Yealland that the plate of a Common King
in Greene's work had been made from a skin of one of the " Island " Kings, raises
an even more interesting query in my mind.
An error may have occurred over an Amboina King, but having compared the
plate with a Salwatty King ( Alisterus dorsalis) living in my aviaries to-day, I am
convinced it does not represent this bird whose red is much darker. Greene's plate
of the Red Shining Parrakeet ( Pyrrhulopsis splendens ), for which my bird is frequently
mistaken, is much more like the Salwatty, the only differences I can detect are that
the Salwatty has an orange pink upper mandible the lower half of which is black
and lower mandible all black, compared with the all-black bill recorded in the
Red Shining, and its size generally is rather smaller than the Fijian bird.
The point which most interests me, however, is that in the Molucca Islands (Sula,
Amboina, Salwatty, etc.) a species of Parrakeet ( Alisterus) is found which closely
resembles another species in the 3,000 miles distant Fiji Islands (Kandavu, Koro
Island, Tabuan) ( Pyrrhulopsis ). In both cases the birds are externally at any rate
very similar, and moreover the sexes in both groups are alike. Yet those of one
group are classified with Common and Green-winged Kings ( Alisterus ) in which
the sexes are quite different. I am aware that the habits voice, etc., of the Common
Kings and the Shining Parrakeets are different. But this appears to indicate that
some clarification is required from scientists--a golden opportunity to arrange these
birds into three groups with the application of trinominal taxonomy.
Avicultural experience on this point is very interesting. The only successful record
of breeding Pyrrhulopsis in captivity is a Red Shining X Tabuan, in New Zealand
(Avicultural Magazine, 1944, 22). The only successful " Moluccan " breeding is
the Salwatty King in the Duke of Bedford's (then Marquis of Tavistock) aviaries,
at Barrington House, in 1940 (. Foreign Birds , 1940, 111).
Common Kings have frequently been bred--Greenwings only recently by our
President and also this year at the Zoo. Hybrids between these two (Greenwings
X Common) have been reared in my aviaries this year.
Attempts to breed hybrid Common King X Salwatty were abortive. The hen
Salwatty appeared to resent being mistaken for a cock by the Common King and
she 4 4 accounted " for two such mates, who not unnaturally being accustomed to
sober clad consorts made this error. The nearest approach to success was with
a cock Pennant, in which case the hen went to nest but only produced infertile eggs.
The Marquis of Tavistock records (see Avicultural Magazine, 1927, 259) that
only infertile eggs were obtained from a Red Shining-Sula Island mating, and
although a successful breeding is recorded of Crimson-wing X Sula Island King
(.Aprosmictus ) (see Avicultural Magazine, 1927, 259), the difficulty experienced in
trying to produce hybrids between birds of the Alisterus group in which the sexes
differ and those in which sexes are alike, or with Pyrrhulopsis birds is some indication
that the relationship is not so close as generally accepted at present.

Attraction of Jacaranda Tree for Sunbirds.
Just outside the Homestead building here (Melsetter, Southern Rhodesia) is one
very large Jacaranda mimosifolia , covered with its lavender flowers at this season of
the year (November) which, when they fall, carpet the ground with beauty for many
yards. Were this tree as difficult to grow as Amherstia nobilis, which is described as
44 the Queen of Flowering Trees ", it might well be claimed as the most beautiful in
the world. This particular specimen is surrounded by Eucalyptus growing to a
height of over 150 feet, and it must be invisible except from overhead. When it
comes into flower it is invaded by literally hundreds of Sunbirds. The Malachite
{Nectarinia famosa) is much the most common but the Lesser Double-collared {Cinnyris
chalybeus) is also present in numbers. Normally, two or three pairs is all one sees
about the garden ; there is no other garden within a distance of several miles
and only one within this circle of hills, and it is honoured by only a few pairs. Where
do the scores come from ? How do they know about this particular Jacaranda tree ?

Dimorphic Down Patterns.
The down pattern of the young of any waterfowl species is generally very well
standardized. I think therefore it is worth recording the dimorphism of two species.
Last spring we bred seven Ross's Snow Geese, three from one goose and four from
another. In each case the goslings hatched were of two strikingly different colours.
The majority were silver shading into grey on the back, the pattern being similar
to a greyleg or domestic dark gosling, the latter are of course yellow and olive but the
distribution of the two colours is similar. The other down pattern is a clear yellow
without any down shadings. The Ross gosling of this colour being of a similar shade
to a white domestic gosling.
There is as far as I can see no difference whatsoever between the juvenile plumage
of these two forms.
When I met Peter Scott after his return from the Perry river we were both rather
surprised that the other was already aware of the surprising difference in the colour
schemes of baby Ross ! But it is curious that it apparently had not occurred amongst
the good number of Ross that had been bred in Europe in the past. Monsieur Delacour
has probably bred the greatest number and as he had not heard of it I think it is
fairly safe to say that the variation cannot have occurred at Cleres.
The other species in which dimorphism occurs here is in the young Puna Teal.
In this case the difference is evenly in the depth of colour, the ground colour and
pattern is the same in each case but the density of colouring on the dark ducklings is
about twice that of the paler and commoner birds.

Bateleur Eagles in Captivity.
I have kept several Bateleur Eagles. The first was full grown and lived in a wire-
netted enclosure. I awoke one morning to see a vague shadowy form on my pillow,
and as the light strengthened I realized that Kisau must have escaped. His talons
were within a few inches of my eyes. Eventually I summoned up sufficient courage
to put forth a tentative hand and, much to my relief, Kisau put down his head and
rubbed the back of it on my face ! Thereafter he remained at large but insisted on
sleeping on the ground and was killed one night by a jackal. Another was fed on
bats which were caught as they came from out the corrugated iron of my bungalow
roof in a wire trap. He was very popular with some lady visitors till they came and
reported that when he had been fed they heard the bats going on squeaking inside
him, which didn't seem to them to be gentlemanly behaviour. This Eagle habitually
sailed along some 2 to 3 feet off the ground and came regularly to my office when
it was nearing lunch time when he was fed, and pulled the leg of my trousers till
I got up and went back to give him his food.

I have often seen the opinion expressed--though never, I think, in our Magazine--
that exhibitions such as the annual " Crystal Palace " bird-show fulfil, among other
functions, that of popularizing bird-keeping with the lay public. In fact, the exact
reverse is the case, as anyone who has taken the trouble to listen to the comments of
the layman at the shows in question or the comments in the press will be aware.
How indeed could it be otherwise ? The average person is profoundly ignorant of all
aspects of bird-life, but though he will view with anything from indifference to
amusement any cruelties inflicted on such animals as pigs, rabbits, or Magpies, he
feels a tender sentiment for small birds, and having perhaps seen Goldfinches or
Chaffinches at liberty, he is not unnaturally revolted when he sees them penned up
singly in tiny cages. The fact that in most cases (though not all ; I have seen a sick
Chough at a show) the exhibits are in good condition, and that they would not be
so were they not normally kept in far more spacious quarters is, of course, not under-
stood by him, and so the anti-bird-keeping fraternity receives another convert.

Though as a keen aviculturist I appreciate the skill and patience that has been needed to
maintain some of the birds shown in their good condition, yet even I cannot help feeling
that they would all have been far happier had they been left in their accustomed
aviaries, and would have been left there had their owners cared more for their birds
than for their own aggrandisement. At every show there are a few birds that panic
at the crowds and strange surroundings, and spend most of the time madly trying
to escape. Such birds are doubtless quite tame and happy in their usual home (where
their owners would have kept them if they had any real feeling for them), but at a
bird show they are a misery to themselves, a disgrace to their owner, and above all a
most potent weapon for those who would abolish all aviculture.
Apart from satisfying human vanity, of what use is the bird-show from an avi-
culturist's point of view ? So far as wild species are concerned, his aim should surely
be, apart from the aesthetic and emotional pleasure he derives from his pets, to study
them under more intimate conditions than are possible in the field, and to try to
reproduce them in captivity without losing the natural grace and beauty that Evolu-
tion, or the Creator, or what you will, has bestowed upon them, and not to try to
" improve " them in accordance with some fancier's idea of what they ought to
look like.
We see from our domestic birds (I am talking here only of those not bred for
utilitarian purposes, which of course is a rather different matter), the results of
following such false ideals of excellence. Who can visit a Pigeon show and view the
gross monstrosities there displayed without feeling shame that man has contrived
such hideous creatures from such a beautiful species as the Rock Dove ? True, some
fancy Pigeons, such as the Archangel, are things of some grace and beauty, and the
Canary and Budgerigar have not yet produced anything really frightful, but I feel
very strongly that aviculturists should breed their birds true to the wild type (in-
variably more beautiful than anything man can derive from it), and not succumb
to the silly idea that an extra large bird is better than a normal sized one, which is
usually the first step on the path away from natural beauty.
Aviculturists have contributed a very great deal to the study of birds. I think I am
right in saying that many, if not most, of those who have contributed to our know-
ledge of bird-behaviour have either been confirmed aviculturists or have become
so for the duration of their studies. Nevertheless, a very large body of people consider
us all as ignorant sadists with no love of or knowledge of birds. A friend of mine
who belongs to a society much larger and more influential than our own has been
informed by one of its leaders that they " would like to stamp out all bird-keeping ".
There is much that aviculturists can do to combat such an attitude. They can
invite non-aviculturists who are interested in birds to see birds kept under proper
conditions where they can draw their own conclusions as to the cruelty involved.
They can stress where possible the work that has been done for ornithology by avi-
culturists. They can agitate that the birds in aviaries in public parks be either
properly looked after or not kept at all. And lastly, they can above all refrain from
supporting bird shows, which exhibit aviculture to the general public in the worst
possible light.

{Capito aurovirens Cuv.)
By C. S. Webb
The American Barbets have never been well known to aviculturists
in this country, which is a pity considering their beauty and tameness.
With the exception of the Toucan-like Barbet--Semnornis--
(figured in the Avicultural Magazine in July, 1939) they belong
to two closely related genera (Capito and Eubucco ), in which the sexes
differ in plumage and in which all are small or medium-sized.
The Plaintive Barbet is one of the dullest of the group, but
nevertheless is much more attractive in life than is suggested by the
accompanying plate. In the male a broad band of pillar-box red,
stretching almost from eye to eye, extends over the head to the nape
of the neck. The breast is brilliant orange yellow in both sexes.
The female differs from the male in having grey on the head. The
one figured (on the left) was drawn from a living specimen received
by the London Zoo on 24th January, 1947. This was not only the
first of its kind but was the first of any species of American Barbet
to be exhibited in the Zoological Society's collection.
It inhabits Upper Amazonia, which comprises north-west Brazil,
and Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru east of the Andes. This region is
by no means easy of approach whether from the Atlantic or Pacific
coasts, which probably accounts for the lack of knowledge of the
Plaintive Barbet in its wild state. Practically nothing has been
recorded of its habits though there is no reason to suppose that they
differ from those of any of the other South American Barbets. It
inhabits well-wooded country, or forest, and subsists on insects, fruits,
and berries. I am unable to trace the origin of the popular name
and the female in our collection was silent.
A second member of the genus Capito was recently introduced by
the writer. This is the handsome Black-spotted Barbet (Capito niger ),
from British Guiana, which resembles the Plaintive Barbet in size
and habits.

AVIAN OLD AGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987523023809524" page_id="56287796"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
By The Duke of Bedford
For mammals, including man, the period preceding death from old
age is too often rendered miserable by rheumatic afflictions, internal
growths, or malnutrition consequent on loss of teeth. With birds, on
the contrary, nature seems to deal gently under like circumstances,
especially in cases of " genuine 55 old age, as distinct from the
" premature " old age which is induced by too close confinement.
Some people imagine that the protection from " wear and tear "
experienced by a captive bird, including one kept in very close
confinement, lengthens its days. In point of fact, nothing could be
further from the truth. If captive birds belonging to a certain species
ever, as a rule, live longer than wild ones, it is simply and solely
because they are protected from death by violence, or from starvation
during periods of exceptionally severe weather. Exercise, which birds
in very close confinement lack, is one of the prime factors in retarding
old age. I have on more than one occasion added years to the life of
a Parrot or Parrakeet absolutely on its last legs from senile decay
merely by allowing it complete liberty.
The life of a small pet bird, even such a domestic species as a
Canary, can be prolonged greatly by keeping it in a really roomy
cage, about 2 ft. 6 in. by 18 inches by 18 inches, and by seeing that
the cage is not cluttered up with unnecessary perches and swings and
that one of the main perches is a natural twig. This last point is very
important. Keeping a bird the whole time on thick, hard, artificial
perches, all the same size, with no resilience or change of grip for the
feet, is like condemning a person to sit always on a hard form without
a back and never allowing him the luxury of an armchair. Admittedly,
a natural twig is a little less easy to keep firmly in its place and a little
less easy to keep clean, but anyone who is not prepared to go to
a small amount of trouble in the interests of his pets should not keep
birds at all. I know of a Canary x Green Singing Finch hybrid who
all his life has been caged and looked after as above advised, and at
fourteen years he is still as sprightly, sings as freely, and has as perfect
feet and nails as he had when only two.
As a group, birds are long-lived creatures and among many genera
death from real old age is a decidedly unusual phenomenon. Among
waterfowl, in the experience of a life-time, I can only recollect one
case. The first pair of Magellan Geese we ever had whose age, when
imported, was unknown, after many seasons ceased to breed. For
a few years more the old Darby and Joan still went about together ;
then one dropped out and, in due course, the other.
Of all the Parrot-like birds I have kept I can only recollect about

half a dozen which have died of genuine old age, and of these some
were obviously senile when I got them.
Only three which were not noticeably senile on arrival have grown
old in my aviaries.
One was a cock Rock Peplar, adult when I received him. When
he began to show obvious signs of age I gave him his liberty, which
rejuvenated him considerably until he was killed by an Owl.
A cock Princess of Wales 5 Parrakeet, also of unknown age when
I bought him, bred for some seasons and then began to show signs of
anno domini. He lost interest in domestic affairs, took longer over
his moult, and spent an increasing amount of time quietly sleeping
and resting. His appetite, however, remained good and he never
looked actually ill. At the end he went out quickly, quietly, and to
all appearances without pain.
At the time of writing a white cock Roseate Cockatoo is going the
same way. He and his albino mate reached me about fourteen years
ago, their age being then unknown. They were not a very successful
breeding pair but they did succeed in rearing two grey young, which
I still have. For the last few seasons they have not nested and the cock
is now obviously a very old gentleman indeed. His breast has assumed
the dark pink characteristic of very old members of his species ; his
wings, formerly pure white, are now flecked with pink, and he is
slow in finishing his moult. It was my intention, after bringing the
pair over to Woburn, to train them as liberty birds. The old cock
never gave any trouble, keeping close to the aviaries. His mate,
however, probably because albino birds often have defective eyesight,
behaved in a foolish and erratic fashion. She started off flying very
high and then settled not in a tree but on the ground. The following
days he was seen sitting on a gate near the outskirts of the park. Next
morning she actually returned home, joined her mate, and flew down
with him on to the top of the aviary. Any normal bird would have
been safe after that, anyhow for a time, but the foolish creature went
off again on her own the same afternoon and was captured some days
later at a farm nearly twenty miles away ! I brought her back
considerably the worse for wear, but she has since recovered though
she has not given up the bad habit of plucking her neck which she
started during the war, possibly as a result of bad feeding. The old
cock, meanwhile, takes life very quietly, sleeping a great deal but
now and again whittling his perch or the block of wood hung up in
the flight, thus showing that he is not unwell. His aviary door is
always open but he seems to have decided that there is no place like
home, and goes out less and less frequently and then only to pay
a friendly call on his two sons and their wives who occupy aviaries
further down the row. How long he will go on it is difficult to say,
but it is evident that he is content and that his declining days are

peaceful. He does not even seem to feel the cold for he often sits
sleeping in the chilly and drenching rain when there is shelter within
easy reach.
I have referred just now to the thick block of wood which I fasten
up in all my Cockatoo aviaries to provide the birds with occupation.
It is interesting to note how even in the matter of the attention they
pay to it, individual birds of the same species vary.
The old cock does a little mild nibbling of his block ; his younger
mate, who would be far better occupied on the block than on her
own person, never touches hers. One son and his mate do a moderate
amount of nibbling. The other pair will soon have demolished their
block entirely.

NOTES ON A VERY ORDINARY COLLECTION
OF BIRDS, MAINLY BRITISH
By H. Murray
As a boy I kept birds in a succession of aviaries and cages for
a number of years, but circumstances forced me to stop that for a
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99260268" page_id="56287798"  page_num="54" year="" vol="">
considerable time. It was not until a year before the war that I started
again and built an aviary of roughly 250 square feet which I proceeded
to overstock with a collection that one would find it impossible to
buy to-day. In due course the war came, my birds went, and I spent
the next six years dreaming of the perfect aviary that I would build
when I was demobilized.
There was really quite a lot to be said for this sort of aviculture.
Consideration of cost, space, etc., did not exist, and one's whole view
was conditioned by the birds that one could obtain before the war,
but at last came September, 1945, " demob," and a return to a civil
life whose dissimilarity to my pre-war existence I only vaguely realized.
My garden of some half an acre had been uncared for for five years,
and it was obviously necessary to do something about that before
birds could be seriously considered. Also, there were poles to cut and
materials to be collected by devious means. Army experience is not
without its use at such times. Then came the great pruning of ideas
as the financial aspect of the matter began to make its presence felt.
However, by September, 1946, the large flight and shelter were
completed and the remaining portions have been finished as the
materials became available.
The sketch plan shows the outline of the aviaries, and the way in
which they were stocked at the beginning of this season (1949). The
shape of the shelter and its position allows for a number of flights of
different sizes, always a useful consideration with a mixed collection.
The external dimensions are governed by the size of the ground

available. There are several drawbacks to this layout, the principal
one being that no entry is possible into the shelter after dark without
disturbing the birds in the outside aviaries, so there is no lighting.
Also, many people will be of the opinion that the large aviary
would be much better if divided into separate breeding compartments,
but this, although undoubtedly desirable from a purely breeding
point of view, would make a lot of extra work for which no time is
available, and would also do away with the great pleasure that one
can obtain through watching a mixed collection of birds in a large
aviary. No comparable interest can be enjoyed by observing birds in
small aviaries or even more so in cages. The critic will reply that the
birds cannot really be seen as they are apt to get wild and hide
themselves in a large flight, but to my way of thinking it is a great
asset to a bird to spend at least a part of the year in a large space
where it is able to enjoy unrestricted flight and has the opportunity
of foraging for at least part of its food.
The shelter is built of wood and is constructed so that apart from
the side facing the main aviary where all the glass can be removed
in the summer, there are alternate panels along the sides of wood and
glass. This ensures that the cages are light, and also in the winter
when the sun is low, enables the inmate of each cage and shelter to
have an hour or so of direct sun on those days when the sun shines.
The wooden panels allow the bird to get out of the sun if it so desires,
and keep the place warmer. The glass should be vita glass, but even
without being so, the birds always take the opportunity df sitting in
what sun there is in the winter. In the summer, when the sun is high,
little direct sunshine comes into the cages except in the late evening,
but as every bird has access to an outside flight this is unimportant.
The floor of the shelter is unboarded and covered with sand. The
floors of the actual shelters to the aviaries are netted and covered
with peat. Nothing solid is allowed to stand on any floor to provide
cover for mice. Mice do come in from time to time, but they cannot
live there.
All the cages shown in the accompanying plan have access to
outside flights and are 3 feet long, 3 feet high, and 2 feet- deep. All
birds are fed inside the shelter, a matter for congratulation on wet
mornings, and the water does not freeze so easily in the winter.
Slight heat is also provided. A solid division cuts the shelter into two
parts, thus enabling birds in the main aviary and the Parakeet aviaries
to have the use of their flights in the winter without letting a cold
draught come through on to the cages.
The foregoing description gives a rough idea of the shelter. The
flights are plain pole and wire constructions about 7 feet high with
flat roofs. The vegetation has had a rather thin time of it so far as
Bullfinches, Budgerigars, etc., do not go well with much green growth,

but a considerable quantity of oats, wheat, canary seed, etc., grow
and provide green seeds in their season. The giant hogweed has also
proved itself an excellent plant for an aviary as it always seems to
have a certain amount of greenfly which the birds relish, and the
broad flat flowers prove very attractive to the birds. I am not sure
if the flowers themselves are picked and eaten, or if it is the insect
life attracted by the flowers that the birds take, but Redpolls, Siskins,
Waxbills, and even Waxwings spend a long time picking about on
the heads. I think that it is the flowers that are eaten. Large quantities
of green food are given every day when available.
Nesting and roosting places of gorse, etc., are provided, but the
two types of nestboxes that have proved most popular are, firstly,
cylinders of wire netting about 9 inches long bound about with leafy
twigs and hung from the roof, and secondly, a half-open box with
the back, top, and bottom solid and with thin branches nailed to
form the sides. I believe that birds prefer these to boxes with solid
walls, as the box gives them a feeling of security and they can still
see out of the sides. Another useful form of nesting site is provided
by hanging a short crooked branch under one of the roof timbers
and lashing twigs, etc., to the sides to give some cover and to hold
the nest securely. Birds which normally nest on branches seem to
like these, and they are quite safe from mice. It may be mentioned
before leaving the subject of nesting boxes, that I have never known
one of these used by a Finch unless it was facing south or west. I do
not believe that this is coincidence, but is a deliberate preference.
Birds in their habits are infinitely variable and it has always seemed
to me that too much dogmatism is displayed by people writing about
them. We have all suffered during these last ten years from the
prevalent idea of being " typed 55 and forced to conform to the
theories of the powers that be. In the main, the theory may be correct
but the dragooning is not always satisfactory. This, I believe, applies
as much to birds as humans.
With the clear understanding that the following remarks apply
solely to my own birds, and are not intended as general statement
on the species mentioned, I will venture to give the results of breeding,
or non-breeding, of the species that I have kept this year, and any
other odd facts that have been observed and warrant inclusion.
In my opinion, the finest bird for a large outdoor aviary is the
Waxwing. Hardy, tame, friendly, and easy to feed, it is always the
bird most admired by visitors, and one cannot help feeling that the
reason why it is not more widely kept is due to the fact that it is
frequently wrongly fed, and I feel sure that this is the cause of many
being lost. The Waxwing is usually classed as a softbill and fed
accordingly, but in actual fact it can be kept in perfect health and
great liveliness without even seeing an insect.

58 H. MURRAY-A VERY ORDINARY COLLECTION OF BIRDS
Its natural diet consists of berries, and in the northern woods where
it lives these grow with a richness and abundance seldom seen in
England. My birds have been with me for two and a half years and
have thrived on a diet of rowan berries for as long as these can be
kept, usually until March, and for the rest of the year on dates cut
up into small pieces. Soft food is provided every day but is seldom
touched. Should the supply of dates or rowan berries fail, and the
birds be forced to soft food, their condition falls away at once. In
pre-war years Waxwings were fed on currants, but these are unobtain-
able now. Occasionally maggots are eaten, and I have seen them
take black fly, but they make no effort to hunt for live food. The
shells of groats are eaten and the seeds of chickweed are also pecked
off and eaten whole. The heads of milk thistle are eaten also ripe
or over-ripe apple.
This bird has a reputation for sitting about a lot, and will certainly
doze during the heat of the day, but the mornings and evenings find
them active enough, and their strong swift flight is beautiful to watch.
Due to their habit of living in dense woods they have a tremendous
power of flight control, and can turn in their own length while in full
flight.
When frightened by Hawks these birds " freeze ", usually against
a branch. The head is pointed half upward and the birds stay
motionless and can even be picked up. In a pine tree the bird must
resemble a cone very closely and relies on this for its safety. Given
plenty of space a Waxwing is a fine bird for a cold aviary. I have
two of these birds which I think are a pair. They are always together
and feed and display to one another but so far have made no attempt
to nest. I have never heard any sound from them except a long
drawn out tseee. Waxwings are safe with the smallest of other birds.
Wheatears, of which I have a pair, are neat and tidy birds, and
apart from a habit the cock bird has of chasing the hen about, they
seem harmless enough to other birds. Towards the end of the summer
I saw the cock catch insects and feed the hen, and the hen carried
moss about, but they made no real attempt to breed. I erected stone
crannies into which they frequently went, but no serious attempt at
raising a family was made. During the winter they were fed on
maggots and soft food, but in the summer they seemed to find most
of their own supplies themselves. The " bobbing " and tail flirting
of a Wheatear makes them conspicuous in an aviary.
Snow Buntings and Lapland Buntings are attractive birds, and
both have a considerable plumage change in the spring and again in
the autumn. The spring change is made without a moult, but in the
autumn the moult is very heavy indeed, so heavy that the birds lose
most of their flights and can only fly in a clumsy and blundering
fashion. Both of these birds live in the stony wastes of the far north,

and both have the long claws of a Lark or Pipit, but apart from the
similarities mentioned above, they have little in common.
The Snow Bunting is the more lethargic of the two, but the cock
is reasonably active and is very conspicuous in his summer dress of
black and white. He seems to flaunt his bright plumage deliberately
and goes out of his way to call attention to himself. A favourite habit
is to try to balance on a thin twig, an obviously impossible thing to
do with his long claws, and flap his wings wildly to keep himself
steady. This seems quite deliberate, and I have seen my bird do this
on the same twig every morning for some weeks.
Movement on the ground is either by hopping or walking, but the
whole method of progression seems to be done with the idea of the
bird making himself as obvious as possible, and there is a constant
wing flapping and tail flirting. The hen is much more subdued. The
cock bird sang for a few weeks only, principally in the evening. The
song is loud, piping, and very liquid, much more Blackbird than
Bunting. No attempt was made to nest.
During the winter the Lapland Bunting is Sparrow-like in its
plumage, but in the spring the cock grows a black head and bib,
and chestnut patches on the nape of the neck. This bird is active
and a fine singer. He loves to sit on a broad branch out in the open
and sing for hours at a stretch. He cannot be said to perch as his
feet cannot grip anything small, but he squats low down and rests
his body on the bough. During the spring my bird sang a pure
Goldfinch song which I think he must have copied from birds in the
aviary, but later on he sang what I should imagine was his true song,
four or five notes uttered in a clear and bell-like tone.
A lot of time is spent on the ground, and when in the open the
bird seems to press his body as close to the ground as possible and
usually walks. Every sense seems to concentrate on making the bird
inconspicuous. When one considers the difference in habits between
the two Buntings, one wonders how the Snow Bunting survives the
many risks run by conspicuous birds from Hawks and other enemies.
Admittedly, I have never seen a Snow Bunting in its natural haunts,
but although I agree that the black and white pattern of the summer
plumage may tone in with odd patches of snow when the bird is still,
this certainly does not apply when the bird is on the move. The
flight of both Buntings in an aviary is clumsy, fluttering, and slow.
After two years of unsuccessful effort I managed to rear Bullfinches
this year (1949). Last year all save one died, but this season I have
reared nine young from one pair in four nests. It seems that live
food is essential, and the parent birds have eaten a prodigious quantity
of maggots and black fly. In addition much green food is consumed
and sprouting seeds are eagerly taken. Young Bullfinches are most
attractive little creatures, but seem loth to commence to feed on their

own. It is seldom that they make any effort to feed themselves until
they are nearly four weeks old, and then only feed in a most desultory
fashion. Berry fruits and sunflower seeds are greatly appreciated, and
it is a great pity that these birds are so destructive to vegetation as
their appearance adds colour to an aviary.
Last year the Goldfinches reared young, but this season they did
nothing except build nests all the summer, laying an odd egg now
and then which they did not incubate.
A pair of Linnets had three nests and reared two from the first
nest and three from the second. The third nest was taken by mice.
In each case the nest was built in the same patch of gorse. When
feeding young the parents ate large quantities of green food, but
touched no insects as far as I could see. Linnets seem to be the easiest
of the British Finches to rear.
Lesser Redpolls are active birds in an aviary, and although in
previous years I have had young birds live to the age of ten days,
I have never succeeded in rearing them before. This year my pair
reared four young. The nestlings are fed almost exclusively on live
food, and this summer there was no shortage of black fly. The parent
birds would clear a large heavily infested plant in an hour or so.
The young birds are very forward and fly at twelve days old. It is not
many days before they start to pick up food for themselves, but even
so, the parents feed the youngsters for a considerable time after they
have flown. In the wild state Redpolls usually nest fairly high up,
but my pair nested in a bush barely 3 feet above the ground.
Siskins are too well known to need any description, but so far
I have never been lucky enough to breed any of these pretty little
Finches. This year my birds followed the same pattern as the previous
one, and spent the summer thinking about nesting but never really
getting down to work. It is probable that better results would be
obtained if there were several pairs in the one enclosure.
The foregoing notes complete the tale of the resident birds in the
large aviary. During the summer I acquired a few Orange-cheeked
Waxbills, Avadavat Waxbills, Ruficauda Finches, and a pair of
Diamond Doves. Next year I hope to try to breed some of the foreign
species, for these small birds are most attractive. They are always so
active and interested in all that passes. It will be a good day when
they can be imported again and sold at a reasonable price.
Gockatiel reared eight young in two nests, a three and a five, but
these birds are so widely bred that there is no point in doing more
than just recording the fact.
The Peach-faced Lovebirds made no attempt to nest, although they
were in very lovely condition all the summer. I do not think that
they are a true pair.
Bourke's Parrakeets provided me with my biggest disappointment

this year. When given their nest box one bird immediately took this
over and commenced laying. After a short time the other bird started
to go into the box. I had my suspicions, but left the birds alone.
When both birds spent all day in the box and only came off for food
and then dashed straight back again, my suspicions were confirmed.
Both my birds were hens and had laid ten eggs between them.
I exchanged one bird for a cock, but no further nesting was attempted.
Zebra Finches did moderately well and reared four young, but the
Budgerigars spent the summer churning out young with commendable
efficiency and regularity.
The Elegant Parrakeets made no attempt to nest, and spent most
of the summer moulting.
They were late 1948 birds so nothing much could be expected. At
the end of July they were turned out into the large aviary, and I must
say that they appear closer to their name there than they ever did in
their small aviary. Their flight is attractive and their colours show off
to much better advantage when they are given the opportunity of
flying properly. The general idea that Grass Parrakeets are harmless
to vegetation seems to be one of the inherited fallacies with which
aviculture abounds. In a month these birds had completely stripped
a large hawthorn bush.
This, then, brings me to the end of my notes on a very ordinary
collection. Perhaps in time I shall manage to acquire some birds
that are somewhat more exotic, but the keeping and breeding of the
few species with which I have been successful has been intensely
interesting, and the experience gained may perhaps prove valuable in
time to come when those aviculturists who missed the halcyon days
before the war may have the opportunity of obtaining some of the
more attractive birds which have so far been little more than names
to them.

By J. Delacour
Since my return from Europe at the end of August, 1949, I have
had the pleasure of visiting many of my aviculturist friends in different
parts of the United States. They were all eager to hear my news of
European aviculture, and I believe the reverse to be true, so that
I venture to give here a short account of what I have seen during
the past few months. The collection of live birds broadly belong to
three different categories--public zoos' bird-houses and pens, private
amateurs' aviaries, and game birds, waterfowl, or other bird farms.
I. Eastern Collections
In the vicinity of New York one of my first week-end visits was to
Mrs. M. Erlanger's country place, at Elberon, New Jersey. There is
certainly the choicest private collection of small birds in eastern
North America, housed and cared for with all possible refinements.
It includes both softbills and seedeaters, grouped in a dozen or more
very comfortable flights with large indoor compartments. In a long
garden aviary along the house, during the summer are kept such
insectivorous species as the Red-bellied Niltava, White-capped Red-
start, Indian Crested Tit, Fork-tailed Flycatcher ; also frugivorous
birds, such as Quetzals and various Tanagers. Two odd Crested
Bulbuls, a Red-eared and Yellow, happening to constitute a pair,
nested and hatched two young hybrids which were unfortunately
destroyed by other birds. There are also Red Pileated Finches,
European Goldfinches, much appreciated here and breeding, and
a few others. In other aviaries, two pairs of Shamas nested but failed
to rear their young, as too often happens, as I found out at Cleres
whenever they were kept in outdoor aviaries, while they reared brood
after brood in the greenhouses, which I never could explain.
One of the pearls of the collection is a beautiful pair of Scarlet
Cocks of Rock, finger-tamed and quarrelling to a minimum. The
male, thanks to a careful diet of tomatoes and other appropriate food,
has kept his brilliant deep red colour which in zoos too often turns
dull orange. They have already played at nesting, and hopes are
high for a brood some time ! There are elsewhere many pairs of
Australian, African, and other Finches and Waxbills ; several broods
of Gouldians, Diamond Sparrows, Avadavats, Cordon Bleus were
reared last summer, and also hybrids between Masked and Long-
tailed Grassfinches. The outstanding success of the season, however,
was the breeding of two Yellow-winged Sugar-Birds, which had been
out of the nest a couple of weeks when I saw them. An excellent
Racket-tailed Drongo, a tame European Robin, and Vermilion Fly-
catcher must also be mentioned.

I often go to the Bronx and Philadelphia zoos. It was a delight
to see Mr. Cordier and the wonderful birds he had brought from the
Congo : African Peacocks, Black Guinea-Fowl, Hartlaub's Ducks,
Finfoot, several Sunbirds, including the beautiful little Royal (jV. regia),
and many others. In 1939 he and I had planned a similar expedition
for the benefit of the Cleres collection. . . . But Mr. Crandall will tell
us more about the birds at the Bronx where, I am glad to say, the
aviaries continue to be beautifully kept and filled with wonderful
birds, thanks to him and to George Scott, the perfect head
keeper.
At Philadelphia, great progress has been made with the birds. The
very wise director, Mr. F. Shelly, has entrusted them to a young
curator, Mr. J. A. Griswold, who has proved both enthusiastic and
efficient. The larger birds are very well represented ; the collection
of Waders, Waterfowl, and Pheasants are good ; many Rheas have
been reared last summer. The small birds' house is being completely
modernized ; it will be reopened next May. No doubt it is going to
be one of the most attractive in existence. It will not be easy, however,
to beat those at St. Louis, at the Bronx, and also at Brookfield
(Chicago), where I had the pleasure to see recently the great improve-
ments just effected to the already very fine bird accommodation.
The curator, my old friend Karl Plath, was on his way back from
Australia with a wonderful consignment. It was bad luck to miss
him by a few days.
There are several very good collections of Pheasants and of water-
fowl in New Jersey and in New England, some kept entirely for the
pleasure of their owners, others as commercial breeding farms, several
a combination of the two.
The largest of the former is that of Mr. J. Livermore, at West
Redding, Connecticut. In a number of enclosures, pens, and aviaries
my friend keeps hundreds of Swans, Geese, and Ducks as well as
Rheas, Cranes, Peafowl, Pheasants, Quails, and Doves. The waterfowl
collection is excellent, far the largest in America. All the more
current species are represented, often by a dozen or more pairs.
Among the rarest are Blue-winged, Ashy-headed, Red-breasted,
Emperor, Orinoco, Ross's, and Maned Geese, Coscoroba Swans,
Baer's and White-eyed Pochards, Ruddy Ducks, Golden-eyes, Cape,
and Marbled Teal, Comb Ducks, Australian and South African
Sheldrakes, and Crested Ducks. A number of young have been
reared during the last season : three Cereopsis, several Gray Lags and
Bar-headed Geese, Black Swans, many Carolina Wood-Ducks, Red-
crested Pochards, some Mandarins, Chiloe Wigeons, and Ruddy
Sheldrakes. There are White-necked and Stanley's Cranes. Among
the Pheasants figure pairs of Edwards, Temminck's, and Satyr
Tragopans, Brown and Blue Eared Pheasants. The collection of

Doves is very good, including Plumed Ground, Grayson's, Bronze-
winged, Galapagos, and many other species. Mr. Livermore also
keeps a number of Budgerigars, a tame Piping Bullfinch, and a pair
of very amusing Violet Jays, from Brazil.
A little to the north, at Litchfield, Dr. Dillon Ripley has gathered
a very choice collection of waterfowl on a delightful little lake fed
by a stream, with suitable accommodation for the cold winter months.
He keeps Black-necked Swans, Red-breasted, Emperor, Ross's,
Cackling, and Bernicle Geese, and also many ducks, including Baer's
and White-eyed Pochards, and three rare and lovely Philippine
Mallards. I often go to West Redding and to Litchfield, as I enjoy
greatly the company of my two excellent friends and their birds.
There are several professional breeders in New England. Mr. L.
Renkavinsky, Fairfield, Connecticut, runs a regular farm, but he also
rears many Pheasants and waterfowl, including some of the rarer
species. He loves his birds and is very successful with them.
At Millbury, Massachusetts, Mr. J. Deeter, another farmer with
a great love for, and a long experience with waterfowl, is doing
exceedingly well. Last summer I saw there two nice young Ross's
Geese, bred from an old pair born at Cleres and sent before the war
to Mr. G. S. Sibley, who has unfortunately since given up birds.
Mr. Deeter also had young White-fronted and Bernicle Geese, Black
Swans, and many Ducks, particularly Carolina Wood-Ducks. It is
great fun to visit him, as he is so pleased to exchange ideas and data
on birds, and his cordial welcome is touching.
Mr. G. Humphrey has made a hobby of farming and since a few
years he has built up, mostly for his own satisfaction but on a sound
business basis, a great agricultural enterprise at Tilverton, Rhodes
Island, the 8-rod Stock Farm. A large game farm is a part of
it, under the very able management of Mr. Leon Campbell. I made
a most interesting visit to them in September. Mr. and Mrs.
Humphreys and Mr. and Mrs. Campbell gave me a delightful
reception, and I took great interest in the place. A very large walled-in
enclosure contains hundreds of well-built pens for Pheasants and
Quails. All the installations, carefully planned, are made of unusually
good materials and appear to be extremely suitable. There are
uncommonly good breeding coops made of concrete and of steel, and
excellent heated winter quarters for tender species. In other words,
one of the finest establishments for ornamental game birds that I have
ever seen. All the commoner species are there as well as the rare
ones, such as Tragopans, Monals, Edwards, and Imperial Pheasants,
the various Firebacks, Mikado, Elliots, and Peacock Pheasants, and
Spicifer Peafowls. Young birds were numerous and healthy. Further
away, large pens for waterfowl, both wild species and domestic
varieties, occupy much space, and a new pond was being dug. No

very rare species have yet been acquired, but I was much interested
in two pairs of particularly dark and rather small Canada Geese, of
unknown origin, smaller and darker than the White-cheeked sub-
species ( occidentalis ) from the north-west coast, which might well
belong to a still unknown form.
I think that the 8-rod farm has a great future, and I was glad
to congratulate both Mr. Humphreys and Mr. Campbell for such an
achievement in a comparatively short time.
At the end of October I went, as I usually do, to the garden party
given by Mr. and Mrs. H. L. Lehman, at their Dew Drop Pheasantry,
Mayerstown, Pennsylvania.
It has become quite a tradition for all Pheasant amateurs and
breeders to meet there every autumn, and a large crowd always turns
up at the reception. Mr. Lehman is a very keen amateur, and his
collection of Pheasants, probably the most complete in the east,
includes such unusual birds as the three species of Crested Firebacks,
Gray and Germain's Peacock-Pheasants, Imperials, Bel's, and Mikado
Pheasants. He also owns the three species of Eared Pheasants and he
has reared in 1949 seven most interesting hybrids, three-quarters
White, one-quarter Blue, which in shape look very much like the
White, having a flat, thick tail and short ear tufts, only a little greyer
on the back. They were produced by a White female and a Blue
X White hybrid cock reared in California by Mr. R. Gibson in 1948.
As there are only a very few fertile White cocks left in America, and
none in Europe, these hybrids will prove most useful ; they may save
the species ; mated to pure Whites, they will produce undoubtedly
an entirely normal looking offspring. Mr. Lehman, among others,
reared some Mikados and Siamese Firebacks in 1949.
Also in Pennsylvania, Mr. Fred Sturgis keeps a limited number of
Pheasants and Geese, but only the best : Red-breasted, Blue-winged,
and Ashy-headed Geese ; Satyr, Cabot's and Temminck's Tragopans,
Mikado and Elliot's Pheasants, several pairs of each. Mr. Sturgis is
one of the keenest, most kind, and unselfish amateurs I have ever known.
I have kept for the end a remarkable establishment which during
the last few years has become more and more familiar to me : that
of Mr. W. J. Mackensen, at Yardley, Pennsylvania, a few miles from
Trenton, New Jersey, and one hour out of New York. For some fifty
years Mr. Mackensen, alone in this country, has managed to make
a steady living out of his birds, mostly Pheasants, Peafowl, and
waterfowl. This is saying much for his skill and also for his honesty.
Born in Canada of mixed Scottish and German ancestry, his wife is
English, and his son, Richard, who is now finishing a course for a
doctor's degree as a Veterinarian, at Philadelphia, married a French
girl during the war. He now helps his father whenever he is free to
do so, and will eventually take over. He is also an enthusiast of birds,

and my usual companion on bird trips in the east. More than twenty
years ago I went to Yardley to buy Geese, and when I came to live
in New York I got into touch again with Mr. Mackensen. I found
him so utterly conscientious and reliable that I asked him to procure
or to handle all the birds I acquire for Cleres. I take great pleasure
in visiting him and his son often. Although money making is a
necessity at Yardley, the love for birds and the interest in them come
first. There is extensive and well-kept accommodation both for breeding
pairs and for chicks. Rows of well-built Pheasant pens, large houses
and runs for Peafowl, enclosures crossed by fast running streams which
remain open during the coldest spells for Swans, geese, and ducks,
constitute excellent accommodation. The collection is large, and so
is the number of young reared every year. I enjoy the proximity of
Yardley during the part of the year when most of the birds I see are
stuffed specimens, and frequent visits to the Mackensen farm are

It is some time now since I have seen any of your publications as
I particularly asked for them not to be sent out to me here in case
they were lost during the constant packing and moving which is part
and parcel of a forest officer's life.
My main difficulty out here has been lack of reference books, and
outside of Bannerman there is nothing. Now Bannerman (complete) is
an expensive amusement and the official copies I have access to when
in station is limited to one copy at a time. You will therefore have to
forgive these haphazard notes. From the avicultural point of view
there is practically nothing to say except that the only bird I have
seen regularly kept is the Grey Parrot. In one case what I took to
be the Sierra Leone subspecies--very dark grey in colour. I have
seen several where the red of the tail has suffused the belly and several
of the breast feathers. They are here, in Benin Province, in large
numbers and flight regularly at fixed times during the morning and
evening. One thing I particularly noticed is that they flighted very
late in the evening, sometimes after dark, as their whistling could not
be mistaken. I have seen flocks of about 200 to 300 and flocks of
30 to 50 are very common. Numbers are destroyed for their tail
feathers which fetch about 2 d. each. These are supposed to be
reasonably good " juju

the same purpose. The latter bird is eaten but the Parrot does not
seem to have the same attraction. Birds as a whole, in this part of
Nigeria at any rate, are looked on entirely from the gastronomic point
of view. Size therefore counts, and I am glad to say the smaller forms
enjoy through this a natural protection. The five Hornbills found
here are mercilessly persecuted, both in and out of the breeding season.
Plantain Eaters are also esteemed as a delicacy but are not quite so
common or easy to secure.
In the savannah the common Guinea-fowl is very plentiful owing
to the fact that it is capable of taking precautions. In high forest,
such as we have in Benin, the West African Crested Guinea-fowl is
the only one to be found. It is exceedingly difficult to shoot except
with a * 22 rifle. They have to be stalked and flushed without unduly
alarming them so that part of the covey at least settles in the
surrounding trees. They only call when going to roost, never when
coming down in the morning. Incidentally, Bannermarts illustration
of this species is wrong. The back of the neck and throat are not
feathered for at least i |to 2 inches. The throat is dull carmine and
the skin at the back of the neck a dull sky blue. I hatched out some
of their eggs and found the young easy to rear on ground casava and
pounded maize. They are very pugnacious.
I managed to secure a Finfoot, which thrived quite well but which
I had to release as I was touring too frequently to enable me to feed
it with any regularity.
The commonest birds round my bungalow are Orange-cheeked
Waxbills, in large flocks, also a species of Weaver which I can only
guess to be the Chestnut Weaver. They appear in huge flights about
dusk on their way to roost. There is also another weaver I cannot
identify, very similar to Pyromelana hordeacea sylvatica but without the
red rump, which is black. The red on the front does not extend
below the throat and does not cover the breast. I have seen about
five species of Sunbirds ; one, I think, is the Violet-tailed, another
the Double-collared, and one I am almost certain the Malachite,
though I have only seen this bird previously with Mr. Ezra.
One of the most beautiful birds here is the Broad-billed Roller--
I think it should be called the Mauvy Cinnamon Roller. The small
Malachite Kingfisher is also common and is mainly met with a
considerable distance from water. I have frequently seen them in
high forest, also the Nigerian Blue-breasted Kingfisher. Two or
three times I have seen the Giant Kingfisher, frequently though not
invariably, near water. He is very shy.
Another very interesting bird is the Standard-wing Nightjar, which
appears to have two attendant bats flying somewhat above and behind
the bird in flight. The only one I managed to see on the ground
had these two feathers erect whilst sitting, otherwise the bird was

invisible. It's eyes were also closed. An interesting bird is the Senegal
Crested Hornbill, with its long tail and white crest. They appear to
go about in pairs, unlike the other Hornbills. A very common bird
round here is the Pintail Wydah. I notice he likes the ladies and
always has at least two wives with him. His pugnacity is well known
and I have often seen him drive my chickens off their corn. He also
keeps his stamping ground well clear of intruders and gets plenty of
exercise chasing anything from a Coucal to a Sunbird. I have made
a long list of what I could identify and made water-colour sketches
of a great number which I could not. Unfortunately, it is not possible
for me to keep anything beyond a Sunbird or two so there is nothing
of real interest for the magazine.
I have just added a young male Yellow-bellied Parrot to my
household. He is thriving on Horlicks and powdered guinea corn.

It may be that some items about aviculture in a country about
which very little has been written in the Magazine will be of interest
to some readers.
In happy pre-war days I lived for many years in Denmark, where
at that time aviculture, from 1920 to the war, was progressing year
by year.
The principal interest in Denmark was--and still is--for the
different species of Spermestinae--Weaverfinches--even if the interest
in Parrakeets, especially in the Australians--has many new recruits,
as everywhere, in recent years. Canaries are, of course, kept on a
considerable scale, in recent years mostly red-factor birds by the
more advanced breeders, but the majority being common Canaries of
doubtful pedigree. The interest and quality of English and Continental
breeds has never been great in Denmark. Budgerigars are widely kept,
mostly of an average or poor quality, as is the case almost everywhere
outside English-speaking countries. Some few fanciers are interested
in various softbills, Shamas and Peking Nightingales forming about
90 per cent of the foreign softbills kept. Formerly there was a keen
interest in Continental birds, especially Finches, but also to some
extent in softbills. The bird protection laws, which are not so favour-
able for birdkeepers as those in England, have practically stopped this
branch of aviculture.
There is one important society in Copenhagen with about 400
members, with local societies in some towns. There is also a specialist

<bodyText confidence="0.997330911111111" page_id="56287813"  page_num="69" year="" vol="">
club for Budgerigars and one for Canaries. The big society--" The
Society of Birdfriends "--was founded in 1922 and is still flourishing.
A monthly paper is published and shows are held occasionally at very
irregular intervals. The Danes are not so " show-minded " as their
I English confreres ! The Budgerigar Club was founded 1930 and is
: still working ; the membership, however, is small, about fifty I believe,
j For some reason the numerous Canary clubs founded during the last
two decades have never been very long-lived, from lack of knowledge,
I fear. The shows are arranged on quite a different system to those in
England. Except for Budgerigars and Canaries, standardized show-
cages are not much used, the birds usually being shown in their
ordinary stock or breeding cages, which are equipped in such a way
as to show the tyro how the birds should be correctly kept. In judging
the cages their practical equipment is also considered. As almost
everywhere on the Continent a point-scale is used, the birds getting the
highest points getting the highest awards. Having judged by this
system very many times I am fully aware of its drawbacks. On the
other hand, there is no risk that an exhibit which is not qualified
getting an award only because there is no competition in a class.
In recent years the point-scales are used more as a guide for judges
and exhibitors, and the points are not counted up, but a short criticism
is written on each cage.
As to the manner in which the birds are kept, this differs a lot from
that--I understand--most popular in England. Outdoor aviaries are
not nearly as much used, owing to the climatic conditions not being
so favourable, and that most fanciers, usually people of small means,
live in flats. Most birds are kept in cages in living-rooms, which may
be one of the reasons why even small seed-eating species are in the
majority. Irrespective of this the birds are usually in good condition
and the breeding results are very good, a fact which I had opportunity
to mention last autumn when officiating as a judge. Fanciers who can
afford it keep the birds in a special room in the dwelling-house, special
outdoor birdrooms as in England being practically unknown. The
birdrooms are either divided into an indoor flight or equipped with
cages. Open all-wire cages are mostly used, even if box cages are
more in use now than before. Gages 24 inches by 30 inches long are
perhaps most common.
The feeding is practically the same as in England, the use of sprouted
seeds is rather general with more experienced fanciers.
As to breeding, the best results are obtained in roomy indoor flights,
especially when only a few pairs of birds which agree well together are
kept. I cannot see any difference in stamina between indoor- and
outdoor-bred birds as I have often read in English books and papers.
This, of course, applies to small Finches, and as to Parrakeets and
other Parrots I am also a strong believer in outdoor aviaries, and so

are most Danish breeders. In spite of this even smaller Parrakeets
and Lovebirds are bred in indoor flights. Even in cages many good
results have been obtained. There are in Denmark very many good
breeding strains of Bengalese, and especially eggs of Australian
Finches are on a large scale put under them. Personally, I only use
this as a precuation with birds which do not feed themselves, or in
exceptional cases for very rare species in order to secure some more
specimens before I let the birds try themselves. Generally, I am
against this method, especially if it is done systematically, as many
Danish breeders do. The fact remains, however, that had not Bengalese
been used so extensively, the comparatively numerous strains of
Three-coloured and Red-headed Parrotfinch, Common, Long-tailed,
and Masked Grassfinch, Ruficauda, Bicheno's, Diamond Sparrow,
and Cherryfinch, and to a certain degree Gouldian, would have
been extinct to-day. Most of the African and Asiatic species died out
during the war, but there have been, and still are, numerous importa-
tions, so there is no shortage of these birds now. The rarer species
from South Africa and imported specimens of the Australian species
are still lacking. Fresh blood will soon be very urgent for the
Australians. I do not think that a single one has been imported for
the last ten years.
As to Lovebirds, Peach-faced, Fischer's, and Masked are quite
numerous, all the others being extinct. Cockatiels and Redrumps are
the most common Parrakeets, but Bourke's, Red, Golden-mantled, and
Meally Rosellas are also kept. Also a few other species, but sparingly.
There are some very clever fanciers on foreigners, and several first
breedings have been achieved. At the moment I can only remember
the Crimson-faced Waxbill (Pytilia afra ) and Black Borneo Mannikin
(Uroloncha fuscans ), but there are certainly more. One of my friends,
for many years President of the Cagebird Society, was in pre-war times
one of the very few specialists in Sporophila , and had very fine breeding
results with many species, as far as I know first breeding records with
two or three species. His strain died out during the war, and very
few have been imported in the later years. At the moment very many
fanciers concentrate on Parrakeets, but the Parrot ban makes it very
difficult to get new blood for the existing specimens and for obtaining
new species.
The bird house at the Copenhagen Zoo is one of the best I have
ever seen and contains a wonderful collection. As far as I remember
a Colibri --the last of a pre-war consignment--lived for eight years
(I believe a record) ; in every case showing that the management is
in very able hands ; this is certainly true, the Director, Mr. A.
Reventlow, being one of the most experienced aviculturists and an old
member of the Avicultural Society.

Breeding results during 1932 were very satisfactory, our wonderful
old pair of Brown's Parrakeets rearing eight young in two nests of five
and three.
A young hen Barraband, which had been bred at the farm and was
mated to an imported cock, reared a fine brood of five, and her
parents reared four. The cock of this older pair was unfortunately
far more beautiful in appearance than character, for he gradually
developed the murderous habit of slaughtering his sons the moment
they left the nest, though he continued to feed and care for his
daughters. The only extenuating circumstance that can be pleaded
on his behalf is that each succeeding year, for some reason, his sons
did tend to leave the nest showing much more colour than is usual
in young cock Barrabands, one in each brood being generally brighter
than the rest, and appearing in almost fully adult colours. Possibly
this caused the old cock to treat his male offspring as rivals rather than
sons. In any case, it became necessary to have a small aviary erected
at the end of the breeding aviary and to catch him up and put him
in this the moment the first young one left the nest, and I can still
recall his murderous look of baffled fury at being able to see his sons
but unable to scalp them !
It has always interested me that as this pair of Barrabands got
older their young showed this tendency to leave the nest more and
more brightly coloured each year, because it would almost seem as
if it might have some bearing on the fact that the brilliance of the
colours of adult birds--or at any rate Parrakeets--tend to be enhanced
as the bird grows older.
Incidentally, Barrabands are among the most amiable of the larger
Parrakeets, and I have little doubt that, given plenty of nest-boxes
and a large enough aviary, several breeding pairs could safely be kept
together.
An imported hen Manycolour mated to a cock of our own breeding
reared an excellent brood of five, but the feet of the hen of an imported
pair suddenly became completely paralysed just as she had finished
laying her clutch of five eggs. These were put under a mateless hen
Stanley who was incubating infertile eggs, but though she hatched
them she failed to rear them. Meanwhile, the hen Manycolour
gradually recovered complete use of her feet.
Our, by now, very old original pair reared but one young one, and
this was their swan song in the way of breeding, though they both

remained until the end of their lives as honoured old age pensioners
on the farm.
Of Grass Parrakeets, broods of Bourke's, Elegants, and Turquoisines
were reared.
I noted that a hen Turquoisine mated to one of our male Blue-wing
X Turquoisine hybrids laid and incubated a clutch of infertile eggs
and was eventually given some Turquoisine's eggs, which were duly
hatched and reared.
A cock Bourke's which had been graciously lent to us for breeding
purposes by H.M. King George V, had to be mated at first to a hen
Turquoisine, no spare hen Bourke's being then available. That their
first clutch of eggs was unfertile was hardly surprising as the cock
Bourke's had started to moult. However, when the hen Turquoisine
eventually laid again the Bourke's had completed his moult and was
in breeding condition, and extremely attentive to his wife, but
unfortunately the latter died on the nest after laying her second egg,
so what these very interesting hybrids would have looked like remains
unknown.
His Majesty's Bourke's was afterwards mated to a hen Bourke's of
our own breeding.
Swainsons and Red-collared Lorikeets went on propagating their
kind very slowly but surely, as is their way, usually rearing one young
one from every clutch of two eggs, and I noted that one pair of
Swainsons had two young ones fledged out of doors on Christmas
Day !
All the Parrakeets, of course, invariably have their nest-boxes taken
down in the autumn, but if this had been done with the Lorikeets,
not only would it probably have been necessary to have caged them
in a warm room for the winter (in an outdoor aviary they always
roost in the nest-box) but as there are only two eggs in each clutch,
and as the young spend such a very long time in the nest, each pair
would not have had time to produce more than two or at most three
youngsters per season, and so from the farm standpoint Lorikeets
would hardly have been worth keeping. One would certainly have
missed them, however, for I have always thought their rather dirty
messy habits and frightful ear-splitting cries are more than compensated
for by their droll ways and playfulness, and the incomparably rich
lustre and brilliance of their plumage. All our Lorikeets were fed on
Allinson's Feed, well sweetened bread and milk, and a desert apple
a day, and required no extras when rearing young. Some would eat
a little seed, but much preferred slops.
Owing to lack of aviary space we had previously parted with all
our Lovebirds with the exception of Peach-faced, which had a very
satisfactory breeding season.

Parrots was equally successful with Peach-faced provided the birds
were fully adult.
As we have no trees at the farm from which the bark peels easily,
such as lime or willow, we used to make periodic expeditions to my
mother's house a few miles away, in the garden of which there grew
a belt of very large old lime trees. From these we used to cut the
suckers which grew up round the base of the trunks and return with
a carload of them.
The provision of really large nest-boxes and suitable nesting material
in the form of plenty of lime or willow twigs from which the birds can
peel off strips of fresh moist bark is essential, and is really the secret of
successfully breeding Peach-faced Lovebirds, which, it should be
remembered, continually add to their nest even while incubating their
eggs. This habit is observable in all the Lovebird family, so all need
to be given a large nest-box, but the other members of the family are
usually less fastidious as to nesting material and will use anything that
happens to come their way, such as small twigs, rootlets, bits
of hay and straw, and particularly old damp empty millet sprays,
which latter one always seemed to find incorporated into every
nest.
Generally speaking, we found that while most of the Lovebirds
carried their nesting material in their beaks, it was really only Peach-
faced that had the curious habit of carrying into the nest strips of
bark inserted among and held between the feathers of the rump,
though I have an idea that this method of transporting nesting material
is also practised by the Madagascar Lovebird, but am not certain as
we never kept breeding pairs of these. Incidentally, this was one of
those birds which was widely kept before the 1914-18 war, and whose
popularity subsequently waned so that one hardly ever encountered
them in later years. No doubt this was largely due to the discovery,
between the wars, of other and much more brightly coloured members
of the family, but I always thought their chaste combination of grey
and various shades of green had an attraction of its own, and that
their almost total disappearance from aviaries in this country was to
be regretted.
Among the Finches, several hundred young Zebras were again
reared, and taken by and large it was a pretty good season.
The summer was a very hot one, and looking back it does seem to
me that--even so comparatively short a while ago as 1932--we still
did have definite " seasons " in this country, and though we
undoubtedly had our unwelcome Buchan cold spells, I cannot ever
remember spending most of the summer evenings crouching miserably
over a fire, and then coming out of a sort of summer hibernation to
bask frandcally in the ever declining rays of a futile and quite useless
" Indian summer " sun in October and November, long after the

breeding season was over and when many of the trees were already
leafless.
The hot summer seemed admirably to suit our Ruficaudas, so much
so that all were double-brooded, and we ended the season with
forty-three young ones from five pairs.
Long-tailed Grass Finches were less successful, but this, I think,
was because we decided to try them in aviaries of a new type without
enclosed shelters, and, being inquisitive birds, they were inclined to
come off their nests whenever anyone passed their aviary. Quite a fair
number of young were finally reared, but undoubtedly our best
breeding results with Longtails were obtained where the shelter was
entirely enclosed, with only a small entrance hole to the flight.
Gouldians started as usual late, but in the end did very well indeed,
and my partner also succeeded in breeding a number of young Masked,
Bicheno's and Cherry Finches. Now, while the large number of
Ruficaudas reared was, among the Finches, undoubtedly the most
spectacular success of the season, I think the most difficult achievement
was the successful rearing of young by several pairs of Cherry Finches,
for not only are they by no means free breeders, but adult birds of
this species are difficult subjects at the best of times, having a dis-
concerting and unaccountable tendency to die suddenly when
apparently in absolutely show condition.
I also noted that we bred a Zebra Finch X Long-tailed Grass Finch
hybrid which was rather like a young Longtail, but with a smaller
bib, and with the Zebra Finch penny trumpet voice.
It was during this summer that we tried various Waxbills--Fire
Finches, Cordon Bleus, Orange-cheeks, and Orange-breasts--at
liberty.
All stayed well except the Orange-breasts, which apparently strayed
at once. Fire Finches--those most admirable of liberty Waxbills--
bred successfully in the garden, just as they had thirteen years previously
at my old home, and concerning which, I remember, I wrote a letter
to the Avicultural Magazine at the time. Incidentally, liberty
Waxbills seem to have a perfect passion for pea sticks, and I recorded
in my letter how the first Fire Finches I ever bred at liberty nested-
in spite of having every bush in a large garden to choose from--in a
bundle of peasticks which had been laid in a wheelbarrow in a lean-to
against the potting shed ! And we found, at any rate, some of the
nests of those that bred at the farm among the peasticks when we
were picking sweet peas. Incidentally, most Waxbills and small
Finches that dislike a closed-in nest-box seem to favour a bundle of
twigs nailed against their shelter wall under overhead cover as a
nesting site.
I might add here that one of the best stayers among the Finches
proper is the attractive little Cuban Finch, and if they are ever

imported again in any numbers I can imagine no more suitable
subjects than these and Fire Finches for anyone desiring to attempt
liberty birds in, say, a small suburban garden. I once let some Fire
Finches straight out of their travelling box, and they at once joined
those already at liberty in the garden, and not one of them strayed !
I remember, too, that on one occasion the door of one of our terrace
aviaries containing a large flock of Cuban Finches was inadvertently
left open, and all escaped. A pot of seed was at once placed just
inside the door of the flight and, though they remained at liberty for
several hours, they never showed the slightest desire to stray more
than a few yards from their aviary, and by evening all were back
and roosting in the shelter. I remember wishing at the time that
some of the quite numerous body of people who (usually themselves
possessing neither avicultural nor ornithological knowledge of any
kind) nevertheless maintain that all birds in confinement--even in
aviaries--are utterly miserable, could have witnessed this incident!
Apropos of this, I shall never forget a certain good lady of this ilk,
who asked to visit the farm quite obviously hoping to find lots of her
little " Feathered Friends 55 (as she called all birds) beating their tiny
hearts out against the prison bars of their minute cages, and her look
of baffled irritation when she was confronted with ranges of aviaries,
each containing a single pair of obviously extremely healthy and
contented birds, most of which had either young ones in the nest or

During 1932 there were the following notable additions to our
breeding stock : Parrakeets : Yellow-rumped, King, Norfolk Island.
Also Red-headed Parrot Finches, Cuban Finches, Green Avadavats
and Pin-tailed Nonpareils, and Black-cheeked Lovebirds.

(29) Bourke Grass Parrakeet (. Neophema bourki)
Synonyms. --Pink-bellied Parrakeet, Blue-vented Parrakeet, Night
Parrot (in error).
Distribution. --A bird of the interior of the continent, ranging from
the interior of mid-Western Australia, across Central Australia, into
the far western portions of Queensland and New South Wales, and
possibly the north-western corner of Victoria. In South Australia it
is found only in the northern parts of the state.
Description. ---The largest of the Grass Parrakeets but, even so, an
appreciably smaller bird than the Red-rump. The adult male has the
upper parts mainly of a brownish hue, the wing-coverts showing light
buff edgings. The abdomen is pink and the same colour margins the
brownish feathers of the chest and face. The wing margins are violet
and the under tail-coverts and sides of the rump are pale blue, and
there is a broad frontal band of the same colour extending back behind
the eyes. The adult female is almost always smaller than the male
and lacks the blue frontal band ; consequently the whitish tinge
around the face is more apparent. Furthermore, the breast feathers
have narrower margins of pink, resulting in a somewhat scaly appear-
ance. Immatures resemble the female, but exhibit less pink on the
abdomen ; the sexes can usually be determined by the larger, flatter
heads of the males, and the very restricted area of pink on the females.
Adult plumage is acquired at the first moult of body feathers, which
usually occurs at about three or four months after the young birds
have left the nest.
Variations. --No valid subspecies have been shown to occur. I have
seen a few examples of a very attractive pale (cinnamon or fawn)
mutation, but this variety has not yet been established in captivity.
Coloured Plates. --Goodchild's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 432) is
the best that I am aware of as regards accuracy of colour, although it
gives the birds rather too slim an appearance. The plate in Greene
(vol. i, p. 107) is poor, the bird having a quite unnatural shape and
the colouring also being bad. Cayley's plate of a male in The Emu
(vol. 27, pi. 12), is just a little too vivid in colour, though otherwise
good.
Field Notes. --Few have seen this species in its natural state on
account of the remote districts that it inhabits. Most observers have
commented on its unusual habit of watering before dawn and after
dusk, and also on the peculiar whistling noise made by the wings in
flight.

Aviary Notes .--A very popular aviary bird, and one which has
fortunately bred so freely in captivity in the last twenty years or so that
it can be regarded as domesticated in Australia.
Although I have now had Bourkes for a good many years, they have
not proved quite as reliable breeders in my hands as they have with
many other aviculturists, as the following account of my experiences will
show. My first pair were obtained late in 1935, and the following
season they had two nests, rearing five young in October and two
more, as well as two Splendids, in January. In 1937 three young were
hatched from a clutch of five laid late in September, but two of these
died when half-grown, and the sole survivor left the nest late in
November. The hen then proceeded to lay ten eggs without making
any attempt to incubate them, and when these were removed a
further five eggs were laid and incubated. Only one of this clutch
proved fertile, and the young bird was reared, leaving the nest in
mid-February. However, 1938 was another good season, five young
being reared in October and a further four in December.
Prior to the 1939 breeding season the old hen was mated to one of
her two-year-old sons. She laid a clutch of seven in mid-September,
all of which proved fertile and hatched, and although one died quite
soon the remaining six were reared, leaving the nest in October and
early in November. The hen thereupon resorted to her bad habits
of 1937, and laid eleven eggs without incubating. After these were
removed she laid a further nine, and although five of these were
fertile only two hatched, and these died in mid-January, when about
two weeks old. For the next four seasons, during my absence on
service, the same pair of birds invariably had two nests each year,
but never succeeded in rearing more than three young in any one
nest, and frequently only managed two. In 1944 an early clutch
of seven eggs was laid in August, but only one of these was fertile, and
the young bird died soon after hatching. Of a second clutch of seven
again only one was hatched, and this bird survived but a fortnight.
At this stage, owing to urgent need for accommodation, the Bourkes
were put in an aviary with a pair of Barrabands, whose large log they
promptly appropriated. They laid five eggs, hatched four, two of
which died when nearly fledged, and the two survivors left the nest
in mid-January.
After a good start in 1945, four young being reared from the first
clutch of five eggs laid late in August, the hen had one of her old
lapses, and laid no less than fourteen eggs ! A third clutch of four
was laid in mid-December, but only one was fertile ; however, the
young bird was duly reared. In 1946 four were hatched from the
first clutch of six, but all died quite soon. Of the second clutch of six
five were fertile, and four hatched and were reared almost to the point
of leaving the nest. At this stage the parents unaccountably ceased

feeding, and although three young birds left the nest only one managed
to survive and the fourth was found dead in the nest. Out of a third
clutch of eight only three were fertile, and these young birds were
deserted when a week old.
1947 and 1948 were blank years as far as the breeding of this species
was concerned, although one bird was reared by foster-parents
(Turquoisines) in the latter year. For the breeding season just
concluded one pair of birds hatched all of the first clutch of five
eggs, and reared four of them in mid-November. A second clutch of
five were all hatched, but were deserted early in January. A second
hen had two clutches of five infertile eggs and then, when given a new
mate, laid and hatched all of a further clutch of five and succeeded
in rearing three of them late in December.
Although generally included in the same genus with the other Grass
Parrakeets, there is little doubt that this species belongs to a genus of
its own. Its peculiar habits, already referred to in Field Notes , are very
apparent in captivity, the species being always the last of the collec-
tion to settle down for the night. The unusual warbling call-notes
particularly of the male are also very distinctive, and the colouring is,
of course, very different from that of the other Grass Parrakeets.
The medal of the A.S.S.A. was awarded to Mr. S. Harvey in 1930
for the breeding of this species, and the same success gained a silver
medal for the outstanding breeding of the year.
(30) Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet (,Neophema chrysostomo)
Synonyms. --Blue-banded Parrakeet.
Distribution .---Probably commonest in Tasmania, but also very
plentiful in the coastal parts of Victoria and south-eastern South
Australia. Rarely found in other parts of South Australia, but has
been recorded from both Eyre's and Yorke Peninsulas. The R.A.O.U.
Checklist includes New South Wales in its range, but this is almost
certainly incorrect.
Description .--The adult male is of an olive-green colour on the head,
mantle, rump, and chest, whilst the abdomen, subcaudals and face
are bright yellow, and there is a broad wing edging of bright blue.
The frontal band is dark blue, with a very faint light blue line im-
mediately behind it. Some males exhibit a large, rather irregular
area of an orange shade in the centre of the abdomen, and the top of
the head is usually of a more golden-olive shade than the rest of the
body colouring. The adult female is of a slightly duller shade of olive,
and the yellow areas on the face and abdomen are not as bright as
they are in the male. In addition the blue area on the wing is not
as vivid, being slightly suffused with green, and the frontal band
is narrower and less obvious and lacks the faint pale blue line.

<bodyText confidence="0.991119244444445" page_id="56287825"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
Immatures are duller in all respects than the adult female, the blue
on the wing being rather slaty in shade, and the frontal band is absent.
Adult plumage is not acquired until the September or October after
they leave the nest ; that is, when they are about eight or nine months
old. Until then I doubt whether they can be sexed with any certainty.
Variations .--The Tasmanian and mainland birds have been
separated subspecifically, a decision which appears absurd in the
light of their alleged migration. However, recent examination of a
consignment of Tasmanian birds, most of which were not in adult
plumage, gave one the impression that the blue area on the wing
might be darker than that exhibited by birds from the south-west of
Victoria.
Coloured Plates .--Roland Green's figure of a male in Mathews
(vol. vi, p. 438, lower figure) is good, although the green colouring
is, perhaps, a little too bright. Cayley's plate in The Emu (vol. 27,
pi. 1) is a good representation of a male ; the same artist's plate
in Avicultural Magazine, February, 1932, is rightly criticized by
Tavistock in the next issue. The upper figure is obviously meant
to portray a cock Blue-wing, but the green is much too bright ; the
lower figure is avery good representation of a cock Orange-bellied !
Field Notes .--I observed this species in the field for the first time
when in the Portland district of south-western Victoria recently.
It was a very common bird there, being seen in pairs or small flocks,
many of which consisted of immature birds. Its habits and call notes
appear to be identical with those of the Elegant, which I have observed
on numerous occasions. The vexed question regarding the alleged
migration of this bird to and from Tasmania appears to be unsolved ;
several observers have informed me that the bird is in Victoria all the
year round, but this does not say that some birds may not cross Bass
Strait.
Aviary Notes .--Although moderately freely imported from Tasmania
in pre-war years, this species became quite rare in South Australian
collections during the war, and it is only recently that a number of
birds have been received, both from Victoria and from Tasmania.
This bird has not proved a free breeder in the hands of local avi-
culturists, and I have been singularly unsuccessful with the species,
as the following account will show. In 1937 the hen of the pair in
my possession at that time laid four eggs towards the end of November
and proceeded to incubate, but was found dead in the nesting log
some three weeks later. The following season a new hen, mated to
the same cock, had a clutch of infertile eggs, and in 1939 the same
pair went to nest early in December, a clutch of six being laid. Five
of these eggs proved fertile and hatched in due course, but two young
birds died within the first few days, and a further two when half-
grown ; the sole survivor, a male, left the nest late in January, and

although possessed of what Budgerigar breeders call an undershot
beak, was otherwise a good specimen. The old cock died shortly
after this, and for the next four seasons the old hen, although provided
with a new mate, did not even lay. In 1944, however, she relented,
and laid four eggs in December, but these soon disappeared. A second
pair obtained prior to this season laid three eggs in the middle of
November, and later added two mis-shapen ones to the clutch, all of
which proved clear, and a second attempt in January by this pair
resulted in three more peculiarly shaped eggs. The following season
this latter pair failed even to lay, although the hen spent a lot of time
in the nest. The two following seasons were also blanks, and in 1948
I determined to try and break the hoo-doo with four pairs of young
birds which moulted into adult plumage just prior to the breeding-
season. Of these, the first pair laid three eggs about the middle of
November, all of which proved fertile, and two of which had hatched
by 2nd December ; two days later both young birds were dead, and
the third egg was found to contain a fully developed chick. The
second pair laid a clutch of four eggs at the same time as the first
pair, and four young were seen early in December, but unfortunately
the log fell off its supporting nail a few days later, with the resultant
death of all the young birds. A third pair had three infertile eggs,
and the fourth pair did not lay. The recent season was no more
successful, two pairs being tried. One pair laid five eggs early in
November, all of which were fertile, and had hatched by the end of
the same month ; however, two of these died quite soon, and all had
succumbed by the middle of December. The second pair, the hen of
which was a young bird of the previous season, started to lay late in
October, and continued to do so intermittently until early in Decem-
ber, sixteen eggs being laid in all ! Several of these were obviously
fertile, but at no time was incubation sufficiently continuous for the
embryos to develop very far.
The medal of the A.S.S.A. for the first breeding of this species was
awarded in 1935 to Mr. S. Harvey ; since then only a few other
spasmodic successes have been recorded in this state. I feel that one
reason why this species has not become established as an aviary
breeder here is on account of its late breeding season, with the con-
sequent liability of spells of hotter weather being encountered than
would be the case in its more southerly habitat.

Synonym .--Grass Parrakeet.
Distribution .--Widely distributed in South Australia, where it
extends as far north at least as Beltana in the Flinders Range, and also

in the south-west of Western Australia. It also occurs in north-
western Victoria, and has been reported from various parts of New
South Wales ; Queensland records are probably doubtful in their
authenticity.
Description .--The colouring of the head, back, rump, and breast
of the adult male is a rich golden olive, the face, abdomen, and sub-
caudals are yellow, and there is often a small orange patch in the
centre of the abdomen. The frontal band is double, consisting of a
broad, dark blue line in front of a slightly narrower light blue one ;
similarly, the narrow wing patch consists of two bands of the same
two shades of blue. The adult female is of an appreciably duller shade
of olive which lacks the golden hue, but she does not otherwise differ
materially from the male, except that the small orange abdominal
spot is never seen. Immatures are not very much duller than adult
females in the general body colouring, but the frontal band is either
absent or very faint. I do not think they can be sexed with any
certainty until they attain adult plumage, with the first moult of body
feathers, which occurs when they are only about three months old
and is rapidly completed.
Variations .--The Western Australian birds have been separated
subspecifically, but from an examination of a number of skins I am
very doubtful whether any appreciable difference exists between the
western and eastern birds.
Coloured Plates .--Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 447),
although allegedly portraying males of the eastern and western races,
serves as an excellent representation of an adult pair. The plate in
Greene (vol. i, p. 83), is not good, the shape of the bird being quite
unnatural, and the shade of green being deceptive. Cayley's plate in
The Emu (vol. 27, pi. 22) is a little too dull for the adult male it is
intended to portray.
Field Notes .--This bird is very common in many parts of South
Australia, and I have observed it on many occasions. It can almost
always be seen near Victor Harbour, either in pairs or in fairly large
flocks, according to the season of the year. When flushed from the
ground this species often rises rapidly to a considerable height, and
is not easily followed up for further observation. In Western Australia
in 1948 I saw a single pair of these birds in the vicinity of Williams.
Aviary Notes .--As a schoolboy during World War I, I possessed two
successive pairs of this species at a time when they were extremely
rare in captivity ; in fact, I know of no others having been kept
about that time. Neither pair showed any inclination to go to nest,
although they survived for considerable periods in a mixed collection.
In the last twenty years or so large numbers of Elegants have been
trapped in this state, and the species has become very common in
captivity and has bred to the extent that it may be regarded as

domesticated. The A.S.S.A. medal for the first breeding was awarded
to Mr. S. Harvey in 1930.
My own breeding experiences of this species have all been achieved
with two individuals of each sex. An adult pair obtained in 1935
seemed likely to nest in a mixed collection, until murdered by a pair
of Blue Bonnets. In 1936 a new pair was obtained, but they did not
go to nest that season ; in 1937 a clutch of four eggs was laid in
September and October, but they proved clear. The next season a
clutch of four was laid in mid-September, and three young hatched
and were reared, all of them leaving the nest about the middle of
November, plucked to a varying degree, presumably by their mother.
In the 1939 breeding season it soon became obvious that a young hen
that had been left in the aviary had mated with her father and, in view
of the plucking episode of the previous season, she was not discouraged.
She laid a clutch of eggs in August, but these soon disappeared, and
early in September she laid a further clutch of five, four of which
hatched by the end of the month, but only lived for a few days. The
old hen was thereupon restored to her former mate, and she laid a
clutch of four in mid-October, three of which were fertile and were
hatched and reared to leave the nest in a shockingly plucked condition
in December ; however, like their predecessors and many successors,
they soon recovered from their ordeal and became presentable-
looking specimens.
During the next three seasons a few young Elegants were reared,
but the pair were mostly used to hatch and rear Turquoisines, which
they invariably plucked. In 1943 the old hen was replaced by one of
her daughters bred the previous season ; this bird failed to lay that
year, but in the following year commenced a very successful breeding
career. Her first clutch, laid late in August, consisted of five infertile
eggs, but the second clutch, produced early in October, consisted of
four eggs, all of which were hatched and reared, the first three leaving
the nest early in December, and the fourth not for a further fortnight !
A third clutch, commenced about the time the first three young left
the nest, proved all to be clear. In 1945 three were reared from the
first clutch of four laid late in August ; the second clutch, laid late
in October, was replaced by some Hooded eggs, which had been
deserted, without result, and the third clutch of four was infertile.
In 1946 the old male, who had been in my possession for ten years,
died in August just as the hen commenced to lay, and her eggs were all
clear. A new cock was obtained almost immediately, and five were
reared from the second clutch, which was laid early in October ;
a third clutch laid in December were clear. This pair has carried on
quite successfully since then, rearing three out of four, and five out of
five in 1947 ; three out of three and two out of three in 1948, and four
out of four and two out of three during the recent season.

The display of the Elegant is identical with that of its near allies, and
consists of the cock flying to a perch or to the ground near the hen,
depressing his shoulders so that the blue margins are more clearly
visible and at the same time uttering one of his call notes.
(32) Rock Grass Parrakeet ( Neophema petrophila)
Synonym. --Rock Parrot.
Distribution. --The coastline of Western Australia and South
Australia, extending as far north as Shark Bay in the former state, and
as far east as the vicinity of Robe in the latter.
Description. --The dullest and, at the same time, the bulkiest member
of the genus. The adult male is of a uniform brownish-olive colour on
the head, back, rump, and breast, whilst the abdomen and under tail-
coverts are dull yellow. The frontal band is dark blue, with a very
inconspicuous line of pale blue behind it, and the very narrow wing
edging is also dark blue merging into a paler blue ; the face is dull
blue. Adult females are not appreciably duller than their mates, and
the species is consequently a particularly difficult one to sex, the only
reliable guide being a somewhat wider frontal band in most males.
Immatures are only slightly duller than adults, but the frontal band
is lacking and the face is olive, not blue. Like Elegants, they attain
their adult plumage rapidly by a moult which occurs when they have
been about three months out of the nest. Occasionally adults of both
sexes show the yellow of the abdomen replaced by a large patch of
dull orange.
Variations. --The western and eastern birds have been separated
subspecifically, but quite unreasonably, one would think, as the range
is continuous and no appreciable difference exists between the
extremes.
Coloured Plates. --This species has seldom been portrayed. Roland
Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 451) is good as regards colouring,
but fails to convey the bird's size and plumpness. Cayley's plate in
The Emu (vol. 27, pi. 22) is a very good representation of a male.
Field Notes. --This species is very common in the vicinity of Port
Lincoln, South Australia, and was nesting there on the small islands
called The Brothers in January, 1948. It is quite often to be seen on
the eastern shores of St. Vincent's Gulf, and is not uncommonly seen
near the Outer Harbour, less than fifteen miles from Adelaide.
Aviary Notes. --This species has never been very plentiful in captivity,
partly because it is seldom trapped, and also because it is the least
colourful member of the group, and has the reputation of being
relatively short-lived and difficult to breed. Always a plump bird,
it tends to become extremely fat and sluggish in captivity, and many
birds seem to die suddenly when apparently in good health. It was

first bred in South Australia by Mr. G. Pearce, of Port Augusta, in
1936, a feat which gained the A.S.S.A. medal and also the silver
medal for the outstanding breeding success of the season. Mr. W. K.
Penney, of Plympton, also bred the species a little later. On both
these occasions the birds nested amongst stones or rocks, but most sub-
sequent successes have been achieved in the ordinary type of log nests.
My personal experiences with this species have been disappointing,
as the following account relates. I obtained my first pair late in 1935,
and for the next five seasons they gave no indication of wanting to go
to nest, although the cock was occasionally observed feeding the hen
during the spring. Then in 1941 they surprisingly went to nest in
a log, laying a clutch of three eggs early in October. Two eggs hatched,
and the young birds were reared, leaving the nest early in December.
Prior to the 1942 breeding season both parents and one of the young
birds died, and though a mate was obtained for the surviving young
hen, no inclination to breed was apparent either that season or the
following one. However, in both 1944 and 1945 considerable interest
was evinced without eggs actually being laid. Before the 1946 season
I had acquired a further hen, and she occupied the same aviary as
the mated pair. She came into breeding condition late in October,
and frequently implored the cock to feed her, without result ; she then
laid four eggs in mid-November, which, as expected, were infertile.
Just about this time I was lucky enough to secure a new cock, and he
immediately mated with the odd hen, and she laid a further clutch of
three eggs early in December, all of which were fertile. Two young
were hatched and reared, leaving the nest at the end of January and
proving to be both cocks. The following season the cock of this
breeding pair died early in October, and the only other Rock that
I could obtain proved to be another hen. However, the old hen
mated with an odd cock Blue-wing, laid two eggs late in December,
one of which was fertile and was hatched and reared to leave the nest
early in February. The second hen mated up with an odd cock Orange-
bellied, laid three eggs late in December, only one of which was fertile,
and although it hatched in mid-January the youngster unfortunately
only lived a few days. This last-mentioned hen was mated to a new
cock in 1948, and she laid three eggs early in November, but only
hatched one of the two fertile ones, and the chick only survived a fort-
night. Similarly, in 1949, two eggs were fertile out of the clutch of
four laid early in November, both hatched, but one died in a few
days and the other survived nearly a month but failed to leave the
nest.

Victoria would appear to be the mainland strongholds of this species.
It undoubtedly occurs in Tasmania, but is probably rare there. In
South Australia there are a few records from the vicinity of Adelaide.
The inclusion of New South Wales in the range of the species appears
to be based on a record which is now many years old.
Description .--This species is very much the size of the Rock, and
almost as plump. The adult male has the head, back, and rump a
rich grass-green, the breast is a green with a somewhat more yellowish
tinge, and the face has a marked yellow suffusion. The abdomen is
also greenish-yellow, with a large central patch of bright reddish-
orange, and the subcaudals are yellow tinged with green. The frontal
band is of a mid-blue shade, with a less obvious paler blue band
behind it, and the narrow wing edging is of the same two shades of
blue. The adult female is of an appreciably duller shade of green, and
her frontal band is considerably less obvious, and appears to be single.
She exhibits a large orange abdominal patch which is little duller
than that of the male. Immatures are duller than the adult female,
but still of a considerably brighter shade of green than their near
allies ; they show a well-marked dull orange belly patch which is,
however, smaller than that of the adults. My impression is that
they do not attain adult plumage until the late spring, probably eight
to nine months after they leave the nest, and I very much doubt if
they can be sexed until then.
Variations .--There does not appear to be any appreciable difference
between the Tasmanian and mainland birds, although they have been
separated subspecifically.
Coloured Plates .--Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 438,
upper fig.) is very good as regards colouration, but does not accurately
convey the bird's bulky figure. Cayley's plate in The Emu (vol. 27,
pi. 1) is a very good representation and, as previously noted, the lower
figure in his plate in Avicultural Magazine, February, 1932, is
certainly meant to represent this species and not a hen Blue-winged.
The plate in Greene (vol. i, p. 103) is quite inaccurate, both as regards
shape and coloration.
Field Notes .--My sole encounter with this rare species in the field
was a fleeting glimpse in May, 1949, of a single bird near Geelong,
Victoria, a district in which the birds have often been observed in
recent years.
Aviary Notes .--This species is undoubtedly the rarest of the genus,
and is quite unknown to the majority of aviculturists. Very occasion-
ally an odd bird is trapped with a flock of Elegants but, as far as I am
aware, only once has a consignment reached the Adelaide bird
market. That was in the middle of 1940, when a few dozen birds were
obtained from the south-east of South Australia. Most of these were

immature birds, and two of them were obtained on my behalf, but
unfortunately both proved to be cocks, and they only survived until
1943. In November of the following year I obtained two more cocks,
the survivors of three birds which had been in the possession of Mr. S.
Harvey prior to the war. One of these I still have, but the other died
late in 1945. In May, 1946, I obtained the loan of a hen, the sole
survivor of a small batch of the 1940 trapping which had been sent
to a Victorian aviculturist. About Christmas time that year the
hen was seen to be taking an interest in a log, and one day in mid-
January she was noticed to be looking a little off colour, and inspection
of the nest revealed a single egg ; next day the hen was found dead,
and it was obvious that the effort of egg-laying after so long in captivity
had been too much for her. The egg was placed under a sitting Blue-
winged in a friend's aviary, but it was not fertile. The following
season the cock mated with a hen Rock, and she laid three eggs late
in December. Only one of these was fertile, and it hatched in mid-
January, but only survived a few days. I would particularly have
liked to have reared this hybrid, as I have always felt that the Rock
was the closest relative of the Orange-bellied. It was not until
January, 1949, that I was able to obtain another hen of this species,
and about Christmas time she began to take an interest in a log, and
continued to do so for over a month without laying, as far as is known.
Unfortunately, the old cock, who has now been in captivity for over
ten years, has never been observed to feed her and seemed quite
disinterested when she was obviously in breeding condition.
As far as I am aware this species has never been bred in captivity.
During World War II Dr. M. E. Chinner, of Adelaide, had a hen
which laid and incubated a clutch of eggs for at least four successive
seasons, but the eggs were invariably infertile, although two cocks
were tried.
Dr. W. Hamilton, also of Adelaide, has never been without a
number of these birds, which he traps himself, since 1934, but he has
never been able to report a breeding success, although he informs
me that he thinks a young bird was successfully reared in his aviaries
during the war at a time when his birds were, of necessity, receiving
minimal attention and practically no observation. The birds have,
however, laid and hatched young for him, but in the majority of
instances the eggs have been infertile. His experiences with the
species make most interesting reading, and have been recorded in
Avicultural Magazine, 1938, p. 213 ; it is to be hoped that he will
contribute a further article thereto in the light of his more recent
experiences. However, I find myself unable to accept his conclusion
that they breed in late winter in the wild state, in view of the invariable
midsummer nesting in captivity, and I think that their migration
to Tasmania is unproved ; it is more likely that they migrate to the

shores of Port Philip Bay in Victoria when they leave South Australia
in November, and they probably breed somewhere in Victoria.
(34) Turquoise Grass Parrakeet ( Neophema pulchella)
Synonyms. --Red-shouldered Parrakeet, Chestnut-shouldered Parra-
keet, Beautiful Grass Parrakeet (a name which should be reserved for
the Paradise Parrakeet), Turquoisine.
Distribution. --From southern Queensland through New South Wales
into Victoria. The stronghold of this species at the present time is
undoubtedly north-eastern New South Wales, but a few birds can
still be found fairly close to Sydney. It would appear to be extremely
rare in Victoria at the present time, if not extinct.
Description. --The adult male is bright green on the head, back,
and rump, whilst the breast, abdomen, and subcaudals are rich
golden yellow. The forehead and facial mask are a bright turquoise
blue of two shades, as is the broad edging to the wing, and there is a
noticeable band of reddish chestnut on the shoulder. The adult
female differs in that the extent and brilliance of the blue facial mask
is diminished, the breast is green like the upper parts, and the reddish
wing bar is absent, although I have twice seen hens which showed
a slight indication thereof. Immatures leave the nest looking like dull
editions of adult females, but in most cases young males have brighter
and more extensive facial masks and a fairly large proportion of them
show a faint brownish wing bar. Adult plumage is acquired early by
a moult of body feathers which is completed at about the age of
four months.
Variations. --Some adults of both sexes exhibit a large patch of an
orange-red shade on the abdomen ; I consider this to be an individual
variation and not a racial or subspecific difference.
Coloured Plates. --This species has been frequently depicted in colour.
Goodchild's plate of a male in Seth-Smith (p. 223) is very good, as also
is Roland Green's of a pair in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 458). Boosey's
drawing in Tavistock (frontispiece) gives the bird rather a dumpy
figure, and an irregular wing bar, whilst that in Greene (vol. i, p. 77)
is also rather unshapely and of too dull a shade of green. Cayley's
plate in The Emu (vol. 27, pi. 12) is an excellent representation of a
male.
Field Notes. --I have not had the opportunity of observing this species
in its natural state, but as a few birds have recently been located not
far from Sydney I look forward to remedying this omission in the
future.
Aviary Notes. --After having been a well-known aviary bird in the
nineteenth century, this species disappeared from the ken of avicul-
turists both in Australia and abroad, and during the early years of the

present century many ornithologists in Australia believed the species
to be extinct. However, a few reached the hands of experienced
Sydney aviculturists in the early nineteen-twenties, and since that
date the species has steadily increased its numbers in captivity in most
parts of Australia, and can now be considered to be satisfactorily
established in a state of domestication.
My early experiences with the species were most unsatisfactory, two
pairs of trapped birds acquired in 1935 failing to survive for more
than a few months. Then, in August, 1936, I secured a nice pair of
well-acclimatized birds, only to lose the hen egg-bound a few weeks
later. A substitute was obtained, but the cock never became reconciled
to the change, and it was not until late in October, 1937, that I was
able to exchange her for another hen. The cock at once approved of
the newcomer, and she laid a clutch of seven eggs late in November
and early in December, but did not incubate them, a trait in her
character which was destined to prove a great trial in future years.
In 1938 she commenced to lay early in September, and produced
thirteen eggs without becoming broody ; four of these were placed
under a pair of Cockatiels, and were hatched and reared, but the
foster parents would not feed them after they left the nest, and they all
succumbed. A second clutch of nine was laid in November, but
again was not incubated. In 1939 she again started laying in mid-
September, and broke many of the first batch of fourteen eggs, but
behaved better in regard to the second lot of eleven commenced in
November ; once again, however, no incubation ensued. For the next
four years she was rightly regarded as a hopeless proposition ; never-
theless, seven young birds were reared by transferring eggs to a pair
of Elegants whenever opportunity offered.
Prior to the 1944 season a new hen was obtained, and she laid
a clutch of five fertile eggs late in September. All of these hatched
and four were reared, leaving the nest about the middle of November.
A second clutch of four was laid later in the same month, and all were
hatched and reared by mid-January. 1945 was another good season
for this pair, four eggs being laid late in August, and all being hatched
and reared. A second clutch was laid late in October, and although
one of the four died early the other three were reared, in addition
to a young Splendid which had been transferred to the nest.
1946 started poorly in that the hen became eggbound with her fifth
egg in mid-August, and on recovery proceeded to break the clutch.
However, she laid five more eggs early in September ; of these three
were fertile, but only one hatched ; it was successfully reared. A third
clutch of six eggs late in October resulted in five good young being
reared, and two more were obtained from the fourth clutch laid in
mid-December, only three of the six being good. 1947 was a poor
season. The first clutch of six, laid in August, were all clear ; a second

batch of five in mid-September resulted in the three fertile eggs
hatching in early October, and although one died early the other
two, and a Splendid which had been placed in the nest, were reared
early in November. Although five out of the third clutch of six, pro-
duced early in November, were fertile, the only two to hatch died
within a few days.
In 1948 the first two clutches, of four and two respectively, were
clear, and at this stage the old hen was mated with one of her previous
year's progeny, and she laid a third clutch late in October--two out
of the five being fertile. The clear eggs were removed and replaced
by a partly incubated Bourke egg and, in due course, two Turquoisines
and a Bourke were reared. At the same time the old cock was mated
with a newly acquired hen, and she laid a clutch of six fertile eggs in
mid-October, and though the old fellow (who had been over twelve
years in my possession) died soon after they hatched, she carried on
single-handed and succeeded in rearing four very good youngsters.
For the season just past the old hen again started with two infertile
clutches before eventually producing three fertile eggs out of five laid
early in November ; from these, however, three were reared. The
second hen had a very stormy time with a new mate, who knocked her
about very badly at times ; of the first clutch of five eggs, three were
broken, and only one hatched and was reared early in December.
She laid two more eggs in mid-December, and at the time of writing
(end of January) two young birds are more than half-grown. A third
pair laid a clutch of five in mid-October, and hatched four of them,
lost one early on and one later, but reared the other two.
The medal of the A.S.S.A. was awarded to Mr. S. Harvey in 1929
for the first breeding of this species ; the records show that he first bred
them in 1926, prior to the formation of the Society.
( 35 ) Scarlet-chested Grass Parrakeet (,Neophema splendida)
Synonyms .--Splendid Grass Parrakeet, Orange-throated Parrot.
Distribution .--The true range of this bird is very uncertain ; it appears
mainly to inhabit Central Australia and northern South Australia,
with an extension of its range down into Eyre's Peninsula and the west
coast of South Australia. It has also been reported from northern
New South Wales and north-western Victoria ; the last Western
Australian record is over a hundred years ago.
Description .--This and the preceding species are the smallest members
of the genus. The adult male has the nape, back, and rump bright
green, the breast scarlet, and the abdomen and subcaudals bright
yellow. The facial mask is an extensive area of two shades of dark
blue, and the broad wing edging is pale blue. The adult female
differs in that the facial mask is restricted in extent and of a duller

blue, and the breast is green instead of scarlet with, very occasionally,
a few orange feathers on the throat. She shows the broad wing edging
of pale blue, and in this respect differs most markedly from the hen
Turquoise, in whom this area is of a deeper shade of blue ; there is,
in addition, more blue as a rule on the face of the hen Scarlet-chested.
Immatures leave the nest looking like very dull hens and at that stage
they are difficult to sex, although I think young cocks usually have
more blue in the facial region than do young hens. However, in
about two or three months a few red feathers begin to make their
appearance on the chests of the young cocks, and in about six months
young cocks have achieved a fair imitation of the adult plumage, with
considerable restriction in the size of the red area. This does not
develop to its fullest extent until the next moult, usually when the
bird is between fifteen and eighteen months old. Young hens assume
practically full adult plumage at the first moult, which is generally
completed when they are five or six months of age. Very occasionally,
indeed, young males leave the nest showing a few scarlet feathers on
the chest.
Variations .--A fair number of adult males show an extension of the
scarlet patch on to the abdomen, and even as far as the vent, but this
marking is seldom even and usually fades out to an orange colour and
is not, to my mind, at all attractive. Females are not infrequently
seen showing an extensive orange abdominal patch. As in the case
of the Turquoisine, I do not consider the foregoing to be a subspecific
difference.
Coloured Plates. --Goodchild's figure of a male in Seth-Smith (p. 223)
is excellent ; Roland Green's in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 462) is even
better. The pair depicted in Greene (vol. i, p. go) are not of a good
shape, and the scarlet of the chest of the male is of a very washed-out
shade. Cayley's plate of a pair in The Emu (vol. 26, pi. 34) is excellent
of the male, but the female has a rather bulky, foreshortened
appearance.
Field Notes .--As in the case of the Bourke, the interior habitat of this
species has resulted in few people having seen it in a wild state. During
an irruption of the birds into the vicinity of Wynbring, a siding on the
Transcontinental Railway, in 1939, it was stated that they were very
tame and consequently a very large number were trapped.
Aviary Notes .--The reintroduction of this species to aviculture in
1931, and its subsequent breeding in captivity by Mr. S. Harvey, of
Adelaide, forms the subject of an interesting article in Avicultural
Magazine, 1933, pp. 8-12 ; for this success Mr. Harvey was awarded
the A.S.S.A. medal in 1932, and also the silver medal of the Society
for the outstanding breeding achievement of the season. Since that
date the species has been bred extremely freely in Australia generally,
and in South Australia in particular, and is completely domesticated ;

it is all the more tragic, therefore, that the species did not become
firmly established in England before the introduction of the present
apparently unsurmountable difficulties in importation.
My first examples of this species were obtained late in 1935, and the
following season the hen began to lay in mid-October, but broke
several of the early eggs before settling down to incubate ; in all, six
young were hatched in mid-December, but the cock died about this
time and none of them survived long thereafter. Meanwhile two of
the early eggs had been hatched by Bourkes and were successfully
reared by them in January. In 1937 the same hen was mated to the
young cock fostered by the Bourkes the previous season, and she
started laying late in August and continued to do so until October,
breaking most of her eggs soon after producing them. A new hen
was obtained at the end of October, and she laid a clutch of four in
mid-November ; three of these were fertile and were hatched, and
two survived to leave the nest in the middle of January. This hen
died egg-bound in July, 1938, and a new hen proceeded to lay eggs
throughout September without going broody.
Prior to the next season I obtained a new hen, alleged to be a
trapped bird, and mated her with the cock bred in 1937, and this
proved to be a very successful mating. In 1939 the first clutch of
six eggs was laid in mid-September, and all were hatched, and
although three did not survive long the other three left the nest early
in November. A second clutch of four was laid in mid-November,
all hatched and three were reared, leaving the nest early in January.
For the next four seasons the same pair had very good results, having
two nests each season, and rearing eight young in 1940 and in 1941,
seven in 1942, and nine in 1943. In 1944 only one egg was fertile
in the first clutch, but the young bird was successfully reared, and
although all six eggs comprising the second batch were fertile, three
died early and one later on, and only two were reared. The following
season all of the first clutch of four were duly reared, but of the second
lot of the same number, three died early and the survivor was given
to Turquoisines to rear in the hope of a third clutch, which, however,
did not materialize. 1946 saw the end of the breeding career of the
old hen, who by that time had become extremely fat and sluggish.
She hatched five out of her first clutch of six, laid in August, but three
were allowed to die early, and the other two were reared. The
second clutch of five, laid late in October, were all hatched and
promptly allowed to die, and the three hatched out of the third
clutch of five, laid early in December, were similarly treated.
Since that date I have not been particularly successful with
Splendids. Two new pairs were tried in 1947, both hens laying in mid-
September. One pair threw all their eggs out of the nest and the
other hen hatched all of her four eggs just after the cock died ; when

three of these had died, one after another, the survivor was transferred
to a pair of Turquoisines, and was reared by them. For the 1948 season
the first of the above-mentioned pairs was given another chance, but
after they had broken the first lot of eggs the hen was changed. The
replacement succeeded in hatching two out of a clutch of five, only to
lose one early and the other when it was quite large. A second,
entirely new, pair produced a lot of eggs without incubating. For the
season now ending, the first pair failed to rear any of three hatched
in the first nest, got two good young on the wing out of three hatched
in the second, and have two half-grown young in the third. A second
pair of birds, bred in 1948, reared one of the two hatched in the first
nest, but have failed to rear any of three hatched in both second and
third nests.

inception of the Club, and stressed the important part it had played
in revitalizing the Society during the difficult post-war period.
On behalf of Mrs. G. T. Clark, the Chairman exhibited a mounted
specimen of the Queen of Bavaria Conure, bred last year by Mrs. Clark,
and now destined to the British Museum (Natural History). The
Duke of Bedford gave a brief history of this bird, and said the
female parent was one loaned by him to Mrs. Clark. He had made
many attempts to breed this species, and although young ones had
been hatched in his aviaries, they had not been reared.
The Chairman said Peter Scott was too well known to need a
lengthy introduction, and he did not propose to waste time in this
manner. Peter Scott then showed a very interesting series of coloured
films taken last Autumn in Canada and the U.S.A. A good idea was
conveyed of the Delta Waterfowl Research Station at Lake Manitoba,
Canada, and its large collection of Canvas-back and surface-feeding
Ducks. Other films dealt with the extensive collections of Dillon
Ripley and Jack Livermore, in Connecticut. Members were delighted
to see Jean Delacour in several scenes.
The last film consisted of a brief survey of the Severn Wildfowl
Trust collection and the various activities connected with the Trust.
Amongst distinguished visitors we were shown the Duke of Edinburgh
feeding Snow Geese.
There can be little doubt that many in the audience were surprised
to learn a collection of such magnitude existed in England.
Thanking Peter Scott, on behalf of the Club, the Chairman said it
was indeed fortunate for Aviculture there were such enthusiastic and
skilled breeders. He would like to take the opportunity of mentioning
another very successful breeder of Waterfowl, namely Terry Jones,
of Leckford.
The audience showed by its warm applause that it had fully
appreciated Peter Scott's films and commentary.
The next meeting of the Club will be on 10th May, 1950.

I. Baty says " The breeding season resulted in four Elegants, eight
Redrumps, and nine Bourkes
F. H. Rudkin, Sr. : " My son got back with so much to tell of
English Aviculture that it makes me homesick (just a little). The
lovely lutinos he brought back are wonderful. We have just acquired
two Keas."
F. L. Gary, of New Jersey, the newly elected President of the
American Bantam Association, writes that A. F. Sturgis, Harleysville,
Pa., has just imported from Calcutta a pair of Cabot's Tragopans ;
they are the only ones in America. Also that the Philadelphia Zoo has
received a trio of Scintillating Copper Pheasants.
John Yealland writes from Honolulu concerning the Hawaiian
Goose re-stocking project: " We have three pairs here at present, and
one of them is nesting. The female of the second pair was taken, by
some extraordinary chance, alive and uninjured from a hunter, so
could not really be expected to nest this year. The third might still
be too young. However, we hope ! "
C. L. Faudell, now domiciled in Canada : " The disposal of my
birds was almost the only sad part of my venture. Fortunately they
were all taken by Mr. Vane to be well cared for. I was especially
sorry to part with my outstanding pair of Leadbeater's Cockatoos.
I hope they will continue their remarkable breeding success with
Mr. Vane. Since I acquired this pair in 1943, they have bred and
reared fourteen young and, as far as I am aware, thirteen are still
living, and have at least three grandchildren. These must represent
quite a substantial part of the total Leadbeater population in England."
F. S. Scherr, the Parrot Jungle, Miami, Florida, writes : " We
started breeding Macaws ten years ago. One pair, a blue and gold
male and a scarlet female, have bred eighteen babies so far, two per
year. The parents' colours diffused into orange-breasted birds.
Several straight matings have produced another dozen birds. A
mating of a military (green) Macaw with a scarlet female produced
some more hybrids with various mixed colours. Our birds fly about
free, which accounts for their breeding so freely. Birds that are
trained to perform and have their wings clipped do not breed."
A. H. Gardner, Sydney, writes : " Perhaps this information will
be of some help to those members keeping birds which need live food.

to the usual consistency for feeding fowls. Place the box containing
the damp bran in the sun, but out of all wind. The bran thus generates
great heat and cracks appear in the surface. The smell will attract
the small house-fly. After about three days, if the mixture and the
position of the box are right, hundreds of gentles will be obtainable
every day until the bran needs renewing. These gentles are smaller
and cleaner, and the smell is less objectionable than that of the head
of a sheep or meat.
I have a pair of Hooded Parrakeets which have reared over sixty
young to maturity in the last sixteen years, and look as well as any of
their offspring, which, believe me, were well reared."
W. G. Baird, New Zealand, writes : " We are very fortunate herej
being able to get Finches across from Australia by air, the journey only
taking about 6J hours. The Department of Internal Affairs, which
controls the Wild Life section, has been making a check up on native
Parrakeets being kept in captivity. It is an offence for them to be
held, and officers of the Department have been coming round the
aviaries taking particulars of number of birds held, and also size of
aviaries. From what I can gather, we are now going to be issued
with permits to keep native birds in captivity ; at long last the Depart-
ment is taking a sensible view of things. The only way of the public
seeing New Zealand birds is to let aviculturists keep them. Hundreds
of people have asked me what the ' Green Parrakeets 5 are in my
aviaries, and when I tell them that they are natives of New Zealand,
they all say the same, 4 Never knew there were any Parrakeets here.' "
The Avicultural Society prides itself on being international in
character. Reference to the List of Members shows there are in fact
members throughout the world. But many more are wanted. Members
are asked to remember they are members of a Society , and not just
subscribers to a publication ; and as such they are urged to participate
in the activities of the Society.

REVIEW
EDWARD LEAR'S PARROTS. By Brian Reade. Duckworth.

<bodyText confidence="0.996633642857143" page_id="56287842"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
&amp;r. 6 d. net.
I must confess that before reading the handsomely produced Edward
Lear's Parrots , by Brian Reade, I did not realize that Lear the bird
artist and Edward Lear of the immortal nonsense rhymes was one
and the same person, and it is interesting to note that " the Nonsense
idiom began to develop as a means of amusing Lord Derby's grand-
children " during a visit to Knowsley Hall to do illustrations of the
zoological collection there : interesting, too, are the sidelights on that
apparently ruthless individual, John Gould, after whom the Gouldian
Finch is named.
As the birds themselves are only incidentally mentioned in the text,
it is perhaps best that I should concentrate on the accompanying
coloured plates which, though they all have a quaint decorative
" period " charm, cannot, in some cases, be taken seriously as accurate
portrayals of the birds they are supposed to represent.
It seems a pity that the present-day Latin names are not given as
well as the superseded ones, as this would have made it easier to
identify the "Roseate Parrakeet. Palaornis Rosaceus " which--presum-
ably a Barraband--is the merest grotesque caricature of that very
elegant and beautiful bird.
The deliniation of each separate feather--particularly in the Salmon-
crested and the White-tailed Black Cockatoo is often exquisitely done,
and to my mind the two best plates are those of the Blue and Yellow
Macaw and the Browns Parrakeet, except for the latter's enormous
left foot, which is the same size as its head ! The Mealy Rosella looks
as though suffering from a bad chill, but the colouring is quite good
except that the patch of salmon-pink feathers is round the vent and
not on the thighs.
The Stanley--presumably a hen--is one of the best for contour,
but its colouring does not do justice to even the drabest female of the
species.
Quite the worst plate in the book is the Rock Peplar, not so much
for colour as shape, with its massive Macaw-like body tapering off to
a tiny Budgerigar-sized head, which, with the mantle, appear to be
clothed in fur rather than feathers.
One should not, of course, be too censorious of these ancient coloured
plates produced, with limited technical facilities, over a hundred years
ago ; but so uneven are their merits that it seems obvious that some
were done from living specimens and others from skins, and that,
while the best of the former are worth reprinting the latter are
extremely misleading and much better forgotten.

By C. S. Webb
The period under review, from the end of November to the end of
February, is naturally rather dull from the point of view of new
arrivals. However, there are a few things worth recording.
Ten Greater Flamingoes were received from the Giza Zoological
Gardens, Egypt. These are destined for Whipsnade when the weather
is favourable.
A North American Ruddy Duck (Oxyura jamaicensis) from the
Severn Wildfowl Trust, is new to our collection. It is an attractive
bird of the Stifftail group, and raises its tail to the vertical position
when displaying. We were pleased to get two Crowned Pigeons and
one Victoria Crowned Pigeon from Mr. Frost, as these are the first
arrivals since the war. To those unfamiliar with these birds it is as
well to mention that they are the giants of the Pigeon tribe--being
as big as Geese--are mainly terrestrial, and have large ornamental
crests. The Victoria Crowned Pigeon is easily recognized by the white
spatulated tips of the crest feathers.
Other interesting birds from the Frost collection are two Yellow-
crowned Bulbuls {Trachycomus ochrocephalus) and two Javan Hill Mynahs.
A welcome addition is a Kea, which recently arrived by sea from
New Zealand. An effort to bring it by air was frustrated because the
Australian authorities would not allow it to touch down in their
territory ! Much has been written and said about this remarkable
Parrot, but its chief claim to fame is on account of its supposed habit
of attacking sheep and tearing open their loins to get at the fat
surrounding the kidneys. Probably no bird is so playful and full of
curiosity, and it may be that the latter has been the cause of the
bird's undoing. Keas cannot resist anything new and so, in the early
days, they flocked round settler's huts to inspect anything unfamiliar.
In this way they are supposed to have found that strips of fat that were
hanging up were quite nice to eat, and a taste was acquired for this
new article of diet. Newly introduced sheep proved to be irresistible
to the playful Keas, as they could ride around on their backs and
enjoy themselves tugging out wool. Maybe through devilment, or
through some birds hanging on too tightly when sheep were on the
run, some animals were torn open, and the ever inquisitive and
intelligent Keas found in this way, it is assumed, that here was a
wonderful source of supply of fat. It seems equally feasible that this
strange habit may have originated through sheep being injured, once
the taste for fat had been acquired. One can fully sympathize with
sheep farmers in districts where Keas have become a menace, though
there is a difference of opinion as to whether all Keas should be
slaughtered. In some districts, for reasons unknown, they do not

attack sheep, and in other districts there are no sheep to be attacked,
but it is reported that Keas are slaughtered in great numbers every-
where, as there is a price on their heads. It is said that they do not
migrate from one district to another. If this is so, let us hope that they
will be preserved, at least, where they are doing no damage.
To revert to the Zoo, we intend shortly to stage a separate exhibit
of the British Owls on the same lines as the one of the British Grow
tribe. In this connection we have received a Long-eared Owl--hand-
reared and presented by Mr. Phil Bates of Whipsnade--but we still
need a Short-eared Owl to complete the British list.
By an extraordinary coincidence, shortly after deciding to make
our open lawns more attractive by running some Geese on them--at
the same time cropping the grass--a fox visited the Gardens and
slaughtered a pair of Gereopsis Geese, and a pair of Egyptian
Geese. As there was no further trace of the marauder, we continued
with our experiment, hoping it would confine its attentions to outer
London ; however, after a lapse of several weeks it returned, and
slaughtered a pair of Ashy-headed and a pair of Brent Geese.
A fairly large collection of Pheasants arrived recently from Calcutta,
some of which may remain in this Menagerie. It included 21 Impeyan,
3 Koklas, 3 Nepal Kalij, and 7 Cheer Pheasants, also 25 Ghukor
Partridges.
Just arrived are a pair of Chilean Black-faced Ibis (Theristicus
melanopsis) from South America.
Some of our Delamere's Giant Whydahs that came from Kenya
last summer are in full colour (February) in an outside aviary.

At the Council Meeting of the Society held on 8th March, 1950, it
was decided to open a " Coloured Plate Fund " to provide for further
coloured plates in the Avicultural Magazine. It is hoped that all
members who appreciate coloured plates will increase their subscrip-
tions by an additional donation to this Fund. At the Avicultural
Dinner held the same evening, the twenty-first of the series, the
Chairman, Mr. David Seth-Smith paid tribute to the Hon. Secretary,
Mr. A. A. Prestwich, whose idea the formation of the Club had been
and to whom its great success was due. The Club has done much to
weld the Avicultural Society together and much to stimulate interest
in both aviculture and the Society. Following the dinner Mr. Prestwich
received a cheque for #50 for the Coloured Plate Fund from the
President, Mr. A. Ezra, as a token of his appreciation and gratitude
for all Mr. Prestwich has done for the Society. A good example and
happy way of showing appreciation of the Hon. Secretary which so
many members undoubtedly feel.

RED-BILLED WEAVERS AT LIBERTY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994863" page_id="56287845"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
About the middle of November, 1949, two cock Red-billed Weavers were
accidentally let out here at Keston, while being transferred from one aviary to
another.
We had quite forgotten about them until, on 27th January--six weeks later--
we suddenly saw them sitting among various Tits and Sparrows in an elder bush
close to an aviary containing a hen Weaver, and both looking very fit and well.
I think it is interesting that they should have stayed and survived in mid-winter
without even being fed, and curious that nobody spotted them before, except that
some Weavers at liberty do seem to have a mysterious habit of suddenly vanishing
for quite long periods, and as suddenly reappearing again.
The two Weavers stayed around for about a week, and then did the vanishing
trick, but I've little doubt they'll turn up again soon ; the mystery--and one I've
never been able to solve--being where do they spend their time in the interval ?

MISTAKEN IDENTITY OF PLATE OF COMMON KING PARRAKEET
John Yealland (Vol. 55, No. 4) suggests that Dr. Greene's plate is one of the
" Island " King Parrots. I feel quite sure this suggestion is correct, but I had
overlooked it owing to my relative unfamiliarity with the extra-Australian members
of the genus.

With reference to Mr. Vane's letter on King Parrakeets, I do not think that,
beyond the fact that they both belong to the same order of birds and have a certain
superficial resemblance in form and colour, there is the least affinity between the
members of the subgenera Alisterus and Pyrrhulopsis. Having kept both, I can say
with confidence that it is difficult to find two groups of Parrakeets more utterly
unlike in every respect.
Between the species of Alisterus in which the sexes are alike and those in which
they differ in appearance there are fairly marked points of resemblance and also
fairly marked points of distinction. In voice the former group are definite Kings,
but in temperament both sexes are fierce birds, addicted to murder, which the
Australian King is not.
The climate of the East seems, indeed, to have a bad effect on the manners of
Parrakeets of the Australasian group.

For many years I longed to possess the Timor Crimson-wing (Ptistes jonquillaceus),
but when my ambition was at length realized I found that the whole order of
Parrots does not contain a more ill-conditioned brute, nor one more tiresome from
the avicultural standpoint--not only does he pluck himself with more frequency
and persistence and less excuse than any other psittacine bird, but he kills his wife
as a matter of habit, and, if he should be tame (?), hates the human race--and
especially his owner--with an intensity that must be seen in order to be believed !

BIRD SHOWS

<listItem confidence="0.8171266" page_id="56287846"  page_num="100" year="" vol="">
Mr. Goodwin's communication on this subject requires an answer. He asserts
(1) that at Shows birds are " a misery to themselves, a disgrace to their owner, and
a most potent weapon for those who would abolish all aviculture."
(2) That the efforts of breeders to produce winning birds results in their Uglifica-
tion and Derision, as Alice might say. " Hideous and monstrous," says Mr. Goodwin
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98029684375" page_id="56287846"  page_num="100" year="" vol="">
quite emphatically, for he is pretty good at invective.
Now anybody who lives very familiarly with birds knows at sight whether they are
uncomfortable, restless, discontented, bored, happy, or " a misery to themselves ".
The vast majority of birds at Shows are Canaries and Budgerigars. Some few of them,
used to aviaries, are a little bored and restless, but less so no doubt than Mr. Goodwin
when he has just missed a train and has to wait an hour for the next.
About the British birds one cannot speak so dogmatically and I do wish that their
cages were larger--many of them, however, seem fairly contented, and such birds as
Nuthatches or Wagtails usually have decent-sized cages and seem easy in their
minds. I think many of the Finches in their tiny boxes are bored and weary long
before the end of a three-day Show, but out of the thousands of birds on view at the
" National " very few indeed could be described as a misery to themselves or definitely
unhappy at all.
As to the effect on the public, it is true that some people whose zeal (as usually
happens) is in direct proportion to their ignorance, violently object to any imprisoning
of wild birds. But such persons usually avoid bird shows altogether, and for one
visitor who is repelled and disgusted there would be, in my opinion, a dozen who
would decide forthwith to keep birds themselves. If Mr. Goodwin's view were correct
the Shows could not flourish as they do.
As to constituting a weapon in the hands of prejudiced fanatics there may be
something in that assertion, but that " something " is quite outweighed by other
considerations. " Vested interests " have an unprepossessing sound, yet sometimes
they are useful. The bird shows, together with the trade interests and the fancy
journals that support them, constitute a power for which we had reason to be thankful
when the originally destructive " Buckmaster Bill " was amended into a sensible, and,
indeed, admirable measure.
Regarding the alleged crimes of Uglification and Derision one must beg to differ
entirely. If one fact is clear and certain it is that Nature herself is forever making
experiments, and much more blindly than man. If mere man had produced the
archaeopteryx or the dinosaur Mr. Goodwin's vocabulary of expletives would have
run dry. Moreover Nature sacked the lot and tried again ; and v hat a boss shot she
made over the African lung fish and the giant salamander of Japan ! Or does Mr.

Goodwin admire these nightmare creatures because their very ancient lineage makes
them more truly " natural " ?
He considers the original Green Budgerigar far more beautiful than any birds
derived from them. If he can produce three unbiased artists I will bet him five
pounds to five shillings that they all disagree with him.
Breeders, being human, must sometimes err, but their work adds greatly to the
vast amount of pleasure and interest which many thousands of people derive from
the Shows. No, Mr. Goodwin, our birds are not a disgrace to us. We are creative
artists and very respectable : indeed if we happened to be foreigners instead of
Englishmen we should undoubtedly receive some sort of decoration and wear a nice
rainbow-coloured ribbon in our buttonhole.

London, S.W. i.
(The above letter was shown to Mr. Goodwin who replies as follows.--Ed.)
I feel some reluctance to cross swords with one whose articles--particularly " Sand
Martins in Captivity "*--have struck me as among the most pleasing that have
appeared of recent years in our Magazine. Nevertheless I feel obliged to reply to the
points made in his letter criticizing my remarks about bird shows.
If Mr. Scott re-reads my previous letter he will see that I said not that all birds
at shows were " a misery to themselves, etc,, etc.", but only such few birds as panic
at the crowds and strange surroundings. This I maintain is true, but I will go further
and say that the sight of what they consider to be " wild birds " shut up in tiny cages is
revolting to most of the general public. With regard to the ignorance and, in many
cases rank hypocrisy, of some of the anti-bird-keeping fanatics Mr. Scott and I are
evidently in accord, but that ignorance does not prevent them from sometimes getting
a hearing in influential circles. It may be--though I doubt it--that there are six
converts to bird-keeping made at a show for every visitor who is disgusted, but it is
a truism that hate is stronger than love (at least in Homo sapiens (?) ) and the person
who is disgusted is more apt to make his voice heard. For example after one of the
Palace shows--I think the 1948 one-- Punch published a most moving poem on
the subject which I will warrant made more enemies for bird-keeping than all the
pro-show eulogies in the fancy press made friends.
Aviculturists tend to preach to the converted (and of course not only aviculturists
are guilty in this respect) but I know that by far the majority of people interested in
birds that I have met have been definitely against the keeping of birds in captivity.
In many cases this has been due to their imagining that all aviculturists kept their
birds penned up in the sort of little cells they had seen at bird shows or in bird-dealers
shops. Most have expressed great surprise at seeing birds quite happy in moderately
spacious quarters and been ready to revise their views. In the main, however,
ornithologists are it seems against bird-keeping, despite the fact that many of the more
learned ornithologists have been aviculturists as well. Even now, however, the fact of
a man's being an aviculturist is sufficient to invalidate his opinions--irrespective of
his field experience--with some ornitholigists.
With regard to the trade and vested interests. It may be true that they were of
service in whittling down the Buckmaster Bill to its present sensible form. Yet it may
well be suggested that but for the disgusting cruelties and excesses of that trade such
Bills are hardly likely to have been inaugurated. It is true that the cruelties now
inflicted on domestic animals and ('\0x25A0'so-called ") vermin with the full approval of the
law and public sentiment far exceed any cruelties that were inflicted by the wild bird
trade (unless call-birds were at one time blinded on a large scale of which I have yet
to read or hear the account of a personal witness) but as public sentiment makes a vast
distinction as between say a Goldfinch and a pig that does not affect the practical as
distinct from the moral issue.
(2) I said that many fancy Pigeons were " hideous and monstrous " and expressly
stated that Canaries and Budgerigars had not yet produced anything really frightful.
There is, however, no reason to suppose that Man may not ultimately produce
something from these two species as revolting in appearance as a winning bulldog or
Show Homer. I have not seen a wild Budgerigar but from a comparison of museum

specimens I imagine that it would when alive have a certain natural grace and balance
that would make the domestic bird look coarse and heavy beside it. That some (not all
by any means) colour varieties of domestic Budgerigar are beautiful I agree but none
more beautiful than the Green. In the case of the Canary, Pigeon, and Domestic Fowl
I have seen the wild prototypes and am of the opinion that they are infinitely more
beautiful than even the best-looking of the domestic breeds.
That because Nature has produced creatures which appear to us as vile or monstrous
Man is therefore justified in taking some of her most beautiful creations and making
monsters of ugliness out of them is I think a rather debatable point, but for the sake
of space I will not attempt to debate it here. Nature certainly produces variations
but she only allows such as are fitted to their environments to survive. Whatever
may be thought of the dinosaurs and their contemporaries they were--whilst they
survived--adapted to their environments and the same is true of the present day
lungfish and giant salamander. Man, on the other hand, perpetuates variations,
such as the bulldog and the featherless Pigeon, which could not possibly survive if
cast on their own resources and which can justly be called monstrous in every sense
of the word.
So far as vertebrate animals are concerned I know of none which strike me as
having that kind of " unnatural " ugliness which one finds in so many " fancy "
varieties. Such creatures as baboons seem rather hideous, but this is probably one's
emotional revolt at seeing the feelings and motives that so largely dominate Man
expressed in their crudest form with none of the graciousness and, albeit at a sub-
rational level, kindliness which birds have evolved in their social relations.
Apart from every other consideration if only the time, money, and energy that has
been spent in producing fancy varieties had been devoted to the domestication of
other wild species--the Snow Pigeon, the Bronze-wing Pigeon, the Goldfinch, etc.--
how incomparably richer would our aviaries be to-day. It is indeed an oft repeated
and not altogether unjustifiable accusation against aviculturists that they have caused
countless thousands of wild birds to be trapped and then die off in captivity without
leaving either descendants or detailed records of their habits and behaviour.

WHITE EARED PHEASANTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957923117647059" page_id="56287848"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
The reference to White Eared Pheasants in Mr. Alex Hampe's article " Thoughts
about Pheasants " that appeared in Avicultural Magazine for January-February,
1950, points out strongly the danger that lies in the use of comparative terms. When
I marked this bird, in Mr. Weaver's list, as " fairly common " in this country, I had
in mind its position at that time, as compared with its former great scarcity. Up to
1947, really good progress was made, with a fair number of young being reared
annually. During the past two seasons, however, the White Eared Pheasant has
retrogressed so that very few remain. In the eastern states, there seems to be only
a single cock. Fortunately, there is a good hen here in the Zoo, which will be paired
with this cock during the coming season.
The form, incidentally, is Crossoptilon crossoptilon crossoptilon and not, as Mr. Hampe
suggests, C. c. drouynii . They were first received and successfully bred by the late
Leland Smith, on the Californian game farm in which Mr. Booth was interested.
On Mr. Smith's death, the stock was taken over by Mr. Claude Hooke, who con-
tinued to do well with them.
The season of 1950 will be a crucial one in determining the future of this fine
bird in American aviaries. Certainly, it cannot now be said to be " fairly common ".

The following year, 1933, produced another glorious summer with
long hot days and a wonderful sunshine record, and during the season
the following species reared young at the farm.

Parrakeets : Browns, Rosellas, Stanleys, Barrabands, Turquoisines,
Bourkes, Blue-wings, Elegants, Manycolours, Ringnecks, Redrumps,

Swainsons Lorikeets.
Lovebirds : Black-cheeked, Nyassa, Fischers, and Peach-faced.
Finches : Gouldian, Zebra, Red-headed Parrot, Long-tailed Grass,
Heck's Grass, Ruficauda, Cherry, Bicheno. Also Silverbills, Bengalese,

pair of Browns were a disappointment, not entirely through any fault
of their own. It is true they hatched and reared only two in their
first nest, the remaining three eggs containing young dead in the shell,
but they afterwards had a second brood all of which died in the nest
when about a week old. As they were always such model parents,
I cannot help thinking that this may have been caused by a pro-
longed thunderstorm of almost tropical violence, in the course of which
there was a terrific simultaneous flash and explosion, and our house
narrowly escaped being struck by lightning. It was after this storm
that the young Browns were found to have died in the nest.
Barrabands again did well, as did Manycolours, two pairs of which
alone reared ten young ones between them.
Having become rather tired of the extremely beautiful Hooded
Parrakeets' maddening habit of moulting hard all the summer, and
coming into breeding condition in the autumn, I decided to see if the
hen could be tricked into going to nest at the proper time of year,
and my plan proved unexpectedly successful.
In the early Spring, before she had started to moult, I mated the

hen Hooded to a cock Redrump who, unlike his new wife, considered
the Spring the proper time of year to breed.
When the hen Hooded refused to take the slightest interest in a
particularly seductive nesting site in the form of a natural hollow log,
the cock Redrump, much to her consternation, decided it was time
to start chivvying her about a bit, and she obviously thought that she
was mated to a lunatic. However, he persisted in his strange desire
to breed in the Spring, pursuing her tirelessly from end to end of the
aviary until finally she took refuge in the nesting log. However, if
she cherished any hopes of being permitted to indulge in a nice quiet
moult inside the log, both her hopes and her privacy were rudely
shattered, for if the cock Redrump suspected her of idling her time
away while out of his sight, he hurried into the log and routed her out
afterwards chasing her about again until she went back again and
showed some sign of taking her duties seriously.
In the end his persistence (and I had specially chosen him for this
quality) was rewarded, and four eggs were laid, three of which were
duly hatched and reared. All three were fine specimens, and turned
out to be cocks, being in appearance exactly what one would expect
this cross to look like. We sold these young hybrids, and I believe
they frequently appeared on the show bench.
The following Spring I allowed the cock to do his usual chivvying
and chasing until he had at last induced the hen to enter the nesting
log, whereupon I removed the cock Redrump, replacing him by the
hen's original Hooded husband. They showed every sign of pleasure
at being together again, and the result was a very nice brood of young
Hooded which were among the very few ever to be bred in this
country, and I think quite the first aviary-bred specimens ever to
leave the nest at the proper time of year.
The chief difficulty, of course, was the exact timing, for I was very
much afraid I might leave the cock Redrump in the aviary just too
long, so that the hen Hooded would have already been fertilized by
him before the return of her proper mate.
Ringnecks and Gockatiels were bred, and of the Grass Parrakeets,
Turquoisines, Bourkes, Blue-wings, and Elegants were successfully
reared. Turquoisines and Elegants, however, were only moderately
successful, but, on the other hand, nine young Bourkes were reared by
two pairs, and the same number by a single pair of Blue-wings.
During the season we obtained our first true pair of Golden-mantled
Rosellas, and also--too late to breed--two pairs of birds of outstanding
interest, namely Yellow-fronted New Zealand Parrakeets and Splendid
Grass Parrakeets in each case loaned to the farm for breeding purposes
by the then Lord Tavistock. Both were extreme rarities, which had
not been seen in European aviaries for upwards of thirty years.
Yellow-fronted New Zealands I had never seen before, though, as it

happened, I had already seen Splendids, as a pair had been presented
to ELM. King George V, from Australia, and on arrival were looked
after for him by Mrs. Fetherstonhaugh, who asked me to go over to
Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, where she then lived, to advise
as to their housing and treatment. I shall always remember, as one
of the major avicultural thrills of my life, the moment when Mrs.
Fetherstonhaugh took me up to the large flight cage in which they
were housed, and I first beheld a pair of the fabulous Splendid Grass
Parrakeets in the flesh !
Malabar Parrakeets did not breed, the cock being newly imported
and unable to fly, and pairs of Yellow-rumps, Pennants, and Crimson-
wings were all too young to breed.
It may be of interest to note here that we never bred Pennants, and
finally gave up keeping them altogether because of their exasperating
habit of promptly biting off their own tails as soon as they had grown
them again after the moult. Curiously enough, exactly the same
thing happened with a pair I had had years before at my old home,
which is not far from the farm, and one or two of our customers told
us that they had experienced the same trouble with Pennants.
One might have expected the very hot summer to produce unusually
good breeding results among the Finches, but this unfortunately was
not the case, and the numbers reared were in almost every case below
our usual average.
We noticed that on the more stiflingly hot days the sitting hens were
inclined to come off their eggs for long periods, and one could hardly
blame them, because the sunbaked southern slope on which their
aviaries were situated could be--in those days, when we really did
have proper Summers--almost unbearably hot. Some hens, however,
seemed to stay off much too long, which was doubtless the cause of
the many addled eggs.
Bichenos did fairly well, and quite a number were reared. There
are two distinct races of this very charming little miniature rather
owl-like Finch, one with a black and the other with a white rump,
known respectively as the Double-banded Finch and the Ringed
Finch, and it is interesting to note that a brood of " hybrids " reared
here between the two races all had white rumps.
Young Bichenos when they first leave the nest are probably easier
to sex than they are later on, as, although they are mainly grey, young
cocks usually have a faint but perceptible suggestion of a black band
across the breast.
Even Zebra Finches did only moderately well, their average
dropping to five young per pair, and Hecks and Long-tailed Grass-
finches decided to give the summer a miss, nesting in Spring and
again in the Autumn. Fortunately the latter was unusually mild,
enabling the parents successfully to rear their late broods.

For various reasons, Ruficaudas did badly. Two of our best breeding
hens died in the Spring, and two others laid but refused to sit, and in
the end the only young reared were from eggs foster-parented under
Bengalese.
Cherry Finches did worst of all, and what with the small number of
young ones reared, and the previously noted tendency of adults to
die suddenly, our stock was much reduced.
A fair number of young Bengalese and Diamond Doves were reared.
Four pairs of Red-headed Parrot Finches reached the farm in June,
having been kindly brought over for us by a friend who had visited
their remote native island of New Caledonia. Three of the pairs at
once started to moult, but the fourth went to nest almost as soon as
they were given an aviary to themselves, laying first a clutch of
unfertile eggs. These were removed, and they immediately laid
again, this time rearing four young ones, which left the nest in
September. The parents ate quantities of seed, flowering grass, and
millet sprays, and also mealworms. The latter have to be very care-
fully rationed to those Finches that will take them when breeding,
as they seem to be a very rich food, and if too many are supplied in
the early stages, the parents become over-stimulated and throw their
young ones out of the nest in their desire to breed again. The number
given daily should be very gradually and systematically increased as
the brood matures.
This pair of Parrot Finches chose to nest in a Budgerigar box, but
some pairs have the tiresome habit of ignoring the inside of the box
and building abortive nests on top of it. We found the only way to
overcome this was to give them specially made boxes with such steeply
shelving lids that any nesting material placed on top promptly dropped
off, and they eventually grew tired of this and nested inside the box
instead.
Young Red-headed Parrot Finches are very unlike their brightly
coloured parents, being sombre little dark green birds with faint
tinges of red on the forehead and tail. At this stage the upper mandible
is black and the lower one straw-coloured.
I always think they are about the most vivacious of all Finches,
being indeed hardly ever still for a moment but, while lethargic birds
are certainly dull, this perpetual motion also has its drawbacks, for
in an aviary of any size it is next to impossible ever to have a proper
look at these Parrot Finches.
Of all our Finches, Gouldians did best this year, the high spot being
the rearing of thirteen youngsters by two pairs, and this in spite of the
fact that the parents as usual refused to go to nest until late in the
Summer. Of these, five were reared by one pair, the remaining
eight all being fully reared by the other pair in a single nest ! They
were given a lamp in the shelter, and although they were not fledged

until November, twelve of the thirteen were excellent young ones,
the remaining one (the only runty specimen in the brood of eight)
dying about a week after it left the nest.
We tried Lovebirds in a new type of aviary, which proved unsuit-
able for Peachfaces, but a number of Blackcheeks, Nyassas, and
Fischers were reared.
Among the thousands of Budgerigars of an ever increasing variety
of colours bred annually at the farm, my partner had been con-
centrating on establishing and maintaining a really buttercup yellow
strain of yellows, instead of the greenish yellow birds which were at
that time only too common. Mr. Seth-Smith, I remember, was
particularly struck by these birds when he visited the farm, and
gave them special mention in the September number of the Magazine,
and during this season a number of young ones were reared from the
small original stock and were of equal richness and purity of colour
as their parents.
The two breeding results of outstanding interest during the following
season of 1934 were of Yellow-fronted New Zealand and Splendid
Grass Parrakeets, and the parents, and, if I remember rightly, the
young ones as well, were seen by Monsieur Delacour, Mr. Ezra,
Dr. Hopkinson, and Mr. Seth-Smith, when they paid a visit to the
farm partly to see these very rare Parrakeets.
The Splendids in particular were plagued with the usual vicissitudes
that are visited upon one's rarest and most cherished birds.
The pair arrived the previous Autumn, and spent the Winter in an
aviary with a heated shelter. The following Spring they soon went to
nest, and seven eggs were laid. When the hen had been sitting for
about ten days, however, the wings and feet of the cock suddenly
became completely paralysed, and, although he eventually recovered,
we were confronted with the immediate problem of what do do with
the seven eggs, as if all or even most of them hatched it seemed unlikely
that the hen would rear them single-handed. Eventually we decided
to take them away, and they were distributed between a hen Bourkes
and a hen Turquoisine, both of which had fortunately started to sit
about the same time as the Splendid.
All seven eggs hatched, but it seemed just too good to be true that
they should all be successfully reared, and so it proved.
Disaster first overtook those under the Bourkes, whose nesting log
split from end to end, hurling the almost newly hatched young Splendids
to the ground where, of course--the tragedy conveniently taking place
at night--they all perished. Needless to say several other logs,
incidentally all cut from the same hollow tree trunk, but containing
less precious broods, remained intact.
Then it was the Turquoisine's turn. Just as the hen had ceased to
brood the young ones at night there came a sudden Buchan's cold

spell, and for several days the weather was arctic, killing all but two
of the young Splendids, both of which were eventually fully reared
and fine youngsters. In the end, of the seven young Splendids hatched,
three were reared, the third by a pair of Nyassa Lovebirds, which had
been given an egg mistakenly supposed to be one of the Bourkes', but
which turned out to be a Splendid's !
Meanwhile the cock Splendid had recovered, and been returned
to his mate, who again went to nest, a nice brood of young ones being
hatched at the beginning of August. All went well to begin with, and
then all but two of the young ones died in the nest, but the two
survivors were successfully reared.
The final result, therefore, was not so black as at first seemed
probable, as we started the season with two Splendids, and ended
it with seven. After that, until the war broke out, we maintained
a fine breeding stock of this most beautiful of the Grass Parrakeets,
and in 1939 we had, as far as I can remember, either five or six breeding
pairs.

There is, presumably, a reason for everything. It is fairly evident,
for instance, that if most birds and animals have turned brown, from
whatever colour they originally were, it is for the same reason that
most soldiers have turned brown, to the sorrow of nursemaids and
others, after glittering for centuries in scarlet, or green and gold.
But why is it that some birds have remained or become gloriously
conspicuous, in flat defiance of the great principle of Safety First ?
If there were not some other cause at work, all creatures would be
brown (except in snow-bound regions), or, in some cases, green.
It is really a little too simple to explain everything on the basis of the
survival of the fittest, and there must be in nature an impulse towards
beauty, however it may have originated ; for beauty has no survival
value, and is sometimes a handicap. " II faut souffrir pour etre belle " ;
crests, wattles, tufts, and all such departures from streamlined utility
garments do but give a tooth- or claw-hold to the enemy.
The science of genetics has progressed for fifty years by leaps and
bounds, and we now learn that there are genes whose special function
it is to cause variations ; but when the mechanics of heredity have
been demonstrated to the last detail we shall be no nearer to under-
standing why the myriad inhabitants of the earth strive after beauty,
or, if you prefer it, have produced variations of which beauty has

usually been the result. This matter being too profound for the
present writer, and, perhaps, for the present reader, I will merely
give some account of the reactions which I have observed in birds
when confronted with mates of an abnormal colour or appearance.
Apart from the matter of choosing a partner, however, I may mention
in passing that nesting Sparrows will pick all the white feathers from
a mixed bundle before touching the dark ones. They will also
collect strips of white paper--or tear up white sheets--in preference
to brown. For this there may be a practical reason. When we have
a very dark room we paper it with white, and at once every corner is
visible. Sparrows have a dark nest and must, when feeding their
young, sometimes block most of the entrance with their bodies, though
I notice that they usually go right in, and then stand sideways during
the first few days after hatching. Whether their great discovery was
made by luck or cunning may perhaps some day be more certainly
demonstrated.
As Sparrows collect white feathers so assiduously, I thought that a
young female completely covered with them should excite at once the
greatest enthusiasm. But such was not the case. There was never any
indication that albinism or any other abnormality of colour, caused
either attraction or repulsion ; and this remained true whether it
were the cock or the hen that was unconventional in appearance.
The " sports " included Blackbirds, Thrushes, Starlings, Chaffinches,
Redstarts, Robins, Whitethroats, Goldfinches, Bullfinches, and a
great number of Sparrows and Greenfinches.
First came the Robins, about thirty years ago. They were
guaranteed to be an albino pair, and as I did not then know that all
wild albinos are hens, I was surprised when they both built and laid
in the same aviary. The only cause for surprise is that they never
quarrelled. However, I happened to hear at that time of a young
Robin, bred in an aviary, which at the age of a few months, set to
work and killed both its parents and all its brothers and sisters. Such
a charming picture for a Christmas card ! "A Robin in a cage,"
according to Blake, " puts all heaven in a rage," but the fury of the
angels can be no greater than that of the Robin if any other bird
is allowed to enter his private abode, of which, in fact, he is as proud
as a gipsy in a Council house. No more unsuitable bird could easily
be found for breeding experiments.
My albino Whitethroat was dangerously tame, and unfortunately
was trodden on before she had time to breed, while the Redstart
hen did nothing for two seasons, and then died. I attributed the
failure, at the time, to lack of vigour. There was no difficulty at all
about breeding the other species mentioned, and it seemed permissible
to assert that birds are not sexually interested in colour, so that the
Peacock must dress up to please himself, or to glorify his Creator.

This last season, however, my opinion was a little shaken, for I was
unable to get any hen Bullfinch to accept a most beautiful cock which
rejoiced in a pink head, neck, and breast, white wings and tail, and a
pale lavender body. This bird was uncommonly virile and enter-
prising, insensitive to snubs, and to the human eye most attractive.
Yet six hens in turn, from March to July, refused firmly his most
assiduous attentions, and the seventh merely encouraged him to feed
her, but allowed no liberties. He endured with patience a white
marriage which lasted long enough for the hen to build two nests
and lay ten infertile eggs, keeping close to her and feeding her
frequently, though she remained inflexible to the end.
This cock is spending the winter in a large cage with two new
hens bred last spring. If they in turn refuse his attentions, I propose to
dye his feathers, so that he may, as far as possible, look like an ordinary
Bullfinch. If he is then accepted, it will be fairly strong evidence
that to some birds at least, colour is important. It is noticeable, that
in all the species which mated quite freely with strange partners there
is normally little or no difference of colour between the sexes.
Chaffinches must be excluded from the argument, for in fact there
were many failures, though of little significance, since they occurred
with normal as well as with abnormal mates. A blue-breasted
Japanese cock Bullfinch mated, in isolation, with an ordinary British
hen, and a cinnamon hen with a normal cock. As hen Bullfinches
have produced hybrids with Canaries and with various Finches,
one might think that they care neither for colour nor shape ; but the
sexual instinct when frustrated leads to far greater aberrations than
these. I have a completely tame and strangely devoted cock Sparrow
which courts me in the breeding season with all the usual excited
display and finally goes through the copulative process against the
palm of my hand. Similar occurrences have been recorded. The
significance of the cases mentioned before lies in the fact that often
there was a free choice between plain and coloured, and sometimes
in a large aviary there were as many as six pairs of Sparrows or
Greenfinches, some being ordinary, and some so extraordinary that
often people familiar with birds could not guess to what species they
belonged.
Some birds are very ' choosey ", and this may explain many failures
with single pairs. The Mexican Hooded Siskin has not been easily
bred in this country, but I understand that a Swedish colleague was
highly successful with them because he placed a number in a large
aviary and parted them in early spring after noting their preferences.
We cannot expect to discover the cause of these preferences. A
Sparrow of nondescript colour, with a ragged tail and only one leg,
competing with others in a large aviary found a husband without
difficulty. Mammals also have their preferences and the attraction

There has been a very satisfactory increase of 50 per cent in the
Pheasant, Peafowl, and Junglefowl population of this country since
the 1947 count, roughly 1,800 birds comprising thirty-five species
being recorded as against the previous figure of 1,200 birds of thirty-
three species, and although there have been considerable fluctuations
with certain species it can be seen that there is a genuine attempt
by fanciers to build up stocks. A few of the rare species have declined
in numbers or vanished entirely, those lost to us including the remaining
examples of Copper, Blyth's Tragopan, Bulwer's, Malayan Argus,
and all but two Palawan Peacock Pheasants. Five additional species
have come to light ; a pair of Malayan Grestless Firebacks, six
Sonnerat's and two Javan Junglefowl, seven Cheer, and six Koklass
Pheasants, but perhaps the most important news to date is the arrival
from Calcutta of twenty-one Impeyan and three Nepal Kaleege
(this consignment also included the Cheer and Koklass). These
birds are on deposit at the London Zoo and it is to be hoped that some
at least will find their way to our major breeding establishments
where the fresh blood will be invaluable for rearing strong healthy
chicks. Of the less common kinds it is pleasing to report that the
Reeves' and Swinhoe's have doubled their numbers and the familiar
Golden, Amherst, and Silver Pheasants have more or less done like-
wise. Elliot's are still on the danger list although two hen birds now
appear on our records, and there are still a few at liberty at Woburn,
so that with care this species may survive. A male Bronze-tailed
Peacock Pheasant was reported, but not confirmed, and so is omitted
from the list. That beautiful bird, the Specifer Peafowl, has now
increased to three males and five females, so that there is a chance that
this species may again become established. It will be noted that the
Common Peafowl shows considerable increase and it should perhaps
be explained that this is in part due to the inclusion of a large number
not previously recorded. As these birds are at large it was impossible
to give accurate details of numbers and sex and so an approximate
figure of 100 was given and for record purposes must go under
" unsexed ". Before I receive requests for Peafowl may I point

out that the owner of this large collection does not wish to dispose
of any and in fact aims to build up his stock to many times this number.
Very few unsexed birds of any species are shown this time, the reason
being that this census was taken later in the year when the youngsters
of that season had either been sexed or disposed of prior to the count.
This fact may also be taken into account when comparing the numbers
of Mikado, Edwards, and Impeyan, with those of 1947 and which
now show a decrease, and it is presumed that many young birds
may have gone to individuals of whom we have no record, for I am
convinced that there are more birds of these species in the country
than those recorded. I do hope that owners will supply details if they
have not previously done so. It will be seen that the only Bel's hen has
gone, but at the same time a male bird makes an appearance. If
this latter bird had been reported in 1947, steps may have been
taken to arrange a mating which would, perhaps, have kept the species
going until such times as fresh blood could be introduced. Alas !
It remains but a show-piece. The Eared Pheasants have remained
more or less static, and the reason for this may be attributed in part
to the conditions under which these species are kept. As most fanciers
know, both these and the Impeyan spend much of their time digging
with their powerful beak and consequently they must either be housed
in spacious enclosures or given access to fresh soil at frequent intervals,
otherwise they will quickly succumb to disease. Such was the case
with a pair of Impeyans which I was instrumental in obtaining for
Dudley Zoo, and a Blue Grossoptilon also died in similar circumstances.
An important fact has been revealed during the taking of this
census regarding the health of our Pheasants, and it is estimated that at
least 90 per cent of birds in captivity in this country are in first-rate
condition. I feel that this may be largely due to the present-day
feeding programme, for readers may remember that I previously
advocated a more varied diet and suggested that grain was to my mind
overrated. The variety of foodstuffs now in use is astounding and
includes the following : kitchen scraps, poultry meal, screenings,
broken nuts, wild berries, biscuit meal, sunflower, soaked bread
crusts, currants, sultanas, bananas, balanced poultry pellets, insects,
cabbage, lettuce, apple, carrot, chickweed, mealworms, gentles,
roots, maple peas, pigeon mixture, buckwheat, groats, wheat, oats,
barley, maize, canary seed, and greenstuffs not included in the above
list. The corn content does not appear to be of very great proportion
in the daily diet, and in fact only 45 per cent of fanciers record using
grain of any description, a high proportion of whom mention only
screenings or third-rate corn.
With regard to fertility, the average for Goldens, Amhersts, and
Silvers is about 75 per cent, although there are one or two outstanding
examples of 100 per cent reported. Four Golden hens belonging to one

fancier laid thirty-six eggs each in 1949, all of which were fertile, and
another hen is recorded as laying twenty-four eggs of which twenty-
three hatched. Details regarding other species are scanty, never-
theless from information received Edward's are reported as being
prolific, as are also Peafowl and Red Junglefowl. One or two instances
of over-fatness have occurred and this has led to infertile eggs. An
example of this is a Temminck's Tragopan which in 1948 laid and
hatched four, and in 1949 laid four with negative results. Whilst
on the subject of eggs an interesting fact regarding the packing of these
for sending away has been mentioned. A prominent poultry fancier
and exhibitor tells me that he always packs his eggs in a natural position
on their sides, and claims that this lessens the strain on the yolk sac
and the cords holding it, and the hatching results have so far been good.
This has been particularly noticed in eggs recently exported, and as
the usual practice is to pack on end it would be interesting to know
if any Pheasant breeders have tried this experiment, and if so, with
what result. With the present-day efficient air freight it would be
possible to have eggs from our Continental or American friends flown
here and put under a broody within twenty-four hours or so of being
laid, and when the import restrictions are lifted it may be worth
trying this method of packing.
The various species are distributed more or less the same as in 1947
and there are very few newcomers to the Registry with collections of
note. There are perhaps one or two worthy of mention, of which
there was no previous record. A representative collection owned by
the Hon. Peter Strutt comprises twenty-three birds of seven species,
including Goldens, Amhersts, Silvers, Swinhoes, Edward's, Reeves',
and Blue Crossoptilons. R. H. Carpenter, of Budleigh Salterton,
has twenty birds, the most interesting being Swinhoes, Reeves, and
Mikados. At the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust there are twenty-one
birds and here a male and four female Swinhoes are of special interest.
We are sorry to learn that Capt. Scott-Hopkins, for many years a
leading figure in the Pheasant world, has disposed of his birds, which
at one time comprised the second largest private collection in the
country. I understand that the majority of these birds have been
acquired by Mr. Russell-Parsons, of Swanage, where, it is hoped,
they will flourish. This gentleman has about forty-one birds at the
moment. Mr. Ezra, Terry Jones, and Mr. Hirst still maintain their
large stocks and there are roughly the same species represented at
Regent's Park and Whipsnade. A number of Reeves', Elliots, and pure
Amhersts are still at large at Woburn, together with various Kaleege
of mixed ancestry.
One or two Continental breeders and institutions have sent details
of their Pheasant collections which may be of interest to fanciers
in England. Mention should first be made of Mme Malisoux who,

in spite of uncertain health and also of the amount of work which the
new O.P.S. has involved, finds time to look after some thirty or more
birds. Amongst her collection will be found Palawan Peacock Pheasants
(5), Blyth's (5), Satyr (6), Ghinquis (4), one pair each Mikado,
Impeyan, and Amherst, and two pairs of Koklass. The latest news from
here was on 11 th April, when Mme Malisoux mentioned two young
Ghinquis hatched fifteen days previously. Mr. Reventlow has kindly
supplied figures for the birds in the Copenhagen Zoo, of which there
are about forty-five. Most notable are Temminck's, Blue Grossoptilons,
Grey Peacock Pheasants, a Koklass, and a number of White Peafowl.
Two well-known figures in Dutch Pheasant circles are Mr. P. Duyzend
of Zeist and Dr. Vallen of Blerick-Venlo. The former has eighty-
seven birds in his collection, including the usual common species,
together with two pairs each White-crested Kaleege and Swinhoes
and one pair each Impeyan, Cheer, and Brown Grossoptilons. There
are also some 1,000 or more game Pheasants of three types at this
establishment. Dr. Vallen has perhaps a more representative selection,
his seventy-two birds embracing some nineteen species. Here the
Pheasant enthusiast will find such gems as Satyr Tragopans and Siamese
Crested Firebacks, whilst there are also two pairs of Elliot's, four
species of Kaleege, Swinhoes, Edward's, Reeves', Mikado, Impeyan,
Cheer, Blue and Brown Crossoptilons, and in addition to the above
figure a number of interesting hybrids are to be seen. The party
visiting Cleres may like to know what Pheasants are to be seen there,
and the following is a brief account compiled from information
supplied by Mr. Fooks. There are approximately eighty-two birds of
this family to be seen, and here will be found the only representative
of the Imperial Pheasant that I can trace in Europe, a species intro-
duced alive for the first time to aviculture not so many years before
the war by M. Delacour. In addition to the usual species, there are
Bel's, White-crested Kaleege, Swinhoes, Edward's, Reeves', Elliot's,
Mikados, Impeyan, Cheer, Temminck's Tragopan, one Siamese
Crested Fireback, Brown and Blue Crossoptilons, Germain's Peacock
Pheasants, and the four different Peafowl. There are also some Red
Junglefowl and a single Sonnerat's and for those interested in mutations,
a pair of Black-throated Golden Pheasants.
In conclusion I should again like to thank all who have contributed
information to this Registry. Many exchanges and sales have been
arranged which it is hoped will still further the propagation of many
species, and whilst it has not been possible to help everyone, all
requirements are noted for attention as and when stock becomes
available.
Correction .--Since compiling this registry I have been informed by
Mr. Webb of the London Zoo that the recently imported Pheasants
referred to in this article have with the exception of one pair each

on to Antwerp. This will be a great disappointment to those who keep
and admire Pheasants, particularly as they are wild caught birds
and would have been invaluable for breeding purposes.

(Continued from page 66 )
The mild and equable climate of the West Coast makes bird keeping
vastly easier than it is in Central and Eastern North America, even than
in North-Western Europe. Most species can be kept there outdoors
all the year round with the simple help of a cold shelter. Frost and
snow, which create difficulties in colder countries, can be discounted ;
when they come by accident they never last long enough to cause
trouble. As far as small birds, Parrakeets, Doves, and game birds, are
concerned, California is practically the ideal country to keep and
breed them. It is not so satisfactory for waterfowl, as grass is very
poor and water scarce ; also the abundance of birds of prey and
vermin makes it practically impossible to keep birds in parks and
gardens, they have to be protected by a roof of wire netting.
Aviaries have been built by the hundred during the last thirty
years all over California. There are a great many bird and game
farms, most of them more or less completely commercial, as well as
lots of private collections kept for the pleasure and interest of their
owners, who simply sell or exchange young birds.
I spent less than three weeks in California in 1949, from the last
week of September till the middle of October, attending the annual
meeting of the American Pheasant Society and visiting friends.
I could only see some of the most outstanding collections in such
a short time, and I greatly regret to have missed a number of interesting
ones.
A. Northern California
I stayed several days with my old friends Mr. and Mrs. Eric Kinsey,
at Manor, some twenty miles north of San Francisco. They both are
the essence of bird and plant lovers. The Kinsey collection is famous
for its almost complete series of native passerine birds, Woodpeckers,
Owls, small waders and a few others. It is quite unique in the country
and perhaps in the world.
Mr. Kinsey has a wonderful knowledge of Californian birds at
liberty, and on account of the thorough study that he has long been
making of their food, breeding, and other habits, he holds a permit to
capture and keep the protected species. In the care of the birds, he
and Mrs. Kinsey are outstanding. The most difficult birds, such as the
various American Wood-Warblers, Tyrant Flycatchers, Woodpeckers
Tits, Nuthatches, etc., are kept in perfect condition. They are housed

in a dozen compartments, most of them thickly planted, each with
a good shelter ; a large aviary with a roomy house for Warblers and
Vireos ; a larger one for Troupials, Grackles and other strong birds ;
several others for Woodpeckers, Owls, Jays, and Magpies, and an
enormous flight, 50 by 25 feet, 20 feet high, with a heated house and
many indoor compartments, where many species of small birds live
and nest.
In the house are cages for particularly delicate birds and pets :
Phainopeplas, Glarinos, Black Phoebes, Canyon Wrens, etc., and in
some orchid houses, small glass cages for Humming-birds. All the
accommodation is carefully planned, fitted with every sort of modern
improvement and meticulously kept, which is the answer for their
unusual success in keeping the most difficult birds. Many breed there :
California Woodpeckers, Mountain and Western Bluebirds, Yellow-
breasted Ghats (Ideria virens) among others.
The only exotic birds at Manor are some Indian Shamas, Mexican
Glarinos, and some very old Black-chinned Yuhinas.
To the south of San Francisco, near Palo Alto, another friend,
Mr. A. Isenberg, also possesses a fine collection of small birds, but
mostly exotic ones kept outdoors in two very large garden-flights and
many smaller ones. The more delicate species live in several compart-
ments of a greenhouse.
Mr. Isenberg practically only keeps softbills and fruit-eaters. He
has many Thrushes and Robins, Babblers, Bulbuls, Jays, Motmots,
Toucans, Touracous, Tanagers. In the tall bamboos of his largest
aviary a flock of Chinese Zosterops have been breeding for years, and
under a shelter a female Mexican Solitaire (Myadestes obscurus) mated
to a Glarino (M. unicolor ) has reared nearly a dozen young during the
last two years. There are Shamas and Dyals, Rifle and Regent Birds,
Bower-birds, Australian Pittas, Honey-eaters, Sacred Kingfishers, and
Quetzals. A large and beautiful collection, set in a pretty subtropical
garden, full of wild native birds, where Chinese Hoamis, or Spectacled
Babblers, have been established. The climate of Palo Alto is even,
mild, and very favourable. The greatest difficulties there are attacks
by hawks and the depredations of the minute Argentine black ants,
which kill young in the nest. Game farms are numerous around San
Francisco, some very remarkable, which I never fail to visit.
Mr. J. W. Steinbeck is no doubt the most successful and experienced
breeder of Doves and Pheasants in California, and he has recently
added Grassfinches and Waxbills to his collection. His house stands
on a hill near Concord, which is some distance from the ocean and
therefore hot in the summer. His aviaries consist of several long rows
of large compartments, all fitted with deep and wide shelters along
the entire back and planted with trees. There are many pairs of
Pigeons and Doves, large and small, in each of them, but only one of

each species, and often also a pair of Pheasants, of which he keeps
only the rarer kinds--Satyr and Temminck's Tragopans, Germain's
Peacock Pheasants, Monals and a few others. As an example of his
success, about 40 Tragopans, 15 Peacock Pheasants, and many
Monals and Eared Pheasants were reared in 1949. But Doves are
Mr. Steinbeck's speciality. He rears many hundreds each year. He
has all the best known species, including European Wood Pigeons and
Turtle Doves, and also unusual ones : Philippine Cuckoo-doves,
Brush, Squatter, and Smith's Bronzewings, Mountain Witches,
Luzon and Bartlett's Bleeding-hearts, Australian Greenwings, Jobi,
Grayson's, Martinique, Peruvian, Pigmy, Ashy and other Ground
Doves, and Nicobar Pigeons. Never have I seen so many Doves
breeding so successfully in the same aviary. A special mention must
be made of the lovely Australian Plumed Doves, several breeding
pairs of which live in various pens. In a row of about 20 compart-
ments, 10 feet deep and 3 feet wide and 6 feet high, are kept as many
pairs of domestic Ringed Doves. The Plumed Doves lay abundantly,
but seldom incubate ; so their eggs are entrusted to the Ringed Doves,
which rear the squabs perfectly. Contrary to previous experience
they feed them readily after their early departure from the nest.
Over 50 have been raised last summer.
Mr. and Mrs. Steinbeck, of course, exercise a constant and keen
watch on their birds and they leave nothing to hazards. For instance,
they remove the first hatched chick of some of the more difficult
species, hand-feeding it for a day or two, until the second egg hatches,
as otherwise the second chick would not survive. The first one is put
back into the nest afterwards. This requires much care and skill.
Mr. Steinbeck, alone in California, has for many years made a living
out of his birds, of which he is, however, as fond as any amateur I know.
There is at Pleasanton, in the same neighbourhood, another
good bird farm belonging to Mr. C. J. Van der Storm, a retired Dutch
bulb grower from Oregon. Mrs. Van Storm was always fond of birds
and kept a few pheasants. They now have a fine collection of these
birds, of Quails and Doves, and also some Australian Finches and
Parrakeets. There were lots of excellent young Brown and Blue
Eared Pheasants, Firebacks, Edward's, Elliots, and Germains, Cocka-
teels, Lovebirds, etc.
I had unfortunately no time to visit Mr. Thierry, near Oakland,
who breeds a few of the rarer Pheasants and has several pairs of the
White Eared Pheasant and Palawan Peacock-Pheasants, nor several
other excellent breeders, but I saw at leisure the two largest collections
in Northern California, both in the vicinity of Napa : those of Mr.
R. H. Gibson, at St. Helena, and of Mr. Claude Hooke, at the Circle
H Ranch.
Mr. Gibson owns a great deal of land, mostly vineyards, and a very

important wine business. Birds are a hobby with him, although he
sells his surplus birds. During the last few years he has built spacious
and beautiful aviaries near his house. There are first two rows of
large flights, with a wire-covered path between them. They are
planted, contain small ponds, and are inhabited by Demoiselle,
Stanley, and Grown Cranes, various waterfowl (among which figure
Emperor Geese, Eyton's Tree-ducks, and Ruddy Ducks), Pheasants
and Pigeons. A little further stands a huge block of aviaries, consisting
of large pens in the middle, surrounded by a double row of compart-
ments separated by roofed-over paths, forming a vast rectangle. There
are all sorts of game birds, Doves and Pigeons, Lovebirds, and some
Parrakeets. The most remarkable are Victoria Grown Pigeons,
Vulturine Guineafowls, Siamese, Malay and Bornean Firebacks,
White Eared Pheasants, Nicobar and Wonga-Wonga Pigeons and
Mountain Witches. Many young have been reared, particularly
Edwards, Blue, Brown, and hybrid Blue X White Eared Pheasants,
Ghiloe Wigeons, Carolina and Mandarin Ducks, Malay and Siamese
Firebacks, Crested Tinamous, Mexican Gurassows. Most species are
represented by several pairs and, on the whole, the collection is
outstanding, the accommodation elaborate and excellent.
Away in the high hills and far from any town, the Circle H Ranch
is beautifully situated among forests of redwoods, California laurels and
other interesting native trees. The game farm is large and it contains
the finest collection in America to-day. There are hundreds of pens for
adult and young Pheasants and Peafowls, rows of raised cages for
Quails and Partridges, which must be kept off the soil on wire netting,
many coops and raising runs for chicks. A high flight is dedicated to
Ducks. There were also many Doves and Parrakeets, Ostriches and
Emus, but to-day only the latter remain, as it was found too difficult
to take care adequately of so many birds. The Circle H Ranch is
also used as a school to train war veterans in the art of game breeding.
All the species of Pheasants kept in captivity to-day are represented,
among them the only pair of Great Argus in America, and the last
female Rheinart's Argus ; an excellent pair of Imperial Pheasants,
reared at Cleres many years ago, which produced this year
over a dozen young, two pairs of White Eared Pheasants ; Satyr
and Temminck's Tragopans ; Germain's and Grey Peacock
Pheasants ; Berlioz (" Bel's ") and Horsfield's Kalijs. Three
Ocellated Turkeys and dozens of Sonnerat's Junglefowl were also
reared in 1949.
Mr. Hooke gathered this exceptional collection during the last ten
years, buying the totality of the stock of the late Leland Smith, of
Mr. Howland and Mr. F. Johnson, which were among the best in the
country. His enthusiasm is remarkable and American aviculture is
much indebted to him for his keen spirit and enterprise. I have just

passed to him the presidency of the American Pheasant Society, and it
could not fall into better hands.
B. Southern California
The region around San Francisco is the best for Pheasants and
Doves, but that of Los Angeles, warmer and dryer still, is more
suitable yet for the delicate birds. Consequently most of the large
collections and breeding establishments of Parrakeets and Finches are
situated in Southern California. They are very numerous, but I could
only see a few of them last October.
My old friend Mr. W. J. Shefller keeps most of his Lories and Parrots,
of which he has a wonderful collection, in Arizona, at Salome ;
many Cockatoos, Macaws, Lories, and Lorrikeets breed there regularly.
In his garden at Los Angeles, his fine round aviary, with many fan-
shaped compartments and a central shelter, contains an excellent
collection of Australian Parrakeets, Doves, Quails, and small birds,
both insectivorous and seed-eaters. There were nice young Barnards
and Rock Peplars when I was there. His collection is the most varied
in Southern California, and his near-by museum is well filled with skins
and eggs, some exceedingly rare, gathered around his ranch in Mexico
and in the course of several expeditions to that interesting country.
The veteran bird fancier, Mr. F. H. Rudkin, now nearly 90 years
of age, is still as active and devoted to his birds as ever. It was a great
pleasure visiting him once more. His large aviaries were still full of
excellent birds, with many young. The old Macaw, which lives at
liberty, greeted me as it first did fifteen years ago. Mr. Rudkin keeps
lots of Parrakeets, including the best--such as the Pileated (. spurius ),
the Scarlet-chested, or Splendid, and the Turquoisine. There were
many young, including dozens of Blue Masked Lovebirds, a beautiful
variety now common in California ; also lots of Gouldians and other
Grassfinches, some Quails and Hemipodes, Spicifer Peafowls and
many Pheasants. I counted nine young Monals and two Temminck's
Tragopans. Mr. Rudkin knows his birds so well and he is so gentle
with them that they are all tame, and it is always a treat to go with
him through his aviaries. In the near-by town of Fillmore, Mr.
Rudkin's son showed me his rare Parrots, which are kept in aviaries
built around his pretty garden. He was just back from England, where
he had had an excellent time. There were four young Leadbeater's
Cockatoos, two Shining Lories (L. garrulus), several Eclectus Parrots,
King and Queen Alexandra Parrakeets reared last summer.
Another excellent breeder of rare Parrakeets is Mr. David West,
whom I had not yet met. Before reaching his twentieth year, he has
already achieved great success. Last season he reared a couple of
dozen Splendid Grass Parrakeets, and also Turquoisine, Bourke's and
Elegant ; some Queen Alexandras, Barnards, Stanleys. Mr. West is

hard-working and very enthusiastic about birds and plants. He has
the right spirit and methods, and I was delighted to meet such a
promising young aviculturist.
But there are also Pheasant and waterfowl breeders in Southern
California, and I was pleased again to spend an evening at Paramount
with Mr. W. J. Parsonson, whom I have known since he was also a very
young and enthusiastic beginner. His principal interest is waterfowl,
of which he has a fine collection housed in large wired-over pens.
I noticed particularly Versicolor Teal, Golden-eyes, Ruddy Ducks, and
Maned Geese, eight of which were reared last summer, as well as three
Gereopsis. He keeps also a number of game birds, including Sonnerat's
Junglefowl and Spicifer Peafowls.
Mr. D. W. Rich, of San Gabriel, an experienced and keen veteran
breeder, also possesses interesting waterfowl and Pheasants, among
which Black-necked Swans, perfect Lineated and Horsfield's Kalijs,
and Java Green Junglefowls are conspicuous.
No trip to California, however, can be complete without a day or
two at the San Diego Zoo. I always enjoy a visit there with my old
friend Mrs. B. Benchley, the very able secretary of the Society. The
personnel, headed by the curator, Mr. Ken Stott, has a wonderful
spirit, and nowhere are creatures better studied and taken care of.
The equable climate of San Diego permits to keep practically every-
thing out of doors. The accommodation is always neat and practical,
and breeding results excellent, as much with the very numerous and
rare species of mammals and reptiles as with the birds. Among the
latter, a pair of Ocellated Turkeys produced last summer 16 young
through artificial insemination, a notable event, and there were young
Victoria Crown and Nicobar Pigeons, a hybrid Macaw (ararauna
X chloroptera) and, for the third time, a young Andean Condor, to
mention only the rarest. Hornbills were trying to nest. Curassows and
Guans breed every year, as well as Emus, Sarus and White-necked
Cranes. The Parrot collection is probably the best in the world, and
I noticed Quetzals, both species of Cocks of the Rock, an Australian
Rifle Bird, a Burmese Roller, a pair of Rothschild's Mynahs and many
rare Fruit Pigeons and Doves.
It is a great credit for the organizers and trustees of the Zoological
Society of San Diego, a town of some 200,000 souls, to have built up
such a wonderful establishment, which compares favourably with any
other in the world.

Distribution. --Although Tasmania is the stronghold of this species,
it is widely distributed along the coastal parts of the south-eastern
corner of the continent, and has been recorded as far north as the
Dawson River in central Queensland, and as far east as Adelaide.
Description. --The prevailing colour of this species is green, relieved
by a forehead and facial mask of red with a narrow yellow border.
There is some blue on the crown, cheeks, and wing margins, and the
under wing feathers are scarlet, as are a variable number of feathers
on the sides of the breast. The subcaudals are red, with a green
edging which varies in extent, the tail is an unusual blue, tinged with
red, and there is a small patch of cherry-red at the point of the
shoulder. Individual adults are none too easy to sex, but I think
most males are brighter, with more red flecking on the breast and
little or no green on the subcaudals. The iris is said to be yellowish-
orange in the male and brownish-yellow in the female. Immatures
are duller generally, with the under tail coverts showing very little
red, and the iris is dark in colour. Tavistock states that they undergo
a partial moult with assumption of brighter plumage when a few
months old, full adult plumage being attained in the following
autumn.
Variations. --No valid subspecies appear to exist, but individuals
show considerable variation, especially in regard to the amount of
red flecking on the breast.
Coloured Plates. --&amp;apos;Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 468)
is quite good, and the plate in Greene (vol. ii, p. 33) is even better.
There is also quite a good plate by Rutledge in Cassell's Book of Birds
(p. 444).
Field Notes. --I have only met with this bird on a few occasions
during its autumn visitations to South Australia. It is usually found
in company with various Lorikeets feeding on flowering eucalyptus
and its presence is made apparent by its very distinctive, warbling
call notes. It is generally assumed that the species migrates from
Tasmania to the mainland, but the evidence is doubtful, to say the
least.
Aviary Notes. --Although occasionally brought over from Tasmania
before World War II, this species has always been a rare one in

captivity in this state, and I have myself possessed only eight specimens
in all. The first four of these did not survive very long, some of them
dying suddenly, although apparently in good condition, a character-
istic which appears to be not uncommon in recently trapped individuals
that have not become accustomed to a captivity diet. Early in 1939,
I obtained a fine male from a friend in Melbourne, and a little later
I secured a female locally. These birds were noticed feeding in
November of the same year, but were not segregated at the time, being
housed in a mixed collection without nesting facilities. The following
year a different hen was mated to the cock, but it was not until
December, 1944, that they began to take an interest in a nest log.
One egg was laid on 20th December, and a second some days later ;
of these only one proved fertile and on 9th January a dead young
bird, with an empty crop, was found in the nest. For a short time
thereafter, I thought they would nest again, but no further eggs
appeared. The following season two eggs were laid in October, but
they disappeared, probably owing to the activities of an unmated
hen Naretha, who was sharing the aviary, and subsequently appro-
priated the nest and laid therein. On her removal, the Swifts laid
another egg early in January, but it was deserted after about ten days
incubation, and was found to be clear. The next season they appeared
to be in breeding condition earlier than usual, but did not lay till
just before Christmas ; on this occasion, both eggs were clear, and
soon after this both birds managed to escape. Since then, only a
single aged cock of this species has been in my possession.
The only successful breeding recorded in South Australia is that
of Mr. R. E. Lewitzka, who reared one young bird in January, 1935 ;
a detailed account of this achievement, which gained the bronze and
silver medals of the A.S.S.A., is given in Cayley's Australian Parrots
(p. 289). There do not appear to be any other recorded successes in
Australia, although the species has been bred on many occasions in
England and Europe ; it is interesting to note that both colony breed-
ing and polygamy have been practised on occasions.
(37) Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus)
Synonyms .--Shell Parrot, Warbling Grass Parrakeet.
Distribution. --Australia generally, but rarely found in the south-
western corner of Western Australia or in coastal eastern Australia.
Not found in Tasmania.
Description.-- Too well known to warrant detailed description, the
wild birds being of the colour known to Budgerigar fanciers as light
green. The main difference between the sexes of the adults lies in the
colour of the cere, which is bright blue in the male and varies from
brown to dirty white in the female. Immatures are duller in all

respects, with the facial spots less clearly defined and the barring of the
back of the head extending on to the forehead ; the cere is at first a
pinkish-violet shade. Adult plumage is obtained by a moult which
is usually completed when the bird is about four months old ; the sex
has usually become obvious earlier by the changes which have occurred
in the colour of the cere.
Variations. ---No valid races appear to exist amongst wild birds.
The number of artificially produced colour varieties is, of course,
legion.
Coloured Plates. --Good plates of the wild green bird are quite
numerous. To instance but a few, that by Roland Green in Mathews
(vol. vi, p. 475) depicts two adult males, whilst Greene's plate (vol. i,
p. hi) is a reasonably good representation of a pair. There is also
a good plate by Bailey appearing as the frontispiece to volume ii of
Butler's Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary , but the shade of green is too
dark.
Field Notes. --I have observed this species in the field on many
occasions. In dry seasons it is quite common in the vicinity of Adelaide
and on one such occasion I remember noticing the birds breeding in
hollows in fence posts near the Seaton Golf Links. In good seasons
it is seldom seen in the coastal areas.
Aviary Notes. --I first bred this species when a schoolboy during
World War I, and still vividly remember my pleasure in successfully
rearing five young birds from the first nest. Soon afterwards I was
given two yellow cocks, the only mutation known in South Australia
at that time, but I never succeeded in breeding from them, although
other fanciers were breeding them quite freely then. Since my resump-
tion, in 1935, of avicultural activities, I have frequently kept pairs of
Budgerigars, mainly wild greens, for the sake of completeness of the
collection, and have bred a number of young, but I have never
interested myself in the breeding of colour varieties.
The species is now so thoroughly and widely domesticated, and so
many books have been written about it, that I feel it would be pre-
sumptuous for me to deal with it at any great length.
(38) Ground Parrakeet ( Pezoporus wallicus)
Synonym. --Swamp Parrakeet.
Distribution. --Tasmania is the stronghold of the species at the
present time, but it also occurs in coastal southern Australia from
Fraser Island in south Queensland to the vicinity of Perth, and
possibly Geraldton in Western Australia. It is probable that it
formerly occurred in suitable country throughout the whole of this
mainland range, but that it is now restricted to small isolated pockets.
In Western Australia it has not been recorded since 1914, and it is

probable that it is restricted to the south coast, if it still survives. It
is still fairly plentiful in a few areas in southern Victoria, and until
a few years ago a colony existed in the extreme south-east of South
Australia ; this areas has, unfortunately, since been cleared. In
Tasmania it is said to be quite common in suitable localities.
Description .--The prevailing colour of the upper parts of this bird
is a bright grass green, with each feather marked with black and
yellow deckings in a pattern very reminiscent of the marking of some
quails. The breast is of a duller green shade with small black flecks
on the centre of each feather, and the abdomen is of a yellowish
shade with pronounced black barring. The long, pointed tail exhibits
the same colour combination, the upper surface being mainly green,
whilst the under surface shows much yellow. There is a narrow
frontal band of an orange shade. I have never been able to ascertain
any reliable sexual differentiation from a study either of living birds
or of skins, but it is stated the shade of green is darker on the head of
the female. The immature plumage is said to be only slightly duller
than that of the adult, but the frontal band is absent, and the above-
mentioned sexual difference is said to be more apparent. I have no
information as to the age at which the frontal band is acquired.
Variations .--Western Australian birds are stated to have more
yellow on the abdomen, whilst those from Tasmania are described
as being darker generally.
Coloured Plates .--Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 486)
is extremely lifelike, and that in Greene (vol. i, p. 121) is quite
adequate. There is also a reasonably good plate by Lear in Selby's
Parrots (pi. 29).
Field Notes .--I have not been fortunate enough to see this species
in the wild state, although I spent a morning last month (January,
1950) tramping through a swamp at the mouth of the Glenelg River
in south-western Victoria, where five birds had been observed a
couple of weeks previously.
Aviary Notes .--The only recent observations on this species in
captivity are those of Manfield (Avicultural Magazine, 1941,
pp. 172-4) and Webber (Avicultural Magazine, 1948, pp. 41-5),
and the reader seeking detailed information is referred to these two
interesting and valuable articles.
I have never possessed an example of this species, and my know-
ledge of its habits are the result of oft-repeated observation of the
three birds kept for a long period in the Adelaide Zoo and a couple
of brief visits to the collection of Mr. A. Leer, at Manly Vale, near
Sydney. The birds in the latter's possession always seemed extremely
timid, but those in the Adelaide Zoo soon became quite fearless. It
was always thought that the first and third of these to be acquired were
probably males, and the second possibly a female, but on this bird's

death in 1949, it was found to be a male, whilst the other two, which
fell victims to rats some year or so earlier, were so mutilated that their
sexes were not ascertained. Even if there was a pair amongst these
three birds, they never showed any signs of wanting to nest, although
I never considered that the enclosure in which they were housed was
either sufficiently roomy or well planted enough to encourage them
to do so.
There seems little doubt, from the observations of both Manfield
and Webber, that this bird has a feeble call-note, resembling that of
the Grass Parrakeets ; I was never fortunate enough to hear it.
The Zoo birds never perched in the strict sense of the word, although,
as the photograph reproduced herewith shows, they occasionally
sat on branches placed on the ground. Furthermore, they were
never observed to climb the wire-netting of their enclosure, though
they would hang awkwardly to it if frightened sufficiently to make
them fly, a procedure which was discouraged in the early stages of
their captivity by wing-clipping.

Synonyms. --Spinifex Parrot, Western Ground Parrakeet.
Distribution. --Northern South Australia and the adjacent portion
of Central Australia, with extensions into central Western Australia,
and possibly into north-western Victoria, appear to have constituted
the known range of this bird.
Description. --Although superficially similar to the preceding species,
this bird differs in its much shorter tail and duller plumage generally,
with more yellow on the abdomen and the complete absence of a
frontal band. There is no record of any difference in the plumage
of the sexes, nor is there any description of the immature plumage
that I am aware of.
Variations. --Mathews states that skins from Western Australia are
duller than those from South Australia.
Coloured Plates. --The plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 495) by Roland
Green is very good, as also is that by Cayley in The Emu , vol. 23, pi. 40.
Field Notes. --The only notes of much value are the oft-quoted ones
of Andrews, which are reproduced in Cayley's Australian Parrots
(p. 308) ; these stress the nocturnal habits of the species. All expedi-
tions in search of this bird in the present century have proved un-
successful, although feathers have been obtained.
Aviary Notes. --A specimen was presented to the London Zoo by
Dr. Ferdinand Muller, but it apparently did not survive for very long.
The statement attributed to Brisay that the species was bred by Russ
on the Continent in 1877, would appear to call for considerable
credulity. There do not appear to be any records of this species being
kept in captivity in Australia.

Synonym. ---Goliath Cockatoo.
Distribution. --As far as Australia is concerned, this species is only
found in the northern part of Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, but
a similar, probably identical, bird occurs in New Guinea and in the
Aru Islands.
Description. --A large Cockatoo of a slaty-black colour with a long
thin crest, an enormous beak, and a patch of dull red bare skin on the
side of the face. The female is said to be a little smaller than the male,
and the size of her upper mandible is quite appreciably less than that
of her mate. Immatures are said to have the feathers of the under
parts barred and tipped with pale yellow, a feature which disappears
at the first moult.
Variations.-- The Australian birds appear to be identical with those
found in the islands to the north, although possibly a little smaller.
Coloured Plates .--Goodchild's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 77) is
of that artist's customary high standard, whilst that by Lydon in Greene
(vol. iii, p. 125) is reasonably good, although the bare area on the
face is of a purple shade, a colour which is reputed to denote ill health.
Field Notes. --Donald Thomson, in Birds of Cape York Peninsula , says
that this species is usually found in small parties in scrub or jungle
country, from which it ranges into surrounding savannah in search
of seeds being especially fond of the fruit of the pandanus palm.
Aviary Notes. --Most of my knowledge of this bird has been derived
from a study of the specimens in the Adelaide Zoo, where three, out
of a consignment of six obtained just over twenty years ago, still
survive. A pair of these birds have nested there on several occasions,
laying a single egg each time, and twice a young bird has been hatched,
but in neither case has it survived for more than a few days. At the
time of writing (March, 1950) the hen of the pair of birds referred
to is again incubating an egg. As is apparently the case in the wild
state, the birds make a rough nest of pieces of bark and sticks, on
which they lay the egg.
This Cockatoo is quite unlike its relatives in its behaviour and
habits generally. Its main call note is a shrill, quite indescribable
whistle, it has a peculiar habit of stamping one foot when excited or
alarmed, and the colour of the bare facial patch becomes brighter
with the same emotions.

parts of Australia are concerned, the bird is rare in south-western
Australia, and is also found in small numbers in western Victoria
and the adjacent parts of south-eastern South Australia. It is also
found in parts of Gippsland, eastern Victoria.
Description. --&amp;apos;The general colour of the adult male is black, with a
slight greenish gloss, and there is a broad band of scarlet on all the
tail feathers except the central pair. The adult female is of a brownish-
black colour, and most of the feathers of the head, back, and wings
show a small yellow spot, whilst the feathers of the breast and abdomen
are margined with yellowish-orange. The tail, band is a mixture of
yellow and red, interspersed with black barring and mottling. The
beak is whitish horn as opposed to black in the male. Immatures
resemble the adult female, and males take four years to acquire the
adult plumage, becoming progressively less spotted at each moult,
and the tail feathers gradually becoming less speckled and barred.
My observations suggest that young males are always less heavily
spotted than young females.
Variations .--At least three fairly well-defined races occur. The
Eastern Australian birds, which range from about Port Denison, in
Queensland, down through New South Wales into the eastern
extremity of Victoria, may be considered the typical race, and are
sometimes referred to either as magnificus or stellatus. They exhibit
a long crest and the tail bar of the female shows more red than yellow.
The northern race ( macrorhynchus ) is not very different in size, and
crest shape from the foregoing, but the females have very little red
in the tail bar, which is consequently mainly yellow mottled with
black. The birds from the south-west of Western Australia, correctly
designated naso, and frequently and incorrectly stellatus , are smaller
than the typical birds, with smaller beaks and shorter, more rounded
crests. To which described race, if any, the birds from south-eastern
South Australia and western Victoria belong, I am quite uncertain ;
the only bird derived from that area that I have observed is a hen, and
she exhibits narrow red bars on the tail, which extend nearly to the
tips of the feathers.
Coloured Plates. --The only relatively easily accessible plate that I
am aware of is a beautiful one of a pair of the northern race ( macro-
rhynchus ) by Goodchild in Mathews (vol. vi, p. ioo). Reichenow also
figures a pair in his book (pi. 12, figs. 6 and 7), but this work is rare, in
Australia at any rate.
Field Notes .--I have never seen this bird in the wild state. In the
south-east of South Australia and adjacent parts of Victoria, they are
said to occur in small parties which mingle with flocks of the Yellow-
tailed Black Cockatoo, but they do not appear to have developed the
taste of the latter for the nuts of the introduced pines. In Western
Australia, the species is said never to associate with flocks of the more

plentiful White-tailed Black Cockatoo. In Northern Australia, the birds
are quite common, and are said to congregate in very large flocks.
Aviary Notes .---This species is by far the best known in captivity of
the Black Cockatoos, the young birds being usually taken from the
nest and hand-reared, an extremely tedious and laborious procedure.
When so treated, most males become very tame and well-disposed
towards humans, and will often display to them ; in such cases, they
will seldom become friendly with birds of the opposite sex. Hand-
reared females, on the other hand, usually lose their friendliness as
they become independent of human feeding.
This species was apparently first hatched in captivity in 1939, in the
collection of the then Marquess of Tavistock, and the young bird was
ultimately hand-reared by one of his aviary attendants. According
to the brief account in Avigultural Magazine (1940, p. 136), incuba-
tion would appear to have lasted approximately two months ; how-
ever, Mr. E. J. L. Hallstrom, of Sydney, who has now bred a number
of young birds of this species in his collection, informs me that the
incubation period is twenty-nine days, and it would therefore appear
probable that one of the months referred to in that account is incorrect.
In 1945, two pairs of this species nested in the Adelaide Zoo, and
each successfully reared one young bird ; although eggs have been
laid in the Zoo, both previously and subsequently, no other results
have eventuated. The first pair consisted of a male of one of the large
races, which was in adult plumage when acquired in July, 1913, mated
to a female obtained from the south-east of South Australia in 1936
or 1937. Two eggs were laid, the date not being recorded, and one
of them proved to be infertile. Incubation was carried out by the hen
only, and a young bird was first seen in the nest on 3rd February.
It flourished, and was observed looking out of the nesting log on
12th April, but it did not leave the nest until 10th May; a total
period of ninety-six days since hatching. It was first noticed feeding
itself on 8th September, four months after leaving the nest ! This
bird was from the first regarded as a male, and it attained full adult
plumage late in 1949, by a series of gradual incomplete moults.
The second pair were relatively young birds obtained from Western
Australia a few years previously, and belonging to the subspecies naso.
Their first egg was laid on the floor of their aviary, and was broken.
About a month later, another egg was laid in a hollow scooped out
in the ground in a corner of their enclosure. This egg was incubated,
and hatched on 5th April ; the young bird was easily observed and
appeared to grow very quickly, and after a time it began to roam about
the floor ; consequently, bricks were placed around its corner to
prevent this. This bird eventually flew to a perch on 18th June, when
seventy-five days old, and it was first noticed feeding itself on 13th
October, again approximately four months after leaving the nest.

From the first, this bird was correctly considered to be a hen, being
much more heavily spotted and barred than the other young bird ;
time proved this to be correct, its plumage having altered very little
over the years. The parents of these birds were fed on a mixture of
sunflower seed, hulled oats, and boiled maize ; in addition, lettuce
was supplied and a few pine nuts were relished whenever available.
The display of this Cockatoo consists of the crest being erected and
the feathers of the cheeks puffed out, so as to hide the beak, and the
tail being fanned to show the red bar ; a soft, almost purring, note is
uttered at the same time.
(42) Glossy Black Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami )
Synonym. --Leach's Black Cockatoo.
Distribution. --Little is known of the exact range of this species. It
is said to extend as far north in central Queensland as the tropic of
Capricorn, having been recorded from the vicinity of Rockhampton.
In New South Wales it is said to be fairly plentiful in the neighbour-
hood of Forbes and Parkes, and it was formerly common near Sydney,
and also in the Illawarra district. It seems to be extremely doubtful
whether it has ever been recorded from the state of Victoria, but it
was apparently reasonably plentiful in the Mount Lofty Ranges in
South Australia in the last century. Nowadays, its South Australian
range is certainly restricted to the western end of Kangaroo Island,
and it is almost probably quite rare there. It seems certain that this bird
and the Banksian are frequently confused with one another, and this
may account for the paucity of the records of this species.
Description. --The descriptive name, Glossy, is singularly inappro-
priate. The adult male is a smaller edition of the previous bird, with
the same scarlet tail band, but it differs in that the whole of the head
is of a brownish shade. The adult female resembles the adult male,
except that she has the red tail band crossed with black bars and
speckled to some extent with yellow ; she differs markedly from the
female of the preceding species in not being spotted and barred on
the body feathers. Adults of both sexes in many instances show an
irregular marking with orange-yellow feathers on the head and neck ;
this peculiarity appears to be more common in females. As in the
preceding species, the beak is black in the adult male and whitish
in the female. Immatures resemble adult females, but it is not known
how long the young males take to assume the uninterrupted red tail
bar.
Variations. --The Kangaroo Island birds do not differ appreciably
from those from eastern Australia.

in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 125), and quite a good representation of a

(pi. 12, fig. 1) under the name solandri.
Field Notes .--I have never met with this species in the wild state,
and very few notes have been published regarding its habits. Its
principal food appears to be the seed of the Sheoak (Casuarina sp.).
Aviary Notes .--This species is practically unknown in captivity, the
only example I have ever seen being a single bird in the collection
of Mr. E. J. L. Hallstrom, of Sydney. This gentleman, who has been
remarkably successful with the rearing of nestling Black Cockatoos
of the other three species, has found the Glossy extremely difficult
and the bird referred to is the only survivor of several young birds
taken from the nests with a view to hand-rearing.
Some years ago, a bird of this species was kept in captivity by the
ranger at Flinders Chase, Kangaroo Island. It was later liberated,
but has become famous because of the oft-repeated statement, almost
certainly erroneous, that it had a red crest.

of South Australia and the Mount Fofty Ranges. It is also found on
Kangaroo Island and on the southern part of Eyre's Peninsula.
Description .--The general colouring of this bird is a brownish-black
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.978932105263158" page_id="56287887"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
with slightly paler edgings to most of the dorsal feathers ; the under
surface is of a somewhat browner shade, and the feathers have fairly
broad yellowish margins. The ear coverts and tail bar are yellow,
the latter being spotted with black to a variable extent. The sexual
differences have seldom been emphasized, but they are well marked.
The beak is black in the adult male, and whitish in shade in the
female ; the ear coverts are dull yellow in the male and bright yellow
in the female, and the skin of the eyelids is pink in the male and
black in the female. In addition, the yellow tail bar of the male tends
to become clearer, and less flecked with black as the bird gets older,
whereas in the female it always remains moderately speckled. Im-
matures closely resemble the adults, and can be sexed when nestlings
by the shade of yellow on the ear coverts. Their beaks are horn-
coloured and those of the young males slowly darken.
Variations .--The Tasmanian birds were originally given specific
rank (xanthonotus ), they are said to be smaller with less speckling of the
tail bar ; it is, however, extremely doubtful whether they constitute
even a valid sub-species. The conferring of subspecific rank ( whiteae)
on the Kangaroo Island birds, is even more ridiculous as they have

Fleurieu Peninsula.
Coloured Plates. --The only coloured plate that is reasonably easily
accessible is an excellent reproduction of a female by Goodchild in
Mathews (vol. vi, p. 138).
Field Motes. --This species is still common in many parts of the
Mount Lofty Ranges, and I have observed it there on numerous
occasions, usually feeding on the nuts of various introduced pines.
It frequently congregates in quite large flocks, and its distinctive,
wailing cry can be heard from a considerable distance.
Aviary Motes. --This species has always been rare in captivity,
probably on account of the time required to induce young birds taken
from the nest to feed themselves ; once established, it appears to be
just as hardy and as long-lived as the Red-tailed species.
Several of these birds have lived in the Adelaide Zoo for a good
many years past, and it is from a study of these that most of my
observations have been derived. These birds have laid eggs on several
occasions, but only once in a nesting log, and even then incubation
did not follow. The species does not appear to have been bred in
captivity either in Australia, or elsewhere. Pairs of this species never
appear to be as well-disposed towards each other as do pairs of the
Red-tailed Black Cockatoo. The display, consisting of erection of the
crest and fanning of the tail, is much the same as in that species ; on
such occasions, the relative shortness of the crest feathers is easily
observable.
(44) White-tailed Black Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus baudini)
Synonym. --Bandin's Black Cockatoo.
Distribution. --Confined to the south-western corner of Western
Australia, extending as far north as the Murchison River, and east-
ward to the vicinity of Esperance.
Description. --This species closely resembles the previous one, the
upper parts being blackish-brown with the same paler edges to the
feathers, whilst the under surface is browner with whitish margins to
the feathers. The tail band and ear coverts are white and, unlike the
previous bird, the former is not flecked and speckled with black to any
great extent. The sexual differentiation is much the same as in the
preceding species, namely, beak black in the male and whitish in the
female ; ear coverts dirty white in the male and clear white in the
female, and eyelids pink in the male and black in the female. Im-
matures are sexable as nestlings by the colour of the ear coverts and
the beaks of the young males gradually darken.
Variations. --The inland birds are said to have broader, shorter
beaks than those found nearer the coast.
Coloured Plates. --A female of this species is beautifully depicted by

of a female in Lear's Illustrations of Parrots (pi. 6).
Field Notes. --On a visit to Western Australia in August, 1948,
I observed this species in several parts of the south-west, and on one
occasion watched a pair flying around in the vicinity of the Museum,
in the heart of the city of Perth, greatly to the discomfiture of the
pigeons living thereabouts ! A very large flock was seen at the Canning
Dam, and it was noticed that the birds kept very largely in threes,
which consisted of a pair of adults and, by its behaviour, a young
bird of the previous nesting season, which continually called to its
parents for food.
Aviary Notes. --The first time that I ever saw this bird alive was
when an overseas dealer passed through Adelaide not long before
World War II, with a lovely specimen in his possession. Subse-
quently, two young birds were obtained by the Adelaide Zoo but,
although they survived for several months, they never appeared to be
in very good condition. Mr. E. J. L. Hallstrom, of Sydney, had quite
a number in his collection when I last visited it in June, 1949, and he
informed me that they had laid eggs on occasions. They appear to
be very like the Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo in their habits, as
indeed would be expected, as they are obviously very close relatives.
In life, the plumage of this bird gives the impression of a rather
greyish shade, as opposed to the more brownish tinge of the Yellow-
tailed.
(45) Gang-Gang Cockatoo ( Callocephalon fimbriatum )&amp;apos;
Synonyms. --Red-crowned Cockatoo, Helmeted Cockatoo, Galah
(erroneously).
Distribution. --Found principally in Victoria and eastern New South
Wales, the northern boundary of its range in the latter state being
unrecorded. It is said to be plentiful on King Island in Bass Strait,
but is very rare in Tasmania, and probably only accidental thereto.
In south-eastern South Australia, it occasionally transgresses the
Victorian border in the vicinity of Naracoorte.
Description. --A unique little Cockatoo, with an unusual crest of
disintegrated feathers, the tips of which are curved forward so that it
gives the impression of never being completely lowered. The adult
male is mainly of a grey colour with each feather exhibiting a paler
margin and with a greenish tinge on some of the outer wing-coverts ;
the whole of the head and crest is red. The female differs in that the
head and crest are grey instead of red ; in addition, the wing-coverts
are differently marked with broader whitish edgings, and the feathers
of the breast and abdomen are barred with orange-red and greenish-
white. The sexes of immatures are distinguishable from the time
they leave the nest, young males resembling females except for the

crest feathers being tipped with red, and there being some red feathers
on the forehead. Adult plumage is said to be acquired by the young
males at the age of about one year.
Variations .---The shade of red on the head of the males varies con-
siderably, some being bright scarlet, and others quite a dull red shade.
Old females occasionally develop a few scattered red feathers on
the head.
Coloured Plates .--The plate in Greene (vol. iii, p. 131), presumably
by Lydon, is quite good of a male. That by Roland Green in Mathews
(vol. vi, p. 153) is accurate as regards colouring, but the hen is depicted
showing the crest quite flat, a position that is not generally assumed.
Field JVotes .--I have seen this species on several occasions in hilly
country in Victoria ; their flight is silent and owl-like, but they draw
attention to their presence, both in flight and when feeding, by their
very unusual and quite unmistakable calls. They feed largely on the
seeds of wattles, and have also developed a liking for hawthorn berries,
at times coming into the suburbs of Melbourne to feed on these.
Aviary Notes .--Always a rare bird in captivity and one to which
I have always been greatly attracted. Unfortunately, it very frequently
becomes addicted to feather-biting, and good specimens in captivity
are quite exceptional.
The first specimen that I ever possessed was a cock in perfect
plumage which the late Mr. Wachsmann, of Sydney, sent to me in
October, 1937. The following month, I obtained the loan of a very
tame hen that was in a deplorable state, not only as regards her body
feathers&amp;apos;, but also her wings and tail. The two birds were placed in
adjoining small Parrot cages, and it was immediately apparent that
it was a case of love at first sight. They were allowed together in a
medium-sized Parrot cage a few days later, and the plumage of the
hen soon began to improve with the onset of a moult, the new feathers
not being interfered with. By March of the following year, she was
in very good condition, only a few of the flight feathers not having
been replaced, and in April the pair were released in an aviary.
Within a few days her feathers were in almost as bad a state as they
had been when I obtained her, and the breast feathers of the cock
were also showing signs of unwelcome attention. I was so disgusted
that I returned the hen forthwith to her owner, and let him have the
cock as well. This pair of birds are still in captivity in this state, and
the cock remains in tolerably good feather most of the time, but the
hen is always in a semi-nude and flightless condition.
In December, 1948, I acquired another cock, a tame bird in very
good condition, and capable of saying a couple of words. This
bird I kept for nearly a year and it became very friendly, enjoying
having its crest scratched and always performing its quaint display,
consisting of a purposeful advance along the perch, culminating in a

hop with the crest erect, whenever spoken to. However, it was an
inveterate shrieker in the early morning,&amp;apos; and whenever alarmed,
and I eventually parted with it with considerable regret.
In addition to the oft-quoted breedings by Lecallier in France (vide
Cayley's Australian Parrots , pp. 88-90) and Tavistock in England
(Avicultural Magazine, 1938, p. 258), Gang-gangs have been bred
in South Australia by Miss S. Merrill eld, of Jamestown, a success
which gained the A.S.S.A. bronze medal, and also the silver medal
of the Society for the outstanding breeding achievement of the 1945
season. Miss Merrifield's birds were kept in a relatively small aviary,
and two eggs were laid in a hollow log. Both parents incubated, and
the young hatched on about 20th November, the incubation period
not being known. The first young bird left the nest on nth January,
and the second six days later ; both were cocks, and they were inde-
pendent in about another three or four weeks, having been fed by
both parents prior thereto. The parents were fed on sunflower seed,
boiled maize, and sweetened bread and milk ; in addition, green
food, such as lucerne, was provided, also bunches of eucalyptus leaves
and a little mutton suet occasionally. The birds showed a preference
for the sunflower seed and bread and milk whilst rearing the young.
I am given to understand that Miss Merrifield's birds have had
further successes in subsequent years.
Mr. Hallstrom, of Sydney, has also bred this species in his collection
within the last few years.

Reference to Capito aurovirens in the March issue of the Magazine
prompts me to record that I received a male of this species from
Mr. W. J. C. Frost in February, 1936.
My notes, made at the time, are somewhat brief but I believe this
bird was originally imported by Mr. Jean Delacour from the
Equadorean Andes.
The call was very similar to that of the better known Asiatic species
but given in a rather high pitch and each " spasm " was of
comparatively short duration.
The trivial name then used was the " Golden Green Barbet ",
a literal translation of the proper name which gave a very fair impres-
sion of the bird's general appearance. In addition to the golden-
yellow of the breast feathers, the whole of the back, scapulars, tail,

and flights were brownish-olive with a distinct golden sheen which was
very apparent in good light.
I have had a number of different species of Barbets and am familiar
with several in their wild state and in every case the call note has been
in a minor key. The name " Plaintive 55 would certainly be appropriate
to any one.
I have found the Barbets to make excellent subjects for aviculture,
being long lived and entertaining in their habits and easy to keep in
condition, and I was somewhat surprised to learn recently that some
aviculturists consider them to be " difficult ".
They do appear to be rather sensitive to draughts and cold damp
atmosphere and consequently are more suited to cage life in a bird-
room than to open aviaries and even in a cage they appreciate the
provision of a hollow log, into which they may retire at night, this
apparently being their normal habit in a wild state.
Their natural food consists almost exclusively of fruits and berries,
particularly those of the various species of Ficus, which are of a dry
and fibrous nature. Fruits and berries of this kind are to be found on the
trees practically throughout the year and it would hardly be an
exaggeration to say that in India " every Peepal Tree has its Barbet
They undoubtedly take some insects, particularly during the
short season when fruit and berries become scarce and also when
feeding young, and Salim Ali states (j Book of Indian Birds , p. 180)
that the Coppersmith ( Xantholcema ) " occasionally captures moths
and winged termites, launching ungainly and ludicrous aerial sallies
from a branch in their pursuit ".
My own birds of the Indian and African species displayed little
enthusiasm for live insects but Capito aurovirens was an exception
and was always ready to accept mealworms, earwigs, and small
beetles which confirms Mr. Delacour's statement (. Aviculture , vol. ii,
p. 340) that the American species are far more insectivorous.
They all show keen appreciation of soft sweet fruit, such as grapes
and pear, and over indulgence in this form of feeding may, I think,
account for the lack of success experienced by some aviculturists in
keeping them in confinement.
Barbets are somewhat gross feeders and require food of a more
sustaining nature and also plenty of roughage to help their digestive
system and counteract the effect of lack of exercise resulting from close
confinement.
They will hammer away contentedly at the hardest apple, cut in
half and hung in their cage and this, together with hawthorn and
mountain ash berries, privet berries, dried sultanas, and currants
(soaked overnight), chopped dates and dried figs and a little insecti-
vorous mixture moistened with grated carrot has always given most
satisfactory results in my own experience.

Naturally, one would allow for the size of the species being kept
and adjust the mixture accordingly but they appear to be able to
swallow and digest, without serious inconvenience, fruits of surprisingly
large size.
A particularly tame Blue-throated (Cyanops asiatica) which I had
for over nine years and which was regularly allowed the freedom of
my birdroom, once to my intense anxiety swallowed two whole
dates before 1 could cover the box from which it was greedily helping
itself. This occurred early in the morning and the bird certainly
looked a little uncomfortable when I had to leave shortly afterwards.
In the evening, however, it was as lively as ever and the two date
stones were lying in the bottom of the cage, cleaned and polished
almost to the texture of ivory !

surprise there is no record of Many-coloured Parrakeets being bred
in the U.S. (1950, 45). Nevertheless, they have not yet been bred.
There are still some females here, and maybe some day we will get
some males."
H. M. Borbidge, Victoria, writes : " My main success this year has
been in breeding the Painted Finch (Emblema picta). One pair laid
four eggs, hatched four young. When nearly reared one died, but the
other three are in the aviary now. I have never bred them before, but
they seem to breed freely, and I think a number of pairs will breed
together as a colony. The three young have proved to be two hens
and one cock ; so with one other cock, bought for #1, I have now
three pairs, and will see how they get along next season. Their
nesting time commences about October here. No live food was given
to them, and they seem as hardy as Zebras."
Dave Bush, N.S.W. : " Mr. Turner and I arrived back safely with
the Pere David Deer, lutino Ring-necks, Ultramarine Lorys, etc., all
in good health. We had it very hot through the Suez Canal.
Remember me to all the members I met in England, and tell them
if they are at any time in Australia to be sure and let me know.
" I have recently inspected the two following hybrids, which are
new to me (i) Corella (short-face) X Galah, (ii) Many-colour x
Blue-bonnet.
" My brother has again bred three nice young Little Lorikeets ;
the last two young went to America."
E. J. Hallstrom, Sydney, writes : "In regard to the unnamed
Parrots I procured in New Guinea. I found one had been previously
named Double-eyed Dwarf Parrot, and another Alpine Parrot. One
very nice bird may be described as a new variety of edwardsi --I think
a very much prettier one--and belongs to the family of Fig Parrots.
At present no previous record of this particular bird has been found,
so if it is not identified it will probably be called hallstromi. In regard
to the breeding of these birds, I am afraid there is a lot to learn.
The small Parrots choose a very small tree of soft timber, about the
texture and hardness--or should I say softness--of Balsa wood.
They cut a perfectly round hole into an upright tree, and then descend
about four inches where their eggs are deposited on some fine chips.
On a number of occasions young have been produced, but each
time, after some slight disturbance, they have killed them. They
need a great deal more privacy, and shortly I hope to have erected
what I believe will be suitable aviaries for this class of bird."
Members are requested to endeavour to increase the membership
of the Society. The Society needs as many new members as possible,
thus assuring funds for the continued issue of the Magazine at its
present size.

FOREIGN BIRDS FOR GARDEN AVIARIES. By Alec Brooks-

bank. Published by Cage Birds , Dorset House, Stamford Street,
S.E. i. las. 6 d.
Reading this book has brought back many happy memories. I was
always very fond of the foreign birds that could be kept in captivity,
but infinitely preferred to keep them in aviaries rather than cages
when this was possible, and no garden seemed to me quite complete
that did not possess an aviary where one's birds could be kept and
watched under more or less natural conditions. An aviary of this
kind gave one enormous pleasure and, although I cannot keep birds
myself now, I well remember the joy of discovering that one's treasures,
belonging perhaps to a species that had never bred in Great Britain,
were building their nest, and the excitement of the first appearance of
the nestlings. These were experiences not easily forgotten, though I
must admit that I had forgotten, until Mr. Brooksbank reminded me,
that the successful breeding of the Yellowish Finch first took place in
my aviary. One had terrible disappointments at times, but these
only made one keener than ever to succeed eventually.
It is a long time ago that I first commenced to keep foreign birds
and, although I did once succeed in breeding Gockatiels in a large
cage, I soon found that few birds were so accommodating and one
could not do without aviaries, preferably out of doors. And how
glad I should have been in those days to have possessed Mr. Brooks-
bank's book. It is true that there were a few books on foreign bird-
keeping, but the information they contained left much to be desired,
and one soon realized that one had to learn much from one's own
bitter experience.
No one is better qualified than Mr. Brooksbank to write a book
such as this, for he and Mr. Edward Boosey are co-directors, and
the originators of the Keston Foreign Bird Farm, where many kinds
of foreign birds have been kept and bred in garden aviaries since 1927.
Besides being an expert on the keeping and breeding of birds,
Mr. Brooksbank is a skilled photographer, and has formed the collec-
tion of portraits of his birds with which his book is illustrated, some
sixty pictures being reproduced ; in fact the text may be said to be
written around the illustrations which are placed in alphabetical order.
Although the species dealt with include the majority of the foreign
birds kept by aviculturists, one rather misses others which might
have been included in the text, even though no photographs were
available.
It is not easy to secure really satisfactory photographs of brightly
coloured birds, but in most cases Mr. Brooksbank has been very
successful, and produced pictures that can be easily recognized for

what they represent ; there are only two that I could not spot without
looking at the printed name. These were the Sydney Waxbill
(p. 183) and Golden-breasted Waxbills (p. 75). I could not at first
understand why the " Yellow Bunting 55 was included in the book,
for I have always considered this name to belong to the Yellow-
hammer, but soon found that it here referred to the Red-headed
Bunting. The author considers the latter name inappropriate, as the
bird has not, strictly speaking, a red head, but it is just as appropriate
as that of the Black-headed Gull which has a brown head, and it is a
pity to alter long established vernacular names.
I cannot agree with the author that the so-called " Silver Zebra-
finch 55 is "a great improvement on the normal bird ", though, of
course, this is only one's personal opinion. I am probably old-
fashioned, but it seems to me a pity to produce these artificial varieties
with a view to improving upon Nature. The normal type of the
Zebra Finch is a charming and beautiful bird, which I far prefer to
these present-day fakes.
Full advice is given upon the building and furnishing of the aviary,
the most suitable types of nesting-boxes and the plants to grow in the
flight ; and there is an important chapter on common ailments and
their treatment and, lastly, a complete index.

NATURAL HISTORY : MAMMALS AND BIRDS. By David
Seth-Smith. " Reason Why " Series. Herbert Jenkins, London.

This book, which is composed of three hundred and twenty-four
questions and their answers most interestingly and lucidly explained
contains all those points of information which one so often finds one
just does not know and which search in the usual textbooks fails to
provide. One hundred and forty of the questions and answers deal
with birds and include such great variation of subject as How do
Pelicans Catch fish--Why is the Secretary bird so named--Where do
Parrots come from and what are their chief peculiarities--Why does
the male Hornbill imprison his mate in her nest--or does he ?--Why
does the Toucan have so large a bill--When was the Canary first
domesticated? A clear and comprehensive index is included.
This is a book that will make a very wide appeal and certainly
no one who is interested in natural history will be able to resist the
expenditure of the necessary 7 s. 6 d. to procure it.

By G. S. Webb
At the time of writing (24th April) it is still rather early for new
arrivals, but we have been fortunate in getting a few things of note.
A pair of Purple or Green-backed Gallinules (Porphyrio mada-
gascariensis) arrived from the Jardin des Plantes, Paris. These birds,
known also as Reed-hens and Porphyrios, are rather like gigantic
Moorhens but of much more vivid coloration--being purple on the
under parts and olive-green on the back, with the face and throat
azure blue.
Although not uncommon in the wild state in favourable situations,
they are seldom seen because of their skulking habits. Their favourite
haunts are the reed-beds bordering lakes and swamps in Africa and
Madagascar. In the latter country, whence our specimens came,
they are particularly numerous in the vast reed-beds skirting Lake
Alaotra, but few of the local Europeans have ever seen them at liberty.
These Gallinules rarely move far from their safe retreats among the
huge beds of Papyrus reeds, the very edges of which supply much of
their natural food in the way of water-lily tubers and water-lily
seeds. They do not appear to swim.
Still harder to detect is the smaller Allen's Porphyrio which might
be considered a rare bird, even by a keen observer, but natives will
produce both these birds by the dozen by setting traps in the reeds.
It seems probable that Gallinules wishing to change their abode
do their flying at night. Both Allen's and the Martinique Gallinule
have been picked up on ships at sea.
A hen Sonnerat's Junglefowl from Cleres has made a welcome
addition to our existing stock.
A pair of recently arrived Stanley Cranes from South Africa was
presented by Mr. Alfred Ezra.
An interesting collection of Penguins, including Ringed, Gentoo,
Maccaroni, and a young Emperor Penguin has been presented by the
Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. The Emperor is new to
Great Britain.
Regarding Zoo happenings, we have bred for the first time here
three European Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo). They are at present merely
large animated balls of fluff. Previous broods were always abandoned
or destroyed because of interference--a problem not easy to overcome
where birds are on exhibit to thousands of visitors. This time the birds
were screened off and left to their own devices.
The Wattled Starling male has commenced his seasonal change
of head-dress, and by the time these notes appear it should be complete.
This seasonal transformation is, I think, unique among birds. In the

winter the sexes can hardly be distinguished, but in the spring the male
develops long wattles on the chin and erectile wattles on the forehead
and crown ; the head feathers disappear, and the skin of the head then
becomes yellow in colour. In the reverse season the wattles shrink
and disappear, and the head becomes fully feathered again.
It is probable that these changes will be illustrated in a future
issue of the Avicultural Magazine.
Many of our Pheasants have laid, and I hope to publish results in
the next number.
A word on longevity. A Condor that died recently had been here
for thirty-nine years. The larger birds of prey, like the Parrots,
have a long expectation of life, but it is surprising to what ages some of
the smaller birds will live. A Royal Starling that came with an
importation of birds from Abyssinia in 1923 is still going strong.
Other long-lived Starlings are a Glossy (21 years), a Red-winged
(22 years), and an Amethyst (23 years).
A Trumpeter Hornbill that I captured myself as an adult bird
twenty-one years ago in Portuguese East Africa is as fit as ever.
An Adjutant Stork lived here for forty-three years.
Against these figures it is interesting to read of the expectation of life
of some birds in the wild state.
David Lack in his monograph of the Robin estimates the average
length of life as 10 -8 months, and John Buxton in his monograph
of the Redstart, estimates that this bird's expectation of life is 9 * 3
months. A large percentage of these birds, especially the young and
inexperienced, are wiped out by predators.

Seventeenth Century Toucans.
Reading through the old county natural history books, I have noted two rather
curious items connected with Toucans.
In the Natural History of Oxfordshire , by Robert Plot, LL.D., late Keeper of the
Ashmolean Museum and Professor of Chymistry in the University of Oxford, first
published in 1676 (second edition, 1705), we read on page 182 : 44 In the year 1644
the Pica Brasiliensis, or Toucan, whose beak is near as big as its whole body, was
found within two miles of Oxford, and given to the Repository in the Medicine-
School, where it is still to be seen ; which argues it a bird of a very rank wing, there

being a necessity of its flying from America hither, except we shall rather say it
might be brought into England by ship, and afterwards getting away might fly
hither."
And in the Natural History of Lancashire, Cheshire and the Peak, in Derbyshire, by Charles
Leigh, Doctor of Physick, 1700, we find a plate depicting six birds, one of which, a
Toucan, is described on page 195 as : " The Brasilian Magpye ; this was driven
upon the coasts by the violent hale-storm, described in Mr. Burgher's first plate,
and found dead upon the sea-coasts in Lancashire."
Mr. Burgher's plate " shews the flashes of lightning, the largeness of the hail-
stones that fell in that storm and the hares and birds that were kill'd by them
The storm was in 1697, and great damage was done by the hail, " several stones
were nine inches in circumference, others were six, seven and eight."
A Toucan in those days must surely have been a bird of very considerable rarity,
and it is a little surprising that the owners of the birds now mentioned failed to take
better care of them.

May I reply to your correspondent, Derek Goodwin's letter regarding Bird Shows.
As one who has been attending, organizing, and on a small scale, exhibiting for a
great number of years, I entirely disagree with Mr. Goodwin's remarks and con-
clusions.
To say that Shows do not gain recruits to bird keeping is just plain rubbish. That
the person who objects to the keeping of birds in cages will not be converted by
attending exhibitions is quite probable, but I suggest that the lay public generally
are greatly interested in the various exhibits, and that many do take up our fascinating j
hobby can be proved by any Show manager or secretary.
The next point I challenge is that the birds exhibited would be left peacefully in j
their aviaries " had their owners cared more for their birds than for their own
aggrandisement ", and that this would be a good thing for the birds. That one 1
gets pleasure from winning a prize I do not deny, but as far as most of my friends
who exhibit foreigners is concerned, their first thought is for the birds.
I imagine that your correspondent has never exhibited birds, because I can assure
him that the excitement of Shows is certainly beneficial to most birds, always pro-
viding they are not sent to too many Shows, and that birds that are temperamentally
unsuited to Shows, as some are, are excluded.
All wild birds in their natural surroundings have to be in a state of alertness to
the many dangers that beset them from the time they leave the nest to the time j
they die. Birds in captivity soon learn to ignore their normal enemies beyond the
wire, and thereby also tend to lose their natural tenseness, and I have proved, at any
rate to my own satisfaction, that the keying up of a bird's nervous system by the
excitement of being exhibited is definitely beneficial to its health.
That there is a certain type of person who considers bird keepers sadists, etc., is j
certainly true, and I do most heartily agree that aviculturists can, and I think do,
combat this ignorance (for that is what it is) by inviting these people to see their
birds and aviaries. I have been amused on many occasions by the interest and
surprise of field ornithologists when viewing my birds, and their obvious contentment
in captivity.
I suggest that bird keepers can and should explain to the public when visiting
Shows what the birds are, where they come from, and any peculiar habits they have
in the wild, and I can assure my bird keeping friends they will be surprised and
pleased at the interest shown and the friendships that can come from these casual
chats.
In conclusion, I trust that aviculturists will support the Shows to their utmost, so
that we may see those feathered treasures that would otherwise be unknown to the
great majority, and that one of the happiest gathering places for those who want to

Mr. Goodwin would presumably class me as one who never exhibits a bird as
having so much feeling for my birds that I would not subject them to the degrading
cruelty of a show. That would not be correct. I do not show birds because I am
only interested in breeding them in captivity and studying the conditions which are
essential to their health and well being. My season is Spring and Summer, the show
season is Autumn and Winter. No bird can be at the peak of its condition for twelve
months of the year ; I try to bring mine to this point in the breeding season, and rest
. them during the show season.
That friend of Mr. Goodwin's who would like to stamp out bird keeping is, I fear,
far too common a type to-day. Having been reared and weaned on austerity and
controls, they have a mania for interfering with other people's business or pleasure.
They have an infinite capacity for fault-finding in others, and completely lack the
grace or ability to consider their own shortcomings. I have frequently been nauseated
by records of the exploits of many big game hunters and museum collecting expedi-
tions in the pursuit of scientific knowledge (to their way of thinking), but I have
not yet raised a banner " Ignorance rather than wholesale slaughter "--perhaps it is
time some misguided fool did.
Bird shows have an enormous educational and stimulating effect both on the
" lay public " and the average enthusiastic aviculturist. They provide an oppor-
tunity for the latter to gather from widely distributed areas to compare notes and
renew friendships. They encourage the competitive spirit--a point to which our

being a non-exhibitor.

Although a lot of words have already been spilled on the above subject, I should
like to add simply : Let the Avicultural Society adhere to avicultural matters and
leave out ornithology ; it will be better for all concerned.

(I entirely disagree with the views expressed in the above letter. Aviculture has
an important part to play in the science of ornithology, and to this end the Avi-
cultural Magazine has always striven. The amount of valuable data that has been
lost by aviculturists who have failed to record their observations on birds in captivity
is deplorable.-- Editor.)

DIAMORPHIC DOWN PATTERNS

Mr. Terry Jones' letter regarding the dimorphism noted in his Ross Goslings was
of interest to me, as I bred young from three different pairs of Ross during the last
few years before my collection at Wallingford, Conn., was dispersed.
All were identical in colour of down when hatched. A soft shade of yellow, almost
primrose, surrounded the eyes, and extended almost to the top of the head, which
shaded into a light grey, the back of the neck this light grey, deepening somewhat
on the back, and lighter grey underneath, with the throat yellowish. The primrose

colour faded after the first few days, to a light yellow-grey. This may be an awkward
description, as I cannot qualify as an expert either on colours or descriptive ability,
but I think it will give an idea of the coloration of the newly-hatched Gosling.
One pair (the first to breed) were both wild-caught birds. Surprisingly they were
exceedingly tame, and the female nested in a small building, and acted always much
like a domestic Goose. The other two pairs were made up of females from the wild-
caught pair, and two wild-caught Ganders obtained in California. The females
of the latter two pairs both nested in their second year.
In dispersing my birds, the Ross were sold or given to various people. Of these,
I have had the opportunity of seeing resulting progeny only from the pair given to
Mr. John E. Deeter, of Millbury, Mass. I gave him a female raised in 1945, and
one of the wild-caught California males in the Spring of 1946. Because Mr. Deeter's
conditions are not of the best for breeding, this pair did not produce young until the
1949 season, when four eggs were laid, and three young hatched and raised to
maturity, one of the young later being found dead. The newly-hatched Goslings
were identical in down colouring to those which I reared.
I obtained a hand-reared Ross female from Europe before ever being so fortunate
as to breed any, and although mated to a wild-caught male, she never nested. This
female was much larger and coarser in head and conformation than the wild-caught
birds I owned, and the young from them, and it is possible she may have been a
sterile bird which might have accounted for her marked difference when compared
with the wild-caught birds. It would have been interesting to have compared her
progeny with those from the wild-caught birds, had she ever nested, as they might
have shown a different colour pattern as mentioned by Mr. Jones.
So far as I am able to ascertain, there are not more than three persons breeding
the Ross Geese at the present time in this country, in spite of the fact that over a
period of several years quite a few hand-reared young were sold to wild fowl fanciers
in various parts of the country. The Ross is such a lovely little Goose and becomes
so tame and friendly, it is a delightful addition to any waterfowl collection.

In writing of the Yellow-fronted New Zealand Parrakeets it would
perhaps be as well to start with a short description of the bird, as
such is their rarity that even such an authority as Mr. Seth-Smith
told us that the ones at Keston were the first living specimens he had
ever seen.
Their prevailing colour is green, paler on the breast ; a band just
above the beak and a patch on the flanks bright red ; fore part of
the crown golden-yellow ; some blue on the lower edge of the wings ;
bill a pretty silver shading to black at the tip ; length 9 6 inches.
The birds' eyes are particularly striking, the iris being brilliant ruby
red. They can easily be sexed by their size, the cocks usually being
considerably larger than the hens, and this is even apparent as soon
as they leave the nest.
The Yellow-fronted New Zealand is one of the smallest of the
Gyanorhamphus Parrakeets, a family which in many respects differs
entirely from all other members of the Parrot tribe.
Their voices, for instance, resemble in miniature the bleating of a
sheep--surely the most improbable sound for a Parrakeet to utter !
Then, too, they have the very un-parrakeet-like habit of scratching
in the ground like chickens, this action being facilitated by their long
legs, which also enable them to run and jump with remarkable speed.
They have, too, the curious habit of running rapidly down wire netting
from top to bottom. All this makes them very fascinating to watch,
in fact as time-wasters when you are busy they are only equalled by
Swainson's Lorikeets when in playful mood !
The first bird we had of this species was a solitary hen which, in
lieu of a husband of her own kind, we mated to a cock Blue-winged
Grass Parrakeet, and though all the eggs proved to be clear, it certainly
looked at first as though there might be a brood of the most unique
hybrids, as they were a devoted couple, the cock continually feeding
the hen.

The first male Yellow-front to arrive here was not a particularly
good specimen, and the hen would have nothing whatever to do with
him, and again laid a clutch of unfertile eggs. Then, by a great stroke
of luck, we were able to obtain two fine males and mated the largest
of them to the hen, who at once fell for him in a big way. She soon
laid again, six eggs this time, and not only did all hatch but the whole
brood of six were successfully reared. They seem to go in for large
families, for on another occasion a brood of seven was successfully
reared. Indeed, so prolific and such excellent parents did they prove
to be that there seemed, at first, no reason why they should not
eventually become quite common as aviary birds, in fact, far more so
than in their wild state.
Alas, we quickly discovered that any dream one might cherish of
working up a really large breeding stock of these charming little
Parrakeets was foredoomed to failure, for it all too soon became
apparent that the ease with which they can be bred is only equalled
by the ease with which they die, at any rate in aviaries.
So impossible, indeed, did it prove to keep alive either the imported
parents or their aviary-bred offspring for more than, at most, eighteen
months or so, that we were eventually forced to give them up altogether.
Before reluctantly doing so, however, we tried them under a variety of
conditions and diets. In unheated outdoor aviaries ; in aviaries with
a heated shelter ; in large flight cages in a heated bird room ; with
bread and milk and mealworms (both of which they refused to sample),
and with and without hemp seed, of which they were inordinately fond.
But always, sooner or later, with the same discouraging result.
That there is some very real, though at present unexplained difficulty
in keeping these birds alive for any length of time was further proved
by the fact that Lord Tavistock's experience with them was---as he has
recorded in the Magazine--precisely the same as ours, and though he
bred them freely, so great was the mortality among them that he, too,
eventually decided to give them up as a bad job.
One does not like to be " beaten " by a bird, and though there ,
does not now seem the remotest chance of my being able to do so,
I should dearly love to have another shot at Yellow-fronted New
Zealands.
We had a bad season with Manycolours, possibly because of a spell
of exceptionally cold weather when the young were in the nest and
before they were properly feathered. Three pairs hatched between
them no less than seventeen young ones, yet of these only three were
ultimately reared.
Barrabands, also, did none too well. Certainly the old pair reared
a brood of five, but another pair let all their six young ones die in the
nest at varying stages of development.
One pair of Rosellas reared nine young ones in two nests, and a pair

of yellow Redrumps had a clutch of ten fertile eggs which one can
hardly blame the hen for not attempting to finish incubating.
Incidentally, all the yellow Redrumps now in aviaries (and a
surprisingly large number were recorded in the recent Parrakeet
Register) must be descendants of our old original hen, since she was
the first and only yellow Redrump ever to reach Europe.
We had recently managed to obtain several fine pairs of reputedly
wild-caught Stanley Parrakeets, and this season fifteen young ones
were reared.
These charming little Broadtails had always been particular
favourites of mine, and partly for this reason we decided to make
a concentrated effort to re-establish them in this country as easily
obtainable aviary birds.
The extent to which this effort eventually succeeded was strikingly
shown by the large number of these Parrakeets which appeared in the
last Parrakeet Register, for it should be borne in mind that when we
obtained our original breeding stock from Australia, Stanleys--*
except for an occasional small degenerate aviary-bred specimen--
were practically unobtainable and it was from then on that the Stanley
population in this country gradually increased until they achieved
their present satisfactory numbers.
After the fifteen reared in 1934 we annually reared and marketed
young Stanleys right up to the outbreak of war, in ever-increasing
numbers, meanwhile continually increasing our breeding stock by
retaining one or two young pairs each season.
We are now trying to work up a good breeding stock of them again
but are somewhat hampered by not being permitted to obtain some
badly-needed fresh blood from Australia, although the few pairs we
still have continue to produce young of excellent quality.
For various reasons neither Elegants nor Turquoisines were reared
here during 1934, but on the other hand, Blue-wings and Bourkes
both did extremely well, three pairs of Blue-wings rearing fifteen young
ones, and four pairs of Bourkes twenty-one.
It was during this season that a fine brood of Hooded Parrakeets
was reared, details of which rare event I have already given.
Swainsons and Red-collared Lorikeets as usual went plodding along,
producing excellent young ones at long intervals and in small
numbers.
Pairs of Barnard Parrakeets, Mealy Rosellas, and Rock Peplars
were obtained too late in the season for breeding, while a " pair "
of Crimson-wings turned out to be a fully adult cock and a young one
not yet in colour.
Mention of these two Crimson-wings which behaved at first so much
like a pair, reminds me of a bird problem that has always puzzled me,
namely whether one bird recognizes the sex of another through

instinct or whether this recognition is purely visual and is
entirely dependent upon the colours displayed in the other bird's
plumage.
At first I thought it must surely be mainly a matter of instinct, but
after many years' observation of birds in aviaries I am more and
more inclined to doubt this.
At any rate, certain it is that the " pair " of Crimson-wings alluded
to above lived in perfect amity until the young cock started to acquire
his black mantle and crimson wing patches, after which he began to
be so relentlessly persecuted by his adult companion that they had to
be separated. All of which I think points to the fact that sex recognition
in birds is almost entirely visual, and that instinct plays small, if any,
part in it.
I noted that the previous autumn we had obtained from India
a consignment of ten almost nestling Plumhead Parrakeets, all, of
course, quite unsexable. Later on it seemed likely that three of these
might be hens, but in the end I think only one or two of the whole
consignment proved to be females, thereby rather exploding the long
held belief that hen Plumheads are quite as abundant in a wild state
as cocks, but that, solely because of their more brilliant plumage, only
the latter were ever sent over. Whatever the cause of this scarcity of
hens, it is a thousand pities that this most elegant and beautiful little
member of the Palaeornis family, whose head really does appear to
have the matchless purple bloom of an untouched plum or grape, has
so seldom been propagated.
Plumheads, again, are one of those birds which in times past seem
to have had the reputation of being easy to breed, but I can only say
that we never found them so, and I imagine other aviculturists didn't
either, otherwise they would never have been allowed to die out as
completely as they have.
During the ensuing years and right up to the outbreak of war the
farm continued to expand rapidly, and in addition we opened premises
in London and also started publication of The Foreigner. As a result
of all these increased activities I am afraid my annual breeding
records became more and more scrappy, so that for the rest of this
article I shall have to rely mostly on memory.
The shop proved a useful London link between the farm and its
customers, but we found it quite impossible to keep the birds in really
first rate condition in a London shop, and most people preferred to
buy their birds direct from Keston.
The Foreigner , about which we had a good many qualms when we
first started it, eventually proved most successful ; so much so that
though at first it only appeared quarterly, it was finally, owing to
repeated requests, issued as a bi-monthly. I think a great measure of
the credit for its success must be given to my partner, Alec Brooksbank,

both for his very able editing of it and also for the fine quality of his
bird photographs which appeared in it.
One of our chief " headaches "--as I feel our Editor will probably
agree--was the great difficulty of obtaining suitable copy. Each
volume contained an earnest exhortation to subscribers to submit
articles and photographs for publication, but the response was meagre
to a degree. The reason for this is, I suppose, the unfortunate inferiority
complex about their birds which seems to afflict so many aviculturists,
and persuades them that unless their aviaries are replete with specimens
of the utmost rarity, nothing they write can possibly be of the slightest
general interest. Actually I believe quite the reverse to be true, for
I am certain that many people enjoy reading articles and mentally
" comparing notes " about birds which they themselves have kept, as
an occasional contrast to reading articles about rarities which they
have often never seen and in most cases are never likely to possess.
Now to return to the actual bird breeding activities of the farm.
We continued annually to breed most of the species already
mentioned, and among finches an additional success, namely that of
the rare Australian Painted Finch (Emblema picta) must be recorded.
They proved to be very little trouble, and though they were attractive
in their rather sombre way I can never for the life of me see why they
were christened " Painted 55 Finch, a name far more suitable for
a Gouldian.
At one time we had about six pairs of Royal Parrot Finches which
were always to me the perfect example of how unattractive even
a brightly-coloured bird can be unless its richness of colour is accom-
panied by an elegant figure, and--for lack of a better word--charm.
Our Royal Parrot Finches were certainly beautiful though their
blue is of a shade that does not light up particularly well. But their
untamable wildness had to be seen to be believed ! We tried them
in large cages ; in small aviaries ; in large planted aviaries, and
always the result was the same. They dashed madly about if one
went anywhere near them, usually ending up dangling, helpless, and
panting with their toe-nails caught in the wire netting, until they were
released.
-r *
I managed to endure them for about eighteen months, after which
we parted with them. During their period in a planted aviary furnished
with numerous nest boxes, two of the latter were found to be partly
filled with unfinished nests made chiefly of dead leaves, but there was
no sign of eggs.
Pintailed Nonpareils also failed to breed successfully, but were
beautiful and much less wild and of a far more elegant shape than the
Royal Parrot Finches.
Though I have no actual record of the date, I think it was this
year that I turned out a pair of the charming and diminutive Cuban

Finches into my planted aviary, where, though their brief trilling song
was frequently heard, little was seen of them as the aviary was at
that time much overgrown with a thicket of Snowberry. However,
when they did eventually appear it was with two recently fledged
young ones, and as I had not actually realized they had gone to nest,
the surprise was all the pleasanter.
At various times we bred King Parrakeets, Bauers, Crimson-wings,
and Princess of Wales's Parrakeets. The latter are, I think, a very
typical example of the " rogue " stock which often used to be sent
over to this country before the war, thereby gaining a bad breeding
reputation for a particular species of bird. On all hands one heard,
and, to a lesser extent, still does hear, complaints that Princess of
Wales's are inveterate egg-smashers. This cannot, however, always be
the case, as is proved by the very large number that have been reared
in confinenent at the Adelaide Zoo, South Australia.
Of the various pairs we had at Keston, all but one either ate or
smashed their eggs, the exception being a pair, the hen of which
seemed incapable of producing more than two, or at most three eggs
in a clutch, of which usually one was fertile and successfully hatched
and reared.
Finally, just before the war, I conceived a passionate desire to
thwart some of these infuriating egg-smashing females. I therefore
provided one of them with the usual grandfather clock nest box that
she was accustomed to, but replaced the filling of decayed wood on
which she normally laid, with a concave wooden saucer with a hole
in the middle just large enough for the newly-laid egg to drop through
immediately on to a drawer filled with sawdust beneath. In this way
I managed to collect a full clutch of--for once--unbroken eggs, and
a pair of Redrumps which were given three of them hatched and
fully reared three of the finest young Princess of Wales's I have ever
seen.
About 1937 the well-known American aviculturist, Mr. Eastham
Guild, personally brought over a number of pairs of the extremely rare
and beautiful little Ultramarine and Goupil's Lories for Lord Tavistock
who asked us if we would meet them in London for him and house
them in flight cages in our heated acclimatizing room during the
winter. This we did, and I was very pleased to have the opportunity
of studying these great rarities.
The Ultramarine is a tiny enchanting little Lory about the size of
a Lovebird, simply but effectively coloured deep navy blue and white
set off by red legs and beak ; yet, lovely as is the Ultramarine, I think
the rarer Goupils Lory, with its colour combination of pure white,
Cobalt, and deeper blues, and peacock green, is an even more exquisite
little bird.
While they were at Keston we fed them exactly as Mr. Guild had

during the voyage to England, namely on a considerably watered-
down edition of the ordinary Lorikeet nectar, and never had any
trouble with them. When they were sent to Lord Tavistock in the
spring, however, he decided, if I remember rightly, to give them the
same food in greater concentration, but this proved a mistake, and
there were several losses from liver troubles until they were eventually
put back on to the original diluted mixture. As far as I can remember
he succeeded in breeding both the Ultramarine and Goupils.

It was on my visit to India in 1933 that I first became interested
in birds, and it happened quite by accident.
Strolling down the streets one fine day in Calcutta, I beheld an old
man whose face was cracked with wrinkles, similar to the furrows on
arable ground after a plough has done its day's work, and he beckoned
to me. Curiosity overcoming my timidity, I went up to him and
inquired what he wanted of me. At first I thought he was a beggar,
quite a common sight, and was about to offer him some money, when
he said, "Tell your fortune, sir ? " I was thoroughly amused, and
told him to go right ahead, proffering my open hand, which he dis-
dainfully refused, but uncovered instead, a small cage, in which were
two birds--two very pretty birds.
I became, indeed, very interested, and ere long I was surrounded
by at least twenty inquisitive Indians, of all ages and creeds, probably
as curious as I was. Through sheer embarrassment I was about to
leave but, never ever hearing of a man's fortune being told by the aid
of birds, I reluctantly remained.
Out of his right pocket the old emaciated man withdrew some
envelopes, which he lay on the pavement before him. He then gently
opened the door of the cage and the two birds hopped out and then
flew on to his shoulder. Delving low into his other pocket he drew out
a few grains of paddy, and scattered them over the envelopes. Im-
mediately the birds flew on to the ground, hopped up to the grain
and ate avidly. When there werej'ust two grains left each bird picked
up with its strong bill an envelope each, on which lay the last
grain. These they carried to their master, who opened them and drew
out a slip of paper from each. What was written thereon was my
fortune, and that, gentle people, is my secret.
I gave him a rupee, and then got into conversation with him. The
tameness and utter fearlessness of these birds absolutely thrilled me,

<bodyText confidence="0.999199822222222" page_id="56287916"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
and I there and then made up my mind to obtain them. I offered him
quite a large sum of money, but he merely smiled, and said, " Sahib !
How can I sell you my livelihood ? " Nothing would weaken him,
so I decided to get others instead. Their lovely rose-pink bills,
blending with the soft grey colouring of their body plumage, added
to my admiration. He mentioned that the full black-headed one was
the female, and the other, with a black head and white ear coverts,
was the male.
On inquiring how he tamed them, he said that he first cut their
wings, installed them in a small cage, and then starved them. He
would occasionally throw one grain of paddy at a time to them, which
was greedily eaten. Gradually he started holding a grain between
his thumb and index finger, and would offer same to the birds through
the wire bars. This they soon learnt to take, and after a time became
tame, always eating grain in this manner. " It was very hard work,"
he said, but they are his main support now. He mentioned also that
at the time he had six others at home which were undergoing training,
as he always had to have some standby, in case of any deaths.
A few days later, going to the bird market, I beheld a large wire
cage with nearly a hundred of these birds and, to my utter amazement,
I saw no females --not one full black-headed one in the lot. Asking
the shopkeeper why the shortage of females, he smiled derisively and
told me that there were plenty of both sexes in the cage. Feeling he
was lying to me, I angrily walked out of the shop, for did I not see
only a few days ago a black-headed female with the fortune-teller ?
On going to another shop, a few stalls away, I saw yet another large
cage with even a greater number of these birds, and again no females.
The bird man, getting communicative with the prospect of a sale,
informed me that the birds were Java Sparrows. Asking him about
a full black-headed one, he said that these were very few and far
between, and that they were rarities. He seemed sincere, but I still
had my doubts. Anyway, I purchased four, bought a wire cage, had
them put in, and with two seers (4 pounds) of paddy under my arm,
I hailed a passing taxi. Very soon I was home with my cherished
possessions. No ! I did not intend reading fortunes, nor was I going
to undertake the very difficult task of taming them.
I had the cage hung up in the veranda, but the marble flooring
below, always getting wet--how these birds loved a bath--and littered
with husks, I proposed having an aviary erected in the compound.
Within a week, and at a very reasonable cost, I had a beautiful aviary,
12 feet by 8 feet by 6 feet, erected by an Indian carpenter, and released
therein my four Java Sparrows.
To learn more about my birds, I purchased a book, and then only
learnt for sure that the fortune teller had misinformed me. I was
still, however, worried about the full black-headed one that I saw.

At long last I was enlightened when I got a copy of Frank Finn&amp;apos;s Manual
on Cage Birds. Well, after fourteen years in India, during which time
I have seen thousands of these birds, I never saw one to match that
which the fortune-teller had.
My next move was to try and breed them. Accordingly, I ordered
two long baskets to be made. They were 6 inches diameter at the
bottom, gradually tapering to 2 inches at the opening. I loosely
shoved some dried " dupe " grass in both, and had them hung up
horizontally--one at each top corner of the aviary--furthest from the
entrance door.
It was not long ere investigations and a lot of fighting was going on
in the aviary, and then I observed one go inside. I was full of excite-
ment, and had some more dried grass collected, which I had thrown
on the aviary floor. My sweeper rushed to the back of the house and
came back with some small soft feathers of chickens, which he care-
fully gathered from the fowl runs, and these were also strewn on the
floor. These were soon being carried by one of them, and then I knew
I was nearing my goal. The nest must have been soon completed, for
I discovered one missing, and another sitting on guard near by.
The other two birds were getting on my nerves with their repeated
attempts at investigation, and when they came too near the sentry
would literally hurl himself at the one nearest his domain. This
caused me great anxiety, and I was determined to remove the two
intruders, but how ? They all looked alike to me, and I was scared
lest I removed the wrong ones. At last ! An idea struck me.
At night I had my sweeper remove the seed vessel. I was going
to starve them, and I smiled as I thought of the fortune teller. Early
next morning I carried their old wire cage and placed it on the floor
of the aviary, and on the tray I placed some paddy. I then tied
some string to the spring door of the cage, threaded it through the
wire netting of the aviary, and then, going out, I carried the string
to the veranda, where I patiently sat on a chair. Pulling on the
string, the spring door opened, and thus I waited. One of the birds
flew down, another followed, and very soon all four were hungrily
hopping around in search of food. Nearing the cage, one peered in
and then hopped on to the tray, and was eating heartily. The other
three soon joined in, and then I slowly slackened the string, and the
door gently closed, imprisoning the lot.
I hurried into the aviary with a pair of scissors, followed closely by
my sweeper, whose face was wreathed with a smile of satisfaction.
The sight of the scissors gradually changed his smiling face to one of
utter amazement. " What are you going to do now, Sahib ? 55 said he.
I told him, and he shuddered, but that was what I never did. Any-
way, I made him catch one bird at a time. I was not going to trust
those dangerous-looking bills--and with my scissors I went to work.

The first one's tail was cut to a point, the next one's in the shape of
a " V ", and the third's circular. The last one was released without
any undue damage to its tail feathers. Thus my means of identifica-
tion now was faultless. The cage was then removed, and the seed
vessel returned. Very easily now I detected the two intruders by
their tails. The same means of catching them was adopted. The true
pair was released and the other two carried away in the small cage
and given to my sweeper.
The pair successfully reared four healthy youngsters and had
another nest of four eggs, but this time only three were reared--one egg
being clear. This success led me to go in for birds in a big way, and
ere I left India in 1947 I had three large aviaries and boasted some
real avian gems. Apart from many Indian and African Finches, my
greatest treasures were from Australia, and these included 11

one pair Crimson Finches, and, last but not least, a pair of Pictorellas--
my prize birds--not because they were particularly pretty, but
because they were unique in the sense that they were the first pair to
arrive in Calcutta after an absence of twenty-five years. So the shop-
keeper informed me. It broke my heart to part with my Australians,
and I^afn not ashamed to say that it was with tears in my eyes that I
sold the birds I really began to love.
I have often wondered whether I would have ever taken to birds
had it not been for the old fortune-teller, or is this love for avian life
born in people ? If it is, then I owe the old fortune-teller in India
nothing. If not, then I do owe him a debt of gratitude which I will
never be able to repay, but I can at least say " God bless him ".

THE KING OF SAXONY'S BIRD OF PARADISE
(Pteridophora alberti)

Of all the bizarre and many-plumed types that form the remarkable
family of the Birds of Paradise, none is stranger, or for that matter,
less known, than the King of Saxony's Bird of Paradise. First
described some seventy years ago, it is even now among the rarest
of birds in museum collections, and no Zoological Gardens has ever
had a specimen in its cages. It is consequently regarded by ornitho-
logists as something of a myth, and it was with but faint hopes of
seeing the bird in the field that I first set foot in New Guinea.
It is a small bird, no larger than our Song Thrush, and rather soberly
coloured, grey-brown on the back, and yellow below, with a head

and neck of the yelvet-black so characteristic of the Paradise Birds.
From the head of the male spring two amazing plumes ; some ten
inches in length, and made up of a row of sky-blue enamel-like
flanges along a slender shaft. There is nothing comparable to these
plumes either among the Birds of Paradise or in the whole group.
We might well imagine such a bird as a dweller in the dense tropical
forests with their myriads of creepers, orchids, and pitcher plants such
as cover so much of the lowlands of New Guinea. It is not here that
the King of Saxony's bird must be looked for, but in the dank, gloomy
moss forests of the high mountain ranges, along the backbone of the
sub-continent. It was my good fortune to be sent to this very area,
and I wasted no time in inquiring as to where the bird might be seen.
I was taken out to a large stretch of forest at nine thousand feet above
sea-level, where for an hour or more my native guides led me through
dank undergrowth, and along slippery paths ankle-deep in mud.
Birds were few and far between, and there was something uncanny in
the lack of life--such a forest would teem with wild life in our own
country ; once, however, we were rewarded by the sight of a small
party of Princess Stephanie's Bird of Paradise (Astrapia stephania)
feeding on a berry-laden tree, and heard in the distance the curious
barking call of the Great Sickle-Billed Bird of Paradise (Epimachus
fastosus). Finally, a local head-man stopped and pointed ; far up
in the topmost branches of a forest giant was a small and apparently
insignificant bird. I got the glasses on to it, and made out the two
great plumes of the King of Saxony's bird, carried for convenience
along the back as their owner fluttered from branch to branch in
search of small insects or fruits.
Subsequently I had many opportunities of studying it in the field,
and found it to be an inhabitant of the tree-tops, seldom if ever coming
anywhere near ground-level. It is also a solitary bird, and it seems
unknown for more than a pair to go together. The call-note is a dull
screech. I have once had a glimpse of the display, which has also
been seen many times by Mr. F. Shaw-Mayer. The bird starts
with a whirring-churring call reminiscent of the African Weavers, and
flits from tree to tree, the great plumes thrown from side to side
forwards and backwards all the time. The display is solitary and
never seems to be communal as with the Great Bird and some others.
A few specimens have been in captivity, caught by Mr. Shaw-
Mayer, and I saw them temporarily housed in the aviaries of the
Hallstrom Fauna Trust in the mountains. Unlike most Paradise
Birds, which are shy, aloof cage-birds, the King of Saxony's becomes
very tame and confiding, and seems of a more alert and intelligent
disposition than its relatives.

The Avicultural Society of America has been reorganized, with
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9695338" page_id="56287920"  page_num="158" year="" vol="">
Mr. F. H. Rudkin, Senior, as President Emeritus, and Mr. Jean
Delacour as President. Such strong leadership augurs well for the
future of the Society, and the first issue of Aviculture , the journal of
the Society, edited by Mr. Ken Stott, Junior, is indicative of its
activity. The articles are on subjects ranging from " Peafowl " to
" Psittacidae feeding notes ", and there is no doubt that this magazine
will become more and more valuable. The issue under review opens
with a message from Mr. Delacour as follows :--
" Keeping birds in confinement is more than a delightful hobby
or a profitable enterprise. It is an art and a science. True to say,
nothing can be more enjoyable for a genuine bird lover than having
ready at hand, close to one's home, such beautiful and attractive
live objects to watch. It is a source of intense pleasure and constant
interest. Also, clever aviculturists, who devote all their skill and
patience to the care of their birds, can ordinarily propagate them
in such a way as to make their work pay. But aviculture has a higher
meaning.
" Behaviour studies are considered increasingly important by modern
biologists. Their significance is taking a higher and higher value
every day as are various experiments in genetics, which implies
aviculture. Field studies have greatly expanded during the last
three or four decades, and the techniques of bird watching in the
wilds have made considerable progress. Nevertheless, they seldom
can supply evidence so easily gained from birds that are living near
the observer, therefore at his disposal at all times.
" In aviaries that are properly planned and fitted, or at semi-
liberty in gardens and parks, the whole life cycle of a species can be
witnessed through every phase of its development, and detailed
records kept. Thus aviculture, when well understood, is one of the
best mediums for behaviour studies. It will reveal the bird's life,
including food, song, display, and reproductive habits, nests and eggs,
the laying rhythm, the growth of the chicks, their changes of plumage,
the parental care, and many other important points, many of them
still little or not at all known.
" Another special aim of aviculture is the maintenance by con-
trolled breeding of species threatened with extinction in their natural
haunts, either because of wanton persecution by men, or as a result
of the destruction of their necessary habitats. Such threats are more
serious to-day than ever before.
" All lovers of birds, who keep them in captivity in an intelligent

way, have a duty to perform, and that is to report their observations,
however commonplace they may sound to them. They are probably
much more original and valuable than they suspect them to be.
Surprisingly little has been published on the habits of the majority
of species which have been long kept and reared in aviaries. While
writing comprehensive works on birds, such as my recently completed
Pheasants of the World and The Waterfowl of the World , on which I am
now working, I continually come up against a complete lack of
information on the nests, eggs, incubation period, chicks, moults,
and various plumages of many species, some of which have con-
tinuously bred in captivity; A number of aviculturists possess a
complete knowledge of them, but they have neglected to record them.
" Here is where an Avicultural Society and its magazine come on
the scene. During the nineteenth century, most records were
registered in general periodicals on zoology, such as the Bulletin de la
Societe d'Acclimatation de France and the Proceedings of the Zoological
Society of London until, with the spread of the natural sciences
specialized journals came into being. The best of them and the only
one still existing to-day, has been the Avicultural Magazine, the
organ of the Avicultural Society of London. The wealth of informa-
tion, not only on bird keeping, but also on bird behaviour, to be
found within its 55 volumes published since 1894, is almost incredible.
" In 1929 an attempt was made to produce a similar publication
in America. Our magazine, Aviculture , started off brightly under the
clever editorship of the late C. T. Metzger. But bad luck soon came
to the Avicultural Society of America. Unforeseen financial com-
plications thwarted our efforts. We slowly got out of trouble, thanks
to the devotion of some of the members, particularly the late Andrew
Orear, and we made a new start which, although less ambitious,
nevertheless was successful. Under the able editorship of Mr. H.
Sedley, an interesting magazine was issued for many years. Personnel
difficulties, however, gradually interfered with our Editor's work, and
he finally had to reluctantly abandon his function.
" To-day we are trying to unite the efforts of all North American
aviculturists in an earnest endeavour to establish our Society on
a firm basis, and to publish a magazine of the high standard that
befits our great continent. We have succeeded in securing the services
of prominent personalities who are the qualified representatives of the
various branches of aviculture in the different parts of the United
States and Canada. The list of officers and directors speaks for itself.
All have promised their complete help.
"We now face the task of publishing regularly a good magazine
and of building up a large membership. We beg all members to send
to the Editor every year at the least, or better, every time they think
that they have something to report upon, an account of what is

happening in their aviaries. I can assure them that they will be
rewarded for their work and trouble ; during more than forty years
I have written about my live birds and those of others, and it has
given me a lot of fun. Don't be shy ; the Editor, and those who
help him, including myself, are perfectly ready and willing to help
with the redaction of notes and articles. But do give us the facts,
and tell us what your birds are doing, and what you are doing to
them. Do not hesitate to ask us questions ; our Secretary and Assistant
Secretary will answer them. Also please make your friends join--*
a large membership is an essential condition for success.
" More birds are now kept and reared in confinement in the New
World than in Europe, where our friends are working at present
under difficult conditions. Let us make good use of our stock, in
propagating it and, still more, in observing it. We owe it to ourselves
and to the world to publish a fine aviculture magazine which, while
entertaining and attractive, will be truly scientific ; anything is
scientific as long as it is accurate. Aviculture constitutes an important
branch of ornithology. Let us try to equal the old British Avicultural
Magazine ; and, who knows, we may even do better. We won't
compete with it, as there is plenty of public and plenty of potential
copy for both publications. Each journal can keep its readers
informed of what is happening across the Atlantic, while more
detailed accounts of special achievements can appear in their
respective parts of the world.
" I have been for many years an assiduous contributor to the
Avicultural Magazine, and I intend to remain one as long as I live.
But, at the same time, I have also contributed to Aviculture and to
other periodicals in Europe. Others can do the same thing. The
more that is written on aviculture, the more will follow, and our
beloved art and science will progress all the better."
It is certainly to be hoped that the closest and most friendly co-opera-
tion will be maintained between the two Societies and the two journals,
for as Mr. Delacour rightly says, there is plenty of scope for both.

(46) Sulphur-crested Cockatoo ( Kakatoe galerita )
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.988978081081081" page_id="56287923"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
Synonyms. --White Cockatoo, Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo.
Distribution. --The coastal belt of the continent, from St. Vincent's
Gulf in South Australia, round the south-eastern, eastern, and northern
seaboards as far as the Fitzroy River in the north-west of Western
Australia. It also follows the River Murray and its tributaries inland
for several hundred miles and, further, is found on King Island and in
Tasmania.
Description. --A large white Cockatoo with the inner webs of the flights
and tail feathers yellow, as also is the long crest. There is also a
suspicion of yellow on the ear coverts but it is never pronounced.
The beak is black and the bare skin round the eye is white. Males
are usually a little larger than females and invariably have an almost
black iris. Some females show a very obvious reddish-brown iris,
but I do not think this is a constant feature and I am uncertain whether
birds exhibiting it come from any particular district. Immatures
closely resemble adults, except for the light colour of the beak, which,
however, soon darkens.
Variations. --This bird shows remarkably little variation other than
in size throughout its extensive range. The closely allied Triton
Cockatoo of New Guinea is larger with a longer crest and very pale
blue skin round the eyes.
Coloured Plates. --These are singularly few in number, considering
that the bird is so well known. Roland Green's plate in Mathews
(vol. vi, p. 170) is very good, and the species is also figured in Lear's
Illustrations of Parrots (pi. 3) and in Reichenow (pi. 4, fig. 5).
Field Notes. --I have observed this species in several parts of both
South Australia and Victoria, and most recently in large flocks near
Naracoorte, in the former state. It is an extremely noisy bird and is
destructive to crops, but there is no gainsaying the beauty of the sight
of a dead tree covered by a flock of the birds.
Aviary Notes. --Very commonly kept as a cage bird in Australia,
birds taken from the nest being always in demand as pets and usually
making good talkers. Birds so treated are often very long-lived and are
almost invariably remarkably tame and gentle, seldom exhibiting
the desire to bite people which is only too evident with most of the other
species. However, the bird has one great disadvantage, its raucous
screech, and the number of these birds presented annually to the

Adelaide Zoo is evidence of this failing, as many of them are talented
talkers. In that institution they are all housed together in a large
flight aviary, which usually contains between forty and fifty birds,
and they agree quite amicably and constitute a great attraction to
visitors. Several birds in this aviary have laid eggs, but they do not
often remain in pairs as do most of the other members of the genus,
and it is difficult to pick out a mated pair with a view to their
segregation.
I have no record of this species having been bred in captivity in
Australia, although I consider that it is highly probable that it has
occurred. Abroad, it appears to have been bred on the Continent
during the last century and in England by Whitley, in a state of semi-
liberty, during World War I. There does not appear to be any record
as to whether both sexes incubate, but I should consider it probable
that they would.
I have owned a few of these birds for short periods, usually captured
strays, but they have never been kept for long on account of their vocal
propensities. There is no doubt that, apart from this failing, they make
attractive and entertaining pets.
(47) Leadbeater's Cockatoo (Kakatoe leadbeateri)
Synonyms. --Pink Cockatoo, Major Mitchell Cockatoo, Weejuggler,
Cocklerina.
Distribution. --A bird of the interior, occurring throughout most of
Western Australia except the south-west corner and the extreme north
of that state. Its range also extends through most of north-western
South Australia and down into the Murray Mallee and thence into
north-western Victoria. It is also found in western New South Wales
and south-western Queensland.
Description.-- The upper parts of this bird are white, whilst the face,
neck, and under-parts are pink, as also are the inner webs of the tail
and flight feathers. The long crest feathers are white at the tip,
followed successively by bars of red, yellow, and red. The adult
male has the iris a dark brownish-black, whilst in the female it is quite
a light reddish-brown colour. In addition the crest of the male contains
more red and less yellow. Immatures are only slightly duller than the
adults.
Variations. --Some adults exhibit a much brighter shade of pink
colouring on the breast than do others, but this does not appear
to be constant from any particular part of the bird's extensive range.
Coloured Plates. ---These are fairly numerous. Roland Green's in
Mathews (vol. vi, p. 190) well depicts a male of the highly coloured
variety and the plates by Lydon in Greene (vol. i, p. 13) and in

Russ' Speaking Parrots (p. 149) are both very good. Another adequate
plate is that by Boosey in Tavistock (p. 120).
Field Notes. --I have never seen this bird in the wild state. It is said
never to assemble in large flocks like the other members of its genus,
but to remain in small companies of a dozen or so birds. It is also said
that its range and that of the Bare-eyed Cockatoo practically never
overlap.
Aviary Notes. --Always rather a rare bird in captivity and although
extremely decorative, it is not as popular as the other Cockatoos
as it seldom becomes a talented speaker. It does not screech to any
great extent but it has an extremely irritating, plaintive, cry which it
utters frequently when alarmed. I have kept two of these birds during
my avicultural career, both being hens, and the most recent example
laid several times, but I have never had suitable aviary accommodation
to warrant trying to breed from them.
The species has been bred a number of times in captivity, both in
Australia and abroad, the first occasion apparently being by
Mrs. Johnstone in England in 1901. In South Australia the A.S.S.A.
medal was awarded in 1936 to Mr. R. F. Bedchambers, of Humbug
Scrub, for the first recorded breeding. His notes state that four eggs
were laid and that incubation commenced on 11 th September,
and that by nth October three young had hatched. In accordance
with other observers, he found that the male incubated by day and the
female by night and that both parents fed the young, the food provided
being mainly wheat, peas, green broad beans, almonds, and thistle.
Two young had left the nest by 8th December, the third young bird
not being reared.
The Adelaide Zoo succeeded in breeding the species in 1941, three
young being reared. That institution has found that, unlike the other
Cockatoos of the genus, this species cannot be kept in communities
and that two males will seldom live long in the same aviary without
one setting upon and eventually killing the other.
(48) Bare-eyed Cockatoo (Kakatoe sanguined)
Synonyms. --Little Corella, Blood-stained Cockatoo.
Distribution. --Mainly an interior bird and widely distributed through
northern and central Western Australia, Northern and Central
Australia, north-eastern South Australia, western Queensland, and
western New South Wales, and possibly northern Victoria. In South
Australia, it is also found along the creeks and rivers emptying into
the eastern sides of Spencer's and St. Vincent's Gulfs.
Description. --General colouring white, with yellow on inner webs of
flights and tail feathers and red bases to feathers of head, which show
most prominently on the lores. The crest is short and white and the

naked skin round the eyes is slaty-blue, being more extensive and more
prominent below the eye. The sexes show no appreciable difference
in the colour of the iris, but females are possibly a little smaller as
a rule. Immatures leave the nest with the naked skin round the
eye the same slaty-blue colour, but practically circular in shape ;
the normal adult configuration of this area rapidly develops. In all
other respects immatures are facsimiles of adults.
Variations. --None, apart from those of size, have been described
but the only two birds that I have seen that came from northern
Australia showed less red about the lores. The original birds described
and figured by Gould show the naked skin round the eye circular and
white in colour ; it seems possible that these may have been examples
of Goffin's Cockatoo from the Tenimber Islands.
Coloured Plates .--This Cockatoo has been neglected by bird artists.
There is, however, an excellent plate by Roland Green in Mathews
(vol. vi, p. 198) showing very clearly the difference between the adult
bird (lower figure) and the immature (upper figure). The species is
also figured in Reichenow (pi. 32, fig. 4).
Field Notes .--I have observed the small flock of this species living
in the vicinity of Buckland Park, some twenty miles north of Adelaide,
on many occasions, and have also seen the bird further north in this
state. It is not nearly as noisy a bird as the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo,
which is sometimes found in the same localities.
Aviary Notes .----A very common bird in captivity and one which has a
good reputation as a talker. I have never possessed an example of this
species but have watched them on many occasions in a large flight
aviary in the Adelaide Zoo, where they are kept together with several
other species of Cockatoos. The birds of this species usually keep in
pairs and appear most devoted to their mates ; I well remember one
bird which, when given a peanut, would immediately fly back to its
mate and allow it to take half of the nut.
The Bare-eyed Cockatoo nested successfully in the Zoo at Regent's
Park in 1907, and in the collection of Mr. F. E. Blaauw in Holland
in 1926 (vide Ibis , July, 1927). The only Australian success that
I am aware of is a very recent one, as late in 1949 two pairs nested in
the Adelaide Zoo. The first pair, which were segregated, hatched
their young but failed to rear them. The second pair nested in a log
in the large flight aviary previously referred to, containing some
thirty to forty various Cockatoos, and successfully reared one young
bird which left the nest in mid-January, 1950. Owing to the similarity
of the sexes, it is too difficult to be certain whether both birds incubate ;
in the case of the segregated birds, both were frequently in the nest
simultaneously. However, Blaauw records that only the female
incubated in the case of his pair of birds, but I consider that this
statement requires verification.

Synonyms. --Long-billed Cockatoo, Corella, Dampier's Cockatoo (the
western race).
Distribution. --This bird is found scattered through many parts of the
western district of Victoria and comes into the south-east of South
Australia in the vicinity of Naracoorte. It also occurs in the Riverina
district of New South Wales. The western form is confined to the south-
west corner of Western Australia, extending as far north as Geraldton.
Description. --The eastern form is a white Cockatoo with yellow inner
webs to the flights and tail feathers and with a very short white crest.
There is a considerable amount of pinkish-red about the base of the
crest, eyes, lores, and chin, and a well-marked crescent of the same
colour on the throat. The upper mandible is greatly elongated and
the naked skin around the eye is eccentric and bright blue in colour.
The iris is brownish-black in both sexes and there is no obvious
sexual difference that I am aware of. The immatures closely resemble
the adults but I am not able to say whether there is any variation in
the shape of the skin round the eye when they first leave the nest.
Variations. --The western form ( pastinator ) is, in my opinion, worthy
of specific rank. It differs from the eastern bird in that the red crescent
on the throat is lacking and there is considerably less red about the
head generally. The naked skin round the eye is slaty-blue and,
apart from the elongated mandible, it could easily be mistaken for a
somewhat large Bare-eyed Cockatoo, to which species I consider
it is more closely related.
Coloured Plates. --An excellent plate of the eastern bird is that by
Roland Green in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 214). In the same author's
Supplement to the Birds of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands (p. 24), there is a
plate by Frohawk of the western race but it shows the skin round the
eye of too light a shade of blue and makes the bird's plumage look very
dirty. There is also a fairly good plate of the eastern bird by Lydon
in Greene (vol. i, p. 27) and it is figured in Reichenow (pi. 4, fig. 7).
Field Notes. --I have not seen either form of this bird in the wild
state, although I recently spent an afternoon in the Naracoorte
district searching for them in places where they had been seen in
numbers only a week previously.
Aviary Notes. ---Always a rare bird in captivity in this state but more
plentiful in Western Australia and in New South Wales, the bird
shops in Sydney often having them for sale. It is said to make the best
talker of all the Cockatoos and also to be the most savage.
I have never possessed an example of either race of this rather ugly
bird but have often studied the specimens in the Adelaide Zoo, where,
there have been a fair number of examples of the eastern race in recent
years and but four of the western. Neither variety appears to me to

differ appreciably in its habits in captivity from the Bare-eyed
Cockatoo.
I do not know of any record of either variety having been bred in
captivity anywhere in the world, though it seems probable that such an
event may have occurred in some part of Australia and have never been
recorded.

inland areas and not often found close to the coast. The species appears
to be undergoing a cycle of expansion in South Australia and within
the last couple of decades it has colonized the more settled, southern
areas. Introduced accidentally to Tasmania.
Description. --The back, wings, rump, tail, and under tail-coverts
are grey, the head and short crest are a very pale pink and the breast
and abdomen are deep rose-red. The naked skin round the eye is a
pinkish-red and the iris in the male is brownish-black, and in the
female reddish-brown. Immatures are duller with the breast feathers
showing grey edges ; I think adult plumage is acquired at the age of a
few months.
Variations. --The birds found in Western Australia can be easily
distinguished by the deeper pink colouring of the head and crest.
There is also a good deal of individual variation in the depth of the
breast colouring in a number of birds from the same locality. A
mutation in which the grey colouring is replaced by white is very
beautiful and not very uncommon ; I have also seen another mutation
in which the grey colour is retained but the pink is replaced by white.
Coloured Plates. --The plate by Roland Green which formed the cover
of Avicultural Magazine (Jubilee Number, May, 1935) is excellent.
The same artist's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 225) is also very good
of the Western Australian race. Lydon's plate in Greene (vol. i,
p. 21) makes the underparts much too vivid a red. The species is also
figured by Rutledge in Cassell's Book of Birds (p. 427), and in Reichenow
(pi. 12, 3).
Field Notes. --This bird is nowadays very common in the suburbs
of Adelaide and roosts in trees in the parklands surrounding the city.
There are few more beautiful sights than a flock of these birds, but they
are a serious menace in agricultural areas and also take a heavy toll
in almond orchards.
Aviary Notes. --This is a very common cage bird throughout Australia,
although it seldom makes a very good talker. It is, however, the least
offensive of the genus as regards screaming. I have possessed several
birds of this species at different times but have never attempted to
breed them.

The first breedings of this Cockatoo appear to have occurred in 1922
in both England and France ; since that date it has been bred on a
number of occasions abroad. The A.S.S.A. deemed the Galah
ineligible for its medal, presumably because it was known to have been
bred in South Australia. In October, 1937, a lady, who was not a
member of the Society, wrote to the Secretary stating that a pair of
Galahs in her possession had hatched four young birds, but there is
no record as to whether they were reared. Both parents incubated
in this case.
In the Adelaide Zoo Galahs were successfully reared in 1940 in a
large flight aviary containing a number of Cockatoos of several
species and they have been bred there subsequently. They do well
in communities in association with other members of the family.

By E. N. T. Vane
The unique collection of birds at Cleres have often been described
in the past by individual visitors. It was not until this year, however,
that any organized visit by the Society was attempted when our
Secretaries and Editor undertook and carried out most successfully
a task which would have dismayed lesser mortals. On the principle
that what is worth doing at all is worth doing well, a most interesting
if very full week-end was planned to include a trip into Paris to inspect
the bird market, the Vincennes Zoo, and the Zoo in the Jardin des
Plantes ; two most delightful dinners were arranged, at which conti-
nental aviculturists from France and Belgium met those from Great
Britain, the size of which was curtailed by the limited accommodation
available in the village. The British contingent consisted of Miss Barclay-
Smith, Miss Bonner, Mr. B. Chadwick, Mr. B. Dulanty, Dr. E.
Hindle, Mr. F. Grant, Mr. G. T. lies, Mr. P. Maxwell, Mr. G. S.
Mottershead, Mr. A. A. Prestwich, and Mr. E. N. T. Vane.
Meeting at Victoria on Saturday morning, the party proceeded via
Newhaven to Dieppe, reaching Cleres by private coach about teatime.
Embarkation took place with an air of a school outing ; teacher
asked everyone how much pocket money he had, then explained that
we must keep our sixpences to spend on the way back and must not
spend more than one shilling in French money whilst in France ; to
give the officials their due they were very polite and efficient in
carrying out their irritating task. Being on a French boat we were
at last able to enjoy one of those continental feasts about which we
had heard so much from the lucky people who now travel to the
continent annually for their vacation. A sardine, a piece of cold

sausage, one slice of indifferent salami and a lettuce leaf comprised
the hors d'oeuvre, followed by an anaemic slice of beef, some wet
greenfood, and a spoonful of greasy dehydrated potato, rounded off
with some tasteless cheese ! ! ! What a repast, and what a disillusion-
ment. I am convinced you can get meals in England as good as any
you can obtain in the world if you are prepared to pay the price.
There is no need to travel for that, although the meals we had in
France were very appetising, and there were no annoying restrictions
or rationing, if I were making the Newhaven-Dieppe crossing again,
I would most certainly take some sandwiches.
Why our conveyance from Dieppe to Cleres was known as an
Isobloc luxury coach I have not yet discovered. To the average
Englishman it was a third-rate charabanc with hard seats and no rest
for the head, to an American it could only have been a truck. The
driver was very capable, if his technique was a little crude. Once
started, his foot went down as far as possible and the horn--one
of those ear-piercing pip-pip things so dear to the heart of the Parisian
taxi driver--was in constant operation, which was in fact electrical
in action.
On arrival at Cleres, after a preliminary tour of the park, we dined
with the French and Belgian aviculturists, many of whom are well
known at the dinners of the Avicultural Club in London. From
Belgium there were Madame J. Derscheid and Monsieur J. P.
Derscheid, Monsieur Max Elsen, President of the Societe Royale de
Zoologie d'Anvers, and Mademoiselle Therese Elsen, with Monsieur
Walter Van den bergh the Director, and Madame Van den bergh,
Monsieur G. Danhier, President of the Cercle Ornithologique de Bel-
gique, and Madame Danhier, Colonel Dufour, Monsieur W. Friling,
Monsieur Jan Jacobs, Monsieur Raymaekers, and Madame Malisoux,
with two members of the recently re-formed O.P.S. Dr. P. G. van
Tienhoven from Holland was also present. Monsieur Delacour, in
welcoming the representatives of the three nations present, said how
happy he was to be able to receive them at Cleres again. Monsieur
Danhier replied for the Belgian aviculturists, Miss Barclay-Smith,
speaking on behalf of the British, paid tribute to the great work of
Mr. Fooks in re-establishing the collection at Cleres, and Dr. van
Tienhoven stressed the value of international gatherings.
The leisurely meal continued for several hours, and it was evident
that the food, the wine, and the company were all good. It is very
apparent that there is a strong following in Belgium to-day, many of
whom have good collections of all kinds of birds.
Although we sat late over dinner, an early start was made on
Sunday morning. At one hotel the French could not have been all
that was desired as the party was aroused at five o'clock in mistake
for six. After a continental breakfast of coffee and rolls, to which

after considerable effort a " couple of oeufs " were added, we started
off in the luxury coach for Paris. Despite the hour, the horn received
the same use as before, possibly the driver was afraid of overcharging
his batteries, and decided to provide a safety valve through the hooter.
One thing that was noticeable was that the French people were up
much earlier on Sunday than most people over here, and moreover
they were all hard at work : their Unions cannot be nearly so effective
as ours.
Passing up the Seine valley the scenery was varied and interesting,
war damage could be seen in most towns and at bridges, particularly
in Rouen, but Nature had quickly obliterated most scars in the
countryside. After a brief halt in Vernon, we continued our journey
straight into the Paris bird market.
Hopes of acquiring a few birds out of the usual were not realized,
none were on view that are unobtainable in this country, since
importations have been permitted once more. There were a number
of stalls spaciously arranged with a general air of cleanliness sadly
lacking in our own counterpart. All the cages were clean, but the size
of the boxes in which most of the birds were displayed would have
earned a multitude of stripes for an enthusiastic inspector of the
R.S.P.C.A. Prices were much the same as those ruling here too.
Starting with Red-eared Waxbills at 400 francs a pair, there were
many Senegals ranging from this figure up to 1,600 francs, approxi-
mately 8^. to 35^. One unfamiliar bird among these was a Blue-billed
Fire Finch, other exhibits included Pekin Robins, Glossy Starlings,
a few Zebras, one or two American Buntings, and an odd Cuban
Tanager, probably the only bird not obtainable here at present.
Definitely a disappointment as a market, but it saved our precious
francs.
The Vincennes Zoo is most compact and well planned. The
animals are displayed in artificially constructed " natural surround-
ings " separated from the public only by moats or ditches. The
houses or sleeping quarters are enclosed in what appear to be huge
masses of rock, so large that many of these buildings are more com-
modious that large areas are set apart for the public to enter and see
the inmates inside. The interiors are very well lit from skylights,
they are also provided with excellent heating and ventilating systems
where required, and the light is nearly always arranged to show the
animals to advantage and leave the visitors in the shadier parts where
they are least disturbing. The construction has been executed most
artistically, the rocks look the genuine article, only close inspection
revealing that it is rendered concrete.
A feature of this Zoo is a very tall rock several hundred feet in
height, in which an express lift conveys passengers to the top for
5 francs, or 10 francs return ; presumably one is given the choice of

walking down the hundreds of steps inside or throwing oneself off the
top if only five francs are available. The panorama of Paris and the
Eiffel Tower from the top is magnificent, one could look down also
on the well-planned Zoo, and appreciate the clever use that has
been made of the artificial rocks to conceal the enclosed quarters
of the houses.
Some of the party were in favour of making the ascent before lunch,
but others preferred to wait until afterwards before rising to such
dizzy heights, considering the time that had passed since our scanty
breakfast it was a wise precaution. There was much to see of great
interest in this Zoo, and some lagged behind, reluctant to leave
which rather curtailed our visit to the Jardin des Plantes. This
though perhaps considered more " old fashioned 55 than the Vincennes
Zoo, has a great charm and a most excellent collection of birds.
Breeding success is at a high level, for many birds particularly the
geese and ducks, were nesting.
On return to Cleres in the evening a further dinner was
held, in which, to the great pleasure of all, Mrs. Benchley, the
Director of the San Diego Zoo, joined. Mrs. Benchley is so well
known by name to many members of the Avicultural Society, that it
was greatly appreciated by those present to be able to meet her
personally. At this dinner speeches were made by the youngest
members of each contingent, M. J. P. Derscheid speaking on behalf
of the Belgians and Mr. G. T. lies for the British--Dr. van Tienhoven
said that being over seventy he was delighted to be able to claim
that he was the youngest, as he was the only, representative of Holland
present.
The following morning--our last---was devoted to a proper inspec-
tion of the Park at Cleres, under the very kind guidance of M. Delacour,
Mr. Fooks, and his daughter. Obviously, the Chateau was chosen
with great care for its purpose. Situated in a secluded wooded valley
completely surrounded by trees, and containing many paddocks with
gently sloping southern aspects, a river and ornamental lake, copses
and coverts all combine to provide ideal natural conditions for birds.
The design of the enclosure boundaries has been so skilfully evolved
that there is a permanent impression of viewing the birds in a perfectly
natural state, all are an integral part of the background. Chilian and
European Flamingoes stalk gracefully through the shallows of the
lakes, Cranes--Crowned, Demoiselle, Sarus, and Australians dance
on the lawns. Innumerable geese and duck--swans too--ornament
the lakes and water, and in spite of their numbers each species appears
to have sufficient space to avoid others and no overcrowding is
apparent where natural pugnacity might lead to disaster in confined
conditions. The river has been partitioned to provide enclosures for
some pairs, but so cleverly have the boundaries been camouflaged

that no netting is visible at a casual glance. There were Black Swans
also Black-necked Swans. Snow Geese, Red-breasted, Barnacle,
White-fronted, Bar-headed, and several others, three Sheld-Duck,
Muscovies, and over a score of surface feeding and diving duck.
Emus, Rheas, Peafowl, and Turkeys paraded the paddocks through
which visitors passed without disturbing the birds or even noticing
that their freedom was controlled in any way. In addition to all the
commoner Ornamental Pheasants, specimens still survive of such
rarities as Bels, Mikado, Elliots, Cheers, also Firebacks, Monals,
Tragopans, Grossoptilons, and Peacock Pheasants in the breeding
pens beyond the formal aviaries. These are situated close to the
Chateau in a beautifully kept garden surrounded by yew hedges and
trees. Of steel structure, they have lasted well, but like most of our
own aviaries are in need of general overhaul when materials become
available once more. Among the many birds housed in these flights,
I noticed pairs of Kings, Crimsonwings, Princess of Wales, Mealy
Rosellas, several Lovebirds and Budgerigars, a number of Doves,
Pigeons, and Quail, several species of Starling, Wydahs, Weavers,
Finches and Waxbills, etc. Returning to the Chateau, one passes
along a tree sheltered walk along one side of which is a continuous
range of perches for Macaws and Cockatoos, its present occupiers
were Blue and Yellows and Red and Blue Macaws. On the other
hand a pair of Amazons shared an aviary with a small Senegal Parrot.
Immediately adjoining the house itself were a few Owls kept and
several Budgerigars still breed behind the site where the tropical
flights used to be. Birds are not the only inhabitants of the Park,
however, there are several monkeys, wallabies, deer, and other
mammals, not many cats were in evidence though.
Before closing these notes, I would like to express the appreciation
of all concerned for the efforts of Mr. Prestwich and Miss Bonner, and
of Miss Barclay-Smith, M. Delacour, and Mr. Fooks for arranging
and organizing the week-end. The weather was most kind, only during
the night of the first evening did we experience any rain, and in Paris
it was really hot, the crossings were also delightful both ways apart
from the food and the unfortunate sequel when some of the party
went sightseeing in Dieppe and returned to the quay to see the boat
well away.
Finally, it was some thirty years ago that Jean Delacour having lost
his home and extensive avicultural and zoological collection in the
1914-18 war, courageously set about the creation of an ideal. Twenty
years of patient endeavour resulted in the largest and most valuable
collection of rare Pheasants, Waterfowl, and other birds in the world
being established under utopian conditions, only to be dispersed once
again, first by the disastrous fire in 1938, and finally by another enemy
invasion. What we were able to see remaining of this magnificent

effort therefore, in 1950, speaks volumes for the tenacity and courage
of M. Delacour--a case most aptly envisaged by Kipling :--
If you can dream--and not make dreams your master,
If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat these two imposters just the same ;
If you can hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools :

By Dr. Maurice Amsler
I feel convinced that I am the doddery old gentleman Mr. Edward
Boosey had in mind when he gave us the very interesting notes on
Keston in the current January-February issue. There are several
articles in this number which recall the past, so will you kindly afford
me space over which I may " pore ".
First, may I congratulate Mr. Vane not only on his notable success,
which in better times would probably have brought him a medal in
silver, but more especially on his detailed and well-written description
of his Macaws' breeding.
The Society's Medal was first issued in order to promote knowledge
in ornithology not as a bait to be a " first-timer " in breeding any
species--rare or common.
Of late years there has been a sad falling off of notes on breeding
results, doubtless this is partly due to a shortage of young stocks
(Methusalahs cannot be expected to reproduce their species), but when
a success is attained we should surely have something more than the
bald facts that the birds built, laid, and brought off their young in
a certain number of days or weeks. The picture of seven Noble
Macaws all flying together takes me back to the year 1916 when
I bought a pair of winning Red Rosellas from the late John Frostick.
The following spring they were given a small aviary only 12 feet long
by 3 feet deep--this included a shelter 3 feet by 3 feet. The first
clutch consisted of ten eggs all of which hatched. At the advice of
the then Marquess of Tavistock I provided a second nest box when
the young were about three weeks old. The hen soon took to this and
left the cock to finish off the chicks, ten of which shortly appeared.
The poor cock had the job of feeding this huge family and also the
hen who was now on seven eggs. These all hatched out and grew rapidly

so that by the end of the season I had nineteen Rosellas flying about
in a little 12 ft. aviary. They were certainly not Noble Macaws, but
they were a gorgeous sight.
The next year only seven were reared and after that I parted with
them to Madame Lecallier, near Rouen, where they never attempted
to breed at all ; the same thing happened to a pair of Swainson's
Lorikeets which I sold to her.
These birds are worthy of a note on account of their perpetual
breeding.
They also came to me in 1916 and tried to breed that winter in
a store cage in which they were first housed.
There was no nonsense about their feeding. No canary seed, of
course ; a war was on, and one could not get much sugar or honey,
bananas or grapes. In fact, they got none of these luxuries. Their
daily diet then and for the next two years was two tablespoonsful of
ground rice mixed with boiling milk, to which I added a lump of
" honey-sugar ", a by-product of Garton's in the manufacture of
sugar.
In the spring they were given the aviary next to the Rosellas--
this was equally narrow but 15 feet long. Two large nest-boxes were
provided and were immediately inspected, both were used in turn.
To cut a long story short, the hen laid her two eggs with the utmost
regularity and almost always hatched both.
She soon tired of her babies, left them to her spouse, and laid in
the other box. As far as I can remember the young left the nest at
about four weeks and so this went on month after month the whole
year round for two years. I have records of 14 and 20 degrees of frost
which seemed to have no effect whatever on parents or young. That
my diet suited the birds is proved by the fact that the chicks on leaving
the nest were always very large and well feathered. In a few days
they would only be distinguishable from the adults by a slight dullness
in the colour of their beaks.
A reference to my old notes has just reminded me what delightful
pets these Lorikeets make. It was always difficult to walk out of the
aviary without one or more sitting on one's shoulder as they do not
like being held in one's hands when lifted off, but one couple which
I hand-reared would have fascinated any lover of birds.
I could walk anywhere with them on my shoulder, where they
constantly chattered and very gently nibbled my ears. It was, in fact,
almost impossible to get rid of them when it was time to return to the
aviary.
These " honey-feeders ", however, have a great drawback in that
they are so messy, and anyone keeping a tame pair should always
wear a suit of overalls !
There was one mystery about all my Lorikeets which I never

fathomed. Do they ever moult ? When clearing out the aviary a few
odd feathers were usually to be seen but nothing more, and there was
never a day when they could not have won a first prize, at any rate,
for condition.
Possibly their love of water was one reason for their immaculate
plumage, for they had a 3 ft. long zinc bath quite 8 inches deep in
which their behaviour was that of otters rather than of birds.
They would perch at one end of the bath as soon as it was filled,
dive right under water, and emerge at the other end ; this would be
repeated two or three times, after which they would stop in the middle,
where, in fact, they were out of their depths, and have a tremendous
splash, then by a great effort they would fly to the nearest perch.
As they were almost amphibious it was always necessary to empty
this bath before dusk.
Why is it such a pleasure to watch one's birds taking a thorough
bath ? After the departure of the Swainsons I went in for a pair of
King Parrakeets. The hen caused me considerable annoyance by
behaving like a broody fowl in that she persisted in sitting in a scrape
on the floor of the shelter and would not look at either of the two
nest-boxes so beloved by the Lorikeets. Finally, she laid one egg on
the ground, which was broken. After this I built her a sort of tunnel
by means of a bent piece of corrugated iron fixed in place by a few
bricks with a good supply of peat-moss for a nest. She soon laid a full
clutch, and reared two young; at the end of the season she produced
two more.
Having achieved my aim in rearing this species which in those days
was not commonly bred, I am ashamed to say I sold them to our
President, but in self defence I must say that he absolutely refused
them as a gift. Many of us have to thank him for his advice, help,
and generosity, but I feel sure that I must stand high in the list of
those who remember his kindness with gratitude.
It was, in fact, thanks to Mr. Ezra's advice that the Zoological
Society presented me with a pair of the much coveted Blue Robins,
of which I have written so much and so often ; even now when
I have no collection I still long for those days when I could see one
or even two pairs of these quite exquisite birds flying loose in my
garden. A reference by Mr. Boosey to sprouted seed takes me back
to the Budgerigar boom in 1924. I think it was I who originally
discovered the value of sprouting seed in the avoidance of rickets,
French moult, and such horrors. I well remember my annoyance
when a big breeder of Budgerigars to whom I had imparted this
method of feeding published it a month or two later as his own
discovery. It no doubt gained him some publicity and an added
share of customers, though the latter were more a nuisance than an
acquisition in those boom days, when it was difficult to keep a few

breeding pairs for oneself. I was constantly pestered by dealers, many
of them Japs, who seemed to have bottomless purses.
My best achievement was #120 for a pair of Cobalts, then known
as " Royal Blues ", and in the course of three years I made a clear
profit of nearly two thousand pounds after paying all Mr. Allen
Silver's seed bills for my rather large collection of birds, my fowls,
and even my dog foods.
Many of my avicultural friends were inclined to sneer at me for
commercializing our science--but after all, the breeding of budgies
is hardly aviculture, to my mind it is merely a fancy, like the keeping
of Canaries, fancy mice, and such like, and it was not only exhilarating
but rather fun to feel one was able to earn a considerable income at
the cost of a few minutes' attention each day. The man who had
five or six pairs of blues in 1924 was lucky.
As is well known, most of these birds went to Japan, and it was not
long before the Japanese flooded our market with blues and other
colours of their own production.
Most were cage-bred wretched specimens, and the influx from the
East was quickly discouraged.
There is one more point in your number I should like to refer to and
that is the question raised by Mr. Hampe on the use of live ants' eggs.
All ants, from the microscopical blacks to the large brown wood-ant
contain or carry formic acid; the word, in fact, is derived from the
Latin word formica, an ant.
When an ant bites you I believe it injects a little formic acid by
means of its jaws or biting apparatus. You have only to sit on a nest
of the small red ant to prove this, its bite is just as painful as that of
the much larger wood ant.
From a fairly long experience I do not think that the swallowing of
formic acid is in the least toxic to even the callow nestling, rather
I should say that it is a good tonic. Ants' eggs, chiefly the large
variety, have been used almost to the exclusion of all other live foods
in my aviaries during the summer months, and I have never observed
any ill-effects from their use.
Gallinaceous birds, softbills of the Order Turdus and most of the
hardbills which feed insects to their young, prefer them to anything--
except perhaps the mealworm, whose tough carapace makes them a
danger to the more delicate birds. Golden Orfe and goldfish go mad
if given a handful of fresh ants' cocoons. The dried ants' egg is
probably of no value whatsoever. The late W. E. Teschemaker,
probably the ablest ever of our breeders, looked upon dried ants' eggs
as mere roughage in the preparation of soft food, and finally used
the husks of white millet instead.
My friends probably, and my enemies of a certainty, will think
that I have pored enough. With this opinion I entirely concur.

E. BOOSEY-A TAME TRAGOPAN
A TAME TRAGOPAN
By Edward Boosey
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99898880952381" page_id="56287940"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
In the autumn of 1948 I purchased from Leckford a young pair of
Temminck's Tragopans. They arrived in excellent condition, but
after a few weeks the cock suddenly went lame and was found to be
suffering from Bumblefoot, one of its feet swelling to an enormous
size. I had the vet, who recommended a hot antiphlogistine poultice,
renewed daily, and this we managed to do, though it was an extremely
difficult and messy business. The result was not entirely satisfactory
because, though it seemed to some extent to arrest the swelling, it
did not cure it.
Eventually it was decided to try penicillin, injected straight into
the swollen ball of the foot, and with really miraculous results, recovery
being rapid and so complete that now you would never know that
the bird had ever had anything wrong with its foot.
The second piece of bad luck with the Tragopans was the escape
of the hen. She was quite tame, and one morning when I opened
the door to feed them she stepped out of the aviary and went into
some bushes close by. I knew she would be anxious to get back to
the food, so I hurriedly--too hurriedly as it turned out--wedged back
the door, which was on a spring, and retreated. The hen went back
and was about to re-enter the aviary when the wedge slipped and the
door swung to, frightening her so that she took flight and soared
away across the valley. That was the last I saw of her, and as the
corn round here was being cut that day, and there was a lot of shooting
going on, I have little doubt that--horrible thought--she ended up
" in the pot ".
When the cock had fully moulted out into adult plumage I gave him
a hen Amherst Pheasant to keep him company, and he was absolutely
thrilled with her--though not she with him ! Actually I think she
was rather frightened of his display, so different from the caperings of
a male of her own kind, and which reminds one of the defence tactics
of an Indian Puffer fish, since both look as though they were being
slowly blown up with a bicycle pump !
The Tragopan, I suppose by gradually fluffing out each feather,
certainly ends by looking quite twice his normal size, and as this is
accompanied by a slow and measured " goose-step ", and various
strange crackling sounds--produced from I know not where inside the
bird--the result is certainly rather sinister. So much so that the small
daughter of one of our customers who happened to see the Tragopan
displaying, clung to her mother and said : " Oh, Mummy, what
a horrid horrid bird ! " and burst into tears and had to be hurried
away by her parent !
The hen Amherst laid and incubated two infertile clutches, but as

she now seems as pleased with the Tragopan as he is with her, the
coming breeding season might produce some rather unique hybrids.
The Tragopan, besides his great beauty--incidentally, I am sure
the designers of some of the lovelier oriental carpets must have found
their inspiration in the exquisite pattern of his back, wings, and tail--
is a most charming bird, and extraordinarily tame, sometimes even
allowing me to stroke him, though I don't think he really likes being
touched.
Although my Golden and Amherst Pheasants are tame, in so far as
they have quite lost any sense of fear, theirs is an impersonal tameness,
and quite different from the Tragopan's. In his case he always does
a semi-display to greet me when I go to feed him, and pays me the
further compliment of obviously thinking me more important than the
immediate matter of food. He adores fruit of all kinds and has a passion
for Snowberries. He will eat a few from the palm of my hand ; display
a little ; then--since he apparently loves to imagine himself in sudden
acute danger--rush away, head down, and hide, motionless, behind
a bush. After which he comes cautiously back, and finishes his meal
of Snowberries from the palm of my still patiently-outstretched hand !

One is inclined to wonder if Mr. Ezra and the Clerk of the Weather
have a common interest, and if that interest be the invitation to Fox-
warren Park which our President so generously extends to members
yearly. It has been remarked on before that the aforementioned
C. of W. smiles on this annual gathering, and Saturday, ioth June,
was no exception. Thus it was with a certain amount of relief that
the party travelling by coach (again thoughtfully provided by
Mr. Ezra) boarded the vehicle at Hyde Park Corner and settled down
to enjoy the slight breeze created as the journey proceeded. Apparently
the lifting of petrol restrictions was the signal to those members
owning cars to attend, for quite a number were present by the time
the coach drew up outside the house. As may be expected, our host
was at the door to greet us and appeared to have remained in just
that same spot since farewells were said on the last occasion. After
brief exchanges a short but enjoyable interval was spent on the terrace
overlooking the Surrey countryside, a view so often commented upon

but ever fresh and lovely to the visitor, and one cannot but envy the
owner of a house set amid such glorious surroundings.
The tour of the enclosures at last commenced, and escorted by our
host, a visit was first paid to the Crane paddocks. Here a fine pair
of Japanese White-necked Cranes provided interest, having nested
once again this year. A half-grown youngster in apparent good health
was carefully looked after by the parents, and during the attendant's
attempts to drive the family nearer to the fence for close inspection,
the one adult bird gave a remarkable exhibition of injury-feigning to
divert attention from the young bird. A number of Stanleys were
seen in the adjoining pen, and one cannot but marvel at the exquisite
" bloom " that covers the plumage of this species. Making their way
to the main concentration of aviaries the party again had the oppor-
tunity of seeing the well-known favourites which by now may well
be called indigenous to Foxwarren. The Lutino Ringnecks are still
in evidence, together with some fine examples of Queen Alexandra's,
both species being long established in Mr. Ezra's collection. The
beautiful white Rothschild's Grackle was represented by at least three
specimens in first-rate condition, and an exceptionally tame Black-
winged Grackle caused great interest by perching on the attendant's
hand and allowing itself to be fondled, at the same time uttering a
rather mournful tune and closing its eyes in apparent ecstasy.
Although a number of other species were represented here, it was at
the same time sad to find so many enclosures still untenanted, and
now that a trickle of foreigners are coming into the country, we look
forward to the day when Mr. Ezra's collection is again the foremost
in these islands.
Leaving these aviaries the party proceeded through the woods
towards the waterfowl ponds, admiring as they did so the lovely
rhododendrons now in full bloom. En route the herd of Blackbuck
was observed in the distance, and numerous Wallabies were also
encountered. The waterfowl attracted quite a lot of attention,
although a number of birds persisted in seeking shelter in the bushes.
Members then viewed two magnificent pairs of Specifer Peafowl in
adjoining enclosures. The one female was sitting, whilst the other
had a nice clutch, but had not yet commenced her domestic duties,
and we hope to hear encouraging results later on, for there are only
one or two other representatives of this species in the country. Our
old friend George Beever (who is perhaps the foremost authority on
Ornamental Pheasants and Peafowl in this country) and the writer
were soon discussing the merits of these birds, points mentioned
including the brilliant colouring, upright bearing, and prominent
crest. Mr. Ezra's birds belong to the Indo-Chinese form and differ
from the Javan by the larger size and the lack of the golden patch on
the lower back. Other birds of the same family then caught the eye,

and so steps were directed towards them. A White Peahen with two
chicks exhibited concern at our near approach, and so after a briei
study we retraced our steps to the Blue Grossoptilons housed near by.
By this time the main party had vanished, so, passing a fine Silver
cock and an Ashy-headed Goose we hurried in their wake, alarming
as we did so a number of Muntjac. Before leaving the park, two
Wallabies were noticed carrying young in their pouches, a quaint
and amusing scene for the English countryside.
Whilst taking a rest on the terrace, the melodious song of a Blackcap
charmed the company from a nearby rhododendron bush, and a
female Chukor Partridge with chicks was seen crossing the greensward.
All too soon it was time to say farewell to Foxwarren, and so with
expressions of gratitude to our host the coach was boarded. It only
remains to place on record our thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Ezra for their
hospitality, and to the staff at Foxwarren, both indoor and outdoor,
for taking on what must have been a considerable amount of extra
duties.

Members of the Club, 37 ; guests, 32 ; total, 69.
The Chairman, opening the meeting, said there were so many
notable guests present he would not refer to them individually, but
would confine himself to welcoming them collectively. He would,
however, like to extend a special welcome to the guest of the Club,
Mr. E. J. L. Hallstrom, President of the Taronga Zoological Park
Trust. Mr. Hallstrom, an honoured member of the Society, was
well known to all members, and needed no introduction.
Mr. Hallstrom then described briefly his efforts on behalf of
aviculture in Australia, and assured his audience he was anxious to
do anything possible to help British aviculturists.
The first film, Animal Oddities , showed an aviary containing some
sixty Black Cockatoos, mostly Banksian, but also a few Palm, being
hand-fed : a home-bred baby Banksian and parents : baby Red and
Yellow Macaws and parents : rare albinos, Koalas and Kangaroo :
Tasmanian Echidna, and the very rare Thylacine.

in New Guinea and being welcomed by Mr. Hallstrom, prior to
visiting his Zoological Gardens and Livestock Station. Ten thousand
tribesmen took part in the welcome, and Mr. Hallstrom pointed out
that almost without exception at least one Bird of Paradise formed
part of each head-dress.
The speaker referred to the conservation work being done by Fred
Shaw Mayer, made easier by the fact that he was greatly respected
and trusted by the natives. There was just a possibility of there being
a yet undiscovered Bird of Paradise, a white bird, and an expedition
was shortly being sent to search for it.
Finally, Mr. Hallstrom described the daily routine of his aviaries.
He stressed the necessity of absolute cleanliness, and gave the methods
adopted to avoid contamination of any kind. Breeding procedure and
rearing foods were dealt with. Mr. Hallstrom was quite prepared to
answer questions indefinitely, but owing to the lateness of the hour
the Chairman had, perforce, to call the meeting to a close. Thanking
Mr. Hallstrom for his kindness in showing the films and for giving
such a very interesting and instructive talk, the Chairman said no
one could fail to benefit by the sound, practical advice given. The
large audience showed by its warm applause that it had greatly
appreciated Mr. Hallstrom's discourse.

J. Bruyneel, Steynockerzeel, Belgium, has recently received a pair
of blue Quaker Parrakeets from Argentina.
" Bush's Bird and Sports Store," Auburn, N.S.W., write : " We
still have the Parrots that Mr. Dave Bush refers to as Many-colour x
Blue-bonnet ( A.M ., 1950, 139). In this, however, he is mistaken, as
they are Blue-bonnet X Redrump. They are very colourful, with a
very red breast, and are about the size of the Blue-bonnet. We did
not breed these ourselves, but bought them from a customer who
breeds quite a few at Mudgee, N.S.W."
F. Shaw Meyer writes from Lae, New Guinea : "I am writing
from camp on the northern slopes of the Bismarck Range with Mount
Wilhelm (15,400 feet) just behind. I have a nice number of Black
Cockatoos, one King of Saxony Bird of Paradise, two cages of Good-
fellow's Parrot Finches ; and, in a makeshift enclosure, a young
Harpyopsis novaguinea. This is the first living specimen of the New
Guinea Harpy Eagle I have had or seen. It is a lovely bird, quite
tame and fearless, and will eventually go to Taronga Park."
Edward Boosey reports an interesting event at Keston : " We have
at last managed to get a cock Amazon to mate to a hen bred here in
1939, and although they have only one young one, it is certainly the
first second generation aviary-bred young Blue-front to be hatched
in this country. I am surprised they had any fertile eggs, what with
the cold weather and the fact that the cock has not been here long
and was extremely cage-cramped when he arrived.
" We already have some quite nice young broods fledged of lutino
Ringnecks, Turquoisines, Roseate Cockatoos, Rosellas, and Red-
rumps."
James Rooney writes from Washington : "I recently visited Don
Martin at Auburn. He has quite a collection of waterfowl, including
about forty Black Swans (several pairs were nesting), Black-necked
Swans, Whistling Swans, Mandarins, Wood Ducks, Emus, a Cereopsis
Goose, etc. He sold his fine pair of Whooper Swans because they
were too much for him. I saw a most interesting hybrid in his collec-
tion, a drake Wood Duck by American Wigeon, a beautiful bird.
" It may interest you to know that the pair of captive Whooping
Cranes at the Aransas National Wildfowl Refuge, near Corpus Christi,
Texas, recently laid an egg and hatched a baby Crane, which un-
fortunately did not survive for long."

foster disrupting the nest of eight eggs.
" However, a pair of Red-vented Bulbuls have hatched three out oi

still being fed by their parents.
" A pair of Red-faced Lovebirds laid five eggs which I put under a

and was old I was surprised to find four fertile. Two have hatched to

" Indian Black Partridges, wild, and I do not expect any luck with
them.
" Bob White Quail not nesting yet due to want of proper under-

C. af Enehjelm, Helsingfors, Finland, sends his latest breeding
results : " We have had a very cold and wet spring, so all my birds
are still inside. I have had some few breeding results up to now.
Best are the Green-backed Parrotlets, imported birds : pair I has
seven youngsters out in the first clutch (is that not something of a
record?). Pair II even has two out of the nest, so I can now put
some young unrelated pairs together. Pair I last year hatched
thirteen in three nests. The Blue-backed species has not done anything
up to now.
" Magpie Mannakins (A. jringilloides) five youngsters in first nest,
now almost in full colour, and have five young again. Firefinch two
out, Indian Silverbill two also ; Plumhead with young in the nest.

with ten and nine eggs respectively. On 20th May, one left the nest
with three chicks, rather weak ones. There were fully-developed
chicks in the other eggs, but they died as the hen left the nest too soon.
In the afternoon all the chicks lay on the floor apparently dead, but
profiting from previous experience, I picked them up and put them
under an electric bulb, where they recovered in a few hours.

much stronger from the start. Two, however, managed to get chilled
and lay as though dead, so I put them in the foster-mother. All eleven
are now thriving on egg-food, dried ant ' eggs 5 , blue moon, milksop
and germinated millet, with, now and then, very small mealworms.
I am very hopeful of them. The parents were all bred by me from
three different pairs.
" I have, of course, bred many Budgerigars, Bengalese, with which
I am working on the heredity problem, and Zebra Finches. I am
expecting cinnamon and fawn Zebras. I have besides the normal,
white, pied, and a silver cock. I hope to be able to tell you of further
results during the summer. Incidentally, I still have two young Great
Eagle-Owls which are doing well."
What are you doing to increase membership ?
An increase in the number of members means an increase in the
status of the Society, so that its voice will be heard the more in the
achievement of its object of popularizing the study of British and
foreign birds in freedom and in captivity.
Support is desired from all members, especially in the enrolment of
new members.

of inland water broken up into more than 30,000 lakes, innumerable
springs forming the heads of rivers. Islands in the lakes and intervening

Crane, Vultures, Glossy, White and Wood Ibis, Snowy and American
Egrets, Anhingas (generally known to us as Darters), and the rare
Great White Heron, and in each is given a full account of the nesting

first thought insurmountable, encountered in obtaining pictures ;
but the one hundred and twenty-one of these which adorn the book

Birds are by no means the only inhabitants of that wonderful

and repulsive creatures besides an abundant growth of tropical vege-
tation.
It is good to know that the birds, in some cases persecuted in the
past to the verge of extinction chiefly for the possession of their plumes,
are now well guarded by wardens of the National Audubon Society.
The Snowy Egret, massacred by plume-hunters for the adornments
which are only developed in the breeding season, is now safe and
restored in numbers while the Great White Heron, at one time
slaughtered for food and then almost wiped out by a hurricane, is
now in a satisfactory state.

This is a pictorial souvenir of the Country Life International Exhibi-
tion of Wild Life Photography which was held with such outstanding
success at the Central Hall, Westminster, in March, 1950. The book
contains a selection of ninety superb pictures chosen from the 1,500
exhibited, of mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and insects. The photo-
graphs are all beautifully reproduced at the high standard which is
always expected from, and given, by, Country Life publications. Of
these twenty-nine are birds and all are so beautiful that it is difficult
to make special mention of any ; however, particularly outstanding
are a series of two of the courtship dance of the Wandering Albatross,
by Lieut.-Colonel Niall Rankin, Brown Pelicans in Texas, by Allan D.
Cruickshank, Pallas's Fishing Eagle in the uplands of Kashmir by
Wan Tho Loke, and the Arctic Tern by Eliot F. Porter.
An introduction giving the history of the development of nature
photography is written by the well-known British bird photographer
G. K. Yeates.

By C. S. Webb.
Up to the present (7th July, 1950), we have bred about ninety
Pheasants this season--all of well-known species such as Golden,
Amherst, Reeves's, Silver, Black-breasted Kalij, and various races of
Phasianus. Three Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl chicks were reared, but
one received a fatal injury caused by fright. This was particularly
unfortunate, as our only adult Sonnerat's cock died recently and the
chicks were hatched from eggs laid about a fortnight after his death.
On checking up on our stock of Kalij Pheasants I found that one
cock did not conform to any described in Beebe's Monograph of the
Pheasants , and there was no skin of it in the British Museum. It has
since been identified as the Black Kalij ( Gennceus moffitti), which was
plated in the Avicultural Magazine for January, 1941. It is
apparently rare in captivity, but has been bred in Japan and America,
though I cannot say what existing stocks are. It hails from India, but
its actual natural habitat is uncertain.
Although these notes do not concern Whipsnade, I feel I must
mention one breeding result from there of great interest. The Kenya
Crested Guineafowl {Guttera pucherani), which the writer collected in
1946 on Mount Kenya, and which were exhibited for a while in
London, were eventually sent to Whipsnade, and early this spring were
liberated in a quiet part of the grounds near the pheasantry. Subse-
quently a nest containing seven eggs was found, and these were
incubated under a silky hen. At present all are thriving, and anyone
acquainted with this exceedingly handsome breed will, I am sure,
hope that it will become established in this country as few birds are
more ornamental.
The best breeding result among the waterfowl in London has been
the rearing of six Paradise Sheld-ducks. The nest was made in a box
on the ground surrounded by thick vegetation in a quiet part of the
Three-island pond. A pair of Alpine Choughs nested in our Waders'
aviary but the chicks were killed by a storm. Recent arrivals have
been heavy and cannot be enumerated in detail. Parrot enthusiasts
will be interested to hear that we have acquired an Everett's Thick-
billed Parrakeet ( Tanygnathus everetti ), which is a rarity from the
Philippines. It is apparently a youngish bird and it is not for me to
inquire how it arrived in England. The vendor stated that it had been
sold to him by a dealer as a Senegal Parrot ! The last Everett's
Parrakeet to arrive at the Zoo came in 1904 and lived till 1915.
Speaking of Parrots, it is now established that psittacosis---a disease
formerly supposed to have had its origin in Parrots--is carried by
other birds, especially domesticated pigeons, in which its incidence is

high. No one would suggest that the ban should now be extended to
Pigeons, but in the light of recent discoveries it seems high time that
the whole approach to this question should be reviewed and that
a meeting of experts on every aspect of the matter should be held to
decide what action to take with a view to having the Parrot ban lifted.
From the Pretoria Zoo we received a Levaillant's Barbet ( Trachy -
phonus vaillanti ) and a Lilac-breasted Roller ( Coracias caudatus). Some
of the older members will remember these delightful birds prior to,
and shortly after, the first world war, when South African birds were
on the market. They are characteristic of the bushveld country of the
N. Transvaal.
From the Kenya highlands we received some East African Malachite
Sunbirds (JV. famosa aenigularis) and a Golden-winged Sunbird
(. Drepanorhynchus reichenowi) in full colour.
From the Antwerp Zoo came a fine Swallow-tailed Humming-bird
(Eupetomena macroura).
Arrivals from the Indian region include Spot-billed Pelicans
(.Pelecanus philippensis) , Blue-winged Sivas (S . cyanouroptera ), Silver-eared
Mesias (M. argentauris) , Dial Bird ( Copsychus saularis), Orange-headed
Ground Thrush ( Geokikla citrina ), White-crested Jay Thrush ( Garrulax
leucolophus) , White-throated Jay Thrush [G. albogularis) , Black-naped
Oriole ( 0 . chinensis indicus ), Indian Rollers ( Coracias indicus ), and
Hooded Pittas {P. cucullata).
From West Africa a collection of about fifty assorted Waxbills and
Weaver Finches, four Red-billed Hornbills ( Tockus erythrorhynchus) , and
one Akun Eagle Owl [Bubo leucostictus) , the latter being new to the
collection.
A Martinique Gallinule came from a most unexpected source.
It was found in the East India Docks of London and was presented
by the Superintendent of Police there. Could it have been a stowaway ?
A collection of South American birds included Sonnini's Partridge
( Colinus cristatus sonnini )--very handsome, Silky Cowbirds ( Molothrus
bonariensis) , Golden-headed Marshbirds {Agelaius icterocephalus) , Violet
Tanagers ( Tanagra violacea), Lesser Rufous-headed Tanagers ( Tanagra
cay ana), Maroon Tanager {Rhamphocelus carbo ), Sulphury Tyrants
{Pitangus sulphuratus) , and Grant's Guans {Penelope granti).

The Avicultural Magazine in Microfilm Form.
The Avicultural Society has entered into an agreement with University Micro-
films, Ann Arbor, Michigan, to make available to libraries issues of the Avicultural
Magazine in microfilm form.
One of the most pressing problems facing all types of libraries to-day is that of
providing adequate space for a constant flood of publications. Periodicals pose an
especially difficult problem because of their bulk and number.
Microfilm makes it possible to produce and distribute copies of periodical literature
on the basis of the entire volume in a single roll, in editions of 30 or more, at a cost of
approximately equal to the cost of binding the same material in a conventional
library binding.
Under the plan, the library keeps the printed issues unbound and circulates them
in that form for from two to three years, which corresponds to the period of greatest
use. When the paper copies begin to wear out or are not called for frequently, they
are disposed of and the microfilm is substituted.
Sales are restricted to those subscribing to the paper edition, and the film copy is
only distributed at the end of the volume year.
The microfilm is in the form of positive microfilm and is furnished on metal reels,
suitably labelled. Inquiries concerning purchase should be directed to University
Microfilms, 313 N. First Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan.
My Yellow-Shouldered Amazon ( Amazona barbadensis ).
I have recently obtained a female of this species. It is a very beautiful bird and
loves climbing about its cage and bathing but so far is absolutely silent. Regent's
Park zoo had one which I believe Monsieur Delacour gave them in 1937. Mr.
Whitley had one in his famous Parrot collection in 1931 which he exhibited at the
Crystal Palace show that year. Of four males and one female in the Bird room of the
London Natural History Museum which I examined all the males come from
Marguerita Island, Venezuela, and the female from Cariaco Peninsula, Venezuela.
Peters' check-list of the Birds of the World, volume iii, page 220, gives its habitat as the
Island of Aruba, off the coast of Venezuela ; littoral of Venezuela. Monsieur Delacour
tells me that there are only a few in American zoos.
I am wondering if there are any more in England as I have not seen a specimen in
any of the zoos and should be interested to hear from anyone who has one.
In Reichenow Vogelbilder aus fernen fonen Abbildungen und Beschreibungen der Papageien,
1883, Plate 1 is a beautiful coloured plate of this bird.

Loath as our Editor must be to prolong this correspondence I feel bound to reply
to the letter in the May-June issue, from which any new reader might well get an
erroneous impression of my original letter.
Anybody comparing the letters will see that in spite of Mr. Dunmore's statement to
the contrary he does in fact agree with me on some points. I will confine myself here,
therefore, to those on which he does not.
I never said that bird-shows do not gain recruits to bird-keeping. What I said,
and what I still think quite correct, is that the recruits so gained do not equal the
number of people who are horrified (often admittedly without much reason) at the
sight of wild birds confined to minute cages, and who go away determined opponents
of aviculture.

That the excitement of shows is beneficial to birds is a doubtful statement. It may
well be true of such birds as are used to the proceedings that the sound and sight of
many potential rivals has a stimulating effect upon them. So has the sight and sound
of the many birds that as Mr. Dunmore says are " temperamentally unsuited to
shows " on many of the lay public !
That captive birds soon come " to ignore their natural enemies beyond the wire "
may be true in some instances, but only I think when that enemy is constantly seen
and does not attack them.
Even then I am not sure that any enemy which is instinctively feared is ever ignored.
The terror the long-domesticated Barbarv Dove shows at the sight of a hawk suggests
that in most cases fear of enemies of which the bird has innate recognition is remark-
ably persistent.
At the time of the passing of the Buckmaster Bill much of the outcry against bird-
keeping was fermented by current descriptions of the conditions at bird-shows.
More recently what appears to have been a bird-show of a rather debateable character
was the focal point of recent prosecutions and concomitant anti-bird-keeping propa-
ganda. In reference to this it may be of interest that a person on the " prosecution-
side " in that affair expressed the opinion to a friend of mine that if birds were in good
condition that in itself was proof they had not been long in captivity. It will be
argued that at shows most birds are in good condition, but this has no effect on the
layman to whom a bird about to die of starvation is often " a greedy fat thing " and
one in good health " looks hungry-like ".
Shows certainly provide an opportunity for fanciers to meet, but if when they do
they loudly discuss the number of Kingfishers they have bought from trappers and
which have died, but their intention of buying more until they get some that do live,
as did two gentlemen that I--and no doubt others--overheard at a pre-war Palace-
Show at Borland Hall, then their meeting is not likely to win much public approval
for Aviculture.
I did not say--as Mr. Vane implies--that the friend I mentioned would like to
stamp out all bird-keeping. I said that he belonged to a Society much larger and
more influential than our own and had been told by one of its leading officials that
they (the Society) would like to do so.
With regard to big-game hunting and collecting for museums. Much cruelty and
even waste of animal-life may result from both but I should be sorry for Aviculture if
we could only offer the weak defence for it that other activities are worse--which is
no defence. Typical of course of British hypocrisy is that bird-keeping, big-game
hunting, collecting for museums, and the like all arouse indignation in people who
freely eat pork, veal, beef, lamb, etc., in the production of which far more deliberate
and relentless cruelty is used than is inflicted by all the collectors, bird-trappers, and
big-game hunters whose activities are condemned.
With regard to Mr. Indge's letter. Ornithology is the study of birds. The primary
aim of our Society--if I remember rightly--are " The Study of British and Foreign
Birds ". Hence it is difficult to see why anyone who wishes to " leave out ornithology "
should wish to be a member of it.
Derek Goodwin.
Toft,
Monk's Road,
Virginia Water.
I would like to support Mr. Indge's note in the Avicultural Magazine regarding
Aviculture and Ornithology. While I have no objection to aviculturalists assisting
ornithologists, I do feel that the Avicultural Magazine has tended to pay far too
much attention to matters, which, while they are no doubt of interest to ornithologists,
are no use to practical keepers and breeders of birds. In your comment, you state
that the amount of available data that has been lost by aviculturalists who fail to
record their experiences of birds in captivity is deplorable. It is deplorable only to
the ornithologist and not to the vast majority of the members of our Society. For
instance, if one goes through all the volumes of the Avicultural Magazine, one will

seldom read detailed instructions for the feeding of insectivorous birds when rearing
young. Two almost equally important factors, namely the size of the aviary and the
other inmates were also usually omitted. There are notable exceptions to this,
particularly in recent years, but I think it will be found that those who succeeded
in breeding birds and gave the sort of data which may be of some value to ornitholo-
gists, omitted to tell anyone who wished to follow in their directions, how it was
done. Most of us have, as our chief interest, the keeping and breeding of birds
in captivity. As a secondary thing, we are interested in birds in the wild state,
but very few to the extent of a being in any way scientific. You may say that this
is a pity, but you must also remember that this is a hobby and not a life's work. We
keep birds for the pleasure they give us, and not for the collection of data for the
use of ornithologists.
The high scientific tone adopted by some of our members in the past resulted in
an article which simply bored the average bird-keeper, particularly the novice.
Even to-day, there are still large numbers of keepers of both British and foreign birds
who do not think it worth while to join the Society. It is that attitude which is, in
my view, very largely responsible for the success of the various splinter societies
which have been formed from time to time. The breeder of some relatively common
bird, such as one of the Waxbills, thinks that for an article in the Avicultural
Magazine he has to give all kinds of details which he simply does not know, so that
he sends his article to some other journal.
Those of our members who are most interested in ornithology are usually those
who have either never kept birds or do not now keep them. To their way of thinking,
aviculture is only justified to the extent to which it helps their own hobby.
I find the work involved in feeding and cleaning, etc., is quite enough, sometimes
more than enough, so that to expect me to go round some twenty aviaries, all (I hope)
full of nests, eggs, and young birds, and record " data ", would be just too much.

By P. W. Teague
Looking back over the years one is often surprised to find where
; one's hesitating and adventurous first steps have led. We are some-
times cautioned about the first wrong turning which resulted in a
career of crime, or we have been encouraged by tales of the first
successful deal that led to fame and fortune. I little thought when
I started keeping Gouldian Finches twenty-five years ago that
I should become expert enough to write a leading article illustrated
;by a famous artist like Peter Scott.
I possessed a fair knowledge of bird keeping (my life-long hobby),
sand decided to attempt to breed the Gouldian Finch in spite of
discouraging remarks from many aviculturists who had failed to breed
or keep these birds for any length of time. After reading all the
records I could find my task looked formidable, but in 1925 I pur-
chased two pairs, one pair of blackheads and one pair of redheads.
By a great stroke of fortune--and I repeat that, for not all Gouldians
will breed--both pairs nested. One pair, in an ordinary canary breeding
cage, reared six young, and the other pair, in a small aviary, reared
four young. These laid the foundations of my stud of Gouldians, for
now I had sufficient birds to experiment with to find out just what
feeding and aviaries suited them best.
My feeding methods were fully described in our Magazine for
May, 1932, and again added to in the 1936 July issue, in which I gave
full details of the Iodized Mineral Salts I used, and am still using, with
good effect. The last war brought about radical changes, for most
feeding items used up to then were unprocurable, but I firmly believe
that the stamina I had built up in my stud, previous to the war,
helped to carry my birds through. Even so disaster nearly overcame
them on several occasions, for the innumerable substitute foods
I tried then either did not suit the birds at all, or were only eaten in
minute quantities, just keeping the birds alive. Had it not been for
the timely arrival of small parcels of seed from countries abroad

P. W. TEAGUE-GOULDIAN FINCHES
per Miss Barclay-Smith and a friend in South Africa, which were
thankfully acknowledged in the 1946 July-August Magazine, I really
think I should probably have lost the whole stud. So serious was this
seed shortage that I exchanged a beautiful pair of redheads for ten
pounds of seed (pre-war value 55.), my need was so desperate.
Speaking of seed, white millet is the one seed I have completely
stopped giving to the Gouldians, because I found after many fatalities,
tests, and experiments, that it did not suit them.
In November, 1941, I was approached through our Editor by
Mr. Southern, of the Oxford University Museum, to carry out certain
crosses for genetic research with the two phases of Gouldians I had,
blackheads and redheads. Just at this time (1941) I had an excellent
stud of Gouldians to work with for this research breeding, and despite
the many setbacks and losses later, it was successfully carried out.
Success was almost snatched from our grasp in 1944. I had twenty-five
youngsters reared, and most of these were just changing into adult
plumage when the seed situation became most desperate. It should
be remembered that the war was then in a very serious position, and
feeding stuffs of any kind were practically non-existent. The birds
were just saved by an S.O.S to Mr. Southern, who managed to get
a pound of canary seed at 21s. This was doled out at so many grains
per bird per day, and this just and only just, lasted until a small
parcel arrived from overseas.
The full details of this research breeding, and the inheritance of
head colour, was given by Mr. Southern in the 1946, July-August
issue of the Magazine.
In 1943 I purchased a small quantity of spray millet seed from
Mr. Ghas. Unwin, of sweet-pea fame, who had a variety he had then
been growing in England for some twelve years or more, and with it
a few hints on cultivation. On the whole, this has proved very
successful, and produced sprays 12 inches and 14 inches in length, full
of good seed.
In 1944 the Curator of Kew Gardens kindly sent me a few seeds
of a grass called Setaria glauca , which is not unlike a miniature spray
millet. Most Gouldians and other seed-eaters are very fond of this.
It is a most useful seed, as it is ready to pick before the millet sprays
are ready. Bengalese are particularly fond of this seeding grass,
especially when rearing young. These useful additions with a small
patch of canary seed did not solve my feeding problems, for there was
the growing period (4 to 5 months) before the crop was ready to
use. The wild birds played havoc with the ripening seeds, particularly
the Marsh Tit, for nothing would scare these little thieves. They
would help themselves, even though I was in the patch trying to scare
them away. I shall be pleased to give a little Setaria glauca seed to any
of our members sending a stamped addressed envelope. This grass

should be grown in full sun, and is best treated as an annual. It is
ready to pick and use when the heads are still green, feel hard, and
slightly prickly.
Bad as the feeding problems were, further troubles and heavy losses
developed. Blast from a near-by bomb accounted for five Gouldians
one night. Hawks and Owls accounted for several more, until I
double wired the fronts. Then in 1946 a far more serious trouble
developed to add to the gloomy picture of my dwindling stud, an
outbreak of Coccidiosis, which undoubtedly got introduced into my
aviaries by wild birds fouling the seeding grasses or millet sprays I was
giving to my birds. By the time this was diagnosed I had lost several
Gouldians and had many sick. Here I owe a debt of thanks to one
of our members, Mr. J. Nicholson, of Stockton, who went to a lot
of trouble and eventually sent me the wonderful I.C.I. preparation,
" Sulphamezathine," which acted like magic and cured the birds
still ailing. Since this outbreak of Coccidiosis I now treat all birds
showing signs of illness with this preparation, unless of course the bird
is suffering from some other obvious ailment. In spite of these set-
backs and losses, and with improved seed conditions, I have been able
to breed my stud of Gouldians again back to normal from the two
" strains " I have. Stamina has been well maintained, and their
colouring, I was told by an Australian aviculturist, was superior and
brighter than any he had seen in the wild state. I do not wish to
boast, but they are indeed marvellous to behold.
It is with a feeling of pride that I can now look back on a unique
achievement of keeping and breeding, without a single break for
twenty-five years, one of the loveliest birds we have, the Gouldian
Finch. I sincerely hope other aviculturists will take up these birds
and improve on my achievement, but let us also hope that no breeder
will ever attempt to alter this bird's unique and wonderful plumage.
I have kept a great variety of birds in my lifetime, but the Gouldian
is undoubtedly one of the most attractive in every way ; it is friendly,
clean, easy to cater for, long lived in suitable quarters, of smart
appearance, gorgeous plumage, and with a pleasant sibilant little
song and an amusing dance--a most desirable bird.
So far I have not mentioned my style of aviary or cage. These are
not what one would call ornamental, but are built with the object of
providing comfort and happiness for the Gouldians, and in which
they are well protected against our changeable climate. In my
early days of keeping Gouldians I had the usual outdoor aviary,
shelter shed and open flight, but one May of very cold east winds
soon convinced me that such accommodation was not suitable for
Gouldians, and not too pleasant for any other warm climate bird ;
so I adopted the " all closed in " type of aviary, that is completely
boarded in, with an open front which has glass substitute shutters for

inclement weather. This is absolutely necessary for cold, damp,
and raw winter days. The three sides and roof are felted to exclude
all possible draughts. All aviaries have wooden floors, and are well
up off the ground to keep them dry ; also double roofs to keep them
cool in the summer ; the space between the two roofs is boarded up
in winter. Gouldians do not like cold, damp foggy weather or cold
winds, and they are certainly more comfortable in a temperature of
between 45 0 and 50* during the winter. A small stove or hurricane
lamp at night will keep out that cold-damp-feeling atmosphere we get
during the winter months. Twiggy branches and perches are provided,
and all aviary floors are covered with fine clean sea sand which is free
from dust. The adoption of sea sand for the floors, coupled with a
more or less dry atmosphere in the aviaries, has practically eliminated
pneumonia and colds.
In addition to the sea sand grit, I also provide a receptacle of grit
made up of very fine oyster shell, cuttlefish bone, and egg shells
from fresh eggs baked in the oven, not shells from preserved eggs.
The cuttle bone and egg shells are powdered up, of course, prior to
mixing with the oyster shell. I attach great importance to this grit.
I supply a variety of nesting boxes, half filled with soft hay or
semi-green grass, and put some hay on the floor for them to complete
the nest building. Here is an excellent type of nest box which par-
ticularly attracts them. Make a box about 10 inches long, 5 inches
wide, and 5 inches high. Carefully take out the one end and cut a
small hole in one corner of it for entrance. Then nail this end piece
inside the box, leaving a small platform about 4 inches deep. This
leaves the actual nesting box 5 inches by 5 inches by 6 inches, and
platform 5 inches by 5 inches by 4 inches. Hang this box close to
the roof in a secluded corner, and cover with a few used millet sprays
or twigs of heather or any such material. One small nail in the lid of the
box will allow you easily to move this for examination, but don't
interfere with the nesting birds any more than is absolutely necessary.
Remember Gouldian hens are very susceptible to egg-binding and
this causes many losses. I would particularly urge the free use of
cod liver oil treated canary seed mixed with a small quantity of the
Indian type millet. This provides treated seed for birds who prefer
millet to canary seed. I have found the addition of five or six drops of
Halibut liver oil mixed with the cod liver oil before adding it to the
seed very beneficial. I give this treated seed daily from the time of
mating up until the hen commences to sit, and once or twice a week
when young are being reared. Of course, they must also be provided
with the usual dry canary and millet seed, but make sure the hen at
least is also eating some of the treated seed by withholding the other
seeds until it is eaten, or you will surely have egg-binding trouble and
loss. I always keep in the aviary some Iodized Mineral Salts (fully

detailed in the 1936 July Magazine) in very small glass or china dishes,
as the birds use quite a lot of this when rearing young.
When rearing young provide a dish of soaked seed or soaked millet
spray, green seeding rye grass or the seed of the small annual seeding
grasses usually found in garden paths, and a sod of fine grass, which
is usually well picked over and the birds like the young tender blades.
Then turn the sod soil upwards for further picking over. Also an
occasional tray of slightly damp fine soil is relished by the Gouldians.
They are not big green-food eaters, but like chickweed or a bit of
lettuce. For bathing and drinking I always use cold boiled water.
With a few exceptions most of the above was fully described in a
previous article in the 1932 May Magazine.
Although I have reared Gouldians in almost every month of the
year, the great majority of them either breed in our autumn or very
early spring. In spite of the fact that I have twenty-five years of
aviary bred stock, the Gouldians still conform with the Australian
seasons for breeding and moulting. Most of the birds commence
to moult in April or May ; this is usually a slow process, but can be
helped quite a lot at this time of the year, April onwards, with the fresh
seeding grass mentioned above, and the Setaria glauca grass heads are
most helpful. A small addition of iron citrate to the drinking water daily
will be found beneficial, or a few drops of syrup of hypophosphates.
Personally I consider a Gouldian is not fully reared until you
have got it into full adult plumage, for in my experience this is the
most serious time in its life, changing from nest feather to adult
plumage, so give the youngsters particular care and attention at this
time. An interesting feature of young Gouldians is the iridescent
globules each side of the beak and black spots inside the mouth
which show up in the dark nests.
Breeders of this beautiful bird would be well advised to keep also
a few pairs of Bengalese to act as foster parents in cases of emergency.
I have kept these accommodating little fosters ever since I started
Gouldians, and wonderful little birds they have proved for the job.
Diseases.--So long as your Gouldians are comfortably housed as
I have tried to describe, kept scrupulously clean and dry, you will not
have much trouble, with the exception that redheaded Gouldians
are subject to " Vertigo ", a twisting of the head. This trouble I have
seen in newly imported redheads before the war. Curiously enough,
it has cropped up amongst a nest of five young redheads bred from an
imported redheaded cock lent to me. Four out of the five developed
this trouble, but the fifth so far appears to be normal. I have never
had this trouble crop up in the blackheadeds. As previously mentioned,
always be on your guard against Goccidiosis. Since I had the outbreak
in 1946 all my birds feed and drink from china or glass receptacles,
which can be easily and thoroughly cleaned.

For field notes and full description of this beautiful little bird,
I cannot do better than recommend Neville W. Cayley's book on
Australian Finches.
In conclusion, I have repeated many items mentioned in previous
articles, so I ask the indulgence of those who have read them, because
this has been written with a view to help new members. I do hope it
will encourage the many admirers of this truly gorgeous little bird,
an outstanding attraction of any aviary.
I have read of many breeding successes of various exotics, but
how many survive for a number of years ? I have bred Gouldians who
have lived for thirteen years in good health, and I now possess breeding
pairs eight years old. A Cordon Bleu Waxbill which I reared in 1938
died only last year. Breeding foreign birds is, in my opinion, of little
use unless particular attention is paid to stamina. A bird in an aviary
needs special care to enable it to survive the artificial conditions of a
strange habitat and climate. What I have accomplished can surely
be done, and I hope surpassed, by other aviculturists.

By The Duke of Bedford
I have at the moment three pairs of Rock Peplars. As this Parrakeet
is rather soberly coloured it is not a favourite with many aviculturists,
nor, as an ordinary aviary bird, should I myself esteem it very highly.
Its flight at liberty is, however, one of the most beautiful and
interesting sights in nature and it was in the hope of again seeing the
wonderful exhibition of young birds trained to fly at liberty during the
day-time that I decided to renew my stock of the species. I heard of
a pair in the possession of a London dealer and eventually secured
them. The dealer, for some unknown reason, had lent these singularly
unsuitable birds to a film studio, and they arrived considerably the
worse for wear, the cock having an injury to the wing from which he
will never completely recover, although he can fly fairly well. About
the same time I obtained two young cocks bred in 1949 which I mated
to hens kindly sent me from Australia among a valuable gift of birds
made by Mr. Hallstrom.
One of the Australian hens gave the impression of being a rather
old bird and was so sluggish during the early winter that I never
thought she would breed. However, she turned out better than her
looks and she has reared four fine young ones. Her mate was still in
immature plumage but when he came into breeding condition his

feathers yellowed quite noticeably and acquired an extra bloom, I am
pretty sure without any kind of moult.
The old pair also did quite well. They were the first birds to lay
in a grandfather clock nest in the flight and reared three good young
ones.
The third pair produced no young but a first-rate comic turn !
Many cock Rock Peplars, of whom the cock of this pair was certainly
one, seem to be handicapped by having had Early Victorian parents
who omit to teach their children " the facts of life ", which they learn,
(if at all) only by a laborious process of trial and error ! I once had
a cock--and an adult bird, too--who was desperately anxious to have
a family. When the nest-box was put in he drove his wife into it and
made her stay there until she laid (an unusual proceeding in a
Polyteline Parrakeet). Any suggestions on her part that there was
a contribution which he had to make towards the production of
offspring he received with angry impatience as a mere excuse for
neglecting her duty and wasting time. The result--infertile eggs--
demonstrated the truth of the maxim " more haste, less speed ".
However, he was not incapable of learning by experience, and next
year he decided that his wife might be right after all !
My young cock this year, although he came into breeding condition
after a fashion and was not indifferent to his mate's nesting activities,
had not the foggiest idea as to the proper way of discharging any of
his marital duties. When the hen wanted him to feed her he refused
to do so but persistently " fed " the perch instead, making, as he did
so, noises like a hen Rock Peplar wanting to be fed ! Even more
serious errors in technique on his part resulted in infertile eggs. These
I removed after a fortnight--hoping that he might learn wisdom and
that the hen might lay again. The poor lady, however, disappointed
in her hopes of offspring and in the worst of tempers, drove her foolish
husband irritably away and started a heavy moult. It was then,
however, that the fun really began ! The cock, quite unabashed,
continued his ridiculous perch-feeding operations and even added
insult to injury by entering a nest-box (not, incidentally, the one his
mate had occupied), and pretending to feed imaginary offspring as
well ! This was too much for his wife. " If this joint has got to be
Bedlam," she clearly said, " I will show him that I can be as good
a Bedlamite as he ! " In the front of the aviary shelter there is a pane
of glass covered with wire netting and a foot or two to the left the
entrance hole giving access to the shelter. The hen Rock Peplar
knew the way into the shelter as well as I did, for the food dish was
inside, but although quite out of real breeding condition and dropping
feathers, she pretended that she was on the point of laying an egg
and could see, through the window, an enchanting nest inside the
shelter which the wire and glass prevented her from reaching. She

proceeded to spend hours frantically climbing about the wire and
swaying her head from side to side in a pretended effort to find a way
in. Before long she succeeded in fooling the cock and getting him
quite interested in the imaginary nest, which I am sure was the object
of her manoeuvre, but she had reckoned without one factor--her own
feminine psychology ! Hen Rock Peplars, it seems, share with women
a capacity denied to any mere man--even a thoroughly experienced
bird dealer. They can sometimes make themselves believe their
own lies ! ! Having pretended so strenuously that she wanted to lay
an egg, she began to think that she really did want to ! She therefore
stopped moulting ; came back into breeding condition ; renewed her
advances to her mate ; took to a real nest-box, and laid a second lot
of eggs. These again unfortunately proved infertile, though for a time
I hoped that her perseverance would be rewarded as the cock seemed
to be getting the hang of things a bit better. He even ended by going
into the nest to feed her, but before doing so he decided to get his own
back on her for taking him in over the shelter &lt;# nest 55 . I heard her
one day calling to him from inside the box to come and feed her,
but although it happened to be the same nest in which he had been
in the habit of " feeding 55 the imaginary family he pretended that,
though dying to comply with her request, he simply couldn&amp;apos;t find the
way in ! " My dear, I know you are starving ; I do want to help
you, but I simply can't find the hole ! Oh, what shall I do ? " Just
as she had scrambled frantically about the window, so he now
scrambled frantically about the sides of the nest-box and peered down
the back, looking everywhere but where the hole really was--in the
front, as plain as the beak on his face !

OBSERVATIONS ON SOME BIRDS IN
ADEN COLONY, SOUTH ARABIA
By Kenneth J. Smith
During Royal Air Force service in 1945 I spent eleven months,
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.971194" page_id="56287968"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
from January to November, in Aden Colony in South Arabia, and in
my spare time I had good opportunities to study the fauna. There
was a wealth of bird life along the coasts and in the plantations and
acacia belts, and a few species existed in areas of scrub and in the
open desert.
To voyagers passing through the Gulf of Aden the rocks towering
above Aden port seem barren, but stunted and gnarled trees and
aromatic plants cling in places to the volcanic slopes. The deep
gorges have a sparse growth of grasses, acacias, and red-stemmed abb

trees. Often I wandered among these desolate rock fastnesses. Basking
lizards retreated as I scrambled along boulder-strewn ravines and
climbed the hot, loose rock faces. Flycatchers and Rock Ghats were
seen, the Ghats often displaying with open wings and with tail
extended fanwise. Sometimes a Yellow-vented Bulbul would break
into sweet liquid song, ending the dead silence of the valleys. Grag
Martins, hawking for insects, passed up and down the gullies, and
I found their mud nests in caves.
I climbed Sham-Sham, the highest peak of the Aden promontory,
several times. The views from the summit made it worth the toil and
sweat, and it was an ideal place to watch the Kites, Egyptian Vultures,
and Tawny Eagles. High above they appeared as tiny curves moving
over a cloudless sky, while others glided below and at eye level with
effortless grace in the clear, still air. A pair of Lesser Peregrine Falcons
seemed to have their nest on an inaccessible ridge. Whenever I passed
along the narrow ledge beneath they swept from the pinnacles with
raucous cries, then stooped and passed so close that I could hear the
swish of their wings as they hurtled over the edge of a precipice.
Of the islands off Aden, Sira Island and Slave Island were most
easy to visit. The former, lying off the bustling native town called
Grater, I always remember for the flocks of Sooty Gulls (Larus
hemprichii ) which waited for the return of the Arab fishing boats, and
it was on Sira that I recorded my only Cormorant.
Slave Island lies in the arms of Aden bay, and can be reached by
wading from the mainland across mud and through a mile of shallow
sea at low tide. It got its name, I was told, from its use in bygone
days as a dumping ground for slaves brought over from Somaliland
by the Arabs. Now it is uninhabited, a splendid place to watch the
Pelicans and Flamingoes feeding and resting in the bay. Occasionally
a group of Pelicans would rise, then, having attained a certain height,
would circle and climb up and up in spirals till they were out of my
sight. When the Flamingoes flew off in long trailing lines against the
background of a red Arabian sunset the scene was doubled in beauty
by the reflection of the sky in the sea. Many waders were seen on
Slave Island beaches, such as Oyster-catchers, Redshanks, and Herons,
but the Grab Plovers (.Dromas ardeold) interested me most of all. In
the distance they looked like little pied Herons as they paddled in
the shallows made by the receding tide, and when approached they
flew off swiftly across the water. My notes, taken at the time of
observation, mention some of their habits being not unlike those of the
true Plovers, and the cry is likened to " a cackling and crude laugh ".
Two species of Tern were particularly common around the sandy
Aden coasts ; the Red Sea Swift Tern {Sterna bergii velox ), with yellow
bill and handsome black crest, and the Lesser Crested Tern {Sterna
bengalensis ), with orange-coloured bill. Large flocks flew leisurely over

the waves, birds plopping or diving down now and again to fetch
a fish from the water. Another bird often seen round the coasts,
especially where rocky, was the Osprey. I liked to watch Ospreys
fish, to see a bird return to shore to devour its prey, often to the
same look-out position time after time. I discovered two Ospreys 3
nests, but I could not examine them closely as they were built on
high cliffs and were protected by formidable overhanging rocks.
The port area of Aden is connected to the native township of Sheik
Othmann, and to the desert beyond, by a causeway at Khormaksar.
Here, on both sides of the causeway, are wide expanses of salt-pans,
or salt lakes. In the process of obtaining salt from sea water by
evaporation under the fierce sun the pans are generally at varying
levels, so that some are always suitable for birds. Pelicans and
Flamingoes frequented the deep ones, while the smaller Waders
showed a preference for shallow pans. Feeding Spoonbills advanced
through the water in formation, shovelling and swinging their bills
from side to side, and flying Avocets made a pleasing impression in
black and white. Several times I saw Black-winged Stilts, and in
March two Sacred Ibis turned up on an almost dry salt pan near
Jibir for a few days. I watched them forage, their curved bills entirely
submerged in mud much of the time.
Three kinds of Heron occurred on the salt-pans ; the Grey Heron
(Ardea cinera ), the Red Sea Reef Heron (Egretta schistaced ), and the
Red Sea Green-backed Heron (Butorides striatus hrevipes ). The Red
Sea Reef Heron, about the size of a little Egret, and appearing in two
forms--white and slate blue, was very common. I counted thirty on
one small marsh, and it was quite usual to count over a hundred in
an afternoon visit to the salt-pans. The Red Sea Green-backed Heron
is a more solitary bird, bittern-like in its poses, and of skulking habits.
Unlike the Reef Heron, it sometimes extends its neck fully in flight,
and instead of rising sharply it takes off on a low direct flight across
the water.
Parts of Arabia are almost rainless. I experienced under half an hour
of rainfall during my entire stay in Aden Colony. Many of the wadis
remain dry for months, perhaps years, and villages are situated where
water has been obtained by sinking wells deep beneath the desert
sands. In these conditions groves and plantations, especially where
watered by irrigation channels, are havens for birds. In a grove at
Hiswa I recorded an Arabian Grey-headed Kingfisher and a Chanting
Goshawk nested in the palms. Bee-eaters frequented the greenery and
banks of a dry wadi that runs through the desert from Hiswa towards
Bir Ahmed, and one day when following the birds I surprised a pair
of Gazelles behind a sandy hillock.
In the pleasant public gardens outside Sheik Othmann town
I found colonies of nesting Weavers. High in the palms were the

nests of the Arabian Kites ( Milvus migrans arabicus) that scavenged
around the native houses, and several of the Sunbirds I found nesting
in the gardens were, I think, of the Nile Valley species. Buff-backed
Herons stalked among plots of Indian corn, and once I watched
a Blue-headed Wagtail flitting alongside the water channels. Cuckoos,
Equatorial Laughing Doves, and blue Rollers (Corarias garrulus) were
also seen. Twice when I visited Sheik Othmann, once in the gardens
and once among some dense acacia growth by a mosque at the desert
edge, I heard the flute-like notes of the Golden Oriole, and looking
up saw flashes of yellow and black in the canopy of the trees.
North of Sheik Othmann, away across the desert that leads to the
Yemen, is Lahej. The palace of the Sultan dominates the town, and
when I passed through to visit the Sultan's plantations beyond I was
surrounded by crowds of inquisitive Arabs, for Europeans seldom
travel this way. Along the dusty road from the town to the plantations
I noted Hoopoes flying among the wayside trees and prancing among
the crops, little disturbed by passing camels, goats, donkeys, and
noisy natives. The Sultan's plantations are well supplied with water,
being by a wadi which often receives water from rainfall on mountains
further inland. Bananas and other fruits are cultivated, and here
I found Paradise Flycatchers, Bulbuls, Sunbirds, Coucals, and more
Hoopoes.
Black Bush-Robins and two species of Shrike inhabited patches of
scrub, but the most common bird encountered in the desert was the
Hoopoe-Lark. It is a most confiding bird. Very Thrush-like in gait,
it occasionally runs along the sand and seems reluctant to fly away.
I recorded Hoopoe-Larks from all parts of the desert I covered, from
near Hiswa, Jibir, Bir Fukum, Lahej, and from Riyan, in the
Hadhramaut desert, east of Mukalla. One morning I was fortunate
in seeing a large flock of White Storks passing over the desert on
migration.

As will be seen, last spring the stock consisted of two cocks and
four hen Rheas. One of these, a white hen, the Rotterdam Zoo gave
on loan. Two cocks and two hens were received from the Argentine
some years before. The remaining hen came from U.S.A., apparently
a bird bred in an American zoo. The latter died 20th May inst.
from egg-binding.
The eggs laid by each hen were noted till 13th May. The dates
are as follows :--
Hen No. 1 (Argentine) April 16, 18, 20, 27, 29, May 1, 3, 5, 9, 13.
Hen No. 2 ( , ) April 15, 17, 20, 25, 29.
Hen No. 3 (U.S.A.) April 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, May 11, 13.
Hen No. 4 (white one) March 28, April 1, 5, 9, 13, 19, 25, 30, May 9, 13.
My cock Rheas are never broody before the weather is hot, and
as this was not the case this year before the first week of May, a
number of eggs became too old and were useless. On 12th May one
cock showed symptoms of broodiness and seventeen eggs were then
placed in the nest, on which he promptly sat.
During incubation several eggs were broken by the broody cock,
so that on 17th May only thirteen eggs remained. On 8th June the
nest contained twelve eggs and on 24th June one young Rhea hatched.
Thus, in this case, the incubation lasted about forty-three days, rather
a long time, which I ascribe to the fact that the cock was not sitting
* Reared in this case means that the birds were in good condition at 2 months
old at the time of writing.

very close and the weather being very cold. The other eggs were
clear.
The other cock started brooding on 24th May. This time on twelve
eggs. The females were not separated. On 27th May the nest con-
tained fourteen eggs and on 4th June, when the bird left the nest for
a short time, we counted twenty eggs. The hens were then put apart.
This cock was brooding well, rarely leaving the nest, and only one
egg was broken during incubation. On 2nd July one young Rhea
hatched and on the following day three more chicks made their
appearance. Out of thirty-seven eggs incubated, therefore, not more
than five chicks hatched, a rather disappointing result.
In aviculture it is not always easy to ascertain the reasons for
breeding failures, which also applies to this case. I may, however,
draw the attention to the following facts :--\0x25A0
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.77784975" page_id="56287973"  page_num="203" year="" vol="">
(1) Always a high percentage of the eggs laid by Rheas are not
fertile. This is not only the case here, but also in the country of origin.
I hear from the Argentine that one must reckon on 40 per cent infertile
eggs. Having studied the behaviour of the cock Rhea in the breeding
season, during a number of years, I have come to the following
conclusions :--
(a) That the number of eggs fertilized by one pairing is small ;
(b) That the pairing takes place with rather long intervals. This
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990154727272727" page_id="56287973"  page_num="203" year="" vol="">
means that many eggs must remain infertile if the cock Rhea has
a harem at his disposition.
There is, of course, a sexual difference between the temperament of
individual cock Rheas, but in general I believe that a higher percentage
of fertility will be obtained if the cock is treated as more or less mono-
gamous, though in the wild state it is polygamous. Therefore, my
having four hens with one cock at one time was not an unnatural
combination, but it was probably not a good ratio if one hopes for
a high percentage of fertile eggs. It seems that in captivity polyandry
also occurs, but as a rule in the mating season the fiercest cock of
a flock drives away other cocks and the females take the company of
the former. When the cock starts sitting a few more eggs may be laid
near the breeding bird, but soon the females stray and another cock,
if present, will be promoted husband.
(2) The eggs are collected as soon as they are laid. When a certain
number of eggs have been collected we wait till the weather is hot
and then place them in the nest and usually at the mere sight of the
eggs the cock will sit. In case the bird has not chosen a good place
for his nest we make another nest at a suitable place, in which the
eggs are deposited. Now as to the number of eggs to be placed in
the nest, I believe there must be some restriction. Perhaps not more
than twelve to thirteen eggs can be kept sufficiently warm, and maybe

the above-mentioned clutches of seventeen and twenty eggs were too
large, with the result that every day some eggs were cold, making
the embryos die at an early stage.
(3) Further, there is the question of food. My Rheas have access
to a meadow and can consequently eat as much grass as they like.
In the morning bread is given and in the evening La Plata maizemeal.
When grass is scarce in winter, Swedish turnip, cut up in pieces, is
added to the menu. Now I thought maizemeal did not provide
sufficient variation of diet and instead started giving the birds at the
beginning of the year a mixture of maizemeal, poultry meal, and dried
shrimps. Since then, too late, however, I have remarked that if the
portions of maizemeal are mixed and thus the quantity of maizemeal
diminished, the effect is that the cock Rhea becomes less sensible to
the charms of his light-hearted companions. It is possible that the fact
that Rheas got less maizemeal this year unfavourably influenced the
breeding results.
Long ago I had young Rheas brought up by broody Turkey-hens.
As, however, a Turkey-hen can only cover two eggs, not more and
not less, placed in a nest with a deep hollow and as a number of
broody Turkey-hens are not always obtainable at one time, this
method can only be put into practice on a small scale and can only
be recommended in case of need, to save a few eggs.
The rearing of young Rheas by the cock Rhea himself has very
attractive aspects, for a cock Rhea amidst a dozen of young ones is
a grand sight. This method has, however, several disadvantages and
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.976281666666667" page_id="56287974"  page_num="204" year="" vol="">
my experiences are not very good --
(1) The cock Rhea is very nervous when the young birds walk
around him, with the result that he often tramples on them.
(2) It is practically impossible to give the young Rheas separate
food.
(3) The cock Rhea, in his nervous state, will not sit often enough,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996392214285714" page_id="56287974"  page_num="204" year="" vol="">
so that many chicks perish from lack of warmth when the weather is
cold or rainy.
It seems that good results can be obtained by the use of an incubator,
but possessing no incubator, I am not able to give any information.
For the last two years the young Rheas have been taken as soon as
they leave the nest. When doing this the old bird will rise, but he
will sit again if the eggs that have not yet hatched remain in the nest.
The young Rheas are put in a shed furnished with an electric heating
lamp. The temperature under the lamp is kept for the first two
weeks at about 85 degrees Fahrenheit on the floor. After that the
temperature is gradually lowered and provided the weather is fine
the lamp is only kept lit during the night.
In the beginning the young Rheas are unsteady on their legs. In
consequence, they can keep their balance better when pecking

horizontally than when pecking to the ground. In this connection
we place near the birds, but not under the lamp, a woodblock, about
5 inches high and sprinkle the food on this woodblock for the first
few days. In this way we never have difficulty in starting them
feeding as the beginning is always a pecking in vertical line.
The first two days we give the young birds fresh ant eggs and the
yolk of hard-boiled egg. After that the hard-boiled egg is omitted
and moistened chicken meal and white bread are given. The chicken-
meal is gradually replaced by poultry-meal and the poultry-meal by
maizemeal. Fresh ant eggs are given as long as obtainable and plenty
of them. To be more exact, for instance when the birds are three
weeks old, three times a day a soup-spoon of ant eggs per head is given.
The meal is mixed with phosphate of lime and vitamins A and D.
We never feed cut up grass. When Rheas graze they peck each time
one single grass-blade. On the contrary when given cut up grass, each
time they peck they get a mouthful and they apparently cannot digest
this grass quickly enough. A certain amount of grass then remains
in the stomach, forming grass balls, which they cannot get rid of, and
they die.
Care must be taken that the young Rheas do not grow fat. If so,
the legs, which are not very strong in the beginning, cannot support
the heavy body and leg-deformities are the result. It is therefore
essential that the birds should be able to take much exercise on the
lawn and that they are not overfed. Drinking water must not be
forgotten as they are sometimes very thirsty.

The bird collections of the New York Zoological Park (Bronx Zoo)
were again enriched on 20th July, 1950, by the arrival of Charles
Cordier, our collector, with a superb collection gathered in Ecuador.
Accompanied by Mrs. Cordier, now an able and experienced assistant,
Cordier left for his field of operations on 2nd October, 1949. Head-
quarters were established in Quito, and here the products of numerous
side trips were maintained in excellent condition under the supervision
of Mrs. Cordier.
The return to New York was made by a special airplane flight,
which again demonstrated the efficiency of this mode of transportation
when the value of the collection justifies the cost. There were no
losses en route and everything was landed in excellent condition.
Projects of this magnitude cannot be carried through without many
risks and ventures, but these are forgotten in light of the rich returns.
The collection contains many highlights. The Long-wattled

males and one female. The extremely long wattle, reaching a length
of 10-12 inches, is a challenge to observation. The Eastern Umbrella
Bird, of which we have two males, are quite different in appearance, ]
the white iris and white patch at the base of the crest being very
distinctive.
The Cocks-of-the-Rock, while less deep in colour than the Scarlet
(sanguinolenta) from the west slope, are brilliant in frosted reddish-
orange.
There are many other great rarities, of course, but the Humming-
birds include many notable forms. Best of all is the incredible Sword-
bill, its beak quite 5 inches long and noticeably thick. Fortunately,
Cordier's specimen is a female, the beak in this sex being longer than
that of the male. In a single day of intensive work Cordier taught
the bird to feed from an ordinary hummer bottle, which it continues
to do with facility.
This collection, a list of which follows, represents another great
success to the credit of Charles Cordier.

THE BREEDING OF THE PILEATED OR RED-

at Keston of the Pileated Parrakeet (. Porphyrocephalus spurrius) in the
farm breeding results, but as it is just forty years since this fine
Parrakeet was last bred in the British Isles, and as it has only ever
been bred on two previous occasions in this country, I thought the
event merited a separate account.
The two previous successful breeders were Mr. Hubert Astley and
Mr. Fasey, in both cases during the first decade of the present century.
The pair at Keston went to nest towards the end of April, laying
six eggs, every one of which hatched, and all six young ones have just
finished fledging as I write (17th July), the first one having emerged
on 12th July. They are very strong fliers and altogether an excep-
tionally fine brood--quite as good as the best young Parrakeets we
ever bred at Keston in pre-war days.
One curious thing about them which I cannot remember in any
other brood of newly fledged Parrakeets is that whereas the first two
young ones to leave the nest were remarkably steady and sensible,
indulging in none of the usual juvenile bosh shots at perches, and
crash landings--so harassing for their anxious owner to watch--the
last four to emerge were as wild as Hawks (or young Turquoisines !)
so that one hardly dare go near their aviary.
In colour they are very unlike their resplendent parents, being
mainly green, rather lighter on the cheeks and with the whole of
the breast medium grey with the faintest suggestion of mauve in it.
The only sign of a future red cap consists of a few small reddish-orange
feathers just above the nostrils. Their beaks are very pale horn-colour.
In the first two to fledge which, owing to their steadiness, I was able
to examine at close quarters, the lower flanks and under tail-coverts

of one are mainly red with tinges of yellowish-green at the outer edge
of some of the feathers, while those of the other are mainly yellowish-
green with tinges of red. It is possible that these two may prove
a pair, particularly as the former--presumably the cock--has, if
anything, a slightly more mauve look about the breast.
They have, of course, the curious beak of an adult Pileated, which
owing, I suppose, to the slightly elongated lower mandible, does not,
as it were, close properly, so that seen in profile you can see the light
of day through the gap in the centre.
The pair of Pileated arrived at Keston last summer too late to
breed, and were at first housed in one of our field aviaries with a
double-length flight. To begin with they did well, until one morning
I found the hen ill. She was in tight feather but seemed dazed and
unnaturally slow in her movements and reactions. What was wrong
I don't know, but I feared she was about to have one of the fits to
which Pileated are reputedly so prone. In any case, I hurriedly caught
her up and she was given heat treatment in a hospital cage and, in
addition, that marvellous drug Sulphamezathine in her water for the
prescribed five days, and as a result she made a swift recovery.
After that I decided that the pair had better spend the winter in
a large flight cage in the acclimatizing room, and in this they did
very well although artificial heat was only supplied during spells of
really cold weather.
During this period they were fed on canary, millet, sunflower, and
monkey nuts--no hemp--and they had bread soaked in sweetened
watered milk and also apple, the two latter being given on alternate
days.
It is, I think, of considerable interest that almost in every case the
highest percentage of fertile eggs among members of the Parrot family
at Keston this season was to be found among the birds to which I have
recently started giving bread and milk--the Pileated, the Ringnecks,
and the Roseate Cockatoos--and this was particularly marked in the
case of the Pileated Parrakeets, whose confinement in a flight cage
during the winter months might well have been expected to impair
their fertility, whereas it seems to have done quite the reverse. Perhaps
one ought always to cage one's breeding pairs of Parrakeets for the
winter in order to prevent their being rendered infertile by too much
exercise !
The Pileated were bred in one of our standard size field aviaries
which have an overall length of 15 feet. The parents were given two
nest-boxes, one of the grandfather clock type and the other, which
was about 2 ft. 6 in. deep, hung up on the front of the shelter under
overhead cover, and of the two they chose the latter. Both boxes had
a decayed wood filling.
While they were rearing their brood they consumed an astonishing

amount of sweetened bread and milk, but seemed to lose all interest
in sunflower and monkey nuts, and as their only desire appeared to
be for hemp, I greatly increased their allowance of it. I shall, however,
gradually have to reduce it as soon as the young ones are independent
of their parents, because while I think it is an excellent rearing food,
most Parrakeets are only too prone to become entirely addicted to it,
to the exclusion of all other seeds, and this they should never be
allowed to do.
As green food, the Pileated had a daily supply of flowering ryegrass
and seakale beet, of which they are very fond of the fleshy white
stalks. I did not give them fruit as really ripe sweet fruit is hard to
come by in the spring and early summer months--particularly since
the war--and I am certain that unless the fruit given really is sweet
and ripe it can do a great deal more harm than good, not so much
to the parents as to the delicate stomachs of the nestlings to whom
they feed it.
The Pileated Parrakeet, which many readers of this article may
never have seen, is a really magnificent bird, in some ways like and
in others very unlike the Broadtails, to which it is most closely related.
The male has the mantle and wings green ; the outer edge of the
wing and part of the flight feathers blue. Central tail feathers dark
green, and the outer ones blue bordered with white. The cap is
crimson and the cheeks greenish-yellow, the same colour as the rump.
The under tail-coverts red, and the whole of the breast a beautiful
violet-purple. The bill is a dark bluish horn-colour.
The females are said to be variable as to colour, but the one we
have is obliging enough to conform exactly to the weary author's
invariable description (when in doubt !) of the hen of any particular
species as : " Similar to the male, though all her colours are slightly
duller."
These Parrakeets are great bathers, and the hen, while sitting,
always used to have a hurried bath when she came off the eggs,
returning to the nest-box when still wet, which I always like to see
as it prevents the nest becoming too dry and the shells of the eggs
correspondingly hard and brittle. The young ones also, early evinced
the same love of bathing, which they even started to do only a few
days after they left the nest, which is something I cannot ever remember
having observed in any other young newly fledged Parrakeets, which
usually start to bathe after a fortnight or so when they have become
independent of their parents.
The Pileated Parrakeet is a native of South-West Australia where it j
has not, I believe, a very extensive range, and this, combined with
the fact that it is an orchard raider, and therefore much hated and
persecuted by Australian fruit farmers, makes its survival precarious
indeed, unless it can be saved from extinction by being systematically

bred in aviaries both here and in its own country. I believe it is
fairly well established in certain Californian aviaries, and the credit
for this is largely due to the present Duke of Bedford, who sent out
breeding stocks before the war.
Pileated are extremely active birds, always on the move, and they
have a curious and distinctive cry, best rendered as : " Clor-clor . . .
crilk-crilk-crilk ! " and anything unusual is greeted by the alarm note,
a sharp double ## Crilk-crilk ! ".
I sometimes think I should like to be given the job of renaming
some of the---at present--very stupidly named Parrakeets, of which
the Pileated is a good example. " Pileated " conveys nothing whatever
to most people and gives no inkling of the magnificent appearance of
the bird to which it has been given. Its alternative name of Red-capped
Parrakeet is certainly much better, but even this gives no indication
of the bird's most striking--and indeed among Parrakeets, unique
feature--namely its beautiful violet-purple breast ; so I would not
have hesitated to call it the Purple-breasted Parrakeet.

A pair of these Lorikeets from the mountains of New Guinea were
included in the Australian collection sent me by Mr. Hallstrom last
summer.
They are small birds, little larger, in fact, that Peachfaced Lovebirds,
though longer by reason of their pointed tails. In build and movements
they bear a considerable resemblance to the Trichoglossine Lorikeets
although they do not posture in quite the same absurd fashion as the
latter. The general plumage is green, slightly paler on the cheeks
and flanks and the top of the head is washed with brownish gold.
The breast is red and there is a red bar across the inner webs of the
flights which does not show when the wing is closed, and some red
and yellow on the inner webs of the tail feathers, which normally do
not show either. The bill is long and curved and of a yellowish horn
colour and the legs and feet are dusky.
Although in most respects typical Lorikeets, my aviary attendant is
of opinion that they have not brush tongues and their feeding habits
point in the same direction for they have persistently refused liquid
food other than a little sweetened bread and milk when rearing
young, and have lived on mixed seed, sweet apple and pear and grapes.
The late summer and autumn of the year of their arrival they spent
in a small brick-floored avairy at Haywards Heath and, as my aviary

attendant did not consider the hen very robust, as she flew somewhat
heavily, they were kept in a flight cage in heated birdrooms during
the winter. In the early months of the present year they were
transferred to Woburn where I had the chance of observing them
properly for the first time. The cock and hen were very much alike
but the former was slightly larger and brighter in colour. They were
an affectionate couple, often preening each other's feathers and never
far apart. Occasionally, if the cock were disturbed and upset, he
would give his wife a peck but there seemed no personal ill-feeling
behind it and she appeared to be aware that this was the case !
The Lorikeets' calls were rather harsh and sibilant but too low in
tone and too lacking in volume to be unpleasant, even in a confined
space. In April I turned the pair into a 24 ft. by 8 ft. by 8 ft. movable
aviary, giving them a little heat in the shelter by means of an oil
lamp. They did not appear to mind the vile weather in the least,
spending all their time in the flight and it would not surprise me if
they proved as hardy as Swainsons. I provided them with a grand-
father clock nest-box in the flight, of which at first they took no
notice. Towards the end of May, however, the hen seemed to me to
be getting livelier and more assertive and I once saw her making
a casual inspection of the entrance hole. A little later, rather suddenly
and unexpectedly, the pair took to roosting in the box and not long
after to spending most of their time in it. In June it was discovered
that two eggs had been laid. The cock was rarely seen off the nest
and the hen hardly ever. How far the cock helped to incubate I
cannot say. He certainly did not take turns with his mate, regularly,
like a Blue Lory, but on the other hand, he was with her a great deal.
About the 10th July both old birds were off the nest, and looking in
I saw a baby, possibly about ten days old, still blind and fairly well
covered with grey down. A few days later both old birds were off
the nest for a suspiciously long time and inspection unfortunately
showed that the young one was dead. The parents did not appear
to have injured or neglected it in any way so the cause of death
remains rather a mystery. Possibly the food was not entirely suitable.
If any further attempts are made at breeding it is to be hoped that
they will be more successful. I once almost succeeded in rearing the
delicate Racket-tailed Parrot after so many failures that I had lost all
hope. A young bird at last lived to leave the nest, only to be killed
mysteriously by vermin the same day.
Muschenbroek's Lorikeets have a quaint habit, if one of a pair
wishes to get the other side of its partner, of taking a brisk vertical
hop over the latter's back and coming down in the desired position.
Judging by the pained expression on my aviary attendant's face and
the noises he emits when he handles the little bird without gloves,
Muschenbroek's Lorikeet resembles the baboon in that, as the Rev.

Topsell, an early writer on Natural History, tells us of that animal,
" His kind bite deeply and eagerly " ! For this reason I would not
trust Muschenbroek's--or any other Lorikeet--in mixed company, but
for all that it is a nice little bird, which, if it lacks the gorgeous colours
of some of his relatives, also lacks some of their failings--messiness,
troublesomeness to feed, and noise.

(Continued from page 153)
Among other rarities of the Parrakeet family we had here at various
times were Layards, Derbyan, and Malabars. The latter bred
successfully at Keston, and I have always thought them one of the
most elegantly shaped and beautiful of all the Palaeornis Parrakeets.
We also had a pair of the bright golden yellow and very garrulous
and entertaining Queen of Bavaria's Gonures, also Caiques and a fine
and, what appeared to be obvious pair, of the charming little Senegal
Parrot. Curiously enough, although the latter had a roomy aviary to
themselves they never during the two years we had them made the
slightest attempt to go to nest.
We also had some of the rare black Australian Banksian Cockatoos.
These large and imposing birds possess a very individual charm all
their own, and males particularly are very much gentler creatures
than they look--which is perhaps as well ! Unfortunately, they are
difficult subjects in confinement, being fatally prone to tuberculosis.
Ordinary Cockatoo diet will keep them alive for a time but seems to
lack some essential that they need. They appear, strangely enough for
a Cockatoo, to be partially insectivorous, though mealworms are
usually rejected. The only live insect food they will take--and one
which they adore--is the grub which inhabits an oakapple gall. These
seem, at any rate in this country, necessary to their well-being, but
of course can only be obtained at certain times of the year.
When war broke out we were in the process of constructing an
extensive range of Cockatoo aviaries to house a really representative
collection, the nucleus we then had consisting of Leadbeaters,
Banksians, and Roseates. This project, however, like so many others,
had, of course, to be abandoned, and nowadays the only Cockatoos
we have left are a pair of Roseates which breed regularly each season,

reducing their nest-box to a heap of sawdust as soon as they consider
it has fulfilled its purpose !
Lord Tavistock once lent us for breeding purposes a very beautiful
cock white Roseate which we mated to an ordinary grey hen. In this
freak specimen all the normally grey areas of the plumage were snow
white, which makes a dazzling contrast to the particularly deep
squashed-strawberry pink of the breast feathers. This bird, unlike
some " sports ", was infinitely lovelier than the normal form of
Roseate, and I would have dearly loved to be able to perpetuate the
strain. Unfortunately, however, this bird proved to be a confirmed
egg-eater, and when returned to Lord Tavistock he was guilty of the
same vice at Peasmarsh.
It is unfortunate that these freak specimens--some of them very
beautiful---so often prove, for one reason or another, hopeless for
breeding purposes.
A particularly gorgeous and I should say quite unique sport in
Lord Tavistock's collection is a lutino Amazon (I think a Blue-
fronted) in which the red areas are retained, the normally green
parts of the plumage being replaced by a lovely clear golden yellow.
He also received from Australia a lutino Broadtail--as far as I can
remember a cock Rosella--which was equally beautiful. This bird
was to have come to Keston, and I was going to have a shot at
perpetuating the lutino strain, and I was more than sorry to hear that
it had died of pneumonia in Lord Tavistock's bird hospital shortly
after its arrival. However, I did at least see it before it died.
His lutino Amazon was always useless as a breeder.
Just before the war we bred, as has been recorded in the Avi-
gultural Magazine, Blue-fronted Amazons, pure-bred, for the first
time in this country. This was a grand thrill, particularly as their
first brood consisted of no less than five very lusty young Amazons,
all of which were successfully reared. Altogether this pair fully reared
eleven young ones here before the hen unfortunately caught pneumonia
and died.
It is a curious thing that no matter how tame and friendly they
may have been before, it seems that all male Parrots automatically
become fiends incarnate towards their former human friends the
moment they are mated, and the father of these broods was no
exception. He was always on the lookout to remove a chunk from
your neck as you bent down to refill the water vessel, or to amputate
a finger when you put your hand in the feeding door. Actually,
I believe he once satisfied the former ambition with a previous owner,
and a fine new male we have recently acquired to mate to a hen of
our own breeding made quite a creditable effort to remove one of my
fingers a few days ago ! Apparently, Macaws become equally savage
when mated, and I think it was Monsieur Decoux who told us he

had a pair of Blue and Yellows breeding at liberty which became
such a menace that they had to be caught up. They must be a splendid
sight flying loose, which I have always wanted to see. Although I was
fortunate enough to see many and various members of the Parrot
family in Lord Tavistock's collection at liberty at Warblington House
(there was a whole flock of young Barrabands !) I never remember
any Macaws. Lady Londonderry, writing not long ago from Northern
Ireland, told me of a couple she has at liberty at Mount Stewart
which are so tame that they fly in each morning through the window
to partake of a meal on the kitchen table !
About 1937 we acquired a female Occipital Blue Pie (instantly
christened by our staff, the Hospital Blue Pie !) and one of our
customers who also had a single specimen very kindly let us have it.
At first we had no idea whether they were a pair, but were not long
left in doubt as our bird was shortly afterwards seen crouching on the
perch while the new acquisition took a series of gigantic leaps, to and
fro, across her prone form. This, accompanied on the male's part by
a low and surprisingly sweet song, rather like the muted notes of a
Thrush, which is somehow the last thing you would expect from
a member of the harsh-voiced Pie family, constitute the, I should
imagine, rarely observed courtship display.
I know of few lovelier birds, both as to form and colour, than an
Occipital Blue Pie in perfect condition, particularly when with its long
and slightly incurved tail undulating behind, it flies with all the
peculiarly light aery buoyancy of our own native Jay.
It had long been my ambition to breed these birds, and I succeeded
in doing so, but it was a long and laborious task, and I certainly don't
think I quite realized just what I was letting myself in for !
The pair were in an aviary 25 feet long by 6 feet wide by 7 feet high.
At the shelter end of this I fixed up a thicket of nailed-up branches of
laurel, and in this they soon constructed a large nest.
We felt we could not remain indefinitely in complete ignorance as
to how matters were progressing, and one day, amid much angry
chattering from the parents, we managed to catch a glimpse of three
eggs in the nest. Two young ones were eventually reared, and as far
as I can remember, all three eggs hatched, the third nestling
disappearing when very small.
As the natural food of the Pie family consists, when available, of
other birds' eggs and nestling, it has always been a marvel to me
that they are able to resist the temptation to treat their own eggs
and newly-hatched young merely as tasty additions to their diet, and
with this thought in mind I realized that a very plentiful and frequent
supply of their natural foods would be necessary to keep at bay any
cannibalistic tendencies.
When the young ones hatched the hard work--or perhaps hard

labour is the more appropriate word !--really started. The parents,
who always seemed desperately hungry, had to be kept perpetually
supplied with strips of raw meat, mealworms, small freshly-killed rats,
mice, and young Sparrows, and, in addition, they were given any
unfertile Budgerigar and Parrakeet eggs, which they regarded as the
choicest of morsels. I used to give them just as much food as they
would finish up completely every three hours during the whole time
the young were in the nest, and I am sure that in the way of feeding,
" little and often 55 is the secret of successfully rearing these carnivorous
species. If not given enough they eat their own young ones, and if
given too much they lose interest and let them starve. At any rate,
it is pleasant to record that our labours were not in vain, for there
came the day when the two young ones--dull-coloured short-tailed
editions of their magnificent parents--were to be seen perching for
the first time on the laurel branches beside the nest, after which they
matured rapidly, eventually becoming just as fine specimens as their
parents.
Shortly afterwards I was able to satisfy a long-standing ambition to
possess a pair of Hunting Gissas, whose great beauty I have always
admired. The hen was already an aviary bird and was obtained after
the cock which was a newly-imported specimen, and it was extra-
ordinary to watch the green of the latter's plumage changing, as it
were, almost overnight into blue. Fortunately, this change of colour
in captivity, for which, incidentally, I don't think any satisfactory
explanation has ever been suggested, is, in the case of the Cissa, if
anything rather an improvement than otherwise upon its original
green in the wild state, which certainly cannot be said, for instance,
of the pale uninteresting brickish pink which, in confinement, replaces
the lovely vivid crimson of a freshly-imported Scarlet Tanager. The
same, though to a lesser extent, applies also to Grenadier Weavers
which never moult out with quite the same fiery orange-red of their
importation plumage. Another unexplained mystery is why the
aviary-bred young of Australian Longtailed Grass Finches, though
they may be in every other way perfect specimens, never attain any-
thing like the immensely long and tapering central tail feathers of
their imported wild-caught parents.
To return to the pair of Hunting Gissas : their history unfortunately
is a brief one, for the hen escaped when they were being moved into
their breeding aviary, and was never once seen again, and we shortly
afterwards parted with the cock.
Of all the insectivorous birds I have ever kept I think my favourite
is the infinitely beautiful and charming little Rufous-bellied Niltava,
with its wonderful colour combination of blue-black, deep blue,
brilliant cobalt blue, and autumn-leaf copper.
These birds are generally reputed to be delicate and prone to

pneumonia, but I can only say that the cock which lived in my planted
garden for about nine years roosted out on the bitterest winter nights
in an evergreen bush and was always the picture of health, and
eventually died of old age. He may have been an unusually tough
specimen. At any rate, the only trouble I ever had with him was
when I first had him and used to take him into a large flight cage in
a heated bird room for the winter. This did not seem to suit him at
all, and as I several times nearly lost him, I decided to let him winter
out of doors, and after that he was always in perfect health and
condition.
I have always attributed his exceptional longevity mainly to the
fact that he never had to depend for insect food upon mealworms,
which I personally think are very bad for birds unless they are most
strictly rationed. He was the most expert flycatcher and during
summer and early autumn was able to capture an endless variety of
insects for himself.
After I had had him for several years I at last managed to get
a mate for him, which was by no means easy as, probably owing to
their dull colouring, hens were seldom imported. This hen, though
an excellent specimen in perfect feather, behaved in the strangest
manner. She arrived in the morning and was put in an aviary by
herself, whereupon she retreated to the furthest corner of the flight
and sat on the ground. I gave her the whole day to get her bearings,
but when by the evening she was still in exactly the same place and
obviously hadn't moved, I began to get worried as it seemed she must
either be stunned or ill. She had, of course, eaten nothing, so I went
into the aviary and put some mealworms on the ground just in front
of her. Still no response whatever ; she sat immobile as the Sphinx,
so I retreated from the aviary and just as I was standing with the door
partly open, wondering what to do next, the graven image suddenly
took flight, dashed through the door, and that was the last I ever
saw of female Niltava number one !
Not long afterwards by a great stroke of luck I was able to obtain
another hen, whose behaviour was entirely normal. She and the
cock were given a naturally planted aviary to themselves, and almost
immediately went to nest in a wicker Hartz Mountain Canary cage
hung in the shelter, and soon there were eggs.
Meanwhile, I had arranged to get a supply of gentles and live ant
pupae as soon as necessary, but did nothing further about it as the
hen appeared to have deserted, nearly always, almost from the time
the eggs were laid, being in the flight with the cock whenever one
passed the aviary. I think, however, she must merely have been a very
nervous sitter, and have come off the nest the moment she heard
footsteps. Be that as it may, when I had eventually given up in despair
and decided to look in the nest, it was to find three tiny corpses of

newly-hatched Rufous-bellied Niltavas, which, had they survived,
would, I think, have been the first ever to be bred in this country.
Shortly afterwards the hen died suddenly of a fit. Another time
I would give the parents their liberty as soon as the young ones
hatched, but I am afraid now there is never likely to be another time.

AUSTRALIAN PARROTS IN CAPTIVITY

(51) Rainbow Lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.954328" page_id="56287992"  page_num="218" year="" vol="">
Synonyms. --Blue Mountain Lorikeet, Blue-bellied Lorikeet, Swain-
son's Lorikeet.
Distribution. --Eastern Australia, from Gape York through most of
eastern Queensland and eastern New South Wales, down to Victoria.
Also found in Tasmania and in South Australia, where it extends as
far north as the lower end of the Flinders Range and as far west as
southern Eyre's Peninsula.
Description. --A large Lorikeet, the general colour of the upper
surface being bright green, with a few red flecks on the back of the
neck and a collar of a lighter shade of green. The head and face are
a streaky blue, the breast varies from orange to red, the abdomen is
blue margined with some red, and the thighs and under tail-coverts
are greenish-yellow.
There is very little difference in the colouring of the sexes but the
head and beak are larger in the male. Immatures are only slightly
duller than the adults but they have a dark beak instead of coral red,
as is the case in the adult.
Variations. --I have always thought that the birds derived from
southern Queensland are brighter coloured, especially in regard to the
red of the breast, than the South Australian birds. The birds found
in northern Queensland are also said to be smaller and duller.
Coloured Plates. --Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 14)
is quite good as also is that by Rutledge in Cassell's Book of Birds
(p. 443). Cayley's plate in The Emu (vol. 28, p. 122) is quite adequate
whilst that by Lydon in Greene (vol. i, p. 39) is fair as regards
colouring but very unshapely.
Field Notes. ---This species can almost always be observed in the
vicinity of Victor Harbour, South Australia, at all times of the year.
I have also seen it in the south-east of South Australia and in southern
Queensland. They are noisy birds, both when feeding and in flight.
Aviary Notes. --This species used to be brought down from Queens-
land in large numbers prior to World War II ; since then, however,

very few have appeared in the local birdshops and it has become
comparatively rare in captivity in this state The medal of the A.S.S.A.
for the first recorded breeding of this species was awarded in 1929 to
Dr. W. Hamilton ; since that date the species has been bred on
several occasions in the Adelaide Zoo, as recorded by Minchin in
Cayley's Australian Parrots (p. 324). It is worthy of note that the
incubation period is longer than that of the Australian Parrakeets,
namely about twenty-six days, and that the young remain about
eight weeks in the nest. It has often been observed that the male of
a breeding pair of Lorikeets spends a great deal of time in the nest ;
it is, however, doubtful whether he actually participates in the process
of incubation.
This species can be kept and even bred on a diet of seed alone, but
there seems little doubt that the addition of fruit and bread and milk
provides a more normal diet.
I possessed a pair of these birds for a short time in 1935, but parted
with them as I found them rather aggressive towards the other
inhabitants of a mixed aviary.
(52) Red-collared Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus rubritorquis)
Synonym. --Orange-naped Lorikeet.
Distribution .--The Kimberley district of north-western Australia and
the Northern Territory. It has not been recorded farther east than
Groote Eylandt and the McArthur River in the Gulf of Carpentaria
and the vicinity of Birdum appears to be its approximate southern
limit.
Description. --A large Lorikeet of approximately the same size as the
preceding species and with a generally similar colour pattern. The
upper parts generally are bright green and the head and face are
streaky blue, of a paler shade than in the preceding bird. The breast
and collar are orange red, the abdomen is purplish-black, and the
thighs and subcaudals are greenish-yellow. There is also a patch of
a purple shade below the red collar and some red flecking on the
upper mantle.
The sexes can only be distinguished by the larger head and beak
of the male and the immatures are only slightly duller than the adults
but with brownish instead of orange beaks.
Variations. --No valid subspecies appears to exist.
Coloured Plates. --Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 27)
is good and that by Goodchild in Seth-Smith (p. 4) is even better.
Cayley's plate in The Emu (vol. 28, p. 122) is quite adequate.
Field Notes. --I saw a couple of pairs of this species during a few
hours spent in Darwin late in 1945. Its habits appear to be practically
identical with those of the foregoing bird.

<bodyText confidence="0.9847504375" page_id="56287994"  page_num="220" year="" vol="">
Aviary Notes .--Although previously a rare bird in captivity, a
number have been brought down from the Northern Territory since
the end of World War II and it is now comparatively common in the
state. The medal of the A.S.S.A. was awarded in 1934 to S. Harvey ;
since then it has been bred in the Adelaide Zoo on several occasions
since 1938 and also by R. Rowlands with great consistency. In
Mr. Harvey's case the birds had been in his possession for over twelve
years and had been fed exclusively on Canary and sunflower seeds.
In 1933 they had a clutch of two eggs and hatched the young but
did not succeed in rearing them. The following year the first egg was
laid on 2nd September and the first young bird hatched on 27th of
that month. The first of the two young birds left the nest on 28th
November, both being successfully reared. The habits of this species
in captivity appear to be identical with those of the Rainbow Lorikeet
and, to my mind, there is little doubt that soft food is desirable, though
obviously not essential. I have never kept the species myself.

( 53 ) Scaly-breasted Lorikeet (Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus)
Synonym .--Gold and Green Lorikeet.
Distribution .--From the vicinity of Cairns, in northern Queensland,
down through eastern Queensland into the north-eastern corner of
New South Wales. Its southern limit does not appear to be recorded.
Description .--A medium-sized Lorikeet, the general body colour
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.993798952380952" page_id="56287994"  page_num="220" year="" vol="">
being bright green with a considerable amount of yellow flecking on
the breast, abdomen, and upper mantle and with scarlet under wing
coverts. There is very little difference between the sexes, the larger
beak and flatter head of the male being the most reliable guide.
Immatures are almost identical with adults as regards plumage but
have a dark brownish beak as opposed to the orange of the adults.
Variations .--There do not appear to be any of note.
Coloured Plates .--The plate by Goodchild in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 33)
is excellent, as also is that by Rutledge in Cassell's Book of Birds (p. 427).
Field Notes .--This species is by far the commonest Lorikeet in the
vicinity of Brisbane. Whilst I was stationed there in 1943 it was
observed breeding in the large eucalypts in the camp area. The
birds were usually seen in pairs.
Aviary Notes .--Like the Rainbow Lorikeet, this species was imported
in numbers from Queensland prior to the recent war, but very few
have appeared in the bird shops in recent years ; they used to be fed
by the dealers on maize meal with a little sugar added.
This species was bred in 1935 by W. K. Penney, of Plympton,
South Australia, and this success gained the medal of the A.S.S.A.
The two young birds left the nest on 31st May and were reared to
become independent of their parents. The species has also been bred

in the Adelaide Zoo on a single occasion, in 1946. I am unaware of
any other breeding records for this state.
My personal experience of this bird is confined to a pair acquired
in 1935 ; they were only kept for a few weeks on account of their
aggressive behaviour towards the other occupants of a mixed collection.
It appears to be another of the family that can be kept, in some
instances, for long periods on an exclusive seed diet.
(54) Varied Lorikeet (Psitteuteles versicolor)
Synonym. --Red-capped Lorikeet.
Distribution. --Tropical northern Australia, which includes the
Kimberley district of north-western Australia, the Northern Territory,
and north Queensland on the western side of the Gulf of Carpentaria.
In the Northern Territory it has been recorded as far south as Elliott.
Description. --A small Lorikeet, with red beak, streaky colouring, and
an unusual patch of bare white skin around the eyes. The general
colour is green, which is streaked with yellow on the underparts.
The forehead and crown are red, the back of the head and sides of
the neck are bluish-green, the cheek patches are yellowish-green and
the breast is a peculiar reddish-purple colour with an odd streaked
appearance. The male has the red crown of a deeper shade than the
female and the purplish colouring on the breast is brighter. Immatures
differ considerably from the adults in that all the colouring is duller
and the markings less pronounced ; also, the red cap is replaced by
green with a little red flecking and a small frontal band of the same
colour.
Variations. --There do not appear to be any of note.
Coloured Plates. --Goodchild's plate of a pair in Mathews (vol. vi,
p. 38) is very good and the same artist's plate of an adult and an
immature in Avicultural Magazine (July, 1903, p. 287) is equally
good, but the reproduction of the same drawing in Seth-Smith (p. 255)
is not as good as regards the colouration.
Field Notes. --I have not seen this species in its natural state but it is
said not to differ in habits from those of the other small Lorikeets.
Aviary Notes. --My first meeting with this species in captivity was in
the case of a pair kept prior to the last war by a lady whose husband
had procured them from the Northern Territory. This pair of birds
lived for several years in perfect condition on a diet of sweetened
oatmeal and grapes ; unfortunately, they were never given adequate
nesting accommodation or they might well have bred, as I observed
them perpetrating their amusing display on several occasions. Until
recently, the breeding record at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm in 1936
reported in Avicultural Magazine (1936, pp. 192-3) appeared to
be the only instance of the species having bred in captivity. Thanks

to the courtesy of Mr. L. G. Webber, of Sydney, I now have informa-
tion regarding a recent Australian success. The owner of the birds is
Mr. C. J. Lambert, of Horsley, an outer suburb of Sydney, and they
had been in his possession for almost two years before going to nest
in a small box 8 inches by 6 inches by 5 inches, with a short spout.
Two white eggs were laid on 16th and 18th September, 1949, and
were brooded by the hen only. The young hatched after an incubation
period of twenty-two days and the first left the nest on 16th November ;
both were independent three weeks after leaving the nest. Both
parents fed the young, the food provided being " Weetbix ", milk,
sugar, honey, apple, and thistle. It was noticed that one young bird
had a black beak and the other a pinkish one ; these proved to be
a cock and hen respectively.
This species has never done very well at the Adelaide Zoo, although
eggs were laid in 1948. I have never kept the species myself but other
local aviculturists have had examples in recent years without so far
persuading them to go to nest.
(55) Musk Lorikeet ( Glossopsitta concinna )
Synonym. --Erroneously called King Parrot.
Distribution. --From southern Queensland, through eastern New
South Wales, and most of Victoria to southern South Australia, as
far west as Eyre's Peninsula. Also found in Tasmania.
Description. --A medium-sized Lorikeet, the general body colouring
being a bright green. The forehead and an elongated patch behind
the eye are red, the crown of the head is blue, the mantle is a brownish-
olive, and there is a yellow patch on the side of the breast. In the
male the blue colouring on the crown is more pronounced, otherwise
the sexes are very similar. Immatures are duller in their markings,
especially the red areas, and the beak is dark all over, as opposed to
the orange and black of the adult.
Variations. --None of any merit has been described.
Coloured Plates. --Goodchild's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 46, lower
fig.) is very good but that by the same artist in Seth-Smith (p. 18) is
not quite up to his usual high standard.
Field Notes.--A very common bird in many parts of South Australia.
Although usually seen feeding on flowering eucalypts, I have, on one
occasion, seen the species feeding in vast numbers in ripening wheat
crops. It is also said to be very destructive in orchards on occasions.
Aviary Notes. --Although such a common bird in the wild state, it is
never very freely kept in captivity and it is undoubtedly one of the
Lorikeets which will not often survive long on a diet of seed alone.
The medal of the A.S.S.A. for the first breeding of this species was
awarded to Dr. W. Hamilton in 1930. In the Adelaide Zoo it was

first bred in 1941 and in several subsequent seasons in a hollow in an
old, rotted tree stump.
(56) Purple-crowned Lorikeet ( Glossopsitta porphyrocephala)
Synonym .--Porphyry-crowned Lorikeet.
Distribution. --Throughout most of Victoria and southern South
Australia and westward to southern Western Australia, where it
extends as far north as Moora. It appears to be very doubtful whether
it occurs in New South Wales.
Description. --A small Lorikeet, mainly green on the upper parts and
pale blue on the under surface. There is a broad frontal band which
varies in shade from orange to red and the ear coverts are orange-
yellow in colour. There is a large patch of dark purple on the crown,
the under wing coverts are red and the mantle is olive. I have
never been able to satisfy myself as to sexual differentiation, but Dr. W.
Hamilton assures me that the ear coverts are more orange than yellow
in the male. However, in each of two undoubted pairs that I have
recently examined, the male has a much lighter coloured eye. Whether
this is a constant character or not, remains to be proved. Immatures
are duller generally and completely lack the purple cap.
Variations. --None of consequence described.
Coloured Plates. ---The only coloured plate that I am aware of is an
excellent one by Goodchild in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 46, upper fig.),
but there is a very good black and white drawing by the same artist
in Avigultural Magazine (January, 1913, p. 91).
Field Notes. --The commonest Lorikeet in most parts of South
Australia and, strangely enough, the only member of the family
found in the southern parts of Western Australia. It is easily
recognized in the field by its small size, call note, and the red colouring
under the wings.
Aviary Notes. --Although such a common wild bird, this species has
seldom been kept successfully in captivity for any length of time, and
soft food is undoubtedly essential for its well-being.
The A.S.S.A. medal for the breeding of this species has not been
claimed as yet, but it was bred in 1936 by Mr. J. Gregg, of Croydon.
I well remember taking an overseas dealer (L. Behrend) to see these
birds, and he subsequently purchased the parents and the two young
birds.
Dr. W. Hamilton had young of this species in the nest when he left
for England in 1930, and he hand-reared them successfully aboard
ship. Probably one of the several that he took to England on that
occasion was still on exhibition in the Parrot House of the London
Zoo when I visited it in 1940.
A pair of these birds laid two clutches of two eggs in 1949, in the

collection of Mr. R. W. McKechnie, but the eggs were unfortunately
clear on each occasion.
(57) Little Lorikeet ( Glossopsitta pusilla)
Synonyms. --Tiny Lorikeet, Slit.
Distribution. --Eastern Australia, from Cairns in north Queensland,
down through eastern Queensland and eastern New South Wales
into Victoria and Tasmania. Rare in southern South Australia.
Description. --A small Lorikeet of a uniform bright green colour,
with the exception of the mantle, which is olive, and the forehead and
face, which are scarlet. The sexes do not differ markedly, but the
olive mantle is possibly brighter in the male. Immatures are duller,
especially as regards the red areas.
Variations. --There do not appear to be any.
Coloured Plates. ---As with the last species, the only coloured plate in
existence, apart from that in Gould, is the excellent one by Goodchild
in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 46, middle fig.).
Field Notes. --My first meeting with this species in the field was near
Seymour, Victoria, in 1942, when my attention was drawn to it by
the difference between its call note and that of the Purple-crowned
species, which was also plentiful in the same district. The absence of
red under the wings is also a useful field identification. I subsequently
saw what I took to be this species in the vicinity of Brisbane on several
occasions, but could never be positive of the identification.
Aviary Notes. --This bird is very uncommon in captivity, even in the
eastern states, and I know of only four examples having been kept in
this state. In Mr. R. W. McKechnie's collection, shortly after
World War II, a clutch of two eggs was laid, but the sitting hen was
unfortunately killed by an unmated bird. Mr. N. K. Bush, of Peak-
hurst, a suburb of Sydney, has kindly supplied me with the following
information regarding his successful breeding of this species. The
birds were housed in a half-covered, planted aviary, 15 feet by 7 feet
by 6 feet dimensions. The male bird had been hand-reared, and the
female had been caught, as a young bird, two years previously. They
were the only Parrots in the aviary, but there were also several pairs
of mixed Finches housed therein. The nest was under cover, five feet
from the ground, in a small box measuring 6 inches by 6 inches by
10 inches, with a small hollow log fixed on the front as an entrance.
The box was filled to a depth of two inches with rotted wood, and the
pair spent much time in the box before the hen eventually laid a
clutch of four white eggs late in September, 1948, the exact date
being unknown. Two young birds hatched on 19th October, all the
incubation having been performed by the female, who was fed by the
male ; both birds were very spiteful at this time. Both young birds

left the nest about the middle of November, and were independent
in two weeks. The food provided was " Weetbix ", to which was
added two teaspoonfuls of " Gold Medal 55 condensed milk for each
one and a half biscuits ; boiled water was then added to form a thin
porridge. The hen apparently did all the feeding of the young birds,
and it was subsequently noticed that the birds were eating a little
canary seed. I understand that Mr. Bush was again successful in
breeding these birds in 1949.
(58) Blue-Browed Lorilet ( Opopsitta coxeni)
Synonyms. --Red-faced Lorilet, Coxen's Fig Parrot.
Distribution .---North-eastern New South Wales and southern
Queensland.
Description. --A short-tailed green Parrot, about the size of a Musk
Lorikeet, with a large head and massive black beak, and with yellow
patches on the sides of the breast and red tips to the innermost wing
feathers, the latter two features being found in all species, apparently.
In the male, the ear coverts are red, and there is some red speckling
on the face, whilst the forehead and lower cheeks are blue. The
female is said to have less red on the face and ear coverts, and the
immatures are, as yet, undescribed.
Variations.- ---N one.
Coloured Plates. ---There is an excellent plate of an alleged pair by
Goodchild in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 67, lower figs.) and an adequate
one of a male by Cayley in The Emu (vol. 29, pi. 14).
Field Motes. --I do not think I have seen this species, although I
sometimes wonder whether the birds I identified as Little Lorikeets
in the Brisbane area might have been Fig Parrots. Very little has
been recorded regarding this bird.
Aviary Motes. --There do not appear to be any records of this species
ever having been kept in captivity.
(59) Red-browed Lorilet ( Opopsitta leadbeateri)
Synonyms. --Blue-faced Lorilet, Leadbeater's, McCoy's or Macleay's
Fig Parrot.
Distribution.- --North Queensland in the Cairns and Cardwell
districts.
Description. --A small green Parrot, about the size of a Varied
Lorikeet, with the typical short tail, bulky head, and large black beak.
The other typical characteristics, the yellow patch on the side of the
breast and red tip to the innermost wing feathers, are also evident.
The adult male has a small red patch on the forehead and a large
patch of the same colour on the side of the face, whilst around the eye
and below the red cheek patch are areas of blue. The adult female

has the large red facial area replaced by blue. Immatures are said
to be paler and duller than the adult female.
Variations. --None.
Coloured Plates. --There is a splendid plate of a pair by Goodchild
in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 67, upper figs.) and a reasonably good one of
a male by Cayley in The Emu (vol. 29, pi. 14).
Field Notes. --I have not seen this bird, but it seems to have been
observed more frequently than the preceding species. It apparently
keeps to the tops of fruit trees such as figs, and utters a feeble call only
when in flight.
Aviary Notes.- --Austin and Bourke in The Emu , vol. 46, p. 286, state
that a bird of this species was kept in captivity in Cairns, Queensland.
There does not appear to be any other record.
(60) Marshall's Lorilet (Opopsitta marshalli)
Distribution. --Cape York Peninsula, North Queensland, and
possibly extending to the Aru Islands and Southern New Guinea.
Description. --A typical Fig Parrot, the distinctive marking being,
in the male, a red forehead with a narrow yellow band behind it and
red cheek patches with some blue below them. In the female the
forehead is blue and the cheeks are of a buff shade with blue below
them. The immature is like the female, but exhibits some red on the
face.
Coloured Plate. --That by Medland in The Emu (vol. 46, pi. 1) portrays
the male, female, and immature birds collected by Marshall.
Field Notes. --&amp;apos;The reader is referred to Marshall's description of his
discovery of the bird in The Emu (vol. 47, p. 50). Mayr points out
(pp. 54-5) that the bird described as aruensis is probably identical.
It is of interest to recall that McLennan shot what he believed to be
a Fig Parrot on Cape York Peninsula in 1914, but the specimen was
not recovered ; it seems likely that it was this species.
Aviary Notes. --Obviously this bird has never been kept in captivity,
although aruensis may have been. However, I recently possessed two
females of the closely related species diophthalma , which is found in
New Guinea. My birds survived for over eight months on a diet of
sunflower seed and apple ; I could not persuade them to eat any other
seed, and I did not try them with any soft food. They were not very
attractive aviary birds, being extremely dull and timid ; however,
Boosey, who recently acquired a male, has informed me that his bird
is delightfully tame and has learnt to mimic other Parrots.

Members of the Club, 37 ; guests, 25 ; total, 62.
The Chairman said that it had been the custom of the Club to
entertain guests of honour from various countries on the Continent,
and also from the United States, but to-night for the first time the
guest of honour was a Scot. Sir Norman Kinnear had taken great
interest in the Club since its inception, and the Hon. Secretary had
had the happy idea of combining the appreciation of the Club for his
support with their congratulations on the honour recently conferred
upon him by His Majesty the King. The situation was a unique one,
as till this moment the guest of honour was blissfully unconscious
that he was occupying that position. Sir Norman was a man who
liked to do a great deal of work, but disliked limelight of any sort; it
was therefore realized that if he were invited to attend a B.A.C. dinner
as guest of honour he would find any number of excellent reasons and
excuses why he was not able to do so. Mr. Prestwich had therefore
had the brilliant idea of omitting to state the reason for the invitation,
and for this, the Chairman added, she felt sure that members would
agree, their Hon. Secretary could now claim to equal Mr. Webb in
the art of trapping rare, shy, beautiful--and difficult--species. The
Club was also glad to welcome Sir Norman's two daughters, Miss Sheila
and Miss Elizabeth Kinnear. Another distinguished guest the Club

was honoured to have present was Professor Pandazis from Greece.
Professor Pandazis was Professor of Zoology in the University of
Athens, and Chairman of the Greek Section of the International
Committee for Bird Preservation ; as this was his first visit to England,
the Club was glad to be able to entertain him, and he was also their
first visitor from Greece.
The Chairman said she was particularly pleased that Mr. L. M.
Baker, of the Home Office, was also a guest to-night. Mr. Baker was
the only man in the kingdom who understood the many and compli-
cated bird protection laws, and in his capacity as Secretary of the
Home Office Wild Birds Advisory Committee which was drafting
the new bird protection law, the Avicultural Society would have good
cause to be grateful to him. If the better preservation of birds was
achieved without any harm coming to aviculture, this would no
doubt be largely owing to the diplomatic but firm handling of the
Committee by Mr. Baker.
The Chairman then gave the toast of the guest of honour, Sir Norman
Kinnear.
Sir Norman Kinnear replied, saying how much he appreciated the
honour paid to him by the Club, and added that if he had thought
a little more deeply he would not have walked so easily into the trap
prepared for him.
Professor Pandazis then thanked the Club for their hospitality, and
expressed his great pleasure at being their guest.
A colour sound film of the Cedar Waxwing and American Robin,
lent by the National Film Board of Canada, was then shown. The
film showed the life history of these birds, from the eggs to the flight
of the young birds from the nest, all in excellent quality photography.
Mr. lies then showed his colour film of the Avicultural Society's
visit to Cleres and Paris in May. Most excellent shots of Cleres and
its birds, of the Paris Zoo, and of the various personalities, including
in addition to the British members, Monsieur Delacour, Prince Paul
Murat, Mrs. Benchley, Mademoiselle T. Elsen, and Monsieur Jean
Pierre Derscheid, formed a most attractive, interesting, and entertain-
ing film. In introducing his film Mr. lies apologized for the quality,
explaining that he was an amateur. In thanking him for showing
the film the Chairman asked the members if they did not agree that
the apology was superfluous, as the high quality of the film equalled
that of any professional photographer. The prolonged and loud
applause showed no doubt of the views of the audience.
The next meeting will be held on 8th November, 1950, at 6 p.m.

G. R. Podmore has recently fully reared two Pekin Robins. This
is his fourth success with this species during the past ten years. The
events have taken place in his heavily planted 50 feet by 20 feet aviary.
Don Martin, Auburn, according to the Seattle Sunday Times , has
started a new industry--breeding Black Swans for the restaurant

for their tasty flesh. Deceived by the northern seasons, they lay
twice a year. By 4 stealing 5 a clutch for the brooder, Martin induces
them to lay a third lot. His goal is 200 pair producing for restaurants

Captain A. Clarence writes : 44 My Red-faced Lovebird is herself
sitting on a second clutch of, I believe, three eggs. The previous eggs,
put under a Budgerigar, hatched three out of five. Two chicks were
strong, but feathered very slowly in comparison with one baby
Budgerigar, hatched from the only egg left (as I was so doubtful of the
Lovebird eggs) that the Budgerigar was fully feathered and always
blocking the entrance hole. The foster-parents suddenly stopped
feeding them, and so they died. A pair of Touracous have a nest
near by with eggs, and I believe the hen started sitting to-day, as she
has been on the nest all day."
The appeal for donations to the Coloured Plate Fund has had some
response.
The Council appreciates the action of a number of members who
have sent donations.
The Society is still in need of additional finance to enable it to

By G. S. Webb
The period under review (7th July to 7th September) has seen a lot
more interesting arrivals. Inevitably these will diminish from now
onwards, not only on account of the approaching winter but because !
the Zoo has just about reached saturation point.
In the last five years there has been a great recovery from the effects
of the war years, so that now the Zoo can boast of a better collection
in many departments than ever before.
The following recent additions are of interest :--
A collection of waders was received in exchange from the Copenhagen
Zoo, comprising Greenshanks, Redshanks, Common Sandpipers,
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.4198695">
1 Spotted Redshank, 1 Green Sandpiper, Ruffs and Reeves, and
3 Iceland Gulls. Surprisingly enough the Zoo had never before
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.992927533333333" page_id="56288004"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">
exhibited a Greenshank. The Iceland Gulls bring our number of
species of the Laridce up to 8.
With the above arrived two Sun-bitterns ( Eurypyga helms )--the first
since the war. A few days later we acquired two more from Mr. K.
Smith, who has recently returned from a collecting trip in British
Guiana. These birds are always interesting to watch on account of their
swaying movements and their displays with outspread wings. Few
birds get more tame. One I possessed many years ago in British
Guiana I used to put on a lawn early every morning and there it would
roam around all day, making its peculiar soft cries and stalking insects---
principally grasshoppers. In the evening I used to pick the bird up and
put it in a shed. It was full-winged but never attempted to fly or
wander away. Sun-bitterns are not related to the true Bitterns but
belong to a group of aberrant waders--the Kagus, Courlans, and
Mesites--which have some affinities with the Granes.
Mr. Smith also brought us 2 Green-backed Herons ( Butorides
striatus) . This tiny heron is of interest if only on account of its extra-
ordinary distribution. It is scattered widely in South America, Africa,
Australia, India, Ceylon, Malay, China, Japan, and many tropical
islands, especially in the Far East. I have found it very plentiful in the
reed-beds of Lake Alaotra, Madagascar. There are many geographical
races, but all are now recognized as belonging to the same species.
Other birds from Mr. Smith were 1 Tricolor Heron ( Hydranassa
tricolor ), 1 Large-billed Hawk ( Asturina magnirostris) , and 1 White-
throated Falcon (Falco albigularis) . The latter is beautifully marked
with black and chestnut and is not much larger than a Mistle Thrush.
From Ceylon Zoo we received by air 4 White-breasted Kingfishers
(.Halcyon smyrnensis) and 4 Indian Darters (. Anhinga melanogaster) . The
latter have a curious way of submerging and often only their long
snake-like necks can be seen moving along above the surface while

their bodies are out of sight. They can move under water faster than
a Cormorant and catch their fish by spearing them.
Several interesting additions have been made to our birds of prey
aviaries, including 1 Griffon Vulture, 5 White-backed Vultures,
1 Tawny Eagle, 1 Martial Hawk-eagle, and one Booted Eagle. A
couple of Comb-ducks or Knob-billed Ducks ( Sarkidiornis melanotos )
arrived from West Africa and are the first for very many years. We
had the good fortune to aquire the two species of Red-breasted Marsh-
birds (. Leistes) within a few days of each other. The Guiana or Cayenne
Red-breasted Marshbird (L. militaris ) we have often had in the past,
but the other-- the Argentine Red-breasted Marshbird (L. superciliaris )--
is new to our collection. The latter can be easily identified by its
prominent eye-stripe.
From East Africa we recently received six examples of the Vulturine
Guineafowl ( Acryllium vulturinum). Although these birds are bare-
headed they are perhaps the most striking of the guineafowl--having
plumage of a blue which is quite startling in its intensity. The breast
feathers are long and pointed and are black with white pencilling in
the centre and edged with blue.
Vulturine Guineafowl are inhabitants of the driest parts of East
Africa and have suffered much of recent years through the locust
campaigns. The locusts are blotted out with arsenical preparations and
then the guineafowl devour the poisoned insects with fatal results to
themselves.
A collection of eighty-six small birds was sent in exchange from the
Pretoria Zoo. They all arrived alive. Some old favourites were among
them, such as Violet-eared, Black-cheeked, Blue-breasted, and
St. Helena Waxbills ; Alario, Red-headed, Scaly-fronted, and Melba

AVICULTURE AND ORNITHOLOGY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993892075471698" page_id="56288006"  page_num="232" year="" vol="">
With reference to the current controversy Ornithology v. Aviculture in these
columns, may I be allowed to express my views.
Since an early age I have been a keen lover of birds both in the field and in
captivity and have kept a large number of both English and foreign species, including
Pheasants, which are my particular interest. Since the war unfortunately I have
been unable to keep anything due to lack of suitable accommodation, but as my
recent efforts with the Pheasant Registry show, I am still a very enthusiastic
aviculturist and hope I may take up the hobby again in the near future. But, as
I have stated above, I am also a lover of birds in the wild, and so my odd moments
are taken up (and were before the war) by expeditions into the surrounding country-
side where I can study these creatures in their natural state. Until a few months
ago I was secretary to our local Ornithologists' Club, but was forced to give it up
due to pressure of work in other spheres, which was a great disappointment. Some
of your correspondents may now say " Ah ! but this person must be of private means
and have all the time in the world to devote to these two pursuits ". Worse luck,
I am not, and have to put in the usual 5 J day working week and also do my share
of the chores at home (yes, I am a family man !), but I can always find time to stay
a moment to study a bird in its haunts and gain a fragment of knowledge. All this
previous experience has helped me as follows :--
(a) The keeping of British birds in captivity has enabled me as an ornithologist to
identify most species found in this locality (over 120 have been recorded in recent
years) by their song alone and many by their flight or similar characteristics.
Should I ever travel abroad, in the Services for instance, the same would apply,
plus, of course, a knowledge of the plumage, etc., seen at close quarters, to assist me.
( b ) The study of birds in the field has provided me with those details of feeding,
courtships, nesting sites, and a great wealth of other information which are of help
to me as an aviculturist in tending my charges. This again could apply as in (a)
should I go abroad.
I therefore have no hesitation in supporting the Editor in stating that aviculture
and ornithology can and should go hand in hand. A true lover of birds, no matter
what his special fancy, should find interest in all birds. I do.
Further, I would ask this, where does the aviculturist first obtain details of keeping
and breeding his birds ? From books, or from an experienced fancier who, in turn,
obtained his information from books. And the authors of these books, whence came
their information ? Either they acquired it in the field or from scraps of news in
various books and journals, so if it were possible to trace the history of data concerning
any one family I think it would be found that the ornithologist first gave details o#
for instance, the natural foods (perhaps the major concern of the aviculturist when
making up a substitute), also nesting sites, etc., all of prime importance to the serious
breeder. Surely then the aviculturist can return the compliment by giving particulars,
still unrecorded in the various monographs, of the life of his birds in captivity.
M. Delacour has stressed this point in regard to Pheasants.
With regard to " splinter " societies, they come and they go ! People these days
cannot afford subscriptions to various specialist societies and so one or the other must
lose membership. It is a case of " United we stand ..." and the Avicultural Society
caters for all, so it is up to the members themselves to provide the material wanted
and not rely on the same familiar names which yearly do their best to keep the
magazine full of interest. I might mention that certain weekly periodicals are always
giving details of sizes of aviaries and inmates in an aviary, to help the amateur ;
whilst we do not want to be a scientific society in the true sense of the word let us
keep the slightly higher plane that has been such a good feature in the past. I should
perhaps state that this is not meant to be snobbery but a plea to give a higher grade
of information and experiences than is found in such periodicals.

By Gerald T. Iles
The last reference in the Avicultural Magazine to the birds at the
Manchester Zoo appeared thirty years ago, when Dr. Graham
Renshaw contributed an article. Although the general zoological
collection is one of the most important in the country, the bird section
is not as large as I would wish, and this is probably due to the fact that
a separate bird house has never existed. I look forward to the day when
building restrictions are lifted and it is possible to construct a separate
house for the smaller birds, as well as new flight aviaries, crane
paddocks, and other necessary features.
The most recent addition to the bird section is the " Hall of Living
Jewels ", which is situated in the Paddock House, and is screened off
to form a separate feature. Opened early in 1949, this exhibit contains
eleven cages of varying size and it was designed to house Humming
Birds, Sun Birds, and other small birds of brilliant plumage. When
we opened the Jewel Hall we were quite unable to obtain Hummers,
possessed only a few Sun Birds, and so had to fill up with other attractive
small birds such as Long-tailed Grass Finches, Violet-eared Waxbills,
and Whydahs.
The show cages are glass-fronted and are lined with cream-coloured
plastic. Above each show cage is a smaller cage of wire-netting which
is not seen by the public. In order to clean the former the glass tops
are pulled back on a slide and the birds can then fly into the smaller
cages above. Artificial lighting was used almost exclusively at first and
the birds thrived quite well---one pair of Spice Birds were left in their
cage for the whole period of twenty months that the Jewel Hall has
been in operation and they still looked in splendid condition at the end
of this time.
We are now gradually changing over to daylight, as the birds will
look even better under natural light, and plants--which are an impor-
tant part of the exhibit--will also thrive all the better. I think I should

GERALD T. ILES---BIRD COLLECTION AT MANCHESTER
mention here that of course only the bird cages are illuminated, the
public hall being in darkness.
On 11 th August last I went to Liverpool to meet Mr. Kenneth
Smith, who had arrived from British Guiana with a miscellaneous col-
lection of livestock. On the quayside I noticed a packing case containing
five Humming Birds. As nobody appeared to want them I bought the
lot and hiring a taxi conveyed my prizes to Manchester.
For the first six weeks I kept the Hummers in my office in order that
I could improve their condition (not that they were in bad condition
on arrival--far from it), and also so that I could study the birds at close
quarters. There were frequent fights, and I often became alarmed when
two of the birds would crash together in mid-air. Fortunately no
serious harm was done, but I decided that it would be best to split up
the birds at the earliest possible moment.
During the period in which they were kept in my office I often heard
their song which consisted of a high-pitched warbling note. I also
observed that whenever I put my hand inside the cage to change the
food or flowers they uttered a quick " chip-chip-chip " sound during
flight.
The cage in which the Hummers had travelled was a converted
packing-case having the front covered with fine-mesh netting. The
door was small and very inconveniently placed for catching up the
birds, and since I wanted to avoid using a net, I had a special trap
cage made and fitted this on to the front of the case, turning back part
of the netting to allow the birds to fly in and out as they wished. In
this way I could easily isolate the particular birds that I wanted to
transfer to new quarters.
Unfortunately one bird quickly wilted and died after removal. I was
extremely busy at the time and was therefore unable to carry out a post-
mortem until it was too late, but I believe that the casualty was a hen.
At first I was not certain about the identity of the Hummers, but
with the help of Mr. G. S. Webb I am now almost sure that they
are Agyrtria whitelyi, pictured in a coloured plate in Chubb's
The Birds of British Guiana. They are not among the most colourful of
the Humming Birds, but nevertheless they are very beautiful. I believe
that I have both sexes, for two individuals are more brilliant than the
other two, which are possibly a hen and an immature cock. The cocks
have the head and mantle metallic emerald green, which contrasts with
the pure white chin, breast, and abdomen. The back is bronze-green
and the wings and tail are brown. The hen is similar to the cock, except
that she has fewer metallic green feathers, while the underparts are
off-white. I have also noticed one of the cocks erecting the metallic
green feathers on the crown of the head into a miniature crest.
I still retain a keen interest in the Humming Birds and give them as
much of my time as possible. I always spend an hour with them each

night when I give them their last feed of the day. I consider this late
feeding to be of extreme importance to their well-being. In order to
allow the birds sufficient time in which to take their last feed the lighting
system has been arranged on a time switch which cuts out at about
10.30 p.m., and restores the light at 6.30 a.m. the next morning.
I suppose that everyone who keeps Humming Birds has their own
pet theory on the question of feeding. Readers may be interested in the
method adopted with our birds, which so far has appeared to be entirely
satisfactory.
They are fed three times each day, early morning, noon, and as I
have already mentioned, last thing at night. Kenneth Smith informed
me that the birds had been fed with Mellin's Food and honey on the
voyage home, so I decided to offer them a choice of two mixtures during
the day and one at night. The day mixtures are as follows : No. 1, one
level teaspoonful each of Mellin's Food, Nestle's milk, honey, and
glucose, with the addition of either a little Bovril or Marmite (the
amount equal to the head of a match), these ingredients mixed with a
cupful of boiling water. Mixture No. 2 is similar to No. 1 with the
exception of the Nestle's milk. At night only mixture No. 2 is given.
In addition to the above the birds consume quantities of drosophila
(fruit flies) which they take on the wing. To watch a Hummer open its
bill to engulf a fly is a wonderful experience and not a little startling in
the first instance.
I give the birds a bath at least once every day by directing a very
fine spray of tepid water on to a convenient twig, and the Hummers
will fly into this artificial " rain " and show every sign of thoroughly
enjoying themselves. One bird will now perch 3 inches away from
me and will remain in the " beam " of the spray until almost com-
pletely drenched, after which it will fly away and rub against the plush-
like leaves of Jacobinia. Plants and flowers are changed regularly, and
it is absolutely enchanting to watch one of the Humming Birds hovering
around the flowers of a begonia or a fuchsia.
I am expecting to obtain more Humming Birds in the near future,
and I shall not be content until I have as many of these delightful little
birds as our accommodation will permit.
We have a cock Superb Sun Bird in the Jewel Hall which has been
on almost constant exhibition for the period that the house has been
open, but he will not be seen to advantage until the present artificial
illumination over his cage has been replaced by daylight.
At the back of the exhibition cages we have a hen Scarlet-chested
Sun Bird which our Bird Overseer, Mr. A. Martin, presented to the
Zoo when he joined the staff in 1946. This bird has been in captivity
for eighteen years and is still in perfect feather. She is very tame and
her great delight each night is to be fed with mealworms. The
Sulphur-breasted Tyrant-bird in the next cage neatly decapitates a

mealworm and Sheila the Sun Bird removes the contents with the aid
of her tongue, often perching on my finger to do so. The way in which
this bird watches my every movement and chirrups until her turn
arrives is most engaging. Sun and Humming Birds are among the
most attractive and interesting birds it is possible to keep.
During this night feeding I have been amused by a Red-billed
Toucan which watches the feeding of the Hummers, Sun Birds, and my
pet Kinkajou with every sign of annoyance. He does everything except
stand on his head to attract my attention, making a continuous
" whining " noise all the while. This bird is recuperating from a
damaged wing. It happened in this way---I have a pair of Great Ant-
eaters in a large cage and I thought that a Toucan would mix in very
well. A Sulphur and White-breasted Toucan was introduced, and
except for a little fright on the part of the Ant-eaters when the bird
first flapped its wings the three settled down splendidly. After several
months together I would say that the Toucan is well prepared to stand
up to the Ant-eaters if necessary, and when he plays on the great logs
which lie on the floor of the cage he will snap his beak angrily if either
of the mammals approach too closely. The success of this venture made
me decide to try the Red-billed Toucan in the same cage as w r ell, but
the Ant-eaters would have none of him and pounced upon him
immediately he was introduced into their cage, resulting in the slight
damage to the wing.
The parrots form the largest single group of birds in the collection
and are mostly housed in the old Parrot House, which was built,
I believe, almost one hundred years ago. The old and original octagonal
side cages are soon to be replaced with larger and more modern cages
to house the African Greys, Amazons, and some of the Cockatoos. In
the Amazon Parrots the Blue-fronts easily predominate, but we also
have the Green-cheeked, Yellow-fronted, Red-fronted, and Festive.
The Cockatoos include Leadbeater's, Greater and Lesser Sulphur-
crested, Ducorp's, and the Roseate. The Parrakeets include the
Alexandrine, Ring-necked, and Red-rumped. A cock Ring-necked
Parrakeet was presented to us in December, 1943, and was placed in
the large flight aviary in the Parrot House. The bird appeared normal
in every way at first, but in the summer of 1947 it moulted out with a
sprinkling of pure yellow feathers. Successive moults have increased
the number of yellow feathers in the bird's plumage, so that to-day it
is almost a pure lutino.
Other birds in the parrot group are a Yellow-backed Lory and what
I believe is a hybrid between Swainson's and the Red-collared Lorikeet.
In the Parrot House we also have various other birds as well as a few
mammals. A Laughing Kingfisher, or Kookaburra, arrived in 1921
and is still in excellent voice, although I do not think that it laughs so
frequently as it used to do. On viewing present world affairs this is not,

perhaps, surprising. I have already told how I found that kingfishers
like grapes--a fact which I discovered quite by accident, and which
I have not noticed as being mentioned in any reference works on these
birds.
Another bird of interest in this house is the cinnamon variety of the
common Jackdaw. This has been in the collection for the past eight
years.
The birds of prey are chiefly housed in a row of cages on the outside
of the Camel and Giraffe House. Here are fine pairs of the Nubian or
Northern Lappet-faced Vulture and Ruppell's Griffon Vulture. The
Bateleur Eagle arrived from Kenya as an immature specimen and it
always greets me when I pass the cage by displaying in the manner
shown in the accompanying plate. Also in these cages are an Abyssinian
Tawny Eagle, a Long-crested Hawk Eagle (the only specimen I have
ever seen of this magnificent bird), an Augur Buzzard, a Red Kite, and
a pair of Kestrels.
Owls include a Milky Eagle-Owl, a pair of White-faced Scops Owls,
and a Woodford's Owl. I must also mention a pair of Tawny Owls
which we received as fledgelings in 1949. Having no room to exhibit
these birds I decided to release them in the Zoo grounds, and this was
done in August, 1949. The birds stayed close to the spot where they
were released and for some time the staff fed them each day. Gradually
the owls fended for themselves, but they have remained tame, and
when I wander through the grounds at night I often approach to within
a yard or so of where they are perching without causing them the
slightest alarm.
Other birds of note are the Black-footed or Jackass Penguins, which
share an enclosure with two White Pelicans, a pair of Red-breasted
Geese, and a Crested Curassow which is delightfully tame, and some-
times leaves its own enclosure to forage in an adjoining paddock con-
taining a trio of Sitatunga. Another enclosure contains Peafowl,
Demoiselle and Grey-necked Crowned Cranes, a pair of Crested
Curassows, and a Red-legged Partridge which surprisingly was picked
up in Smithfield Market in the centre of Manchester.
A circular island near the Peafowl enclosure is the home of a number
of Flamingoes, together with various ornamental duck, including the
Mandarin, Carolina, Pintail, and Bahama Pintail.
I have not by any means dealt with all the birds in our collection,
to do so would be to make this article seem even more like a catalogue
than it does at present, but I have contented myself with mentioning
those which I hope will interest the majority of readers.

By The Duke of Bedford
When moving the remnants of my Parrakeet collection from
Haywards Heath to Woburn, I decided to leave some of the more
delicate and valuable birds temporarily in the care of a friend in the
hope that he might be able to increase the stock during the summer
of 1950.
At Woburn, therefore, I have had little but rather familiar birds,
which I and others have bred on several occasions. Bearing in mind
the fact that a few choice pairs were handicapped by great age and
increasing infertility, the breeding results have been quite fair.
A nice pair of Brown's Parrakeets started to come into breeding
condition in March. In April they became afflicted with the
uncertainty common in their species as to the time to be selected for
moulting, but fortunately in May the right decision was finally arrived
at, and the hen laid seven eggs in a hanging nest-box in the flight,
and hatched and reared five nice young ones, two cocks and three
hens. For a time they toyed with the idea of a second brood, but
finally dropped into moult.
The only other pair of typical Broadtails--Barnards, hung about
for some time, possibly by reason of the beastly weather. Finally
the hen laid six eggs in a grandfather clock box, and hatched and
reared three young ones--two cocks and a hen. There was no second
nest.
A couple of Little Bluebonnets unfortunately turned out to be two
hens, and of course were madly anxious to breed, from March to
July ! They both made proposals of marriage to me, but, strange to
say, displayed no jealousy of one another !
A very old pair of Pileated Parrakeets I had received long before
the war. After the habit of ancient birds, the hen laid a small clutch
very late in the year, after her mate had begun to moult. She then
fell ill and died.
Two out of three pairs of Rock Peplar Parrakeets bred successfully,
as recorded in another article.
A pair of Barrabands laid only two eggs, and hatched and reared
a young cock.
A pair of Crimson-wings had four eggs and reared the two young
hatched. They were the first non-rickety Crimson-wings I have
ever reared. Although conditions were identical, and more than one
pair was involved, all the Crimson-wings I bred at Binstead, Havant,
and Haywards Heath left the nest rickety, although they improved
after a time.
Many cock Crimson-wings are the worst of husbands, and the
idlest of fathers. My present cock, by comparison, is quite

domesticated. It is true that he responded to his wife's first requests
that he should feed her, with a volley of oaths, but anything less
would have been unnatural in a male of his species. When she started
to sit, he relented, and fed her quite regularly and even, for her
entertainment, chewed up bits of grass and walked as though he were
the worse for drink--which is the Crimson-wing's method of display !
Even more surprising, he helped to feed the children when they left
the nest. Perhaps it was this unusually happy home atmosphere that
warded off rickets !
A pair of Green-winged Kings made heroic but unavailing efforts to
produce a family. They are very old birds, the hen having been
many years at the Zoo. She laid three clutches of eggs, but all were
infertile or got cracked, either because the shells were thin, or because
the cock spent a lot of time in the nest hoping that a family would
appear.
The Derbyans are also a very old pair, the cock having spent many
years in a Zoo parrot cage. The hen laid and incubated two clutches,
but the eggs were clear.
A pair of blue Indian Ringnecks were received in the early winter
through the kindness of Mr. Ezra. The cock was adult, but the hen
only a last year's bird. The cock came into breeding condition, and
the hen tried to, but, by reason of her youth, could not quite 44 make
it " ! They are the same pretty, soft shade as a blue Alexandrine,
and the cock has the same white ring, the black 44 moustachial "
markings being retained. The pair are decidedly timid and do not
seem to have been kept long in captivity in India.
A very old albino Roseate Cockatoo, mated to her grey son, failed
to lay ; I think she is past breeding.
The grey hen mated to the above cock's brother, though she bred
last year, disgraced herself this season by breaking all her eggs in
the log or laying them from the perch.
An ordinary grey hen I mated to a cock from the Zoo. This old fellow
had spent so many years walking up and down a perch in a Parrot
cage, and saying, 44 Hullo cocky ! " that at first he seemed rather
bewildered to find himself sharing a spacious aviary with an agreeable
lady of his species. However, he was a family man at heart. The
appearance of a nest delighted him beyond measure, and he took to
it at once. I cannot positively state that he laid the eggs, but he
certainly appeared to do everything else--all the preparation of the
nest, all the sitting, and all the feeding of the two young ! The
only duty his wife appeared to consider that she was called upon to
perform was to help the children with their toilet when they were
fledged !
A pair of Gang-gang Cockatoos also went to nest. Before marriage
each was a gentle and affectionate pet. After embarking upon

matrimony the pair became confirmed man-eaters, and one entered
the aviary, if not at the risk of one's life, at any rate at the risk of
losing one's ears and nose ! It is curious how marriage spoils the
tempers of some Parrot-like birds, and not others. Tame Roseates
usually remain friendly with humans, and so do some tame hen Grey
Parrots. Amazons, on the contrary, and many cock Greys become
absolute devils, and attack their owners at sight. Two very nice
young Gang-gangs have just left the nest. The hen is slightly darker
than her mother. The cock's head is mainly red, but he has some
grey on the cheeks. The first day out of the nest the young birds were
clumsy and got stuck on the wire or fell to the ground. Using my
fingers as a bait, I lured the parents into the shelter and shut them in.
Their rage at finding me in the aviary flight was terrific, and their
language awful ! I fixed up a lot of extra branches, and coaxing the
youngsters on to a stick, I transferred them to a comfortable perch,
a procedure they accepted sensibly enough. The family reunion
was rather pretty, the anxious parents greeting their offspring with
little, gentle cries of affection and relief.

BREEDING NOBLE MACAWS IN CALIFORNIA

I have read with great interest the article in the Avicultural
Magazine, carried in its January-February, 1950, issue, regarding
Noble Macaws and find my observations to be quite in accordance
therewith generally.
I secured a pair of Noble Macaws about September, 1949, from an
old couple that used to allow them to breed, but due to illness in the
family and the extreme old age of the owners, they were not permitted
to breed for a season or two ; in fact they were quite pets of this old
couple and were taught to talk and were very good talkers while with
them. I have not, however, insisted on keeping them talking as I was
more interested in the possibilities of rearing some young.
The original habitat of these birds I know not, nor have I been able
to find any authentic data on them, but as I mentioned above I have
had them but a short time and I am now searching for texts that may
enlighten me on their origin. But books on parrots are quite as scarce
as some of the parrots themselves ; however, I shall continue my
quest hoping to locate something that will enlighten me on their
derivation.
I released these birds into their pen on 1 st September or thereabouts
and a nest box was in place at that time. They made themselves quite
at home but did not act as though the nest box was there and did not,

to my knowledge, enter it until in December when they became very
interested and the hen would be seen in and out of the nest until New
Year's day she disappeared to take over the task of hatching the eggs.
She would be. seen from time to time out of the nest but for just a few
fleeting glances and she would be back in the nest out of sight. I did
not seek the progress of the incubation as I was too glad to have her
sitting to take a chance on breaking her up from her task. Thus I do
not know actually when she started to sit in earnest nor do I know
exactly when the young hatched, but it was on the 5th February that
I first heard the young and on 17th March the first young left the nest,
fully feathered and very able to move about to suit himself. There
was still one young in the nest and the old birds faithfully cared for
it and I was very anxious about its condition as they continued to
feed it and it would call regularly for its food, but did not appear at
the nest opening as did the first one ; so after an additional four weeks
of suspense I opened the nest and took the young one out. To all
intents and purposes it seemed quite normal and I am at a loss to
know why it was so slow in developing, except possibly it may have
been the victim of an inferiority complex and backward. The other
young may have been the more aggressive and therefore ate most
of the food offered and thus caused the retarded development.
It was very weak of foot and wing when removed from the nest but
it was very plump and I well understand why it would be weak in foot
and wing after being confined for so long. The second one was taken
from the nest on the 12th April and during ten days it grew very strong
of foot. I placed a few bare boughs in the pen so it has to climb over
them and it has a very strong grip in its feet and it is now trying to
fly and is doing a very good job of it too.
The colouring of my birds is noticeably different in the two sexes.
The male is a shade darker than the hen and also the iris of the male's
eye is darker than that of the female, otherwise they are the green and
blue as mentioned in the Magazine but with a decided golden bronze
sheen on the general green colouring. But I too wish to mention that
the colouring of the feet and mandibles of mine are at a variance with
the Magazine report, but the colouring of those parts often vary with
birds from short distance separation of habitat. The colouring of the
feet and mandibles in my birds is a walnut brown or sort of a reddish
brown and the little birds' feet and mandibles quite a lot darker than
their parents though the one that has been out of the nest the longer
will soon have the same colouring as the parents.
When this pair are resting on the perch they do so many motions
in unison as if they had been trained so to do upon a certain cue.
They will turn their heads left or right and start to preen their feathers,
pick their toes, scratch the heads with their feet and in this mimicry
they utter a guttural note at the first move made, in fact the sound
</bodyText>

seems to set off the act. It is very amusing to see them sitting quietly,
then all of a sudden they will make the little sound, both will turn
their heads to one side or the other and maybe lift a wing and act as
if to be arranging some of the underwing feathers. But it is just a mimic
for no sooner do they lift their wing in the act than they bring their
heads back to the front and start from the same position and make the
same little sound and lift their right or left foot and start to pick their
toes. They say that the Blue Mt. Lorikeets are the monkeys of the
bird family but these Noble Macaws have certain acts that certainly
appear as though they were trained so to do. I have the Lorikeets
and they are very interesting but their antics are entirely of a different
trend.
Upon receipt of these birds they were very tame ; they could be
handled and would come to one readily but after the nesting started
they reverted to a more protective nature. In fact they are at this time
very vicious, especially in the late evening shadows, for at that time
they will fly right at my head and hang on the wire snapping their
mandibles and I know they mean business for on one occasion I
entered the pen near the end of day and the hen attacked me and
punctured my arm in several places. The occurrence reminded me of
hatidling bees in cold weather when they cling so tenaciously that
when you try to brush them off they just transfer to your hand ; and
so it was the Macaw hen as when I tried to remove her from my arm
she would grab my hand and by the time I freed myself I had been
bitten many times (no parrot fever yet from the wounds, ha ha), and
I am now waiting to see if they will be the same mild mannered birds
that I remember them at the outset.
In my observations since the little ones have left the nest I have
been very much impressed with the behaviour of the male. So often
the male seems to fight the young after they are able to leave the nest
but in the case of my Noble Macaws the male seems to give the hen
the most trouble and never has he molested the young. I might also
mention at this juncture that the male bird did all the feeding of the
young after they left the nest and after this late period he still feeds
the little one which is still partly incapacitated and has treated both
young kindly. He will get in a terrific battle with the hen so it seems
but she is well able to defend herself and thus far no feathers have
flown so just how much of a battle had taken place one does not know
but it is sure that they do a lot of squawking and flopping around. As
they were starting to nest I noticed too that the male bird was rather
pugnacious towards the hen but that subsided as the nesting began
and it may be that they are a double brooded type of bird and they are
getting ready to mate again, though there is nothing else to point
towards another mating at this late date. The hen has no abdomen
of a bird ready to mate nor does she feed as though she were wanting

to nest again but all the signs I have observed in this short time could
go for naught and I be made out a prevaricator, but time will decide
it all.
Time, as I mentioned above, has been short since I possessed these
birds, but I have observed one trait peculiar thus far to the male only
and I will report the act for what it may be worth. The male will
stretch his neck forward contacting the perch with the upper portion
of his mandible at the very tip and then draw his head in to his body
as if to scribe a straight line on the perch. But as his head gets back to
its normal position in front of him, instead of raising his head and
straightening up he will strike the perch with the back of his upper
mandible several times as if to jar his brains loose and as he strikes
with the back of his upper mandible his head is well under his body and
one might describe him as having his head between his legs but the
head during this knocking act is not that far beneath him. He may
repeat the act three or four times in rapid succession and there is as
far as I can see no certain time nor reason for the act and thus far
I have not seen the hen do this. You will recall how the red and blue
Rosella will approach the nest opening and place their mandible
against the nest box as if to see if any vibration exists, well this act
of the Noble Macaw male is executed with the same area of the upper
mandible, between the cere and the curve of the upper mandible.
The bumping is not light, it really clicks against the perch, but the
reason for the act is not certain to me ; it may be to impress the hen with
" What a hard head I have 55 or it may be that the particular one
I have is very intelligent and has found out that he can thus loosen his
brains or has some sort of advanced asthma. However, as humorous
as it may seem, he does it regularly and as the hen has not been
observed doing so it may be a male trait.
The weakling has become noticeably stronger and can now fly
quite well, and thus I am more convinced than ever now that the
other young took most of the food offered by the adults and this little
one was in a semi-starved condition. I am very glad that I did not
remove him before the fourth week for in so doing I might have
caused the old birds to abandon him entirely, but by leaving him in
the original nest they continued to feed him and thus he has come
along quite surprisingly. I took the other young out of the pen at the
same time that I took the weak one out of the nest so that the weak
one would get the undivided attention of the adults, but I am quite
certain that only the male fed the young ; at least he is the only one
that fed them after they both left the nest box.
One evening the adult female was battling the young weak one
and thus I was compelled to remove the young one. I put it in the
pen where the other young one was and it was quite a sight to see them
get together. They acted as if they were human and had not seen one

another for several years. The able-bodied one just nuzzled the other
one and seemed so relieved to see it and it is just those acts together
with the apparent appropriate choice of time to speak and the choice
of words used that make the parrot seem quite human.
These are my observations over a short period of time of this truly
Noble Macaw : some of the acts of these birds and observed as I have
reported could not have been concocted just of their desire to amuse
me, but in my opinion are quite characteristic of them and I certainly
would like to learn of others that have had these interesting birds in
captivity.

Breeding results have not been very good. I sold' my Browns X
Mealy cock and his Stanley wife to Mr. Vane--the last I heard of
them the cock had been trying to murder the hen--and I don't know
what he has done with them this season. Of their four young I sold
one cock to Mr. Thomas at Dunsfold---who doesn't breed. One was
murdered by me--I was catching up a bird and he got into a panic
and concussed himself. The hen is now with Percy Glover paired to
one of my Rosella x Stanley cocks with whom she took up after her
brother's death. The third best coloured cock is still here and has
moulted out into a very handsome bird with just a bit of all three
ancestors. I am now replete with hybrids and he has been running
with a hen Pennant X Rosella bred last summer at the Zoo. They
haven't nested this year and are not a very well matched pair but
they seem quite fond of each other and unless anything else turns up
I shall give them an aviary next year and see if we can rear some
quintuple hybrids.
I had put up for breeding an unrelated pair of Rosella Stanley
hybrids, the hen bred here and the cock by Mr. Jones, of Llandrindod
Wells. They are a very nicely matched pair (both 1948) and as they
both have very yellow cheeks and he has an almost yellow abdomen
I am hoping they will produce a young one with the yellow Stanley
cheek and the Rosella red chest and yellow abdomen which would be
a very handsome combination. But she laid rather early and got
upset by the cold spell in April and the clutch she incubated were all
clear. As this is the first attempt I shall try them again another year.
Exactly the same fate befell her brother, a most magnificently
coloured bird with white Rosella cheeks (only the faintest smudge of
yellow beyond) and a scarlet chest and abdomen. He has been
mated to a rather coy and nervous hen Rosella X Adelaide which

I hoped might result in maintaining the white cheek and wholly red
underparts. She laid in mid-April also and sat on three eggs almost
full time when I took them away (she had broken one) : with indecent
haste she laid six more and sat on them but they were all clear. Very
disappointing.
My pair of Redrumps have had to share an aviary with some of
last years non-breeding birds and were only given a nest box in a
comer of the flight late in the season and only reared one hen. They
are a devoted couple but the cock is not a very robust bird. However,
all their eggs were fertile but three died in shell and one in nest.
My old pair of cock Rosella and his Stanley wife did their best to
make up for the other's deficiencies by laying six eggs, hatching them
all and rearing&amp;apos; them all, and a very nice six youngsters too. But then
she wisely never lays until the second week in May.
I have also three odd birds, a 1949 Rosella X Stanley hen, who
unlike her elder sister has no yellow cheek. A 1948 cock Rosella X
Stanley, own nest brother to the Adelaide's husband but quite different
in that he has very yellow cheeks and red underparts, in effect a large
pure Stanley. I lent this cock to a neighbour to pair with a Stanley
hen whose husband had died. She laid eight eggs all fertile, hatched
five, but they all died in nest : she then laid six more, I believe all
fertile, but deserted and the cock was returned to me last month. At
least he is fertile which is more than I can say of my pairs for certain.
And finally a G. M. Rosella cock I bred here in 1948.
So I have twenty parrakeets.

When I first came out I made a rash request asking members if
I could bring back anything for them. Since then I have discovered
that postings are made by the head office without bothering about
my entourage. I may have boxes of birds and animals which won't
squeeze into the car, and they either have to be released or handed
over to another European, most of whom prefer something in a bottle
to something in a cage. Since coming up here to Zaria Province,
I have lived for the last seven months in the bush in orchard savannah
country ; that is high grass interspersed with trees up to twenty-five
and thirty-five feet in height ; now and again there is a " kurmi "
which can be called " high forest These are strips surrounding
water courses, and the moister ravines. The local inhabitants are
extremely bad at catching birds except for a few small boys, who have
a rather ingenious and simple way of catching anything from a Guinea-
fowl to a Waxbill, so long as it feeds on the ground. They make
twenty or thirty pellets of clay about the size of an ordinary marble
(thumb-nail) into these balls they insert nooses made of horse, cow, or
warthog hair; each ball is joined to the next, at an interval of
a few inches by a fibre string, the whole forming a completed

time I get them they are usually dead. Of the larger birds, Denham's
Bustard and the Black-bellied Bustard, are fairly common either singly
or in pairs. The latter does quite well in captivity. I have seen that
Nigerian rarity the Secretary Bird at fifteen yards range. The locals
have no name for it, but mistake it sometimes for a Crowned Crane
when at a distance. I was told by these locals both Cranes and other
long-legged birds were easy to snare ; my experience was the opposite
in India as unless tremendous care was taken a leg was almost
invariably dislocated or broken. The Four-banded Sandgrouse
apparently breeds here, as I have shot and caught young in January.
They are supposed to migrate north to the Sahara verges during the
rains. The double-spurred Senegal Francolin is very common, and
locally common the Nigerian White-throated Francolin, which lie
like stones at your approach, and burst away singly when you all
but tread on them. I have so far found no nests or eggs, though birds
paired about mid-June.
Two species of Plantain Eater are comparatively common ; the
Grey and the Violet, the latter only in and around " Kurmis ". It is
really an astonishingly lovely bird. Courtship appears to be rather
violent, as I have several times seen a cock chasing a hen until they
have had to settle or rather fall into the grass from exhaustion. Once
a pair fell within a few feet of me, and I could see them panting with
their beaks open, and the hen with her eyes closed. I have found no
nests. They eat quite well as the two I shot for skins made good
roasts, and were not too dry. Both species are very noisy, and
flock after flock takes up the initial cry. There are numerous species
of Nightjar, the most easily identified being the Standard-wing and
the Pennant-wing. About a month ago I caught a couple of young
Broadbill Rollers (Cinnamon Rollers would describe them better).
They are really lovely birds, with their pastel mauvy shades ; better
looking, though less showy than the Abyssinian Roller with its forked
tail and glaring blues. There are several species of Glossy Starlings ;
one called Lamprocolius splendidus splendidus is easily distinguishable by
its call ; then there is the Purple Glossy, the Short-tailed Glossy, and
Lesser Blue-eared, also a few Longtailed. The Amethyst has been
here in very small numbers, but after the start of the rains quite a few
can usually be seen at any time. The cock does not look Amethyst
in flight, but mauvy-red. Young cocks I do not think assume full
plumage till their second or third year, as some I mistook and shot for
hens had a few purple feathers on the rump. They were not birds of
the year.
Sunbirds are not here in great variety, but in great quantity. The
commonest being the Pigmy Long-tailed of whose nests I had no
fewer than four in my compound. They built their rather neat nests
about the size of a four ounce tobacco tin in four to six days, and in all

cases were rather fond of Guineafowl feathers, which they collected
off my ash heap. I have also seen the Hausa Violet-backed, the
Collared, the Olive-backed (rare), the Scarlet-breasted, Yellow-
bellied, the Splendid, and the Copper. All these I have shot with a
.22 rifle ; besides these there are several others which so far I have
been unable to identify, as I have missed them with the rifle.
Surprisingly enough, the .22 bullet, if slightly filed down at the
tip, hardly makes a mark on the bird. I find it hard to identify any
except the more obvious ones from the illustrations in the book of
Birds of Tropical West Africa. In the case of the Pigmy Long-tailed,
none of the birds in my area look like it either in colour or shape.
The Copper is a much darker bird than illustrated. The copper gloss
is deeper in tone, and it is very rarely that more than a small portion
holds and reflects the light. I have only seen two species of Parrot,
the Rose-ringed and Scarlet-bellied. The latter is really an astonish-
ing colour. Young birds have the scarlet orange band which extends
under the wings, but do not have the bright yellow marginal feathers
on the flanks, down the legs, and on the under tail-coverts. They
are exceedingly active, and I think could be taught to whistle. The
one I have could now almost be mistaken for an American soldier
attracting his girl friend's notice. The bird I have is very fond of
Pigeon carcases ; a thing I remembered from earlier days. I have
had the Bearded Barbet which has a really uncouth head and is rather
a clumsy bird altogether. However, being very greedy, it was easy
to keep until I had finished painting his portrait.
Easily identified Waxbills are the Red-cheeked, Cordon Bleu,
Black-rumped, Orange-cheeked; and several Fire Finches, which
I have not yet identified. The Senegambian Melba is difficult to see,
but there are quite a few about. The most conspicuous Whydah is
the Yellow-mantled. There are many species of Weavers which I have
not had time to place. Unlike Benin there are no Chestnut and Black
where they swarmed in flocks of three to five hundred.
About ten miles from my hut I always put up Quail Finches. They
really do give the impression of a miniature Quail in flight, and they
flop back into the grass exactly like their namesakes. The impression
is that they fall with their wings raised. There are scarcely any
Europeans I have met who take even a passing interest in birds,
and books of reference are few and far between. I can borrow a
volume of Bannerman now and again, but not long enough to be of
any practical use to me. Actually this is good for me, as I have to
keep independent notes and measurements, and make water-colour
sketches ; without this I think I would be in a padded cell.

BREEDING OF RED-HEADED PARROT FINCHES

I have been asked by the Secretary to give a brief account of breeding
Red-headed Parrot Finches (Erythrura psittacea) to the eighteenth
generation, and it gives me much pleasure to do so.
The habitat of this species is the island of New Caledonia. The
plumage of the male is forehead, throat, and cheeks, rump, and tail,
scarlet, and the rest of the body is green. The female is similar to the
male.
More years have passed than I care to recall since I set my heart
upon breeding this beautiful finch, and resolved that should the
opportunity ever present itself, I would try and establish an aviary-
bred strain. I must confess that at the time the possibility of procuring
such rare birds seemed remote. I knew that many difficulties would
be encountered, and furthermore much perseverance and patience
would be required. Upon reflection I remembered the many small
insectivorous birds I had hand-fed to maturity, and the innumerable
times I had, for almost two seasons, presented an artificial fly to a fine
specimen trout before it finally succumbed and was safely in the
landing net. This gave me hope that the necessary patience would
be mine.
With the advent of the 1932 breeding season it was possible to make
a start with two pairs from which young were reared. In the season
of 1933, young were also reared. The beginning of the 1934 breeding
season found me in possession of several more, wild imported birds,
from which young were successfully reared, thus forming the strong
nucleus of a strain bred in captivity.
In the space of a brief article it is not possible to record in detail
what happened up to the commencement of the war, but by this time
the birds were well established. With the advent of the war it seemed
as though I might have to sacrifice the Parrot Finches. After much
thought I decided to try and keep them going as long as possible,
and with this object in view a limited number were bred each season
during the war.
When the war had been in progress some time, the stock of seed
was speedily diminishing. Expecting the worst, I had tried all manner
of substitutes, but the Parrot Finches would not co-operate. I quickly
came to the conclusion that if they were to be preserved they must
have their staple diet of canary and millet seeds. I was grateful to
get the offer of five cwt. at a cost of #450, and even this had to be
supplemented by a further quantity at a similar rate. This brings to
my mind a lady aviculturist who was determined to rear two broods
of Shamas. A monetary reward was offered in the neighbourhood
for live insects. The Shamas were all successfully reared, but as she

remarked to me, " What those young Shamahs cost to rear I shall
never know." I can echo her sentiments with regard to the Parrot
Finches.
During the war we in this area had our share of air attack, and
during one particularly heavy raid one night in mid-winter, I feared
the Parrot Finches would be no more. At the time I had quite a
flock flying loose in a large shelter shed at the bottom of the garden.
The enemy dropped a land mine in the near vicinity, and at the sound
of shattering glass I felt that surely this was the end of the Parrot
Finches. When things had quietened down, and I had time, I went
down to the aviary in trepidation, to see how the Parrot Finches had
fared. With the aid of a torch I found a window had been blown
out, leaving a large gaping empty space. It was pitch dark, but I
managed to locate some ruberoid which was hastily fixed over the
aperture, but there was not much more that could be done until the
dawn broke. When it was light enough to do so, I investigated further,
and found the aviary floor covered with splinters of glass, and a wire
frame which had been fixed at the back of the window on the floor
also, but the Parrot Finches seemed as perky and cheerful as ever
and not one had been even injured. By the number of flight and tail
feathers about, and their general behaviour, I knew they had had
a scare. A check up on numbers revealed all present, and it was
remarkable that none had fluttered against the aperture and escaped.
However, they survived the war with no casualties from enemy action.
In the process of building up the strain, I experienced difficulty in
getting the birds to conform to our breeding season proper. In their
wild state their breeding season is, of course, directly opposite to ours,
so the cycle had to be completely reversed. This change was gradual,
but now the cycle is identical to our own native birds ; that is, a
complete moult takes place at the end of the breeding season. It is
interesting to note, however, that a colour change without a moult
takes place in the spring. At this period the plumage brightens up
considerably. I have also noted that whilst this colour change is
taking place, the birds are a little less active than usual, which seems
to suggest that the change is a physiological one.
When paired off for breeding, Parrot Finches never seem amiably
disposed towards each other until mating has taken place. This takes
place on the nest and is accompanied by a low purring noise. After
this the male will always be found to be in close attendance on the
female, following her about the aviary wherever she may go. The
male builds the nest and shares the duties of incubation during the
day, whilst the female herself incubates through the night. Often
when on the point of hatching both incubate together.
The incubation period is fourteen days, and both parents feed
the young, which leave the nest at twenty-one days. The sides of the

mouth of the young birds are ornamented with four luminous beads
which light up in the darkness of the nest and so enable the parents
to feed them. Upon leaving the nest the young are a drab green with
tail dull red. Some have a certain amount of red on the face, but this
varies in individual birds, even out of the same nest. The lower
mandible of the beak is bright yellow, which gradually changes to
black, as in the adult. Within a short period of leaving the nest, a
moult takes place, and the full adult colouration of red and green is
assumed. I have found that the change from immature to adult
plumage may be accelerated or retarded by weather conditions, but
on an average full colouration is acquired when approximately four
months old.
Aviary bred Parrot Finches in my experience are fairly hardy, but
it is a fact that they are very difficult when first taken out of their
native haunts and placed in captivity. I have noticed that upon
giving my birds an apple (of which they are exceedingly fond), cut
in two with the pips partially exposed, there is keen competition to
get at the pips first. A friend of mine who spent some time on the
Island in connection with the mining of a particular kind of ore,
told me that there were various fruits growing, so possibly the pulp and
seeds form at least part of their diet in the wild state. Many species
of birds with red in their plumage do not retain the red when kept
in captivity. Therefore, it is interesting to record that after such a
long period of breeding in captivity the brilliancy of the red in the
Parrot Finches is just as intense as it was in the parent stock. Further-
more, there has been no decline in stamina or fertility, and as for size
I would say that by and large they are superior to their progenitors.
Breeding has been strictly controlled, young ringed, and parentage
recorded, which is absolutely essential in generation breeding.
Now a word about keeping Parrot Finches healthy. The staple
diet should be canary and millet seed. By nature they are very active,
so at all times should be given as much flying space as possible. From
the beginning my practice has been to turn all young, after being taken
from their parents, into an open flight 15 feet long by 5 feet broad
by 5 feet high, with shelter shed attached. Only two natural branches
are put in the flight, one at each end, thus ensuring plenty of wing
exercise and conditions conducive to a healthy and quick maturity.
They are also very particular about their toilet and bathing facilities
must not be neglected.
Perhaps after my success in breeding this species to the eighteenth
generation, other aviculturists will be inspired to try and perpetuate
more species. I know it is a great achievement to win a coveted
medal for a first breeding, but the continuous successful breeding of a
species brings its own particular reward.

Curator of Birds, Chicago Zoological Park, Brookfield, Illinois
Probably the most interesting of the many duties we had during
the return trip from Australia in October 1949 was our care of the tiny
Fairy Penguins (Eudyptula minor novaehollandae). There really was
a feeling of exaltation because I knew that it would be the first landing
in America of these delightful little birds and best of all, they were all
willing to eat. From the time of their being put aboard the S.S. Sonoma ,
6th September, 1949, until date of writing (June, 1950) they have not
missed a meal.
There were, and are, eight of them and all travelled in a large crate
about 3 feet square and 3 feet high. With this we also had a galvanized
tank about the same size and 12 inches deep. We started out with
330 pounds of frozen fish, part of which was for Herons, Spoonbills,
and Ibises, and each morning we would take a large slab which
would be thawed out by feeding time. These fish were fine for filleting
and enough was cut up so that each bird would have from twelve to
fifteen finger-sized pieces. One of the first duties in the morning was
to hose out their crate and tank and they would march out down the
ramp into their pool. There would be much splashing and preening.
Three o'clock was feeding time, so they were put back in the crate
and one by one taken out, put in my lap, and offered their fish which
were eagerly gulped down until each had its full quota and put back
in the tank. The surplus fish were tossed to those who were still
unsatisfied. This procedure was followed faithfully for the thirty-four
days on the ship and the two days in the baggage car, which was
rather crowded with the eighty-four other crates containing from one
to thirty-six individuals according to what they might be. The two
crates with the highest number carried the pretty Australian Finches,
but the other crates contained Kangaroos, Wombats, native Gats,
Sugar-gliders, Possums (not opossums but phalangers), Tasmanian
Devils, Lizards, Black Swans, Cassowary, Crane, Heron, Kagus,
Spoonbills, Ibises, Ducks, Geese, Frogmouths, and a host of smaller
birds, enough to make a quota of over three hundred specimens.
There were twenty-two species alone of Parrot-like birds, comprising
seventy individuals.

In spite of the inconveniences and crowded condition of the baggage
car the little Penguins were not disturbed. They got their food and
baths which were enjoyed to the fullest extent.
At the zoo a beautiful all-glass wall-cage had been made ready.
This cage is very attractive with its rock work and pool and measures
15 feet across by 10 feet deep and 12 feet high. Since our return we
have changed the diet so now they get from twelve to fifteen small
smelts apiece. Each bird gets a fish which has had a capsule of cod-liver
oil inserted in the body and a drop of potassium iodide solution in the
fish-head. This approximates their natural sea food and apparently
keeps them in good condition.
Coming from the mild climate (for Penguins) of Australia we do not
fear the dread disease aspergillosis--a mycotic infection of throat and
lungs. They seem to be immune from the spore-filled atmosphere of
our climate and which is negligible in the air where those species of
Penguins live down near the Antarctic. For those species, the large
magnificent King Penguins and the smaller Humboldt's Penguins,
we keep in a very large air-conditioned cage which also has germicidal
lamps so the air they breathe is free from infectious bacilli which is
the deadly hazard for these southern forms.
Many people do not know that the family of Penguins (about twenty
species) is confined to the regions south of the equator. In the
Galapagos, cooled by the Humboldt current, we find the small
Galapagos species which has been shown here in the past. The
Humboldt's Penguin ranges from the southern extremity of South
America up the west coast to within 6 degrees of the equator and the
very similar Magellan Penguin ranges up to Chile on the west coast
and southern Brazil on the eastern side of South America. The Black-
footed Penguin is found on the coasts of South Africa. These four
species all belong to the same genus, Sphenkcus , and have a superficial
resemblance. All of the remaining species have natural habitats south
of these latitudes ; the largest of all, the Emperor Penguin, and the
Adelie Penguin, have the southernmost range, Antarctica.
The smallest species is the Fairy Penguin, also called the Little and
the Blue Penguin. It inhabits the seas of the south-eastern coasts of
Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand which is the home of a similar
species (.Eudyptula albosignata ). It is seldom that one can see the metallic
sheen of blue reminiscent of the blue on a live mackerel, which prevails
on the back. It was noticed particularly under the tropic sun when
the birds were in the water. These little fellows are about a foot in
height--bluish-slate above and silky white below. The flippers are
margined with white on one edge but in the very similar New Zealand
form the white edge extends all around the flipper.
Hoping to induce housekeeping ideas in our flock we placed twigs
and leaves on the pebble-covered floor of their enclosure, but none

seemed interested. Finally, in February of this year we noticed
mating, so we made a cave of rocks also placing a supply of twigs and
leaves. About three weeks later a pair appropriated the " cave 55 and
one of them, presumably the male, carried the leaves one at a time to
the opening and the bird inside took them and arranged them until
finally they had a leafy mattress. On 7th April, 1950, the first egg
was laid and a week later the second. They were dull white and
about the size of an ordinary hen's egg. The sexes appear to be quite
indistinguishable but we managed to band one so could see that they
alternated in incubating, morning and afternoon. A month later one
of the eggs disappeared and as there were strict orders not to disturb
the nest we did not find out until later what had become of it. The
birds fed eagerly as before but whichever one was on the nest would
come to the opening at feeding time and eat a lesser number of fish.
None of the other birds was permitted near the cave opening.
All during this time we had been trying to find the incubation
period for this species. No records seemed to be available excepting
for certain other species whose periods ranged from twenty-eight days
to ninety days in the great Emperor Penguin. Finally, frustration !
For on the forty-second day we found the egg rolled out and quite
cold. Saddest of all was to find that it contained a chick almost
ready to hatch, and dead, of course. Why this had to happen we do
not know. The egg was sent to the Chicago Natural History Museum.
It was opened so skilfully that the chick was removed intact to be
preserved and the egg saved as a specimen. On cleaning out the
nesting place we found a few pieces of egg shell indicating the fate of
the missing egg.
Now we wait for renewed ambition on the part of the Penguins
and better luck.
Since the above was written, word has come from Mr. R. W.
McKecknie of Plympton, South Australia and also from the
Australian Museum in Sydney that the period of incubation is 38-39
days. We appreciate this information.

last, and I certainly think least, an excessively wild and entirely mud-
coloured bird called, for some extraordinary reason, a Crimson-
breasted Thrush !
What memories these names bring back, and what a galaxy this
list must seem to the younger generation of austerity-ridden present-
day aviculturists, and how I wish I could think those pleasant times
might one day return.
As we had only one really roomy planted aviary, my policy was to
change the population of the aviary almost entirely every year or so
and thus have as much variety as possible, and also gain all the
experience one could in the keeping of the various species.
On one occasion I devoted the aviary mainly to Waxbills, Cuban
Finches, etc., and both Fire Finches and Cuban Finches successfully
reared young.
Cordon Bleus are usually considered delicate, so it was interesting
to see how hardy they become when kept under almost natural condi-
tions where they have the chance to build up their stamina during the
summer months in order to withstand the winter. Mine seldom
entered the shelter, preferring to roost, even on the bitterest nights, in
the evergreen bushes in the aviary. Although I felt sure the morning
would come when I should find one of them with a chill, I never did,
and they remained extremely lively and in the most perfect health
and condition throughout the entire winter.
Occasionally, as in the case of the Niltavas and White-capped
Redstarts, I found that when the time came I was quite unable to
bring myself to part with them, so they remained as permanent
residents among the changing population.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996998866666667" page_id="56288040"  page_num="256" year="" vol="">
Many of the birds I have mentioned presented no difficulty as to
maintenance, and they, or their near relatives had been widely kept
for years, so I will try and single out a few that were less well known
and not too easy to keep in perfect condition.
Of these I think first must come the Short-billed Minivets which are
quite as beautiful as the rather better-known Scarlet Minivet, which
I have never kept. They are purely arboreal, with the tiny feet of
a Swallow, and in a wild state are said to spend most of their time
flying about the tops of the tallest trees. They are most gorgeously
coloured, the males in both the Short-billed and Scarlet Minivet
being glossy blue-black and brilliant scarlet, while the females'
plumage is a pleasing combination of grey, whitish and creamy
yellow. Unfortunately, like so many insectivorous birds with large
areas of red in their plumage, this colour fades, after a moult in
confinement, to a sort of washed-out salmon pink.
In a large aviary they are both tame and charming, but I doubt
if they would prove easy to keep alive for any great length of time.
Like so many of the more difficult softbills they have such a passion
for mealworms that, with the exception of other live insects, they are
inclined to refuse all other food, even the finest quality insectivorous
mixture.
The pair I had spent a summer in the planted aviary and were
a wonderful sight, as they arrived in excellent feather and the cock
was still in his brilliant importation plumage. In the end I had to
give in to them and let them live almost entirely on mealworms and
such insects as they caught for themselves. They died in a curious and
unexpected way. The grass in the aviary was rather long, and at the
end of August there was a terrific thunderstorm, followed by torrential
rain. When I went to the aviary some time later, all seemed well,
most of the birds having doubtless taken shelter during the downpour.
But I missed the Minivets and after a prolonged search they were
eventually both found dead and drenched to the skin in the long
grass.
I found the Spreos very easy to keep in perfect health, but the Royal
Starlings, though they presented no difficulties in the feeding line,
proved terribly prone to " gapes ", such as often afflicts young
pheasants. They were however incredibly beautiful, particularly with
the sun glinting on the wonderful metallic blues and purples of the
upper parts of the plumage which are such a striking contrast to the
orange-yellow of the breast. Their only rival I can think of in metallic
brilliance is a cock Monaul Pheasant.
The White-capped Redstarts flourished exceedingly and proved
extremely hardy and long-lived. They are rather sombrely clad in
deep chestnut and black, but this only makes the contrast with their
dazzling white caps all the more striking.

All the Buntings were beautiful, but I particularly admired the
mysterious smoky-blues and purplish-mauves of the Versicolor.
Of the Grosbeaks I think my favourites were the Rose-breasted,
which twice bred successfully in the aviary, the young in each case
rather disconcertingly leaving the nest long before they were fully-
feathered. The hen is brown with rather thrush-like breast markings,
while the cock during the breeding season has much the same simple
but effective colour scheme as a Red Admiral butterfly, except that the
latter's pillar-box red is replaced in the bird by rosy carmine. The
Rose-breasted Grosbeak, among his other attractions, is a really fine
songster with many of the powerful liquid notes of an English Black-
bird, and the cock I had for so many years not only sang a great deal
during the day but also had the curious habit of suddenly bursting
into song at night, particularly if there was a moon. Blue Grosbeaks
were beautiful, but as far as I can remember, very bad-tempered in
an aviary.
The single male specimen of the Yellow Grosbeak which I had for
many years was--for a Grosbeak--an enormous bird with a terrific
pewter-coloured beak with which when handled he could give you a
very nasty bite. His tail and wings were a mixture of black and white
and different shades of brown, most of the rest of his plumage being
bright canary yellow. In spite of the strength of his beak he was the
most peaceful of aviary birds, and for some reason always irresistibly
reminded me of a large brightly-painted carved wooden toy !
The Verditer Flycatchers fully lived up to their name, and were
fascinating to watch as they hawked for insects of a summer evening.
They were attractive little things, being coloured that curious shade
of bluish sea-green which is rather seldom met with in birds.
A Common or Bengal Pitta also inhabited the aviary in summer,
and used to spend the winter in a heated birdroom in a large cage
with peatmoss as the floor covering, and furnished with decaying moss-
covered logs and branches for the bird to perch on, the whole being
regularly sprayed to keep it moist. Extremely beautiful as most of
them are, I think Pittas are of all birds the least to be recommended as
aviary inhabitants. I used to be able to admire my Pitta's beauty
during the winter while it was caged, but from the moment it was put
back into the planted aviary for the summer one scarcely saw it again
until the following autumn. Very occasionally one would catch a
momentary glimpse of a fleeting shadow hurrying away into the
undergrowth, but that was all.
Doubtless the best of all ways to keep Pittas is in the moisture-laden
atmosphere of a heated greenhouse or conservatory, as Monsieur
Delacour did so successfully, but failing this I think the method I have
outlined is the next best thing as my bird (seldom as I saw it!) was always
in perfect condition when I did catch a rare glimpse of it. If kept in

even the largest cage with the ordinary dry sanded floor, their feet
invariably go wrong. They must have moist conditions.
The Golden-fronted Fruitsuckers were pretty enough, but proved
extremely cantankerous in a mixed collection and soon had to be
removed, as they had the maddening habit of standing guard over the
food containers and keeping all other birds away from them, although
not wanting to feed themselves.
It may be of interest to mention here two experiments I carried
out with the breeding of birds at " controlled liberty ", the two species
being Shamas and Dhyal Birds.
Shamas were tried first and the following year Dhyal Birds. In
both cases the same procedure was followed, the pair being put in
spring into an aviary with the back and one-third of the top and sides
boarded over, the remaining two-thirds being wire netting, and the
nest box hung under the covered part.
So many tales had I heard of the dangerous ferocity of male Shamas
when first introduced to their prospective wives, that I took what
seemed afterwards rather ludicrous precautions to prevent her being
murdered. The cock was first put in the aviary, and the hen gingerly
introduced (in a cage hung under the sheltered part) several days
later. After about 48 hours, greatly daring, I let her out of the cage
into the aviary, and the cock was so delighted to be with her that
I am quite sure all the caging business was utterly unnecessary.
Possibly, though, it may all depend upon the temperament of your
particular cock Shama.
They very soon went to nest in a half open-fronted box, and as
soon as the young ones hatched the parents were given full liberty
through a small square hole cut in the wire of the front of the aviary
with a wooden alighting platform inside and out, upon which meal-
worms were placed to enable them to locate the hole. The hen soon
vanished and returned with a beakful of caterpillars from the garden,
and when she went straight in and fed her brood I knew there was no
more fear of their straying. The hen continued to work like a trojan,
while the cock, a charming but idle bird, contented himself with
remaining on guard close to the aviary, and filling in his time by lying
on his side on a grassy bank with feathers well puffed out and one
wing extended, having a sun-bath. Both birds were extremely tame,
the cock particularly--since he led such a life of leisure--always
coming to sit on the rungs of our deck chairs as we had tea on the lawn
beside a lily pool, while sometimes his wife came to have a hurried
bath in the shallow water among the irises that bordered the pool.
It was all very idyllic while it lasted, but it ended in a most distressing
tragedy. The hen was always pestering me for mealworms if she saw
me with the livefood tin, and one morning as I was walking along the
concrete path by their aviary, one must have dropped just beneath my

foot and the hen swooped after it with such lightning speed that I had
hardly time to realise what had happened until I saw her lying crushed
and dead on the path. It was one of the most horrible moments of my
life, but, as I realised when I could think of it calmly, quite unprevent-
able.
If there is a drawback to these very tame insectivorous birds at
liberty, it is that such is their passion for mealworms that they are
inclined to pester one perpetually for them, even to the extent of
alighting on one's back as one bends to open an aviary door, and
flying up into the aviary much to the consternation of its rightful
inhabitants.
Although the nestling Shamas were so very young, I hoped that
the cock might bestir himself and rear them single-handed but in this
I was disappointed, for though he continued to visit the aviary and
perhaps occasionally to feed his brood they soon died of neglect.
Although he had seemed quite attached to his wife during her
lifetime he showed not the slightest sign of sorrow at her death, and
when shortly afterwards, to his manifest delight, another hen Shama
was obtained, he quickly paired up with her and they went to nest
at once. On this occasion the hen was not nearly so tame, and all
went well until the four young Shamas were on the point of fledging,
and as I normally saw very little of the hen in any case, my first inti-
mation that anything was wrong was that awful charnel smell coming
from the aviary.
What had happened really was very tragic. All four young Shamas
were dead in the nest, and after a prolonged search, their mother,
together with a very small mouse, was discovered drowned in a sunk
water tank in the greenhouse, having, no loubt, lost her life in pursuit
of the mouse. It was doubly disappointing because if only one could
have been aware that the hen had met with a fatal accident soon after
it happened, it would have been such a simple matter to finish off by
hand the rearing of the almost fledged young Shamas.
The following year a liberty experiment with a pair of Dhyal Birds
followed almost exactly the same course as that with the Shamas,
and once again the hen must have come to grief, this time about
a week before the young ones were due to leave the nest. As to what
actually happened to her I have no idea as her body was never found.
Interesting as all three experiences were, they were also terribly
disheartening particularly as, anyway in two cases, complete success
had been so very nearly achieved. However, I suppose it is true that
the more obstacles that are put in the way, the more one is spurred on
to overcome them, and I know I would dearly love to try some more
controlled-liberty breeding experiments with these two as well as
with other foreign insectivorous species.

outbreak of war, we imported and sold many thousands of Waxbills,
Weavers, and Whydahs, etc., as well as hundreds of imported Goul-
dians and other Australian Finches, in addition to those bred at the
farm. Writing this sentence has recalled very vividly to me a particular
occasion when we had a consignment of several hundred Gouldians.
The acclimatizing aviaries were furnished with natural twiggy branches
nailed to the back, and these, covered with hundreds of Gouldians
sitting in the sun, looked as though the leafless branches suddenly had
burst into fabulous bloom, and made a quite unforgettable picture.
It soon dawned on people that it was a better policy to pay more for
acclimatized birds that had already spent weeks in out-door aviaries,
rather than throw away a smaller sum on ones that had all too often
been bundled straight into travelling boxes without being given any
chance to rest and recuperate after their already long and tiring journey
to this country.
I first started keeping foreign birds about 1909, when I was seven
years old and was permitted to have what was then known as a
" Crystal Palace Aviary " of Waxbills in my nursery, so I have had
forty years' experience of bird keeping, and though one is inclined
to talk glibly of the good old days, I think in some respects they were
very bad old days indeed. Therefore, even if we had achieved nothing
else--such as the breeding of aviary-bred stocks of the rarer Australian
Parrakeets and Finches--I should still be proud to think that we were
the first commercial firm to import, on a really large scale , such cheap
and common little birds as Waxbills and save them a great deal of
unnecessary suffering, and their purchasers much unnecessary dis-
appointment, by resting and acclimatizing them before they were sold.
On reading through the previous instalments of the History of our
farm, I find I have unaccountably failed to mention a first breeding
for which we were awarded the Avicultural Society's medal in 1936---
namely that of the charming little Varied Lorikeet (Psitteuteles versi-
color) with its green plumage streaked with mauve and gold, the whole
being set off by a brilliant scarlet cap.
One young one was reared which proved to be a cock. The usual
description of immature specimens as merely " differing from their
parents in having a duller colouration generally " is incorrect, as our
young male left the nest with an extensive patch of orange-yellow on
the back of the neck which gave it a quite brilliant appearance, though
the patch subsequently disappeared when the bird reached maturity.
Varied Lorikeets inhabit Tropical Northern Australia where they
are sometimes seen in vast flocks feeding on the nectar of the blossoms
of their favourite trees, and it is easy to imagine how vividly their red
caps show up, and what a lovely sight they must make when a large
flock are seen feeding together on a single tree.
They are sociable and would appear to have a considerable sense of

loyalty to any member of their society which comes to grief, and it is
recorded that a man who picked up a wounded specimen was instantly
settled upon by a swarm of sympathetic members of the flock to which
it belonged.
The alleged delicacy of Varied Lorikeets in confinement is entirely
fictitious, for they are quite as hardy as Swainsons--provided, of
course, that they have always a nest box to roost in at night, which is
absolutely essential for all lorikeets when kept all the year round in
outdoor aviaries in this country.
Ours at Keston were housed in open aviaries, the back and half the
top and sides of which were boarded to afford protection from wind
and rain, and were provided with a fairly deep hung-up nest box with
a filling of peatmoss and decayed wood.
They always roosted in the box and a young one was heard being
fed in December, but as the sound subsequently ceased, it presumably
died at an early stage. In March, however, there was again the sound
of a young one being fed, and it was this bird---a very fine young
cock--which finally left the nest about the middle of May, and was
the first young Varied Lorikeet in the world ever to be bred in
confinement.
It seems strange that this should be the case, as it is not infrequently
kept in aviaries in its native Australia, though it was always one of
the rarer lorikeets in confinement in this country. It has now,
however, been successfully bred in an Australian aviary, the event
taking place in 1949, as has been recently recorded by the eminent
Australian aviculturist Dr. Lendon.
Our youngster was reared on the ordinary lorikeet nectar and
sweetened stewed apple, of which latter the parents were very fond.
No account of the history of our farm would be complete without
our putting on record our great appreciation of the services of Mr.
R. W. Cason, who, in his capacity of Foreman-carpenter, has been
with us almost ever since my partner and I started our venture in 1927.
Not only were practically all the, by now, very large number of
aviaries which constitute the farm made by him, but he personally
looks after our stock of rare parrakeets when we are away and he has,
in addition, a very retentive memory which has, on more than one
occasion, during the writing of this article, been of considerable help
to me.
Finally, as this account of nearly 22 years of bird-farming draws
to a close, inevitably one comes at last to that dreadful day in Sep-
tember, 1939, when war was declared.
It all seems to me now--as it must to most other aviculturists,
particularly those who lived on the outskirts of London or other large
cities--as a sort of confused nightmare from which one obscurely felt
that one was bound to wake up sooner or later.

I remember our car being twice loaded with travelling cages con-
taining most of our hurriedly caught up and rarest Parrakeets, of
which, among many others, I recall most clearly the pairs of Splendid
Grass Parrakeets and Princess of Wales', the former's wonderful
sapphire masks and crimson chests still aglow in the depths of even
the dingiest travelling cage, and the Princess of Wales', a bit brainless
for all their beauty, chortling away quite happily unaware that a
world had just come to an end.
Loaded with this precious cargo our car made its long journeys into
the West Country to deliver them to a friend who offered to house
and feed them in a very much safer area than ours was likely to be.
Although during the war years the farm was almost entirely given
over to ducks and chickens for egg production, we did manage to
retain a nucleus of our breeding stock of parrakeets.
Naturally, during the war, there were no breeding results of par-
ticular interest, but in 1945, the year the war ended, there was one
breeding result at Keston of very great interest as a pair of African
Grey Parrots successfully reared a young one for which event we
were awarded the Avicultural Society's medal, as it was the first
young African Grey ever to be bred in confinement in this country, or,
I believe, in Europe.
As soon as the youngster was fledged the parents went to nest
again and hatched another young one, but unfortunately too late in
the year for it to be reared, and it died in the nest in November when
quite big and starting to feather.
The African Grey is so famous as the most brilliantly gifted of all
" talking " birds, and indeed so well known generally, that no descrip-
tion of it is necessary.
It was probably about the first foreign bird ever to be imported into
this country and there is, I believe, an authentic record of a pet bird
of this species which belonged to King Henry VIII about four hundred
years ago, and it is, therefore, doubly satisfactory to have been the
first to breed a bird which has been well known in confinement for so
long--a far greater thrill, I always think, than to breed for the first
time some extreme rarity which probably few other aviculturists have
ever had the chance to possess.
The writing of this history of our farm has taken me a considerable
time to complete, and was done as opportunity allowed--chiefly
during the winter evenings.
It was--as my readers will have gathered from the title--started
last year, and now, as I come to the end of my task, it is pleasant to
record how much conditions for the aviculturist have improved : food
is easier and the importation of foreign birds is again permitted without
a licence, except for psittacine species.
It is nice to have most of the Waxbills, Whydahs, Weavers, and

Diamond Doves, etc., again, and though our varied pre-war breeding
stock of Australian Finches is still reduced to pairs of Zebra Finches
and Long-tailed Grassfinches, we hope to get some of the raref ones
shortly and, for my part, how glad I shall be to possess and--I hope--
breed Gouldians again !
We have a hen of the very rare Orange-bellied Grass Parrakeet
whose mate--an over-fat and obviously ancient specimen with an
overgrown upper mandible--died from a fit, and an even rarer and
most enchanting little Double-eyed Dwarf Parrot of the genus Cyclop -
sittacus, from New Guinea, almost certainly the first of his kind to be
imported into Europe. We also have a pair of the rare Australian
Pileated or Red-capped Parrakeets which reared a fine brood of six
young ones here at Keston this (1950) season--the first time they have
been bred in England for forty years.
And finally, Turquoisines and Splendid Grass Parrakeets : The
hen Splendid proved a hopeless mother letting all her newly-hatched
young ones die at once, yet, even so, three fine young Splendids were
reared by foster-parenting under Bourkes.
Two pairs of Turquoisines on the other hand, one of the hens of
which was reared here last year, have done wonders, hatching, between
them, 21 young ones and fully rearing 17 of them, thereby proving
that the prolificacy of Turquoisines of which one reads in books
written about the end of the last century, really was fact--and not
merely wishful thinking.
We are gradually getting our blitzed terrace aviaries back into
commission again, and as these have lain for eleven long years beneath
a tangled growth of wild clematis or " old man's beard "---which,
in our chalk-laden soil, smothers everything almost as quickly as the
jungle does--they perhaps provide as fitting a symbol as any, of the
gradual reclaiming of lost ground, and of the continued vitality of
our farm.

It is over a year now since you so kindly allowed me to write about
an orphan Missel Thrush that we all became very fond of. " He "
was a hen, and she became very restless and unfriendly in the latter
part of August, and so we gave her her liberty, and after a somewhat
prolonged leave taking she left our district, I think in company with
the two wild pairs that had been raising families in the garden and
churchyard. This year we reared another young Missel Thrush
who thrived and grew, and became wonderfully tame. This was a
cock, and he sang to us in July, but in August the same spirit of
wanderlust seized him, and he also became wild and restless, so he
departed with local friends. It seems that Missel Thrushes leave their
breeding quarters at the end of the summer and move with their
families to other feeding grounds, perhaps they take the children to the
seaside ; but no more young Missel Thrushes for us.
This April our Siamese cat disgraced herself by bringing into the
house an infant Blackbird ; this was rescued, undamaged, and too
young to be hopelessly shocked. He joined the young Missel Thrush,
and the consumption of brown meal in milk, and worms, was tre-
mendous. They both spent quite a lot of time on the back seat of the
car, and went to two Point-to-Points and a tea party, as they had
their meals pretty frequently, they had to come, and it mattered little
to them if they received a worm in a car or in the kitchen.
In early May the Blackbird went back to school with my small
son. He had an excellent summer term, and spent a lot of time
flying round the classroom and tasting the ink in every inkwell.
The school authorities seem to have been very patient, and the
Blackbird arrived back for the summer holidays, a little thin, but
very tame and cheerful, and an almost complete diet of live insects
and fruit has resulted in a perfect moult, and we are looking forward
to the time when his beak clears completely, yellow goes so well with
black velvet ; he treats us to a little sub-song every day now. He
comes out of his cage and sits on the back of my chair and drops his
wings and cocks his tail over his back, and " clinks " if he is not offered
something to eat at meal times.
He enjoys fighting a finger, and regards the Siamese cat with
contempt, and she takes no notice of him at all, but they are never
left alone together.
The most interesting accomplishment that the Blackbird treats us
to is " Anting ". It began when he was half-way through his moult,
when he was offered a pot of fresh ant cocoons and some live ants.
He immediately seized an ant, compressed all his feathers till he
looked half his size, sat back on his tail, and opened both wings, and

tucked an ant under each wing in turn at great speed ; all this was
done within six inches of my face. I understand that the formic acid
in the ant acts as a stimulant on the skin, which is enjoyed by the bird,
like a bath. I have seen Starlings do this frequently, but not the
Thrush family before. How did my Blackbird, who had never seen
an ant before, know how to deal with it ?
How valuable are elderberries ; the Blackbird eats quantities, and
a White throat that I have lately acquired eats them just as freely.
This sprite sits on my hand and takes a mealworm from my lips !
Catering for these small warblers in the winter is anxious work, and
my friends and parishioners look concerned and worried at my
constant desire for spiders and earwigs, until the mystery is explained.
Oh ! where this autumn are those fat-bodied spiders with a cross
on their backs that sit gloating in huge cartwheel webs in every bush ?

REVIEW
BRITISH WADERS AND THEIR HAUNTS. By S. Bayliss Smith,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978125583333333" page_id="56288051"  page_num="267" year="" vol="">
G. Bell and Sons, London. Price 21s. net.
Anyone interested in this fascinating group of birds will wish to
possess British Waders and Their Haunts. Not only is the book most
interesting and informative, but the author writes so vividly that he
transports the reader, in spirit if not in body, to the mud flats and
saltings so that you can almost feel the whip of the cold wind, smell the
tang of the sea, and hear those haunting calls so full of music, the
beauty of which to some ears far excels that of the song of the
Nightingale.
Mr. Bayliss Smith has watched, studied, and photographed the
waders at all seasons of the year, and at all hours of the day and night
and secured a wealth of information concerning their intimate lives.
He explains the technique of wader photography, the mastery of which
he has undoubtedly achieved as is evidenced by the many beautiful
photographs which illustrate the book, and he is well supported by other
photographers. Twenty chapters are devoted to individual species
and groups of species, with careful notes as to how they can most
easily be differentiated, and at the end of the book there are detailed
descriptions of thirty-six species. The distribution maps of waders
nesting regularly in the British Isles, based on those already published
by W. B. Alexander and James Fisher, and the map showing the places
where rare waders have bred in the present century are excellent.
There are some very good plates of waders in flight by Basil Laker.

NOTES FROM THE LONDON ZOO
By G. S. Webb
Of the few recent arrivals the most notable are two species of
Aracaris--the Chestnut-eared ( Pteroglossus castanotis) and the Yellow-
billed (P. JIavirostris) --from Ecuador. They were collected by Mr. G.
Gordier on his recent expedition and were sent in exchange from the
Bronx Park Zoo, New York. Both species are new to our collection

and make welcome additions as we rarely get anything from the
Andean zone, which is so rich in bird life. They are most attractive,
the former having a gaily patterned beak which is a distinguishing
feature of most of the members of the genus.
Even more striking is the bill of the Lettered Aracari (P. inscriptus),
a pair of which we are expecting shortly. This will bring our species of
the Toucan family up to nine.

G. S. WEBB-NOTES FROM THE LONDON ZOO
Other recent arrivals are one Indian Hornbill (Anthracoceros mala -
baricus ), five Greater Flamingoes (Phosnicopterus antiquorum ), two
Sarus Cranes (Grus antigone ), and one Quail Finch (Ortygospiza
atricollis ). It is many years since we have had the latter. They are
attractive little creatures if given a chance but more often than not
they are shipped in small boxes with hundreds of Waxbills and being
non-perching birds they become badly fouled by the others.
An interesting collection of waders was received in exchange from
Mr. Reventlow, of the Copenhagen Zoo:--i Wood Sandpiper
{Tringa glareola), i Green Sandpiper ( Tringa ocrophus), i Temminck's
Stint ( Calidris temmmckii), 6 Dunlins ( Calidris alpina ), 2 Greenshanks
( Tringa nebularia), 1 Redshank ( Tringa totanus ), 1 Spotted Redshank
(Tringa erythropus) and 8 Ruffs and Reeves ( Philomachus pugnax) . The
Temminck's Stint is new to our collection. From the same source we
received a fine immature male Naked-throated Bell-bird ( Casmarhinchos
nudicollis ), a few White-bellied Emerald Humming-birds ( Amazilia
leucogaster) , and Swallow-tailed Humming-birds ( Eupetomena macroura).
A fine Venezuelan, or Phoenix Cardinal (Cardinalis phceniceus )
was presented by a seaman just returned from Trinidad. This is a
very distinctive species that we have not had since 1917. From the
same source we received a Thick-billed Finch (Oryzoborus crassirostris)
and a Little Saffron Finch (Sicalis minor).
A Grayson's Dove (#enaidura graysoni ), which hails from Sorocco
Island, West Mexico, was received in exchange from Mr. Decoux,
of France. It is new to our collection.
Most of our Whydahs and Bishops have still (19th October) their
summer plumage. An exception is the South African Giant Whydah
(D.p. progne) which is now very " sparrowy " though the Delamere's
Giant Whydahs {D.p. delamerei) from the Kenya Highlands still
have their long flowing tail feathers.
As a contrast to this group which will soon all be in their dull winter
plumage our northern Water-fowl are now at their best, having changed
from the eclipse plumage of the summer months.
The death of old age of our only Trumpeter Hornbill (Bycanistes
bucinator ), takes me back to the time of its capture, twenty-one years
ago, in Portuguese East Africa. On this collecting trip I noticed that
Trumpeter Hornbills came to a certain ficus tree to feed. Some
strenuous climbing enabled me to reach the upper branches where
I arranged a platform of limed twigs close to a particularly tempting
bunch of fruits. Such strong birds would never stick to a fixed object,
so the technique was to have limed thin twigs--one or more of which
would stick to the bird and thus sufficiently unbalance it when attempt-
ing to fly. This rendered capture quite easy. Hornbills have such
ridiculously short legs that they have little chance of keeping their
wings clear of such a trap. On this occasion a short wait was all that

was necessary for the capture of a true pair--both having descended
to earth with a wobbly flight. They came to the Zoo and nested
several times in a box provided for the purpose. The female was
self-imprisoned in this box while she underwent her moult, the entrance
hole being plastered until only a narrow slit was left. Young were
never hatched though once she was observed to remain in the nest
for ninety-two days without coming out. She was, of course, fed during
this period by the male through the narrow entrance slit. When the
plaster was finally broken the nest was found to contain many feathers
but was beautifully clean, the excrement having been ejected daily
by the sitting bird. It is strange that the female Hornbill moults
rapidly when nesting but does so imperceptibly in captivity when
unable to nest.
Both birds were adult when captured and were of unknown age.
The female died during the war and her mate as stated above.
Our Great Indian Hornbill is still going strong after twenty-seven
years in captivity.

PURPLE-RUMPED SUNBIRDS.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.989571571428571" page_id="56288053"  page_num="269" year="" vol="">
About four months ago I obtained a pair of Purple-rumped Sunbirds ( Cinnyris
zeylonica). The species is new to me, for only as a museum skin had I seen the bird.
While making my visit to the Calcutta bird bazaar the little fellows attracted my
attention. The sun was on them, and I could not leave them, with the result that
I now have them in a cage in my flat. The feeding habits of the Nectariniidae are
unique in that they feed upon the nectar of flowers, fruits, and minute insects.
The problem of keeping them alive and happy presented itself, and I fed them
sliced oranges smeared with marmalade (orange), a bit of banana, and a phial of
concentrated orange syrup, known as " orange squash With their thin down-
curved beak they probe into the orange and obtain its juice.
Their transportation by air could be successfully carried out by supplying them
with oranges and marmalade, and of course drinking water.
I may add that the numerous fruit flies that hover around the fruit in their cage
are relished by the pair of birds.

AVICULTURE IN DENMARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967037641025641" page_id="56288054"  page_num="270" year="" vol="">
Referring to Mr. C. af Enehjelm's account of " Aviculture in Denmark " in the
March-April number of the Avicultural Magazine, I should like to correct an
error in the article.
Mr. Enehjelm writes " There is one important society in Copenhagen " and
then proceeds to mention the number of members, etc. I suppose this is due to
a lapse of memory, as Mr. Enehjelm is himself an old member of " Selskabet for
Stuekultur ", a society which brings together people with the following hobbies :--
Aviculture, Aquarism, Terrariums, and indoor gardening.
This society was founded on the 29th October, 1903, and for more than 25 years
Her Majesty Queen Alexandrine has done the society the honour of being patroness.
In 24 cities outside Copenhagen, local societies have been founded, and at a rough
estimate the number of members is around 3,500, and of those at least 2,500 are
aviculturists.
Furthermore I should like to point out that in 1949 the society in Copenhagen
arranged two shows, and ten of the affiliated societies outside Copenhagen also
arranged shows. For 1950 the number of shows, as far as I at present can estimate,
will be bigger than in 1949.
All other details of Mr. Enehjelm's article are correct in every detail, and I can
only compliment him being able to write so very accurately, as he has not been
a resident in this country since 1939, after that only visiting Denmark on too rare
occasions.
Aviculture in Denmark lost one of its most clever and ardent supporters when
Mr. Enehjelm, as an officer of the Finnish army, had to leave Denmark to fight for
Suomi, owing to the outbreak of war between Finland and Russia.
Paul Hansen.
Gormsgade 3,
Odense,
Denmark.
With reference to Mr. Paul Hansen's above remarks on my article on " Aviculture
in Denmark ", I beg to state that I very much regret my lapse of memory in not
mentioning " Selskabet for Stuekultur " in my article, the more so as the local
society of Odense, where Mr. Hansen is a resident, is one of the most active in foreign
bird-breeding in Denmark, some of the members being among the most able fanciers
in the country. I have been a judge at their shows on many occasions, and the show
in Odense, 1939, was the last one I judged for very many years, and that in 1949
the first at which I judged Foreign birds after the war. As Mr. Hansen quite correctly
supposes, it is a lapse of memory on my side, for which I hope the members of Selskabet
for Stuekultur will forgive me.
G. af Enehjelm.

THE STANLEY PARRAKEET
(.Platycercus icterotis )
By Edward Boosey (Keston, England)

<bodyText confidence="0.996760724137931" page_id="56288077"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
This charming little Parrakeet has everything to recommend it
as an aviary bird, and is much the smallest of the Broadtails, being
not so very much larger than a Redrump.
As this article is accompanied by a coloured plate, a detailed
description is unnecessary, and I will merely say that the male has
the upper parts mainly green, with the feathers of the back and
mantle almost black, some being bordered with red, but the majority
with green. There is much rich dark blue in the wings, and the
cheek patches are yellow and the whole of the breast bright red.
The female has the breast brick-red and the cheek patches dull
yellow and not so clearly defined as those of the male ; in fact in
some hens the cheek patches are practically non-existent, being merely
indicated by a few scattered yellow feathers. Young birds are not
always easy to sex, and vary considerably, but most young cocks show
slightly brighter red on the crown.
Despite the hen's duller colouring she is an attractive little bird
and makes a pretty contrast with the cock, and I always think that
fully to appreciate Stanleys a pair should be seen sitting side by
side.
This marked difference in the colouring of the male and female
makes adults easy to sex at a glance, is a great advantage from
the aviculturist's point of view, and one not shared by most of
the Broadtails, which can often only be sexed by the squarer head
of the cock when compared with that of the hen, which is usually
rounder and more feminine-looking.
There seem to me to be two fairly distinct races of the Stanley,
both of which I have kept and bred. In the one the green areas are
grass-green and the red ones vermilion ; and in the other the green
areas are a rather dark oily green, and the red ones a rich scarlet.

own country as the Western Rosella. They are said to be fearless and
partial to cultivated land and the vicinity of farmsteads, where they are
much disliked owing to their habit of raiding orchards and garden
crops.
Stanleys were among my first loves in the Parrakeet line, and for
the last thirty years I have seldom been without at least one pair,
except during the five years I lived and worked in London, and at
present we have several breeding pairs at Keston.
Never so easy to obtain as the Common Rosella, they became
extremely scarce after the Parrot ban came into force, as hardly any
aviculturists seemed to have breeding pairs of them, and the few odd
ones occasionally offered for sale were usually miserably small,
degenerate specimens which were not worth buying.
Having always been particularly fond of Stanleys, I decided to
try and see if we could not remedy this sad state of affairs, and once
more bring them back into circulation as aviary birds. Luckily,
with the aid of our special import licence, we were able to obtain from
Australia several very fine and reputedly wild-caught pairs of Stanleys
with which to found our breeding stock at Keston. These proved
excellent breeders and very prolific, and in addition to gradually
increasing the number of our stock pairs, we annually marketed their
young ones in ever-increasing numbers until the war broke out.
At first the results seemed disappointing as one only occasionally
saw Stanleys advertised, but the numbers have steadily increased
until nowadays there are few Parrakeet breeders who do not have
Stanleys for sale.
They make excellent aviary birds, and if shut into their aviary
shelter each night during the winter, are perfectly hardy and need no
artificial heat.
They are the best and most reliable breeders of all the Broadtail
family, and are often, though not always, double-brooded. I should
think it might even be possible to breed them in a really large flight
cage, but an outdoor aviary is much better, and one about 7 feet
high by 5 feet wide with an overall length of 15 feet, suits them
admirably.
Their nest-box, which should be about 10 inches square by 18 inches
deep, should be hung up in the flight under overhead cover, and failing
a half coco-nut husk fixed in the bottom--which is the ideal receptacle
for the eggs--the box should have a 6-inch filling of decayed wood.
Personally, I do not recommend peatmoss as I have found that the eggs
tend to get buried in it.
Stanleys should be fed on canary, shelled monkey nuts, sunflower,
and a little hemp, the latter being considerably increased when they
have young in the nest. They should be given the usual greenfoods
and are very fond of spinach beet, of which they will consume a

surprising amount when breeding. As long as they have plenty of the
latter, perfectly good young ones can be reared without fruit. On the
other hand they are very fond of apples, but, if these are given--
particularly when the birds have young in the nest--they must be really
ripe and sweet or they may well do more harm thkn good.
Stanleys have been crossed with other Parrakeets, and I myself
have bred hybrid Stanley X Mealy Rosellas and a Stanley X Red-
rump. As far as I can remember the former were rather attractive
but in the case of the latter only one very uninteresting-looking
young one was reared and died before moulting into adult plumage.

During the year 1950 we tried to bring renewed activity to the
Avicultural Society of America. It was not, however, without a
struggle ! Because of various formalities we started late. But we
were full of pride and hope when No. 1-2 of Aviculture came out.
At last, we were organized and had made a start. I left for Europe
early in May, thinking that all was well in hand and smooth sailing.
What an illusion ! When I was across the Atlantic, deep in other, if
more or less similar problems, I was surprised to find that no new
number of Aviculture was appearing ; there was a complete blank
of news for a long time. I first put it down to postal delays ; then
I began to worry. It was only late in the summer that a torrent of
unwelcome news arrived ; our Editor had had to cease work owing to
poor health ; then two issues were lost between San Diego and New
York ; finally our young and active Assistant Secretary, David
West, was drafted ! We could hardly have had worse luck, and it
sounded almost incredible. I got busy writing, trying to have things
settled till I could return and discuss the situation with our officers
and directors. One bright point, however, was that Mrs. Nancy Bode,
of the San Diego Zoological Society, who had been helping Mr. Ken
Stott edit the magazine, was willing to carry on for the time being,
by the kind permission of my old friend Mrs. Belle Benchley. We owe
them our deepest gratitude.
Back in New York, my spirits sank very low, and I was almost
ready to give up. But I am not inclined to give up anything until
the last chance has vanished. Mr. Crandall and Mrs. Erlanger were
also ready to carry on. Soon the prospects began to look a little
more promising ; the lost issues had been insured and reimbursed,
and they were being printed again. Steps were taken to make certain
their safe distribution ; we caught up with time, and all the 950 issues
reached our readers.

At the beginning of 1951, our position is still difficult. We have
no funds, and our income is insufficient as the number of our members
is far too low, considering the possibilities of a half continent. We
have no Editor, and we are always terribly short of copy, and we have
no paid publicity to help towards expenses. During the past year,
we have been able to carry on, thanks to the generosity of our
Secretary-Treasurer, Mrs. M. Erlanger, and of the Zoological Society
of San Diego. Now the cost of publication is greatly increasing in
America, and we therefore have to face an entirely different situation.
Your officers and directors have therefore decided on a new policy.
We have been most fortunate in reaching an agreement with the
Avicultural Society, so that their periodical, the old and famous
Avicultural Magazine, will also serve as the journal of the Avicultural
Society of America and be distributed to the members of our Society.
All American contributions and articles will be welcome, and several
pages in each number will be reserved for American Avicultural news
and notes. Our New York office will centralize the various papers,
advertisements, and all other matter for publication, and forward
them to the Editor in London. In addition, we will be in a position
to publish a special yearbook for the members of the Avicultural
Society of America. This arrangement, we feel, will give the best
possible satisfaction to our members in the present circumstances.
The Avicultural Magazine has long been an international journal,
and it has a tendency to become more so as time goes on. The present
step establishes it as the world wide avicultural publication. It seems
that, in the present difficult times, it is a better policy for all aviculturists
to join in one joint effort. The amalgamation of Aviculture with the
Avicultural Magazine is ensuring the prosperity of a united journal
in English for the study of bird life and comportment in captivity.
Jean Delacour,
President , Avicultural Society of America.
The present number commences a new era for the Avicultural
Magazine, for from now on it will serve as the journal of both the
Avicultural Society and the Avicultural Society of America. When
the Council of the Avicultural Society received this proposal from
the Avicultural Society of America, through its President, Monsieur
Jean Delacour, all members were unanimous that the proposals be
accepted.
We do not forget that it was mainly due to the unceasing help of
Jean Delacour and other colleagues in the U.S.A. that the Avi-
cultural Magazine was able to be kept going during those dark
days of war, when the Editor was never quite sure whether she would
be able to produce the next number or not. The close association

which Jean Delacour has always had with the Avicultural Society
makes the present agreement an even more happy one, and it will
undoubtedly make even closer the friendly relations between British
and American aviculturists.
While maintaining complete independence the Avicultural Society
of America in uniting with her older sister in Great Britain, will help
to produce a magazine which will hold premier place of its kind in the
world, for by this action our magazine becomes a truly international one.
On behalf of all members of the Avicultural Society I express a
warm welcome to the participation of our American friends.

The summer of 1950 has been much less dry in Western Europe
than that of 1949, with both good and bad effects. I could only visit
some collections in England and in France during the last season, but
no doubt good results have been also obtained in other countries ;
I hear, for instance, that Professor Ghigi has reared many rare
Pheasants in Italy, while Mme. Malisoux, in Belgium, was again very
successful with Tragopans, Gray Peacock-Pheasants, and other
unusual species. She has also acquired several Palawan Peacock-
Pheasants and Indian Koklass during the year. Waterfowl were not
very successful at Woburn Abbey, where the Duke of Bedford hatched
70 Red-breasted goslings, but reared only 14, many having contracted
a disease when half grown. His very choice collection of Parrots and
Parrakeets has now been established in new movable aviaries at
Woburn, and some have successfully bred. A magnificent pair of Gang-
gang Cockatoos have reared an equally magnificent young pair, and
there were a number of young Rock-Peplers, Barraband's, Barnard's
and Pileated Parrakeets. Budgerigars of all colours flew over that part
of the garden, beautifully trained to go in and out of their flight,
a lovely sight. The Duke of Bedford has long been a great master at
training birds to stay at liberty. Budgerigars, being migratory, must
be caught in the early autumn and kept in till the following spring.
There were also few young waterfowl at Whipsnade ; but I saw
there a fine young Manchurian Crane ; several Whooper Swans ;
a few Brush Turkeys ; 7 Crested Guineafowl; 3 Monals ; 1 Satyr and

and lots of commoner chicks. At the London Zoo a number of Hors-
fields Kalijs were raised from an imported pair ; also 3 Sonnerat's
Junglefowl and several other game birds.

Mr. A. Ezra had a young White-necked Crane, a number of
Mandarin Ducks, 5 Ashy-headed Geese, 2 Leadbeater's Cockatoos,
but only a very few Yellow Ringneck and Queen Alexandra's Parra-
keets.
In Gloucestershire, Peter Scott's waterfowl collection has been
greatly increased. The grounds have become very attractive, with
a lot of well-kept grass, growing trees, and bushes. The series of Swans,
Geese, and Ducks are really outstanding, to-day the most complete in
the world. Valuable recent additions are a pair of Nenes and a pair
of Hawaiian Mallards, both nearly extinct species. Others are 5 pairs
of Maned Geese, Chestnut-breasted Teal, and Gray Teal imported
from Australia, a pair of South American Comb Ducks : imported
Blue-winged Geese, Spur-winged Geese (both forms), Red-billed
Pintails, and Cape Teal from Africa. Nearly 300 goslings and ducklings
have been reared, including Ross, Lesser White-fronted, Chinese,
Emperor, Lesser Canada, Cereopsis Geese ; European and New
Zealand Sheld-Ducks ; Ruddy Ducks, and ten Gray-breasted Red-billed
Whistling Ducks (.Dendrocygna autumnalis discolor ), a bird which has
seldom bred in captivity, while its northern close relative, the Black-
bellied, nests freely.
Leckford is always a wonderful sight in the summer, with its hordes
of young waterfowl and game birds. During my several visits there,
I saw Black and Black-necked cygnets ; 20 Ashy-headed, 1 Ruddy-
headed, 7 Magellan, 8 Emperor, 2 Ross, 10 Blue-winged, and other
common goslings ; 10 or 12 young each South African and Ruddy
Sheld-Ducks, and Andean Crested Ducks. There were hundreds of
ducklings, among them 10 Chestnut-breasted and 6 Falcated Teal,
two species nearly extinct to-day in captivity which had hardly been
bred since the war ; 2 Radjah Sheld-Ducks ; 8 Marbled Teal, seldom
if ever raised before. Unfortunately, an epidemic of crop worms later
on caused the death of 4 Emperor, 1 Ross, and 1 Red-breasted goslings,
the latter the only one hatched this year. Among the Pheasants,

Edwards, Swinhoes, Impeyan Monals were raised. There were also
5 Stanley's and 7 Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets. To finish with
England, my friend Captain S. Stokes reared 5 Red-breasted Geese
after many years of failure with these birds.
Early in August I spent several days at Gery, near Limoges, central
France, with my old friend, Mr. A. Decoux. His large collection of
Parrakeets, Doves, and small birds still is one of the finest in existence,
and he had a number of young birds of many species, particularly of
Australian Parrakeets, Finches, and Doves. We motored north
a hundred miles one day to Scorbe-Clairvaux, a village in the Poitou,
long famous in avicultural circles. For many years the local vicar, the

late Abbe Leray, was an outstanding breeder of Parrakeets and
Pheasants and met with very considerable success. His nephew, now
very old, still keeps and raises birds, mostly Zebra Finches, Diamond
Doves, Budgerigars, Lovebirds, and Swainson's Lorikeets. But
Mr. and Mrs. Bertin, now in their seventies, who were also the Abbe
Leray's pupils, still breed innumerable birds, and continue making
a fair living out of them. Their old stone house is adjoined by a
walled-in yard and garden. Flights are built all around, with very
large shelters, mostly open in front, right along the walls. They are
very practical, very cosy, and evidently most suitable. About 30 in
number, rather shallow but fairly wide, they contain Lovebirds and
Budgerigars of all colours, including the most recent mutations ;
Gockatiels ; various Zebra and Society Finches ; Diamond, Peaceful,
Bleeding-heart, Bronze-winged, and Brush Bronze-winged Doves.
The bulk of the breeding, which brings in money, consists of the
Budgerigars, Zebra and Society Finches, and Diamond Doves, which
are raised and sold annually by the hundreds and possibly the thousands
to bird dealers in and outside France. The demand always exceeds
the supply. Mr. and Mrs. Bertin love their birds and are devoted to
them. They feed them on a great deal of sprouting wheat and oats,
and they believe that a good part of their success is due to such a
practice.
There are many other similar bird breeding establishments in
central France, as well as amateurs' collections, which I hope to visit
next year.
I will end with a few words about Cleres. Thanks to Mr. F. Fooks'
incredible energy and ingenuity, it has regained almost completely its
pre-war standard. Despite the disturbance caused by thousands upon
thousands of visitors, who are necessary due to the very heavy cost of
upkeep of the grounds, a number of young birds were reared last sum-
mer, mostly waterfowl, game birds, pigeons, and parrakeets. Among
the more interesting species, I should like to mention 5 Red-breasted
and 4 Greenland White-fronted Geese, the latter for the first time in
captivity. A number of ducks were allowed to raise their broods on the
lake. It simplifies matters a great deal, and remarkably few are killed by
rats, Crows, and Magpies. The only drawback is to have to catch the
ducklings and pinion them before they can fly. A Red-crested Pochard
hatched and raised 9 , and a Chilean Teal 5 ducklings. The last few
years the lake has been partly overgrown with a submerged weed that
we never had before (Potamogeton trichoides ). It is tiresome as it
looked a bit messy, but it provided wonderful feed to the birds, not
only the leaves and shoots that they eat eagerly, but also the shrimps,
daphnies, and insects which swarm among them. We also reared
Temminck's Tragopans, Mikado, and Edwards' Pheasants, Green
Peafowl, and other commoner species ; many Doves, one pair of

Bronze-wings having produced 8 young in less than six months.
A pair of Bleeding-hearts raised two without any live insects, entirely
on softbill mixture and egg food. Budgerigars of many new colours,
and various Lovebirds were also reared.
During the past year, a large number of new birds were acquired
in America, in England, in France, and elsewhere, and the collection
has been greatly improved. It has become much easier to acquire
birds in Europe during the past year. Permits for imports have been
more liberal in France and in England. Indian, African, and Mexican
consignments have arrived in both countries on a large scale, as well
as some birds from China, South America, and Australia, while
Belgian and Dutch dealers continue to offer large assortments from
many parts of the world. In number and varieties of the birds, the
European markets are fairly similar to the American, and prices are
pretty much the same everywhere.

By A. Tadeson (Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada)
Having to work with a bird fancier may at times be a headache to
more than one worker who had the pleasure or displeasure in listening
to his many ravings about the bird he had just bought, raised, sold,
or might have seen somewhere ; but to me it was the birth of a wonder-
ful hobby. I spent my boyhood days on a farm, but most of my bird
fancying had been done only from the side lines, just observing them
when the occasion arose. However, listening to the many experiences
my friend had had, and the unbounding pleasure he used to get when
he raised a good bird, be it domesticated or a wild one, seemed to spark
a desire in me to raise them, to be closer to them, and to study them
more.
My younger days on the farm had instilled in me a great admiration
for the graceful and beautiful Pheasant and when my thoughts turned
to raising birds, my first love was the Pheasant ; later came other
birds.
The problem of building suitable pens and aviaries confronted me
first. Being on a small city lot worried me at first, but my friend
insisted I would have enough room to raise a goodly number of birds.
I knew I wouldn't be satisfied with keeping just one or two species,
so I had to keep the size of the pens down, and yet each one big
enough to hold several birds if need be. I started with pens approxi-
mately 5 feet wide, 17 feet deep, by 6 feet high. I built the framework
with 2 by 4, and 2 by 2, and used 1 inch mesh chicken wire to cover it.
At the back end of each pen I built a shelter right on the pens, covering
three sides, and a roof. I boarded up the front end of the shelter just
part way up from the ground, and from the roof down. Under the

roof I placed the roosts. This gives the Pheasants shelter from rain,
sleet, and wind. I took precautions against rodents getting in by
burying sheet metal down one foot all around the pens. I also placed
a board or two all around the bottom of each pen to protect their tails
from wear and tear of rubbing against the wire. I put lake sand in the
pens. This certainly keeps the birds cleaner, besides giving them plenty
of dusting material. Fruit trees growing around the pens supply most
of the shade for the birds ; I planted additional small trees in the pens
to give more shade and to improve the general appearance of the pens.
All the older Pheasants spent the year round in these pens and don't
seem to mind our climate here. Late hatched birds sometimes have
to be put inside when wet and cold weather sets in.
The first pair of Pheasants I decided to get were Lady Amherst's.
I thought they were the most beautiful I had ever seen, and to-day
I still think that. Next came the Goldens and then the Reeves and the
Silvers. The past year or so I introduced different species of Doves
into the Pheasant pens, and they seem to get along very well together.
They have their own little coops to get into if they so desire, or can
roost on the limbs of the small trees growing in the pens. When cold
weather comes they are put inside.
I try to keep my pens as clean as possible. I like to feed the birds
a good variety of grain and seeds. Occasionally I give them additional
treats such as apples, grapes, and raisins. I always make sure that they
get enough fresh water and greens such as lettuce, dandelions, or
grasses that may be available, each and every day. I think this is very
important to their health and well-being. The Doves are given extra
seeds and treats they like.
Every spring, when the egg laying season rolls around, I am filled
with new interest and excitement. I wonder how the hatch will turn
out and how many birds I will raise. I wonder how my new ideas will
work out, if I will raise any young from that new pair that I bought.
I have raised Pheasants in home-made brooders and with broody
hens. I think that I have had best results with bantam hens. I have
small coops made that have a wire run attached to them and can be
moved to fresh ground.
The few short years that I have raised birds has given me a tremen-
dous amount of pleasure and relaxation from daily routine of work.
Many interesting experiences keep the interest up in this great
hobby. For any disappointments that may come, there is also the good
luck that follows. I think the greatest thrill that I have received from
my hobby yet was when I set my first clutch of Pheasant eggs and got
a perfect hatch. My worst disappointment was seeing these fifteen
beautiful chicks die one by one within forty-eight hours. I had made
the mistake of using the largest Rhode Island Red hen, I think, in
Welland County.

I plan to build up my hobby to a point where I will be able to keep
at least one pair of the rarer species of birds. I think the need is great
for fanciers to breed and study the rarer birds. With civilization cutting
more and more inroads into the habitats of the birds, many species
are surely becoming scarce and are fast nearing extinction. Too much
cannot be said for the value of propogation of these birds.
Bird raising is one of the most interesting and worth-while hobbies
any man or woman could find to-day.

With mixed feelings I comply with our fair Editor's request to
" write something about your Magpies ". With pleasure because to
write about this unique and beautiful member of the corvine tribe
cannot but conjure up happy memories, but with misgivings when
I realize how skin-deep is my knowledge of the bird.
When writing previously about Jays I said that they are seldom
aggressive with other birds that share their quarters. The same
cannot be said for the Magpie. I have read of tame Magpies that
lived peaceably with other birds, even in one case with Waxbills, but
of such a bird one may say as Cicero said of a good government, that
it ' 4 is something to be hoped for rather than a possibility ". In a wild
state the Magpie is rarely a killer of adult birds, probably never unless
they are badly injured, but then he has plenty of other things to
occupy his mind and energies. In a tame or captive state it is usually
a case of " how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds makes ill deeds
done Generally, Magpies are safe enough with such birds as
Golden Pheasants, but even then one must watch out for the first
sign of aggression. It is usually correct, and certainly wisest, to
assume that if a Magpie playfully plucks a tail feather from one of
his aviary companions he will kill it, or attempt to kill it, sooner or
later if they are left together. Lest some anti-corvid crank should
suggest that this proves that wild Magpies take a great toll of bird-life
I would add that except in so far as its smaller size limits its sphere
of activities the Great Tit when in captivity is a far more bold and
persistent bird-killer.
My first Magpie was taken more years ago than I like to remember ;
she was hand-reared in an outhouse much frequented by domestic
Pigeons and apparently became " imprinted " on them. When she
could fly she lost much of her early tameness and consorted with the
Pigeons, roosting in the loft with them whenever permitted to do so.
When they took their circling flights around the house she flew with

them, her short wings beating frenziedly in her efforts to keep up,
and usually getting thrown out of the flock at every turn. Strong
winds caused her much trouble, and one day when a fair gale was
blowing she was whirled right away and vanished from sight, still
heading for home and chattering wildly in alarm. I was in a state
of mental agony and fearing the worst, but fortunately the wind
slackened a little and after some minutes there appeared in the distant
sky " first a speck and then a Magpie " (with apologies to Longfellow)
who gradually battled her way nearer and nearer and at last, to the
joy of her young owner, dropped safely on the roof among the Pigeons.
I forget when or how she first started to rob the Pigeons' nests of
their eggs and young, but certainly before she was a year old the habit
was firmly established. True, the depredations of a single Magpie
could not prevent the successful breeding of all of some twenty pairs
of Pigeons, but she took a heavy toll and usually managed to get hold
of any young ones that I particularly wished to keep. To keep her
out of the Pigeon loft was no easy matter for she not only learnt to
go in through the bolting wires but also how to lift them up with her
head and get out of them again. At various times she was kept in
" preventitive detention " but she was as quick to see and take a
chance of escaping as any Borstal inmate and she took her confinement
so hardly that I seldom had the heart to keep her imprisoned for long.
On one of these occasions she achieved a signal albeit unwitting
revenge by contriving in my absence to seize and pull through the
\ in. wire mesh every one of a brood of four young canaries that had
just left their nest in an adjoining aviary. The killing and eating of
young birds belonging to her owner did not by any means complete
the list of her annoying ways. Like many other bipeds, she believed
in fighting for her rights and resisting aggression. Like some modern
statesmen, she considered any defence of self or property on the part
of her victims as aggression that must be punished, although in her
favour it must be said that she took some risk and trouble to punish
it in person. One of the many disadvantages of being born a " sub-
human " creature is that one can never hope to attain a position of
domination over ones fellows without need of courage, or to fight ones
battles by proxy without personal risk. Still, all right-minded people
will at once agree that such delights should be--as they are--reserved
for those who have been made in God's own image.
To return to the Magpie. Her bitterest feud, and one that lasted
some months, was with a Bantam hen. Exactly how it started I do
not know, but I can guess who started it. The Bantam had been
sitting on seven eggs in an old open rabbit hutch. I first realized all
was not well when I observed her engaged in furious battle with the
Magpie on the ground and getting the worst of the engagement.
I rescued the Bantam, whose comb had been torn half off, and carried

her indoors to dress her wounds. There was a broken egg on the
ground and three still left intact in the nest, which latter--I having
foolishly left the hutch open--the Magpie removed and hid whilst
I was attending to the Bantam.
Having come off best did not in any way mitigate the Magpie's
resentment at the Bantam's resistance, and for several weeks after she
attacked the unfortunate bird, and harried her till she took cover
every time she noticed her. The Bantam was one of seven sisters, all
Partridge-coloured and much alike, but the Magpie never made a
mistake and attacked the wrong one.
She showed no interest in wild Magpies which sometimes visited
the garden but appeared to respond socially only to the Pigeons.
In her third year she built a nest on top of some boxes in the Pigeon
loft and laid six eggs. The nest was typical in every respect except
that the dome of interlaced sticks overhead was absent, as it may also
be in wild Magpies' nests if they are built in positions unfavourable
to its construction. As her eggs were, of course, infertile and I could
get no Magpies' eggs for her I substituted three Jays' eggs. These she
hatched, but apparently made no attempt to feed them and they all
died of starvation, their plight being discovered too late to attempt to
save them. Possibly, as is the case with the Rook, the male Magpie
alone feeds the young in the early stages. In any case, in all corvine
birds--so far as is known--the cock supplies the food at first, and
possibly in the absence of a mate the hen would feel no impulse to
collect food for newly-hatched young.
The nesting was her grand finale, for shortly afterwards she vanished,
probably killed by some human predator. No Magpie I have possessed
since has been quite such a forceful character, but equally none has
been half so destructive. The spring after her death I again succumbed
to temptation and this time procured two young Magpies. They were
at first delightfully tame, and when I called them to feed would come
flying in from the wood behind the garden, swoop down and alight
on my head and arms in the most spectacular and delightful manner.
But alas, they soon became wilder and would not approach nearer
than a few yards. They still, however, made the garden their head-
quarters and roosted in a shed at night, so that they were under
control and at the same time a most interesting and ornamental
couple. So far as I can remember they did no appreciable damage to
my other birds ; they were certainly in no sense the scourge that
their predecessor had been. One never looked really fit in spite of
good food and constant liberty, and when about eighteen months old
it died.
The survivor, a cock, then began to associate with a wild hen
Magpie and to roost, presumably with her, out in the woods. She
came regularly with him to the garden for food, always perching on

the trees and never on the roof as her mate commonly did. Soon
there was nothing to choose between them for wildness and neither
would come to the garden whilst anyone was in sight. This was about
1938, and their visits, accompanied in summer by grown up young,
continued until 1940. Thereafter, my absence from home caused me
to lose track of them. When I returned in 1945, Magpies were no
longer visiting the garden and, indeed, had decreased markedly in
the immediate neighbourhood.
I had intended to concentrate on Jays and keep no Magpies, but
fate decreed otherwise. " Grip 55 was found sitting disconsolately on
the ground outside a thicket in which was a Magpie's nest. Since
she was not more than two weeks old it was obvious that she must
have been taken from the nest and marooned by some callous person.
Her rescuer was unable to get to the nest to return her, or at least
so he said and probably thought, but since someone had quite clearly
taken her out I have no doubt that he could have put her back had
he really wanted to do so. Anyhow, he made a good job of hand
rearing her and she grew up a most delightfully tame and fearless bird.
Owing to various circumstances, which I will not bother to go into
here, she was, however, offered to me when a few months old, and
need I say what my answer was ?
That was in July, 1949, and since then she has been with me and
quite captured my affections and, even more, those of my friends,
most of whom I feel sure find the Magpie far more entertaining
company than her owner ! Human beings she shows great interest in
and affection for, hopping up to them with her white parts fluffed out
and tail switching sideways, usually finishing by edging up to their
faces, uttering soft conciliatory notes, drooping her head, and flicking
the white nictitating membrane sufficiently slowly across her eyes to
reveal for a moment the brilliant orange of its upper part. Unfortun-
ately, this fixation on human beings inevitably means that when
allowed her liberty she enters other people's houses and makes a
general nuisance of herself, so I am reluctantly obliged to keep her
more or less permanently confined. She is liable to panic at odd
things, as when for three weeks she hid in one corner of the aviary
terrified at some wooden poles that were being used for the construction
of a new aviary. As soon as the wire netting was put round the poles
the Magpie lost all fear of them and behaved normally once again.
In general, however, she is little afraid of inanimate objects and when
one is cleaning out the aviary she comes and hops on to broom and
wheelbarrow with a lively and quite unapprehensive curiosity.
In February of 1940 she began to build, and from then until she
commenced to moult in mid-May she spent much time carrying sticks
and fussing about her nest, although the latter never got further than
a rough pile of sticks. This may have been due to immaturity, but

I fear a more likely reason is that she regarded me as her mate, and
I was a very inadequate substitute for some devoted cock Magpie.
A third possibility is that Grip may be a cock " herself" for, although
I do not think this is the case, I have a well-founded mistrust of my
" intuitive " sexing of corvids. As soon as she noticed me engaged
elsewhere in the garden she would fly to her nest-site and utter the
long-drawn loud throaty nesting call as if to try to call my attention
to my duties. When I went up to the nest she would go into ecstasies
of affectionate excitement, fidgetting with sticks, uttering soft tender
notes, and flicking her nictitating membranes like windscreen-wipers.
In July, 1950, I was given a cock (?) Magpie, a big Crow-like brute
with a very large bill. He had been hand-reared along with two Jays
and when I had seen him some months before had appeared to be
reacting socially both to his owners and the Jays. Since I have had
him, however, he has shown no social behaviour towards humans,
and although tame enough to feed from the hand, is inclined to
panic at the sight of anything strange.
The newcomer soon made himself master of the aviary. Grip fears
him a little and dislikes him more, but for the most part they ignore
one another. Since September she has resumed nest-calling and
fiddling about with sticks on her nest-site in a rather half-hearted way
but the male bird shows no interest in these proceedings.
Since the beginning of last month a most pleasant development has
taken place (date of writing this, 10th December, 1950). I mentioned
the post-war decrease of Magpies in my immediate neighbourhood.
There has, however, for two or three years been a single pair in the
vicinity and early last month they discovered the aviary with the
tame birds. They showed at first great excitement and for several
days spent much of their time desperately trying to get into the aviary.
Their motives seemed chiefly aggressive. This may, however, have
been because Grip usually got panicky and flew wildly to and fro,
when one--usually the presumed female--of the wild pair dashed
after her above the wire. The captive cock (?) bird was bolder and
often tried to fight through the wire, but at first he also seemed rather
intimidated than otherwise. I think this was possibly because the
attackers were always above him. Within a week or two the hostility
of the wild birds largely decreased and the captives lost their fear of
them. Their visits now seemed social rather than aggressive, with of
course, the added incentive of the tit-bits that I took care to put out
for them. The difficulty of distinguishing the two wild birds one from
another tempted me to catch and ring them, but I resisted temptation
since I was afraid the fright entailed might make them keep away for
good. All birds are terribly frightened at being handled for ringing
and although most species soon get over their fear and are too stupid
to be able to recall the actions leading up to their unpleasant experience

sufficiently coherently to avoid visiting the same place again it is very
different with the more intelligent types. At least in the case of the
Jackdaw one usually finds a complete desertion for at least three or
four months of any garden in which it has been caught and ringed,
with the exception of young Jackdaws, which, if still being fed by
their parents, will follow them again into an area in which they have
been caught and ringed only a day before. The Jay, who is not the
equal of his relatives in brain-power, although even more charming
as an aviary bird, will, on the other hand, freely come again to the
trapping-area and even enter the same trap.
I was uncertain in which way Magpies would behave and decided
not to risk scaring my beautiful and welcome guests. Fate, however,
decided otherwise, since on going to the aviary this morning I found
that one of the wild Magpies--I think the hen--had found a broken
wire and got inside. I had no option but to catch her, an unpleasant
process for all concerned since my tame male bird imagined I was
trying to catch him and panicked as well, to a lesser extent. Only
Grip was completely indifferent, flying up and clinging to my shoulder
as I dodged about the aviary, and when I was ringing the wild bird
utterly ignoring it as she hopped about my arms " talking " affection-
ately to me.
On being released the wild bird did not stop flying till she was in the
wood. Later I saw her and her mate in some trees near the garden,
but whether they will again regularly visit a place where one of them
has suffered so much fear remains to be seen. A still more burning
question is whether my two birds will prove a pair and if so whether
they will finally accept each other as a mate and attempt to breed.
If they do I must admit I shall be rather surprised--and greatly
delighted.
PS. Since writing the above (date now 15/1/51) my cock Magpie
escaped in a panic whilst some workmen were messing about with
ladders in the garden and has not been seen since.
The two wild birds still visit the garden but show less interest in
the aviary and are both extremely wary and timid, far more so than
they were before they were caught and ringed.

By Dr. W. E. Hurlburt (Vineland, Ontario, Canada)
About fifteen miles from Toronto, near the village of Erindale, there
is a most unusual collection of birds, owned by a remarkable man. It
consists mostly of native birds, which can only be kept by government
permit, but it differs from the ordinary aviary in the great confidence
which the birds display toward their keeper. It is true that a certain
proportion are hand-reared, about half of the ninety-two birds that
were there when these notes were made, and also about a dozen more
had been bred in confinement. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that
Mr. Ivor has a way with them, as I have seen wild Chickadees and
Nuthatches follow him from his home to the entrance of the property,
about a quarter of a mile, and fly to his hand for peanuts as we
walked along.
A short account of Mr. Ivor's avicultural career may be of interest.
He was born in the Old Ontario village of Strathroy ; he moved to
the Western prairie province of Saskatchewan, and lived there for
sixteen years. Always interested in birds, he and his brother were
first to find the nest and eggs of Richardson's Merlin (.Falco columbarius
richardsoni ), a bird of the plains. This is mentioned in Macoun's
Catalogue of Canadian Birds. About twenty-five years ago Mr. Ivor
returned to Ontario and bought his present place, which is ideal for
his purposes. The house is a small shingle-covered cottage, situated
in a clearing of about 4 acres, and surrounded on two sides by the
mixed coniferous and deciduous woods of Southern Ontario. It is
approached by a winding path leading through a wooded valley and
is quite secluded. It was here that he began keeping birds through
obtaining two tame Crows, and from that start the hobby gradually
developed to its present proportion.
The following is a probably incomplete list of the native species
kept. The nomenclature followed is that used in P. A. Taverner's
Birds of Canada , 1934.

The birds are kept in two aviaries. The older, or winter avairy, is
attached to the eastern portion of the dwelling-house and faces south.
It is 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet high, and is now provided
with an outdoor flight. Inside, along the northern wall, are a number
of roomy cages for the isolation of individual birds, especially
combative males, in the spring. This aviary is heated with an oil
stove and is used to house the collection from October to May.
About 30 feet south-east of the house is another aviary used for
summer quarters and particularly for breeding pairs. This is a circular
dome-roofed structure, about 20 feet in diameter, consisting of a large

central portion, and a number of smaller compartments for individual
pairs around the periphery. Each of these compartments has an
ingenious door which allows a pair to go out and re-enter, when the
owner so decides. They can thus range freely about the garden, fields,
and woods and capture much of the live food which is essential when
rearing young. There are losses, of course, due to the capture of
released birds by Hawks and Owls, and sometimes by fighting, from
a tenant entering a neighbour's compartment. The birds almost never
desert their young and fly away, the only instance that I heard of
occurred with a pair of Redpolls. There is no doubt that some of the
success attained in breeding is due to this free flight of the parents.
The staple food used for both seed and insect eaters is a powdery
mixture of about eighteen ingredients which is based on a formula
given by Dr. Robert B. Boucher, of Pennsylvania State College. This
has been modified somewhat by Mr. Ivor. In addition to this food,
considerable amounts of screenings from a local milling company,
home-grown millet, and dried wild fruits are supplied. The birds
appear in excellent condition.
Study of the habits and behaviour of his birds provide the chief
interest for Mr. Ivor. He feels that they display much the same
characteristics as man and the other higher animals, only differing
from these in degree, and that they are not mere automatons and
slaves of instinct, as is claimed by some authorities. Quite a difference
has been noticed among various species, in general adaptability and
the ability to solve problems. The Crow and Blue Jay are rated as
most intelligent, followed by the Rose-breasted Grosbeak and the
Catbird. The European Blackbird is put at the head of the Thrush
family, then the Bluebird and the Wood Thrush, the American Robin
bringing up the rear. The brain of the Cardinal is not highly rated.
The peculiar action known as " anting ", in which a bird holds an
ant in its beak and rubs it over its feathers, has been studied by Mr. Ivor
and his observations published in The Auk , July, 1941, and January,
1943. Motion pictures have been taken of the birds while performing.
In the experiments sixty-three birds of thirty-one species were observed.
The majority were American, but a few European and Asiatic species
were used.
The following twenty species anted : Blue Jay, Catbird, American

was seen to ant while at liberty, but only in the aviary, a shovelful of
earth containing ants being put inside. The ants were rubbed on the
ventral surface of the primaries, but not on the legs. They were not
rubbed on places where parasites were most likely to occur, such as
under the wings, on the rump, or near the vent. Comical contortions
took place while doing this, the birds often tumbling over backward.
The birds apparently often ate the ants after rubbing them over their
feathers.
Although breeding birds has not been a primary object to this
aviarist, considerable success has been attained ; moreover, a number
of species have been bred for more than one generation, which shows
skilful management. The following are some of the successes :--
American Magpie. --A species not native to this part of North America
nested in a tree by the house. The eggs were destroyed by Crows,
then the Magpies left and reared a brood about twenty miles away,
in complete independence.
Blue Jay. --io to 12 young reared--two generations bred.
Catbird. --5 reared--one generation.
Wood Thrush. --8 reared--two generations.
Bluebird. --15 reared--two generations.
Cardinal. --10 to 12 reared--two generations.

Rose-breasted Grosbeak. --20 reared--three generations.
Black-headed X Rose-breasted Grosbeak. --Two hybrid males reared.

By H. Murray ( Brentwood , England)
Sufficient time has elapsed since the end of the war to enable a
more or less balanced set of opinions to be formed by a person whose
active participation in Aviculture has been, in the main, a post-war
development.
I feel it is right to say how much we comparative newcomers
owe to the more experienced people, and how readily these latter
will always give advice when asked. Actual experiences are quoted
and although no one person can solve the problems of another's
birds, general lines of management can be laid down and it rests
with the owner of the birds to adapt this information to suit his own
particular circumstances. I myself appreciate very much the advice
I have received from people who have set my wandering steps, speaking
aviculturally of course, on the right road.
The itch to buy any bird offered and to fill one's aviaries at all costs
lasted for my first two seasons, but after that I became a lot more
discriminating, although even now I often find it fatal to my financial
stability to talk to anyone who has birds to sell. I should imagine that
this also applies to about ninety-five per cent of the members of the
Avicultural Society.
One aspect of bird-keeping that must have been well known to
aviculturists before the war has struck me very strongly, particularly
this last year when a wider variety of birds has become available,
the immense superiority as aviary birds of the common favourites--
Zebra Finches, Orange Cheeks, Cordon Blues, Cuban Finches, etc.,
as compared with the much more expensive and difficult species.
I have no doubt that many will disagree with me, but I contend
that for general liveliness and even for looks, there is no comparison
between say a Lavender Finch and a Melba, or a Cordon Blue and a
Ruficauda.
It is probably the extreme liveliness and vivacity of these smaller
Finches and Waxbills that makes them do so much better over here
than the more lethargic species. These latter birds seem to sit and
brood over the hardships of their lot and put up little resistance to an
early end. In spite of the fact that I consider the cheaper birds the
better, I regret that this does not stop me from buying the more
expensive ones as they and the necessary finances become available.
Softbills are more attractive and I hope that in the future I shall
be able to go in for them in a bigger way, but for a person whose time
for looking after birds is limited the Finches seem to be the best

choice if only for the fact that so many more can be attended to in
the time available and in a restricted space.
Waxwings are still the apple of my avicultural eye and the
appearance of these birds in a large aviary is very fine. They also have
one advantage over the general run of softbills, they are perfectly
hardy and can stand the greatest cold without difficulty.
The two Waxwings in my possession keep very fit on a diet of dates
and such oddments as they find for themselves about the aviary.
They often go down on the very large pile of seed thrown down in the
flight, and as far as I can see eat groats that have been shelled by the
Parrakeets. The normal soft food provided for them is usually un-
touched, and indeed, if eaten, generally passes straight through
them and thus they become one of the dirtiest birds that one can keep
in a cage.
The reputation that they have for being greedy and getting over-
fat is quite unjustified and in my opinion is purely the outcome of
wrong feeding and the lack of sufficient exercise. Dried leaves and
empty husks of seeds are also eaten, this presumably providing the
roughage that is so necessary to their well-being.
Like many others, I have found this last summer interesting.
For the first time for eleven years it has been possible to buy birds in
a wide variety and I now possess a reasonable collection of some
hundred or so birds of about thirty species.
Breeding results in 1950 have not been very spectacular, but have
been sufficient to prevent disappointment.
Parrakeets did fairly well, ten young Cockatiels and three Bourkes
Parrakeets being reared. The Elegant Parrakeets made no attempt
to nest, and late in the summer the cock hit his head and died of
concussion.
British birds were only moderately successful. Redpolls reared two
nests, and the Linnets also. The Siskins hatched four fine young
birds, but the cock decided to take no interest in his family and the hen
reared one bird only. This was unfortunate for I had hopes of doing
fairly well with these difficult but most attractive little birds.
Last year Bullfinches bred very freely, but the old hen bird died
in the spring and her daughter, although she laid innumerable eggs,
only sat closely on one clutch. The young were reared up to ten days
old and then died.
A pair of Hawfinches progressed as far as making a nest, but the
hen became egg-bound and decided that she had done enough for
one season and retired from further efforts in that direction.
It is possible that not many members have seen the mating display
of cock Hawfinches, but it is not without interest. As is usual, the wings
are drooped and the tail spread to show off such beauties as they
possess, but apparently the superlative charm of the cock bird is the

grey on the neck. The head is lowered and twisted slowly from
side to side so that the hen may miss no detail, but as usual she seems
more bored than excited at the cock bird's attentions and one can
only hope that he gets some amusement from displaying. Once
paired, cock and hen Hawfinches are very affectionate in their manners
and are reputed to sit side by side with the cock's wing shielding the
hen. I did not observe this with my pair, neither did I have the terrific
pre-mating fights that seem to be general. The cock bird sang all the
summer in a rather Bullfinch-like manner.
Among the small foreigners there were many nests, but not much
in the way of fledged young. Three Firefinches were reared and three
Cuban Finches, but Orange Cheeks, Cordon Bleus, Green Avadavats,
Scarlet Avadavats, Red-eared Waxbills, Golden-breasted Waxbills,
and Ruficaudas all nested without result.
The old joke about fishermen and the " One that got away "
had a parallel with me this year. In the late summer some bird
nested and laid one egg, but although I watched very closely I could
not trace it; the bird never sat and I still do not know to which species
it belonged. I have never seen a nest like it before and the egg was
mottled. I think it was a Nonpareil Bunting.
The 1950 season is over and although compared with many people
my results are too unimportant really to warrant recording, I have
enjoyed it and feel that I have learned a lot.
Avicultural Society Medals are for the fortunate few, but for the
many amateurs like myself what more can one wish for than amusement
and the gaining of a little knowledge from one's hobby ?

and Germain's Peacock Pheasants. Unfortunately, Mr. C. Hooke
had to give up his collection for reasons of health, and Mr. J. W.
Steinbeck had all his birds destroyed by the State authorities because
of a possible contamination by diseased birds imported from China.
It is a very great loss, which could have been avoided by less extreme
and just as efficient measures. He had a marvellous breeding stock of
Tragopans, Monals, Peacock Pheasants, the best series of Pigeons and
Doves in captivity and a great many Australian Finches. Mr. Steinbeck
however has been indemnified and has partly reconstituted his collec-
tion. But several rare species are now irreplaceable.
Mr. R. Statler, Sheboygan, Wisconsin, has bred a number of
Mikados. Mr. H. Lehman, in Pennsylvania, who owns one of the best
collections of Pheasants, has raised many as usual, including Siamese
and Bornean Firebacks, and Germain's Peacock Pheasants. Mr. W. J.
Mackensen, Yardley, Pennsylvania, has reared lots of Pheasants,
Peafowl, and waterfowl, including Magellan Geese, Ghiloe Wigeon,
Red-crested Pochards and Cinnamon Teal, and many Elliot's
Pheasants, as well as some Brown Grossoptilons. A number of water-
fowl, including 3 Red-breasted Geese, have been reared on Mr. Dillon
Ripley's pond at Litchfield, Connecticut, and at West Redding, in the

The Chairman, opening the meeting, said that for the fourth year in
succession the Club had the honour and pleasure of the presence of
Madame Derscheid. He also welcomed Sir Philip and Lady Manson-
Bahr, Sir Godfrey and Lady Davis, and Dr. and Mrs. Sheffield Neave.
A very welcome guest was Lord Alanbrooke. He did not propose
giving a list of the many offices held by Lord Alanbrooke, but he would
like to mention that he recently accepted the Presidency of the
Zoological Society of London, a fact that would give satisfaction to
many. (Applause.)
Lord Alanbrooke said it gave him great pleasure to have the oppor-
tunity of visiting the Club and of showing his colour films of the
Golden Eagle. The first film was the result of sixty hours' observa-
tion of a nest in Banffshire, in 1949. The hide was erected about
15 feet from the nest and this enabled the taking of many interesting
" close-ups ". The second film dealt with two further young ones in
1950, and included some excellent head studies of the female parent.
Thanking Lord Alanbrooke, the Chairman said it appeared as
though Lord Alanbrooke had almost led a " double life "--as Great
Britain's No. 1 soldier and as a bird photographer of very great
skill. The large audience showed by its enthusiastic applause it had
thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the films shown.
Madame Derscheid was presented with a bouquet of spring flowers,
tied with the Belgian national colours, by Miss Kay Bonner on behalf
of the Club.
The next meeting of the Club is on 14th March, 1951.
The Treasurer begs to remind all members who have not already paid ,
that subscriptions (5^.) became due on 1st January, 1951.

Mrs. Vera Harmon, Inglewood, California, writes : " So far this
season we have about 105 young Gouldians from 11 pairs, mostly
Yellow-heads. That is not a very good record, but some of the pairs
have not started yet--and there are quite a few eggs in nests again
now, so we will see what happens."

A. H. Scott writes : "You will remember the pink and lavender
cock Bullfinch I sent to the National Show--a most beautiful
creature. This summer I managed to get three strong young ones
from him, so quite hope to produce a strain of this very lovely colour.
There were two hens and a cock. The expectation, according to my
records of such matings, is all daughters normal and half the sons
similar to the father. The normal son should be a carrier, so, with
two of them, next season should reward my efforts."

W. J. C. Frost returned early in November with yet another collec-
tion of birds. Included were twenty Birds of Paradise : 15 Red
( Uranornis rubra), a pair of Twelve-wired ( Seleucides ignotus ), 2 Magnifi-
cent ( Diphyllodes speciosa ), 1 Wilson's ( Schlegelia wilsoni ) : also 21
Crowned Pigeons ( Goura coronata ), a pair of Palm Cockatoos ( Micro -
glossus aterrimus), 2 Burmese Peafowl (Paw muticus). The London Zoo
took two Red Birds of Paradise ; B. H. Dulanty the pair of Twelve-
wired and the Wilson ; and G. E. Whitmore one of the Magnificents.
The Black Cockatoos went to P. H. Maxwell.

From Helsingfors, C. af Enehjelm writes : " There is, of course, no
breeding news just at present. I got 7 Cinnamon Zebra Finches
(5, 2) from Holland, and am now expecting a pair of White-backed
Zebras--the latest mutation.
" I have been striving for Silver Zebras, but have only got a cock,
which paired this year with a normal hen gave me 5 youngsters (3, 2).
They are normal in colour, of course, split silver. In an article about
a year ago by a South African aviculturist it was stated that the silvers
are dominant to normal. This has, at least in Denmark never been the
case, but it is quite possible they have another mutation in South
Africa similar in appearance to ours. If I remember correctly Keston
has advertised split silver, so it seems to be the same in England."

Aime Decoux, Gery, writes : " On 31st October I lost my old
Purple-headed Glossy Starling. I bought him in 1924. He was still
very pretty and did not die of old age : he was moulting and was
killed by another Starling.
&lt;c The breeding season was grand for doves and finches, not so good
for parrakeets.

Lorikeets, Stanleys, Crimson-wings, Red-rumps, Queen Alexandra,
Blue-winged Grass, and some Bourkes. The Many-colours did not
lay, and the Port Lincoln had clear eggs. The Rock Pebblers reared
three fine young ones. The Blue Masked Lovebirds had only two young
which were not reared ; they were killed in the nest by an odd cock."

The Southern California Chapter of the Avicultural Society has
held the following meetings :--
10th September, 1950, at Encino Park, corner of Genesta and
Venture Boulevard. Mr. Sedley gave an interesting story of his
Crimson Finch which lived to be 14 years. Mr. Wilms Herbert asked
all the members to save feathers for an Indian tribe in New Mexico.
1st October, 1950, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. David Ramsay,
8343 Tunney Avenue, Northridge. Members enjoyed looking at the
aviaries and the Mexican Parrot which talks very well. Mr. Cochran,
from Oxnard, spoke on raising eleven Gouldians from one pair.
Mrs. Behrens, who has been raising finches for twenty-seven years,
and is an authority on these birds, gave an account of nests which
could be looked at and those which could not, saying he Cordon Bleu
was the most touchy of all. She also told how eggs were moved from
a Diamond Sparrow's to a Shafttail's nest and how the latter raised
them. Mr. Rudkin, senior, said he had 105 aviaries and was still
building more, and that he was raising lots of Gouldians ; he also
hand-fed an American Goldfinch and raised it. Mrs. Hazle Scott told
of a Gouldian Finch belonging to Mrs. Harmon, a member of the
Society, which talks, saying " Pretty baby " ; this is the first time
a Gouldian Finch has been known to talk. Mr. Wilms Herbert
reported that he had raised a large number of Chinese Quail, Fawn
Zebras, Java Rice Birds, and some ivory coloured Zebra Finches.
Mr. Francis gave an account of his talking Crow which says " Buy
old Crow " and many other words and sentences. Mr. Hodgkins
said he had brought back some White Diamond Doves and Swamp
Quail from Australia. Mr. Rudkin stated that 16-gauge wire was the
best for making bands for banding birds.
5th November, 1950, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ferd Peck,
7407 Gloria Avenue, Van Nuys. Guests of the day were Mr. and
Mrs. Beidebach, of Santa Monica. The following were nominated
and unanimously elected for the new year : President, Harold
Rudkin, jnr. ; Vice-President, Ralph K. Whyte ; Treasurer, Muriel
K. Wright ; Recording Secretary, Olive W. Gilmer ; Directors,
Mrs. Gilbert Lee, T. J. Brinker, Ferd Peck, Mrs. Hazle Scott, Ellis
Wing Taylor, Wilms Herbert, Mrs. W. H. Towne, Dr. Hillard
J. Wright. In a discussion on the nesting of Lovebirds, Mr. Brinker
said it was good to rest the birds in the summer and for best results
to put up nestboxes about September or October. He also asked
members to get their birds paired up this fall so they would be ready
for the breeding season in the spring. Mrs. Floyd Lyman reported
that she raised twelve Blue Masks from one pair of Blue and Black

Mask Lovebirds this summer. Mr. Jerome Buteyn, from Luis Rey,
spoke on the numerous birds he had procured during the past month ;
he has a wonderful collection of psittacine birds and invited the Society
to see them next spring or summer. Mrs. Lee spoke on the wonderful
sea aquarium at Hermosa Beach, and said the San Diego Zoo has
a pair of Gang Gang Cockatoos and a Banksian Cockatoo.
3rd December, 1950, at the Sepulveda Woman's Club House, at
15236 Parthenia Street, Sepulveda. Mr. Rudkin, Jnr. showed beautiful
coloured pictures of his trip to Mexico and all the rare birds in his
aviaries and those of his father.

The most notable of recent arrivals was a collection of Sunbirds
from Sierra Leone brought home by Mr. J. Lester. These arrived in
excellent condition and included the following species : the Superb
Sunbird ( Cinnyris superbus ), Splendid Sunbird (C. splendidus), Coppery
Sunbird (C. cupreus ), Buff-bellied Sunbird (C. venustus ), Kemp's
Olive-bellied Sunbird (C. chloropygius kempi) , and Collared Sunbird
(.Anthreptes collaris). I think most people will agree that the first three
species are outstandingly beautiful. The most interesting bird to me
of this collection was a Grey-headed Olive-back Finch (Ne so char is
capistrata). This was not only new as a species but was the first of
its genus to be exhibited at the Zoo. This seems to be a rare or local
West African species and in its rather nervous disposition and actions
reminds one somewhat of the West African Twin-spot ( Mandingoa
nitidula schlegeli) . It is a sprightly creature and most attractive. A
brief description is as follows : head and neck grey ; rest of upper
side yellowish-olive. Sides of head white ; throat and mark on either
side of neck black ; under side mainly grey, but greenish-yellow
on sides of the breast. There are two other species of JVesocharis which
have never been imported.
A collection of Pheasants arrived from the U.S.A. through the
auspices of Mr. J. Delacour. It included two Versicolor, two White-
crested Kalij, three Elliot's and two Dusky Pheasants (P. colchicus
tenebrosus) . The latter are considerably darker than the melanistic
mutants usually seen in this country.
Our collection of Toucans has been increased by the arrival of
two Spot-billed Toucanets from South-East Brazil. These were
received in exchange from Copenhagen. From the same source we
obtained a collection of Fischer's and Masked Lovebirds and also
a White-winged Trumpeter.

From Mr. Louwman, of Wassenaar, Holland, we received a Lettered
Aracari and a fine pair of Piping Guans ( Pipile cumanensis).
Among Indian birds two Black-chinned Yuhinas, one Larger
Pied Wagtail ( Motacilla maderaspatensis) , one Large Indian Cuckoo-
Shrike, and one Hunting Crow, or Cissa, were presented by Viscount
Chaplin. Another Hunting Crow was purchased. The Yuhinas are
attractive little creatures reminding one of Zosterops in their diminu-
tive size and sprightliness. When in the Darjeeling area of the lower
Himalayas I often used to see flocks of these birds actively engaged in
searching for insects in the tree-tops. In their native country they
withstand a considerable amount of cold. The Cuckoo-Shrike is new
to us. He adores young mice and will eat as many as six at a time and an
occasional lizard. An interesting bird from the Cape, and one new
to our collection, was a Cape Sugarbird ( Promerops cafer) presented by
Viscount Chaplin which unfortunately did not survive. This bird
has somewhat the same habits as Sunbirds but is more nearly related
to the Honey-eaters of Australia. I have often seen them on the
Cape Flats near Cape Town where they have the habit of sitting on
the tops of bushes and then darting into the air to capture some
flying insect. They are particularly fond of the nectar of the flowers
of the Cape Sugar-bush {Protea).
An interesting addition to our Waterfowl enclosures were four
Marbled Teal (Anas angustirostris) . Although they occur in the wild
state not far afield, viz. the Mediterranean region, these attractive
birds have always been rare in collections.
Other birds of interest to arrive were a pair of Yellow Sparrows
(Auripasser luteus ) and a North American Ruddy Duck (Oxyura jamai-
censis )--a curious Stiff-tail, of which we now have a pair. A Green-
cheeked Amazon (A. viridigena) --a species from Mexico that is rare
in captivity these days--was presented.
A pair of blue Masked Lovebirds that arrived in the late summer
have bred and three young ones left the nest in a healthy condition
on the 20th December !
There have been a few notable deaths recently : an Australian
Pelican which was purchased twenty-six years ago ; a Fooks 5 Jay-
Thrush of old age--a beautifully marked species from Indo-China ;
and our Great-headed Maleo from Celebes. The latter is related to the
Brush Turkeys but is even more primitive in its nesting habits which
resemble those of reptiles. The Maleo lays its eggs on sandy beaches
above the tidal limit and after burying them leaves them to hatch on
their own simply by the heat of the sun. The young are active at birth
and are able to fend for themselves.

KARL PLATH-NEW BIRDS FOR THE BROOKFIELD ZOO
NEW BIRDS FOR THE BROOKFIELD ZOO
By Karl Plath

(Curator of Birds, Chicago Zoological Park, Brookfield, Ill.)
Among the new birds received at Brookfield during 1950 was a fine
pair of Javan Jungle Fowl. The cock bird is very handsome and
instead of having the hackles on the neck these feathers are scale-like
and green like those on the upper back of the Golden and Amherst
Pheasant. The hen, too, differs from the typical jungle fowls in being
more Partridge-like in appearance and character.
For the first time we now have a Great Bird of Paradise. It is
a magnificent creature much larger than our Raggi's or our Blue Bird
of Paradise. It arrived in rather untidy plumage--the plumes being
broken and soiled--but since its moult, which started in May, its
plumage is perfect.
While Sun Bitterns, Tufted Ducks, Comb Ducks, and Brazilian Teal
had been seen before we have never had them and they do add
interest to the collection. Also a pair of Swan-geese were added, and
it is surprising to me that we have not seen them in the past. They
are very handsome, but the only Swan-like resemblance I can see is
in the shape of the head and bill which in outline at least is much
like that of the Swan. The colouring is pleasing also--shades of brown
and buff with a dark brown band down the back of the neck. Other
new Ducks were the Cape Sheldrakes and the Yellow-billed Ducks.
Of small birds, Orange-breasted Barbets, Red-eared Tanager,
Hooded Tanager, Rieffer's Grass-green Tanager, and the Lesser
Magpie Tanager are very satisfactory as exhibition birds. The
Barbets are quite rare in captivity. The bird is illustrated under the
name of the " Plaintive Barbet " in the Avicultural Magazine of
March-April, 1950. The colouring in our birds is richer and brighter,
perhaps a fault in the plate-making. The Red-eared Tanager was
illustrated in the October number of 1938. It is mostly black with
red under-parts and a small though prominent red spot on the side
of the head. The bend of the wing and base of the tail are bright
shiny blue. The Hooded Mountain Tanager is probably the largest
of the family--being as large as our Robin. It is purplish blue above
with a black head and yellow beneath. The Rieffer's Grass-green
Tanager is more beautiful than one visualizes from description. It has
smooth compact green plumage of various shades and reddish-brown
on the sides of the head. The bill and legs are red. The Lesser Magpie
Tanager is also sleek and lovely in white and glossy black. It has
a long tail. At first we tried these four Tanagers in one large wall
cage but soon found that the smallest of the four, the Red-eared, was
also the most aggressive and vicious in disposition. He now gets
along very well with the big Hooded Tanager.

Of Waxbills, our new species were the Dufresne's, Black-cheeked,
Violet-eared, and Blue-breasted.
A sad loss was our Maynas Cotinga. We had waited months for
it to get here only to have it live two days. This to me is the most
beautiful of all the blue Cotingas. Almost entirely glossy sky-blue
changing to the tint called " sea-green " in certain positions ; its
small throat-patch of wine purple was an effective contrast. It had
very little black on the wing tips which hue is more or less prominent
in the other blue Cotingas. It would have been an achievement to
have it in our collection.
It is always exciting to a bird-lover to see for the first time in life
a bird which heretofore had been seen only as a museum specimen---
which so very rarely conveys the exact personality of the bird in life--
even the bird artist fails in his delineation if he has never seen the
live bird.
While this article is mainly to mention some of the new birds in
our Zoo I cannot resist bringing to attention the Lyre Bird which
I saw and heard for the first time while in Australia in 1949. The
pose as we see it depicted with the tail upright--as on postage stamps
or old illustrations--is quite incorrect. The tail is carried as does the
Pheasant carry his and in display it is thrown forward over the back
of the stooping bird. The underside of the long tail plumes are then
a shimmering mass of silvery white. The song of the bird, remarkable
because of its great size, is loud with a poignant, melodious quality.
The first live Lyre Bird I ever saw was a female in the Taronga Park
Zoo, in Sydney, and I heard her sing very beautifully even before
I saw her in the very large aviary provided for her. Later I saw
both male and female in the wild and also had the rare opportunity
of holding a downy, quail-sized, young bird in my hand. Other
thrills, also in Australia, were seeing the various Birds of Paradise
display--so different from drawings and mounted specimens seen
heretofore. These Birds of Paradise were in the unexcelled collection
in Taronga Park: 150 birds, 22 species !

THE FLAMINGOS OF THE CAMARGUE. By Etienne Gallet.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998741295454545" page_id="56288112"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1950. Price 15^. net.
The Camargue is one of the most interesting places in the world for
bird-life, and whoever has visited this marshy spot in the delta of the
Rhone remains for ever bound by its enchantment. Of all the birds
which are found in the Camargue the Flamingo is perhaps regarded
as the most typical, and Monsieur Etienne Gallet's book will be
welcomed by all those who have visited, or hope to visit, the Camargue.
Though books often lose much in translation, Mr. Summer Austin
has not allowed this to be the case in The Flamingos of the Camargue ,
and he is to be congratulated on his lucid and attractive style which
at the same time faithfully maintains the author's original version.
The book contains a wealth of careful and detailed observations,
and many interesting facts are given, those on the bird's diet, and the
growth and habits of the young being of special interest to aviculturists.
The first chapter is a description of the Camargue and its peculiar
geological formation, and brings most vividly to the reader a picture
of this wide desert-like space under a pitiless sun. The book continues
with historical allusions to the " bird with wings of fire ", its habitat
and migration, life and habits, menu and appetite, and love and
family life.
The description of the life and growth of the chicks in the flamingo
" village " is particularly interesting, and the author describes how
the mother bird gives the youngster tiny drops of a liquid, like clear
water, which is secreted in her beak. He raises the question as to why
this liquid is given and how it is produced.
The book concludes with an excellent series of biological notes on
the Flamingo, including a section on the influence of the bird on its
surroundings pointing out how it is mainly responsible for the destruc-
tion of its own breeding grounds. In the section " Foes of the
Flamingo " the author writes :--
" Man is the real enemy of the Flamingo. As an aviator he terrifies the birds
from nesting, as in 1944 ; as a native in search of food he comes to collect eggs or
chicks. Again a so-called ornithologist will systematically rob a colony of almost
all of its eggs, as happened in 1914. Others, like ourselves, disturb them by our
mere presence, despite every precaution. Some of the birds will certainly take to
flight, and in their panic will displace their eggs, which will thus be lost. Later
on, man's mere presence will cause a premature dispersal of the chicks and a
breaking-up of their little groups."
He goes on to mention that the other greatest foe is the Silver Gull,
describing how this bird will take advantage of any disturbance caused
by man, and concludes by saying--
" Man, then, is to be feared even more than the gull. He may constitute a
deadly menace to the species, unless he can control his predatory instinct and discipline
his curiosity, and so no longer jeopardize the future of this wonderful bird."

How true this is, and not only in the case of the Flamingo. So
many people are now interested in bird watching, and so many do
not realize the harm they do by too much watching that the birds if
they could speak would undoubtedly say " Save us from our friends ".
The fifty-three photographic illustrations by the author are truly
exquisite, each one being a gem of photographic art, as is shown by
the two plates which accompany this review.

RECORDS OF BIRDS OF PREY IN CAPTIVITY, By Arthur A.

Prestwich. London, 1950.
Birds of prey do not seem to appeal to aviculturists so much as do
so many other groups of birds, but any one who has ever kept these
interesting birds invariably expresses high satisfaction with them.
Despite the fact that birds of prey are not extensively kept, the list of
breeding successes is no mean one, the largest number, as might be
expected, being among the Owls. There are several records of the
successful breeding of Kestrels, but the records of Sparrowhawk are
confined to one statement by Dr. W. T. Greene, that " This species
has bred in confinement The Buzzard's efforts are restricted to a
number of hatching records.
The records are carefully compiled and efficiently presented in a
readable and interesting form, and this book will be valued by all
aviculturists.

BLEDGRAVE HALL. By J. K. Stanford. Faber and Faber.
London. 8 s. 6d.
A most pleasing fiction, based on the yet more pleasing fact of the
return of the Avocet as a breeding species to Britain. The hero who
has suffered much as a prisoner of war buys a derelict farmhouse and
adjacent marsh on the east coast. Here, where he can once more
feel at peace with the world, he settles down to rebuild the house
and watch birds in his spare time. A chance remark leads to the
discovery of Avocets nesting on his ground and another chance
remark in a different setting acquaints an unscrupulous and determined
egg-collector of the fact. From this point the action and excitement
reach " thriller " proportions, but all ends well--at least for the
Avocets and their guardian.
No reader can fail to sympathize with the hero in his struggles,
whether against the blighting hand of bureaocracy or the crafty
oologist. Some may, however, sympathize less with the author in his
whole-hearted lumping of certain birds and beasts (and oologists) as
" vermin ". The reviewer, at least--who has in recent years known

game-preservation--cannot agree with the implication that the egg-
collector is the greatest enemy of Britain's rarer birds and the game-

The book is beautifully and copiously illustrated with most lifelike
sketches by A. M. Hughes. Those of the Little Terns are particularly
delightful. It is, however, to be hoped that the slight but noticeable
facial resemblance of the " villain " to a well-known ornithologist--
who is not an egg-collector--is purely coincidental !

New Guinea Harpy Eagle.
Mr. Shaw Mayer, who has succeeded in collecting for the first time that rare species
the New Guinea Harpy Eagle, wrote to Mr. Frost about the bird as follows :--
" Am writing this in camp some hundreds of miles from Lae and five days

away from nearest airstrip. Have been here since last November and during
that time have seen only one white man, a Father who spent the night at my
camp. A few feet away in a makeshift wire enclosure is a lovely specimen of
Harpyopsis nova guinea, the first living one I've seen. Have had him since November,
1949. A young bird, now in his second year. How like he is to our friend the
Monkey-eating Eagle. Smaller but with that same narrow deep bill. The breast
white, and the feet bright yellow."
The bird was subsequently sent to the Taronga Zoological Park, for which Mr.
Shaw Mayer is collecting.
Longevity in an Amazon Parrot.
There is considerable misconception as to the age to which many species of the
Psittaci are reputed to live in captivity, most of them being alleged to survive much
longer than is usually the case. In view of the fact that Flower 1 (1925) could find
no evidence for the South American Blue-fronted Parrot (Amazona (estiva) reaching
the age of twenty years in captivity and that there are but few records of its attaining
more than ten years, the individual mentioned below seems worth recording.
On 23rd October, 1950, Mr. W. E. Lawrence, of the Zoological Society's Pro-
sectorium, received for post-mortem examination (per Mr. S. Croucher, Head
Keeper of Parrots), from Miss Hilda de Trafford, of Market Harborough, the body
of a male Blue-fronted Amazon. The bird had collapsed suddenly on 21st inst. and
died before treatment could be administered. It proved to be senile with extensive
atheroma of the aorta and renal arteries. On inquiry as to its previous history
Miss de Trafford kindly supplied a very full account of its confinement. It apparently
had been in her possession for forty-nine years and was said to be eighteen months
old on receipt. He had become more docile in his later years and had formerly
been allowed considerable liberty out of doors in summer time. He had in 1940
suffered from bronchitis but recovered with careful nursing. His diet was very
varied and apparently included some animal proteins and fat in the form of cheese.
This is an important point in my opinion, as there is no evidence of feather plucking
in his later years such as is often the case with aged captive Parrots. He does not
seem to have been much of a talker but would imitate familiar noises and whistled
a lot. He showed a preference for men when young, but latterly got on well with
women ; he was always fond of children.

National Cage Bird Show at Olympia, 1950
The decision to hold the National Cage Bird Show at Olympia invoked a record
entry of some 4,600 birds. Even with the much greater accommodation the hall was
frequently crowded to full capacity, in spite of the weather conditions, including
snow and ice.
The foreign exhibits were provided with a generous classification, in spite of which
a Striated Babbler thought he would stand a better chance elsewhere, so masqueraded
as a Nutcracker in the British Section. The 250-odd Foreign exhibits were staged
on either side of the main entrance for the full length of the hall, placed to attract
the attention of all visitors. The lighting, however, could have been improved ; it
was placed directly overhead, thus putting many birds in the shadow of their cages.
Heating also was far from adequate, and unless some improvement can be effected,
many exhibitors will think twice before sending such attractions as Sunbirds, Humming
Birds, and Birds of Paradise. Providing a hot room for casualties is worse than
useless, as change of temperature is more dangerous than a reasonably cool, constant
one.
The effect of the import ban on all Parrot-like birds was reflected in the com-
paratively small numbers, and absence of many of the most usual and attractive
entries of former years. No Cockatiels were on view, no Pennants, no Kings, very
few Parrots, Cockatoos, or Macaws, only one species of true Lovebird. Nevertheless,
some very good birds were competing, and Mr. Benjamin's cock Derbyan secured the
award for the best Parrot-like bird.
The seed-eaters, however, were very well supported, some classes having nearly
thirty entries coming from all quarters ; Grassfinches, Parrot Finches and Gouldians
from Australasia, Waxbills, Weavers, and Whydahs from Africa, Buntings and
Finches from the Americas, and Mannikins from Asia. Mr. Raymond Sawyer's
cock Peter's Spotted Firefinch took the premier honours in this section, most
deservedly.
It was among the softbills that the recent influx of birds was most noticeable.
Mr. Brian Dulanty's pair of Lesser Niltavas were a delight, and well merited the
award for the best Softbill. It was probably the first time a true pair had ever been
benched. Another outstanding exhibit was our President's Swallowtail Humming
Bird ; Mr. Ezra had quite a team, including Sunbirds and a Blue Tanager. Once
again we were able to see some Birds of Paradise--a Wilsons and a Red--both birds
were in fine healthy condition, but neither was in full plumage unfortunately ; it
was a very sporting gesture on the owners' part to send their birds, obviously more
for the benefit of the public than the hope of gaining honours.
Mr. Lynch's Touracou and Satin Bower Bird can now be accepted as perennials
rather than hardy annuals; both won first prizes as usual, although competition had
increased. In addition, great variety was provided by examples of several Starlings,
Toucans, Fruitsuckers, Bulbuls, Flycatchers, Pekin Robins, Zosterops, Pittas, Barbets,
Shamas, Tanagers, etc. Greatly as the return of these favourites is welcomed, it is
to be hoped that the importation of birds in overcrowded cages will not become
the practice of the trade; let us have only a few good birds rather than a few survivors
from " large consignments
Mr. Silver and Mr. Norris must have had a very pleasant task in judging these
birds ; the standard of quality was high, and many placings could only have been by
very narrow margins.
The organizers are to be congratulated in putting on so good a show, and in the
hard work of their stewards--the feeding and care of so large a number of birds in the
Foreign Section is a point to which few rarely give a thought.

" BIRD-SHOWS "
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984721" page_id="56288118"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
In view of previous correspondence on the above subject, in which I contended
that bird-shows did not exhibit aviculture in a favourable light to the lay public, I had
intended visiting the 1950 National Show in order to ask the opinions of one or two
non-fanciers present. This I was unable to do, but I was able to contact a non-
fancier who is a keen bird-watcher, and whose opinion is likely to be similar to that
of many others.
On the whole the show left him with a very definite bias against bird-keeping. He
was pleasantly surprised to see that most of the exhibits were in perfect health and
plumage, but he could not get over a feeling of repugnance at seeing such active
birds as Grey Wagtails and a Redshank in tiny prisons, even though he realized--
which most lay visitors of course will not have done--that they were not confined
permanently in them.
He was amazed at the apparent ignorance of bird-fanciers as to the species they
kept (or of the show officials responsible ?) which resulted in such " howlers " as a pair
of Blackcaps being labelled " Dartford warblers " and a bird which from his descrip-
tion was some species of Laughing-Thrush being exhibited as a " Nutcracker ".
Above all he was revolted to see a Swallow on exhibition. This indeed I found
hard to believe, but other witnesses who were equally displeased have since assured
me that it was so. Few things seem likely most justly to prejudice the public against
bird-keeping than exhibiting such birds as Swallows at a show of " cage-birds ".
One can conceive of certain circumstances under which it might be justifiable to keep
a Swallow, but none under which it should be exhibited at a bird show, where the
only inference the public will draw is that aviculturists are so insensitive to a bird's
natural aptitudes that they consider a Swallow to be a suitable subject to condemn
to life imprisonment in a small cage. I am quite sure not one aviculturist in a hundred
would think of caging Swallows, and indeed I almost suspect it may have been
some opponent of aviculture who showed the Swallow, which certainly did more
than cancel out the good impression given by some of the other exhibits to at least
two lay visitors.

BREEDING NOBLE MACAWS IN CALIFORNIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996288666666667" page_id="56288118"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
You may recall a paragraph in my article in which I stated the meanness with
which the male treated the female, much in the same manner as one would expect
to see when they are getting ready to nest. You may also recall that I even
suggested that they might be getting ready to nest again this season ; well, nest again
they did, and the following is the data compiled to date. It is not complete, but
I am more interested in getting the information of the second clutch of eggs and
subsequent hatching of young to you.
The female took up the task of sitting on 4th May, 1950, and after three weeks
or so of quite complete absence from the pen she began to appear more often. On
the 7 th June, with the aid of a mirror, I could see two young and two unhatched
eggs in the nest and I believe the young were from 10 days to two weeks old.
The old birds are very vicious, as they were on the previous occasion when with
young in the nest, and I have to keep my eye on them the entire time I am inside their
pen. I also have to with my African Greys, which too are very vicious as they approach
their nesting period, but they both seem to become quite gentle after the nesting
has been completed.
The Noble Macaw which was the weaker of the first hatching, is now a very fine-
looking bird and flies around just as nimbly as the other. If the colouring of the
adults is to be applied in sexing the young, then they raised a pair, and they are
exceedingly quiet and gentle, even after taken from the old birds. It is my opinion
they would make wonderful pets and talkers too ; they have that deep raucous
voice that seems to result in good talking.
I will report to you again on the second hatching of Noble Macaws, at the termina-
tion of the next stage of their development as soon as it can be determined. In the
meantime I hope that the old birds continue to feed them and bring them through to
adult stage. However the fact that they nested a second time in four months may
be of more interest to you than the outcome of the second effort.

NOTES ON SOME BIRDS OF HAWAII
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994452575757576" page_id="56288125"  page_num="39" year="" vol="">
By John Yealland (Slimbridge, England)
The story of the unique avifauna of the Hawaiian or Sandwich
Islands is for the most part an unhappy one, for within the past sixty
or seventy years many of the birds have vanished and at the present
time others are in danger of extinction.
A changed pattern of vegetation brought about by deforestation and
cultivation, the introduction of predators, the destruction of large
numbers of some species of birds by the Hawaiians, either for food or
for the feathers used in the making of the feather cloaks worn by the
chiefs or the feather leis and, quite possibly, the introduction in more
recent years of such exotic birds as compete for the available food
supply, have all contributed to the diminution or disappearance of
many of the indigenous forms.
Now, however, the prospect is brighter, for the Board of Com-
missioners of Agriculture and Forestry and the National Park
authorities are making every effort to preserve what remains of the
native flora and fauna. Forest reserves have been fenced off so that
sheep and cattle are no longer able to destroy the young trees and
low-growing plants within, while the feral sheep, goats, and pigs on
the inside have been or are being exterminated.
Strict protection laws are enforced, but the control of predators--
the mongoose, the rats, and the feral cats and dogs--remains an
almost insoluble problem.
During 1949 the Fish and Game Division of the Board of Agriculture
and Forestry inaugurated a project designed to try to save the almost
extinct Hawaiian Goose (Branta sandvicensis ) by breeding and rearing
the birds in vermin-proof pens. This is the second attempt of its kind,
the first having been carried out some years ago with successful
breeding results, but then the birds were given to various ranchers on
the island, and I believe it is correct to say that there is now only one
survivor.
This new project is under the supervision of Mr. J. Donald Smith,
the Board's Game Conservationist, and the site of it is at Pohakuloa,

J. YEALLAND-NOTES ON SOME BIRDS OF HAWAII
some 40 miles from Hilo on the " saddle 55 road between Mauna Loa
and Mauna Kea at 6,000 feet.
Two pairs of the geese have been loaned by Mr. Herbert Shipman,
who has kept a flock of them at Keeau, near Hilo, since 1918, and
a third pair is made up of a gander loaned by Mr. Paul Breese, the
Director of the Kapiolani Park Zoological Gardens in Honolulu, and
a goose which, by some extraordinary chance, was caught uninjured
by a hunter's dog.
One of the Keeau pairs bred, four eggs being laid during December,
1949, *f which two hatched, though all were fertile, and the young
ones were reared without difficulty.
The other two females and their mates took some interest in the
artificial nests primed with hard-boiled, white painted turkeys' eggs,
but no eggs were laid and it is possible that the one was too young
to breed and the other could hardly be expected to do so so soon
after capture.
The pens are designed to provide each pair with 2,500 square feet
of ground surface, and a good growth of clover and grass is ensured
by fertilization of the fine sand-like soil and daily watering by means
of a sprinkler system.
The main food of the goslings was the pualele or common milk
thistle (Sonchus oleraceus ), the species which grows commonly in gardens
here, watercress (which has been successfully planted at the overflow
of the water tanks further up the mountain side) being a second
favourite and the grass and clover only occasionally eaten.
When the young ones were sixteen days old the mother moulted,
losing all her flight feathers within a few days and, naturally, some of
her capacity for brooding, but in spite of this and the coincidence of
some night frosts, the little ones were not at all distressed but continued
to grow so quickly that at eight weeks old (when.I came away) they
were almost as large as the parents. This is particularly encouraging,
for it is hardly necessary to observe that the success or failure of the
project will depend on the quality of the young birds much more
than on their numbers.
The Keeau birds, being at sea-level, nested earlier, but unluckily
all the eggs were infertile and the reason is not easy to see, for although
the flock must by now be rather inbred, they are full-winged and live
in what appears to be an excellent place, consisting of several acres
of lawn and lake ; also they have bred in the past and from two
pairs in 1918 their number rose at one time to forty-three, but some
were lost when a gardener sprayed the lakeside weeds with an arsenical
preparation ; others disappeared when, in 1946, a tidal wave, which
caused considerable loss of life in Hilo, swept through the garden and
from time to time others have reverted to the wild state.
Less than a century ago the Hawaiian Geese were estimated to

number 25,000 ; at the present time the wild population must be very
few indeed, for during the first four months of 1950 no more than five,
two of them young ones, were known to have been seen.
In captivity on Hawaii there are seventeen, and outside Hawaii
only the pair which Mr. Shipman presented to the Severn Wildfowl
Trust and now in the collection at Slimbridge.
Except for one or two reported occurrences on the neighbouring
island of Maui, the Nene, as it is known, has not been found elsewhere
than on Hawaii itself. It is said by Henshaw to have ranged from
sea-level to 5,000 feet and upwards according to the season of the year.
The islands are all of volcanic origin and Hawaii is largely made up
of three mountains, Mauna Loa, an active volcano, Mauna Kea, an
extinct one, and Hualalai, and it is on the slopes of Mauna Loa and
Hualalai that the Nene lived and the few remaining ones have been
seen. On the sides of Mauna Loa there are " islands " of vegetation
more or less surrounded by more recent flows of lava on which little
or nothing is as yet growing.
These " islands ", some of them quite large, are very like moorland
country--moss and lichen covered rocks, a few trees, some grass, and
many low-growing plants, some of them bearing berries which are
eaten by the geese, a favourite being the Ohelo (Vaccinium reticulatum).
Here and there the lava is impervious enough to hold a little water,
but there are no streams or large areas of water.
The Nene is said not to fly much except at the commencement of
the breeding season and if the birds remain still it would be scarcely
possible to see them among the lava rocks. This and the extremely
difficult nature of the travelling across the lava makes any accurate
estimate of their numbers almost impossible.
In the past many of the geese were killed, particularly during the
flightless moulting period, by the Hawaiians for food. The mongoose
was introduced some sixty years ago in the hope that it would destroy
the rats which were doing much damage in the sugar cane plantations,
but evidently it found other foods, including the eggs and young of the
Nene, much easier to obtain, for the rats continue to thrive and the
mongoose is now very common, particularly at the lower altitudes,
though less so at 6,000 feet and higher because of the cooler conditions.
The Koloa or Hawaiian Duck (Anas wyvilliana) is another bird which
has rapidly decreased in fairly recent times and mainly on account of
the drainage of swamps and of being shot, but also, no doubt, because
of mammalian predators on some of the islands. This bird formerly
nested on certain islands off the coast of Oahu, bringing the ducklings
across the intervening sea, a distance of some three-quarters of a mile.
Now the Koloa is no longer to be found on Oahu or, I believe,
anywhere except on the island of Kaui where the mongoose has never
been introduced, though efforts are being made to re-establish this

Duck on Maui where, no doubt, it formerly lived, for as Henshaw
said, it " is widely spread over the archipelago, no island being
without it ".
This small Mallard has been successfully bred in the Honolulu Zoo
and Mr. Breese kindly presented a pair to the Severn Wildfowl Trust,
the first, I believe, to be brought alive to Europe.
During the winter the islands are visited by Pintail and Shoveler,
and among the casual visitants recorded are the Black Brant, the
Cackling Goose, and one each of the Lesser Snow, the Emperor, and
the American White-fronted Goose, the Buffle-head, and one Red-
breasted Merganser.
The commonest of the winter migrants is the Pacific Golden Plover
(.Pluvialis dominica fulva). These birds make a journey of some 2,000
miles from the breeding grounds in Alaska, the first-comers arriving at
about the middle of August. They begin to leave the islands in April,
and during those four intervening months complete a flight of some
4,000 miles besides raising their families.
These Plovers are far less numerous than in former years, and
C. W. Schwartz ( The Game Birds in Hawaii) says that &amp;quot;The only
obvious factor in Hawaii which may have contributed to their decline
was the former heavy toll exacted during the spring shooting season
He adds that at places along the coast visited regularly by the Plovers
hunters used to erect stone hides and shoot the birds as they came in
to decoys made from potatoes impaled on thin sticks stuck into the
sand. In places where the grass has been grazed short these birds
may often be seen searching for insects. During April I saw one, still
in its winter plumage, sitting on the ground and placing pieces of
dead grass around itself as if it was already thinking of nesting.
Two other winter migrants which are rare and which I did not see
are the Wandering Tattler ( Heteroscelus incanus ) and the Bristle-thighed
Curlew ( Numenius tahitensis ), both of which nest in Alaska, though it
was not until 1948 that the nest of the Curlew was found--as recounted
by Professor A. A. Allen, of Cornell University, at the Ornithological
Congress held at Upsala during 1950.
Pohakuloa, with its rather sparse vegetation due to an annual
rainfall of only 10 inches and very porous soil, is not a good place
for the native birds and, apart from some of the Plovers not far off,
the only ones I saw there were one or two pairs of the Amakihi
(Chlorodrepanis virens) , a pretty green and yellow bird which, from its
habits and appearance, reminds one of the Anthreptes Sunbirds, for
it feeds on insects and the nectar from the flowers of the Mamani tree
(1 Sophora chrysophylla) , a rather scrub-like tree which, both in foliage
and flower, is somewhat like the Laburnum.
About twelve miles off, at a lower altitude, where the rainfall is
heavier and frequent mists prevail, the Mamani branches are covered

with lichen which evidently harbours much insect life, for here the
Amakihi is much more common and one sees the birds searching the
lichen for insects as often as they feed from the flowers. I found a
nest of this bird there in a very open and conspicuous place among
the branches some 15 feet from the ground ; it contained two young
ones.
Another bird which was fairly common in the Mamani forest was
the Dusky Flycatcher or Elepaio ( Chasiempis sandvicensis) , a rather
pretty and very vivacious bird, hunting, whenever I saw them there,
in small parties for insects among the lichen-covered branches.
At about 4,500 feet and less, wherever the Ohia tree ( Metrosideros
collina ) grows, the pretty black, red, and white Apapane ( Himatione
sanguined) is common and conspicuous.
The flowers of this tree, glowing red against the dark foliage, appear
as if entirely composed of stamens and they contain a little nectar,
which seems to be the main food of these birds, for they fly from one
flower to another, never resting for more than a few seconds at each.
At the varying altitudes, as might be expected, the Ohia trees are
in bloom at different times of the year, so that at one place or another
I expect there is blossom all the year round. The birds rarely come
near the ground except in places where the Ohia trees are short or
occasionally to feed from the flowers of some introduced shrub.
The larger Iiwi ( Vestiaria coccinea), with its long curved bill, is very
like a large Sunbird both in appearance and in feeding habits. It also
feeds on nectar from the Ohia flowers. I did not see one and believe
it is correct to say that this strikingly handsome vermilion and black
bird is much less common than the Apapane.
The Hawaiian Owl (Asio jlammeus sandvicensis) is comparatively
rare on Hawaii and I saw only two or three of them in the grasslands
at about 4,000 feet. The small Buzzard, known as the Hawaiian Hawk
(.Buteo solitarius ), is also rare, and I saw only two of them soaring over
the tree-fern forest near Kilauea.
In the great Kilauea crater I saw some Tropic-birds, and again in
the Waimea canyon on Kaui, but in both cases they were such tiny
specks of white that it was impossible to tell which they were--
Phaethon lepturns or P. rubricauda.
On Maui I saw, quite near the road in a shallow lake, a pair of
the Hawaiian Stilt ( Himantopus h. knudseni). They were feeding with
some Turnstones ( Arenaria inter pres morinella), which quickly flew off,
but the Stilts continued feeding no more than 60 yards from the car.
On the far side of this lake were some of the Hawaiian Coots ( Fulica
americana alai ), which are extremely like the Common Coot.
These ten species were all the indigenous birds I saw, but I did not
spend more than a very little of my two months' stay elsewhere than
at Pohakuloa.

From time to time many exotic birds have been liberated on one
or other of the islands. Most have failed to survive but others seem
to be well established.
Various game birds are to be seen on Hawaii, among them the
Ring-necked Pheasant ( Phasianus t. torquata) and the Versicolor
(P.v. versicolor ), the latter rather local in distribution, and hybrids
between the two.
The Californian Quail ( Lophortyx californica) has a wide range and
was quite common at Pohakuloa. I should not have the heart to
shoot these delightful Quail, or the ability either, for they fly very
fast and low and are quickly out of sight behind the bushes.
The Japanese Quail ( Coturnix c. japonica) are not plentiful except in
small localities and not often seen because of their habit of remaining
hidden until almost stepped on.
The Chukor Partridge ( Alectoris graeca chukar) and the Common
Peafowl (Pavo cristatus) are present on Hawaii, but in small numbers.
There are also feral Pigeons originating from one of the domesticated
breeds.
The Common Mynah (. Acridotheres tristis) is all too common, and
Schwartz says of it that " It is known to pilfer the Lace-necked and
Barred Doves' nests. Other species probably suffer from similar
depredations ". This bears out what Rothschild has said of them,
but it seemed to me that they were more plentiful about the towns,
villages, and other human habitations, so may not constitute any
serious menace to the native birds.
The Pekin Robin ( Liothrix luted) is another well established bird and
common even at Pohakuloa where the food supply could not have
been very plentiful. When the Californian Quail were being caught
there for banding, the Pekin Robins were sometimes caught in the
traps, which were baited with broken maize. It seemed to me extra-
ordinary that these birds could digest such hard food, and I kept one
of them to see if it would thrive on a diet of maize alone, and found
that it did (though the maize in this case was much softened by
boiling), and even sometimes sang quite happily in its little cage.
It was liberated after about ten days none the worse for its plain
diet, and it is evident from the large numbers imported into Europe
in years gone by that this bird is very easy to please or it would never
have withstood the dealers' treatment. It is possible that these birds
eat some of the small orange bean-like seeds of the Mamani trees as
the Californian Quail do, and if so its digestion must be robust indeed,
for the pericarp of these seeds is so tough that horticulturists file it so
as to obtain germination within a reasonable time.
The Pekin Robin is reputed to eat the eggs of other birds when
kept with them in aviaries, and if it does so in the wild state in the
Hawaiian Islands it would be a serious enemy of the native birds.

J. YEALLAND-NOTES ON SOME BIRDS OF HAWAII
The Pekin Robins seemed to live a fairly gregarious life at Pohakuloa,
where their pretty song sounded particularly sweet in an otherwise
rather silent place, but they may move down to places where insect
life is more abundant, to breed, and it was at about 5,000 feet that
I found two nests, one with newly hatched young in March and the
other with young nearly ready to fly in early April.
The Japanese White-eye (, Zosterops palpebrosus japonicus) is also
common, and in gardens where fuchsias are grown these birds pierce
the flower tubes in order to reach the nectar. The flowers are never
pierced until they are open, so evidently the birds are clever enough
to know that the buds contain no nectar.
In the tree-fern forest I caught sight of one or two Spectacled
Thrushes ( Trocalopterum canorum ), while the Virginian Cardinal
(Cardinalis virginianus) is not uncommon and may sometimes be seen
in Hilo, where the Rice-bird ( Munia nisoria punctata) feeds by the
roadside with the ubiquitous House Sparrow.
In some places the Californian Linnet ( Cardopacus mexicanus frontalis)
is common and in the grasslands the Skylark ( Alauda arvensis ), intro-
duced from England to New Zealand and thence to Hawaii, is
flourishing.
I once went up on Mauna Kea to 9,500 feet on the very edge of
the tree-line, where scarcely any grass could find sufficient moisture in
the fine volcanic ash to sustain life, and even here one or two Skylarks
were singing as blithely as in the pastures far below.
Oahu is the island on which most birds have been introduced, and
Munro [Birds of Hawaii) gives a list which includes even Macaws,
while as far back as 1892 Palmer shot Mealy Rosellas on Maui.
Sea-birds are noticeably absent from the coast of Hawaii, but
between Honolulu and San Francisco one or two Brown Gooneys or
Black-footed Albatrosses (Diomedea nigripes) followed the ship until it
was some three or four hundred miles off the Californian coast, when
they disappeared overnight.

<bodyText confidence="0.984029651162791" page_id="56288133"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, England)
Although a limited degree of success has been obtained on the
Continent with birds that have been allowed their freedom, the
Budgerigar is not, by temperament and instinct, what might be
termed a " natural 55 homer. In a wild state it appears to be largely
a vagrant, like our Crossbill ; appearing in a district, breeding there,
and then wandering off not to return for an indefinite period.
The Budgerigar's swift and attractive flight and the many lovely
colours in which it is now bred make it, however, a most desirable
ornament to a garden, and a year's not unsuccessful work in evolving
a horning strain have taught me lessons which may be of value to
others inclined to make a similar venture.
For an experiment with homing Budgerigars it is desirable to have
a garden reasonably free from cats and House Sparrows and there
should be a tree quite close to the side of the aviary. There should,
in fact, be two aviaries, one for the liberty birds and another
" resting " aviary to confine those which it is necessary to restrain
from over-breeding. You can take certain risks with liberty Budgerigars
which you would not dream of taking with, say, exhibition stock, but
the one thing you must not do is to let your birds exhaust themselves
by over-breeding. An aviary for liberty Budgerigars must be made
more comfortable and attractive for the inmates than a normal aviary.
If the birds, and especially the young stock, have to sit in a row on
an artificial perch in driving wind and rain or blazing sun, as long
as they remain in the flight; if they have nothing to do all day, and
if at night have to jostle and fight for a place on a crowded perch in
the shelter, they are not very likely to achieve a warm regard for
" home " nor resist the temptation to seek more comfortable quarters
in the outside world. The aviary, therefore, must not be overcrowded
even when a full round of youngsters have just left the nest. There
must be ample perching accommodation in the shelter and in the
flight there must be considerably more shade, shelter, and wind-break
than is normally provided. It does not matter if this prevents you
from seeing the birds very easily as the chief ornamental display will
be outside the aviary and not inside. The flight should be well
furnished with natural branches occasionally changed. These will
provide the birds with occupation and amusement. The nest-boxes
should be hung up in pairs round the flight, two being allowed for
each hen, with a certain number of " extras " in addition for early
breeding young birds.
Size, shape, and correct markings do not matter in liberty birds.
What are required are hardiness, intelligence, activity, and prolificacy.
Colours will be selected according to the taste of the owner, but

blues, whites, and yellows make a prettier show in flight than greys,
olives, and greens and a shade that is bright in first plumage is also
desirable. Red-eyed birds can be produced as homers but their
defective eyesight probably makes them rather less suitable for liberty
than dark-eyed specimens.
In the wire roof of the aviary flight there should be a hole, a few
inches in diameter, which can be opened or closed. Immediately
beneath it there should be a food tray on a tall stand, deep enough
to avoid the spilling of seed, easily cleaned, and coming to within
about a foot of the roof. To assist the Budgerigars in finding their
way out there should be a small detachable "ladder" of cross perches,
the top rung of which is level with the exit hole and the bottom one
is only just above the seed. A small, detachable, inward-pointing
funnel of wire netting about 4 inches long and just wide enough for
a Budgerigar to climb down comfortably should also be provided to
fit in the entrance hole. It is put in position towards the close of the
day (but not later than midday in mid-winter), its object being to
confine the birds as they come in for their last feed and prevent them
from roosting out and being killed by Owls. Before the wire funnel
is inserted the ladder is, of course, removed, being hung in position
again next morning when the birds are released. A Budgerigar at
liberty, feeling hungry or wishing to rejoin its companions, is quickly
attracted by the sight of the latter on the feeding tray and enters
through the hole or down the funnel. Seed should also be kept in the
shelter, but the outside supply not only acts as a bait for birds at
liberty but also supplies the soaked seed so useful to the birds' health,
as rain usually falls on it. It must not, however, be left more than
a week or it may become sour or mouldy.
Great care should be taken when feeding or cleaning out the
aviary not to allow a single grain of seed to fall on the ground outside,
as this will attract wild birds and lead to the nuisance of their entering
the aviary. Sparrows which do so should at once be slain ; less
obnoxious birds should be caught up until some member of the
household is able to release them many miles away--and it must be
a very long distance away as their homing faculty is often surprising !
It is of the utmost importance to remove the first offender directly it gets in.
If the line be taken that "just one or two don't matter " there will
quickly be a crowd, involving much disturbance of the Budgerigars
and much net-chasing and trouble for their owner. If there is a
danger of cats, or smaller four-footed vermin, getting on to the roof
of the aviary a " projecting-rim " arrangement round the aviary must
prevent them from doing so.
Until Budgerigars of a guaranteed homing strain become available
the following procedure will have to be followed with regard to stock.

modate, from a breeder who keeps his birds in a large outdoor aviary.
Avoid big, fat, show Budgerigars bred in indoor aviaries or cages.
If these find themselves at liberty they are apt to behave like larger
Parrots that have been long caged, which go towering up into the
sky, settle only on the tops of the tallest trees, and by the time they
learn to fly down are miles away from home and completely lost.
Keep the aviary closed until the young of the first round are
beginning to leave the nest. In the ensuing test of homing ability an
odd cock or two may go in and out and prove a homer, and a hen or
two, and one-third of the cocks may stray. (Hens are always rather
better stayers than cocks.) The rest will be " non-exits ", i.e. birds
that do not trouble to leave the aviary at all.
You can either try and replace the errant cocks for the second round
or allow the remaining ones to commit bigamy, which they will readily
do, their second wives rearing their young well enough with little help.
The young birds will soon begin to go in and out of the aviary
freely and make a pretty show, but during the ensuing eight weeks
two-thirds are likely to stray. This means (since there is no need to
remove any eggs) that from each pair you should obtain in the first
round about a couple of real homers. The second round, for some
unknown reason, may produce less than half the number of homers
that the first round produced and most, if not all, may be hens.
If among the young Budgerigars there are one or two of particularly
attractive colours you would be sorry to lose, it is not a bad plan,
after they have found their way in and out a few times, to catch
them and put them into the " resting " aviary until they are adult
and ready to take their place in a breeding team.
When the hens of the foundation stock begin laying their third
clutches they, too, should be transferred to the resting aviary and the
eggs thrown away. The adult cocks can join them as soon as the
second round young can feed themselves without paternal aid. By this
time the homing young of the first round, though only three months
old and still in immature plumage, will be coming into breeding
condition and, shocking as the idea may be to orthodox Budgerigar
fanciers, you can let them breed ! When they have reared their first
round, of which 50 per cent should this time prove homers, the hens
may moult or they may try a second round, but in any case if, and
when, they start to re-enter their nest-boxes they should be transferred
to the resting aviary. The cocks can either be put with them or left
in the liberty aviary for the winter. The second-round young from the
foundation stock may moult and then start breeding at the same time
as the young from the first generation of homers. As the cold is likely
to induce egg-binding, especially in immature hens, it is well to
transfer them also to the resting aviary as soon as they begin to enter
the boxes freely. On no account, however, should you remove the

nests or you will have birds straying or nesting in trees, an undesirable
habit to which Budgerigars are fortunately not naturally prone. The
next season you can start by taking one round only from your
foundation stock supplemented, if need be, by some homers. In place
of the unsatisfactory second round you can then take a round from
homers only and start getting rid of your non-exit foundation birds
and of your less attractively coloured homers. From then onwards
you can continue to improve your stock by selecting for homing
propensities and for colour.
One final warning. Homers, when breeding, can be left to go out
to find their own green foods, but do not try and force your non-exit
foundation birds out by giving them no green food in the aviary.

SOME NOTES ON CARING FOR THE SMALLER
SOFTBILLS
By Carl Naether (Sherman Oaks, California, U.S.A.)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.990391222222222" page_id="56288136"  page_num="50" year="" vol="">
To me one of the most intriguing phases of bird keeping is caring
for more or less tender softbills, of which I have quite a number.
In this group I would place small Flycatchers, such as the Niltavas,
Narcissus, and many other colourful species we occasionally receive
from India, and used to get from Japan and China, as well as the
numerous small Warblers, Wrens, and Robins, quite abundant in the
Orient and also in parts of Europe.
Perhaps the main reason why we do not find such birds more often
in the bird markets and stores is their very delicateness--they rarely
endure crowded shipping boxes or lack of suitable care en route.
Once their plumage becomes soiled to any appreciable extent they
soon take on that bedraggled appearance suggestive of poor physical
condition. However, I have seen such birds arrive in this country
from the Orient, each in an individual wooden cage, quite alert and
contented, and in excellent plumage. I well recall the sizable array
of magnificent Blue-throats, Yellow-throats, Niltavas, and Redstarts
that arrived in beautiful shape in this country from India some years
ago, each one in a separate compartment, double-bottomed to keep
these birds' tender feet clean and healthy. It was a delight to inspect
that shipment--with not a single bird sick or injured.
When it comes to keeping small softbills in good health--either in
cage or in aviary---one of the first rules is to avoid placing them in
with much bigger birds for whom they are no match when it comes to
defending themselves. These larger fellows will almost invariably boss
cage or aviary, especially if either is not large and offers no escape for
the smaller inmates ; and, worst of all, they will, so to speak, " hog "
on to all the best food with the result that the smaller birds, having

constantly to fight for food and drink, will soon become discouraged
and give up. I have frequently seen a Thrush, Bulbul, or other fairly
sizeable bird kept with smaller birds boss the whole flock to such an
extent as to prevent many of them from getting food and water
regularly, or at all. Taking a position near food or water containers,
the bully will not allow any other bird to get near them. Of course,
one way to avoid this bad situation is simply to place a number of
food and water dishes in the same aviary ; but the most effectual
remedy is to remove the big birds and to keep small softbills only with
birds of their own size, always giving them ample space--space within
which not merely to hop from perch to perch but really to let the
wings go. In cages this usually means placing perches sufficiently far
apart to compel the birds to fly often.
Naturally, being of somewhat delicate health, small insectivorous
birds require more frequent and more painstaking looking after than
do the larger ones with robust physiques and with plenty of resistance.
Most of these little fellows are extremely fond of bathing. Thus, my
Narcissus as well as my Blue Flycatchers will bathe every day, even
in rather cold weather--of which even here in sunny Southern
California we get a good deal. And they really wet themselves when
they bathe--so much so, in fact, that often they are unable to fly at
all, remaining on the ground until their feathers have dried. When
they bathe late in the day they have to be watched, particularly in
cool weather, for then their plumage may not dry quickly and the
birds soon get chilled and may take sick. Moreover, a small bird in
such condition, unable to fly and get away, is easy prey for larger
birds who may " have it in for them ". A few days ago I rescued a
Blue Flycatcher, all wet from bathing and wholly incapable of lifting
wings in flight, from a Cuban Clarino, that was attacking him almost
viciously on the ground and which would, quite probably, have killed
him had I not removed this aggressive Cuban immediately.
Another and very important aspect to watch in keeping small
softbills is the condition of their feet. If these get caked with dirt,
infections develop quickly and are often difficult to treat, at times
impossible to cure. The bottoms of the cages in which such birds are
kept should be covered with soft, absorbent paper, and that paper
should be changed at least once a day. In the case of heavy fruit-eaters,
I change the paper twice a day. Anyone unwilling to keep birds in
good condition by means of the right sort of care simply has no
business owning them and should leave their care to more conscientious
persons. Birds, such as Blue-throats, certain Wrens, and others that
stay on the ground most of the time, must have soft footing that
will not injure their tender feet--and it should be reasonably dry.
Fine, washed sand, changed frequently, is quite suitable in cage and
in aviary. Some birdmen use peatmoss, which is very absorbent, but

also somewhat dusty. Still others avoid foot troubles among their
birds by simply providing cages with double bottoms, that is, placing
a wirescreen an inch or so above the regular cage bottom so that all
droppings will fall through the screen. Fortunate is he who keeps
softbills that prefer never to set foot in the bottom of cage or aviary.
Thus, I have a few colourful Manakins whose dainty red feet are easily
maintained in sound condition by providing clean perches and clean
food and water containers ; for I have yet to see these dainty creatures
alight on or hop on the bottom of their cage. They always perch.
When it comes to feeding tender softbills, special attention to their
peculiar dietary requirements will often prolong, even save, their lives.
My basic item on such birds' menu is Spratt's Mockingbird food
thoroughly mixed with freshly grated carrot and a fairly generous
portion of meatmeal. To this mixture I always add some finely cut
hard-boiled egg. Most softbills, in my experience at least, like hard-
boiled egg almost instinctively. Both Bewick and Canyon Wrens
relish egg. All my Flycatchers pick it out of the mixture first of all.
The Wrens get dried ant-eggs soaked first in hot milk for some time
and then mixed into the soft food. The Manakins get diced sweet
apple and skinned grapes, but best of all they like ripe avocado,
which they get daily and of which I happen to have a steady supply,
since I grow the fruit myself. While ripe banana is supposed to be
the main item in the Manakins' diet, mine will not eat banana any
more but give avocado the preference. I simply cut a fairly ripe
avocado lengthwise in halves and place them in the birds' food dish.
Practically all the small softbills relish sweet apple and also sweet
currants, the latter thoroughly softened in warm water first. Another
important and quite tasty item in their daily diet--one which I have
used for many years with excellent results--is equal parts of spongecake
and pablum mixed with sufficient milk to make a very soft, not too
thick, mass. My Flycatchers, Robins and Orioles relish this con-
coction especially. Since it has a tendency to sour in warm weather,
I feed it fresh daily year in and year out. Finally, I give the smaller
softbills the smallest mealworms I can find, and other live food in season.
If I cannot get small mealworms I take medium-sized ones and throw
them in hot water first to soften their shells sufficiently to make them
more digestible for the birds. I recall losing a very rare and precious
Uguisu once for lack of small mealworms.
On the above-mentioned feeding regimen I keep Bulbuls, Wrens,
Flycatchers, Robins, Manakins, Bluebirds, and other more or less
dainty feathered creatures in good health. As you will have noted,
I believe in ample variety and in very nourishing food. While some
of it may have a tendency to fatten the birds, the exercise they get
in spacious cages and aviaries prevents them from getting too fat.
Some of my readers may object to such a feeding scheme on the

ground that it requires too much time to prepare the various dishes.
But I have not found this to be the case. One develops a definite plan
in preparing food for softbills. It rarely takes me more than an hour
a day to feed all my birds, in cage and aviary, and I keep about
half a hundred. This hour passes rapidly, since feeding birds is
one of the most enjoyable chores on my daily programme. Since
I leave for work very early in the morning I always do my feeding in
the late afternoon, several hours before the birds are apt to retire for
the night. Moreover, I can leave sufficient feed for them to last
several days if need be, even though regular daily attention is
indispensable to success in keeping delicate softbills.

(Forpus passerinus passerinus)
By G. af Enehjelm (Helsingfors, Finland)
In the autumn, 1948, I got two pairs of Green-rumped Parrotlets
from Holland. The birds arrived in quite good condition and the first
winter I kept them together in a roomy box-cage in the birdroom in
the dwelling house. I had ringed the birds and observed which kept
together, as I have always believed in leaving the choice of mate--if at
all possible--to the birds themselves.
In the spring I put one pair (pair No. 1) in an indoor flight in the
birdroom, size about 8 ft. by 6 ft. and 8 ft. high. In the same
flight there were several pairs of small birds : Red-headed Parrot
Finches, Diamond Sparrows, Cherry Finches, Zebra Finches, various
Waxbills, and a pair of Painted Quail, about a dozen pairs in all.
The floor of the flight is elevated about 2 \ feet above the floor of the
room, thus allowing plenty of sunshine from the large window. The
Parrotlets soon felt at home, and I never saw them disturb any other
birds, not even in the neighbourhood of the nest. The nest-box was
of upright pattern, rather roomy (18 in. by 18 in. by 10 in.) with
concave bottom covered with a handful of sawdust. After about a
month I saw the hen disappear into the nest, and on checking up
some days later I found six eggs. Four youngsters hatched, of which
one died and the other three left the nest at intervals of one day.
The parents started another nest ; six eggs were laid, five youngsters
hatched, and all left the nest in fine condition. The parents started
a third nest, again six eggs were laid, five young hatched and were
reared. As the birds made an attempt at a fourth clutch I removed
the nest-box, where I, by the way, found five eggs. I think that
thirteen healthy youngsters is a very satisfactory result. The other pair
(pair No. 2) was placed in a smaller flight (4 ft. by 4 ft. by 2 ft.) in

breed until very late in the season, at the end of September, so I
removed the nest-box, where I found four fertile eggs.
I am sorry that it was impossible for me to make any notes as to
laying, sitting, etc., this first season, as I was away on longer and
shorter journeys several times during the breeding season.
In 1950 pair No. 1 was kept in the same flight as the previous year
and the same nest-box was hung in the same position. Even though
I had to be absent on several occasions I succeeded in making some
notes this time. The box was put up on 23rd February and the hen
was observed visiting the box for the first time on 2nd March. On
9th March three eggs were seen in the box, and when inspecting
again on 14th March six eggs were found. Some days later there
were seven eggs in all. When inspecting again on 24th March there
were four youngsters, on 7th April all seven eggs were hatched. On
1 st May two youngsters left the box, followed by one each day on the
following dates : 2nd, 7th, 12th, 13th, and 15th May, seven in all.
The birds were fed by the father; I never saw the hen feeding them
outside the nest. I had a very busy time, so I had no time for observing
the nest, but as far as I could see she was sitting again. As I had to
make a journey I thought it safer to take out the youngsters, and on
29th May they were put in another flight in my other birdroom.
On returning from England I inspected the nest on 22nd June and
found two youngsters and six eggs in the box. On 2nd July there
were seven youngsters ; on 5th July all eight eggs were hatched.
On 27th July the first young left the nest and on 29th a second. At
this time I had to go to Denmark so I cannot say when the others
left the box, but on returning on 4th September all eight were
outside and thriving well. The hen was again sitting on six eggs, but
of the five young hatched one died on 5th October, followed by the
other four at intervals of a few days. I think the strain of bringing
up fifteen youngsters had been too much for the parents, so that the
last clutch was not fed so carefully as the earlier ones. I then removed
the box for the winter.
Pair No. 2 was put in one of my Budgerigar indoor flights (8 ft. by
2-J ft. by 7 ft.). In the same flight there was also a pair of Olive
Finches. This pair brought up two youngsters in the first nest, three
in the second. They also had a third nest late in the autumn but the
youngsters (four) all died. Two pairs from 1949 had one nest each
of two and three youngsters respectively, and made no further attempts
to nest. These pairs were kept in flights like pair No. 2, with one pair
of Cuban Finches and Lophospingus pusillus respectively. In no case
was any damage done to the other birds, the Cuban Finches also
bringing up their young at the same time. A fifth pair, consisting of
an imported cock and a 1949 hen, did not make any attempt, and

the same was the case with a pair of Blue-rumped Parrotlets ( Forpus
passerinus jlavissimus) and a mixed pair : Green-rumped cock and
Blue-rumped hen.
As mentioned earlier, the Green-rumps do not seem to be aggressive
towards other birds but they do not extend this friendliness to their
own or nearly related species. Pair No. i ignored a pair of Bourke's
in the next flight, but the pairs in the Budgerigar flights quarrelled
a lot though not to such an extent as to keep them from nesting.
I now prefer to keep them in every second flight only, with some other
species in the flight between them. Certainly they ignored Lovebirds,
Redrumps, and Gockatiels, but I should certainly hesitate to keep them
with any other Parrots at breeding time. Out of the breeding season
I have kept most of them in a bigger flight, 15 ft. by 8 ft. by 7 ft.,
about twenty together, without any trouble.
There is little doubt that my Pair No. 1 is something out of
the ordinary. Most pairs I have at present, and have had in the
past, usually had only four to five eggs in a clutch. I am anxious to
see how this really prolific pair behaves in 1951. I have had no
experience of this species in outside aviaries. The summer in Finland
being so short I could hardly put them out earlier than the
middle or end of May and possibly keep them outside until the end
of September. By that time the days are already rather short. Now
that I have sufficient material for further experiments and can put up
some more unrelated pairs, the progeny from pairs 1 and 2, and an
extra imported cock, I shall keep a couple of pairs back from breeding
and put them out in the spring in some of my foreign finch flights.
I am also expecting another Blue-rumped cock, so I can also put up
two pairs of this (sub ?-)species.
As to feeding : the birds have at their disposal white and Indian
millet, canary-seed, oats, and groats. They have a great preference
for groats. All the year round I am feeding sprouted millet, canary,
and oats. In the summer there is an unlimited supply of green food,
chickweed especially. I also get a limited amount of chickweed, salad,
and spinach in the winter from the greenhouse. Sprouted seeds and
green food are highly appreciated, they also take a lot of egg food,
insectile mixture, and even mealworms. Especially in the flight where
Pair No. 1 is kept there is a big variation of foods for the other birds,
more than in the single compartments. This may also be a reason for
the great prolificacy of this pair.
As to the species, I assume my Green-rumps belong to Forpus
passerinus passerinus (Linne)--previously named Psittacula guianensis
(Swainson) (Peters 5 Checklist, vol. iii, p. 204). This species was
previously the most commonly imported of the Green-rumped Forpus ,
according to Neunzig and Aviculture . They are certainly very nearly
related to the Blue-rumped Parrotlet (. Forpus passerinus Jlavissimus

Hellmayr)--formerly Psittacula passerina (Linne). I cannot distinguish
the hens of the two species ; they originate, however, from two different
direct importations, so I think I have placed the correct females to
the cocks. A crossing experiment would be of interest, but my attempt
in this direction did not succeed this season.
There is no difficulty in distinguishing the sexes : the cocks have
a brighter green colour, especially on the heads, and a cobalt blue
patch above and below the innermost wing-coverts. The blue colour
is completely missing in the hens. Even when still in the nest the
sexes may easily be distinguished.
In order to keep exact records I have always ringed every bird
with open aluminium Budgerigar rings, which are eminently suitable
for this purpose. In order to distinguish the birds without catching
them I have also used coloured celluloid Budgerigar rings, which is
quite practical if you keep several birds together and want to see how
the pairs mate, as I believe that the free choice is of importance for
a successful breeding result.

Since I had to leave my home in Koenigsberg, East Prussia, helter-
skelter at the end of January, 1945, I have been " birdless For a man
who started aviculture at the tender age of five (with a pair of Barbary
Doves) and has kept birds in many lands, even as a prisoner of war
in a Japanese camp, this is a hard fate, but I dare say I have to share
it with a good many of our members. Before my spiritual eye I
visualize, however, some birds of which I was especially fond, and of
these I beg to be allowed to write a few words so that members may
acquire them should occasion be offered. Most, if not all of them
have been mentioned by me in our Magazine, but I dare say my
authoritative essays have been forgotten, and, besides, there are many
new members. Let us start with the small insectivorous birds. Should
I ever enter a Chinese bird shop in springtime again and only be
able to buy one bird my choice would be Larvivora cyane. I do not
know either its English or German name. One might call it Blue
Ground Warbler. It certainly is a lovely creature, in size the same
as our Robin but slimmer and more elegant. Its livery is simple but
very distingue , shining marine blue above and silky white on the under-
side. The hen has, as far as I remember, the blue back tinged with
brown. Its song is very pleasing and consists of different distinct
stanzas. Only very few were for sale in the shops of the Chinese city
of Shanghai in spring and only once I found a hen. When I asked
a birdcatcher who had Colliopes, Blue Flycatchers, etc., for sale, why

he had no hens, he answered : " Hens number one good chow."
Poor hens ! Two other very recommendable birds always for sale in
the Shanghai bird market are the Ruby-throat and the Eastern Blue-
throat. Both of them have only been rarely imported, which is
certainly a pity for they are beautiful birds possessing a good
song. They are great favourites of the Chinese bird fanciers.
Ruby-throat hens were offered now and then but I never saw a hen
of Blue-throats. I will also mention the two kinds of White Eyes
{posterops simplex and Z osiero P s erythropleura) . Both of them sing very
pleasantly and are of a tame and confiding nature. Of smaller
Japanese softbills the most desirable in my opinion is the Loochow
Robin ( Erithacus komadori). He is a very handsome bird and a really
good songster. During my yearly holiday which I generally passed
in Japan I always found a few on sale in the bird shops of Nagasaki
and Kobe. As a rule also Blue Flycatchers, Narcissus Flycatchers, and
the small Bushwarbler {Horeites cantans) could be obtained. The latter
is an unobtrusive little bird of grey colour, but he possesses an
agreeable very powerful voice. The Japanese appreciate him very
much and call him " Unguisu ", i.e. Nightingale. I think he has been
very rarely imported. Coming to the larger softbills I must mention
the three kinds of Babblers which I have kept. The most valuable of
them is certainly the Spectacled Laughing Thrush ( Trochalopteron
canorum). In my opinion its song can hardly be surpassed, and a well-
trained " Hoamaee " (flowery eyebrow) is a very nice pet. Besides,
like all Babblers, it is a very lively bird and a very suitable co-
habitant for Pheasant aviaries. I am not aware of its having bred in
captivity, but in a well planted aviary it could easily be induced to
propagate its kind. The smaller Cinereiceps and Berthemy's Laughing
Thrush are also desirable birds and good songsters. Of Rock Thrushes,
I had Monticola albogularis and Monticola philippinensis, the White-
throated and the Chestnut-bellied Rock Thrush. Again, we have
here two beautiful birds ; the Chestnut-bellied is a good, and the
White-throated an excellent, songster. Of Chinese seed-eaters I can
recommend the Chinese and the Japanese Hawfinch, both easily bred
birds and suitable as an additional population for Pheasant aviaries.
Of the Crow tribe I would like best Lidth Jay and the Blue Pitta
from Formosa. Both birds have been imported, but on rare occasions
only, and both are a great ornament for any aviary.
No doubt there are a good many other desirable birds in far off&amp;apos;
Western China which have never been imported and of which I have
only seen coloured pictures in that old but excellent book Les oiseaux
de la Chine (The Birds of China), by Pere David. Of them I would
like best a big Tit of the size of a Blackbird, clad in deep yellow and
black. As far as I remember its name is " Sultan's Tit ". Further, in
the same book there is the coloured plate of a bird which must be the

next relation to the American Bluebirds. The picture shows a Thrush-
or, rather, Robin-like bird of the deepest blue in the regions of the
eternal snow. So it must be a hardy bird and I imagine it is a good
songster. If I remember right its scientific name is Grandala coelicolor.
May the days be near when these gems of the bird world reach
our markets to delight the hearts of many bird lovers.

ON THE HARDINESS OF CERTAIN

<bodyText confidence="0.99777875" page_id="56288144"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
By R. S. Mackensen (Yardley, Penn., U.S.A.)
It has occurred to me that an article on the hardiness of the various
Pheasants and waterfowl in our collection here at Yardley, Penn.,
might be of interest and helpful to other collectors or would-be col-
lectors in the same temperature zone.
It is not unusual for us to experience zero and even occasionally
sub-zero Fahrenheit temperatures during the winter months. If you
will keep this in mind as I describe our methods of wintering the various
species, it should give you a good idea as to their hardiness.
Most of the ornamental Pheasants are kept in outdoor pens with
two feet of boards around the bottoms of their sides and a small lean-to
feed-shelter against these boards on one side. In such pens we keep
Golden, Amherst, Silver, Bel's, Reeves, White, Versicolor, Cheer,
White-crested Kaleege, Nepal Kaleege, Lineated Kaleege, Swinhoe,
Elliot, Brown Eared, Blue Eared, and Impeyan Pheasants. All of
these species seem perfectly able to withstand any deviations in the
weather here.
The Tragopan and Mikado Pheasants might also be placed within
this category. However, because of their rarity, we provide them
with a little more elaborate enclosures. They are given shelters with
board floors raised above the ground and closed on all sides except
the south. No heat is provided. Bedding of some sort is placed over
the floor.
In the same manner we also winter the Edwards, Imperial, and
Siamese Fireback Pheasants. The Edwards will occasionally, and the
Siamese Fireback will frequently, freeze their toes and feet if they are
too much exposed to the bitter cold. We consider temperatures below
15 degrees Fahrenheit as dangerous to these birds. To avoid this
danger, they are given shelters with no roosts inside so that they will
squat in the bedding, thus affording protection to their pedal extremi-
ties.
The only Pheasants which we provide with artificial heat are the

just enough heat to prevent the temperature from going below 25

All of our waterfowl are successfully wintered without artificial
shelter. There are a few species which require open water during
severe cold, to protect their feet fromfreezing. These are the Tree-Ducks,
Black-necked Swans, and Orinoco Geese. In lieu of open water, they
may be housed in sheds similar to those required for Edwards and
Siamese Fireback Pheasants.
We find that the following waterfowl can take the coldest weather
without even requiring open water: Mute Swans, Black Swans ; Canada,

species provide any problem for wintering them in our climate.
Thus it is quite apparent that even in rather cold areas one may
keep a great number of Pheasants and waterfowl without going to
extreme trouble taking care of them through the winter. In fact it
has been our experience that the birds will stay more healthy and breed
better if they are not coddled more than is absolutely necessary.
It goes without saying that such birds must be well fed at all times
so that their body temperatures and resistence to the elements is
maintained at a high level. We have developed a very simple and
extremely successful feeding programme for Pheasants and waterfowl,
which I shall perhaps describe at a later date.

By E. N. T. Vane (Great Missenden, England)
A note appeared in the last issue of the American magazine Aviculture ,
regarding Mr. Rudkin's Leadbeater's Cockatoos not breeding until
they were ten years of age. Owing to two pairs behaving similarly,
it was assumed that this was the normal age for reproduction to
commence. It may therefore be of interest to record that one of my
pairs reared their first nest of three lovely young birds when the cock
was two years old and the hen four. Both birds were aviary-bred in
this country. I believe that their parents also were aviary-bred, but
have no confirmation on that point.
This year the same pair hatched three young, which were doing well
until a wretched farmer sited his hay-baling machine about fifty feet
from their aviary. The noise so intrigued the inquisitive Cockatoos
that the young were not fed and were lost. After the excitement died
down, another attempt was made with a second clutch, a thing I had
never heard of before with these birds, in England at any rate, but
the cock would not take his turn at incubating, so it came to nothing.
Almost invariably my pairs seem to lay three eggs and rear all the
youngsters.
The behaviour of my Noble Macaws compared with those in
California is also rather interesting. Again my birds successfully
reared four more young this year. In view of the lengthy time the
brood are in the nest box, a second brood would be quite out of the
question in our climate, even if the birds showed any inclination to
go again, which they did not do. In 1949, however, when I had two
hens with one cock, I believe the cock would have put the second hen
to nest if another box had been provided, but I would not take the
risk of losing the brood I already had from the first hen. Neither
was I sure whether the cock took any turn at incubation or brooding,
for unlike Mr. Rayson Brown, I am unable to this day to distinguish
the sexes.
A second pair that I retained did not lay any eggs, but they always
sleep in the nest box the whole year round. Again, there is no
difference in the appearance of the sexes, neither have I been able
to note any in any of the eight young reared, nor in the four original
specimens. These young birds attained adult plumage when a year
old. I have had several losses with pneumonia, but the birds appear
to be more accustomed to our climate after three years, and are hardier.
They have all lived outdoors all the year round without heat. They
do not appear to feel the cold, although they have a habit of huddling
all together in a row on the perch. They do this when warm as well
as they preen each other.
In my opinion these birds are very attractive subjects for aviary life.

They are entirely different in their behaviour to the Australian Parrots,
and are not guilty of causing great damage to the woodwork in their
quarters. Many people seem to take it for granted that being Macaws,
and moreover being called " Noble " that they are enormous and
naturally destructive, but such is far from the case. They are little
larger than a Rosella, and smaller than a Pennant. As for damage,
when I had one in hospital recovering from a chill, it was allowed the
run of the room which was lined with soft insulating wallboard, and
no attempt was made to tear the boards. A Cockatoo would have
wrecked the joint in a few minutes.
In Lord Tavistock's book it is stated that there are records of Kings
being double brooded. I had never come across such an instance,
therefore the fact that mine reared two broods in 1950, is probably
worth recording. As a rule this pair--a Greenwing cock and common
hen--go to nest in late April. This year they started early in the
month, laid four eggs, and hatched and reared two youngsters, both
very good specimens as usual. During August I was very busy making
arrangements to move, and the birds were left mostly in the charge of
an attendant. I was not aware that the hen was sitting until near the
end of the month, when I thought I heard young birds being fed.
It is quite a habit for this hen to go in and out of the nest after rearing
her family, but hitherto she had always been leading me up the
garden as Barrabands so frequently do. This time it was found on
investigation that she had again laid four eggs, and hatched two more
fine youngsters, which left the nest at the end of September. The
sequel was not so happy, however, as the day the young left the nest
they were both attacked by a pair of Amazons in an adjoining flight,
and had their feet and bills damaged ; one recovered but the other died.
Another interesting feature is that this youngster, who is now only just
over six months old, is plainly a cock, as there are many scarlet feathers
already showing down the front of his chest. If only young
Crimsonwings, Ringnecks, and some others would be so obliging in
their early youth !
The Amazons mentioned above are the rather rare yellow-cheeked
variety. They spent a good deal of time in and out of their nest box,
and although they have been observed mating on several occasions,
no eggs resulted last season. There is no red shoulder patch in this
species, consequently this feature cannot help in sexing the birds.
In this pair, however, the cock has a bright golden iris which is darker
brown in the hen. In size and shape of skull or culmen no appreciable
difference is noticeable. Both birds can talk, and are quite friendly
when in a cage, but once out in an aviary they only remain docile
when they look for a tit-bit, as soon as their thoughts turn to breeding
they cannot be trusted. They may look quite harmless when hoping
for a peanut or piece of apple, but become very aggressive if anyone

enters the flight. They are also quarrelsome with their psittacine
neighbours as the poor young Kings discovered to their cost.
Last season eleven young Manycolours were reared successfully.
Unfortunately there was only one hen among them, which rather
reversed the balance for the previous year when there were four
superfluous hens. One pair of birds had three broods, which would
not have been permitted if I had been there at the time. The third
brood were reared ready to leave the nest, but the nights turned cold
and the young died ; of course they were both hens.
My pair of Hooded moulted in July, and then thought of going to
nest in October, but as they had laid no eggs I removed them to their
new address. The next morning the hen laid her first egg on the cage
floor. They are again moulting at present (March), so may decide to
try at a more reasonable season this year.
The longer one keeps birds and the more birds one keeps, the more
does one become convinced that it does not do to generalize on a
species through the experiences gained from the behaviour of one
particular pair. It is all really a matter of individuality. For instance,
many Princess of Wales hens persist in breaking their eggs as they are
laid, and some cocks of these birds have to be removed when the hen
is sitting, whilst other pairs behave perfectly as parents and rear brood
after brood without any trouble. Possibly these faults are hereditary,
and as the source of supply is strictly limited in this country, a large
percentage of the young available inherit these bad habits or character-
istics. The fact remains that many hens do break their eggs
deliberately, yet eventually sit on a few and rear a family after laying
as many as twenty or even thirty eggs. Similarly, some cocks insist
on sitting alongside the hen during incubation, in which event better
results are obtained by removing the cock once the first egg appears.
He may be put back once the family is coming along, and will usually
look after the young on leaving the nest, and also fertilize a second
clutch. But it is undoubtedly a question of personal taste, and the
best procedure to adopt with each individual pair can only be decided
from observation and experiment. Such inherent defects as deformed
beaks are in my opinion liable to recur in the progeny of any stock
reared from such defective parents, whether the defect shows in the
specimen itself or is concealed in the same manner as say a split colour
factor in a normal coloured bird.
These notes are becoming like one of my telephone conversations.
Someone asks " Where's father ", the answer is " On the phone to
one of his bird friends This is greeted with a large " Oh ! " with a
world of meaning pushed into that short word. There is always
something more to say when you are discussing birds I find . . .

The Hon. Director of the Severn Wildfowl Trust invites members
of the Society to visit the New Grounds, Slimbridge, Gloucestershire,
on the afternoon of Saturday, 28th April. The party will gather there
at 2 p.m.
It is much the better to travel by road. Slimbridge is 12 miles
from Gloucester and 26 from Bristol. The side-road off the main
Gloucester-Bristol road is half a mile from Cambridge village on the
Bristol side ; and the signpost indicates both the New Grounds and
Slimbridge. Follow the winding country road through the village,
over the canal bridge, and along a very bumpy road, and you will
arrive at the headquarters of the S.W.T.
Rail travel presents some difficulty. Coaley Junction is the nearest
station (3 miles), but it is on the Gloucester-Bristol line, and there
are very few trains. Stroud is the best station for those going from
London, but it is ten miles from the New Grounds, and it is necessary
to take a taxi.
Members intending to accept the invitation must notify the Hon.
Secretary, 61 Chase Road, Oakwood, N. 14, before the 21st April.

V. N. Wall writes on 3rd February, from Erdington : " I would be
interested to know whether the nesting of a Greenfinch hen at this
time of the year is abnormal. The hen started making her nest on the
22 nd of January, and by the 27th had laid her first egg. The nest
now has four eggs, and the hen is sitting very tight. The aviary is
what one might call a semi-enclosed type, 8 feet by 4 feet, the house
section being enclosed on three sides, and the front half enclosed.
The roof of both house and flight is covered, the flight being open to
the most severe weather. The nest is situated among some twigs,
hay, roots, and other bits and pieces thrown in to provide nesting
material, in an exposed position, in the flight."

D. Bowles reports that several interesting breeding results were
obtained at the Edinburgh Zoo during 1950. The Sarus Cranes
hatched two young ones. One was rather a weakling, and was trodden
on soon after hatching ; the survivor was fully reared.
A pair of Black-headed Ibises successfully hatched two youngsters
in July, and went to nest again in October, hatching a further brood.
Unfortunately, the weather was very much against these last two,
and both were found dead, having fallen out of the nest during the
night. Blue and Yellow Macaws laid three eggs, threw two out of
the nest, but successfully hatched the third and reared the young one.
The most important new arrivals were four Red-breasted Geese
received in exchange for Penguins from the Antwerp Zoo, and two

The Southern California Chapter of the Avicultural Society met
at the Sepulvada Woman's Club House, 15236 Parthenia Street,
Sepulvada, on 7th January, 1951. Mr. Brinker mentioned that his
Ring-necks were showing signs of nesting, and that his Red Rosellas
had eggs. Most of the birds were getting ready to nest owing to the
warm winter. Mrs. Hazle Scott, just returned from New York City,
gave an interesting talk about the birds she had seen in the various
zoos. Mr. Francis Abella told how an opossum had got into the
cage with his talking Crow and had almost killed it when he discovered
it. The opossum had bitten the neck of the Crow and had its tail
wrapped round the bird, but he succeeded in getting the opossum
out, and took the Crow to a veterinary, who sewed its neck up, and
it was now recovering, but it was a very close call for Mr. Crow.

Mr. David West, Sen., who is taking care of his son's wonderful
collection of Parrakeets at Montebello, California, since the latter
has joined the Armed Forces, writes :--
" The birds are going along nicely ; we hope this year to raise
the first Many Coloured and the first Adelaides this summer. Also we
should have about eight young Turquoisines to export. I finally learned
how to cure the Australia eye disease. We had one cage contaminated
from a shipment of birds from Salt Lake City, and even though that
portable aluminum aviary had been in use for over a year, raising
perfect Scarlet-chested, the moment a pair of Many Coloured was
put in there, the female had the disease in one week. I took the
male out, segregated the hen, and was going to kill her. But
I went to the drug store, bought 2 per cent solution of yellow oxide of
mercury, plus a tube of the new drug called " aureomyocin ", placed
some in the eye, and the next day the eye was shut. Thereafter twice
a week, I gave it the same, and in two weeks the disease was gone.
Of course, I dare not use the bird for a couple of years. I cabled a
doctor in Australia, who also had found a cure of the liquid type, but
after reading his letters, decided mine was better, for his took a month ;
mine took actually one week.
" I now experiment, and so far have saved a female Queen Alexandra
that had pneumonia by the simple task of placing it in the hospital
tent, giving it cod liver oil each morning, then taking the bird out to
the aviary each day with its mate, regardless of the weather, bringing
the bird back after about five hours. There seems to be some advan-
tage in taking the bird out each day with its mate. If you don't, the
bird seems to give up its will to live ; we have lost many, and it
occurred to me this time to put the bird out each day, if only for
its having a chance at a normal feeding if it wanted to."

Some interesting additions have been made recently in spite of
the continued unfavourable weather (up to 10th March). The
greater number of these have come from India. We were glad to
receive two Yellow-collared Ixulus (/. flavicollis) as they are such
sprightly creatures. They are exhibited alongside the Yuhinas,
which they somewhat resemble in habits and appearance, though the
latter have not such a heavy crest and lack the whitish eye ring of the
Ixulus. This latter feature, coupled with their form and general
behaviour, gives the Ixulus a marked resemblance to the Zosterops
family.
A pair of Hoopoes ( Upupa epops indica) are a joy to watch, for at
the moment of alighting they always raise and lower their crests,
giving them a most comical appearance. This Indian race is almost
identical with the European race. We have them housed with a
European Bee-eater which has been with us since August, 1948.
A notable arrival from the Himalayas was a Yellow-naped Great
Barbet ( Megalaima marshallorum) . This is a magnificent specimen,
equalling in size some of the Aracaris and Toucanets, with which the
Barbets show many affinities.
A Lesser Long-billed (or Brown) Thrush (. pother a marginata) from
India is new to our collection. Its bill is quite remarkable in length
for one of the Turdidae, and terminates in a pronounced hook. This
and the Barbet were presented by Viscount Chaplin.
Another striking Indian bird is a Green-backed Woodpecker
(Brachypternus aurantius) which is a large species with a prominent
red crest. It seems to tame more readily than many others of the
family. Other attractive arrivals from the same country are a Blue-
winged Siva, two Black-headed Sibias, four Lanceolated Jays, one
Tickell's Blue Flycatcher (deposited), and one White-capped Redstart.
We were fortunate to receive a magnificent pair of Cherry Finches
(.Aidemosyne modesta) presented by Mr. H. M. Luther. This is a
beautifully-marked Australian species, and is all too rarely seen these
days. The male, with his red cap, black throat, and exquisitely
barred underparts, is a most attractive creature.
An unusual Tanager from Cuba--Pretre's Tanager ( Spindalis zena
pretrei) --was presented by Viscount Chaplin. The colour pattern
of this bird is very distinct and reminds one, at first glance, of the
colour scheme of the Golden-breasted Bunting ( Emberiza flaviventris ).
This Tanager belongs to a genus peculiar to the West Indies in which
the males are attractively coloured with black, white, and orange,
whereas the females are dull.

two Brazilian Hangnests, six Saffron Finches, two Golden-crowned

Our Black-footed or Cape Penguins (Spheniscus demersus) have reared
three chicks this year. It is strange that this species breeds easily
with us, whereas we have had no luck with the closely related Magellan
Penguins from the Falklands. The latter got as far as breeding a
chick last year, but it died soon after hatching. It may be that the
colder habitat of the Magellan has some bearing on this.
Our old pair of Paradise Sheld-duck are nesting again this year.

PARROTS IN THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN
OF SAN DIEGO
By Ken Stott, Jr.
General Curator , Zoological Park of San Diego , California

During the past twenty-five years no effort has been spared by
officials of the Zoological Garden of San Diego to maintain as varied
and comprehensive a collection of psittacine birds as could be properly
housed and cared for. The popularity of the Parrot family, both with
the general public and with aviculturists, renders most of its repre-
sentatives ideal zoo exhibits. A further reason for the local emphasis
on birds of this group is a generally mild climate, which is conducive
to longevity and breeding. It is possible in southern California to
exhibit nearly all forms of Parrot life out of doors throughout the year.
Since 1922, at which time the zoo first occupied its present location,
one hundred and forty forms of Parrot have entered the collection.
Many of these may be justifiably termed " choice items " here in the
United States, to name a few : Pesquet's Vulture-head, Yellow-
naped Macaw, Rothschild's and Puerto Rican Amazons, Golden-
shouldered Parrakeet, Celebes Racquet-tail, Kuhl's and Cardinal
Lories, Ducorps' Cockatoo, and the Solomon Pigmy Parrot.
The collection now (1st March, 1951) contains sixty-nine species or
subspecies. For such interest as it may afford, a list of the currently
exhibited forms is offered here, as well as one enumerating those species
which have bred in the gardens.

BIRDS OF PARADISE AND BOWER-BIRDS. By Tom Iredale.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998922485714286" page_id="56288157"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
Georgian House, Melbourne, 1950. pp. i-xii, 1-239, 33 coloured
plates. Price #5 5s. net.
Nothing is more welcome to ornithologists and bird amateurs than
a comprehensive monograph of an attractive group of birds, with
complete illustrations in colours. When these are the gorgeous
Birds of Paradise and the interesting Bower Birds, the anticipation is
great. Yet Mr. T. Iredale's book is a cause of deep disappointment
and dissatisfaction.
Order in planning and clarity in writing are first necessities ; they
are conspicuously wanting throughout this book. Peculiarity is
pressed to the point of erraticness, and one can hardly ever find the
information one wants. Unsuccessful attempts at humour such as
heading the chapter on Cicinnurus " The Little King and his friends "
are of doubtful taste in this sort of a work. Furthermore, the author's
queer conception of nomenclature, species relationships, and affinities
results in a number of fantastic and misleading statements which are
likely to give the reader erroneous notions. Particularly Mr. Iredale's
quaint and repeated assumption that a few odd specimens, found
among tens of thousands of others, truly represent rare but distinct
forms rather than hybrids, seems hard to believe. Anyone moderately
acquainted with Birds of Paradise can easily detect in any of these
unusual birds the combined characteristics of two well-known species.
It is also generally known that hybrids are not infrequent in families
in which profusely ornate males do not usually pair up, but remain
promiscuous, accepting any female which is attracted to their display
perch or ground. This happens among the Birds of Paradise, as it
does in Humming Birds.
The most commendable feature of the work is a good historical
account of the various species ; but Mr. Iredale's unexpected idea of
a bibliography is a chatty appreciation of a number of authors and
collectors, with which few will agree in a number of cases. There
are no original accounts of life habits, and the author's knowledge of
the birds is based mostly on the study of museum collections and on
his own selection of the literature. He does not appear to have ever
observed them in their native haunts, nor to have watched them in

captivity to any extent. The book is well produced, and practically
all the species and subspecies are figured in colours. It is, however,
regrettable that so many of the pictures reproduce faithfully the defects
of faultily mounted skins, giving only a remote idea of the bird in life.
Pictures of all the known hybrids are certainly useful.
It is to be deplored that such a book has ever been printed. It will
probably deter for some time to come the publication of a more
satisfactory one, from the pen of a naturalist understanding thoroughly
these magnificent and entrancing birds, and well acquainted with their
fascinating behaviour.

Arthur A. Prestwich. London, 1950.
This excellent volume, as the title implies written in French, will
be of great value to aviculturists. Mr. Prestwich has made long and
extensive research into the most important French periodicals in
order to obtain as much information as possible regarding the breeding
of Parrots and Parrakeets in captivity. He adds that the work is
a compilation of the records of rearing of Psitticine birds which have
appeared in the Bulletin de la Societe Rationale d'Acclimatation de France ,
La Terre et la Vie, and VOiseau et la Revue Frangaise d'Ornithologie, and
that there may be other records which have not been included.
He states that he will welcome any information regarding any records,
and recommends that such information should be sent to VOiseau for
publication.
The volume is methodically and clearly presented, and is yet another
example of the careful and useful work being carried out by the Hon.
Secretary of the Avicultural Society.

In simple, entertaining style, Professor Miller recounts happy
boyhood days and equally happy manhood days spent in search and
study of birds and bird fossils. In California, Arizona, and Lower
California he roughed it with other nature lovers, and the accounts
of his experiences with the people he found there as well as with the

Dr. Miller was both fortunate and wise to discover early in his youth

Choughs in Kent and Sussex.
There have been reports lately of Red-billed Choughs being seen in various parts
of Sussex and Kent and in The Times of 28th December last appeared a note headed
" Chough Mystery Solved " in which the writer stated : " There is, it appears, a
gentleman living in Sussex who keeps Choughs in semi-captivity and had eighteen
home-bred specimens, almost full winged, in his grounds during the summer. Three
of them escaped, and it is these three birds, undoubtedly, that have been the cause
of all the excitement. 3 ' The term " home-bred " would seem to indicate that these
birds were bred in captivity, so I sent the cutting to Mr. Prestwich, who, I knew, kept
all the records of birds bred in captivity. But he had no definite records of breeding
successes in Great Britain. He quoted the late Dr. W. T. Greene in saying in British
Birds for Cages and Aviaries that, " if suitable accommodation is provided they will
breed freely and successfully ", Dr. Greene was rather fond of making statements
like this which might have been true, but no one had ever succeeded in providing
" suitable accommodation ".
I made inquiries and discovered that the birds had wandered from Pippingford
Park, so wrote to the owner, Mr. Hayley Morriss, who has kindly supplied me with
the following information. The Choughs came as young birds from Ireland, and
were liberated at Pippingford Park. He writes : "At present I have sixteen birds
which roost on nesting boxes in a large room. I feed them every day by hand.
During the war some of my Choughs nested, but soldiers always took the eggs.
Jackdaws are their principal enemies. When the Choughs wander too far, unfortu-
nately, gallant sportsmen walk out and shoot them. Some people think this a great
triumph as the birds are rare. They even shoot my Cranes."
Let us hope that some of these delightful birds may find " suitable accommodation 3 3
and succeed in rearing families, and that " gallant sportsmen 33 and Jackdaws will
make themselves scarce.
I believe Jackdaws are mainly responsible for the scarcity of Choughs in Cornwall
and other parts of the western coasts, though the egg collecting fiends may have had
something to do with it. These birds are in vast numbers on all these rocky coasts,
and occupy every nook with their nests, leaving no room for the Choughs.
David Seth-Smith.
Longevity of Amazon Parrots.
In regard to the longevity of Amazon Parrots, I have a Lutino Blue-fronted which
I obtained about 1929, when she was already obviously an old bird who had been
a long time in captivity. She is now quite blind and never finishes moulting her
feathers completely, but seems healthy and happy in other respects and does not
mind the cold. ,

Feeding of Humming Birds and Manarins.
In response to queries regarding the best food for Humming Birds and Manakins,
Mr. Lee Crandall writes : " I do not know of any striking change in the formula
used for Humming Birds in recent years. Our basic food consists of one teaspoonful
each of condensed milk (Nestle's), Mellin's Food and honey to four ounces of water.
To this we add Zymadrops (a vitamin concentrate), as well as a very little beef con-
centrate. The formula is varied from time to time, of course, according to the condi
tion of the birds. The mixture is removed in late afternoon and replaced with honey
water, to avoid the risk of souring.

For Manakins the staple diet is the usual Mockingbird food, with egg and carrot,
thoroughly mixed with mashed banana, given in the morning. Later in the day,
diced bananas and grapes are added. Even the most delicate kinds will thrive on
this food. They will not take mealworms, but all will go to no end of trouble to
extract liquid food from a Humming Bird or Sun Bird feeder, if one is available.
We try to keep this at a minimum because too much quickly produces excess fat. With
birds below par, a limited quantity is no doubt beneficial.
A Collection of Water Fowl in Canada.
I do not keep many ducks, but the following is a list of the species in my collection.
Canada, White Cheeked, Cackling, Barnacle, Grey Lag, Pink Foot, White Front, Blue,
Snow, Barhead, Egyptian, Blue-Winged Abyssinian, Magellan, Mute Swans, Mandarin,
Pintail, Wood Duck.
My breeding season has not been particularly successful, but I have reared Canada,
Barheads, Blue and Egyptian Geese this year. Some other species were starting to
breed, when we had fox trouble, which disturbed them and prevented some birds
from laying, in addition to those that were lost.
You might be interested in knowing that Colonel Niall Rankin who was in Alaska
last spring sent me thirty-nine goose eggs from Alaska, including Cackling, White
Front, Emperor, and Black Brant. Apparently it is not practical to ship goose eggs
long distances by air, as out of the thirty-nine eggs, I hatched and reared only two,
one very lovely Emperor and one Cackling. These two birds are being shipped to
Colonel Rankin and he will no doubt be giving the society a complete story on his trip
and results.
Owing to Canadian regulations, it is not now possible for us to bring birds in from
England or Europe, or from the United States, so that collections in Canada will
remain fairly static as far as any new varieties are concerned until these regulations
change.
I have one breeding pair of Grey Lag Geese, the gander of which is at least twenty-
five years old, and probably older. They laid four eggs, but were disturbed during
hatching, so were gathered and set under a hen. One chick hatched, but unfortunately
was accidentally lost. It will be interesting to see whether this old gander will again
be able to survive the winter, and contribute fertility to the eggs next year. He seems
to be in good shape, but is somewhat stiff in the joints. This bird was acquired from
an importer in New York in 1928, was mature at the time, and was in my collection
for approximately twelve years before the pair decided to lay. Since then they have
laid every year, although the female was killed some years ago and he is now mated
to his second mate. I have young birds from the usual species of common pheasants
such as Golden, Lady Amherst, Reeves, and Silver, and also from Swinhoe and
Impeyan. I am particularly pleased with the young Impeyan Pheasants, having five
well developed youngsters out of a hatch of six.
Three species of Peafowl, Blue, Black Shouldered, and White, have produced
rather well, with somewhat over one hundred chicks.
We have had a cool wet summer, not particularly helpful for rearing Pheasants,
and the weather is still unsettled. Most collections in this area have had an average
season however.

The Indian Ringneck Parrakeet in China.
Breeders and fanciers of Parrakeets may be interested to know that the common
Indian Ringneck also exists in China. When I was last in Hong Kong in 1937 I saw
two Parrakeets flying high over the Hong Kong Public Garden. I thought these
were some single escaped or released birds, but from an article in the Hong Kong
Naturalist, by Mr. Herklots, I have learned now that a strong colony of this Parrot
exists in Hong Kong and that the species also occurs in Macao. Evidently this
colony has been founded by some escaped or released birds. Mr. Herklots states
that prior to 1931 there were probably less than a dozen birds, but that they had
increased considerably after 1931, for he counted two flocks of eleven and fifteen
birds and two more flocks of fifteen and eighteen birds were observed in the compound
of the Hong Kong University. Their headquarters seem to be the grounds of the
Flagstaff House, where they possibly breed.

THE NEED TO SUPPLY PARROT-LIKE BIRDS WITH GREEN TWIGS
AND BRANCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969758846153846" page_id="56288161"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
The longer I keep Parrot-like birds of nearly all species, the more convinced I am
that aviculturists and zoos make a great mistake in not keeping these birds regularly
supplied, in cage and aviary, with the green twigs or branches of non-poisonous,
deciduous trees, renewed as regularly as food and water, though not, of course,
necessarily with the same frequency. Parrot-like birds at liberty spend a great part
of their time nibbling and eating the bark and buds of trees, and deprivation of this
natural exercise is, I am sure, a great hardship to them, not only injuring their health,
but leading to the development of various tiresome vices, the direct or indirect result
of idleness.

BREEDING RESULTS AT WOBURN IN 1950

Losses among Red-breasted Goslings at Woburn, though heavier than usual, were
not quite as bad as M. Delacour states in his Notes. We reared 12 out of 19 hatched ;
not 70.
I did not myself breed Pileated Parrakeets, although Mr. Boosey was successful
with a pair of birds he was keeping for me, three of whose young are now in my
collection.
Budgerigars bred and trained to " home " can be left at controlled liberty through-
out the winter, although it is true that a high percentage of unselected birds not bred
from a homing strain will go away in autumn. I now have about 27 reliable homers.

" THE AMALGAMATION "--A SUGGESTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986131875" page_id="56288161"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
As a very old member of our Society, I wish to congratulate our Council on this
wise move ; for one thing, we will get information as to how Aviculture is carried
on in a free country , such as it was here in my earlier days before we were socialized,
form-ridden with every other evil that can be devised to break the spirit of a once
great nation. I for one welcome anything avicultural or otherwise, that will tend
to awaken again the good old spirit of independence which of late years has been
hopelessly lost, the first nail in our coffin being supplied by the ramp over Parrot
disease, which I don't suppose killed one person for all the deaths caused by 'flu this
winter.
Now for my suggestion ; I see by Mr. Delacour's article that the Avicultural
Society of America intends to publish a " Year Book ". I think this should be made
available to our members, as I am sure it would be full of valuable information,
as year books generally are. I may say that I was a member of the American Society
when it started, and for many years afterwards when they used to borrow our coloured
plates. The articles published by our friends across the Atlantic were so refreshing,
especially the visits to various aviaries, not leaving out the sumptuous teas with

BIRD SHOWS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991609583333333" page_id="56288162"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
I see that Mr. Goodwin has returned to the charge against bird shows. Whether
they attract or repel persons who visit them is a matter of opinion. I prefer that of
the editor of Cage Birds, whose experience must be unrivalled. He has stated that
bird shows are the principal recruiting ground for our hobby, and such knowledge
as I have goes to confirm his view.
One can agree, however, that the exhibition of a Swallow in a small cage at the
National Show was regrettable ; it certainly didn't look happy. Nevertheless, the
Swallow tribe make particularly charming pets, and if hand-reared they are perfectly
happy in a modified captivity.
I had two Sand Martins which I could handle like kittens, and they so little resented
captivity (in a large aviary) that I could release them without fear. They flew up
into the sky and joined the wild House Martins till I held out my hand, when they
at once swooped down to me. I had, of course, trained them to do this in their
aviary. It is possible that they would be content in a cage if released two or three
times a day in a large room. Bird watchers, who achieve such marvels as taking of a
census of different species, could perhaps ascertain what proportion of the day
Swallows spend in the air as compared with the hours of sitting and watching the
world go by. One would also need to discover how far their flights are for pleasure
and how far they are merely a necessary effort to obtain food. At the National Show
there was a large aviary containing Pheasants, the aviary being put there by the
maker as an advertisement. If such a structure could be used for exhibiting a few
Swallows they would be a great attraction. They are very affectionate and show a
flattering appreciation of our company.

(Creatophora carunculata)
By G. S. Webb (Zoological Society of London)
The excellent accompanying plate illustrates the seasonal change
in the male Wattled Starling. The pictures are of the same bird--
a specimen in the London Zoo--showing the breeding head-dress (on
the left) and the normal, or eclipse, head-dress (on the right). Each
phase lasts about six months--the latter corresponding, more or less,
with our winter. This type of seasonal change appears to be 1 unique
in the bird-world. The male in non-breeding head-dress closely
resembles his mate, but as the breeding season approaches, his head
gradually goes bare and is then adorned by bare yellow skin. At the
same time the dormant chin- and head-wattles commence to grow
until the remarkable change (as illustrated) is complete. In the
reverse season first the bare skin loses its bright colour then the wattles
slowly shrink and finally disappear while the head again becomes
fully feathered. In sketches that have been made from the skins, the
wattles on the crown and forehead are usually depicted as being held
erect, whereas these appendages in life are limp like the chin wattle.
In museum collections the breeding phase has always been rare, and
it was thought formerly that such specimens were very old males or
that the development was permanent. We have to thank aviculture
for bringing to light the true facts, the complete change being first
witnessed in a male captive bird in America. An account of this was
published in the Auk 1928. Since then the phenomenon has been
witnessed by others who have studied captive birds.
Mr. Lee Crandall, of the New York Zoological Park, has given
a detailed account in #oologica (1949) of this seasonal change in some
specimens under his care. His observations extended from 1927 to
1943 and he witnessed the same seasonal change as observed more
recently in the London Zoo. One of his specimens (probably a young
bird) did not undergo the full change until the third year, but
1 It seems that the Wattled Sunbird (Neodrepanis coruscans ) of Madagascar may
undergo a modified seasonal change of this type, developing small wattles and bare
skin on the sides of the face which are fully feathered in the reverse season.

meanwhile assumed a partial seasonal change which was annually
more pronounced. This would seem to indicate that males do not
become fully wattled and bare-headed in the breeding season until
they are several years old. It is not known definitely if young males
breed before assuming the full nuptial head-dress but it seems more
than likely.
The writer brought home a few specimens for the London Zoo
from Kenya in 1946, and ever since the male has gone regularly
through his seasonal change--coming into breeding dress in the
spring and changing back again in early winter.
One might ask how this unique change remained a mystery for so
long and why fully wattled specimens are so rare in museum
collections. A knowledge of the bird's habits throws considerable light
on the subject. In the dry season Wattled Starlings congregate in
large flocks and often visit farmyards, poultry runs, garbage heaps,
slaughterhouses, etc., eating scraps of food of all kinds as well as
insects. In Kenya, at Nanyuki, the writer witnessed large numbers
of these birds feeding daily in cattle troughs near a farmhouse. There
was not a single wattled specimen among them, though many males
could be distinguished by a black line under the chin denoting a
wattle about to sprout (or one not fully atrophied). The dry season
was nearly at an end. While I was there the rains broke and the
Wattled Starlings that had been so prominent for months all
disappeared as if by magic. It seems that they breed in remote
places far from human habitations, usually in semi-arid country where
locusts breed. At such times they are rarely obtained by collectors
or observed by ornithologists for the simple reason that they are in
such outlandish districts, difficult of access.
Even allowing for a number of immature males there must be a
large percentage of fully wattled specimens in the breeding season, as
Wattled Starlings, like most, if not all, of the Starling tribe are long-
lived birds. (Some of our tropical Starlings in the London Zoo are
over twenty years old.)
A certain amount of mystery surrounds the nesting habits of Wattled
Starlings. In South-West Africa they have been found nesting in
thousands, with each thorn-bush packed with nests, and all in a
restricted area where locusts were hatching. As the latter cover the
ground in millions and provide excellent food for young birds it seems
possible that the association is by design and not mere coincidence,
especially as similar independent observations have been made
elsewhere. If this habit is an established one, one might ask what
happens when the swarm locusts fail to materialize, for they are very
spasmodic in their appearance.
Do Wattled Starlings then change their habits and breed like other
Starlings of the semi-arid zone, such as the Superb and Royal Starlings,

or do they migrate considerable distances to districts where swarm
locusts are hatching ? With the drier parts of Africa remaining
uninhabited by Europeans, it is difficult to get sufficient evidence to
draw any definite conclusions on this subject.
When the locust hoppers reach the flying stage the swarm is followed
by flocks of Wattled Starlings, and as the locusts are attracted by
greenery in the way of growing crops on farms, it is then that the
Starlings are much in evidence, and is why they are known in many
localities as " locust-birds ". It has been recorded that breeding
colonies of Wattled Starlings sometimes suffer disaster through the
locust swarm, on which they are dependent, taking flight before the
young birds are reared. In spite of all efforts by the parents, masses
of young birds then perish through starvation.
It seems that locust-control measures, now in force in most parts of
Africa where there is European settlement, have greatly affected the
distribution of the Wattled Starling. Formerly, it was plentiful over
large areas (such as Rhodesia), where it is now seldom seen.
Although the Wattled Starling has a wide distribution--Aden, and
from Abyssinia through East Africa to the Gape--it is not really a
well-known bird. Over large tracts of country it is scarce or absent.
Dry regions are its favourite abode, and so it is most numerous in
South-West Africa and Northern Kenya, though strangely enough, it
has not spread westwards through the vast semi-arid zone immediately
south of the Sahara.
Since writing the above I have received a letter from Mr. Raymond
Hook, of Nanyuki, Kenya Colony, on whose farm I collected my
Wattled Starlings. It seems to me so interesting that I quote it almost
in full :--
" There are two quite distinct methods of breeding. In the ordinary
way they live in flocks of thirty, or so, individuals in the open savannah
country of Eastern Africa, spending their time searching the country
for insect food, frequently in association with grazing animals, both
wild and domestic, walking near them to capture insects disturbed.
The nests are built in thorn trees, 12 to 20 feet from the ground, and
are constructed of coarse twigs and lined with grass, two or three
nests being built as one edifice, with perhaps two or three of these
composite nests in a tree. The clutch is usually three and the eggs
of the same size and of rather a paler colour than European Starlings'
eggs. The usual assemblage of nests will be perhaps fifty, or rather
over 100 pairs of birds and all within quite a small area.
" Africa has always been a home for locusts, and two species visit
Kenya. The Desert Locust breeds in the arid areas round the Red Sea
and comes southward at intervals of six to ten years. It comes in
comparatively small swarms and does not do a great deal of damage.
But during the nineteen-twenties the far more formidable migratory

locust, which travels in far larger swarms, began to breed up to
swarming numbers in the swamp of the Niger and then launched an
invasion, which was to travel for some years, first eastward to Kenya
and then southward to cover a large portion of Africa south of the
equator, advancing on a broad front and travelling about 600 miles
per year. In 1928 these locusts laid all over my farm, which is near
the junction of the Nanyuki and Uaso Nyiro rivers, north-westward
from Mount Kenya. When locusts are ready to lay they turn a canary
yellow colour and may be seen in couples, and the female digs a hole
about \ in. in diameter and 3 inches deep in which she lays about
sixty eggs. After the lapse of an uncertain interval, but usually at
the commencement of the next spell of rainy weather, the eggs hatch
out as tiny wingless locusts, milk white as they emerge but rapidly
turning black. These accumulate on bushes and any shelter and soon
start on their life's journey of destruction, all moving in the same
direction under a well organized flock discipline, and devouring all
edible vegetation in their path. I estimate that this particular swarm
laid over an area of 40,000 acres with at least one packet of eggs in
every square yard.
" It was at this stage that the Wattled Starlings appeared in their
dynamic role. They had constructed a city of thousands and thousands
of their usual type of nest, covering an area of several acres of fairly
dense thorn scrub. Unfortunately, it is in a portion of my farm which
I seldom visit and I did not take note of the earlier developments and
cannot say exactly what was the order of events, of the locusts'
emerging and the Starlings hatching, but the synchronization struck
me as a marvel of nature. When I visited the site it was a scene of
intense animation, companies of the Starlings, a hundred or so, were
constantly departing and other parties arriving ; if I remember
correctly the locust hoppers were visible in their beaks, and no other
food appeared to be brought, and this activity took place without
ceasing during all the hours of daylight. A party of about fifteen
Eagles (by their colour almost certainly Tawny Eagles) was in
attendance, and my native boys said that they lived entirely on the
young Starlings, and this seemed probable as I saw them on several
occasions. The locust infested area was cleared completely within
six weeks or so, after which an immense concourse of young Starlings
dispersed, and I did not see them again. The migratory locusts were
more lucky with layings in other areas, the resulting swarm departing
in a south-easterly direction. I have never seen locusts lay again."
Mr. Raymond Hook's remarks refer to an observation made in 1928.

D. H. S. RISDON-THE BIRD COLLECTION AT DUDLEY ZOO 83
THE BIRD COLLECTION AT DUDLEY ZOO
By D. H. S. Risdon (Dudley, England)
As members have been invited to visit Dudley Zoo this year, the
time seems appropriate to give a description of the bird collection
here. I am afraid it will be no more than a description, as breeding
results are at present negligible due to lack of suitable facilities. It is
hoped to remedy this state of affairs one day, but it has to be
remembered that we are first and foremost a show place. This means
that our cages and aviaries are designed to display a collection of
birds rather than as suitable breeding quarters, for an aviary containing
only a breeding pair of birds can at times look empty. Moreover,
having to be kept scrupulously clean at all times necessitates too much
interference for good nesting results. One might say equally that the
birds get too much interference from the public, but this I doubt.
It is surprising how quickly birds become accustomed to crowds even
when they bang on the wire netting, and all last summer I noticed
them going about their affairs completely indifferent to the people
outside. They seem to realize that the wire forms a barrier because
they instantly show signs of alarm when one enters an aviary. This
indifference to one's presence outside the enclosures has the great
advantage of allowing one to study them in comfort without having
to go through the what I call " field tactics " one normally has to in
order to view birds which are only accustomed to seeing their owner.
Our large birds--Ostriches, Emus, Cranes, etc., are quartered in
the usual type of paddock ; the Waterfowl in a series of concrete
ponds built in the old Castle Moat, and the smaller birds mainly in
the Bird House proper and six blocks of outdoor aviaries.
The Bird House is an elaborately designed structure, well lighted
and well heated, but I must confess that I would rather see 90 per cent
of the occupants housed out of doors. It contains the bulk of our
Parrot collection, and I need not tell readers how necessary outdoor
conditions are for these birds. Since my arrival at Dudley I have
improved the size of the cages, chiefly by knocking two into one, and
I hope eventually to build up a collection of Softbills and Finches in
here so that we can house most of our Parrots outside.
To get to the birds themselves, let us start with the largest and
work our way downwards.
We imported a pair of Ostriches late last summer and for a time they
did well. The hen succumbed to some obscure disease, which was
never accurately diagnosed, soon after the onset of cold weather, and
after a while the cock looked like going the same way, but I was
determined not to give up without a struggle. Veterinary advice was
called in, and between us that bird was injected with so many drugs
and given so many pills that it must have been a veritable medicine

chest. For many weeks it refused to eat and had to be forcibly fed
twice daily, a performance not without danger to the feeder, but
thanks to the care and perseverance of Mr. Hatch, our head keeper,
it is now actually on the mend and I have quite sanguine hopes of
its survival. Accustomed as I have been to the dosing of small birds
with a medicine dropper, the sight of medicine by the half bottle
being poured down that long thin gullet was, to say the least, an
impressive spectacle. Remembering the Guinness advertisement, I half
expected the bottle to disappear as well !
The Society possesses four cock Emus, one of which is at present on
loan to the London Zoo for breeding purposes. They have all been
at Dudley a long time, and all agree well together. At this time of
year (March) they do a certain amount of showing off to one another,
sticking out their chests rather like Fantail Pigeons, and strutting about
uttering a curious booming sound. Emus are difficult birds to sex,
but there seems little doubt about our four birds being males as they
have never produced an egg between them. I think the best description
of an Emu I have heard came from a lady on seeing them for the first
time, who said they reminded her of walking haystacks.
Cranes are represented by the East African Crowned and the
Demoiselle, both lovely species. They live in a large grass paddock,
which they share with Axis Deer, Wallabies, Peafowl, a Secretary
Bird, and Wild Turkeys. They are unpinioned, which means that
their wings have to be clipped every year, and just about the time
this operation is due they have usually grown sufficient flight feathers
to become airborne if a high wind is blowing and have to be retrieved
from various parts of the town. Our Cranes, like our Waterfowl,
have to be shut in at night because of foxes. Strange as it may seem
for a place in the heart of the Black Country, we are overrun with
foxes. We trap and poison them when we can, but that they are still
with us is only too evident if a Duck is inadvertently left out at night.
American Wild Turkeys share the Cranes' enclosure, and beyond
the fact that they resemble a somewhat slimmer edition of the farm-
yard " gobbler ", call for little comment here. I hope eventually to
establish these loose about the grounds but so far foxes have thwarted
my efforts. Last year we had four with clipped wings which had to
be driven in at night, but in the late summer as they grew their new
flights I gave instructions to allow them to roost out in the trees.
This they started to do but it did not prevent the foxes getting two of
them. Why, it is difficult to say, because our Peafowl all roost out
without trouble. These, of which we have some half a dozen of the
common species, are a lovely sight in the spring. Last year they took
up their " stands " on the lawns in front of the restaurant and made
a glorious display. They are not too popular with the garden staff
but their beauty more than compensates for the few plants they

destroy. They seem to think that flower beds freshly planted with
seedlings are put there for their special use as dust baths, with
disastrous results--to the seedlings ! Our one and only hen hatched
three chicks last year, and has unaided successfully reared two of them.
They still walk round with her, although almost as big as their mother.
Our Waterfowl collection is varied and quite representative. As
mentioned above, they are accommodated in what was the old
Castle Moat. Unfortunately, breeding results are nil, because they
have all to be driven in at night to protect them from the fox menace.
I have plans eventually to fox-proof their enclosures, when we ought
to do rather well with them.
The collection includes such nice things as Flamingoes, Black
Swans, and Red-breasted Geese, in addition to all the well-known
favourites like Mandarins, Carolinas, Red-crested Pochards, Rosy-
bills, Snow and Ashy-headed Geese, and so on.
Fish-eaters include a pair of Herring Gulls and a solitary Pelican
which we hope to add to this year. They share the same pond as
a pair of Common Herons, which lately have been carrying twigs
about. I feel sure that had we suitable aviary accommodation where
they could be allowed full-winged they would breed.
Penguins are represented by the Cape or Black-footed species. They
are in a specially constructed pool which allows spectators to view
them feeding under water, but so far they will only take food from the
hand and the remainder of the time sit about looking like a couple
of stuffed dummies. I have tried throwing live roach into the water
but they take no more than a passing interest. Their colloquial name
of Jackass Penguin is particularly apt ; their voice being a perfect
imitation of the braying of a donkey.
Birds of prey are represented by a pair of Griffon Vultures, which
have been here since the Zoo opened in 1937. Last year they partially
built a nest but no eggs appeared as far as could be ascertained.
Until recently they shared their cage with a pair of Ravens but for
safety reasons I had these moved upon the arrival of a Golden Eagle,
which now lives quite amicably with the Vultures. Judging by its
rather small size and dark colouring I should say this is a young
cock bird.
The remainder of our birds of prey are housed in a range of rather
small aviaries. One of these, a Bateleur Eagle, I tried to introduce
into the big Vulture cage with the Golden Eagle, but although his
companions ignored him, the Bateleur, like so many birds which have
become used to a confined space, seemed miserable and lost, so we
moved him back to his old aviary where he is obviously much happier.
Next to him is a Brazilian Caracara, which has also been at the Zoo
since it opened.

86 D. H. S. RISDON-THE BIRD COLLECTION AT DUDLEY ZOO
Chief among the Owls are a magnificent pair of European Eagle-
Owls, which never fail to fascinate me as they puff out their feathers
and crack their beaks at one's approach, staring malevolently at one
with their great amber eyes. Almost equal to them in size is a Cape
Eagle-Owl, which shares an aviary with a Milky Eagle-Owl. All these
big Owls have the habit when alarmed of partly opening their wings
and puffing up their plumage, which not only doubles their size but
seems to transform them from a bird into some great cat, crouching
to spring. We also have Tawny Owls and Little Owls, but the former,
although hand-reared, being strictly nocturnal, are only seen at their
best at dusk, flitting about in the gloom. The Little Owls share an
aviary with a Kestrel.
The last bird of prey worthy of mention is a Secretary Bird. Until
recently we had a pair, imported last summer, but what I think was
the hen accidentally broke its leg and had to be destroyed. The
survivor lives in the large paddock with the Cranes, Deer, and Peafowl
where it stalks about in what I can only describe as an anxious manner
like a tall thin man looking for a lost sixpence.
Our Pheasants are housed in aviaries which one day I hope to have
greatly extended. Apart from the usual Goldens, Amhersts, Silvers,
Reeves, and so on, the rarest example is a hen Blue Crossoptilon,
which at the moment shares a pen with a cock Silver. As she laid
eggs last year when on her own I am wondering whether she will
produce hybrids with the Silver cock this year. Although our
Pheasant aviaries are by no means suitable breeding enclosures, last
season a Golden hen hatched and successfully reared six fine chicks--
a remarkable feat, when one considers that the aviary is of the fixed
type with only a gravel floor, and was shared by some Pigeons and
two other Golden hens, as well as two cocks. An equally remarkable
fact was that the two adult Golden cocks agreed perfectly. In fact,
they were only removed when the chicks hatched, and even to-day
still agree together. If another cock is introduced there is a row
immediately, but these two are perfect pals.
Coming now to the Bird House, which contains the birds of more
general interest to the amateur aviculturist, the Parrot family is well
represented. Most of the better known Cockatoos are there as well
as Macaws, Amazons, and African Greys. These are nearly all ex-pets
and talk more or less fluently. One Lemon-crested Cockatoo asks
" Have you got a copper " in a voice plaintive enough to melt the
meanest heart. These it piles up in the back of its cage, and at one
time it is alleged that the Bird House staff used to collect sufficient
on cleaning out the cage to buy their morning cups of tea. A Hill
Mynah, in an adjacent cage, which also talks quite well, has learnt
the same expression and repeats it--not in a human voice as these
birds can--but in a Cockatoo's voice--if readers can understand my

meaning. Notable among the Parrots are a couple of the Pionus
family called Cobalt Parrots, but which I personally feel are the same
as the Red-vented (.Pionus menstruus). At least, their description fits
that in Tavistock's Parrots and Parrot-like birds in Aviculture. These are
worth mentioning as I don't think there are many Pionus Parrots in
this country to-day. Unfortunately, both birds are showing signs of
old age.
Among the Cockatoos is a very nice little cock Gofhn's. I believe
Mrs. Clark, of Bromsgrove, borrowed him for breeding purposes a
year or two ago, but he refused to pair with the hen she had. He is
extremely savage with all and sundry.
We have all the commoner Parrakeets, but I will not bore readers
with lists of names.
A large cage in this house contains three Hartlaub's Touracous,
a handsome species, I believe new to aviculture in this country. They
are dark green with dark blue wings and tail and black crests. The
flight feathers are carmine, the beak is orange, and there are the
typical white markings on the face. Last year we had what I hoped
were an adult pair, and as they were on their own I made them a
basket-shaped nest in a clump of twigs which I fastened up in the cage.
They showed interest in this on and off throughout the summer, and
then in September one died suddenly. Much to my disappointment,
the post mortem report revealed the cause of death as an impacted
egg in the oviduct !
Touracous, to my way of thinking, are the almost ideal bird from an
avicultural point of view. Graceful in shape, beautifully coloured,
quaint and amusing in their ways ; they seem hardy and easy to
feed, and, in fact, have everything to recommend them.
Another pair of birds equally full of character, which I purchased
last year, are the Grey-backed Trumpeters. From the beginning they
were hand-tame as I believe these birds almost invariably are. They
seem to delight in attention and will run up to one to have their
heads and backs stroked. They are said to be good stayers at liberty,
and I can quite believe it as they delight in human company.
Again, for fear of boring readers, I will not attempt to list all our
small passerine birds and Doves. We have a fine collection of
Whydahs, including Jackson's Golden-backed and Giant ; Weavers,
Finches, and Waxbills.
The large centre cage in the Bird House is planted with tropical
plants and has a fountain playing in the middle of the rockery. In
here we have Green Glossy and Spreo Starlings and a most lovely
hand-tame Sun Bittern, which displays to its lady keeper.
Last, but by no means least, in the Bird House I come to our
Red-billed Toucan, which is a particularly fine specimen. Like
Touracous, Toucans are favourites of mine and for exactly the same

reasons, although some may disagree with me and call them
ungainly.
Worthy of special mention among the Doves and Pigeons are Olive
Pigeons from East Africa. Rare in this country, and new to aviculture,
they are not particularly spectacular. Why they are called Olive
Pigeons I simply cannot imagine, as there is no olive in their make-up,
their colour being what I would call a leaden purple spotted with
white, with yellow beaks and feet. They are the same size as a Wood
Pigeon.
We have two hen Bronze-winged Pigeons which I know to be hens,
because they have both laid, so if anyone who reads this has a cock
to spare I should be pleased to hear from him.
To conclude this account of the Dudley collection I will mention
the East African Helmeted Guinea Fowl, four specimens of which
occupy one of the outdoor aviaries. They are almost identical in
appearance to the domesticated variety.
I have not attempted to mention every species in the collection,
for reasons already stated, but I hope some idea has been given of its
size and scope. At last year's stocktaking we had some 421 birds in
133 species. Needless to say, we are continually adding fresh examples,
especially now that more birds are on the market, and in time I hope
to be able to report more breeding successes.

The bird bazaars of Calcutta, India, are concentrated in the S.S.
Hogg Market, a municipal market known as New Market. The huge
structure was erected in 1874 and occupies some ten city blocks.
Within its domain one can purchase a varied assortment of merchan-
dise, and it is often said that the prospective buyer can secure any
article from a pin to an elephant. This I can verify, for I have purchased
pins and have viewed live elephants that were being offered for sale
among the turmoil and odours of the market.
It has been my privilege to visit the bird bazaars for a period of
five months, from the months of May to September ; in fact my
visits are daily observations of the specimens that are offered for sale.
Therefore the following list and comments on the birds offered for
sale may be of interest to aviculturists.
In the following list the birds are grouped under their respective

I arrived in May, and during my stay in Calcutta the bird has moulted
into a grey coloured specimen.

Family Ploceid^e
The Weaver birds are popular cage-birds. For they adapt them-
selves to cage life, are easy to feed, and present a pleasing appearance.
The Baya Weaver-bird (Ploceus philippinus ), the Striated Weaver-
bird (Ploceus manyar ), the White-throated Munia (Uroloncha mala -
barica ), the Spotted Munia (Uroloncha punctulata ), and the Red Avadavat
or Strawberry Finch (.Amandava amandava) are the commoner Weavers
seen in the bazaars. However, at times other species are offered,
such as the Green Munia or Tiger Finch (Sticospiza formosa), the
Chestnut-bellied Munia (Munia atricapilla ), and the Black-headed
Munia {Munia malacca ).
The birds of this group are victims of the paint bucket. The birds
are submerged in buckets containing coloured paints, and emerge
as a synthetic exotic species. This is a common practice among the
dealers, as many of the European bird fanciers desire " painted "
birds.

The Family Psittacid^e is represented by four species and when
they arrive in large bamboo baskets their heads are enclosed in a hood.
This method prevents the birds from seeing their companions, hereby
preventing severe lacerations inflicted by their hooked beaks. The
species are the Large Indian Paroquet ( Psittacula eupatria), the Green
Paroquet ( Psittacula krameri ), the ornate Blossom-headed Paroquet
(.Psittacula cyanocephala) , and the small Indian Lorikeet ( Coryllis vernalis )
or sometimes known as the Hanging Paroquet, for during sleep
this bird hangs head downward, in much the same manner as the bat.
These species of the Psittacidae are numerous in all the bird bazaars
of Calcutta.
Of the Strighle I have seen only one species, the Rock Eagle-Owl
(Bubo bengalensis) , and the bird appeared very unhappy for it was
in a cage much too small for this large bird.
The Vultures have appeared several times within the period, and
their presence always affords me much pleasure. To most people
they are repulsive, and to me they are fascinating birds. The family
Gypid^e is represented by the King Vulture (Sarcogyps calvus ) and the
White-backed Vulture (. Pseudogyps bengalensis). These birds were
sold to zoos upon the Continent.
The Common Pariah Kite ( Milvus migrans ) of the family Falconid^e
has appeared only once, and I believe the bird was caught within the
bazaar, for this Accipitre darts through the structure in search of
food.

By R. B. Brown (Newcastle, N.S.W. Australia)
On 12th November, 1949, I was walking through a " Brush 55 (rain
forest) some miles from here, accompanied by a friend, when we saw
a hen Regent Bower Bird building her nest in a yellow blossomed
Paper Bark tree ( Melaleuca ), growing alongside a creek.
The nest was nearly at the top of the tree, about 35 feet from the
ground. This was an unusual site, as they generally nest in very tall
creeper covered trees. The bird had reached the stage of building
where she was getting into the nest and shaping it round her body.
We watched the nest on several occasions afterwards, but did not see
her near it until 16th December, 1949, when we saw her feeding
young. She was beak feeding them, and also appeared to be giving
them some by regurgitation.
The next thing was to see into the nest ; this was difficult, as the
top of the tree where the nest was, was too thin to bear the weight of
either of us. So fixing a piece of mirror to a pole, my friend, who is a
light weight, climbed the next tree, and was able after a lot of trouble
to see the contents of the nest reflected in the mirror. It contained
newly hatched young, he could not see how many.
We visited the nest again on the 24th December, 1949, and again
inspected the young. All he could see was a mass of down reflected
in the mirror. As soon as he climbed down we hid, and the hen
returned, fed the young, and brooded them.
We visited the nest again on 1st January, 1950, and saw that the
young were partly feathered ; we watched the hen feed them, and
then decided to take the young, and if possible catch the hen by
putting the young in a trap. We sawed off the slender tip containing
the nest, and by first having fixed a rope, lowered it gently on to the
ground. It contained two almost completely feathered young, their
heads were still covered with down. One young one was almost twice
the size of the other ; they looked very quaint, and reminded me
somehow of Emu chicks.
We placed the young in the trap as close to where the nest had
been as possible, thinking the mother would return to feed them.
Return she did at once, but not to feed ; all she did was to call to
the young and fly away, obviously asking them to fly away too. We
then put the trap on the ground, put the young in a small cage in the
trap, and put a perch in the trap. This was successful as she at once
flew on the perch in the trap to call them again. It took two hours
to catch her.
I took them home, and put them into a small covered aviary. First
forcibly feeding the young---the hen was very wild and shy, so I made

a hide for her. I did not know whether she would feed the young or
not, so I forcibly fed them myself six times per day ; I could not
get them to gape. I gave them grasshoppers (twenty each), banana,
and hard boiled egg; they seemed to be doing well. I took the
young into the house every night, and put them out with the hen in
the morning ; she always called them into the hide as soon as I put
them down.
This went on for a week ; then I happened to find some ripe
" pink 55 berries ; I gave them to the hen and she rushed them.
Soon after, I saw the red ink berries in the young ones 5 droppings,
so I knew she was feeding them ; I did not forcibly feed them again.
She soon began to feed them on Paw Paw and Mango, and then on
white fleshed peach, she would not touch yellow fleshed peach.
Then on pear and insectile mixture ; she also gave them mealworms,
case moths, grasshoppers, and Cicades ; but she did not start to give
them any insects until I had had her three weeks. I think that this
was because the place where I caught her was alive with insects of
all kinds, and she was surfeited.
I did not see the young feed themselves until I had had them about
one month--that is approximately six weeks old ; they were then
put out into a large planted aviary.
19th February, 1950. The young are quite able to look after
themselves, but the mother, who is now quite tame, is still feeding
them. On 20th March, 1950, I saw both the young Regent birds
playing with green leaves on the ground, and the larger one picking
up sticks.
30th March, 1950. Flecks of yellow are showing on the head of
the smaller young one. I think that the smaller young one is definitely
a male bird, and would not be surprised if the larger one is the hen,
as I have noticed in the bush that the hens always seem larger than
the cocks. I hope definitely to clear up the controversy as to the age
at which the male changes colour.
We only saw the male Regent Bird on one occasion, that was the
day we first found the nest, and it appears to me that he takes no part
in brooding or feeding the young.
The nest was made of sticks, nothing else being used ; large sticks
outside--smaller ones inside.

IMPEYAN NOTES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995377095238095" page_id="56288190"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
By John B. Graf (Colliers, West Virginia, U.S.A.)
From my early Pheasant hobby days the name Impeyan has always
been intriguing to me. It has the ring of the Orient and the mystery
of the Himalayas. Then the majestic bearing and indescribable
beauty of the cock bird have no comparison among all the other
Pheasants. However, their high cost presented a serious barrier to my
hopes of getting them, a barrier that was finally dissolved by the
sacrifice of some waterfowl I had, and at long last I sent for a pair
of that year's hatch.
What a lot of pleasure I had when they arrived, a pleasure
tempered within a week when the cock bird died from an infestation
of lice. That was an expensive loss, but I no longer take for granted
that high priced birds are necessarily free from pests. Personally,
I would never allow such valuable birds to suffer neglect to such an
extent but others don't always feel the same. Having already put
such a sizable amount into my Impeyans I really had to scratch to
buy a cock, but I made it and secured a fine male from a Penn-
sylvania breeder. Glorious is a weak word to describe his beauty as
he walked in the bright spring sunshine, for this was an adult.
There was no hope for eggs that first season so I derived my
pleasure from watching them as they dug with their strong bills in the
heavy sod of their run. They got along well together, and even to
this time I have never seen them fight. All went well until late winter
of that year, and then one day something scared my birds so badly
that they flew against the wire so hard as to pull out a couple of
staples, and two Golden cocks and the male Impeyan escaped. At
once, upon discovery of this mishap, the whole family was called out
to search. The two Goldens were found quite easily but the Impeyan
was of a hardier breed, and I had just about given up hope when just
at dusk one of the searchers located him about a thousand yards away
from his pen. Despite his brilliant colouring he was very hard to see
in his natural surroundings for he stood facing us, and his black
breast didn't show up at all. When we had all assembled we attempted
to drive the truant home but he had his own ideas, for he only walked
a few yards before taking wing. What a sensation ! However, I took
full opportunity to observe his manner of flight. To me it had a
rather flapping quality although strong and swift. His flight carried
for a quarter of a mile when by chance he alighted within my water-
fowl enclosure where he became entangled and was caught. I was
weak but happy as I clutched him tight. At the first opportunity
I pinioned the pair to prevent further such escapades.
Well, that year to my great joy the hen laid seven eggs, all of

which proved fertile, but I had nothing but a borrowed hen under
which to set them and through a series of disasters failed to rear any,
although I had one young for two weeks and another for three.
This year the hen laid two sets of four eggs each. One set I placed
under a steady Barred Rock hen and the other I left with the hen
Pheasant. The broody hen was placed in a coop in a basket. Her
four eggs hatched in twenty-seven days, the final hatching taking
place in an incubator. The Pheasant hen hatched two out of her four,
although all were fertile. She sat on the ground and was extremely
steady at the task, but the weather was very wet, which fact I blame
for the poor hatchability of her set.
The chicks hatched with the hen were handled strictly artificially
because of my anxiety to rear them. One died in a couple of days.
Another lasted ten days and a third finally succumbed to slipped
tendon. One I raised.
The hen Pheasant took good care of her two little ones but at two
weeks one disappeared, why I never found out. The other she reared
and it appeared to be the healthier of the two young. One unusual
fact was that the hen Pheasant took thirty days to hatch out her
young.
During the breeding season I had the pleasure of seeing the cock
in display. Standing directly in front of the hen he tipped forward
until his bill touched the ground. His wings were slightly spread and
his tail was spread to its fullest extent forming a background for his
magnificent plumage. Holding this posture for perhaps five seconds,
he went through a pumping action. During two seasons I have only
seen this display once.
With two young to ease the pressure I am able to enjoy them all
the more. To me, at least, their rarity makes for greater pleasure
and their unsurpassed iridescence is a constant source of inspiration.
Who can doubt God when such birds roam this earth ?
I should like to see these birds cheap enough so that more fanciers
could enjoy them. Perhaps as time brings improved methods of
rearing and better feeds this can be attained. It is with this end in
mind that I have written these lines.

<bodyText confidence="0.99787680952381" page_id="56288192"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
By Pradyuman K. Desai (Bhavnagar, India)
On reading a note on breeding generations of Grey Parrots in
California, I felt that it would be worth while if I, too, wrote a short
article and described my own experience and that of my father,
Mr. Kanchanrai Desai, in this direction. Here, in Bhavnagar, we
have been conducting the experiment of breeding these birds in
captivity for the last thirty years, and I can say without hesitation
that it has proved quite successful.
The original pair was an imported one. But to describe the entire
experiment, it would be better if I began by relating how my father
hit upon the idea of breeding the Greys thirty years ago.
It was at that time thought that the Africans were exporting only
birds of one sex, that is either the males or the females. My father
had recently bought a Grey Parrot which was directly imported from
Africa. At the time of buying it he did not bother to determine its
sex. From the size and colour, however, he could tell that it was
a male. Also it was then believed that only the males turned out
good talkers, and this particular bird was a talker in the real sense
of the word. A few years later my father bought another Grey Parrot
for a friend of his who asked him to train it for him. So my father
had two imported birds on hand which he started to teach how to
talk, side by side on a table.
My father being a born bird-lover, not a single gesture of these
birds would escape him without jneaning. One afternoon his own
Parrot showed signs of courting. This convinced him that the other
bird was a female. For further verification, however, the two birds
were taken out of their small cages and, although they had lost the
power of flight, they were released inside a closed room. As soon as
they contacted each other they began to fight. Perhaps this was due
to the fact that neither bird had seen one of its own species at close
quarters and without any barriers between them for a long time, and
the natural instinct was to consider the other an intruder. After they
had had a few fights my father called it a day and they were separated
and removed to their own cages.
The above process was continued every afternoon and soon they
not only stopped fighting but they got decidedly familiar with each 1
other. In a few days their friendship became so pronounced that as
soon as they were released inside the room they met each other with
their beaks as if they were shaking each other's hand and saying
" Good Afternoon ! ". Within the course of two weeks they under-
stood each other perfectly well and declared their respective sexes
beyond any doubt whatsoever. The female began to crouch with j

widespread wings and the tail slightly raised and the male began to
feed his ladylove from his own crop. These gestures and other overtures
were none other than those of a real pair.
This went on for six weeks, and then something happened which
upset my father's plans, at least temporarily. The owner of the
female came to our house and said that he wanted to take it away,
thinking that by now it must have increased its vocabulary. My father
told him that the bird, being a female, was a slow learner, but if he
was not in a hurry to take it back he would like to carry on with his
experiment. However, the gentleman was not at all interested in
breeding, nor did he realize the importance of such an experiment,
and so, much to my father's disappointment, he took his bird with him.
My father felt bitterly about this little incident because he knew he
would find it difficult to procure another female. First, the price of
Grey Parrots was almost prohibitive according to the standards
prevalent in 1920, the year in which he began his experiment, though
not according to present-day standards ; and, secondly, as little was
then known about identification of sexes he knew he could not make
sure at the time of purchase whether he was buying a female.
Fortunately, however, after about six months my father's friend
returned with the female and told my father that he was now ready
to have young ones bred out of her. My father replied that there
could not be a time limit in such an experiment and that one had to
wait and watch. If, however, the experiment proved successful, he
could either take his female back or have the pick of the clutch.
He agreed to the latter condition and allowed my father to keep the
bird as an experimental female.
Naturally, my father once again had to begin right from the
beginning, keeping the two cages sufficiently near each other so that
the birds could touch each other's beaks and thus renew their old
friendship. Soon it was evident from their behaviour that they knew
their sexes. At this stage they were allowed the freedom of a closed
room for a few hours every day. In a very short time their friendship
grew so thick that my father thought it best to keep them in the same
cage. Living together all the twenty-four hours, the birds began their
family life in right earnest and in a few weeks' time the female laid
an egg on the floor of their cage. This was rather sudden and we did
not know what was best in the circumstances. However, we gave the
female bird a table-drawer with a bed of straw and put her egg into it.
She at once grasped the idea and, going into the drawer, sat on the
egg. While thus sitting she began throwing out the straw with her
beak, blade by blade. Another day passed without further progress,
but on the third day she laid another egg. She went on laying every
alternate day until the total was five, and then settled down to
incubating the eggs. However, after an interval of two weeks she
suddenly deserted her nest.

In order to find out whether there was any sign of life, my father
broke open all the five eggs but what he found was only yellow and
white liquid matter. However, this did not disappoint us because I
even though the eggs proved duds, the fact that the female bird did
lay was a decided step forward towards the ultimate success of the
experiment. So we continued to keep the two birds in the same cage,
and before a month had passed they started courting again. While
courting, the male used to feed his mate from his own crop. Also he
used to spread his wings, uttering a continuous coughing sound. And
one afternoon we found them mating. It lasted for ten to twelve
minutes. This delighted us immensely because we thought that now
we would definitely get young ones out of the pair.
The female laid a clutch of five eggs as before. This time she was
provided with sawdust as bedding instead of straw. She seemed to
like this new arrangement and started incubating the eggs seriously.
We did not know the exact period of incubation. However, we
examined the eggs after three weeks but found them all infertile again.
Of course, these repeated failures did not defeat us and we went on
experimenting. During the following eight months the female laid
fifteen eggs altogether. By this time we had provided the pair with
a separate room and an earthen pot, raised on a mound of earth, as
nest-hole.
The female next laid a clutch of three eggs. This time they were
tested on the twenty-fourth day. The first two eggs examined were
infertile but the third one contained a live embryo floating in blood.
This meant that we were progressing most satisfactorily in our
experiment and not far from the ultimate goal. However, we had to
wait for nearly two months before the next clutch of eggs was laid in
June of 1921. Altogether there were three eggs. This time we decided
not to be impatient but to wait and see.
My father bored a hole in one of the doors of the room where the
birds were kept. This device enabled us to watch their family life
without unduly disturbing them. The male was most exacting in his
behaviour with his mate, as if he was as anxious as we were to see
that the young ones did hatch out from the eggs this time. Thus, he
would not allow the female to leave the nest excepting for natural
calls or for having an occasional stroll in their room. For food, he
would permit her only soft fruits, like pappaiya, banana, guava, and
pomegranate, and in grains he allowed her to have fresh Indian corn,
soaked grams, millet, and husked rice from his own crop. Sugar cane
was also a permissible item.
On the thirty-first day after the first egg was laid, when my father
went inside their room with their lunch on a tray, he found a fragment
of eggshell lying on the ground near the nest. He at once knew that
something was up. He bent down to see inside the earthen pot whether

there was any sign of life under the female, but while he was in this
attitude the male, who had turned quite a savage almost overnight,
got hold of his thumb and gave it a nasty bite. This bite was so severe
that my father's whole arm turned blue, and remained so for weeks.
However, my father was so elated at this new development that he
did not mind the bite and managed to see a wriggling young one in
yellowish down.
This was a great day for us, indeed, because at last we were fully
rewarded for all our troubles. Another young one was hatched out of
the second egg on the third day but the last egg turned out to be an
infertile one.
Now it was almost impossible to enter the room without first taking
the male into custody because, hearing the cries of the young ones,
he had become totally wild. The female, however, was quite docile.
The male was guarding her all the twenty-four hours and would not
allow her to leave the nest. He used to feed her regularly, and she
in her turn fed the babies. In the beginning the young ones were fed
on some liquid substance, like milk, produced from the crop, but as
they grew on they were allowed coarser food.
Within the next two years my father managed to get from this pair
fourteen young ones altogether. In each of the first three broods
three eggs were laid but only two young ones were hatched out ; in
the next two broods all the three eggs were hatched out, and in the
last two broods only one was hatched out of the usual clutch of three
eggs. The last young one thus bred had its feet upturned, but my
father eventually set them right by carefully bandaging them. This
young one was so much attached to my father that once when he was
out the whole day he found on his return that his pet had died without
any apparent cause.
The original pair did not live long after this, but we are proud of
the fact that we got fourteen young ones out of them before they died.
Of this lot, six are still living and they are added to the collection of
His Highness the Maharaja Saheb of Bhavnagar. Here, some
distinguished visitors would not believe that they were Bhavnagar-bred
and said that they would first like to see me breed young ones out of
these birds before they could believe my story. I told them that they
were all immature birds and would not start breeding before they
were fifteen years at least. In due course, however, I got an opportunity
of demonstrating to their satisfaction that if African Grey Parrots are
handled properly they do breed in captivity.
I acquired an imported mature female and kept her in a small room
in the Palace aviary with one of our young males, who was then nearly
fifteen. After they were thus kept for a year the female laid infertile
eggs, but in June of 1937 she hatched out a full clutch of three eggs.
In all this pair produced seven young ones in two years. The broods

were of three, two, and two out of a full clutch of three eggs each
time. Out of this lot, up to date, only two of the first clutch and one
of the second clutch have survived.
In 1947 I acquired an imported male for one of the females bred
by my father. They were kept in a small cage, measuring 6 feet by
3 feet. This pair, too, laid infertile eggs for the first time. However,
a clutch of three eggs was laid in July of 1949, the first egg arriving
on the 2nd. Out of this clutch two young ones were hatched out.
Their eyes opened on 17th August, the pinions grew on 5th September,
and the red tail-tip was noticed on 15th of that month. Out of these
two young Parrots, one has survived. Then the female laid three eggs,
and all the three were hatched out successfully, but owing to the
unusual severity of the winter none has survived.
Now I have been able to acquire an imported female for my
Palace-bred male, which is twelve years old, and hope to breed a
few young ones out of them.
Before I conclude I will add a few words about how I identify the
sexes. The female grey is lighter in colour with rather a smaller head
and feet. As she matures she grows light pink feathers, which may
be found anywhere on the body but particularly on the thighs, back,
and neck. Also, the tail is shorter than the wings. The male, on the
other hand, is darker in colour and his tail being longer it is visible
beyond the point where the wings overlap. Moreover, his feet, beak,
and head look stouter.
For food I give my birds a variety of fruit, such as pappaiya,
guava, banana, pomegranate, melons, etc., and grains like fresh
Indian corn, soaked gram, millet, white millet, and husked rice. I also
give them sugar-cane and ground-nuts. I prefer to give them fruit
in the morning and grains and nuts in the evening.
Cleaning the cage twice a day is an absolute necessity, and a bath
in the afternoon is a most welcome item to the birds.
It is my experience that the talking faculty is developed when the
bird becomes a year old and as it advances in age it goes on adding
new words practically every day. Not only that, it imitates the sounds
it hears but it associates these sounds with things connected with them.
For example, one of my parrots not only imitates my voice perfectly
but it says " I am going ", the words I usually address to my wife
when I am to go out, as soon as he sees me dressed up for the street.
So far as I know my father and I are the only persons who have
bred African Grey Parrots in India, and probably very few have
attempted to breed them in captivity elsewhere. However, this hobby
is an excellent pastime, and it is earnestly hoped that bird-lovers in
this country and abroad will try their hand at it. Keeping a pet is,
indeed, a great joy, but this joy increases a thousandfold when the pet
is home-bred.

By Carl Naether (Sherman Oaks, California, U.S.A.)
It was shortly after four in the morning of an unforgettable day in
Sequoia National Park. Dog-tired from an 18 mile hike, I had slept
the troubled sleep of the over-weary till near 4 o'clock, when one of
those ubiquitous (in two senses) prowlers of Western camp sites, a
chipmunk, nosing about for things edible, collided noisily with my
pots and pans, startled me into sudden wakefulness. I was lying flat
on my back on the hard dry ground of a small, quadrangular, barren
space walled in by mighty sequoias. Far up, against the star-studded
greying sky I could just discern the almost imperceptible sway of
their topmost branches in the chill Sierra breeze.
My legs were a curious mixture of numbness and aches and pains,
the penalty of unaccustomed trudging up and down dusty, rock-strewn
trails ; my back was sore from the rough hardness of my " bed
And I was chilled, to the verge of shivering ; and yet I knew that it
was useless to change position, for throughout that restless night, with
all my turnings and twistings back and forth and roundabout, I had
been utterly unable to contrive surcease from pain or to make my
two flimsy blankets a sufficient shield against the cold night air.
Four o'clock being, even for a vacation day, too early to get up and
rustle firewood for breakfast, with such stoicism as I could muster I lay
gazing into the open sky. Its blazing stars hung low over the black,
amorphous tops of the giant sequoias like twinkling eyes--I fancied--*
peering curiously into the mysterious darkness below. The vast
enveloping stillness was broken by the chipmunk, making sudden foray
among the impedimenta on the camp table ; as quickly restored, after
his brief and fruitless search, he slipped soundlessly away. Though
the uppermost tips of the trees were plainly shifting to and fro in the
chill air, I could not hear the wind ; but I knew that the dawn breeze
was shaking awake the dwellers of the tree tops, laving both them
and their fragrant homes with its clean cold stream, was readying
the forest world for the business of the day.
Suddenly the mountain quietude was disrupted by a solitary, faint
call--of a bird, so far away I could not identify the caller--though
I made my suppositions. This much I knew : it was not the sombre,
inimical cry of an Owl or other nocturnal hunter ; it was sweetly
joyous--more like a cheerful hail to the dawn light that must be
spreading over there on the eastern sky beyond the mountains. As I
lay straining eye and ear to determine direction and place from which
the startling, stirring sound had come I heard it again--and yet
again--each time more distantly, each time more dynamic. It was
the reveille, the morning caroling of a Western Robin perched aloft

in some distant tree ; and it was growing more jubilant with each
passing moment. Now there was no mistaking the homey, friendly
voice. And then, from here and there, from near and far, the call
was repeated and multiplied in ever-growing crescendo.
The bugler had sounded the call to song, and never was command
obeyed more volubly and cheerfully. No grumbling, no drowsy
peevishness and protest here. Seemingly from every tree top within
range of my ears the music poured, ever beginning, ever ending,
a continuous, but never monotonous, musical round. In the sequoia
wall about me there must have been literally scores of these much-
beloved birds blending their voices in a magnificent avian concert,
the like of which I had never before heard. Myriads more of them,
I knew, were also singing at that moment in all the higher mountains
along the whole long length of this western region--what a sublime
choral for the ear of God !
It was a wholly natural performance--leaderless, uncontrived--
with individual birds joining at will to augment the unseen choir, to
repeat over and over again the short melodious call of their species.
The whole forest resounded with the joyful matin for perhaps ten
minutes--thrilling, never-to-be-forgotten minutes ; and then, as the
first rays of the sun streaked through the sequoias' twisted crowns,
grew fainter--and yet fainter, till at length it died quite away at the
coming of full daylight, when Robin abandoned completely the
pleasure of singing for the business of getting his morning meal.
Every lover of avian music knows that words cannot describe
adequately the sound of a bird's voice ; how futile it would be for
me to attempt to represent in prosy terms to the inward ear the
grand swell and diminuendo of that morning chorus. But the effect
upon me measured the wonder of it. Forgotten was my cold dis-
comfort, vanished my aches and pains, and I rose with alacrity from
my hard and simple bed, with a song, too--in my heart, if not upon
my lips, a renewed interest in life and the world about me, and a
challenge of pleasant expectation for the new day.

Welcoming the guest of the evening, the Chairman said it was really
not so very remarkable that he should address aviculturists on the
collecting of orchids. Aviculture and horticulture had much in
common, and some of the greatest aviculturists--the late W. E.
Teschemaker, the late Hubert Astley, a former President of the
Society, Jean Delacour, and the present President, Alfred Ezra, had
been or were keen horticulturists.
Mr. Hermon Slade then showed a large selection of Kodachrome
slides to illustrate orchid hunting in New Guinea. Members were
specially interested to see a picture of Fred Shaw Mayer.
While by no means avicultural, or even ornithological, Mr. Slade's
excellent photographs and graphic description were greatly appre-
ciated by his audience, and this appreciation was shown by sustained
applause.

It has been reported from Australia that Mr. G. Ruddle, of Fullarton,
Adelaide, has bred a blue Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet. The breeding
took place in a large aviary containing some twenty pairs of Queen
Alexandras. Mr. Ruddle was able to ring the parents, and the four
other young in the nest. It would seem that here is an excellent
opportunity to establish this mutation.

T. R. Holmes Watkins writes : "I thought you might like to know
that I have recently received three pairs of Common Kings and three
pairs of Splendids from Australia. The latter were an alternative
choice to six adult Crimson-wing hens, of which eventually we were
able to find only one aviary-bred specimen for sale throughout South
Australia ! It was a great credit to whoever had charge of them
during the long voyage that there were no losses, and that the birds
were in such excellent condition on arrival. It took practically a year
to get the birds through, and though private importation may never
have been an entirely simple matter to-day it is not a venture to be
lightly embarked on." To avoid unnecessary correspondence, it
should be stated none of these Parrakeets is for sale.

P. H. Tancred, Sydney, reports : " Since last writing you I have
bred seven young from two pairs of Yellow-tailed or Yellow-rumped
Finches (Donacola fiaviprymna ). Two unfortunately died, but the
remaining five are doing well. One pair has gone to nest again. I have
had these birds over two years, and kept them in adjoining aviaries.
They made no attempt to nest until I put both pairs together. It
seems as though they might be colony breeders.
I have never seen these birds breeding in any other aviary during
the last thirty years. To some aviculturists they are dull-coloured
birds, in addition they are seldom imported here. I have seen crosses

with the Chestnut Finch.
Many breeders here, and particularly in Adelaide, go in for African
Waxbills, Parrot Finches, Siskins, etc.
Aviary-bred Finches bring the following prices : Melba, Red-faced,
Cordon Bleu, Blue-breasted, #6 pair ; Ruddies, Orange-breast,
Aurora, #3 ioj. pair ; Parrot #7."

Dr. E Beraut, who now lives at Rio de Janeiro, writes :--
" I am still very much interested in Humming Birds, and I begin
to have a nice local collection of fourteen species, missing only three
or four of all those I have seen in the neighbourhood. Contrary to
previous experience, they do not fight. I keep birds of various size
together, from the tiny Calliphilox to large Ramphodon. The terrible
Eupetomena and Thalurania go a little after the others, but without
any real viciousness. This happy state of things is probably due to
the crowding : I keep twenty-five Hummers in an aviary 11 feet by
6 feet. They live perfectly and are tremendously active ; I practically
lose none, but they are looked after very carefully. I secure them with
a blowpipe, and it is a most exciting sport. It is difficult and fairly
exhausting, as it is necessary to be on the spot at daybreak."

For many years Canary breeders have been trying to establish
strains of red Canaries by crossing the domestic hens with male Red
Siskins (Carduelis cucullata), a pretty and popular species which, on
account of excessive trapping, has become rare in its restricted home
in the mountains of Venezuela. Scarlet Canaries have yet to be seen,
but birds of many shades of orange, apricot, and pink, some very
deep, are now seen regularly at bird shows in Europe and in America.
They have been first obtained in recrossing hybrid males, usually
fertile, to female canaries. Hybrid females are sterile as a rule. That
this is not always true has been proved by Mrs. L. Otersen, of New
York. A female hybrid, recrossed to her father, a Red Siskin, pro-
duced a fertile egg in June, 1948. Mrs. Otersen reports as follows
(Bull. Bird Fanciers' Association, April, 1951) :--
"We have been hybridizing with Siskins for about six years, and
each year we had tried different first cross females, but without
success. We had mated them to our best males which we knew were
foolproof. None had ever laid an egg or acted as though they wanted

to nest. On 20th May, 1946, in a nest of first cross hybrids, we raised
a hen which we first thought was a male due to its size. When it
went through the moult we knew it was a female, but was about two
or three times larger than any first cross female we had ever raised
or seen. We sold and gave away as pets many first cross hens, but
this hen we had always kept, and couldn't really tell why. The
mother was a fine orange hen and a wonderful breeder and feeder.
The Siskin himself was a fine breeder.
" Some time in 1948, we attended a meeting of the Connecticut
Canary Breeders' Club, and fortunately for us we had the pleasure
of hearing a very interesting lecture by Dr. Bushnell of the University
of Connecticut, which formerly was known as Storrs Agricultural
College.
"It was through the untiring efforts of Dr. George Corwin, the
present President of the Club, that Dr. Bushnell appeared.
" One part of his talk dwelt on hybridization, and after the meeting
we had a talk with the Doctor, and spoke to him of our first cross
female hybrid, and mentioned the hen of such unusual size, and the
fact that she had laid several nests of normal-looking eggs and mated,
set and acted as normally as any Canary hen we had. He said the
fact that she laid and was of such unusual size that we should try her
as long as we could. We did as stated above, without success.
" Dr. Bushnell advised us that they did quite a little hybridizing
at the college, and one of the things they looked for and which was
important to them, was hens of the first cross that were a great deal
larger than the usual run. He said he felt we might have something
in this particular hen and do everything possible to get a fertile nest
from her.
" Then, late in 1949, I had a letter from a Mr. Ray Murray, of
Australia, and in corresponding back and forth he advised that he
had a few ideas regarding the first cross female hybrid, and hoped
we would have time to try them out this year. I wrote and told him
about my trials, which proved to be mostly errors, but also mentioned
this one particular hen.
"It so happened, however, that before I heard from him again,
I mated this hen to her father the Siskin, and about a week after-
wards, I received a most interesting letter from Mr. Murray, and I am
quoting that part of the letter which may prove interesting to others.
He has promised that when he does get to experimenting with his
female first cross hybrids, that he will keep accurate data on same,
and send to us with permission, if I like, to write it up in some
magazine. c I have never had a first cross hen lay yet, but have
three or four build nests. I heard of a Pigeon fancier giving a hen
that always had clear eggs, some fertile eggs from another pair.
They successfully reared these, and what is more, their own eggs

from then on were fertile. Have you tried the hybrid hen back to its
parent? I believe there are three types of hybrids. One that is
sterile, another that is fertile to almost any other bird, and the third
is only fertile when mated back to the parents, and or a male or hen
of the same parents. It will be worth a try as young from a Siskin
and a first cross should give you a good colour. 5
" On 25th June, 1950, the baby is just three days old, and a fine
healthy cross being raised by a foster mother."

There have been very few new arrivals. The most interesting came
from the Calcutta Zoo and comprised one pair Nicobar Pigeons
[Caloma nicobarica), one pair Painted Spur-fowl [Galloperdix lunulata ),
and one pair Sonnerat's Jungle-fowl [Gallus sonneratii). It is good to
see Nicobars again as they are among the most striking and curious
of the Pigeon tribe. The Spur-fowl are the first of this species for
many years.
A pair of Ashy-headed Geese [Chloephaga poliocephala) was presented
by Mr. Alfred Ezra, who has regular successful breeding results with
this species. The last pair presented by him (in 1949) was taken by
a fox--a queer happening in the heart of London !
A Red-headed Bunting [Emberiza bruniceps ) came to us in an unusual
way ; it flew into a bedroom in a London flat. This was, of course,
an escape, and others were reported about the same time in different
parts of London.
A Velvet Scoter [Melanitta fused) was found oiled up on the south
coast and sent to us. It did well for a while after treatment but did
not survive for many days.
We received a Manchurian Crane [Megalornis japonensis) via
Whipsnade Park, where it was bred. The Great Eagle-Owls [Bubo
bubo) that reared three young last year have bred again.
On the whole, everything is very late in nesting, which is not
surprising in view of the abnormally wet and cold winter.
The earliest Pheasants to lay are the Edwards 5 . Redrumps,

NOTES FROM THE NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL
PARK

By Lee S. Crandall (General Curator)
While Penguins of the Jack-ass group ( Spheniscus ) can accustom
themselves to the high temperatures of New York summers, those from
deeper in the Antarctic seem unable to do so. Following extensive
experiments, a special house for Penguins was constructed in the
New York Zoological Park, and opened to the public in June, 1950.
A mean temperature of 55 0 F. the year around, is maintained by a
balance of cooled or heated air, as may be required. This incoming
air enters through special filters, designed to intercept dust and the
spores of molds so often fatal to Penguins. The water is run through
alternating filters, so that the constant flow is cleared of visible
impurities. The glass-fronted tank, 24 feet in length, gives visibility
to the birds above or below the water. The birds, including Kings,
a Gentoo, a Rock-hopper, and several Black-footed, have done very
well indeed, and the exhibit has proved to be immensely popular with
the public.
As everyone knows, captive Penguins do not ordinarily spend as
much time in the water as Zoo visitors might wish, and to see the birds
swimming is actually an uncommon treat. One curious aspect of our
new exhibit is that the birds are more in the pool than out, and can
be depended upon for an engaging show at any time. We are at a
loss for a reason, and can only suggest that the explanation lies in the
fact that the water is not artificially cooled and in summer, at least,
is always several degrees warmer than the air in the exhibit.
As reported in Avicultural Magazine for November-December,
1949, there was a single female among the Congo Peacocks (.Afropovo
congensis ) brought to the New York Zoological Park by Charles Gordier
in June, 1949. As a matter of record, it should be reported that this
female died 19th March, 1950, following an apparent accident. With
her passing, there was an end of our hopes of establishing the species
in captivity.
However, there were mitigating developments. On post mortem
examination, it was found that the ovary was completely atrophied,
and that the oviduct was vestigial. When the remains finally went to
the American Museum of Natural History and reached the hands of
Dr. James P. Chapin, the discoverer of Afropavo , he found that the
plumage was interspersed with black feathers, indicative of a beginning
change to male coloration. It thus appears that our only female was
well beyond breeding age, and that our hopes were doomed to
disappointment from the beginning.

ULLA BRITT AND THE BIRDS. By Laurens Sargent.

This is a children's book that will appeal as much to their elders.
The adventures, real and imagined, but most often a mixture of both,
of the little Swedish girl Ulla-Britt are wholly delightful. Not only
does the author very evidently know both his birds and his children,
but he gives a vivid picture of the common birds and everyday life
of Northern Sweden. One could perhaps wish that the Magpie had
been allowed to defend his character, which the Wood Pigeon blackens
so heartily. After all, the Snowy Owl is allowed to vindicate his
predations, and Ulla-Britt's relatives take the Golden-eye's eggs. It
seems odd that the author should recommend another book, Cranes
Flying South , which although not without its funny aspect is the most
misleading rubbish from a natural history standpoint. The illustrations
by Neave Parker are mostly very good--the one of the Wood Pigeon
being a notable exception--and capture the " jizz " of the creatures
portrayed admirably.

be allowed their liberty as far as possible throughout the year. If confined for more
than a few weeks they may, on release, stray as promptly and irretrievably as any
bought bird. Hens are much more reliable and there is little risk in confining them
in the " nesting " aviary for as long as may be necessary to prevent over-breeding.
At the present time, after a year's selective breeding, I have about thirty reliable,
tested birds which will not stray at any season.
To add to their attractiveness I have been taming them to feed from the hand
with spinach beet as the tit-bit. They are so passionately fond of this plant, when
breeding, that taming is no trouble at all.

By Ken Stott, Jr.
(General Curator, Zoological Gardens of San Diego, California, U.S.A.)
The captive breeding and nesting of Hornbills is sufficiently
unusual, we feel, to warrant a detailed report of an event which
occurred recently in the Zoological Gardens of San Diego. The fact
that the nesting did not result in successful reproduction is regrettable,
but it in no way diminishes the potential worth of the observations
made while courtship and nest-building were in process. In this
report, the author serves mainly as compilator of notes and observa-
tions recorded by various members of the Zoo staff, and he wishes to
acknowledge in particular the data supplied by Mr. Kenton G. Lint,
Curator of Birds, and Mrs. Nancy Bode, of the Publications Depart-
ment.
The Hornbills involved in the San Diego nesting were the Great
or Goncave-casqued (Buceros bicornis Linne), a species which, according
to Peters, inhabits the " Western coast of India from Bombay to
Travancore ; Himalayas from Kuman to eastern Assam ; Burma,
Malay Peninsula, Siam, Indo-China ; (and) Sumatra ". The Zoo's
two specimens, a male and female, were obtained as adults in
November, 1948, and the dealer from whom they were purchased
believed they had probably been collected in Siam.
While the two Hornbills seemed compatible from the date of their
arrival in the Zoo, no evident signs of courting were observed until
the early part of February, 1951. At this time the two were seen
to touch bills frequently, and the male's interest in the female became
increasingly apparent. Her response was at first negligible, appearing
to be more one of toleration than of encouragement. Gradually her
interest increased, however, and approximately two weeks after the
first signs of courting were noted the male began to attempt to feed
the female. Again, her initial response appeared to be one of disinterest
but eventually she began to accept his food offerings and, as time
passed, she came to participate in the ceremony eagerly.

<bodyText confidence="0.999190755555556" page_id="56288214"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
On 6th March mating was noted for the first time. According to
Mr. Lint it was repeated throughout the major part of the day,
at the end of which the female in particular seemed to be in a state
of near exhaustion.
Parenthetic to the first signs of courtship, Mr. Lint and his associates
had placed a three foot deep nesting barrel suspended on its side
from the top of the Hornbill cage. The upper half of the " front "
side of the keg had been left open, the lower half having been covered
with plywood. Throughout the month of courtship both birds had
entered the nesting barrel with increasing frequency.
On 21 st March actual construction work on the nest was first
reported both birds working on the right side of the nest opening.
Despite past and contrasting reports that only the male participated
in plastering (or only the female), both birds co-operated in the task
from the start, and continued to do so until after the female had
entered the nest and the male was preoccupied with supplying her
with food. From this time on the female executed most of the
plastering.
The first observation (21st March) was recorded as follows : " The
female was inside the nest, the male on the perch just outside the
nest, and both birds were plastering at the right-hand lower corner
of the opening. They were evidently using material obtained from
inside the nest. Both birds used the side of the bill to smooth and tamp
the plaster. After they had worked for half an hour the female
emerged from the nest. The male fed the female and then followed
her from one perch to another for a few minutes. Mating ensued."
On 22nd March it became obvious that the three-eighth inch
plywood which had been used to cover the lower half of the barrel
opening was not sufficiently thick to support the two-inch thick
wall which the Hornbills had begun to construct. Consequently, on
the day following the initial construction work of the Hornbills,
Mr. Lint and his co-workers increased the thickness of the lower
half to approximately six inches by backing the plywood with adobe
mud. At the same time, the lower half of the face of the nest was
camouflaged with adobe. The Hornbills were only temporarily
disturbed by the man-made additions to the nest, and resumed the
task of plastering the upper half of the opening shortly after the
keepers had left the cage.
Although piles of both mud and sand had been placed on the floor
of the cage, neither bird was seen to visit either pile at any time.
The material with which they plastered was grey and apparently
non-granular in texture, and may well have included among its
components the fine sand which had been placed in the bottom of the
nesting barrel. However, it is believed that the chief ingredient of the
plaster was the faecal matter produced by the female. In each

observed instance of defecation, the female turned her rear quarters
toward the adobe base of the front side of the nest before ejecting
faeces, and it was from this point that both birds were seen to obtain
plastering material. A further plaster ingredient was, on several
occasions at least, regurgitated food.
During the early stages of walling up the nest opening the male
once again appeared to be the more persistent of the two. Often
the female appeared to tire of the task, and would emerge from the
nest and drop down to one of the lower perches of the cage. In one
such instance the male continued plastering for perhaps five minutes ;
then he flew down to the perch and sat beside the female. He made
repeated attempts to force her from the perch and back to the nest.
After failing he returned to the nest and began plastering again.
After another period of approximately five minutes he again dropped
to the perch in an equally unsuccessful effort to persuade her to
return to work.
Throughout the construction period the male continued to feed
the female, even while the female was yet at complete liberty. When
the food was placed in the tray both birds would descend to the
feeding platform, each selecting those items which appealed to it.
Then the female would return to and enter the nest, after which the
male would regurgitate food items individually (not collectively, and
in a conveniently produced sac, as has been reported) and present
them to the female.
Mr. Lint had already altered the customary diet of the Hornbills
by increasing the protein content : more hard-boiled eggs, mice,
baby chicks, and milk-soaked bread. In the face of the prospective
confinement of the female, Mr. Lint had also increased foods with
high water content such as oranges, tomatoes, grapes, and soaked
raisins to prevent dehydration in the female. Increased rations of
these dietary elements supplemented customary amounts of cooked
sweet potatoes, lettuce, and diced bananas.
By 24th March the nest opening had decreased to an oval just
large enough to permit the passage of the female's body, and it was
upon this date that she went into the nest to stay. By the following
day the hole had decreased appreciably, and by 26th March it had
assumed roughly the shape of a circle with a six-inch diameter.
The opening was now too small for the female to pass through it.
The plastering continued, both birds participating, but now the female
seemed more industrious than the male, and proceeded to put on
the finishing touches, working from the inside. The work continued
until 6th April, at which time the opening was sufficiently small
to satisfy the Hornbills. It was now oblong in shape, approximately
two and a half inches across, and perhaps six inches in height.
After the female entered the nest to stay the male's interest in

plastering appeared to wane. His activities were subsequently con-
centrated on supplying the female with an adequate amount of food.
At one feeding the male presented her with eleven small pieces of
tomato, at another he gave her twenty-five grapes at a time, and on
a third occasion he was seen to give her fifty grapes at a single feeding.
It was impossible to detect any visible change in the regurgigated
food items with which he supplied her. They appeared to be whole
and intact ; in other words, unaltered by the brief period they had
spent in his crop.
The feeding pattern varied slightly from one time to another.
After the male had devoured a " capacity load ", he would pick up
a final item of food from the feeding tray and fly to the perch, holding
this last bit of food in the tip of his bill. Once on the perch he would
attract the female's attention either by tapping on the mud wall
about the nest opening, or by trumpeting a single, short, and typically
resonant blast. Usually she responded by placing the tip of her bill
at the nest opening. If she did not respond promptly, he would
thrust his head through the opening towards her.
When she had assumed a receptive attitude he would present her
with the morsel of food he still held in the tip of his bill. Sometimes
she would take it in the tip of her bill and swallow it immediately,
but upon other occasions she would " hand " it back to him. After
holding it for a moment, he would again present it to her. Often the
same morsel of food would be passed back and forth several times before
the female would finally swallow it. After the female had consumed
the first piece of food the male would regurgitate subsequent items,
one at a time, and each with a gasping, head-dipping cough.
At one feeding he regurgitated a creamy, viscous mass of bread
and milk which he presented to the female. This she refused firmly
and persistently, and eventually he gave up, placing it on the outside
of the nest just below the opening. When he began to smear it around
the nest wall the female peered out of the opening, and after watching
him momentarily took some of the material in her beak and likewise
used it as a plaster medium. The use of bread and milk in plastering
was observed subsequently on several occasions.
On i st April the vocal expression of the female underwent sufficient
change that Mr. Lint seriously considered the possibility that an egg
had been laid. He described the sounds as " cackling "--not the
typical throaty trumpeting. On 2nd April Mr. Lint carried a ladder
into the enclosure and inspected the nest. His suspicions were con-
firmed by the presence of a single egg which lay about ten inches
from the back of the nest. While the female did not seem particularly
distressed by Mr. Lint's intrusion, the male appeared to be highly
nervous and upset, hopping from perch to perch and croaking loudly.
This was the last occasion upon which the interior of the nest was

<bodyText confidence="0.999386688888889" page_id="56288217"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
observed, and henceforth every effort was made to disturb the birds
as little as possible.
The female continued to work at the periphery of the nest opening
through 6th April, after which no further construction work was
noted.
From this date on the female was less and less in evidence. Her
vocalizations decreased in frequency, and her head and bill were
seen less often through the opening in the nest wall. Furthermore,
the male began to slacken his pace in feeding operations, his visits
to the nest becoming fewer each day. He spent long hours sitting
in the sun with his head bent over backwards until the top of his
enormous yellow and black casque lay on his back. At other times
his behaviour seemed extremely erratic. He would hop nervously
and aimlessly from one perch to another, croaking as he did so.
On the 9th of April the male was seen pecking viciously at the
edge of the opening. Late in the afternoon of 10th April Mr. Lint
observed distinct signs of displeasure of the male Hornbill when a
number of Black-crowned Night Herons congregated in eucalyptus
trees near the cage. The entire Zoo reverberated with the deep
resonant roars of the male for a period of about five minutes ;
Mr. Lint afterwards commented that he now saw the reason for the
Malayan name, malamorakki , which means " mountain shaker 55 .
Throughout the day the male had continued to chip away at the
mud on the face of the nest. On this and for the following fourteen
days the male was seen to thrust his head into the nest frequently,
but the female was at no time seen or heard. The male continued
intermittently to break away the plaster until 24th April, by which
time he had chipped off enough material to permit him to enter the
nest, which he did.
Finally, on 30th April, Mr. Lint's growing alarm caused him to feel
it necessary to re-enter the cage, although he was understandably
reluctant to risk disturbing a sitting female. His fears were confirmed.
Despite the fact that no odour nor concentration of flies had been
observed, the female was lying dead in the nest, and from all appear-
ances had been dead for several days. Two eggs were discovered,
one entire and one broken, and, upon autopsy of the female, her body
was found to contain a third egg. The contents of the one unbroken
egg showed no mark of fertility. This egg weighed 56 grams ; it
measured 65 by 45 mm. The broken egg measured 70 by 50 mm., and
may have been fractured by the male after the female's death.
Autopsy revealed no clue to the cause of death ; unfortunately,
the lengthy period between the female's demise and the discovery of
the body had obliterated any diagnostic hints the tissues and organs
may previously have shown. The carcass was crawling with maggots.
Only the plumage remained in relatively good condition, and there

was no obvious sign that the moult which Hornbill females are reputed
to undergo during the confinement period had begun.
Although the presence of an unlaid egg might suggest the possibility
of egg-binding, there was no indication of this condition. Slow
starvation was another possibility, yet the Hornbill's stomach was
described as being half full of food. There was no alternative but to
place the Hornbill autopsy sheet in that vague category : Cause of
death unknown ; P.M.D. (Post Mortem Degeneration).
Thus, an incident of exceeding interest had come to an end, and
with no possibility of a repeat performance next year with more
successful results. Yet the event was not without its brighter side, for
at least some additional data, however slight, had been contributed
to a general knowledge of the seldom observed breeding and nesting
habits of hornbills.

By Brian H. Dulanty (Chorley Wood, England)
My main aviary accommodation now consists of a shed 36 feet long,
II feet wide, 6 ft. 6 in. high at the eaves rising to 9 ft. 6 in. at the
ridge. The whole affair is raised 18 inches off the ground. It can
hardly be described as a thing of beauty, but when surrounded by
flights I hope it won't obtrude too much. The interior is divided by
solid partitions into five compartments. The first, 11 feet long, is the
birdroom proper with the usual cages, and the second, 10 feet long,
is fitted with perches and was used as enclosed aviary for Finches, etc.,
during the winter of 1949-50. The remaining 15 feet of the shed is
divided into three shelters.
In the autumn of 1949 I turned a hen Shama into the enclosed
aviary to get her as fit as possible. About this time I obtained a fine
Indo-Chinese cock, which is a bigger bird and has a longer tail than
the Indian. I kept him in a 5 ft. cage in the birdroom until the
beginning of March, when I let him loose with the hen and the other
birds in the aviary. I was a bit nervous about fighting, because in the
two previous years I had found that the pairs fought when first put
together, and I was not sure whether the cock would behave with the
other softbills in the aviary. These included a Wheatear, a Blackcap,
a Redstart, two pairs of Pekin Robins, and a pair of Zosterops, besides
a good number of Waxbills and Grassfinches. I never saw any sign
of aggression by the Shamas. The cock certainly was allowed to have
first go at the maggots when the dish was filled, but when I threw

a small handful of mealworms on the floor all the softbills usually
managed to secure one or more each.
This aviary was heated, as it was used as winter quarters for the
more delicate birds and those not fully acclimatized, but no nest-boxes
were provided. On a shelf made of a piece of asbestos sheeting I kept
an old dried milk tin into which I now and again put a few maggots.
The shelf was over an oil lamp and the smaller softbills seemed to
enjoy the resulting flies. Soon after the cock was turned out I saw
him on several occasions get right into the tin so that all that could
be seen of him was his long tail sticking up. After the first day or two
he then started to sing when in this curious position. The song was
really magnificent, intense and seductive. Even I could see that he
was trying to persuade the hen to nest there. Beyond enjoying the
music I didn't pay much attention to all these goings on as it was still
cold and far too early to think seriously about breeding. I then saw
the hen paying visits to the nest and picking up bits of fibre from the
granulated peat on the floor of the aviary. The next thing I knew
she had laid an egg, followed by four or five more. Having read that
Shama's eggs are frequently infertile I again did not think much of it,
but lo, all hatched ! All this time the aviary had its full complement
of other birds, and for the first three days after the first hatched I had
no time to shift the others. I then moved the rest into the next
compartment. By this time I had built a small outside flight 9 feet by
3 feet by 8 feet high. As soon as the others had been moved I opened
the doors and let out both Shamas. The hen returned a couple of
times with something in her beak, but then while both were out
a heavy storm broke out. I could see that the hen was soon so
saturated that she could scarcely fly. I could not find the cock at all
and thought he had strayed. I tried hand-feeding, but beyond getting
the insides of one or two mealworms into the young I did not have
much success. About four hours after her last visit I saw the cock
return, soon followed by the hen. She at once went on to the nest,
and all seemed to go along smoothly again. I should have said that
the last two youngsters both died soon after hatching. The other three
lived for seven days from the date the first hatched. I had noticed
that the cock, after the first two days, did not help at all in the feeding
but spent all his time in the surrounding hedges and trees singing with
great abandon. On the seventh day the hen deserted and the young,
as I have said, died. Two days later the hen laid again, so that I had
little doubt but that the cock was the cause of all the trouble. The
first two eggs hatched on a Friday and the next two on the Saturday.
I had left the cock with the hen and let him out every day, chiefly to
give myself the pleasure of hearing his song, which seemed to me to
be far finer at liberty than in the aviary. The hen would go out into
the garden and surrounding woods for short intervals but was never

off the nest for more than about ten minutes. On the Sunday I heard
the cock singing with all his might and then caught a glimpse of him
chasing the hen while still singing. On his return I caught him up
and caged him. The hen fed the young, all four of them obviously
growing much faster than the first nest. She would go off and bring
back something which looked to me like a small worm, give it to one
youngster and then give each of the others a mealworm or occasionally
a maggot. Both the mealworm and maggot dishes were kept full the
whole time. It surprised me to see the hen using a mealworm which
I judged to be about the same length as the newly hatched chick, i
Unfortunately, just as the first left the nest, the youngest (or smallest)
developed an eye infection and died. One more left the nest, but all
four eventually died.
The next tragedy was the death of the hen by drowning in a water-
butt. When the first youngster left the nest, I had removed the large
but shallow bath, as I had once lost a young Finch through drowning
in a similar one. The day after the last youngster died the door of
the outside aviary blew open and the hen got out and tried to have
a bath in the water-butt.
Two or three weeks before this I had obtained two more hen
Shamas, one of which was in fair condition although newly imported.
I turned her into the same aviary with the same cock, having renewed
all perches and generally done my best to disinfect the aviary. She
sparred a bit with the cock but soon settled down and built, and laid
five eggs in a budgerigar box with the top half of the front removed.
The cock was caged when she had been sitting for about a week.
This time all five left the nest and seemed likely to be fully reared.
Alas, I trod on one and two others injured themselves flying against
the wooden walls of the aviary. I caught up the remaining two and
caged them with the hen. Both were later put into another outdoor
aviary when they could feed themselves. One unfortunately died of
apparently the same eye trouble and the other is now with one of our
members.
The faeces are swallowed for the first few days and then carried
away. So far as I could see the second hen always dropped them on,
of all places, the coke heap. Mrs. Werner, who bred them in Ireland
before the war, told me that hers always tried to use her hall as a
depository. I noticed that three days after the young had flown from
the last two nests the hen started to lay again but, of course, those
eggs were infertile as the cock had previously been caged. All the
other eggs were fertile.
The two started to fight, or at any rate bicker, when they began
to moult, so I caged them up separately. I entered the cock for the
National Exhibition at Olympia as both these birds are I think wild
caught, and I have foun^ that shows are an excellent method of

steadying nervous birds. Both, of course, take mealworms from the
hand, but equally a sudden movement or a stranger startles them
unduly. Shortly before the show I was washing all the cages in the
birdroom and these two got out. The cock at once went for another
cock in a cage, and the hen tried to do the same to a second hen.
As they did not attempt to fight each other I put them in the same
cage, and eventually showed the pair. They certainly kept out of the
way as much as possible in a biggish show cage, but I am glad to
say are now much steadier. Mr. Indge tells me that having had
several consignments of both cocks and hens and being short of room,
he decided to try putting pairs together. In early January of this year
I saw at least six pairs of Shamas in his birdroom all agreeing perfectly.
Probably, like the English Robin, they pair up some considerable
time before they nest.
Even though the final results were so meagre, I was very pleased
with myself and my birds, thinking that I was probably the only
breeder of Shamas in this country since the war. I have since met
someone who successfully reared four. He also used the semi-liberty
method, but the aviary consisted only of a 6 feet by 3 feet by 6 feet high
open wire flight with no shelter. He has twelve of these small aviaries
in a suburb quite close to the centre of London, and has successfully
bred several softbills and many finches, including Gouldians, which
in particular are generally thought to require some shelter.
The Pekin Robins, as I mentioned before, were with a motley crew
of softbills and finches and were put into the next shelter compartment
to the Shamas soon after a flight 18 feet square and 8 feet high was
added. This was planted round the sides with common and Portuguese
laurels or standard lilacs and apple trees. The Pekins soon built a
rather flimsy nest in a laurel and laid two eggs. Both cock and hen
sat, the cock, as might be expected, taking the shorter daylight trick.
Unlike the hen, he was remarkably steady while sitting and would
allow me and an occasional stranger to approach within 3 or 4 feet.
Just before the eggs were due to hatch one side of the nest collapsed
and deposited two fertile eggs on the ground.
They repaired the nest and laid again, but this time the collapse
occurred after only a few days. I had on both occasions seen what
was coming and tried to stitch up the nest, as described by some
old-timers, but obviously am not the needleman they were. A pair
of Chestnut-breasted Finches built on the foundations, or what was
left of them, but it was an unlucky site and I found one of them dead
on five fertile eggs. The worst of that was that I could tell that one
differed from the other in life, but I could not tell whether it was
the cock or hen which died.
To get back to the Pekins, I next shaped some bits of wire-netting
into rough cups and put one in each laurel bush, fitting a sort of

amateur man-made nest into the cavity. The Pekins carefully and
swiftly removed all the hay from all these nests, but after a week or
two, rather to my own surprise, they did build in one of these
receptacles. Again two eggs were laid but only one was fertile and
hatched out. I was a bit bothered about feeding since there were
still a good many pairs of Waxbills and Grassfinches of one sort and
another, besides a Wheatear, Blackcap and Blue-headed Rock Thrush,
all cocks. A large number of the birds which had wintered with the
Pekins had been moved to other aviaries, but this was still somewhat
overcrowded and all would take maggots and, even more so, meal-
worms. I kept up the supply of maggots as usual, but each morning
and evening threw a good handful of mealworms on to the grass lawn
in the centre of the flight. I knew that if I put the worms in a dish
the Rock Thrush would have fought off allcomers until he had gorged
himself, and the Wheatear would have followed suit. When thrown
down, however, the cock Pekin in particular would bolt two or three
himself, fill his beak to capacity, and in a very short time, having fed
the lot to the youngster, come back for a second helping. His speed
was amazing, and the hen was not far behind.
I kept no diary, but one morning I had a look at the youngster,
but when that evening I went to the nest to show the youngster to
a visitor, it had disappeared. I assumed that the parents had thrown
it out or eaten it, or it had otherwise come to an unfortunate end,
because when I looked at it that morning it certainly did not seem to
me to have the right amount of feathers for a young bird to sally
forth into the world. I kept up the maggot supply but cut down
severely on mealworms until about ten days later I heard the
unmistakable noise of a young bird being fed, although I could not
identify it. A search of a bush to which the Pekins seemed to be
paying rather frequent visits revealed a plump well-grown young
Pekin--now I can't tell the difference between the four adults and
the British born.
In this aviary there were several pairs of Waxbills, Grassfinches,
and odd birds. Firefinches reared two or three broods in an ordinary
budgerigar box; Red Avadavats built a flimsy nest in a small
Portuguese laurel and reared three ; Zebras reared an odd one or
two ; Longtail Grassfinches nested and laid in a box similar to that
used by the Firefinches, but their eggs disappeared. During the winter
Diamond Doves laid on the shelf over the lamp to which I have
referred, but both eggs quickly vanished, so that I am inclined to
think that Pekins do take eggs. On the other hand, I have missed
eggs in aviaries where there were no Pekins, and there were several
successful nests. Pekins do, however, have a very irritating habit of
stealing nesting material from other nests, even if there is plenty of
the same sort lying about.

Apart from the Pekins, the most interesting nest in that aviary was
that of Orange-cheeked Waxbills. Common as they are, the only
account in the Avicultural Magazine which I know of is that by
the late Miss Rosie Alderson, in 1902 ( 1 st Series, Vol. 8, p. 36), for
which she was awarded the Society's medal.
In the first place, as we all know, these birds are none too easy to
sex. My pair could not be distinguished, so far as I could see, by the
orange marking on the ear coverts, but there was a very distinct
difference in the same colour on the rump. The birds are so small
that it is difficult to compare them when held in the hand, but in
a cage or a small aviary the difference in this respect can easily be
seen when they perch on the front wire. At first my pair tried hard
to build in an ordinary budgerigar nest-box, but they would select
very long pieces of hay which, sticking well out of the hole, were a
temptation which the Pekins could not resist. Each time a Pekin
gave a good hard tug to free such a piece, several more were apt to
be dislodged at the same time. After a few weeks of this they
abandoned that box and took to the long grass in a corner of the
aviary, which escaped the weekly mowing owing to the difficulty of
manoeuvring the mower. They built a large untidy nest and laid.
I did not expect much as another pair had built, but not laid with
me, the previous year, and Mr. Murray, of Brentwood, had nests
and eggs from several pairs the same year, which did not hatch.
Another good reason for pessimism was that during incubation period
and after we had several severe thunderstorms. I noticed that the
parents still seemed to hang about that corner and when I put my
finger in the nest I felt several warm little bodies. I am bound to
say the nest was distinctly damp, but not nearly so bad as I had
expected.
The parents took soaked millet sprays and small grass screenings
for preference among seeds but, like all Waxbills, their first choice
was maggots. They would tackle a mealworm, but seldom got the
chance to get more than one at a sitting because of all the others in
the aviary.
The five young left the nest in the fullness of time and seemed to
me to look even more juvenile than most Waxbills. They had the
usual black beaks, but lacked the orange cheeks of the adults. They
flicked their absurdly short tails as frequently and as energetically as
do the adults, but the very shortness gave the action a comic look.
The parents went to nest again in the original box, but this time
two clutches of eggs disappeared.
I mentioned before that there was an odd cock Wheatear in this
aviary. Originally there was a pair, but the cock killed the hen early
in March. I should, of course, have removed her, but at the time
simply had no spare cage or aviary to put her in. The cock was

undergoing a heavy moult at the time and could hardly fly, so that
I hoped the hen would be able to keep out of harm's way.
The next compartment, with a shelter 11 feet by 5 feet and a flight
18 feet by 10 feet by 8 feet high, was occupied by pairs of Spreos,
Virginian, and Red-crested Cardinals, and a pair of Indigo Buntings
which had attacked Blue-breasted Waxbills which occupied the only
other available aviaries. I feared for the Indigos, as the Spreos (I think)
slayed an Orange-headed Ground Thrush almost as soon as it was
turned into the aviary. However, the Indigos did and still do flourish
in the company of such members of the heavy brigade, but made no
attempt to nest ; they were always on view at the front of the aviary
and the Spreos and Red-crested Cardinals were generally close at
hand. The Virginians always retired in a hurry to the shelter as soon
as anyone, including myself, came anywhere near the aviary ; most
annoying, particularly as several United States citizens visited us that
summer. Like most people, they could recognize what they call the
Red Bird, if not the little Indigo.
Soon after they were turned out the hen Spreo started coughing
and sneezing. Having tried all over London to get the remedy first
recommended for this complaint by Mr. Delacour, viz. Aniodol
Interne, I sent an S.O.S. to Mr. Fooks, at Cleres. He sent me a bottle
by return, and a few drops on two or three days cured her completely.
I have since found that Messrs. Wilcox, Jozeau, and Co., Ltd., of
74-77 White Lion Street, London, N. 1, are prepared to obtain not
less than three bottles from the makers and to deliver them in England.
The cost for three is something under # 1 , and worth every penny if
you keep Starlings.
As most people know, the plumage of these Starlings is identical in
both sexes, but I can tell my pair quite easily. In the first place the
cock is a good deal bigger than the hen and his eye is much more
brilliant. Then, again, both sexes chatter and squeal, but the cock is
far noisier than the hen. At first I thought that the difference in size
and brightness of eye might be accounted for by differences in age.
When I put in a nest-box the cock put his sex beyond doubt by
sticking his head into it at once, at the same time making enough
noise to raise its roof. The hen, though interested, remained almost
silent. The cock then and for days after carried what seemed to me
to be cartloads of hay and sticks into the nest. One or other of them
must have discarded a good deal of this material as I later found that
the nest had a well-made tunnel from the entrance hole to the nest
cavity proper. The box was an old Grass Parrakeet box, about 18 inches
high and 8 inches wide and deep. Two eggs were laid, but only one
hatched. The other birds were taken out when this happened and
the youngster was reared on unlimited maggots and a lesser supply of
mealworms, which were given in a dish morning and night. As in the

case of the Pekins, I was surprised to see how many mealworms could
be pushed into the baby. Even a day or so after hatching I reckoned
that at least a couple of dozen were fed within a space of five minutes.
The cock did not brood but did a fair share of the feeding. Both
birds were very shy, the hen coming off the nest whenever she heard
anyone coming. When they were feeding the young they would never
go into the box if they could see any human in the vicinity, even if
their beaks were full of mealworms for all the world to see.
When the youngster left the nest it had the same arrangement of
colours as the old birds, but it lacked the white band on the chest
and its eyes were black. The aviary had a few bushes in it but could
not be said to be thickly planted, nevertheless it was extraordinarily
difficult to spot the young bird from a distance of only a foot or so.
Six months after leaving the nest it had its first moult and is now as
glossy as the adults, but the eyes are still black. I caged it up for the
winter and it is a most amusing addition to the birdroom. When it
has eaten two or three mealworms it then goes all round the cage
poking another into a crevice or corner in much the same way as
a Magpie, but after a minute or so, and before the unfortunate worm
can escape, seizes it again and repeats the performance somewhere
else.
The parents are still out with no heat, and I have seen them visiting
the nest-box while the aviary was still covered in snow. Now they
have moulted the cock seems to be distinctly glossier than the hen.
The next compartment and flight of approximately equal dimensions
to that occupied by the Spreos contained one pair each of Longtail
Grassfinches, Parrot Finches, Grey-singers, Cubans, Firefinches,
Orange-breasted and Blue-breasted Waxbills. They were not put out
until July as the flight was not finished until then. The Firefinches
and Cubans both reared young, using cylinders of wire netting roofed
with a scrap of roofing felt and shoved into standard lilacs and apple
trees. The Parrot Finches laid, but the hen died on the nest.
Curiously enough the hen Cuban took a violent dislike to the Parrot
Finches and would not let them go into the outside flight. I have
never found Cubans at all quarrelsome before, but she was evidently
an exception.
My other large flight (24 feet by 18 feet by 6 ft. 6 in. at the sides
rising to 9 ft. 6 in. at the ridge) contained the following Waxbills :

more, but I cannot now remember, so that the aviary, large though
it is, could not be said to be underpopulated. It is planted along both
the long sides and the back, and on a hot summer afternoon there
was frequently not a bird to be seen.
The only serious fighting occurred between the Redstarts, which, as
in the case of the Wheatears, resulted in the death of the hen. Having
read that the cock was apt to slay his wife, I took a good deal of care
in introducing the pair to each other, keeping first the hen and then
the cock caged in an aviary, letting the other have the run of it.
After a few short and swift skirmishes when first put into this aviary,
each selected one end of the aviary and kept to it, so that I thought
my troubles were over, only to find about three weeks later the hen
with a severely damaged head, which was obviously the cause of death.
Like most pairs on the show bench, this pair were hand-reared and
had been kept together in a cage before I bought them. I think this
goes to show that small softbills which are solitary in the wild do not
attain full vigour when kept in cages, although they may look in good
condition and sing well. I think that great breeder of softbills,
Teschemaker, was undoubtedly right when he said that it was
virtually impossible to breed small insectivorous birds unless they were
wild caught, particularly the hen. Nowadays it is almost impossible
to obtain wild caught birds and even if one is lucky, their digestions
have probably been ruined by being deprived of maggots, mealworms,
etc., and fed upon " soft food " alone, as Teschemaker also found in
his day.
If I may be allowed to continue to digress on this subject, I should
like to add that several aviculturists of to-day have confessed to
doubts about the truth of some of the breeding claims made by
Teschemaker. Certainly the list is a very long one and in no case
did he ever give full details of the feeding. Mr. Frost, the well-known
collector, has told me that he used to buy from Teschemaker young
aviary bred foreign softbills, but although he saw plenty of young
British softbills in the aviaries, he was never allowed to buy them as
these were always liberated.
To get back to my own aviary, the biggest draw among visitors,
especially children, were the young Quail. In an aviary of this size
it was not always easy to get them to show themselves, as the parents
nearly always kept themselves and their family under the bushes.
The first two nests were both reared quite easily on fresh wood ants 5
eggs as purchased, which were thrown down twice daily, and small
grass seed screenings, maw, and millet seed. When the chicks, which
grow extraordinarily quickly, were a few days old the parents would
take maggots and offer them to the chicks, who accepted them
greedily. Our member, Mr. Enehjelm, of Finland, tells me he has
reared them in an indoor birdroom using hard-boiled egg instead of

ants' eggs. My birds certainly had to scramble for the ants' eggs as
all the other birds tried to grab their share. I found the easiest way
to deal with this was to stand about a yard away from the Quail,
which kept off all others except those with young, who would overcome
their natural timidity after a few false starts. I left the young with
the parents because after about five weeks or so it was almost impossible
to distinguish them. The third clutch of six hatched, but as the chicks
themselves could not differentiate between their parents and elder
brothers and sisters, they would run for warmth to the nearest Quail
which, unless it happened to be papa or mama, would have nothing
to do with them. All died after two or three days.
In the long grass under the bushes the St. Helenas built a large
nest which survived several severe storms. After the first they nested
three or four times but never reared. Why, I don't know.
The cock Yellow-rumped Singing Finch was imported but the hen
was aviary-bred, the only one reared in the same aviary the previous
year. They built in a cup-shaped receptacle made of wire netting
and placed high up in a cherry tree. They had innumerable nests
and eggs, most of which hatched, but only one nest came to anything.
In this they behaved exactly as their predecessors had done. They
would take some of all the different foods provided, but seemed to
think that flying insects are essential for the rearing of young. The
only other account I have read of the breeding of these delightful
songsters is that of Teschemaker in 1907 (New Series, Vol. V,
p. 198). He also attributed his success to gnats and the like. Soon
after, Dr. Butler, that singularly unsuccessful breeder, gave it as his
opinion that insects were not necessary to rear these or other Finches.
As I have indicated, I emphatically disagree. I know that quite a
few breeders of Australian Finches have reared numbers of these birds
without any live food. On the other hand, the only seed-eaters which
I have bred and which refused to touch any live food were Gouldians,
and even then the young, when placed in a large cage with Parrot
Finches, soon developed such a keen appetite for maggots that they
were always first down when the dish was filled. Unfortunately, all
that lot of young Gouldians caught a cough from another bird and
died before I could try them as breeders.
Except for the Quail and the Singing Finches I was amused to see
how all the other youngsters as soon as they left the nest were enticed
by their parents into the shelter, which is very small, being only about
5 feet long by 6 feet high and 2 ft. 6 in. deep.
The other great attraction in this aviary was the Blue Flycatchers.
Not only are they magnificently coloured, with their vivid blue plumage
set off with pure white underneath, but their flight in a large flight
is a great joy to watch, being so swift and graceful. They also have
quite a pleasant song, rather reminiscent of the Robin. They are

quite inoffensive either to each other or to other birds. They are so
tame that they are almost a nuisance, perching on the hand or head
or any other convenient part of the human body.
I showed one of these at the National, gaining a second prize to
the Lesser Niltavas, which were judged best Foreign Bird in Show.
With all respect to the eminent judges, Allan Silver and K. A. Norris,
I should, I think, have preferred the Japanese bird to the Niltavas,
not, of course, that I am complaining.
Parrakeets made a very poor showing in 1950, the only young
reared being four Golden-mantled Rosellas. The Princess of Wales
as usual smashed all their eggs, the Many colours hatched but failed
to rear, and the Mealy Rosellas were infertile. The latter result was
surprising as these birds have been at semi-liberty for two years. They
are a beautiful sight flying around the beechwoods and swooping
down so swiftly and expertly on to the aviaries. The cock later
developed a passion for some Peachfaced Lovebirds and was
constantly to be seen feeding both old and young through the wire.
As the Peachfaced reared five in two nests I did not complain. I did
object when the cock Golden-mantled escaped just after his young
had hatched, and was promptly driven off by the Mealy. As the
Golden-mantled had been at liberty before I had no doubt as to
the reason for his departure. It only made it worse when a neighbour
in a cottage about half a mile away told me that he had hung about
there for a day or two. Being used to receiving visits from some of
my birds, he naturally did not realize the true state of affairs.
In one compartment of a range of four small aviaries (each 15 feet
by 3 ft. 6 in. by 6 ft. 6 in. high) a pair of Parson Finches reared six
youngsters, as did their companions, a pair of Fawn Zebras. While
the Parsons were certainly the bosses, they did not unduly disturb
the Zebras. Next door were a pair of Parrot Finches and a pair of
Quail. The latter hatched three chicks, which were reared by the
hen alone as the cock died. As a rule the cock seems to do most of
the rearing of the young, but apparently the hen will do what is
necessary if she has to. The Parrot Finches were unfortunate, as all
their efforts came to nothing, chiefly due to a succession of accidents,
most, if not all, of which were attributable to human error. For
instance, the door between the two aviaries blew open so the gardener
thoughtfully shut it, not realizing that the Parrot Finches were both
in the wrong aviary. Being late home that night I did not see what
had happened until the next morning. The other two divisions held
a pair of Shamas and a pair of Red-collared Lorrikeets, neither of
which made any attempt to nest.
The last range of six small breeding aviaries (each about 12 feet long
by 2 ft. 8 in. by 6 feet high) contained besides the Peachfaced Love-
birds, Hecks and normal Longtail Grassfinches, Ruficaudas, Fawn

and White Zebras, and Bengalese. All did pretty well and reared
a good number of young.
In conclusion, I tried at liberty a few pairs of Waxbills--Cordon
Bleus, Orangecheeks, and Firefinches. I put them out in a small
aviary, but except for an odd bird or two could not persuade any of
them to return to it after the door had been opened. I tried feeding
them on a path and it seemed to work well until the discovery of an
easy meal by the Sparrows, from which nuisances this rather deserted
cottage has in the past been singularly free. I built a rough cage of
1 in. mesh wire netting and put the seed in it. This for a time had
the desired effect of allowing the Waxbills to feed while foiling the
Sparrows. If the Waxbills were startled when feeding they had some
difficulty in getting out and so became too panicky. After a few days
most of them disappeared. I caught up the remainder and will not
repeat the experiment, as one sees so little of these small birds with
all the cover round here. I still have the wretched Sparrows !

By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, England)
My aviary attendant asked me the other day if I had ever noticed
" the human side " of the social life of the inhabitants of the homing
budgerigar aviary and I replied that I certainly had ! By " the human
side " he meant their romances, their quarrels, and their frequent
and disgraceful scandals. A cynical aviculturist once said that
whereas most parrakeets are immensely respectable, mating for life
and being extremely faithful to their partners, Budgerigars are com-
pletely " human 55 in that none of the males have any morals and only
a certain number of the females ! Whether this sweeping condemna-
tion of humanity is justified I leave to my readers to judge, but alas !
it is all too true of Budgerigars. Take, for example, a yellow-winged
green cock called, for obvious reasons, Don Juan. (I decline to describe
him as a " clearwing " because his wings are not clear, being marked,
as are those of most " clearwings " I have seen, with green.) By
profession he is a " non-exit ", i.e. he does not trouble to leave the
aviary by the exit hole, probably because he finds too much to occupy
his attention inside. He is a handsome bird and, for a breeding
Budgerigar, a tame one and will sit on my hand to eat spray millet,
but, where the ladies are concerned, he is a sad rascal. Few hens are
able to resist him and fewer still are not given the opportunity of
showing whether they wish to try ! (This no doubt explains why my
homing flock contains a high percentage of not very good-coloured
yellows, for a yellow-winged green is not a desirable cross if yellows
of buttercup purity are desired.) Don Juan has never had less than
two wives plus a certain number of lady friends who are officially

married to other cocks. He started off last year with two yellow hens,
both of which produced, in addition to yellows of various shades,
a good number of lutinos. From this I judge Don Juan to be a split
lutino. One of Don Juan's wives met with a fatal accident last
summer but when the breeding hens were returned to the liberty
aviary in early March, 1951, for a time he took up with the other one.
Unfortunately, however, she suffered from a complaint not uncommon
in hen Budgerigars, an excess of house pride combined with an unusual
degree of incapacity to make up her mind. She simply could not
decide whether she wanted a nest on the north side of the aviary or
one on the south. Don Juan got fed up with her havering. Up to
a point I could not blame him, but the action he took was a bit drastic.
He completely deserted his yellow wife, not merely for another hen,
but for two others--a new white blue and a homing sea-green. The
deserted yellow consoled herself with the best young cock I bred in
r 95*--a yellow-faced clearwing white cobalt who should have been
a homer as he had flown at liberty for a short time when a youngster.
Unluckily, however, not then knowing that while you can confine
homing hens for long periods without risk, you must leave homing
cocks at liberty, I caught him up early in the autumn and kept him
shut up in an aviary for the winter. For a time the clearwing and the
yellow hen were a happy and devoted couple and she was on the point
of laying when I opened the exit hole which I had kept closed for a
few weeks to allow one or two fresh birds I had bought in order to
introduce new colours, to settle. The moment the exit hole was
opened the clearwing was out and off like a scalded cat and was never
seen again and with him went a sea-green cock who had been treated
in a similar way and a newly-purchased albino cock. A little yellowish-
green hen who was another member of the misguided party returned
next day. She was one of a brood of second-generation homers whom
I nicknamed " the Emperor Penguins ". Reared amid the frosts and
snows of a most inclement winter, she herself, eight weeks after leaving
the nest, laid amid the frosts and snows of an equally inclement
spring and has brought up a healthy family. All this, of course, is
most immoral from the standpoint of orthodox methods of Budgerigar
breeding but I have found in practice that to allow young Budgerigars
bred early in the season to rear one brood as soon as they want to
does no harm to parents or offspring if the building up of a homing
strain be your object.
The yellow hen took her second marital disappointment very hard,
as indeed, poor thing, she well might and spent her time either inside
her nest or on the perch outside brooding, not on eggs but on the
injustices of life and the frailties and follies of the male sex. Admirers
who made proposals of marriage to her she snubbed, including the
yellow cock who was the most persevering. Finally a day came when

<bodyText confidence="0.998464044444444" page_id="56288231"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
she could endure her disappointment and the contemplation of the
infidelities of her first husband no longer. Though a "non-exit" and not
a homer, I saw her make a dash for the exit hole, climb on to the roof
of the aviary, and fly away. Evening came and she had not returned
and I quite thought that she had decided to leave for ever the scene
of so many painful memories. The following morning, however, she
returned. In the case of those suffering from wounded affection
a complete change of scene is usually recommended and it would
appear that the remedy works as well with Budgerigars as with human
beings. It was at once apparent that the yellow hen was in a happier
frame of mind as a result of her trip. She was much kinder to the
yellow cock and indeed decided to marry him next day and the
marriage has been a great success. He is no erratic fool, like the
yellow-faced cock, but a proved and trusty homer who has flown at
liberty ever since he left the nest. He is also much attached to his mate
and never looks at another hen when she is actually in sight--and
that is as much as any Budgerigar wife can reasonably expect of her
husband ! There was still a bit of trouble left, however, a legacy from
the yellow hen's past misfortunes. A bird's reproductive anatomy is
curiously linked with its mental state. The yellow hen had had two
mental shocks when on the point of laying and now, although once
more happily married, in spite of the fact that she had been most
prolific in 1950, not an egg could she lay ! Weeks passed by ; she
tried one nest-box and she tried another but still nothing happened
and it was not until the middle of May, more than six weeks after
her return to the breeding aviary, that eggs at last appeared.
The entry of Don Juan's daughter, a homing lutino, into the society
of the breeding aviary was of a decidedly meteoric description. I put
her in some weeks after the first lot of hens as there were still some
spare nest-boxes and one or two unmated cocks and I hoped her
introduction would not cause too much of a disturbance. Directly she
was released from the catching net half the cocks in the aviary lost their
hearts to the golden vision and proposed to her, regardless of whether
they were already married or not. Without a moment's hesitation
she mated with a yellow cock who happened to be the nearest thing
with a blue cere (the Budgerigar equivalent for " in trousers ") within
reach. Immediately after she threw him over for a mauve cock with
whom she did a round of inspection of the nest-boxes, a proceeding of
which the married ladies already in possession of some of them took
a very dim view indeed. Growing tired of the mauve, she next had
a flirtation with a white cobalt who apparently assured her that he
admired lutinos above everything else--which may have been true,
as he had a lutino wife already sitting, a fact which, no doubt, he
omitted to mention !

dashed out of the exit hole and was off for a tour round the countryside.
As she had not turned up by the evening I was beginning to fear
that she, too, had strayed, but the homing blood told and when I
went to the aviary first thing next morning she was back and sitting
outside a nest-box of her own, leaving it every now and then to
torment her mother on one side and her father's new wife on the other,
by putting her head in at the front door and offering unwanted
advice on the running of their homes ! A little later she married her
first boy friend, the yellow cock and settled down to a domestic life of,
I hope, comparative respectability. (I have noticed that an unmated
hen Budgerigar commonly selects her nest-box before she selects her
husband, rather as a migrating British warbler selects his territory
before he acquires his hen.)
The distressing scandal of the opaline cobalt widow provided the
next " human " incident. The opaline cobalt was mated to a new
violet cock who proved a non-exit, her nearest neighbours being a
green cock and his white cobalt wife. The violet cock unhappily died
of aspergillosis. Next day his widow who, like some other ladies no
longer in their first youth who are determined not to remain widows,
combined an extensive knowledge of the weaknesses of the opposite
sex with a distressing lack of principle, simply threw herself at the
green cock's head. He succumbed to her blandishments immediately
and his poor wife sitting on the perch outside her home with that fixed
expression on her face which hen Budgerigars assume when con-
templating the behaviour of other members of their species of which
they particularly disapprove, had to witness a most disgraceful
flirtation. It has been observed that evildoers commonly grow to
hate those whom they wronged. After enduring for several hours the
disapproving glances of the injured wife the widow lost her temper
and flew at her. The two fell to the ground with a flop locked in
mortal combat while all the cocks in the aviary, as is their custom
when two hens have a battle royal, collected round in an excited
circle to watch the fun and lay odds on the winner. At this point,
however, I decided that it was high time to interfere and told the
aviary attendant to remove the widow to another aviary. This he
did, receiving in the process such a bite as caused him to express lively
sympathy for the white cobalt hen. This, however, was not the end
of the incident. Nemesis awaited the green cock for one of Don Juan's
sons, although he had a wife of his own already, decided that he
would like the green cock's wife as well. To this arrangement the white
cobalt hen, influenced no doubt by the way her husband had treated
her, seemed not particularly averse, so the green cock lost both the
widow and his lawful mate which, it must be confessed, was no more
than he deserved !

The first breeding in captivity of a species, especially if it is a first
American importation, is a fascinating achievement and one that does
not occur too frequently. In our Parrot department, which is
certainly one of the best in the country, we have a fine collection
from every part of the world, and we have a gratifying number of
first records, all of which have been written up in this magazine at
one time or another.
This lengthy preamble brings us to the latest, and also a first,
record for America, namely the successful breeding of the Goldie's
Lorikeet. This little bird, whose native habitat is New Guinea, is
about 7 inches long. It is mainly bright green with longitudinal
streaks of yellow on the neck and underparts. The head is purplish
with a bright red crown. The bill is black. When I first saw them
in the wonderful Zoo at Taronga Park, in Sydney, Australia, in 1949,
it was my impression that they were the native Varied Lorikeets ;
but the latter species has a red bill though somewhat similar in
coloration. Both birds are of the same genus, Psitteuteles.
We received three of these birds from Australia in October, 1949,
possibly two males and one female. The difference, if any, is too
slight to distinguish them apart. We put nest boxes, partly filled with
peat moss and earth, in the large wall cage they occupy during our
cold season from October to May, but beyond casual inspection of
the nest-boxes, there was nothing to report.
In May they were put outdoors in one of our regular breeding
runs--which measure 6 feet by 25 feet by 7 feet high. While they
enjoyed the flight space and were very affectionate to one another
and two seemed to be together much of the time, there still was no
mating activity. Owing to a sudden cold wave they were brought
indoors on 25th September. These three birds and a pair of Little
Lorikeets (Glossopsitta pusilld) from Australia all occupied a wall cage
which had three nest-boxes. The Little Lorikeets were kept during
the summer in a large breeding run with a number of Australian
and African Finches but we have nothing to report on them. In
December, 1950, we saw indications of mating interest, and two of
the Goldie's Lorikeets spent much time in one of the boxes while the
third bird occupied another box across from them. Early in February
our Parrot man, Rudy, reported hearing sounds from the box. They
were faint, sibilant noises, and our hopes soared. About the middle
of the month one of the birds, probably the male (he did have a little

more red on his crown), was often seen to be feeding the female ; he
also often fed the third bird. Around this time one of the Little
Lorikeets was often on the perch in front of the nest hole. It would
seem to be peering inside and appeared to be much interested. These
occasions always were when the parents were down below feeding on
the liquid food (Mellin's Food, honey, and evaporated milk in water)
or on the grapes, bananas or oranges When one of the parents flew
up again, the inquisitive one flew away.
Later in the month when Rudy went in the cage to wash the walls
the female would fly at his head. We never looked in the nest though
at times a youngster's head appeared in the opening. At this time
the two Little Lorikeets were removed to another cage. Early in
March, 1951, the youngster tried hard enough to get out but was not
encouraged by the parents, who perched near by talking to it in
Lorikeet language. The young bird was, of course, smaller and a little
duller in colour with some fuzz on the nape. Finally, on 13th March,
two young birds were out, the elder exploring all over the wires
while the younger went in and out. Later on that day the third of
the trio of old birds was seen annoying the youngsters so it, too, was
removed and the family seem to be getting along all right. It is
difficult to estimate the period of incubation and time spent in the
nest. Two young is the usual complement from what we can find out
in the scant information published.
The year 1938 was the first year we started breeding the Parrot-like
birds. The thirty-odd species received from Australia in 1934, the
year the Chicago Zoological Society opened its zoo at Brookfield,
stimulated our ambition to attempt their breeding. We started with
twelve runs, each 6 feet by 25 feet by 7 feet high, but this number
has since been doubled. Since 1938 we have successfully reared the

Besides these there were unsuccessful attempts--eggs not hatching--
of Macaws, Eclectus, Cockatoos, Splendid Parrakeets, etc.
The food for these Lorikeets is the liquid food mixture used for
other Lorikeets and Lories (also Sugar Birds, Sun Birds, and Callistes).
The proportion as follows : one teaspoonful each of Mellin's Food,
honey, and evaporated milk to one cup of hot water. Feed cooled,
of course. Besides this they get banana, grapes, orange, and any
other fruit they will eat. These Lorikeets don't seem to care for seed,
though the Swainson's enjoy Canary seed.

BREEDING RESULTS AT THE KESTON

By Edward Boosey (Keston, England)
The two most interesting events of the 1950 breeding season at
Keston were the successful rearing of broods of Turquoisines and
Pileated Parrakeets, a pair of the latter hatching and rearing a fine
brood of six young ones which very obligingly turned out to be three
pairs, one pair of which we are retaining at Keston while the other
two are now in the Duke of Bedford's collection at Woburn. Originally
the Duke had a young cock and two young hens, as he hoped to be
able to mate the second hen to a male he has had for many years,
but the latter seems nowadays too old to take any interest in breeding
operations, so the second young hen has now been mated to her
brother. It is a pity the old cock is past breeding as he is quite
unrelated to the others and would have provided fresh blood. It would
be redundant to say any more about the breeding of the Pileated as
I have already given a full account in the Magazine.
Three Turquoisines--a pair and an odd cock--arrived here in the
late summer of 1949, and very fortunately the hen went to nest at
once and, even more fortunately, the single young one she reared was
a hen, which I was able to mate to the odd cock, so we started the
1950 breeding season with two pairs.
Between them the two pairs reared seventeen young ones, the
imported pair quickly going to nest and rearing thirteen young in
three broods, while the young hen went to nest later and after rearing
a brood of four young ones lost her second brood of four owing to
unseasonably early frosts in September just as she had ceased to brood
them.
A pair of Splendid Grass Parrakeets were a disappointment because
although the hen quickly went to nest, and hatched two broods, she
apparently only did so in order to have the sadistic pleasure of

watching them starve to death, as she never attempted to feed them.
I managed to put her third clutch of three eggs under Bourkes, and
all three were hatched and fully reared into very nice young ones.
The pair of Bourkes were a mystery to me because although the
supposed cock did a cock's display and had a rather masculine-shaped
head it had not a vestige of blue on the forehead and seemed quite
incapable of either laying eggs or fertilizing them. Male Bourkes often
have very little blue on the forehead, but a close examination nearly
always reveals one or two blue feathers.
Several nice young Elegants were reared, and we now have three
pairs of these Grass Parrakeets whose lovely golden green colour
I have always admired. They are good breeders but tend to have
rather small broods, and they are the only Grass Parrakeets we
managed to keep going all through the war years, although it is fair
to say that we sent our breeding stock of Splendids away to a safer
area as soon as war broke out, and I doubt if there were any survivors
by the time the war finally ended.
All the " Old Faithfulls "--Rosellas, Stanleys, Mealy Rosellas,
Redrumps (both green and yellow), Lutino and Lutino-bred Ring-
necks, Roseate Cockatoos, Gockatiels, Masked and Fischers Lovebirds,
etc., mostly did well and it interested me that the fact that some of
the Broadtails were once more double-brooded--as they used to be
before the war--coincided with one's being again able to obtain
hemp seed.
A male Lutino Ringneck, mated to a Lutino-bred hen, produced
two greens and one Lutino, and a Lutino hen mated to a Lutino-bred
cock reared a fine brood of three Lutinos and two greens. Hybrid
Lutino Ringneck X Alexandrines bred here did not breed, though
I hope they, and a hybrid cock--with Lutino blood--mated to an
ordinary hen Alexandrine, may do so next year.
A hen Blue-fronted Amazon, bred here before the war, was provided
with yet another husband (her previous two having proved infertile),
and this time one young one was hatched, but only lived for about
a week.
Several thousand Budgerigars of all colours were bred, and also
a certain number of Diamond Doves and Long-tailed Grassfinches,
the latter, incidentally, rearing their young ones on nothing but seed
and greenfood. Many Common and Silver Zebra Finches were reared
but the fawn variety proved inexpert at rearing their young, and it
was very typical of most people's avicultural experience that, while the
pair of Fawn Zebra Finches (which had always let their own young
ones die) hatched and reared some Silver Zebra Finch eggs that were
foster-parented under them, the Silvers, which were given their eggs
(and had always reared their own) hatched but failed to rear the
young Fawns !

About March we obtained several pairs of Senegal or " Laughing "
Doves, which are about the same size as the Turtle Dove which has
such a pleasant drowsy cooing, and visits this country each year to
breed, and I thought them so attractive that I put two pairs in the
planted aviary near our house. I like very much their colour scheme
of mushroom-pink and slate-blue set off with touches of black and
white, and they also coo very pleasantly, though I think the notion
that they laugh is a bit fanciful.
At first the two pairs did a good deal of scrapping, but eventually
they each established themselves at opposite ends of the aviary, and
both pairs reared numerous young ones, which I sent to Mr. Risdon
at the Dudley Zoo. They were no trouble at all to feed, eating mainly
millet and hemp, and sometimes picking out a little soaked stale
bread from among the house-scraps supplied each morning to a
Tragopan which shared their aviary.
It is perhaps of interest to record that a male Golden Pheasant
which shared an aviary with a couple of hen Golden Sebright bantams
did manage to fertilize at least one egg, and this was duly hatched,
but unfortunately it was overlaid by the rather heavy broody which
was sitting on the eggs, so did not long survive its birth. I was sorry,
as it would have been interesting to have seen what it looked like--*
and also I should have liked to have been able to say that--while
many people declare they have seen Phantoms--I was the first person
ever to breed one !

Emilius Hopkinson, elder son of the late Jonathan and Emily
Elizabeth Hopkinson, of Frant, Sussex, died on 12th June, 19513 in
his 83rd year.
Educated at Haileybury and Trinity College, Oxford, he entered
the medical profession through St. Thomas's Hospital. After service
in South Africa, 1900-1901, as Surgeon-Captain, 15th Battalion
Imperial Yeomanry, where he was mentioned in dispatches and
awarded the D.S.O., and Queen's Medal with four clasps, he com-
menced his service in the Gambia---destined to be the longest period
ever served in West Africa by a British representative from the Colonial
Office. He was Medical Officer, West African Frontier Force,
Gambia, 1901-1902 ; Protectorate Medical Officer, 1903-1911;
and Travelling Commissioner, 1911-1929 : a C.M.G. was conferred
in 1922.
Amongst his more important publications are A Vocabulary of the
Mandingo Language (1912) and Notes on Protectorate Laws , Gambia
(! 925 )-
44 E. H." was a doctor, soldier, and administrator, but we knew him
best as an ornithologist and aviculturist. He was interested in many
learned and scientific societies, but his favourite was undoubtedly the
Avicultural, with which he had a very long association. He was
elected a member in 1906, and a Vice-President in 1924, on amalgama-
tion with the Foreign Bird Club, of which he was already a Vice-
President.
His long absences abroad prevented his indulgence in practical
aviculture to any great extent, but he managed to maintain a small
collection at Balcombe, and bred quite a number of the less difficult
species.
On his annual leaves he invariably brought home a few rare birds,
and the collection of the Zoological Society was considerably enriched
by his presentations.
The Doctor delighted in compiling lists, whether of birds imported,
exhibited, bred, or of other matters connected with them. Much of
his time in England was devoted to accumulating data, later, on his
return to the Gambia, to be correlated, and destined eventually to
appear in Bird Notes or the Avicultural Magazine.
To the ornithologist his best known work is perhaps A List of the
Birds of the Gambia (1919), but to the aviculturist, Records of Birds Bred
in Captivity (1926), the model on which all subsequent lists have been
based.

By G. de Goederen (Amsterdam, Holland)
The Zoological Gardens of Wassenaar are situated some 3 miles
from The Hague and cover approximately 12 hectares (30 acres).
During the last few years I have been a regular visitor to this Zoo, and
it may be of interest to members of the Avicultural Society to know
that it is a private foundation of Mr. P. Louwman, one of the great
bird-lovers in Holland. The whole Zoo is conducted by Mr. Louwman
himself and his general secretary, Mr. W. W. Diedrich.
The situation is ideal, not only from a zoological point of view but
also on account of the beautiful surroundings, and the whole collection
is an important one in this country.
I shall try to describe a part of this collection, but such a description
can be hardly more than an impression and will at best give a poor
idea of the whole.
The Zoo is open to the public at an entrance fee of 2 s., and there
is a well-illustrated guide available for the visitor to the whole property,
the natural surroundings of which are unimaginably beautiful.
The gardens lie in a wood with some ponds and low hills, and all
the animals live in perfect houses and bird-rooms provided with good
natural protection against our capricious climate.
The very excellent labelling on weatherproof copper plates with
details of the inhabitants of the houses and compartments deserves
your attention, and should the weather prove to be bad there is a cosy
cafe. A great part is laid out as a playground for the children. I shall
not describe the collection mentioning the houses separately, because
this would take too much space, but you will find in this Zoo beautiful
specimens of all the animals that every Zoo possesses and also some
rare species.
I must call your attention to two fine chimpanzees reared by Mrs.
Louwman under very difficult circumstances. As I told you, the
animals are living in capacious houses not placed in a row but spread
all over the whole garden. But now I must begin with the description
of the birds which live in the many bird-rooms supervised by Mr.
Louwman and Mr. Diedrich.

In the first place, I would ask my readers to follow me to the largest
pond enclosure, with little islands and surrounded with trees and shrubs.
The inhabitants are as follows :--

and Indian Adjutants, South American Tantalus, White and Black
Storks, as well as Yellow-billed Curassows.
Some Herring Gulls are fully capable of flying, but remain in the
garden, together with a Razorbill which was a victim of oil and after
treatment recovered inasmuch as it now enjoys swimming in the pond
with the ducks.
To left of the pond enclosure you will find a big outdoor aviary
planted with little trees and shrubs and inhabited by the big European
birds, such as Raven, Jackdaws, Magpies, Heron, Bittern, etc.
The whole cage is fully shaded by trees and has a little pond.
Behind this aviary you will see another big outdoor aviary with some
birds of prey, and I saw African White Vulture, King Vulture,
Golden Eagle, and Lammergeier.
After walking along a long row of compartments containing rodents
we arrive at the first set of thickly planted outside flights, and I will
mention some of the inhabitants I can remember :
Princess of Wales's Parrakeets, Swainson's, Edward's, Ornate,
Forsten's, Chattering Lories, Bourke's and Rosellas, Budgerigars and
Lovebirds ( fischeri , nigrigenis , per sonata, roseicollis) , together with
Pheasants such as Lady Amherst, Golden, Impeyan, Swinhoe, Nepal,
White, and Common.
Far behind the large pond enclosure, at right, we find several acres
of land with low hills where Sarus, Manchurian, West African
Crowned Cranes, and other fowl live under excellent conditions
together with deer, etc. I saw also in some outdoor bird-rooms a
Secretary Bird, Kagu, and Rufous-vented Guan.
Then we go to the long row of birds of prey aviaries, and I will
mention the species I remember :--
Spectacled, Tawny, Barn, Eagle, Short-eared, Snowy (since 1934
fern.) Owls, as well as Hobby, Kestrel, Tawny Eagle, Brazilian

Garacara (Polyborus tharus), White-headed Chimachima. One of the
Brazilian Garacaras came from the collection of Mr. Blaauw, where
it had been since 1904. Imperial, Crested (Spizaetus bellicosus ), Golden
(old male), White-tailed Eagles, Black Kite (a pair of Kites bred
successfully during the war and reared two young). Condor, Turkey,
King, Sociable ( Otogyps auricular is ) and Griffon Vultures, and
Lammergeier.
I shall conclude with the big heated indoor bird-house with
rows of cages on both sides. Outside the heated indoor bird-room you
will find two rows of huge open outdoor aviaries 3 * 5 metres wide,
4 metres high, and with a depth of 9 metres, some with little ponds

There are as well four large aviaries with Pied Hornbills, Southern
Kookaburra, Toco Toucans, Green-billed Toucans, Discolor and
Ariel Toucans, and a large cage of glass with Yellow-winged Sugarbirds.
Then I must conclude with the cage of plate-glass built for the
Humming-birds, in which the species are Ruby, Topaz, Allen's,
Emerald. This attractive exhibit is a very popular one with the visitors,
as these tiny creatures are very beautiful birds. The cage is 10 feet
high by 10 feet deep and planted with an assortment of flowers and
plants, producing a beautiful effect. The food bottles are hung in
various positions to give the birds a choice of feeding places ; the
temperature is maintained at 8 o* and the plants are watered daily.
The spectator can see the capturing of fruit flies and the taking of
food from the bottles, and when the Humming-bird comes in front of
him the display of its glittering gorget and crest.
I have tried to give a short description of the Zoological Gardens
of Wassenaar, and hope I have succeeded in giving an impression--be
it a short one--of this beautiful Zoo. I advise all the members who
come to Holland to pay a visit to these Gardens, and I am sure they
will have a good time.

THE DUKE OF BEDFORD-BREEDING OF THE BLUE RINGNEGK 1 43
THE BREEDING OF THE BLUE RINGNEGK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988384047619048" page_id="56288245"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, England)
In a previous article I have written that the pair of Indian Ringnecks
I received in the winter of 1949 did not nest the following year, as the
hen, from her short tail and general appearance, was obviously only
a year old. That autumn she moulted out a very fine bird and the
adult cock also improved considerably in appearance. They are fed
on the usual seed mixture and are provided with a whole apple, to eat
as much of as they wish, and not merely with a slice of apple. They
are also given, when they can be spared, a few grapes. In the spring,
sweetened milk-sop was added, of which they eat a certain amount
when rearing young. Green food I do not bother about, as birds of
their family do not seem to care about it when they can get plenty of
fruit. They are housed in a 24 ft. by 8 ft. by 8 ft. movable aviary.
During the winter I keep a lamp in the shelters of all the Psittacula
parrakeets except the Derbians, to keep the temperature just above
freezing and prevent the birds 5 feet from being damaged by frost-bite.
This trouble is only likely to occur with Ringnecks during really severe
frost, but the feet of Malabar and Layard's Parrakeets are very tender.
In case of any disaster during the breeding season I bought a pair of
ordinary Ringnecks to act as foster-parents. They came to me with
rather a bad reputation as breeders as, for two seasons, their eggs had
failed to hatch. As events subsequently proved they, or rather the cock,
deserved the bad reputation, though not for the reason expected. All
four eggs laid by the greens were successfully hatched, but when the
young were half grown the cock decided to murder them, and was
only prevented in the nick of time through the intervention of his wife
(whose eye he injured) and of my aviary attendant, who removed him
and placed him in durance vile. The young birds were successfully
reared by the hen alone and are very good specimens.
Ringnecks as a rule want to nest very early in the year, regardless
of the weather, but the blues were not particularly anxious to begin,
and it was mid-April before they really settled down to business.
I was doubtful whether success would be achieved as the cock is a
rather funny-tempered bird and for some strange reason his wife
appears to get on his nerves, especially in the morning ! Even during
the breeding season he will sometimes chase her about in a rather ill-
natured fashion early in the day, although the same afternoon he may
be displaying to her and feeding her.
In due course, however, she disappeared into her nest-box, from
which time onwards events moved peacefully to the successful and
happy conclusion of three lovely young birds emerging at the very end
of June. They were strong on the wing from the first and, as is common

with young Ringnecks, exceedingly wild and nervous. The cock has
proved an excellent father and although still short-tempered with his
wife, treats his children with forbearance, even now that they are
feeding themselves.
The blue coloration of an Indian Ringneck or an Alexandrine is
not the brilliant sky-blue of a blue Budgerigar but a soft powder-blue,
which is equally pleasing in its way and is greatly admired by all who
see it. The cock's ring is white, the black moustachial markings being

4th February, 1951, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. L. S. Gilmer,
8806 Tobias Avenue, Van Nuys. Mr. Rudkin reported that his
Lutino Ring-necks were sitting, also the Pennants and his African
Greys were showing signs of nesting. Mr. Cochran announced that

LONDON ZOO NOTES
By C. S. Webb
Since my last notes a fair number of new birds have been acquired.
From Kenneth Smith, recently returned from Sierra Leone, we
obtained the following :--*
2 White-faced Tree-ducks ( Dendrocygna viduala).
1 African Woolly-necked Stork (Dissoura episcopus microscelis ).
1 Piping Hornbill ( Bycanistes buccinator ).
1 West African Little Sparrow Hawk ( Accipiter minullus erythropus ).
1 Black Heron ( Melanophoyx ardesiaca).

The latter did not survive, which is a great pity, as it has most
interesting feeding habits. I have often watched Black Herons feeding
in the rice-fields of Madagascar, fascinated by their behaviour. From
a stationary position, or when walking very slowly through water,
one foot is suddenly thrust forward as if the bird is making a

particularly long stride and at the same moment the head is held down
while the wings are spread outwards and forwards until they meet,
forming a complete canopy over the head. This provides shade in
water that is otherwise dazzling in the brilliant sunshine, and so
enables the bird to see clearly any form of animal life underneath.
This whole action of wing-spreading is accomplished so quickly that
the bird looks like some mechanical object being operated with
springs. After a few moments the wings are brought back to the
normal position, and then the operation is repeated. It is a remark-
able sight to see a number of birds performing in this manner.
The Marquess of Bute sent us a number of birds--mostly nestling
birds of prey--which were collected on his estates in Southern Spain,
near Gibraltar. They included Griffon Vultures, Bonnelli's Eagles,
Black Kites, Kestrels, a European Tawny Owl, a Little Owl, and an
Egyptian Vulture. The latter was the only adult specimen. The
young Griffons on arrival were covered in down, their bodies
resembling those of plucked geese. One weighed 11J lb., and another,
a few weeks older, 14 lb.
From the Ameer of Bahawalpur we received a collection of birds
from the N.W. India Zone. These included various seed-eaters,
palm-doves, Turtle Doves, White-eared Bulbuls, Chukor Partridges,
Black Francolins, and Black-breasted Sandgrouse ( Pterocles orientalis ).
The latter species has not been in our collection since 1934.
Also received were 1 Red-crested Finch (Coryphospingus cucullatus),
1 Water Rail, 1 Red-headed Cardinal [Paroaria dominicana), 1 Greater
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, 2 Alpine Choughs (Pyrrhocorax graculus)
from the Basle Zoo, 1 Bahama Duck, 2 Upland Geese (transferred
from Whipsnade), 3 Satin Bower Birds, 1 Lesser Niltava, 6 Chilean
Flamingoes, and a Black-headed Oriole (Oriolus xanthornus) from
Ceylon.
The most interesting breeding success at the moment is the rearing
of two Magellan Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) --the first of this
species to be bred in the London Zoo. I am not sure if they have been
bred elsewhere.
Several of our Gulls, Gannets, and Night Herons are nesting, but
no results yet (12th June). There is also an interesting affair taking
place in the British Birds Aviary where there is a nest of three Stone
Curlew eggs in full view of the public. The parent birds take turns
to sit. The incubation period is nearly ended, so we are anxiously
awaiting results as there appear to be no breeding records of this
species in captivity.
A number of Pheasants have hatched out, but nothing particularly
rare. To offset our successes some youths have been active stealing or
smashing up clutches of waterfowl eggs--in some cases about to
hatch--including Carolinas, Spot-bills, and Canada Geese.

each part net.
These excellently presented volumes are the result of thirty years'
work and are yet further evidence of Mr. Prestwich's careful, systematic,
and wide research on the subject of breeding records or birds in
captivity.
The records are given in narrative form and the value of the book
is greatly enhanced by the fact that many quotations are given in full.
This is most helpful particularly as many of the works quoted are
scarce and difficult of access.
The author also asks for information of any possible unrecorded
breeding successes and stresses the importance of recording all results
in one of the recognized avicultural or ornithological journals.
All aviculturists will find the book of the greatest interest and no
serious student of the subject should be without it. PBS
BIRDS WILD AND FREE. By Commander A. W. P. Robertson.
W. and J. Mackay and Co., Ltd. 16^. net.
Although the reader may find, as he is warned by the author in
the preface, that this book contributes little to his knowledge of
scientific ornithology he will nevertheless find it eminently readable.
The bulk of the book is taken up with experiences of photographing
and observing birds in Cheshire and on the East Coast. These are
told with feeling and humour so that the reader himself shares the
disappointment when a Pied Flycatcher's nest turns out--after the
hide is up--to be only a Robin's, and feels both pity and exasperation
for the foolish but irascible Swan family trapped on a steep sided lake.
A chapter on " The Farming Village " is a pleasing diversion, still
mainly ornithological in character. The final chapter on bird
identification is perhaps the best of all and will be of the utmost
help to the beginner. The author draws attention to many interesting
points of bird behaviour and makes some original observations. One
could indeed wish that these subjects had been dealt with at greater
length and with more evidence but this probably would have been out
of place in a book of this character.
The author's views on what he considers vermin are, however, less
pleasing. Such a childish cliche as " black-hearted brute " for the
Carrion Crow, or the self-contradictory statement that a certain area
has more Magpies than the land can support, come as a painful
surprise from a writer who elsewhere shows such feeling and talent.
Few who are not blinded by prejudice will agree that the Grey

Squirrel is not beautiful, and if it is not useful to man at least it
performs a great service to our wild-life, by drawing upon itself the
destructive rage of many whose love of killing would otherwise be
gratified at the expense of native birds or mammals.
The book is copiously illustrated with pleasing and interesting
photographs of breeding birds. The Stockdove, whose portrait when
about to enter its nest-hole has appeared in so many books and
magazines, is here shown about to leave its nest, a welcome change
even though it is, apparently, the same hole and the same Stockdove.

A BOOK OF DUCKS. By Phyllis Barglay-Smith, with illustra-
tions by Peter Shepheard. Penguin Books, Harmondsworth,
Middlesex. 1951. Price $s. 6 d. net.
A small popular book on a well-known group of birds has great
educational value if it is accurate as well as simple and well conceived.
The excellent work by Miss Barclay-Smith on the ducks of Great
Britain gives full satisfaction. It says briefly what should be known
by all on ducks as birds, as game, and also as pets. The essentials
of their behaviour and their migrations are given in a general
introductory chapter. Then the sixteen species usually found in the
British Isles are listed, with their vernacular names in English, French,
German, and Dutch as well as their scientific Latin designation.
A page of text applies to each plate, on which the drake is figured in
colour while the female is represented by a line drawing.
The work of Mr. Shepheard is satisfactory as a whole ; the surface
feeding species are correctly drawn, while the Pochard's shape does
not appear to be quite well understood by the artist; but the Golden-
eye, the Eider, and the Mergansers are excellently depicted.
This little book will certainly prove most useful to thousands of
readers.

Go. Illustrated, pp. 124 ; 1951. $3.50.
Are you a bird enthusiast in need of another and related hobby ?
Or merely someone with time on his hands and a yen to create ?
Perhaps a lad or lass of leisure with talent going wearily to waste ?
Do you like sometimes to take a sharp knife and a piece of soft
wood and whittle, just for relaxation ? Wouldn't you like to whittle
creatively ; that is, make something besides shavings and an onslaught
upon time ? " Me ? Carve ? " you ask. " Man, that's art --sculping.
Too difficult. I can't coax a decent figure out of soft stuff, like soap
or clay---a lot easier to shape than wood."

Get this book (beautifully printed, and so bound that it will lie
open of itself at any page) and let Lacy and McBride convince you
that you, too, and anybody else that can cut and polish to line and
curve, can whittle out beautiful bird likenesses. They'll make it obvious
to you that by following the simple and clear but detailed instructions
(richly illustrated with photo-engravings and drawings) you can, with
few and inexpensive tools and no great expenditure of effort but a
reasonable outlay of time and care, become a skilled maker and
colourer of " birds in wood
Long before you have made and painted to your fair satisfaction
one facsimile each of the twenty-nine species of birds for the carving
and colouring of which you are given explicit directions, you will be
expert enough to venture into other fields, for variety, if you are so
inclined. The exercises set, by their very completeness of detail, may
very well serve the beginner as a thorough introduction to the problems
and possibilities of artistic carving.
Bird students who take up bird-carving are sure to find themselves
learning much about bird form and bird colouring that they supposed
they knew, but didn't.

I have a Blue-fronted Amazon cock which came into my possession in 1921.
It was purchased in Las Palmas, and was feeding on the usual boiled maize. I had
difficulty in weaning him off this on to the usual seed diet, and nearly lost him whilst
the acclimatizing process was going on.
He used to lie on his back wrapped in flannel before a gas cooker, and I found
advice given to me by Miss Ada Chapman, who at that time kept a well-known pet
shop in Birmingham, invaluable.
During the war years from 1939 to 1946 I was compelled to leave him in the care
of my Mother, who resided in a part of Birmingham that suffered heavy bomb
damage. During the air raids he was taken into a cellar with her two other pets
a cat and dog, who by force of the circumstances under these conditions were compelled
to share the same food dish, which they did without friction. It was quite amusing
to see them all grouped round the same dish all partaking of the same kind of food.
When I retook possession of him, I found that during the whole of the time he
was in my Mother's keeping he had not had any sunflower seed, but had lived
and thrived on anything that was available.
I eventually got him back on to a seed diet, but he still prefers cooked vegetables,
chipped potatoes, dog biscuits, bread and butter and jam, and egg, whether boiled,
fried, or scrambled. It is amazing how he knows when egg is on the menu, and there
isn't any peace until he has had his share. He also likes custard, rice pudding, etc.,
which he eats from a spoon held in his claw.
He is quite a good talker, but will let no one handle him excepting my wife. She
can play with him as one would with a puppy, rolling him over and over, and he
delights in it.
He is quite fit and always appears in show condition. I took him to the North
Birmingham Open Show in 1949, and he gained third prize in a class of ten exhibits
which included Blue Rosellas, Princess of Wales, Senegals, Lovebirds, Starlings, etc.
--not bad for an old stager. Mr. Birch, who was judging, said he was one of the
biggest and best examples of this type of bird which he had seen.
His companion is an Alexandrine hen, who is rapidly taking to the same diet !

THE FALCATED TEAL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968315361111111" page_id="56288261"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Terry Jones (Leckford, Hants, England)
The Falcated Teal breeds in North-Eastern Asia and winters chiefly
in Japan. It is a large bird for a Teal being about the size of a Wigeon
and is in fact a very Wigeon-like bird in many ways. The drake's call
is a drawn-out whistle " whoo-eek ", the duck is an extremely silent
bird and only very occasionally do we hear the female make any
sound. The call is a rather deep quack and when courting a drake
the ducks make small clucking noises.
In feeding habits the Falcated Teal behaves much more like Wigeon in
that they live to a very large extent on green food, feeding on water
weeds or grazing short turf. Here at Leckford they are more indepen-
dent of artificial food than is any other species of waterfowl, including
the geese.
The drake's display is rather elaborate and teal-like. The Common,
Greenwinged, and Chilean Teals I suppose spend more time displaying
than do most waterfowl and the Falcated runs them pretty close in
this respect.
Here the Falcated nest rather late in the season, generally about the
third week in May. The nests are extremely well concealed in rank
vegetation in a fairly dry site. The normal clutch is about eight eggs.
The latter a rather long, creamish white in colour, somewhat smaller
than a Mallard's. Eggs of individual ducks of the same species often
vary considerably in size and shape. As our Falcated females consist
of a mother and two daughters the similarity in the shape of the eggs
may be a family characteristic. The colour of the eggs of a species of
duck seems to vary much less than the size or shape, except of course
that the first egg of a clutch is generally darker than the later ones.
The incubation period is 25 or 26 days and the ducklings on
hatching are ginger-headed like young Wigeon, but much larger
beaked. They are easily reared and grow quickly. They should
have a plentiful supply of green food.
The adult drakes are not quarrelsome with other waterfowl and are
extremely decorative birds. I hope some new blood will be imported
into Europe or America so that the species may again become common
in captivity.

Here, at Niska 1 Farm, we keep a collection of approximately a
hundred wild geese of fifteen species, as well as some ducks, swans,
pheasants, and peafowl.
It is always amusing to receive a request for a quantity of wild goose
eggs. To the uninitiated " eggs is eggs 55 and anyone who has both
sexes of any species of wild goose should quite easily be able to spare
a few eggs. In 1927 I acquired a pair of European Gray Lag Geese
from a New York importer. Doubtless they were wild caught, and
I never expected them to lay. However, in 1938, after 11 years, the
female laid in an elevated steel barrel and started incubating. Un-
fortunately an Egyptian gander escaped from his enclosure and
finding the Grey Lag Goose on the nest, promptly killed her. When
discovered, the eggs were spoiled.
Two years later, in 1940, I was fortunate in getting another female.
She mated the following spring, and has been successful in rearing
a brood in at least five of the succeeding years. The old gander,
" Clarence," is not less than twenty-four years old, and quite possibly
much older. He is not very nimble any more, but he and his mate
" Lizzie " are still inseparable, and I am hoping he will be spared for
a few more seasons to father some more fluffy yellow goslings.
Wild geese have so many interesting and intriguing personal
qualities that it is unfair to generalize. However, no one could fail to
admire their rugged independence. They will mate and reproduce if
conditions are favourable and if they feel like it. All one can do is try
to provide the facilities and the privacy--and hope !
One thing is sure : breeding pairs should be treasured and protected,
as they cannot be readily replaced. Protection from predators is,
I firmly believe, the most difficult problem of all. The Great Horned
Owl cannot be fenced out, and it is almost as hopeless to depend on
fencing against raccoon and mink. I try to encourage my geese to
lay in steel oil drums, raised off the ground, to protect the eggs from
crows. Many geese take to these barrels quite readily. However,
they are still vulnerable to skunks and other ground predators. Placing
the barrels on a stand in water limits the predators (in this area) to
mink and raccoon. Constant trapping at the fence line is in order
to hold the number of " possibles " down.
Where safety is reasonably assured, I like to permit the parents to
hatch and rear their own goslings. As soon as they are hatched I
remove the family to an individual pen, fairly small, so that their
feeding can be controlled and the babies cannot be over-exercised.
Grass, of course, is the most important single item of food. If there is

danger from predators, it is wiser to remove the eggs for incubation
under hens. This not only ensures the safety of the eggs but protects the
parents as well, as an incubating goose is easier for a raccoon or fox
to catch than one at liberty.
Keeping wild geese is an absorbing and stimulating study. The
more experience one has, the more one realizes how little one knows.
Certainly few set rules apply, and each bird is an individual, with his
own peculiarities. If it cannot be said that geese have brains, I believe
they have a high degree of intelligence and character. If they hadn't,
most species would have followed the Passenger Pigeon into oblivion.
Some species are fighting a dogged rearguard action to-day, and their
numbers are dangerously low. But the future of the tremendous flocks
of Blue and Snow Geese that concentrate in James Bay in the fall,
owing to their peculiar migration pattern, is reasonably secure. I have
travelled throughout the southern and eastern coast of James Bay
annually for some years, and my personal opinion is that the quantity
of Blue Geese in this flyway has steadily increased. The Dominion
authorities deserve great credit for taking prompt and firm action in
limiting their exploitation, and if their protection on their wintering
grounds on the Gulf does not deteriorate, we will continue to have on
this continent " the greatest concentration of wild geese in the

Col. P. Milon, who has spent four months on Kergelen Island during
the autumn and winter of 1950-51, has recently brought to Paris ten
Kergelen Pintails (Anas acuta eatoni ). They all look, at this time of the
year (June-July), like very small, dark, reddish female Common
Pintails, the size of a Chilian Teal. The bill is narrow and short,
bluish grey with a black band along the culmen. The birds are tame,
silent, and they like perching on walls or large logs. Col. Milon reports
seeing the drakes in breeding plumage between December and April.
Very few seem to wear the complete adult dress, as figured in the
Catalogue of Birds , vol. xxvii, which resemble a dull male Pintail,
the white mixed with reddish brown. Most of them, however, resemble
at that time Common Pintails in eclipse. Later on, they undergo
an eclipse of their own, then differing only slightly from the females in
the plain brownish grey wing-coverts and metallic-green mirror,
which is brown in the ducks.

Hartlaub's Duck inhabits tropical Africa from Sierra Leone to the
Congo and mainly between the Equator and io* North.
Specimens from the eastern part of the range show varying degrees
of white on the head, and Neuman (Bulletin of the British Ornitholo-
gists' Club (1908), vol. xxi, p. 42) describes birds from N.E. Congo as
Pteronetta hartlaubi albifrons. Birds from the westerly part of the range
are entirely black on the head, but there seems little reason to suppose
one to be sub-specific of the other.
This duck is of skulking habit and lives mainly on small streams
overhung by forest, rarely being seen in more open places. The sexes
are alike except for size ; the body colour is chestnut ; there is a large
area of dull pale cobalt blue on the wings ; the head, neck, tail, and
flights are dull black ; the irides dark brown ; the legs, feet, and bill
are dull black and there is a conspicuous flesh-coloured band near the
tip of the upper mandible.
Four specimens collected in southern Sierra Leone by Messrs.
Fleetwood and Smith were received by the Severn Wildfowl Trust in
April. The smallest, which seemed to be the only certain female, was
at first undecided whether to live or die, but on a diet of earth-worms,
duckweed, soaked biscuit-meal, and soaked wheat all four rapidly
improved.
We expected them to be sensitive to the cold, so kept them in a
covered pen with a heated brooder attached but it soon became evident
that they were not delicate, so they were put into a larger open pen
and until about the end of May were shut at night into a thatched hut
having a layer of dry straw on the floor. Exactly how they will stand
the winter is not known, but they have the appearance of being at least
fairly hardy.
A little displaying sometimes goes on ; the birds face each other
and both describe circular movements of the head, the presumed male
uttering a quiet high-pitched wheezing noise and the presumed female
a low clucking. None of the " rapid raucous cries " described by
Bates have been heard, but if, as might be supposed, the voice is any
indication of the sex, these birds are two pairs.

<bodyText confidence="0.997233117647059" page_id="56288265"  page_num="157" year="" vol="">
The success of the investigator in zoological classification is more
dependent than in other branches of biological research upon an
instinctive feeling which can, it is true, be learned but not taught.
In the introduction to his work " The Birds " in Bronn's Classes and
Orders of the Animal Kingdom , Gadow made the experiment of a
" Thirty Characteristic Systematics ". He chose thirty common
characteristics, which, from the point of view of classification, are
certainly important, and divided the groups of birds in tabular
arrangement according to whether the characteristics are present or
not. Along with far-reaching harmonies in many bird groups, the
systematics thus improved showed, in places, astonishingly gross
deviations from the commonly accepted arrangement considered to
represent true relationship. This is explained, in the first place, by the
fact that the so-called " Classifying instinct " rests upon an unconscious
valuation of a very much greater number of characteristics which,
not easily accessible to individual observation, are woven into the
general impression which such an animal group makes upon the
investigator. Such unanalysed complex qualities include very minute
individual characteristics which cannot be severed from the general
impression at will, although they influence it by determinative qualities.
This fact, which is obvious to the psychologist of observation and
form, must now be taken into consideration, if one wishes to analyse
the instinctive feeling for classification and know the grounds which
determine one's own judgment as to the degree of relationship of the
different animal forms.
The inadequacy of a classification built upon a limited number of
predetermined characteristics, does not rest merely on the fact that
their number was too small. Much more disturbing is the circumstance
that a definite character does not possess the same weight within the
separate parts of a greater classified whole. The rate of differentiation
and the variability of a definite character can be decidedly different
even in two closely related species. The hypothesis that a character,
such as the lack of the fifth secondary, or the form of the furcula,
possesses equal taxonomic value throughout the whole class of birds,

in all orders and families, is false to begin with. The weight that can
be ascribed to a characteristic as a measurement of phylogenetic
relationship must be decided in each case by its relative proportion to
other characteristics of the group examined. The statement, as to
whether a characteristic is relatively fixed or variable can concern
only a narrow selection of closely related forms. This is so, not only
for critical characteristics of limited distribution, but very often for
characteristics of general distribution. Even the usually fixed onto-
genetic characteristics, as, for instance, the immature plumage of so
many bird groups, can be affected in a narrowly circumscribed
systematic unit by secondary changes in such a way that it would lead
to the greatest confusion if one were to ascribe to them that taxonomic
value which generally belongs to them. Imagine one considering
peculiarities of natal down, which in the Anatidae are so unusually
fixed and taxonomically useful, in the taxonomy, in a similar manner,
of Rails, in which they are overlaid by secondary differentiations,
acting as releasers. The number of characters known to the one who
judges the degree of phylogenetic relationship is important not only
in itself in the determination of group-specific " complex qualities "
but more than that because the more characteristics the examiner can
take, consciously or unconsciously, into consideration, the better he
can evaluate the relative importance of a single character. The
" classifying instinct " does all this without the man who possesses it
needing to be able to analyse it himself. However, only when the
analysis is accomplished does his performance become science.
In the basis given here briefly, of conscious or instinctive judgment
of phylogenetic relationship, one can determine that it is not the man
who knows an organ in all its forms in which it appears and where it is
represented in a large systematic group, who has the most reliable
judgment about relationship, but the man who surveys minutely
a small unit with as large a number of characteristics as possible in
mind. The possibility of a priori conclusions about phylogeny mount
not only in arithmetical progression with the number of known
characteristics, but decidedly in geometrical progression, because with
every additional characteristic examined in all the representatives of
the group, our estimate of the importance of the known characteristics
gains in correctness. Now we can understand for once why those
zoologists who, as keepers of zoological gardens or as fanciers, know
a definite animal group through many of its living representatives,
attain such peaks in the development of systematic intuition and in the
critical understanding of phylogenetic relationships. One thinks of
Heinroth's work on Anatidae and the " Study of Equidae " by
Antonius. The Zoo director, who is equipped with a knowledge of
the anatomy and perhaps even of the palaeontology of many represen-
tatives of a group of animals has a well of knowledge of inherent

specific characters to draw on as compared to the purely museum
classifier. This indubitable fact is of significance and value not only
for the systematise but still more so for the psychologist. Since Wundt's
time it has been emphasized that the problem of comparative phylo-
genetic development is just as vital in psychology and the theory of
behaviour for the understanding of any given patterns in man and
animals as it is in morphology. From the psychological point of view
all forms of life are, in a way, phylogenetic attainments whose special
objects would have to remain completely obscure without the know-
ledge of their phylogenetic development. Comparative psychology,
which until now, unfortunately, has remained almost entirely a mere
syllabus, has the urgent task of carrying on first of all a purely descrip-
tive study of the behaviour of a group of animals suitable for the
purpose, in order to combine the characteristics thus learned with
every conceivable morphological characteristic, into a critical charac-
terization of the group. Because of its harmony with the related
anatomical characteristics, the applicability of the taxonomic homology
concept even for special behaviour patterns would be established once
and for all against all attacks, and thus a working hypothesis for all
comparative psychology in the true sense of the word would be set up.
Only such a critical characterization of a sufficiently thoroughly
investigated animal group can give us knowledge on the ways and
means whereby racial changes in instinctive behaviour, taxes, and
inherited patterns and also, in a broader respect, basic mental structure,
can come about. The fundamental importance of such knowledge, at
present unfortunately still lacking, does not need to be stressed. The
path that the investigation has to follow lies clearly before us, even
though it be a particularly difficult and thorny one. The present work
represents a very incomplete attempt to give a critical characterization
serving the aims mentioned, for one group, including behaviour
characteristics.
II. TECHNICAL,
The task of making a purely descriptive inventory of the behaviour
of very many species makes very great demands on the examiner's
powers of observation. In order to make, even approximately, a
sufficiently complete inventory, the observer must live with the animals
day after day, year after year. It is really impossible to gain the
necessary knowledge by observing the animals in the wild state. Even
when one has kept the animals under observation for years and has
been most conscientious about keeping entries in a diary, there are
still, after the work is done, single dates missing here and there, which
would have been of great importance in making comparisons, and
concerning which, unfortunately, previous work contributes an all too
feeble testimony. The animals investigated must be amenable to

captivity. Moreover the group concerned must be rich in comparable
species and genera with, if possible, consecutive grades of relationship
with the individual forms, also rich in comparable individual behaviour
traits, analogous from species to species, yet different enough to serve
as a test for the applicability of a common origin concept. All these
requirements will be fulfilled ideally by two groups of animals, both of
which I have kept to carry on the research of which we have been
speaking, namely, in birds the Anatinae and in fishes the Cichlidae.
The former will be dealt with here. The Anatinae have been very
carefully studied by Heinroth, Delacour, von Boetticher, and others,
and in addition they afford the investigator in the field of comparative
phylogeny a special advantage by the fact that hybrids can be bred
easily. In addition these are in very many cases fertile, so that the
inheritance of specific behaviour characters can be studied. Here we
have a fruitful field for a synthesis of phylogenetics and genetics. In
many cases a special peculiarity of hybrids helps us in making phylo-
genetic assertions on specific behaviour characters, namely, that they
are not intermediates between the parents but, physically and in
behaviour, show a third and a more primitive condition. A further
value of hybrids lies in the fact that the degree of their fertility can be
made a measurement for the degree of the relationship existing between
the parents, as Poll has shown.

III. GENERAL REMARKS ABOUT EXPRESSION BEHAVIOUR
A. THE TAXONOMIC USEFULNESS OF SIGNAL MOVEMENTS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998065162162162" page_id="56288269"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
Since Whitman (1898) showed that instinctive actions require
phylogenetically the same amount of time for their evolution as do
body structures, and since Heinroth (1910) published his studies of
Anatidae and his work (1930) on the systematic distribution of
determined behaviour patterns in vertebrates, the taxonomic usefulness
of inherited specific behaviour has gradually become common property
of zoological systematics (Stresemann " Aves " in Kiikenthal's
Handbuch). I myself pointed out several years ago that well defined
instinctive behaviour is particularly suitable for systematic use and
hence, in obvious corollary, for research on the phylogenetical relation-
ship of inherited behaviour patterns, namely those instinctive actions
whose significance to the preservation of the species lies in the sending
out of stimuli which are answered in a specific manner by other
individuals of the same species. Such behaviour patterns, functioning
as " releasers " (Lorenz, 1935) are especially characteristic of birds,
as in them reaction to optical movement-perception plays a great role.
In other animal groups, chemical, acoustic, and tactile releasers are
more important. These do not afford man, the eye animal, nearly as
good opportunities for experimental and comparative research, but
apart from purely observation-technical grounds, the optically
functioning signal movement of birds, like those of the bony fishes, is
a very fruitful subject for investigation. First, it is very rich in identi-
fying and striking characteristics which greatly aid in phylogenetic
comparisons of species with species, and group with group. This wealth
of characteristics is very closely related to their function as signals, for
just like a human signal, the animal releaser must be incapable of
being misunderstood if it is to fulfil its function completely. I have
gone into these relationships more closely in a special work (1935)
and have explained there that a combination of the greatest possible
simplicity and the greatest possible general unreality is the main
attribute of a clear and easily understood signal. Both properties make
the releaser for purposes of appraisal an especially valuable criterion in
a systematic comparison of characters. Even the fact that it can be
easily described adds much to its value.
There is a second circumstance that makes the releaser a very
valuable aid to an investigation of genetic relationship. Because its
form is not directly derived from its function and influenced by it, as is

the case in mechanically effective actions, the possibility of convergence
can most probably be excluded when the releasing ceremony is the
same in two related species. That the wagging of the tail in the dog
indicates friendly greeting, while in the cat, hostile feelings, has nothing
to do with function. The meaning rests purely on a " convention 55
between the inherited expression movement in the one, and the equally
inherited understanding in the other members of the same species.
As far as the special form of the movement is concerned, it could just
as well be reversed. In the same way the philologist, who finds the
same word with the same meaning, among two different peoples, does
not need to bother about the infinitesimally small probability that this
is mere chance, but without more ado and quite correctly assumes
a single historical root for both words. So also in many cases the
comparative psychologist can assume a genetic homology where the
releasing ceremonies, which have often many distinguishing features,
agree in two related forms. All these circumstances have led to the
point where we know far more about the origin, systematically, for
instinctive releasing movements than for other inherited behaviour
traits. In two ways, both independent of each other, we can trace back
many, if not most, of them with high probability to other more
primitive and mechanically effective instinctive movements without,
naturally, knowing how these, for their part, have arisen. At any rate,
in our present poverty of information about the phylogenesis of psychic
behaviour traits, even this small provable fragment of phylogenetical
developmental history is very welcome.

B. SYMBOLIC ACTIVITY.
It is a distinguishing characteristic of any centrally co-ordinated
autonomic automatism which we designate as instinctive behaviour
that it changes into visible movements with the least intensification of
the irritation created by it. Thus arise more or less pronounced
indications of behaviour which can serve its real purpose in the
preservation of the species only by a much more intense response.
The weak responses which become noticeable even in the weakest
intensities of stimulation are in themselves without meaning and
purpose for the preservation of the species. The experienced person,
however, can deduce from them the nature of the specific excitation
which begins to well up within the animal. He is, therefore, in a
position to predict what kind of activities, if any, are to be expected
from it. Therefore, these initial activities have been called intention
movements. Many instinctive actions, for instance the flying-up of
a duck or goose, never happen quite suddenly, except as a result of
a very strong external stimulation. When it is the inner urge of an
instinct that is gradually cumulating within the organism, then we
invariably find a very regular series of intention-movements preceding

the final, fully intensive, and biologically adequate activity. Thus there
is the possibility that within the species concerned there is developed an
" understanding 55 for the intention-behaviour of other members of
the same species, through which inherited patterns are formed which
are related to the responses engendered by any given intention-
behaviour in the same way as the radio receiver is to the sender. In
other animals of the same species these inherited patterns first, for the
most part, cause an evoking of the same instinctive action as that
which the response-stimulating animal was carrying out. The specific
stimulating quality connected with this behaviour is transmitted thus
through bringing out the specific intention-behaviour and evoking its
corresponding inherited specific behaviour pattern, as between an
individual and all others of the same species present. In my work
Der Kumpan in der Umwelt des Vogels (1935) I have brought together
many examples of this form of transference of a mood, which is never
better exemplified than in the uniform orientation seen in the behaviour
of social animals, falsely called " imitation ". Through this procedure,
obviously of the very greatest survival value for social animals, the
once meaningless intention-behaviour now takes on a great significance,
and , like every functioning organ , comes under the influence of those factors which
are working towards higher differentiation. Releasing intention-movements,
corresponding to their signalling function, are changed from the
original form in such a manner that they become visually more
pronounced. They become " mimic-exaggerations " like the nod
movements of leading mallards, the upward-flying movement of the
Casarcinae, and the Anserinae, the swimming movements of nest-
leaving Cichlids, etc. The mimic exaggeration can often go so far
that the original root of the action, the intention-movement, reduced
to a purely mechanical protective behaviour without signal form,
becomes practically unrecognizable and can be determined only by
bringing in, for systematic comparison, other species in which it is
little altered. The Egyptian Goose's flying-up behaviour, the move-
ment in Nannacara indicative of leading young, etc., are certainly
derived from intention-behaviour indicating flying or swimming
away, but no one who was ignorant of the homologous behaviour of
their relatives would recognize them as such. Such ceremonies,
derived from intention-behaviour but often " formalized " beyond
recognition, we designate by the term " symbolic activity ".
G. DISPLACEMENT ACTIVITY.
Besides these releasing symbol-actions arising out of intention-
movements, there are others which have arisen in an entirely different
manner, the displacement activity, as N. Tinbergen calls it. At the
upper levels of general excitement, there may be released instinctive
movements which, so far as any real survival value is concerned, do not

belong at all to the immediate biological situation and are, so to speak,
performed by mistake. This seems to take place especially when the
normal movement, appropriate to the situation, is hindered for some
reason in finding its outlet. Then the special stimulus " jumps over ",
so to speak, into another track and an action as unexpected as inappro-
priate ensues. Man, too, shows many examples of this procedure.
Best known is the scratching of the head in embarrassment. Also,
everyone knows the various automatic movements that lecturers make
during their speeches. Tinbergen and Kortlandt, who, independently
of each other, described this procedure for the first time, have given
many examples of it, mostly from the behaviour of bony fishes and of
birds. In ornithological literature displacement activity is designated
mostly as sham-reactions, and also as mock-preening, mock-feeding,
etc. Just as intention behaviour produced by the energy of an "autoch-
thonous " reaction becomes a bizarre symbol of itself through
visually acting " mimic " exaggeration of certain phases of behaviour,
so also can the movements brought on by displacement activity
undergo, in their higher evolutionary development, such formalization
that it is necessary to examine comparatively many related forms in
order to unveil their origin.
Most of the display actions, which we shall have to describe for
swimming ducks, can be explained as symbolic and as displacement
activities, and this interpretation takes on a high degree of probability
in view of the self-evident phylogenetic relationships and their agree-
ment with those arrived at by comparing other characteristics. Dis-
placement activities outnumber symbolic activities ; most of them are
movements which are derived from the behaviour of preening and
shaking. Also prevalent among the automatisms in other animals,
innervated as displacement activities by allochthonic excitement (Kort-
landt), are the common daily automatisms of the care of the body (head
scratching in man, mock-preening in pigeons, cranes, etc.), the taking
of food (mock-feeding by the threatening barnyard fowl) and others
of similar significance. For more detailed treatment of symbol and
displacement behaviour, you are referred to my Der Kumpan in der
Umwelt des Vogels as well as to Tinbergen's Die Uebersprungbewegung.

A. GENERAL REMARKS.
Not only is the Mallard the duck whose behaviour has been known
longest and in greatest detail, but it also occupies a central position
among them in many respects. As a pronounced " primitive "
characteristic of the species, we can use the fact that the drake has, in
addition to the courtship whistle, another rather loud note, which

can take the form of a one-syllabled and drawn-out call ("raehb"), and
a two-syllabled conversation note ("raebraeb"). For the same purpose
we can use the corresponding note of the duck which is alike in both
rhythm and meaning. In all other Anatinae, in the three Cairininae
which we are concerned with here, as well as in the Casarcine Tadorna ,
the male's true voice, produced in the syrinx, is very considerably
underdeveloped in favour of the whistle which is produced by a special
organ, the drum of the trachea.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND CALLS.
The one-syllabled call-note of both sexes of the Mallard arises
ontogenetically in smooth transition from the likewise one-syllabled
" whistle of desertion ", which is common homologically to all duck-
lings at present known, and duplicates it fully even to the position of
the head and feathers (see Figs, i and 2). The conversation-call in all

rhynchos L. : a drawn-out " raehb
the Anatidse ducklings known to me is similar, as well as in the
Anserinae in which it was originally two-syllabled. In the genus Anser
this certainly original condition lasts only a few hours, after which it
develops from the two-syllabled generalized duck-like conversation-call
into the many syllabled type charateristic of the genera Anser , Eulabeia,
Branta, etc. In both sexes of the Mallard, the one-syllabled call-note
has also the significance of a warning, the sound, however, being just
the same to the human ear. By the appearance of a strange dog the
long, drawn-out "raehb" is released in all the drakes. In the latter
case perhaps it sounds especially loud and long ; at least, I am never
able to decide from the call alone whether a drake is calling or warning
his mate. Especially from the female, a repeated uttering of the one-
syllable call signifies the intention of changing location. Before flying
away it is given especially long and loud. It is uttered more softly,
but more persistently by the duck when she is wandering around
restlessly looking for her nest and when she is going to lead her brood

over a rather large area. This form of the call-note, which we term
" the going-away call 55 is found in very many Anatinae, and even in
Aix and Lampronessa , where the real call-note no longer exists in its
original form but is replaced by a specialized call. In males the going-
away call is lacking.
The two-syllabled conversation-call, the accent of which is on the
second syllable, is uttered even by the ducklings of a brood, but it is
uttered oftener and with special intensity by both mates when they find
each other after a rather long separation, or when ease of mind returns
after a scare which has made the birds freeze for a long time. In both

cases it is the drake especially that utters his two-syllabled 44 raebraeb "
with very great rapidity and loudness, while the duck, in her more
intense reaction generally begins to " incite ", Such a palaver of a pair,
or a brood of ducklings, reminds one very much of the so-called
44 triumph-cry " of Casarcinae and Anserinae, of which it probably
represents the phylogenetic first-step. In high degrees of reaction
intensity, corresponding perhaps to the duck turning to. incite, the
drake particularly has a special way of holding his head with raised
chin (Fig. 3) ; in moments of still greater intensity there appears,
but very rarely, an action called the 44 down-up movement ", which
we shall discuss later in connection with the antics of courtship. It is
established with certainty by phylogenetic links in Anatinae which
are more highly specialized with respect to a true triumph-cry, such as
Chaulelasmus , Mareca penelope, and M. sibilatrix, that the 44 chin-raising "
and 44 down-up " movements undergo a special differentiation. I will
return to this when I discuss these species. When these 44 raebraeb "
palavers of the Mallards, analogous to the 44 triumph-cry ", reach
exceptionally high degrees of excitement, passing even the threshold
of the 44 up-down " movement, there appears an indication in the
"raebraeb" of the drake, and even sometimes in the two-syllabled

call of the ducks, of a peculiar tone, which in the Gadwall has led to
a further differentiation. It consists in the fact that in the three
successive double sounds the middle one is always uttered more
strongly than the ones preceding and following ; thus " raebrae'b,
raeb-RAE'B, raebrae'b ".
G. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND GALLS OF THE FEMALE.
Just as, morphologically, the females of closely related ducks differ
much less from one another than do the males, so also do they in
respect to the inventory of their behaviour patterns. Therefore a
sufficiently detailed description of the female Mallard will save a longer
description of other ducks, with the exception of Mareca.

<bodyText confidence="0.997174709677419" page_id="56288275"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
The most common female action of courtship is the so-called
44 inciting " that is found in a form fundamentally the same, certainly
homologous, in all Anatinae, in Tadorna and Casarca , and among the
Cairininae in Aix, Lampronessa , and Amazonetta. The duck turns to her
mate, or the one to be her mate, swims after him and at the same time
threatens another male of the same species over her shoulder. With
the Egyptian Goose both these orientation reactions, i.e. the placing
of the body in a line with that of the actual or potential mate and the
movement of threatening 44 the symbolical enemy ", are quite indepen-
dent of each other, and in their relationship with each other are quite
plastic. The angle between the axis of the body and the direction of
the threatening movement of the head is determined solely by the
position of the female, the male, and the threatened enemy. It can
happen, for example, that the enemy, as seen from the position of the
female, is behind the male ; so that then the Egyptian Goose, pressed
closely against her mate, threatens the symbolical enemy straight
ahead. However, most frequently the female in inciting is placed
more or less with her tail towards the enemy, because she herself
first makes a little dash against him but, not daring to attack, has now
to run or swim from the 4 4 enemy " to the mate in order to incite at his
side. This performance, therefore, determines wholly in itself the
particular angle between the head and the axis of the body. Even in
Casarca ferruginea one often sees an inciting movement of the head
directed in this manner backwards over the shoulder, and not moti-
vated by the relative position of female, male, and 44 enemy ". In
inciting Anatinae, in which the inciting is formalized to a pure cere-
mony, and in which the original significance of the instinctive
behaviour, namely, bringing the mate into conflict with a real adver-
sary, is completely obscured by the secondary meaning of 44 avowal of
love " for the incited male, the movement of the head backwards over the
shoulder is nothing but a simple , taxis-free instinctive movement , and the birds

can no longer perform it other than in the one way, fixed for all time.
A Mallard female, for example, incites over the shoulder even when
the " enemy " is not in the direction in which she is threatening. The
direction of the threat can be directed only within a very small angle.
I wish to emphasize that I am far from propounding a Lamarckian
explanation of this remarkable differentiation--succession of inciting
behaviour. I am convinced that it represents a real " phylogenetic
order 55 for, beyond all doubt, the forms of inciting as they are found in
Casarcinae and indeed, to a certain extent in Anserinae, represent the
original form of the movement. Until one recognizes this one cannot
understand at all the ceremonies of the Anatinae which, in their sig-
nificance, are strongly modified. Nevertheless, I reject the proposition

that an instinctive movement can arise from an orientation reaction
which has become habit, through inheriting acquired characteristics.
On the other hand we know of many examples of the rise of firmly fixed
centrally co-ordinated forms of movement out of originally oriented
movements, for example, the so-called zig-zag dance (Leiner) of the
male Stickle-back.
When "inciting" the Mallard makes a specific call, a peculiar
trembling sound, accented mostly on the third syllable, " queggege'gg-
eggeggeggegg," through which is detectable a peculiar, querulous
accent. This sound is not to be confused with the one that the duck
makes when she is being pursued by a strange drake. When the
bird is inciting, the very mobile head articulation enables the upper
mandible to be bent down ventrally to its limit (Fig. 4) ; the
head and back feathers are kept flat. Both cause a peculiar sheep-
like expression of the face. Because of this downward bending of the
bill the line of the chin presses close to the curve of the rump along
which the head moves.

sounds similar only superficially ; it does not consist of a running
succession of " quegg " sounds but of a broken series of single " gaeck "
sounds, sharply uttered like a cough. While uttering these the upper
mandible is bent upwards as far as possible at the so-called frontal-nasal
joint, the feathers of the head and back are greatly ruffled, and the head
is drawn deeply into the neck (Fig. 5). Female Casarcinae, when dis-
turbed on the nest hold their bodies and
feathers in the same way and make a very
similar sound, as does also a brooding
Cairina if a drake wants to tread her. As in
Mallards, as well as in the species named,
mothers leading broods answer with the
same sound and movement to every little
disturbance, I am inclined to believe
that this is the primary significance of the FlG &amp;apos; si ^(R)^MauL r d PUl &amp;apos;
expression. It has been diverted by the
Mallard into the more specific meaning of repulsion of a strange drake
even for a non-brooding but fast-paired duck. The reactions and
sounds, which were originally peculiar to a duck that was unwilling
to mate because of brooding, found a new field of application in the
Mallard, Pintail, and probably the Teal (Nettion crecca) in the domi-
nance reaction of the drake, to be discussed later. When one hears
clucking sounds from a Mallard duck in flight, being pursued by two
drakes it is practically always the repulsion note just described Only
once in my life did I ever hear a Mallard in flight " incite ".

All female ducks including the genus Mareca , can make a very
peculiar sound which, doubtless, with 14 syllables in Nettion flavirostre
and one syllable in Mareca, represents the same homologous instinctive
behaviour in all forms. In the Mallard it is generally a six-syllable
" quaegaegaegaegaegaegaeg " with the strongest accent on the second
syllable and a decreasing sound in those following. This sound is
uttered especially by unmated ducks, and by fast-paired ones only
when the male has flown away. The sight of another bird of the same
species on the wing is the strongest releasing stimulus of the de-
crescendo call. However, unmated ducks with a very considerable
lowering of the threshold to the reaction in question will respond in
the same way to any flying duck and even to birds belonging to
different orders.

the drake also possesses the nod-swimming behaviour pattern, which
in his case is linked with other behaviour, and is not independent
as in the female. The duck brings the behaviour we have described
into play only when several drakes are gathered together and have
made their desire for courtship known by shaking themselves and
by ruffling their head feathers, as we shall describe later. Then,
holding her head in a peculiar
flat way with a very marked nodding,
the duck shoots among the drakes,
swimming in short arcs around as
many of them as possible. In nodding,
the head is held so close to the surface
Fig. 6. --Nod-swimming of the of the water that the duck's chin grazes

a releasing action for the ensuing display behaviour of the drakes.
The phylogenetic origin of nod-swimming is not at all clear, as we do
not as yet know any preliminary stages of the ceremony. We know
this behaviour so far only in the Mallard and the most closely related
members of the genus Anas in the old sense, and in the Chestnut-
breasted Teal, Virago castanea, and the Grey Teal, Virago gibber ifrons

less speed, in the prelude to mating the downward movement is

The next moment the drake flew down over the bank, landing at the
base. What I had thought was a prelude to mating was the intention-
behaviour for flying downwards--something that hardly ever happens.
I am quite sure that an intention movement downwards, i.e. to get
flat, is the origin of the ## pumping 55 prelude to mating in most
Anatinae. In the Mallard, as well as all other Anatinae, perhaps with
the exception of Mareca , the movements of the prelude to mating are
alike in form in both sexes. Those of the female are much more
intense, as she herself mostly gives the occasion for the prelude ceremony
and for copulation itself. We call this behaviour ## pumping 55

As we know, the males of most Anatinae as well as those of Aix
galericulata in the Cairininae and a number of species included in the
Fuligulinae gather together for social courtship play in which the
females take part only as onlookers, except for a few who provide the
necessary releaser behaviour to stimulate the males to courtship. On
the other hand the females of all Anatinae that have a social-play
(Heinroth) seem to have a very active role in choosing the mate,
a matter we shall come back to, especially with the Mandarin Duck.
Mallard drakes, along with Mandarin drakes are probably those in
whose social-play the presence or absence of the female plays the least
role. As is the case with hens of the Black Game, Capercaillie, Turkey,
and Peafowl, their courtship is not the wooing of a special female but
a general exhibition that takes place in apparently the same way
whether the female is present or not. Within the Anatinae we shall
see all the conceivable smooth transitions from such an impersonal
mass courtship to the personal courtship of a particular female. In their
social courtship the drakes jointly perform a number, varying from
species to species, of highly differentiated movements, mostly accom-
panied by sounds which are produced by means of the drum in the
syrinx of the drake. The movement connected with sounds which, as
we shall see, have arisen from very different instinctive behaviour of the
symbol and displacement activity type, have however this one thing in
common, i.e. they lead with very few exceptions to a tensing of the
windpipe which is obviously necessary to bring about the courtship
note. Preceding the true sound-accompanied courtship movements
there is always an instinctive behaviour which, perhaps, serves as
a self-stimulus, and whose distribution within the group allows one to
conclude a greater phylogenetic antiquity than is required for the real
courtship behaviour.

2. Drinking.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968153108695652" page_id="56288280"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
I shall first describe one such introductory movement which,
perhaps, has not an exclusively epigamic character. When two ducks
meet in a pond either the one gets out of the way of the other or both
drink. One might first consider this drinking as chance. Heinroth often
tells how he observed a long time before it was clear to him, that this
drinking at meeting was no chance but a ceremony, with a definite
social function and the significance of a " sign of peace The origin
of the significance of " drinking " he explains as a symbolic activity
in the sense that two birds that eat or drink close together have no bad
intentions toward each other. Thus, originally, drinking was a reaction
with a purely social meaning, and is not at all confined to the relation-
ship between the mates of a pair, even though it is very frequently
done by them. With greater differentiation it is linked with mock
preening behind the wing in many species, and in the Gadwall and in
the Mandarin Duck, which belongs to the Cairininae (q.v.), this has
become fixed. In the Mallard such a linkage is merely suggested. The
drake quite often does mock-preening right after he has drunk opposite
to his duck, and then they go through both behaviours several times,
and after each other, without any set order. I have already mentioned
here that the established linkage between drinking and mock-preening
in the Gadwall and the Mandarin is fixed in the reverse sequence.
Drinking is very widely spread in the family. In the Anatinae there
is no form of it lacking (see Table). With the significance of a male
courtship act it is linked with other epigamic behaviour even with the
Cairininae, Aix and Lampronessa as well as with the Fuligulinae, Netta
and Metopiana, very close relatives of the Anatinae.
3. Mock-Preening.
When a drake has drunk in front of a duck he is wooing, he frequently
reaches with his bill behind his slightly
lifted wing, just as though he were going
to preen himself (Fig. 8), but instead of
that, he moves the nail of his bill quickly
and roughly over the underside of the
&amp;apos; keel of his wing so that there is a rather
loud " Rrr 53 sound that can be heard
Fig. 8 . -- Mock-preening of

short that I am still unable to tell whether

Compare Figs 28 and 49. seems to indicate the latter, but on the
other hand, one must remember that in the Wigeon, Garganey Teal,

coloured and differentiated for this purpose. It is an interesting com-
mentary on the psychology of animal observation that mock-preening
was first discovered by us only in 1939, after we had devoted many
years to the purposeful observation of these birds. What first opened
my eyes to the procedure I had so often seen was that I noticed for the
first time a homologous movement of the Garganey drake, done a little
differently, in which the colours of the small wing feathers, obviously
differentiated expressly for this behaviour, made it impossible to over-
look. Then I seemed to realize vaguely that I must have seen this
ceremony somewhere before, and in the course of special observations
to discover this " somewhere " I came to the astonishing conclusion
that all the species of ducks I had observed carried out this behaviour
(see Table). To-day it seems quite unbelievable that the unusual yet
characteristic sound had not drawn my attention to it much sooner.
Mallard drakes begin mock-preening, which almost always begins
with drinking (not the other way around !), not only upon meeting
the female but, in the same way, and perhaps more intensively, when
meeting drakes, when the mood for social courtship begins to rise.
With this significance the behaviour can be considered the first
prelude to what Heinroth calls " social-play ".
From the point of view of its phylogenetic origin, mock-preening is
certainly to be regarded as displacement activity. There is hardly any
behaviour pattern that can take on so many meanings as the avian
displacement activity of preening. Besides its particularly frequent use
as courtship behaviour it can be used as a threat, as with cranes, and as
a prelude to mating, as among Goosanders and Rock Doves. In the
last-named case there are, to be sure, very real doubts as to whether
the preening ceremony has arisen from a real transition and not as
symbolic activity from an autochthonous act, in about the same way
as Heinroth (q.v.) proposes for the origin of drinking.

When several drakes have gathered in the way in which I have
described above, the mounting of their specific courtship-impulse is
expressed first by a special position of their body and feathers. The
head is drawn in firmly between the shoulders so that the white neck
ring disappears completely. The under feathers are lightly ruffled so
that the bird swims imposingly high on the water, while the back
feathers are held very smooth in an " intended " contrast to the usual
position of rest. The head feathers are erected as high as possible so
that, seen from almost every angle, the green sheen disappears and
gives place to a deep velvety black (Fig. 9). This position differs
from the one that a Mallard takes just before normal autochthonous
action of shaking itself only in the fact that it is often held for several
minutes. In ordinary shaking the drawing in of the head and the

ruffling of the feathers lasts only a few seconds. The experienced
observer can tell from their progression exactly when the shaking will
actually happen, just as one can foretell pretty well the moment of
sneezing by the amount of preliminary drawing up of another's face.
In the Mallard drake's " social-play " one has not only to wait much
longer for the shaking but when it does occur it is not followed by relax-
ation or release from the preparatory position. Indeed the first shaking,
in which the head, strangely restrained, is thrust upward timidly and
with nervous haste (Fig. io) is followed in a few seconds by a second

and a third shaking. The intensity of the action then increases very
gradually each time until finally the shaking movement seems to
hoist the drake high out of the water as though he had a cramp. When
this degree of intensity is reached there follows, almost regularly,
instead of another shaking one of the three actions of courtship that
I am now going to describe, i.e. the grunt-whistle, down-up movement,
and the head-up-tail-up, whereupon all the drakes perform at each
other. The whole company is relaxed for a while and stop courting,
or else they begin again after a short pause with a preliminary shaking
of less intensity. The preliminary shaking is certainly a substitute
activity. It is found in all ducks except Spatula.

5. The Grunt-Whistle.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993946" page_id="56288282"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
As in ordinary shaking the bill is first lowered so that the shaking
action begins under the water and continues above it (Fig. 11 a).
This lowering is so decided that the end of the bill, at the first transverse
movement, cuts the surface and throws up a shower of little drops in
a high arch. This circumstance was not observed by any previous
describer of drake courtship and we ourselves discovered it first when
we noticed that a line of little black dots always appeared in photo-
graphs of drakes performing the grunt-whistle. The erection of the
body then runs contrary to an ordinary shaking in that the head is so
far forward that the body is standing rather upright in the water while

the head is still quite low, with the bill close to the surface. This
strange bent-in position (Fig. nb) has its mechanical explanation
obviously in the stretching of the wind-pipe, for just at the moment of
its peak there is a loud sharp whistle followed by a deep grunt, while
the head straightens up again and the body sinks back to the surface
of the water. The grunting sounds as if a body of air, compressed by
the whistling, were escaping.
The extent of this grunt-whistle within the order of the Anatinae is
peculiar (cf. Table) in that, on one hand, not all of them have this

behaviour or one homologous to it. On the other hand, the Cairininae,
Aix and Lampronessa and Tadorna tadorna in the Casarcinae, certainly
have a homologous activity even though it is differentiated in a different
direction. Other than the species of the genus Anas in the narrower
sense in which this behaviour pattern is practically the same as the
Mallard, the following have almost the same kind of grunt-whistle :
The Pintail, Dajila acuta , the South American Pintail, D. spinicauda , the
native and the Yellow-billed Teals, Nettion crecca and JV. Jiavirostre , and
probably all the other members of this genus which are unknown to
me as well as the Chestnut-breasted Teal, Virago castanea , and in a
somewhat changed form, the Gadwall, Chaulelasmus strepera. The grunt-
whistle is lacking in the Bahama Duck, Pcecilonetta bahamensis, the
African Red-billed Duck, P. erythrorhyncha , the various species of
Garganey, and the Shoveler.
In view of the intermediate forms between grunt-whistle and shaking
still to be discussed in the Wood Duck and Mandarin, as well as the
intimation of shaking behaviour which comes at the beginning of the
action in the Mallard itself, there can be no doubt that it has had its
phylogenetic origin as a mimic exaggeration of what was originally
a preliminary shaking. While the Mallard and other Anatinae and
the Wood Duck have as reactions, in addition to the usual shaking, two

176 DR. KONRAD LORENZ-STUDIES ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF ANATIN^E
formalizations of this movement, and the Mandarin has no less than
four different courtship movements, distinct from each other and from
the original shaking, there is a peculiar reverse behaviour in Tadorna.
The male has a display shaking very much like the corresponding
behaviour of the Mandarin drake. At the beginning the head is
lowered so as to suggest a grunt-whistle, and then while being shaken
and tossed up a trilling whistle is burped out without the body being
lifted. This movement, so peculiar to the Sheld-Duck, is in contrast to
all other Anatinae that perform homologous movements, its only
shaking movement, which is to say that the original, ordinary shaking
with its mechanical significances, has merged into this reaction. For
example, if one seizes a Sheld-Drake and then lets him go there does
not follow, as would be the case among all other drakes, an ordinary
shaking, but usually the display-gesture described above. From this
one would infer that the feather-straightening effect is much less
important in it than the original movement which is contributory only
in its mechanical effect. I should like to compare the phylogenetic
procedure of this change of a mechanically effective instinctive
movement into a releasing courtship-ceremony with that differentia-
tion of morphological structures which is to be seen in the wing of
a Goat-sucker and an Argus Pheasant. Doubtless these two so distinctive
courtship structures have arisen primarily from the well developed
specific use made of the wing in courtship before their existence.
Now, while out of the Goat-sucker's wing there has, so to speak,
developed a second wing especially for courting, beside which the
original organ of flying has remained pretty well intact and useful,
the Argus' wing has so completely merged into a courting organ that
its original mechanical function has been considerably encroached
upon by its new supplementary function as a releaser. In the same way
with Anas and Aix the original behaviour of shaking remains in
existence alongside the one developed out of it for courtship, while in
the breeding Tadorna male it has disappeared into it.
6 . Head-up-tail-up (making itself short and high).
Along with the grunt-whistle the Mallard male has two other
courting actions that are of equal value, the head-up-tail-up and the
down-up movement. Which of the three comes first after the introduc-
tory shaking seems to be a matter of chance. Heinroth writes that
generally one drake gives the grunt-whistle and the rest of the drakes
involved in the social-play answer with the head-up-tail-up or the
down-up movement. This is, to be sure, frequent but it is not inevitable.
All other possible combinations occur. The head-up-tail-up is perhaps
the most striking of all the drake's courtship actions. It is certainly the
most complicated. First with a loud whistle the drake thrusts his head,
with indrawn chin, backwards and upwards, and at the same time

curves his rump upwards with rump feathers very ruffled, so that the
whole bird becomes extraordinarily short and high. While doing this
the elbows are lifted high so that the curl feathers, sticking up high on
the rump, can be seen from the side (Fig. 12). This phase lasts about

a second, and then the body sinks back to its normal position. The
head alone remains high for a moment, when the bill is pointed to
a particular female among those present at the social-play of the
drakes. In the case of mated ducks it is pointed at the mate (Fig. 13).
In the next moment the drake starts moving and shoots away over the
surface, stretched flat in #C nod-swimming 55 (see above) moving mostly
in a circle around the duck he is wooing (Fig. 14). Toward the end of
the nod-swimming, when the drake is gradually returning to his
normal swimming position his head is now lifted high and the back of

the head is turned to the same duck to which his bill has been pointing
(Fig. 15). Even during the head-up-tail-up and belching out of the
whistle his head feathers take on a peculiar " set ". The feathers are
held flat on the side of the head but bristled in the medial portion so
that the head becomes a narrow but high disk which, seen from the
side, becomes very shiny, in sharp contrast to the dull black ball it was
in the preliminary shaking. During the " nod-swimming " this set is
changed so that all the head feathers are held flat, and only on the
neck does a little area of stiffly lifted feathers remain (Fig. 14). This
placing of the feathers is not understandable until the next phase, the
turning of the head. Then a little
black field in a frame of shiny green
is presented in a striking manner to
the view of the female he is wooing.
This is the place for a word about
the comparative morphology of
this feather placing, wherein the
word " morphology " will denote the
concepts of both the form of the
movement and the organic structure.
The position of the feathers which
are purely functional in the Mallard
are definitely fixed into an un-
changeable form in the Pintail, Teal,
Wood Duck, and Mandarin drakes.
All of the four species named, and
probably many others, possess not only movements homologous to
those of the Mallard but also a corresponding feather-placing. With
them, however, there are also colour and form characteristics, which
show that the same lines that are apparent on the head of the Mallard
drake, only in the various arrangements of the feathers, are permanent
morphological characters. The disk-like " set ", which the Mallard
shows at the moment of " burping ", has its sharp border exactly at
the place where, in the Teal, there runs the fine white line that
separates the green of the spectacle around the eye from the dull colour
of the top of the head. In the male Wood Duck there is not only the
same fine white line, but also a lengthening of the feathers which
causes an obvious projection of the border marked in the Teal only
by a line. The hoods of Lampronessa and Aix serve in the first instance
as a " disk-set ". In the Mandarin drake the same line is marked more
clearly by the border of the white temples against the bright colours
of the top of the head, and with it the lengthening of the feathers goes
so far that the obviously projecting border exists even when the feathers
are at rest. In the Pintail drake the " disk-dress " is less clear than in the
Mallard but in his case the turning of the back of the head is especially

developed (see also Fig. 23) in conjunction with erection of the neck
feathers. The black velvet cushion that appears in this position in the
Mallard drake's neck has become in Dajila acuta a permanent morpho-
logical characteristic. His corresponding feathers are not only, as we
know, a deep black, edged at right and left by a white line, but they
are also longer than the surrounding feathers so that in the feather-
placing part of the head-turning behaviour a prominent feather
bolster appears. There is no doubt that in all these body and feather
movements, the movement is older than the organs which has become differen-
tiated in such a way as to increase the optical effect. The wide systematic
distribution of the movements, and the much narrower distribution
of the specific feather structures and colours, as well as the clear
relationship of the latter to all the behaviour patterns underlying
them as a common basis, and obviously present in the family a very
long time, leaves no other theory possible. It is also proved by the
fact that the distinctive body movements are present in quite the
same way as in the Mallard, in males of other species of Anas which
have not special display plumage. The placing of the head feathers
is also traceable in them but to a lesser extent than in the ducks that
have head feathers that are either very shiny or very long.
The distribution of the head-up-tail-up is much less widespread in
this family than is the grunt-whistle (see Table). In addition to the
members of the genus Anas proper, it occurs only in the Pintail and in
the European Teal, as well as in the male Bahama Duck, where it
represents a movement of courtship It is interesting that it is lacking
in the drake of Dajila spinicauda. In Nettion Jlavirostre parts of the move-
ment exist, i.e. burping and subsequent turning of the head to the
female. We can as yet form no theory about the origin of the head-up-
tail-up. As with the grunt-whistle the strong bending of the backbone
has obviously something to do with the tightening of the windpipe
at the burping out of the whistle, but we cannot decide yet whether
the movement itself is derived from an instinctive behaviour, originally
operating mechanically, or developing through symbol or displace-
ment activities.
7. The Down-Up Movement.
Instead of the grunt-whistle and the head-up-tail-up a third move-
ment may follow, in which the drake thrusts his bill into the water as
quick as lightning, and in the next movement jerks up his head alone
without lifting his breast (Fig. 16), which is still low in the water. At
the instant when the head is highest and the breast is deepest there
follows the whistle, just when there is the greatest tension on the wind-
pipe. In raising the bill a little fountain is often raised by the quick bill
movement which, because of the short reaction time of a bird, may
react optically on the duck. Right after this very brief movement the

drake says his " raebraeb " quite quickly and with lifted chin. More
than in other courtship movements one has the impression from the
down-up that the drakes must be influencing each other in some way
for, with a frequency far beyond the probability of mere chance,
practically all the drakes of a courtship-society perform this movement.
Then after the ensuing " raebraeb 55 palaver the courtship ends for
the time being.
The down-up is the only behaviour occurring in social play that is
used occasionally also at other times and then only in a quite definite

movement and the other at the highest, which

raised on the surface by the great rapidity of the
movement.
situation, as in a " raebraeb " of maximum intensity, which is particu-
larly common after a disturbance, or after a fight between two drakes.
The distribution of the down-up movement is restricted to the closer
relatives of the Mallard and is, so to speak, the reverse of the head-up-
tail-up. Except for the species of Anas in the narrowest sense it is
found in a homologous way only in the Gadwall and the different
species of Wigeon. An apparently homologous differentiation is found
in Virago castanea. It is lacking in all kinds of Pintails and Teals, which
are otherwise so like the Mallards in courtship behaviour. One possibly
homologous courtship movement is the extreme lifting of the head,
which is the most important courtship movement of the male Rosy-
billed Pochard, Metopiana peposaca.
The origin of the down-up movement can be given with some
probability. It might be a formalized exaggeration of the " drinking "
as found in almost all the Anatinae. If one comprehends the move-
ment of chin lifting done by the Mallard drake after the down-up
movement and also, moreover, at great " raebraeb " palavers, as a
stage of weaker intensity of the down-up, then we get a somewhat
wider distribution of the movement within the family, and at the same
time a clearer relationship to the drinking. In the male Wood Duck at
times much chin lifting and head turning follows " drinking 95 .

Often individual drakes without any particular movement, but at
the exact instant when the remaining members of the courtship
society utter the whistle, make a peculiar hoarse sound. One can
imitate it best by saying a three-syllabled " chachacha ", while breath-

drakes, or those whose reactions are not yet strong. I have heard it in
the same way, but given from a correspondingly different position,

Fighting Mallard drakes, with necks drawn in, grab each other by
the feathers of the crop and shove each other hard, with one trying to
shove the other back. Early in the spring one sees round bare places,
the result of this specific manner of fighting. Only when the excitement
of the fight is very great do the drakes begin to hit each other with the
shoulder of the wing. It is then seen that the peculiar position of the
head, neck shortened, was predetermined by the proximity of this
additional action. Other Anatinae that hit with the shoulder in
fighting hold their opponent with the neck drawn in tightly against
the breast exactly at the spot where the shoulder hits.
10. The Post-Coital Play.
In the Mallard drake this is marked by a special behaviour. Imme-
diately after treading, while still hanging on, the drake suddenly
flings his head and neck far down his back ; without lifting them high.
Often in this act he is still holding the neck feathers of the female in his
bill so that her head is pulled backward (Fig. 17). Then, as if this
backward movement had been only the introduction to an exaggerated
mimic nod, the drake shoots away with the typical behaviour of nod-

swimming, and circles around the duck, just as after the head-up-tail-up
behaviour. This behaviour of flinging the head upward and backward,
for which we shall use the term " bridling ", appears often as an
insertion in the head-up-tail-up, and it follows the lifting of the head and
turning of the bill to the female, with the subsequent nod-swimming,
in exactly the same way as it follows the mating.
The same post-coital play is found in all species of Anas , in JVettion
Jlavirostre (whether in crecca or not I do not know) and Virago castanea.
In both of the last named forms the " bridling " enters in as a quite
independent behaviour in social-play (Table). In N. Jlavirostre there
is no subsequent nod-swimming, and in V. castanea it is either quite
isolated, or linked up in a single tight chain of actions that begins with
the grunt-whistle and closes with nod-swimming and head-turning.

formerly common on all the larger ones excepting Lanai, is now
reduced to approximately 300 birds and found only on Kauai. The
reasons for its decline are the familiar ones of land drainage and
consequent disappearance of feeding and breeding areas ; indiscrimi-
nate shooting and, perhaps the most serious of all, the introduction
some sixty years ago to all the main islands except Kauai of the
mongoose. Now, as with all other native birds, a strict protection is
in force, so there is reason to hope that this small Mallard may yet be
saved from extinction.
The sexes are much alike and in general appearance rather resemble
females of the common Mallard but for being no more than half the
size. The drake differs in having the top of the head darker and
indistinctly greenish ; orange-yellow legs and feet and the two central
tail-feathers slightly upturned. If there is a breeding and an eclipse
plumage they are scarcely discernible one from the other, but in the
spring of this year we thought that the drake of the pair at Slimbridge
looked a little smarter than usual and rather more greenish on the top
of the head. They appear to be fairly hardy. There are a few pairs in
captivity ; one at San Diego Zoo, at least two at Honolulu Zoo (where
they breed), and one which Mr. Paul Breese, the Director, kindly
presented to the Severn Wildfowl Trust.
This pair, the first to be brought alive to Europe, laid two clutches
of eight eggs this year from which seven young have been reared.
The downy young are much like the young of the Yellow-billed
[A. u. undulata) in general coloration and have similar faint facial
markings.

(Anas angustirostris)
By Terry Jones (Leckford, Hants, England)
We received five of these little ducks from the Severn Wildfowl
Trust as ducklings in 1948. They had been flown from Basra to
England when five or six weeks old.
Till they came I had never seen a live specimen and was very pleased
to have them. In size the drakes are about the same as a female
Bahama Pintail. The colour a dusty grey-fawn, each feather being
lighter in the middle than at the edges. A dark streak passes through
the eye. Peter Scott first noticed their striking resemblance to a very
small pale-coloured Crested Duck. Unlike the other surface feeding
duck they have no coloured speculum bar. And most extraordinary of
all the ducks don't quack or growl like all other female surface feeding
and diving duck. I did not know of this and for some time was
puzzled as to what the sexes of my ducks were. They looked like two
males and three females, but three had a high weak double note,
" pleep-pleep ", rather like a very faint edition of a Common Teal
drake's call. These proved to be the females. As far as I know no other
female duck other than Tree Duck has a high-pitched whistling note.
The drake's voice is one of those little nasal squeaks which are so
difficult to describe, a similar sort of note to the Bahama Pintail or
Cape Teal drakes. Before calling the neck is stretched vertically and
then jerked backwards and downwards on to the back and the little
call made. The duck does not do this.
In 1949 they did not breed, but in the spring of 1950 they settled
down as a pair and a trio. The two drakes did not quarrel with each
other, though the ducks of one drake would chase away the female of
the other when the drakes were displaying. They spent a good deal
of time displaying which considering the very primitive display was
rather surprising. The drakes when doing this sat on the water with their
necks drawn in, often changing their position suddenly in relation to
the other drake or to the duck nearest them, as do most surface feeding
drakes. Most drakes I have noticed prefer to be side on or nearly side on
to the bird they are showing off to. Suddenly up would go the neck,
the little crest sticking out behind and equally suddenly down it would
come backwards into the shoulders followed by the little note exactly
as when merely calling. The sole difference being that the bird
displaying was conscious of his position in relation to the others when
displaying. Sometimes a drake would rise in the water with a shake
as do Mallard or Teal drakes.

had been fixed in a willow tree for Mandarins. This barrel was about

five feet from the ground with a rough ladder leading up to it. The
eggs are very small, 13 mm. by 11 mm. in diameter and are of a
pale creamy white. The clutches are large, 12, 10, 10 were the clutches
laid by the two ducks. Just before the clutch is finished the nest is well
lined with down : this is light grey of an even tone. The second duck
laid in a burrow constructed for Sheld-Duck. The second clutch of
the second duck was placed in the side of the stem of the tall carex
which grows here. This plant makes fibrous trunks about a foot in
diameter and three feet high. The grass-like leaves and inflorences
come out of the top and the sides are hidden by a layer of drooping
dead leaves. Water voles often dig out, or rather cut out, little landing
places in the sides of these trunks where they may safely sit unseen.
It was in one of these little hollows that the duck nested. Incubation
is twenty-five days. The ducklings have the typical Mallard or Teal
down pattern, but in two shades of greyish fawn, the darker markings
being the fawner. A very good down pattern for a bird from semi-
desert places I should imagine. The colour of the legs and toes are
a bright greenish grey-blue and the webs a khaki colour. The ducklings
are terrible jumpers. We put two broods hatched the same day into
two coops with their bantam foster-mothers. In the runs right up
against the coop spars we placed very shallow dishes partly filled with
gravel and about an inch of water. In this water swam an attractive
assortment of shrimps and various fly larvae, also a little fine biscuit
meal. But the ducklings jumped against the coop sides, climbed their
foster-mother's backs and jumped and jumped and jumped. As
anyone who has reared Carolina or Mandarin knows a jumping
duckling is a non-feeding duckling. Once they start feeding they give
up jumping. We pushed the little beggars out into the dishes, we
dipped their beaks in the water, but all they did was jump. We were
in dispair. The first brood started looking hump-backed and were
obviously going to die soon. Then I had a brainwave. I rushed to my
pigeon cote and tore the glass panes out of the windows, the only
pieces of glass handy which were large enough to cover the coop tops.
We removed the coop lids and substituted the panes of glass. The
light now was as brilliant inside as out and the ducklings stopped
jumping. Soon they were feeding. The older brood died off badly, but
the second was saved in time. For several days the wretched hens had
to sit panting in the sun under a pane of glass.
For Mandarin and Carolina in particular we place boards sloping
towards the sun. The ducklings love to sit on the warm boards and
after paddling generally come on to these boards to preen. The slope
causes them to drain quickly and also to heat quickly. No ducklings
we have ever reared liked their boards as much as the baby Marbles
did. Once started they were not particularly difficult to rear. Their
first plumage is similar to the adult, but the markings are less distinct.

By Ralph A. Edwards (Hagensborg, B.G., Canada)
Nearly forty years ago when we first came here the Trumpeter
Swans were in the habit of wintering in this area from the last of
October to April. They made out fairly well in mild winters, except
for the occasional bird shot by Indians for food and feathers. But
when the cold winters came along they lost most of their cygnets.
(They come here in family groups, and stay as families at least until
spring.) In those early days the flock numbered from twenty to maybe
one hundred and fifty, depending on how difficult the previous winter
had been.
The swans seem to get their food from the black mud which they
dredge from shallow parts of lakes and slow running streams, probably
pond weed seeds and other food matter available in such places.
When bitter winds roared down from the north and all waters froze
up tight the Swans were in the habit of sitting patiently on the ice
waiting for a Chinook wind from the south-west to unlock their food
supply, living in the meantime on the fat accumulated the previous
summer. That was when the cygnets, having spent the summer in
growth instead of laying on of fat, succumbed.
After a particularly hard winter with heavy losses the Canadian
Federal Government decided to try feeding the birds during such
times. At first the feeding was carried on in a rather hit and miss way.
One difficulty was the extreme wildness of the birds, and another was
the isolated location of Lonesome Lake, thirty some odd miles from
the end of the road, about seventy-five miles from salt water. But the
Trumpeters gradually acquired confidence in their feeder and after
a catastrophic flood with landslides blocking outlets of lakes, raising
the water so the swans could no longer reach large parts of the lake
bottoms previously available, and because owing to less speed of flow
the water froze with less cold, the feeding was placed on a daily ration
basis, which proved effective in preserving the species in this area.
Their numbers climbed from some thirty odd to around one hundred
in five years, during several of which we had record cold winters.
Whole barley at the rate of \ lb. per bird per day is fed at noon each
day during the time the lakes and rivers are frozen over. There are
nearly always some open bits of water in swift streams and springy
places, but when the thermometer drops to 20 below zero we have to
chop ice to get open water to feed in. The Swans will pick the barley
off snow but they tramp too much of it into the snow and then cannot
get it.
The accompanying illustration shows the Trumpeters feeding in the
river as it flows through our place. Lonesome Lake lies between the
hills in background. The name of the river is Atnarko.

By Gwen E. Colwell (Kleena Kleene, B.C., Canada)
(Reprinted from The Vancouver Daily Province)
Whirring wings stirred the snow-chilled air on that New Year's
morning of 1945. . . . Lives in isolation are always cheered by such
sounds for thus is heralded the advent of spring. However, this was
much too early in the year to expect the annual migration, so we
wasted no time in running out to see what it was all about. From the
river came splashing sounds, and so towards these sounds we turned
our steps.
The Kleena Kleene River which carries the snow of Perkins Moun-
tain in its winding passage to Knight's Inlet, passes within fifty feet of
our front door. At this point in its journey, being warmed by One
Eye Lake from which it has just emerged, the water does not easily
freeze over.
In this patch of open water five guests had alighted. They were
moving gracefully about giving little heed to our presence. We
identified them, unmistakably, as Trumpeter Swans. Their silvery
shadowed plumage bespoke their youth.
Our first thought was to secure a permanent pictorial record of the
Royal Visit. With the greatest possible speed and stealth we slipped
up to the house, secured our cameras, and returned with trembling
eagerness to avail ourselves of the opportunity of a lifetime--pictures
of the rare Trumpeters. Slipping into a tree's shadow we used up two
films and felt lucky to have got within fifty feet of the Swans. After
this we moved about more freely, feeling that should the Swans take
fright at our proximity we had our pictures for the records.
Imagine our astonishment when the birds continued to swim about
--to dive for and feed upon the luscious river grass. They gave no hint
of alarm at our presence and moved even closer to the bank on which
we stood. An occasional low-pitched trumpet sound, characteristic of
this bird, was the only intimation of their awareness of us.
If we were astonished at the Royal Visit still more were we surprised
to find that they had come for a lengthy sojourn. For two months they
remained. We threw grain into the water but, though interested, they
seemed not to understand that it was food. The second day we decided
upon a practical lesson. A young wild goose, the last survivor of his
family, had adopted us and stayed when his cousins flew south. What
a perfect chance ! Peter, our goose, was fed his breakfast that morning
on the ice ledge along the river bank. In no time the swans showed
interest and were soon literally shovelling in mouths full of wheat. They
would dive for the grain we threw into the shallows but refused cut
carrots.

They became so tame that they would scramble on to the ice when
they saw us coming. Before many days had passed Peter was fighting
a losing battle at meal times and we had to provide a separate spot for
his grain and to police it until he had taken his fill. At the end of the
first week they had found their way to the house door. They would
parade up and down, necks stretched--bright eyes focussed on the
windows. Soft trumpet calls would always attract our attention.
By this time they were tame enough to take grain out of a tin held
in our hands. They would take bread or cake from our hands. Their
appetites were enormous. We fed them a coffee tin filled with grain
three times a day with lots of other odds and ends. This, of course,
was only supplemental to the natural food they garnered for them-
selves out of the river. After being fed, they would sit about outside
the house--either watching, or just sleeping. Upon several occasions
we had all five huge birds in the telegraph office at one time. They
literally filled the room. Indeed, one felt that should they become
alarmed and decide to take to the air, the roof would, in all likelihood,
be carried off on their backs.
One day the boldest of them ventured inside the back door of the
house and spent some time in exploring the enamel finish on the range
with his bill. They were great company for the goose, even though
bowing to their authority made him quite jealous. He would join
them in their flights. Being so much smaller than they, he could take
off and land with greater ease. Once airborne the swans could easily
outdistance him. That is, when flying in straight line--as soon as the
swans began to circle, Peter, putting on an extra spurt, would cut
across the arc and come in for the blue ribbon. We, on our part, would
shout our cheers from below, and Peter seemed to understand.
On the last day of February the goose deserted the swans in our
favor. He followed us every time we went outside. If we were
indoors he would stand at the door making disturbed little honks.
Being stupid humans we could not guess the reason. At five o'clock on
the morning of March i, Peter and his pals took to the air. They
circled twice over the house as a final salute ; set their course to the
north--and were gone.
Why they came here is a mystery. Some think that they had
strayed from Lonesome Lake, where Trumpeters have been fed for
years on grain provided by the government. The argument against
this, of course, is the fact that the birds quite evidently knew nothing
of grain feeding until they learned from the goose.
Why they have never returned we shall never know.

By R. S. Mackensen (Yardley, Pa., U.S.A.)
For the past several years my father, William J. Mackensen, and
I have been rather successful in rearing the Cinnamon Teal (Anas
cyanoptera). We are both very enthusiastic about these splendid little
ducks and would like to share a few of our observations concerning
their activities and breeding habits at our farm in Pennsylvania.
We secured our original breeding pair from Mr. M. R. Cheesman,
of Utah, who has been the outstanding breeder of many species of
wild North American ducks for many years. Through several genera-
tions of mating the female progeny of this pair with wild males, we
have developed a prolific strain well adapted to captivity.
We find that these tiny ducks seek a mate before they are even a year
old and remain strongly bound, even during the winter months between
breeding seasons. Their natural beauty, delicate size, and friendly
manners make them a great favourite of many collectors.
They usually breed during their first year and are among the
earliest to nest, getting busy at the very onset of spring. If cover is
close by they do not wander more than a few feet from the water to
nest. Since they breed before the natural cover has become dense
enough, we have found that it is advantageous to place about groups
of evergreen branches under which they readily nest, thus concealing
them from the ever-searching Grows, Hawks, etc.
Their nests are not too well-made, containing barely enough
material for them to cover their eggs while they are laying their
clutch. If we find a nest, we prefer to substitute dummy bantam eggs
rather than to chance having the true eggs stolen by some predator.
The eggs are about the size of a very small bantam egg, creamy white,
and usually ten per clutch.
The drake travels with the duck until she has found a suitable site
to nest. Once she has started laying, he stays in the water while she
goes off to her nest. She lays an egg approximately every 36 hours.
By the time all but one or two eggs have been laid, she becomes very
broody, feathers her nest, and is most reluctant to leave it. In fact,
many of them set so close that you may stroke their backs without their
moving. Of course this boldness makes them quite vulnerable and it
is easy to understand why they fall easy prey to any predators who may
gain entrance to their pen.
When we are sure that the clutch has been completed, we destroy
the nest, since the duck will continue setting for several days even after
all eggs have been removed. We then incubate the eggs under close
supervision, using a small hybrid bantam. Occasionally after two or
three weeks the same female will lay again.
The incubation period is 26 to 28 days and fertility always runs

very high (about 90 per cent). The young have good vitality and are
easily raised if protected carefully from predators. They grow and
feather quickly, being full-sized and completely feathered in a few
weeks. Of course the males do not assume their coloured plumage
until fall. However, they may be early identified by their brighter
wing speculums and their yellow eyes, in comparison with the brown
eyes of the females.
Breeders and young are fed entirely upon free choice of chicken
pellets with a small amount of wheat mixed in. This can be supple-
mented with greens of some sort, but it is not actually necessary.
The young are kept in small, well-guarded enclosures with their
bantam foster-mothers until they are completely feathered, at which
time they are moved to the pond and have their first try at swimming
--the bantam going back to her drab life in the hen house.

QUEER BEHAVIOUR OF BARNACLE GEESE
By Jean Delacour

There are three Barnacle Geese at Cleres at present, one male and
two females, reared by Major Pam in a brooder five years ago.
From the beginning of the time when they arrived, one female was
taken with a sudden and overwhelming love for one of the wild
Turkeys which she has ever since faithfully followed about everywhere.
The Turkey simply ignores the goose. Up to this last winter the other
two Barnacles lived together in the park, behaving as a normal pair,
but I was astonished last April, on my arrival from America, to find
that the second Barnacle female had imitated the first one and attached
herself to another cock Turkey ! This shows what a bad example can
do. Each goose follows and loves her own Turkey and chases away
the others. This is all the stranger as these Barnacles had never seen
a Turkey before coming to Cleres. When they meet, the female
Barnacles are rather cross to each other. The lonely male seems to
live happily, if singly, among the other Geese of the park. In July,
however, his lawful wife, tired of the Turkey's indifference, I presume,
rejoined him. Neither of these female Barnacles has ever laid.

Members of the Club, 41 ; guests, 29 ; total, 70.
The Chairman, opening the meeting, the first of the seventh session,
described briefly the formation and progress of the Club since its
foundation in 1946, and said it was a matter for general congratulation
that it had gone from strength to strength.
On behalf of the Club the Chairman said she would like to extend
a special welcome to Mr. J. D. Macdonald, in charge of the Bird Room
at the Natural History Museum. Aviculturists were greatly indebted
to him for his unfailing courtesy and patience in identifying birds,
and she was glad to have this opportunity of thanking him for all the
help he had so willingly given.
The Chairman went on to say that ornithology and aviculture
seemed to have a special attraction for medical men, and many
distinguished doctors were foremost in these fields of study. The Club
had great pleasure in welcoming Dr. and Mrs. Telford Work, from
California, who had studied and photographed birds in many parts
of the world.
Dr. Work said he was pleased to show his films to the Club. He and
his wife were due to leave England and it was fitting that one of their
last evenings should be spent amongst bird-lovers. The colour films

Some fifty members and friends accepted the invitation of the
Duke of Bedford and visited Woburn Park on the afternoon of 7th July.
The Duke met the party at the Lion Lodge, and conducted it round
his 20,000 acre estate. The weather, for once, was perfect.
In the course of the drive round, stops were made to view the
aviaries, homing Budgerigar " lofts ", the lily pools with their
innumerable Golden Carp, the orangery, and, in the woods, the giant
cedars. The party was able to approach quite close to the 300-strong
herd of Pere David's Deer. Amongst the many other deer were
Manchurian Sika, Chinese Water-deer, Reeve's Muntjac, Indian
Swamp, and, of course, Fallow.
Some American and a dozen or so of the much rarer European
Bison were of particular interest.
To many the highlight of the visit was the sight of the three young
blue Indian Ring-necked Parrakeets, only out of the nest the previous
week. (N.B. The aviary was securely locked !)
All were profuse in thanks to the Duke for a memorable and very
enjoyable afternoon. This was the first visit of the Society to Woburn.
It was an unqualified success, and the general hope was that it might
be possible to make it an annual event.

I. Baty has reared three young birds which he believes are Twite X
Siskin hybrids. The only doubt is that there was a male Siskin in
the aviary, although it took no part in the proceedings. This cross
is a very unusual one. The only record appears to be to the credit of
G. L. Hey, of Luton : two nests of four each reared in 1937. There is,
however, no doubt about the eleven Elegant Parrakeets, reared by three
pairs (3, 3, and 5).

Mrs. G. T. Clark does not normally breed hybrids, but sometimes
birds have their own ideas or odd birds need mates. A cock Barnard
definitely and persistently refused a hen of his own kind, and decided
to take for a wife a Golden-mantled X Mealy Rosella. Result, four
nice young ones flying.
Last year seven (nests of four and three) Queen Alexandra's X
Barraband's Parrakeet hybrids were reared. The parents again have
young this year.

H. Murray has bred the South American Black-crested Finch
(Lophospingus pusillus) ; one young one reared.
Before the war this was known in the trade as the 44 Pigmy
Cardinal ". Dr. Amsler was successful in breeding it in 1939. The
female parent was killed by a Thrush the day after the two young ones
left the nest, but the male, nevertheless, succeeded in rearing them
unaided. Allen Silver also bred this bird about the same time, but
Dr. Amsler just beat him for a 44 first ".

In the last number we announced an increase of io per cent in the
cost of printing the Magazine. Now we have to report an additional
increase of 7 \ per cent to cover a cost-of-living bonus agreed between
the Master Printers and the Printing Trades Unions.
Each number of the Magazine costs over twice as much as before
the war. Once more we would impress on members the fact that
they are members of a Society , and not just subscribers to a Magazine,
and that it is incumbent on them to help the Society in every way
possible.

By G. S. Webb
An interesting breeding result has been that of SchlegePs Dove
(Calopelia puella). Two were hatched in late June and successfully
reached maturity. This species, known also under the names of
Cinnamon Dove and Odu Dove, is probably the prettiest of the
African Columbidae, being mainly cinnamon in colour with a blue
head. It is a West African species, living in the wild state in forests
where it finds its food--fallen berries and seeds--on the ground. In
this respect it resembles the Lemon-Doves (. Aplopelia ). As far as
I know this is the first breeding record of the species.
Another interesting event in the pigeon world is that our Pheasant-
tailed Pigeons ( Otidiphaps nobilis aruensis) have at last gone to nest
and have laid one egg. They have been in an enclosure on their own
since May, 1950, with a shelter entirely cut off from public gaze and
we were beginning to despair of any happy result. However, one can
hardly blame birds from the Aru Islands delaying their nesting activi-
ties in a year like this wondering if summer would ever arrive. It will
be grand if this effort ends in success as this species is not only rare in
captivity but is extremely interesting on account of its gallinaceous
appearance and habits.
Something of even greater interest is the nesting of a pair of Grey-
winged Trumpeters ( Psophia crepitans ). Two eggs were laid in a wooden
tray high up in the aviary shelter and a third egg, unfortunately
cracked, was found on the floor. These are large, white, and sharply
tapering. They were laid at infrequent intervals, the female spending
a certain amount of time on the tray but not sitting tightly. However,
a few days after the laying of the last egg both birds took to incubating
in earnest. When the female flies down from the nest, the male rushes
up to her, bows a few times, then flies up to the nest to take his turn.
As is well known Trumpeters usually show no inclination to breed in
captivity though they invariably become exceedingly tame, so we are

awaiting results with interest. There are no golden rules for breeding
certain birds in captivity. Some pairs under the most natural conditions
will never attempt to breed and others, as is the case with our Trum-
peters, will go to nest with no particular privacy and in a mixed com-
pany of birds.
We have recently witnessed a complete departure from a bird's
normal nesting habits. A pair of Goldfinches in our British Aviary
made their nest on the ground under a tuft of grass. This was so well
concealed that it was not noticed until the young were hatched. These
were all reared.
We had no luck with the Stone Curlews or Thick-knees reported as
nesting in my last notes. Both birds took part in the incubation and
one, which we took to be the male, was always on close guard and
attacked the keepers if they approached. However, after the hen had
sat well beyond the maximum incubation period the eggs were found
to be infertile, within a week of the end of this episode two more eggs
were laid and we concluded that they were laid by the supposed male.
A King Penguin chick was hatched on 31st August. It is doing well
and is being cared for, and fed by regurgitation, by both parents. As
is the case with the single egg the chick is supported on the feet of one
of the parents with the fold of skin on the stomach lowered to form a
perfect downy covering. This seems much more promising than the
one hatched last year which died when 2 days old as this mother is
much more attentive. Another factor may be that we have switched
to whiting which is apparently much more suitable to the young King
Penguins than herring.

London, 1951. 7 s. 6 d. net.
This third volume continues the excellent series on records of
Parrots bred in captivity, and like its two predecessors is excellently
set out and full of valuable information. Sixty-two species are dealt
with in the volume and, as in the first two volumes, the indices of
both English and scientific names are most helpful Parrots are the
group most favoured by aviculturists and the many people all over
the world who keep these birds have reason to be greatly indebted
to Mr. Prestwich for producing the detailed records of their breeding
in captivity in such a practical form to which quick and easy reference
can be made.

The Report contains a list of all the species in the Trust's collection
with notes on important additions and new species. An excellent
table of hatching and rearing includes much information on each
species concerned, such as number of breeding pairs, date of first egg,
number of eggs, what happened to the eggs (whether hatched,
destroyed by vermin, broken by hen, etc.), percentage of young
hatched, and percentage of young reared. A section of the Report
is devoted to observations on the wild geese, ducks, and other birds
occurring in the neighbourhood. The volume concludes with a series
of short descriptions of the swans and geese of the British Isles by
the Hon. Director, Peter Scott, illustrated with four attractive plates
in colour, by the author, of the Swans, the Black Geese, the Grey
Geese, and the Snow Geese. The Report is also profusely illustrated
with photographs and a number of charming pen and ink sketches
by Peter Scott.

Hartlaub's Duck (Cairina hartlaubi) in Captivity.
This beautiful African counterpart of the Muscovy has always been rare in captivity,
and so far has not bred in confinement. It was gratifying to hear that three pairs
have recently joined the collection of the Severn Wildfowl Trust. As far as I know,
four specimens have previously been kept at the Antwerp Zoo, and also a female at
the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, between 1925 and 1935 about. Some lived up to five or
six years and proved hardy and easy to feed. There are at present two males and a
female in perfect condition at the New York Zoological Park, brought from the
Belgian Congo by C. Cordier in 1949. These birds are quiet in their ways, but savage
towards other waterfowl. The two males cannot be kept together.

A Long-lived Laughing Kingfisher.
A Laughing Kingfisher (Dacelo gigas ) has just died at the Zoological Gardens,
Belle Vue, Manchester, after thirty years' residence in the Parrot House. The King-
fisher remained in good health almost to the end and was certainly in good voice
only a day or so before it died. Besides the usual flesh diet, this specimen used to
relish an occasional grape.

It was with considerable interest that I read the article by that famous aviculturist,
Mr. Edward Boosey, in the July-August issue of our Magazine and noticed that he
claimed to be the first to cross-breed Pheasants and Bantams and produce what he
calls " Phantoms ".
I venture to challenge this claim, not only as regards the breeding itself, but also
as to the name of the product ! Let me now proceed to substantiate my own claim.
During the heavy snowfall which occurred in April last year, the area of rural
Surrey, in which I live, was heavily affected and several of my aviaries collapsed under
the weight of the snow, with consequent chaos to their inhabitants, where no less than
eight trios, chiefly Pheasants, had been already mated up. The result of the mix-up
was that a cock Sebright Bantam mated with a Hen Golden Pheasant, and at the
subsequent hatching, two unusual chicks appeared. At the time their colourings did
not greatly differ from that of other Pheasant chicks, but they were unusually active,
even at a very early age. Both have survived, are still in my possession, and it is
interesting to note that in spite of the colourings of their parents, they are rather
uninteresting to the eye, their colour being a dull brownish black. At the time
I christened them " Phantoms " and the name has stuck to them ever since.
While sympathizing with Mr. Boosey over his bad luck in losing his bird, I feel he
will be interested to hear the story I have related of my accidental breeding.

LIBERTY SHAMAS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98650519047619" page_id="56288310"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
In reading Mr. Dulanty's interesting account of his Shamas at controlled liberty,
I was struck by the very odd coincidence that his hen, as well as a hen of a pair we
had at controlled liberty at Keston before the war, should both have come to grief
in the same way--namely by drowning themselves.
As, therefore, hen Shamas at liberty appear partial to this form of suicide, rt would
seem that anyone who is contemplating trying this very fascinating branch of avi-
culture next season would be well-advised to see that any open water-butts, tanks,
etc., that they may have in their garden are safely covered over before they let out
their Shamas.
I see Mr. Dulanty thinks his hen was drowned when attempting to bathe in a water-
butt. Our hen, however, always had her bath among some irises in the shallow water
at the edge of a lily pool, so the fact that she was found drowned in a half-filled sunken
watering tank in our greenhouse was, I feel certain, explained by the presence of
a very small drowned mouse in the same tank. Both our Shamas were ardent mousers
and I have little doubt that the hen was chasing this one when, in desperation, it
either fell or jumped into the tank, and she must have plunged in after it. It was a
very sad ending to a fascinating experiment, particularly as the Shamas had a brood
of four young ones just on the point of fledging, all of which were dead by the time
the body of their drowned mother was discovered.

THE REARING OF A HYBRID VIRGINIAN x
EUROPEAN EAGLE-OWL AT DUDLEY ZOO
</sectionHeader>

By D. H. S. Risdon (Dudley, Worcs., England)
As there appear to be several records of the straight breeding of
both the Virginian and European Eagle-Owls, a hybrid between the
two species is perhaps not very surprising, but nevertheless, as it seems
to be the first authenticated cross, I thought it worth while recording
in the Magazine.
Both parents are among the oldest inhabitants of Dudley Zoo.
In fact, they came to Dudley as part of the original collection from
Oxford Zoo on the latter's disbandment in 1937, so their actual age
is not known.
On reading through Mr. Prestwich's Records of Birds of Prey Bred in
Captivity , one gathers that success with Eagle-Owls generally comes
when the birds have been many years in captivity, first efforts usually
ending either with infertile eggs or callow young being killed and
eaten by the parents.
Infanticide is, I believe, often the experience with birds of prey
deprived of live food, the explanation being that the desire to kill
their own prey overwhelms the parental instinct to such an extent
that the old birds cannot resist making a meal of their offspring.
It would appear, however, that after many years in captivity, this
appetite passes, and then success is achieved.
I experienced rather a similar occurrence many years ago with
Blackbirds. For the first two years the old pair let their young die
from lack of live insects, but in the third and successive years I saw
them taking artificial food to the nest and young were successfully
reared.
To return to the Owls at Dudley, this particular pair behaved true
to form. Incidentally, the Virginian is the cock, and he has been
blind in one eye for a long time. From what I can gather, the pair
have shared the same enclosure on and off for many seasons. The hen
has laid regularly, but whether she has been with the Virginian or not
her eggs have always been infertile.
Last year, my first season at Dudley, the European Eagle-Owl was

in an aviary by herself. In the spring she made a scrape on the gravel
floor of the flight right in the open and laid two or three eggs, of
course infertile.
This spring, however, due to shortage of space, the old one-eyed
Virginian, of whose sex incidentally we were in some doubt until this
year, was again put with the European, and to give her a fair chance
a heap of rough dried grass was placed in the darkest corner of the
concrete floor of the shelter shed, behind the door and out of sight of
the public gaze.
As we never really expected success, I am afraid that accurate
records were not kept, but during May a rough nest was made in the
grass. Eggs were laid and incubation commenced. The number of
eggs laid and number of young hatched are not known, as the hen
sat tightly and was never caught off the nest, which she guarded
ferociously, snapping her bill and puffing herself out threateningly at
one's approach.
Between three and four weeks later a careful watch was kept, and
eventually it was reported to me that part of at least one downy young
one had been seen under the hen when she raised herself up in defence
of her nest.
From then on the birds were disturbed as little as possible, and
whenever procurable young rabbits, freshly killed and whilst still
warm, were put in the aviary. There is no doubt, however, that cold
dead " shop " rabbit and butcher's meat were taken as well, and the
youngster grew apace.
Throughout, Mr. Jack Westwood, who looks after the Owls, told
me he never saw the cock actually feed the young one. It took food
in lumps to the nest, which presumably the hen dismembered and fed
to the youngster.
At quite an early age, when still covered in down and less than
half grown, the young one would walk about the floor of the shelter,
occasionally appearing at the doorway to take a look round. Towards
the end of July it became more or less independent of its parents,
and although still partly covered in baby fluff, would sit about in the
open sunning itself. At this stage it could also apparently feed itself,
although it is difficult to say whether or not it still received a helping
hand from its parents.
They have always been shy, and I myself never saw them feed it
in the open at any rate.
Now (mid-September) our young hybrid is almost as big as its
mother the European Eagle-Owl, and considerably larger than its
father, and as the adult feathers appear more and more through the
down it is evident that the markings are going to be a mixture of the
black smudging of the Virginian and the dark streaks of the European.
At present its eyes are the straw colour of the adult Virginian. There

By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
The breeding season of 1951 has been the best I ever remember--
for coccidiosis microbes--and the worst for Parrakeets. This, I fancy,
has been the experience of some other aviculturists also. The excessively
wet winter and the complete absence of anything deserving to be
called spring until the middle of May seemed to affect both the
fertility of the old birds and the stamina of their offspring. (In the latter
connection, it may be interesting to note that the percentage of weakly
Red Deer calves in the Park this summer is quite abnormally large.)
A hen Barraband which bred last year was beginning to come into
breeding condition in April, when she fell a victim to coccidiosis.
A pair of Princess of Wales' hatched two young, but killed one when
nearly feathered by feeding it on unhusked millet, a lazy and
disastrous habit to which individual Grass Parrakeets are also prone.
The survivor, a strong bird but badly plucked by the hen, left the
nest in due course. The hen started to lay again when coccidiosis
claimed her also. The same fate later befell a young hen Rock Peplar
trained as a day-liberty bird. According to my experience, no
treatment will save a Polyteline Parrakeet once it gets coccidiosis, nor
will lactose in the drinking water always prevent it.
The young Princess of Wales', as recorded elsewhere, I trained as
a day-liberty bird, but after some weeks of exemplary behaviour he
unexpectedly blotted his copy-book by flying several miles away and
staying out for the night. He returned early next morning, but
I judged it prudent to shut him up again as, with Rock Peplars, such
behaviour is a prelude to ultimate complete departure. The old
breeding pair of Rock Peplars reared four good young ones, all of
which were successfully trained as day-liberty birds, though one has
been lost from the cause already mentioned. Incidentally, what rot
those people talk who try and make out that if an animal is perfectly
healthy and is fed on wholesome food not grown with the aid of
artificial fertilizers, it can never get ill from microbic infection !
Like many enduring falsehoods, the theory has an element of truth
mingled with it for there are some diseases, notably those caused by
parasitic worms, which some animals can resist better when well
fed than when undernourished ; with this qualification, however,
the theory is, as I have said, rubbish. A bird fed on nourishing seed

and grain, fruit, etc., with access to unlimited wild foods not grown
with artificial fertilizers may be the picture of health, well-grown, in
perfect feather, and abounding in playful energy, and high spirits.
Yet the day comes when it gets a virulent microbic infection. In a few
hours it is sick, and within a few days it is dead.
A hen Barnard that bred successfully last year laid a large clutch of
eggs at the end of April. On 30th April, however, we had a terrific
blizzard, and the aviaries were darkened by a heavy fall of snow.
The Barnard understandably decided that the Australians were right,
after all, in considering April the beginning of winter, and deserted
her nest. Later, when the thaw came, she began to lay again, but got
egg-bound with a malformed egg, and when she had laid it in the
hospital dropped into moult.
Brown's Parrakeets, which bred last year, nested rather late and lost
their young at about ten days old. A young pair of Pileated bred at
Keston, and still in immature plumage, did the same.
Derbyan Parrakeets and Green-winged Kings, both pairs very old
birds, laid two clutches of eggs as they did last year, which, in spite
of wheat germ oil, were infertile.
Crimson-wings reared one young one in their first nest, and then,
very unexpectedly, went to nest again and hatched four more. These
also left the nest, but one broke its leg a day or two later and, as I was
carrying it to the birdroom, it escaped out of my hands and flew
away. It was seen the following morning, but not again. The old
birds are excellent parents, feeding their children when in heavy
moult themselves.
The lutino Nyasa Lovebird and his mate have got no further
than eggs with young dead in the shell. Ordinary Nyasas have
reared five young.
The old albino hen Roseate Cockatoo mated to her son, raised my
hopes by going into a nest quite a lot, but she did not lay.
I was unsuccessful in obtaining a suitable mate for the other white-
bred cock. The first hen I got was bad on her feet from too long
caging. Another bird I selected as a hen in a rather dark room,
behaved exactly like a hen when first turned out in the aviary. When
I got " her ", " she " had a very dark red breast, and I thought a red
eye. " She " has now, without a moult, assumed a pink breast of
normal shade, and a dark eye, and appears to be a cock. Roseates
can alter their breast colour without a moult, but I don't think they
alter their eye colour and sex except when they want to play a bad
joke on their owner !
A normal pair of Roseates reared two good young and one rickety
one that had to be destroyed in their first nest and three in their
second, and the Gang-gangs reared two good young, both cocks.
I have had a couple of hen Little Bluebonnets for about three years.

One has had several illnesses, but it was her sister who went down
badly with coccidiosis this summer. I have never known a small
Parrakeet so very ill for so long. For several days we gave up all
hope of her recovery, but in the long run she did get well, not quickly
as most birds do once they begin to mend, but very slowly like a
human patient after a severe illness.
Coccidiosis, I find, is not very difficult to distinguish from enteritis
in the early stages. A bird with enteritis has the droppings much
changed in appearance but, in the early stages of coccidiosis they look
more normal though later they have a tendency to clog the vent, and
need removing. Coccidiosis is certainly the worst disease we have to
contend with at Woburn, attacking birds of all kinds, both wild and
domestic. One of our leading veterinary authorities takes a pessi-
mistic view of the ailment throughout the country, saying that during
the past quarter of a century it has become much more prevalent
among all classes of livestock, and that our knowledge of methods
of prevention and cure has not progressed to the degree necessary.
Among poultry breeders etc., there appear to be two schools of
thought. The older holds that if an infected bird recovers, it is there-
after a " carrier 55 and a menace to the health of young stock ; the
other, and newer, considers that birds which have recovered are, if
anything, more satisfactory afterwards in every way. On the whole
I am inclined to agree with the new view rather than with the
" carrier " view. From mid-July onwards the Budgerigars at liberty
provided me with an unwelcome amount of experience, although I
realize that I have still quite a lot to learn ! The incidence of the
disease was rather curious. Young birds are far more susceptible
than old ; cocks far more susceptible than hens ; birds with access
to the natural soil are more likely to get ill than those confined in
aviaries with tiled floors. With the exception of one young bird that
had strayed and been caught and returned in rather poor condition,
all the fatal cases--about six--were among young birds bought and
turned out in the liberty aviary or bred in a closed aviary at Woburn,
and later put into it. Of the young birds affected, only two were
saved, both after rather long and severe illnesses. In the case of two
young birds--brother and sister--the disease followed an unusual
course. The cock appeared to recover after a slight initial illness,
but a few days later, and before he was turned out, he had a relapse
and died. The hen also recovered after a slight illness, and again
flew at liberty for some weeks, when she developed a sudden and
severe attack, and died. Thus, although I believe an attack does
usually confer subsequent immunity, there seem to be exceptions.
In the hens' " resting " aviary, which has a tiled floor, three hens,
after breeding, developed mild bowel trouble which looked rather like
coccidiosis, and recovered without ever being seriously ill.

Three adult cocks fell ill in the liberty area and recovered. Two
were mild cases ; the third a severe one. Two fledged young belonging
to this latter bird died in the nest and clearly caught the infection
from him. The youngest nestling and the hen were not infected.
One of the mild cases, on recovery and return to the aviary, reared a
large brood, all of which remained healthy. No young birds got ill
in the closed tiled-floor aviary, but many of the same got ill or died,
some weeks after transfer to the liberty aviary, which also has a tiled
floor but, of course, access to the soil outside.
Next year I intend to experiment with birds moved from the closed
to the liberty aviary in the egg and very young nestling stage to see
if it makes any difference to their susceptibility to the disease when
they are older. If it does not it will indicate the presence of a
hereditary factor. It is rather difficult to say how far sulpha-
mezathine, seven drops in two ounces of water given for five day
periods--and lactose--one tablespoonful dissolved in a pint of
boiling water and cold water added to make one gallon--have been
useful for cure or prevention. They are not ioo per cent successful
but, on the other hand, without them losses might have been heavier
and recoveries fewer.

By R. Garner (Nottingham, England)
I have always had a great interest in the keeping and breeding of
foreign birds, and before the war, was successful in breeding Zebras,
Javas, Cuthroats, etc., in outside aviaries. In 1939 I had quite a few
foreigners, which all had to go, as I was called to the Forces at the
outbreak of hostilities.
All through the war I longed to start up with birds again, and as
soon as I was demobilized I put up my garden aviary, but owing to
the import licence restrictions no foreigners were available, so had to
stock it with a few Canaries. These did well, and the next year a few
foreigners came on the market at rather high prices, so I acquired
three pairs of the commoner species. One evening I noticed that the
Keston Bird Farm was advertising one cock Alario Finch, so I sent
for him, and in due course he arrived in good feather and in full
song, so he was placed with my other six foreigners in an indoor
aviary in my birdroom. About six weeks later the same firm advertised
one hen Alario, so of course I phoned right away for her, and she
duly arrived in good feather, but not much to look at, being something
like a small hen Redpoll.
She was also placed in the same aviary as the cock and the other

foreigners, as it was too late in the season to think of breeding. In
the spring the pair of Alarios was given an indoor aviary to them-
selves, and were duly supplied with nest boxes, but no attempt was
made at housekeeping either that year or the next.
This spring I placed the Alario pair in a small outdoor aviary, about
12 feet by 8 feet, with a small shelter portion, together with three pairs
of Canaries, and supplied several nest pans and small nest boxes made
of wood, about 8 inches by 4 inches, with a half open front. These
were placed both in the shelter portion and in the outside flight, and
a small quantity of hay was placed in each.
The Canaries commenced housekeeping, and shortly after I was
pleased to see that the Alarios were interested in one of the boxes in
the outside flight, and very soon a nice little nest was built of hay and
feathers in one corner of the box. The first egg was laid about a week
later, followed at daily intervals by three more. The eggs were of the
same size and very similar to those of the British Redpoll.
The hen sat very closely, and on about the tenth day I found one
egg on the aviary floor, which had either fallen or been thrown out
of the box. On examination this egg proved to be well advanced in
incubation, and contained a well-formed chick. About three days
later the first live chick appeared, followed by two more. Both parent
birds were very busy feeding the chicks (brown bread and milk,
Canary rearing food, soaked seed, and plenty of fresh lettuce leaves
being provided).
All chicks did well for four days, when one appeared to fail, and died.
The remaining two grew very quickly, and after eighteen days left the
nest, and were similar in colour to the hen. About four weeks later
one chick showed signs of the white patches and black head of the
cock bird, while the other remained in the hen-like attire. I imagine
I have a pair, although the believed cock has not yet assumed the
black head and dress of the adult cock, but shows even more distinct
signs of doing so, and the other still remains in the hen's attire.
The adult pair have had another attempt at housekeeping, and this
time laid three eggs in the same nest box as the previous family was
reared. Two chicks hatched, and one died after about a week, and
the other, which I think is another young cock, left the nest on 18th
August.
PS .--Since writing the above article I am able to confirm that the
first two chicks are definitely a pair, as the cock has assumed its full
male attire. The youngster from the second nest is also showing male
characteristics. All are doing well and are exceptionally strong.

By Charles Cordier (New York, U.S.A.)
In October, 1948, in the company of my wife, I set out for the
Belgian Congo to assemble a collection of live animals for the New
York Zoological Society. At the top of our list of specimens wanted
stood the Congo Peacock, several other winged rarities, and many
mammals.
From New York the Norwegian freighter which we boarded made
a beeline for the port of Dakar, French Senegal, and then proceeded
stopping here and there at ports of the Gold Coast. Twenty-five
uneventful days later we reached the mouth of the Congo River and
then raced upstream against the swiftly flowing muddy current to the
port of Matadi.
Contrary to our expectations, the Congo River in its lower reaches
bears no resemblance whatsoever to the majestic sea-like aspect of the
Amazon. The former runs very deep, compressed between high hilly
banks which, in their bareness, bring to mind a Chinese landscape.
There we set foot on Congo soil and kept an eye on the unloading
of our voluminous equipment, which included an 8 cu. ft. kerosene
refrigerator, which later proved absolutely indispensable. Two days
later we boarded a train which was to take us, surmounting an
altitudinal difference of perhaps 600 feet, over hilly and bare country,
to the modern capital city of Leopoldville. We were serene in our
knowledge the duffel was following right behind us and, subsequently,
realized we had been lucky. Unaccompanied baggage often languished
at Matadi harbour and elsewhere for half a year or so.
As our train wound its way upwards, stopping at neat stations
embellished with flower beds, nothing brought to mind the epic
struggle and tremendous cost in human lives and capital it took to
build these narrow-gauge steel ribbons linking the upper navigable
part of the Congo River with the sea.
At Leopoldville we groaned at having to dip deep into pockets to
pay customs duties assessed on everything we had with us, no matter
whether old or new. The competent Forestry Service issued a
collecting permit, at a substantial figure of so much per head to be
collected--and sent us forth with its blessings.
We now boarded with our duffel a cargo sternwheeler, somewhat
slower than a passenger boat, bound for Stanleyville. Our vessel,
flanked by two barges as big as herself, first ploughed through
Stanley Pool and then proceeded up one of the many Congo River
channels. It took twenty-one days to cover the next 1,000 sinuous
miles of the Upper Congo, island-dotted throughout its length. Every
evening the boat would tie up for the night at the river's bank to take
on firewood.

The waters of the river were at flood level; no sandbanks were
showing. The vegetation reached right to the water edge and,
consequently, during the whole three weeks we rarely saw anything
alive, except an occasional crocodile, which the ship's captain would
use for target practice with his army rifle, some Cattle Herons floating
seawards on clumps of vegetation, snowy white and black Angola or
" Palmnut " Vultures {Gypokier ax angolensis), slowly cruising overhead
while deciding whether to fish or get an easier meal of palm nuts.
Incredibly as it sounds, this bird is responsible for the spreading of
the Elais Palm over much of the forested part of the Congo. Another
large black and white bird, the Hornbill, with its conspicuous two-
storey beak, would cross the river high above in rapid flight.
Gone into limbo with the days when you could trade beads for
valuable souvenirs, or a native would do anything for an empty tin
can, is the high forest which used to cover the Congo rivers banks.
As on a highway, the sides are lined with fields, immense palm nut tree
plantations, villages, or just plain uninspiring second growth forest.
At Stanleyville, where a series of falls interrupts navigation, we
disembarked, glad to be done with major travelling, and were gratified
to find all our belongings on hand and intact. We managed to store
the nearly sixty cases temporarily and set out in our jeep truck, which
we had brought with us, with the intention of locating a likely ground
for Peacocks and a convenient site for a collecting camp.
As many of our readers will remember, this mysterious bird became
only known to science when Dr. James Chapin, of the Museum of
Natural History of New York, in 1936, while on a visit to the Congo
Museum, at Tervueren, in Belgium, spied, relegated on a cabinet in
a corridor, a pair of large mounted birds labelled Crested Peacock.
A barred broken feather protruded from one of the wings and, upon
closer examination, it proved identical to a puzzling feather which
Dr. Chapin took from the hat of a native in the Congo twenty-three
years earlier. When in 1937 Dr. Chapin returned to the Congo to
look for Afropavo , already skins collected by alerted friends awaited him.
To-day several dozen skins repose in three or four museums ;
I contributed some skeletons and brought back six males and one
female alive ; I also collected chicks, which up to then were unknown.
It has been established that its area of distribution covers an immense
part of the forested Congo territory and yet we know little about its
habits and much less about its nesting.
We headed in the general direction of Ikela, 180 miles south-west
of Stanleyville, as the crow flies, where, during the last war, a govern-
ment employee had kept two pairs and obtained from them a clutch
of two eggs. This gave rise to a short notice I remember having seen
in this very publication, erroneously reporting that the Peacock had
been bred in the Congo.

As, on a Sunday, our shiny, canary-coloured jeep bounced and
jolted along the dirt-highway, which we found to be bad, and worse
in most of the forested section of Stanleyville Province, we were
amazed at the reaction this sight provoked in the villages we traversed.
Shouts of amazement would be heard, women and children would
come streaming out of the shade of huts and the men would get off
their deck-chair-like seats or resting platforms in their palaver houses
open on all sides, tightly packed with humanity and, sheltering besides
the log drum. On reaching the end of a village, usually flanking the
highway for half a mile and more, we would drive through widely
gesticulating, shouting, and yelling crowds, and the combined noise
would be like the droning of a giant bee-hive. I have been told that
the same enthusiastic reception is still being given to the train that
has run bi-weekly from Stanleyville to Ponthierville for the last fifty
years.
After driving for several hours we had no trouble collecting a crowd
and unveiling to these primitives our paintings in almost natural size
of male and female Peacock. The first reaction was of consternation
and query ; then a brighter lad said " Itundu ", and they all took
it up. Our " wapi "--where--brought forth " Yaolonga " and
pointing up the road we were on. The map revealed such a village
name and, with the kind help from white employees of a rubber
plantation, we were soon installed in the government resthouse of
Yaolonga. We were now not quite half-way to Ikela and on the fringe
of the no-man's land found on the west bank of the Lualaba river.
We had never been able, up to then, to find out for sure whether
there really was a passable road to Ikela ; therefore, already tired,
we thought this might be as good a spot as any.
Next morning, at daybreak, I started out with two guides into the
forest. After a dog-trot of several hours, which the natives seemed to
keep up effortlessly, while I was sweat-soaked and somewhat winded,
a welcome stop ensued as our progress got barred by two almost
naked, spear-carrying hunters straining under heavy loads. An all-
pervading sweetish smell of decaying flesh, mingled with an acrid
smoky tang came from the charred lumps being carried, and I got
introduced to their brand of jerky " nyama ", a delicacy the average
native mostly dreams about. A watery, pinkish exudate had collected
from the stuff and was trickling down the porters' backs. Suddenly
I noticed a bunch of blue-edged wing feathers tucked under a vine
holding a load and . . . Congo Peacock feathers they were. My
halting inquiries brought forth the obvious explanation. The male
bird had stepped into the foot sling of an antelope trap. I could
hardly get over the fact that of the very first day of my assignment
I was that lucky. There seemed to be nothing to this collecting.
With renewed vigour I followed my fast progressing guides. There

was very little undergrowth barring our way and I complimented
myself on this feature. Later, however, attempts at penetrating the
Congo forest in other sections brought out conditions under foot that
were very bad. To get my breath back, once in a while, I would stop
and inquire u Itundu wapi 55 ---where ? They would stop, point to the
ground, and make a sweeping gesture. To gain more time I would
say " haico ''--there aren't any ; they would then affirmatively stamp
their feet and say " yes there are ", looking annoyed. Once, near a
little brook, they pointed to scratch marks made by an Itundu ;
a further moment's rest was later gained by examining a dropping
right in the trail, also coming from an Itundu, according to them.
Around noon we reached a typical hunting camp of the Bamboli
Negroes, consisting of a long string of thatched huts that were so low
they seemed play-houses for children. Outside fires were smoking
under stick platforms and one native was busy undoing leaf-covered
parcels of meat literally alive with maggots. He would scrape most
of those off with a knife and then place the pieces over the smoky fire.
Later, I have seen jerking of meat done in the camps of other tribes
but never again under such conditions. Wrinkling one's nose and
remonstrating will bring the rejoinder that the meat gets eaten, not
the smell. . . . Little by little several strapping fellows joined us each
carrying one or two medium-sized Gaboon Duikers, some fresh, others
smelly and fly-blown. I did then not yet realize that these genial
natives were daring non-conformists, envied by thousands of rubber
workers living on huge estates nearby.
After reconnoitring other sections of the same forest on successive
days, without finding any more traces of Itundus, we returned to
Stanleyville to begin an extensive search for a base camp. Our choice
fell on an empty government house, a huge, thatched, stick-and-mud
affair situated about 40 miles east of Stanleyville, on the road to
Bafwasende. The natives there assured me that the Peacock was to
be found in the surrounding forest. In the months to come their
assertions were never proved, however ; there was hardly any other
choice as housing was very scarce. I also knew that, further east,
near the Tschopo river, Peacocks had been found.
Mr. Bridges, the New York Zoological Society's Curator of Publica-
tions, soon joined us, flying in from New York, with the objective of
providing the members with a first-hand account of how collecting is
done.
About 40 miles east on the Bafwasende road, and 24 miles south of
it, used to be the mining camp of Ayena, where twelve years ago,
Dr. Chapin had personally collected Peacock skins. I decided on this
location for a trial. There was one serious drawback to it as the
mining camp had been abandoned with the road probably claimed
back by the bush. We lost no time to realize the scheme by rounding

up an interpreter and porters. The ensuing difficulties, confusion, and
late start between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., soon made it clear to me that
back home someone had failed to make contact with the Colonial
Administration at Brussels, which action alone brings out the big
Welcome Mat by the somewhat autocratic local administration.
Obviously, the functionnaires who have the hardest time to make the
natives understand that cash crops are good for them and tending
fields a virtue, not to be left to their wives altogether, look with
somewhat jaundiced eyes upon requests for activities disruptive of such
teachings. Their black charges ask for nothing better than to follow
a call into the woods with the prospective feasting on meat. As matters
stood throughout our stay, we rarely received all-out government help
and had mostly to rely on the appeal of greed upon the natives by
offering unheard of rewards for the animals wanted.
The road to Ayena was, indeed, impassable for vehicles, and all
eleven bridges had disappeared. A narrow trail often obstructed by
windfalls, but mostly by second growth, pulled down and trampled
by elephants, was all that was left of it. Towards evening we camped,
perhaps at the half-way mark, and the following day we reached the
natives' hunting camp, a crudely built roof of abandoned corrugated
iron sheets. How far we were then still from the former site of Ayena
was not clear, but the spot itself seemed a favourable location from
which the natives fan out to set their traps or to dig skilfully long
rows of oblong pits with smooth walls sloping slightly inwards, the
bottom studded with slender hardwood spikes of irregular lengths.
A marvel of murderous ingenuity goes into these constructions.
I set a number of natives to construct an extensive line of footslings.
They choose to work not far from camp and bunched together,
getting into each others' way. As the noise from our camp reached
the trap line this effort was entirely wasted. We had hardly settled
down when the people started to complain about the lack of food.
The village head did not or could not comply with instructions to
send porters with more food to us, and most of the men had to be
sent back for more provisions.
It became apparent that the real mining camp had been situated
much further in, and I persuaded one of the hunters to guide me in
a search for it and the Peacocks that was to last two days. We left
early and walked at a sharp pace until noon, past innumerable scratch
patches of the Crested Guinea-fowl. For a time we followed a smooth
elephant path. Often my guide would stop abruptly and then I would
notice a vine stretched taut across. These were triggers of suspended
poles high up in the foliage ready to crash on to unsuspecting
pachyderms. Towards early afternoon my native stopped often, and
I noticed our passing seven times the same stilt-rooted tree. Obviously
we were lost. ... We circled for hours, then gave up and decided to

build a temporary shelter. I helped in the gathering of roofing leaves,
stepped into a masked hole, heard a crack, and realized, before
falling to the ground, that the bones of the right leg above the ankle
had snapped.
I spent a night of agony on the ground, with the native squatting
and dozing near a fire in a little shelter he had built for himself at
a short distance. Toward one in the morning he drew my attention
to a call echoing through the perfect stillness : " ngowe, ngowe 55 it
sounded. Then it was followed by an answering call on a lower
pitch : " ngoa, ngoa." The sound was repeated from another
direction, and very faintly still from another. I had listened for the
first time to the nocturnal cry of five or six widely scattered Congo
Peacocks, and was to hear this performance repeated twice more
during this night of all nights. . . .
I had occasion to hear this raucous utterance again in other forest
sections but had never the pleasure of being accompanied by hunters
with enough guts to go out into the night to locate the roosting tree,
to surround it at daybreak with nets, the bird getting captured when
it comes down to the ground, late it seems, between 7 and 8 o'clock.
The habit of giving its position away at night is, perhaps, the reason,
according to Dr. Chapin, why the Peacock is not found in the Ituri
forest which begins about 100 miles north-east of where I was.
Pigmies dwell in it and it is entirely possible that these stalwart and
ferocious hunters have been able to exterminate it. The more so,
I agree, because our camp was on the north-eastern fringe of its
range. The species there is to be found only at widely scattered spots
and seems to have no push left to extend its range. Speaking of
pigmies and the birds' range, it comes to my mind that about a year
later, 500 to 600 miles south-west of Ayena, at the mission station of
Loto, Province of Costermansville, a forest pygmy brought me a not
quite adult, dying female Peacock which had fallen into a buffalo pit.
The next day my companion, accompanied by natives, came to my
rescue, summoned by my guide. I was tied to a pole, my nose one inch
from it, and thus carried, passing two more nights in the forest before
reaching the highway and later the hospital at Stanleyville.
This mishap put a serious cramp into my activities. At my
suggestion, Mr. Bridges took Afropavo collecting over and proceeded
to Mangandu, near Lubutu, about 225 miles south-south-east of
Stanleyville, where I had heard specimens were collected before.
Thanks to an energetic black government official, spurred by promises
of a substantial " matabishi " (reward), the inhabitants of a whole
village were dispatched to a forest only four or five miles from the
highway. There the bird seems not to have been driven back ten or
more miles from the road because it probably made a comeback in
a section hunted clean of other game previously. Perhaps, there, the

natives are being pushed to raise food for great numbers of men
working in the gold mines and have not enough time and energy
left for going after such scarce and unrewardingly small feathered
" meat
I reckon a good thousand traps were set out and, as a result, in the
course of three or four weeks, six or seven Afropavo females were
captured which were in various stages of disrepair. Some were dying,
others had broken legs which proved that the traps were put up too
far for supervision from camp and that these rather sullen and
backward Bakumu people did not care and used tension poles for the
traps which were too strong, better suited for holding small Antelopes.
When such is the case, birds are left dangling by a leg. Mr. Bridges
brought to our camp at Bongena, where I hobbled around after an
eleven days' stay at the hospital, once two and then one female
Peacock. To do so he made the hazardous drive at night. Of these
specimens, one died, unable to swallow the morsels of meat and
boiled eggs I forcibly pushed down her gullet. Of the other two,
hardly able to stand on their legs for a moment, one died days later
and the remaining bird rallied and started to feed on grubs, small
pieces of raw meat, boiled egg, and, finally, on an insectivorous
mixture suitable for Thrushes. This specimen remained exceedingly
nervous throughout the time we had her, was distraught by noises,
and generally behaved " headless " until its end, which came about
some eight months later. She probably never fed sufficiently, and in
the end the hookworms got the better of her. After Mr. Bridges had
given up his camp at Mangandu we were several weeks later electrified
by a telegram mentioning a captured " Itundu ". We practically
rocketed over the several hundred bumpy miles in the jeep and found
a male, perhaps a year old, dark blue underneath, back greenish-blue,
with the stiff white brush on its forehead, which in some males attains
about 3 inches, having started to " sprout ". The bird had been
kept on evil-smelling grubs in poor light but seemed all right. I had
no trouble inducing it to feed on an insectile mixture. It developed
into a fine, steady specimen thanks to a spacious compartment,
partially roofed over and planted, sealed against flight on the sides
with closely spaced poles and with strong fish netting above. Un-
fortunately, this bird came to an untimely sudden end eight months
later through poison administered by a native, I believe.
In April, 1948, Mr. Bridges returned to the United States. In June
we moved our main camp to a spot six miles south of Stanleyville to
lessen supply difficulties. By October only was I able to set out again
in the search for more Peacocks. With a newly-acquired 3 ton truck,
with an extra long body, I headed for the Adventist Mission, which
is situated about half-way between Kirundu and Lubutu, south-south-
west of Stanleyville. I stayed over a week with a dozen natives in the

forest at a spot vaunted for its Peacocks. A trap line half a mile in
length was set up which rewarded us with a single Crested Guinea-fowl,
useless to me on account of a broken leg. Peacocks were never even
heard ; instead, once deep in the night there was a general alarm
among the natives brought about by the distant hissing and growling
of Leopards having, possibly, an altercation about division of spoils.
After giving up this fruitless search I rolled on with the truck to
Lubutu, and from that post on northwards to the end of a short
mining road. At Lubutu the competent administration official
provided me with the one and only game warden, who in my mind's
eye still stands out on account of his jug-ears, the lobes of which had
huge circular holes, through which I found it fascinating to look at
the scenery beyond. The usually flat landscape hitherto encountered
changed into hilly, almost mountainous country, and it was thrilling
to realize that now Mountain Gorillas were around. At Mundo, the
road's end, the native administrator, on superior orders, provided the
necessary porters and I limped on, on a wide trail, still headed north.
My leg was then still giving me considerable trouble. On the third
day of March the Maiko river was reached and there I was told
there was no facility to cross it and to travel on the trail leading
through uninhabited forest to Angumu. According to information
obtained from Dr. Chapin, the Peacock is quite common on that trail,
but back at Lubutu, later, the government men said they simply did
not want me in that section for fear I would spy on their illegal hunting
camps.
However, Peacocks were supposed to be right across the river and,
with the aid of the game warden, I believed for a time, I had managed
to send a lot of scouting parties out to locate the birds, for us to follow
as soon as a favourable spot had been found. After a ten days' wait,
a triumphant party of two men brought in the carcass of a leopard
trapped in a noose. Voluble and energetic game warden notwith-
standing, I had to leave, and in spite of having announced our
return-safari well in advance, the village on that day was absolutely
deserted. Porters could only be rounded up in the early afternoon,
and they reached the next resthouse on the trail in the night. In due
course I was back at our base camp with a few Water-Chevrotains
and Gaboon Duikers ; of Itundus there was nothing. . . .
Next I turned my attention to the large forest reservation of
Yangambi, on the right bank of the Congo River some 60 miles west
of Stanleyville. At the Izangi government headquarters a sympathetic
administrator gave me a paper calling on the black government man
at Ueco to provide me with up to fifty men. I hurried to the place,
only to wait in impotent frustration for many days as this rather
turbulent tribe of Turumbu natives was in the throes of a serious
distubance brought about by the question of who was going to bury

the corpse of a woman whose husband had been slow in paying the
customary death-indemnity to the brother of the deceased. There was
plenty of leisure to find out that the Turumbus, fierce and repulsive
looking due to evenly spaced skin flaps produced by tattooing in a
straight line from the edge of the scalp on the forehead to the tip of
the nose, imitating the serrated centre ridge of a crocodile's back, call
the Peacock " Ngokola On this trip and later I was assisted by my
Arab, Mwarabu, whom I had promoted from carpenter to collector.
We finally did get fifty men ; instead of coming to us with nets and
food they appeared empty-handed in their Sunday best and had to
be sent back to bring the necessary implements. It would be too long
and tedious relating in detail what happened with this great force of
helpers, but two events stand out. One attempt to collect Peacocks
in the territory between the rarely used road running from Ueko or
Weko to Bengamisa and the Congo river brought two Water-
Chevrotains instead, and the natives who carried them out to the
road in proper cages, in spite of being cautioned, bolted with the load
and had great fun in being the first ones back. One of the animals
was dead as a consequence. . . .
The next attempt, north of the road mentioned previously, I can
still vividly remember. On the third stay after having established
camp and distributed strings for traps, I heard a tremendous com-
motion in the depths of the forest ; it swelled in volume and drew
nearer. I could make out one man carrying something in a bag and
over thirty wildly gesticulating and rhythmically chanting natives.
They drew to a halt like a well-drilled platoon with a tremendous
thumping of feet, and I was handed the bag, blood-stained, with
a flourish amidst sudden profound silence. I extricated from that bag
two Black Guinea-fowl, the bottom one practically dead. It died
later, and its fate would have been different if one bag for each bird
had been used, of which they had several provided by me. The
terrific racket had scared all game for miles, and I had to give up
the attempt, a little wiser, doubting that great numbers would
accomplish anything, especially when, on calling in the string handed
out for traps, I found half of it unused. As to their hunting prowess
with nets to provide them with the so highly valued meat, a little
figuring made it apparent that if the men are being paid at the more
than modest 11 to 12 American cents per day, a ten or twelve man
party with nets, which is about the largest number able to work
together, and at their best if from the same family and village, bring
in so little it is decidedly much less expensive buying meat in cans
coming all the way from the Argentine. . . .
Next, I turned my attention to the hunting camp of the former
village of Boma-Hay which used to be on the left bank of the Aruwimi
river below the government post of Banalia. A Mr. Coultas and a

companion, both Canadians, had collected there five or six Peacocks
years before. The village had been relocated much further up-river
on the opposite bank, but with the help of the old chief, Lupu, a
former guide of Stanley's, as well as white administration officials at
Banalia, I set out with a dozen men in dug-outs for the former hunting
camp of Boma-Hay, or so I thought. I even had among our party
the village chief of Boma-Hay, who described how the two Canadian
" Muzungus " received news about the outbreak of World War II on
their squeaking box precipitately abandoning everything such as tents
and so forth, implying he hoped I would do likewise.
The hunting camp we reached after floating with the current
for about five hours, entailing further a march of several hours
across swampy forest, practically on the heels of elephants, to judge
by the fresh signs, was the most picturesque ever seen by me. Many
tiny huts were balanced on 30 ft. long stilts in a tiny clearing. Into
these the men retired at night for safety, presumably, but I hate to
think what would have happened if an elephant had leaned against
the poles to scratch its hide. ... A smoking rack laden with charred
lumps of meat and day-old domestic chicken underfoot were proof it
was being used. Towards sundown several hunters started making
a rhythmic racket with little gourds and reeds resembling the squeaking
of supernatural-sized bullfrogs, and after hours of this the tempo
increased and the most stalwart of the hunters started to sway, teeter,
and stagger backwards. The direction in which the magic powers drew
him more often was the necessary indication which way next day's
hunt would go. After a few days' wait, during which I inspected
alone several of their widely scattered trap-lines to check the strength
of the tension-poles used in their traps, at considerable risk of getting
lost, many Black and Crested Guinea-fowl were brought to me, and this
was topped off by a headless female Peacock and a Genet caught in
adjoining traps. Then nothing more appeared, and one morning,
outside camp, at the usual hour of starting operations at about
8 o'clock, my village chief of Boma-Hay officiated in a long-drawn out
mystical ceremony in which two little smoky fires and a half gourd
with water were placed on the trail. He gestured mostly silently,
mumbled a short incantation, after which each participant had to
step over the fires. From then on plenty of Water-Chevrotains and
small Duikers, mostly dead, came into camp but, for me, nothing
more. I kept insisting they should move into the next ex-hunting camp
situated much further in as agreed upon at the start. However, the
men showed a strange reluctance to do so, and I gave orders to
return. In a village on the opposite bank of the Aruwimi river I had
to wait some days for travel arrangements to get back to Banalia.
In the meantime, many villagers got suddenly affluent by collecting
substantial rewards for Black Guinea-fowl which they netted for me.

Plenty of talking also made it startlingly clear that our Boma-Hay
village chief, who was on such good terms with the power controlling
the movements of game, had not taken me to the former camp of
Boma-Hay at all but much nearer instead. The men got duly punished
by their chief, Lupu, but by a strange quirk of native Congo justice,
the village chief mainly responsible, on account of being a blood
relation of Lupu's, was spared the punishment.
On reaching the new Boma-Hay, from which we had started out
originally, and where I had left my Arab collector, Mwarabu, I found
a dozen Black Guinea-fowl on hand as well as a " Bulikoko 55 or
Giant Plantain-eater. The first were doing fine, the same as my
Tufted Guinea-fowl, by being fed at the start on the white immature
flying termites coming out of the mushroom-shaped termite nests
abounding in the forest. Some really hardy woman also brought for
our Seses, or Black Guinea-fowl, as called locally, pails full of the big
termites constructing huge mounds often graced with spires. These
imposing structures are so hard that every strike on them with a
machete brings forth sparks. The numerous chambers contain
vegetable matter on which tiny round mushrooms are raised.
Disturbing their work is savagely punished by the square-headed
soldiers, and every nip inflicted by their formidable jaws draws blood.
On approaching a band of these termites foraging on the forest floor
the myriads suddenly start rapping rhythmically the dead leaves and
twigs, and the effect produced is startingly like the sudden drumming
of an oncoming tropical shower.
After being transferred to an aviary at our main camp, the Black
Guinea-fowl learned to feed on an insectivorous mixture but they
would always show the greatest enthusiasm on being given termites.
They would rush to the termite covered spot trying to cover with
their bodies as much ground as possible, shoving the companions
away pushing with their shoulders sideways. Most unusual and
un-Guinea-fowl-like. I suppose these rather small gallinaceous birds,
absolutely black, with bald scarlet heads parted in the middle by a
few black feathers, with a series of spurs on each foot, must have
originated in the forest, which would account for their being wholly
insectivorous, never touching grains while in captivity. The Tufted
Guinea-fowl, on the other hand, probably existed in the sayannas first
and then invaded the forest. In the forest no grains are found, of
course, only fruit and insects. On breaking them in, after starting
them on termites first, they would soon take to grains. The Congo
Peacocks, also inhabiting the deep forest exclusively, gave evidence at
first that they live mainly on insects by taking immediately to termites,
as well as grasshoppers ; they do, however, subsist also on many wild
fruits, because whenever I had occasion to inspect trap lines later set
up by natives they would be found in the vicinity of forest fruit trees

having fallen to the ground. Some of these were black, flat cherries,
others mango-like. In a compound in Coquilhatville Province I was
even shown a round fruit growing out of the bark of a seemingly
fast-growing tree of hand-ball size, covered with a rough skin, bringing
to mind the capping of bee combs, containing innumerable black flat
seeds each in an envelope of sticky white meat. At these one freshly-
captured Peacock once pecked but, on the whole, in the first misery
of their captivity, they would take to insects only. The spotty
distribution of these fruit trees accounts most likely for the equally
erratic occurrence of the Peacocks. This species, in due time, here at
the Bronx Park after two years of captivity, is showing a marked
liking for grains.
The barbarously gaudy-coloured Giant Plantain-eater, an enormous
fruit-eating Coucou, so to speak, on the bringing back of which we had
counted, proved to be our greatest disappointment. We were unable
to hold a single specimen. Their dissection showed them to have
a very short, almost straight gut. This would indicate they are
gluttonous and continuous feeders, showing a well-known preference
for the sweet fruit of the Parasol tree. It is possible that between
capture and our getting the specimens, to be promptly force-fed, too
much time elapsed, thereby irretrievably damaging their digestive
system. This species has been kept once at London's Regent Park and
Villers-Bretonneux, in 1916-17. As a curious fact I must mention
that they show a pronounced liking for freshwater algae which grow
profusely in unshaded ponds and swamps. The natives, in order to
get them, erect in the centre of such locations little gallow-like
structures. By perching on these the birds are snared by the legs.
The bird-collecting activities at Boma-Hay were extended to a
search for rare mammals, and suddenly I realized with considerable
misgivings that our departure was slated for a few months hence and
still we had no Peacocks, the specimens received at the beginning of
our stay having died. I remembered Ikela, the spot where the Peacock
had practically been raised. The road leading to it proved bad and
worse, but passable, and on entering Equator--or Coquilhatville
Province--the well-kept highways there were a welcome change.
With the exception of an obscure native government clerk, nobody
seemed to know of Mr. Herrling's former success with Afropavo there,
but driving slowly along the road to Lomela and spreading the word
for the reason of my coming, after staying for a few days near
Yolombo, a native appeared with a round reed-basket terminating in
a point fastened to a carrying pole. In that basket was a female
Peacock, and from under her peeked five newly-hatched chicks. A day
later the female died, in spite of feeding a little on termites provided.
I think insolation was the cause of the death of this " Lftono ", its
local name. The hunter had the sense of shading the basket with

leaves, but heaven knows how far he walked in the glaring sun of the
highway. Trying to elucidate how and where he had made his catch
proved impossible. The trade language, called Lingala, spoken there,
neither of us knew well enough, but the huge cash reward was enough
for him. The actual payment of such a sum was spread by throbbing
tom-toms, and I was soon the sad recipient of many " Litonos ", all
males from then on, with limbs whole but unable to come out of
a deadly weakness, force-feeding notwithstanding. Either the specimens
were carried too long in the blazing sun or left in the traps until
fatally exhausted. As all these trapping activities were undertaken at
the initiative of the natives without government supervision, such
results were logical. I must add that there I had the rare opportunity
of seeing a male Peacock in its natural habitat in flight. On examining
some trap lines, perhaps two miles off the highway, a commotion
ahead and a blue shape took to the air and a freshly-torn foot sling
held up by a crestfallen native boy was the reason I managed to
get so close. It was obvious that Afropavo in that region was more
numerous than anywhere else I had been up to then, and why the
captured ones never showed any broken limbs became clear when
looking at their most ingenious traps which are suspended slings fixed
at a height that obliges the bird to stoop a little when ducking under.
Getting its head and body through the noose, the feet upon advancing
pull it down and it closes slowly on one or two feet upon further
progress. I had never seen anything that simple and humane any-
where, doing away with tension poles and traps not functioning due
to rain. At this spot I also wanted to know where Afropavo nests.
I engaged two hunters who professed to know, and we searched
carefully hundreds of small windfalls, so fresh the crashed but dry
limbs had still every tiny twig on. In these the bird is supposed to nest,
as the crackling of the dry twigs would immediately signal a warning
to the sitting hen. Perhaps the natives were only pulling my leg,
because in the regions I knew to the north-east, such windfalls I had
never met with. Besides, the hunters there profess not to know at all.
However, an old chief in the Yangambi Forest Preserve emphatically
stated they nested high in the trees, which would mean in the manner
of a Curassow of the Americas. A Bamboli hunter at Opala, in the
presence of a government official, positively asserted they build their
nest some io feet off the ground on broken-off tree trunks. As to the
number of eggs, from three to six are probable.
Of the five downy Peacock chicks, I managed to keep three alive for
several weeks. Out of the skin of their dead mother and a corrugated
cardboard box, I made a shelter with a sloping cover and placed it
in their cage. They learned to take refuge and warmth there in no
time. However, two of them on the way back came to grief by getting
squeezed too hard under the lowest part due to the bouncing of the

truck. I could not properly drive the truck and look out for them at
the same time, and this came about because at Ikela, on crossing the
Chuapa River ferry outward bound, the crew thought it unnecessary
to lash the ferry to the river's bank. On getting on to the steep movable
ramp leading to it my heavy vehicle pushed the ferry off the bank
and the truck fell in, the front coming to rest on the river's bottom
while the rear was precariously balanced on the edge of the concrete
ramp. It stood practically on its nose. With the help of all the
Ikela jail inmates it got pulled out and received an emergency
clean out. Later the headlights conked out ; the motor, due to sand
having entered it, became an oil-eater. I had to nurse the vehicle
back to Stanleyville, driving all night with a pressure gasoline-lantern
attached to the front bumper serving as a headlight substitute.
Some Bamboli-tribe native, whom I had for a while as helper,
often extolled the merits of Elipa, some 60 miles south of Opala, on
the Lomami River watershed, as wonderful Itundu territory. Finally,
I had to get rid of the obsession by travelling to the place. All I got
for my trouble was a useless wait of over a week and the negative
result proved in keeping with the diminutive village huts with fences
in the front but nothing in the rear to keep out the goats, each man
also coming to the usual morning roll-call provided with a 3 in. high
piece of wood to squat on while the orders to collect Itundus were
being discussed and commented upon at length. In keeping with the
place were the anklets many women and some men were wearing.
These took the form of hammered copper balls the size of a child's
head, and even larger, considerably hampering the wearer's move-
ments, but considered very " chic ". Realizing these tribal characteris-
tics, I dropped the idea of going back to Yaolonga where I had met
with signs of Peacocks on our first try.
After having delivered the Peacock chick into the hands of my
wife, together with three adult males, I hurried back bound for
points beyond Ikela. This time, instead of being alone, I had with
me my collecting aide, Mwarabu, and an " interpreter " who had
helped feeding our stock at the base camp. Mwarabu was set up in
the vicinity of Bokungu, some 75 air-miles east of Ikela, with the
mission of getting more Peacocks, and the ex-government clerk-
interpreter, very efficient in the Lingala language, stationed near
Yolombo and provided with sufficient funds to pay for any Peacocks
that might turn up. Passing through Ikela I was astonished to hear
I had already set up a man with the very same instructions at
Yolombo. The official stationed there pointed out to me a smart-
looking man of the Cucu tribe whom I had given a lift on the truck
previously. He had, indeed, ordered the natives to bring him
antelopes and sundry " nyamas " on his own initiative. He lived
exceedingly well on the coveted meat but failed to pay, and his

providers got wise. There he was on the prisoner gang doing odd
jobs, but the official could not help pointing out with admiration how
fast and willingly he performed every task assigned, and concluded
with conviction that after serving his term he would not fail to snap
up this prize and keep him as his personal aide.
From Yolombo I walked some 14 miles to the Cucu village of
Yofofe and found there a native playing with an already weak downy
Peacock chick. It was too far gone to rear it, and after several days
of useless waiting I retraced my steps. I then motored along the
highway in the direction of Lomela, situated in Costermansville
Province, and to a mission at Loto, where a Pigmy, as previously
stated, brought me a dying immature Peacock female, called in the
Okela language Omono, whereas the male, curiously enough, goes by
the name of Lofokele. On the way down I tirelessly inquired about
the " Ditondo ", the name by which the bird was now generally well
known, but somehow I could persuade nobody to make efforts with
a view to capture any. However, I got the conviction it was much
more abundant there than in all the territory previously visited.
On my return to Yolombo I found several males in cages being
attended to in a fashion by the ex-government clerk, but the people
were in an uproar, clamouring to be paid. It seemed my representative
had started functioning by having his picture taken by an itinerant
pioneering black photographer and then had dazzled the local belles
with the wealth at his command. There wasn't a trace of it, and he
explained the loss with the most fantastic story of assault and robbery.
We practically turned him upside down and recuperated, salted away,
25 cents. . . .
On fetching Mwarabu at his collecting station near Bokungu, I was
agreeably surprised to find a female Peacock with one downy chick
on hand. He explained that he himself led a party of natives into
the distant forest and did come across a female with many, perhaps
five chicks, which scuttled into hiding while the mother flew into
a tree. He made a man climb the tree, whereat the female flew
down, started to run erratically, and hid, head first, under some tree
roots, where he threw a bag over her. He put the whole gang of
followers to search for the chicks but only a single one could be found.
On a previous search in the forest they also had come upon a single
female which took refuge in a tree, and got chased down the same
way, also taking refuge, head first, under some obstruction. The
pursuing native grabbed her rear end with both hands and practically
plucked her naked. She did not survive such rough treatment, neither
did the female with the chick stand the very rough trip back to our
base camp. We arrived no sooner there when a telegram reached us
that the government official at Yolombo had another female on hand.
I did an about turn and found the specimen in very good shape

indeed, thanks to precise instructions previously given. This female,
the only one of its sex, and six males finally reached the New York
Zoological Park, but upon her death proved to be old, with atrophied
ovary, presenting many male characteristics.
I will conclude by mentioning another slight disagreement that
exists between Dr. James Chapin and myself regarding a possible
breeding season proper to Afropavo. Dr. Chapin maintains that owing
to the uniformity of the climate throughout its range it breeds the
year round, whereas I am inclined to think the season for one particular
section lasts from the middle of January to the end of May, during
which period I collected chicks at localities in Equator-Province,
previously mentioned, not so very far apart when considering air-
distances. I will also give the opinion of a seemingly qualified native
interrogated at the Kirundu Adventist mission. According to him, the
breeding season starts when a large red hairless caterpillar makes its
appearance there in September to October. The male is supposed to
feed the female with these, thereby starting her on the way towards
maternity. These caterpillars are a very welcome food item for the
natives as well and, in the Equator-Province, a friendly government
official related to me that myriads of these caterpillars present the
most impressive spectacle when the voraciously feeding hordes high in
the trees suddenly rear up and vibrate the upper parts of their bodies
on being addressed by the natives in a highpitched thin whistling
sound.
Our collecting assignment came to an end when we boarded a
chartered plane at Stanleyville on 13th June, 1949, reaching New York
two days later without misshap.

By Edward Boosey (Keston, Kent, England).
In August we received at Keston a consignment of Australian
Finches, consisting of Sydney Waxbills, Zebra Finches, Painted
Finches, and Diamond Sparrows, and a single hybrid which is
obviously a Diamond Sparrow X Long-tailed Grassfinch cross.
In our last consignment of Australian birds there was a Zebra
Finch X Long-tailed Grassfinch and a Masked X Long-tailed Grass-
finch, but whereas both these are fairly common crosses, I have never
seen a Diamond Sparrow X Long-tailed Grassfinch hybrid before, so I
thought a description of the bird might be of interest.
As in a Diamond Sparrow, the head is grey, the back and wings a

mousey brown colour, and the tail black, but the latter is pointed
instead of square, and the rump, instead of being red is white mottled
with salmon-pink. The cheeks are white and the breast pale
pearly-grey, merging into white on the under tail-coverts. There
is a large black patch on the flanks mottled with very dark grey and
with a faint black and white striped effect at its outer edges. The bird
has the dark maroon-red beak of a Diamond Sparrow, and a rather
smaller edition of a Long-tailed Grassfinch's pear-shaped black bib
on its throat. Altogether it is rather a handsome hybrid--much more
so than the insignificant Zebra Finch X Long-tailed Grassfinch cross.
Incidentally, although (living so close to a jet fighter aerodrome as
we do) I have cursed the invention of aeroplanes often enough, I must
say air travel certainly has proved a boon and a blessing for the
importation of birds that have to come long distances. For example,
the Australian consignment just received was dispatched from South
Australia on the Monday, and reached us on the Saturday--just five
days compared with the long six-week journey by boat.
This swift modern transport is, of course, particularly valuable for
such bad travellers as Diamond Sparrows, which nearly always used
to arrive having plucked each other bare, whereas those we nowadays
get by air arrive in absolutely perfect feather.
Mortality, too, is reduced to a minimum, and in this last consign-
ment, which consisted of 130 birds, only one--a cock Painted Finch--
died on the journey.
It is interesting how comparatively common those once great
rarities, Painted Finches, have become since the war, and the above
consignment contained no less than twenty specimens, whereas before
the war we used to think ourselves lucky if a very occasional pair
arrived. They proved very little trouble to breed, so I suppose
someone has bestirred himself in Australia, and is breeding them in
really large quantities.
Ruficaudas, too, seem much commoner now than they used to be,
and nowadays we can get fifty or more at a time, instead of the
occasional half-dozen pairs or so which used to arrive before the war.

1778, has, like many other birds, been much confused or mistaken by
several of the older authors.
The first successful breeding in captivity of this species in the United
States, and possibly the world, was achieved this year in the Zoological
Gardens in San Diego, when a baby was hatched on 8th June, 1951.
The forehead, head, and sides of the neck are pure white, the front
crest feathers white, the next vermilion on the outer web, and white
at the point and inner web ; the rest have the outer web dark, and
the inner web light vermilion. All the upper and under parts of the
body are white, with a rosy shimmer and a yellowish tone over them
in the bright light ; the quills are light yellow on the reverse side, the
tail feathers on that side are orange-yellow ; the lower part of the
body is rose-coloured. The beak is black, the cere a dark bluish-grey ;
the eyes are black or dark-brown, the eye cere a bluish-white. The
feet are blackish-grey, with scales and claws black. The female is
not differentiated generally, and the sexes are very difficult to
determine. Their habitat is Ceram and Amboyna.
Comparable in size with the Great Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, the
Rose-crested appears larger than it really is because of the thick
plumage, which is often ruffled. (Length 15J inches to 17J inches ;
wings, 12 to 13^ inches ; tail, 6^ to 7 inches.) It has the peculiarity
of being able to ruffle not only the crest, but also the long chin feathers
when excited.
Very little has been written, even by the older authors, concerning
the wild life of this particular species. Dr. Russ says that these birds
were taken in numbers from the nest and hand raised. Most of the
birds of this species are already very tame when they come into the
market, being hand-raised by the natives. In the many years we have
exhibited this species of Cockatoo we have found them to be wonderful
show birds, clever, and readily taught to talk and whistle tunes with
a soft flute-like voice. In recent years the Rose-crested Cockatoo
has not been imported frequently into the United States.
Since the baby hatched this year represents fifteen years of con-
tinued effort to induce the species to breed, we consider it quite an

achievement. Two eggs were laid by the hen Cockatoo, but one
proved to be infertile. The incubation period was thirty days.
Of the many species of birds, especially of the psittacine family,
I consider the Rose-crested Cockatoo to be the most difficult baby
I have raised in the Zoological Gardens. This was due to its unusual
temperament and to its specialized diet requirements.
In captivity we have found the most suitable food for the Rose-
crested Cockatoo to consist of Indian corn (on the cob), sunflower
seed, oat groats, peanuts, pinon nuts, orange, bananas, lettuce, and
dried bread. Our pair of breeding Cockatoos are fed this diet
throughout the year, divided into two feedings each day. During the
breeding season only cuttlefish bone is added, to supply the calcium
needed in the producing of eggs.
Even with such a variety of foods we have found through past
experience that most Cockatoo parents feed their babies well for
about ten days and then suddenly stop feeding, and the babies either
die or develop a bad case of rickets. Hence we usually remove the
babies from the nest at nine to ten days of age and feed them by hand.
On 18th June we removed the baby from the parents' nest, and
found it to be in the need of food, as its crop was completely empty.
Ten days old at this time, the eyes were barely open. Food was
offered immediately, and a small amount was assimilated. A feeding
schedule at four-hour intervals was then followed. This schedule
was followed for eight weeks, when we discontinued the feeding at
night. When fifty-six days old this baby tasted his first piece of fruit,
a quarter of an orange. Banana, apple, pear, and orange were all
offered to him, which had earlier been rejected. When grated up
on the regular formula this was immediately regurgitated, and a
second feeding was necessary. As I have said before, because of this
species' nervous digestion, it is most difficult to raise. Closing a door,
opening a window, moving a chair, any unusual noise would cause
this Cockatoo to regurgitate his food at the most inopportune time.
To-day, at three months of age, this Cockatoo is still a baby, and
although able to eat by itself it is still being spoon fed three times each
day as a supplement to its regular diet of sunflower seed, orange,
banana, apple, bread and lettuce, and peanuts.
In hand feeding all members of the psittacine family we feed in
the following manner. We first bring the water or milk to the boiling
point, then add the following ingredients in the order named, stirring
gently all the while : half-cup of sperry wheat heart cereal, 5 drops
Oleum Percomorphum, 2 fresh egg yolks, 1 teaspoonful of ground
cuttlefish bone meal. This formula will cook in three minutes. Cool
until finger warm and feed to babies with a spoon.

By David M. West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
Of the seven Neophema or Grass Parrakeets of Australia, only four
species are now to be found in American aviaries. Of these four
only the Elegant can really be regarded as commonly available, and
the Bourke's, Scarlet-chested, and Turquoisine are all rare.
The Turquoisine is one of the most beautiful of the Neophemas--\0x25A0
and next to the Scarlet-chested one of my favourites. This species
is the rarest of the four mentioned species in America.
In the United States the first breeding was by F. H. Rudkin, senr.,
in 1933, when he reared four young. Others subsequently bred it--
including the late I. D. Putman. Unfortunately the Turquoisine is
more difficult to mate-up than any other of the Neophemas we have
kept--so that when we finally secured a pair of Turquoisines in 1947
there were considerably less than a dozen specimens left in the United
States.
Before recording my breeding notes on this species, a short descrip-
tion may be of value to the many who have not seen a living example.
In size they resemble a Bourke's, but differ vastly in their colouring.
The back of the male bird is a very lovely green ; the face and cheeks
turquoise ; the wings turquoise blue with a red patch on the wings ;
the tail is green with each feather tipped with yellow, and the yellow
increasing in extent towards the outermost feathers on each side, which
is almost entirely yellow ; and the breast and under parts a very rich
yellow-orange. The female is rather similar in colouring to the male,
save she is much paler, lacking the red wing patches and the bright
blue face and the brilliant yellow-orange breast. I might add here
that while all the standard works show the female as not having red
shoulder patches, almost all of our females have a small but definite
red patch. However, it is smaller than the male's red patch but no
less bright.
When we finally obtained a pair of these birds in late 1947 naturally
we were very anxious to breed them. The pair was placed in an
aviary twelve feet long and three feet wide and six feet tall, and this
aviary was portable and was moved about on the lawns as weather
indicated. In the warm summer months the aviary was under a
sycamore tree, thus giving partial and filtered sun, and in the winter
the cage was placed so that it received full sun. The greatest
advantage of this aviary was that it gave the birds a large supply of
the fresh grass they so greatly enjoyed. In the warm weather their
delight was to run about on the lawn in their aviary following a
sprinkling of the lawn. Incidentally, they are great bathers--and

rarely do they miss having a dip when the lawn sprinklers are on near
their aviary.
Although in the wild state only one clutch of young are generally
reared in captivity they are invariably double-brooded, and a third
nest is not uncommon.
In March of 1948 a nest box was given to them. In size it was
like those commonly used for Lovebirds (. Agapornis ), and was filled
nearly to the entrance hole with coarse sawdust or more accurately
wood shavings. It was amusing to see their excitement at this box,
for when they saw it coming the male began to call and fly wildly
about, spreading his tail while in flight, and thus showing the very
lovely yellow webbing on the tail. After the box was hung (under the
shelter) the male would fly to it and very cautiously look it over--while
the hen sat with rapt attention near by. She would occasionally
hover about it, but a good twenty minutes passed before she finally
flew on to the nest.
The following days their interest grew and the male assiduously
fed his hen--and she spent hours inside the box throwing out the
superfluous wood shavings. Eventually they were seen to mate, and
then she began to lay her clutch. This time the clutch was four
eggs, and she began incubation with the third egg. All during the
eighteen-day incubation period the male sat several hours daily at
the entrance hole, and would frequently call to the hen. On several
occasions he would spend a large part of the day in the box with the
hen. The hen left the nest twice daily--once in the morning and again
in the evening. She generally left the nest at the call of the male,
who would fly up to the hole and call to her. She would remain away
from the nest only a few minutes each time, just long enough to eat,
drink, and fly about the cage a few times. Here it was interesting to
note that her first activity was invariably to drink, after which she
would eat and then fly for a few minutes.
The evening of the eighteenth day was a happy birthday for the
Turks and also their owners. Now half the struggle was over, if only
all would continue well. Both parents fed the young, the male feeding
the hen and also the young. When the young were about four days
old the male began to feed them directly, and sometimes he would
feed them while the hen was out eating.
Their diet remained the same all during this period. They received
a seed mixture of one part yellow millet, one part oat groats, one part
sunflower, and two parts canary seed. To this was added one-quarter
orange and one-quarter apple daily, and also wheat bread in the
morning and again in the evening. They had a constant supply of
greens, since their cage was on the lawn, but added to this was chick-
weed and the berries of ripe (red) Pyracanthas (Fire Thorns), a
member of the Cotoneaster family.

After the fourteenth day the female no longer remained in the nest
overnight. By the twenty-first day the young were being fed at the
entrance hole, sticking their heads out and calling to the parents to
be fed. They are quite noisy while being fed, and make sufficient
noise that one might hear them at a distance of 60-75 ^ eet away.
Finally, on the twenty-ninth, two young were found out and sitting
quietly on a perch in the sun. Even at this very early date the sexes
were clearly visible, the young male having a red shoulder patch and
being brighter than his sister. On the thirtieth two more left the nest,
and again these two were a pair and the sexes clearly visible. Although
we had never looked into the nest, we felt there were no more young
in the box, due to the lack of parental interest in the box on the
following days. This supposition was proven to be correct, for we
later cleaned out the nest box, and this hen had successfully hatched
and reared the four eggs she. had laid.
The parents continued feeding all the young for about ten days
after leaving the box. Shortly thereafter the male began to attack
the two young males, and they were removed to another aviary.
The male continued to feed the two females (who were then on seed),
and the female got busy with the second nest.
After the hen had been sitting for about ten days, the two female
young were caught and placed in the same cage along with their
brothers and some young Bourke's. Here it is of importance to note
that even though we entered the aviary and caught up the two
youngsters, the noise and confusion did not bother the nesting female
enough to cause her to leave the nest box, or even come to the entrance
hole.
This second nest was a close repetition of their earlier success ; pro-
ducing three youngsters comprising a cock and two hens. Again the
sex of the young was discernible the day they left the nest box. These
youngsters left the nest on the 30th and 31st day.
Amazingly enough the hen returned to the nest for a third try, but
this was not successful. Four young were hatched and reared for
twenty-three days, but the hen deserted them at this time, and they
all died. Contributing causes to this action were the heat of the
summer weather and the hen being in a moult. This moult was
begun shortly after the inception of the third nest. The four young
were two cocks and two hens, the male's red wing patch just beginning
to be visible at this time (twenty-three days).
Subsequent experience with this species has turned up some
additional information on their handling. For one thing, Turquoisines
are very aggressive birds, and we have found them a little difficult to
mate up for this reason. They are more fussy about a suitable mate
than any other Neophema we have had experience with. Further,
individual pairs differ tremendously in behaviour; while our old pair

never once fought, we have young pairs that do battle at the slightest
provocation. They are not mean with other birds, but they would be
quite impossible to keep on a colony breeding plan.
Each year following 1948 we have raised a few youngsters of this
species. However our progress has been rather slow, for we have not
allowed any young birds to nest until they are two years old. Even
so we now have four breeding pairs and several extra males. In
addition to this, three young breeding pairs have been sold to another
fancier here in California.
This current year of 1951 has been a very poor breeding year with
every local aviculturist singing the blues. We had great hopes for
rearing a number of young Turks from our four breeding pairs, but. . .
By late March each pair has four fertile eggs, so our hopes were really
high. But for some strange reason not one of the sixteen fertile eggs
hatched ! Why ? Later on they all went back to nest, and their luck
was better, so that at this writing (June) I can report nests of young
with two and three, and another nest of fertile eggs presently being
incubated. The remaining pair had a second clutch of clear eggs
following their earlier and fertile clutch. No thirds are encouraged,
since the warm weather will soon be upon us, and many of the birds
will begin their moult very soon.
We have found Turquoisines very tame, and they do not object to
your checking their nests while the female is off. We usually check
the nests twice, once after about fourteen days of incubation (we throw
out any clear eggs at this time), and again after the young are about
a week old. By knowing the number of young we can give extra food
accordingly. Average clutch seems to be four, though we have had one
nest of just two eggs and one youngster hatching.
I think that with care American aviculturists can again breed
enough of these beautiful birds, so that you will see them in many
collections instead of a few. This year there are a total of seven pairs
in California that should reproduce--and there are a few unmated
specimens about, so things are looking up for the future of the
Turquoisine. In 1950 I secured new blood with a female Turquoisine
from another breeder, so this will give me new stock. This year this
particular bird is the mother of two youngsters due to fly in a few
days. With average luck the next year should see quite an increase
in the local population of this species--so it is rather nice to end this
article on a note of hope rather than on one of dejection.
Correction -- The title of the plate facing page 225 should read " Turquoisine
Grass Parrakeet ".

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984348813953488" page_id="56288351"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
Having on various occasions enjoyed watching the matchless speed
and grace of Rock Peplar and Barraband's Parrakeets at liberty, I have
often wanted to see the third member of the sub-genus--the Princess
of Wales' Parrakeet--under similar conditions. Happening to have
a young cock and not too well bred for stock purposes, I decided
recently to take the risk and put him in an aviary containing four
young Rock Peplars just trained as day-liberty birds, and an old cock
Rock Peplar trained last year. The young Princess of Wales' father
I put in an adjoining aviary as a call bird. The young bird found
his way out fairly quickly, and behaved as a Rock Peplar or Barraband
ought to behave if all goes well on the day of its release ; that is to
say, he flew backwards and forwards high in the air, and circled
round and round, but never went more than a quarter of a mile
away in any direction. Like other young Polyteline Parrakeets on
their first day out, his powerful wings were inclined to take charge of
him, and he experienced some difficulty in stopping, and especially
in flying down . As a result of this difficulty one rarely gets a Rock
Peplar or Barraband back into the aviary until the day after its
release, and experiences some anxiety lest it should be taken by an
Owl when roosting out. Fortunately these pests are not quite so
keen on killing big birds in late summer as they are later in the year.
The flight of the Princess of Wales proved swift and graceful, but
had not quite the dash of that of his larger relatives. He was, how-
ever, more amenable, and I got him down on to the aviary roof and
safely back through the funnel that prevents day-liberty birds from
emerging after their last feed before nightfall.
Since then he has proved a very docile and stay-at-home bird,
spending much time sitting on his parents' aviary, and never going
any distance away. He is, indeed, inclined to be unenterprising almost
to the point of being dull, but it may be that his race, by reason of
its quiet and friendly disposition and fondness of its dinner, is the
safest of the Polyteline Parrakeets to fly at liberty. Rock Peplars and
Barrabands, alas, are not very dependable. Adult cocks whose mates
are confined will not, once trained, desert them, but there usually
comes a day when trained young birds do not return for their evening
meal. With luck, however, they may come back the following day
or the day after. You have, however, had your warning. If you
continue to let them out they will go completely wild, and never
return. Consequently you must either catch them up and dispose
of them, or mate the cocks and not release them again until they are
really attached to their hens, which must be kept in aviaries adjoining
the liberty one.

By David M. West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
Although the breeding season under consideration is not yet over,
and there may still be a few surprises, this year has been a very poor
one to date. The 1951 season was our poorest in several years, and
bad luck was our companion almost all the way. Other fanciers
in the Los Angeles area report the same thing--but aviculture is one
instance where misery does not love company.
The two saddest events were the loss of four young Pileated
Parrakeets--deserted by their parents--and the Manycolors which
kept our hopes up by looking in their nest boxes but proceeding no
farther with the task of rearing a family.
Other bad luck (before passing on to happier events) included
Barnards and Stanleys which did not even lay this year, and Adelaide
Rosellas which laid seven eggs but did not sit and at the time we had
nothing to put the eggs under for foster parents. The Blue Rosellas
hatched young--but they were deserted--a strange event, for we have
raised from sixteen to eighteen young from our two pairs every year
for a good many years. Red Rosellas, Elegants, and most of the
Bourkes all had clear eggs--though the pairs have all raised on previous
occasions.
Better news department includes three young Princess Alexandras
plus another nest of five fertile eggs still being incubated at this writing.
There are now three young Blue Rosellas, two young Bourkes, sixteen
young Scarlet-chested, and five young Turquoisines.
All in all, results were extremely disappointing. Again this year,
even though I was away and in the Service, all the birds received (in
addition to their staple diet of grains) J orange and J apple daily,
plus greens every day. All the nest boxes were removed in the fall
and cleaned and scrubbed in January, and filled with new nesting
material. Considering the better results, both in varieties and numbers,
of other years, this year can easily be said to be our worst since 1943.
No particular clue as to just what went wrong can be discerned.
Rainfall again was much below normal this year in our area, and I
feel (as many others do) that the lack of rain has been at least a
contributing cause. At any rate, again I find myself saying (as I have
every year since my first pair of Pigeons), " Next year ..."

Frank Grant then spoke on Waterfowl in Captivity. He pointed out
the many charms and pleasures to be derived from keeping waterfowl
and appealed to aviculturists to give more attention to this form
of aviculture. His talk was a happy blend of rules and precepts,
personal experiences, and anecdotes.
Some of the slides of birds in the speaker's extensive collection were
apparently not suitable for the projector, and lost considerably thereby,
but a series loaned by the Chairman were of his usual high standard.
The Chairman, thanking Frank Grant for his very interesting
lecture, said no aviculturist, whatever his interests, could have failed
to benefit by at least some of the observations.
The volume of applause indicated that this was most certainly the
case.
The next meeting of the Club is on 9th January, 1952.

years and long service on Council and as a Vice-President ". Now he
has received the Society's highest honour, the Gold Medal. The
importance of the award may be gauged by the fact that this is only
the fifth medal bestowed since the foundation of the Society in 1826.
The present award is in recognition of Mr. Ezra's thirty-six years'
service on the Council, most of that time as a Vice-President, and for
his outstanding donations. The latter include six elephants, four
tigers, and the two Kodiak bears at Whipsnade.
All members of the Avicultural Society will wish to join in hearty
congratulations to Mr. Ezra on this almost unique distinction.

The thanks of the Society are due to the Directors of the Dudley
Zoological Society, Ltd., to the General Manager, D. H. S. Risdon,
to Head Keeper H. L. Hatch, and to the many others who contributed
to making our Society's visit on 8th September a success.
Some thirty members and guests were welcomed by Director
F. G. Cozens and D. H. S. Risdon, and after a very excellent lunch
were conducted round the Zoo. As many of the visitors had come
considerable distances their time was necessarily limited but all,
especially those making their first visit, were very impressed by all
they saw.

The prospect of establishing the Masked Lovebird, blue variety, has
slightly improved. This year three young ones have been bred at the
London Zoo, and A. D. Gampey has bred two blues from a pair of
blue-bred. In addition, Campey has recently imported two pairs of
blues. We may thus confidently expect an increase next year.

The best game birds breeding results in the United States during
1951 have been obtained by Mr. R. H. Gibson, St. Helena, California.
During the past season he has reared 2 Malay Argus, 2 White Eared-
Pheasants, 4 Imperial Pheasants, and 30 Sonnerat's Junglefowl, as
well as a number of less rare birds. Excellent results have also been
obtained by Mr. J. W. Steinbeck, at Concord, California (12
Temminck's Tragopans, 7 Satyr Tragopans (from birds lent by
Mr. Gibson), 13 Monals, 10 Germain's Peacock-Pheasants, etc.),
by Mr. Lehmann, Myerstown, Pa. (4 Monals, 4 three-quarter White X
Blue Eared-Pheasants, etc.), and by Mr. W. J. Mackensen, Yardley,
Pennsylvania (12 Imperials, etc.). Also 12 Occelated Turkeys have
been reared at San Diego Zoo, and a few Java and Sonneret's Jungle-
fowl by Messrs. Parsonson and Rich in the Los Angeles district. Two
Satyr Tragopans and a number of Pheasants have also been bred at
the Philadelphia Zoo. Several pairs of Scintillating Copper Pheasants
have arrived from Japan and come into the possession of Messrs.
Mabey, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Gibson.

a hybrid between a Red-eared Bulbul male and a Black-crested
Yellow female (Pycnonotus jocosus X P. dispar flaviventris). These birds
had been nesting for several years, but so far no young had been reared.
The hybrid is brown with a greenish wash on the tail and wings ; the
head, crest, and neck are black.

Dr. E. Beraut writes from Rio de Janeiro : " On my return from
Europe in August the weather was not good and I could only make a
few trips in search of new Humming Birds. Following Professor
J. Berlioz's directions, I went to the plateau of Minas Geraes to look
for Augastes superbus , but I did not find it, although it was the exact
time when he had seen it there. But on the mountains I found by luck
large numbers of Stephanoxis delalandei on the eucalyptus trees in bloom ;
I have now five in my aviary, it is a beautiful species. I also caught
some Phaestornis pretrei and Glaucis tomineo (hirsuta). I now possess
twenty-three species in perfect health. I have kept several over a year
and some, such as Violet-ears ( Colibri ) and Heliothrix , more than six
months. I have forty in a space 10 X 7 feet. It is an extraordinary
thing that although they fly after one another at terrific speed they do
not fight viciously, probably because they are so numerous. Of the
Brazilian species, the Coquette ( Lophornis magnificus ) is still lacking ;
I have not yet been able to locate it. I plan to go soon to the hinterland
of Matto Grosso and to procure there some interesting specimens.

In December, on Monsieur Cordier's advice, I plan to visit northern
Brazil, when I should find Topaza pella and Heliactin cornutus. In this
way I hope to add to my collection and to keep it up by means of
periodical trips. I have a few true pairs, but they have not yet made
any attempt to nest. I believe the perfect condition of my Humming
Birds is due to three main reasons ; complete suppression of Mellin's
food ; daily addition of vitamins A, B, C, D ; daily supply of a large
number of fruit flies which are indispensable to certain species, in
particular Heliothrix , and in a still higher degree to all those which
wag their tails-- Rhamphodon , Phaetornis , Pygmornis, and Glaucis ."

THE PHEASANTS OF THE WORLD. By Jean Delagour.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984828" page_id="56288358"  page_num="236" year="" vol="">
Country Life. London, 1951. Price #7 ys.
The appearance of this most excellent monograph on the pheasants
of the world will be universally welcome. William Beebe's monu-
mental Monograph of the Pheasants appeared from 1918 to 1922 in four
quarto volumes, but unfortunately for some years it has been out of
print and practically unobtainable. In his foreword to Jean Delacour's
book William Beebe writes : " After more than three decades there is
abundant need for bringing pheasant lore up to date, and for publishing
all recently acquired information concerning this group of splendid
birds. No one is better fitted for this new undertaking than my very
good friend Jean Delacour, and I am delighted that he has chosen to
put into print this knowledge gained by himself and other
ornithologists. The dominant feature in my earlier work was the
direct observation of wild birds in their natural haunts, and it is this
part of the monograph which possesses the greatest permanent value,
unchanged by time. Fortunately this can now be ably supplemented by
Jean Delacour's incomparable experience in breeding the rarer species
in captivity and thus adding immeasurably to our knowledge of the life
histories of these pheasants."
During the last twenty-five years new discoveries have been made,

fresh information gathered, and deeper knowledge gained ; relation-
ships between species particularly are better understood. The present
volume, as Jean Delacour states in his introduction, completes and
brings up to date Beebe's monograph. It has a twofold purpose, to
offer a summary of modern knowledge of systematics, life habits, and
geographical distribution of the birds, and to supply the ever-growing
numbers of pheasant lovers with necessary data concerning the birds
in confinement, Jean Delacour 5 s experience in keeping and breeding
pheasants in captivity is, indeed, as Mr. Beebe, says, incomparable,
and his collection of these birds at Cleres, before the second world war,
attained a level never surpassed. Mr. Delacour's many expeditions to
Indo-China to collect and study pheasants in the wild made it possible
for him to acquire a knowledge of these birds second to none, and on
his very first trip he discovered a startling new species, the Imperial
Pheasant.
The book opens with a most informative and detailed general
account of pheasants and includes sections on history ; systematics ;
life habits ; acclimatization ; housing ; feeding ; rearing ; procuring,
transporting, and establishing pheasants ; and diseases. This general
account is of the greatest value to aviculturists, and there is a wealth of
information put at their disposal, including such details as the best
methods of dealing with cock pheasants intent on murdering their
wives, early ailments of chicks, construction of aviaries, and the
different treatment required by different species.
This is followed by sixteen chapters on the sixteen natural genera
into which the pheasants are divided, consisting of Blood Pheasants ;

is given of each genus and a map showing distribution is included.
This is followed by a detailed and clear description of each species.
Whenever a species has been kept in captivity a full account of general
habits and captivity is added. The volume is profusely illustrated with
thirty-two most excellent plates by J. G. Harrison, sixteen in colour
and sixteen in black and white.
In his introduction Jean Delacour points out that the future of
pheasants in the wild is very problematic owing to the ever-easier
penetration and the threatened destruction of their natural habitats,
the perfecting of weapons, and the changes in the food habits of native
populations. He believes that within the next fifty years a large number
of species will undoubtedly become extinct if appropriate measures are
not immediately taken to save them, and points out that at present
the difficulties in enforcing regulations in Asia are very great. He
concludes : " Fortunately nearly all pheasants can be kept and reared

in captivity, and many may be established in coverts as game birds.
It is the duty of both private individuals and public institutions to
organize their propagation more carefully and to do their utmost to
preserve these remarkable birds for the joy, welfare, and interest of
future generations."
These words should be taken to heart by every serious aviculturist,
and all those who have the possibility of maintaining these beautiful
birds should do their utmost to assist. The Pheasant Registry, organized
by the Avicultural Society to facilitate the formation of pairs by the
exchange and loan of birds, has done much to this end, and it is hoped
that its usefulness will continue and increase.
In these hard times seven guineas is a great deal of money, and
many readers of the Avicultural Magazine will be wondering
whether they can afford to buy this magnificent book, but if they are
really keen on keeping these popular and beautiful birds the question
really resolves itself into whether they can afford not to buy the book.

WILD WINGS. By Frank Stuart. Fanfare Press, Ltd., London,
W.C. 2. Price 14s.
In the publisher's preface we are told that although this story
(of a year in the life of a Pintail) is not a textbook on Ducks, " the
information is there." They naively add that ". . . sometimes the
information is startling ..." It is indeed ! The reviewer was more
than startled to learn that young Pintails gape for food like young
Passerines, and that both parents bring food to them. That both
duck and drake collect " softest mosses " from a distance to build their
nest. That young ducklings are taught (with the aid of corporal
punishment for the recalcitrant or slow-witted) to crouch motionless
when their mother gives the alarm. That a day's walking overland
suffices to cure a thoroughly " oiled " bird, and that Pintails protect
themselves from a fox (who might otherwise swim underwater after
them) by clustering beneath the perch of a Snowy Owl.
That these and many other equally fantastic statements are inter-
mixed with (misinterpreted) accounts of actual behaviour patterns
and a moving if rather ornate style of writing will, one fears, render
them the more capable of misleading the general public.
The author acknowledges his indebtedness to officers and members of
the B.O.U., the B.T.O., the Edward Grey Institute, the International
Wildfowl Research Institute, and other organisations. One wonders
if they will feel a reciprocal indebtedness for being thus connected
with this book !

UNUSUAL OCCURRENCES AMONG THE BREEDING BIRDS AT
DUDLEY ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987579436363636" page_id="56288361"  page_num="239" year="" vol="">
Two rather unusual occurrences among the breeding birds this year at Dudley
Zoo may be worth recording.
The first is the instance of a cock Cockatiel whose mate died three days after the
young hatched. Alone and unaided, the cock has successfully reared four beautiful
young ones. I have often heard of hens bereft of their husbands carrying on and
rearing their brood, and cocks doing the same thing under similar circumstances,
provided the young are well grown and feathered sufficiently not to require brooding
at night, but in view of the fact that a cock Cockatiel normally only broods during
the day, I think his effort in doing the whole job almost from the time the young
hatched, is a particularly noble one.
The other instance is a typical example of how the most unlikely looking birds
often make the best parents.
We have here a very nice hen Golden Mantled Rosella, and in the absence of
nothing better this spring, she was given a particularly undersized, moth-eaten
looking husband in the shape of an ordinary cock Red Rosella. This bird also plucks
himself badly, so I was afraid that even if young were produced, they would almost
certainly be plucked in the nest. In this I was wrong, as they have produced three
of the finest young Rosellas it has been my luck to see.
Incidentally, these being Zoo-bred birds, and reared to the accompaniment of the
screams of children, and the constant banging on the wire-netting of their aviary
from the public in general, left the nest and behaved without any of the usual panic
of young Parrakeets just fledging. Moreover, it is quite a joy to be able to stand in
front of their aviary and watch the parents feeding their young, completely indifferent
to one's presence--a thing I have seldom had the opportunity of doing in the past,
without hiding behind bushes, peering through a knot-hole in the wood of an aviary,
or through field glasses at about 100 yards range !
I am also trying this year the experiment of establishing some Golden Pheasants
loose about the Zoo grounds, by rearing the chicks in my garden under bantams, and
allowing them complete freedom, except for the clipping of one wing. This does
not prevent them jumping up into the trees to roost at night, but so far, to date
(mid-September), they all turn up at meal times on the lawn when I rattle the
food tin.
Dudley Zoo, Worcs. D. H. S. Risdon.
A SUGGESTION
Most aquarists are now using a species of nematode worm which belongs to the
order Enchytraa ), a small white worm about one inch long and of the thickness of a piece
of thread. Unlike mealworms, their propagation is extremely rapid, a few dozen of
them soon forming colonies of many thousands.
The breeding is extremely simple, a shallow box is filled with crumbly soil, or
better still peat, the little worms are added together with a few tablespoonfuls of
oatmeal or even breadcrumbs, and the whole is kept damp and shaded. Frost would
probably kill the whole colony, but excessive heat is not appreciated, a temperature
of 55 0 to 65* being about the ideal. Food must be added every few days as it quickly
disappears with growth of the worms.
I have two such boxes in one of my greenhouses and I have frequently noticed that
one very tame Robin was always hopping around one or other of these boxes. Finally
I gave him a good helping of peat and worms and within a matter of seconds every
worm had been picked out and swallowed. It then struck me that here we had a live
food which was much more wholesome than the leathery mealworm and which might
be ideal for the more delicate softbills such as some of the Robins, Niltavas, and even
possibly Sunbirds.
I am sending a small quantity of these white worms to our President and also to
Mr. Dulanty, and perhaps one or other of these will kindly report on his experiences.
White worms can be purchased at any of the many shops which deal in tropical fish.
