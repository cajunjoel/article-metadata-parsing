COUNCIL&amp;apos;S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1921
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986947555555555" page_id="9396785"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The year which ends with this number has been one of the most
difficult of the so-called &amp;apos; : peace &amp;quot; years ; but the Society has come
through the ordeal, and rather than look back at the trials of the past
we should look forward to the future with confidence and hope, seeing
the signs that are visibly pointing to a real revival of aviculture. Several
large consignments of birds have come into this country in the course
of the year, and the importation of foreign species is the most important
factor in the support of the Society, for without birds to keep aviculture
alive we can neither get contributions to our Magazine nor hope to
secure new members. The difficulties of the present time have caused
many aviculturists to give up their hobby and resign their membership,
and unless these resignations can be made good, it will be impossible
to enlarge the Magazine so long as the cost of production remains as
high as it is at present. It is to be hoped, therefore, that members will
do their best to induce their friends to join the Society and will send
the Editors accounts of the doings of their birds, so as to help to get
back to the davs of a Magazine of thirty-two pages and a coloured plate.
Signed for the Council,

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly
independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young and
be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal is
under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the breeder. An
evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only disqualify the breeder
from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance, but will seriously prejudice
any other claims he or she may subsequently advance for the breeding of the same
or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2# inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words &amp;quot; The Avicultural Society -- founded 1894 &amp;quot;. On the reverse is the following

DIET FOR REARING YOUNG BIRDS
By Maurice Amsler, M.B., F.Z.S.

<bodyText confidence="0.9947845" page_id="9396750"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
I see from notes by Mr. Seth-Sniith in the November issue of the
Journal that 1920 has been a very poor breeding season. Although my
fellow-members have my sympathy, I must admit that the statement
brought me some measure of comfort and consolation.
The past season has been the worst in my experience since I first
took up foreign birds. A few Diamond Doves and four Swainson&amp;apos;s
Lorikeets are all I can boast of after months of care and attention.
Orange-headed Ground Thrushes looked promising ; the male gave all
his titbits to the female even after the moult was completed in October,
but beyond the carrying of a few straws there was no attempt at
reproduction.
My present pair are both young and vigorous birds, and my failure
is all the more disappointing as in previous years I have seldom failed
to get at least two nests of young.
It may not be out of place here to advise those who may be
keeping these (or allied) species to separate the male from the female
when all breeding is over. My experience with more than one pair is
that the male is more attentive during the breeding season, but that
jitter the moult he chases the hen about, prevents her feeding, and by
generally bullying her either causes her death or finally kills her, unless
separated in time. When springtime comes round the hen will turn
the tables on the cock if he is introduced to her too early.

As 1 proposed saying something about the feeding of birds in this
article, I may perhaps mention that these Thrushes and also the
American Robin (Turdus migratorius) do not require a large quantity
of mealworms in rearing young. Two or three dozen should be given daily
for the firsl three days, after which the quantity may be gradually
reduced, their place being taken by small earthworms. The latter
are best supplied in a large shallow box containing plenty of damp moss.
The worms live indefinitely , and the parenl birds have a continuous
food supply. Gentles 1 nave already mentioned and advocated in the
.Magazine. 1 bave used millions in my time with no untoward result,
bu1 they musl be properly scoured, preferably in meal or flour, until
they have losl their central black line. Cockroaches or blackbeetles are,
1 know, said to &amp;quot; scour &amp;quot; the young birds. My experience is that the
only use the smaller insects, and the results have always satisfied
me. Lastly there is raw meat ; my last brood of Orange-headed Ground
Thrushes, reared in 191 1. weir fed very largely on it. and left the nest
very tit and strong and were fully reared. ! think a good deal depends
on its preparation. My method wa j to pass the meat through a mincer,
together with stale bread ; the mixture is then quite crumbly, and does
nol \0x25A0 m to lisgusl the birds like a La of pure meat. The parent
birds in question had been in my possession for some three years, and
it is possible that their long captivity had caused them to forget the
aversion, which we all know, to feeding with anything but live food.
The above points may appear a trifle laboured, but mealworms arc
at the presenl costing Is. per ounce. Given liberally a pair of feeding
Thrushes could dispose of an ounce daily, and a good deal more when the
youngsters were balf-grown. I tremble to think what my bill would
bave been at t be presenl price when 1 had young of Occipital Blue Pies
and Yucatan Jays ! The price of &amp;quot; soft food&amp;quot; at 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. a
pound also &amp;quot;gives us to think&amp;quot;. 1 bave completely given up buying the
made-up article, and find that biscuit-meal (preferably grocer&amp;apos;s biscuits)
mixed with a small quantity of minced cooked meat suits the larger
insectivorous birds perfectly well. To this may be added twice weekly
as a treat some well-crushed hard-boiled eggs. \\\ addition to this all
my birds get a daily ration of the Lorikeets&amp;apos; food mentioned below,
and I think it is to this that their fitness is partly due.

I mentioned earlier that the Swainson&amp;apos;s Lorikeets had reared four
young in 1920. Two eggs since, laid in August, were clear ; but there
are two more in the nest-box due to hatch in a day or two. So I may
yet beat my own record and rear six in the year. This would make a
total of sixteen young in three years -- a pretty good record, seeing that
the clutch is never more than two in number. For this I take no credit.
I merely happen to have bought a breeding pair, not an invariable
occurrence with this genus. When these Lorikeets first arrived I was
told to feed them on a mixture containing Mellin&amp;apos;s food, condensed
milk, honey, and crumbled biscuit or sponge-cake made up with boiling
water ; some of the ingredients were not very easy to obtain during the
War, and all were expensive in the long run. However, I continued
their use until the birds had reared their first chick. This bird grew
very slowly, although the above food was supplemented with cane-
sugar, which Mr. E. J. Brooke told me was very important ; he left the
nest at the age of twenty iveeks, and was of about the same size as other
young birds I have since reared, which left the nest at five weeks.
I could not help thinking that in the case of these birds (I am not
referring to Sun-birds, Sugar-birds, and such like delicate fry) there was
something lacking in the condensed milk which handicapped the growth
of the young. Whether I was right or wrong, I decided at the time to
try a simpler food. I had noticed that the old birds were fond of sweet
rice pudding, but as this takes hours to make properly I tried ground
rice boiled for a few minutes with fresh cow&amp;apos;s milk and sweetened with
honey-sugar. This has been my staple food ever since, some two and a
half years, and the birds get scarcely anything else, very occasionally
a little fruit or perhaps a little custard. But they do not care much
for these &amp;quot; treats &amp;quot;.
We have heard and read a good deal about &amp;quot; Vitamines &amp;quot; of late,
and I am wondering whether the usual mixture given to Sun-birds,
etc., may not be lacking in some such substance. It is known that the
lack of a Yitamine affects young and growing animals and birds much
more than it does adults, and the use of fresh cow&amp;apos;s milk might make all
the difference in the rearing of some rarity, such as a Sun-bird or
Fruitsucker.

large)}&amp;apos; with insects, but in the case of the Gold-fronted Fruitsucker,
which T nearly bred on three different occasions, the old birds used
both the condensed milk mixture and also pure honey, in addition to
insects, in feeding the young, which never lived beyond twelve days.
Perhaps my ground rice and milk might have brought me success.
AM the above is, of course, merely theory, but in the feeding of all
except the hardiest birds we must remember that the diet is largely
artificial, and when failure occurs we must hear in mind what are called
for want of deeper knowledge &amp;quot; accessory food bodies &amp;quot;. An intensely
interesting article appeared in L&amp;apos;Oiseau some months ago. The writer
dealt in a very convincing manner with the lack of Vitamines as the
cause of death in many of the more delicate African Finches. Perhaps
Ah-. Delacour would allow a verbatim translation of the article for the
Avicultural Magazine. To refer again to the ground rice mixture, it is
this which I mentioned earlier in these notes as being used to supple-
ment the insectivorous birds&amp;apos; food. All the birds gel a. small quantity
daily. Amongsl those which I know eat freely of it. I may mention
ills, King Parrakeets, Jays, Thrushes, Tits, Whydahs, and even,
mally, t he I &amp;gt;iamond Doves.
1 am sure the birds thrive on it, it is a welcome change for them, and
as it contains milk il may be taken as a sorl of substitute for insect food;
this in the case of the smaller Waxbills, who seldom eai mealworms,
is an important point during the winter mouths when gnats, "reen-fly,
and such like small fry do not exist.
Having opened the subject of food and diet, might I ask other
members for their views thereon. A number of useful and interesting
facts on feeding might be brought to light I y a series of articles on this

By E. Maud Rnobel
The question of sexing birds whose plumage is the same in both
cock and hen has often been discussed, and various theories put
forward for distinguishing them. It is said that a practised eye can
easily tell the sexes when a pair of birds are together, and the methods

hitherto employed are by carefully noting any differences that may
occur. Even then it is very difficult if you have an old hen and a
young cock, say, for example, of a Blue-fronted Amazon, and one can
never be quite sure. May I venture to put forward another suggestion
for determining the sexes ? In doing so I should like it to be borne in
mind that I am speaking of parrots only, for it is solely in this family
of birds that my experience lies. This is by carefully feeling the bird
in the neighbourhood of the pelvis. In the cock bird you will find the
pelvic bones taper down to a point and lie so close together that they
are practically to aching, whereas in a hen bird the pelvic bones are
wide enough apart to allow an egg to pass through.
In my Alexandrine Parrot, which I know is a cock bird by the
black and rose collar, the pelvic bones lie close together, and I find the
same in my small Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, which has black eyes, and
whose general demeanour pronounces him a cock bird. Out of the eight
Blue-fronted and two Yellow-fronted Amazons I have kept I believe
only two were male birds, and I am inclined to think that the majority
of birds that come over to this country are females. Mr. C. P. Arthur,
in his account of Grey Parrots in his book Parrots for Pleasure mil
Profit, says much the same thing, i.e. that he has not found a single
male among the many he has dissected.
Last year I had a charming Yellow-fronted Amazon (Judy), which
I subsequently determined to be a hen. I must say the first time I saw
her in a shop I was not greatly taken with her, but the next day I
visited her again, when she promptly stepped off her perch on to my
hand. I at once bought her and carried her home. The very first
morning I let her out she flew across the room on to my shoulder,
and never have I had a bird which formed so great an attachment as
she did. She was really never happy unless she was on me, and she was
the most gentle and playful little creature I have ever had. Yet she
was undoubtedly a hen, and this entirely does away with the theory
that male birds like women and females men. In her case, from outw r ard
examination, the pelvic bones were quite an inch apart, and dissection
after death, which came all too soon, proved her unquestionably to be
a hen. I missed her so much and was so unhappy at her loss that two
days after i replaced her-- if one can say such a thing, for one never

replaces, really -- with a baby Blue-fronted Amazon, a funny little thing
with no wing or tail feathers, in fact very few feathers at all, but mostly
down. In this bird the pelvic bones lie close together, touching
each other, and I have no hesitation in pronouncing him a cock. I
tamed him in two days, that is to say, lie would come on my hand,
lie on his back on my lap, and let me kiss and stroke him, but he will
nevei adore me in the way Judy did. and has a very independent
, but he has moulted into a handsome bird and promises to be
an excellent talker and whistler.
My little Seneg ho in poinl of size and colouring is quite
as beautiful as the one so many of us know and admire in the Parrot-
house at the Zoo, with the exception that in mine the head is a trifle
smaller, has the pelvic bones about fin. apart, and I feel quite sure
in my own mind that she is a hen. In the very few dead specimens that
I have been able to examine I have not, found that the pelvic bones of
either sex look very different, and 1 am inclined to think that what
one Eeels in a live cock bird is not so much bone matter as cartilage or
gristly matter, extending on beyond the pelvic bones down to a fine
point, and which in a dead bird gets quickly shrivelled up so that one
cannot find it.
There may nol be much in tins theory, but certain it is that in some
birds the bones are wide apart, in others close together, and one
lly asks oneself if this does not denote sex. Why, then, should it
be? Perhaps some other members who have had more experience and
opportunity of studying these things will be able to help in determining
this question.

One of the prettiest features of our country rectory is its beautiful

of Rooks that inhabits it. We have more than fifty nests, and the
birds are an unfailing source of interest.

described as robbing each other&amp;apos;s nests of sticks is, in fact, a splendid
system of fagging ? It is, at any rate, noteworthy in our case that
it is always the &amp;quot; road &amp;quot; birds that commandeer the &amp;quot; house &amp;quot; birds&amp;apos;
sticks. The cocks seem to take it as a matter of course, but sometimes
the little ladies resist the demand on their youthful spouses. The heads
of the clan seem to control the number of nests that are built, and it is
not an uncommon sight to see them pull nests to pieces and drive birds
away. The sentries are well posted, but never disturb the birds for
any of our household passing up and down the avenue at night, but if
a stranger comes the conversation is very general, and not always polite.
We know immediately the whortleberries are in on the hills by the
droppings under the trees. Last year in the autumn the great
parliament was held in a big field alongside their houses. Two or three
thousand birds came, arriving about ten o&amp;apos;clock in the morning and
settling in long lines across the field. From time to time companies
rose out of the line, circled in the air, and alighted in another line,
for all the world like going to attend another committee. On one
occasion a great sorrow befel us. Two crows came and settled among the
rooks, and although sitting, the whole colonyrose into the air one Sunday
afternoon, divided into three bodies, and deserted the nests. One section
went off to the Mendip Hills, and we were able to observe the interesting
fact that they built in separate isolated trees, covering a fairly large
area, and not congregating together as usual, and began again to lay,
and brought up their young families. So much for the wisdom of the
agricultural committee of a county council who suggested beating
drums, lighting fires, collecting noisy boys to drive sitting birds off
their nests, and so put down the pest ! They may be wise, but they have
not &amp;quot; cornered &amp;quot; Rookie yet !
But now I must come to the great day. On the 1st of May, 1912,
I was going up the avenue when I heard a most fearful cawing, and on
the ground there were two tiny fledglings, perfectly bare except for
their wing-quills. One was injured and died, the other, the screecher,
I took up in my hands and brought into the house. The next day I
went to Ireland, and when I came back after a month Rookie had taken
over the rectory, which she has ruled ever since. My housekeeper,
Miss Latcham, was the foster-mother, and the bird always goes to her

with her ailments now, and she also much prefers to be put to bed by
her nannie.
She is absolutely free of the house, never has her wing cut, and asks
for all she wants, and we can always tell whether it is her bath, food,
bed, or change of air that she requires.
She has a far more acute sense of hearing than we have, and can
detect the noise of an aeroplane or motor-car many seconds before
we do. She is, moreover, always certain of the direction from which it
is coming, whereas we are often confused She is very accurate in
distinguishing sound, and always knows whether I ring the bell for
daily service or my colleague. If he rings she takes no further notice ;
if I do she lights on the window and waits anxiously for me to come down
the garden.
When we were billeting troops during the War, she took great delight
in the horses and men, and much appreciated the officers of the Royal
Welsh Fusiliers because of their fleches, which her keen eye had detected
before they entered the bouse, and which she had a continuous desire
to remove all the time they were with us.
She builds her nesl every year in the workroom. Her first was
constructed entirely of what could be goi in the house. She started
with twigs out of the housemaid&amp;apos;s box, then impounded four work-
scissors, my 2 ft. rule, three silver teaspoons, the receipt file, reels
of cotton and silk, two tape measures, a strap, string, and tape.
All these were wonderfully worked in, the interlacing being most clever
and laborious. Having satisfied herself with the outside, she proceeded
to line the nest, the first precious prize being a new chamois leather ;
this was followed by three cleaning-cloths, a pair of stockings, pieces
of linen, flannel, silk, a newspaper torn to shreds and taken piece by
piece. Bright colour was a great attraction, and always preferred to
white or brown goods. Each year since then we have put a box with
sticks and remnants in the room for her. She has always liked me to
help, and this year she was more than ever exacting, her scheme being
that I should bring the material and she build the nest, which she put
together in a very cosy corner of the wardrobe. I am expected to feed
her when she is nesting.
Her memory is most remarkable. The Rev, E, F, Turner left

Blagdon in 1914 and came back in 1919 for the first time after being
demobilized. I was sitting with the bird when she suddenly began to
fly about madly, and we heard a footstep outside. She could not have
seen him, but remembered his step, and there was no rest till she was
allowed to welcome her old friend and show him he was not forgotten.
In the old days it was great fun to see the little rook and the tall big
man walking demurely up the avenue together.
She shows great accuracy in measurements. At one time she was
very fond of taking pins out of the packet, would hold as many as
fifteen in her beak, and then plant them in twos and threes under
different objects. If we moved them or changed them when she was
out of the room she never failed to detect there were three where she
had put two, or to note any other alteration that had been made, and
was never satisfied till she had replaced them all in their original
positions.
I feel I must tell one story against myself. I was doing some
sermon work one morning, and had put down a note on a small scrap
of paper, when suddenly &amp;quot; Jinnie &amp;quot; went off with it. When I went
for her she calmly swallowed it. In righteous indignation I caught her
and smacked her on the claws with a pencil. She then skipped on to
the inkstand and, to my horror, proceeded to drink ink in a most
suicidal manner. When she had swallowed as much as she could hold
I found that death was not her object, but vengeance, for she spat
the whole of it over my face and collar ! It took my wife some time
to recover from the effect of uncontrollable fits of laughter at my
appearance.
She has established an ascendancy over our kitchen cat, and it was
great fun the other day to see poor pussy a prisoner under the copper
and Rookie, like a sentry, marching up and down in front keeping her
in, at the end of her beat always going about facing her charge in
correct style
She appreciates getting a letter through the post. She cleverly
opens the envelope with her beak, draws out the enclosure and stands
on it, and soon Lets everyone know that that piece of paper is her own
especial possession, and must not be touched. As with the letter just
described, so is her dealing with a bit of dough or a piece of bacon-

rind thrown down to her. She waits for the cook, after placing her
pastry in the oven or her bacon in the frying-pan, to present her with
scraps for similar treatment. Her imitation of two cats fighting is
so realistic that the girls have rushed into the kitchen thinking a strange
cat had caught her, only to find her on the gas-bracket giving a musical
sketch.
If you go out without saying anything she flies madly about the
room. If you say to her, &amp;quot; Coming back soon,&amp;quot; she quite understands
and remains peaceful and satisfied.
She is very fond of putting things in the tuck of my trousers. One
day in church 1 heard faintly the sound of a silver bell during service,
and it turned out to be a thimble her ladyship had stolen and put in
her usual store-cupboard, which had shaken out on to the marble floor
of the chancel. We hardly ever lose anything by her thefts, as all she
steals she endows me with.
One of her greatest friends is Mr. Gilbert Day, our plumber. He
always ignores her sex and calls her &amp;quot; Jack &amp;quot;. There is a wonderful
freemasonry between them. He gives her most fascinating things out
of his bag, but if he happens to want the particular thing he simply
says &amp;quot;&amp;quot; Conie on, Jack&amp;quot;, and the bird comes straight up, gives over
what she has got^ and receives a substitute from him. The way she
pokes her beak into all his work and down the pipes is a perfect lesson
to a clerk of the works. One word as to her digestion. She has survived
two tabloids of pyrogallic acid and half a dozen Beecham&amp;apos;s pills ! But
a saccharine tabloid does not appeal to her at all.
No words can describe the bird&amp;apos;s devoted affection. If I am out for
a few minutes, there is a joyous welcome back; if I return after a few
weeks&amp;apos; absence, such a greeting ! So much to tell me ! She knows the
true meaning of love, for it is always &amp;quot; giving &amp;quot; with her, not &amp;quot; getting &amp;quot;.
She brings her first bit of food for me to share, and is only too delighted
if I ransack her little treasury, which no one else may even look at.
She is happy for hours on my shoulder, greets me the first thing in the
morning, is so disappointed if I cannot give her an hour before the rest
are up, and has a last word for me before I go to bed ; and I can close
this letter as I did a letter to the Spectator three years ago : &amp;quot; As I
write she is on my wrist, talking to me all the time.&amp;quot;

MY PATAGONIAN PARROTS
By W. Shoee-Baily
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998313" page_id="9396760"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
One day last autumn T was wandering through one of the large
Wes1 End bird stores, when my attention was called to a cage full of
Parrots. On asking the attendant what they were called he said
Patagonian Conures, and that they had only lately been landed, together
with some Blue-crowned Conures. Amongst the five birds in the cage
were two birds considerably larger than the others and of a lighter
colour. It is true that one of these birds had very few feathers on it at
all, and the other was in bad condition, but in view of their possible
rarity I decided to take the lot. On getting them home and examining
the two large ones carefully, I made them out to be C. bryoni, although
they differed in one or two important points from the description of
this bird, especially in the absence of the white band across the chest,
as described in both Seth-Smith&amp;apos;s and Butler&amp;apos;s books. The smaller
birds were also without this white band, although in all other respects
they answered to the description given in the books. The question is.
does this white band exist in either species ? It is not shown in
the capital drawing in Mr. Seth-Smith&amp;apos;s book, nor can I see any
trace of it in the print in Dr. Butler&amp;apos;s work. I wrote to the
Magazine on this subject a short time since, and it was suggested
by both Lord Tavistock and Mr. Seth-Smith that the larger
birds were hybrids. At that time I could think of no possible
cross except between &amp;quot;(&amp;apos;. pataganus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot; C. hosmorrhous &amp;quot; , but
the difficulty in my. mind was the large size of my Parrots.
Dr. Graham Etenshaw thought that the size of my birds did not affect
the question, mentioning the fact that the hybrid is often larger than
either of its parents ; but my experience with hybrids in birds does not
bear this out, as although 1 have bred many hybrids I have never had
oneyel thai was larger bhan the bigger of its parents. I have now come
to the conclusion that i he smaller birds are pure &amp;quot;C. palagonus&amp;quot;, and the
vo the offspring of a cross between the LittleMacaw, &amp;quot;Arasevt ra,&amp;quot;
and the Blue-crowned Conure, &amp;quot;C.hcemorrhous.&amp;quot; Their description is
as follows: genera] body colour above and below. Light grass green ;
primaries, bluish-green; a small patch on wing butts, and a garte]

scarlet ; under side of tail-feathers, red ; a narrowband across forehead,
dark chestnut brown ; front of head, light brown ; upper mandible,
white, with tip black ; lower mandible, black ; patch of bare skin
around the eye white ; size about equal to the Alexandrine Parrakeel .
It will be noticed that the forehead, wing-butts, and tail correspond
very closely in colour with the same parts in &amp;quot;A. severa &amp;quot;, and the rest of
the body with that of &amp;quot;C. hoemorrhous &amp;quot;. I have always considered this
latter bird to be closely allied to the smaller Macaws, especially in regard
to the size of its bill. This bill, by the way, is a most formidable weapon.
The bird uses it very effectively on the woodwork of the aviary, and if
you have occasion to handle it, very stout gloves are advisable. In my
hybrids the bill is still larger, and they easily bite through the wire
netting of their aviary. One Sunday morning early this month I was
aroused early in the morning by the screams of Parrots outside my
bedroom window, and on looking out I was in time to see a little flight
of five just disappearing over the tops of some high elm-trees. One of
the hybrid Macaws had eaten a large hole through the roof of the aviary
and let its companions out. For three or four days they remained
together, visiting all the neighbouring villages, and subsisting,
apparently upon leaves and bark, for as far as 1 know they were never
.seen upon the mound. They looked very pretty soaring 40 or 50
yards in the air, and their loud calls could be heard half a mile away.
&amp;quot;Keminds one of India,&amp;quot;] heard one comrade say to another as the birds
flew over their heads, and it is really a pity that it is not safe to leave
this kind of bird at liberty, as even if one could train them to come back
regularly to food, they would, as things are now, sooner or later fall
victims to the man with the gun. Of my birds, the wire-cutter found
its way back after five days&amp;apos; liberty, two others were captured in
neighbouring villages, and two are still missing. These birds are quite
hardy, and I was surprised that they made no attempt to breed. In
their own country they nest in holes in cliffs and river-banks, so I had
some nest-boxes sunk into a bank in their aviary, but they made no
use of them ; possibly they may have been interfered with when on the
ground by my Mantchurian Pheasants, or they may not be true pairs.
Another Patagonian Parrot, or, at any rate, an Argentine one, is the
Maximilian Parrot. &amp;quot;Pioims maximiliani,&amp;quot; Of these rare birds I have

Parrot, but are hardly as large. Their general body colour is green ;
primaries of wings edged with black ; outer webs of tail-feathers bright
blue ; under tail coverts, scarlet ; head, brown ; cheeks, brown,
each feather edged with brown, giving it a pretty scaly appearance ;
bill, yellow ; bare skin around eye, white. They are rather quiet and
apathetic in their demeanour, but this may be due to their rather
rough condition. If they improve I shall try and breed from them
next season.

The author of this book is a very keen observer, and has made most
careful and minute studies of the habits of the creatures around him
during a residence in the Himalayan Valley of Hazara, between the
years 1915 and 1916. The accounts he gives of the. life-history of the
various species of ants, spiders, butterflies, and such-like creatures are
fascinating, but all point to the following of a blind propelling instinct
with complete lack of reasoning power. The author describes the
method employed by the Harvester Ants in collecting their winter
store of grain ; how the carnivorous species, Phidole indica, on finding
its prey, hurries back to the nest to communicate the intelligence to
the army of workers and soldiers waiting for such a call ; how the
geometrical spider constructs its wonderful snare with mathematical
precision. These and other small creatures have the secrets of their
lives divulged in this fascinating volume, which, however, is not entirely
confined to these small fry. The author has a chapter of observations
on mammals, in which he deals with the leopard, Himalayan monkey,
and flying squirrel, and another on birds, in which his remarks and
deductions on soaring flight, migration, nesting instinct, and so forth
are particularly interesting and instructive. There is not much
aviculture in this volume, but as the majority of aviculturists are
naturalists first, it will appeal to many readers of this journal.

Sirs, -- With reference to your footnote on my letter in the December
Magazine with regard to my Chestnut- winged Amydrus, may I point
out that in Gould&amp;apos;s Birds of Asia, vol. v, there is a coloured plate of
A. t fist rami exactly resembling my pair of Amydrus from Africa. I
cannot find Hagiopsar tristrami in Gould&amp;apos;s works. He names it Amydrus
tristrami, with no synonym, and wrote : &amp;quot; There cannot be the slightest
doubt as to Amydrus Irish-ami being a good species. It is nearly allied
to A.fulvipennis of South and South- Western Africa. The size of both
species is the same.&amp;quot;
That my birds may be A. morio I do not dispute, but judging by
Gould&amp;apos;s plate they appear as identical with A. tristrami.
These birds seem to be hardy, for although only lately imported
they arc t briving in an outdoor aviary, and even moulted in November,
Hubert D. Astley.

{Amydrus), calling it Hagiopsar, of which genus it is the only repre-
sentative. -- Eds.]

MY LONG-TAILED ROLLER

<bodyText confidence="0.981876904761905" page_id="9396764"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
If I was asked which I prefer of the birds I actually possess, I think
the reply would be : &amp;quot; My Long-tailed Roller,&amp;quot; although there are some
good birds in my cages, such as Cuban Trogon, King Bird of Paradise.
Giant, Hoary, and Black-collared Barbets, Cossyphas, several species
of Sun-birds, Black-backed Tanager (Calliste melanonota), etc., and
nearly all of them are very tame and amusing. The only bird which
might almost surpass the Roller is a charming purple-capped Lory,
whose affection for my attendant and myself is really wonderful, and
makes one think of a pet dog.
But the Roller possesses altogether the four most important qualities
for a bird in captivity : beautiful plumage, tameness, sensibility, and
rarity. Rollers are amongst the most difficult birds to keep in good
condition. At liberty they feed mostly on the wing, and they need
much exercise to keep in good health. As they fear the cold and can
only be kept in summer in an outdoor aviary, it is rather difficult to
give them enough room to fly about and a good temperature all the
year round, unless the bird is so tame that it can be handled at any
time, and this is the case with mine.
Another thing is that it is often difficult to accustom Rollers to
captivity ; Major Millet-Horsin, Medical Officer to the French Colonial
Army, who has spent years in studying and catching birds in Africa,

and is a great authority on the fauna of that part of the world, told me
that it was only last year, after about twelve years&amp;apos; trial, that he
succeeded in keeping a Koller in captivity, in the native country of the
bird!
When I obtained my Long-tailed Roller, in January, 1920, he was
a very ugly greenish-grey creature, with dreadfully dirty feathers. But
his tameness, coupled with the pleasure I found in acquiring a Roller,
which was certainly not the well-known Indian species, was quite
sufficient to make me happy. I did not know exactly which species
he belonged to, as several are found in Africa, and the information I had
about his native country was somewhat uncertain.
As my bird-rooms were not quite ready at the time, Mme. Lecallier
kindly took the Roller en jjension and at my next visit I saw some
lilac feathers appearing amongst the grey ones of the breast, showing
that beyond doubt the bird was the Long- tailed Roller, Coracias
caudatus.
He went through the moult within two months, and was in full
plumage in April. His tameness soon made him a pet and he flew about
loose in Mme. Lecallier&amp;apos;s bird-room until May. But then, the bird-room
having been closed for some reason, the Roller was confined in a cage,
and three weeks later had a fit and very nearly died. No doubt that was
occasioned by lack of exercise. My place being ready by this time, I
took the Roller with me and let him out in one of the bird-rooms.
He recovered in a few days, and has never ceased to be in perfect health
since. He moulted again in August, and is now in perfect plumage.
He has a roomy wooden cage, where he sleeps, and is left until 11 a.m.,
when the cleaning of the room is finished ; then he is let out and enjoys
liberty in the room until 8 p.m. He sits on the cages and on the top of
the aviaries, has some discussions with the Giant Barbet through the
wire of the aviary, and takes a flight almost every two minutes. When
I come in he flies to me, opens his wonderful blue wings in salute,
uttering his loud crow-like call, and he takes the keenest interest in
everybody and everything. His diet consists of insectile mixture, a
little raw meat, and half a dozen mealworms a day. He touches apples
sometimes, and altogether wants rather a large quantity of food.

imported alive into Europe before was the bird that the Berlin Zoological
Gardens had in 1912, and I think it did not live very long there.
The Long-tailed Roller is common throughout Central Africa, from
Angola to Zanzibar. It is a shy bird, living in hilly, wooded countries.
Like all its congeners it feeds on insects caught on the wing, and nests
in holes of trees. The plumage of the Long-tailed Roller is extremely
handsome : top of the head and hind neck, dark green ; white eye-
brows ; cheeks, violet chestnut ; throat and chest, rich lilac streaked
with white -- especially on the throat in my bird, this beautiful lilac
colour extends up to the cheeks, and there is very little difference in
the colouring of the cheeks and that of the breast ; underparts, light
turquoise blue ; back, greenish cinnamon ; wings, bright light blue and
rich dark blue ; light blue tail with central feathers dark greenish
blue, and the two outermost rectrices elongated, very pale blue with
black thin ends ; bill, black ; feet, grey. The males and females of this
species have the same plumage, so that I have no idea of the sex of
my bird.

The crime of civilization is its callous disregard of the wasteful
exploitations of wild life, which go on in the name of sport and
of commerce. What better off will the world be that the fur-seals and
right whales have ever existed on this planet when the last moth-eaten
garment is thrown on the rubbish-heap and the last cask of oil
exhausted ? What shall repay future generations for the barbarous
destruction of the beautiful Egrets and the ill-used Penguins that are
driven alive along roads ending over boiling caldrons in Maquari
Islands ? Who can tell what evils we are laying up for future
generations by this wanton destruction of Nature&amp;apos;s guardians of sea
and land ? A chain has but the strength of its weakest link. Slowly
and surely man is undermining the foundations on which life itself
rests. We know that there are some live forms whose work is so
important to man that living they are worth their weight in gold,

whereas, dead, their value is counted in pence or at most a few paltry
shillings.
Think of Australia, the wonderful world museum of antiquities,
with its living fossils, the one open living page of an otherwise long-
closed book ; of its faunal and floral types of a long-dead past ; its
aboriginal inhabitants belonging to the Stone Age !
Australia in the past has not proved worthy of this great charge,
which should have been held in trust for the whole world. Already
some of her unique treasures have gone into the eternal silences ;
others are perilously near the vanishing point. To many of her
scientists engrossed in the study of bones, relics and fossils, to which
so many give the higher value, are failing in their duty to the valuable
living types that are theirs to save -- the Marsupialia, Monotremata,
Flightless Birds, and the Mound-builders.
One of the most interesting of these living types is the Mallee Fowl
{Lipoa ocellata), inhabiting the waterless Mallee-lands of Western and
South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, and subsisting upon
seeds of the acacia, berries and insects, and drinking, apparently, only
dew-drops hanging from the leaves. Apart from the menace of the fox
and gun, the bird is doomed by the advance of settlement, for it
cannot exist in the open lands.
For many years I made a special study of this bird, making
periodical trips into the Mallee-lands, suffering heat, hunger, and thirst
in the big lone lands, sleeping beneath the stars with the scant tracery
of leaves overhead, and the scent of the broom in my nostrils, listening
to the solemn booming notes of the cock Mallee Fowl and pondering
the mysteries of creation.
It was thus I learnt much of the life-history of these wonderful
birds, even the art of mound-building, which I then occasionally built
and successfully worked at my camp. The absorbing interest attaching
to such a work was a sure preventative of any feeling of loneliness, and
four, five, and sometimes six weeks would slip by ere I broke camp and
left these solitudes. Expenses had to be met by capturing and supplying
to various zoological societies a few of these same Mallee Fowl. This
removal of pairs from the mounds finally settled the sex habit and
proved them not communistic as supposed, but solitary. It was in

these wilds I early disproved the statement (found in some of our
leading works on Australian birds) that the wing is used to sweep the
material together for the mound. This is never the case, the feet alone
being used.
Much of my work had to be done over and over again, but slowly
the life-history of this bird was unravelled. It is monogamic, and
apparently mates for life. The construction and maintenance of
mounds, chiefly performed by the male, entail a labour of about nine
months&amp;apos; duration. The birds choose a site that will be exposed to the
sun&amp;apos;s rays during the heat of the day, preferring a slope that faces the
sun. A pit is dug about 12 inches deep, the soil being banked around the
edge, and the measurement from bank to bank being from 7 to 9 feet.
The thick accumulation of debris (fallen leaves, bark, etc.) is then raked
from under the Mallee into the more open ways that lead to the pit.
By preference this is taken from the higher side of the pit, it being much
easier for the birds to rake it downwards than up the slope. When the
required material has all been raked into the clear open runs that lead
to the pit, the male, starting nearest to the pit, but facing outwards,
proceeds with a sweeping throwing motion of the foot to pass the
material behind him, a few strokes with each foot, then he moves
forward, keeping this up until he reaches the end of the row. Then
retracing his steps to the pit, he proceeds as before, keeping this going
at frequent intervals until the whole of the material is heaped high
in the pit, which is left awaiting the rains, and beyond occasional
stirrings of the surface there is not much done for a time. Then, as
spring approaches, the desiccation of the surface and core commences.
This work lasts a considerable time. We will suppose spring is here
and the hour is 9.30 a.m. The male appears, proud and dignified of
mien, the female sedately following, always, at this time of laying,
uttering at very frequent and regular intervals a low, soothing and
pleasing note, to which the male occasionally responds in a deeper
tone. Proceeding to the top of the mound, the birds, relieving each
other at intervals, make an excavation reaching into the loose core or
e gg-chamber, terminating the excavation in a small cup-like hole.
Placed against its solid wall, the female, with legs straddling across this
small hole, head down along her breast and facing the wall, presses

forward, opens her wings, slightly withdraws her head, and with that
movement the large pink egg slips into its prepared place. Her part is
now done -- she quietly glides away into the shade of a bush. The male
now gives his attention to the egg, which has probably fallen a little
out of the perpendicular. Choosing a spot about an inch away from the
egg, he thrusts his beak into the sand up to his forehead, then pushing
forward and using this sand as a cushion, he brings the egg to an upright
position. With the withdrawal of his head the sand falls and keeps
the egg upright and on its small end, in contact with the solid wall
of heating material. The reason for this action is twofold ; first, the
shell is too fragile for direct contact with the bird&amp;apos;s head, and second,
the falling sand prevents the egg from again falling forward. All eggs
in the egg-chamber must be so placed that the chicks emerge in the
right direction to gain their liberty. On their sides they would meet
their death against the hard walls of the egg-chamber. The male now
replaces the blanket of sand and fine leaf-material, sometimes covering
the eggs to a depth of about two feet. The thickness of this covering
has been noticed to vary with weather conditions. This hard and
laborious work during the heat of the day is done in several shifts,
and intervals of rest are taken. The period of incubation is about fifty-
five days. The heat required is from 85 degrees to 96 degrees Fahr.
The eggs are laid at intervals varying from three to seven or even eight
da vs. The number is about thirty, varying according to the age of the
bird and the season. There is also a big variation in the incubation
period, the extreme noted being in one case ninety-nine days. This
must have been due to retarded incubation.
In addition to bottom heat, a very frequent use is made of solar
heat, the mound being frequently opened out to within an inch or two
of the eggs, and, as the material gathers heat, it is replaced layer by layer,
the intervals allowing for the next layer to become heated. I have seen
the male putting on extra covering by moonlight as late as 8.30 p.m.
on the approach of a change in the weather. This is done to conserve
the heat that has been gathered during the day.
Both birds frequently test the heat of the egg-chamber. This is
done by thrusting the beak up to the forehead into its walls, and holding
it there for several seconds. I think they are guided by this test as to &amp;apos;
the amount of sun heat required.

We will suppose that two months have expired. The mound now
contains nine eggs and a chick which broke its shell at noon yesterday.
That it is near the surface we know by that slight depression. Its
shoulders are upward, and with them it is boring through the loose
sandy covering, ever pressing the falling sand under its feet. Its head
is bent down along its breast ; its nostrils protected by a shield of
bristles. There is a heaving motion with falling sand in the depression.
Another heave and a little head shoots into view, and a staggering chick
drops back into the hollow from which it has emerged. Its eyes are
closed ; it is perfectly still, resting after its subterranean journey,
which had lasted for twenty hours. It is 8 a.m., and the shadows of
the nearby mallee are just leaving the mound. The long journey
upward seems to be always made in the night. I have never known a
chick emerge during the heat of the day. They would surely perish
in the attempt, let alone clashing with the male&amp;apos;s duty of testing the
sun&amp;apos;s heat. Always they come in the cooler, quieter hours of early
morn. The chick lifts its head and takes its first long look around.
Then with a staggering run it disappears into the bushes.
A Bronzewing Pigeon barely alights on the mound, when from
an adjacent bush the cock Mallee rushes forth, crest up, plumage ruffled,
wings open, and dashes at the sacrilegious intruder. There is a sharp
clap clap of wings, and the pigeon is gone. Then comes a softly uttered
warning from &amp;quot;the bushes, and with one eye turned skyward the cock
gently lowers his body to earth. There he lies perfectly motionless,
his colours blending perfectly with the leaf-scattered soil. See ! just
a dark speck high in the blue ; it is a Wedge-tailed Eagle. Unwinking,
the eye of the Mallee follows the moving speck right into the glare of the
sun ; not a movement until that monster of the skies has passed from
view, then, with a softly uttered who-how, he again ascends the mound.
The female comes forth from her hiding and proceeds to scratch around
the base of that structure, intent on a beetle-hunt among the loose
(h&amp;apos;bris and coarser material there scattered. Meanwhile the male is
busy opening the mound. The chick we saw run into the bushes has
already taken up the burden of life. Should we give him a fright lie
will rise and fly a full hundred yards and again hide in a bush.
Independent and capable, he quickly acquires the wisdom of the bush

folk. His third season finds him calling and listening up and down the
long green aisles, ever seeking his kindred spirit that shall walk and
work with him through the ever changing seasons. Should he find a
mate some preparation is made for the coming season, but usually
it is the fourth season before domestic duties are taken up in earnest.
And now, though my wanderings in the Mallee have come to an
end, and much of the Mallee is a waste of shifting sand, yet the solemn
booming wh-whoo-oome, whoo-oome of the Mallee cock still falls upon
my ear ; in the silence of evening and early morn it is heard, and the
sound recalls the days of my wanderings.
I do not now need to hunt the lonely bush-lands for this beautiful
creature and its wonderful mounds, for. within 30 yards of where I sit
and write there are two complete mounds, one of which has been
producing chicks for the past six years. The other belongs to a young
pair, and is their first attempt. The birds are content, and would not
leave, but because of the foxes they have to be enclosed in netted yards r
which include plenty of shady bush-cover. Here, with our shyest of
wild creatures, I have proved that we can save from utter destruction
Australia&amp;apos;s valuable fauna. I have had good success with other species,
but I am proudest of the fact that I have won the confidence of this
most shy and retiring of Nature&amp;apos;s children of the bush, and done what
was said to be an impossibility -- bred these birds in captivity. Eggs
that I have weighed averaged two to the pound. They are of good
flavour, and are frequently hunted by the settlers for food.
The laws of nature are wise laws. The representatives of wild life,
native to each land and sea, we know, hold an important place in
nature, seemingly fitting into their places like bits of mosaic, each
important to all, all to each ; and subject to certain modifications, due
to civilization, the fauna of each country is best fitted to control the
balance of that country.

QUAIL BREEDING IN JAPAN

sake of their song. Hence the song of the domesticated Quail has

become very different from that of the wild birds. The domestic birds
sing &amp;quot; Qua grrrr &amp;quot;, instead of &amp;quot; Qua kali &amp;quot;, the usual wild song. The
Japanese praise this style of song, i.e. &amp;quot; Qua grrr &amp;quot;. It reminds one of
the sound of distant thunder, and high prices are asked for birds which
prolong the sound of &amp;quot; grrr &amp;quot; longest.
Those who like the Quails or to hear their song often meet together
with their Quails at a club, restaurant, or similar place, and judge the
song of the Quails, the best birds receiving a prize and being registered.
Many people name their Quails as they do race-horses. Such meetings
were often held in the Middle Tokugawa period, and the daimyos
and rich people of that period kept their favourite Quails in cages
made of precious wood, ivory, or raised lacquer, inlaid with gold, silver,
and shells, and decorated with beautiful coloured silk braid. It was
said that such cages were usually made in pairs, and the meetings were
held in the early morning, for the Quails sing their song best in the
morning or the evening. It is true that the Quails sing best at those
times, but at present many people disregard the time, for the Quails
sing quite freely at all hours while on show, performing repeatedly
against each other. During recent years an added interest in keeping
Quails is that the hen lays at least 150 to 250 eggs in one year, and the
laying season can be arranged at the will of the keeper. A further
interest lies in getting the Quails to lay in small cages, made of bamboo
bars, and measuring four-fifths of a foot square, the top being netted
over and the floor strewn with sand, the Quail being a species of game-
bird and addicted to sand-baths.
The birds are fed like the canary of England, in the sense that the
food is suspended at an opening at the side of the cage. Quails are fed
on a kind of soft food, called by the Japanese &amp;quot; Suriye &amp;quot;, which is
composed of river fish smoked, dried, and ground to a powder, and
mixed with meal of roasted rice and chaff. Bean-meal is sometimes
added to this. The animal food is called &amp;quot; Namaye &amp;quot; and the meal
&amp;apos; ; Kinako &amp;quot;, or &amp;quot; Ko &amp;quot;. The silver carp and a kind of dace (Leuciscus
macropus) are commonly used for &amp;quot; Namaye &amp;quot;, but the dace is said to
be preferable to any other fish. &amp;quot; Kinako &amp;quot; is composed of equal
parts of roasted rice-meal and chaff, and the quantity of bean-meal is
left to the will of the person who uses it. The usual proportions for the

mixture are one part of fish-food to two parts of meal. When the
Japanese wish the birds to lay they put the cage under artificial light
for about two or three hours after dark. At the same time the proportion
of animal food is sometimes increased by nearly one-half, but according
to my experience that is rather too strong for many birds. Some people
also put the birds all night long under artificial light, but I think this
also is not necessary, for I find no better results from this method.
After the birds have been fed with an increased proportion of animal
food for about a week or two the male birds begin to sing and the
females to utter a cry, something like the cry of the barn-door hen when
she wishes to lay. Sometimes the female lays an egg without any
preliminary announcement. When the males begin to sing and the
females to utter the cry, they are mated every morning by setting the
cages side by side and opening the entrances. After this the females
lay their egg once every day. Another way of testing the female&amp;apos;s
readiness to lay is to place one&amp;apos;s hand on the top of the cage, when if
the females are broody they lie down on the floor of the cage and utter
a cry which resembles the scolding cry which a hen utters when sitting.
The females lay six to seven eggs in succession, then cease for a day or
two before beginning again. I think it is better to stop the laying after
the keeper has obtained from fifty to sixty eggs and rest the birds
three or four weeks. It is very surprising that the eggs have increased
from one-third to twice their size since Quail breeding was first favoured.
It is very easy to stop the birds from laying by removing the cages from
under the artificial light at night, and keeping the birds in the dark.
The birds left in the dark very soon begin to moult. During the moult
we feed the birds with seeds. It is very interesting to note that the
time of laying is an hour later every day, and that when the female
finishes she announces the fact by a few cheerful cries.
The cages are washed and cleaned every two or three days, and if
the climate is hot and wet every other day, because the cages are small
and the food juicy, and the Quails need dry ground to stand on, like
other game-birds. The egg of the Quail is as large as the first thumb-
joint, measuring about one inch in length, and its colour is a pale
yellowish olive, splashed with dark-brown markings, which are some-
times large, sometimes small, sometimes dense, and sometimes sparse,

and the egg of a properly treated bird is chalky on the surface. Some
people say the egg which is not chalky is not fertile, but this is not
always true, for I have obtained chicks from some which were not
chalky. The eggs can be hatched under a bantam-hen or in an
incubator, which I find answers equally well.
The chicks come out from the eggs in about sixteen or seventeen
days. After leaving the shell they are kept without any food or treat-
ment by the keeper for about twenty or twenty-four hours. The chicks
which are under twenty or twenty-four hours&amp;apos; old are too weak to be
left alone, though they are very active soon after hatching, and if we
transfer such young birds from the foster-mother to the nursing-box
they will at first run about here and there, seemingly very happy, but
alas ! one by one they become faint and die from exhaustion. Some-
times they survive the exhaustion, but many such birds have malformed
legs, and are quite unable to stand or walk, owing to imperfect
ossification of the legs.
When the chicks are put in a nursing-box another clutch of eggs
can be placed under the hen. The hen can sit on two consecutive
sittings. The chicks in a nursing-box are fed with the paste mentioned
in the former paragraph, by plastering it on a board which leans
diagonally against the wall of the box. The one thing the breeder should
always bear in mind is that the paste often adheres to the chick&amp;apos;s bill
and covers the nostrils and eyes. This often blinds or suffocates the
birds. Hence the breeder must watch them, and if he finds the paste
sticking to the bill he must remove it without delay. If the paste on
the bill hardens it can be removed with ease by cleaning the bill with
a piece of wet cloth. The nursing-box, in size 1 foot by 2 |feet, is
partitioned into two chambers by a screen, one chamber measuring
2 feet, and the other 6 inches. The latter, heated by a lamp or other
apparatus such as is used in a vivarium, is the bedroomfor the chicks,
which when put in the box can already run about easily, and soon find
their food and learn how to eat. I find it better at first to put the food
board at a distance of about two-thirds of the length of the large
chamber from the screen, and to draw it further away as the chicks
grow, and to have the paste at first very moist, then by degrees to get
it drier, until the ordinary consistency is reached.

When the chicks grow as large as the chick of a domestic fowl, we
stop heating the bedroom, except on cold or wet days. When they
change their down to feathers the chicks are treated in the same manner
as the parent birds. They mature at the end of three months. In this
way the Japanese easily propagate their Quail families from a small
stock, and obtain in a short time many eggs to eat and birds to give
them song. The eggs are very good to eat when put in soup or jelly,
boiled, and also fresh. I find the fresh, uncooked egg nicer than the
hen&amp;apos;s egg, since it is richer, although not so strong as the duck&amp;apos;s egg.
Some persons are over confident that Quail&amp;apos;s eggs have more
nourishment than the hen&amp;apos;s, and in the olden times the Japanese
thought them a good medicine for a paralytic.
The flesh of the Quail fed on soft food is not good for eating purposes.
They must be fed upon seeds and grains some weeks before being used
for the table. Then the flesh is very delicious.

Breeding the Kagu. -- Our member Mr. G. A. Heumann, writing
from his home in New South Wales, tells of the successful breeding of
the Kagu in his aviaries. When he wrote in November the young bird
was nine weeks old, and still being fed by its parents, who were most
attentive to its needs, one or other being always with it. The young
bird, he says, always runs between its parents, and unlike most chicks
which follow their mother, the young Kagu makes its parents follow it.
The Amethyst Starling. -- The Zoological Society has received
a beautiful specimen of the South African form of the Amethyst
Starling (Pholidauges leucogaster verreauxi), presented by its corre-
sponding member, Dr. Harold Miller, Superintendent of the Zoological
Gardens at Durban. The Society has only once before possessed an
Amethyst Starling, a specimen of the typical form from West Africa
presented by Dr. Hopkinson, but these are not the only ones that have
been imported. Mr. Hamlyn had some four or five specimens in one
of his South African consignments some few months ago, which were,
I believe, bought by Mons. Delacour. Amethyst Starlings are some of
the most beautiful of the Glossy Starlings, the whole of the upper surface

being of a brilliant metallic copper colour with purple and violet
reflections, while the under-surface from the chest downwards is pure
white. The typical form Pholidauges leucogaster occurs in West as well
as in North-east Africa, while P. I. verreauxi, which differs in having
white on the outer tail-feathers, is confined to South Africa, and a third
form, P. sharpei, occurs in East Africa.
Sexing Birds. -- I think there is a great deal in the theory put
forward by Miss Knobel as to the distance apart of the pelvic bones
in the sexes of birds. It is well known amongst poultry-keepers that
these bones are considerably farther apart in a bird that is in laying
condition than in one that is not laying, in fact, hens and pullets are
constantly examined to ascertain if they are laying or not. At the
Zoological Gardens a few hens are kept as foster-mothers for young
Pheasants, etc., and during last year a fair number of young Silkies
were reared for this purpose ; there are three cockerels and a number of
pullets, and I have examined these. I find that in the cocks the two
bones are barely half an inch apart, this dimension being exceeded
by all of the pullets. Some of the latter have commenced to lay, and
these have the pelvic bones more than an inch apart ; in one case
the distance was an inch and three-qaurters, while in those birds that
had not commenced to lay the distance was about three-quarters of
an inch.

Equally interesting is the first part of a paper by Mr. Harrison F.
Lewis on the nesting of the Philadelphia Vireo (Vireosylva
philadelphica). This is couched in the form of a diary of observations
extending from June 11 to July 3, 1919, and the facts recorded attest
a degree of perseverance and patience on the part of the observer which
will appeal to all lovers of wild birds. Mr. H. Mousley continues his
notes on the birds of Hatley, Stanstead Co., Quebec, adding five species
to the list published in 1918&amp;apos;; and Mr. Horace W. Wright publishes the
known records of the occurrence of the Bohemian Waxwing (Bombycilla
(jarrula) in New England, frequently in the company of the Cedar
Waxwing {Bombycilla cedrorum). Other papers dealing with systematic
ornithology call for no special notice ; but it may be added that the
part concludes with more than twenty pages of general notes on
American birds and with reviews of recent literature.
Early Annals of Ornithology. By J. H. Gurney, F.Z.S. London :
H. F. &amp; G. Witherby. 1921. Price 12s. 6r/. net.
Members of the Avicultural Society familiar with Mr. J. H. Gurney&amp;apos;s
book on the Gannet will not be disappointed with his latest achievement,
Early Annals of Ornithology. Starting in the first chapter with the
prehistoric sketches left by men of the early and later Stone Ages, the
pictures of ancient Egypt and the bas-reliefs of Babylon, with references
to the written records in the Bible and classical literature, Mr. Gurney
deals in order with the centuries of the Christian era, telling us about
the birds known in Britain to the Komans, Saxons, and Picts, and so
on down to the eighteenth century, finishing up with Pennant. There
are numerous quotations from ancient writers and many reproductions
of old engravings, and naturally there is a good deal to be said about
hawking in the past ; but perhaps, if a selection be made, the most
interesting section of the book is the chapter dealing with the history
of the Crane, Bustard, Spoonbill, and Bittern in Great Britain, a chapter
sandwiched in between those treating of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.
From what has been said it may be inferred that the bibliographical
work involved in the compilation of the volume has been considerable,

and Mr. Gurney is to be congratulated upon having compressed his
extensive subject-matter into some 230 pages. After the Monotonous
publication of book after book upon British Birds, each one little more
than a repetition of its predecessor, it has been a great treat to us to
read Mr. Gurney&amp;apos;s work, and we most cordially recommend it to
members of our Society. It is well produced in every way, and is
illustrated with maps and photographs as well as with the copies of
old engravings above referred to.

Mr. F. E. Blaauw, in his beautiful monograph on the Cranes, while
protesting against the further splitting up of the family, admits three
genera, and places the White Asiatic Crane in the second genus,
Anthropoides, with the Demoiselle, Wattled, Stanley, and the White-
naped species.
According to Mr. Blaauw&amp;apos;s views, the White-naped and the Crane
under notice are closely related. Extremely little is known of the
habits of the A. leucogeranus, except what has been written about it
by Mr. A. 0. Hume ; and all subsequent writers quote at length from
his very detailed and graphic description, for there is no other
information accessible about the bird in its wild state.
Hume wrote of the bird as he knew it wintering in Northern India,
hut not very much is to be learned of birds which we only know as
winter visitors, as then they are mainly occupied by questions of food
and self-preservation Pallas describes the nest, which he found in
1773, and I believe no recent writer has seen this Crane in its summer
home in the Siberian morasses. I have had four or five of these Cranes
at various times, but, apart from its beauty, have found the bird less
friendly to its owner and generally less interesting than most members
of the family. But I have not had the fortune to possess a good pair
and we never had a nesl here. At Lilford I believe eggs have been
laid, hut they were unfertile, and the splendid pair at the London

Zoological Gardens have often nested and incubated steadily, with no
better result, and I think this Crane has not bred in cajitivity in Europe.
There is one portion of Hume&amp;apos;s description of this bird to which I should
like to draw attention. He says that he examined over twenty
specimens (killed between October and March), and that he never
found a trace of any animal food in their stomachs. He considered it
exclusively a vegetable feeder, for he only found &amp;quot; rush seeds, bulbs,
conns, and even leaves of aquatic plants &amp;quot;, but never found remains of
fish, reptiles, or grain. But though this was the case in India and in
winter, I have seen enough of this bird to cause me to feel sure that it is
otherwise at other seasons of the year. I have found it a confirme&amp;lt; I egg-
stealer, and I believe that this has been the case at Lilford also. I once
haw one of my White Cranes carrying off a Great Bustard&amp;apos;s egg, with the
contents dripping on to the ground while the disconsolate mother
followed mournfully behind the robber at a few yards distance, and I
have elsewhere in the Magazine recorded the intelligent way in which
my White Cranes stationed themselves at dusk near some high wire
netting fences and strode off when they heard the netting struck to
pick up the beetle before it could get on the wing again.
My impression is that this Crane requires at least as much animal
food in confinement as the other species. It also should, if possible,
have access to some pond or shallow stream, for it is very aquatic in
its habits.

The sciences of ornithology and aviculture are intimately con-
nected. Each has much to learn from the other. Many of the problems
of the lives of birds can only be solved through the keeping of them
in confinement. I think there are amongst ornithologists some who do
not set much reliance on the behaviour of aviary birds in such matters
as seasonal changes of plumage, the assumption of mature or breeding
plumage, periods of incubation, breeding habits, the manner of rearing
their young, etc. The skilled aviculturist can tell at once when con-
finement, diet, or environment in any way alters the natural order of
his charges&amp;apos; lives.

The ages to which birds live in a purely natural state can only lie
uric, but as many species, including small passerine birds, live
long lives in confinement, it may be assumed that without accident
at least the same ages would be attained in a wild state. Keepers of
Waterfowl can note the changes of plumage of both sexes in their birds
far more correctly than it is possible to note them from skins or from
observing wild birds, as it is impossible to tell the ages of the latter
with any certainty. Wildfowl, of course, can be kept in a condition
almost the same as in nature. The extraordinary habits of the Sand-
grouse in conveying water to their young by the male saturating his
breasl could never have been discovered except by accident in a wild
state, while the curious seasonal changes of plumage would have
remained a puzzle. The age to which these birds live could never have
been guessed by those who only know them wild or as skins. The
aviculturist has. I believe, not by any means overcome some of the
problems of aviculture. Why do the Flamingoes keep their rose-
coloured feathers in full beauty for years in confinement, often under
extremely unnatural feeding, while the Scarlet Ibis loses its colour at
once and never recovers it, but remains dull pink ? I am not sure that
sy to get the Linnet to retain its rose colour after having
moulted out in a cage ? While the Rose Finches never do ; the
i.mes the full red colour after moulting. The Pine
Grosbeak keeps in perfect colour for years. Yellow and pink are the
i wo colours which remain a puzzle ; in many cases when lost these never
are regained in their full brilliance. An example of this is in the Great
and Lesser Birds of Paradise. The yellow of the head in the adult birds
is replaced in confinement by a yellowish cream, all other colours are
replaced as in nature : the same applies to the twelve-wired Bird of
Paradise, Seleucides niger.
It is by studying birds in confinement alone that the question of
hange in feathers can be proved. My own experience is that
is no change in the colour of any feather when it is once grown
beyond that of intensity of colouring dependent on the vigour of the
bird, all change must come through moult, tip-moulting, or abrasion.
It is to be hoped thai these various questions may be taken up by
members of the Society. There is much of real interesl in them both

While staying for a short period this year in Corsica I was able to
observe a few of the birds there ; but unfortunately my notes are
brief and unscientific, for I had two handicaps -- first, having no
binoculars with me and, secondly, having with me a friend who took
not the slightest interest in ornithological matters ; this latter was
perhaps the most trying.
How different is Corsica in the way of bird life from Southern
France and Italy, where most of the sweet songsters are transformed
into !i petits oiseaux &amp;quot;, as they are called on the menu. Corsica is
teeming with bird life and one could spend a delightful holiday in the
spring time &amp;quot;bird- watching&amp;quot;. How so many of these so-called
ornithologists can go about as I have seen them do shooting down every
feathered creature whose species they are not sure of is beyond me.
If on a holiday 1 were to kill only one bird T should feel the &amp;quot; pangs
of conscience &amp;quot; for the rest of the time.
One of the first of the feathered tribe that meets the eye is the
Chaffinch -- he seems everywhere, and is much commoner than the
sparrow ; the latter seems to keep on the outskirts of the towns, and
is much cleaner and lighter in colour than his English brethren, and
several I saw had black crescent-shaped marks on the Hanks; indeed,
Passer domesticus looked so different that my friend was sure that
they were Whitethroats !
Another very common finch is the lovely Goldfinch. Around
Calvi there were literally hundreds. They frequented the waste ground
by the sea, and seemed to he feeding from the dead heads of the thistle
and teazel ; but upon examination of these heads there was no trace
of seed in them . Unfortunately one sees many of these bright songsters
in tiny cages hanging outside the poorer class of houses in Corsica.
Greenfinches are also numerous, and at Ajaccio flocks were seen in
the orchards near the town. In these orchards were also seen the lovely
little Citril and Serin Finches. The types of these finches inhabiting
Corsica are supposed to differ from those on the mainland ; they are
cheerful, restless little birds, always moving from the ground to the

lives and back again. I saw them often in the company of Green-
finches : their song was heard from an olive- or orange-tree, and it was
something like that of the Goldfinch. Another bird that was noticed
near Ajaccio was the Crossbill, hut of the species I am not sure. I
dare say it was the common kind. These birds we saw in the fir- and
pine-trees, and they first attracted our attention by their incessant
chatter which was kept up all the while they were feeding. Several
pine cones that seemed to be torn to pieces were found under the trees.
This was no doubt the work of the Crossbills.
Several Marsh Buntings were seen, or at least I think thatthev were.
These birds are somewhat like the Reed Bunting, but larger and darker
in colour. A very common bird just outside the towns was the
&amp;lt; "i tolan Bunting. One saw little parties of about three to six searching
for food on the roads. They seemed very tamo, and would allow
approach within about ten yards of them. There were many other
kinds of Buntings, but I was quite unable to distinguish their species.
There were also Pipits which haunted the seashore, but the Pipit family
air usually dark and with very little difference between the species,
so they are hard to identify at a distance. Skylarks were common,
too. Thrushes and Blackbirds were far from being numerous, their
scarcity being due to the fact that they were in demand for the &amp;quot; pet &amp;quot;.
1 noticed several Thrushes on the rocks by the sea at Ajaccio. They
were about the size of a Blackbird and of a dark-brown colour with
the chin, throat, and breast rufous. They moved about in the same
manner as a Dipper, jerking the tail and flirting the wings. Whal
species they were 1 do not know; perhaps some other member of
the Society can enlighten me.
The most charming bird to my mind was the sweet little Sardinian
Warbler. He seemed everywhere -- away in the mountains, by the sea-
shore, and even in the hotel gardens, lie is somewhat after the same
style as the Dart fold Warbler, only stouter in build. The head is
jet black and the whole of the underparts pure white ; the upper parts
are delicate grey, the long tail is dark grey with the outer feathers
white, the iris is bright yellow, which gives the bird a rather unique
appearance He is a restless and lively little bird, and hops continually

cultivated parts by the seashore, and every now and then flies on
to the topmost branch of a bush and surveys the world, swelling his
white throat and jerking his tail meanwhile, but as soon as one
approaches dives into the bushes again. The coloration of this
little bird makes him one of the most noticeable of the smaller Corsica n
birds in the winter time, though in the summer time he would be
outrivalled by the gorgeous Rollers and Bee-eaters.
The Dartford Warbler I only saw once, and that was near Calvi.
It was behaving in the same way as the Sardinian Warbler. Blackcaps
are very common, and one sees them everywhere, especially in the palm-
trees, searching for insects at the base of the huge leaves.
Numerous yellowish green warblers were seen in the trees and
bushes near the towns. These may have been Yellow-browed
Warblers. Great Tits and Blue Tits were comparatively common in
the orchards, as was the familiar Robin, which looked quite out of
place perched on the cactu
The Stonechat was very noticeable everywhere one went. One was
sure to see him either perched on some dead plant or on the telegraph
wires uttering his strange no
Wagtails were numerous, especially the yellow ones. I think these
must have been Grey-headed Wagtails. These were one of the few
birds one saw in the streets of the towns ; Pied Wagtails were also
seen, Inn wh I hey were ! il&amp;lt;&amp;gt; not know, for ornithologists have
divided the Pied Wagtails into so many different races that I hesitate
to identify them. A bird that I was very glad to see was the Kite.
One evening we counted more than a dozen sailing gracefully over the
little mountain town of Corte ; they remained for hours sailing on
outstretched pinions ; their long forked tails seemed to be on a pivot,
for while the bird seemed to be perfectly still hovering in the air, the
tail was moving from side to side all the time and sometimes seemed to
be almost at right angles to the body. I suppose we should see these
graceful birds in Britain and many others as well if it were not for the
wretch with the gun. Buzzards were not very common. I only saw
two and they were flying very low down over the fields, evidently
looking for food. Kestrels were very much in evidence, and were
much tamer than those in England. Evidently they are not persecuted

so much. Their favourite perch seems to be the telegraph wires by
the roadside.
Hooded Crows are very common, but they seem to be a differenl
race from those we see in England and France ; they are much lighter
in colour, and at a distance seem black and white. Indeed, my friend
often mistook them for Magpies. Round the sea coast they swarm* d,
rinding their food no doubt from the various mollusca thrown up by
the tide. With these Crows were often one or two Carrion Crows,
which seemed never to wander very far from the seashore. I have
just noticed in The Practical Handbook of British Birds that the Common
Hooded Crow is &amp;quot; replaced by another form in Corsica &amp;quot;.
Of wading birds and gulls we saw very little; the Black-headed
and Herring Gulls were the only ones seen. I may mention here,
if it is not out of place, that while staying in the Maritime Alps in
France I saw several examples of that charming bird, the Wall Creeper,
flying about over the snow, the rich crimson of the wings making a
pleasing contrast with the white surface of the rocks. Surely these
little birds cannot be so very delicate to endure such cold.
This brings to a close the list of birds that I was able to identify.
There were many more seen, but, as I have stated before, having no
glas es and an uninterested friend, I was unable to devote much time
to watching the birds, but some time in the future I hope to visit
Corsica again and to spend a longer and a more profitable time amongst
the birds, not with the object of collecting sub-species, but to get
a glance at their lives and uot #0 take those lives on the mere excuse
of benefiting science. Do we not get infinitely more pleasure studying
these feathered jewels in their own sittings than comparing musty
skins 1 Have we gained much knowledge in comparison to the
thousands and thousands of lives that have been taken to supply our
collectors&amp;apos; cabinets and museums { I venture to say no. But 1 have

places for the bird-lover, for there so many different kind- of birds are

In the January number of VOiseau the following note appears.
The larger of the two medals, it will be observed, may be won by
aviculturists in any European country.
&amp;quot;In addition to the awards which the Societe Nationale d&amp;apos;Acclimata-
tion already bestows annually for work appertaining to ornithology
and aviculture, a medal (large size) may henceforth be won by anyone
succeeding in rearing in Europe a species of bird or a hybrid bird
which has not previously been reared in captivity. A medal (small
size) may also be bestowed on the breeder who shall rear, under the
same conditions, the first bird, or hybrid bird , in France. These medals
will be awarded by the Award Committee of the Society. On every
medal the name of the breeder and of the bird will be inscribed. Anyone
desiring to compete must send to the president of the ornithological
section, within a period of approximately two months of the birth of
the bird, a detailed report, which will be published in VOiseau. The
report must give a complete description of the nest, the eggs, and the
chicks. All proofs, and any possible details which might be inquired
into, should be given. The young bird will be considered reared when
it is in a position to feed itself without the help of the parents. The
hi ids bred must be the property of the breeder, who may, however,
cede his rights to the award to the person who controls his breeding
establishment.
&amp;quot; The medals will be awarded as soon after the receipt of the report
as possible ; they will be distributed at a special award meeting. In
all cases the Award Committee will be the only judges as to whether
a medal should in any particular case be awarded or not, and their
decisions must be regarded as final.&amp;quot;

Australian Birds.-- It is doubtful whether aviculturists will avail
themselves to any extent of the offer of Australian birds made by the
Australian Zoological Control Board, for the prices asked are, to say
the least of it, high. It appears that a few persons have been entrusted
by the Government with the whole of the wild animal trade of Australia .
and they have been thus enabled to corner the market. Nothing must
be sold out of the country except by them, and they can charge what
prices they like. Moreover, the prices asked are for the stock on board
ship in Australia, the purchaser to take all the risk on the voyage and to
pay the freight. Thus, for a pair of newly caught White Cockatoos,
birds which are regarded as vermin in wheat-growing districts, and are
worth no more than #5 or #6 a pair in England, we are asked to pay
#6 before the specimens have started on their voyage. Very few
aviculturists will buy birds under these conditions, and if the Control
Board wishes to do business they must send a consignment in charge
of a qualified attendant, to be sold here for what they will fetch.
South African Birds.-- Messrs. Gamage have been receiving
collections of South African birds lately, and several rarities have been
offered at prices which in these days arc not excessive. On a recenl
visit I noticed a cage containing a number of Pied Starlings (Spreo
bicolor), a brown and white bird with a very conspicuous whitish yellow
iris and yellow base to the otherwise black bill. The species has never
before been imported so far as 1 am aware, although it is abundant
in many parts of South Africa. Another cage contained some six or
seven Amethyst Starlings (Pholidauges I. verreauxi), of which 1 wrote
in these notes last month. There was one fine example of the splendid
Black-collared Barbel [Lybius torquatus), two Levaillant&amp;apos;s Barbets,and
a large number of Red-collared and Red-shouldered Whydahs.
Young Kagu. -- Mr. Heumann sends me further information about
his young Kagu, which he says is now as big as its parents and quite
able to take care of itself. The parents, he says, &amp;quot; are teaching it to
.sing out in the mornings, which is very funny, as its voice is cracking.*&amp;apos;
One envies Australian aviculturists their splendid climate, where the
breeding of foreign birds seems to be a much easier matter than it is

A New Book ox Australian Birds. -- Messrs. H. F. &amp; G. Witherby

of Australia. It contains about 300 pages, and is illustrated with ten
coloured and thirty-six monochrome plates, and the price is #3 3s.
per volume. Volume i deals with the Orders Casuarii and Columb^e.
Mandarin Ducks and Japanese Teal. -- During the past few-
weeks both Mandarin Ducks and Japanese Teal have been imported
and offered at a reasonable price. These are wild caught birds and
unpinioned and a very valuable addition to the ornamental waterfowl
in this country, as none had been imported since pre-War days, and
stocks which have not died out altogether or been disposed of on account
of the impossibility of providing food during the period of food-shortage
have become in-bred. Moreover, these species are two of the most
beautiful of the ornamental dinks.
Carolina Ducks. -- Perhaps the most beautiful of all the ornamental
waterfowl is the Carolina, or Wood Duck, of North America. The War
has reduced its numbers in Europe in the same way as it has affected
all oaptive birds that were not considered useful as food-providers,
and it is not easy to obtain these birds now. In America, their habitat,
they had been nearly exterminated when the Bird Protection laws saved
them, and in parts the species is slowly recovering. But they will
never again be imported, and we must rely upon those bred in Europe
to keej} up the stock in this country. Fortunately the species was well
established in Europe before the War, and probably it may be
obtainable on the Continent. I do not know what has happened to the
large numbers that formerly frequented the Berlin Zoological Gardens,
where they were full-winged and bred freely in nest-boxes and natural
hollows in the trees.
In the New York Zoo. -- Mr. L. S. Crandall has kindly sent me

in which are described some recent collections of birds, and a splendid

lot they make. The finest lot was received in November Erom thai
well-known collector Mr. E. S. Joseph, and included species Erom
every part of Australia, as well as from Tasmania, New Zealand,
New Guinea, New Caledonia, and the Caroline Islands. Shipping
difficulties had prevented transportation since 1917, so that the
accumulation of several years was ready when space finally became
available, and the collection is the finest that has been received in
America for many years. Thirty-five species had never before been
represented in the Zoological Park, and several were quite new to
aviculture. The birds received include a pair of Prince Rudolph&amp;apos;s
Bird of Paradise (Paradisornis rudolfi), the beautiful blue bird from
the Owen Stanley Mountains in South-East New Guinea, three Six-
plumed Birds of Paradise (Parotia sefilata), two Rifle-birds, and a green
Manucode. Alexandra and Turquoisine Parakeets arrived, the former
having been thought to be extinct. Keas and the rare Kaka came from
Xew Zealand, while the collection of Pigeons included the very rare
White-fronted Bronze-wing (Henicophaps albifrons) from New Guinea .
Mr. Joseph. -- It is to be hoped that before long Mr. Joseph will
favour this country with a visit and bring with him a collection such
as he has recently conveyed to America. He is described as &amp;quot; tall in

A Practical Handbook of British Birds. Pt. x, vol. ii, pp. 81-176.
Witherby &amp; Co., 326 High Holborn, W.C. 1. Price is. U. net.
We are favoured with a copy of part x of this excellent publication.
which is to be completed in eighteen parts, and will form by far the
most up-to-date and practical handbook of the day on British birds.
The subject has been treated of extensively and books on British
birds are numerous, but there are very few that one can name as being
absolutely reliable and free from the common fault of copying from
previous authors. Saunders&amp;apos; Manual was the best book of its day,
and at the present time we know of no other that excels it in usefulness
and reliability ; but the last edition appeared in 1899, since which
date not only has much been added to our knowledge regarding the
various local races of species, but the habits of certain species have
somewhat changed, their range extended or decreased, and it was
quite time that another work by the best authorities on the subject
was produced. We are glad that this presenl production is not the
work of one author alone, for no one person can know all there is to
know on so large a subject even as that of British birds, for the term
includes every species which at any time visits this country. The
present book has been divided into sections, and these have been placed
in charge of the following six authors, each of whom is an authority
on one or more particular group : Dr. E. Hartert, Miss Annie C. Jackson,
Rev. F. C. R. Jourdain, Mr. C. Oldham, Dr. N. F. Ticehurst, and
Mr. H. F. Witherby.
The form of the work is eminently practical and under the name
of the species we find a full description, both of the adult male, adult
female, nestling, juvenile plumage (in some cases both of the male
and female), winter and summer plumage, measurements, characters,
and allied forms, field characters, breeding habits, food and distribution,
both in the British Isles and abroad.
The part before us deals with the birds of prey, and contains many
excellent figures of a particularly useful kind, showing the difference
between allied forms or species. Thus, on page 131, we have outlines
of the bills and middle toes of the Golden and Sea Eagles, showing at

blue in T. cana and T. cyanoptera, and violet in T. sclateri. -- D. S.-S.]

Sirs, -- T have recently had several small Glossy Starlings
{Lanijrocolias) which 1 do not remember possessing before. They are
the smallest I have ever had, and at first, without reference, I thought
t Ley were L. chalcurus. As far as one can possibly describe changeable-
hued birds of this kind, the salient features are small size, prevailing
shining golden green plumage, noticeably dark patch surrounding eye
and ear coverts and rump feathers exactly s&amp;lt;i,te colour as mantle ami
hack. The upper appearance of tail rich peacock copper green. Irides
same rich yellow as in the Purple-headed Glossy Starling, L. purpureas,
a bird almost twice as large. They are an interesting change from
L. chalybeus, the so-called Green Glossy Starling. The outline of bill
and head is much more curved in this small species than in L.chalybeus.

only able to refer to a B.M.C. and not a set of skins. All avicult mists

dealer and several females from another for males. Although males
in full plumage are usually larger, more handsome, and more brilliant
on the ear-patch, breast-patch, and flight feathers than females.
immature birds are difficult to sex when dirty. I have, however, never
heard an adult female sing the rich sustained Black-cap song of the
male, and have never heard a male call in the high-pitched voice of the
female. Cocks caged in pairs, when in high condition, fight brutally,
and cocks and hens when first introduced skirmish ; but once this is

to give them great pleasure. I was glad also to see again and have some
Red-breasted Marsh Birds (Leistes superciliaris) and their counter-

T. defillippi, having a Light streak at base of mandible in addition to
superciliary streak. Can anyone tell me whether a hen of T. militaris
ever has a bill as short and as stout as that of Leistes superciliaris. as
I have a bird which I take to be a large Leisles out of colour that was
sent me for a hen Military Troupia] ? I think it must be over fifteen
years since 1 boughl either of these birds alive, but I never remember
a hen Military Starling having a bill as thick as a MarshBird. When one
lives away from London it is very difficult to settle these points to one&amp;apos;s
satisfaction.

Sirs, -- On January 10, 1921, the male in the London Gardens gave
an outburst of affection to the female, which was interesting to watch.
When she was standing quiet he kept walking from side to side, passing
in front of her each time, his neck fully erect with short beak resting
on throat feathers, and at intervals spreading out the tail and uttering
two distinct notes frequentlv -- a guttural &amp;quot; ka ; &amp;apos; and a sound best
described as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;musical gobble&amp;quot;. The female frequently replied to
the latter ; but did not make a &amp;quot; ka &amp;quot; in reply to the male, although

QUAILS IN CONFLICT

<bodyText confidence="0.995214833333333" page_id="9396819"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
Sirs, Whether any species fight frequently when wild seems to
me to be difficult to decide owing to their small size. It seemed to be,
therefore, worth recording that two female Indian Button Quail
(Turnix tanki) fought (in the small bird-house of the Gardens) to a
fatal ending on December 24, 1920 (as you are probably already aware) .
My attention was called by a visitor to the quarrel ; and by the
time I arrived at the cage (being, when spoken to, at the further end
of the house) one bird was apparently already dead, because the other
was standing on it and pecking very vigorously at its rump area.

which suggested thai the conflict had been &amp;quot;shorl and hot &amp;quot;&amp;apos;.
because there was no disturbance in the cage a few min ites b &amp;apos;fore, I and

failure brought a sudden end to the fight. Apparently the victor was
still enraged even after we removed the corpse of its victim, judging
by the fad that a few minutes later 1 found it fighting with an Indian
Jungle Bush-Quail (Pedicula asiatica); but it had to retreat speedily
before this larger opponent ! Discretion was the better part of valour

here ! Having read with great interest the account of Quail breeding
in Japan (pp. 24-8) by Mr. N. Taka-Tsukasa, might I inquire of him
whether the birds there (apparently Coturnixjajionica, though no species
name given) quarrel when wild to his knowledge ?
Perhaps readers acquainted with Indian life could also give some
information as to pugnacious behaviour about the species above referred
to by me.

[Dr. Welch was mistaken in his identification of the Quails, as the
only two examples of Turnix tanki in the Gardens of late were a true
pair of which the female died from egg-binding in February. Conflicts
between birds in the wild state are not common, because there is plenty
of space for all. -- Ed.]

Sirs, -- The songs and cries of birds and mammals have always
interested me, and on more than one occasion I have mentioned in
print the fact that the monotonous song of the Cirl Bunting is often
impossible to distinguish from that of the Lesser White-throat.
Several &amp;apos;&amp;quot;closet naturalists&amp;quot; have shaken their heads over such
an assertion; indeed, one of our popular catch-and-label-your-new-
sub-species school mocked at the very idea of anybody who professed
to know one British bird from another mistaking the song of the Cirl
Bunting for that of the Lesser White-throat.
Therefore, I was not a little uplifted to find to-day on reading
what Montagu, the first man to recognize the Cirl Bunting in this
country, had to say about this very point.
Perhaps you will allow me. to quote his words from his famous
Dictionary of British Birds ? Of the Cirl Bunting he writes : &amp;quot; The
monotonous song of the male was incessant, shrill, and piercing ; so
ii inch resembling the vociferous call notes of the Babillard, that it
requires considerable knowledge of their language not to mistake the
one for the other.&amp;quot;

THE CEDAR WAXWING
(Ampelis cedrorum)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.998811545454545" page_id="9396823"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
There are three species of the genus Ampelis, the Waxwings, the
best-known being the Common or Bohemian Waxwing, A. garrulus,
which visits this country at irregular intervals, sometimes in considerable
numbers. Its habitat is the Arctic portions of both hemispheres.
The second species is the Cedar Waxwing, which occurs over the whole
of temperate North America, migrating south in winter to Guatemala
and the West Indies ; and the third is the Japanese Waxwing {A.
japonicus). All three species are very much alike in plumage, the
prevailing colour being soft reddish-brown, the head carrying an
erectile crest. The face is ornamented with black and the wings tipped
with yellow in A. garrulus and A. cedrorum, and red in A. japonicus.
In the Common Waxwing some of the secondary wing-feathers have
the shafts tipped with wax-like appendages, and in adult birds these
sometimes occur on the tail feathers as well. The Cedar Waxwing
has less of the red tips and the Japanese bird none at all.
The Cedar Waxwing is very rarely imported to Europe, but at the
present time a fine specimen is exhibited at the Zoological Gardens,
where it can readily be compared with the commoner species which
is also represented. It is a smaller bird, and in addition to the differences
mentioned above it will be observed that the flanks are yellowish-olive
instead of brownish-grey and the under tail-coverts are white instead
of chestnut as in A. garrulus.

In his letter published in the last November number of this journal
Mr. Barnby Smith describes a nest of this species which he saw in
a British Columbia apple-orchard in which the material used was
string. As a rule the materials employed are twigs and rootlets, the
structure being lined with feathers. Soon after Mr. Barnby Smith&amp;apos;s
visit to Canada I received a letter from his nephew, Mr. Vernon Darney,
enclosing the photographs, which are herewith reproduced, of the
Cedar Waxwing with its young. He wrote from Walhachin, B.C. :
&amp;quot; My uncle, Mr. Barnby Smith, has just been out here en route for New
Zealand, and while he was here I introduced him to a man who is very
keenly interested in all wild life. Among other things he showed us were
photos of a Cedar Waxwing and young. My uncle asked me to obtain
copies and send them to you, as they might interest some of the readers
of the Avicultural Magazine. They were taken by Mr. John M. Schreck
in an apricot orchard at Naramata, British Columbia, in 1911.
Naramata is in the famous fruit-growing district of the Okanagan.&amp;quot;
The food of Waxwings consists of insects and berries, and they are
not difficult to keep in captivity providing their diet is not of too
fattening a nature. They are very fond of soaked dried currants,
and these seem to be a very wholesome food with the addition of a small
quantity of good insectivorous food.

By the Marquess op Tavistock
For many years it has been one of my avicultural ambitions to
possess a tame Pearl-spotted Owlet (Glaucidium perlatum). Ever since
I made the acquaintance of a charming specimen at the Zoological
Gardens I have hoped to receive an offer of one from a dealer, but it
was not until last summer that my hopes were realized in a letter from
Gamage&amp;apos;s,only to be dashed a day or two later by another letter in which
they said that they found that the birds were really Pigmy Owls. Being at
that time under the impression that the Pigmy Owl was a very different
bird from the Pearl-spotted, I wrote back that I did not want them and
one was sold not long afterwards. Happening to call at Carnage&amp;apos;s on

The Maty urns of Tavistock -- My Pigmy Owl 5 1
my next visit to London, I saw the other little fellow, and at once
realized that he was sufficiently like my favourite to be worth buying,
although he looked dirty and woebegone. A few days later he arrived,
very sorry for himself and with one eye closed -- a common habit with
owls when feeling out of sorts which leads the inexperienced to suspect
an injury. After a night&amp;apos;s rest and a good meal of sparrow, &amp;quot; Owlikins &amp;quot;
seemed much more lively -- he was an adult bird and untamed, except
in so far as his travels had accustomed him to the sight of human beings.
On examining him carefully, however, I was very disappointed to find
that his beak had been severely injured, apparently by thebite of another
bird ; the upper mandible was nearly bitten through at the base and
much twisted, and a large piece of one nostril was entirely gone. Next
day the twisted mandible had been broken clean off, and 1 was afraid
I should have to destroy the poor little chap as it seemed hardly possible
he could feed. However, a little coaxing revealed the fact that he could
swallow pieces of food put into his mouth, and later I found out that
with the aid of his claws he could feed himself on chopped-up food,
though he was quite unable to tear skin or bones. The most annoying
result of his mutilation is his inability to keep his feathers clean,
necessitating assistance from me which is much resented. So far I
have been unable to induce him to take any kind of bath. Little Owls
very seldom bathe, but they love an occasional sprinkling, with water
or exposure to a shower of rain ; Owlikins hates being sprinkled, and
was so miserable after a forcible wetting I once gave him that 1 was
quite afraidhewoulddie. Ihave never seen himdrink, although I should
not like to say he never does so ; Little Owls drink sparingly when
adult, but, according to my experience, not at&amp;apos;all for the first few months
of their existence. For some months I had very little time to devote
to Owlikins. and could not let him out of his cage. Before long, however,
he would jump on to my knee for food with a little coaxing, and allow
me to stroke his head. He is as diurnal in his habits as a Little Owl,
and like all &amp;apos;&amp;apos;haggards&amp;quot; of that species I have tamed, exceedingly
gentle, never showing the smallest sign of temper as hand-reared birds
will sometimes do. As compared with a Little Owl he appears to possess
a very limited vocabulary. So far I have only heard him utter a clear
musical whistle, usually about dawn, and a finch-like cheep, which

appears to correspond to the low, harsh noise a Little Owl makes
when hungry or desiring to attract the attention of his friends.
Since being away on a holiday I have had more time to devote to
Owlikins, and he is getting steadily tamer. He likes me best, but is
less desperately shy of strangers than the Little Owls I have kept. He
shows remarkably little fear of my small son, aged 3, in spite of
his noisy ways, apparently considering that he is both young and
harmless ! Owlikins is let out in the room every evening ; he is not
very active, spending most of his time on two different chairs, and not
exploring every corner, after the inquisitive habit of a Little Owl.
He is, however, much less troublesome to recapture than other half-
tame owls I have had, and does not dash into inaccessible corners,
a little coaxing and gentle driving being all that is required to induce
him to return to his cage. If approached when out in the room by
someone he is rather afraid of he seldoms flies away, but tightens up
all his feathers and remains motionless until the danger is past. He is
also not at all ready to fly off when I go near him while he has food in
his claws ; if he were a trained hawk he would be commendably free
from the vice of carrying.
Mealworms are his favourite food,andhe requiresagood many to keep
him in health. He catches them in his claws with great quickness, but
the subsequent transfer to his mouth is a matter of difficulty. He
prefers mice to small birds, and will eat small earthworms readily,
but does not care about big ones.
The other night for the first time I saw him attempt to play, Little Owl
fashion, by pouncing on the chair cover and worrying it, but his missing
upper mandible will, I fear, prevent him from getting much fun in
this way. He appears to be moulting at present, for although I have
seen few dropped feathers in his cage, he has a lot of quills showing.
I rather fear that Owlikins may not live to a great age, but I hope to
keep him in health and happiness for a time, at any rate, in spite of
his infirmity. Had it not been for his unlucky accident I feel sure he
would have turned out an ideal pet, and even as he is he is a dear little
chap, sitting by me as I write, a tiny ball of fluffy feathers surmounted
by a bright, serious, little round face.

Having lately spent a week-end in Herefordshire as the guest of
Mr. H. D. Astley, some account of his wonderful collection of birds,
which he keeps at his beautiful home at Brinsop Court, will, I am
sure, interest those readers of the Avicultural Magazine who have not
been lucky enough to have had the opportunity of seeing the treasures
he has there.
To begin with, the beautiful old house, part of it twelfth century,
is filled with treasures not only ornithological, but also with its
associations with Wordsworth, and its lovely old galleries and halls
make it a place of great delight apart from the birds. The moat
which surrounds the house and the gardens of great picturesqueness
and fascination add to its beauty, which is further emphasized by the
Stanley Cranes, which are full winged, or by the Flamingoes, which
always appear to group themselves in positions in which their beauty
shows off to perfection, either reflected in the moat or standing in some
corner amongst surroundings which add enormously to their own
beauty. The Stanley Cranes generally take an early morning fly round
the place, and to see them come sailing over the roof of the house
and then settling is a wonderful sight ; they are perfectly tame, and
although all Mr. Astley&amp;apos;s birds were in beautiful order I do not think
I have ever seen two birds in such faultless condition and bloom as
these two Stanleys were.
Amongst so many birds it is difficult to know which to specially
mention, when all deserve a word. On going down to breakfast the
first morning I was greeted by a Missel Thrush which has the run of
the dining-hall and flew screeching at me as I entered the room,
pecking me quite severely on the forehead, knowing perfectly well
I was a stranger. Recovering from this somewhat boisterous greeting
I at once went to look at some of the avian treasures in cages in the room.
Here, in a large wooden cage, Mr. Astley keeps his unique Woodpecker,
the Golden Xaped Woodpecker from the Himalayas ; it is frightfully
rare, and those df us who Lave kept woodpeckers know what difficult

birds they are to deal with satisfactorily, but this bird, which I think
Mr. Astley has had for considerably over a year, looked the picture of
health ; it was about the size of a Green Woodpecker, perhaps rather
smaller, and beautifully marked with yellow ; quite tame, and if one
put one&amp;apos;s hand near the bars of the cage, its long pink tongue would
dart out and vibrate up and down one&amp;apos;s finger with great rapidity,
being specially attracted by the glitter of my gold signet ring. In
this room also are a pair of Purple Sugar Birds, a Shama, and a lovely
Chestnut-breasted Blue Niltava. Down a passage is the bird-room,
a good-sized room, the walls lined with white china tiles ; here, flying
loose, are the pair of Cat Birds, most interesting and fairly tame ; they
are rather heavy-looking birds, but very attractive and of course
extremely rare. I was pleased to see two Black-winged White Grackles ;
I kept this very handsome Starling before the War, and found them
most charming birds, with their black and white plumage and bright
yellow legs and bill. Three Queen Alexandra Parrakeets, a Black-
capped Lory, some Blue Budgerigars, and last, but by no means least,
a most beautiful Mot-mot, made up the inhabitants of the bird-room.
The Mot-mot, with its curious racket tail, was not loose, but in a cage ;
he was quite tame and the picture of health. In Mr. Astley &amp;apos;s study
were four Nightingales, three of them anyhow singing beautifully ;
here also was a rare Robin Chat (Cossypha caffra), a North American
Wood Thrush, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, and a White-winged Mocking
Bird. Other birds noticed in various parts of the house were Liothrix,
two rare Mocking Birds (Mimus gilvus), Hooded Siskins, Mexican Red
Cardinal, Yucatan Blue Pie, and various others which I have forgotten.
The evening I arrived at Brinsop there was great excitement, for
the pair of Holds, or Eared Pheasants, which are quite full-winged
and have the run of the garden, had gone off and after much difficulty
had been located in a large wood on the side of a hill some mile away
from the house ; however, later in the evening Mr. Astley&amp;apos;s bird-man
reported that they had been found, and had either been driven or came
back, and he told me the following morning that they had flown down
the hill -side at the most terrific pace, far faster than partridges. They
appeared to be none the worse for their adventure, and were most
attractive looking birds, I thought, with their ear tufts and odd tails,

and on the Sunday evening I saw them roosting on their accustomed
bough at the top of a tall Scotch fir in the garden.
In the Paddocks besides the Stanley Cranes were four Manchurian
Cranes, as well as White-necked and Australian. The large pond
beyond the moat held a varied collection of Ducks ; most of the
commoner species were represented and I also noticed Scaup, Red-
crested Pochard, Chiloe Wigeon, Falcated Duck, Golden-eye, White-
eyed Pochard, and the extremely rare and beautiful little Cotton Teal,
of which there were three or four (I forget) lovely examples swimming
about, rather apart from the commoner herd, as though they knew
their superiority. The geese included Canadian, Bernicle, Ross&amp;apos; Snow
Goose, Bar-headed, Ruddy-headed, Magellanic, and Grey Lag.
The large series of beautifully arranged and thought-out aviaries
contained a wonderful collection of various birds. I have jotted down
the names of a good many, but the following is a very incomplete list ;
the birds I can remember included Barraband Parrakeets, Red Rumps,
Siamese Fire Backs, a pair of Satyr Tragopans, White-crested Jay
Thrush, every shade of Blue, Green, and Yellow Budgerigars, Black-
headed Caiques, King Parrot, Stanley and Queen Alexandra&amp;apos;s
Parrakeets, Cockatiels, Purple-winged Glossy Starlings, Chestnut-
winged Grackles, Tree Pipit, Wheatear, American Robin, Orange-
headed Ground Thrush, African Thrush (Turdus hilimensis), Blue
Birds, Indigo Buntings, Sulphury Seedeaters, Yellow singing Finch,
Violet-eared Waxbill, Taha Weavers ; and of doves in the same aviaries
I noted Diamond, Indian Palm, Bar-shouldered, Crested, and Turtle
Doves, and some Bleeding-heart Pigeons. While sitting on a seat outside
the aviary with Mrs. Astley a perfectly delightful pair came walking up.
one on each side, a Guan and a Trumpeter ; the former hopped on to

but that was already occupied by a Pekinese Spaniel, so he had to be

after breaking the tenth commandment many times, I reluctantly
tore myself away from these fascinating aviaries to return to the house,
passing on the way another aviary in which I noticed Golden Pheasants,
a Siamese Fire Back, and three fine Monauls. Too quickly Monday
morning came, and I had to leave hospitable Brinsop and its many
delights, and as I drove through the fore-court and over the moat,
I turned back to see the last of the lovely old house and the pink of the
Flamingoes as they stood motionless in the water, and thought of the
Queen of Sheba after her visit to King Solomon, who returned to her
own home with no heart left in her.

By Frederick D. Welch
A relative of mine used to keep a Blue-fronted Amazon, which
I frequently saw between 1890 and 1910, which shows that this species
will live at least twenty years and probably very much longer,
a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo having lived ninety odd years, so I was
informed in 1901 by a patient in Maidstone about one at his house.
This Amazon used to perform some amusing antics, of which readers
of the Avicultural Magazine may like to hear.
The shutters in the dining-room used to be closed by a handle,
which being turned slid them out, so to speak, from an excavation
within the wall, and were made with a mirror on their inner sides,
which reflected things in the room. The Amazon used to be let out
of its cage most evenings for exercise, its favourite method of
locomotion being to walk backwards along the floor, and when it saw
the reflection of itself in the mirror-windows it used during the end
of December and first half of January to advance with an excited
chuckle and begin moving much like the action of a dove in courting.
This chuckling was made in quite a soft voice, and was never made,
to my knowledge, except during those months. It seemed to me to
be undoubtedly a display of breeding affection. There was nothing
known for certainty about the bird&amp;apos;s history previous to its arrival at

F. D. Welch -- An Amusing Amazon, and also a Parrakeet til
my relatives, which I understood to have been many years before it
was first seen by mc ; but it seemed to me as the most likely explanation
that it had been captured when quite a nestling, and therefore never
remembered distinctly seeing others of its own species, in which case
it seemed to me the sexual affection would be more shown than with
Amazons which see each other frequently.
Be this as it may, it was an interesting scene to watch, and usually
continued for about a minute, at the end of which time it apparently
dawned on the Amazon&amp;apos;s brain that the supposed companion was not
inclined for flirtation, as it usually left the window suddenly and resumed
its walks in no very amiable mind towards human beings for a while !
The only other of the tribe which it saw during its life there was a Ring-
necked Parrakeet (PalcBornis torquata), with which it was not on friendly
terms, so the two were never let out of their cages at the same time. The
Parrakeet was, by the way, a remarkably distinct talker and mimic,
calling &amp;apos;&amp;quot;&amp;apos;Puss, puss, puss&amp;quot; so as to deceive the kitchen cat, which
thought (as I saw myself) it was the cook calling for it to give it food ;
and it also frequently deceived a maid called &amp;quot; Sarah &amp;quot; by calling her
when she had left the room where it used to live.
The Amazon, on the other hand, used only to call in a monotonous
bass voice at&amp;quot; sunset regularly, and occasionally in early morning as
well. When out of its cage it used to frequently enter beneath the
grate, where a fire was burning at the time, and pull out bits of cinder
and eat them, which I suppose acted in a similar way to the small
stones eaten by domestic fowls and others of that order.
It would not, however, take any notice of cinders taken out for it
by myself or others in the house, but ignored such with contempt !
It was a wonder that the bird never got its plumage damaged by hot
cinders falling from the fire above it, and it dodged in an out from the
grate in a most skilful way.
I may add, in conclusion, that the Amazon and Parrakeet above
mentioned were regularly watered from overhead with a watering-can
and fine-rosed nozzle in hot weather with ordinary tap-water, and left
in sunshine out of doors to dry, care being taken, of course, to avoid
draught.

THE SCARLET-BREASTED SUNBIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974032" page_id="9396832"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
(Cinnyris gutturalis)
A specimen of this fine Sunbird has been presented to the Zoological
Society by its corresponding member, Mr. Harold Miller, the Director
of the Durban Zoological Gardens, and is the first example the Society
has received. It is a splendid species, with the head and body velvety
black shaded with brown, the forehead and cheeks glossed with metallic
green, the throat and chest scarlet, the feathers with a subterminal
bar of metallic blue showing as minute spots. The species occurs in
East, South-East, and South- West Africa.
Capt. Shelley, in his Birds of Africa, gives a long account of the
habits of this species from the pen of the late Capt. Boyd Alexander,
who tells us that &amp;quot; When not breeding, the males generally travel from
one spot to another without the company of the females. During the
heat of the day, when all other birds have hidden themselves in the
depths of the wood, they are abroad, seeming to take a delight in the
intense heat, always most active, while it is only in the early morning
and evening that they take a rest from their labours and retire into the
thick under-cover. As the pairing season approaches, the male never
leaves the side of his mate, and when courting her has a quaint way of
swaying his body from side to side as if it was on a pivot right in front
of his gaze. Moreover, he is constantly singing to her, uttering his
song from the topmost twig of some tall acacia tree, while the notes
both in tone and rendering are by no means unpleasant, and closely
resemble those of the Lesser Eedpoll &amp;quot;.
A nest found by Boyd Alexander was oval-shaped and attached to
three slender branches of an acacia tree, and about 20 feet up. It
was flimsy and untidy, made of fine grass interwoven with fragments of
skeleton leaves, cobwebs, and cocoons, and lined with fluffy down.
Near the nest was a nest of bees, which the birds made use of to guide
them to some rich flower store in the vicinity.
An examination of a series of these birds convinced Boyd Alexander
that the full plumage of the adult is not assumed until the second year.

About 18,000 Parrots and Finches of species frequenting the northern
parts of Australia were recently taken into Brisbane Harbour on board
a steamer bound for Sydney. Much concern was manifested by the
owners of the birds, when shortly after the steamer berthed, honorary
officers of the Queensland Agricultural Department and the bird
protection societies attended with a police sergeant, and the latter
announced his intention of releasing the birds, trade in which is
forbidden under the Queensland law. Permits from Northern Territory
officials were produced by the bird-catchers, whereupon the matter
threatened to develop into a clash between Federal and State
authorities. However, the police arrived at the conclusion that their
powers did not extend to the birds on the boat, and they did no more
than place a guard to ensure that none of the Finches disembarked
locally. Such of the birds as were intended for Brisbane were not
landed. The whole avine cargo went on to Sydney, where the birds
sold readily at prices ranging from 20s. to 50s. a dozen.

worst for many years. One of the most interesting aviaries in the
Zoological Gardens is the Summer Aviary, so called because it is the
summer home of many of the birds which winter in the Bird House and
Western Aviary. With the first fine days of April many of the hardier
birds are transferred to this enclosure and seem at once to realize that
they have arrived at their summer quarters, and that it is time to turn
their thoughts to nest-building.
The Summer Aviary. -- The Zoological Society is fortunate in
possessing two good pairs of American Blue-birds, a species that was
well known to aviculturists in the old days before the export of American
birds was prohibited. These have been placed in the Summer Aviary,
one pair in each of the two compartments, and it was a pleasure to
watch them when first liberated. The cocks commenced to sing and
spread their wings and tails, and to inspect every box for a suitable
site for a nest. Virginian Cardinals, Song Sparrows, and several others
were busy building their nests in less than a week after being put into
the aviary.
King Vultures. -- An interesting addition to the collection at the
Zoo consists of a couple of King Vultures, a species that has been
unrepresented for some few years past. This is the only species of
Vulture that is really brightly coloured when adult, the sexes being
alike, of a rosy cream colour, with a grey neck-ruff, black wings and
tail, and the head ornamented with bright orange and red. One of the
two new arrivals is immature, and is of a uniform blackish-brown colour,
a stage that I, at least, had never before seen. It will be interesting to
watch the gradual change to the adult coloration.
Japanese Teal. -- Japanese Teal have been arriving in some numbers
and the dealers are offering them at a very reasonable price. These
are some of the most beautiful of the ornamental waterfowl, but they
are very wild when first imported and unless carefully enclosed with
wire-netting will stray away to a certainty. They have been bred
successfully on several occasions in this country, but they must have
plenty of space. At the Zoo, in the breeding season, pairs will wander
up and down by the wire fencing in their endeavours to go further

a Held in search of a nesting site. Only once have eggs been laid, in
a nest close to the fence, and as far from the pond as the birds could go.
A Curious Grey Parrot. -- I hear that Mr. Delacour has obtained
a very curious and rare variety of the Grey Parrot, in which the whole
of the plumage is pink, with the exception of a few feathers in the body
and the quills, which are of the normal grey colour.
Colour Varieties of the Budgerigar. -- Colour varieties in
birds are always interesting, and occasionally they are more beautiful
than the normal state. In the Budgerigar, for instance, the blue variety
is extremely beautiful, and it is very satisfactory to know that this race
has not died out as was at one time feared that it might on account of
the War. Two or three of our members have stocks which they are
doing their best to increase. There are now three distinct varieties,
the well-known yellow, the blue, and the olive. Mr. Astley bred a white
bird, which most unfortunately died. He kindly sent me the dead
bird, which I was very glad to add to my collection of skin specimens.
Comparing a series from the normal green bird to the white one
finds that the colour in the former is composed of yellow and blue, the
former a pigment, the latter being produced by feather-structure,
combined with black pigment. In the yellow variety the black pigment
has disappeared ; in the blue variety the yellow pigment is absent.
Mr. Astley&amp;apos;s bird is not a true albino, as it had dark eyes. It is a very
washed-out blue, still showing faint traces of blue on the rump. The
yellow pigment has entirely gone, as in the typical blue, and the black
pigment is only present to a very small extent.
A Splendid Peregrine. -- The Zoological Society has received as
a present from Major W. H. Rawnsley an extremely fine female
Peregrine Falcon in most faultless condition. The letter accom-
panying the bird states that &amp;quot; she was caught on a trawler off Iceland
in a fog in October, 1920, and fed on fish from the time she was caught
till purchased in Aberdeen a week or so after landing. She is very tame
in the sense of not being frightened at people, but she is too vicious to
train. She eats off her jesses at once, and fights like mad when we try
to hood her. She will fiv to the hand for food.&amp;quot;

A New Waders&amp;apos; Aviary. -- The Waders&amp;apos; Aviary at the Zoological
Gardens came in the way of certain alterations that were necessary,
and it was decided that it should be taken down and re-erected on
another site between the Lion House and the Cattle-sheds. This work
has now been completed, and in many ways the new aviary is better
than the old. The aspect is better, the inmates getting the benefit
of more sun than formerly. In the old position the birds had to be
viewed against the light, the front of the aviary facing north, whereas
now the north end is planted up with ornamental shrubs and an
excellent view is obtained from the other three sides.

Sirs, -- As a general rule, when one has valuable birds which one
is most anxious to keep for many years they frequently die promptly ;
but when one has birds of little intrinsic value they continue in
boisterous health for an unconscionable time and therefore cost one at
least a hundred times their value in food.
As I mentioned some time ago I still have three finches remaining
from my former living collection of birds -- a hen Napoleon Weaver
bought in 1900, a cock Chingolo Song-sparrow bred by Mr. Tesche-
maker in 1907, and a cock hybrid between Cherry-finch and Masked
Grass-finch bred by Mr. Sich in 1908.
All these birds are in perfect health and condition, and have never
had a day&amp;apos;s illness, their chief interest consists in their longevity.
I always regarded the Weavers as hardy and long-lived birds, but
twenty-one years in captivity and still going strong seems remarkable
for so small a bird as a Napoleon Weaver.

A VISIT TO THE BIRDS AT THE
WELLINGTON ZOO
By C. TUrnbv Smith.
I had an opportunity of visiting the Zoo at Wellington, New
Zealand, last February, and considering the institution has only been

<bodyText confidence="0.99927515" page_id="9396839"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
in existence about twelve years, the collection of birds is most
satisfactory and interesting. The Zoo comprises some 17 J acres of
undulating ground on the edge of the hills in the outskirts of the
city, and is fairly well screened from wind -- a great point at
Wellington. The large pond for waterfowl would carry any number
of birds, and the Paradise Ducks, Japanese Teal, Maned Geese, etc.,
which I noticed looked very nourishing. More waterfowl, however,
are greatly wanted. By far the most interesting thing I saw was the
place where a pair of Mantell&amp;apos;s Kiwis nested three years ago. These
birds were confined in a large wire enclosure on the hillside, the place
being fairly dense with trees and low bushes and having a little
watercourse running down the centre. The birds, unfortunately,
elected to make the nest in the bank of the stream at the lower end
of the enclosure. They burrowed a hole like a rabbit&amp;apos;s hole,
extending some 18 inches into the bank at right angles to the stream,
and then the hole had an elbow-turn, and was carried on for another
2 feet. At the end the birds excavated a circular hole of considerable
size, which they carefully lined with leaves from lime-trees in the
enclosure. It seems that the female bird did most of the nest-making.
The hopes of Mr. Langridge, the Zoo Superintendent, were great for a

time, but unfortunately before any eggs were laid a heavy rain-storm
raised the water-level of the stream to such a height that it was
found necessary to dig into the nest from above to avoid the risk
of one or both the old birds being drowned. Both birds were in the
nest when it was dug out. Since then no further attempt at nesting
have been recorded, but as there are still Kiwis at the Zoo the future
is not without hope. Considering Kiwis are practically doomed to
extinction, further records as to their nesting operations are most
desirable.
Amongst other birds that have recently nested at the Zoo, with
more or less success, are Paradise Duck, American Wood Duck,
Weka Rails, Red-billed Gulls, Black-backed or Dominican Gulls,
Straw-necked Ibises, Magpie Larks, Yellow-tufted Honey-eaters,
and, of course, various small families.
I saw a very fine pair of Ostriches and a Cassowary which would
he a credit to any collection. I also noticed two White-fronted
Herons in splendid health, after two years in captivity. These birds
are incessantly picking up flies and other insects, and Mr. Langridge
attributes their good health greatly to this. In various aviaries he
hangs up meat to induce flies. A fine King Penguin and three
Sclater&amp;apos;s Crested Penguins showed the usual inquisitiveness and
anxiety to be fed. A curious pied specimen of the Pectoral Rail
looked quite happy. If this could be got to breed there might
possibly be interesting results. Amongst Owls were the Australian
Barn Owl, a very fine specimen, the &amp;quot; Delicate Owl &amp;quot;, the &amp;quot; Spotted
Eagle Owl &amp;quot;, and, of course, the common New Zealand &amp;quot; Morepork &amp;quot;,
which greatly resembles our Athene noctua.
The Parrots included Keas, Kakas, Cockatoos, Pennants, Rosellas,
Macaws, various small Parrakeets, and a splendid specimen of a
Tabuan Parrot from the Fiji Isles. I was disappointed not to see
either Kakapos or New Zealand Parrakeets. Both, however, are most
difficult to obtain, though further efforts to get them are being made.
Pheasants did not show any specially rare varieties, but included
a good cock Elliot&amp;apos;s Pheasant, sent in mistake for a Jungle Fowl.
I noticed amongst the Lesser Waders a fine specimen of the Golden
Plover, which was just losing his full breeding plumage. This bird

{lew into the porthole of a ship 50 miles off the coast. At present
the Zoo does not hold any specimens of those interesting New
Zealand birds, the Stilts (either pied or black), but it is hoped to get
these in future as they are fairly common in many places. The
prospects of getting &amp;quot; Tuis &amp;quot; or Parson Birds are much more doubtful,
and the possibility of getting &amp;quot; Huias &amp;quot; almost nil.
A small flock of Apostle Birds (Struthidea cinerea) from Australia
seemed quite happy in an enclosure with other birds. They have
been in the Zoo some six years, and though popularly supposed to
be most pugnacious, yet in captivity have shown quite a peaceable
dis posit ion. Their common name of Apostle Bird is gained from their
being usually found in flocks of twelve. Tt is interesting to note that
wild Fantails (that quaint lively little bird with at least nineteen
n;i me*). have repeatedly nested and reared young in the Zoo grounds.
The Zoo authorities are most anxious to enlarge their collection
of birds, and the New Zealand climate is such as to render easy the
keeping of many varieties, which in other places are only half-hardy.
There are, however, obvious difficulties in the way of speedy progress,
such as geographical situation, shortage of labour and lack of trans-
port facilities incidental to a newly developing community.
Members of the Avicultural Society and other enthusiasts having
surplus stock for disposal might do worse than arrange to send them
to the Wellington Zoo. The Superintendent would readily answer
all inquiries as to method of transit and otherwise ; also arrange
special terms with the shipping companies. Many New Zealanders
would like to see birds sent from the British Isles, to which they,
almost all of them, refer as &amp;quot; Home &amp;quot;.

get his Ural Owls, viz. East Prussia. She, for it was a female, lived with
us for three years in perfect health, and then escaped, and as she had
evidently been captured when adult, there is no doubt but that she found
little difficulty in getting her own living. , In many ways this little owl
differed entirely from all the numerous species of owls which I have kept.
The peculiar whistle and chirp (to my ear musical) is most un-owl-like,
and is characteristic of the genus Glaucidium, as is also the peculiar
manner in which the tail is elevated -- you cannot say cocked up --
and swung from side to side -- you cannot say wagged -- when the bird
is in motion. I have not bred this owl, so cannot say how the adult
plumage is assumed, viz. if immediately after the first white down, or
if there is an intermediate down between the nestling white down and
the true feathers, or no, but I should be inclined to think that the
plumage is assumed as in the Scops Owl, without any intermediate
down. Perhaps Miss Chawner, who has successfully bred a kindred
species of the same genus can enlighten us. I find by my notes that
I considered this owl to be an insect and bird eater, in this case differing
from Lord Tavistock. Also she was a very large eater. I should think
in the northern forests and semi-Alpine forests in which it finds its
home that titmice very likely form a considerable part of its food.
Our bird was extremely fond of sunning itself and in taking a dust-
bath ; she also bathed and drank, but was not nearly so fond of a bath
as the generality of owls, which, with the exception of the Barn Owls
and Little Owls (Athene), are great washers. It was interesting to note
that when the tail was elevated the &amp;quot; hinge &amp;quot; seemed to be nearly in
the middle of its back, showing how much was &amp;quot; feather &amp;quot; and how
little owl !

The way in which the numbers of Long-tailed Tits have increased
in the last two years must be a matter for congratulation to every
naturalist, gardener, and fruit-grower. The winter of 1916-17 very
nearly exterminated them here in Norfolk, and their numbers remained
very small until last spring, when there was a perceptible increase of

birds, though I did not see a nest in 1920. I saw one or two family
parties which had not left the nest for more than a week or two. But
this spring just round here I know four nests, and several other pairs
of birds whose nests I have not found, so that in this locality, at any
rate, their numbers are up to the 1915 standard. I have always wanted
to know how long a time is occupied in building one of their wonderful
nests, and this year I was able to find out how long it took one pair
to build (I daresay the time taken by individual pairs varies). On
Saturday, 12th March, I happened to see a Long- tailed Tit fly into a low
rhododendron, it only remained there a second or two, but since where
birds are concerned I am of an inquisitive disposition, I was obliged
to go and look into the shrub, where, to my delight, I found a minute
piece of moss and lichen, obviously the first foundation of a nest.
Fortunately the site is only 2 ft. 6 in. or so from the ground on the
outside of an outside shrub of a large clump of rhododendrons, and
consequently easily watched. I noticed that when collecting material
the birds were frequently separated by some distance, but when feeding
only, and not actually building or collecting, were always together ;
also that they always fed on the same trees, i.e. two small clumps of
young larch. The nest progressed very slowly at first, three or four
days seeming to make no difference to it in size, although the birds
worked extraordinarily hard. What struck me as remarkable was that
I never saw either of the birds remain at the nest for more than two or
three seconds, and yet in that time they managed to get the material
woven in very tightly and neatly ; how they do it with their absurd
little beaks is amazing ! It was not till the nest had attained the size
of a Chaffinch&amp;apos;s that it began to grow at all quickly ; at this point a
lot of very fine grass leaves were used in the inside, the outside being
composed of moss, lichen, and cobwebs. This was the fourteenth day,
and from now onwards the nest grew much more rapidly, until by
the eighteenth day from the outside the nest appeared finished. The
birds now began to bring feathers only, and must have brought
hundreds ! On the twenty-third day the nest was completed. The first
egg was laid on the twenty-fifth day. and from then onwards I never
saw the birds at all ; they forsook my garden entirely, and I feared that
they had forsaken the nest, so on the evening, when there should have

been four eggs, I thought I&amp;apos;d put a finger in to see if everything was
all right. I chose the evening as I didn&amp;apos;t expect the bird to be on the
nest at 5 p.m. However, as luck would have it, she was on, but
fortunately took no notice of being poked by my finger. I hurriedly
retreated a few yards to see if she would come off, but as she didn&amp;apos;t
appear for ten minutes I concluded that she wasn&amp;apos;t worried, and left
her. I didn&amp;apos;t like to feel any more, for fear of making her forsake,
so I don&amp;apos;t know how many eggs she laid, nor the exact day on which
she began to incubate. I didn&amp;apos;t see either bird for about a fortnight,
until one evening when they both flew across the lawn into a birch-
tree near the house, obviously my pair as the lien&amp;apos;s tail was very bent
from being twisted round in the nest. After this I saw them together
fairly frequently ; they were now using the garden again, but didn&amp;apos;t
seem to have any fixed time for coming off the eggs to feed. On
29 jh April I again felt in the nest, and found several very small birds
and could feel one or two eggs, but whether these were &amp;quot; clear &amp;quot; eggs or
have since hatched I don&amp;apos;t know. The bird broods them a great deal,
but comes off if one walks by the nest ; when she was incubating
she never stirred, even when one looked quite close at the nest. Some-
times one could see her face looking out half smothered in feathers,
but she always retreated and huddled down into the nest instead of
coming out of it. I expect the young birds to remain in the nest until
about the 16th of this month (May). When building the birds took no
notice of me at all. I used to sit on a bank about three yards from the
nest and watch them ; as long as one kept still they didn&amp;apos;t worry.

In the course of 1920 I was lucky enough to procure six different
.species of Barbets. I am particularly fond of this family of gorgeous
birds, whose peculiar shape and bright colours are often associated
with great tameness. Three of my Barbets come from Asia and three
from Africa. One knows that, besides these two continents, South
America also possesses Barbets. All are rather omnivorous, but Asiatic

birds are more fruit-eaters, African, and especially American, species
being more insectivorous.
My Asiatic Barbets are the Giant, the Hoary Jungle, and the
Common Bluethroated. Of the last bird, well known to all aviculturists,
I won&amp;apos;t speak. The Hoary Jungle Barbet (Thereiceryx zeylonicus) is
an inhabitant of India and Ceylon ; his size is that of a Starling ; his
body is of a lovely pale green, head and neck grey streaked with white,
bill dark yellow, eyes with white &amp;quot; spectacles &amp;quot;. It is a bold and
unsociable bird that I keep alone in an aviary of the bird gallery, as
well as the Giant Barbet. The latter (Megalcema virens) is the biggest
bird of the family, and a very handsome one. Its size is that of a Jay ;
head and neck very dark bluish-green ; chest, dark brown ; tail and
wings, green ; shoulders, chestnut ; underparts, green streaked with
pale yellow ; vent, rich pink. This bird inhabits China. Of the African
species, one is the well-known Levaillant&amp;apos;s Barbet (Trachyphonus
cafer), a beautiful bird with rather a long tail, a crest, and a fine plumage,
variegated with yellow, red, black, and white. The Black-collared
Barbet (Lybius torquatus) is also very handsome and rare. A few have
been imported lately, but when my bird arrived it was only the second
one ever imported into Europe, the first one having been brought into
Berlin in 1912. Its size is that of the Common Barbet ; head
and neck, scarlet ; wide, black collar ; back, olive green ; wings and
tail, black ; underparts, yellow. My last species is a little Pied Barbet
{Tricholoema leucomelan) of the size of a Sparrow, black and white,
with a scarlet and yellow patch on the head. All these African birds
are quite sociable and harmless, and live in the Bird Gallery with
Tanagers, Bulbuls, etc. I give all these Barbets insectile mixture ;
a little meat, fruit, such as apple, orange, bananas, elder-berries, etc.,
mashed potatoes and carrots and dried figs and raisins. I find them
very robust and most satisfactory aviary birds.
Two rather rare birds that I have kept and have proved a failure
are the Grey Touracou {Sckizorhis concolor) and the Long-tailed Pied
Shrike (Urolcstes melanoleuca). Of the former species I received a
dozen specimens a year ago, with the result that, despite all cares, only
one is still living in my aviaries. I and Mme. Lecallier tried all sorts of
food and accommodations, and always, without any apparent reasons,

some of the birds became mute and died after a month&amp;apos;s disease. The
bird I still have lives out of doors in the large aviary, where I keep my
Magpies, Jays, Toucans, Hornbills, etc., and is in perfect condition. I
shall add that these Grey Touracous are rather clumsy in their ways, and
not nearly so attractive as the green species.
Out of the four Long-tailed Pied Shrikes that I received, two died
quickly. The other two lived about a year, and I must confess that
I was pleased to see them go ! They should be quite nice in good
plumage, but they are so wild and restless, that they always damage
their feathers, even in a large aviary. I have not seen mine with their
long whydah-like tail more than a couple of months. And one never
knows how to keep them ; they seem very unhappy in a cage ; I tried
to put them in the Magpies&amp;apos; aviary, but they were bullied by them.
I put them with smaller birds, of their own size ; the Shrike killed
several of them. One should give them a large aviary to themselves,
and they are not worth it. They are not difficult on the food question,
being quite satisfied with Duquesne insectivorous food and meat.
About two years ago I received a consignment of five Cuban Trogons,
in miserable condition, in fact they were nothing but lumps of dirty
broken feathers. Three died shortly, but two recovered, moulted out,
and became the most charming birds one could wish to possess.
Unfortunately, one died of stoppage of the intestines from having
swallowed the hard skin of some coarse grape. With Trogons and
Birds of Paradise it is essential not to give them any chance of eating
hard food, as they invariably die when they eat it. My last Trogon
is in the best of health, and now moulting for the second time with me.
It is a very tame and sensible bird, with the most gorgeous green, pearl-
grey, white, black, and crimson dress.
My largest outdoor aviary, which connects with a heated room,
contains a fair number of Magpies, such as Acalie (Cyanocora.v
chrysops), Blue (C. cceruleus), San Blasian, Beechey&amp;apos;s {Cissolopha
sanblasiana and C. beecheyi), Himalayan Blue (Urocissa occipitalis),
Wandering Tree Pies (Dendrocitta rufa), African Black (Cryptorhina
afra) ; an Australian Piping Crow ; some Toucans and Hornbills, long-
tailed Glossy Starlings and Mexican Rails (Aramides albiventris) ; all
these birds agree very well together, and make a very good show.
There is never any fighting between them.

By E. Maud Knobel.
I have often been very much amused by other peoples&amp;apos; ideas and
opinions of birds, both as pets and in general. I remember some years
ago being introduced to a lady at an &amp;quot; at home &amp;quot;, and after a while
she asked what I was interested in. I replied that I went in for birds.
&amp;quot; Oh, yes,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot; canaries.&amp;quot; &amp;quot; No,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot; not Canaries,
foreign birds.&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Ah ! &amp;quot; she exclaimed, &amp;apos;* Budgerigars.&amp;quot; As I was
keeping a Shama, a superb Tanager, and a Bauer&amp;apos;s Parrakeet, amongst
other things, at the time, and feeling not a little proud of them, I tried
to explain what they were, but her imagination had evidently never
penetrated beyond canaries and budgerigars, and she dismissed me as
a mild kind of lunatic.
Once down at the London Hospital, where for many years I was
a ward visitor, I remember one day talking to a patient, and had tried
many subjects, but had got no answers beyond yes and no. Then
I suddenly began talking about my Parrots. At this her whole face
lighted up, and she exclaimed, proudly, &amp;quot;Ah, I keep a Parrot.&amp;quot; Oh,
I thought to myself, at last I have found something in common. So
delightedly I asked her what kind it was, a grey or a green. &amp;quot; Green,&amp;quot;
she said. &amp;quot; Does it talk,&amp;quot; said I, &amp;quot; &amp;quot; Oh. no,&amp;quot; she replied, &amp;quot; it is
under a glass case ! &amp;quot;
People have often asked me why I keep so many Parrots. Surely
they must all be alike. Well, are they ? I can honestly say that I have
never had two alike. They all have so much individual character.
There are dull ones, of course, and clever ones, tame ones, and savage
ones, but they are all different. For this paper I propose to pick out
the three Blue Fronted Amazons that I have at the present moment.
The first, erroneously named &amp;quot; Richard,&amp;quot; for she is an old dame of
many years standing, was given to me in November, 1914, by friends
who had to part with her on account of the war. Personally, I far
prefer to buy my own birds apd get them first hand. By that 1 mean
young birds freshly imported who have never known another mistress
that I can teach aim bring up as I like. And vet it is not every bird

I want by a very long way ; it has to have something &amp;quot; special &amp;quot;
about it for me to want to possess it. However, at the beginning of the
war one could not look a gift horse in the mouth, so I gladly accepted
Richard. She is a pretty bird -- at least, she has a very pretty head --
with a great deal of blue, and what yellow she has is under the chin.
She is small for a hen, and not a good shape, and her feathers have
rather a faded washed-out appearance. But then she is old, which
may account for want of colour. I should say she had been badly
treated in her youth, for even now, after nearly seven years, she will
never come on my hand, and is afraid of hands. She will get up on
my shoulder, but is uncertain in her temper, and will occasionally
turn round and give a pretty hard nip. She is terribly jealous of the
other birds, and I have to be careful not to pet any while she is out of
her cage, for if I do, she will fly right across the room, straight for my
head. She is a fair talker, and has learnt quite a good deal since she
came to me. I think if I had had her in her first youth she would have
been a charming bird, but her temper is too uncertain and at times she
screams in rather a persistent way, which is trying. She is never so
happy as when she is allowed to roam about a room, and she loves to
get under a piece of curtain, but she is the most destructive bird I have
and has to be watched all the time or she will have her beak into the
best chippendale chairs or leave a hole in the curtain.
My next Blue-front is Ena, a young cock bird that I bought as
a funny little fluffy brown baby in nestling plumage in January, 1920.
The youngest Parrot I have ever had, Ena was bought in a great hurry
to replace a sad and tragic loss, for I had had the most charming Yellow-
front, called Judy, who for months had been a bosom companion and had
lived incessantly on my bed, mostly under the eiderdown, for I was
ill at the time. But one morning, when my nurse was out of the room,
Judy took a flight and landed on the window ledge, where, before any-
thing could be done, she picked up and ate a piece of broken glass.
Poor little Judy ! she simply bled to death, for it had cut the intestine
about the sixth of an inch, and apparently nothing could be done.
I missed her so dreadfully that two days after her death we phoned to
C4amage to see if they had anything that would do to fill the gap.
However, they had nothing at the moment that would suit me, so

I)e Von was visited, with the result that Ena was brought home. Now
Ena is an exceedingly independent nature -- does not care to be nursed
or petted or even have his head scratched, but is developing into a
wonderful talker and whistler. He will come on my hand, in fact I
bring him down to breakfast like that every morning, but it is only on
sufferance. He is not yet in adult plumage, which I believe they don&amp;apos;t
obtain for two or three years, but he has moulted, and certainly looks
a lot better than a year ago. He is an elegant slim bird, with much
darker green feathers than either of my hens -- a small, rather round
head, prettily marked with blue and yellow -- more yellow than Richard
and like Richard the shoulder spot and speculum are pink rather than
red in colour. Richard will sometimes play in his cage either with
a piece of wood or chain, and very occasionally will lie on his back and
play with his toes in the way parrots do, but Ena, though he is still such
a baby, never has played, and I don&amp;apos;t think ever will. He is entirely
taken up with talking, and starts with my early tea at 7 o&amp;apos;clock in the
morning, though still covered over, and goes on till he is again covered
over in the evening. He literally laughs and cries the whole day
through. He cries at times in the most heartrending way, sobbing out
at intervals, &amp;quot; Mother, I want Mother,&amp;quot; and when it becomes really
desperate he will suddenly stop and laugh as heartily as he had cried,
as if it had been the greatest joke. He makes all the noises of a baby,
and, I think, would deceive anyone. This accomplishment he learnt
elsewhere. Every morning he asks himself in the most concerned
manner, &amp;quot; Ena, how are you ? Aren&amp;apos;t you well ? &amp;quot; He imitates faithfully
cats mewing, dogs barking, the squeak of a certain tap, and other sounds
about the house, and as to whistling, I sometimes think he will drive
me grey, he is so quick at picking up. When first uncovered, and again
when it is getting time to be put to bed, he becomes very restless, and
it is the only time he shows an inclination to scream, but by taking him
mi my hand and holding him up and letting him have a good flutter, it
generally has the desired effect of stopping him.
My third Blue-front that I have just now is quite a new acquisition,
having only been here three weeks. Dinah is a very young hen, and
one of the handsomest birds 1 have ever had. She has a slight
frontal band of blue, and a great deal of yellow of a deep colour.

extending beyond the eye and well down on to the breast.
The shoulder spot and speculum are of a vivid scarlet, and the dark
blue of the flight feathers is very rich in colour. I think Dinah and
I fell in love at first sight, for she had only been a few hours in Gamage&amp;apos;s
when I saw her and made her acquaintance. She came immediately
on to my hand, and let me do as I pleased with her. I visited her many
times, but for a whole month resisted her charms, but each time I saw
her I wanted her more and more until one fine day the deed was done,
and I brought her home. The first morning I uncovered her and let
her out of her cage she seemed rather cross. She had certainly got out
of bed the wrong way. I believe, however, this was accounted for by
her being covered over. She probably was not accustomed to it, and
was too hot. That was speedily rectified, and she has never shown
any sign of being cross since, except when she thought my father was
going to take her away from me, when she tried her beak on his thumb !
Now Dinah is absolutely the opposite to Ena. She plays about the
whole day, swinging on a chain, lying on her back at the bottom of the
cage, and playing with a bit of stick, and never seems tired. Yet to me
she is one of the most gentle and loving birds I have ever had. I can
do anything with her, and the moment I come into the room she wants
to come to me to be nursed and petted. She and Ena live in the same
room, one in each window, and she is beginning to try and copy Ena in
the way of laughing, which is amusing to hear, but beyond saying
&amp;quot; Hulloa &amp;quot; and &amp;quot; Pretty Bird &amp;quot; and singing a little, I have not heard
her do much in the way of talking until a few evenings ago, when I
came in, and I must say they were both &amp;quot; going it &amp;quot;. Ena was saying
all he knew, and Dinah was chipping in in a loud voice with &amp;quot; Hurrah,
hurrah, hurrah &amp;quot;, and then talking what sounded like Portuguese. In
the Avicultural Magazine for June, 1902, in an article of Canon Dutton&amp;apos;s,
I see he says that &amp;quot; some people think that female parrots are much
gentler than male birds.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; This has certainly been my experience,
though I cannot say that my knowledge of male birds has been very
great, for out of the thirteen Amazon Parrots that I have had I believe
only two have been cock birds. But both those cock birds have been
good talkers, very independent, and they have not wanted to be petted.
I had a theory that if one only acquired a bird young enough one could

Correspondence 75
mould it as one wished, but that theory, like a good many others, has
had to go to the wall. A great deal, I may say an enormous deal, can be
done in a young bird by persistent gentleness and patience, in fact
I believe that the whole temperament of a parrot depends entirely on
the treatment by its first owner. At the same time they have so much
individual character that one cannot make them all of one pattern.

THE COLOUR OF THE SCARLET IBIS IN CAPTIVITY

Sirs, -- In the March number of the Avicullural Magazine Mr. Meade-
Waldo writes that the Scarlet Ibis : &amp;apos; loses its colour at once and
never recovers it, but remains a dull pink&amp;quot;. This is true of the bird
in close confinement, but the colour is retained for years if the bird has
access to water (not necessarily rich in natural food) and an extensive
grass range. If the enclosure is well sheltered, and contains plenty of
thick evergreens, the Ibises can be wintered out of doors, anyhow in
the Midlands, and require no other artificial food than chopped raw
meat.

RAVEN VERSUS RAT: ACTION DUE TO INSTINCT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998083466666666" page_id="9396851"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
Sirs, -- In one of the recent numbers of The Field there was (so far
as I now remember) a reply to a correspondent about food of Ravens,
such as worms, beetles, snails, mice, field voles, moles, birds ; but no
mention of rats. As the Rev. Bancks, of this village, had told me a few
weeks before about a Raven he kept in past years (&amp;quot; about 1902 &amp;quot;),
I thought its actions towards a rat might be worth mentioning.
Having caught a large rat uninjured, a friend suggested putting it
into the Raven&amp;apos;s cage, and on this being done the bird at once attacked
it, and after putting a foot on it to hold it down, killed it with a single
peck in the body in stabbing fashion.
The scene clearly proved that Ravens will attack these rodents
when wild, and are therefore of some economic value.
In addition to the above, it may be of interest to say that the bird
was taken young from the nest, and therefore it is most unlikely it had
previously seen an older bird kill rats in this way. Therefore, the

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979235086956522" page_id="9396852"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
method of stabbing the body seems to be due &amp;quot;to instinct, and not
learnt by individual experience. The Raven&amp;apos;s behaviour recalls the
cracking of snail shells, which a writer, Miss Frances Pitt, considers is
&amp;quot; probably learnt by personal experience &amp;quot; in young Thrushes (Ann. &amp;
Mag. Nat. Hist. 1919, pp. 529-31) -- an opinion with which I cannot
agree from personal observations on these birds.
In support of the view that the action in Ravens is not learnt by
personal experience after leaving the nest, the. Rev. Bancks informed
me most emphatically (he not knowing &amp;quot; the drift &amp;quot; of my question)
that his bird &amp;quot; did not attack the head &amp;quot;.
When we consider that adult Brown Rats can bite sharply in self-
defence, I should have thought a Raven, if the method was learnt by
after experience, and was not instinctive, would have first attacked the
rat in the head to put it out of action, previous to delivering the blow
at the body of the rat. What is the experience of other people who
have fed Ravens on live rats ? Do these birds vary in method of
killing such prey ?
It might also be of interest to heir what a Raven would do with
a full-grown adder -- whether attack it in the head, or whether disable
its spinal column before attempting to eat it -- if any reader has made
observations on such.

Sirs, -- Referring to Dr. Maurice Amsler&amp;apos;e letter on food for birds in
the January number, I had a Swainson&amp;apos;s Lorikeet some years ago when
I was in Egypt.
It was fed upon whole rice, very heavily sugared and boiled in water.
It also had seed, but I do not think it ate very much of it. I gave it
the sweet rice on advice given me at the Giza Zoological Gardens. The
bird occasionally had a date, slit, and the slit filled with honey. It
was very fond of this, but did not care for other fruit, oranges, etc.
The people I gave the bird to when I left the country fed it as I had

no lack of interesting subject-matter to write about -- the Editors feel

NOTES ON NEW ZEALAND BIRDS

Having recently paid a few months&amp;apos; visit to the North Island of New
Zealand, I am recording some notes as to the birds I saw or failed to see,
thinking such notes may be of possible interest to some bird-lovers.
New Zealand is, as regards bird-life, at once the most surprising and
disappointing country I ever visited. One has read of Kiwis, Bell birds,
Kakapos, and other weird forms of bird-life, but on landing one rubs
one&amp;apos;s eyes considerably and asks whether or not it is not really England.
There is the Sparrow in great abundance ; there are Thrushes, Black-
birds, Larks, Chaffinches, Starlings, Goldfinches, and a few more
English friends, but beyond these one may search for days and see
nothing -- at least, such is my experience, and (even making due
allowance for defective observation on my part) I think the fact is
beyond doubt that the New Zealand native birds are to the ordinary
individual mainly conspicuous by their absence.
New Zealanders do not appear to be much interested in birds, but
if one asks why so few of the native birds are seen, the answer is always
cither that the birds are in the back blocks or were common some
twenty or thirty years ago, and are now destroyed by stoats, bush
fires, shepherd dogs, rabbit poison, cr other attendant blessings of
civilization.
I recently travelled fifty miles by rail in an out-of-the-way part of
the country, and looked out of the window the whole journey, hoping
to see some interesting birds, but I only saw two birds (Finches) during

the whole journey of four hours. Over a similar journey in England
one would, of course, have* seen birds of many varieties in considerable
numbers.
If one takes a favourable position in the bush or manuka-scrub, or
amonsst the fern or on the edge of cultivated lands, the result is just
as disappointing. Of course, there are still birds left in out-of-the-way
places, and some of them are very interesting. OS Cape Brett, for
instance, there are large numbers of Shags, Black-backed or Dominican
Gulls, Red-billed Gulls, Blue Herons, Terns, Gannets, Mutton Birds,
and many other kinds I did not know. At other points on the coast
there are long stretches without any bird-life whatever, except, perhaps,
an occasional Black-backed Gull or Shags. The Government make
some efforts to keep Shags within reasonable bounds as regards numbers,
but such efforts do not seem to meet with much success. To anyone
who has seen the birds on long stretches of New Zealand coast and then
turned to the water simply alive with fish, it is not surprising that
Shags find New Zealand a veritable paradise and multiply exceedingly.
One day I hud an excellent view of a Blue Heron feeding. Instead
of standing patiently waiting in one spot, it walked rapidly about a
pool continually making stabs at the water and reminding me rather
of a somewhat active ibis. Although aware of my presence, it continued
to feed. The New Zealanders will insist on calling all Herons &amp;quot; Cranes &amp;quot;.
The White Heron and White-fronted Heron are exceedingly rare. The
Bittern I only saw once. These birds are supposed to be protected,
but the feathers are much sought after for making trout flies, and the
Maoris (and, I fear, sometimes the whites), knowing the value of the
skins, do not fail to procure them.
The Swamp Hen or Pukeko (Porphyria melanotus) is said to
be common. I doubt it, as it is a very tame bird and the Maoris kill
it for food. I have repeatedly seen a few of the birds on different
occasions, and they present a quaint appearance amongst the flax
rushes, manuka, and other undergrowth. I never saw any other Rails,
and (except in the case of the Weka Rails) could scarcely find anyone
who had heard of even their existence.
I much wanted to see a Wrybill Plover, but never got the
opportunity. Nowadays they are said to be extremely rare. I,

however, noticed quite a lot of little Plover, which I was told were
Sand Plover, though judging from illustrations they looked to me like
&amp;apos; ; Banded Dotterel &amp;quot;. Anyhow, they quite lacked the grace of form of
our own little Ringed Plover.
I got some excellent views of Pied Stilts feeding in a shallow lagoon
of! the edge of Lake Rotorua. I had previously seen one flying over,
but on inquiry was told there were no Stilts there. I should have
much liked a photo of the feeding birds, which were close at hand, and
in their movements reminded me of the Avocets at the London Zoo
when nesting there some years ago. Incidentally, I should like to ask
whether it would not be possible to get over to England some of these
Pied Stilts. They swarm on the coast in some places and at some
seasons. The Black Stilts are much rarer, and only once did I see (or
think I saw) a pair flying over. The Avocet seems non-existent in
New Zealand.
Weka Rails are by no means uncommon, and a friend of mine
travelling through the South Island describes them as being most
amusingly bold.
My inquiries as to Ducks were specially disappointing. One may
say of the average New Zealander --
A duck beside the river brim,
A Grey or Mallard is to him,
And it is nothing more.
Both Grey and Mallard are looked at from the culinary point of view
only. Anything outside these seems regarded as a harmless eccentricity
of nature of little account. It is plain, however, that constant shooting
with large duck guns has pretty well cleared many places which formerly
swarmed with duck of various kinds. In Government reserves, however,
there are still many varieties of interest to be found, as for instance at
Hamurana on Lake Rotorua, where Black Teal are very plentiful and
are quite tame. I never saw any Grebe of any kind, although I was
often in places where I expected to find them. On the other hand,
Black Swans are quite plentiful.
Kingfishers are common. The first 1 saw was on a croquet hoop
in a garden in the village of Russell. My surprise was naturally great,
but later I grew accustomed to expect them almost anywhere. The

82 C. Bambij Smith. -- Notes on New Zealand Birds
New Zealand Kingfisher quite lacks in form and colour the grace and
beauty of our English bird.
As to Hawks, the Harriers seemed hanging in the air almost every-
where I went, and I was informed they did considerable damage, and
I fear are on the increase. Other Hawks appear to be quite rare. I do
not recall seeing a single specimen.
The Morepork Owl is the only owl common throughout the country.
The New Zealand Quail is now extinct, but imported Australian
Quail are found in some districts, though in small numbers. On the
other hand, the Californian Quail is very plentiful almost everywhere,
at any rate, in the North Island. I was much interested in watching
a pair of them with a brood of young on a road in the outskirts of Auck-
land last November ; the cock bird, of course, an embodiment of
fussiness and with the usual distracted sense of parental responsibility.
The Quail is, I think, the only game bird of all those imported which is
really successful at the present time. Partridges have been a dead
failure, and pheasants have &amp;quot; gone back &amp;quot; and become scarce in many
places where formerly plentiful. The reason is probably five-fold,
namely : (1) bush burning, (2) poison laid for rabbits, (3) poaching by
Maoris, (4) a plague of stoats, and (5) Harrier Hawks.
I never saw any Kiwis, nor had I an opportunity to undertake the
lengthy search in back country blocks, which the attempt to see any
would have entailed. From many inquiries, however, I came to the con-
clusion that these birds are even now not so rare as is supposed, though,
of course, they are very seldom seen. The numbers that must be
destroyed by bush fires and stoats is, nevertheless, great. A friend
of mine, a farmer, spoke of it as being no uncommon occurrence for his
sheep-dog to kill Kiwis. The best way of catching them alive is by
a soft-mouthed retriever.
T was amazed to see in the New Plymouth district almost the
commonest bird was the Mynah. Whether they have come from &amp;quot; the
islands &amp;quot; on their own account, or have been artificially introduced,
I do not know. Sometimes they frequent a district for a few years
and then all vanish. This was the case recently in a district near
Wellington, and the Mynahs were said to be driven out by the Starlings,
which sounds strange.

C. Barriby Smith-- Notes on New Zealand Birds 83
The Huia is said to be extinct, but I have it on good authority that
the Maoris deny this, and could produce some if a licence were obtained
and they were paid to get the birds. The Maoris are keen observers of
many things, and their opinion in the matter of birds is usually worth
attention.
The Tui, or Parson Bird, is a bird in which the New Zealanders
take special pride, and as soon as birds are mentioned the question is
asked, &amp;quot; Have you seen or heard the Tui ? &amp;quot; and then follows a
rhapsody as to its note being much better than the nightingale&amp;apos;s. I
have on several occasions seen these birds, but the excitement their
appearance causes is in itself an indication of their rarity. Bush fires
and bush clearance are doubtless the main causes.
Of small native birds the lovely little Fantails are the most con-
spicuous^-quite fearless and very pretty to watch as they actively
move about the manuka or other bushes. The White-eye, or Zosterops
(which first came over from Australia about seventy years ago), is also
a delightful little bird and fairly common.
I never saw a Parrot in New Zealand. It is quite easy to find any
number of Keas if one goes to the right places. Kakas are rarer --
Kakapos very rare indeed (most New Zealanders seem never to have
even heard of them), whilst the smaller Parrakeets, although by many
believed to be extinct, yet are still to be found, I understand, in out-
of-the-way districts. They are, however, according to my information,
very erratic in their movements. None will be seen in a certain district
for some years ; then they come in considerable numbers quite suddenly,
and as suddenly vanish. Their extinction can, I fear, be only delayed
for a few years.
The good the Government is doing by protecting birds in the way
of reserves, both on the mainland and on certain islands, is worthy of
all praise by aviculturists, and I hope there is no truth in the statement
that stoats have found their way to at least one of the islands and that
the keepers on another of the islands keep cats. At present the
Government are not issuing any licences for export of native birds.
Considering the awful slaughter of birds that is taking place owing to
stoats, bush fires, rabbit poisoning, bush clearance, and other causes,
it seems a pity that a strictly limited number of licences to export are

not granted yearly to those genuinely interested in aviculture. The
indirect good in tending to educate public opinion as to the intense
interest of bird life would far outweigh the damage done by the relatively
small number of birds taken.
In conclusion I should like to express a hope that the above notes
of commonplace things are not unduly prolix ; my only excuse for
writing at all is that owing to changed conditions books and records
written only a few years ago are to day hopelessly misleading.

By Hubert D. Astley
My birds have been so frequently written about that it is difficult
for me to supply anything fresh. I had not realized how antagonistic
Stanley Cranes can become. My pair, the male being full-winged, was
completely docile for a year and a half, but this spring all that changed,
so that finally the male had to be caught and suffer the ignominy of
a clipped wing and imprisonment along with his mate in a wire enclosure.
They took to standing on a narrow bridge, or along a paved pathway,
defying humans who wished to pass along, and because it was I who
generally came to the rescue the male took an intense dislike to me,
attacking me savagely at every opportunity, especially when he saw
me in what he thought was retreat. His attack was no joke, for being
full winged, he jumped into the air a little above the level of one&amp;apos;s face,
with extended legs and talons, so that one day as he descended he ripped
not only one of my stockings, but the leg which it covered, for these
crane&amp;apos;s claws are excessively sharp and curved after the manner of a
bird of prey. One of the womenfolk, coming across the narrow paved
path between two ponds, encountered him. I was near by and called
out : &amp;quot; If you walk straight on I don&amp;apos;t think he&amp;apos;ll do anything.&amp;quot; She
took my advice. In her arms was a large basket of clean linen, fresh
from the wash. Up flew the Stanley Crane, legs to the fore, catching
the basket with his claws. Tableau !
My only means of resisting his onslaughts was to arm myself with
a large landins-net, and even then he would charge again and again,
dodging the net, whilst I fenced with this rather cumbersome foil in

desperation ; and in such a tussle one day, I having apparently come
out as conqueror, putting the net over his head and pushing him into
the pond, where I held him down for half a minute, he was undefeated.
Shaking my fist at him, reminding him of his ingratitude for all my
loving care of him and his wife. I walked away. Hardly had I taken
five steps before -- whirr ! a flapping of great pinions and he was at
me again. He will also attack an Alsatian wolf dog, bowling her right
over and leaving her terrified. If he behaved to children in this manner
he would be really dangerous.
Such a magnificent bird, and now deprived, through his own
foolishness, of flight. He no doubt regrets it, and so do I, for to see the
big bird coming over the house and flapping on broad pinions round the
meadows, calling as he went, was a fine and, in England, an utterly
uncommon sight. He never went far and never really high in the air,
his wife running to catch him up, shrieking at him to return, which he
always did. I have not actually pinioned him, and may permit him to
be full-winged once more during the winter. Not in the spring ! He
killed my White Peacock. Of course, having been practically living the
life of a wild bird, his condition is superb ; no Stanley Crane in Africa
could be better. When he is in a bad temper he puffs out his head
feathers beyond the normal, reminding one of the hood of a cobra.
Twice this year have my Australian Cranes (Native Companion)
had eggs, and each time (?) the Jackdaws have succeeded in filching
them. The birds had their nest in the middle of a large meadow, and
were fed there, so that they should not have to leave the eggs. The last
time, in May, they had incubated them for nearly thirty days, and
then suddenly the eggs were not !
The White-necked Cranes also had theirs, but they were clear.
The Manchurians are sitting as I write. Last year their eggs were
clear.
As to other species, I have been more successful, although I touch
wood when saying so ! My hen Satyr Tragopan laid twelve eggs and
then died, but out of the twelve I have seven young ones. Of all
charming chicks these are the most fascinating, because they are so
exceedingly fearless and free of any timidity, just as likely to fly on
to one&amp;apos;s knee as on to their foster-mother&amp;apos;s back (a Rhode tsland Red

hen). Kusset in colour, especially about the head, born with fully
developed wing feathers, and if the weather be fairly good, not at all
difficult to rear. I give them custard to commence with, mixed with
dried ants&amp;apos; cocoons and insectile food, but they soon take to pheasant
meal, and love lettuce chopped fine, dandelion leaves, etc., and clean
gentles. At a month old they have the colouring of the adult female -- \0x25A0
a rich spotted russet-brown. At times one of them flies on to one&amp;apos;s
shoulder as unconcerned as a starling on a sheep&amp;apos;s back. Tragopans
are far tamer at this age, or any age, than Monauls. By the by, my old
hen Monaul (Impeyan Pheasant) has her brood of five, hatched by
herself in a small aviary, and two males reared by me in 1918 are still
at large. One in the woods, always wild ; the other amongst the poultry,
to whom he displays ridiculously, looking like some Eastern potentate
garbed in gorgeous violets and blues, and bedecked in sapphires and
emeralds with a neckpiece of burnished copper. His full display is
amusing. I have watched him in an orchard. He stoops to the ground,
works his opened wings up and down like a toy wound up, then rushes
forward for a few yards in this position, suddenly stopping, raising
himself up, turning and walking away with head in the air, chestnut
tail widely spread, and white rump gleaming. An extraordinary
spectacle, but not so fascinating, nor really so beautiful, as the display
of the Tragopans.
My male Satyr Tragopan was very pugnacious this last April
(I do not know why, but so many birds seemed to be full of a war-like
spirit this year ; it is catching, I suppose), and attacked me in
the aviary, spurring my hands and drawing blood. Then he would
walk round me, swelling out all his splendid Venetian-red body, starred
with white spots, compressing his head feathers, and letting down
his horns, brilliant turquoise blue-green, a marvellous contrast of
culour against the black of the crest and the glowing red of the body,
never quite showing all his wattle, which is turquoise blue with rose
spots, as vivid as the finest Limoges enamel, and more so. One so
seldom is there at the right moment to see the full display, which only
lasts three weeks at the most. My aviary-keeper told me that the male
Tragopan jumped on to his back very often when he was stooping down
to clean up, where the bird would peck angrily at his cap, and how one

day when he suddenly dislodged him the Tragopan&amp;apos;s wattle was fully
displayed, so that the bird probably always showed this beauty on these
occasions; but as he was on my bird-keeper&amp;apos;s back, the latter could not
see what was going on. And all the time the Tragopan kept up a
clucking which would grow into a subdued version of the loud, weird
&amp;quot; wa-a-a-ah ! &amp;quot; which he utters in the courting season, opening his
mouth as wide as Tetrazzini when she achieves a top note !

On a recent visit to Clifton 1 had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Burgess&amp;apos;s
very fine collection of birds, and was greatly surprised to find such a
number of rarities. They are kept in a bird-room, which is fitted
up with numerous aviaries where many different species live together
on the best of terms. It would be extremely difficult to say which was
the rarest bird in this collection of rarities. There is a fine specimen of
the White-rumped Lory (Eos fuscala), an equally good Black Lory
(Chalcopsittacus ater), and a little further along one comes across three
examples of the Varied Lorikeet (Ptilosclera versicolor), a species which
I thought had not been imported since 1902, when the first arrival of
this species from North-west Australia made quite a sensation amongst
aviculturists, as some of the older members of this Society will
remember.
Starlings and Bower Birds. -- There was one compartment full
of Glossy Starlings of several species, including Burchell&amp;apos;s, the Long-
tailed, Green, and others of some of those smaller species which are
very difficult to identify without careful comparison. There were

Pied Starlings and Amethyst Starlings. A lovely specimen of the
Australian Cat-bird, in its rich green dress, shared a compartment with
a Satin Bower Bird, also clad in the green plumage of the female or
immature male.
Parrakeets and Others. -- Of Parrakeets there were the Queen
Alexandra, Rock Poplar, Kings, Crimson-wings, Pennants, Adelaides,
Rosellas, Uvean, Barnards and Baiters, Golden-crowned and Jendaya

Conures, not to mention a host of Blue Budgerigars and Green
Budgerigars that have been bred from Blues, and are likely therefore
to produce Blues. There were Black-capped Lories intent upon nesting,
Hawk-headed Parrots, Guira Cuckoos, an Oven Bird, Ked-cheeked
Colies, and a great many more that I have forgotten.
Brinsop Court. -- Thanks to the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Astley,
I visited Brinsop Court, justly famed on account of the great interest
attaching to the house itself, and its splendid collection of birds.
Mr. Gerard Gurney has given us an account of the latter, and little
therefore remains to be said. Not only does the collection contain
many great rarities, but all are in the most splendid condition and kept
in ideal surroundings. When I was there during the last days of April
several interesting birds were nesting. The European Cranes in the
Park had just been robbed by Crows, but White-necked Cranes were
sitting. We found several Ducks&amp;apos; nests near the moat, and in the
aviary itself Queen Alexandra Parrakeets were incubating ; one hen
paired to her proper mate, another to a cock Barraband Parrakeet.
Baby Blue Budgerigars peeped from their nesting logs, and a Monaul
Pheasant hen sat tightly on five eggs. A number of eggs had been
laid by a Satyr Tragopan, which were being incubated by a domestic
hen, and I hear since that seven chicks have been hatched, while the
Monaul has a brood of five.
The Wood Hoopoe or Kakelaar. -- Amongst a collection from
South Africa received by Mr. Hamlyn, I noticed a fine specimen of the
Wood Hoopoe (Irrisor viridis), which is, I believe, the first ever
imported. This bird has the head, neck, and upper back glossy green,
the rump and upper tail-coverts and wings blue, the latter spotted with
white. The strongly graduated tail is blue, the outer feathers spotted
with white ; the throat and neck are steel-blue, and the breast green.
The long, curved bill and the legs and feet are red. This is a forest-
loving species, frequenting the highest trees and usually associating
in parties of some half-dozen birds. They are said to possess an
extremely disagreeable odour.
Tataupa Tinamous. -- Among the recent additions to the Zoological
Society&amp;apos;s collection are six specimens of the Tataupa Tinamou
(Crypturus tataupa), a representative of a remarkable group of South

American birds with very extraordinary breeding habits. A full
account of these birds, and of their nesting and rearing young in
captivity, appeared in the Avicultural Magazine for August and
October, 1904, and with the first of these instalments appeared a
coloured plate of the adult and newly hatched chick. In the
Tinamous the female is the larger and more vigorous bird, and
she courts the male, who incubates the eggs and rears the
young ; but the duties of the female Tinamou are not finished
for the season when she has laid one clutch of eggs. She takes
no further interest in male No. 1, but looks around with much
calling for male No. 2, and having found him she lays a second clutch
of eggs, which he proceeds to incubate, and in all probability, in the
wild state, this is repeated with two or three more males. In
the case of the Tataupas bred in 1904, no less than fourteen
young birds were reared in the one season from a single female
and two males. When male No. 1 commenced to incubate his
batch of four pink eggs, the female was transferred to another
compartment of the aviary, in which was male No. 2. She
promptly set about nesting again, and laid him a clutch, and by the
time he had sat out his period of twenty-one days the brood hatched
by No. 1 were nearly reared and the female was allowed to go back
to her first mate. The third clutch of eggs followed and was hatched
by No. 1, and subsequently a fourth which No. 2 eventually hatched.
This habit of polyandry in birds is not confined to the Tinamous ;
it obtains also in the Hemipodes, or Bustard Quails, and probably in
other species, such as the Phalaropes and Painted Snipe, in which the
female is the larger and more brightly coloured of the two sexes.
Chukor Partridges. -- Mr. Maurice Portal writes : &amp;quot; I have a pair
of Cretan Chukor Partridges (Caccabis saxatilis) breeding in the garden.
The nest is made by scraping out a round hole, some six inches deep,
which both birds work at by turning round and round in it. The cock
then collects a leaf or piece of straw, and tosses it back over his shoulders
to the hen, who takes it and puts it in the nest, which is a very rough
affair. She lays daily, but for some reason the cock goes on the nest
every day for a bit. They desert very easily. I removed three eggs
at the top, using a spoon for the purpose, as there were twelve in the

nest and the bottom ones were so deep down that I thought they could
not get any heat. The cock came up, looked in and went off and
brought the hen, who had a good look, too. Both then went off to the
potting shed and proceeded to make a new nest a couple of feet away
from the gardener&amp;apos;s feet as he was working, and laid at once.&amp;quot;

From time to time one reads in the daily papers of strange friend-
ships between different kinds of birds and animals. One of the most
curious cases of this kind that has come under my notice has occurred
this spring in one of my aviaries. Last autumn I bought from Hamlyn
a pair of South African Plovers ; these on arrival proved to be
Temminck&amp;apos;s Coursers, an adult hen and a young one. They were very
pretty little birds, a trifle larger than our Ringed Plover. The hen
was in bad health and did not live long, but by keeping it indoors
during the winter, and by careful nursing, I managed to save the
young one. This spring I turned it into an aviary with a South African
Quail hen and two or three pairs of small birds. From the first it tried
to make friends with the Quail, but the latter did not respond. Later
on I introduced a cock Egyptian Quail as a mate for the southern
bird. The little Plover at once attached itself to it, and when handed
a mealworm, which it would take from my fingers, it would trot away
in search of its friend, calling to it in a low and rather plaintive whistle.
Very soon the Quail would come at once in response to the whistle,
and I regret to say that he now pays more attention to the Plover than
he does to his more legitimate mate. Mealworms are rather scarce,
and the other birds in the aviary have always looked on with rather
jealous eyes as I have handed them out to the Plover. The little
wretch will devour a dozen at a time if allowed to do so, but never
before he has carried one or two to the Quail. Latterly affairs in this
respect have become more complicated, -as pairs of Diuca Finches
{Diuca minor) and Golden Breasted Buntings (Emberiza flpviventris)
have nested in the aviary, and it has been quite a common sight to see
one of these birds snatch the worm from the beak of the Plover before

he could get to the Quail with it. The astonishment and indignation of
both the Quail and the Plover are quite comic. Recently a little Black-
cap Warbler hen found its way into the aviary, I don&amp;apos;t quite know
how, but it has become apparently a willing prisoner. This bird has
proved a great thorn in the flesh to our two friends, as not only will
it snatch the worms from out of their very beaks, but it will even catch
them in the air when thrown to them. It is extraordinary how tame
this bird has become in a short time. One day it helped itself to some
bread and milk I was carrying in my hand. The Plover is now coming
into adult plumage. In juvenile plumage they are very like miniature
Golden Plovers. If a true pair could be obtained I feel sure that they
would breed here.

The Value of Insectivorous Birds
The current number of the Auk, vol. xxxviii, No. 2, contains the
concluding parts of Alfred 0. Gross&amp;apos;s paper upon the Dickcissel (Spiza
americana) and of Harrison F. Lewis&amp;apos;s article on the nesting of the
Philadelphia Viieo, the first parts of which were noticed in a recent
number of our magazine. The former is principally devoted to the
plumage changes from the time of hatching to maturity, the various
phases being illustrated by over a score of photographs, but to avicul-
turists perhaps the most interesting section will be the pages devoted to
the food of this bird from its earliest days to the time of its death.
Mr. Gross clearly shows that although this bird eats a certain amount
of grain, mostly waste grain, at harvest-time, it is of incalculable benefit
to the farmer for the number of grasshoppers it destroys. He computes
that in the State of Illinois alone the Dickcissels during the active period
of the nesting season save the State over four million dollars a day by
keeping down the grasshoppers which feed on the growing hav-crops.
Divorce amongst Wrens
Mr. S. Prentice Baldwin has some interesting observations on the
banding, what we call the &amp;quot; ringing &amp;quot;. of birds, and of the practical
application of this method of identification to the study of the habits
of the House Wren {Troglodytes nnl,,),). He shows, incidentally, that

&amp;quot; divorce &amp;quot; in the case of this species is not an uncommon phenomenon,
and that the old and more or less generally accepted belief that most
birds mate for life, and each year return to the site of the previous
nest to rear their young, must, like most cherished sentiments connected
with animals, be abandoned so far as this Wren is concerned, and be
regarded as still subjudice in the case of other species.
Sparroics and Motor Traffic
Apart from the other articles already noticed, perhaps the one that
will interest our leaders most is a short account of the reaction of
motor-cars upon our ubiquitous and much abused friend the Common
Sparrow in Denver City. Mr. W. H. Bergtold sums up the results of
his investigations as follows : --
(1) There are fewer Sparrows in Denver than ten years ago ; (2)
there has been a notable decrease in the horse population of Denver
during the past five years ; (3) there has been a very patent diminution
in the amount of sweepings gathered from the streets of Denver during
the past decade ; (4) the reduction in street sweepings has resulted in
diminishing the Sparrow population by starvation ; (5) all these results
hinge on the introduction and multiplied uses of the motor-vehicle.

Sirs, -- Amongst the many readers of the Avicultural Magazine
I wonder if anyone can give me an explanation as to the cause of
malformed feathers. In May, 1917, I obtained a Grey Parrot -- quite
a young bird, for he still had the black eyes which began to change
about a month after I had him, so I judged him to be about 8 months
old. I noticed in the right wing he had a malformed feather. It is a
kind of double feather split down the middle, the split edges being red.
He has no other feather like it, the rest of the plumage being smooth
light grey. I naturally thought that when he moulted the new
feather would be a normal one, but I was mistaken ; each year he has
shed it, and each year the same malformed feather appears. As far

as one can feel, there has been no injury to the wing. Therefore I should
be glad of any suggestion as to the cause of this curious feather.

show their distinctness and structure. In the natural state they were closely
applied to one another in such a way that the planes of their upper surfaces were

I have ever seen. I hope one or two others have been, or will be, saved.
I should like to have one. It is difficult to account for their curious
abnormality, but I suspect that it is due to the fusion of two feather
germs, owing to an abnormal shortening of that portion of the skeleton
to which this, or perhaps these two feathers, is attached. Will you ask
your correspondent which number in the series this represents ? If a
section were carefully and cleanly cut through the calamus of this feather,
I believe we should find a double column of pith cells, each representing
a single feather. But I have not ventured to cut the feather up.

No. 1 is about the size of a Cowbird, but in colour it is like the female
of the Black Tanager. The inner webs of its flight feathers are whitish.
Its bill, which is very short and greyish in colour, is the stoutest I have
seen in any Grosbeak.
No. 2 is about the size of a Canary, and its general body colour is
brownish-grey, heavily striated on the breast with a darker shade of the
same colour. Its forehead and throat are huffish yellow.
No. 3 is a very pretty bird about the same size as the last. General
colour chocolate ; throat, cheeks, and eyebrow, streaks white ; head,
tail, and a band below throat, black ; flight feathers, black with their
base white ; under-parts pale chocolate.
This bird is a fine singer and is undoubtedly a cock. The only sound
I have heard from the others is a sparrow-like chirp, so they may be
females.

Sirs, -- As regards the remarks by Dr. Amsler about food of Swain-
son&amp;apos;s Lorikeet, and by Mr. Seppings, it may be worth adding that when
I was Assistant Medical Officer at the County Asylum, Hereford, in
1902 and 1903, there were two Lorikeets, almost certainly Swainson&amp;apos;s,
in a large cage in &amp;quot; Ward I, Women&amp;apos;s Side &amp;quot;. One of the patients used to
feed these birds regularly with the usual milk puddings given to human
occupants, namely, rice, tapioca, etc., made with fresh cow&amp;apos;s milk,
and during the time I was there the birds were both very healthy. I
used to given them bits of bread and plain cake, but, like Dr. Amsler&amp;apos;s
birds, they did not care much for fruit.
This pair at the Asylum were amusing in the way they treated with
contempt and complete indifference the few patients who were inclined
to try and interfere with them. On the other hand, they were very
friendly with patients who fed them, never attempting to pe:k. During
the time I knew them one of the men patients working at the farm
threw a stone at a squirrel and knocked it down, it being stunned
sufficiently to make it easy to capture alive ; and on its recovery I
put it into another large cage near the Lorikeets, but with several feet
between the two cages. On seeing the squirrel both Lorikeets got

tremendously excited for some days presumably thinking i\ was some
inhabitant of their native country and would, it seemed to me, have
readily attacked it, had they been allowed. Are they hostile to small
mammals ? Whether the above birds are still alive I cannot say,
but if any readers are in that neighbourhood it might be worth
inquiring, because, if so, it would throw some light on the length of
life in the species.
Can Dr. Amsler give any information about the age of his male
and female ? Are they about the same age ? If not, which is the older
bird ? If such facts are known they might be useful knowledge for
breeders trying to mate up a pair in the future.

Sirs, -- With reference to the Scarlet Ibis, Lord Tavistock is quite
right ; these birds will retain their colour in captivity. My bird has
moulted out a iicher colour this year than last ; some of its feathers
are quite scarlet. It is in a large aviary with a good-sized pond, and is
fed on bread and milk, biscuit meal, and cooked meat. A young
Roseate Spoonbill that I had for nearly two years never came into
colour, but the bird was never in very good health, which perhaps
accounted for this.

By Hubert D. Astley
(Continued from p. 87.)
For some six or seven years a female Euddy-headed Goose
(Chlcephaga nibidiceps) had almost entirely ignored her own kith and
kin at Brinsop, and has been dnbbed &amp;quot; The lady in waiting &amp;quot;, for, like
Mary&amp;apos;s lamb, she follows a pair of Manchurian Cranes everywhere.
If the Cranes move too rapidly at times the Goose, which is full-winged,
catches them up by flying. And then came a male Monaul, he who
struts amongst the poultry, taking upon himself the office of lord-in-
waiting, and driving off the Goose, so that at last the latter had to
resign her post. It is most incongruous to see the Monaul in full and
resplendent uniform, trotting at the Crane&amp;apos;s heels. The Goose was less
so, but Manchurian Cranes and Monauls are so widely apart in
appearance and habits. If the Cranes do not proceed as fast as the
Monaul thinks they should, he pecks their heels, and will trot in this
manner all about a large meadow. The Cranes must share the feelings
of royalty and foster a desire to be sometimes permitted to go out on
their own.
I have bad luck with my Cranes. Each year Manchurians, White-
necked and Australian, have eggs (they are true pairs), but the eggs
are always infertile. Yet the Australians, at any rate, have been seen
to mate.
This year I have managed to find more Ducks&amp;apos; eggs than usual,
for the Ducks are at liberty on the moat surrounding the house, and the

two ponds in the garden, and can, furthermore, stray away, which
some of them do in the breeding season, so that nests are difficult to
find. However, I have a goodly number of young summer Ducks
(Carolina), some Pintails, and three Bahamas. It is far better to hatch
them under Bantams, and 1 find Yokohama Bantams are excellent
mothers. Large hens cannot help crushing the tiny ducklings during
the first two or three days of their lives, for the ducklings lie so flat
and are apparently nothing but down, so that the hens are, however
worthy their intentions, quite unaware when they have their feet on
the. babies. I keep my ducklings in small Bantam&amp;apos;s houses, shutting
them at night in the roosting houses, which have sliding doors for
exit into the wired runs, which are covered. There are no floors to these
runs, and the houses can be wheeled on to fresh grass every day. A
large pan rilled with duck-weed and just enough water for the ducklings
to dibble in is provided, the duck-weed being gathered from a pond
and teeming with shrimps. Duck-meal is scattered on the grass and
amongst the weed, and I also give clean maggots and fly cocoons. I put
an earthenware saucer of moistened meal in the little roosting-bousa
when the birds are shut in for the night, so that they can feed as early
as they like next morning, and be out of danger from rats during the
night. A few years ago I had a brood of eight Pintails, half-grown and
feathering well. I left the shutter of the roosting-house open one
night. Next morning five were lying mauled and dead. A rat had
worked in under the wire run !
I have had great hopes that my pair of Indian Cotton Teal would
nest. The only pair in Europe ! which I have had for eight years.
The little male has displayed constantly to his mate this spring, and
as constantly uttered his curious call, which may be described as
kak-kak ! kak-kak-kak ! A very conspicuous bird in his nuptial
plumage, snow white face and flanks, and bottle-green back ; a black
line divides the white of the neck from that of the flanks. The eyes are
ruby red. I have never seen these birds dive, and to eat grain under
water it must be in the shallows, where they can reach it by tipping up.
I would that more of this tiny and lovely species could be sent to
England, since I have proved that it can be most easily kept, and is
apparently as long-lived as other ducks, and very hardy.

Hubert D. Astley -- Avioultural Notes 1J9
I have a male Golden-eye mated to a female Tufted Duck. Last
year she successfully concealed her nest and hatched out her brood of
eight or nine, but as usual all disappeared, one after the other. One
tries to throw food to these Ducks with young ones, but either they
at once swim hard in an opposite direction, or adult Ducks assemble
and devour it. The only species I could induce to be sensible and
recognize one was wishing to help them to rear their young, has been
the Shelduck. I have four Bar-headed Goslings, hatched under a hen.
In the aviary a pair of Red-crested Grey Cardinals had three youn ;
ones, but they were taken by something. That is the worst of a mixed
collection. My Diamond Doves suffer likewise. Three pairs have had
nests, and each time the young have been killed, neither can I discover
the culprit ; so that I consider I have lost at least six Diamond Doves
this spring. One day I saw a Budgerigar on one of the nests, doing its
best to turn out the eggs, and although I scared it away it was
apparently successful, for two days after the eggs had disappeared.
On 3rd June a boy brought me a fully fledged young Lesser Spotted
Woodpecker, which he had picked up in the road, possibly injured.
A charming little bird. Perhaps it had tried to fly across the road on
leaving the nest, and had fallen short. I fed him at first on fly-
chrysalises, opening his beak for the purpose, but he did not live.
I say &amp;quot; he &amp;quot; because the wish was father to the thought ! The female
lacks the red on the head, which is such an additional beauty to the
black and white barred plumage. This little bird seemed such a pigmy
by the side of my Golden-headed Woodpecker from the Himalayas
On the aviary lawn the Noah&amp;apos;s ark is cosmopolitan. Amongst the coops
and Bantam runs containing Ducklings of three or four species, young
Ho-kis (eared pheasants), Bar-headed Goslings, Satyr Tragopan chicks,
and Yokohama Bantams, there stroll white Peafowl and two Duiker
Antelopes and Demoiselle Cranes, following one for tit-bits. The
Trumpeter had to be shut up, as he showed signs of pecking the baby
Tragopans, and he is absolutely fearless of attacks from hens, for he
waves his wings at them and quite dismays them.

By T. H. Newman, M.B.O.U.
On 1 st May of last year two Rosy-grey Turtle-doves were deposited
in the Zoological Gardens, one of which was afterwards presented to the
Society by Major Maurice Portal on 30th July.
When considering this species one is confronted with one of those
fascinatingly maddening problems of nomenclature. These birds
were entered under the name of &amp;quot; Turtur roseigriseus &amp;quot;. Unfortunately
Ave are now forbidden to use Turtur in this connexion, since it must be
applied to the little African Amethyst- and Emerald-spotted Doves,
formerly known as Chalcopelia, which sounds like a riddle -- when is
a Turtle-dove not a Turtle-dove ? The answer to which T suppose would
be, when it is a Turtur, for no one is likely to call the species of
Chalcopelia Turtle-doves ; also the specific name must be spelt
roseogrisea, as Sundevall wrote &amp;quot; C(olumba) roseogriseam vocamus&amp;quot;.
The Turtle-doves (with the exception of the tranquebarica group) are
now placed in the genus Streptopelia.
The extraordinary interest of the Rose-grey Turtle-dove lies in the
fact that there can be no reasonable doubt that it was the wild ancestor
from which the familiar so-called Barbary Dove has been derived.
I have before referred to this in our Magazine, 1 when I stood sponsor
to the Burmese race of the well-known Indian Ring or Collared Turtle-
dove. I am glad to say that this form has been upheld and is mentioned
both in Mr. E. C. Stuart Baker&amp;apos;s 2 beautiful book on Indian Columbce,
and by Dr. Hartert in his great work on Palaearctic birds, 3 and I also
possess eggs taken in Burma and kindly presented to me by Mr. Stuart
Baker. Lest it might be thought that I feel unduly elated by this, let
me mention that not only did I receive a rebuke from our jDresent
Hon. Secretary at the time for presuming to describe a new form without
a type specimen (the bird I founded my description on was destroyed
by rats), but Mr. Douglas Dewar in his entertaining book, Birds of
the Plains, made some amusing remarks on changes of nomenclature

in what he calls &amp;quot; Up-to-date species-making &amp;quot;. He thinks every bird
has its name changed about once in each decade. He noted my paper
on the Collared Turtle-dove of Burma, which he at last discovered to
be a form of the bird which has been known as the Indian Ring Dove,
Turtur risorius, of most of the older well-known writers on Indian
birds. He is greatly exercised on my daring to describe a new form,
and continues : &amp;quot; Thus Mr. T. H. Newman has discovered that the
skin round the eye of the ring dove of Burma is not whitish, as it is in
India, but yellow ; Mr. Newman therefore manufactures a new sub-
species, which he calls Turtur decaocta xanthoci/clus, as opposed to the
Indian bird which he calls Turtur decaocta doaraca. We may consider
ourselves lucky that he has not made a new species of the Burmese
bird ! &amp;quot; I expressly stated that I did &amp;quot; not for a moment think the
bird &amp;quot; would ; &amp;apos; be found worthy of specific rank &amp;quot;. As Mr. Dewar does
not seem to be acquainted with the Burmese bird, his objections cannot
be taken very seriously. The name douraca of 1844, being a nomen
nudum, cannot be used, but as the Indian bird has not yet been found to
possess constant distinguishing characteristics from the East European
form it can be united with the latter under typical decaocta, or, more
correctly, decaocto, as originally spelt. As this is the bird which has been
so persistently called &amp;quot; risorius &amp;quot;, I must once more run through
what has been written about it. The original reference is Columba
risoria, Linne, Syst. Nat., ed. x, i, p. 165 (1758), and on the strength of
Habitat in India, this has been supposed to refer to the common Ring
Dove of India ; Linne based his name chiefly, among others, on the
&amp;quot; Turtur Indicus &amp;quot; of Aldrovandus. Mr. Stuart Baker in Indian
Pigeons and Doves uses risoria for this species and accuses me, quite
correctly, of not referring to the works of Aldrovandus, Brisson, and
Linne. He mentions the figure published by Aldrovandus in 1637,
under the name of Turtur Indicus, the female of which was said to be
white with red feet and blackish bill. This figure, which Mr. Stuart
Baker calls &amp;quot; an excellent plate of the Turtle-dove &amp;quot; is not coloured,
and I agree with Dr. Hartert in thinking it might equally well represent
a Barbary Dove, or a wild Indian one or one of several African species.
There is nothing either in Aldrovandus&amp;apos;s long account or in those of
any of the other authors quoted by Linne which would lead one to

suppose that they were acquainted with the Indian bird, while, on the
other hand, the cage-bird is quite unmistakably referred to. In 1735
Eleazar Albin published a coloured plate of &amp;quot; The Turtle-dove from the
East Indies &amp;quot; ; this is a quite excellent figure of a Barbary Dove.
He mentions that &amp;quot; they arc tame, pretty birds, and kept in cages by
the curious, in which they will breed and bring up their young &amp;quot;.
Latham, Syn. ii, 2, p. 648, No. 42, 1783, under Collared Turtle,
gives a good description. He mentions &amp;quot; the fore-neck and breast,
white, with a vinaceous tinge, the rest of the underparts white, tail . . .
the two middle feathers plain, the others tipped with white and the outer
one white on the outer edge. This inhabits India, but is a bird common
in France, and other parts of the European continent, but I do not
hear of it at large in England &amp;quot;. He adds a note : &amp;quot; Some think as far
as Sweden, but I think Linnseus&amp;apos;s words do not justify this. He says
&amp;quot; Habitat in India, nobis communis Turtur,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by which I should think
he only means that it is everywhere kept in cages, as with us in England.
Latham&amp;apos;s description is evidently taken from that of Brisson&amp;apos;s Turtur
torquatus ; he gives all Linne&amp;apos;s synonyms, as well as others. Both
Albin and Brisson are quoted by Limit&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as referable to his Columba
risoria, the latter, of course, not until a later edition, as Brisson&amp;apos;s work
was not published before 1760. Temminck and Knip, Les Pigeons,
Fam. sec. pi. 44 (1808-11), under Columba risoria, as of Latham, 1790,
give a good figure of a Barbary Dove, and two plates later one of the
white variety, giving it the name of Columba alba, and stating its origin
to be China.
As long ago as 1873, Schlegel, Mus. Pays Bas. Columb., p. 123, 1
seems to have pointed out that Linne&amp;apos;s C. risoria referred to the Barbary
Dove, as Stejneger, Pr. U.S. Nat. Mus., x, p. 426, 1887, wrote : &amp;quot; It is
curious that Schlegel&amp;apos;s very clear argument should not have been
sufficient to settle beyond dispute the fact that the domestic Ring Dove,
which Linnaeus described as Columba risoria is not a descendant of
the wild bird of India, China, and Japan usually so-called. The
domesticated species belongs to that group of the sub-genus Streptopelia,
which has a comparatively short tail, with the outer tail-feathers entirely

white in the outer web, and it is entirely beyond all probability that
these features which are the normal ones of the genus should have been
derived from the lengthened tail and the blackish outer web of the
outer tail-feathere of T. douraca, features entirely unique. Besides,
there are wild species which in these characters are identical with the
domestic birds, without differing more from it in other respects than
does the wild T. douraca.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
And lastly. Dr. Hartert, Nov. Zool.. xxiii, pp. 78-80, 1916, has gone
very fully into the matter, and shows that all previous writers quoted
by Linne were merely acquainted with the domestic bird, which they
supposed to have come from India ; he then gives details to show that
the Barbary Dove cannot be derived from the wild Indian one, but that,
on the contrary, it agrees very closely with roseogrisea of N.E. Africa.
To return to the birds deposited in the Zoological Gardens, they
certainly so closely resembled the tame bird that they could very easily
pass for small, brightly coloured, Barbary Doves. I was most anxious
to hear their notes, which would have quite settled the question of
origin. I paid them several visits at close quarters, but not a syllable
would they utter, and I suspect them of being hens, the one there now
certainly seems to be one. Dr. Hartert quoted that S. roseogrisea has
the same call as that of our domestic race, though he tells me he has
not heard it himself. I think it has now been quite proved that this
African bird is the ancestor of our Barbary Dove, to which Linne gave
the name of C. risoria. The name itself while most appropriate for the
domesticated bird would be quite misleading for the Indian species
which does not laugh !
It is very greatly to be hoped that more specimens of the Rose-grey
Turtle-dove may be shortly imported. It is a very common bird in
the Egyptian Soudan. Mr. A. L. Butler records, Ibis, p. 359, 1905,
that it is (piite one of &amp;quot; the commonest Doves in the Soudan &amp;quot;. He
found it &amp;quot; in thousands round the wells of Bara, in Kordofan &amp;quot;, while
the Hon. X. C. Rothschild and Mr. A. F. R. Woolaston, writing on birds
from Shondi on the Nile, midway between the Albara river and
Khartoum, Ibis, p. 25, 1902, say that it &amp;quot; was exceedingly common.
Upwards of fifty might sometimes be seen sitting in one of the bigger
trees near the river; it was also well distributed all over the desert.

but less numerous there. Several nests were found in acacia-bushes
at heights varying from 3 to 6 feet from the ground. They were
light structures of twigs, very similar to those of the European Turtle-
dove. The number of eggs was two in every case, they are white with
very little gloss : average measurements 292 by 23 mm.&amp;quot;
The birds from South Arabia have been given the subspecific name
of arabica on account of certain portions of the plumage, which are
pure white in typical roseogrisea, being more or less marked with
dove-grey ; the black collar is also said to be less broad.
Since the domestic Barbary Dove, S. risoria, is derived from the
S. roseogrisea, the question now seems to be, ought not the wild bird to
be included under the former specific name, since it is so much older ?
This was actually done by Erlanger, J. f. 0., p. 123, 1905, pi. vi, though
not in this sense, as unfortunately he applies risoria typically to the
Indian bird, thus making roseogrisea a subspecies of a form with which
it has nothing in common.

Over a hundred years ago Bechstein wrote about the Hawfinch :
&amp;quot; Only a passionate lover of birds would wish to keep this species.&amp;quot;
This libel has been repeated from time to time until now, except for
show purposes, a Hawfinch is rarely kept.
I hope to a certain extent to be able to defend this truly handsome
and delightful bird ; but must, at the commencement, state that I
write entirely of the hand-reared bird. I admit that he is a somewhat
uncertain problem to rear, but a mixture of insect food and Osborne
biscuit will see him through, provided that the utmost care is taken from
the beginning to keep him free from the least draught.
After a Hawfinch has passed his first year, he seems to harden, and
is then a bird of quite sturdy constitution.
A Hawfinch which I have in my possession has quite a genius for
games. He flies on to my shoulder at meal-times and pulls my ear,
looking sideways at any object which takes his interest. He will steal
a salt-spoon, take it into his cage, and behave in the most absurd

manner with it. Once, when on my shoulder, he started to sing his
own song. I added a whistle, whereupon he flew straight back into his
cage and sulked. He is absolutely tame and fearless. If T brush my
finger across the bars of his cage he will dash after it as if he intended
to tear me to pieces, but only to give me a gentle nibble when he catches
my finger.
His natural song is not unpleasant, but he has picked up the song of
a Roller Canary, and, although I cannot claim that he can execute all
the special &amp;quot; tours &amp;quot;, his imitation of the roll would deceive most
people.
At present he is in a partitioned cage with a hen Bullfinch, and to
see him &amp;quot; display&amp;quot; with his crest feathers erect, and his wings drooped
like a Starling, while he rolls out his Canary song, is most fascinating.
I have mentioned the partition in the cage, which is necessary, as
Mrs. Bully is liable to sudden fits of rage, and unless I can slide the
partition between them she will thrash him most unmercifully while
he, to his credit, behaves like a perfect gentleman.
In conclusion, if any of our members can obtain a nest of young
Hawfinches and rear them, I can assure them that not only are the
birds worth keeping, but are the most delightful and engaging pets,
as tame as a Bullfinch and as amusing as a Jackdaw.

By the Hon. Mrs. Algernon Bourke.
I was fortunate enough to pay a visit to the Zoological department
of A. W. Gamage in June at the moment that a consignment of African
birds had arrived. The train, to use a metaphor, was coming in as I
stepped on to the platform. I was unable to examine the contents of
all the cages, owing to the latter being still covered with gauze wire,
but one bird especially attracted my attention, which I secured. It
is said to be Tarsiger stellatus, and is, I imagine, the first importation
of the species. It is allied to (he Redstarts, Forest Chats, Robin Chats,
etc., and my bird superficially reminds me of a Nitiava, but the legs
are longer than in the Fly-catchers.

White-starred Bush Robin has the head and neck with the wings and
upper side of the tail smalt blue ; the back and rump being sage-green.
Underparts, including the tail feathers, amber-yellow ; legs and beak
blackish. But the bird&amp;apos;s distinctive and most interesting feature con-
sists of the two small white spots on either side of the lower forehead,
above the beak, which appear and disappear as the bird erects or
depresses the feathers of the head, and from these &amp;quot; stars &amp;quot; its name of
&amp;quot; stellata &amp;quot; has been derived.
It came over in beautiful condition, and within ten days it was
singing, and continues to do so every morning when it comes out of
its cage for a flight round the room, to which it returns of its own accord.
The song resembles that of the blackbird, and it is altogether a most
charming and attractive pet. It is fed on insectile food and live ants&amp;apos;
eggs and a few mealworms daily.
[Tarsiger stellatus occurs in the forest districts of South Africa,
but little has been recorded of its habits. It is said to be shy and to
inhabit thick bush, and according to Ayres to resemble our Robin in
its habits. There is little doubt that this is the first example to be
imported of a very beautiful species, of which it is to be hoped other
specimens will reach this country. The sexes are outwardly alike. --

This is a particularly interesting time amongst the birds at the
Zoological Gardens, as a good many species are nesting. In the Great
Aviary we have for the first time for many years a good stock of Sacred
Ibises. Two pairs have taken possession of a willow-tree, which has
been trained to form a flat table-like top, and one nest contains two big
young birds, while the other, at the time of writing, is in process of
construction. This is not the first time that Sacred Ibises have bred
in the Gardens, as a single bird was hatched and reared in 1877.
Young Sacred Ibises. -- The young Ibises have the body covered
with white down, and the head and neck with black down, and
the parents feed them in the same way that Pigeons feed their young,
namely by regurgitation, the bill of the young bird being held in that

of the parent. In captivity the feeding of these birds presents no
difficulty, even when they have young, meat, fish, and egg sufficing.
In the wild state they are said to be very destructive, during the breeding
season, amongst the nesting colonies of Penguins and Cormorants,
the young of which they devour.
American Robins. -- In the Summer Aviary a pair of American
Robins has reared two young birds and the hen is sitting again. The
cock was unfortunately not to be trusted with the young of other
birds, and after devouring six baby Painted Quails he was quietly
removed from the aviary, while his mate continues to incubate, and
will, we hope, rear her second brood single-handed, unless the young of
the first brood help in the task, which is not unlikely.
Blue-birds. -- Blue-birds nested in a box and have reared three
young ones, they are now building again, while another pair in the
other compartment of the aviary have a fast growing brood still in the
nest. They are delightful birds, and it is a long time since they were
regularly imported from the States. They were bred at the Zoo
several times between 1860 and 1880, and private aviculturists have
bred them. I may add that all that are reared this year will be
wanted by the Zoological Society.
Gambel&amp;apos;s Quails. -- Gambel&amp;apos;s Quails, which bred for the first time
last year have again done so. The old pair have a brood of six or seven
chicks, and the young pair, those reared last year, are expected to hatch
any day. This Quail, it will be remembered, is something like the
Californian Quail, but to my mind more handsome. It is very rarely
imported, otherwise it would be a great favourite with aviculturists.
Various Birds Nesting.-- Gambel&amp;apos;s White-crowned Sparrow and
the Pileated Sparrow, both have young in the nest, while Brazilian
Blue Grosbeaks are sitting. Brush Bronzewings, Crested Doves,
Barred Doves, Dwarf Turtle-doves, and Triangular-spotted Pigeons
have all reared young.
A\ Abnormal Rosy-faced Lovebird. -- A very interesting variety
of the Rosy-faced Lovebird has been received at the Zoo with other
normal specimens. The rosy tint, which is characteristic of the cheeks,
has spread over nearly the whole of the body, so that the bird is rosy
pink over the greater part of its plumage.

Some Eare African Birds. -- Messrs. Gamage continue to receive
consignments of birds from South Africa, and have recently had for
sale specimens of the Cape Robin Chat (Cossypha caffra), Noisy Robin
Chat (C. bicolor), White-browed Coucal (Centropns superciliosus), Ruddy-
breasted Bush Shrike (Laniarius rubiginosus), and Greater Puff-backed
Bush Shrike (Dryoscopus fenugineus).
A NEW LIOTHRIX
Monsieur Delacour received from Marseilles amongst a lot of
Liothrix luteas (the common Pekin Robin, or Hill Tit) a pair of what
appears to be a new species. Both male and female have red foreheads
with orange-red on the ear-coverts and a much brighter orange-red
on the neck and upper breast. Otherwise they resemble L. luteus.
M. Delacour has proposed the name of L. asileyi, in honour of the
President of our Society, and a description appeared in the Bulletin
of the British Ornithologist&amp;apos;s Club, vol. xli, p. 115, April, 1921. One
imagines that it has yet to be jiroved whether it is a true species, or
only a glorified variety of L. luteus, but it is significant that a male and
female should be coloured alike.

Sirs, -- I wish to correct a note in the March number of your Magazine
re the Australian Zoological Control Board. The Government has not
prohibited the export of unprotected birds, nor have they given this
business to any individual or officials ; thousands of birds for which
there is an open season are leaving Australia, and many dealers are
sending them out. The various Governments are enforcing the various
Acts for the protection of our native birds, and will not allow rare
protected birds to be sent away as hitherto. It is probable that the
Control Board will be asked to see that such of these birds as are
required for scientific institutions abroad are sent to them under the

Sirs, -- I should esteem it a favour if you could tell me how to
differentiate the sex of the Lucian Conure, as I have some, but cannot
see any difference at all.
I have had very bad luck with rare African Waxbills, every one
that I had from a certain dealer died. Violet-ears, Melbas, Black-
cheeked, Blue-breasted, Dufresnes, etc., and yet a quantity of common
Waxbills that I had from another dealer are all in perfect health,
although all received the same treatment. The former mentioned
seemed in perfect health at first, but after a few weeks seemed to pine
and die away. Do you think that it would be some infection amongst
them ? But, if it were that, you would have thought that the other
ones would have caught it, and succumbed to it, too. I should like to
know what you think about it.

Sirs, -- The recent correspondence about Scarlet Ibis in the Magazine
has prompted me to call attention to the descriptions given of the
White Ibis of South America, in the same genus, as stated in the
Royal Natural History. In vol. iv, p. 319, we read &amp;quot; The last genus
we have space to mention is exclusively American, and comprises the
beautiful Scarlet Ibis (Guam rubra), ranging from Northern South
America to Central America and the West Indies ; and the White
Ibis (G. alba), which is South American . . . Both have the tips of wings
blackish ; the rest of the plumage being scarlet in the one and black
[italics mine] in the other.&amp;quot; The word in italics ought surely to have
been white -- otherwise it would make plumage all-black.
Is not the genus name Eudocimus more in general use than the above

ago I watched two of these attractive-looking birds, both of which made
the cry when excited, the crest raised ; and from the way they hopped
about near each other seemed to me to be male and female. Is there
any external difference in sexes (these two looked the same size) either
in size or plumage ?
In their voices the above species seems to me a contrast to the
Collared Jay Thrush (G. jncticollis) of China, the latter bird being
(according to those seen) remarkably silent. Is this silence of G.
jncticollis due to ones seen by me being probably females ? Or is it
a less noisy species than G. leucolophus ?

<bodyText confidence="0.992028833333333" page_id="9396886"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
Sirs, -- Mr. Portal&amp;apos;s account of his male Cretan Chukor Partridge
assisting in making the nest rather surprises me, as I have had an
extensive experience of the Indian Cliukor at liberty in this country,
and have always found his domestic virtues to be conspicuous by their
absence ; he is a bullying and unfaithful husband, and an even worse
father, for not only does he take no part in looking after the young, but
he will attack the chicks, which the hen tries to keep out of his way.
When the females were accompanied by small young the males, after a
good deal of initial quarrelling and bad language, settled down in small
parties by themselves, and did not rejoin the coveys until the latter
were nearly full grown. It would be interesting to know what share
other cock Red-legged Partridges take in the care of the young, and
also whether the cock Chukor is a better father in India than he is in
Europe ; the fact that he is found with the full-grown covey at the
beginning of the shooting season (as I think I have read in the accounts
of some Indian sportsmen) does not, in itself, prove that he has been
with them all along.

THEORIES ON DISTINGUISHING SEXES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993884428571428" page_id="9396887"  page_num="111" year="" vol="">
Sirs,-- In the Avicultural Magazine, p. 5, Miss Knobel writes
about a female Yellow-fronted Amazon and its affection towards its
mistress, stating : &amp;quot; Yet she was undoubtedly a hen, and this entirely
does away with the theory that male birds like women and females
men.&amp;quot;
Personally I agree with the writer that there is nothing in that theory
as applicable to the Parrot tribe-- there being too many birds which
contradict it by their attitude ; and in this connexion it is amusing
to mention that one bird known to me was on one occasion stated &amp;quot; to
be a male &amp;quot; by a supporter of the theory, and on a later occasion &amp;quot; to
be a female &amp;quot;, he not recognizing that he was being shown the same
bird on the two occasions ! But he never explained the so-called change
of sex ! As the remarks on the Blue-fronted Amazon, pp. 56, 57, were
already sent to the Editors when Miss Knobel&amp;apos;s account appeared, and
its habits towards different human beings were intentionally omitted
(except 1. 11, p. 57) for shortness, it may be of interest to mention
now its usual behaviour towards four people : (1) a woman cousin of
of mine, disliked her very much ; (2) a man, myself, it disliked even
worse than the woman, although neither of us ever teased it, and its
dislike to me was so great that it used to strike at me with beak even
when I brought fruit to it in its cage -- consequently I always kept
at very long arm&amp;apos;s length when it was out of its cage ; (3) with another
man, the butler there, it was the best of friends, always allowed him to
handle it in the cage (except one day in a fit of temper it unexpectedly
bit him on the thumb, but became friendly again later in the day) ;
lastly (4), with the butler who came after he left, the bird was always
friendly. What is the theorist on &amp;quot; the affection-showing-sex-idea&amp;quot;
going to make of the aforementioned facts ? The theory is like a
bucket without a bottom -- &amp;quot; won&amp;apos;t hold water.&amp;quot;
As to the remark : &amp;quot;It is said that a practised eye can easily tell
the sexes when a pair of birds are together,&amp;quot; p. 4, last two lines, the
following scene between two birds of prey now in the Gardens, the
Fishing Eagles (Halicetus leucoryphts) from India, may be worth
mentioning. Soon after their arrival in August, 1920, I watched them
very carefully for some hours to see whether their sex could be

distinguished by their attitude towards each other -- both being (it
seemed to me) in immature plumage ; and both the same size. After
being indifferent to each other, even when quite close, for several
hours, observations extending over several days, a hostile scene
occurred, both Eagles facing each other, the feathers on throat and
neck raised in excitement, eyes glittering and wings partly raised and
ready for flight in attack. Seeing them, then, I think most people,
except, perhaps, specialists like the Editors, would have said they were
the same sex, &amp;quot; because male and female would be less likely to quarrel.&amp;quot;
However, in January, 1921, it seemed to me that one bird was grown
rather larger than the other, and was therefore a female -- smaller being
a male. While on the one side a male and female in birds (and also
mammals) have usually, in my experience, agreed well together, there
have been, on the other side of the subject, cases where a male and
female have disagreed. Therefore it does not seem to me that a hard
and fast dogma can be laid down, which will stand when put to the test
by actual facts in bird (and in mammal also) life.

BIRDS IN THE PARK AT CLERES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971609958333333" page_id="9396889"  page_num="113" year="" vol="">
By J. Delacour
Nothing is more charming than a good many birds of different
sorts, running, swimming, and even flying in a state of semi-liberty,
and I always arrange to have a number as well as some mammals in
the little park of about 40 acres, all fenced by a wire-netting 8 ft. high,
with 2 ft. in the ground. To begin with the largest ones, I have four
Rheas, two white cocks and two grey hens. I had a white hen, which
died last winter in the most peculiar way ; she hit an iron post as she
was running, cut her big artery and bled to death. I was most
distressed over this accident, when H.H. Prince Murat kindly gave me
two grey hens ; he has quite a flock of grey Rheas in his large park of
Chantbly, where they rear their young ones every year in quite a wild
state. One of my white cocks has paired with both hens, and
occasionally chases the other one ; but most of the time he allows him
to stay near the hens and there has never been any serious fight between
them. Two dozen eggs were laid in June, which are now in the
incubator.
I was obliged to put the Emus into an enclosure, as they proved rather
spiteful, especially to the mammals, and also very destructive to plants.
Cranes are, in my opinion, the best ornament to a park. I keep loose
together one cock and two hen Sarus, pairs of Manchurian, White-
necked European, and Blue-crowned Cranes, one Stanley, and a dozen
Demoiselles. So far they all agree very well together, and have not
destroyed any nest in the spring, but I am very much afraid that when

they have more settled down, after several years, and come into
breeding condition, I shall have to separate some pairs to avoid fights
in the spring. They generally keep together, with the exception of the
flock of Demoiselles and the Crowned Cranes, which stay by themselves.
These (&amp;apos;nines do not always keep near the water in which they sleep,
lull go all over the park, and spend a good part of their time on the
higher ground. The cock Saras is full-winged, and it is a beautiful
sighl to watch him flying round and circling, which he does aboul
four times a day. He sometimes disappears and flies very high for as
much as half an hour, but except on one occasion he has never
alighted anywhere hut in the park. As he flies he utters loud call-,
which his wives and the other Cranes answer. Some newly imported
Demoiselles are also left unpinioned, but their feathers have not grown
yet, am! they still are unable to fly. I find my Cranes never touch
the trout, which are abundant in the stream and the lake.
A pair of pinioned Screamers is a good addition to the Waders&amp;apos;
collection. They behave exactly like Geese, and swim a good deal,
looking for their food on the lake like Water-fowl. They are quite
harmless to other birds. They feed on gra ss only, and in winter touch
a little meat mash. Flamingoes are delightful on the river, which is full
of freshwater shrimp and supplies them with excellent food. I was
lucky enough to receive four of them out of a consignment of twenty
sent to the Paris Museum Zoo by the city of Alexandria. My litth
river being rather deep, the Flamingoes very often have to swim, and
behave exactlv like swans when they search for their food under
water.
My Water-fowl were doing splendidly when, last June, an otter got
through a gate on the river, which had been pushed slightly open by
the water, and killed over thirty of my best Ducks, and even my old
breeding female Bar-headed Goose. The amount of damage one otter
can do in one night is extraordinary ; six Ducks and one Goose were
killed and more or less eaten. I have not been able, so far, to shoot or
catch this dreadful brute, but there are now no holes where it can get
through, it never caught a bird unless .swimming on the water.
Fortunately I have a good many young ones which will fill the gaps
in the collection. Among these there are eight wild Muscovies, ten

Bar-headed and Upland Geese, and some other little birds that I cam mi
identify yet.
South American gallinaceous birds, Curassows and Guans, are very
nice at liberty from April to November. In winter they have to be
taken in when it is freezing, as they would loose their tender toes at the
frrsl frost-bite. At the present moment I have three Crested Guan,
delightfully tame little birds, which stay most of the time on the
balustrade of the t rrace, three Yarrels, two Alector, one Prince Albert,
one Razor-billed, and one Salvin&amp;apos;s Razor-bill Curassows. The list
is. 1 believe, quite a rare species, even in skin collections ; it resembles
the common Razor-bill, but has white underparts instead of rufous,
a much smaller bill, and a longer crest. The great tameness of
Curassows allows one to have them full-winged, as they never go away,
at least, with me.
My three pairs of Spicifer and two pairs of White Peafowls keep
each in a corner, and agree rather well. Spicifer cock is very spiteful
to human beings, but not too much to birds.
Monauls, Reeves, and Silver Pheasants. Manchurian Crossoptilons,
Siamese Firebacks, have been very satisfactory at liberty, but 1 had
to shut in Whit. &amp;apos;-crested Kaleeges and Swinhoe&amp;apos;s Pheasants, the cocks
of which were very dangerous to other Pheasants. Amhersts and Golden
have not been very good stayers ; one cock takes the advantage and
driven away the others in the spring. Anyhow, I bred twenty-one
young Amhersts from eggs found in the park, but I don&amp;apos;t think that
more than one cock and four hens are left out of two dozen birds which
1 let out List year and were still here in March.
In . January I opened the door of two small aviaries in the park, where
aboul thirty Senegal Palm and Half-collared Doves had been kept for
three months. They all stayed very well, and scattered through the
park, and in April I began to see young ones everywhere. Australian
Crested Pigeons and common Barbary Doves were also let out in April.
They all stayed very well, but .1 have not, aoticed any young ones yet.
I also tried Parrakeets loos.&amp;apos;, which the Marquess of Tavistock very
kindly gave me. A pair of. Indian Ringnecks and an Alexandrine cock
paired to an African Ringneck hen stayed very well, and have nests.

as far as I can ascertain. A pairof Red-rumpedParrakeets, after having
stayed well for three weeks, disappeared ; a few days before the hen
looked ill ; she probably died and then the cock went away. Of a pair

a strong liking to the railway station, which is just outside the park,

The pair of Black-capped Lories of which I am about to write came

Mrs. M. .1. Burgess Breeding the Black-capped Lory 117
I had a small side aviary built for them in my bird-room, as the cock
was growing too savage to be left in the other aviary. The nesting-
box was very large and heavy, and for safety I placed it on the floor
just for the pair to sleep in, which&amp;quot; they always did.
On 2nd April of the present year 1 saw an egg just outside the box,
so I placed it inside, but the hen did not seem to sit, and I thought they
had destroyed it. On -1th May I saw another egg, and from that date
the hen sat firmly, only coming off for food. Meanwhile, the cock
defended the box and at times he was so savage that it was hardly
safe to place food into the cage. He always slept in the box. He con-
tinued to take his bath as usual ; they are great bathers, not just tossing
the water over themselves, but rolling over and over in it until they
look drowned, and this takes place twice a day.
On 8th June a young bird was seen which was judged to be about
ten days old, it was covered with down of a golden colour, and looked
about the size of a. day-old chicken. On 28th June another baby was
seen ; in fact, we saw the two together, and I think there is a third, as
a third egg was seen on 8th June by the side of the first chick, and the
shell of this was thrown out on 23rd June. The hen is hardly ever out
of the box, although she now comes out to bathe again, and, strange to
say, she is as perfect in feather as she was on the day she was shown at
Newport, in spite of the fact that she has been sitting and rearing a
brood. They now eat quite double the quantity of food that they did
when they only had themselves to sustain, soft food and fruit being
all that they take.
On the evening of 2nd July one baby came out of the box as I
passed, and it was the funniest mite. On the head was a clearly marked
black-cap, and the half-grown wing-feathers were brownish or greenish,
I could hardly say which. The breast feathers were like quills, but there
were no bright colours visible. The beak looked strong, and the little
fellow used quite strong language at me and appeared to have a temper
like that of his father. Tie was not beautiful, but sturdy and about the
size of my White-rumped Lory. I do not know whether its parents or
myself are most proud of this achievement. 1 should say the young
bird is about two months old.
On the morning of 28th July the bird came out again, a, big.

<bodyText confidence="0.979011173913043" page_id="9396894"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
By Major Maurice Portal, D.S.O.
In the early summer of 1920 Col. R. Meinertzhagen kindly brought
me from Crete a pair of Caccabis saxatilis ; they were tame and only
had a few feathers cut from one wing. They were pinioned permanently
in July, as they began to fly on to the top of the garden wall. They were
very tame with the gardener, and used to remain quite near him when
at work. The cock being always rather more shy than the hen, but in
bad weather both used to come into the potting shed and sit on the
flower-pots while work was going on, and roosted there at night.
Beyond water and a handful of wheat they required no attention.
About the beginning of March they showed signs of pairing, and
spent most of the day walking about together inspecting possible
nesting sites, and finally selected the root of an old fig-tree. The hen
scraped a round hole and the cock brought her a straw in his beak,
running round and round and finally throwing it over his back, when
she picked it up and put -it in the nest, which finally was roughly lined
with straw and dead leaves. A spell of warm weather brought on an
old rhubarb plant, some 30 yards off, and on the 25th of March they
spent all the day near it, and next day scraped out another
nest under a leaf, making free use of the straw already there, and only
adding dead leaves.
On 15th April there were ten eggs in this nest, dirty white in colour,
with faint spots of brown, and as we had 10 degrees of frost I took

five of them and replaced them with dummy eggs. The hen came and
looked and called the cock from the end of the garden and the pair
went straight away together and scraped a hole under a plant of
brussel-sprouts, 50 yards off, putting in only a few bits of dead weed,
and [aid one egg the same day. 1 took the other five of the firsl ne I
She laid fourteen eggs in the second nest, which was deep and eggs
were piled on each other. I removed the top four with a spoon, but
the hen came and looked, and again called the cock, and went off.
That afternoon it was cold and dull and they came into the potting-
shed and made a scrape in the soil by the gardener&amp;apos;s feet as he worked,
and laid one egg in it under the potting-bench. They had for the first
time suddenly shown a fondness for seed-beds, and had cleared a bed
of seedling lettuce, onions, and something else, so I roughly enclosed
some grass outside where the beediives were, and the gardener opened
the garden door and they went to their new home. A few days later
a new nest was made under a dock, and finally fifteen eggs were laid.
Incubation commenced about 23rd May, and twelve hatched about
6th June. The enclosure was suitable owing to ants&amp;apos; nests and shelter
from a wall, so the gardener only fed on seeds and gave water. The
young were always bad to see and worse to catch, as, if frightened at all,
they squatted and did not move a fraction. The cock always seemed
to be with them, except once when both were with them on the border.
The cock was chiefly noticed on the nest during incubation, but we
never went oftener than once a day. I had to go to London on business
mi 0th July, when the chicks were three weeks old, and returned on
9th duly to see ten flying some 200 yar Is in a flight and over garden
walls and tree-tops.
Eaines, I tie gardener, to whom ail credit of success is due, as he has
had sole care of them, informed me that on 6th July he had gone to
look at a hive of bees and saw the hen Chukor with seven or eight young
not two days old. I regret 1 cannot be positive that I saw her on the
nest which hatched the twelve, and can only assume tha&amp;apos; the cock
did uearly all the incubation, and the ten started a new and fourth
oest, which up to date I have not found in the grass, so I do not know
how many eggs she laid in it. The ten young alive of the third nest
are always with the cock-, and he keeps them away from the In o and

her younger lot, but should he meet these he attacks at once. This
gives the following number of eggs : --
On 15th April : 10 eggs laid, 9 fertile and hatched under Bantam.
On 3rd May : 15 eggs laid (14 in nest and one in potting-shed),
all fertile.
By 23rd May : a Chukor was sitting on 15 eggs, all fertile (but 3 left
in nest), hatched about 12th June.
On 6th July : the hen found with 7 or 8 young birds a day or so
old.
If the Chukor in Crete make a habit of laying like this the breed
should not become extinct, as, at the least, this is forty-seven or forty-
eight eggs laid and of these only one was unfertile.
The birds with their parents develop quickest, and are strongest,
but it should be remembered that they have had no cold weather, and
lots of ant heaps. My birds under Bantams did badly until allowed com-
plete freedom of range, and then the usual losses started ; a bird got
in a ditch ; a dog frightened the lot one day, and they ran and flew
in every direction, three never came back, two got trodden on, etc. I
fed on hard-boiled egg and dry chick-feed ; later small seeds from the
threshing machine, which contained very small wheat and much dirt,
but at 10s. ewt. was well worth it, and better than dry chick-feed.
I added oatmeal if they did not feed up well, and ants&amp;apos; nests when I
could dig them -- for the latter they will eat out of my hand.
The young arc very shy if you move, and have a bad habit of running
a long way and squatting until the hen calls. Cold rain or cold wind
they dislike, unless under the lee of something. They drink freely at
night, but rarely in the day-time, and when they do drink do so for
some minutes.
The young will walk up anything like a post or log resting up against
the netting and are always trying to get out, and having accomplished
this they at once try to get back again. They develop faster than
Red-leg Partridges, and fly much earlier on -in life ; the call is somewhat
like that of the Ked-leg (C. rufa), and if a mound of logs is built in the
enclosure they will soon be on the top calling, flying down into the
grass at the least disturbance and five minutes later up on the top again-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991720846153846" page_id="9396899"  page_num="121" year="" vol="">
For the opportunity to publish the beautiful coloured plate
illustrating this number of the Avicultural Magazine we are indebted
to our distinguished and esteemed member, Monsieur J. Delacour,
who has kindly placed it at our disposal under circumstances already
explained in an earlier issue of the Magazine. It represents Verreaux&amp;apos;s
Glossy Starling (Pholidauges verreauxi), a rare and beautiful bird
apparently comparatively recently imported to Europe for the first
time. A short note about the species was published by Mr. Seth-Smith
in our Magazine last February on the occasion of the presentation of
a specimen to the Zoological Society by Mr. Harold Miller, the
Superintendent of the Zoological Gardens, Durban.
With the admirable plate before us it is needless to describe the
bird. It is needless, too, to enter into the question as to whether it
should rank as a distinct species or merely as a local race or sub-
species of its northern and better-known relative, the White-bellied
Glossy Starling {Pholidauges leucogaster), a representative of which
was presented to the Zoological Society for the first time in 1906 by
Dr. Ilopkinson, D.S.O., who brought it from the Gambian Province of
Wesl Africa.
Verreaux&amp;apos;s Glossy Starling does not apparently occur in Cape
Colony ; but on the western side of Africa it ranges from Damaraland
fco the Congo, where it meets the White-bellied Glossy Starling, and
on the cast .&amp;apos;in side it goes as far north as Zanzibar, its southern limit
being Natal, Zululand, and the Transvaal. In the southern districts
of its range, at all events, it is migratory to a certain extent. In
Damaraland, for example, the species arrives on the approach of the

rainy season, but gradually leaves as the country dries up, a few
only staying behind to pick up a precarious living. Similarly the bird
is by no means rare in Natal in the autumn and winter, when it may
be seen almost invariably in flocks, consisting entirely of either male
or female birds. Towards spring they appear to migrate to the north,
although in that province apparently, as in the Transvaal, some
individuals are resident throughout the year. These facts point to
tropical Africa as the original home of the species.
Their food consists principally of berries and other small fruit
and insects, particularly the flying termites, which are captured on
the wing. The nest is made in holes in trees or other natural hollows,
which are lined with wool and feathers, over which green leaves,
periodically renewed, are placed. The usual number of eggs is four.

Mr. J. D. La Touche, who has recently returned from Yunnan, kindly
brought for the Zoological Society two birds, which have certainly
never previously been exhibited in the Gardens, and have probably
never before been imported to Europe alive. One is the so-called
Finch-billed Bulbul (Spizixus canifrons), which earns its trivial name
from its short, thick, almost shrike-like bill, very different from that
of the typical Bulbuls. It is, indeed, very doubtful if the bird is in
reality a Bulbul, although commonly classified with them. Mr. E. W.
Gates suggests that its position will probably be found hereafter to be
among the Sibias and White-eyes. The crest on the head is long and
thick, and the nostrils are partially concealed by small feathers.
Three species only appear to be known, two of them inhabiting China,
while the third, the one under notice, occurs in Yunnan and the hills
of Assam. It has the forehead and front part of the crown ashy-
grey -- whence the name canifrons -- the rest of the crown and lores
black, the cheeks blackish with greyish-white tips to the feathers ;
the ear coverts pale-brown ; sides of the neck streaked with black ;
throat very dark brown : upper plumage and wing coverts green ;
the wings dark brown, with the outer webs greenish-yellow ; the
tail also is greenish-yellow, with the tip black ; the underside yellow

or yellowish. Nothing appears to be known of the habits of this
interesting bird to explain the powerfully developed bill.
The other bird represents the species called by Oates the White-
winged Myna (Sturnia nemoricoh,), which he records from Pegu and
Tenasserim. It is closely allied to the common Malabar Myna (Sturnia
or Paliopsar malaharica), but differs principally in having the winglet,
or bastard wing, and the primary wing-coverts entirely or in part
white in the newly moulted adult instead of black. The two species,
however, appear to be very much alike when immature, and even
after reaching maturity, when the plumage is faded and worn. It nests
at the same time of the year, that is to say, in May and June, as the
Malabar Myna, and has similar eggs.
Mv. La Touche also sent to the Zoological Society at the same
time an example of the Great Eagle Owl, which he tells me in his
letter he believes to be the representative of an undescribed local race.

Mr. Meade Waldo says : ; &amp;apos; I know the Marsh Owl well. I lived for
years close to the wild ones in Morocco, but never managed to get a
living bird. They nest in the wettest part of the great marshes late
in the summer, when it is very hot, and the whole country a mass of
mosquitoes. They are diurnal, very strong on the wing, catch fish and
frogs, also voles, young ducks, etc. I have never seen one in the
market, and I never shot one, though I often could have done so ;
it looks a big bird on the wing ... It occurs sparingly in the South
of .Spain. The Marsh Owl does not hoot, it gives a loud &amp;quot; squack &amp;quot;.
It prefers far wetter ground than the Short-eared Owl and you never
see it anywhere else.&amp;quot;

The name of Professor Newton has long been and will long remain
a household word amongst ornithologists, not only in this country, but
throughout the world, for he was one of the leading ornithologists of
his time and his work will remain a model of what ornithological
investigation and literature should be. His Dictionary of Birds alone is
a masterpiece, every page testifying to the great knowledge and careful
work of its author and containing a mine of information. For upwards
of fifty years Alfred Newton held the chair of Zoology and Comparative

is due the fact that quite a number of brilliant ornithologists were
produced from Cambridge during that period. It is very fitting that
one of these pupils of his should have been chosen to write the story
of his life, which has just been published. There has been a good deal
of delay in producing the volume, for Newton died in 1907, but
Dr. Wollaston, himself an eminent naturalist, has during the interval
been engaged for a period of years in exploration work in New Guinea
and elsewhere, not to mention the further delay caused by the great
upheaval of the war, in which Ids services were required in other
directions. But now that the book has appeared, it is well worth the
wailing for, and ornithologists in common with others will find very
much of interest in its pages.
Newton made it his habit to keep practically every letter he received,
and apparently many of his correspondents kept the letters they received
from him, so that his biographer has been able to publish a large
number of the most important out of some thousands of these letters,
and these give perhaps a better insight into his life and character than
could otherwise have been obtained. Every chapteT is of absorbing
interest, whether it relates to the Great Auk and his visit to its former
breeding places, to Darwinism, or the founding of the B.O.U. and the
Ibis in Newton&amp;apos;s rooms at Cambridge. In every chapter we obtain
an insight into the character of one who was of the best type of English
gentleman of the mid- Victorian period, a man of the most upright
principles, of strong opinions, and a staunch conservative who hated
what he regarded as new-fangled ideas, such as the creation of suit-
species and the employment of trinomials in nomenclature, though,
surely, had he lived long enough, he would have come to recognize
the necessity of these. In spite of his dislike of new ideas, he was one of
the first to recognize and approve of the views of Darwin.
Professor Newton was an Honorary Member of the Avicultural
Society, and the present writer cherishes a letter written by him in
reply to an invitation to become an honorary member. It is in the
Professor&amp;apos;s usual courteous style, and expresses appreciation of the
work achieved by the Society and what he describes as the honour
it was proposed to confer upon him.

Apart from the usual notes upon the habits and local occurrence
of British birds, the two last numbers of this periodical contain three
particularly interesting articles upon &amp;quot; Nesting Rmged Plovers &amp;quot;, by
T. Leslie Smith, illustrated by five photographs ; upon &amp;quot; Diving Ducks
on the Coast of Western Canada &amp;quot;, by C. E. Alford ; and upon &amp;quot; The
Little Tern and its Youna &amp;quot;, by J. X. Douglas Smith, who assisted
ais brother in his observations upon the Ringed Plover in the article
already mentioned. Mr. Alford&amp;apos;s article upon diving Ducks deals
principally with the Harlequin, Golden-eye, and Red-breasted
Merganser. The courtship of the Golden-eye is very amusingly
described, and the record of the manner in which the Gulls of the
district, principally the Glaucous-winged Gull [Larus glaucescens),
watch for the rising Ducks to cob them of their captured prey, as told
in the July number, is indep ndently confirmed in the August issue by
.All&amp;apos;. Theed Pearse, writing from Courtney, Vancouver. In this number
also .Mr. Eugh S. Gladstone raises the interesting question of the date
of the introduction of the Ring-necked Pheasant into Western Europe.

until the mil of the eighteenth century. Nevertheless, a, Flemish

By The Marquess op Tavistock
It is one of the most obvious and well-known facts in the world
that no two human beings are exactly alike, and while one could
hardly venture to assert that no two beasts or birds are exactly alike,
the fascination of keeping animals in captivity and of studying them
in a wild state consists largely in observing the difference in character
and disposition between individuals of the same species. Nine hundred
and ninety-nine may display the same trait, and yet there is always
the chance that the thousandth may be a most striking exception to
the ride.
All who have kept large ruminants know that it is a certainty that
an adult male Deer of any species will be exceedingly dangerous in the
breeding season, if he has lost his fear of man, yet there is one authentic
ncord of a Eed Stag -- and a master Stag, too-- who could be safely
bandied by his owner at all times of year, and there is also a record
of an equally amiable Fallow Buck. What is true of mammals is
equally true of birds ; most owners of large collections of Cranes and
waterfowl can supply instances of individual wild Geese which have
developed an intense and quite unreciprocated passion for individual
Cranes. 1 can remember a Brent Goose which fell in love with a
Whooping Crane and a Ross&amp;apos; Snow Goo.se which attached itself to a
pair of Sarus. It is not the normal habit of Geese to take an interest
in Cranes, but there is a certain type of Goose mentality to which a
Crane makes an irresistible appeal : how interesting it would be to
know why ! Cranes, also, may be the victims of an abnormal and

unrequited affection. I once knew a female Common Crane who
attached herself to a breeding pair of Sarus ; she did not want to
oust the hen Sarus from the affections of her mate ; she just wanted
to live with the two. The Sarus were bored by her company and
frequently told her so, but she was impervious to hints, even delivered
at the point of the beak ! When the Sarus made a nest she proceeded
to lay an egg in it, which she incubated whenever the Sarus would
let her, for, with the strange lunacy of birds in such matters, they
adopted the egg and laid none of their own. Finally we removed the
Common Crane and her egg, and the Sarus made another nest, laid,
and brought up a family.
Then, too, I once owned a Yellow-bellied Parrakeet, whose domestic
life and morals were for the whole of one summer a public scandal.
One of the leading characteristics of the entire broad -tail family is
the strict and lasting fidelity of the male bird to his mate, a fidelity
which is at once an example and reproach to the nudes of certain other
bipeds -- notably humans and ducks. But this particular yellow-belly
was a most notorious exception to the general rule. He lived at liberty
and being without a mate of his own kind he paired with a female
Port Adelaide -- a closely related species. When spring came round
the Adelaide nested in a hollow tree, and according to the usual custom
of her family disappeared from view. A few days later, to my surprise
and disappointment, I saw the yellow-belly courting a hen Blue-bonnet
that I had just turned out in an enclosure with a cut wing. This
appeared to point to but one conclusion -- the Adelaide was dead and
the yellow-belly a widower. Not long afterwards, however, we saw
the Adelaide and we realized that we were dealing with a confirmed
rake. The yellow-belly never fed his sitting wife but spent all his
time with the Blue-bonnet, in spite of the fact that she gave him no
encouragement. The poor Adelaide carried on fairly well until the
young hatched, when the unnatural strain proved too much for
her, and like the heroine of an early Victorian novel, she fell into decline
and died and her unhappy family perished with her. The tragedy
caused the yellow-belly no concern ; he had already persuaded a hen
Rosella to marry him, but when she went to nest he deserted her for
a newly imported Brown&amp;apos;s, and ended the season by marrying a young

Adelaide-- a bird of the year ; it is only fair to him to add that next
season he lived a fairly reputable life, and even brought up a child of
his own. Then came the war ; the birds were neglected and the
yellow-belly and others disappeared -- so I cannot say whether the
reformation would have been lasting.
At present in my collection I have another bird of abnormal
character -- a cock Redrump. I have had many Redrumps -- including
several pairs at liberty. The cocks, without exception, have been
faithful and devoted husbands and very good stayers, but if ever
a hen Redrump met with a fatal accident her mate, after a few days
of anxious, fruitless calling, invariably departed and was never heard
of again alive. I therefore learned this lesson- if you lose one of a
pair of Redrumps at any time of the year replace it at once or else
catch up the survivor. Last year I bought a cock Redrump as a mate
for a hen that seemed anxious to nest. He was rather fat and &amp;quot; soft&amp;quot;
when lie arrived and did not seem particularly interested in the nest-
box, but he settled down before long and eggs were laid in due course.
About this time a hen Blue-bonnet in another aviary laid three eggs
and then got ill, and I put the eggs in the Redrump&amp;apos;s nest along with their
own. The Redrump&amp;apos;s eggs all proved clear, but the Blue-bonnet&amp;apos;s
hatched. One youngster died in the nest, the others flew, and the cock
Redrump showed himself a most devoted foster-father. But about
this time I noticed he was becoming exceedingly short with his wife --
in fact, he would hardly allow her to come out of the nest-box. The
hen Redrump, however, made the best of a bad job, by laying another
clutch, which, like the first, proved clear. After that I took the nest-
box away, and soon afterwards gave the entire family -- reduced to
three by the death of another Blue-bonnet -- their liberty. From that
time onward the cock Redrump would have nothing more to do with
the hen and associated entirely with his adopted daughter, and if the
hen Redrump tried to join them she was promptly driven away. At
the beginning of winter I broke up the alliance by sending both Red-
rumps to an aviary in the Isle of Wight. Here, apparently, the cock-
became reconciled to his first mate, but when nesting-time came she
unluckily died egg-bound. Some little time later I had him sent back
to me and turned him into the aviary where he had nested the year

before, providing him with a new lien. He was very much in breeding
condition and far more fit than in the previous spring, but lie was by
no means gracious to the fresh arrival, and a little inclined to bully her.
When they seemed on more friendly terms I released them, but the
cock took no trouble to keep in touch with his partner, and being rather
a wild bird she strayed and was lost. There was, at that time, an
unmated hen Blue-bonnet in one of the aviaries, but the Redrump
took no interest in her, and as lie was calling and displaying all day
long I feared he would leave, and caught him on the trap feeding-
tray and put him into his aviary again ; a few minutes later I saw him
making his exit ; we had forgotten to tack up the hole through which
the pair had been released ! After that I left him to his own devices
and tried to procure a third female. Every day I expected to find him
gone, but days became weeks and weeks months, and still he
stayed ; he spent nearly all his time in a neighbouring garden, amusing
himself by chasing sparrows -- an unusual pastime, for parrakeets at
liberty absolutely ignore small birds, as indeed they also do when
properly kept in big aviaries ; if a parrakeet is dangerous with finches,
in nine cases out of ten the owner is originally to blame for bad manage-
ment. At last the ben arrived and I turned her into an aviary. The
cock absolutely ignored her, and it was plain that a bachelor existence
entirely satisfied him. After a considerable time I turned her out
and she has stayed all right, but as a pair they are a failure -- he goes
one way and she goes another. They do not quarrel when they meet,
but, rather to my surprise, she proves to be the master. I wonder
what, will happen when spring comes round again -- will the hermit
relent or will he continue his sparrow-hunting 1
Though a less marked possessor of individual peculiarities, a cock
Brown&amp;apos;s Parrakeet has sufficient character to vex me and send my
best-laid breeding schemes agley. He is a rather old bird, and in
an aviary a failure at producing a family, so this spring I gave him
and his mate their liberty ; he was much attached to the latter, but
tragedy was in store, for while prospecting for a nest she descended
a chimney and starved to death in the unoccupied room below, through
the carelessness of my servants, who had been specially warned of
this danger. I obtained another hen, but although she stayed well

and the two were quite friendly , it was evident, as time went on, that
there was something not quite right. Though often together, they
were also often apart, and the cock Brown&amp;apos;s did not display that
pugnacity towards other Parrakeets which is usually associated with an
entirely happy marriage. They did, indeed, do a little house-hunting
in a perfunctory sort of way, and the hen tried to repeat her pre-
decessor&amp;apos;s exploit, but was rescued in time. There was an unmated
cock Brown&amp;apos;s in one of the aviaries in whom the hen began to take
more and more interest, but the final breach came w T hen a cock Yellow r -
mantle died or disappeared, leaving a widow and family. A very
short time later the cock Brown&amp;apos;s married her and took over the care
of her brood, and from that time on he not only ignored the hen but
drove her away when she came near. Fate, however, has interposed.
I have caught up and removed the Rosellas and given the aviary
Brown&amp;apos;s a mate. So the old cock has returned to his first partner
with a very ill grace, for there is no getting away from it,
temperamentally they don&amp;apos;t suit each other-- again, why ?

require a detailed description of its plumage to be given here, but
roughly it differs from the Pope Cardinal, its nearest imported relative,
by its smaller size, black instead of carmine throat, and darker back.
A full description, together with an excellent plate, appears in
Dr. Butler&amp;apos;s Foreign Finches in Captivity, p. Q8. The sexes, according
to this author, are alike, but I have no difficulty whatever in fixing the
sex difference so far as my pair are concerned, though whether or no
these distinctions are constant I cannot say. In my birds the hen is
very slightly but quite noticeably smaller and slimmer; the white of
the underparts is also of a much purer colour in the cock.

134 Capt. G.Battigan -- Nesting Notes on the Yellow -billed Cardinal
On having nest the plumage is roughly as follows : Above, greyish;
the feathers of the back tipped light brown ; head, dark greyish-
brown ; sides of head, rufous ; throat, same colour, but of a paler,
more washed-out tint, a sort of fawn which extends slightly into the
breast ; sides of neck, pure white, tapering to the nape, where it
merges into the greyish-brown of the back ; wing coverts and tail
feathers, black ; feet, light brown ; bill, upper mandible, blackish-
brown, under, light horn colour ; the thighs show no trace of the black
of the adult.
Clutch. -- Three. Eggs olive-green, densely streaked with dark
(amber) brown. Size appears to be about the same as that of the
Red-crested Cardinal, and large for the size of the bird.
Nest. -- Very compact and strongly made, and composed of the
wing twigs of the maidenhair bush, lined with a little fine grass and
pampas grass. The nest exactly resembles that of the Red-crest&amp;apos;s
built in the same aviary, and is composed of practically the same
materials, save that the Red-crests added a little cow-hair as an inner
lining, but it is much more strongly and compactly put together.
Incubation period thirteen days, and young left nest in thirteen days.
Fending for itself.-- Commenced to pick up tit-bits on its own on
the eleventh day after quitting the nest, and was entirely on its own
two days later. Commenced to eat coached hemp and sunflower seeds
fifteen days after leaving the nest, and was actually singing on the
3rd July, or twenty-three days from leaving the nest.
Song. -- The song of these birds I find quite pleasing, but very weak
and low, and whilst the hen was incubating the cock frequently regaled
her with what might be termed a &amp;quot; whisper &amp;quot; song. This song was
sometimes quite inaudible, to human ears at any rate, but was accom-
panied by a rather envious display, during which the cock raises the red
feathers at the crown of the head, and spreads out the feathers of the
tail like a fan. Incidentally I note that Butler, in the work already
referred to, states that this bird cannot raise the red feathering on the
head at will. This is, however, incorrect, for the cocks, at any rate,
can and frequently do raise these feathers when excited. The young
bird, which is very tame, often displays to me in this way, generally
after lie has had his ration of mealworms, and I have no doubt it

forms part of the ordinary sexual display. While I consider this
species to he quite the most charming and attractive of the Cardinals,
I find it extremely pugnacious for its size, especially as might be
expected when. breeding. It is fond, like its larger relative the Red-
crest, of hotly pursuing smaller and weaker birds, whose every twist
and turn it will follow, being very rapid and dexterious on the wing.
I believe this practice is indulged in more for the sport of the thing
and as a form of exercise than anything else, but still I personally would
not dream of confining the species with any of the smaller Finches or
Waxbills. It agrees quite well with the Red-crested and Green
Cardinals, which mostly ignore it, but in my experience cannot be
safely enclosed with Pope Cardinals.
Rearing. -- For the first three days the young birds were fed entirely
upon a diet of green fly, long-legged spiders, and small caterpillars.
After this the menu was gradually modified, until after the first week
they were entirely on a diet of hard-boiled egg and tea-biscuit,
supplemented with a few mealworms supplied every three hours
throughout the day. It would, however, be probably possible to
raise them entirely on the latter diet if supplied with discretion. In
my experience the most dangerous period for young birds (insectivorous)
is just after they have left the nest, when they almost always seem to
be attacked by diarrhoea in a greater or lesser degree. Why this
should be so is a mystery to me, but I have found that powdered
cuttle-fish sprinkled over the egg-food tends to lessen the danger.
This idea was given to me some years back by my Red-vented Bulbuls,
which T noticed always used to give cuttle-fish liberally to their young,
when the latter were about 6 or 7 days old, and these birds
hardlv ever lost a chick.

(Senegambia to Angola), Equatorial, and Mast Africa. The Gambia
must be very near the northern limit of its western range, and here

it is certainly more common to the south than to the north of the river,
and apparently never extends more than, say, 40 or 50 miles inland.
Even in Kombo, where it is more or less plentiful, it is a very local
bird, and never found far from the mangroves.
After an interval of a good many years I have once more got one
of these birds, caught in Niumi at a place called Tubab Kolong, almost
on the same day and almost on the same spot where I saw my first
Niumi bird thirteen years ago. I have looked up my old diaries and
the notes I used to keep in former years on my birds, when T had more
time, and also, I suppose, more inclination. These give certain details
about these birds both in wild life and captivity, which may be of
interest. One thing they seem to show is that the date at which the
males come into colour varies with the age of the bird (as observation
abroad also seems to indicate), and that this change may be delayed
(and sometimes perhaps advanced) by various causes, such as captivity
or the change from freedom to captivity.
I will commence with extracts from my old Gambia bird-diaries :--
1902. June. Have five among the three cages of small birds I am
taking home. One has yellow shoulders and jdark wings,
the others are quite off colour, and look like large out-of-
colour Bishops, but have a more greenish tinge than these,
I had one other cock with more yellow, but it died within
twenty-four hours. They were all caught in Kombo close to
Bathurst.
1906. Jan. I think 1 found old nests of this bird in the swamp at
Nianimaru. (1919. No. I now know that the nests were those
oj the Crimson-crowned Bishop.)
1907. May 27. Near the Cape (Kombo) I saw a nearly black bird
with yellow shoulder-patches attended by two uncoloured
blackish birds ; they were the size of a &amp;quot; Kaffir Finch &amp;quot;, which
at first I thought they were, and later Caterpillar-catchers
(which I only know from descriptions).
June 18. Saw another at Tuba-Kolong in Niumi ; very like the
first bird, but not so much black.
June 25. Essau, Niumi. Saw another, half black and with
shoulders (not back), yellow. No long tail. I think these must

be Pyromelana. {&amp;apos;. Have we a &amp;quot;Kaffir Finch&amp;quot;, P. capensis,
here ?)
1908. July. Saw definite Y.B. Whydahs occasionally near Bakau
(Niumi).
1909. May 11. Gunjur. Saw a single bird exactly like the 1907
birds. Half colour (general weaver-look and black like a
Bishop), and with the yellow confined to the shoulder ; back
still speckly. Cot quite close to this bird.
May 15. Kartong (southern border of Kombo). Saw several
more of these birds in the dry, now quite sandy, rice-fields.
Tails do not seem long enough for Yellow-backed Whydahs ;
they suggest to me the Urobrachya plate in the B.M. catalogue,
but the shoulder-patch is a bright gold yellow. During the
next few days I remained at Kartong and saw plenty of these
birds on the rice-fields or the dry sandy flats covered with
coarse grass and low straggly thorns, behind the mangroves
along the Allahin River. Here they were feeding on the. ground
with other Weavers and Waxbills, in pairs, or more commonly
in threes, one showing yellow and black, the other two in
brown plumage and presumably hens. They were very tame
for Weaver birds and only flew at one&amp;apos;s close approach, and then
only to the nearest bush, returning at once to the feeding-place
as we moved on. The males were about half-coloured (I saw
none in full colour), and the yellow was entirely confined to the
shoulders.
1916. August. Yellow-backed Whydahs quite common at the Cape
during the rains. They nest in the rough grass among the
mangroves which border the numerous creeks. At this season
one sees the males very commonly, but the females rarely.
1 think that there is usually only one wife, but occasionally
I feel sure that one male (perhaps a cocksure young one) has two
establishments to look after. There is no nesting in company
like the Bishops, and I have never seen one male driving another
as is so common among the Crimson-crowned Bishops, which
nest in much the same places, but in larger numbers, so that the
males are continually coming Into collision with each other over
fancied trespasses.

138 Dr. E. Hopkinson--The Yellow-backed Whydah
I know now that the Gnnjnr birds were these Whydahs and
that the yellow always commences on the shoulders, the hack
colour coming very late. This year I was able to watch the
complete change from half-colour in June to full colour (in
most) by the end of July. A few, however, though obviously
nesting, were neither completely black nor yellow-backed even
in August.
About 1910 I had thirty-six of these birds, mostly cocks
in half colour. They were all in one cage, and had all been
caught in Kombo. T only got them a few days before sailing
for home (end of July). The luggage was loaded into a lighter
to go off to the steamer, the birds among them -- a tornado,
the whole covered with a tarpaulin, so thoroughly that all the
live-stock was suffocated. A great catastrophe. I should have
liked to get home three dozen Yellow-backed Whydahs.
1918. These Whydahs are quite common in Kombo during the rains,
and odd ones may be seen all the year round. Nearly all the
males keep the yellow shoulders all the year round. On the
Cape road one sees them in full colour from the end of July
to about October. They never appear to like to stray far
from mangroves, and at the end of the dry season seem content
with brackish water for drinking, like our &amp;quot; Black Pigeons &amp;quot;.
In Niumi they also breed, but are certainly less common
there than in Kombo.
1921. Tubab Kolong. June 17. Caught one half-colour cock, and
saw a few others. Shoulders yellow, a few speckles of black
below and wing feathers dark. Brought him home. Now
(July 26) the throat is black and the black speckles are in-
increasing in size everywhere. The wildest bird of this kind
I have ever had.
So much for the wild life ; the remaining notes refer to
those. I have kept : --

they moulted ?)
Sept. 20. No. 1 now in full colour. A handsome but not very
lively bird ; very keen on insects, thus differing from the
Paradise Whydahs and resembling the Bishops. Has looked
rather bad at times, but now that he is in full colour seems
better.
The others I am nearly sure are young cocks. No. 5 is
growing a long tail, but shows no sign of either black or yellow,
and I have seen two of the others &amp;quot; sing &amp;quot; ; they also seem to
be getting a bit speckly about the face.
Oct. 12. No. 1 still in aviary and in full colour. All tail-feathers
now of the same length, at first the two middle ones were the
longest.
Nov. 12. No. 1 still full colour and in perfect condition. Nos. 2
and 3 are now at Oxford.
All both sing and dance like Bishops, and are rather quarrel-
some, especially with each other.
Nov. 20. No. 1 found insensible and moribund on the floor of
the aviary after a very cold night. Brought indoors to the fire
and given brandy ; to everyone&amp;apos;s surprise recovered. Kept
indoors in cage to himself.
Dec. 11. In No. 2 (Oxford) one yellow feather has appeared on
one shoulder. Have not felt the intense cold, though we have
had 10 to 15 degrees of frost.
Dec. 18. A few yellow feathers on each shoulder now of No. 2.
Does not look quite so fit. Very keen on mealworms.
Dec. 24. No. 1 still indoors. Full colour, perfect condition. All
black with brown edges to flights ; the yellow extends over
whole upper back and shoulders.
Nos. 4 and 5 still in Brighton aviary ; yellow showing on
thr shoulders of both and in one the wings are getting black.

Had there been others I do not think it would have been safe
to turn him out as he is very spiteful with other Whydahs, but
inoffensive to smaller birds.

shoulders still yellow. All tail lost now ; there are now only
a few short feathers, the new tail.
May 13. Hardly more than a speck of yellow now showing on
each shoulder, but he has grown a new tail, a brown one. Is
now, I suppose, in complete out-of-colour plumage. Very fit.

still a few brown feathers among the yellow on back.

Whydahs, but apparently no harm done.

and almost &amp;quot; light &amp;quot;). Brandy and castor-oil ; fire. Revived
and in the afternoon ate a spider.

All the above birds and nearly all the others I have had turned
out to be males. In freedom, too, the females seem much more retiring
than the males, and less often seen than the males, even if every
allowance is made for the absence of colour.
Query, is there any simple reason which can account for so many
more males than females being caught ?
There is as yet no record of this bird having been bred in captivity.
In Butler&amp;apos;s Foreign Finches is a good coloured plate, at least of the
male, though that of the hen does not attract.
Other coloured figures are given by Puss (Fremdlandischen Slubcn-
vogel, i, 218) and Peichenbach (Singvogel, pi. 27).

A QUEENSLAND HUSH MYSTERY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.958533157894737" page_id="9396921"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
A weird &amp;apos;* moo-moo &amp;quot; sound, more subdued than that of a cow
or calf, is often heard at night-time in the Queensland bush, and there
are wide differences of opinion, even among bushmen, as to the source of
the sound, which is regarded by many with superstitious awe. A
recenl controversy in the North Queensland Register, of Townsville,
dors not seem to have completely solved the mystery, though it has
nanowed down the sound to one emanating from some member of
the animal creation. Some say snakes, others owls, and others again
mopokes, rats, porcupines, or quails. The balance of opinion is in
favour of a light-grey variety of quail, which usually haunts rosewood
scrub. Yet a naturalist whose word carries weight in Queensland
writes : --
&amp;quot; The quail&amp;apos;s call note is easily recognizable, but the forest night
noise is different and a much lower sound, repeated more rapidly
than the quail&amp;apos;s call. You may approach the night noise stealthily,
and then fire a gun or make a noise that would scare away any bird ;
then retreat quietly, and the noise commences again in the same place,
&amp;quot; 31 M M &amp;quot;. Many people of the bush make pets of quails, and their
note is well known.&amp;quot;

Sirs, -- On a small natural garden pond here close to the house
a pair of Moorhens hatch and rear two or three broods annually. As
they are fearless but independent their habits can be easily watched.
This year, as usual, they have two broods, the three survivors of
the first brood being now (27th July) full grown. There is a second
brood of which four survive about three weeks old, being still in the
completely black downy stage. Natural food being extremely scarce
owing to the drought, and not a blade of green grass (their principal
food) existing, we feed them twice a day by throwing broken bread, etc.,
on the water-lily leaves. The family, consisting of nine birds, come

one another ! The small black young ones feed their parents as soon as
they have had enough ! The young of the first brood, of course, as usual,
feeding their brethren of the second nest. Occasionally the food is
passed on to the parents from the young of the first brood, who give it
first to the second brood, who in turn pass it on to their father and
or mother.

ZEBRA FIXCHES AT LIBERTY

<bodyText confidence="0.993737454545454" page_id="9396923"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
By the Marquess of Tavistock
About ten years ago I tried an experiment with various Australian
Finches at liberty; Gouldians and Parrot Finches were a failure, but I did
succeed in breeding Zebra Finches, Rufous-tailed Grass Finches,
Long-tailed Grass Finches, Parson Finches, and Diamond Sparrows.
Of these the Zebra Finches and Ruficandas were really prolific, and lots
of young ones made their appearance during the course of the summer ;
but as autumn drew to a close their numbers decreased, and next spring
I had only one or two pairs of old birds left. Then, with their offspring
of the year, disappeared the following winter. It was clear that the
little birds could not be kept at liberty all the year round, cold and
natural enemies being too much for them.
This year, however, I determined to see if certain foreign Finches
cannot be profitably and successfully kept at liberty during the summer
months only. Ruficandas, unhappily, are almost unobtainable now-
a-days, but at the end of June I bought five pairs of freshly imported
Zebra Finches. Although they were by no means in good condition,
they began nesting the day after their arrival and quarrelled so badly
in the good-sized aviary in which they were released that three days
later I had to give them their liberty. This was really too soon, as it
did not give them time to get properly used to their surroundings.
Consequently three disappeared at once, and probably strayed, while

The Marquess of Tavistock -- Zebra Finches at Liberty
a fourth, the weakest of the lot, died of chill. The three remaining
pairs settled down nicely, and soon had nests, one pair choosing the
top of a pear-tree in the kitchen-garden, another a branch of a Douglas
fir about 40 feet from the ground, and the third built in a juniper fairly-
low down. In due course two pairs brought their families to the feeding-
tray, one consisting of five young birds, and the other of three. When
the youngsters were quite independent of their parents I caught them up
for next year&amp;apos;s stock. The cock of the third pair disappeared just about
the time that a brood should have flown. I bought a new mate for the
widow, but released him too soon and he did not stay. Some weeks
later the hen likewise disappeared. The two pairs soon set about
repairing their nests, and at the end of September two more broods
appeared -- five and two, this time. As the season was getting on and
one of the old cocks was moulting and seemed a bit out of sorts, T caught
up the whole lot and ended the experiment for the year. On the whole
it has been a success, for though only seven old birds remain out of the
original eleven, I caught up nineteen Zebra Finches altogether. Had
I started in May with five strong pairs, and kept them in the aviary
ten days before releasing them I think there is little doubt that I should
have had well over thirty by now. The Zebra Finch is a jolly little
bird at liberty ; he is tame enough to let you see plenty of him and his
small size and nest-roosting habits protect him to a great extent against
the attacks of owls and other vermin ; he never goes far from home,
and will do well in quite a small garden ; Parrakeets need tall trees and
plenty of room, and are conspicuous targets for the guns of foolish or
ill-disposed persons, but tiny Finches are seldom noticed by those who
are not on the look-out for them. Zebra Finches build the same
substantial domed nests at liberty that they do in an aviary, and the
sexes seem to take turns in incubating the eggs, for when they are sitting
it is usual to see all the cocks feeding at one time and all the hens at
another. Both old birds accompany the young for a short time after
the latter have flown and the hen is the first to get tired of them ; stop
feeding; them and later drive them away.

By Frederick D. Welch
There were four specimens of this African species, Helotarsus
ecaudatus, living in the London Gardens in July. 1920, and as they showed
three distinct differences in coloration, although the birds were about
the same length, 23 inches, it seemed a good opportunity to point
out the differences at different ages and also to correct a misleading
statement in the Royal Natural History. Two of the Eagles which
arrived in June, 1919, had blackish-brown beaks, skin between that
part and the brown iris was brown ; in plumage they were darkish-
brown ; the legs being tinged with pink, and they remained so till
August, 1921 (since when I have not visited the Gardens and any future
change is therefore unknown to me).
These two were, it seemed to me, undoubtedly much younger than
the other two, which arrived in 1906 and 1909, and were very different,
being bright red between brown iris and beak (latter black in tip half,
yellowish at base), with legs also red.
It is here that the statement in the Royal Natural History is mis-
leading, because in vol. ix, p. 212, it states that the facial colour of
some Bateleurs living then was &amp;quot; solely due to effects of captivity &amp;quot;,
as they were paler than the &amp;quot; coral red &amp;quot; referred to a few lines before ;
and the words seem to me to therefore imply that a captive bird cannot
be red on face. But such is an obviously erroneous idea, as proved by
the two Bateleurs referred to by me, and which were still in perfect
health as late as August, 1921, when last seen by me. As the section
is not signed by any special writer it is uncertain who held that view
(except that as Dr. Bowdler Sharpe is referred to by name it seems
certainly not he who wrote it) ; but it seems to me as probable that the
birds there referred to had not then reached their fully adult colour,
because I have seen several red-faced Bateleurs in captivity from about
1898 (three years after dating of that book) and onwards (in addition
to those two referred to). These were alike in plumage except the
wings, being chestnut maroon on back, rump, and short tail, and black
elsewhere. In the coloration of long wing feathers these two older
birds differed from each other considerably up to August, 1921, they

being black in whole explosed-to-view length in one bird, while they were
slate-grey with only the end inches black in the other bird (as in wood-
cut on p. 212, Royal Natural History), and this difference could be seen
when the Eagles raised their wings, and also when they sat with them
folded.
Personally I do not consider that the exact age of any Eagle captured
in fully adult plumage can be known ; and it also seems impossible
(in my humble opinion) to make any estimate as to the age of either
bird referred to which would get within a year or two of their ages.
The only thing presentable is to say they were &amp;quot; over 12 and 15 years &amp;quot;
when this account was penned, which is proved by their dates of arrival.
But one bird may have been several years older than the other when
caught -- and from their wing-differences it would seem to me there is
considerably more than three years difference in age between them now.
But, be that view of mine as it may, the bird with black wing-feathers
seems to me older than the other, because it is more likely that grey would
darken into black as age advanced, rather than that a black feather
would turn grey in part. Upper parts of wing were brownish-black.
However, if either Editors or other member does not agree with this
view perhaps they will not hesitate to give their opinions in print.
As to habits, there are several voices uttered by Bateleurs which are
distinct ; for instance, like the words &amp;quot; uck ! uck ! &amp;quot; etc., &amp;quot; warr !
warr ! &amp;quot; etc., &amp;quot; orr ! orr ! &amp;quot; etc. ; and on the ground they look rather
peculiar because of wings projecting beyond short tail when walking.
Though somewhat ancient history, it may be worth adding that several
years ago now, a single female deposited a white egg which was removed
by the then head-keeper as obviously unfertile, he showing it to me
(Birtling this was). Some reference to the habits when wild seems
worth mentioning in concluding these notes on captive birds, especially
its feeding on snakes, many of which it captures when grassy parts
are on fire, at times entering the thick smoke. When we compare the
short leg of a Bateleur with the long leg (about 2 feet, I should think,
estimating, on living bird) of the Secretary Vulture, it is clear that a
long leg is not necessary to repeatedly kill poisonous snakes by holding
them at a distance from the bird&amp;apos;s body when disabling them by blows
on head from the powerful beak.

Personally I should think the success of the Bateleur is largely due
to rapidity of action in attack on the snake (in this being analogous
to Indian Mungoose, among mammals, versus Cobra) ; and this opinion
was supported some months after being formed by seeing two of the
living birds referred to engage in a pugnacious display when on the
floor of their cage, when both circled around each other rapidly by a
series of high hops. In addition to snakes and various reptiles, they
also feed on small mammals, carrion it is also said ; and can soar high
in the air (their wings being well developed, as shown when they stretch
them in the Gardens).

I saw on 10th August the young Black-capped Lory bred this
season by Mrs. M. Burgess, of Helston House, Clifton. It was apparently
about three months old, full-winged, and quite able to look after itself,
although I understand it retired at night with its parents to sleep in
the nest-box in which it was hatched. In size I should say it equalled
the hen. The iris was dark, the bill, which had been black, was at the
time of my visit rich horn brown, daily assuming an orange tint. It
seemed only to differ in colouring from the hen in having the under-tail
colouring greenish instead of violet blue. The colouring of its cap was
as dense as that of its parents. Although not densely feathered on the
breast, bunches of quills were fast appearing. It had already com-
menced to imitate sounds and whistles, and was an active and
engaging bird, susceptible of being perfectly tamed.
Two birds recently caught wild in the neighbourhood of Newport
(Mon.) wore brought to me by two different people within a week.
The first, a male example of Spermophila torqueola. A handsome
masked cinnamon white and black bird, a very free singer. It was in
perfect plumage and quite tractable and had, I surmise, escaped from
a &amp;quot; Plate &amp;quot; boat coming into Newport, Cardiff, Bristol, Avonmouth,
or Barry Docks. This species I have never seen arrive in trade con-
sighments, and have not seen it in any private collection, but believe
the London Zoo have had it once.

The other bird, harder to account for, was a Trumpeter Bullfinch,
a young male of the year, also in perfect plumage. This species has
not been conspicuous for many years. Mr. Meade- Waldo bred it and for
pleasing tone of colouring and that condition of plumage so favoured
by exhibitors of birds, it stands alone among comparatively plain
coloured finches. It is quite a time since I saw one alive. This may
have been a pet from a boat touching a South Mediterranean port,
but I have not heard that it is a common cage-bird among natives.
Among a consignment of South American birds lately received
in London I noticed specimens of Amblyrhamplius Jiolosericeus, the
Red-headed Marsh Troupial, a bird which has been absent for years.
I secured a very tame Yellow Cassique (C. persicus), which proved enter-
taining, and quite an attractive yellow and black bird with lemon-
green bill and china-blue irides. Its song is comical.
Another bird I secured, not often seen on the market, was a Green
or Yellow-bellied Maize-eater, or Greenish Hangnest. I found it active,
and not so devoid of interest as is the case with T. militaris and
L. superciliaris, two birds which, although conspicuous, are not attractive
in a cage. The olive-green of this Maize-eater contrasting with a band
of canary yellow makes it welcome in a collection of active birds of
this type.
These Troupials want grass and earth to &amp;quot; poke &amp;quot; their bills in,
otherwise in close confinement tbey require periodical trimming.
I also received two small Yellow-shouldered Troupials (A. thilius)
in apparently first plumage. These were much like miniature Meadow
Larks, minus the yellow chest. A few Diamond Finches came on the
market, and I was able to secure two pairs. Privately I received and
disposed of some Red and Green Parrot Finches and Pectoral Mannikins,
birds that are now increasingly scarce.
The Pesquets Parrakeet, now in the possession of Mrs. Burgess, is
quite a kind and affectionate bird, in spite of its rather forbidding
appearance. Clad for the most part in black and red, with its bare
face and throat coupled with an elongated vulture-like bill, it is not
unlike the Nestors. Had it a light iris it would possess a villanous
expression, but the iris is very dark. If maroon as described it must
be verv dark maroon. I could not examine this item in full&amp;quot; sunlight.

In the Bulletin of the Zoological Society of New York for September,
1921, Mr. Lee S. Crandall gives an interesting account of the display
of Paradisornis rudolfi, a pair of which species were acquired in the
autumn of 1 920. The male commenced to moult almost simultaneously
with his arrival and when he had renewed his body feathers the pair
were placed in a cage near the other Birds of Paradise. All went well
for a few days, when suddenly the male attacked his mate, and only
her prompt removal saved her life.
&amp;quot; The comparatively short side-plumes of the male had now reached
their full length, and appeared as brilliant blue beneath and delicate
mauve above. The two central tail feathers or &amp;apos; wires &amp;apos; had grown
to a length of a foot or more, each bearing on its tip a spatula of
brilliant blue. ,
&amp;quot; One morning a keeper who was working nearby noticed the male
bird was hanging upside-down from his perch, and otherwise con-
ducting himself strangely. He promptly reported that the bird was in
convulsions, and advocated its immediate removal to the hospital for
treatment. But more deliberate observation showed that while the
bird&amp;apos;s antics might properly be described as a convulsion, it evidently
was not of the sort that calls for medical aid. He was in full display,
such as perhaps had never before been seen by civilized man. The
display of this species is entirely different to that of the Paradisea
group, for instead of remaining in an active, upright, position, he
grasps his perch firmly with his powerful feet, and with legs extended
to the utmost, hangs head downward. During the entire display of
several minutes the position of the feet is never changed, and the firm
grip never is relaxed
&amp;quot; Viewed from the front the plumes, inconspicuous and rather
disappointing when at rest, form a brilliant inverted triangle, with the

raised feathers of the abdomen completing the centre. In the middle
appears a longitudinal, ovate patch of velvet black, bordered above
by a narrow band of dull red. formed by the feathers that ordinarily
clothe the abdomen. The long pendant &amp;apos; wires &amp;apos; rise to half their
length, then droop gracefully downward on either side. The wings are
held tightly closed and the head is turned upward.
&amp;quot; During the display the body is moved forward and back with the
hips as a fulcrum, and with a violent motion of the body the plumage
is frequently spread to its widest expanse. The white lines of feathers
which border the eye above and below are conspicuously extended,
leaving the bird only a narrow slit through which to peer at the observer.
Throughout the bird sings softly, in a low, grating voice, moving his
head slightly by sharp jerks. This habit of singing, in which the Blue
Bird of Paradise often indulges, when not in full display, seems peculiar
to this species.
&amp;quot; Taken altogether the display of this bird is a beautiful and
marvellous sight. The rapid vibration of the body causes the brilliant
blues of his plumage to run in waves of colour over the entire filmy
triangle. The dead black spot in the centre is made more conspicuous
by the contrasting colour above it, and when seen under certain lights
appears more like a deep cavity than a mere patch of plumage.&amp;quot;

A New Guinea Collection. -- During the past few weeks some
interesting birds have been received at the Zoological Gardens.
Mr. Frost arrived home from his expedition to New Guinea at the end
of August, and in his collection weie some fourteen birds of Paradise,
including the Greater, Lesser, Red, King, and Twelve-wired. We were
particularly glad to obtain a fine example of the last species. The
Aru Island Great Kingfisher (Seuromarptes tyro), of which there were
five specimens, is another very acceptable addition to the collection, as
it has apparently never before been imported alive. The Red-bellied
Rail (Eulabeornia castaneirentris), from the Aru Islands, is also new to
the collection, and so is Stephani&amp;apos;s Green-winged Pigeon (Chalcophaps
stephani) and the Orange-fronted Fruit Pigeon (Ptilopus aurantiifrons).

There was also an example of the rare and curious Pesquet&amp;apos;s Parrot
(Dasyptilus pesqneti), but this belonged to the collector, and was sent
to America.
Btrds from Para. -- Another interesting collection received by the
Zoological Society came from Para and contained a Boatbill (Can-
chroma cochlearia), two Cocoi Herons, two Maguari Storks (Exenura
maguari), four grey-necked Tree-ducks (Dendrocygna discolor), and two
Brazilian Motmots (Momotus momota). Of the latter, one was most
unfortunately drowned in a severe thunderstorm.
Breeding Leadbeater Cockatoos. -- An interesting event has been
the hatching and rearing of two young Leadbeater Cockatoos in one of
the aviaries on the south side of the Parrot-house. One of these tried
to take a flight abroad before he was strong enough to do so, and fell
to the floor and was injured, in consequence of which he is still unable
to fly, although his twin brother (or sister) can fly strongly. There is
no distinct juvenile plumage in these Cockatoos, the young, on leaving
the nest, being the exact counterpart of their parents, although decidedly
smaller. This same species of Cockatoo bred in the Gardens several
years ago in the large aviary on the canal bank, which is now, alas !
given up to monkeys.
The Sombre Bulbul. -- Messrs. A. W. Gamage continue to receive
consignments from South Africa and amongst the latest arrivals were
some examples of the Sombre Bulbul (Andropadus importttnus), a bird
that may be described as olive-green above and olive-grey below. Of
its habits and distribution the late Dr. Stark tells us that it is seldom
found away from the dense bush, and owing to its sombre colour and
shy habits is not easily seen or discovered ; it is sometimes heard seated
on the topmost branch of a tree giving forth a blythe song, and it has as
well a chirp like that of a Sparrow, only louder. It feeds on insects
and berries. It occurs in the bush districts of Cape Colony from the
neighbourhood of Cape Town, whore it is fairly common, along the
southern coast through Swellendam and Knysna and Natal, Zululand
and Lydenburg in t lie low country of the Eastern Transvaal.

September : &amp;quot; A collection of kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, black
swans, native companions, Tasmanian devils, emus, many kinds of
parrots, and two splendid specimens of Papuan birds of paradise,
were housed on the deck of the White Star liner Medic, which left
for England to-day. The collection was accompanied by an expert.
It constitutes the first consignment by the Australian Zoological
Control Board to its depot in London before sale to or exchange with
other European zoological societies.&amp;quot; The collection should reach
London about the first week in November, and it is probable that most
of the stock will be temporarily housed in the Zoological C4ardens.
The Contents of the Collection. -- Since the above was written
further information has come to hand of the contents of the collection,
and it would appear to be the finest single collection that has ever come
from the Antipodes, for, besides some hundred and fifty mammals,
such as kangaroos, wombats, and bandicoots, there are no less than some
twelve hundred birds from Australia and Papua. Amongst these may
be mentioned twenty-five Birds of Paradise, comprising the Magnificent,
Six-wired, and Count Eaggi&amp;apos;s, fourteen Eagles, seventy Fruit Pigeons,
two hundred and fifty Parrakeets, twenty-five Black Swans, ten
Laughing Kingfishers, eight hundred Finches, and many others. It
is unfortunate that this wonderful collection should be arriving at the
beginning of the winter, but at the same time birds purchased then will
have a chance of becoming established before the next breeding season.

By Frederick D. W*elch
One of the most interesting birds I ever knew was a Pel&amp;apos;s Owl
(Scotopelia peli), a large species of African Fish Owl, about 23 inches
long, of rufous-bay in general colour, with transverse black bars, and
spotted on breast and abdomen with black. The iris in this individual
was dark brown ; and it frequently uttered a long-drawn-out voice
rather like &amp;quot; teroo-o-o-o-o &amp;quot;, and became very tame with me. The
range of species is from Senegambia to Gaboon and Zambesi area, there

being no ear-tufts. Can we exclude the possibility of the voice being
indirectly of use ? I see no reason, even though it feeds on fish, why
the voice, if suddenly uttered, should not startle a small mammal or bird,
and make it more easily seen by the Owl ; and my experience in England
has been that some mammals certainly stay quiet if alarmed for a time
to escape danger, and will move if a sudden noise is made (for instance,
a wild vole 1 experimented on in 1917). Bouvier&amp;apos;s Owl (S. bouvieri) is
another species in the genus, the individual seen being from Lagos.
Briefly described it was smaller than S. peli and paler brown, the black
parts not so well marked ; iris dark brown. Unfortunately I do not
remember its voice. Does any reader ?
A Winking Owl (Ninox connivens) from North Queensland used to
utter a sound like &amp;quot; woop ! woop ! &amp;quot; ; it being a pretty little grey
bird with pale breast longitudinally streaked with brown and no ear-
tufts. But the most extraordinary sound I have yet heard from any
foreign Owl was a weird sepulchral cry which I believe came from a
Milky Eagle Owl (Bubo lacteus), a large ear-tufted species about
27 inches long, ranging in Africa south of a line from Senegambia to
Abyssinia. Considering that it and also a second bird seen were in
general colour of a darkish grey, with paler breast and abdomen, and
a black semicircular mark on each cheek (concave towards the beak),
the species name seems to me very unsuitable, because the breast and
abdomen were the only parts having any approach to milk white. Was
the type specimen an albino individual 1 However, it seems to me that
a species name ought to be retained even if it does not agree in colour,
because if people start to alter names originally given to the types
they knock away, so to speak, the foundations of nomenclature ; and
the result would be to cause confusion among ornithologists and do
more harm than good.
In this Owl it seems to me that such an unearthly sound as that
voice would make a concealed mammal or bird start and expose its
whereabouts to a passing Owl. The sound referred to made me &amp;quot; jump &amp;quot;
at the moment.
Syrnium indranee of South India and Ceylon is an attractive looking
species, a living individual uttering voice much like S. aluco ; and to
show how variable it is I am quoting from writings of the late

Another Ceylon specimen, a darker bird, chest coarsely barred with
dark brown, somewhat uniform on sides ; face deep rufous ochre,

Another Ceylon bird, strongly tinged with ochreous below ; face
bright orange rufous, scarcely any white on lower margin ; no sign of

When we consider that Owls roam from place to place it seems to
me there is no doubt that S. indranee varies in the same locality in both
sexes. Two specimens of the Ural Owl (Syrnium uralense) of north and
east Europe and Siberia, a large species about 25 in. long, varied in
general colour ; one a pale bird, with darker streaks on head, breast,
and abdomen ; the other being a blackish coloration with darker
marks showing through. Both uttered at times a bleat like a goat,
and were living in same cage. Is this species of dimorphic coloration
at times (analogous to what occurs in some mammals) a double-normal
coloration \ Or was the above an abnormal melanistic specimen ?

REMARKS AND QUERIES ABOUT KAGU
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99784012" page_id="9396935"  page_num="157" year="" vol="">
Sirs, -- In the Avicultural Magazine of 1920 some remarks, mostly
about the voice of this bird, Rhinochaetus jubatus, were printed on p. 182,
they being founded on an individual which had lived in the London
Gardens since November, 1906. It seems worth adding now that
when in the Gardens in June, 1921 , I was told that the bird had recently
died, which brings its life in captivity to 14 1 years. Can anyone give
a longer-known-life in a captive bird ?
When the note referred to was written by me I was not aware
that Mr. Heumann was breeding this aberrant offshoot of the Crane
group at his home in New South Wales, as mentioned by Mr. Seth-
Smith on p. 28 of the 1921 volume ; and as my note was, in addition
to recording voice, also intended to draw information from other people,
might I ask Mr. Heumann for some facts about his breeding pair ?
Is only one egg laid ? Is any nest made, or the egg laid on grass
only 1 What is the colour and size of it ? Do both male and female
incubate ; and what is the period of incubation ? Is the newly
hatched bird downy, or is it naked ?
As Mr. Heumann has, so I was informed by a person who read my
note, already written about these birds, my queries may bring some
repetition of statements made in former volumes of the Avicultural
about his birds.
But even if so, it does not seem to me the repetition would be
superfluous, because new members are being added to the Society
(and many more will, I hope, join !). some of whom at least would also
be interested in the replies to above questions ; and also because it is

not always easy to get a copy of any special number where a bird or
group of birds a person is interested in have been written about.
I should also like to suggest that if Mr. Heumann has a photograph
of a male, female, and chick which he has bred, they should be printed
in a future number of the Magazine to preserve a record, because it seems
to be not unlikely these birds may become extinct owing to their
defenceless nature and helplessness.
As to the adult in the London Gardens, I never saw it attempt to use
its wings in flight, which suggests the species had lost the knowledge
as to how they were formerly used ; nor did it even attempt to raise
them in like manner as the allied so-called Sun Bittern (Eurypyga
lielias) of South America does, standing in self-defence when other birds
attempt to interfere with it, but the Kagu only crouched into a half-
standing position (as some domestic fowls do when alarmed) when
approached by strangers who tried to handle it, and made no attempt
to resist interference.
On this subject I cannot find any information in the books by me
now ; but judging from the attitude of the Kagu in the Gardens in
London, it seemed to me as probable that the species had lost the use
of wings owing to living century after century in an island home (New
Caledonia) in the Pacific Ocean ; and where, so far as I am aware,
there are none of the flesh-eating marsupials known as Dasyures and
their allies, which mammals are presumably frequently stalking birds
on the Australian mainland, and in doing so keeping their wings in
good order by making them use these parts, in addition to their legs,
to escape mammalian enemies. Is this opinion of mine about Kagus
having, as a species, lost the use of their wings supported by observa-
tion on other birds ?

Gould originally called it, namely Polytelis. If the Rock Pebbler and
the Barraband are Polytelis, then, undoubtedly, the Queen Alexandra
Parrakeet is also.
Just because the latter species sports in the male one spatulated
feather in the primaries, it was afterwards placed by itself under the
title of Spathopterus. Now it has been found that that name is pre-
occupied, and Mr. Matthews has coined a new one, and to my mind an
entirely unwarrantable one, namely Norikipsitta alexandrce. All this
trampling upon original names and separation of species because of
one feather is ridiculous, and more, it is presumptuous.
I will not dwell upon the trinomal nomenclature, because in
aviculture I have something better to do than to talk of my Bullfinch
as Pyrrhula pyrrhuh pileala ! But I can only say that when my living
Queen Alexandra Parrakeets die I shall refuse to present their skins
to any museum or individual (and they are extremely rare, even as such)
unless the bird is labelled what Gould named it, namely Polytelis
alexandrce, and that only.
Xo doubt one gains some kudos when coming generations see one&amp;apos;s
name as the giver of titles along with Linnaeus, etc., but if we once let
in the thin end of the wedge and ignore ornithologists, such as Gould,
I see no reason why we should not all of us invent and coin a different
name for the same bird, according to our fancies, just as war-profiteers
and neuveaux riches put together some ridiculous coat of arms, or calmly
annex the crest of another family, as well as the name !

Sirs.. -- I see from the August number of the Magazine that
Capt. Rattigan has bred the Yellow-billed Cardinal, and that he is
under the impression that this has not occurred before in this country.
I bred the species in 1911, in my old aviaries. Two broods of two and
three youngsters respectively left the nest during the summer ; beyond
providing a large number of insects, I had no difficulty at all with
my birds.
Bird-keepers will remember that this species was quite common
and cheap in those days, and I was much more interested in the hoped-
for breeding of a pair of Black-cheeked Cardinals (P. nigrigenis), which
unfortunately did not materialize.
Mr. Temple clearly remembers the rearing of the young Yellow-
bills, but we neither of us knew that the occurrence was an unusual one.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965220210526316" page_id="9396938"  page_num="160" year="" vol="">
Sirs, -- The hatching of a young white-naped Crane in the Zoological
Gardens last spring is not the first case of a Crane breeding in the Zoo.
The Mantchurian Crane bred there in 1861 (Proceeding?, 1861, p. 369).
The incubation period of the white-naped Crane which bred at
the Gardens last spring was said to be thirty-five days from the laying
of the first egg. Blaauw gives thirty days, as noted in the Amsterdam
Zoological Gardens. He also says that, when his own Mantchurian
Cranes bred, the first chick was hatched on the thirty-first day after
the laying of the first egg. It almost looks as if the incubation period
varied in these birds to the extent of several days.
I have a pair of Mantchurian Cranes which have nested the last three
years. I made very careful notes in 1919, in which year the female laid
the first egg on 28th April, and began to sit at midday that day. The
first chick was hatched on 1st June, the thirty-fourth day after the
laying of the first egg. Last year only one egg was hatched. If it was
the second egg laid, it hatched on the thirty-fourth day, but if it was the
first laid it did not hatch until the thirty-seventh day, which seems
improbable.

BREEDING OF THK SALTATOR TANAGER

Last autumn Mr. Rogers, of Liverpool, sent me a line saying he
had some South American stock in and would I care to have a look,
so I went round to see what had arrived. Amongst the arrivals were
some large brown birds like Grosbeaks, which I had not previously seen,
so I selected what I thought would be a true pair. I have since
discovered that they are Saltator Tanagers, apparently Saltator
aurantiirostris. One bird showed a yellow under mandible, and
the other, which was similar to several of the others, had two
dark mandibles. This proved to be a hen, but as she was about
the cleanest and strongest of the lot I was half afraid it might
turn out to lie a young cock. I took them home, and in a few
days let them out in the large aviary. &amp;apos; The hen at once gathered a few
sticks and straws together, and with a little hay made the beginning
of a nest, but it was never completed, and they soon took no notice of
it. In the early spring I drove all the birds into the bird house, and did
not let them out again until all the shrubs and trees had made a good
start and the aviary had 1 n cleaned up generally. As soon as they
bad the chance of getting out of doors again they began to build \0x25A0.&amp;gt;.

the nest was rough and not unlike a huge blackbird&amp;apos;s, but well-finished
inside. The hen laid and commenced to sit, and T went to have a peep
when she was off to see what the nest and eggs were like. T could
see into it and did not disturb it in any way, but she never went near it

again. There was only one egg in it, something like a thrush&amp;apos;s egg.
They began to build another nest in a small shelter shed, which was
completed in a few days, but they appeared not to like it, and started
a fresh one outside in an elder. This, again, they left, and I presently
found they were sitting in the nest in the shelter shed. Four eggs were
laid, but only one young one was hatched, which left the nest when
not fully feathered, much as the smaller thrushes and blackbirds out
of a nest do here. This young one used to climb about in the bushes
and on the ground, and was well attended to. I saw it many times, and
it much resembled the hen, except that the colour was darker. I
imagined it was fully reared, but for some reason it disappeared --
possibly the old birds stopped feeding, or it did not find the water,
the weather was very dry and hot and the water was a good deal
hidden by long grass. Anyhow, the old birds had built another nest
ami were sitting again in an elder, outside. They had commenced to
feed their young before I went away for three weeks, and on my return
I found two strong young birds, fully as big as the parents, flying about.
In a few days I saw them eating buds and coining in the evening for
a drink and a feed of live food (gentles), which is always kept in a tin.
This time liny appeared to be two cocks, as they were almost exactly
like the cock, except that both mandibles are light yellow horn colour,
and there is no clearly defined bib marking. Both old and young are
not at all shy, and come quite close for live food. She sat closely but
used to come off for a feed in the evenings. The cock was very attentive,
and used to cany food to the hen, and always gave her food when she
came off the nest -- mealworms or hop-buds, or anything he could get.
I never saw him sitting on the nest. Both birds worked hard at building
the nest. The young were fed on mealworms, gentles, milk-sop, and
buds from the hop-plants, and later on seeds as well. The first
day or two the parents used mealworms only, which they killed very
carefully before taking to the nest. I used to think the mealworm had
been eaten sometimes, but found they always flew away with it and out
it came again to undergo a further preparation before flying off to the
nest. Almost from the first they fed the young on small hop-buds,
also a little milk-sop. They are quite quiet in the avairy except when
nesting and then, as might be expected, they rush at and drive away
anv birds that come near the nest.

By M. Amsler, M.B.
Although the King is not a very rare species, and is found either
singly or in pairs in most large collections, I believe I am right in thinking
that the successful rearing of young is a somewhat unusual occurrence.
In the first place hens are not very easily come by, a good many
supposed hens being males in immature plumage. As the males take
three years to develop their distinctive plumage this, in itself, may cause
the hopeful aviculturist no inconsiderable delay. Furthermore, the hen
King Parrakeet appears very loth to make use of a nest-box. In the
wild state the species chooses the hollow limb of some tall and rotten
tree ; the entrance hole may thus be at a height of 30 or 40 feet and the
actual nest almost at the ground level. In captivity it is obviously
impossible to provide a nest-box more than 3 or 4 feet long, and
this may account for the birds&amp;apos; unwillingness to make use of the usual
type of nest-box with which they are provided. My pair of birds came
to me from Sir Leo Chiozza Money in 1920 with a rather bad character,
the hen had either laid and refused to sit, or had not used a hox and
thus spoiled the eggs -- I forget which.
These birds spent the winter and early spring in a fair-sized aviary,
together with a pair of Blue and Black Jays ; they paid little attention
to each other, but devoted all their spare time to destroying what few
bushes the aviary contained. In April I put the pair in a small all-wire
flight, 10 ft. by 4 ft., provided with two types of nest-box. One a deep
box about 3 feet long, with a hole near the top and a concave wooden
bottom ; the other was also about 3 feet in length, but was laid
horizontally and had one end open to allow the birds to enter -- to my
mind the latter was an ideal box. These boxes I have lately removed,
and I do not believe cither bird ever entered them, as the sawdust which
I placed inside was not even disturbed, and there was not a feather
or other sign of a bird having inhabited either nest.
Knowing their species&amp;apos; propensity for laying on the ground I also
provided a half coco-nut husk cemented into a box and buried flush
with the surface of the ground. In May the birds were seen pairing,
and the cock was constantly dancing round the hm and being generally

officious. On the 13th of that month I saw the hen very busy on the
ground, scraping a hole with her beak and feet, all the time assisted by
the cock, who fussed around freely and did nothing at all. I examined
their &amp;quot; scrape &amp;quot; later in the day ; it was a very rough affair, about 9 inches
in diameter and some 3 inches deep, and contained a number of stones,
which I removed. Next day there were again a number of stones in
the &amp;quot; scrape &amp;quot;, and this time I left them there -- they were collected and
carried to the nest by the hen.
By 18th May all traces of the &amp;quot; scrape &amp;apos;* had disappeared, and I found
an egg on the ground near where it had existed. I put this egg in the
coco-nut husk, which happened to be near by. On the 20th another
egg was laid in exactly the same place as the first. This was evidently
a spot to the hen&amp;apos;s liking, so I made a hollow and firm hole in the ground,
surrounded it by four bricks placed on edge, and placed the two eggs
in the middle. On the 21st I was glad to see that a third egg had been
added in the artificial nest. On the 23rd the fourth egg was laid, and
on that day I covered the nest by a sort of tunnel made of galvanized
iron bent into a semicircle, and kept in position by wooden pegs
driven into the ground ; the hen could enter from either end.
Fortunately, all this in no way disturbed her, and she laid two more
eggs on the 25th and 27th, making a total number of six, of which I
had to remove one as it was cracked.
At first the hen sat very unsteadily, hut 1 should say that she began
incubation with the fourth egg. The eggs varied a good deal in size
and shape, were very granular in texture, and two, at least, might be
described as nodular, quite unlike any other eggs I have ever seen ; this
may, of course, be an exceptional feature, due to some defect in the
female bird. After the first few days the hen incubated very well,
but owing to the shape of the earth bottom of the nest the eggs rolled
about a good deal, and I frequently saw one or more eggs which were
not properly covered when watching the hen on her nest. On several
occasions I deepened the hole and tried to make it more to the hen&amp;apos;s
liking, but the earth was inclined to crumble away at the edges and to
fill up the hollow. Each time I looked in I found and removed a number
of pebbles, evidently put in either by the cock or by the hen on her
return to her nest ; I much feared that these would break the eggs and so

&amp;apos;hired not leave them. Could they have been put in to prevent the eggs
rolling about ? I allowed incubation to proceed until 20th June --
over three weeks, when I examined the eggs ; they were all infertile,
so I removed them and the nesting arrangements in the hopes that a
further clutch might be forthcoming and that the birds would choose
a nest-box. During all this time the cock was most assiduous in feeding
the hen, and became much tamer than he had formerly been.
On 30th June, 2nd July, and 3rd July three eggs were laid again
on the ground. This time 1 cut a hemispherical hole in a thick piece of
timber, which I buried flush with the ground and in which I placed the
three eggs. On 5th July a fourth egg was laid with the preceding ones,
and I then replaced my galvanized iron roof. The hen looked like laying
for another three days, but changed her mind and began incubation
on 8th July. She sat very steadily, with the cock in constant attendance,
until 28th July, when three chicks hatched out ; incubation was there-
fore just under three weeks.
Fearing that the chicks would wriggle out of their shallow nest, I
made a sort of box, some 6 inches deep, which I fixed round the nest
on 6th August ; the parents had to climb over the edge to get down
to the young, but they were in no wise disturbed by this change in
their home, and I have no doubt that I should have failed in rearing the
young had I not taken this precaution. The chicks were even uglier
than most parrakeets in the early stages, the skin being greyish white
covered with dark grey down. They were constantly brooded by the
hen during the first ten days, and I think the cock did most of the
feeding, though I am not certain whether at this period he gave the
food direct to the chicks or whether he fed the hen, who subsequently
fed the young. Very large quantities of hemp and sunflower seed
were consumed. Unlike Rosella&amp;apos;s and Cockatiels, soaked bread and
ground rice were not touched. Owing to the drought there was a
great scarcity of groundsel, chickweed, and dandelion, but a large
seeding let ni-.-e would disappear in an incredibly short time.
By 6th August. a1 the age of 9 days, the young were well covered
A-ith quills, and extremely noisy when hungry. By the 20th the quills
were bursting, a id I be green colour was clearly \ isible or I he heads and
backs. One of the chicks was considerably smaller than the other two.

Growth continued apace,, and on 5th September, at the age of 6 weeks,
the first youngster left the nest and marched solemnly about the small
aviary. He was about two-thirds the size of the parents, with, of course,
a stumpy tail, which made him look still smaller. The colour was much
that of the female ; green head and back, with darker flights ; the rump
blue, legs and feet horn coloured, beak a pinkish brown. The young of
the species are said to have the outer webs of the tail feathers pink,
but I could not find this trait in my birds, even on handling them. The
first young bird returned to its somewhat unnatural nest for the night
but reappeared on the two following days ; it was, however, very timid,
and would always bolt back to its &amp;quot; burrow &amp;quot; on the approach of any
human being.
By 12th September this bird could fly strongly, and looked very
nearly as large as its parents. On this day, the second chick left the
nest and did not return-- there was heavy rain that night, but neither
looked any the worse on the morning of the 13th, when a third and
much smaller chick appeared. As the flight has no shelter and the
nights were becoming cold, I caught and transferred the five birds to
an aviary with a large shelter shed, into which I had them shut up at
night. For a time the smallest bird was inclined to mope about on the
ground, and spent much of his time crying bitterly for the companion-
ship of his brothers and parents on the perches above. T occasionally
took him i.|&amp;gt; in my hands and put him on a branch ; this was always
accompanied by a violent fit of yelling, which continued long after I
had left him, and reminded one strongly of a frightened or spoilt child.
At the present time. 1st October, all three young can fly strongly.
Their favourite food is hemp, sunflower, and apple, but they also eat
a fair quantity of mixed chicken com and boiled maize. The two larger
ones are scarcely distinguishable from their mother, but one of them has
distinctly brighter and more extensive red on the underparts, and is
obviously a male. They are quite independant, but they still like being
fed. and on this point their parents pander to them.

By Dr. E. Hopkinson, D.S.O.
A recent advertisement of Drongos and some South African Shrikes
drew me to the &amp;quot; Zoo &amp;quot; at Carnages, my first visit to this delightful
place, but I hope not the last.
These particular birds were my main attraction, for I have kept
(or rather tried to keep) a few of them in West Africa, but the whole
place and all its occupants were a revelation to me. More or less cut
off from things birdy in recent years, I had no idea that such advances
in the bird-dealing line had been made nor that a &amp;quot; bird-shop &amp;quot;, even
at its highest (as here), could be such a delightful place, where birds
looked well, were kept well, and apparantly sold well.
The sight of these Shrikes determined me to try again with some
of the Gambian species if opportunity offers, and also led me to look
up what records I have at hand of the keeping of Shrikes in captivity.
These are chiefly back numbers of the Avicultural Magazine and Bird
Notes, some of the more recent Zoo lists, and an occasional reference
elsewhere. The following is the result of my search, and although there
must be a few more records of other species obtained by our own or
other Zoos or by dealers, I think it must contain nearly all the Shrikes,
which so far have attained avicultural interest.
As regards the Drongos, which, however, are, of course, not true
Shrikes, I have occasionally seen an odd example of an Indian species
in captivity, but never before an African. Have any African Drongos
been ever imported before these birds at Gamages ? They, are, I presume,
either Dicrurus afer or ludwigi, but as their tails are broken one cannot
be sure whether they are the first, the Fork-tailed, or the second, the
Square-tailed Drongo.
Mr. Finn, in his article on the &amp;quot; Cage-birds of Calcutta &amp;quot; (Ibis 1901),
mentions three species of Indian Drongo, but of these he says that only
one, the Bhimraj, Dissemurus paradiseus, is at all commonly seen in
captivity. The only other record I find is another Asiatic species, the
Javam Drongo. CrypsirMna varians, one of which appears in the
Zoo lists as &amp;quot; new to the collection &amp;quot; in 1907. I will now get on to the
true Shrikes. Laniidce.

The Great Grey Shrike, Lanius excubitor,
Was (and no doubt will be again) a not uncommon and a
very attractive show bird. As many as four at one show are recorded
in the A.M. for 1908 (p. 158., Crystal Palace Show of that year).
Bechstein includes it in his book on cage-birds, giving some ten lines
to its &amp;quot; attractive qualities &amp;quot;, and mentioning its use as a &amp;quot; Sentinel &amp;quot;
in Falcon-catching. It also finds a place in some of the English cage-
bird books, such as Birchley, etc.
The Lesser Grey Shrike, Lanius minor.
I believe I have seen this bird on the show bench, but can find no
record. Bechstein gives quite a long account, and calls it a &amp;quot; very
desirable cage-bird &amp;quot;. Altogether this writer deals with four Shrikes,
the other two being the Woodcuat and Red-backed.
The Red-backed Shrike, Lanius collurio,
Besides being not uncommon as a show-bird, has the distinction
of being the only Shrike hitherto bred in captivity. A pair belonging to
Dr. Giinther nested in 1901, and between then and 1912 reared
altogether seven broods in captivity. See A.M., 1901. 339 : 1912, 335,
and elsewhere in the interim.
The Woodchat-Shrikk. Lanius senator.
This rare visitor to Britain lias made a very occasional appearance
at show r s, but except for one once brought me alive in the Gambia,
where it is a common winter visitor. I have never seen one in captivity.
Other members of the genus Lanius which my records lead me to
include are :--

in the Zoo lists as new birds in 1902, 1912, and 1915 respectively. 1
Captain Perreau in Bird Notes for 1911 (p. 254) described Nos. 3 and 4
as making &amp;quot; very good pets when hand-reared. Wild-caught birds
I have not tried, but fancy they would be difficult to steady down ;
they have quite pleasing notes, and some very harsh ones&amp;quot;.
No. 1, the American Grey Shrike, appears in Kuss&amp;apos; big work,
the only true Shrike included. The only fact of real avicultural interest
mentioned is that three were kept in 1879 in Chicago (Fremdlandishe
Studenvogel, ii, p. 161). The Indian Grey Shrike holds much the
same position in Dr. Butler&amp;apos;s book, where we learn that the first example
our Zoo had was obtained in 1890. He also mentions certain North
African Shrikes reared by Mr. Meade- Waldo. (See Foreign Cage-birds,
h. p. 57. and A.M., 1905, p. 45.)
No. 7. the latest record is the large black and white long-tailed
Magpie-Shrike, of South Africa. One of these reached the Zoo in 1920.
We can now turn to the Bush-Shrikes, the Malaconotince, examples
of which were the original cause of this article. These are, indeed,
rare cage-birds, even compared with their relatives already mentioned,
and records and references to them as such are few. In the A.M. for
1902. Dr. Butler (p. 11) writes of some of the South African Bush-
Shrikes as likely to make desirable cage-birds, and in his Birds of
Africa (vol. v. p. HO). Captain Shelley quotes Swynnerton as having
kept specimens of the Southern Grey-headed Bush-Shrikes,
Malaconotits hypopyrrhus, in captivity for some time and found that
they fed freely on locusts, grasshoppers, and the like. This is just
what I found with those I have tried to keep in Gambia, but they never
got really meated off.
The Four-coloured Bush-Shrike, Laniarius ijiiadricolor, was
in the Zoo collection in 1882 according to Dr. Russ (T.c. 464), and this
is the only record 1 have come across which can be said to raise these
birds from the ranks of potential to actual cage-birds, and the two
species on show at Gamages are the first 1 have known as such, except
for my own unsuccessful efforts in this direction in West Africa.
The species represented are the Senegal (or Black-headed Bush-

Shrike, Tschagra senegala, and the Puffback-Shrike, Dryoscopus
cubla, I presume.
Of the first, I think there are four examples all in good condition,
while one is in almost perfect fettle, a wonderful tribute to their
importer&amp;apos;s care, as, indeed, are all the birds he brought with them,
both hard- and soft-billed. For general good condition and looks the
Robin-Chats and some rare Bulbuls would take a lot of beating, while
a cageful of Dufresne&amp;apos;s Waxbills absolutely took my breath away for
good looks, although apparently still in the cage in which they travelled.
I have brought home a good many Waxbills in my time, and am quite
satisfied usually with the condition in which they arrive, but I have,
I am sure, never bettered this lot.
The Senegal Shrikes are particularly interesting to me, for I know
them well in Gambia, where they are very common, and known as the
&amp;quot; Ndoio &amp;quot;. Above the colour is a rich red brown, below pale buff . The
crown is black, the eyebrow pale fawn, and there is a black streak below
the eve, giving the head a striped appearance. The tail is black with
white spots near the ends of the feathers, which are most conspicuous
when the bird flies. With us they are birds of the more open country,
where they spend much of their time on the ground among low scrub, in
which they skulk and manage in a wonderful way to hide their rather
conspicuous plumage. When obliged to fly they still keep low down or
perhaps more often take long flying hops along the ground to another
patch of shelter. They are always found in pairs, and when one leaves
a bush it is almost immediately followed by its mate. It is a beautiful
singer (probably the best we have in Gambia), and is heard mostly during
and just after the rains, and then most frequently and at its best in the
early mornings and late evenings. The song consists of a long strain of
sweet flutey notes, very distinctive when heard, but difficult to remember
or whistle. The Mandingos say that this bird is so proud of and so
wrapped up in the beauty of its voice that it shuts its eyes when singing
in order to listen better to its own notes, and then becomes so absorbed
in the performance that it can be easily caught in the hand. Needless
to say, I have never done or seen this done, but really I rather hesitate
to disbelieve it, for besides realizing now that there are many things in
Africa one cannot merely dismiss with scoffing, I saw one of the

Dr. Hopkinson -- Shrikes as Cage-birds 171
Babblers I brought home caught in the hand on a fence in broad day-
light while engaged in scolding at another bird below him.
I had forgotten that these birds had so extensive a range in Africa
and that the West and South African birds are both senegalus till I
looked it up. I think, however, that the Gambian birds are rather more
ruddy than these I saw the other day, and I see (from Shelley) that the
two are subspecifically separated, Tschagra senegalus (Linn), Senegal
to Liberia, T. s. erythroptera (Shaw), South Africa.
Of the Puffback-Shkikes, if I remember rightly, there were two.
They had broken their tails and generally roughened themselves, but
were fat and healthy. Although now very steady, they obviously did
not at first take so kindly to cage-life as the others must have done.
Black and white, and the long soft white back feathers are the
main features of their coloration. In the Gambia our Puffback is
I), gambensis. I have never attempted to keep them and consider that
their successful importation is (together with that of the Drongos)
an even greater achievement than that of senegalus. Both Puffbacks
and Drongos have always seemed to me too flycatchery and difficult
to attempt.
Of the Bush-Shrikes the species which I should rather keep than
any, on account of his striking plumage, is :
The Barbary Bush-Shrike, Laniarius barbarus.
This bird is glossy black above, below (from chin to vent) bright
scarlet, and its crown and forehead are yellow, a bird therefore to
catch the eye. They are quite common in the Gambia all the year
round, and frequent in pairs the outskirts of thick bush, particularly
along the swamps and near bush-wells or pools. Their call-note is
&amp;quot; tchirk-tchirk &amp;quot;. while besides they have a short whistling song of a
few notes.
I have kept several, but never for any length of time. All fed well,
probably too well, on large insects, lizards, small birds, mice, etc., but
I never got one on to a diet suitable for a homeward voyage. I must
say I never tried very hard, for I do not think J ever had one near the
nine for my leave, so that I was never tempte I to try and keep them
when there was any difficulty in getting live food.

The Grey-headed Bush-Shrike, Malaconotus poliocephalus, is
another handsome bird, green above and yellow below, and distinctly
larger than the Barbary. They are more tree-birds than the other
Gambian species, and have a long-drawn sweet but rather monotonous
whistle.
I mention these two birds as desiderata, but really, if included at
all, their mention should have been higher up with the other &amp;quot; possibles&amp;quot;,
for so far they are certainly nothing more.

single examples have reached England and perhaps there have been
more. These are Graucalus, as mentioned above, and Pericrocotus, the

Under the title Birds One Should Know, Messrs Gay &amp; Hancock
have produced a very attractive quarto volume, the letterpress of which
is by the Rev. Canon Theodore Wood, who describes thirty-three of the
commoner species of British birds, and deals especially with their
beneficial as well as their mischievous qualities. He is fair in his
criticism, and although in dealing with the Sparrow, for instance, he
lays full stress upon the good it performs in devouring insects in the
spring, he does not minimize the harm it does, and comes to the con-
clusion that this more than balances the good. He considers the
Chaffinch a friend to the farmer during one half of the year and an

The great charm of the book, however, lies in its illustrations, which

natural history work, and will, we think, soon be well to the fore in this.

The title is perhaps somewhat misleading, for the youngest student
of British birds will want to know more of our birds than are described
here, and it seems strange that a book entitled Birds One Should Know
should contain no account of the Nightingale, Yellow-hammer, or
Linnet, while a comparatively rare species, such as the Short-eared
Owl should be dealt with. But we realize that the letterpress is
secondary to the illustrations.

A RARE BRAZILIAN OWL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982555227272727" page_id="9396953"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
Sirs. -- I have recently bought a very handsome small Owl, of which
I do not know the name, and I should be greatly obliged if any member
could enlighten me. The dealer says that it comes from Brazil. It
is about the size of our Barn Owl, diurnal, streaked all over with brown
and tawny yellow, legs and feet covered with very close tawny down,
claws black ; feet and legs particularly neat, almost hawk-like. The
wings are very long, and project beyond the longish barred tail ; under-
neath the wings the plumage is tawny. The facial disc is full and round,
but the head is rather small in comparison with most Owls ; iris bright
golden yellow, pupil black. Two very short &amp;quot; ears &amp;quot; quite close together
on the crown of the head, like a double crest. I think the bird can
elevate and depress these tufts, but am not quite certain ; they certainly
appear more erect if the bird is alarmed or excited, but it may be that
they seem so because the other head feathers are depressed.
When this Owl sits erect on its stump it is strikingly hawk-like.
It is in good plumage, and keeps itself very clean, enjoying a bath nearly
every day.
I should like to know if it will stand the winter in an out-door
aviary facing south, with wooden sides and roof ; also if it has been
frequently imported.

In the Brown Owls the males when adult have almost invariably
white breasts without spots ; when young they occasionally have a
few spots on the flanks, but these are lost with years. The reverse is
the case with the females, the spots on flanks, etc., get thicker and
more extended with age.
The very dark Ural Owl which was in an aviary with an adult of the
normal colour was a melanistic -- two of these melanistic forms arrived
-- and I believe it is not very rare in one locality. The Ural Owl is a
true Wood Owl, with all the habits of our Tawny Owl. An adult female
that I had in confinement for some years escaped and immediately
resumed her natural wild life in our woods. She was evidently a wild-
caught bird, and evidently also the mother of a young one that I
obtained with her. She hunted like the Tawny Owl, floating from tree
to tree silently, and intently listening for the slightest movement in
leaves or grass. She evidently knew all about squirrels, for when she
had only been out a week I saw her visit several squirrels&amp;apos; dreys and pull
them about to see if the owner was at home. She was seen occasionally
for about twelve months, and was eventually shot about 40 miles
away two years after her escape.

The Ceylon Wood Owl (Syrnium indranee) differs much in both sexes
throughout its range, as does our own Tawny Owl. In this country
it appears to be of three types, foxy red, brown, and ash grey, of which the
latter is the rarest locally. Every intermediate form of colouring occurs,
and it is extremely hard to find two alike. I think as a rule the foxy-red
individuals are inclined to be most numerous in the west, and the grey
in the east, but you may find both extremes in the same nest, or, rather,
in the same brood when they have got their complete plumage in August.
The Owls are so admirably equipped with their marvellous powers of
hearing and sight that there seems no reason to suppose that their voice
is used for any other purpose than that of communicating with one another
and a love son&amp;quot; a^ in other birds.

THE BREEDING OF THE PASSERINE

<bodyText confidence="0.998658333333333" page_id="9396956"  page_num="178" year="" vol="">
There are certain birds which, while they do not succeed at liberty
on the first or second trial, nevertheless do not behave so badly that one
puts them down as hopeless. I have made three or four experiments
with Passerine Parrotlets, better known by their trade name of Blue-
winged Lovebirds. They are attractive little fellows, and the Kingfisher
will not give you a lovelier flash of colour than the cock as he flies across
the garden with his mate under the summer sun. But somehow I
could not get them to breed, and while they proved hardy enough when
over the effects of their journey and not such inveterate migrants and
wanderers as Budgerigars and Black-cheeked Lovebirds, their numbers
gradually dwindled until none at all remained. One pair lived through
a severe winter out of doors, in spite of the fact that the hen had a
damaged wing and could not fly properly ; but when summer returned
aDd I made sure they would nest, they, too, disappeared. During the
course of my early experiments I learned a few things about Bluewings
in captivity. (1) That it is fatal to keep them in a cage with varnished
woodwork ; they nibble the wood, and then it is good-bye. (2) That
they are fond of moistened stale bread or sponge-cake ; I could never

tempt them with any kind of green food, although it is not an un-
common sight to see them feeding on the turf when at liberty. (3) That
you cannot keep pairs together in a confined space for more than a
limited period. Sooner or later they start fighting most murderously ;
separating the sexes improves matters a bit, but the safest plan is to
keep each pair by themselves. (4) That, while they do not need a
large aviary, they pine away if kept in a cage for many months with-
out the amusement of a nest-box. I wish people would realize that it
is absolute cruelty to keep Lovebirds, Parrotlets, or even Budgerigars
permanently in a small cage with no opportunity of breeding.
In the early summer of 1920 I obtained a few pairs of freshly imported
Bluewings and turned them out in my garden in Hampshire, but the
torrential rain of that misguided summer, which seems to have borrowed
the entire rainfall of 1921 to add to its natural allowance, proved quite
too much for the Parrotlets, who all disappeared or contracted chills,
and only one hen survived. T determined to try a final experiment
with more or less established birds, and during the winter made up four
healthy pairs, which I released in the middle of May, adding a fifth
hen some time later as a mate for a Red-faced Lovebird. The Blue-
wings soon settled down and started inspecting nest-boxes and
quarrelling among themselves. By the end of the month one pair
seemed on the point of laying ; then a run of bad luck began. A cock
and two hens disappeared, a third hen died egg-bound, and the remains
of a fourth were discovered which had probably fallen a victim to the
same complaint. During July a young bird made its appearance at the
feeding-tray, and when it was quite independent of its parents I caught
it up for next year&amp;apos;s stock. Fearing that it might be lonely and refuse
food, I gave directions that it was to be provided with a young
Budgerigar as a companion, but my fears proved to have been only too
well justified, for I heard a few days later that the poor thing had
crouched in the corner of the cage and starved to death ! Moral :
Do not cage young Bluewings singly and without companions used to
cage life.
Things were looking bad for the success of my Bluewing experiment,
as my stock was now reduced to a single pair and the two widowed
cocks. In August the hen of the pair disappeared, and as her mate

did not seem to have much use for the society of the widowers, I hoped
that she might be sitting. The cock Bluewing, by the way, feeds his
sitting mate, like a Rosella, and does not sit on the eggs, though I think
he enters the nest at night. In September I obtained two new hens
and released them for a few weeks to get used to the place and keep the
unpaired males from straying. The rougher of the two I caught up
with her husband early the following month. At the beginning of
October the first hen reappeared and looked as though she had come
from a nest, as she was less spick and span than when I had last seen
her. From then onward she appeared with increasing frequency at the
feeding-tray. About the 10th of the month T began to hear squeaking
in the trees, which sounded fainter than and different in key from the
calls of the old birds. About the 15th I saw what I felt almost sure was
a young bird at the feeding-tray, and on the 19th I was agreeably
surprised to see nine Bluewings feeding at one time -- the two old pairs
and five young ones. On the morning of the 22nd I saw seven feeding
together -- the family as I thought -- and, fearing a sudden break in the
mild weather, I caught the lot. As I was taking them indoors a single
adult cock flew over my head, and I concluded that his mate was
starting a belated nest which it would not be wise to allow her to con-
tinue with. The seven were placed in a large cage, and left in a quiet
room to settle down, which they soon did. The cock at liberty I
captured about 11 o&amp;apos;clock and placed, for the time being, in a cage
out of doors. I expected his mate to leave her nest before evening
when he no longer came to feed her. About 2 o&amp;apos;clock, sure enough,
I heard a Bluewing calling in the trees, but the voice sounded more
like that of a young than an old bird. A little later T put the cock&amp;apos;s cage
outside in the hope of his acting as a decoy. In a few minutes, sure
enough, down came the owner of the voice -- -not an adult hen, as I
supposed, but a very hungry little cock, who unavailingly besought the
prisoner to feed him. Then I saw what had happened ; we had caught
the second hen before breakfast, and had her already in the house,
leaving the fifth youngster at liberty. He had had nothing to eat all
day, being scarcely able to feed himself and being ignorant of the exact
whereabouts of the feeding-tray. I moved the cage into an aviary
flight, and the young Bluewing soon followed, but when I went to shut

the door he popped out again by the way he had entered. I next tried
putting the wire trap feeding-tray on the top of the cage, and before
very long he was safely secured and reunited to his family. I noticed
two things in connexion with the brood ; one was that the young cocks
were already distinguishable by their blue secondaries, although their
rumps were still green, 1 and their body plumage was more like that of
the female. The other point was that the old hen fed them quite
as much as the cock, although they had been on the wing some time.
A hen Lovebird hardly feeds her offspring at all once they have flown,
speedily tiring of them, and leaving them to the care of their more
patient and affectionate father.

AUSTRALIAN AND NEW GUINEA BIRDS:
A FINE COLLECTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970987904761905" page_id="9396959"  page_num="181" year="" vol="">
The collection of Australian and New Guinea mammals and birds
sent over by the Australian Zoological Control Board reached London
on 14th November in charge of Mr. A. S. Le Souef, the Director of the
Taronga Zoological Park, Sydney. It was a wonderful collection so
far as the mammals were concerned, containing a fine lot of Kangaroos
of several species, Wombats, Bandicoots, and Phalangers.
There were also some very nice birds consisting of two species of
Birds of Paradise, the Six-plumed (Parotia lawesi) and the Magnificent
(Diphyllodes hunsteini), both species hailing from South-East New
Guinea.
Of Pigeons and Doves there were several species the most interesting
being the White-fronted Bronzewing (Henirophaps albifrons) of New
Guinea, a species never before imported alive, so far as I am aware.
It is of a slaty grey colour with bronze reflections on the wings, a white
forehead, and an extremely long bill for a pigeon. Another very
interesting as well as a very beautiful bird is the Magnificent Fruit
Pigeon (Megaloprepia magnified), of which there were some half-dozen
examples. It is leaf-green above with a grey head and purple breast.
The typical race occurs in Queensland and New South Wales. These

examples are said to have come from New Guinea, and, therefore,
probably belong to the smaller race, which has been separated under the
name of M. assimilis. Three other species of Fruit Pigeons were the
Nutmeg (Myrestivora), Orange-bellied (Ptilopus iozonus), and the Lilac-
crowned (P. coronulalus). I was greatly pleased to see a cage full of
the very beautiful Plumed Pigeons (Lophophaps leucogaster) and Naked-
eyed Partridge Pigeons {Geophaps smitki) from Northern Australia.
The former is a most delightful bird that one had not seen for many
years past. It was imported in 1905. and formed the subject of a very
charming coloured plate in the Avicultural Magazine for December,
1906. There were also a number of Australian Green-winged, Peaceful
and Bar-shouldered Doves.
Of Parrots there were Rosellas and Mealy Rosellas, Kings, Crimson-
wings, Redwings, and Cockatiels, the last two in numbers, two pairs of
Brown&amp;apos;s, and several examples of the very beautiful and rare Swift
Parrakeet (N anodes discolor). It is several years since I have seen an
example of this lovely species, though I believe a few have been
privately imported. It is vivid green in colour, with blue on the fore-
head and wings and scarlet on the face and shoulders and underneath
the wings. In its mode of feeding it closely resembles the Lorikeets,
sucking the sweet juices from the flowing eucalyptus trees and some-
times appearing in large numbers when these trees come into flower
in South-Eastern Australia and Tasmania. There were also a few of
the Yellow-vented Parrakeets of Tasmania (Platycercus flaviventris),
a species very rarely imported.
The only small birds in the collection consisted of two cages full of
Chestnut-breasted Finches and some Diamond Sparrows, but there
were several other birds more suitable for a Zoological Garden than
for the private aviculturist, such as Emus, Black Swans, Blue Water-
hens, Pheasant Coucals, White-bellied and Wedge-tailed Eagles, and
one fine example of that strange bird, the Tawny Frogmouth (Podargus)-
All the stock arrived in extremely good condition, testifying to the
great amount of care taken over them during the eight weeks&amp;apos; journey
from Sydney.

that I take to be the male is of a purer grey than the other, and is more

of the Rail family, and are reddish buff with brown and grey markings.
Is the French Government taking any steps to strictly protect this most
interesting bird in its native haunts in New Caledonia % The Australian
Government might have some turned down in a sanctuary in Australia.
Is such a wonderful bird to be exterminated ? It is a long-lived

back only, and the tail is shown longer than in my birds. One of these
birds came into partial colour after I had had it a few months, getting
the yellow areas as in the adult, but retaining the brown eclipse plumage
in the rest of the body. Tt remained like this until it was killed by a rat
about a twelve-month later. These birds built several nests in rushes
about a foot above the water, but as I was unable to get hens I was not
able to breed them.
This summer I visited Hamlyn&amp;apos;s soon after he had received a
consignment of South African birds, and amongst several other Weavers
that are unknown to me I bought one showing yellow on the back.
This bird is about the size of a Napoleon Weaver, and has now come into
full colour, being an exact reproduction of the others on a small scale.
Can this be P. copensis ? Butler gives the size of the Cape Bishop as
6 , 7 ,, in., and that of the Napoleon Weaver as 4^ in. My bird is certainly
no bigger than the Napoleon, so there is a considerable discrepancy in
the size. I am awaiting with interest to see what the others may be
when they come into colour.

Sirs, -- A friend of mine here who has had a Sepoy Finch for the past
ten years lost the bird about six weeks ago ; the bird has been recaptured
to-day (10th November) and has almost entirely recovered its geranium-
red colour, which disappeared at the first moult some twelve or thirteen
years ago. The bird had originally belonged first to Ezra then to Astley.

instead of a female Quail, that is, rejecting a natural wife (as it may be so
termed) and taking to a more-distantly related one !
When in early life I lived at Shirley, near Southampton, I had a
Canary and later on bought two Budgerigars ; and as one of the latter
died and the survivor seemed to be affectionately inclined to the Canary,
1 turned them into the same cage, where they lived amicably. They used
to have some amusing squabbles about bathing, because the Canary
(having been with us for some years before the Budgerigar arrived)
seemed to consider it had a right to bathe first ; whereas the Budgerigar
often thought to enter the bath at the same time, which occasionally
led to a squabble in the water, and the ejection of one or other bather.
They always roosted side by side. These birds lived at the time of the
European Tree Frogs, mentioned by me in the Field, 1919, p. 752, and
their cage was usually in the same room as the vivarium where the Frogs
were. The Canary never seemed to bother its head about these lively
jumpers. But the Budgerigar used at times to be apparently perplexed
in mind when one or other of .the Tree Frogs gave a sudden or extra
vigorous jump at a fly, and landed stuck on the glass. It never seemed to
understand these peculiar creatures ! Personally it seemed to me to be
more frightened for the moment than angry, and I don&amp;apos;t think it would
have ventured too near to the Tree Frogs if all had been turned out
together ! But as the Tree Frogs were special pets of mine, T never ran
any risks of injury by letting the birds approach them.
When on a tour in Yorkshire during the summer of 1904 I was
surprised to see a Crowned Crane (Balearica regulorum) of Africa, wandering
about a farmyard among domestic fowls and ducks -- all adults, so far as
I now remember -- and the owner told me it agreed well with them, and
had been living there since brought home after the Boer War. Being at
that time engaged mostly with foreign mammals in my spare time, it
did not occur to me to ask whether the Crane was reliable in conduct
with chicks of the fowls or with ducklings. Perhaps some one else can
state more about that subject. So far as I now can remember, the place
was called Pickering.
