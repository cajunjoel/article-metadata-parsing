REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1927
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965373260869565" page_id="56773053"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
It is satisfactory to be able to record that the year 1927 has been
a record in the annals of the Society. In the February number of the
Magazine will be found a Note, kindly furnished by Mrs. Prestwich,
on the last record year, 1909, when the Society's membership reached
451. The present year brings the membership up to 529.
The Magazine, under the able editorship of Mr. Seth-Smith, has now
attained a very high standard, and we have issued with this volume
ten coloured plates. We are very glad to find more members making
use of the Correspondence column of the Magazine, for it is here
that one of its chief uses may be found. We beg to tender our best
thanks to all who have helped to further the interests of the Society,
and especially we should like to mention the following who have given
coloured plates, defraying the cost of both artist's fee and reproduction
costs : Lord Tavistock (Barnardius crommelince), Mr. Ezra (Renauld's
Ground Cuckoo and the Yellow-breasted Cissa). We again offer our best
thanks to Miss Chawner for the translation from the French of many
articles, and to Mr. Newman for managing the Sale and Exchange
column, and at the same time we wish to express our appreciation of
the work done by Mr. Hicks in making post-mortem examinations of
a large number of birds sent him by our members.
(Signed for the Council) E. Maud Knobel,
Hon. Secretary and Treasurer.
December , 1927.

2. --The Avicultural Society shall consist of Ordinary and Honorary
Members, and the latter shall be restricted in number to six, and be elected by the
Council.
3. --The Officers of the Society shall be elected, annually if necessary, by
members of the Council in the manner hereinafter provided, and shall consist of

every person thus proposed, with the name of the Member proposing him, shall be

weeks after the publication of his name in the Magazine, be objected to by at least
two Members, he shall be deemed to be duly elected. If five members shall lodge
with the Secretary objections to any candidate he shall not be elected, but
the signatures to the signed objections must be verified by the Scrutineer. If
two or more Members (but less than five) shall object to any candidate, the

have been lodged (but shall not disclose the names of the objectors), and shall
request the Members to vote upon the question of the election of such candidate.
Members shall record their votes in sealed letters addressed to the Scrutineer, and

candidates be proposed by not less than fifteen Members of at least two years'
standing. Such proposal, duly seconded and containing the written consent of the
nominee to serve, if elected, in the capacity for which he is proposed, must reach
the Secretary on or before the 15th of November.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2^ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

THE WHITE-FRONTED BEE-EATER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998968571428571" page_id="56773016"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The White-fronted Bee-Eater, known to science as Melittophagus
bullockoides or albifrons, belongs to the group which has the tail neither
forked, as in the genus Dicrocercus, nor elongated as in Merops, but
square. It inhabits South Africa from Natal to the Zambesi, extending
into East Africa, and appears to be a resident species in those districts
in which it is found. Its food consists of diurnal winged insects,
especially small beetles, the wing-cases of which are subsequently
ejected.
These Bee-Eaters are said to be found near water, singly or in pairs,
perched on twigs on the look-out for insects which are always captured
on the wing. They make deep nest-holes in sand-banks, and are said
to use such holes for sleeping as well as nesting quarters.
Five specimens of this very beautiful Bee-Eater were brought
home by Mr. Webb in June last for Messrs. Gamage. They were
probably the first examples of the species to be imported to Europe.
The splendid condition in which they arrived showed Mr. Webb to be
a master in the art of caring for difficult birds, for Bee-Eaters are
certainly by no means easy birds to keep. Captain Stokes secured a
pair, of which he gave us a very interesting account last October,
and Mr. Ezra the remaining three. I was privileged to see these birds
in their owners' aviaries last summer, and more delightful birds one

2 Capt. D. S * Stokes--The Small Bird House at the Zoo
could not wish to possess. But the secret of keeping Bee-Eaters success-
fully is to be found in the ability of their owner to keep up a plentiful
supply of live insects, and this is difficult, if not impossible, during
an English winter. Mealworms, when thrown into the air, are captured
with great precision, and during the warm months of the year every
fly, bee or wasp that enters the aviary is caught and swallowed, and
a piece of meat, hidden in some shrub, will attract an endless supply
of blue-bottles. But when winter comes the difficulty commences.
Having fed during the summer months on an abundant supply of live
food, these birds do not readily take to artificial food and, unless fed
four or five times a day with mealworms, will probably come to grief.
And it is a question whether mealworms alone will maintain any
bird in health indefinitely. Bee-Eaters have not often been kept
in captivity, so we have very little experience to go upon. In the
Zoological Gardens a pair of Australian Bee-Eaters (Merops ornatus),
obtained in the spring of 1911, lived in splendid health throughout
the summer in an outdoor aviary. They were taken into the Small
Bird House for the winter, which they survived, and again spent
the summer of 1912 in the outside aviary, but both died in the autumn
of that year.

THE SMALL BIRD HOUSE AT THE ZOO
By Capt. D. S. Stokes
The pleasant winter task of reading through the Avicultural
Magazine for the last twenty years brings to mind that whereas a
good deal was written in former days about bird-keeping at the Zoo,
little has recently appeared on the subject in the Magazine. And as
the Small Bird House at present contains a very choice collection of
birds, some remarks may not be inopportune.
In the first place let no one think they can't keep birds there. They
can and do. You can see a Jackson's Whydah which has come gaily
into colour for eighteen years, a Golden Hangnest caged eleven years,
and many other old friends.
It is, of course, primarilv an exhibition in which as many species

as possible are displayed for the pleasure of fellows and the genera]
public, so that the birds are very numerous, though not crowded.
And if at the end of the day the cages look dirty and untidy it does not
mean they are not properly kept. When Shamahs are fed on showers of
monkey nuts, when Toucans are proffered buns complete with paper
bag by a well-meaning public, how can tidiness be maintained ? Bather
let us be thankful that the birds do not die of fits from such misguided
attentions. No ; but go into the bird house in the early morning (if
they will let you), when feeding and cleaning operations are in progress,
and you will see the care and attention that all the birds receive. Every
cage and aviary is scraped and swabbed and sponged as clean as a
new pin ; the food is of the best, and by eleven o'clock all is ready for
the visitors. And here let me acknowledge a debt of gratitude I ow^e
to all the people responsible for the birds. However busy they may be,
however silly the questions I ask, the three keepers, Tanner, Eaggett,
and Woods, are always kind and attentive and helpful. To return to
the birds ; pre-eminent is the series of Paradises. There are now eight
species of these, all the fruits of Mr. Goodfellow's two recent trips to
New Guinea. For rarity and splendour the Prince Eudolph's or Blue
Bird takes pride of place. Its lovely turquoise back and wings are but
a prelude to the glorious opal plumes, like filmy seaweed, which are to
follow when the bird shall reach maturity. The Princess Stephanie's
was recently illustrated in these pages ; there are a pair of Greater,
a splendid red-plumed Eaggi's, a Hunstein's Magnificent, a King Bird,
and a Lesser Superb with wondrous pectoral shield, who will display
almost for the asking, changing himself from a bird into a catherine-
wheel of black velvet and emerald and aquamarine, and riveting
your attention by a loud whacking noise mysteriously made by some
movement of the legs and tail. There is a Wallace's Paradise, discovered
in 1858, and described in that great book The Malay Archipelago ,
but never till now imported alive. At first sight it is an ugly bird, but
doubtless wonderful in display. More plainly coloured than the rest
of the tribe, it has a large green pectoral fan and from each shoulder two
long cream pennants which can be raised at any angle.
The Toucans are there in force. A Toco from Guiana with incredibly
huge orange beak spotted with black, replaces the late lamented

i( &amp;apos; Billy ", the well-known Toco from Wembley, who used to fly loose
in the British Guiana section.
There are three Red-billed, two Ariel, three Green-billed, and a
Sulphur-breasted which has never looked otherwise than perfect for the
last seven years.
Hornbills come next in four species ; the White-crested from West
Africa, like an old lady with a lace cap and black brocaded dress, the
Black and White, the Undulated from Sumatra, and the Great Indian
Hornbilh He is the largest bird in the house, an ungainly creature of
some 4 feet, wearing a cardboard fireman's helmet and appropriately
called 44 Baby ", but gentle as a lamb. With his huge bill he will take
a grape as delicately as you could wish from between your lips, swallow
it, and then even offer it to you again if he likes you.
Barbets include a Lineated, a Javan Great-billed, a handsome
species with yellowish green head and a red throat, and a very attractive
small one called the Crimson-breasted, known in India as the Copper-
smith.
Of Touracos there are a Violaceous Plantain-eater, recently brought
from the Gambia by Dr. Hopkinson, a Frazer's, some Donaldsons, and
some White-breasted, demure grey and white people, lacking the lovely
colours of other races of Touracos. Rollers include the Blue-breasted,
a beautiful species from Gambia, some European, Indian, and Senegal,
as well as an Indian Broad-billed. The lovely Long-tailed South African
is not at present represented, but the last specimen lived six years.
Other interesting occupants of cages or indoor aviaries include
Bengal Pittas, Guira Cuckoos, and a Solitary Cuckoo from Africa,
Verreaux's Amethyst Starlings, some Chats, and two species of'
&amp;apos;Sugarbirds.
Tanagers are not as well represented as in years gone by, but rare
species seem to come over so seldom. However, there are the
Desmarest's, green with a red head, the Yellow, the Superb, and one
or two other small ones, and among larger species two very beautiful
White-capped Tanagers. Birds of deep indigo blue, shading up to white
on the head, in the midst of which is a crimson blotch. Living in the
five central flight cages are birds arranged more or less by size. Two
of small Finches include a Blue-billed Weaver, a Hooded Siskin, Red-

crested Finches, and Parrot Finches of two species. Of larger soft-bills
there are a Eegent Bird, Bine Bobins, Indian Great Reedwarbler, a
Coach-whip bird from Australia, numerous Bulbuls and Babblers, and
a very attractive Glossy Calornis from New Guinea, green with brilliant
ruby eyes and beautiful copper and purple reflections on the head and
back. There are also superb Spreos and Royal Starlings from Abyssinia.
The five southern aviaries with outdoor flights contain a large mixed
collection. In one a Stilt from South America, a Blacksmith Plover from
South Africa, very smart in plumage of grey and black and white, and
Yellow-backed Whydahs. The next compartment has Roulrouls,
a wonderful ground Pigeon called the Grey-naped, as large as a Pheasant
and of similar shape and gorgeous colouring ; Pied Grallinas, which
built a nest and laid eggs, beautiful Spreos, and a pair of Regent Birds.
Fruit Pigeons come next, though only three species are represented
at present.
Another compartment has a pair of Sun Bitterns, and a Wood Thrush
from North America, and the last contains various Bulbuls, Cedar Birds,
Baltimore Hangnests, a Hermit Thrush, and Red-collared Whydahs.
Altogether the collection numbers close on a thousand birds, truly
a Mecca for aviculturists. The very noises are a delight to me. The
yapping bark of the Toucans, the crow of the Touracos, the ringing
wauk-wauk of the Greater Paradises and the silly Mynahs imploring
you to tell the time. The house is condemned to be pulled down to
make way for the large new ape and monkey house, and the birds are to
be transferred to the old reptile house, where, let us hope, the authorities
will provide as good quarters and as attractive a display as we have
at present.

The Ivory-billed Woodpecker (Campophilus principalis) is in size,
though hardly in beauty, the Prince of Woodpeckers ; its length ranges
from 19 to 21 inches. .It is found in Western Mexico, north along the
Sierra Madre.

James B. Housden--American Bird Gossip
The Ivory-billed is rare, almost restricted to the extreme southern
states, especially those bordering the Gulf of Mexico. It is of a wild
and wary disposition, making its home in the dark swampy woodlands,
the dense cypress swamps of Florida being among its favourite haunts.
The nest of the Ivory-bill is built in a hollow excavated in a tree,
from 30 to 40 feet from the ground, the cavity often being nearly 2 feet
in depth. Three or more eggs are laid.
This bird does not remain long in one place, and during the day
ranges over an extended territory. Its call, " Yap-yap-yap " sounds
in the distance like the note of a small trumpet.
All Woodpeckers are of value to cultivators and farmers, two-
thirds of their food consisting of insects, chiefly noxious wood-boring
beetles, both adults and larvae, caterpillars, mostly species that burrow
into trees, and ants, which are particularly harmful to timber. In
Mexico I found countless swarms of both red and black ants every-
where and was not able to sit down and rest on any fallen tree. One day
I put my hand into a very beautiful nest--found no eggs, but my
hand covered with ants. In one of the gateposts on the plantation
a pair of English Sparrows had reared young ones ; their last nest of
young ones I found all dead, killed by the ants.
The Downy Woodpecker (Dryabates pubescens) is the smallest of all
those inhabiting the Gulf States. I met with it almost everywhere,
it being very sociable in its habits, far more so than other species,
and often found in company with the White-breasted Nuthatch and
the Brown Creeper.
Early in the spring the " Downies " seek out their nesting places.
Their holes are usually excavated in dead willow-, poplar-, or oak-trees.
The entrance to the nest is about 2 inches in diameter, and the depth
of the nest hole varies from 8 to 12 inches. The eggs are four or five,
sometimes six in number, and are pure glossy white.
The Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) is one of
the most beautiful of the twenty-five species of American Woodpeckers.
This bird is known in many parts as the " Zebra Bird ", from the
black and white markings of the back and tail; head and breast scarlet
in the male ; the female only partly so.
The Blue-grey Gnatcatcher ( Polioptila ccerulea) is found almost

everywhere in the southern states, inhabiting chiefly open, high woods,
skipping and darting about among the topmost branches of the trees,
his long tail elevated and jerking in Wren-like fashion, always moving
about and ever uttering his wheezy squeaky notes.
This bird is a most beautiful nest builder ; the nest, in fact, having
few equals. It is rather a frail structure, usually built on the small
horizontal limbs of trees, generally at an elevation of about 10 to 20 feet
The interior is deeply cupped, and the exterior is beautifully ornamented
with lichens. The eggs are four or five in number, greenish or bluish
white, speckled with chestnut.
The Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) is one of the largest of the
Warblers, often called the Yellow Mocking-bird. In the mating season
he is the noisiest bird in the woods. At this time he may be observed in
his wonderful aerial evolutions, dangling his legs and flirting his tail,
singing all the while a sweet song. He imitates the mewing of a cat,
the barking of a dog, and other sounds, and in the variety of his notes
he is surpassed only by the Mocking-bird. The song is often heard on
bright moonlight nights. This bird migrates in winter to Eastern Mexico
and Northern Central America.
The cheerful little Phoebe is found nearly everywhere, and known
also as the Pewee, Barn Pewee, and Pewit Flycatcher. There are few
plantations or farmyards without a pair of Pewees. It is a familiar,
confiding, and gentle bird (something like our English Bobin), attached
to localities and returning to them year after year.
Its nest is found in sheltered situations, such as under a bridge, a
projecting rock, in the proch of a house, etc. I found one nest with young
in the main street of a small town in the Southern Kockies, built by an
open window in full view of the family, quite unmoved by the presence of
the latter at mealtimes. In New Mexico I found another nest built in
a house on one of the rafters ; a cat took possession of this nest and
broke all the eggs, so I brought home the nest.
Motmots are peculiar to the new world, being found from Mexico
throughout the whole of Central America and the South American
continent. The general plumage is green, and the majority of the species
have large racquets at the end of the central tail feathers.
The Mexican Motmot is locally known as the Houton. To observe

this beautiful bird in his native haunts one must be in the forest at
dawn. The thick and gloomy forests are preferred by the Houton.
In the far-extending wilds, about day-break, you hear him call in
distinct tones " Houton, Houton ! " his tail moving from side to side
like a pendulum every time he calls. He makes no nest, but rears his
young in a hole in the sand, generally on the side of a hill.
The Purple Martin, with glossy violet black plumage, known also
as the Purple Swallow, American Martin, and Violet Swallow, is very
plentiful in the southern and many other states, wintering in Mexico
and the Bermudas. No bird is more deserving of protection and of
encouragement to live about the habitations of man than the
Purple Martin. One pair will destroy vast quantities of insects in the
season. Little nesting-boxes are fixed on the tops of poles for the
Martins. I saw many of these when travelling through the Middle
States to South-West Texas. One may see calabashes hung up by
Indians, also a hollow gourd attached to a pole near a negro hut ; the
nesting-box on our plantation was often the scene of disputes between
the Martins and the English Sparrows.
Bullock's Oriole ( Icterus bullocki), one of the most handsome of the
Orioles, is found in Mexico all through the year. It is very plentiful
in the rolling prairie country traversed here and there by small streams
fringed with groves of cotton-wood trees. I found some very beautiful
nests when camping on the banks of the Gila River, North Mexico.
It is also found in Southern Arizona and Western Texas, and frequently
builds in bunches of mistletoe growing on the mesquite-tree. The
genus of American Orioles or Hangnests ( Icterus ) contains about forty
species, the greater number being natives of Central and South America.
The plumage of nearly all the species is more or less coloured with shades
of yellow, orange, and black.
Audubon's Oriole ( Icterus auduboni ) is another beautiful bird
found in Texas. .It is more numerous in the valley of the Rio Grande
and southward in Mexico to Oaxaca. It is more common in central and
eastern Mexico than in any other part of its range. In the summer it
frequents the denser forests of its Texas home, but during the winter
months it will approach the inhabited regions.
It is said that these beautiful birds (with other Hangnests) are

frequently called upon to become the foster-parents of other birds,
and in the forest near the plantation I found a beautiful nest containing
seven eggs, two of these belonging to the Red-eyed Cowbird (Molothms).
The Baltimore Oriole (Icterus Baltimore) is locally known as the
Golden Robin and Hangnest Bird.
There is a story to the effect that when, in 1628, Lord Baltimore
was exploring in America, worn out and discouraged, he w T as so much
cheered by the sight and sound of the Oriole that he adopted its colours
as his own, hence the name " Baltimore Oriole This bird is fond of
building near the habitations of men. He weaves artistic habitations
in lofty trees, choosing strong flexible material for the pendant bag-
like nest, the strongest and best material being used for the part by which
the whole is suspended. A native boy brought me a very beautiful
nest, but I was sorry to find he had accidentally broken all the eggs in
descending the tall tree in which he found it.
The Orioles are very fond of unripe maize. We had a mealy
patch " on the plantation, and I have often watched these beautiful
birds feeding on the soft cobs.
The San Pedro Park (San Antonio), with natural springs and blue
lagoons, an old camping ground of the Comanchees, contains a large
number of wesach-trees, under which the Indians encamped in days of
old ; a most delightful spot for Humming Birds and many others.
The nest of the Hummers I have mentioned in an earlier chapter
was blown out of the tree during a storm, both nest and young being-
destroyed.
I have many happy memories of the four months spent on my
journey, bird life everywhere was wonderful; one could write much
more of the many species found in Texas and the Gulf States, New
Mexico, and Mexico.

By the Marquess of Tavistock and M. Delacour
The group of the Palceornithince contains several species of Parrots
and Parrakeets, which vary greatly both in size and shape. Some are
large and have fairly short, square tails : others on the contrary have
very long and slender tails ; while there are yet others which are very
small and short-tailed.
Nearly all are seed-eaters. They are generally very handsome
birds, with the plumage differing according to sex. They live well
and some breed freely in an aviary. They are found in Asia, Africa,
and Oceania.

Eclectus Parrots
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999442136363636" page_id="56772980"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
The Eclectus Parrots are remarkable for the extraordinary difference
in colour of the sexes. The male is fine shining green, with red sides,
the wings and tail having blue markings, and the upper mandible
being red ; the female is red, with part of the back and wings, breast
and belly blue ; the tail is tipped with yellow and the beak is black.
On the whole the hen is far showier than the cock. Both sexes are
very handsome, but with their large bodies and short tails they are
not elegantly shaped, and they are inclined to be dull and morose
in confinement.
But it must also be allowed that when thoroughly tame they are
often very docile and affectionate and can be taught to say a few words.
Their voice, which luckily is rarely heard, is the most powerful and
unpleasant imaginable, and completely eclipses that of a Macaw or
Cockatoo at its worst. The hen often lays in confinement and has
sometimes reared her brood successfully.
The Eclectus Parrots, except when nesting, are gentle and harmless
with other birds, but male and female, unless they know one another,
do not agree if caged together. They will live on a seed mixture of
two parts canary, one part oats, one of hemp, one of sunflower, with
monkey nuts and plenty of ripe fruit. They should be allowed to
bathe. When they are kept in a cage, they should be let out every day
for exercise, but they do better in an indoor or outdoor aviary.

Eclectus Parrots are very susceptible to cold on first arrival and need
warmth and care ; when acclimatized and in an aviary, they only
need heat in winter. They are very subject to contagious diseases,
and their abode must be kept perfectly clean, and they should never
be associated with any doubtfully healthy bird. They do not stay
well, and cannot be trusted at liberty.
All the species and varieties require the same treatment. Six
have been imported, often under the name of " Lories
Eclectus pectomlis from Papua is the species already described ;
it is frequently imported.
Eclectus roratus from the Moluccas (Halmaheira) also arrives pretty
frequently. It may be known from the above by the male being
slightly more yellowish green ; the female is red, with nape, mantle,
chest and belly purplish violet.
E. cardinalis from Amboina, Ceram and Bourou is small and
darker. E. westermani, E. riedeli, and E. Cornelia, all very similar, have
likewise been imported.

The Tanygnathus Parrakeets are nearly related to the Eclectus ;
the differences of plumage between the two sexes are, however, less
striking. Two species have been occasionally imported and two others
very rarely.
Mueller's Parrakeet (T. muelleri) from the Celebes is a fine yellowish
green : the wings are vividly marked with blue and yellow. The male
has a red beak, the female's is white, she is also not so brilliantly
coloured. They should be given two parts of canary seed to one of
hemp and one of sunflower, with monkey nuts and plenty of fruit.
It is exceptional for one of these Parrots to show intelligence or
affection for its owner ; as a rule they are dull, silent, stupid and
uninteresting in captivity, though they are long-lived. Probably they
are not happy, and have quite a different temperament when at liberty,
as is shown in the case of an allied species, the G-reat-billed Parrot.
Mueller's Parrakeet needs heat at first, but afterwards is satisfied
with protection from wind and damp. They are peaceful in disposition.

uninteresting when caged, but when allowed its liberty its peculiar
appearance and strange call, together with the bright colours of the male,
render it attractive. It is a native of New Guinea and the vicinity ; the
male is a beautiful green with wings delicately and beautifully marked
with blue and yellow ; the beak is red. The female is decidedly smaller
and duller, with blue only on the rump and the marking on her wings
is less distinct. This Parrot should be released at the beginning of
summer with one wing clipped; it is fairly hardy, but should be watched
in frosty or snowy weather. This species is destructive to fruit when at
liberty and it may be necessary to shut it up while the apples are
ripening. Individuals have paired with Alexandrine Parrakeets.
They should have the same food as Mueller's Parrot. When they are
at liberty, both sexes, on fine hot days, indulge in an extraordinary
sort of " song " accompanying it with absurd movements, most
comical to watch. The courting of the female by the male is likewise
very amusing ; he leaps into the air with strange cries.
T. luzonensis from the Philippines has blue and yellow wings
and the top of the head is blue.
T. everetti, also a native of the Philippines, has a green head and
blue markings on the wings mingled with yellow.

<bodyText confidence="0.997056928571428" page_id="56772982"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
The Racquet-tailed Parrots ( Prioniturus ) are known by the
two spathulate tips of their middle rectrices. These are " difficult "
birds : that is to say, they die for no apparent reason, even with the
most careful treatment. They should be given canary seed, hemp,
millet, oats, sunflower seed, monkey nuts and fruit.
Both sexes have these curious spathulated feathers from which
they derive their name but in other respects their plumage may be very
different.
I have found this Parrot a gentle bird, but have never owned a
pair in breeding condition ; there was once a tame and gentle hen bird
at the Zoological Gardens of London, and an adult pair was imported
in the autumn of 1926.
The most freely imported species, though even this is very rare,
is P. platurus from the Celebes. The male is bright green, with a red-

blue. The female has neither red nor grey, and her racquets are
shorter.
Some years ago I had a pair of these birds. As they came over
during winter I kept them in a well-warmed room. They moulted
successfully but the hen died of aspergillosis some weeks later. The
male bird was turned into an aviary when summer came, but in a few
months he died of the same complaint. Had the aviary been movable
they would probably have done better. They were pretty birds of
agreeably soft and unusual colouring.

<bodyText confidence="0.998159833333333" page_id="56772983"  page_num="13" year="" vol="">
The Long-tailed Parrakeets (Palceornis) have given their
name to their whole group. They are well-known birds with very
long narrow tails and fairly well developed heads and beaks ; almond
green predominates in the plumage of most of them. They are chiefly
Asiatic. Some are extremely beautiful, and nearly all do well in cage
or aviary. They become very tame and often learn to speak a few words
and to do tricks. Males are to be preferred to females, being more
gentle and prettier. Parrakeets do not like to be handled, but unlike
the Platycerci they become very much attached to their owner. Un-
fortunately many are noisy. Their food should consist of a seed mixture
of two parts of canary, one of hemp, one of sunflower, with monkey
nuts and plenty of all kinds of fruit; they do not care much for green
stuff.
The Ring-necked Parrakeet (P. torquata) which is found from
Baluchistan to Cochin China, is of medium size, almond green, with a
double black and pink collar and red beak. Hens and young birds
are green all over and have no collar and no dark spot under the beak.
They do not acquire full adult colouring until the third year, but they
will breed while still in immature plumage.
The Ring-necked Parrakeet does well both in cage and aviary
and goes readily to nest, but in close confinement the eggs are often
clear. Once acclimatized it is very hardy and may be wintered out
of doors, but the young need more care than the adults in the way
of shelter from wind and damp.

Outside the breeding season the male and female show no affection
for each other : the females, indeed, are often so spiteful that it is
unsafe to leave the males with them.
This species nests twice a year when at liberty, but this does not
often happen in confinement. It often breeds very early, in February
or March. It is not as quarrelsome as the Australian Parrakeets,
but when she is nesting the female is sometimes dangerous to other birds.
Young birds reared together generally agree pretty well when adult, but
if they are not separated into pairs they may destroy each other's
young. In an aviary they damage all exposed woodwork. The Ring-
neck is decidedly capricious in its behaviour when at liberty, and its
size is not sufficient to protect it altogether from attacks by Owls.
Some specimens are good stayers ; others stay for some time and then
take their departure ; others have no idea of staying and stray at once.
A pair which mean to stay usually find a hole to breed in if there are
old trees about. Their flight is pretty and graceful: even their cries,
which are unbearable in a house, are rather agreeable than otherwise
in the open. They are not destructive to trees, but are prone to eat
too many apples. They should be let out when they are hungry, or
the male bird may first be released by himself during the nesting
season, when he feels affection for his mate and does not want to go
away from her aviary.
Tame cocks will talk quite well and can be taught all kinds of
tricks. Yellow, cream coloured, variegated and blue varieties appear
occasionally, and are very handsome. The yellows are usually hens
and are just as hardy and prolific as normally coloured birds.
The African Ring-necked Parrakeet (P. docilis) only differs
from the Indian Ring-neck in having a blackish beak, and has exactly
similar habits. It is found from Senegal to Abyssinia.
The Alexandrine Parrakeet (P. nepalensis ), which inhabits
North and Central India, resembles the preceding in both sexes and to
all ages, but is just about twice as large and has a red bar on the
shoulder. The Alexandrine Parrakeet is very hardy and is like the
Ring-neck in its ways. It is more gentle, however, and is one of the most
inoffensive Parrots, never hurting smaller birds, and rather letting
itself be bullied by its companions. It is, however, apt to be a nuisance

in an aviary as it destroys the woodwork very quickly ; also the
perches and even the wise netting if they he not sufficiently strong.
When at liberty it behaves like the Indian Ring-neck, but is large
enough to be safe from owls. It likes to gnaw branches, but does not
do a lot of damage, as it prefers the larger and commoner trees. The
Alexandrine does well in a cage, will learn to say a few words, and
becomes very fond of its owner. Occasionally one comes across very
beautiful yellow or blue individuals.
There are several sub-species of this bird which have been imported :
P. eupatria from Ceylon, which is smaller ; P. indo-burmanica from
Burma and Cambodia ; P. magnirostris from the Andaman Isles,
which has a larger beak. They all have the same habits as the
Alexandrine, and are very often mistaken for it.
Another species was formerly imported, but now is all but extinct,
from the Mauritius, P. eques , like the Ring-neck, only larger and a
darker green.
The Plum-headed Parrakeet (P. cyanocephala) is one of the
prettiest members of the family and would command a high price
were it not so freely imported. It is a native of India and Ceylon.
It is rather small and its body is a slightly yellowish green, with a
purple head passing into violet blue at the back, and there is a black
collar edged with greenish blue; the very long tail and the wings
are shaded with yellow and pale blue ; it has a red bar on the shoulders,
the beak is yellow and black. Hens and young birds have lavender
coloured heads and no red on the shoulders. There does not seem to
be any reason why hens should be so scarce, but among fifty lots not
even one hen may be present.
It is a hardy species and will nest readily, in a cage as well as in an
aviary. It is not noisy, and in the nesting season the cock utters a
kind of whistle, which at all events in the open air is quite musical.
It does not often gnaw or spoil the shrubs in its aviary. It does not
stay well when at liberty. Yellow individuals are sometimes found,
with more or less rose-coloured heads.
It requires the same food and treatment as the Ring-necked
Parrakeet.

Blossomhead in Burma and Indo-China. It is slightly smaller and has
a pretty lilac rose-coloured head. The hen als(R) has red on the shoulders.
Lutinos sometimes occur. Its habits are the same as the above-
mentioned.
The Slaty-headed Parrakeet (P. schisticeps) from the Himalayas
is larger, has a longer tail, and its head is a pretty deep violaceous grey,
beak red. The sexes are alike. P. finschi from Burma and Indo-China
is somewhat more yellowish. Both kinds are very pretty, but rare in
captivity.
The Malabar Parrakeet (P. peristeroides) from Southern India
is one of the prettiest, only too rarely imported. Its head, back, and
breast are a beautiful ashen grey with a black collar bordered with
greeny&amp;apos;blue, and there is some green round the eye ; the wings and tail
are bluish green, the beak red. The hen has a black beak and no
bluey green round her black collar.
This is a hardy species if provided with a shelter against wind and
rain, but, like all the King-neck family, goes early to nest, and if the
hen is allowed to lay in cold weather she generally dies of egg binding.
To rear these Parrakeets one must either give them a heated shelter,
or not provide them with a log before the middle of April. Malabars
are noisy and do not thrive in a cage. They should have the same
treatment as the Ring-neck.
Layard's Parrakeet (P. calthropce) is a rare and pretty species
from Ceylon, which may easily be recognized by its lavender-grey
head, violet-grey mantle and rump and tail of the same tipped yellowish
green. The under parts and the wings are green, beak red. The hen
has a black beak. Its great drawback is its piercing and monotonous
call, which is intolerable in a house. An old male which I have is tame,
amiable and inoffensive to other birds. He is always at liberty and
does not attempt to go away, but this doubtless is because he is so
tame. This is a delicate species when it first comes over and requires
heat and care, but once acclimatized can winter outside. It should be
fed and treated like the King-neck, and is very fond of fruit.
The Derbyan Parrakeet (P. derbyana) from China is a large
bird ; it is green, with a grey head, a wide black band round the
neck and a violet breast, the male has a red beak, the female a black one.

This species would probably prove as hardy as the other members
of its family.
The Moustache Parrakeet (P. fasciata) is freely imported into
Europe. Of medium size, it has a large beak, and a rather short tail,
and it is not elegantly shaped. It is green shading into yellow, with
a grey head, a large black moustache and a rosy lilac breast. The male
has a red beak ; the female a black one. Young birds have green
breasts. The species is found from the Himalayas to Tonkin. It
is a hardy and prolific species, but noisy and aggressive. It does
well at liberty but has little to recommend it as a cage bird. Young
birds in their intermediate plumage are often sold as rarities. Food
and treatment should be the same as for the Ring-neck.
The Javan Parrakeet (P. alexandri) only differs from the above
in being smaller ; the female has a red beak, which makes it hard to
distinguish the sexes except by the more feminine look of the hen.
I had a pair which nested several times but did not rear the young.
This hen always finished the nesting season by starting to murder
the male. This pair seemed to feel the cold and could not stand the
winter out of doors.
The Grey-headed Parrakeet (P. canicejps) from the Nicobar
islands only differs from the Moustache Parrakeet in its larger size
and in the absence of pink on the breast.
The Modest Parrakeet (P. modesta ) from Sumatra is also rather
large; it is green with a black moustache ; the cheeks and nape are
bright rose colour and the crown is reddish and the breast brown ;
the beak is red.
The Nicobar Parrakeet (P. nicobarica) is like it but has a green
breast and green crown to the head.
Tytler's Parrakeet (P. tytleri) from the Andaman Islands, is a
near relative, rather smaller, with a back less tinged with yellow.
All these three species are rare and susceptible to cold as are also
the following :--
The Malaccan Parrakeet (P. longicauda) is a delightful bird,
rather small, having a very long tail. Its colours are a beautiful light
green, cheeks and nape bright rose ; it has a large black moustache
and the crown of the head is deep green. The large wing and tail

feathers are blue, as well as the middle of the back. The beak is red.
The female is a little less brilliant and has a black beak. It eats the
same food as the Ring-neck, but it feels cold more than any other
Parrakeet. It requires a temperature of not less than 70*, and is likely
to die should it fall below 60*, for which reason we cannot hope to
keep and breed it in this climate unless in a specially constructed and
heated room as for Humming Birds. It is a native of the Malay
Peninsula and Sumatra.
The Blue-rumped Parrakeet
Here should be placed a very pretty little Malayan Parrakeet,
Psittinus incertus, which is rarely imported. It has a short tail and
large head. The head and neck are grey blue ; back dark grey, rump
bright blue, wings variegated with green, blue, yellow, and red, tail
green ; the under parts are olive tinged with grey blue, the beak red.
The female has a green back and brown head. It is decidedly delicate
and must be kept very warm. It should be fed like a Lovebird with
the addition of plenty of fruit.
The Lovebirds
The Lovebirds (Agapornis) make up a small family of miniature
Parrots, natives of Africa. In size they are about the same as or a
trifle larger than a Sparrow. They have short, broad tails. They
thrive and breed freely in aviaries, but do not live long in a cage.
Some species are quarrelsome among themselves, and pairs should not
be kept together. Some have a curious habit of lining their nests
with strips of fine bark which they put on their backs between their
wings ; in this way they sometimes carry quite a load.
The Grey-headed Lovebird (A. cana) from Madagascar is the
best known in Europe. The sexes are easily distinguished, the hen being
green, lightly washed with olive all over and paler underneath, while
the cock has a pale grey head and neck. Young cocks may be recognized
from the first although they are greener than adults. This Lovebird
goes readily to nest: the hen bird lines her nest with strips of bark
or little twigs.
They should be fed on millet, canary, and hemp, and some green
stuff. The males are fairly peaceful with other birds, but the females

are very spiteful and dangerous to weaker birds. Grey-beaded Love-
birds may be bred at liberty during tbe summer, but they are not
entirely bardy, and as a rule cannot winter in tbe open : if they are
exposed to much cold they are apt to contract an incurable disease
of tbe lungs.
The Peach- or Rosy-faced Lovebird (A. roseicollis) from South-
East Africa is a charming bird, rather larger than tbe above. Its
colour is a pretty almond green, paler below, with tbe front of tbe
crown, tbe cheeks and tbe throat a pretty rose colour which gradually
merges into tbe green ; all tbe lower back and tbe rump are light
blue ; tbe tail is green, mingled with blue and red ; tbe beak is ivory
white, greenish at tbe tip. Tbe sexes are similar, but tbe male has
perhaps a slightly larger expanse of rose colour on bis bead. This
is a very free-breeding species, but is spiteful towards its own kind
as well as with other birds. It is quite useless to try and keep two pairs
together. Feeding and general treatments should be tbe same as given
to tbe preceding species ; like tbe Madagascar, this bird is not altogether
bardy, and only certain individuals can pass tbe winter in tbe open air.
Although it does not always stay well, the Peach-faced Lovebird
can be kept at liberty ; it is necessary to accustom it thoroughly to
an artificial type of nest before releasing it, as in a natural state it is
said to use tbe nests of tbe sociable Weaver Bird and it does not find
nesting places readily in an English garden.
The Red-faced Lovebird (A. jpullaria) from West Africa is smaller
than tbe preceding species, grass green with forehead, cheeks, and
throat vermilion orange-red ; beak also red. Tbe lower back blue
and tbe tail marked with red. Tbe male has much more red on bis face
and is brighter than tbe female. Although often delicate and susceptible
to cold when first imported, this Lovebird is quite bardy when
acclimatized and can stand bad weather. It does not breed freely,
even under tbe best conditions ; it does well at liberty and can be left
out through tbe winter provided Owls are not too numerous. It should
have tbe same food as tbe preceding species, with tbe addition of a
little apple.
The Abyssinian Lovebird (A. taranta) is rather large ; it is
brilliant green with part of tbe wings and tail black. Tbe male has part

of the head carmine red, but the head of the female is green. Both
sexes have red beaks and the young resemble the female. Until
quite recently this was an exceedingly rare bird in Europe, but it
had once been bred. Lately it has been imported in large quantities.
It seems inclined to go to nest, but is very quarrelsome with its own
kind. It should be treated like the Grey-headed Lovebird.
The Black-cheeked Lovebird (A. nigrigenis) from Bhodesia
was only discovered some years ago. It has recently been imported
in large numbers and proved an excellent aviary bird, very hardy
and very prolific. Several pairs can be kept together and agree like
Budgerigars. This little Lovebird has black cheeks and is rather
dark green elsewhere, paler underneath ; the points of the wings are
black ; the head and neck are brownish green, and the face is brown;
the eye has a white circle round it, the beak is pink, deeper in colour
towards the tip. Its breast is a pretty tawny orange. Male, female,
and young are alike. It should be fed like the Grey-headed Lovebird;
it uses the green bark of trees as well as hay and straw to line its nest,
but it is wise not to let it nest during winter months.
The Black-cheeked Lovebird cannot be kept at liberty because
it is a migrant and departs in August after it has stayed for some
time and bred.
The Nyasa Lovebird (A. liliance) is a very recent importation.
It is rather like a small Peach-face with a green rump and a white circle
round the eye. It seems remarkably hardy and prolific, and resembles
the Black-cheeked Lovebird in disposition.
Two rare species of Lovebirds have recently been imported to
America, and went through London. Both live on the highlands of
the Tanganyika ; one, A. per sonata, somehow resemble the Black-
cheeked Lovebird, but has a dark brown head with a definite yellow
collar ; the other, A. finschi, is larger and resemble the Peach-faced
Lovebird, but has an orange red head.

tongues are not furnished with brushes. They have a curious custom
of sleeping head downward hanging by their claws.
They are to be found in tropical Asia and Oceania, and are seldom
imported and not much sought after by amateurs. It cannot be
denied that they are difficult to keep, but they are not very difficult
to feed and their voices are not unpleasant; they are inoffensive
with other birds and their habits are interesting, and when in good
condition their plumage is exquisite, making the prettiest Lovebird
appear coarse. All who do not fear the trouble of keeping " difficult "
birds should try to obtain Hanging Parrakeets.
The stock food is banana mixed with an equal quantity of crushed
sponge cake, ripe fruit, canary seed, and a few mealworms. A shallow
bath should be hung on the wires of their cage, and the Hanging
Parrakeets rarely descend to the ground. They are delicate when
first introduced and always remain subject to enteritis and pneumonia,
yet when acclimatized they can stand a little frost without suffering.
They should be taken in about the middle of October and pass the winter
either in a sunny heated aviary or in a large cage, which must be kept
scrupulously clean and protected from draughts and changes of
temperature.
It is not easy to detect the first symptoms of illness in a Hanging
Parrakeet, for they breathe heavily at all times, and when sleepy raise
their head feathers and half close their eyes. One of the chief difficulties
with them comes from their trouble with wire netting : they climb
it easily, but when they want to fly they are hung up as if their claws
were too long ; the result is that they lose their equilibrium, dash
against something and hurt themselves. I lost many in this way,
and was eventually obliged to keep their aviary lined with string
netting and to cover all the wooden parts with soft stuff. Every
effort should be made to prevent their claws from getting overgrown.
The Vernal Hanging Parrakeet (L . vernalis ) from India and
Indo-China is green with a red rump, the throat and under the tail
pale blue. The sexes are alike. Some of our specimens are more slender
and have darker eyes than the others. One of the larger, lighter-eyed
individuals took an interest in a log. The autopsy showed that it was
a female. L. jpusillus from Java has a yellow spot on the throat, and

L. flosculus from Timor has the nape tinted orange and an elongated
red spot on the throat. Except for these differences they resemble
L. vernalis . L. chrysonotus from Cebu (in the Philippines) is green
with red forehead and rump, the crown, nape of the neck, and the upper
part of the back yellow, and a red spot on the breast. L. pJiilippinensis
from Luzon has a red spot on the head, another on the nape, and a
larger one on the throat is orange; the rump is red. All these species
have only been very occasionally imported.
The Ceylon Hanging Parrakeet (L. indicus) is pale green with
a red rump, and in the male a red spot on the head. It is fairly often
imported.
The Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeet ( L . galgulus) is one of the
prettiest and most freely imported. It has a black beak, differing from
all the species hitherto described, which have yellowish red beaks.
The young, with dull and often soiled plumage, are not very attractive
on arrival, but an adult male clad in bright green with an intensely
blue spot on the crown of his head and throat and rump of dazzling
red, reminds one of a tropical flower when he hangs up by his feet and
the sun shines on him. The female has no red throat and scarcely
any blue on her head.
Those which I have are pretty quarrelsome among themselves and
with their relations ; but are harmless to little birds and seem rather
afraid even of Waxbills. The courtship of the male is pretty and
strange : he runs rapidly along the perch uttering a kind of buzzing
noise and suddenly raises the red feathers on his throat and rump.
Sclater's Hanging Parrakeet ( L . sclateri) of the Isle of Tula
is like the above : it is green, with all the back red and yellow and a
red stripe on the throat. I had one male some years ago which only
lived a few weeks. I never saw a handsomer little Parrot.

four years, and had made several attempts during the last three years,
but had been unable to rear their young ones. During 1926, however,
seven young have been reared from three nests. The nests were built
by the hen alone ; they were made of blades of grass pulled out of the
lawn of the aviary, and lined with horsehair and coco-nut fibres.
The first clutch consisted of three eggs ; the following ones of two each,
the eggs being pure white. The hen sits for eleven days, the cock taking
no part in incubation. When hatched the young are dark red with a
pale greyish down. They are chiefly fed by their mother with small
insects, seeds, and green food. They leave the nest when nine days
old, when they resemble their mother, though of a darker hue ; their
heads are almost bare of feathers, and they have very short tails. But
they can fly well and like hiding among the branches. They feed them-
selves when about twenty-five or thirty days old, at which time the
feathers of the head have completely grown, but they still lack the crest,
which does not appear until the first moult, which takes place about
nine weeks after they have left the nest.
The Red-crested Finches are good aviary birds, very handsome
and sufficiently hardy to be wintered out in an unheated aviary.
Their call note is low and plaintive, and repeated frequently. The
song of the cock is uninteresting, and very similar to that of
Coryphospingus pileatus ; it is composed of some sharp notes and ends
in a trill.
I think that this species has not been previously bred in captivity.

WAXBILLS FROM EAST AFRICA.

Sir, -- I was interested to read the letter in the last issue of the
Magazine in regard to a new species of Waxbill from East Africa.
I brought some Waxbills myself from the Island of Mozambique this
summer and also received some more this autumn from my friend,
Mr. Schulz, of Tanganyika Territory. These Waxbills resembled the
Common Waxbill but were considerably smaller, of a darker colour,
more distinctly marked and had the areas which are pink in the ordinary
Waxbill replaced by vivid red ; the difference between the two species
was very apparent when they were compared side by side.
Unfortunately they proved to be very delicate and all died within
a few months; this was no doubt due to the great differences of tempera-
ture between here and East Africa. During the time I was at Mozam-
bique the thermometer was seldom below 110* F.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996032" page_id="56773007"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The very fine Roller depicted in the accompanying plate was
brought home from the Gambia by Dr. Hopkinson in July, 1925, and
lived in the Zoological Gardens until December, 1926. It appears
to have been the first living example of this species to reach this
country. The Blue-breasted Roller is readily distinguished from the
other species of the genus by its buff-coloured head and upper breast,
blackish back and rich ultramarine-blue under parts. It is a resident
species in Senegambia, but very little appears to have been recorded
of its habits, though probably these do not differ from those of the other
species of the genus.
Rollers, in spite of their great beauty, are not very often kept in
captivity, neither are they particularly easy birds to keep. They are
very quarrelsome and, as a rule, each individual must have a cage or
aviary to itself, that is to say so far as others of its own kind are con-
cerned. They will not, generally speaking, disagree with birds that are
unrelated to them. The food of Rollers in nature consists of insects,
especially beetles, small frogs, and probably newly-hatched birds,
the method of feeding being to sit motionless on some bare branch of
a tree and to scan the surrounding ground for any creature moving
on the ground within the range of vision. Slow flying insects are also

26 Gapt. H. S. Stokes--Importation from Portuguese East Africa
taken on the wing. In captivity they should be fed upon a good
insectivorous mixture in which there is a fair amount of fresh raw
meat, also mealworms and cockroaches.
They thrive better in an aviary, where they can indulge in flight
and, incidentally, exhibit the striking colours of their wing feathers,
than in a cage, and a Roller with full powers of flight, in an outdoor
aviary, forms a very beautiful exhibit during the summer months.

A small but choice collection of birds has recently arrived at Messrs.
Gamage's under the care of Mr. Webb, who has put in some months of
arduous work trapping under difficult conditions, and a good deal
more work getting his birds home to England in the beautiful condition
we have come to associate with this collector.
Species new to aviculture in this country include the Purple Crested
Touracou (Gallirex porphyriocephalus) f three specimens, of usual
Touracou colouring, with an irridescent crest of green and purple.
These have gone to Mr. Ezra and Mr. Spedan Lewis.
The Natal Robin Chat (Cossypha natalensis) is very beautiful in
shape, and coloured grey and orange. There are several Black Rails
(Limnocorax niger) of small size, and blue-black colour and (alas) only
a hen of the Rufous Crake (Corethrura rufa), a tiny species no larger
than a Painted Quail, chestnut and black, spotted with white. The
Blue Necked Rail (Rallus ccerulescens) is also represented by one
specimen.
Two species of Sunbirds are also thought to be imported for the
first time, though the naming of Sunbirds seems to be in some confusion.
They are a tiny one called the Plum Coloured (Anthrothreptes longuemarii
nyassce) and the Zambesi Collared (Anthrothreptes collaris hypodilus ),
both in beautiful condition, and happily sipping their nectar out of
tooth-powder tins.

Also new is the Water Dikkop, one pair (Burhinus vermiculatus),
a small Stone Curlew.
Not for many years have we seen a consignment of Peters' Spotted
Firefinch (Hypargus niveiguttatus), 1 a very beautiful species as large as
a Grass Finch, red boldly spotted with white, and Jameson's Firefinch
(Lagonosticta jamesoni), of which there were several pairs, as also the
very rare Red-faced Waxbill (Pytelia afra ). These Finches all appear
to be solitary, and never found in flocks, so the trouble of catching
them must have been immense.
Kurrichaine Button Quails (Turvix lepurana) were in some numbers.
Desert birds of the Hemipode family, the hen considerably bigger
than the cock, and of polyandrous habits. They will require dry
sandy conditions. Our editor bred both an Australian and an Indian
species some years ago in an indoor aviary.

(Concluded from Vol. IV, p . 305)
The Brown-hooded Kingfisher (Halcyon albiventris) belongs to the
genus Halcyon , the species of which do not keep exclusively to the
water like the other Kingfishers.
These birds will sit for hours on the branch of a dead tree or in
some other conspicuous spot where the vegetation is rank and luxuriant,
and which is conducive to an abundance of insects, on the look-out for
m
their prey, which consists of large insects, lizards, etc. ; the birds sit
perfectly motionless except for the occasional turning of the head.
These Kingfishers frequently chase each other through the bush with
loud resounding cries.
They would make ideal cage birds, being intelligent, very beautiful,
and easy to cater for.
1 [A coloured plate of this species appeared in the Magazine for 1905 (Vol. Ill,
New Series, p. 119), the figure of the male being drawn from the first example
imported. Since then one or two specimens have reached Europe, but never
until now has any number arrived. -- Ed.]

Speckled Mouse Birds (Colius striatus ) always remind me of
Parrakeets, both in flight and general demeanour. They live in the
dense bush in small parties of about a dozen or more, and I have often
noticed that a little party of three or four would fly single file into a
bush, and a few minutes or so afterwards a few more would come, until
quite a number were gathered together. They usually sit very close
to each other, either lying on a branch or hanging underneath it, and
when in the latter position they half open their wings, puff out their
feathers, and sun themselves.
The Mouse Birds seem to be possessed of very little intelligence, for
great numbers visit orchards and get shot, yet there is always a con-
tinuous stream of newcomers, just as though nothing had happened.
They eat hard green fruit, especially peaches, which would kill any
other bird; they eat these when hardly the size of a walnut, and in
fact seem very partial to them, for when they can get these they leave
other ripe fruit untouched. In this way they are a great pest to the fruit
growers and no amount of scaring will keep them away. Hundreds
can be shot in a single day, and yet their numbers never seem to
diminish ; this is strange, for they cannot be called common in any
district.
The flight though swift is rather laboured and heavy.
The Trumpeter Hornbills (Bycanistes buccinator ), which are bub little
inferior in size to the Crested Hornbills, frequent the wooded slopes
of the mountain and the dense bush lands at the foot. I have seldom
seen them in the forest itself like that bird, except for a short time in
the year wdien certain berries are ripe on the forest trees, then they are
seen in small parties.
Outside the confines of the forest the Hornbills consort in pairs
or small parties composed of three or four birds, and they are seen
on the tops of the large fruit or berry bearing trees.
They are tolerably tame, and let one approach within a good
distance for observation. They sometimes sit for hours scarcely
moving, with a very dreamy expression in their eyes, no doubt due to
the long black eye-lashes.
The cry, which is fairly loud, has nothing like the volume of that
made by the Crested Hornbill.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Mount Belinda 29
The Crested Hornbills (Bycanistes cristatus), which are amongst the
largest of the Hornbills, are very rare in South Africa, Mount Selinda
being one of the few places in which they are found, and there they
are seen in pairs or small flocks in the environs of the forest. In the
forest itself the birds live in the tops of the tallest trees, feeding upon
their fruit.
The first time I was in the forest I was startled by a noise similar
to that made by an engine when letting off steam, this was made by a
large flock of these birds, which I had disturbed in a tree over my head.
I doubt if there is another bird in the world which makes such a noise
when in flight; the noise made by a flock of these birds flying over head
is incredible. The call, too, is extremely loud, and it would lead one to
think, if he did not know, that it was made by some large mammal
rather than a bird; it is a very loud braying bark, and is one of the
well-known sounds of Mount Selinda.
The first birds that I saw on the mountain were a pair of these
Hornbills, which flew out of the forest into the blue gum-trees near the
homestead as soon as we arrived. I don't know whether this was
due to inquisitiveness, for I never saw the birds again there, they are
usually very shy on account of their huge size.
During the time that I was at Mount Selinda the majority of the
Hornbills there frequented one large tree in the forest, and at any time
of the day one was almost sure to see a flock of them there, either
feeding upon the fruit or resting. Owing to the great height of the tree,
over 200 feet, it was necessary for me in order to observe them to
lie on my back, a by no means pleasant business especially when an
army of the fierce black forest ants passed in the vicinity. After
feeding the birds pair themselves off, and sit affectionately side by
side.
One would think that the preening of the feathers would be a
difficult task for the birds, owing to the enormous size of the beak,
but this is not so, in fact they seem to be able to preen even the neck
feathers with the greatest of ease.
It is a wonderful sight to see, a flock of about twenty or more of
these huge birds feeding in the forest trees. It is very amusing to
watch them courting, the hen squats down on a branch, the cock

meanwhile hopping about among the branches in a state of great
excitement, and every now and then bringing his intended mate a small
berry in the tip of his great beak; at other times he squats by her side
and preens her feathers and keeps eyeing her with many loving glances.
During this performance both birds look singularly grotesque.
I have questioned the natives through an interpreter--which is always
a very unsatisfactory business--in regard to the nesting habits of
these birds ; they state that the nest is made in a large hole at the top
of one of the great forest trees, the female entering and the male then
plastering the entrance up with dung ; she is fed by him during the
lengthy period of incubation and the rearing of the young.
The natives say that the hen moults during the time she is imprisoned
in her nest.
[The colour of these birds is glossy greenish black, the feathers of
the back having a scaled appearance, the feathers of the head are
elongated, and form a full loose crest, the feathers at the front are
lavender grey, with the basal half black.
The ear coverts are grey, the feathers of the neck and throat tipped
with that colour ; the lower back, the tail coverts, the lower abdomen,
the back of the thighs, white ; the two central tail feathers are black,
the rest broadly tipped with white.
The enormous casque is light horn colour, the beak dark horn.
The naked skin round the eye pink, the eyes themselves are very
large, and there are long sweeping black eye-lashes, which give the
bird a very gentle expression.
The casque of the female is much smaller and darker than that of
her mate.
The beak and casque of this Hornbill is of a very fine texture, almost
like tissue paper, and when the bird is flying between one and the sun
the light shines through and it appears fco be a rose pink colour ; this is
due to the presence of fine blood vessels in the structure.
These Hornbills in common with the rest of the family are very
poorly feathered, the under wing and under tail coverts being hardly
visible, and are little more than down, this I suppose accounts for the
noisy flight. The wdiole body too is very poorly feathered, the feathers
being thin and of a poor quality.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Mount Selinda 81
Though the flight seems to be very heavy and laboured when the
birds fly short distances, yet when they pass from hill to hill or from
one mountain to another, the flight seems remarkably light and
buoyant, and they sail long distances with outstretched motionless wing.
The Ground Hornbill (Bucorax caffer) has been previously mentioned,
so I will say little else in regard to it.
The natives in Gazaland believe that the bird can detect any animal
that may be in a hole in the ground by its sense of smell, they say
that the bird then proceeds to blow down the hole, the foul breath of
the bird causing the unfortunate inhabitant to come to the entrance
for fresh air, when it is at once seized and devoured.
A pair of these birds were kept by a man at a native trading store,
some twenty miles from Mount Selinda, and when they were full grown
they developed the most voracious appetite. There were large numbers
of cats at this store kept to check the increase of rats, and, like all
members of the domesticated feline tribe, they were extremely prolific,
but the small community never increased in spite of numerous additions
from time to time ; the reason for this was discovered one day by the
proprietor, who saw one of the Hornbills seize upon a whole family
of cats, and one by one throw them into the air (as they do with all
their food) and gulp them down alive.
These birds live in small parties of uneven number, either five,
seven, or nine, seldom more or less.
I spoke to many people about this curious fact, including people
who had lived in Rhodesia many years, and had seen hundreds of them,
but they all said that they had never seen a party composed of an
even number. Perhaps the odd one acts as a chaperon !
The Narina Trogon (Hapaloderma narina). The Trogons are very
beautiful and delicately coloured birds with very loose fine plumage,
tiny feet and small curved wings, which are usually hidden beneath the
long silky feathers of the back. They only inhabit the recesses of the
forests, and are never seen in the open country. They are found in
nearly all the tropical countries of the world, and live entirely upon
insects.
One species only is found in Southern Africa, namely the Narina
Trogon.

The first time I saw this beautiful creature at Mount Selinda was when
I was on the road through the forest to the Mission. Station. I had been
watching Green Bulbuls when I heard the coo of a Dove as I thought
which I had never heard before ; I went in the direction of the sound,
and was greatly surprised to find that the sound was made by a Trogon.
The note was almost identical with that made by the English Wood
Pigeon, and while uttering it the Trogon sat upright on a branch, the
feathers being compressed against the body, making the bird look
extremely slim. I watched the bird for a short time until it flew away,
when I endeavoured to follow, but the undergrowth proved too thick ;
it continued to call for a considerable time, the sound getting fainter
and fainter as it retreated to the heart of the forest.
Afterwards I saw these birds from time to time, always being
attracted in the first place by their dove-like notes. They live singly,
and inhabit the tallest trees in the gloomiest part of the forest, where
they pass from tree to tree with a silent and ghost-like flight.
These Trogons, at least the males, have patches of loose bare skin
of a brilliant bluish green colour above and behind the eye, at the
base of the beak, and on the throat; these are capable of erection, for I
have noticed that when the bird is uttering its cooing notes these
patches stand out very vividly against the rest of the plumage, and I
believe they are used in the display.
In colour the males are a wonderful golden metallic green above,
also on the upper breast and throat, the rest of the under parts being
a lovely shade of rose pink. The primary feathers are remarkably
narrow and sickle shaped. The wings are a mixture of black, white,
grey, and green, the wing-coverts being very finely vermiculated. The
four central tail feathers are dark glossy green, the rest are white with
black bases. The bill is pale green, and the bird has a very wide gape,
like that of a Nightjar. The female is somewhat similar to the male in
plumage, but is of a browner colour, and the rose pink under parts,
are not so brightly coloured.
The Golden-tailed Woodpecker (Campothera ahingdoni) was only
met with once or twice on some of the thinly wooded slopes of the
mountain, where it at once attracted my attention by its loud full
cry. It is a very active bird, and runs with great speed up and down

the tree trunks, stopping every now and then to hammer at the bark
or to extract some grub, but it feeds principally upon a small species
of tree ant, licking them up with its long tongue as it runs along ; in a
specimen that was secured I found the plumage full of these ants.
The Cardinal Woodpecker (Dendrojpicus cardinalis ) was exceedingly
common on the mountain, always busily engaged in running about the
tree trunks in search of small insects which inhabit the bark. Some-
times these birds had singing parties in the trees, a dozen or so would
gather together and indulge in the most hilarious behaviour, in fighting,
chasing each other from tree to tree, and making a great noise. They
have no real song, but have a series of rich pleasant calls. The Cardinal
Woodpecker is the smallest of the South African Woodpeckers.
The Scaly-throated Honey Guide (Indicator variegatus) is rare, and
I only saw it once deep in the forest, where it was hopping about the
branches of a tall tree, uttering the strange notes wdiich are characteristic
of the family. I know nothing of its habits beyond that it is a very
quiet and unobtrusive bird, and is very rarely seen.
Levaillant's Barbet (Trachyjphonus cafer) are found but sparingly
in the districts lying at the foot of Mount Selinda, where they at once
attract attention by their loud cries; they are very seldom seen, and
keep to the thick bush as though conscious of their loud colouring.
They never associate in parties like the Black-collared Barbet.
The Emerald Cuckoo (Chrysococcyx smaragdineus). When a child
I once saw a stuffed skin of this bird in a taxidermist's window, and I
was so struck by its extraordinary beauty that from that day I cherished
a great desire to see the bird in its native haunts. Later on, I again
made its acquaintance ; unfortunately--as part of millinery impedi-
menta--once in Paris I saw no less than seven skins of this wonderful
bird forming in conjunction with a chaotic mass of material what is
usually called a hat, but it was not until coming to the Mountain of
Selinda that I made the acquaintance of this exquisite bird in its forest
home.
One usually thinks of the Cuckoos as sombre-coloured birds, in
fact, most of them are, but the genus Chrysococcyx proves the exception,
in fact, they can boast of few rivals in the avian world, especially
the Emerald Cuckoo, whose colour is the most remarkable glittering

emerald green, the feathers having the appearance of scales; the lower
parts are delicate canary yellow, the tail feathers are tipped with white,
the under tail coverts white barred with emerald green. The female
is marked with brown and is white on the under parts barred with green.
These Cuckoos are essentially forest birds, inhabiting the tops of
the highest trees, where they find most of their food, which consists
mainly of hairy caterpillars, and I have frequently seen them consume
quite large ones.
The presence of the bird (the male) can easily be detected by its
loud, clear, and very distinct whistle, which consists of three notes,
" chu--chu--chit," which is uttered very slowly and repeated at
frequent intervals.
When about to call the bird chooses some thick straight branch in
the shade, then straightens himself out horizontally, and as he calls
he turns slowly round and round, moving his tail up and down, and
appearing to put his utmost strength into the production of the song.
The bird continues the call sometimes in the same position for over an
hour at a time, then it will fly to another tree close by, and on alighting
give utterance to a particularly loud alarm note, which is very different
to its usual song, and when it has found a suitable branch it commences
to call again.
Unless in the sunlight, the bird is very difficult to see in spite of its
brilliant plumage, which seems to tone down in the shadows and
harmonize with the surrounding foliage.
The female is an extraordinary illusive creature, and very difficult
to observe, for she cannot be detected by any note, for she is com-
paratively silent and very few white people seem to have seen one.
Eain and mist do not seem to damp this bird's ardour, for I have
frequently heard its loud ringing notes when the whole forest has been
enveloped in dense rain clouds, so thick that the tops of the trees
were invisible.
These Cuckoos are parasitic, laying their eggs in the nests of other
birds.
The Klaas Cuckoo (Chrysococcyx klaasi) is another of the exquisite
Golden Cuckoos that I have occasionally seen on the lower
wooded slopes of the mountain. Like the Emerald Cuckoo it has a

remarkable loud clear call, and also like the latter bird it is hard to see
owing to its plumage harmonizing so well with the foliage.
It is never seen in the forest, but seems to prefer the more open
country.
Owing to its comparative tameness, I have had very good oppor-
tunities of observing it. It betrays its presence by its flute-like whistle
of three notes. The hen too has a distinctive note, but it is quite
different to that of her mate.
The birds seem to go about in pairs, the cock being an exemplary
husband. The hen seems to be very lethargic, at least she assumes
that pose whilst her husband makes a very energetic search of the
thorn-trees for the hairy caterpillars upon which these birds feed. As
soon as he has found one he brings it back to his mate, approaching
her with great ceremony, drooping his wings and raising and fanning
his tail, and, holding his head up as if to say, " Look what a fine one
this is," he gives it to his mate, but I regret to say that she like many
humans shows little or no appreciation of what her husband does, but
simply snatches the food as soon as he is within reach and without
more ado swallows it. If the hen has moved to another tree before the
cock returns, he shows great concern when he finds that she has gone,
and hopping about all over the tree, he utters his call note, " Where
is it, where is it ? " until she answers in a low whistle, " Here, here, here."
I once saw a male feed his mate during the whole of a morning,
and even then she was not satisfied.
The feathers on the thighs of the male are very long, and make
him appear as though he wore a pair of long white trousers.
In colour the male is shining emerald green, glossed with golden
copper, and marked with white above, the lower parts being white too.
The female is barred with creamy buff and brown, and looks very
much like a small edition of an immature European Cuckoo, except
that she has metallic green on some parts of her plumage.
Burchell's Coucal (Centropus burchelli) is very common, and is found
in the dense bush and reed beds which border the fast-running mountain
streams.
Its peculiar loud bubbling note, like the noise made by water running
out of a narrow-necked bottle, is often heard in the early mornings

and evenings ; it is one of those strange exotic noises that are so pleasing
to the ear of the bird-lover in the tropics.
Burchell's Coucal differs in its habits from the Senegal Coucal, which
is the common Coucal in Rhodesia, in being practically terrestrial, this
being shown by the highly developed hind toe which resembles that
of a lark. When disturbed the bird rises up out of the undergrowth,
and flies a short distance, then dives again into the dense vegetation,
where it creeps about in search of the insects upon which it subsists.
Occasionally I saw the birds on the edge of the forest, low down in the
dense jungle.
In colour, these birds are glossy greenish black on the head, nape,
and upper back, the mantle and scapulars chestnut with white shaft
streaks, the lower back is finely barred grey and white, the tail-coverts
greenish black, barred with white, the tail-feathers greenish black,
tipped with white, the entire under surface creamy white.
Livingstone's Touracou (Turacus livingstonii). Touracous are
large, splendid birds, quick and graceful in their movements, and
wonderful in their colouring, which is usually a harmonious combina-
tion of green, purple, blue, and carmine. Their attractive qualities
make them very suitable birds for aviaries.
The Livingstone's Touracou is a forest-loving bird, and only
frequents the densely wooded districts, and is seldom found outside
the confines of the dark forests, where it lives in the sunshine on the
tops of the great forest trees and never descends to the ground. It
betrays its presence by its extremely loud raucous cry, which resembles
the caw of a rook, but is very much louder and quicker, and when a
party of these birds form chorus the noise is perfectly deafening.
These Touracous seem to indulge in dancing and " singing " parties
in the high tree-tops. I have often watched parties of six or more
birds playing together, sometimes they all run together, one behind the
other, along a horizontal branch until they come to the end, when they
fly in single file across to another tree, where they fly from branch to
branch displaying their splendid carmine wings. If one sits quietly
they continue to play about, but sometimes in the middle of the play
they remember that they are being watched, and suddenly crouch
down in a clump of leaves and become almost invisible.

At times the forest seems to swarm with these birds, judging by
the noise they make. They give full vent to their vocal powers about
sundown.

They live almost entirely on fruit and berries, but are especially
fond of a small orange green berry which grows upon a large forest
tree; this berry is relished by most fruit-eating birds, it has the most
horrible taste, and I can hardly see how birds can have any sense
of taste if they eat it; it is called the Guniti-berry.
If one happens to be near one of these Touracous when flying, a
remarkably loud rustle is heard even if the bird makes no motion with
its wings ; I noticed this especially when a bird of this species shot past
me with closed wings down the mountain side.
In colour both sexes are rich grass green, dark metallic green on
the wings, lower back and tail, there is a white mark above and below
the eye. The head has a long upstanding crest of decomposed feathers,
green tipped with white. The flight feathers are intense carmine red,
edged with dark metallic purple. The feet are black, and the bill
crimson.
It has often been stated that the carmine pigment in the flight
feathers of the Touracous is soluble in water, but I am afraid that I
cannot believe it, for I have tried many times with the feathers of
several species, using both cold and hot water, and also different kinds
of soap and soda, but I never washed any of the colour out.
The Purple-crested Touracou (Gallirex porphyreolophus) cannot be
called common in the Mount Selinda district; it is found rather sparingly
in the thickly wooded districts on the lower slopes of the mountain, and
I was fortunate in seeing quite a few during the time I resided at Selinda.
These Touracous are of a tame and confiding nature, and will
come within close proximity of the homesteads, where they visit the
fruit-trees and feed upon the fruit, being especially partial to plantains
and bananas. When at rest in the trees, they look very inconspicuous,
their brilliant colouring seeming to tone down and harmonize with the
surrounding foliage ; they then look like large grey Pigeons, the crest
being depressed and the bird sitting close up to the trunk of the tree,
but in spite of their apparently lethargic attitude, their brilliant eye
is always fixed upon one.

They live principally upon a certain kind of wild fig, which grows
in great clusters upon the trunks of the tree, and in the vicinity of one
of these trees one is almost sure to find a pair of these birds.
The cry is rather pleasing, and is totally different to that made by
the Livingstone's Touracou. It wanders about the country in pairs,
and is not migratory like the latter bird.
If the weather is very wet, these birds seem to be incapable of
sustained flight, for the natives sometimes capture them by chasing
them from tree to tree until they fall exhausted to the ground.
A young bird of this species was captured in this manner by the
natives, and kept for me by some friends. " Charlie " was his name, and
a most charming pet he made, he was fed upon fruit and cake, and in
time became exceedingly tame, but unfortunately one night a wild cat
attacked him, and tore half the lower mandible off, we fed him on soft
food for a time, but he lingered a few days and died.
In colour these birds are dark rich metallic green on the lores, eye-
brows, and on the frontal band, the long loose crest is brilliant purple,
under the lower mandible is a patch of metallic blue. The throat and
breast are green with a pinkish bloom, the rest of the under parts are
slate grey, the back of the head, the whole of the upper parts, and the
tail either brilliant metallic purple or grey according to the angle at
which one looks at the bird, the flight feathers are brilliant carmine,
edged with brownish purple. The tail-coverts are dark purple. The
legs, feet, and beak are black, the eyelids are edged with bright pink.
Both sexes are the same in colour.
Levaillant's Parrot (Poeocephalus robustus) is a large and handsome
Parrot, and only found at certain times of the year, especially wheu
the " Mahobahoba " fruit is ripe; this is a small round fruit, about
the size of a w r alnut, with an exceedingly sickly sweet flavour. The birds
associate either in pairs, or in small parties, and can be easily dis-
tinguished from all the other African Parrots when on the wing by the
brilliant green of the under parts and the red edging of the wings.
When flying they are extremely noisy, uttering all the time their loud
raucous shrieks.
Every morning from 7.30 to 8 a.m. they could be heard passing
over the homestead on their way from the lowlands where they roost

to the forest to feed upon certain fruits. Their shrieks can be heard
half a mile away.
Of an extremely wild and wary nature they will not tolerate the
presence of a human being, and consequently it is well nigh impossible
to observe them in the wild state. During their flight to and from
the forest, they frequently rest on the way in certain high trees.
It is a very easy matter to capture any number of these birds by
finding out the tree where they spend the night and then putting bird
lime on the branches on which they roost, and in this way the settlers
frequently capture large numbers ; but very few ever seem to reach
these shores.
The Crested Hawk Eagle (Lophocetus occipitalis). This very
beautiful and unique Eagle is seen but occasionally in the lowlands
around Mount Selinda, generally in pairs. It is a very conspicuous
bird when in flight owing to the black and white marking of the wings
and tail, and when in the distance I have frequently mistaken it for
one of the large Hornbills. It frequents the well-timbered and well-
watered districts, where it is to be seen sitting motionless on the top of
some large bush or tree raising and lowering its long crest. When at
rest it appears to be quite black, but upon close examination is seen
to be of a general dark sepia brown, the wings and tail being broadly
banded with white, the cere, the gape, and the feet bright yellow, the
legs are feathered down to the toes, and the unusually large eyes are
yellow.
The Bateleur Eagle (Helotarsus ecaudatus) can be distinguished at
once from all other Eagles when on the wing, even though soaring at a
great height, by the white underwing coverts, the very short tail, the
end of which appears to be on a level with the secondary wing feathers,
and by the bright coral red cere and legs which are discernible from a
great height. When on the wing this bird is to me the grandest and
the most beautiful of all the Eagles ; the very embodiment of aerial
grace, it soars with the ease and lightness of a feather blown in the wind.
The African Buzzard Eagle (Asturinula monogrammica) resembles
at a distance a light-coloured Sparrow-hawk rather than an Eagle, it is
comparatively common in Gazaland, where it haunts the trees bordering
the rivers and larger streams, and is usually seen in pairs.

It is not at all shy, and will allow one to approach within a few yards.
It is a pretty and inoffensive little bird, and seldom if ever preys upon
the farmyard poultry, but it is always shot in common with the other
Hawks by the farmers.
Waterfowl are conspicuous by their absence in the district
immediately around Selinda, the reason being that even though there
is an abundance of water, the rivers and streams are extremely fast
flowing, and therefore are not conducive to an extensive bird life,
I mean of aquatic fowl, who like swamps and broad shallow rivers
where they find an abundance of food. The only bird besides small
Crake, etc., that I saw was the Black-headed Heron (Ardea melano-
cejohala), a bird which resembles the Common Heron in colour, but is
larger in size and when on the wing can be distinguished by the pure
white under wing-coverts.
The Tamborine Dove (Tympanistria bicolor) is met with usually
singly in the thick undergrowth in the forest. It is exceedingly shy
and timid, and very difficult to observe. It might easily be mistaken
for a Thrush by the casual observer as it grubs about in the dead
leaves under the bushes, for both in demeanour and colour it resembles
a bird of that family.
Occasionally I have seen it in the cultivated lands of the Kaffirs
on the edge of the forest, but even there it is very hard to observe,
flying upon the slightest provocation into the dense bush.
The Emerald-spotted Dove (Chalcopelia afra) is the commonest
Dove in the Selinda region except the Bed-eyed Dove, which is almost
the commonest of all the birds. It is found in small numbers in the
densely wooded kloofs, and as it usually sits motionless in the dense
vegetation it is very hard to find. It is shy and retiring, and if disturbed
in fairly open country it will fly into a tree and sit on a thick branch
close up to the trunk, and in that position is rendered almost invisible
owing to the grey colour harmonizing so well with the lichen-covered
bark.
It is a strange thing that all the Doves of Mount Selinda are so shy,
because they meet with no persecution; the Lemon Dove (Haplopelia
larvata) is no exception, for it is the shyest of birds, and one only gets
a very fleeting glance of it as it flies away at one's approach. Upon

seeing the bird for the first time I mistook it for a Thrash, owing to
its olive.brown colouring and mode of flight.
The Lemon Dove only inhabits the parts of the forest where the
undergrowth is the thickest, and there it can be heard walking about
on the dead leaves, but it is a hopeless task to try and watch it, for upon
the slightest sign of danger it flies up and after a short flight dives down
again into the dense vegetation.
I once came across a bird of this species, caught in a native trap in
the forest, it was hanging in the air by its legs, with the wings almost
touching the ground, and in its straggles it had worn all the scales off
its legs and the flight feathers from the wings. I brought it back to
the homestead, where I kept it for a short time, but it eventually
died, having I think, sustained some internal injuries when in the trap.
These Doves are practically terrestrial and only at rare intervals
have I seen them perch in the trees, and this was only when they were
disturbed from the ground.
At one season of the year these Doves gather together under a
certain kind of forest tree, from which fall berries upon which they
feed, the birds create quite a noise by grabbing about in the dead
leaves ; it sounds from a distance as though it were raining, often thirty
or forty birds can be seen in a space of a few square yards.
The flight is very heavy and noisy.
The East African Guinea-fowl (Numida mitrata) is exceedingly
numerous on the lower slopes of the mountain, where it lives in flocks
of a dozen or more. From the terrace of the homestead, flocks could
always be seen in the old cultivated lands. Frequently these birds
indulge in a kind of play, chasing each other round and round, and
jumping high into the air over the others backs. At night if one goes
out into the bush-veld, the number of Guinea-fowl one disturbs in the
trees is amazing. Usually they roost in small flocks, but occasionally
I have seen them in pairs or singly.
On one farm that I visited were some ordinary Guinea-fowl, and
very often a flock of wild ones would join them and come right up to
the homestead. It was when the two species of birds were together
that the great difference could be seen between them, the wild species is
entirely black, whereas the other is grey, the spots on the feathers of

the former are much larger and more distinct, the helmet and wattles
are larger and of a different shape, also the whole neck is rich blue, and
the wild bird is also much slimmer in build.
I brought a bird of this species home with me, he was picked up
when a tiny chick, and we thought that he was a young Francolin, and
it was not until he began to get his spotted plumage that we found out
our mistake. When on board the ship he showed great character, and
proved to be a great pet, but on getting home he lost a great deal of
his tameness, and struck up a friendship with a male Impeyan Pheasant,
who had just previously murdered his wife.
The Crested Guinea Fowl {Guttera edouardi ) is only found in the
deepest recesses of the forest, where it is more often heard than seen.
After the Crested Hornbill it is the noisiest of the forest birds, its cry
is very much like the noise made by the old-fashioned wooden rattle,
which was used in the good old days for scaring birds and if one happens
to be in close proximity to a flock the noise is simply deafening.
Its presence can only be detected by its call; it . is a hopeless task
to try to find it otherwise, for it only creeps about in. the densest
undergrowth.
Taken young, these birds (so I was told) make delightful pets. A lady
living in the vicinity of Mount Selinda told me that one she had
would follow her about like a dog, even on long walking trips ; it also
kept order in the farmyard, stopping any dispute between the poultry,
and seeing that the chickens' food was not eaten by the adult birds--
a truly useful acquisition to any farmyard.
This species is in my opinion by far the handsomest of the Guinea-
fowl, being preferable I think even to the blue Abyssinian Guinea-fowl.
The bird wanders about in the forest in small parties of five to twelve,
feeding upon seeds, berries, insects, etc. When disturbed, it flies up
into the trees, mounting from branch to branch until it gets to the top.

AUSTRALIAN PARRAKEETS

Australia and its neighbouring islands are inhabited by many
splendid Parrakeets which may be divided into two groups, Polytelis
and Platycercus. The Platycerci are all birds for the aviary rather
than for the cage, and win favour by their exquisite colouring, their
power of enduring cold, their readiness to breed, and their comparatively
agreeable voices. They are quarrelsome, especially with individuals
of the same or nearly related species.
When a male and female are put together for the first time, they
must be watched ; if the male appears to be pleased with his com-
panion, or indifferent, it should be all right, but if he shows signs of
anger and attacks her, they must be separated at once if her life is to
be saved, for there is little or no chance of their ever agreeing. With a
male Platycercus hatred at first sight is generally enduring except in
cases where he still remembers the mate from whom he has been parted.
If the female gains the upper hand, they may live without serious
fighting, but there is little likelihood of their going to nest.
Although the majority, if in good condition, can stand a low tempera-
ture, broad-tailed Parrakeets are sensitive to draughts and cold
winds, and it is wise to make certain that they use their shelter, shutting
them up in it at night, and during very bad weather. For satisfactory
breeding results a movable aviary not less than 24 feet by 8 feet by
8 feet is desirable. They will nest in much smaller aviaries of the usual
fixed type, but the young, if any are reared, are usually worthless for
stock purposes.
I. The Polytelis Parrakeets
The genus Polytelis bears some resemblance to the Palceornis
Parrakeets, in which they were included for a long time ; they are
very fine birds, and easily kept when their requirements are understood.
They are found in Australia and some of the Oceanic Isles,
Barraband's Parrakeet ( Polytelis barrabandi) inhabits east and
south-east Australia. The sexes can be easily distinguished. The male
is brilliant grass-green, black under the tail, the flights and Beatrices
washed with blue; forehead, cheeks, and throat golden yellow, with a

wide red stripe below the yellow of the throat; beak red, irides yellow,
and feet pale grey. The female is a duller green, has no yellow on
the head nor a red throat, but beneath the tail she is black and pink,
and she has red thighs. The young resemble their mother, but the
males from the first show faint indications of yellow and red where
those colours will eventually appear ; at first they have red thighs,
but these disappear as they grow older. They are about the same
size as the Ring-neck Parrakeet, and have small beaks and long pointed
tails.
Barrabands do not scream, but their call is too piercing for indoors,
and although they will live in a cage it is a pity to shut up a bird, one
of whose chief features is its immensely powerful flight. They thrive
infinitely better in an aviary, and several pairs can be kept together,
either by themselves or with odd birds of either sex ; it is not even
necessary always to separate them when breeding, though a hen will
sometimes sulk and refuse to lay if another takes possession of the
nest which she covets.
Barrabands are very ready to breed in confinement, but unless their
aviary is roomy they will only lay a few eggs and most if not all of
these will be clear. Once acclimatized they are quite hardy. Now and
then a delicate individual may take cold, but this is the exception rather
than the rule. The young need more protection than adults during the
first winter, but do not usually require artificial heat.
Freshly imported specimens are liable to two troublesome diseases.
The first is paralysis of the feet and legs, which may come on suddenly.
The cause would seem to be too dry and heating diet after semi-
starvation caused by fear, which prevents them from eating freely
during the voyage. Many newly caught Barrabands die in this way,
and the danger is not over for two months after their landing. Escaped
individuals recaptured when tired and half-starved may suffer in the
same way unless they are fed on soaked canary seed and fruit and
some kind of purgative is mixed with their drinking water. I do not
know a certain cure for paralysis, but cod-liver oil in their drinking
water may do some good.
A still worse trouble among freshly imported Barrabands is a disease
which causes swelling round the eyes, which irritates the bird, and in

time brings on weakness, blindness, and eventually death. It appears
to be contracted in the dirty travelling boxes used by the Australian
catchers and dealers, and often makes its appearance on the voyage.
It is contagious, though not extremely so, but a diseased bird may pass
it on to another in the same aviary. &amp;apos; It usually appears some days or
weeks after landing, but occasionally it lies dormant for months, and
a bird may even have moulted and shown a desire to nest before it
develops.
I do not know any positive cure for this disease. If the weather
be fine the birds are better in an outside aviary, with perches that
can easily be cleaned with a non-irritant disinfectant. Everything should
be done to improve the general health of the sufferers, and there is
reason to hope that after a long time some of the less serious cases may
recover completely. Birds which are badly affected are best off in
cages where they have their food close at hand.
A cock Barraband whose hen is shut up in an aviary is a delightful
bird to have at liberty, but care must be taken to ascertain that he is
really paired, or he may leave if he has a companion of his own sex
at liberty with him. A cock Barraband may court and even feed a hen
without being actually mated to her, but once this has taken place he
is the most faithful and devoted of husbands. A pair should never be
liberated together, or they will certainly be lost. Owls are to be feared,
but it is not difficult to train a cock Barraband to return to his aviary
through an inward-pointing funnel of wire netting for his evening
feed; once inside he cannot find the way out again, and will stay in
until he is let out the next morning.
Barrabands should be fed on canary, oats, and millet seed, with
fruit and green stuff ; some of them like mealworms. They do not
often damage shrubs in their aviary.
The Rock Peplar Parrakeet (P. melanura) from South and West
Australia, is another very beautiful species, slightly larger. The male
is yellow, deepening to olive on the head and back, the tail bluish, flights
of the same colour but the lesser wing coverts are yellow, and the
greater red or black ; the mantle is olive green, beak red, feet olive
grey. The female has her yellow parts very olivaceous and a dark
green tail edged with pink. The young resemble the female, but the

males may be distinguished by their thicker and bolder heads. They
also soon begin to chatter and call as they sit on a perch in a way that
hens never do.
These Parrakeets do not live long in close confinement, and suffer
from heart disease, but if allowed a spacious, movable aviary, they
do very well, and are hardier than Barrabands. They are equally
willing to nest, but unless their aviary is really large, most of the eggs
will be clear. This species is more quarrelsome than the Barraband,
and adult pairs do not live peaceably together. The cocks can be kept
at liberty in the same way as Barrabands. The rapidity and agility
of their flight are positively astonishing, and it alone would make
them desirable even were their plumage no more ornamental than a
Crow's ! They are not hard to tame, and some have even learnt to
speak and whistle. Their food should be the same as given to the
Barrabands, with the addition of hemp and sunflower. Newly imported
birds are liable to eye disease, but I have never seen a case of paralysis
of the feet among them.
Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet (P. alexandrce), perhaps better
known as the Princess of Wales's Parrakeet, has been removed from the
genus Polytelis by North, and placed in a separate genus, Spathopterus,
on account of the presence of spatules at the tips of the second flight
feathers. There is no doubt, however, that it is a Polytelis. Although
abundant in its native place--the deserts of central and west Australia--
it has always been rare in Europe and has never been freely imported.
It is one of the most beautiful and graceful of the whole family, its
colouring being exquisitely soft and harmonious.
The male of this species is slightly smaller than the Barraband, and
has the back of the neck, the mantle, back, and flights ashy olive green,
washed with blue and yellow ; the wing coverts are pale greenish
yellow ; the rump is pastel blue, the median rectrices golden green ;
the others blue grey outside, pink inside ; the top of the head grey blue,
the face, throat, and front of the neck pink, as are also the thighs ;
the under parts pearly grey ; the beak bright pink, eye yellow, feet
pinkish grey.
The hen bird is smaller, and her colours are not so bright, her head
and rump are grey rather than blue, and she lacks the curious spatules

which the cock wears on one of Ms flights. This species is not as hardy
as the Barrabands and Rock Peplar and requires more protection from
the cold ; it-is a good plan to shut it up at night, and watch it carefully
in bad weather and during the moult. Acclimatized specimens can,
however, do without artificial heat.
Queen Alexandra&amp;apos;s Parrakeets are quite ready to go to nest in an
aviary, but unless it is really spacious few eggs are laid and the male
birds are often sterile. Several adults will usually agree together, but
pairs kept by themselves in the breeding season are more likely to be
successful. They should be given the same food as the Rock Peplar,
with addition of a few mealworms, of which they are very fond. They
are particularly gentle and confiding, and will feed from their master's
hand ; they like to be noticed and spoken to, although, like many
Parrakeets, they object to being handled. They can occasionally be
taught to speak and whistle, but it is a mistake to make a pet of a cock
from whom one wishes to breed, as in all probability he will come to
prefer his master to his own mate.
The late Mr. Astley was the first to breed this species, and until
his lamented death in 1925 he kept a small flock in his aviary.
Hybrids have been obtained between Barraband and Rock Peplar,
and between Barraband and Queen Alexandra ; also between this last
and the Crimson-wing.
We now come to the genus Aprosmictus , of which the King
Parrakeet is the typical representative. They are larger than the
preceding species, with more ample wings and less pointed tails.
The genus contains several species and sub-species, but only one
*is freely imported.
The King- Parrakeet, A. cyanopygius , is a magnificent bird, and
comes from South Australia. The male bird has the head, neck, and
under parts of the body dazzling scarlet, the wings and mantle are
deep green, with a pale green stripe across the shoulders ; a spot at
the back of the neck, the lower back and rump are dark blue ; tail
bluish black, beak red and black ; yellow irides, feet black. The
female has a green head and neck, and her beak is blackish. The young
of both sexes strongly resemble the adult female, but the upper mandible
of young cocks turns red before their plumage changes. A well-defined

pale green stripe across the wing of a green-headed bird is a possible
sign of a cock, but not a certain one, as some hens also have this stripe,
though it is lacking in the majority of cases. They assume adult colour-
ing more or less after the first moult. A yellowish tinge in the red
parts of a cock bird is either a sign of illness or abnormality, and is
not, as some dealers assert, due to youth.
The King Parrakeet is hardy and easily kept, if protected from
wind and wet, and can stand any amount of cold when once acclimatized.
It should have the same diet as the Rock Peplar with addition of
monkey nuts and a generous allowance of mealworms. It goes to
nest readily, but clear eggs are the rule in a small aviary. The hen
may refuse to lay in the ordinary type of log or box nest ; she often
prefers a very deep one something in the style of a tall clock case with
a hole near the top, where the dial would be. The box should be
lined inside with wire netting to enable the bird to climb up and down ;
a natural log of the right shape is best of all. The King will live in a
cage, and is not noisy, but kept in this way they mope and become
apathetic, and are neither happy nor interesting.
Pairs of Kings are not very satisfactory at liberty, but a cock whose
hen is kept shut up is ideal and can be strongly recommended to a
beginner. He is a good stayer, does no damage, and is too big to be
attacked by birds of prey ; he is wonderfully handsome, too, with his
fine plumage and elegant flight. He is also quite peaceable at liberty
with his own kind and sex. He may perhaps eat a few ripe apples, but
will not do serious harm in a garden. In the aviary Kings hardly
ever molest small Pinches.
The Green-winged King Parrakeet (A. chloropterus ) from south-
east New Guinea resembles the above, but the pale green band across
the wings and the blue spots on the nape and rump are much larger.
The hen has a green head and neck.
The Amboina King Parrakeet (A. amboinensis ) has a carmine
red neck and under parts and green wings ; the back, rump, scapulars,
the edges and underneath the wings deep blue ; the tail bluish black :
the hen is like him, only smaller and less brightly coloured.
The Sula King Parrakeet (A. sulaensis) is smaller than the
above, the sexes are practically alike. A female in my possession has

lived several years in an outside aviary and has laid and sat twice in
a year, even when unmated.
The Crimson-winged Parrakeet (Ptistes erythropterus) from north
and west Australia, is very nearly related to the King. The male is
slightly smaller than his mate, and is a very splendid satiny green, with
black mantle and scapulars ; the middle of the back is brilliant blue,
and all the wing coverts are scarlet. The beak is yellowish red ; eye
red brown, feet grey. The female has no black and has less red about
the wings.
Although it is liable to eye disease when freshly imported, like its
relative the King, and to attacks of contagious fever, the Crimson-
wing may fairly be called hardy. It goes to nest readily, has the same
requirements as the King, but it is not always easy to obtain a fertile
male bird. Although it is one of the gaudiest and most brilliant of
Parrakeets, it must be admitted that the beauty of the male is wholly
exterior. He is quarrelsome and unfaithful. When a pair are put
together, the cock often attacks his mate, and drives her about viciously.
Sometimes, just when one is about to take her away, he will begin to
make advances, and directly afterwards they become good friends.
At times he drives her about for a month or more, and then makes up
to her, or he may never take to her at all, although they are both in
breeding condition. They require a large aviary in order that the hen
can get away from the cock, and if he becomes too aggressive a few
wing feathers may be clipped so as to limit his power of attack. If
unprovided with a " clock case " or deep natural nest, the hen will
sometimes prefer to lay on the bare ground sooner than use an
ordinary log.
Though Crimson-wings may roam rather far away from their
homes, they would really be very good birds at liberty, were it not for
their inveterate habit of going down chimneys. Every now and again
one comes across a cock who lacks this fatal curiosity, and he will
live out for years, to the great delight of his owner.
This species should be fed on the same mixture as the King. It
has been crossed with the King and with Queen Alexandra.

are natives of the Fijian Isles. Although in appearance they slightly

resemble the King, their habits are very different. They have stronger
beaks.
The Red-shining Parrakeet (P. splendens) from Viti Levu
and Kandavu has a carmine head and under parts ; a blue stripe on the
nape ; black and rump green; wings blue and green ; tail blue ;
iris orange ; beak and feet black. The sexes are alike. This is a delicate
species in captivity, being subject to a kind of chronic enteritis as well
as to tuberculosis and other diseases. It does better in a room or a large
indoor aviary than in a cage, especially if it is timid, which is sometimes
the case.
The diet should consist of canary, hemp, oats, and sunflower seeds,
along with monkey nuts and plenty of fruit.
This species utters two different calls, a soft cry and a strident scream.
Some specimens learn to talk. I found them gentle in an aviary, but
other people complain that they are aggressive. It is said that
in its own country it is often tamed, and can then be left at
liberty.
The Tabuan Parrakeet (P. tabuensis) from Vanua Levu differs
from the preceding in having its head and under parts rich mahogany
purplish red ; it is occasionally imported together with an allied
species P. taviunensis from the Island of Taviuni which may be dis-
tinguished by its smaller size and absence of blue on the nape, and
another intermediate species P. koroensis from Koro Island. These
are all very choice and fine birds.
The Masked Parrakeet (P. personata) has been practically
exterminated by Mongooses. It is green, with a black face, the middle
of the breast yellow, and the middle of the belly orange, the wings and
tail washed with blue.
I once owned a very old specimen who was allowed his liberty
during the summer. Although he hated being handled, he was friendly
and liked sitting on one's arm or shoulder, but at times he would
viciously attack women's ankles. He was afraid of other birds, and
avoided them, but I once saw him happily feeding at the same dish with
an enormous rat ! He ate everything he could find, and drank ink,
cod liver oil, and every kind of medicine, so that it was astonishing
that he lived so long !

His only natural cry was piercing and harsh, but he made up for
it by speaking fluent English, and imitating dogs and cats. He walked
more like a Pheasant than a Parrakeet, and his heavy flight was very
peculiar, and not at all like that of other Parrakeets ; it consisted of
a succession of slow wing beats followed by a glide.

We would commend to the notice of our members a very excellent
book that has been recently published entitled Notes on the Game Birds
of Kenya and Uganda (including the Sand-grouse, Pigeons, Snipe,
Bustards, Geese, and Ducks). It is written by Sir Frederick J. Jackson,
K.C.M.G., C.B., etc., than whom there is no one better qualified for
such a task, for he has spent a great part of his life in East Africa and,
during more than thirty years there, has spent his spare time in the
pursuit of natural history.
Although Sir Frederick will always be remembered as a very
successful Governor of Uganda, he is perhaps better known to many
as an ornithologist, and we are very pleased to hear that he hopes
later on to be able to deal with all of the birds of Kenya and Uganda.
The present volume is published by Williams and Norgate, Ltd., at
25s. net.
Mrs. Prestwick kindly sends the following notes :--
The membership of the Society now numbers 433, the highest since
1910, with 444 ; the record year was 1909, with 451. The 500 mark
should be reached by the end of this year, if members will make a
special effort.
The Society is now in its 33rd year, and it is pleasing to note that
there are still six original members (October, 1894), namely, James
Cooper, H. K. Fillmer, James B. Housden, Mrs. Mortimer, W. H. St.
Quintin, and S. M. Townsend. There are seventeen members wdio

Members will be sorry to learn that Mr. F. G. Hedges has lost his
famous hen Gang-Gang Cockatoo " Tut ", the first of its kind bred in
Europe. Death was from pneumonia.
It will come as a pleasant surprise to many to know that Madam
Pavlova is an ardent bird lover. On her return from Australia, a few
months ago, she brought a large collection of Australian Finches
and a very fine pair of Grass Parrakeets. The Finches are now housed
in a super indoor aviary, erected by one of our Beaconsfield members.

COLOUR BREEDING IN BUDGERIGARS

Sir, --I was very pleased to see your notice on the Budgerigar
Club booklet, and should like to point out a very essential item that
Professor Duncker appears to have missed.
In colour breeding in all stock, there are two ways of producing
new colours and shades, first by sports and selection, and second by
crossing these shades and colours to get other shades and colours.
From the table at the bottom of page 15, it might appear that all
the colours and shades were produced from sports or selective breeding,
whereas Cobalt, Mauve, and Maygreen (apple-green) are produced by
crossing two or more of the other colours or shades.
About thirty years ago I produced Blue Japanese bantams and
have always been interested in colour breedings, and I consider this
point should not be lost sight of.

Sir, --Although only Budgerigar episodes, perhaps the following
notes will be interesting to the members of the Avicultural Society.
All my Budgerigars are blue-bred greens from well-known strains,
and during 1925 did very well in turning up several blues and at that
time I had no blues in the aviary, but during 1926, without any
selection whatsoever (other than the birds themselves), a pair of my
own young ones of 1925 produced in their first nest one good blue,
two greens, and two white.
The white are as pure as any I have seen at the shows, the dark
markings almost eliminated and just a tinge of the palest delicate blue
on the under parts and between the wings. They are a very clean white
too, not looking like a washed-out and dirty blue, as some so-called
whites do. All my birds live summer and winter in an entirely unheated
garden aviary; there is a shelter shed attached, but that is only closed
in on three sides, the birds fly in and out at will, and often spend the
night on the open flight. The whites seem very hardy and bonny.
In another rather interesting nest two hens laid and nested together,
they laid eleven eggs, nine of which hatched out and were fully reared.
Two of these were good yellows, one a nice deep blue, and the other
six greens.
I have other blues, but these came from a blue pair in another
enclosure similar, the hen being one of my own from 1925 and the
cock from the late Mrs. Dalton Burgess's strain, but of course, being a
blue pair not at all remarkable, but that a pair of greens should produce
whites seems worthy of comment. The whites I believe to be a pair.

Correspondence
Mr. McEuan, of Richmond House, Hayling Island, wrote a letter
in The Times on the subject last week, and has been good enough to
wuite to me personally in addition. He tells me that the bird was first
seen by one of the punt gunners in the neighbourhood last August,
and has since frequented Hayling Bay. It is very wild owing to the
frequent attempts which have been made to shoot it. Sir Thomas
Troubridge also writes to me from Beaulieu that a Flamingo was seen
there on the 21st September, which flew in from the east and pitched
near the mouth of the Beaulieu river, and remained for a day.
(2) Further, a Scaly-breasted Lorikeet escaped from my outdoor
aviary in September, was seen about the garden for a day or two, and
then disappeared. A naval friend of mine who was in H.M.S. Royal
Sovereign told me the other day that a bird of this description flew on
to the ship when she was eighty miles from land in the North Sea and
was captured, and is now safely at the home of the captain of the
ship. Unfortunately the bird was not ringed, so it is impossible to
prove anything. Owing to the rarity of the species in England, it is
extremely likely to have been my bird.

BIRDS RETURN TO DESERTED NEST

Sir, --So far as my own experience of birds during nesting has been,
the usual proceedings have been that when a pair deserted a nest, which
they had made considerable progress with in building, and then chose
another site, that pair has deserted the original nest finally and for
the rest of the season. But last year a pair of Robins acted differently
in that they started early in March to build a nest in a shed in the
garden, where several bits of netting were stored up, some placed
against the wall; and soon a large collection of dead leaves, about
15 inches long, were placed on top of a heap of netting, just where it
touched the wall. Now as Robins will build in all sorts of peculiar places,
there was nothing unusual in such position, nor in the fact that as the
nest got disturbed (by the netting being later accidentally moved a
little by a man) the Robins retired from it and started a second nest

outside the shed, this second nest being in a hedge several
yards away.
Then came what seems to me the peculiar part of their behaviour.
After working for about ten days in this second building, where they
were undisturbed and collected a mass of leaves larger than a coconut
--during which time they were never seen to re- enter the shed above
mentioned--they suddenly, one day, both re-entered the shed, and
began again to work at the original nest, where they soon reared a
brood (all of which flew in safety). There was no doubt that it was the
same pair of birds ; and nothing was added to the second collection
of leaves in the hedge after the day when the pair returned to the shed.

Sir, --It may be of interest to our members to hear of a lighting&amp;apos;
arrangement that I have adopted for one of my aviaries, and which is
giving every satisfaction. I have a six-volt 60 amp. accumulator
(the bigger the amperage the better) and a small Osram lamp and an
electric timing clock such as is advertised for wireless. I set the clock
to light up at 5.30 a.m., and to shut off at 8 a.m. The birds are busy
feeding by 6 a.m., and can continue to do so, for when the light shuts
off it is daylight. The clock can be set to any time that is required,
but I have found the above times very suitable for breeding Budgerigars-
during the long nights.

larger than the house-fly, enters many country houses in autumn in
very large numbers for the purpose of hibernation, and is easily captured
on windows. There is no difficulty in keeping it alive until the spring if
it be confined in a place which is sunny, but not too hot, and be supplied
with moisture and a little sugar. Water is an absolute necessity to the
flies, and must be provided in a way which will ensure their finding it
without drowning themselves.
Being a perfectly clean feeder, the cluster fly is not unpleasant to
keep and handle, and should be a wholesome food for delicate birds.

WALLACE&amp;apos;S BIRD OF PARADISE
(SEMI 0 P TER A WALLACEI )
By Walter Goodfellow, F.Z.S.
For many years I had had a great desire to see this bird alive, and

intended when an opportunity came, to make an expedition to its island
home and be the first to introduce it to Europe, but the war and other
things intervened, and my hopes were not fulfilled until 1926. It is
certainly not one of the most beautiful members of this gorgeous family,
but there was always something about its eccentric appearance which
appealed to me irresistibly, and now that I have succeeded in capturing
and safely landing over here five examples, I confess that far from being
disappointed, I am more in love with it than ever. In fact, I may as
well say at once, that of all the Paradise Birds I know so far, this is my
favourite. Therefore, if I seem to some who have now seen it to be too
enthusiastic, they must excuse me. At the same time I am sure that
anybody who has kept one as long as I have will understand my
infatuation for it. Their tameness, inquisitiveness, and merry ways,
could not fail to appeal to everyone. They seem entirely without fear,
and this applies to them equally in their native jungle. They take an
intelligent interest in all one does, and at the same time keep up a
merry chatter ; in fact, their repertoire of notes is extraordinary,

sometimes reminding one of onr English. Starling on the chimney
stacks, bubbling, gurgling, and producing occasional explosive sounds
which shake their whole body. Other notes are reminiscent of the
King, and still others of the Rifle Bird.
Wallace first discovered the bird in the fifties of last century on the
island of Batchian, or,, to write it more correctly, Batj an, one of the
Moluccan islands ; perhaps the most beautiful of them all. Having
been almost all over the globe, I think I can say that these islands are
the most exquisite in all this world of ours. Later, it was found to occur
also on the much larger neighbouring island of Halmaheira, or as we
write it on our maps, Gilolo ; although Gilolo (or, rather, Djailolo) is
only a small town on the western side, nearly opposite to the better
known island of Ternate. My birds came from Halmaheira and belong
to the sub-species halmaherce, which has longer shoulder plumes than
those from Bat j an, and a more metallic violet shade on the top of
the head.
Perhaps, apart from the wonderful emerald green, resembling rich
silk, of the elongated breast shield, the first thing to strike one about the
bird, is its long flat head, which gives it a rather reptilian appearance.
In spite of this flatness, the bird is by no means stupid, quite the
contrary. The two long feathers which spring from each shoulder, arise
from two horny sheaths and are elongated spatula, whitish towards the
ends. These when at rest hang straight down towards the feet, but when
the bird is excited, and even at other times, stand out at right angles
to the body with a wild-Indian-like effect.
I had always understood the Malay name for the bird was " Burong
poelet ", the Epaulet Bird, but on Batjan X failed to find anyone who
knew it. The island has only a very small population, including five
whites, and is everywhere covered with dense virgin jungle, right to
the top of the mountains ; the most conspicuous peak being Goenong
Zibella. Failing to find anyone there to give me information about the
bird, I continued on up to Ternate, where reside many merchants in
the Paradise plume trade. Still among them I found only one who knew
the " Burong poelet " by name only. He said he must have had some
of the skins, although he could not recall what they were like, and he
believed they came from Patani, South-East Halmaheira. So to Patani

Walter Goodfelloio -- Wallace's Bird of Paradise 59
I booked by the first monthly boat, and so elusive did the bird seem, it
was like chasing a will-o'-the-wisp. Everywhere I inquired, all told the
same tale, " No Birds of Paradise were found on the island." At length,
when calling at Tobello on the north coast, where the Dutch have a
military post, I came across a man who had been a plume hunter in
New Guinea. He knew the bird and correctly described it. From him
I learnt that the local name was " Vecca-vecca " (nearly all birds'
names are doubled out there), that he had seen a few occasionally in the
jungle, knew nothing whatever of their habits, and thought it would be
very difficult to catch them alive. As this information did not seem very
promising, I thought it best to continue the journey to Patani, several
days further on.
We arrived at Patani early one morning, and I was quickly on shore,
having left all my baggage and stores on board until I had made further
inquiries. I went to the house of the " Kampong Kapala ", or head
man, who seemed very surprised when I told him what I was searching
for. " Oh yes," he said in Malay, " you mean the Wacca-wacca, there
are many here." Naturally I took this to be the local pronunciation of
" Yacca-vecca " up north, so hurried back to the boat and landed all
my gear. About an hour later the boat having already left, and as I
was arranging myself in a native house, I received a visit from several
of the head men of the village to know exactly what it was I wanted.
I explained that I had come from my country on the other side of the
world to get " Wacca-waccas ". One replied : " There they are," and
on looking through the open door, I saw many large black crows among
the coco-nut palms outside ! My ship was barely out of sight, but had
it been still in port I am sure I should have gone back with her instead of
being obliged to waste a whole month with no better prospects than
crows. Vainly I tried many times later to make them understand the
bird I wanted, minutely describing it. At length I made a fairly good
sketch of one, when one old man present exclaimed " the Burong
Piet " (but sometimes they pronounced it " Pleti "). Hunters from
Tidore had been there years before and shot some. Still I could not
hear how far away I should have to go to find them ; therefore I
engaged several men to go in different directions to try and locate them.
These men were most uninterested in the whole affair. I doubt if some

of them went at all, but others did report the results of their search.
I learnt that at one place five birds had been seen, and in another
three or four, but what I wanted them most to find were the feeding
trees, or dancing places, otherwise I did not see how I could catch
them. In this I had no success. One morning at daybreak I started off
with the men, when after a four hours' scramble and climb over sharp
coral trails, tumbling repeatedly, cutting hands and feet, we at length
came to rather high jungle where at last I did see three or four birds
very high up in the trees, looking very small in the distance ; but there
was no doubt about their really being Wallace's. They all had green
breasts, and seemed to be just moving along, and were soon out of sight.
The following day I visited another locality in the opposite direction,
with still worse luck, for we did not see even one bird, but finding a
small palm leaf shelter there I got my Indian boy to stop the night
there with one man to see if they could come across any in the very
early morning, the distance from Patani being too great to get there
early enough when the birds might be about. When he returned the
next day he informed me he had seen one or two birds, but could not
find any feeding trees. Things remained in this unsatisfactory state for
a long time. The people lost all interest, and evidently had no knowledge
how to catch birds, and in vain I tried to enlist their help. These people
are not jungle folks, but purely coast dwellers, cultivating little beyond
coco-nuts, and feeding chiefly on sago and fish. The whole of the interior
of the island seems to be uninhabited by any tribes.
During this time I was not idle myself, and as far as I could, wdthout
a guide or trails to follow up, I made many short journeys to the jungle-
clad hills at the back, till all my shoe leather was worn through on the
sharp outcrop of coral which one encounters everywhere. My body also
ached with rheumatism all over, through being constantly wet, and
sometimes sleeping out all night in the rain.
By the beginning of the third week I think I had abandoned all
hope of ever getting Wallace's Standard Wing ; then one night a man
came to me mysteriously, and said he knew a place where they
abounded. How many did I want, and what would I pay for them ? etc.,
etc. All this sounded too good to be true, especially as he was not
willing to take me along with him. Then another week, and still no

further news. The weather too was very wet and stormy. Real south-
east monsoon. I had just one week left before the boat was due to call
for me, and the only Birds I had managed to capture so far were a pair
of Insular Lories ( Eos insularis) and their young one, caught on the
nest; four Sun Birds, and a good number of Three-coloured Parrot
Finches ( Erythrum trichroa). This was the sum total of my collection,
but nice as these were, I had not come all that long journey just to get
them. I had other islands still to visit, and it was now the end of June,
and I naturally wanted to get home before the cold weather set in over
here. Then the man I have mentioned turned up again. He said the
birds were still there, but he could not catch them, so came to enlist
my help. I arranged to go with him early the next morning, and he
insisted that we must start before daylight, so that the villagers should
not see the way we went. Before daybreak we were off ; the party
consisting of the man and his young son, myself and my Indian servant.
After the same hard climbing up and down, perhaps three hours, of
it, we came to a stunted kind of jungle. A few enormous trees grew here
and there, but the majority were saplings of 30 or 40 feet high,
straight, and with few branches, and these quite short; very little
undergrowth, in some places none at all. Perhaps after being dis-
appointed so many times, my surprise may be imagined when I saw in
comparatively low trees at the very least thirty Wallace's Birds. I
really could hardly believe my eyes, and out of all this number possibly
not more than two females, or birds in brown plumage. The others
seemed to be all fully adult males. My guide had certainly done his
best to catch them. He must have put up scores of limed twigs, some
being long tapering bamboos 20 or more feet long, with lime on
the extreme ends. This bird-lime is made out of the sap of the bread-
fruit-tree, and in the Aru Islands I have myself caught apodas with it.
In the present case I think it had been badly prepared, as he said
birds had repeatedly settled on it and were not held. The birds were all
constantly on the move, flying backwards and forwards from tree to
tree with a great fluttering of their wings, and at times hanging in all
sorts of positions from the slender branches, some turning round and
round like a cartwheel, and all the time making a variety of squawks
and calls. Wallace, in his Malay Archipelago, speaks of their restless

movements, and emphasizes a habit they had of clinging to tree trunks
after the manner of Woodpeckers. I think from his description I had
always imagined this was a common habit of theirs, therefore I was
looking for it, but never once saw them do it. I can quite believe,
however, that they may do so, for even in a cage they are constantly
hanging upside-down, turning round and round the perch, and assuming
all manner of queer attitudes. Wallace also says : " The females and
young males far outnumbered the fully plumaged birds, which renders
it probable that the extraordinary accessory plumes are not fully
developed until the third or fourth year." This was the opposite to my
experience, for I did not see one half-plumaged bird among any I came
across. It may be that the females were away nesting during June and
July, and that the one or two entirely brown birds which I took to be
females were really young males.
Although we were plainly visible, the birds were not in the least
alarmed at our presence ; in fact, some came lower down to look at
us, and one or two came within 15 feet. Neither then nor on subsequent
visits could I find any fruit-trees in the neighbourhood, and I never
did find out what they live on. Of course, it would have been easy
enough to have shot one to see what it had in its stomach, but this
would have frightened them away, the very last thing I wanted to do.
Wallace, again, says " They seem to feed principally on fruit, but
probably take insects occasionally ". My experience now is that they
are very insectivorous, and certainly prefer green-coloured insects, with
a pronounced partiality for the large soft-bodied grasshoppers, nearly
5 or 6 inches long, which live on the branches of the coco-nut palms.
It was a lesson in anatomy to watch the expert way they dissected
these insects, and also the large tropical cockroaches. These preferences
were, of course, noted in the early days of their captivity. They
naturally change later.
Looking at the birds from below, in the jungle, they appeared to be
so very light in colour, almost white. The under sides of the wings are
whitish, but I don't think that accounted for it all. After we had caught
the first bird, the man remarked : " There must be two kinds, for the
others are white." I saw some of the birds with their green breast-
shields elevated, not horizontally, but perpendicularly, so that the head

only is seen looking through at the deep V-shaped base of green feathers.
At this time the long shoulder plumes stand out at right angles below
the shield. These whitish plumes are constantly raised and depressed.
The short scalelike feathers on the top of the head, which are silvery
purple, also seem to undulate with a curious effect. Of course, this I
only noticed in captivity, as it requires a certain position of the head to
show it off, otherwise this colour effect is not even suspected.
As I have before said, I was always looking for their dancing places
in the jungle, but I now feel certain that these low trees formed a dancing
place, and what I saw there, the display, otherwise why did they frequent
it more than any other spot, for it certainly was not their feeding
ground ? I spent the remainder of the first day at this place and noticed
that at midday all the birds disappeared. A few, I believe, remained
in the dense top of one of the great trees near by, and came out again
for a short time later in the afternoon. It did not take me long to note
that certain trees were more frequented than others, so the next day
we started to put up the nets. The trees were far too slender to allow
of anyone but a very light person climbing them, so I sent my Indian
boy up. As he was arranging the first net one bird came within
3 yards of him to watch the proceedings and as soon as the boy came
down it went and shook the net with its bill. I was standing at the base
of the tree and at once gave it a shake, when the bird flew right into the
net , so I got my first Wallace, and this is the bird now in the Zoo.
It was so inextricably entangled, the whole net had to be taken down
with the bird in it. As the boy was coming down with it its screams
brought all the other birds around, and I am sure if I had then had all
the other nets up my scoop would have been a large one. This habit of
coming to a companion in distress is not, of course, peculiar
to Paradise Birds, but I have many times seen plume hunters in the
Aru Islands and in New Guinea take advantage of this and deliberately
wound a bird and keep it tied up out of sight under a dancing tree
for its cries to attract the other birds, so that they could more easily
shoot them.
After catching the first bird there was great excitement in the
village. Men, women, and children crowded around my house en masse,
possibly thinking it would be on public view. Needless to say, they were

sadly disappointed. Advice was freely given as to what I should, and
should not, feed it on, and this from people who had not only never
seen the bird before, but did not even know such a bird inhabited their
island. Many were now anxious to try their hands at bird catching,
tempted by the reward I had given to the man who showed me the
place, and all sorts of rases had to be adopted to avoid giving the
locality away. Others were curious to know how I, a foreigner, knew
these birds lived there. As one man said : "We don&amp;apos;t know the birds
in your country.&quot;
This last week of my stay was unfortunately very wet, and during
rain or dull weather no birds came out at all. This further convinces
me that I had found a real dancing place ; but with one ray of sunshine,
birds suddenly appeared from somewhere, and at such times during the
remainder of the week, we managed to secure four more birds, three
males and one female. I was at first very doubtful if such restless birds
would take kindly to cage life, especially in comparatively small
travelling cages. All fears, however, were soon set at rest by the birds
feeding at once , and showing no signs of fear whatever. They greedily
snatched green grasshoppers from my fingers the first day.
When the boat came to fetch me away the weather was so bad that
it was quite impossible for the ship's launch to get through the raging
surf, although several attempts were made to do so. A native in his
catamaran managed to reach the ship, and by him the captain sent me
a note to say that if I could manage to get over the mountains to the
other side of the peninsular, he would pick me up there. In spite of
the pouring rain, I had instantly to hunt up men to carry all my kit
over ; no light task, and after endless trouble I got some forty carriers,
the bulk of them being anything but volunteers. Cases had to be
hurriedly broken open and the contents distributed almost anyhow
among them, for so steep are the mountains that not even moderately
bulky packages can be carried over. The journey took about four hours
in almost continuous rain, and water poured down the steep trail like
a waterfall. Two of my birds had been caged less than twenty-four
hours, and yet they came through it all in perfect condition. That is
the great charm about Wallace's Birds, their tameness and good sense
makes them ideal birds to move about. When crossing the range

I several times heard others calling in the jungle, and at these places
I noticed an abundance of wild nutmeg trees growing, which inclines
me to think that they may feed on this fruit. In New Guinea I have
found the Raggianas and Rifle Birds very fond of it. They swallow
the nut whole with the lacelike mace encircling it. After the latter is
digested the nut is ejected.
Without counting any Bower Birds, this makes twenty-two species
of Paradise Birds that have been in captivity over here ; while no other
country has yet had even half that number. I have brought twenty
species, and seventeen of them for the first time. I have counted in this
number only two species of Manucodes, although I am sure we have
had more.

Nine of these birds were obtained, some from Mr. Carl Hagenbeck
and some from Mr. Falzfield, between 1911 and 1913. They showed no
signs of nesting until July of 1926. One of the birds was then missed,
and on search being made was found sitting on six eggs. The eggs were
lifted and put under a hen. Four goslings were hatched, one of which
died after three days. Another nest of six eggs was found, all of which
had been destroyed. This probably accounted for a single egg which
was found a week later and proved fertile. The eggs were removed
from the hen and put in an incubator to hatch out to avoid the danger of
the hen killing the young birds by trampling upon them. The period
of incubation was twenty-five days. The young birds were put in a foster-
mother on a grass lawn. They were a dull grey brown all over when in
down, except the face, which was dark brown. They did well, feeding
on grass only. In six weeks' time they showed a good deal of colour
on their feathers, and by the end of September were in full plumage
as regards colour and markings.
At this day, 17th January, all survive.

by Mr. H. L. Popham at the foot of cliffs, the clutches consisting of
from seven to nine creamy white eggs. It migrates south in winter
to the southern shores of the Caspian and even as far as the northern
portions of Africa. It occasionally wanders to the British Isles,
to Sweden, Denmark, Northern Germany, Holland, and France.
That it was known to the ancient Egyptians is proved by the picture
known as " The Geese of Medum ", for a photograph of which I am
indebted to my friend, Mr. F. L. Berney, who when sending it wrote
as follows : " The photo is of what is said to be the oldest picture in the
world. The age is early fourth dynasty, say, 3,000 years b.c. Found in
a chamber tomb at Medum on the Nile, where it formed part of the wall
decoration. The birds depicted are, first and last, Anser cinereus ,
first pair Anser albifrons, second pair Branta ruficollis. It is pleasant
to think that in those far-off times there must have been
ornithologists and painters of birds, Thorburns and Keulemans.
Wealthy Egyptians of those days had the walls of their tombs decorated
with scenes such as had interested them during life, their work, their
hobbies, pastimes, and so on ; and the owner of the tomb was evidently
one who took pleasure in watching the rare and interesting birds he
kept in captivity. When one realizes that the painting is nearly
5,000 years old it has to be acknowledged that it is a wonderful piece of
work." The Bed-breasted Goose is very rare in living collections at
the present day, and a female received by the Zoological Society in
1858 appears to have been the only example that that institution has
possessed. The breeding of the species at Woburn is an event of very
great interest.-- Ed.]

The breeding season of 1926 was like all others, in that it did not
come up to expectations. Still some interesting results were obtained ;
and the following notes may be of some interest to members of the
Avicultural Society.

total this year being seven. Some of these have been disposed of. A
sufficient breeding stock has been retained, but an infusion of new blood
would be an advantage. These birds roost out summer and winter on
large trees in the park. It is an interesting fact that, about a year ago
the birds abandoned their favourite perch, and took to an adjoining
tree. About a fortnight later the original tree, which had shown signs
of decay about the roots, broke off short and fell to the ground. It
looks as though the birds had some feeling that all was not well with it.
Red Junglefowl, of which I received a trio from Rangoon a few years
ago, do very well here, and a considerable number of young has been
hatched. They are " as hard as nails ", and give no trouble. The hens
hatch their own eggs and are excellent mothers. This year they got
little encouragement and only eight were reared, though a large number
of eggs was laid.
Pheasants have been rather disappointing, only five Golden, ten
Silver, and six Amherst having been reared. Reeves were a blank,
one adverse factor having been an inveterate egg-eating hen ! By
accident two Amherst-Golden hybrids have also been obtained. I
am still hoping to get, at some future time, eggs from a nice pair of
Monaul Pheasants, though these, I understand, are likely to be few and
far between. The only other species represented here at present is the
Crestless Pireback, of which two odd hens are in residence.
Ducks, which comprise Japanese Teal, Pintail, White-faced
Whistling Tree Ducks, an odd Widgeon, Mandarin, Carolina, and
Yellow Bills, have not done much, there being only four young each
from the two last named. The Yellow Bills have had a few young in
previous seasons.
A very interesting acquisition to the collection arrived from
Wellington, New Zealand, recently, in the shape of a pair of " Pukekos "
or " Swamp Hens ". These are Blue Rails native to that country and
with their glossy black-green backs and indigo blue breasts they are
very attractive looking birds. It should be possible, given more natural
surroundings, to breed these birds, but as they are confined meantime
in an ordinary Pheasant run there is little prospect of doing so. I am
rather loth to turn them into the Waders' aviary, where they would find
water and a considerable amount of rough cover, as I fear they would

make short work of the contents of any small Finch nests that might
be built in the bushes. These birds appear quite healthy, but do not
relish frosty weather much.
As might be expected, there are no results to report from Waders,
though some excitement was occasioned in the spring when a Knot
was seen squatting in a hollow beneath a grass tuft. It may have been
broody, but no further developments took place. Each year some of
these birds assume the full breeding plumage.
The small Finch fry flying in the Waders' aviary never seem to have
much luck with their numerous nests. Two or three broods of Zebra
Finches were, however, hatched in boxes, and two or three young
Waxbills also appeared. Most, if not all, of these seem to have died out.
While the above results may seem meagre, some very interesting
hybrids have been hatched in addition to the Pheasants already
mentioned. From a Vulturine Guinea Fowl cock and a Common Guinea
Fowl hen fifteen eggs were obtained and hatched by various foster-
mothers. The hen, it may be mentioned, is itself a curiosity, it being a
pale lavender-coloured " freak " bred here from ordinary coloured stock.
The young " favour " the male in their first plumage. The Vulturine,
in common with his progeny, seemed hardly hardy enough for this
climate, and he unfortunately succumbed after a frosty night.
Another interesting cross was obtained from cock Bed Junglefowl
and a common hen Pheasant, which for want of other accommodation
was turned down with them. There was a considerable overplus of
young cocks in the pen at the time, which fact no doubt favoured the
fertilization of the Pheasant's eggs. A last year's bird of this cross
(unfortunately a hen) is now a very robust bird. It is even larger than
its mother, which it generally resembles, though the brown body colour
is considerably richer or redder. The head and neck are black. There
are two young this year from this mating, one of which I am in hopes
may turn out to be a cock. Has anyone heard of this cross before ?
A most interesting hybrid, which I believe is undoubtedly the first
of its kind, was obtained in the Waders' aviary. Amongst the
miscellaneous Finch oddments was a large Yellow and Black Grosbeak,
said to be from South America. It was described as a " Giant Yellow-
bellied Grosbeak ". There was also an odd green Cardinal hen which

had lost its mate. This bird was seen to be carrying food, but for a
time it was only observed to be assisting a hen Blackbird, attending to
its Grey-winged Ousel hybrid progeny. One day, however, the Cardinal
was seen, after visiting the Blackbird's nest, to pop into an adjoining
compartment. From its actions it appeared to be feeding there also,
and when the Grosbeak was seen to lend a helping hand from time to
time it was surmised that something out of the common was happening.
(It may be explained that the nests were situated right on top of the
wall in the shelter, much too high up for any inspection.) In due course
one young hybrid Blackbird flew from the first nest, and some days after
a young bird from the second nest was found on the floor in the shelter.
It had apparently made rather a premature departure from its home, as
it was little more than half-fledged and quite unable to fly. It was well
looked after by its parents, however, the cock bird particularly, which
kept continually packing it with food. It soon acquired sufficient
strength to clamber about the bushes and finally to fly strongly about
the aviary, where it quickly developed into a strong, bold bird. It
considerably resembled a Cardinal in dull plumage, but had a larger
beak, intermediate in size between those of its parents. It eventually
became pretty much the " boss " in the aviary, from which it appears
likely that it was a cock. It is very much to be regretted that one has
now to speak of this interesting bird in the past tense. It was picked
up dead early in January. It may have fallen foul of its male parent,
which bird was showing signs of coming into breeding condition, and
had been standing up to its precocious offspring more boldly ! Most
unfortunately the body of the young bird was too much damaged by
mice to make the skin worth preserving.
THE BLACK RAIL (LIMNOCORAX NIGER)
By G. H. Gurney, F.E.S.
Amongst the very interesting consignment of African birds recently
imported by Messrs. Gamage, Ltd., were several examples of the little
Bail (Limnocorax niger). In their printed list, which was sent to many
members of the Avicultural Society, these birds were classed as new to
Aviculture. But I brought one back alive from East Africa in 1908,
and Monsieur Delacour had two in his aviaries at Cleres six years ago ;

this pair he gave to me and I still have one of them in the best of health,
the other escaped soon after it came here, and was never seen again.
The bird I have at present is a hen, and has laid single eggs
on two occasions, making a nest of broken pieces of rush, close
to the pool of water in its aviary ; needless to say that they did
not hatch, though the old bird sat assiduously. But now that several
have come over, there should be no difficulty in breeding this charming
little species. With me it is quite hardy, which one would expect, as
certainly in some parts of Africa it lives at a considerable elevation,
where the nights are very cold. I have seen it at various places in ^ast
Africa; on Lake Naivasha it was abundant, and much less secretive in
its habits than the Rails generally are, differing much in this aspect
from its big cousin, the Green-headed Porphyrio, which was equally
common on Naivasha, but seldom observed owing to its skulking habits.
The Black Rails ran freely about on the leaves of the blue water-lilies
in company with Jacanas. I sometimes caught them in traps baited
with cheese, set for small mammals, and once I dislodged one from a
large Weaver Bird's nest, built in tall reeds hanging over the water.
In the streams and rivers they did not appear to be so common, although
Crakes of other species were obtained ; probably the Black Rail prefers
a wider expanse of water.
I find mine are great vegetable feeders, and probably require a
considerable amount of green food.

the line of a hedge. Then a large wood of beech trees, laid across
the ridge, like a great mantle thrown over one shoulder of the landscape,
and a chalk-pit set at its foot; which, facing west, at sundown becomes
filled with rose colour. This is the Rooky wood, which gives shelter
to a large community ; and it was from this wood Rookster came to us.
One of my children who, when very young, had the pretty idea
that it was customary on one's own birthday to give presents to others,
brought him to me as a gift. With the candour of childhood that
renders it unable to keep a secret, he had spoken daily of this surprise
for some time before the right date fell. " It isn't out of a shop, you
know," he would say, a silken head nodding wisely : " It is nothing
that you can buy." Then, with a sudden largesse of confidence, with
both hands tightly squeezed the better to keep back a part, at least,
of the previous news : " It is something that Glod is making nicer
and nicer for you, every day ! " This meant that Reuben, the garden
boy, had said that the rook was as yet too young to be taken ; and so
another week would have to be passed in this struggle for silence.
Then one morning the day arrived. I saw them coming from
far off across the open valley, threading their way by the narrow plank
bridges set over the runlets and glittering streams that feed the water
meadows, brilliant with marsh marigold. There was the tall figure of
the nursery maid, the small figure in a blue overall, Reuben, stout in
corduroy, with a ladder, and--when they were nearer--the young Rook.
He was easy enough to rear. He would take large pieces of milk-
sop, thin shreds of meat, soaked biscuit, anything ; and soon he was
sitting comfortably enough on the edge of his wastepaper basket,
that was weighted against overturning by containing a large flint.
He was crafty from the first. He would be intrigued by the clefts
between the closed fingers of my hand, and he would prise them apart
with an investigating bill, and an air of great secrecy. Anything slightly
hidden or an outline suggesting concealment would hold his attention
at once. As he grew older this led to trouble, for he was more destructive
than a Jackdaw, and, if not cleverer, more alert than a Raven. " To
hoard," this was his motto ; and he remained as thin as a bone, because
anything that he liked eating, he immediately hid. He would take the
smallest portion, and then in a series of long elastic leaps or a sidling

walk, lie would be off with the remainder. So his whole life was one
long-drawn-out starvation, enhanced by delicious concealments, and
crafty storings in garden cupboards. If no further food had been
forthcoming, would he, I wonder, have remembered where he had hidden
those bones ? The pleasantest part of his character was his sense of
companionship. This led him not only to occupy himself ceaselessly
with our feet, shoe leather presenting pleasant beak-work, but also
to accompany us on a walk. He was never shut into a cage. His cage
was what all cages should be, a place of rest and security wherein he
could sleep, or find food, or drink if he wanted. So he would suddenly
appear in the air beside us, as we started on a walk ; he would fly
about eight feet above the ground, alighting ahead of us. There he
would sit till we reached him, then he would take another flight, and
so on, about twenty or thirty feet away. He always flew on our left.
But after a certain distance the territory instinct arrested him--he
did not care to go far from the house. This is curious when one considers
how far afield are the flights of the wild Rooks.
He was mischievous, and more inquisitive than Fatima. He never
outgrew the interest that carpets aroused. What was underneath ?
This is what intrigued him. The edge of a rug which could be easily
lifted was a matter for peering investigation. He took great trouble
to undo one's shoelaces, he would even unlace a shoe. Thus he passed
his life in ceaseless investigation, and when he died it was from eating
what even his powerful gizzard found indigestible. He had stolen a
pin-cushion from one of the bedrooms, and, taking it to pieces, had made
too light of the pins.
I would never have another Rook ; not from sentiment, except in
so far as sentiment means right feeling, but because Rooks are more
beautiful in their setting of wild life, in their own environment. Here,
on Salisbury Plain, they are seen to great advantage ; large numbers
out on the open Down, gleaming in the winter sun ; or some few, near
at hand and looking unexpectedly large and noble, alighting on the
lichen-grown railings that surround a lonely dew pond, the summer
sunlight waking bronze or purple lights in their sombre plumes. Or
again in November, printing the sunset sky with their dark forms, as
they cross the valley, passing overhead in steady battalions ; one or

two leaders, then the full company, and a straggling few bringing
up the rear. On summer nights, about ten o'clock, in the warm twilight,
they make their sonorous tumult in the trees ; a sound that has some-
thing in it of the volume of the sea.
In March the Rooks make their joy-flights. It is as much a sign of
spring as the scent of moss in the copses, or the sight of snowdrops
spearing through last year's leaves ; and it accords well with the song
of the Missel-thrush that has so much weather in it; for the Rooks
let themselves be blown about the sky.
Every year one should save the young of the Missel-thrushes from
the Jackdaws, in recognition of their song in February and March.
W. H. Hudson is right when he tells us that our attitude towards
creatures should be expressed in the injunction : " Pet none, persecute
none." Yet how far easier it is not to persecute than not to pet !
Every spring, as it comes round, I am tempted afresh to bring birds
up by hand.&amp;apos; I get such pleasure from this. I love their dependence
on me ; I love, through this, to learn their ways. I had a hand-reared
Wren this spring, a rare achievement. It would play about the rose
bushes gathering aphis, and return to one's hand as to a chosen abode.
The delicacy of its ways cannot be described, nor the beauty of its
face. Shakespeare says somewhere, as a term of endearment: " Here
comes the youngest of nine Wrens " ! He knew what it looked like. If I
wore a silken dress it bathed on its surface ; it appeared to be enchanted
by the soft touch of the material. It would go into a perfect folly of
movement, making all the gestures of throwing water-drops over its
back, just as a bird does when it bathes among wet leaves. I should
never have known wild birds have this custom had I not once brought
up a Blue Tit by hand. This Tit would take its bath in the watercress
on the breakfast table. One day I was sitting in the aviary. That pest
of quiet summer hours arrived, a face fly ; the fly that will occupy
itself pertinaciously with one's face, and goes from eye to eye, as if
undecided into which to plunge. The Wren was playing around me, so
I stooped and took it in my hand ; then I held my Wren up to my face,
and caught the fly with it. It was most neatly done ; and--as one is
usually the helpless victim of such a fly--extraordinarily satisfactory.
I brought up a Wood-pigeon last year ; this year my care is a young

Rock Peplar. It is of the species called the Black-tailed Parrakeet;
two others with it were hatched in the aviary here. I took it from the
nest when it was still in down, which was like eiderdown in quality,
with just a hint of lovely fruit-coloured feathers showing from the
quills. I feed it from my lips, with bitten-up brown bread and rasp-
berries ; with banana, and gooseberry pulp; sometimes biscuit
moistened by a bite of a peach, varying this with lettuce. It connects
the sight of my face now with nourishment, though it is still uncertain
what exactly is the point of happy contact, for it sometimes makes a
hopeful dive into my ear. It holds its head high, swaying on a rope-
neck, making the while a rasping noise with its brilliant persimmon-
tinted beak held open.
It shall fly free in the garden when it is fully grown. None of our
birds have their wings cut. Those small African Finches, called Cordon
Bleus, fly free among the trees, returning to eat and bathe in their
cage on the window sill. Their blue feathers look exquisite against
the green of an ilex tree.

A very interesting account of an interview with a bird and animal
dealer, Mr. Foglia, of Adelaide, appeared in the Adelaide Register
of 20th November last.
Mr. Foglia had just returned from a collecting trip to the Kimberley
district, in the far north of Western Australia, where bird life appears
to be exceedingly abundant, but where occasional seasons of drought
result in great mortality :--
" As far as bird life is concerned in those parts, he said, an abundance
of feed and water had resulted in remarkable increases in the bird
population, including the larger types, such as Ibis, Native Companions,
Turkeys, Geese, and Ducks ; and the area could only be described as
' Nature's sanctuary '. Untouched by the ravages of the white man for
the greater part of the year, the Kimberleys especially had become their
natural feeding ground. Mr. Foglia said he had been in other parts of
Australia, but he had never had any idea of the extent of bird life
existent there. It was amazing, and he could not understand, after a

visit to those parts, why people agitated for the protection of Australian
natural animal and bird life. A sojourn in the far north of Australia
convinced one that there was little need for a policy of protection along
those lines. Of course, those people engaged in the pursuit of birds
were protectionists in themselves. To take 100,000 birds away was a
mere drop in the ocean ; but there was now the danger of an epidemic
wiping the birds out over the coming wet season and during the
succeeding months. The birds multiplied to such an extent during a
succession of good seasons that when subsequently feed became short,
nature in her own way counter-acted this influence through disease,
leaving the fittest to act as the rejuvenators of the species. There was
thus always sufficient feed to satisfy the wants of the bird community.
Disease was manifesting itself at the moment, for all the birds caught
were thin and miserable looking ; but, when fed well during three weeks
of captivity had recovered. He felt sure that a trip next year would be
comparatively futile. His investigations showed him that these diseases
occurred about every six or seven years."

II. The Platycercinae
Besides certain anatomical distinctions the Platycercinse are
recognizable by their short beaks which may be light or dark grey,
but never red, their longish legs and long broad tails. The genus is
peculiar to Australia and Tasmania.
The Rosella Parrakeet (Platycercus eximius), from South-East
and South-West Australia is the best known member of its genus, and
one of the most beautiful. Its cheeks are white, its head, neck, and
breast and the feathers under the tail are red ; its belly is yellow, and
the mantle greenish yellow, every feather having a black centre ;
wings blue and black ; rump and back green ; tail blue and green ;
beak whitish ; feet grey ; eyes brown. It is the same size as the Ring-
necked Parrakeet. The sexes are very much alike, but the male is a
trifle bigger and brighter coloured, with a thicker head and larger beak ;

the most reliable distinction lies in the colouring of the little feathers
at the back of the eye ; they are brownish green in the normal adult
female, while in the adult male they are invariably red. Most females
have their flights spotted with white, and there is a green bar from the
back of the neck to the centre of the head ; these two latter features
are rarely found among adult males, though immature specimens may
display them.
The young on leaving the nest resemble their parents, but the red
covers a smaller area, and all the colours are paler and the black marks
less distinct. The full colouring appears gradually, and is complete
after the first moult. If kept in a large aviary and well cared for Rosellas
may breed when a year old, but more often do not nest until the
following season. This applies also to the whole family of Platycerci
and Barnardii. Rosellas, like all the family, are quarrelsome when paired
and in good condition, single and weakly birds are less spiteful. They
specially dislike their own and closely allied kinds, but are dangerous
with all weaker Parrakeets; they will not usually molest small Passerine
birds as long as these keep out of the way, unless the aviary is over-
crowded. Rosellas should be fed on admixture of two parts of Canary
to one of hemp, one of millet, one of sunflower seed, and one of oats,
together with monkey nuts ; they require green food and fruit,
preferring apples, cherries, and gooseberries. They do not care for
grapes or oranges, which are liked by the Palaeornis. Groundsel, chick-
weed, sprouting oats, flowering grass, and lettuce are all acceptable,
and they love a fresh branch of some non-poisonous tree, of which they
will eat the buds and nibble the bark.
Rosellas are fond of bathing and should never be without water.
They are perfectly hardy once they have moulted, and can be wintered
out of doors if they have protection from rain and wind. Most
Platycerci are stupid about using their shelter and often will not
enter it, and prefer to freeze outside: they must therefore be
accustomed to their shelter by being shut into it for some days at the
start by being fed there. It is also wise to shut them up every night.
Young birds of the year need more protection than adults.
Platycerci do well in a movable aviary such as I have described in
my general notes on Parrots. Failing this, they should if possible be

placed in a fixed aviary, with a cement floor. They are long-lived if
given room to use their wings even in a small aviary, but it is cruel to
shut them up in a cage, and under these conditions few survive longer
than two or three years. A large aviary is needed if they are to breed
satisfactorily, for if confined in a small space they often rear only sickly
or crippled young ones. Hollow logs or boxes make good nests for
them, but there should be at least two for each pair, as the hen often
lays a second time before the first family is fledged, the male parent
taking entire charge of the latter. If the hen bird has to wait until the
first brood have flown she may pluck them in the nest, or she may herself
start moulting, in which case all hope of a second brood is lost. There is
no fear that the father will neglect his youngsters. The young must be
separated from the old birds as soon as the male begins to grow
impatient with them and drives them off. The usual clutch is from four
to six eggs.
Rosellas cross freely with allied species, and the hybrids are generally
fertile.
The Yellow-Mantled Parrakeet (P. splendidus), described by
Gould as a distinct species, is really only a local variety of Rosella, and
is even prettier and more brilliantly coloured. The edges of the feathers
of its mantle are golden yellow, with little or no green tinge. It is rarely
imported, and I have only seen four cocks and one hen alive.
A cock Platycercus whose hen is shut up can be safely given his
freedom and will not go farther than half a mile from her aviary.
He may bite off some fruit buds in spring and nibble apples in the
autumn, but he will not do much mischief, and it is easy to shut him up
for a few weeks when necessary.
The Platycerci will breed at liberty, but pairs are sometimes inclined
to wander and nothing smaller than a cock Rosella is safe from the
attacks of the Tawny Owl, who is the worst enemy of exotic birds which
have been set at liberty, and is the cause of many mishaps. If it is
desired to set a pair at liberty it is wise to wait until they have bred
once in an aviary. The cock should then be let out on a calm evening,
somewhere where he can see and hear the hen and where he will not be
afraid to come down and visit her ; his food should be placed on the
top of the aviary. Some days later the hen can be released, also in the

evening, taking particular care that she sees her mate as soon as she is
let out. Nesting places must be put up and Starlings, which take
possession of these, must be shot, for, strange to say, these birds can
overcome Parrakeets, even as large as Pennants.
All Platycerci have a great fondness for exploring chimneys and must
be prevented, as far as possible, from amusing themselves in this way.
The worst danger is that a bird may come out in an uninhabited room,
where it may die of hunger before it is discovered. A movable wire
netting top to the chimneys will not interfere with the sweeping, and
prevents Parrakeets from entering, which they will do at all times of
year. Young birds reared at liberty must be caught up as soon as they
can feed themselves, or they become too independent, take long distance
flights and annoy the neighbours by robbing their orchards.
It must not be forgotten that a pair of Platycerci are far more
spiteful at liberty than a cock whose hen is shut up, and more disposed
to drive away all their fellows. If a Parrakeet at liberty happens to die,
if its mate is not replaced, it must be caught up at once, or it will stray
and be lost.
Pennant's Parrakeet (P. elegans) is decidedly larger than the
R-osella ; it is a native of East and South Australia. Its colour is a
fine carmine red, with pale blue cheeks, wings, and tail; the flights
and rectrices are in part blackish green. The feathers in the mantle have
black centres. The sexes are alike, but the hen is smaller and her head
and beak are slighter. This species ranges over a wide territory, and
there are local varieties which vary in size and the amount of black in
their plumage. The beak is grey and white, iris brown and feet greyish
black. When the young leave the nest they are deep green, with blue
cheeks, have a few red feathers on the throat, and some blue ones on
the wings and tail. The red feathers appear gradually through the
green ones during autumn and winter, and the adult plumage is com-
pleted after the first moult. Young birds have been known to leave the
nest wearing the adult red plumage, but this is exceptional.
Pennants are the least quarrelsome of the large Platycerci, but this
does not mean that they are amiable with other birds ; they are
merely the mildest of a very quarrelsome family. They should be
treated in the same way as Rosellas. A cock bird whose hen is shut up

in the aviary does well loose, has nothing to fear from Owls, and
produces a very fine effect in a garden. A pair at liberty very often
disappoint their owner by staying several months and disappearing
when they appear on the point of nesting. In order to succeed with a
pair it is necessary to have a very steady cock, for among the Platycerci
it is the cock bird who decides the movements of the pair.
The Adelaide Parrakeet (P. adelaidce), from South and Central
Australia, is classed by certain authorities as a variety of Pennant. In
my opinion it may very well be a hybrid between P. elegans and
P. flaveolus, which has become fixed and now comes true.
The Adelaide differs from the Pennant by the paler red of its
plumage, which has a yellowish tinge, and the mantle has pale orange
red edges. Individuals vary much in colour; some are very like Pennants,
but the majority look very different and wear a mixture of colours which
makes them appear at once beautiful and remarkable. The sexes are
alike, the head and beak offering the only distinction. Young birds
are like Pennants, but their green is more golden in shade. They
require the same treatment as the preceding species.
The Yellow-rumped Parrakeet (P. flaveolus) comes from the
same locality, but is very rare in confinement. It may be described as
a small Pennant, whose red has everywhere been replaced by pale
yellow tinged with olive. The sexes are much alike in colour, but the
young seem to be much greener than the adults. A male which I
possessed was exceedingly quarrelsome. The same treatment as
the above.
The Yellow-bellied Parrakeet ( P . flaviventris), from Tasmania,
only differs from the last named by having the back, wings, and rump
dark green. Both sexes are alike in colour, but the hen may readily be
known by her weaker beak and small head. The young are distinguish-
able by their green breasts and more uniformly green backs.
This species is the most delicate of the Platycerci. Although easy
to feed and not much affected by cold, it is very subject to septicaemia,
tuberculosis, and other diseases. It does best in a movable aviary
with plenty of grass, and the site must be changed annually. It must
not be too much exposed to the sun in summer, but enjoys it at other
times of the year ; besides seed and fruit, it should have some meal-
worms. It resembles the Rosella in disposition.

The Mealy Kosella (P. pallidiceps) inhabits the east and the interior
of Australia ; it has the top of the head and back of the neck pale
yellow, the cheeks white, mantle greenish yellow mixed with black,
the under tail feathers red, the lower back, rump, and all the under
parts are pale blue. The hen is smaller and not as brightly coloured as
her mate. The young are less distinctly marked, and there is a shade
of green in their plumage.
This species should be treated like the others. Once acclimatized,
it is as hardy as any other of the family, but when newly imported
they are subject to chills and need watching. With ordinary precautions
they are not difficult to breed at liberty or in an aviary. A variety
(P. amathusia) living in North Australia has blue cheeks and a greener
mantle. It is very rarely imported, although very beautiful.
Brown's Parrakeet (P. venustus) from North Australia is smaller
than the above-named species. Many people consider this the most
beautiful of its genus ; its head is black with white cheeks ; under parts,
lower back, and rump straw coloured, each feather narrowly edged with
black ; sub-caudals red ; the feathers of the mantle are black edged
with straw colour ; the wings and tail violet blue. The female is smaller
and not as brightly coloured as the male. They require the same treat-
ment as the rest of the genus. But, like Palliceps, they must be protected
from cold on first arrival; afterwards they may be looked upon as
quite hardy. They do not breed as freely as the other Platycerci,
being slow to accustom themselves to our seasons, persistently moulting
in May and laying in September. Young birds hatched during autumn
and reared in a heated aviary rarely makegood specimens ; it is better
to exercise patience and only to provide nesting boxes in April and to
remove them at the end of August. If this plan be rigorously persevered
with the birds will moult earlier every year and finally go to nest in
July. Needless to say, it is quite useless to allow Brown's to nest outside
in cold weather ; if the hen does not die of egg binding the young will
certainly perish soon after they are hatched. For no apparent reason,
many more hens than cocks are imported. There is a blue-cheeked
variety which also has a yellow breast.
The Stanley Parrakeet (P. icterotis) is a native of South-West
Australia ; it is the smallest of its genus, and the only one in which the

cock and hen have very different colouring. In the cock the cheeks are
light yellow, the rest of the head, the neck, and all the under parts of
the body are bright red ; the back and rump are green ; the tail and
wings green and blue. The hen is distinguishable by her dull red head
and breast, speckled with green and yellow. Young birds resemble
their mother and gradually change their colouring like the other
Platycerci. By the middle of January their sex can easily be determined.
This species should have the same treatment as the Rosella ; it breeds
freely in an aviary, but is as spiteful as its larger relatives.
Parrakeets of the genus Barnardius may be distinguished from the
true Platycerci by certain structural details ; but to the ordinary
amateur they belong to the same class. They are, however, larger and
have thicker and shorter beaks ; they are usually green.
Barnard's Parrakeet (B . barnardi) from South and South-East
Australia is a beautiful bluish green, with a red forehead, head and
mantle tinged with dark grey ; a half-collar round the nape of the neck
and lower breast is yellow ; the wings and tail are variegated blue and
green. A variety exists which has no yellow on the breast. The sexes
are alike, though the hen is sometimes duller ; the only sure distinction
lies in the size of the head and beak. When the young leave the nest
they are less brightly coloured, and are greener and duller than the
adults. Barnard's bear a bad reputation in Australia for dying in
quantities on being captured, but those which reach us are usually strong
and hardy. They go to nest readily, either in an aviary or at liberty.
They should be treated like Rosellas.
Bauer's and Yellow-naped Parrakeets (B. zonarius and B.
semitorquatus), held by Gould to be two species, are only local races
of the same bird. It is true that there is a great difference in the size,
colouring, and even the voice of the large Yellow-nape, all green
with a red forehead, and the little Bauer with a yellow belly and black
forehead ; but between the two extremes is every possible gradation,
so much so that it is impossible to say where one begins or the other
ends. Yellow-napes inhabit the south-west and Bauer's the south and
interior of Australia.
Bauer's are green, with blue on tail and wings ; the belly yellow,
a half-collar of the same colour and a black head, shading into blue on

the cheeks. Yellow-napes are larger and have the under parts wholly
green and the forehead red. The sexes are alike, but the hens have
narrower beaks and smaller heads. Both Bauer's and Yellow-napes
are perfectly hardy. They should be treated like Bosellas. They are
terribly quarrelsome, and have a habit of biting off their adversaries'
beaks. Therefore, they must not be allowed their liberty where there
are other Parrakeets bold enough to join battle with them.
These Parrakeets can learn to whistle a tune, and even to speak a
few words in a hoarse voice, but none of the Platycerci nor Barnardii
talk really well, nor can they be made real pets, for as soon as they lose
their fear of man they usually grow vicious and aggressive and show
no real affection for their owner. The natural voice of Yellow-napes,
though too powerful for indoors, is agreeable in the open, and the wild
whistling calls of a male bird when flying are charming. None of the
Platycerci actually scream unless wounded or frightened, and as I
have already said, their voices are usually musical. A blue and white
colour variety of Bauer's Parrakeet has been met with.
The Red-capped Parrakeet (Porphyriocephalus spurius) occupies
an isolated position and differs from the genuine Platycerci in its shape,
its colour, and its manner of life. It is the same size as a Pennant,
with a long and pointed tail and a long, narrow, peculiarly shaped beak.
Its plumage is unique ; the top of its head is red, as are also the belly
and sub-caudals ; cheeks green, changing to yellow on the sides of the
neck ; the back is green ; wings and tail green and blue ; the breast
is a pretty shade of slaty purple.
This species is to be found in West Australia. Its range is restricted
and its numbers are rapidly decreasing, owing to cultivation and the
war waged on it by the owners of orchards. If it be not bred in con-
finement it will probably soon cease to exist. The sexes are easily
recognized, for the hen always has more or less green mixed with the red
on her head and her cheeks are much duller. Young birds have entirely
green heads, but attain adult plumage after their first moult.
The Red-capped Parrakeet is rare and is troublesome to manage in
confinement in this country ; if caught when adult, it is very wild and
never becomes really tame even after years of aviary life. Young birds
taken from the nest are, however, easily tamed. The species needs a

great deal of exercise ; if shut up in a cage it quickly becomes too fat
and dies of fits ; tame birds, which seem more greedy than timid ones,
should, when not breeding or moulting, be given only a teaspoonful of
plain seed a day with unlimited fruit and green food. This bird must be
carefully protected from chills, and although it may, once acclimatized,
winter out of doors, it should be shut up for the night. When newly
imported it requires a very high temperature and plenty of exercise.
At first it must not be placed in an unheated aviary, even in summer,
for the first cool night will kill it. The shelter of its aviary must always
be heated whenever the weather is chilly or damp and also at night.
It is a quarrelsome species, and as it is no more amiable towards its
own kind than towards other Parrakeets, it is imprudent to put several
couples together, even when travelling. In spite of its shyness, it is
not difficult to persuade it to nest; it has been bred in England. One
of my specimens lived for a long time at liberty.
A Red-capped Parrakeet's aviary must be very strongly built,
for although some individuals do not bite through ordinary wire netting,
others quickly make themselves a way of escape. Young birds are very
delicate, for which reason the nest-box must be hung in a very sheltered
position and the shelter well warmed.
The Blue Bonnet is the name given to two varieties at least ;
the one has a red belly (Northiella hcematogaster) and the other a yellow
one ( N . xanthorous). They are peculiar little Parrakeets, which were
formerly included among the Psephoti, but have now rightly been placed
in a separate genus, for they are no more Psephoti than Platycerci or
Barnardii. The yellow-vented Blue Bonnet which is the more frequently
imported, inhabits South Australia. It is mainly mouse-coloured, with
cheeks and part of the wings and tail sky blue and the wing-coverts
olive yellow ; the middle of the belly is red ; sides straw-coloured ;
the lower belly and sub-caudals are yellow. It is about the size of a
Cockatiel, and has a long tail.
The red-bellied variety, which is to be found in the south-east of the
continent, wears a chestnut red spot on the wings, and its sub-caudals
are red ; it is the more brightly coloured of the two. A new sub-species
has recently been discovered ( N . narethce) further north, which has no
red at all on the under parts. Many intermediate specimens are met

with ; the sexes are alike, but the hens are smaller and duller. The
young are very much the same as the adults, only slightly less brightly
coloured.
Blue Bonnets are very active and playful, they are not suitable for
a cage, but would make admirable aviary birds but for their
susceptibility to infectious diseases, especially two kinds of
septicaemia. They are very spiteful and can kill birds a good deal bigger
than themselves. Some aviary keepers have found them amiable with
small birds, but not all. Blue Bonnets should be fed like Rosellas ;
they can stand cold well, even w T hen first imported if they are in good
plumage, and they seldom require heat.
In consideration of their liability to disease, it is best to keep them
in movable aviaries. A cock whose hen is shut up stays well, and
notwithstanding his small size, escapes the attacks of his enemies
through his agility, caution, and his power of biting savagely. Pairs,
however, rarely succeed well at liberty, and are disposed to
wander away.

FOREIGN BIRDS AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE
BIRD SHOW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992049375" page_id="56773135"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
The annual cage-bird show at the Crystal Palace was held from
3rd to 5th February, and was said to beat all previous records so
far as numbers and value were concerned. The foreign bird section was
quite up to the average, and contained a most interesting collection of
birds. The Dulwich and Peckham Cage Bird Society and their energetic
Show Manager, Mr. A. W. Smith, are to be heartily congratulated on
the success of their enterprise.
Amongst the Lories was a splendid pair of Musky Lorikeets which
won a 1st prize for Mr. Maxwell, Mr. Frostick taking second with a good
pair of Yellow-backed Lories and Mr. Whitley third with a Black-cap.
The class for Lovebirds, Brotogerys, etc., contained no less than
twenty-two entries, and almost all were in show condition, and as
there were only four prizes many excellent birds had to go without
a card.
In the class for Conures (excepting Golden and Whitleys),
Mr. Whitley showed a fine Patagonian, a rare bird nowadays (first

prize), as well as a pair of Red-masked, while Mr. Frostick sent a good
Green and a pair of Golden-headed Conures and Mr. Holdstock a pair
of Jendayas. Two fine pairs of King Parrots were shown by Mr. Whitley
and Mr. Jackson (first and third), while Mr. Adams' Pennant came third
and a fine pair of Bauer's (Mr. Frostick) fourth.
The " All Other Species " class contained Whitley's Conure, of which
we recently had a coloured plate in our Magazine. It received the first
and a special prize. Mr. Whitley's beautiful Alexandra Parrakeet,
which took second prize, was a superb bird, while Lord Tavistock's
Norfolk Island Parrakeet, which obtained third prize, was a great
rarity. Mr. Frostick sent a fine pair of the Tasmanian Yellow-bellied
Parrakeets and Lord Tavistock a fine Yellow-rumped.
The class for Hybrids and abnormally coloured birds was, as usual,
a very interesting one. Lord Tavistock sent his exquisite Lutino Blue-
fronted Amazon. It is a wonderful bird, of a bright canary-yellow
with crimson markings. His hybrid Alexandra Crimson-wing is also a
beautiful and most interesting bird. Mr. Whitley's hybrid Glossy
Starling is a great curiosity, the male parent being a Burchell's Starling
and the female a Chestnut-winged Starling.
There were two Black Cockatoos, one sent by Mr. Whitley (first)
and the other by Lord Tavistock (second). Mr. Hawkins sent a Spix,
Macaw (third), in a cage that was too small for it.
In the class for " All other species of Parrots ", Mr. Whitley took
first prize with a pair of the very rare Yellow-headed Poeocephalus
(P. citreicapillus) from Abyssinia. Mr. Maxwell's Yellow-billed
Pionus , which took second prize, is also a rare species. Third came a
very good Hawk-head, and fourth a Brown-headed Parrot, of which
species there was a second example in the class. The class for Quails,
Doves, etc., contained but two entries, both belonging to Mr. Whitley,
a pair of Black-headed Caccabis and a Ground Dove, of which I do not
know the species.
The class for rare Grassfinches, Waxbills, etc., contained two pairs of
Peters' Spotted Firefinches, the first shown for many years, the
first prize going to those shown by Mr. and Mrs. T. R. Berry, and third
to those belonging to Mr. C. T. Maxwell. Mr. Timberlake took second
prize with a good Violet-eared Waxbill, of which species two others

were shown. There were also some good Rainbow Buntings, a Versicolor
Bunting, Gouldian, and others, but the rarest thing in the class, though
perhaps the least conspicuous, was a small Waxbill sent by Mr. Whitley.
It belonged to a species described as recently as October last and named
Estrilda xanthophrys by Mr. W. L. Sclater in the Bulletin of the British
Ornithologists' Club. It was therefore the rarest bird in the show, though
the judge may well be excused for not spotting it.
A very fine Mariqua Sunbird belonging to Mr. Maxwell very rightly
took first and special prize in the class for these birds, and the smaller
Tanagers and Sugar-birds. In the Glossy Starling class there were two
pairs of Royals, some Superbs, and a very good Purple-head.
The class for Crows, Jays, and Toucans was interesting. Mr. Fro stick
was lucky in securing first for a Red-bellied Toucan against
Mr. Maxwell's very rare and beautiful Green Toucanette, which was
awarded second prize. Mr. Whitley's pair of Pileated Jays were
beauties, and his very small Aracari was a rarity.
The " Any other small species " class contained some very good
birds. Mr. C. T. Maxwell sent a lovely Minivet which obtained first-
prize, a rare Indian Shrike, shown by Mr. Whitley, coming second and
a beautiful Rufous-bellied Niltava (Mr. C. S. Dunstan) third.
In the " Any other larger species " class Mr. Whitley took first
with a very beautiful pair of White-breasted Touracous, a species
that is a bad liver as a rule, though Mr. Whitley seems to have solved
the difficulty of keeping it in excellent condition. Why the second
prize should have gone to a Donaldson's, a common species nowadays
and easily kept, instead of to the very rare Green-necked Touracou,
which was also in the class and probably the first ever exhibited, is
not clear. D. S-S.

The popularity of the blue variety of the Budgerigar in Japan has
resulted in the most remarkable rise in value of these birds in Europe.
Their value is now about twelve times as much as it was two years ago
or less, and several breeders of these very attractive birds have made
small fortunes during the past year. And this rise in value is not
entirely confined to the blue and other coloured varieties of the

Budgerigar, the normally coloured birds being also affected, though to
a lesser degree. Their value may fluctuate, but at the time of writing
these are about four times their normal value.
There is a danger that the high prices offered for these birds may
result in valuable stock birds being sent out of the country, and this,
I fear, has taken place to a considerable extent, especially in the case
of the Cobalt birds.
The Turquoisine was comparatively common as a cage-bird in
Europe many years ago, and it might with care have been conserved
and multiplied instead of being allowed to die out as it did, while
unfortunately no trouble was taken to protect it in its limited habitat
in South-Eastern Australia. The youths of Sydney were in the habit
of proceeding to the country on Saturday afternoons in order to shoot
Parrakeets for " Parrot-pie ", much of the " bag " consisting of
Turquoisines !
Sheep farming was also a very potent factor in the diminution of this
species, for the grass seed which formed the food of these Parrakeets
was not allowed to form when the sheep came and ate the grass.
But the Turquoisine is not extinct, as was at one time feared, and
it is satisfactory to hear that our member, Mr. Simon Harvey, jun.,of
Adelaide, has reared a brood of Turquoisines in his aviary.
Mr. Blaauw has for many years kept a wonderful collection of
waterfowl at Gooilust, in Holland, and he has bred most of the rare
species of Geese and Ducks. One of his latest successes has been with
the Blue-winged Goose of Abyssinia (Cyanochen cyanoptera), a rare
species of which he published an account in our journal in July, 1925.
Mr. Blaauw has also bred the rare Slight-billed Parrakeet
(Henicognathus leptorhynchus), from Chili, from a pair he brought home
in 1911.
That the Californian Quail is not perfectly hardy may have been
discovered by some of our members. While dry cold does not seem to
affect it much, it cannot stand damp cold. Mr. Maurice Portal writes
to me : " I had three pairs which laid some eighty-five eggs in 1925.

I hatched sixty, and brought up the chicks in the Pheasant field. They
vanished in October. In 1926 I hatched thirty-seven. Ten were kept
in a movable pen in the field. The balance I let go as they liked. Seven
roosted by the keeper's house in a yew-tree, and about ten in some birch
scrub in the wood, and a few in an old Scotch fir. All were dead after
a thick white fog which froze about 1 a.m., and ended in 9 degrees of
hoar-frost. All were fat with full crop and gizzards full of grit. This
accounts for my friends telling me they migrated 1 " D. S-S.

Sir,-- I purchased a pair of Egyptian (presumably Common) Quails
the other day. Though I have kept Californian Quails for years on
ordinary seed and corn, I would be much obliged if you could let me
know something about the common species, which I have never had
before, though I have tried to get them for ages. (1) What is the sexual
difference ? (2) Correct feeding ? (3) Are they likely to breed in an
outdoor " Parrakeet " Aviary, with only a sandy ground, and about
12 feet by 8 feet ? (4) Anything further you can tell me.

[(1) When adult the sexes of the Common Quail may be distinguished
by the two dark brown bands which descend from the ear-coverts and
terminate in a blackish patch on the throat of the male. The female is
slightly the larger bird.
(2) Canary and millet seed or almost any small grain and green
food. They also readily devour insects.
(3) To breed Quails successfully a fairly large outdoor aviary in

which grass is allowed to grow long is essential. Although they may lay
eggs, they will never incubate them unless the nest is in a very secluded
spot, such as beneath a tuft of long grass, approached by a tunnel
through the grass.
(4) The young are not difficult to rear providing plenty of live ants'
cocoons can be obtained, but they are not likely to thrive on purely
artificial food.
The Common Quail is the wildest and least attractive of any of the
genus Coturnix .-- Ed.]

The Thick-billed Parrot is the monotype of the genus Rhynchopsitta
and is placed between the genera Ara and Conuropsis in Ridgeway's
classification of American Psittacidae. It is a medium-sized parrot
about the size of the Yellow-headed Amazon and is slightly reminiscent
of the Military Macaw in appearance. It's bill is large and heavy
and black in colour. The habitat of this fine Parrot is in the pine belt
of the mountains of northern and middle Mexico and it occasionally
wanders northward into Southern Arizona.
Mr. Lee S. Crandall, curator of birds in the New York Zoological
Park, says he knows of no record of its ever having been kept in captivity
and diligent search on my part fails to reveal this fact.
In colour it is a deep green with none of the dusky colour edging
to the feathers. The cheeks are brighter green and the under parts
lighter green and slightly duller. The forehead and a broad stripe,
over each eye is deep carmine and the bend of the wing and lower part
of thigh is bright geranium red. The under surface of wing and tail
is slate colour and the under primary coverts are clear yellow. The
body feathers have a highly polished effect.

G. H. Gurney--The Chestnut-headed Buarremon
Our bird, which we call " Mickey ", is very tame and affectionate,
especially with our young son, but it does not seem to take to the ladies.
It delights in snuggling around one's neck and rubbing its cheek against
one's ear. It has a decidedly unpleasant voice which, if my memory
serves me right, is similar to that of the Rose-breasted Cockatoo.

I have lately received a pair of these birds, which I believe are new
to Aviculture. The genus Buarremon is composed of a group of Tana-
grine Finches, closely allied to the Saltators and to the Magpie Tanagers
(Cissopsis). They range over the whole of Central America, from
Mexico fco Peru, and are especially common in the Andean area. My
birds, which arrived in fairly good condition, have now settled down
well, they are at present in a large flight cage, but no doubt later on
they will be put into an aviary. They are rather larger than a Scarlet
Tanager, but much more sturdily built, the wings are short, and very
square looking in flight, and the bill is considerably longer and more
elongated than in the majority of the Tanagridse. There is a slight
difference in colour between the two birds, one being somewhat lighter
than the other, and the black spots on the front of the head are not
so pronounced, this is presumably the hen. Above and on the lower
parts of the breast they are a dull yellowish green colour, wings and
tail brown, the crown of the head is a rich chestnut red, sides of the
head and forehead jet black, with three white longish spots, the throat
down to the pectoral collar is snowy white, the collar black, upper
parts of the breast grey ; this description of their colouring will show
that they are very showy birds, the black and white of the throat
and head and the rich red brown top making them very conspicuous.
My pair are very tame, and extremely active and inquisitive, always
on the move, jerking their heads continually and flicking their rather
short tails in quite a Shrike-like way ; they are so square looking
and thickset, that they remind one almost of a Dipper, and as the;y

Mr. Chapman has lately received a fair quantity of these from
Mexico. It is also known as the Grey Solitaire, and has been exhibited
before at the Zoo, while an allied species, Townsend's Solitaire
(M. townsendi), was described by the late Mr. Astley, and well illustrated
in this journal in 1919 (New Series, Vol. VII, p. 319). According
to Dr. Hopkinson's book, it was bred in Moscow in 1912.
It is about the size of a Scarlet Tanager, of dark slaty blue, with a
ring of white feathers round the eye.
It sings very attractively and continuously. Two or three in a room
remind me of a chime of little silver bells, or of those Japanese glass
chimes which clash and tinkle in the breeze. (I am also bound to admit
that one of my birdy friends described the song as like the scraping of
a wheelbarrow wheel in need of oiling !)
The Clarino seems to be largely frugivorous, mine preferring soaked
currants and chopped apple to anything else.
The hens sing also, and have a " feminine look " and a narrower
head than the cocks, and care should be taken to see they get their
fair share of food when the sexes are put together as the cocks are very
spiteful towards them.

AUSTRALIAN PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995287703703704" page_id="56773157"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
By the Marquess of Tavistock and J. Delacour
(Concluded jrom p. 84)
The genus Psephotus is a well-defined group of small Parrakeets
whose chief characteristic is the striking difference in plumage between
the sexes ; the hens are nearly as plainly clad as hen Pheasants are
when compared with cocks. Their wings and tails are long but their
beaks and feet are small.
The Psephoti have very weak and musical voices which could
not annoy the most sensitive ear, and are besides graceful and pretty.
They are, however, very quarrelsome. They succeed very well in
aviaries but should never be confined in cages for any length of time.
To keep any Psephotus permanently in a parrot cage is exceedingly
cruel.
The Red-rumped Parrakeet (Psephotus hcematonotus) is the
commonest of the group ; it is very hardy and easy to breed when
acclimatized. The male bird is a fine green tinged with blue on the
head and wings, with a greyish mantle ; his belly is yellow passing
into white on the sub-caudals and the rump is red, the outer retrices
are blue and white. The female is greyish green. Young males can
be told by their greener hue and by a little red on the back. The
length of this species is about 15 inches. Red-rumps should have
the same treatment as Rosellas ; they do not care for fruit but eat
green food freely.
They are charming at liberty and stay well, breed readily, do no
harm to fruit and never go down chimneys ; they look particularly
fascinating running about on a closely-cut lawn. Unfortunately
they can only be kept safely where there are no Tawny Owls. If

a Red-rump loses his mate he will disappear after a few days if another
is not provided at once. On letting out a pair the same precautions
should be taken as advised for the Platycerci. Red-rumps are natives
of South and South-East Australia.
The Manycoloured Parrakeet (P. multicolor) inhabits the
South and interior of Australia ; it is the same size as the Red-rump
and the male is really magnificent. His colour is satiny green shading
into blue, with a yellow forehead. The nape is sometimes brick
red, the wings are blue and green with a yellow mark on the shoulders,
the belly is red, wings blue and green bearing a yellow spot on the
shoulders ; the tail is blue and white, green at the base ; there is a
red spot on the rump and the belly is red, the sub-caudals yellow.
The female is grey green with nape, rump and shoulders spotted
with brick red ; wings and tail tinged with blue. They fly very
gracefully.
They should be fed like the previously mentioned species, omitting
hemp and sunflower. They are nearly as ready to go to nest in confine-
ment but not so easily kept in good health. They can be kept out
of doors when acclimatized, but when first imported must be kept warm.
Manycolours must be shut up at night when kept in an aviary. Their
chief trouble is their habit of contracting contagious diseases, especially
septicaemia. But as the germs of this illness are local, one amateur
may succeed very well with this species while another cannot save them.
Movable aviaries are very desirable for them, indeed almost essential.
Manycolours may be let fly like Red-rumps, but are more inclined
to stray and it is necessary to take more precautions.
The Hooded Parrakeet (P. dissimilis) is one of the prettiest
Parrakeets in the world, and when flying, looks like a huge butterfly.
The male has a black top to his head, his cheeks, throat, breast, belly,
and rump are turquoise blue ; his back and mantle are greyish brown,
tail and wings deep blue green; the small wing-coverts are golden
yellow and the sub-caudal feathers orange-red. The female has
a greenish grey head ; back, wings and breast pale green ; the belly
is blue, sub-caudals orange-red, tail green and blue. The female
is a light brownish olive, washed with pale blue on the cheeks, breast,
and under parts. This species is a native of North Australia.

The Hooded Parrakeet should have the same food as the preceding
species. As it comes from the tropics, it needs to be very carefully
acclimatized, and on first arrival it requires a high temperature;
later it should be shut up for the night and in bad weather healthy
specimens may be kept outside throughout the year. Unfortunately
the Hooded Parrakeet often retains the habit of moulting and breeding
according to Australian seasons and to cure this it should be treated
like Brown's Parrakeet. In its native land it breeds in the nests
of the termite and consequently some hens are difficult to please and
will not make use of the ordinary nesting logs, and must be tempted
with other shapes.
Where there are no Owls these Parrakeets can be given their liberty
and a pair of them will charm their owner more under those conditions
than a whole aviary full of other birds. When they have settled down
they never stray, but a good deal of care must be exercised in liberating
them. Young cocks are like the hens except that their cheeks are
a little bluer ; the black and yellow colouring appears after the first
moult.
A dealer will occasionally offer a young bird, apparently in good
health, but minus flight and tail feathers. On no account should it
be bought, for not only do the missing feathers never grow, but in time
the bird loses even the feathers which it has. The Hooded Parrakeet
has always been a rare species in Europe.
Golden-shouldered Parrakeet (P. chrysopterygius) is found
farther south in the interior of Australia ; it is much like the above,
but can be distinguished by its smaller hood and by a yellow band
on the forehead. The hen also shows traces of this band. It is even
more rarely imported than the Hooded.
The Paradise Parrakeet (P. pulcherrima) from East Australia is
a delightful bird which was believed to be extinct but which has recently
been rediscovered in small numbers. The male has a red forehead
and a black crown ; his back and wings are deep grey-brown with
red shoulders ; the sides of his head and neck, the throat and breast
are green ; his eyes are encircled with yellow ; his flanks, rump, and
tail-coverts are turquoise blue tinged with green ; his belly and sub-
caudals are rosy red ; tail deep green and light blue. The female is

distinguished by the sides of her head and neck, and her breast being
fawn or beige ; her belly is pale blue with red spots.
There is now very little chance of this species being imported,
although it is said that one or two have reached America. Former
amateurs who had them found them not particularly susceptible
to cold and quite easy to breed, but that they seem to have been liable
to contagious diseases like Manycolours and would appear to require
the same treatment.
Bourke's Parrakeet (Neopsephotus bourkei) from South Australia
superficially resembles the genus Neophema but in reality it is very
distinct and has no very close affinities. It has none of those faults
which make some people dislike Parrakeets. Its plumage is not gaudy
but softly shaded, rosy grey on the head, neck, and breast, grey edged
with green on the mantle and wings, the folds of which are light blue ;
the belly is pink, the under tail-coverts sky blue, the tail blue and dark
grey. It has a melodious voice, does not bite when handled and does
not destroy shrubs. The sexes are alike in colour but the difference
in the size of the head is sufficiently pronounced to enable them to
be distinguished.
Bourke's Parrakeets inhabit desert country and never bathe in
confinement nor eat green stuff ; they feed exclusively on millet and
canary seed. There is no harm in offering them groundsel or flowering
grass but they seldom touch it. Sometimes they like a turf of grass,
especially when it begins to wither. Once acclimatized they stand
cold fairly well if protected from wind and damp. They go to nest
readily but must only be allowed to breed during the warm months.
Breeding pairs should be kept by themselves as the cocks may kill
each other or if they do not go as far as that, the weaker will be
badly plucked. The bottom of their log must be quite near the
entrance hole, for this species, unlike most other Parrakeets, is not a
climber.
Bourke's Parrakeets are susceptible to disease, particularly tuber-
culosis, and need a clean sunny aviary. Their worst fault is their
inveterate habit of banging themselves against the roof and sides of
their aviary in flight if they are frightened, or, in the case of the young
birds, when they leave the nest. It is absolutely necessary to have

an inner lining of string netting and to see that it is always perfectly
tant. I have found this species inoffensive with other birds.
The Grass Parrakeets (Neophema) include some of the most
interesting small Australian Parrakeets. They are, generally speaking,
harmless to other birds, do not bite, and their voices are not disagree-
able ; they are extremely pretty and breed quite readily in an aviary.
Unfortunately they are excessively rare and competent observers
assert that they are on the way to complete extinction ; but for all
that it has for years been believed that certain species had entirely
disappeared, and yet they have come to light again either in little
scattered flocks or isolated pairs.
The Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet (N . venusta) is found in
Tasmania and specimens still occasionally arrive in Europe and America.
Its colouring is olive green, yellower on the cheeks and belly, which
last is sometimes tinged with orange ; a narrow band across the fore-
head ; the wings and part of the tail are very bright blue. The feet
and beak are small and delicate. Its length is about 10 inches. The
blue band across the forehead is duller and less marked on the hen,
and she has also greenish feathers in the blue patch on her wings.
Young birds have less blue than adults, but assume their full plumage
long before they are a year old. Adults are quarrelsome ; the hens
being more pugnacious and stronger than the cocks and a watch must
be kept lest a hen take a dislike to a new mate, for she may injure him
severely. Bluewings require heat when they first come over, but once
acclimatized they will live out of doors if they are shut up at night
and during cold weather.
These Parrakeets are liable to septicaemia and it is advisable to
house them in movable aviaries. Like Bourke's they have the annoying
habit of hitting themselves against the wire and require an inner lining
of string netting to keep them from biting the roof mesh. A smooth plank
on which they cannot hang should be fixed just underneath ; they do
not gnaw hanging head downwards as they are not good at climbing.
Bluewings are rather liable to sunstroke in great heat for they
are apt to expose themselves most rashly. A few leafy branches
should be laid on the roof of their aviary so as to intercept the direct
rays, but in winter they need all the sun they can get. Like other

members of the group they are subject, when first imported, to the
same disease of the eyes which causes losses among Barrabands ;
with Grass Parrakeets it is always fatal.
Grass Parrakeets eat millet and canary seed with a little hemp and
plenty of groundsel and flowering grass. They usually lay four eggs
but unless they are kept in a spacious movable aviary, male birds
bred in captivity are mostly infertile. As already mentioned when
dealing with Bourke's Parrakeet, the entrance hole should be near
the bottom of their nesting log.
The Elegant Parrakeet ( N . elegans) from South-West
Australia is much like the foregoing but the blue strip on its wings is
much narrower and of two shades, and the green more golden. It is
now very rare but in former times it was well known and has been
bred in aviaries. Old males may have an orange patch on the
abdomen like Bluewings and Orange Bellies.
The Orange-bellied Parrakeet (N. chrysogaster) is a native of
Tasmania and South and South-East Australia. It is like the
Bluewing but is greener and the blue area on the forehead is wider, more
indefinite, and less brilliant in colour. The species is almost unknown
in aviaries, and is probably on the verge of extinction.
The Rock Grass Parrakeet ( N . petrophila) is much like Venusta
but is duller and more olive and has less blue in its wing. It is the
dullest-coloured member of the group. This species inhabits certain
coastal districts in South-West Australia and nests in holes under large
stones. It is being exterminated by cats and rats, and is now very
scarce. I had two males in my possession for several years ; they were
sensitive to the cold and could not be wintered out of doors. One
of them paired with a hen Venusta, but the eggs were clear. It has
been bred in Germany.
The Turquoisine ( N . pulchella) is a native of South and South-
East Australia. It is a tragedy that this lovely little bird was not
preserved in Europe, for it bred freely and might have been domesticated
like the Budgerigar. For years it was believed to be extinct but latterly
a few specimens have been discovered and two or three have reached
Europe and the United States. The male bird is olive green above
with blue forehead, cheeks, and wings, a red patch on the shoulders,

and all the under parts and the tail yellow. The female has no red
on the shoulders and only a trace of blue on the cheeks. Young birds
have even less blue than their mother but attain their full plumage
when a few months old.
These Parrakeets should be fed on millet and canary seed with
flowering grass and groundsel. They have the same habits and diseases
as Bluewings. Turquoisines in former days were commonly in the
market.
The Splendid Parrakeet (N. splendida) is more beautiful
even than the Turquoisine Parrakeet; it was a native of South-
West Australia and has always been very rare. It is, however, reported
to have bred in the Zoological Gardens of London. Its back, mantle,
and tail are green, the latter being yellow underneath and at the sides.
Its head is brilliant cobalt blue ; its breast bright red ; its wings a
mixture of light and dark blue; its abdomen golden yellow. The hen
has no red breast. This species which was thought to be extinct
has lately reappeared. It is said that two specimens were caught
and eaten by a farmer whose granary they had entered during a
drought! Owing to the destruction of its refuges in times of drought
and the increasing colonization of the country, there is no hope that
the bird will maintain itself permanently even in the deserts of the
interior.
The Cyanoramphus Parrakeets come from New Zealand and
Oceania and are about the size of a Rosella. They are usually green
but their heads are adorned with red or yellow and their wings tinged
with blue.
The New Zealand Red-fronted Parrakeet (C. novce-zelandice)
was formerly very frequently met with in aviaries, but owing to its
scarcity in its native country and to the strict protection afforded
it, it is now hardly ever seen here. It is a fine grass green, has its
flights marked with blue and all the crown of the head bright red as
well as the lores and a small patch on the flanks. The sexes are alike,
but the hen's beak and head are smaller and weaker.
This species has often been bred and used to be considered hardy
and prolific. I once had two males and one female but one cock injured
the hen and the other killed her, so the species is not always as gentle

as some writers declare. It does as well in a cage as in an aviary and
learns to speak. Its food should consist of two parts of canary to
one of hemp and one of oats, together with apple and green food.
The Norfolk Island Parrakeet ( C . coolci) strongly resembles
the Red-fronted but it is much larger and it has a stronger beak. It
is now almost extinct, having been exterminated by rats. They
appear to be gentle but are apt to feel the cold : they should not be
allowed much hemp or sunflower seed.
The Yellow-fronted New Zealand Parrakeet (C . auriceps)
is even rarer than the above. It differs in not having red cheeks,
but a wide yellow band on the top of its head while its forehead is
red, and there is a red patch on the rump. It was freely imported
in former times and was scarcely less prolific than the Red-fronted ;
it was bred several times in France, especially by Delacour.
Besides these species the following have been imported : C. saisseti
from New Caledonia, C. unicolor from the Antipodean Islands,
and C. erythronotus from the Society Islands. The first may be dis-
tinguished from the Red-fronted by its larger size, and yellow cheeks
and throat; the second is all green ; the third has a black forehead
and the lores ; a spot on the ear-coverts and the rump are reddish
brown ; its body is olive green freely marked with blue on the wings
and tail.
The two species belonging to the genus Nymphicus differ from the
Cyanoramphus by their pointed crests. They are pretty, interesting,
and inoffensive. They have been bred in confinement but very seldom,
as they are usually most difficult to keep alive. Occasionally one
may come across an individual who lives many years without special
care; but for one like this a dozen and more will die off most
vexatiously.
The Uvean Parrakeet (N. uvceensis) from the Loyalty Islands
is grass green, yellowish underneath and on the rump ; it has a crest
composed of six curved dark green feathers, becoming paler towards
the extremities ; the feathers on the forehead are dark green with
red tips ; wings and tail partly blue ; the face, cheeks, and chin are
dark green. I believe the sexes to be alike, unless there is some
difference in the size of the head and beak.

Those which I had did not live long ; some which were in my
aviaries died of anaemia and softening of the bones ; while others,,
living in cages, succumbed to aspergillosis. It would seem that the
best method of keeping them in good health is by giving them very
nourishing and varied food ; hemp, canary, millet, oats, sunflower,
monkey nuts, fruit, green food, and mealworms. This Parrakeet has
a peculiar but not disagreeable voice ; it is active and interesting
and becomes perfectly tame.
The Horned Parrakeet (N. cornutus) from New Caledonia
is even larger and handsomer. Its chief difference lies in its head and
crest. This last is composed of two long narrow feathers which point
backwards and are black with red tips. The top of the head is red,
black at the base of the feathers ; the nape and flanks are yellow ;
face and cheeks black ; the remainder is grass green tinged with yellow
on the rump and with blue on the wings and tail.
It is rarer than the Uvean and has not been imported for a long
while. It was bred several times in France by Cornily, who also reared
the Uvean Parrakeeet and hybrids between the two ; but breeding
them at all must have been due to a lucky chance combined with
uncommon skill.
The Swift Parrakeet (Nanodes discolor ), very widely distributed
throughout South-East Australia and Tasmania, is an attractive
and very distinct little species. It is the same size as the Grass
Parrakeets ; it has a yellowish beak and feet and golden yellow eye ;
the forehead and throat are red, the latter surrounded by a yellow
line ; the crown of the head is bluish and all the rest brilliant
green above, paler beneath, save for the wings and tail, which have
blue and red markings.
This Parrakeet is interesting in many ways but hard to keep alive
in confinement and may die off without reason in spite of every care.
Although it feeds in the same fashion as the Lories, and is, like them,
active in climbing, it really has very little in common with that family
in its habits and character, but reminds one rather in some ways of
the Barraband. The sexes are alike and very difficult to distinguish ;
but the cocks are brighter and have a yellower iris. Swift Parrakeets
are gentle and do not quarrel among themselves even when breeding.

Their diet should consist of bananas and sponge cake in equal parts,,
crushed and mixed together ; soaked canary seed, fruit and all sorts
of green stuff ; a few mealworms may also be added. They bear cold
fairly well but should have some meat in the severest weather. A
form of enteritis, due neither to chill nor to irritants in the food, is
their most serious disease and they may contract it suddenly when in
perfect condition. We do not know how to prevent nor cure
this complaint. Formerly this species was bred in France in large
quantities especially by Rousse ; he kept several pairs together in
outside aviaries provided with good shelters ; he fed them on seed*
fruit, and bread and milk. In their wild state they, like the Lories,,
feed chiefly on nectar from the flowers of the Eucalyptus.
The Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) is too well known,
to require description. It is a native of Australia, where it is migratory,,
as are also many of the preceding species. The sexes are alike but
the cere (the skin covering the base of the beak) is blue in the male-
and cream or brown in breeding hens ; bluish white when the female is.
breeding. The young have their foreheads streaked with black*
while those of the adults are pure yellow. The wild type is green with
a yellow head, the face marked with deep violet blue, and the wings,
and tail partly blue ; the mantle, crown, and sides of the head are barred
and streaked with dark grey. In confinement many different colour
varieties have been bred, some very beautiful. The most striking
are light blue, deep blue, mauve, grey, yellow, .olive, and white. When
Budgerigars are kept in flocks they breed very freely. It may chance
that a hen here and there may turn vicious and kill her neighbours,
but this is quite exceptional. Odd hens, however, should be removed
as they disturb nests, but surplus cocks are seldom a nuisance.
Some amateurs allow Budgerigars to breed all the year round, but
it is wiser to rest them during the cold months either by separation
of the sexes or simply by taking away the nest-boxes. Some strains,
are very hardy, but others having been kept and bred indoors for
generations have become tender and are as subject to chills as
Waxbills.
Budgerigars are not to be recommended as companions for small
birds, and they destroy shrubs in an aviary. The Budgerigar is

&amp; delightful species at liberty and well worth the trouble it may give
in establishing it.
It is necessary to procure several strong, healthy pairs which
have been bred in an outside aviary and to keep them shut up for
several months on the spot where it is intended to release them. They
can then be let out a few at a time, with food at hand and nest-boxes
in the trees. It is wise to catch up young birds directly they can
feed themselves ; otherwise they stray. They should be fed at first
on soaked canary seed and kept in a sheltered aviary. In the middle
of September all old cocks should be caught up and placed in aviaries.
When it is certain that no young remain in the nests the hens can also
be caught. They are easily taken if they have been accustomed
to be fed in trap cages which can be closed by pulling a string. It is
not safe to let Budgerigars winter at liberty on account of owls.
Budgerigars do no harm to the garden and never touch either buds
or fruit. The species is completely domesticated in Europe, and
breeding it has become a considerable business, particularly in France,
where tens of thousands are raised every year. They are fed on canary
and millet with all kinds of green stuff and a little soft insectivorous
food with bread and milk when they are nesting. Old wall mortar
is indespensable for them. In southern parts, Toulon in particular,
where they are chiefly bred, they are given Thuya boughs and lettuce
leaves.
Before leaving the Parrakeets we must mention those strange
Australian birds distantly related to the Platycercinse which are
remarkable for their terrestial habits, and live on the ground, where
they run with great rapidity on their long legs. They fly rapidly but
never perch.
The Ground Parrakeet (Pezojporus terrestris) is found in South
and West Australia and Tasmania. It is 12 inches long with a well-
developed tail, and it has a very short beak. Its plumage is green
watered with black and tinged with yellow on the abdomen and tail;
its forehead is orange red. The sexes are alike. It is becoming more
and more rare and is hardly ever imported. It is active by day and
nests in tufts of grass and herbage.
The Night Parrakeet (Geopsittacus occidentalis) may be known

A HYBRID CARDINAL
By Walter Barnett

<bodyText confidence="0.996706692307692" page_id="56773168"  page_num="105" year="" vol="">
In the spring of 1922 I bought a pair of Green Cardinals and turned
them out into the aviary in May. The cock bird, apparently quite
healthy, I found dead one morning about three weeks later. Here,
I may say that the aviary is built against a wall facing south-west.
It is open to all weathers, winter and summer, except that one end is
roofed in with glass to keep the food dry in wet weather. Prior to
the arrival of the Green Cardinals I had a Virginian Cardinal (male),
but it was not until the summer of 1925 that the Green Cardinal hen
showed signs of nesting. In that year, at the end of June she built
a nest of sticks and grass, rather an untidy structure, inside a wire
basket hanging from the roof under the end that was covered in with
glass. She laid four eggs, blue spotted with dark brown, and began to
sit. At the time, there was a spell of very hot weather, and she was
in full sun directly under the glass, I put a bit of canvas shading over
the glass to give her some protection. My attention, however, was
not appreciated, for she at once deserted her nest. I had no idea
at that time who her mate was, or whether the eggs were fertile. On
breaking one of them I discovered that they were.
She was not many days before she got busy again, carrying up
bits of fresh grass to the old nest, and then laid three more eggs. This
time, something took the eggs, and I have never to this day discovered
who was the culprit. I rather suspected a pair of Spreo Starlings
(wrongly as it proved later) for I had seen one of them take a Zebra
Finch's egg out of a nest-box.
Nothing daunted, the Green Cardinal laid a third time. So I
caught up the Spreos and caged them inside the aviary. However,

the eggs again disappeared, so the Spreos were once more set free.
So each attempt at nesting that year ended in disaster.
Last summer, however, she built again in the same basket, laid
four eggs and again they were taken. There was not even a trace of
broken shells. Soon after I saw her again carrying bits of grass,
so I took the basket away, in the hope that she would shift elsewhere.
She then built a nest in a small fir-tree, laid three eggs, and this time
was not molested and hatched them in July. There was no doubt
during incubation as to her mate, for whenever any mealworms were
thrown in, the Red Cardinal at once took them up to her and fed her
while she was sitting. As soon as the young hatched he at once went
on to the nest when she came off to feed and both parents fed the young
ones in turn. One young bird died in the nest, another I found
dead below on the ground. The third became fully fledged, almost
ready to leave the nest, when there was a violent thunderstorm. The
nest got drenched and next morning the last remaining young one was
dead. This was at the end of July.
Early in August, she began building again in the basket which I
had replaced, so I moved it at once into a small wooden shelter inside
the aviary, a much more secluded spot with a roof over her head
in case of storms. My hope that she might follow her partly-built
nest to its new locality was fulfilled. She finished the nest, laid two
eggs at some days interval, and duly hatched one. The other egg
came to nothing. Both parents again fed the young one. There
was the usual soft food available and I gave them a liberal supply
of fresh ants' eggs and gentles, but was sparing with mealworms.
In due course the young one left the nest. The first morning I found
it out on the ground I had rather an anxious moment. Both the Spreos
were standing over it and I was much afraid that they were going to
kill it. My fears, however, were quite unwarranted, for I soon
discovered that the Spreos were feeding it even more assiduously
than its own parents. The Spreos, usually gluttons for mealworms,
flew down to the young bird, holding the mealworms in their beaks,
at the same time giving vent to a loud twittering song. As soon as
the young one opened its mouth, the mealworms was popped down
its throat. It continued to thrive, and until it could fly I caught it

up at dusk and put it in the nest. It then stayed there, or on a
branch near by under shelter for the night.
In colour now it is rather a rich olive brown without any distinctive
marking, except for the black round the base of the beak, which rather
resembles the male parent. The crest is large and erect, but identical
in colour with the rest of its plumage. It is quite tame and very
quick and sprightly in its movements. I imagine now that it is six
months old that it has attained its full plumage.

A TALE OF A BARNARD'S PARRAKEET
By the Marquess of Tavistock
I have, this winter, added one more to the list of the Barnard's
Parrakeets of my acquaintance who have possessed abnormal tempera-
ments. There was one that despised matrimony and devoted himself
to the unpleasant hobby of biting human noses ; another whose devotion
to his mate always turned to furious resentment if she left his company
for a few days, even against her will; a third who hated all Broadtails
irrespective of sex and loved all other Parrakeets, likewise irrespective
of sex. The Perfect Gentleman came to me last summer, but at
first I did not realize he was in any way unusual. For several years
I have had two hen Barnards for whom I have vainly tried to obtain
mates. Barnard after Barnard has been sent on approval, only to
turn out to be another female ; if the new one did happen to be a
male it was some wretched little aviary-bred degenerate of no possible
use and whenever I got on the track of a really good cock, someone else
had always snapped him up before me. Meanwhile the ladies, deprived
of the wholesome influence and discipline of the opposite sex, became
more and more uppish and unfeminine in their demeanour, a circum-
stance which I foresaw would not add to their charms in the eyes of
the husbands I hoped to provide for them, for if there is one thing
a cock Broadtail cannot stand it is a minx. Last spring I at length
secured a good imported cock and paired him to one of the hens, and

<bodyText confidence="0.999160972222222" page_id="56773171"  page_num="108" year="" vol="">
later in the year I got hold of a second cock, who is the Perfect Gentle-
man, as a mate for the green-breasted hen whose portrait is to appear
in the Magazine at a later date. In buying the Perfect Gentleman
from a fellow member I heartlessly arranged to have him separated
from the wife with whom he had lived happily for some time--a dirty
trick for which my conscience has reproached me since I have come
to realize the sterling merits of his character. Many cock Barnards
on being parted from their lawful spouses and introduced to a strange
female of unattractive habits would have murdered her without loss
of time, but that was not the way of the Perfect Gentleman. Although
he did not pretend to be greatly impressed with his new companion,
he evidently came to the conclusion that there was some excuse
for the poor thing and he lived with her on terms of kindly tolerance.
Early in the winter I made arrangements for giving both cock Barnards
their liberty. The feeding and management of my Parrakeets at
liberty is complicated by the fact that one set have to be shut up every
night to protect them from Owls and consequently must know of no
feeding places except those inside an aviary, while the other set, which
is composed of birds too powerful to need protection, or too spiteful
to be confined together at night, have to be trained to feed in places
where the seed is not visible to those that have not been taught where
to look for it. Most of the Parrakeets that roost at liberty are fed
inside specially constructed boxes and the second cock Barnard was
educated to the use of the box, but I trained the Perfect Gentleman,
who was the first to be released, to enter the shelter of a small aviary
up the garden, the top of the flight of which is always open. Soon
after being set free the Perfect Gentleman paid a civil visit to his
former companion, but instead of being pleased, the ill-natured hussy
flew at him and tried to attack him through the wire. He was not
at all afraid of her, but his feelings were naturally hurt. From that
day on he has never settled on the top of her aviary ; it is undignified
to engage in a brawl with a female ; if she is rude to you, it is best
to avoid her. The hen has long ago repented and calls seductively
to him, but although he often looks at her from a distance he will not
come within 30 yards of her home. When the time came for the
release of the second cock I was a little anxious lest there should be

a bad fight between the two males, for all normal Broadtails love
a row when they are in perfect health and spirits. A few hours after
the second bird's release I noticed a cock Barnard in the small aviary
up the garden already referred to. He was looking inside the little
door of the shelter where the Perfect Gentleman's food was kept.
On getting near I was surprised to see that it was not the Perfect
Gentleman but the second cock and still more surprised to discover
the Perfect Gentleman himself inside the shelter, feeding amicably
within a foot or two of the other. Instead, therefore, of flying at him
the moment he set eyes on him as any ordinary cock Barnard would
have done on meeting a strange male on his ground, he had civilly
conducted the newcomer round the garden and asked him in to lunch !
In the afternoon the Perfect Gentleman showed his companion round
the aviary field, called on the second cock's wife, refused to be embroiled
in the fight which that lady tried hard to precipitate, wished the couple
good day and flew off to his tea. Some time later, it is true, there
was a temporary break in the amicable relations between the two
cocks, but the Perfect Gentleman was in no way to blame. He had
simply flown into a tree near the second cock and the latter was rude
enough to make an unprovoked attack upon him. In the melee which
ensued the Perfect Gentleman proved himself by no means lacking in
courage and came off victorious, but he bore no ill-will, for on subsequent
meetings with the second cock he was as good-natured as ever, clearly
having decided to let bygones be bygones. It might be imagined that
the Perfect Gentleman's good humour was simply due to the fact
that he was not in breeding condition, but nothing could be further
from the case. I have never seen a more active and virile bird. All
day long he was whistling and tail-waggling and examining holes
which might do for a nest. And yet never once have I seen him
attack another Parrakeet. Barrabands, Ringnecks, Kings may settle
close to him, but however excited he may be there is no attempt to
drive them off. On Christmas Day a tame cock Hooded Parrakeet
escaped from his aviary and flew up the garden. When I went to look
for him I found that the Perfect Gentleman had taken him under
his care. He looked on while I coaxed the Hooded into a cage, followed
us back to the bird-room, came close to the cage when I put it down at

the bird-room door, expressed the hope that the Hooded was not tired
by his excursion, wished him goodnight and flew away.
Not the least striking feature of the Perfect Gentleman's conduct
is his delicacy in never forcing himself unduly upon any of his neigh-
bours. He can be sociable without ever being a bore. A predecessor
referred to at the beginning of this article, aroused one's astonishment
by the large-heartedness he displayed to all distant connexions,
but his best friend could not have denied that he was ill-mannered
and eccentric. He may have meant well, but it was not really nice
of him to pester the old Masked Parrakeet with offers of half-digested
food, when it was obvious that " Georgie " feared and disliked the
entire feathered race and only cared for the company of human beings
and rats ; nor, if he had had any tact, would he have forced his society
on a Barraband at the precise moment when the latter was wooing
the lady of his choice ; nor if he had had any sense of humour, would
he have finally laid his heart at the feet of an enormous and elderly
Amazon Parrot more than three times his size.
Another remarkable fact about the Perfect Gentleman is that
he never uses bad language. Every other robust male Broadtail
I have come across has only to hear or see a rival, to start a rapid
clicking noise with his beak, low, malevolent, and most expressive.
The Perfect Gentleman, living, as he does, in charity with all birds,
is blameless in thought and consequently in speech. . . . The short
winter day is closing in and the birds rouse themselves to that last
period of activity which precedes bedtime. A Ringneck, tilting slightly
from side to side, crosses the aviary field in swift, direct flight, his
appearance evoking a chorus of excited cries from his companions
below. Kings pass backwards and forwards with restless grace. The two
hen Barnards break out into loud, sweet whistling in which the Perfect
Gentleman joins. There is a pause and very far away there comes
the whistle of a fourth Barnard. The chorus is renewed and a few
seconds later the second cock swings into a tree above the aviaries.
The Perfect Gentleman flies to the same tree and settles a few yards
from the newcomer. He bows to him three times and addresses him
in gentle chuckling tones. " I hope, sir," you can hear him say,
" that you have spent an agreeable day ? Well, it is getting late,

so I will wisli you goodnight/' He leaves the tree and goes dipping
across the garden to his roost. A few moments later the second
cock has taken a rather different line to his own chosen sleeping place.
The Kings, all together this time, pass overhead once more ; there is
a Crimson-wing with them, but he leaves them and makes his way
to a tall cypress while they keep on to the evergreen oaks behind the
house. The Roseate Cockatoo, ceasing at length from his misdirected
efforts to destroy his mate's aviary and murder his son, launches
himself into the air, circles round once and then heads for a garden
half a mile away, his screams growing fainter and fainter in the distance.
If his night's repose is as peaceful as the Perfect Gentleman's it is
a great deal more than he deserves !

Authentic records of the length of life attained by birds in captivity
are always of interest. Here is one concerning a Red-crested Cardinal
which belonged to,Mr. Melville, of Sutton Bridge, who writes: " I
bought it twenty-five years ago next May at Rosario, River Plate, and
it died on the 20th February, 1927."
Mrs. Prestwick says that she hears that a blue Lovebird was exhibited
at a recent show at the Hague, the owner being, apparently, a German.
Can any member supply further particulars ?
A scientific test of the value of ultra-violet rays to chickens is being
carried out by Mr. Will Hooley, F.Z.S., the well-known poultry judge,
at his research farm in Kent, where he is rearing one brood under
ordinary glass and another under the new glass which admits the
ultra-violet rays of the sun. He is also making experiments in feeding
chickens on foods that have been exposed to ultra-violet rays.
We shall look forward with much interest to the results obtained
by Mr. Hooley because we believe that the application of these rays

Avicultural Notes
to young animals of all kinds may have a most beneficial effect, and
we know of more than one aviculturist who has installed the system,
either by means of vita-glass or special electric lamps, into their
aviaries.
Bone-weakness is very prevalent in young animals that are reared
artificially, especially during the winter months in our dull climate,
and there is little doubt that this is accounted for to a large extent
by the absence of ultra-violet rays.
The application of artificial sunlight by means of electric lamps
made with special glass that admits the ultra-violet rays to tropical
sun-loving birds, should prove very beneficial, and the new Bird
House at the Zoological Gardens is to have such an installation.
For nearly six months a white Cockatoo has been living wild with
a flock of Rooks in a park near Reading, so the Daily Mail informs us.
It was formerly the pet of a lady living at Fleet in Hampshire, but
being frightened by a dog, flew away, and is now as shy as the Rooks
with which it lives quite happily.
The Editor of British Birds desires to make it known that his readers
have placed rings on the legs of over 170,000 wild birds during the last
seventeen years. Each ring is stamped Witherby, High Holborn,
London, and bears a distinctive number. Any person finding a bird
bearing such a ring is asked to communicate at once details of the
number and the date and place of the finding or capture of the bird
to the address named, in order that its migration and other history
may be recorded.
This system of ringing young birds has proved of immense value in
adding to our knowledge of the migration of birds. Two Kittiwake
Gulls ringed as nestlings, one in 1923 and the other in 1924, in the
Fame Islands, have been reported from Newfoundland in 1924 and
Labrador 1925 respectively.

Mr. Shore-Baily, in the interesting diary of his successes and failures,
mentions the fact, which is only too true, that members are slow to
record their failures, whereas these are often as helpful to fellow
members as are records of success, as they often show where a fault has
been, and what should be avoided. Members are urged to write full
accounts of the many incidents that happened in their aviaries and which
may be of interest to other members, and not to wait until they think
they are entitled to a medal before putting pen to paper.
In a recent consignment of birds from Mexico, received by Messrs.
Chapman, were three species which are apparently new to aviculture,
namely the Crested Grey Bird (Ptilogonys cinereus), a bird superficially
resembling the Clarino, but more closely allied to the Waxwings ; the
Thick-billed Cardinal (Pyrrhuloxia sinuata ); and the Mexican Barred
Partridge (Philortyx fasciatus) all very desirable species from the
avicultural point of view.

Europe, be awarded to :--
Captain H. S. Stokes, for breeding the Nyasa Lovebird (Agapornis
liliance (1926, page 169).
Mr. Herbert Bright, for breeding Grayson's Dove (Zenaidura
graysoni) (1926, p. 223).
It is proposed to award a medal to the following members for the
first case of breeding in Great Britain :--
Captain Reginald Waud, for breeding the Golden-crowned Conure
(Conurus aureus) (1926, p. 327).
Dr. Wildeboer, for breeding the Guiana Parrotlet (Psittacula
guianenses) (1926, p. 244).
If any member or reader should know of a previous instance, the
Hon. Secretary would be&amp;apos; glad of information without delay.

Sir, --The smaller Rails have always attracted me, and I am glad
to have had the chance of acquiring two species rare to Aviculture.
Limnopardalis rytirhynchus is given in the B.M. Handlist as hailing
from Brazil and Peru, though my four specimens are said to have come
from Guatemala. Length, 9 inches ; olive green above, deep slaty
grey below ; bill very long, pale green, spotted with red and blue
at the base.
The Black Rail of Africa, of which Mr. Gurney wrote last month,
is very attractive on account of its small size (7 inches) and neat shape.
I have two pairs and a baby, from Messrs. Gamage's collection.
Although not an authority on the keeping of Rails, I believe they
are pretty hardy, wanting a soft floor covering such as peat-moss,
plenty of branches to climb amongst, both indoors and out, and a small
pond fringed with coarse grass and rushes to induce them to nest,
which apparently they do readily. A coarse and not too rich
insectivorous food with boiled rice and potato and a little raw meat
seems to satisfy them.
H. S. Stokes.

NY ASA LOVEBIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.983515692307692" page_id="56773177"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Some time last July, Messrs. Chapman brought over a large
consignment of these birds. Amongst them were a number having
a good deal of black on the face and throat. Our Editor in the August
issue of the Magazine suggested that these were wild-bred hybrids,
between the Nyasa and Black-cheeked Lovebirds. In order to test
this theory I procured two pairs of the darkest-faced birds I could find.
These have nested several times but unfortunately no young have been
reared, but strange to say they have now entirely lost the black on
the face and could not be distinguished from birds of the normal colour.
Does not this do away with the hybrid theory ?
Wm. Shore-Baily.
[These dark-faced birds are rather puzzling. I have seen several
young aviary-bred Nyasa Lovebirds and some show no dark colour

on the cheeks, while others are nearly as dark as a hybrid which
Mr. Whitley bred and exhibited at the recent Crystal Palace Show.
The fact would seem to be that the Black-cheeked and Nyasa
Lovebird have comparatively recently sprung from a common ancestor
and have barely arrived at the stage when they can be regarded as
distinct species ; at any rate one still occasionally exhibits in its young
stage traces of a character which, in the adult stage, is only present
in the other.-- Ed.]

KING PARRAKEET IMITATING BARRABAND

<bodyText confidence="0.9900783" page_id="56773178"  page_num="115" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Among the birds I have kept at liberty this winter is a young
male King Parrakeet in immature plumage. As his companions of
the same species are adult and much taken up with matrimonial
affairs, he has associated a good deal with a Barraband, a playful
youngster with tastes similar to his own. Lately he has started to
imitate perfectly the calls of the Barraband. Most of the larger
Parrakeets possess to a greater or lesser degree the faculty of mimicry,
but it is interesting that the King should have acquired another
language while living at complete liberty with others of his own kind.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991671214285714" page_id="56773178"  page_num="115" year="" vol="">
Sir, --With reference to Lord Tavistock's letter in the February
number of the Magazine, suggesting feeding delicate birds like Bee-
eaters throughout the winter on cluster flies. I have used these flies
for years for certain birds, with, I am sure, most beneficial results :
there is a quick and noticeable result in the condition of my Crimson-
breasted Shrikes, to give only one example, when they have them.
As Lord Tavistock says, the flies are very easily captured when they
enter the house in the autumn, which in my case they do in swarms,
and I easily keep them alive in the small wire meat safes, which one
sees everywhere abroad; the difficulty of giving them sufficient
moisture I get over by placing a small sponge in a saucer, which it
must exactly fit, of water. In this way the flies cannot drown themselves
and obtain all the moisture they need.

COLOUR BREEDING IN BUDGERIGARS

<bodyText confidence="0.987139" page_id="56773179"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I am a great believer in in-breeding to produce any colour
in all stock.
I have in-bred my strain of Budgerigars (with what I consider
judgment) more than most people, and with no bad results. My birds
are not coddled in any way, it has always been the survival of the fittest.
Mr. Bradshaw bred a very good white (as whites go at present) from
a pair of blue Budgerigars he got from me, and I am not surprised
that Mrs. Chatterton has bred whites, as she got her male birds from
me, and her females from two gentlemen who got their original birds
from me.
For my own protection I may say I have no birds to spare.

This food is invaluable for feeding foreign seed-eaters given in addition to
their seed diet; Parrot and other Foreign Finches will rear their young
almost entirely on it. Used by a great number of leading aviculturists both
here and abroad. It will keep good for any length of time if turned out of
the bag and kept in a dry place.

OWLS
By Miss E. F. Chawner
Few people keep Owls or take any interest in them, but those who
do find them so charming that they can only marvel at the indifference
of the rest. When it is realized that all Owls are beautiful, many quite

hardy when once acclimatized, long-lived, and easily kept in health
and perfect plumage, quickly become tame, and are often warmly
attached to their keepers, their many merits should establish them
firmly in the affections of bird lovers.
As a rule their requirements are simple. My Owl's aviaries are merely
wooden structures of various sizes with wire-netting fronts. The small
species have their houses wired underneath as well, for fear of rats.
A stump or two and some perches of various sizes with the bark on are
all that is necessary inside with a barrel or box in the darkest corner.
All the floors are thickly strewn with coarse gritty gravel. Owls need
plenty of room if they are to do themselves justice. An ideal position is
one facing south, under large deciduous trees. During summer the
trees provide the necessary shade, and when the leaves are off the birds
have the benefit of any sun which may be granted us, and are protected
from north and easterly winds. If they have a dry abode and are safe
from draughts (this is very important) they do not mind cold weather
as long as their food is not frozen. They should be given a bath, for

though certain species have no use for water in any form, most of them,
especially the Wood Owls and Pigmies, are great bathers.
The staple food of all my Owls is rabbit, preferably wild ; they thrive
on it and do not seem to tire of it ; but of course they do better if their
food can be varied. Large species thoroughly enjoy a plump rat now
and then ; birds, drowned kittens, and mice are appreciated by them
all, though I have found that they soon tire of mice if they are supplied
in quantity, but as a titbit now and then they are eagerly taken.
Small Owls appear to be largely insectivorous. Pigmy and Scops Owls
are mostly fond of cockchafers, though there are exceptions. My hen
White-faced Scops (Scops leucotis) will catch and eat as many
cockchafers as are turned into her aviary, but the male bird will not
touch them. I have several times induced a sick bird to feed by giving
it cockchafer larvae, hand-feeding and even cramming it until it was
strong enough to feed itself.
Owls are not often on the sick list when they are properly housed
and fed, but care must be taken until they are acclimatized. Tropical
or southern species are much easier to manage than Arctic or Northern
kinds, the latter being very susceptible to cold and damp. The hens are
rather subject to egg-binding after they have been some years in con-
finement. The best, if not the only remedy, is heat. All kinds must
have fur or feather in some shape. Owls pair for life, and are usually
very faithful and affectionate. They begin to take an interest in each
other as soon as the moult is over, and by early spring are generally
ready to go to nest. Eagle Owls nest in a scrape made by the male bird
on the ground ; Burrowing Owls either tunnel into the earth for them-
selves or take possession of and adapt some other creature's burrow.
Wood Owls like hollows in trees, as do also certain Scops and Pigmy
Owls. Some kinds like a tree from which the top has been blown off,
and nest on the stump. The male bird digs the scrape or burrow or
carpenters at the chosen hollow, and when the hen is incubating or
has young it is his business to cater for the family while she stays and
guards her eggs or young. It is pretty to see the male return with his
prey and alight by the nest and give his mate what he has brought.
She feeds the young while he watches with the utmost pride and delight.
Incubation lasts four weeks, and the young are usually white or grey

when first hatched ; some resemble their parents as soon as their
feathers have grown, others have an intermediate plumage which often
differs considerably from that of the adult, which they do not attain until
the second moult. The larger kinds do not breed until they are three years
or more old ; they lay two eggs in a clutch, and may have two to three
clutches in a season. Incubation starts as soon as the first egg is laid,
and with some species the second clutch and even the third may be laid
before the first brood has left the nest, so that it may contain at one
time fledgelings, newly hatched young, and fresh eggs. Pigmy and
Scops Owls often lay three or more eggs in a clutch.
In confinement Owls usually seem willing to go to nest, but the eggs
are often infertile ; in all probability one great cause of this is want of
exercise, for Owls are mostly rather sedentary birds, unless spurred by
the necessity of hunting for food, which does not exist in an aviary.
Another cause may be inbreeding ; the pairs which come over are
frequently taken from the same nest, and unless a sufficient
number arrive at once to ensure a thorough shuffling, in all probability
brother and sister will be sold together and very few fertile eggs will
result from such a union. If they do hatch the young Owls must be
left to themselves as much as possible ; the less they are looked at the
better. Interference generally results in the young being devoured
by their parents.
When all goes well, the young remain in the nest until well feathered,
usually about a month ; for the first week or ten days the mother broods
them continually and scarcely leaves the nest at all, unless to defend
them against some real or fancied enemy, for this she will do to the
utmost of her power, choosing death rather than desert her offspring.
While they have young to feed, the old birds live very sparingly,
but make up for it during the autumn when they fatten themselves
up in preparation for cold weather.
European Eagle Owl (Bubo maximus), found throughout the
mountainous districts of Europe. Very large fine-looking birds, with
long ear4ufts, feathered legs, and beautifully variegated and
vermiculated plumage in shades of brown, black, and tawny, with a
white patch under the chin. Their irides are orange. Their call is a
fine, bell-like single hoot from the male, usually answered by his mate

with a double hoot pitched much higher. These Owls are very long-
lived if properly treated. They have been bred ; they are all the better
for a fast day once a week ; quite hardy and very fond of bathing.
They nest in a scrape prepared by the male, the clutch consists of two
large round white eggs ; incubation lasts four weeks. The young
have no intermediate plumage.
The Virginian Eagle Owl (B. virginianus and B. articus), from
South and North America, which are smaller and differ slightly together
with B. ascalephus from North Africa, are generally imported, as are
also the following : B. bengalensis, from India ; B . capensis, from
South Africa ; B. cinerescens, from West and East Africa ; B. lacteus ,
from South Africa ; B. blakistoni, from Japan.
The Spotted Eagle Owl ( Bubo maculatus), from South Africa, is&amp;apos;
the smallest Eagld Owl; a handsome bird, particularly the form which
is grey, thickly spotted all over with black. There is also a brown
variety, in which the spots are not as plentiful nor so distinct looking.
The ear tufts are short and broad, beak strong and black, eyes bright
buttercup yellow, legs covered with grey down, claws black. Quite
hardy, it is not very particular as to diet and not a very large feeder.
It nests in a scrape on the ground, and lays two eggs to the clutch.
Its note is a soft hoot, almost a coo. It is fond of bathing.
Fraser's Eagle Owl ( Bubo poensis ), from West Africa. A very
beautiful and distinct species, not often imported. In the intermediate
stage has a white downy head and breast, the back fawn colour mixed
with white, and black barred shoulders. Wing-coverts fawn. The
flights and tail yellow-barred black. Adult plumage : Head, wings,
tail, and back tawny yellow, barred with black, long ear-tufts of the
same ; breast white, finely barred with black ; legs the same ; claws
white ; eyes large and full, deep soft black, fringed vrith very long lashes.
Length when full-grown about 17 to 20 inches. It is not very hardy,
and requires a sheltered aviary with protection from cold in winter.
Its diet should consist of rabbits, young rats, mice, etc. It is very fond
of bathing. If kindly treated it becomes very tame, and fond of its
owner, but is capable of strong and lasting dislikes, and is jealous of
other birds. It likes to have its head scratched like a Parrot. The two
white eggs are laid in a scrape on the ground. Among sand or dried

grass a sitting bird would be practically invisible. The call is a rather
feeble hoot.
The Scops ( Otus ) are miniature Eagle Owls, possessing longer wings.
They are charming little birds, with beautiful plumage shading into
every tone of brown, grey, and black, and are easily kept and bred in
confinement. They are largely insectivorous. They are found all over
the world, save in Oceania. The plumage of many species varies between
individuals.
The Common Scops (Otus scops), native of Europe, is too well known
to need description. It is enough to say that owing to its small size
and docility it is a favourite cage bird. We have only space to
enumerate the various species of Scops which figure from time to time
in our aviaries : 0. pennatus, from India ; 0. semitorques, from Japan ;
0. bakJcamcenq, from India, and its varieties lettia, from China, and
lempiji , from Indo-China and the Malay States ; 0. asio, from North
America.
White-eared African Scops (0. leucotis). These beautiful little
birds are not quite hardy and cannot stand damp cold, but thrive
perfectly in an enclosed unheated aviary. They are about the size of a
Song Thrush, have large faces, white cheeks, and grey beaks very thickly
covered with long white hair, hiding the nostrils ; crown of the head
grey speckled and vermiculated with black and a black outline round
the face. The eyes are large, glowing copper. The breast is streaked
grey on white, legs white, feet large, lead coloured, back and wings
streaked and mottled grey and black. The general effect is singularly
beautiful and rich. They have the curious habit of bowing rapidly
many times in succession while uttering a continuous husky chattering
sound, this appears to denote pleasure, and is used to greet friends,
the offer of food, or merely in answer to a word in passing. The breeding
call is a soft grunting coo, and the anger note a savage growl. They
spend most of the day dozing on a high perch, and if disturbed open
their wonderful eyes to the fullest extent and lunge forward at the
enemy with open beaks, at the same time swearing like an angry cat-
It can easily be guessed that a squirrel or any other enemy coming
suddenly upon them in a tree would get the fright of its life when con-
fronted with such threatening gestures.

Probably they nest in a state of nature on a lofty tree whose top
has been blown off, but in my aviary they adopted an enamelled iron
pie-dish filled with sawdust, laid two eggs, one of which proved addled,
and reared a young bird. Incubation lasted a month, during which the
male collected and carried food to his mate. When the young hatched
the hen w T as very fierce, and flew straight for my face when I fed her.
The nestling was covered with greyish white down, and remained in
the dish for four weeks, by which time it was well feathered. Its call
for food was a low hissing croak, and it did not bow like its parents
until after it could feed itself and was quite independent. Its plumage
was like its mother's ; the cheeks were grey instead of white, the back
darker and breast greyer. The ear-tufts did not show until it was quite
well feathered everywhere else.
These Scops never bathe nor apparently do they drink. I have never
seen them dust, but they are always snowy white and speckless. Like
all of that genus they are enormous feeders, and cannot fast like other
Owls. They cannot digest rats or very old rabbit, are fond of birds,
mice, which last they usually swallow whole, and field voles, also young
kittens. They are not often imported.
v Cyprean Scops (0. cypreus). These lovely little birds are peculiar
to Cyprus, and are strictly protected. My pair were hand-reared and
brought over by the late Major Horsburgh ; I have never heard of any
others being imported. Their plumage is full and very soft, all shades of
soft grey, beautifully mingled until they look like a piece of lichenous
bark ; eyes black. They are tiny creatures. My pair were very tame and
accustomed to be hand fed ; they had very large appetites, were
particularly fond of mealworms and cockchafer-grubs, and would gulp
down seven or eight full-grown ones at a meal--no small feat for such
tiny birds. They also had mice, Sparrows, or chopped-up rabbit, but
preferred the two former. They proved fairly hardy, and came safely
through the winter in a sheltered aviary with a box to retire into in bad
weather. They were very silent, but occasionally uttered a low croak
when hungry. They bathed occasionally.
The Wood Owls (Asio) are of medium size, have well-developed
facial disks, and long ear-tufts.

uncommon in fir-woods in England. It is rather smaller than the
Tawny Owl, and more elegantly shaped. Its face is round and
ornamented, with two long erect ear-tufts. The eyes are orange. The
ground colour of its plumage is brown, but it is beautifully streaked and
mottled in the most protective style, so that when it sits motionless
pressed close up against a fir-tree trunk with its eyes closed it is
exceedingly difficult to discern even if the observer is looking directly
at it. It nests in hollow trees ; there are usually two young in a brood.
It hunts chiefly by night, and is a friend to the farmer, since it destroys
a great many mice and rats. It is vociferous, and has a variety of notes,
screams, mews, and other noises. It does well in confinement.
The Short-eared Owl (A. accipitrinus) is another European
species, it frequents marshes and moors, and nests on the ground. It is
slightly larger than the above, and carries short thick ear-tufts. The
plumage is rusty brown, mottled with dark brown. Eyes yellow. It
endures confinement well.
The Brazilian Long-eared Owl (Asio clamator) has only lately
been imported. It is larger than the English kind, and very handsome.
Probably it has much the same habits in its natural state ; in con-
finement it is fairly docile and lives well; is fond of bathing. Is drowsy
by day, and usually feeds at dusk ; is fond of rats, mice, and birds,
but will eat rabbit. The back and long wings, which project beyond
the tail, are yellowish brown mottled and vermiculated with pale black.
The belly rather bright buff, also the legs and feathered feet; toes long
and slender, claws black. The breast is yellowish, with a large dark
centre to each feather. When young the facial markings are very
striking ; the head is buff, bright chestnut, with a faint black spot
just over the eyes ; cheeks darker, but still bright chestnut; a broad
white stripe forms a St. Andrew's Cross between the eyes down to the
black beak ; chin white, with a few black spots ; the whole enclosed
by a thin black line ; ear-tufts very long ; eyes black. In voice and
habits it is very much like the English Long-eared Owl. Is quite hardy,
and thrives on the same food.
The Brazilian Short-eared Owl (Asio stygius), from Brazil, is
rarely imported. It is an exceptionally beautiful bird of very elegant
shape, the size is about the same as a Barn Owl. Its colour is golden-

brown, with a dark centre to each feather. Ear-tufts short and thick,
face very round, eyes black with a bright golden ring. Mine was a greedy,
rather lazy bird, and was all the better for a weekly fast. It bathed
occasionally, and was crepuscular in its habits. Its call was a sharp,
rather melodious " wow ", several times repeated. It never became
really tame.
A. grammicus, a closely allied species, has been brought over.
The African Swamp Owl (Asio nisuella), from North Africa and
South Spain. Quite a number were imported by the late Mr. Hamlyn
in 1921. They varied very much in character ; a female which I bought
has never become at all tame or tractable, but a young male was as
tame as any bird in my collection, and very playful. It is dark chocolate
brown, with dark brown eyes. Some have short ear-tufts, which usually
lie flat but can be erected. The beak and claws are black. It is quite
hardy and lives well on rabbit with an occasional bird or mouse. The
note is a harsh loud squawk or bark, frequently repeated. It is
crepuscular.
The Fishing Eagle Owls ( Ketupa ), with long ear-tufts, are to be
found in Asia and the adjacent islands. They may be known by their
long and very powerful, almost bare, legs. They live near watercourses
and feed on fish, but in captivity they will thrive on meat, and are long-
lived.
From time to time K. ceylonensis has been imported. It is found
from Palestine to Indo-China ; also K. ketupa indigenous to the Malay
Peninsula and the Sondian Isles.
The Scotopelia only differ from the above in not having ear-tufts.
They are natives of Africa. S. peli and S . oustaleti have been imported.
The birds of the genus Huhua differ from those of Bubo in having
transverse stripes across their breasts. They are very handsome, and
four species have been imported. H. shelleyi from the Gold Coast ;
H. nipalensis from the Himalayas ; H. orientalis from Malay ; and
H. pcensis from West Africa.
The Snowy Owl (Nyctea nyctea) is a magnificent Arctic Eagle
Owl without ear-tufts, having white plumage when full adult, and
more or less streaked and spotted with ashy brown while immature.
It inhabits the Arctic regions and the Himalayas. It is sometimes met

with in the temperate zone during severe winters. It does well in
captivity, and has been bred, but needs care.
The Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata), from South America,
is also known as the Downy Owl, and is a very distinct and handsome
species. It is perhaps the most easily tamed of all Owls, being very
fond of having its head and neck scratched like a Parrot. This
charming bird is larger than the Tawny Owl, has a black face with white
" spectacles " round the bright yellow eyes, and a white beak thickly
fringed with hair. The top of the head and back are brownish black,
tail and wings brownish black faintly barred with grey ; breast, belly,
and legs bright tan, claws black. It has a faint white half-circle round
the front of the throat. Perfectly hardy and easily kept in health,
fond of bathing. Nests in hollow trees. The call of the male in the
breeding season is a kind of rattle, rather like a miniature machine-
gun, at other times a gruff sort of growl, and a gentle twitter when
greeting its friends.
Young birds have the top of the head white and a black mask over
the face, the breast much paler, and the back and wings brownish
faintly barred. They should be fed like the foregoing. All too rarely
imported. Anyone fortunate enough to own one of these delightful
birds should house it where it can enjoy human society, as it soon
mopes when it is left to itself.
The genera Ninox and Sceloglaux form a group of small Owls which
are probably widely spread over Asia and Oceania. They do very well
in confinement, and some of them, especially the Australian species,
have been imported from time to time.
The Marbled Owl (Ninox ocellata), from West Australia, is now
very rarely imported. It is a pretty little bird, about the same size as
the Little Owl, gentle and confiding in an aviary. The plumage is
full and very soft, general colour dusky brown, breast lighter, and
streaked with warm brown. The wing-coverts and the scapulars are
" marbled " with round white spots ; the eyes are greyish but sometimes
when the light catches the pupils they look as red as rubies. A dark
patch just behind the eyes adds very much to their beauty. They are
fond of cockchafers and mealworms, and will pick up and eat large
smooth-skinned caterpillars and those large brown spiders which live

among rubbish. They nest in hollows and lay three to four rather large
wdiite eggs. Their call is a double hoot, which sounds very much like
a Cuckoo gone flat. They are great bathers, and should be fed like the
Tawny Owls with the addition of insects when obtainable. My cock
bird is 17 years old this summer.
As far as I know, the other species hitherto imported are N . boobook
and N. connivens , from Australia ; N. novas zealandice and Sceloglaux
albifacies from New Zealand.
The Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) is a widely spread, very well-known
bird commonly distributed throughout England and Europe. It is
round-headed, the plumage very full and soft. Its colouring is shades of
brown and tawny, breast paler, all finely mottled and vermiculated ;
on the wings a series of large, cream-coloured, or white spots. Eyes
black, beak greyish or horn-coloured, legs feathered with grey down.
Call a loud ringing hoot several times repeated, and a sharp " kiwick,
kiwick A fine, strongly flying bird, which hunts chiefly by night.
Hand-reared specimens become very tame, and can be allowed their
liberty at night, returning to their aviary for the day. They nest in
hollow trees or in barrel-shaped boxes, have from two to four young
in a brood, and nest twice in the year. They are great bathers, and
perfectly hardy. Their food in confinement should be fur or feather, but
they are not dainty.
Sharpe's Wood Owl (Strix nuchale ), from West Africa. Another
very handsome species, a typical Wood Owl, round headed, with black
eyes and cinnamon coloured plumage. Its habits and requirements are
similar to the Tawny Owl. It is not often imported, but appears to be
quite hardy and becomes very tame. It is a size larger than the
Tawny Owl.
S. woodfordi , an allied species from East Africa, has also been
imported, as have the following : S. uralensis , from Siberia and Russia ;

caparoch, from North America ; all handsome birds, having their
plumage delicately marked with grey, brown, and white.
The Little Owl [Athene noctua). A common species on the Continent,
was introduced into England by the late Lord Lilford, and has become
naturalized. It is gradually spreading all over the country and has
given rise to much controversy, many people considering it a dangerous
pest, others protesting that it destroys more vermin than game, and
should therefore be protected. It is a small bird, rather larger than a
Thrush, grey, thickly speckled with white ; its eyes are round and
staring, rather pale yellow, eyelids white. It is very active, bobbing up
and down in a ludicrous manner when it sees anyone approaching. It
hunts by day and destroys a great many birds as well as mice&amp;apos;and
beetles. It nests in holes and there may be three or four eggs to the
clutch. It has a variety of calls, ranging from chuckles to loud shrieks,
interspersed with cat-like mewing. It has been bred in confinement.
An allied species from India (A. hr amah) has likewise been imported.
Burrowing Owls (Speotyto cunicularia), South America, are
occasionally imported and make amusing pets. Their habits are well
known from many illustrations and articles. In America they share
burrows with " Prairie Dogs " and (possibly) rattle-snakes, and bob
up and down excitedly at the approach of a stranger. They are about
the size of Athene noctua , but stand higher, being longer in the leg.
Their heads and backs are speckled brown, the wings brown barred
with white, as is also the tail. Under parts and legs pure snowy white,
in spite of their burrowing habits. The young have brown heads without
any markings. The eyes are bright yellow, beak pale. Their call is a
harsh croak, but if disturbed or alarmed they spread their wings and
screech loudly for several minutes on end. They also " swear ", which
sounds like a tap being suddenly turned on. They run very swiftly.
My pair constructed a burrow in their aviary but did not go to any
great depth, and the soil fell in several times until I put a drain-pipe
inside the burrow. They worked hard at deepening and enlarging it,
and finally started nesting. To my regret the hen died egg-bound
with her third egg. The cock lived many years longer, but I was unable
to get another mate for him. They are quite hardy, and do well on
rabbit and other fur and feather. None have recently been imported

to my knowledge. They have been bred in confinement. An allied
species inhabiting California and Central America ( S . hypogcea) has been
imported.
The Sparrow Owls (Glaucidium) are tiny birds scarcely larger than
a Sparrow.
The Passerine Owl (G . passerinum). Mountains of Europe,
particularly Switzerland. They have no ear-tufts and are much more
diurnal and active than the somewhat lethargic Scops. They are great
bathers, very quick in all their movements, eaten up with curiosity,
and interested in all that goes on. They have rather long tails, which
they wag from side to side, while they bob up and down with excited
chirps. Their eyes are light yellow, head and back dark brown thickly
speckled with lighter spots and marks, wings brown with a reddish
tinge on the flights, with paler bars, tail the same ; the feet are heavily
feathered, claws black. The eyes are ringed with pale grey and the eye-
brows and facial disk are white, as is the beak. Breast light grey, with
dark streaks. They need a good deal of exercise, and should be given
a larger aviary than their diminutive size would indicate. They are
hardy in the South of England. They should have Sparrows and mice.
Mexican Pigmy Owl (G. fishery, habitat Mexico. About the
same size as the last, and with much the same habits and colouring,
but closer feathered. A bold, fierce little creature with bright yellow
eyes. On the back of the head, which is brown wdth small speckles, it
has a curious grey-brown crescent-shaped mark. The unpaired male
during the breeding season utters a metallic clinking cry, like the sound
of a hammer on metal, nine or ten times repeated. It was very rarely
imported, but last year several pairs came over. Mine went to nest in
a wooden nest-box, and sat steadily for four weeks, but either the eggs
were clear or went bad, as they did not hatch and the birds did away
with them when they had sat their full time. Food and treatment should
be the same as for the Sparrow Owls.
Jardines' Pigmy Owl (G. jardinii), Venezuela and Colombia.
This bird also much resembles the last named, but the colour of the
wings and tail is more rufous. It requires the same treatment and food.
Mine went to nest in a small box and reared two young, a third vanishing
when about two days' old. The nestlings are tiny creatures, covered

with snowy white down, and unlike their parents are very clamorous.
The first few days of their existence mine were continually brooded by
their mother, but afterwards could plainly be seen beside her in the box.
They were fed on mice and Sparrows. When fledged the young are
paler copies of their parents, the white less pure, and the brown not
so warm in tint. Their call is a little trilling twitter. Both of mine
lived to grow up.
Besides the above, the following species have been imported :
G. phaloenoides , from Trinidad, and G. perlatum, from South Africa.
Photodilus badius , which inhabits the Himalayas, is a small brown
Owl, which forms a link between the preceding groups and the Barn
Owls. It has been brought over alive.
The Barn Owls ( Tyto ) differ from all other birds of prey in their
anatomy. They chiefly inhabit barns, belfries, or caves in cliffs, and are
exceedingly useful in destroying rats and mice. They are to be met with
all over the world.
The Barn Owl {Tyto alba) is a very beautiful bird, having yellowish
tawny plumage mingled with silvery grey, and lightly marked with
small black spots. The under parts and breast are snowy white. The
facial disk is well developed, the eyes are black and deep-set; the beak
white and partly covered with a thick fringe of hair, legs rather long and
knock-kneed covered with white down, claws black. It is entirely
nocturnal and therefore not very interesting in an aviary. It is
a smaller, closer feathered bird than the Tawny. It nests in a barn or
hollow tree, and it is not uncommon to find fresh eggs in the nest at the
same time as young birds. Barn Owls do not bathe and appear not
to drink often. They utter a loud screech and sometimes a hissing
call. They will eat rabbits, rats, and mice, etc., and are quite hardy.
They have been bred in confinement. These are most useful birds to
farmers and countrymen, as they destroy enormous numbers of rats
and mice, and are too nocturnal to take chickens or young birds,
which are all under cover by the time the Owls start hunting.
Other species which have been imported are : T. pratincola, North
America ; T. delicatula , Australia ; T. punctatissima, Galapagos
Islands ; T. capensis, South Africa, and T. arfaki , from New Guinea.

SOME RARE MEXICAN BIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.999246545454545" page_id="56773213"  page_num="130" year="" vol="">
Some time last November Mr. J. Bruce Chapman, to whom we
aviculturists owe so much, for his enterprise in bringing over so many
rare birds from all parts of the world, imported a fine consignment from
the port of Yera Cruz in Mexico. Amongst these were about a dozen
of the little Lark Sparrow ( Chondestes grammacus strigatus), which I
secured. This little bird has the upper parts brownish grey, streaked
with blackish and the under parts white, the head prettily striped with
grey, white, and chestnut. Its habitat is California and Western
America, but it apparently finds its way also into Mexico, unless
my birds should prove to be a sub-species resident there. Some of my
specimens have the throat and breast washed with yellow. I noticed
when I bought them that some of them had a small spot of yellow on the
throat, and thought that these would be the males, but on dissection
this has proved not to be the case. I have examined all the skins in
the British Museum and none of them show any trace of yellow, and
I cannot recollect ever having seen any with this marking in California,
where they were quite common. I am hoping to get them to breed
this year, and may then be able to find out something more about them.
Another interesting bird was the Dickcissel (Sjpiza americana) or
Black-throated Bunting. This is a pretty bird, and hardy. The upper
parts are mixed grey, brown, and black ; chin and throat white, with
a black patch in centre ; breast bright yellow. I secured two or three
specimens, but I am afraid all males, and these are now in full song.
This species was bred by Mr. Teschemaker a good many years ago.
In this consignment were quite a lot of Thrushes, of which I bought
about a dozen. I found on getting them home that there were three
different species, but it took some time to separate them, as they
were in such rough condition, some of them being almost denuded of
feathers through fighting. The most interesting was a Wood Thrush
(Hylocichla meistelina). This little Thrush is very like our own bird,
but is not much more than half the size. It is a native of the U.S.A.,
migrating to Mexico in the winter. I think that my bird must be a
hen, as it has made no attempt at singing yet. Another Thrush turned

out to be Turdus tristis, a bird not unlike a ben Blackbird. It did not
live long. The other proved to be Turdus flavipes. These have the upper
parts olivaceous brown, breast and abdomen greyish bull, throat
white, chin striped with black ; as the white on the throat extends
below the stripes, it gives the bird the appearance of carrying a white
collar, which makes it look not unlike our Ring Ouzel. It is impossible
to sex the five birds that have survived, but I am hoping that I shall
find a true pair amongst them.
Early in January Mr. Chapman had another important con-
signment of Mexican birds, amongst them being, I think, several
species new to aviculture. The most interesting is the Rose-breasted
Cardinal, a bird that I am inclined to think will be found to be a new
species. These birds are about the same size as the Common Cardinal,
but are totally unlike them in colour. They differ in having the crest
buff, a patch on the cheeks buff, a patch under the black throat yellow,
and the abdomen pink. About eighty came over, besides a lot of the
Common Cardinals, including a good many hens, but as the latter had
not been separated from each other, it was impossible to say to which
of the two species these belonged. It has been suggested by some
ornithologists that these birds are merely immature specimens of the
Common Cardinal, but I cannot believe this, as this latter bird has bred
on more than one occasion in this country and the young are said to be
like the hen. It is my belief that the birds are adults, and this seems
to be borne out by the fact that a bird imported last year has not changed
colour. However, Mr. Chapman is taking steps to bring over some more
with the females, and then we shall have a chance of breeding them
and learning something more about them. In the meantime, they appear
to be lacking a scientific name. 1 Another interesting importation was
that of the Thick-billed Cardinal, and I secured a true pair of these.
Their scientific name is Pyrrhuloxia sinuata sinuata. They appear to
be very closely allied to the Cardinals. Their colour is dark grey, wuth
a red crest and tail, under parts huffish pink or red, the hen not so
bright in these parts. Their most curious feature is the beak, which is
very short and thick, like that of the Bullfinch, hence one of the trivial

names--the Bullfinch Cardinal. This bird is found in Texas and Arizona,
as well as in Mexico, and its habits seem to be very similar to those of
the Red Cardinal. They appear to have a rather peculiar body scent,
similar to what one finds in the Petrels. I do not know whether this has
been previously noted. I also secured half a dozen specimens of the
Californian Scarlet Tanager, which differs considerably from the
common Scarlet Tanager, more usually seen in this country. The cock
has the back, shoulders, wings, and tail more or less striated with
huffish yellow, head and throat crimson, under parts yellowish.
Female olive green, under parts yellow, two bands of dirty white across
the wings. This bird is common on the wooded slopes of the Sierras in
California, and presumably migrates to Mexico, unless it is resident there
also. I do not think that it has yet been bred here in captivity. Another
purchase was a pair of small Hangnests (Icterus spurius), about the size of
our Brambling. These are mostly black and yellow, but are not yet in
full colour, so am unable to describe them. They appear to be good
aviary birds, as they partake freely of Thrush food, and do not seem to
require much fruit, so should be easy to care for. My last acquisition
was a pair of small black and yellow Siskins (Chrysomitris tristris).
They are most charming little birds, black on top and bright yellow
underneath, with a white spectrum on the wing. I fear that they are
rather delicate, but if they live shall hope to breed them. 1 I don't
think that any of the birds mentioned in these notes have been bred
here, so I am looking forward to an interesting season in my aviaries
this year.
Just as I had finished writing these notes I recollected one species
that I had not mentioned, and that a not unimportam me, the Mexican
Barred Partridge (Philortyx fasciatus). This is a s; : ird, about the
size of the Scaly Quail (Callipepla squamata), an. ts habits appear
similar, as it is fond of roosting in trees, like all tne Crested Quail.
I don't know whether I have secured a true pair, as the sexes appear
to be alike. Time alone will show.

Now that the breeding season is once more upon us, some notes
on the management and breeding of Lovebirds may not be out of place.
The genus Agapornis belongs to the sub-family Palseornithinse, and as
far as is known at present consists of ten members : (1) the Madagascar

or Grey-headed (A. cana) ; (2) the Abyssinian (A. taranta) ; (3) the
Red-faced (A. pullaria) ; (4) the Rosy-faced or Peach-faced (A.

(9) Swinderen's (A. swindereniana) ; (10) the Black-collared

<bodyText confidence="0.989714541666667" page_id="56773216"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
(A. zenkeri).
The first six are all well known ; Fischeri and the Masked are
exceedingly rare and swindereniana and zenkeri have not yet reached
this country alive. The genus is confined to the continent of Africa, and
a few adjacent islands. Once acclimatized, they are all very hardy, and
can be kept in unheated outdoor aviaries throughout the year with
safety, provided they have good, dry, draught-proof shelters. They
are simple feeders, and no elaborate mixtures are needed ; most are
satisfied with canary seed and white millet, with the addition of a little
white sunflower and a few good oats, millet sprays, and seeding grasses
are very acceptable ; hemp should be avoided, except sparingly in
very cold weather, as it appears to make them fat and sluggish. Fruit
of all kinds is despised by most, a few, however, will eat apple and pear
in minute quantities ; some will eat lettuce with apparent relish. When
possible they should be kept in aviaries, as their chief charm lies in the
way they climb and scramble about, besides which their full beauty
is only seen when in flight. In cages they are apt to mope at their loss
of liberty and become dull and listless, sitting side by side and taking
very little interest in life in general, only moving to visit the seed and
water-pots. If, however, no other accommodation is available, and it is
desired to keep a pair of Lovebirds, possibly Red-faced are the most
suitable, being the least active of the group ; Mr. W. T. Catleugh
kept a hen of this species in a cage for nearly ten years, and several for
about six years, so it will be seen that pullaria can be successfully kept

as prolific as Budgerigars and as little trouble ; the same cannot be said
of taranta and pullaria, as the former has only been reared successfully
on two or three occasions and there is no record of complete success
with the latter. They readily take to coco-nut husks, but a nest-box
is more suitable for sanitary reasons.
The various species of Agapornis agree together fairly well, provided

display. They are not to be trusted with smaller and weaker birds,
having a passion for breaking the legs of any unfortunate they can get
hold of. The various species will be dealt with in the order given at the
head of this paper.
The nest-box illustrated is eminently suitable for Lovebirds, and will
be found to meet all requirements. The spherical recess in the base can
be omitted if desired, and is not really necessary, owing to the nest-
building propensity of the group. It is as well, however, to construct the
boxes with the recess, then when occasion arises they can be used for
any of the smaller Parrakeets.

The Madagascar or Grey-headed Lovebird is probably the best
known of the group, having been imported in enormous numbers for
some years. No detailed description of this species is needed : it will
suffice to say that the cock is distinguished from the hen in having the
whole of the head, neck, and upper breast grey, and under wing-coverts
black, whereas the hen has the head and under wing-coverts green.
The first importation was in 1860, and a pair was on view at the London
Zoological Gardens in that year. They are quite unsuitable for cage life
and when thus kept, as a rule, crouch in a corner and utter harsh
scolding notes whenever anyone approaches. In an aviary they remain
very timid, and seldom get really tame. Madagascars are very spiteful
with weaker birds, especially when thinking of nesting, the hens more so
than the cocks. They associate well with Budgerigars and Passerine
Parrotlets, with only occasional sparring. They do best in an aviary
by themselves, however, otherwise in mixed company, especially if
they are at all crowded, they are liable to play at nesting. In the wild
state they associate in large flocks, often as many as a hundred together,
and sometimes do considerable damage to the rice crops. The nest is
constructed in a hole in a tree, being completely lined with pliant strips
of bark, carried under the upper tail-coverts ; this method of carrying
material is usually adopted in captivity, but some carry pieces of bark,
splinters of wood, fragments of millet sprays and strips of leaves in their
beaks. The hen alone usually cuts the bark, etc., and carries it to the
nest, the cock meanwhile keeping guard. A nest-box similar to the one
illustrated is usually accepted by this species, although some shun boxes
of any kind, and lay their eggs anywhere but in the proper place.
Mrs. Charrington had a pair some years ago that burrowed under a tub,
containing a box-tree, in an aviary where they constructed a nest in the
usual manner, on the ground ; just a slight hollow filled with cuttings
of leaf. The first nest contained clear eggs; they nested again,
but with the same result. The eggs of Madagascars vary considerably
in size, the average being 18*4 mm. by 13'8 mm., and the number from
four to six or even more. Incubation seems to take nineteen to twenty
days, the hen alone doing this, the cock feeding her. The cocks can be
picked out in nesting plumage, as their heads are a mixture of greyish

green and green. On leaving the nest the young cocks have darker
beaks than the parent birds, the hood is apparent, but not very defined.
Fully adult plumage is donned at the first moult. The first to be success-
ful in breeding this species in Great Britain was F. W. Oates, who had
four young reared in 1900. In this case the hard-worked hen was
deserted by the cock for a Passerine Parrotlet, but she managed to rear
the brood alone nevertheless. Amongst others to be successful with
this Lovebird may be mentioned the late Dr. Lovell Keays, the late
Mr. Wesley T. Page, Mr. W. Shore-Baily, Dr. P. Gosse, and Mrs. F. G.
Hedges. Aviary-bred birds are apt to be delicate, many suffering from
a form of asthma. The Marquis of Tavistock states that " Madagascars
breed freely at liberty, but in a state of freedom are liable to become
paralysed in the legs ". The reason for this is not known, as aviary birds
do not suffer in this way. Madagascars may be left out all year with
perfect safety, provided they are not allowed to roost in the open as
they are susceptible to lung trouble.

That tropical and semi-tropical birds can be accustomed to our
British climate is generally recognized. But as a rule there is some
qualification attached to this statement, such as special accommodation
or feeding, so perhaps an account of how some of the common and
less expensive seed eaters have been wintered on this bleak south-west
Lancashire coast, may be of interest to those readers of the Avicultural
Magazine, who like myself, do not profess to be experts, nor wealthy
enough to maintain large and elaborate aviaries.
My bird census on 15th September, 1926, was 64 birds of 22 species.
All seed-eaters, such as Waxbills, Buntings, Finches, Canaries, Pekin
Bobins, Whydahs, Weavers, Siskins, etc., all reasonably priced birds
that one might experiment with.
My census to-day, 30th March, 1927, is 56 birds, 24 species (I bought
6 birds in January, 4 Lavender Finches and 2 Avadavats, thus increasing
the kinds by 2). The losses are 19 all species, 9 from pneumonia, 4 from

old age, and 6 from attacks by other birds, egg-binding or accident.
During the six months I have bought 6 birds, the natural increase being
5, these are Silverbills and Zebra Finches, 3 and 2 respectively.
The conditions under which my birds are kept were described in
the October, 1924, Yol. II, No. 10, Avicultural Magazine, but I
might state that with the exception of an oil lamp kept burning during
the months October to date in the shelter, the birds have had no other
protection against the damp and cold of this last winter.
They are fed on a mixture of canary, hemp, white millet, Indian
millet, sunflower and teazle, together with soft food made of Spratts
cod liver oil and softbill foods, to which is added maw seed.
They get unlimited supplies of greenstuff, mostly garden weeds, etc.,
and the floor of the flights are grassed.
They can sleep inside or out as they choose, for though the shelter
window is lowered, it is never closed. Fire Finch, Siskin,
Grey Singing Finch, Saffron Finch, Orange Weaver, and one pair
Zebras have slept out all winter, and seem to prefer to do so, whatever
the weather. The Javas, Whydahs, Nonpareil Buntings, and Cordon
Bleus are more discriminating, and go indoors if the weather is stormy.
PekinBobins, Canaries, Combassous, Silverbills, Lavenders, Waxbills,
and Fire Finches prefer the warm bedroom.
I don't know if my losses from pneumonia are due to the change of
temperature from outside to inside, but I don't think this is entirely the
cause, for the shelter is seldom more than 50* F. and in frosty weather
has fallen to 40*. I rather put them down to the fog and damp we get
so much of here, along with cold damp winds. The losses from old age
we are all liable to, for we can seldom tell the age of an adult bird
when bought. I generally look at the length of the upper mandible,
and the state of the tarsus, but this method is not infallible. All
these four birds were in splendid plumage and condition.
The murders and accidents were preventable. A Green Singing
Finch cock was responsible for three ; he wiped out the Siskin family,
father and two sons, and himself died of fright when I caught him
after the event. The other two were egg-binding, which I should
have seen to earlier. The moulting times are the critical ones so far
as I can see, and if we can get our birds through without loss, we have

our reward in perfect plumage and greater resistive power. For instance,
a cock Cordon Bleu which I have had three years is much more
brilliant in colour and thicker in the feathers than others I have had
only one year. The same applies to one of my Nonpareil cocks, he is
much brighter now than when I first received him. I wonder if any
one can tell me when a Nonpareil cock gets his adult plumage. I have
a bird, bought as a hen, now showing unmistakable male colour. This
bird I have had two years, bought in July, 1925.
The Pekin Eobins are in excellent fettle, and are busy with domestic
duties, as are some of the others.
A cock Combassou gives the Whydahs a very anxious time ; he will
not allow them to feed at the same time as he and his wives, and
though, of course, they are much heavier birds, he goes for them like
a terrier ; with this exception, since the Green Singing Finch cock
deceased, the inhabitants of the aviary get on well together.

Sir, --Cannot the Avicultural Society do something to improve the
conditions and management of Public Aviaries. At a few aviaries I
have visited in the north of England there was a deplorable lack of
interest shown by those responsible for the stocking and management
of these aviaries. A man is put in charge of an aviary who knows
nothing about birds and he has to take instructions from Town
Councillors who know less.
At one place I saw Pheasants being kept in a glass house in which
were Parrots and monkeys. A Silver Pheasant hen was laid on the
floor and had lost the use of its legs. I asked the keeper why it was
allowed to live in that state, and he told me that he could not do any-
thing without instructions from the Borough Engineer.
At a seaside place I visited they have some ideal aviaries with
running water in. In one of the aviaries were a few Canaries and a Golden
Pheasant cock in a dilapidated state. In another was a Silver cock too
fat to walk with a pure-bred Amherst Pheasant hen, a rather scarce
and valuable bird to be wasted.

Even what is supposed to be a Lancashire Zoological Garden has no
fancy Pheasants, the only one I saw being a Ring-neck, which seemed to
be in the last stages of consumption.
In my opinion it is the duty of every member of this society to offer
advice and help to the councils who own public aviaries.
In two cases my advice has been accepted and an improvement
has taken place.
There must be aviaries in other parts of England where advice is
needed. I think a list of all public aviaries should be published in the
Magazine and reports sent in by members of the birds kept and their
conditions. It cannot be any help to aviculture to have birds shown
under such wretched conditions.
An official letter from this Magazine suggesting that some member
living near would be pleased to give advice, would do an immense
amount of good.

Sir, --Will some member kindly give a novice some information as
to the keeping of Blue-winged Lovebirds in a cage ? An article in the

Would that apply to two box-cages put together, each 24 by
12 by 18 inches high. Would it be best to keep to the Finch tribe ?
They would go into a small covered aviary for the summer months,
but are chiefly kept as house pets. Any information would be
gratefully received.

For the past two seasons several kinds of birds which usually nest
in the open have built in the climbing plants on the house walls.
Besides Flycatchers and Robins, several Thrushes and Blackbirds
now nest close under the eaves ; and last year, a Goldfinch built in
the wistaria close to a bedroom window.
Already this spring, a Thrush and a Blackbird have tucked their
nests under the low eaves of the well-house, which adjoins a back door.
Their object seems to be to have cover above them and to be near
a frequented path.
At one time the house gave shelter to the following nests : Sparrow,
Starling, House Martin, Blackbird, Thrush, Kobin, Wren, Flycatcher,
Goldfinch, and Cole-Tit. (The last appropriately in the coal-house wall.)

Sir, --In the November issue of the Magazine, Mr. F. R. Child
asked whether the Prince Lucian Conure had been bred in captivity.
It has been many times in France, as Delacour has written in his
article on Conures. I saw a brood of this species in Madame Lecallier's
aviaries, about 1918 and later. (See UOiseau, 1920, p. 31.) I myself
possessed a pair of the young bred by Madame Lecallier ; they have
laid several times, but the young were never reared to maturity, likely
because the parents were troubled by other large birds, which lived
in their aviary (Glossy Starlings, Jays, etc.).
Last winter I received, among other birds, a fine pair of Chalcomitra
senegalensis, now in fine condition, and a pair of Hedydipna platura ;
but the cock died and I have only the hen left. I have just received
from Senegambia some Masked Fire Finches, a young Zonogastris
citerior, and an albino Fire Finch ; this bird is completely white, except
on the tail, which is tinged with brown, and on the lores and chest,
which are of a delicate pink colour. J. Decoux.

Sir, --Since writing my article I have heard from Mr. Mann, curator
of birds in the National Zoological Park at Washington ; he says the
bird may be considered very unusual in captivity and none too common
in a wild state. It is represented in their collection. The dealers from
the far west do not know the bird.
I have never seen a parrot more affectionate or playful than this
one with my young son, aged 7. He is restless or noisy until Warren
appears, when he utters sounds which most certainly express affection.
Unfortunately he does not talk, but the various sounds he makes are
amusing. He delights in crawling all over the boy, snuggling in his
bed and kissing him on the mouth (when permitted). He follows him
about like a dog, with a queer shuffling gait, and shaking his tail from
side to side.
The plumage since his moult is beautiful, and of a rich mossy green
colour, and the red variations are brilliant. When the wings are spread,
the yellow area is quite conspicuous. I do not think the bird can fly
well, as when he flaps his wings one does not open as fully as the other,
but there is no suggestion of deformity when the wings are closed.
I should like to sell the bird, as the family will be away the greater
part of the summer, and I have other plans for the fall. I am offering
it at #40. Mr. Metzger of this city, also a member of the Aviculture
Society, is the only one I can give as a reference relative to the bird.
My identification is based on a comparison with the mounted specimen
in the Field Museum here, and from the detailed description in Ridgway's
Birds of North and Middle America.
Should you know of anyone who might be interested in this purchase,
I think I can arrange with Mr. Crandall of the New York Zoological
Park in forwarding it to London from New York.

A CHECKLIST OF AUSTRALIAN BIRDS

Sir, --The Council of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union
is desirous of specially bringing under the notice of its members the
new Checklist of the Birds of Australia, published last year. It represents
the untiring efforts of a committee during a period of about 10 years.
In addition to the scientific and vernacular names of the birds, it gives
direct references to the work of Gould, Mathews, and others, states the
range of each species, supplies lists of synonyms, and is furnished
with a very complete index. It also contains a lengthy article by Mr. H.
Wolstenholme on the derivations and pronunciations of the scientific
names, which adds greatly to the value and interest of the List.
Owing to the great amount of matter and the numerous references
the list contains and the high cost of printing, production of the List has
involved an expenditure of more than #400, and therefore it could
not be made a part of, or supplement to the Emu. The price of the
List has been fixed at 12s. 6 d., and each member of the Union is
requested to purchase a copy in order to meet the cost of printing.
A copy will be sent forthwith to any member who forwards 12s. 6 d.

death, while I have been abroad, of my Indian Adjutant under rather
unusual circumstances. He withstood the cold of a Norfolk winter
remarkably well, being out almost every day, walking about in a large
yard, which was also tenanted by a pair of Vulturine Guineafowls.
Although perfectly friendly with one of the Guineafowls, the Adjutant
had always looked with hatred on the other one, and at the least

a shaking. I suppose it was very stupid of me not to have removed
them, but I thought they would be able to take care of themselves as
they had plenty of room. However, while I was away a tragedy
happened ! The Stork seized the hated Yulturine, and killed it, and
then swallowed quantities of its feathers, so much so that they
apparently formed a kind of wad inside him, and he was not able to
digest his own food of rats and fish, though continuing to feed as
greedily as ever. My man tells me that for a week after he had killed
the Guineafowl, he kept on feeding, the undigested meat inside him
smelling horribly, but eventually it killed him. A real loss, as he was
such an entertaining bird, and a loss which could easily have been
avoided. The weather here is dreadfully damp and cold at present
(11th April), still Giant Kingfishers have eggs, and Alpine Choughs
are busy carrying vast quantities of nesting materials into a barrel,
while Crested Australian Doves have already reared one brood. The
cock Rheas are booming loudly, much earlier than usual.

Sir, --At last I have discovered a use for the aspidistra, that bane
of the middle-class parlour. I don't know whether the majority of
readers know that all the large weavers of the genus Hyphantornis,
Sitagra, etc., only build their nests of long strips of palm leaves, etc.,
which they tear from the tree. They cut a small incision at the base
of the leaf, then holding a piece of the leaf above the cut firmly in their
beaks they fly away, thus tearing a long narrow strip from the leaf.
With this they make their wonderful hanging nests. Dry grass, leaves,
etc., are never used, being far too brittle, the green leaf being pliable
and yet very tough. In captivity the birds use hay, etc., but they never
use this very readily, neither do they build nests as perfect as when
in the wild state.

some rare Weavers that I had had for a year or more, and, though the
birds had been in a large outdoor aviary all the summer, they had

By the Marquess of Tavistock
The plate of a new race of Barnard's Parrakeet which Mr. G.
Mathews has named after my wife, Barnardius crommelince, has been
done from a female bird imported by Mr. Frost some years ago and at
present living in my collection. The locality where it was captured
appears unknown.
Barnardius crommelince differs from the ordinary form in its wholly
green breast. There is only a small patch of yellow on each side of
the neck in place of the almost complete half-collar and the general
shade of the plumage is a very pronounced blue- green.
[The following note on this bird, by Mr. Gregory M. Mathews,
appeared in the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club of 4th
November, 1925 (vol. xlvi, p. 21) :---
" While inspecting the aviaries of the Marquess of Tavistock, I was
struck by the appearance of a Barnardius somewhat like Barnardius
barnardii Vigors and Horsfield, but noticeably without the yellow band
on the lower breast--which, in my opinion, is a new species.
It is as large as barnardii and richly coloured, with an abundance
of blue, the cheeks being only less blue than in whitei ; entire breast

blue-green ; the yellow collar only faintly indicated by a small yellow
patch on each side of the neck ; crown of the head pale green ; a dark
Y-shaped mark of dull blue-green at the back of the head ; red frontal
band well developed. The bird is an adult female.

Mr. Chapman is to be congratulated on having at length succeeded
in importing several pairs of the very fine Masked Lovebird (Agapornis
personata) from Tanganyika Territory. It is perhaps the most striking
of the group, and, so far as I am aware, has never previously been offered
for sale in this country, if indeed in Europe. The only specimens
that have previously reached this country were three that Mr. Painter
brought through London on his way to the United States in 1925,
as recorded in this journal for June of that year.
This species, in which the sexes are alike in colour, has the face
blackish brown, a very broad collar on the nape and breast of yellow,
the upper breast reddish orange, the wings, back and under parts
green, and the upper tail-coverts ultramarine blue. The bill is bright
red and there is a conspicuous ring of whitish skin round the eye.
Mr. Painter had no difficulty in breeding those he took to America,
and there is little doubt that this species will prove to be a good breeder
like the Black-cheeked and Nyasa Lovebirds.
Mr. Chapman's Tanganyika consignment contained a few other
birds, two of which were new to Aviculture, namely the Blue-headed
Waxbill ( Urceginthus cyanocephalus) , which may be described as a Cordon
Bleu with a red bill and the blue extending over most of the head.
And the Buff-crowned Whydah (Linura fischeri) , a small and very&quot;
dark-coloured Whydah with a distinct huffish crown.

* (Continued from p. 136)
Ag-apoSis tar ant a
The Abyssinian Lovebird has never been very popular with avi-
culturists, probably because it is considered quarrelsome and very
disinclined to reproduce its kind. Although it had been described
nearly a hundred years previously, it was unknown in the living state
in England until the late Mr. H. D. Astley brought a pair from Italy
in July, 1909 . This pair was given to him by a lady who apparently
thought them quite common ; they were part of a small consignment
which reached Genoa in November, 1908 . A few had been imported
into Germany two years before, but had gone to the aviaries of an
Austrian enthusiast. Mr. Astley's pair formed the subject of a plate
in the Avicultural Magazine, Third Series, VoL I, No. 1 . Abyssinians
remained scarce until 1923 , when they started to come over in fairly
large numbers, and are now readily obtainable. The mortality in
newly-imported birds is very heavy; they usually arrive in a very poor
state, crowded in filthy cages, and it is little wonder that disease is
rampant. In many cases they are entirely devoid of feathers on the
head. I once had the misfortune to see the survivors of a very large
collection : they were all in an exceptionally bad way and died in
dozens during the few days following their arrival in England from
enteritis and kindred troubles. In this case cocks and hens alike
were absolutely bald, in addition they had developed cannibalistic
tendencies. It is common for the cocks to nibble and pluck the crimson
feathers from the foreheads of each other, but these had long passed
that state, and when a bird fell from a perch through weakness, several
would immediately attack the unfortunate, and after putting it out
of its misery, eat the major portion of its head. Fortunately birds
imported direct by the English dealers do not arrive in such a shocking
state, but only the birds from Continental dealers, who are not as
particular as the majority of our importers. If newly-imported birds
are obtained they should be kept moderately warm and given soaked
millet and canary seed for a week or so, they can then be accustomed

to the staple diet of canary seed, white millet, oats and white sun-
flower, the last named they are especially fond of. Their water for
the first few days should be slightly tepid. If the plumage is very soiled
they may be sprayed with lukewarm water after they have had time
to settle down provided they are kept warm and given an opportunity
to dry thoroughly before dark. They should not be put outdoors
until the beginning of May, unless the weather is exceptional. They
will settle down very rapidly and are very hardy. A dry draught-proof
shelter is absolutely essential, as A. taranta , in common with all the
other members of the family, cannot stand draughts or damp. The
Abyssinian is the largest of the group, but is not very active and rather
shy. They have rather pretty notes, sometimes resembling Peach-faced
Lovebirds, and sometimes the cock has quite a twitter, after the fashion
of the Bengalese. No difficulty is experienced in sexing this species,
as the cock has a cap of the richest crimson, which is wholly absent
in the hen. Nevertheless, breeding successes recorded in England
are few, but several have been reported abroad. The late Mr. Astley
stood a very good chance of being successful with his original pair,
as contrary to general experience they showed signs of desiring to
nest almost immediately after their arrival. Unfortunately the cock
was unable to climb out of an exceptionally deep nest-box, which he
had been exploring ; he was not missed for several days, and it was
then too late. The unmated hen laid eggs the following year. In
1925 Mr. W. Lewis claimed to be the first to succeed in Great Britain.
The old birds took to a husk towards the end of June and laid four
eggs, which they duly hatched, but only reared two young, which were
like the hen when Mr. Lewis disposed of them at three months old.
Incubation was thought to take sixteen days. Soon after Mr. Lewis
had made known his success, Mr. Alfred G. Groves, of Bath, claimed
priority. In response to a request by the Editor for particulars,
Mr. Groves wrote as follows : " The Abyssinian Lovebird bred last
year left the nest the second week in June. The parents came from the
late Mrs. Dalton Burgess' collection. Three eggs were laid, but only
one was fertile and the youngster remained in the nest for a long
period " (A.M., Fourth Series, Yol. IV, p. 190). So it would seem that
the honour of being first goes to Mr. Groves. In both cases details

are very meagre, but an excellent account appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine, June, 1926, to which members should refer. The account
in question is a translation from the German publication " A.Z." and
concerns the experiences of Herr Ed. Schiitze. The following extracts
are for the benefit of new members who may not possess this number :
" The hen appeared to be incubating at the end of January, 1925.
An inspection on 17th February showed three almost round eggs,
by the 23rd two young had hatched, the third egg being fertile. Size
of eggs 23&amp;apos; 18 mm. Incubation period about eighteen days. The
hen alone fed the young for about the first week. The young were
almost feathered by 16th March, looked out of the box for the first
time on the 19th, and the first left the nest on the 29th, the second,
four days later. Both resembled the female, except the red of the
beak was paler ; both proved to be females. On 9th April the young
began to feed themselves, but were still fed by their parents; 27th April,
young independent, though still fed occasionally until 4th May. For
the first few weeks the young birds were given soft food, containing
ants' eggs and hard-boiled egg ; on this food they thrived and later took
to eating seed, especially millet. A very interesting point observed was
that these birds built no nest as other Lovebirds do, but the female
plucked the feathers from her breast with which to form a nest founda-
tion." This was not the first occasion on which Abyssinians had been
bred on the Continent as Neunzig (p. 715) writes : " In 1906 some were
imported by an Italian dealer and came into the possession of an
Austrian aviculturist. They bred, two young were hatched, which were
fully coloured at ten months old. In another brood three young were
hatched." Another account of the successful rearing of this species,
but this time in America in the aviaries of Mrs. J. Bamfields, of Los
Angeles, appeared in the Avicultural Magazine of August, 1926.
" In 1925, four eggs were laid, but only one youngster reared to maturity.
In 1926 four eggs laid, three hatched, two young reared. The eggs were
laid on a nest made of pieces of paper and canvas which they pulled
off the front protection of their cage. This pair is in an aviary with
some Softbills, and Mrs. Bamfields reports that they partake greedily
of the mealworms and gentles intended for the other birds, and believes
that her success is partly due to this insect food." It will be noted that

both Herr Schiitze and Mrs. Bamfields provided insect food and both
have been successful, so it would seem that this species benefits by
the provision of a good insectivorous mixture. In the wild state the
Abyssinian is said to make use of the nest of a species of Weaver, in
the same way as the Peach-faced is said to use the nest of the Sociable
Weaver bird. As regards its life in the wild, Heuglin says (Ornithologie
Nord-Ost Africas , pp. 747-8) : " It usually lives in families of three to
eight individuals, most abundantly in the so-called Woma-Dega
(7,000 ft. above sea-level), yet it descends to the lowest limits
of the Abyssinian olive-tree and the Qolqual Euphorbia, and in
Semien and Wogara we still met little parties at 9-10,000 ft.
altitude. The isolated companies lead a tolerably independent
life, but keep close together among themselves. They affect the
crowns of the higher trees, especially of Juniperus and the Chandelier
Euphorbise; at the season of the ripening of the fruits of the
Cordias and Sycamores they also settle upon them. The call-note
consists of a shrill, at times chattering, chirp, very like Agapornis
pullaria. The males when in flight often utter a sharp pfiff. The flight
itself is usually high, straight and humming ; these birds also climb
with great facility." Heuglin thinks the pairing season must be at
midsummer.
Abyssinans are given a very bad name as regards their quarrel-
someness, but they agree fairly well with other members of the genus ;
Softbills they ignore, but it is not safe to associate them with small
Finches, etc., especially at breeding time. Two pairs of Abyssinians
should on no account be kept in the same aviary unless it is of very
exceptional size.

the recent daily papers, and possibly some wondered to what bird this
referred. The following extracts are taken from Newton's Dictionary
of Birds and throw some light on the matter :--
" Honey-guide 5 a bird so called from its habit or supposed habit of
pointing out to man and to the ratel (Mellivora capensis) the nests of
bees. . . . Yet Mr. Layard says ( B. S. Africa , p. 242) that the birds
will not unfrequently lead anyone to a leopard or a snake, and will
follow a dog with vociferations, 1 so that at present judgment may
perhaps be suspended on the matter, though its antics and noisy cry
unquestionably have in many cases the effect signified by its English
name. If not its first discoverer, Sparrman, in 1777, was the first
who described and figured this bird, which he met with in the Cape
Colony, giving it the name of Cuculus indicator , its feet with the toes
placed in pairs--two before and two behind--inducing the belief
that it must be referred to that genus. Vieillot in 1816 elevated it to
the rank of a genus, Indicator ; but it was still considered to belong to
the Family Cuculidm (its asserted parasitical habits lending force to
that belief) by all systematists except Blyth and Jerdon, until it was
shown by Mr. Blanford and Mr. Sclater that it was more allied to the
Capitonidce (Barbet) and, in consequence, was then made the type of
a distinct Family, Indicatoridce. ... In the meanwhile other species had
been discovered, some of them differing sufficiently to warrant
Sundevall's foundation of a second genus, Prodotiscus , of the group.
The Honey-guides are small birds, the largest hardly exceeding a Lark
in size, and of plain plumage, with what appears to be a very Sparrow-
like bill. Captain Shelley in 1891 (Cat. B. Br. Mus xix, pp. 1-12)
recognized nine species and one sub-species of the genus Indicator ,
and two of Prodotiscus. Four of the former, including I. sparrmani,
which was the first made known, are found in South Africa, and one
of Prodotiscus . The rest inhabit other parts of the same continent,
except I. archipelagicus , which belongs to Borneo and Malacca, and
L xanthonotus , which occurs on the Himalayas from the borders of
Afghanistan to Bhotan. The interrupted geographical distribution
of this genus is an instructive fact."
1 This is also a well-known habit with some Corvid*, the Jays and Pies for
example.

A possible explanation of the antics of the Honey-guide is given
by a correspondent in the Daily Mail, who writes, " A honey-bird will
lure a man to a tree where there is a snake because the snake is in the
vicinity of its nest. My brother had an experience of this sort. A
honeybird led him to a tree and fluttered round the stem where a
snake was coiled. My brother shot the snake, and the honey-bird
cheerfully settled on its nest."
Perhaps some member who has had personal experience with this
genus would give his observations.

If it had not been for a shower of rain William and I would not have
met, which would have been William's loss. I will explain. Wandering
one day in the Bush, in search of new birds, I encountered a shower
(they are called showers in that part of the world where 4 inches
of rain in an hour is no uncommon thing, but in England it would
have been called a torrential downpour). So not wishing to retrace
my steps 7 miles in a soaking condition and swim a swollen river
I sought shelter for the night at the homestead of a friend a few miles
away. When the ever-welcome pot of tea was brought in by a dusky
chef, a small feathered creature dropped on to the floor from somewhere
out of the said gentleman's attire and protested forcibly as it hopped
across the floor. This was William. There was a general scramble,
and I caught him first ; then the dusky " gentleman " protested--the
bird was the only titbit for the evening to augment the monotony of the
usual mealie pap--but as possession is nine points of the law as they say,
I stuck to William and he spent the night under a wire meat cover
and was regaled with a diet of flies mixed with golden syrup. That
was how William and I met.
Now the reason that I stuck to William was--because he was a very
rare bird, far from common even in his native haunts. His other name
was the Yellow-throated Honey-guide, his proper name Indicator
major.

He was carried to his future home in a cardboard box, but owing
to the humidity at that time of the year the box went to pulp and he
got lost several times.
He proved to be the most charming pet I have ever had in the
tropics. In a few days he was perfectly tame and would follow one about
or sit near one in the garden sunning himself or uttering the strange
querulous cry which birds of the genus Indicator utter when trying
to attract the attention of a traveller to a bee's nest.
In colour he was dark moss-green above, the lesser wing-coverts
having a golden green w T ash, a broad stripe from the middle of the rump
through the upper tail-coverts primrose yellow, the three outer tail
feathers the same yellow tipped with dark green ; the whole under
parts primrose yellow except the throat, which was golden yellow ;
there was a broad ring of naked blue grey skin round the eye ; the eyes
dark brown ; the feet which are zygodactyl are greyish blue.
The Honey-guides, only three species of which I have studied
in their native haunts, the Sparrman's Honey-guide in Mozambique,
the Scaly-throated in Gazaland, and the present species in Mashona-
land, are quiet and unobtrusive birds, living in the thickly-wooded
Bush and seldom obtruding themselves upon one's notice unless there
is a bees' nest in the vicinity ; then matters are reversed, and upon the
sight of a human being, either black or white, the bird gets into a great-
state of excitement, flying round within a few yards and uttering its
curiously loud cry ; if it sees that one intends to follow, the bird will
fly from tree to tree a few yards ahead of one until it eventually reaches
the nest. When it does actually reach the nest it utters an entirely
different cry to the one which it has been uttering whilst it has been
leading one on.
It is always the custom to leave a portion of the comb for the bird
as a payment for its services. The natives have a superstition that if
one does not leave anything for the bird, the next time they follow
a Honey-guide it will lead them to a poisonous snake. It is a fact
that these birds do lead human beings to snakes as several of my friends
have proved, but this is done no doubt with the object of getting someone
to kill the snake, for undoubtedly these birds possess a large share of
intelligence, as I proved by my pet.

To get back to William, the native who caugbt him said that if
ever a Honey-guide drinks water it gets intoxicated and be found
tbis bird " drunk " on tbe pathway leading to tbe native store. I tbink
that tbis nigger must have belonged to tbe local branch of the
R.S.P.C.A., for instead of breaking tbe bird's wings and legs as tbe
natives always do whenever they find a bird (I have known natives
to catch birds and treat them thus, leaving them all day in tbe boiling
sun so that they would be fresh for tbe evening's meal, cruelty being
inherent to tbe African nigger), tbis fellow only cut its wing feathers off.
William bad an insatiable appetite. I am sure that be ate several
times bis own weight in a week, even if tbe last grub was banging
out of bis mouth, because there was no more room inside, he would
call for more. We fed him on all manner of soft insects and honeycomb.
Tbis is a very easy matter in a country where insects abound and wild
bees' nests are found everywhere. But bard insects and artificial
food be would not touch.
There is a certain kind of hornet in tbe tropics which is a great
asset to the amateur bird keeper. It builds large mud nests on the walls
of rooms, usually preferring the kitchen where it is extra warm. These
nests consist of from one to thirty compartments, the hornet lays
an egg in each one and then stuffs it full of green caterpillars or large
spiders, which it renders in a state of suspended animation by the
injection of some subtle preservative, and as the hornets are continually
building these wonderful nests, there is provided a never-ending supply
of food, and upon the contents of these nests William was regaled.
If the egg in the hornet's nest had hatched and the insects were eaten
there was a huge juicy grub in their place which was relished even more
than the insects.
William would follow after one anywhere if he were hungry and
several times he was lost in a banana plantation, but upon being
called he soon disclosed his whereabouts by uttering his strange cry.
He was frightfully inquisitive, prying into every dark nook and
corner, and if a newspaper was lying on the floor he would get under-
neath it and come out at the other side. He liked to roost in some
dark corner on the floor, usually under a chest of drawers. His favourite
perch was on my foot, and once comfortably settled there he would

I was hoping to bring him home to England, but as I had to make
a detour of over two thousand miles because of a railway bridge being
washed away, I found this absolutely impracticable owing to the
impossibility of getting live food for a week's train journey, so I left
him with a friend whom I knew would take care of him. Perhaps it
was a good thing that he didn't come to this land of sunless grey skies

A few of these beautiful Weavers were brought down from the
interior of Tanganyika Territory in Central Africa by my friend
Mr. Schulz, and given to me in the spring of last year at Antwerp.
I have never heard of their being imported before, and there is
very little likelihood of their ever having been brought to Europe
before, for they are rare even in the very remote part where they
come from, and as notes on rarely imported birds are asked for I
venture to send these very meagre ones.
The Beichenow's Weaver is rather a large bird, and at first sight
might be mistaken for a small Oriole, and this is accentuated by the
fact that the beak is not at all Weaverlike, being thin, long, tapering
and glossy black.
The birds were caught on a volcano where Mr. Schulz makes his
African home. In size they are rather larger than the Black-headed
Weaver (Hyphantornis nigricejps), but more slender in build.
They made delightful aviary birds, exceedingly active and cheerful
in demeanour, also very tame and confiding, always ready to take
mealworms from out of one's hand even though they were in a large
outdoor aviary.

These Weavers are mainly insectivorous in a state of freedom, and
eat very little seed. On board the ship they killed and partly ate
several of the rare Black-thighed Weavers that were confined to the
same cage ; they also plucked all the yellow feathers from out of the
cock birds, and greedily devoured minced raw meat which was put
into the cage for other birds. In captivity they eat a great deal of
soft food and many mealworms.
In the aviary they spent most of their time searching the bushes
and the ground for insects and weaving, but they never made a perfect
nest. They moulted out into perfect specimens, but alas ! they were
killed at the end of the summer by the wretched cats chasing them
on the aviary at night.
In colour the Reich enow's Weaver is bright golden yellow on the
whole of the lower parts, somewhat greener on the flanks, the feathers
having a remarkable satin-like texture in the living bird, the upper
parts jet black, the lower back and tail olive green, the wings marked
with olive yellow ; the iris is white, which gives the bird a very cruel
expression, as indeed it deserves. There seems to be a seasonal change
in which the front half of the head changes to golden yellow.
I hope to receive some more of these birds later this year.
The Black-thighed Weaver (Pyromelana capensis
xanthomelaena)
This very pretty little Weaver seems to have been seldom if ever
imported, though it may have been confused with its very near ally,
the better-known Cape Black and Yellow Weaver ( P . capensis), a
bird that it closely resembles and which it replaces north of the Limpopo
River in South Africa. When in breeding plumage the male is velvety
black all over except the shoulders and lesser wing-coverts, which are
bright yellow, and a broad band on the lower back which is brilliant
golden yellow; the feathers are elongated and cover the wings in
repose ; there is also an irregular line of white in the centre of the
abdomen; the legs are black, also the upper mandible, the lower one
is white. The hen is much smaller than the cock, and is the usual
streaky brown with no trace of yellow. I bought my birds on the

Island of Mozambique on the East African coast. I bought them with
twenty other birds for the sum of 6s., including the cage !
These Weavers are very conspicuous objects in the landscape in
the regions where they live owing to their brilliant coloration and
comparative tameness, though they cannot be called common. In
the breeding season each male takes possession of a certain area, either
part of a reed bed or one of the huge anthills which are covered by
a dense tangle of tropical vegetation composed of thorn bush, reeds,
asparagus fern, etc., but always in the vicinity of water. Here he reigns
as a little king with his harem, chasing any other bird of the same or
allied species from the immediate neighbourhood.
When in full plumage the male has a very peculiar " slow motion 55
flight. He first puffs out his feathers until he resembles a black and
golden ball and appears to be twice his real size, and then sails with a
strange jerky motion very slowly from bush to bush, and upon alighting
each time utters his harsh rasping song. He is usually so engrossed
with his performance that he takes very little notice of human beings.
Although the males are so much in evidence the females are very
seldom seen, for upon one&amp;apos;s approach they slip away quietly into the
dense undergrowth, the male meanwhile chasing first one and then the
other.
These birds feed upon the seeds of weeds, grasses, etc., and also
small insects.
The nest is like that of the Scarlet Weaver, a most beautifully
woven structure of fine texture, attached to several reed stems. The
eggs, five in number, are pale blue.
Out of the breeding season, a few join flocks of other Weavers&amp;apos;when
they can at once be distinguished from the others by the yellow lower
back and wing-coverts, this colour being retained all the year round.
The majority of the birds, however, do not wander very far from their
breeding haunts.
These Weavers are quite charming birds in captivity, lively and
vivacious, singing the whole day long their rather harsh and rasping
song.
They are wonderful nest builders, having constructed many perfect
nests exactly resembling those built in the wild state, and if I had only

left them long enough in my outdoor aviary doubtless they would have
nested, but I was compelled to take them indoors for the following
reason : morning after morning to my great chagrin I found the
bodies of my beautiful Weavers stiff and cold on the ground, first one
and then another, all apparently in perfect health and feather, and
I only discovered the reason when three out of my twelve birds were
left: it was that arch-enemy of all bird keepers, cats. The brutes had
climbed over the aviary all the night, causing the birds in their fright to
batter themselves against the wires. The more the birds fluttered
the more the cats chased them ; but this year I have a sure remedy--
arsenic and kippers !
Indoors the birds still continued to build, and at the present moment
the remaining hen and two cocks are still building perfect nests.

By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
Aviculturists may be able to give us some light on this subject,
since by breeding from abnormal birds they often throw light on the
heredity or otherwise of variations. Their experiments have often
shown that a sudden variation or " mutation " is either inherited
completely or not at all; this is the case, for instance, with the black-
winged form of the Peacock when crossed with the common type, and
the young bird bred at the Zoo from a Zebra Curassow (Crax globicera.
feminine mutation Inecki) and a typical Globose Curassow cock was an
ordinary Globose Curassow hen, figured by our Editor with its female
parent in the Avicultural Magazine years ago.
Yet yellow Budgerigars appear to owe their present far too strong
tinge of green and too pronounced markings to crossing with greens,
and I can well remember when Silver Sebright Bantams, as described
in Wright's Poultry Book a generation ago, had become straw-coloured
by crossing with the golds, though the first crossing of golds and silvers
reproduces the original colours truly, and true silvers have long ago
been re-bred and are now common.
Moreover, I believe that I can see in some of the present light blue
Buderigars a tinge of green, and this mutation can be better likened to

a wild form than can the yellow, for the light blue Budgerigar corre-
sponds to the green very much as the Indian Grey Tit ( Parus major
cinereus) does to our Great Tit ( Parus major), the yellow element in
the plumage being eliminated in the Indian bird.
Do we know, moreover, that such mutations as the new and
interesting Dark Common Pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus, mutation
obscurus Hachisuka), of which latter a nice pen are now exhibited at the
Zoo, will not ultimately produce intermediate forms if persistently
bred back to the typical birds ?
If they did, we could envisage the production of sub-species as
follows : First the type produces a mutation, which, if isolated or
possessing some advantage of constitution, character, or adaptation
to surroundings, becomes a constant local form. Then it breeds back,
through some extension of range, locally to the type, and intermediates
arise, all such intermediates being, as we know them to be in the case
of our common British Pheasants, in the case of which imported sub-
species have been crossed in, of hybrid nature..
If this be ever recognized and proved as a fact, it will reduce sub-
species to the level of full-species hybrids, and render it as unnecessary
to load our museums with series of sub-specific forms as it would be
now considered unnecessary to fill them with avicultural full-species-
hybrids, albimistic varieties, etc.
It may be argued that what I have been saying only concerns
colour-forms, which are not now--and rightly in my opinion--regarded
as full species ; but one gets the same intergradation where structure
is concerned, as between the common Reed-Bunting ( Emberiza
schoeniclus) and the large pale Bullfinch-billed Reed-Bunting of Central
Asia, which Sharpe actually put into a distinct genus, Pyrrhulorhyncha..
He also separated the Flightless Moorhen of Tristan da Cunha as a
genus (Porphyriornis) from the common Moorhen, though it chiefly
differs in reduced wings and stronger and yellow-coloured feet.
Here also we can find a parallel in domestic birds. If anyone goes
to one of our great poultry shows and looks at the Fawn Runner Ducks,
which are the truest representatives of the Penguin Ducks studied
by Darwin, it will be seen that these birds differ from Mallard in much
the same way as the Flightless Moorhen does from our bird. They

are shorter-winged and longer and stronger-legged, and although not
so true to type as wild birds, they certainly have evolved incidental
differences in coloration. The Drake is like a Mallard with subdued
colours, dark olive bill, olive-orange legs, deep bottle-green head,
dull grey body, dull wing-bar, the white neck collar reduced or
absent, and the chocolate breast-patch paler and less well defined.
The Ducks are usually warm fawn, with a bronze wing-bar instead of
blue, black bills and pure olive feet, and the black markings of the
plumage reduced to small longitudinal streaks even on the upper parts.
Most interesting is the fact that the Drakes not unfrequently,
even when having only a small white collar or none, have white wing-
coverts like Wigeon, and that such white wing-coverts occasionally
appear in the Ducks.
Altogether these birds, although a domestic race, look remarkably
like a full wild species evolved by isolation where flight and swimming
were both at a discount. Yet if they did exist as wild birds--as some
fanciers actually imagine--and an invasion of Mallard took place
in their home, interbreeding would no doubt occur and sub-specific
forms would arise.
I do not mean to imply that the structural points of the Flightless
Moorhen and Bullfinch-billed Reed-Bunting arose by sudden mutation,
any more than Mallard parents could suddenly produce Fawn Runner
offspring complete in all points--though I have seen a Mallard Duck
in Regent's Park with the Runner carriage ; the structural peculiarities
of such birds have no doubt arisen by the adding up of such small
variations as we know to occur by natural selection (the Runner Duck,
no doubt, was not deliberately bred to the shape it shows, poultry
being usually compelled to forage for themselves in the East). The
coloration of such structurally different races often does not differ
much from that of the type, and has no doubt arisen incidentally by
being correlated with successful structural or constitutional variations.
Yet when structurally different forms of recent common origin meet,
we can see that they interbreed just as colour-mutations do, as in the
case of the Kaleege Pheasants.
In Assam, we have the Purple Kaleege (Gennceus horsfieldi) evidently
a melanistic male mutant from the Lineated Kaleege of Burma (G.

lineatus) with, its grizzled back and streaked breast. These species
are prick-crested and hen-tailed, but China has evolved the well-known
large, drooping-crested, long-tailed, white-backed Silver Pheasant
(G. nychthemerus) which certainly would not have arisen suddenly in its
complete form from the Lineated. Yet it interbreeds both with this and
with the Purple where they meet--though about thirty species were
once made of the hybrids, of which some (of the Purple-Silver cross) are
not even alike on the two sides of the body.
To be developed as distinctly as it is, the Silver Pheasant must,
in its infancy as a species, have been isolated from its fellows for a
considerable period ; while extension of range has apparently brought
them together again, producing hybrid sub-species.
If this view be correct, all sub-species are simply mongrels ; and
full species are those forms which have been so long isolated as to have
developed a dislike to mating with their relatives when by some cause
they are brought into contact. This is evidently the case with the
Golden and Amherst Pheasants (Chrysolophus pictus and C. amherstice)
which do not interbreed when wild, or even, though living in the same
country, haunt the same localities, being indeed enemies; yet
aviculture has shown us that they will produce completely fertile
hybrid offspring. Indeed, a captive sub-species has been developed,
for most Amherst cocks nowadays show a touch of Gold blood, though
this comes out, curiously enough, in an excess of red, not of yellow,
in the plumage, as well as in the breaking up of the black tail-bars.
How, then, does one recognize a true or full species ? I think
Wallace's definition--one that differs from another in more than one
point--is very near the truth, but not quite exact, for intermediate
forms may exist between two of such, as we see in the case of the
Kaleege Pheasants.
The decisive points must apparently be at least three, as we see
in the case of the Buffed ( Chrysolophus ) Pheasants, which differ in
colour, structure of ornamental plumage, feathering of face, and note,
and have ceased to regard each other as kindred in the wild, though
they will mate when man pairs them, and still produce, as I have said,
quite fertile offspring.

By G. H. Gurney, F.Z.S.
The diurnal Birds of Prey (Falconiformes) are divided into two
sub-orders, the Cathartse and the Accipitres. The former contains the
New World Vultures (Cathartidse) with its sub-family Polyborinse
(Carrion Hawks) ; the latter the Secretary Bird (Serpentaridse), the
Old World Vultures (Vulturidse), the Carrion Hawks, Hawks, Eagles,
Falcons and their allies (Falconidse) and the Ospreys (Pandionidse). The
Accipitres alone consist of nearly four hundred different species.
Although the Raptores are not nearly so often kept in aviaries as many
other species, still probably from their use in hawking, they were some
of the earliest birds to be kept in confinement. Possibly also their some-
what sombre colouring, and their general reluctance to breed, may also
account for the fact, that but few aviculturists go in for them, or it
may be the difficulty of providing animal food for them, or again
their reputed fierceness and untameable natures may be the reason ;
and yet they are an extremely interesting group, and if properly under-
stood, are generally easy birds to feed and cater for. Many of them
stand confinement extremely well, and live to a great age, whilst many
are perfectly hardy, and will become very tame, and as those who do
keep them will know, possess a charm and interest quite different
from any other class of birds.
It is quite impossible in a short article of this description to describe
all the various species which have been kept in confinement: I can only
give a short account of those which are more commonly seen, with a
very brief description of their plumage. Owing to there being but a
small demand for them, no numbers of any one species are imported,
odd examples of all kinds of different sorts, many of them very scarce,
arrive at the dealers, and may or may not be sold.
In this article I propose to describe (1) -suitable aviaries, (2) food,
(3) species which have been kept in captivity.
Aviaries
No Birds of Prey of any kind are suitable for cages, they must be
housed in aviaries. It is quite a mistake to suppose that they are
all hardy ; like all birds they will become acclimatized, and very many-

will stand any amount of cold, but the smaller tropical and sub-tropical
species are often very delicate and must be treated accordingly. To
begin with, the aviary must be (for all species) in a sheltered place,
if possible facing south ; it is nearly always useless to have an open
flight, with an elaborate heated house, as very few Hawks will go into
such a shelter of their own accord. The aviary should be open only in
front, and boarded at the sides, back, and over the greater part of the
top ; for the more delicate species, the whole of the top may be boarded
and a glass front, covered on the inside with wire netting, fixed to the
front of the aviary in the winter time. The size of the aviary must
depend a good deal on the bird it is to hold, but personally I am in
favour of large aviaries for the Birds of Prey : certainly for the bigger
Vultures and Eagles they can hardly be too large, though I must admit
I have seen large Hawks (Buzzards and Kites) kept in quite small places,
and looking the picture of health.
The perches should be placed well apart and at some distance from
the ground, so that the bird must use his wings to get from one to the
other. They should be of good strong wood, of different thickness,
and I find pieces of cork bark nailed round the perches in separate
places very much appreciated by the birds for standing on. A large
steady block of wood, a couple of feet high, let firmly into the floor
of the aviary is also much liked. It is a great mistake to
overcrowd an aviary with perches, but there should always be one at
the back, where the bird will get the most shelter. As regards the floor
of the flight, it may be covered with sand, but I much prefer the natural
earth : in some of my Hawk's aviaries half of the floor is of bricks,
which are certainly easier to clean, and as these birds do not spend
much time on the ground, it does not appear in any way to affect
their feet.
In an aviary of this description most species of Kaptores, with the
exception of the Secretary Bird, and the smaller and more delicate
tropical species, may be kept throughout the year.
Food
The all-important question of food is often misunderstood in the
Birds of Prey. All my Hawks, except the small delicate ones, are starved
for one day in the week, and they are never given more food than they

G. H. Gurney--The Birds of Prey
can consume at a meal, all food left uneaten is removed. They are fed
once a day only. The best food is small birds, rats, mice and rabbits,
and for the larger vultures horse flesh, fowls' heads may also be
occasionally given. Whenever possible it is essential that fur and
feathers should be left on ; as a substitute for natural feathers, tow cut
up into small lengths and mixed with the meat may be used. This
plan is, or was, carried out at the Giza Zoological Gardens, and appeared
to answer very well, though I must say I have never tried it. Birds of
Prey are always lethargic in confinement and if they are to be kept
really well and in perfect condition, the different forms of food for
the various species cannot be too closely considered. It is often
supposed that all a Hawk requires is a large hunk of flesh thrown
into its cage and left there until it is consumed. It is quite unnecessary,
as many people imagine, to feed Vultures on carrion ; they do perfectly
well on fresh meat, but the bones should be given with the meat.
The very small Hawks, tropical and otherwise, some not much larger
than Sparrows, are almost entirely fed on worms, beetles, moths, cock-
chafers, mealworms, and pieces of meat cut up very small; others
rather larger may be given small birds, mice, lizards, and small fish,
in fact many Hawks of all kinds delight in fish occasionally. The day
before I starve my birds I generally give them an extra feed, but not
always. Of course, when a bird is moulting he will require rather a
more liberal allowance of food, but by feeding as I have described,
the majority of Baptores may be kept perfectly well and fit.
As regards drinking and bathing, I have seen it stated that Hawks
never drink in confinement. This is incorrect. A pair of small Black-
winged Kites (Planus) I had were constantly drinking, and a Black
Vulture also occasionally did so. They are certainly not great drinkers
as a whole, but should always have easy access to a large pan of fresh
water, and the same applies to bathing. It is, as a rule, better to keep
the Birds of Prey in separate aviaries, even if they are the same species
(unless one is especially trying to breed them), one is often stronger than
the other, and will take all the food : I think they do better also if
apart. Vultures and possibly the Ki^tes, which have rather different
habits, may, however, be allowed to live together.
I will deal first with the New World Vultures.

Distinctive characteristic, bill strongly hooked, nostrils pervious,
claws clumsy and unfit for grasping. Head and neck bare, or covered
with thin down, sexes alike. The Condor (Sarcorhamphus gryphus ),
plumage black, with a ruff of white down round the neck, bare skin
on the head and neck a dull red. This magnificent species, one of the
largest of the Birds of Prey, is perfectly hardy in confinement, and lives
to a great age. It principally inhabits the great mountain ranges on
the Western Coast of South America. It is very seldom seen in private
collections. They are voracious, and somewhat stupid birds, and in a
wild state, when gorged after feeding, can be easily captured with a
lasso. This species has nested in captivity, incubation taking fifty-four
days, and a single specimen has been known to live for fifty-two years,
in confinement.

The Black Vulture (Catharistes atratus ), black with a slightly
brownish shade on the primaries. Occasionally imported, like all the
Vultures extremely hardy in captivity. It inhabits South America
where it is very common. An interesting account of the attempted
breeding of this species at the London Zoological Gardens is given
in the Avicultural Magazine for 1920, Vol. XI, p. 115.
The Turkey Buzzard (C. aura), black with a purple gloss, skin of

at the London Zoological Gardens. The only specimen I ever had did
not do well and soon died. A very common bird all over the South
American Continent. I have also kept the closely allied species

G. H. Gurney--The Birds of Prey
The Secretary Bird (Serpentarius Secretarius) has been imported
and kept in captivity from the very early days of aviculture. The
first specimen to reach Europe alive was in 1770 and many of the
early English menageries had specimens. The enclosure for a Secretary
Bird can hardly be too large, and in such a place, they will take a
great deal of exercise and keep themselves in good health ; the enclosure
should be surrounded by a wire fence at least 10 feet high, with a
large dry shed facing south, the floor of which should be well covered
with peat moss litter. Kept under these conditions they are generally
pretty hardy, and may be allowed out, except in the hardest weather.
They are tremendous feeders, and a diet of rabbits, given broken up,
but of course with the fur and bones, rats and small birds suits them
well, if given perfectly fresh, while they are very fond of hens' eggs.
I shall never forget the excitement of three Secretary Birds at the
Buda Pesth Zoo, when five large live snakes were turned into their
enclosure. They were promptly killed, but not immediately devoured-
These birds have not yet been bred in captivity, but I believe a nest
was made at the London Zoological Gardens more than once ; and
there appears to be no reason why they should not breed in a suitable
enclosure, under favourable conditions. The sexes are alike, except in
size, the male being somewhat the smaller. They inhabit Southern and

brown reflections, head covered with thick velvety down, the neck
is bare, of a livid flesh colour. Not infrequently kept in confinement,
and though eggs have been laid, the species has never been reared.
A specimen lived at Lilford for thirty-nine years. Its headquarters
are in the Mediterranean region, whence it extends into Africa and
as far east as China.

for considerably over twenty years in confinement. Young have also
been hatched in captivity. I have found it a dull heavy bird, and not
particularly attractive. It extends through Southern Europe and
North Africa as far as India, where it is replaced by the larger form
G. himalayensis.
Kolb's Vulture ( G . Jcolbi) and Kuepell's Vulture (G. ruepelli).
Both these species have occasionally been kept in confinement. A pair
of Kolb's Vultures nested at the London Zoological Gardens in
December, 1912. After incubation lasting for fifty-four days, the young
one was hatched, but was unfortunately devoured by its parents two
days later. They are found in West and South Africa.
The Bengal Vulture ( Pseudogyps bengalensis) is another closely
allied species, which has been kept at the London Zoological Gardens,
and in one or two private collections. It often makes an extraordinary
barking noise and becomes very tame. The lower part of the back
in adult specimens is white, remainder black.
Other species which have been imported from time to time include
the Pondicherry Vulture (Otogyps calvus), the Eared Vulture (0.
auricularis), and the Occipital Vulture (Lophogyps occipitalis).
The Egyptian Vulture ( Neophron percnopterus). White, primaries
black, naked head, and neck bright yellow. This is one of the smallest
of the Vultures, and has often been kept in captivity. Though some-
what of a morose disposition, I knew one which would come to the bars
of its cage to be scratched and was perfectly tame. This species requires
a day shed for winter. The two examples V have kept appeared to
feel cold rather considerably, and I do not consider it as hardy in
confinement as most of the other Vultures.
Hooded Brown Vulture ( N . monachus). Dark brown, tail black,
neck covered with thick down of a pale brown colour. This
South African species occasionally finds its way into European
Zoological Gardens, but I have no records of how long it has lived
in captivity.

G. H. Gurney--The Birds of Prey
Sub-family I. Gypcetince
Tail wedge-shaped, feet and bill blue grey. The Bearded Vulture
(Gypcetus barbatus). The magnificent Lammergier is greyish black,
with white streaks, top of the head white, pale brown lanceolate plumage
on the neck and lower parts. This species has been kept at Lilford,
at the London Zoological Gardens, and at Catton by my grandfather,
where one lived to a great age in a comparatively small aviary.
It is, however, very seldom imported. It inhabits mountainous
countries bordering the Mediterranean, and extends through Central
Asia to China, and is widely spread over Africa.
Sub-family II. Polyborince
Tarsi elongated and bare ; somewhat terrestrial. The Cara-Cara
(Polyborus tharsus), dull blackish-brown, w T ith whitish neck and breast,
crown of head crested, back and rump dark brown, with narrow white
cross bars, cere and bare space round the eye red. This species does
very well in confinement, becomes very tame, and lives to a great age,
one specimen having lived for over forty-one years in captivity.
They are frequently imported and inhabit the whole of South
America. The very similar species P. cheriway is also occasionally
to be obtained. These species walk and run with the greatest ease.
They have a very noticeable and peculiar habit of throwing their heads
right back and uttering a loud grating note, this is generally done
when they are excited or startled.
Brown Carrion Hawk ( Milvago chimango) . Rufous brown, tail
ashy grey, head and neck with black centres to the feathers, giving
a striped appearance, under surface brown, cere pale pink. Very
similar in habits to the two preceding species. These Carrion Hawks
are very fond of fish, and will also greedily devour large worms. Inhabits
the southern parts of the South American continent.
M. chima chima. Brown, head, neck, tail and under parts creamy
white, rectrices barred with brown. Like the preceding species, very
terrestrial in its habits, in a wild state frequenting grassy plains ; not

surface cream, face black. This species has been kept at Lilford,
at Knowsley, by myself, and in the London Zoological Gardens, but
unlike the majority of Eagles does not appear to be long lived in
captivity. It is very fond of fishes, snakes, and mine would also eat
frogs. Its range is very wide, inhabiting all the countries bordering
the Mediterranean and over a great part of Central Asia. An interesting
account of Spilornis cheela in captivity in India, by Mr. Stuart Baker,
appears in the Avicultural Magazine, Yol. V, p. 154, and a specimen
is living in the Paris Zoological Gardens, given by Monsieur Delacour.
Hen Harrier ( Circus cyemeus) . Adult male grey blue, rump and under
parts white ; adult female, above brown, beneath pale buff with dark
brown markings. This and the two following species are not infrequently
seen in captivity. Personally I have only kept the Marsh Harrier.
They are amongst the least desirable of the larger Birds of Prey, as
they never become used to confinement, and always knock themselves
about on the slightest provocation. They should, therefore, never be
kept in an open aviary.
Montague's Harrier (C. cineraceous).
Marsh Harrier (0. ceruginosus).
Three other species of Harrier have been imported, viz. Gould's
Harrier (C. gouldi) from New Zealand, Swainson's Harrier ( C . macurus)
inhabiting North Africa, India, etc., and the Moor Harrier (C. maurus)
from South Africa.
The Red-necked Hawk (Micrastur ruficollis). Brown or blackish
above, marked with grey and white, white below. I once kept a Red-
necked Hawk,- and a very nice bird it was. It was fed entirely on
Sparrows, and much preferred them to rats and mice. The species
has also been kept at the London Zoological Gardens, and one of the
London dealers had three beauties a year ago. It is found in Central
America.
The Many-zoned Hawk (Melierax polyzonus). Grey brown above,
primaries black, tail black and white. This very pretty Hawk is
sometimes imported. It lives in Abyssinia, in Ethiopia, and is rather
a delicate species.
The Chanting Hawk (M. canorus). This species is supposed to have
a mellow piping song or whistle, the only individual I ever knew was

always absolutely silent. Like the preceding species it comes from
Africa.
The One-streaked Hawk (Asturinula monogrammica ). Above dark
grey, primaries blackish, tipped with white, tail black, broadly tipped
with white, under parts ashy brown. An adult and an immature
bird lived for some time at the London Zoological Gardens in 1878.
It inhabits Western and North-Eastern Africa.
The Goshawk (Astur palumbarius). Above ashy brown, four dark
bands on the tail, which is tipped with white, below it is barred with brown
and white. Perhaps one of the most widely kept Baptores. It may
generally be seen at the London Zoological Gardens and becomes very
tame and quiet in captivity. Four other species of Goshawks (Astur)
have occasionally been imported, they include the Allied Goshawk
(A. approximans) from Australia, the Gambian Goshawk (A. tibialis)
from West Africa, the Tachiro Goshawk (A. tachiro) from South Africa,
and the White Goshawk (A. novce-hollandice) from Tasmania. The latter
is one of the most beautiful Hawks there is and a fine addition to any
collection. Pure white in colour, with black bill, yellow cere and legs,
and bright red iris, a wonderful combination of colour.
The Sparrow Hawk (Accipiter nisus). It is hardly necessary to give
a description of this well-known species, which extends throughout
Europe, North Africa, into Asia, north of the Himalayas. It is not a
desirable species for captivity, being always exceedingly wild and
fierce, and never becomes tame, even if taken when quite young from
the nest. Small birds are the only food on which this species will do
well in confinement.
The Black and White Sparrow Hawk (A. melanoleucus ) from South
Africa is a handsome black bird, which had been kept at the London
Zoological Gardens. The Pileated Sparrow Hawk (A. pileatus) and the
Bed-bellied Sparrow Hawk (A. rufiventris) have also been kept in con-
finement.
Sub-family IV. Aquilince
Tail nearly even. Feathers of the neck often lanceolate ; tarsus
generally feathered to the feet.

and upper breast brown, crest brown with black tips. I have twice
seen this bird in Continental Zoos, and it has been occasionally brought
to England. It has very long legs, and in a wild state haunts thick
forests near water. It is found in Central America.
The Harpy ( Thrasaetus harpyia). Upper parts black and grey,
tail with six black bars, under parts whitish grey. This splendid bird
has been kept rather frequently. One lived for many years at North-
repps in quite a small aviary, it was out in all weathers and appeared to
be perfectly hardy : it was in perfect condition when it died. It was fed
entirely on rabbits. Like the preceding species it inhabits Central and
the northern part of South America.
The Monkey Eating Eagle ( Pithecophaga jejferyi ). For an interesting
account of this fine forest Eagle see a paper by Mr. D. Seth-Smith
in the Ibis for 1910, vol. iv, p. 285.
The Bateleur Eagle ( Helotarsus ecaudatus). Black, back and tail
rich red brown, much crested, cere, lores and feet bright red. This
very conspicuous bird is often seen in confinement. It is one of the
mostly frequently imported of the Birds of Prey ; and by reason of
its distinctive colour will always command attention. Hardy, quiet,
and becoming very tame, it is one of the most attractive of the larger
Hawks.
One that was kept at Northrepps followed its owner about every-
where like a dog, and nothing pleased it more than to join the chickens
when they were being fed, and actually pick up the corn which was
being given to them. It would occasionally throw a grain of corn up
in the air in play, but it was never observed to swallow any. It never
attempted to molest the fowls in any way.
Another Bataleur that I knew had the same habit as a Cara-Cara
of throwing back its head, over its neck, and uttering a loud cry. A
specimen of this species lived for fifty-five years in confinement in
Amsterdam. The following species of Hawk Eagle (Spizaetus) have all
been kept in confinement occasionally, but they are rare and seldom
imported. They are fairly hardy, and do well on the same food, and
under the same conditions as most of the described species. The
Crowned Hawk Eagle ( Spizaetus coronatus ) inhabits South and West
Africa. The Martial Hawk Eagle (S. bellicosus), habitat South Africa;

Hawk Eagle (S. sphinx), habitat Ceylon ; the Malayan Hawk Eagle

orientalis), habitat Japan.
The Booted Eagle ( Nisaetus pennatus). Brown above with distinct
white patch on the shoulder, head, neck and under parts pale fawn,
much barred with brown. Legs much feathered. This pretty little
Eagle has been kept by a number of private aviculturists. A pair made
a large nest in one of the aviaries at Catton, but no eggs were laid. It
is found in South Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.
Bonelli's Eagle (N. fasciatus). Colouring very similar to the
preceding species, but without the white shoulder patch. This species
has been kept at the London Zoological Gardens and at Lilford. I have
never had it. In a wild state it is very fond of eating snakes. Its range
is much the same as the preceding species. It has lived for sixteen
years in confinement.

By the Editor
The new arrivals at the Zoological Gardens include a very beautiful
pair of Mot-mots from Trinidad presented by Miss Bvatt. The species
found on that island and Tobago, Momotus swainsoni, is somewhat
smaller than most of the mainland forms and more brilliantly coloured,
and is recognized by its rich chestnut undersurface which extends
to the throat.
The Mot-mots are allied to the Bee-eaters and have very similar
habits such as that of nesting in holes in banks, and capturing their
prey on the wing, but the tail of the Mot-mot is unique. The two
central features are considerably longer than the others and when
they are first grown they are normal feathers, but after a short time
the barbs for an inch or so disappear, leaving the bare shaft with a tuft
or racquet at the end.

For long it was supposed that the Mot-mot carefully trimmed its
tail to this peculiar shape after every moult, but both Mr.Beebe and the
late Mr. Astley have proved that at this particular part of the feather
the barbs, where they join the shaft, are degenerate and brittle, and that
they either fall off without assistance, or are assisted in the ordinary
process of preening.
Whether further consignments of the Masked Lovebird will be
imported we cannot tell, but in any case the small collection that has
arrived should be sufficient to establish the species in this country
for some years to come provided they are well looked after and prove
to be free breeders. It would be as well if those members who have
secured pairs of these would get into touch with one another with a view
to exchanging stock after the breeding season. It would be a great
pity if this beautiful species, now that it has come to us, should be
allowed to die out.
In the meantime we shall look forward to publishing the first account
of the successful breeding of the species in captivity, and hope that those
fortunate possessors of these birds will not forget to keep careful
notes of their nesting habits.
Mr. Ezra's wonderful collection at Foxwarren Park contains at the
present time no less than twelve species of Birds of Paradise, namely
the Twelve-wired, Greater, Lesser, Count Raggi's, Red, Princess
Stephanie's, Magnificent, Hunstein's, Wilson's, Lawe's Six-plumed,
Wallace's, and the Lesser Superb. Amongst the new arrivals are
two Wilson's in perfect plumage, and one had not before realized what
a wonderful little bird this is, as those imported some years ago by
Mr. Pratt were none of them in such exquisite condition as these.

PASSERINE PARROTLETS

Sir, --As the possible originator of the statement that it is cruel
to keep Passerine Parrotlets (Blue-winged Lovebirds) shut up, I should
like to say that I quite agree with the Editor that a pair should be
happy in a flight cage 48 X 12 X 18 inches, especially if they were turned
into a small aviary in summer. What is cruel is to keep Parrotlets,
Lovebirds, or the small Broadtailed Parrakeets of the Redrump type
permanently in a Parrot cage, or cage of similar dimensions, on hard
fixed perches, with no fresh twigs to nibble and no facilities for nesting.
But " the little more and how much it is " ; while a Parrot cage is an
abomination for them, they may be perfectly content and even try
to breed in properly furnished flight cages and aviaries of the most
modest dimensions.

HARDIHOOD OF SOME COMMON FOREIGN BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998973882352941" page_id="56773273"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I read with much interest the article by Mr. Appleby in the
May number, and thought perhaps a few observations on the subject
of mortality among the less expensive foreign seed-eaters might be of
interest.
My aviary is absolutely unheated and is situate in Surrey. Unfortu-
nately the only choice of position was one facing north, and only the
open flight gets any sun. The shelter is in two parts, one altogether
open in the front and the other screened off so that no cold wind
can penetrate. The roof of this latter part is lined with loose straw
tucked under laths and that is the only protection from frost. The
roof itself is a high-pitched gable. In this I have Orange-cheeked
and common Grey Waxbills, also Cordon Bleus, and the only deaths
for three years have been from accident, such as flying against a branch
or from old age. My Grey Waxbills were purchased in 1921, and three
out of four are alive and in perfect condition. I also have kept Zebra
Finches, yellow and green Budgerigars, an odd Java Sparrow--the
other hanged itself in a forked twig, and some Cutthroat Finches.

<bodyText confidence="0.998541275862069" page_id="56773274"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
I lost the hen Zebra Finch also through flying into a twig, and have
since removed the fatal branch which projected across the opening
from the inner shelter to the covered part of the flight. Since then
there have been no more accidents.
The water supply is a cement and pebble pool in the open flight
and has to be freed from ice regularly in the coldest weather. The
seed supplies are in hoppers in the covered flight and consist of canary
seed and Indian millet only. Green foods such as flowering grass,
chickweed and groundsel are freely given, but the latter is not much
appreciated. All is scrupulously removed when withered. The covered
flight is floored with about a foot of sand so that there is no damp.
To this dryness I attribute the freedom from illness of my birds. There
were some small bushes of wild plum, and a small sycamore in the open
part of the flight, more for the purpose of harbouring insects than for
anything else, as I find the Waxbills and Cordon Bleus are very keen
in catching small flies.
The wire roof of the open flight is pitched as high as possible so as
to get all the sun that is possible, owing to the north aspect. I find
the Waxbills, etc., appreciate a cosy box with plenty of dry straw in it
as a winter roosting place in the inner shelter. I may say this inner
shelter is not dark as there is an obscured window in it besides the
opening from the covered shelter shed.
I have come to the conclusion that when acclimatized the most
serious dangers to this class of birds are damp and draughts. Cold by
itself is not to be feared so long as the birds have plenty of room for
flight.
These remarks are merely platitudes, but some beginner may perhaps
pick up some useful hint.

It seems a general trouble that the young of both Black-cheek
and Nyasas die in the shell, and a foundation of damp moss or other
substance seems a remedy.
In the nest that I have designed, which follows usual shape, a
perforated zinc bottom is used, to allow the damp air to percolate
from a zinc tray at the bottom. In this tray is placed either damp
spagnum moss or sponge.
It should be noted particularly that the damping fluid should
consist of a weak solution of Sanitas or other compound that will
prevent decay.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97587175" page_id="56773290"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
This is one of the most beautiful of the genus to which it belongs,
and is confined to the island of Ceylon, where it is not uncommon in
the forest-covered hills. It is very seldom imported to Europe, which
is to be regretted.
In its native country this Parrakeet is said to associate in moderately
sized flocks and to be noisy and restless, uttering a harsh " crake "
on the wing as it dashes up and down the forest-clad glens of the
Ceylon mountains. It is said to be very partial to the wild fig.
The coloured plate renders a description of this species unnecessary.
The bird figured is a male, the female being very similar in colouration,
but somewhat duller with the bill dusky black.

The Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaelus). A description of this well-
known bird is hardly necessary. It is not so often kept in captivity
as might be supposed. It has nested on two occasions at Lilford and,
although eggs were laid and incubation took place, both birds sitting
alternately, there was no result.

G. H. Gurney--Birds of Prey
Imperial Eagle (A. imperialis). Adult blackish-brown above,
tail ashy-grey, head and neck light fulvous. This very handsome
species has been kept rather frequently in confinement. Three were
kept at Northrepps, one of which had been there over thirty years.
A hen laid several eggs in a scrape made on the floor of the aviary,
but would never sit. Their range extends through Southern Europe
to China and India.
Tawny Eagle (A. rapax). Above deep brown, primaries black,
tail brown, entire under surface dark brown. Occasionally imported.
It is found all over Africa, extending occasionally into Southern Spain.
The White-Shouldered Eagle (A. adalberti). Crown of head
black, upper part of neck sandy-brown, upper parts black, entire under
surface blackish. A pair of these Eagles were kept at Northrepps for
many years. They were obtained from a nest in Spain by Lord Lilford
in May, 1872. One of these Eagles was killed by an accident when about
twenty-three years old, the other died from natural causes in December,
1916, after forty-five years in captivity.
Other species of Eagles (Aquila) which have been kept in confine-
ment are : the Spotted Eagle (A. clanga), habitat South Russia, Persia,
and India ; the Wedge-tailed Eagle (A. audax), habitat Australia ; and
the Yulturine Eagle (A. verreauxi), habitat South Africa.
The White-tailed Sea-eagle (Haliaetus albicilla). Generally
brown, tail white, the fully adult plumage is not attained in this species
until it is nearly six years old. Most of the Sea Eagles appear to do well
in captivity and, though not often imported, specimens may generally
be seen, of one species or another, in Zoological Gardens, and occasionally
in private collections. This species is generally distributed over the
Old World. The American form (H. leucocephalus) and H. leucogaster,
the closely allied Australian species, have also both been kept in confine-
ment. H. branickii, the Corean Sea Eagle, and H. leucoryphus, the
Fishing Eagle, have been represented at the London Zoological Gardens.
The Vociferous Sea-eagle (H. vocifer). Head and neck and entire
breast pure white, tail white, remainder of lower parts rich chestnut,
primaries black. This very handsome species, although so common
all over East and Central Africa, does not appear to be often imported,
though it has been kept at Lilford and in one or two other places. It

appears to do well in confinement, and lias lived for ten years or more.
There are three specimens at present in the London Zoological Gardens.
Sub-family Buteonince
The Rough-legged Buzzard ( Archibuteo lag opus). Light brown with
darker markings, the tail has a white base with three or four dark
brown cross bars. Specimens which have been trapped or caught may
occasionally be seen in captivity, and I have had two or three at one
time or another. Like all the Buzzards, they vary very much inter se ;
some birds become remarkably tame, while others appear never to
lose their natural wild habits. This well-known species frequently
occurs in Great Britain in the autumn, is common all over Northern
Europe, migrating south in the winter.
The North American form, A. sancti-jokannis, has been kept at the
London Zoological Gardens.
The Common Buzzard (Buteo huteo ), I suppose the commonest of
all the birds of prey in confinement and one of the easiest to cater for.
Nothing comes amiss to them in the way of food and many live to a
great age.
The Jackal Buzzard (B. jackal ). Black, tail chestnut red, sub-
terminal band black, chest rufous white, mottled with black. A very
handsome species, which is fairly frequently imported, it has been
bred at Keswick on two occasions, a full account appearing in the
Aviculttjral Magazine.
I have never seen this species drink. It is perfectly hardy and
appears to be long-lived in captivity. In a wild state this species feeds
freely on snakes. It is found all over Central and Southern Africa.
The African Buzzard (B. desertorum) and the Augur Buzzard ( B .
augur), the latter a very handsome bird, are both brought over occa-
sionally, and have been kept by several aviculturists, while the
following species have been known in captivity. The Long-legged
Buzzard (B. ferox ), the Augural Buzzard (B. auguralis ), the Lineated
Buzzard (B. lineatus ), the Red-tailed Buzzard (B. borealis ), the Penn-
sylvanian Buzzard (B. latissimus), the White-tailed Buzzard ( B .
albicaudatus ), and the Red-backed Buzzard (B. erythronotm).

Hawk (A, plagiata) have both been kept at the London Zoological
Gardens.
Natterer's Hawk (Rupomis natteri), very close to Asturina. A rare
bird in captivity. It is found in Brazil.
The Chilian Eagle (Geranoaetus melanoleucus). Black, wings grey,
under parts white barred with grey. This species was kept at
Northrepps. It preferred carrion to fresh food, occasionally it uttered
a shrill piercing note. It has also been kept at the London Zoological
Gardens. The Dark-winged Buzzard (Leucopternis scotoptera) and the
Mantled Buzzard (L. palliata) have been imported. They inhabit
South America, and the Zoological Gardens has also had representatives
of the Ash-coloured Hawk (Urubitinga anthracina) and the Banded-
tailed Buzzard (U. zonura) from Mexico and Chili.
The Crowned Harpy (Harpyhaliaetus coronatus). Chocolate brown,
wings grey, a long occipital crest, rump brown, tail black, under parts
brown.
Two Crowned Harpys were kept at Catton many years ago. It is
a powerful and savage bird, very much of a carrion feeder. It ranges
over the greater part of South America.
The Black-necked Buzzard (Buteogallus nigricollis). Chestnut with
black markings, head grey, remainder of the body black. Another
rare species from Brazil, solitary examples of which, however, have
once or twice been brought alive to England.
The Brahminy Kite (Haliastur indus). Chestnut with darker wings,
head, neck and lower parts white, streaked with black. This Indian
bird is sometimes seen in captivity. Its flight is wonderfully easy and
buoyant ; one that was kept at Northrepps spent the greater part of
its time on the ground in preference to a perch. This form has com-
paratively weak feet. Two other closely allied species of Haliastur
have been imported, viz. H. intermedia, the Javan Brahminy Kite,
and H. sphenurus , the Whistling Kite.
The Bed Kite (Milvus milvus). This noble bird still breeds, thanks to
strict preservation, in Britain. Centuries ago it was common even in
the streets of London, acting as a scavenger. Its broad wings and
deeply forked tail are always distinctive when it is seen in the air. In
captivity it adapts itself to a sedentary life, but is easily kept, and

with proper treatment will live for years. I do not think, however, it
is so often seen in confinement as the next species.
The Indian Kite (M. govinda). The smallest Milvus and a common
Indian bird. Brown above, head and neck somewhat rufescent,
wings and primaries darker brown, tail brown, tipped with white
and distinctly barred with black, under surface dull rufous brown.
This species is rather frequently imported. I have known it to be sold
as the Egyptian Kite, but its much smaller size would serve to identify
it. It has often been kept at the London Zoological Gardens.
The Black Kite (M. migrans). Above dark brown, tail dark brown,
inclining to rufous at the tip, head and throat whitish, under surface
rufous brown. This species has been known to live twenty-two years
in captivity, and is frequently seen in collections of birds of prey. It
is found in Southern and Western Europe, accidental in England, the
greater part of Africa, and probably extends into Central Asia. The
closely allied M. cegyptius is also imported.
The Black-winged Kite (Planus ccendeus). Above ashy grey,
forehead and sides of face white, wings grey and black, tail grey-white,
under surface pure white, iris brilliant carmine. This very beautiful
and distinctive little Kite is an admirable bird for an aviary. I brought
three back alive from East Africa, and have never kept more attractive
Hawks. They became absolutely tame, and as soon as they saw me
would run up to the side of their aviary, whistling loudly and fluttering
their wings, in the hopes of getting a mealworm, of which they are very
fond. It has frequently been kept at the London Zoological Gardens,
but I do not think it a very long-lived species in captivity. It is
found over the whole of Africa.
The Sociable Marsh Hawk ( Rostrhamus sociabilis). Slate-grey all
over, wings blackish, iris red. This very aberrant form has been
imported a very few times. It feeds entirely on shellfish, and its
extraordinary long slender bill with a large terminal hook is no doubt
very useful for extracting the molluscs from their shells. It ranges
through the northern parts of South America.
As far as I know, only two species of Pernis have ever been kept in
confinement in England, viz. The Honey Buzzard (P. apivorus) and the
Crested Honey Buzzard (P. ptilorhyncha ), and these did not live for

any length of time. These species would require plenty of grubs,
bees, and wasps as food if they were to do well, but no doubt would
take small birds and rats as well. Mr. J. G. Millais kept a Honey
Buzzard for some time on a diet of French plums and honey, the only
things it would eat, while almost more extraordinary was a specimen
kept by Lord Lilford, which was fed on rice pudding.
Sub-family Falconince--maxilla notched
The Crested Black Kite (Baza lophotes). Above glossy greenish-
black, varied with white and chestnut on the wings, a broad band
of white across the chest, below white banded with chestnut. This
Indian species has been kept at the London Zoological Gardens.
The White-legged Falconet ( Microhierax melanoleucus). Above
bluish-black, under surface white. This tiny Eastern species, and the
next one, require artificial heat, at any rate in the winter ; they are
certainly delicate, but if they can be acclimatized they make the
most delightful birds in a small aviary. They feed entirely on worms,
beetles, moths, small lizards, and will eat small fish too. Both species
have been seen at the London Zoological Gardens, and I once kept a
specimen of the Pigmy Falcon, but it did not live long.
The Pigmy Falcon (Poliohierax semitorquatus) . Blue-grey above,
forehead, cheeks, rump and under parts white ; habitat Central Africa.
The Kestrel (Tinnunuculus alaudarius). The Common Kestrel
is too well known, both in captivity and in a wild state, for any descrip-
tion of it, or its habits, to be necessary. The most plentiful of British
Hawks, its range extends as far east as China and as far south as
Mombassa in East Africa.
The Lesser Kestrel (T. cenchneis). Claws white, back of male un-
spotted. Very similar in habits to the Common Kestrel, but not
particularly hardy in confinement. It is widespread over the African
Continent, and reaches the Pyrenees. Other species of Kestrel
( T. gracilis ), the Nankeen Kestrel (T. cenchroides), the American Kestrel
(T. sparverius ), and the South African Kestrel (C. rupicola). The latter
species I have kept for several years. They want a dry enclosed aviary
(unheated) for winter. All the Kestrels are long-lived in confinement.

Lilford, but I do not think elsewhere. The male is blue-grey, tail
brownish, thighs chestnut; the female is barred with blackish above,
head, nape and under parts rufous. Legs and feet red.
The Hobby ( Falco subbuteo). Fairly often seen in confinement.
The Red-thighed Hobby (F . femoralis) . I have had a pair of these
beautiful little South American Hawks for over two years. They have
shown no signs of breeding. They have to be kept shut up in winter
as they are not hardy. I do not think this species has been previously
kept in confinement.
The Eleonora Falcon (F. eleonorce). Everywhere dark brown
inclining to black, tail brown. The late A. E. Jamrach imported
these Falcons as far back as 1860. One of these birds lived at
Northrepps till 1867, and there is a beautiful picture of it by Wolf,
the great animal painter, when it was in entire bright Hobby-like
plumage. The very similar Ash-coloured Falcon (F. concolor) has been
kept at the London Zoological Gardens. Other species which have
been kept in confinement are the Rufous-throated Falcon (F. rufigularis)
from Mexico and the Orange-thighed Falcon (F. fusco-coerulescens) also
from South America. The Merlin (F. cesalon) is a lively and
interesting little species in captivity, constantly uttering its shrill
note when excited or alarmed. There seems to be no reason why this
bird, which nearly always nests on the ground, should not breed in
captivity if suitable accommodation was provided for it. Young birds
taken from the nest and brought up by hand make delightful pets,
but they must be kept in an indoor aviary large enough for them to
take plenty of exercise in during the winter. I have never, however,
found this species very long-lived. The Peregrine ( Falco peregrinus) .
This well-known bird has been kept at one time or another in most
private collections of Raptores. Perhaps I have been unfortunate,
but of the six or seven I have kept only one was what may be called
a satisfactory bird. Like so many of the British Hawks, unless reared
from the nest they are probably brought to one after having been
winged or caught in a trap and therefore are slightly damaged, as
unfortunately the Peregrine is one of the most persecuted of the birds
of prey. I always feel a Peregrine is in a wrong place in an aviary,
however large a one. It is essentially a bird of the air, and anyone

who has seen it stooping at a Pigeon or a Teal, or dashing with
tremendous courage and fierceness at an intruder molesting its nest,
must realize that a wild Peregrine is a very different bird from one
cooped up in an aviary. It may be said to be one of the oldest birds
kept in confinement, as it has been used in Falconry from very remote
times. "
The Lanner (F. feldeggi). Above ashy-brown mottled with fulvous }
whitish crown and lower surface mottled with brown. Many have
been kept in confinement. The longest record that I have is six years,
but it may have been kept for a longer period at the Zoological Gardens.
This Falcon is greatly used in Hawking by the Arabs. Other closely
allied species which from time to time are seen in captivity are the
Black-cheeked Falcon (F. melanogenys) from Australia, the Bearded
Falcon (F. biarmicus) from South Africa, the Barbary Falcon (F.
barbarus) and the Juggur Falcon (F.jugger) from India.
The Saker Falcon ( Hierofalco saJcer). Head pale rufous, upper
surface pale brown, all the feathers margined with rufous, tail pale
brown, under parts whitish. Has been kept at Lilford and more than
once in the London Zoological Gardens. A young female in the Society's
collection some years ago was almost as dark as a Falco subniger and
had the mantle of a very similar hue. This bird had been brought from
Alexandria in Egypt.
Two species of the Arctic Falcons are fairly often imported. They
are the Greenland Falcon ( H . candicans) and the Iceland Falcon
(H. islandus), but I can find no authentic record of the Gyr Falcon
(H. gyrfalco) ever having been kept in captivity ; though in 1885
Lord Lilford obtained a Falcon which he considered to be this species,
it was captured at sea off Cape Finisterre.
Family Pandionidce, distinct character. Outer toe reversible, tibia
closely feathered.
The Osprey (Pandion haliaetus). Above dark brown, crest, head
and lower parts white. Has been kept at the Zoological Gardens,
but I have no other records of it, and it must be very seldom imported.

LOVEBIRDS

(Continued from p. 150)
Agapornis PULLARIA
The Bed-faced Lovebird of West Africa was described as long ago
as 1758, and has had a number of names bestowed upon it, such as
" Little Bed-headed Parrakeet ", " Guiney Sparrow ", " Bed-headed
Guinea Parrakeet ", " Ethiopian Parrakeet " and Agapornis xanthops.

It is generally regarded as being the most difficult of the family to
acclimatize, though when this is accomplished it is acknowledged to
be fairly hardy. Certainly when first imported the mortality is very
high. On arrival they look very well and seem pretty tame, but this
is induced partly by the crowded travelling conditions and partly by
their each having a clipped wing. Why this bird alone amongst the
Lovebirds should be clipped is a mystery. It is best to keep them caged
and let them moult the stumps naturally ; but if an attempt is made to
draw them great care should be exercised, as any sudden shock may
prove very injurious to this highly sensitive bird. Only two or three
stubs should be drawn at a time, the operation being repeated at the
end of a week. They are frequently brought over from Africa on rice
in the husk, but, in the absence of this, ordinary rice will do just as well.
They take readily to white millet and canary, the former generally being
preferred. Some will also eat a little sunflower and a few oats. Fruit
they do not seem to care for, except occasionally a little sweet apple.
Little trouble will be experienced with this species if it is kept caged
until full-winged and is not put out of doors until May is well advanced.
They can then be left out the whole year.
Bed-faced are rather uninteresting aviary birds as they spend the
greater part of their time sitting in a group in the shelter, seemingly
disliking the glare of the sun. Occasionally, however, they have bursts
of energy, when they see how much damage they can do, stripping a
small tree in an incredibly short time. In flight they are a joy to behold,
possibly being the most beautiful of the family in this respect. They
are quite easy to sex, the under wing-coverts being black in the male
and green in the female ; the hen can also be distinguished by the

paler colour of her face, it being more of a yellow-orange than orange-
red, also the blue spot on the rump is paler than in the cock.
Although this bird has been known to aviculturists for so long, and
has been exported to Europe in such numbers as to make it compara-
tively scarce in its own country, no record exists of it having been
bred in captivity. Mr. G. C. Porter very nearly succeeded in 1904 ;
he was unfortunately away at the time, so was unable to give many
particulars. They nested in a small box with half a cocoa-nut husk
cemented inside. On his return he found two fine youngsters, full
feathered, lying dead on the ground. They were very fat and appeared
to be as large, if not larger, than the old birds. He attributed his
failure either to the mice which infested the aviary or the excessive
heat at the time. The young of this species are like the adult female,
except that the forehead is yellow, with no orange tinge, and the
yellow-orange near the base of the bill and on the throat is paler. In
1880 Mr. W. T. Catleugh put some into a large cage, and almost
immediately a hen took possession of a cocoa-nut husk and began to
lay eggs. Some Budgerigars in the same cage, however, threw them out.
Eggs were obtained both by Mrs. Anningson and Mr. R. Phillipps in
1902 and by Mr. Shore-Baily in 1915. There have been several instances
of partial success in Germany, which show that the clutch is from three
to five eggs, which the hen alone incubates for about twenty-one days ;
the young in down are scantily covered, white, with pure white feet
and beak. Concerning their life in the wild, Mr. George Bates (The Ibis,
1905, p. 89) writes :--
" They resemble miniature Parrots in their tones and actions, as
well as in their appearance. They go about in small flocks, making
little metallic squeaky cries, which yet have something in them recalling
the screams of Parrots. They like open country, and especially the
tall grass called ' ukae ', from which they get their Bulu name of
' Kos-ukae ' (' Kos ', meaning Parrot) ; hence they are more common
inland, for grass is scarce within a hundred miles of the coast. At the
back of my house at Efulen was a sort of wild fig-tree, and when its
fruit was ripe a flock of these little birds often visited it. Among them
were apparently young birds, which would sit on a limb making a great
racket and fluttering their wings till the others brought them food."

In the wild state they apparently lay their eggs in a nest in a hole
in a tree, though definite observations on this point are lacking.
Red-faced Lovebirds agree well together and with kindred species,
but are not to be trusted with small passerine birds.

THE SMALLER MACAWS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983507307692308" page_id="56773302"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
By E. Maud Knobel
A great deal has been written from time to time on the larger
Macaws, but I wonder how many aviculturists know the fascination
of the smaller Macaws and what charming and delightful pets they
can make. There are some six or seven different species of the smaller
Macaws, including the Spix, a very beautiful species, of delicate blue
and grey in colour. All the others are green with bright patches of
colour about them. They vary greatly in size, even those of the same
species. Mine have the same food as the Amazon Parrots, i.e. equal
parts of giant canary seed and white sunflower, mixed with a good
corn mixture containing wheat, oats, dari and maize. When young they
require bread and milk, and even when adult I give it to them now and
again. Of course, water and fruit, chiefly apple, dry biscuit, toast,
and pea-nuts.
I must confess that for years I looked at these Macaws and found
they left me " cold ". The ones that one generally saw in dealers'
shops did not seem to me to be very interesting. They never seemed
very tame or friendly, nor did they show very much intelligence, and
it was a long time before I was attracted by them. Then one day,
going into Chapman's, I saw a tame Severe, which came on to my
hand and allowed me to do what I liked with it. He very soon made a
conquest of me. The dark green of his plumage with the brilliant
scarlet on the inside of the wings, the darker red on the under side of
the tail made him a most beautiful and attractive creature. I longed
to possess him, but hesitated on account of his voice. I had always
understood Macaws could scream and were unendurable in a room.

E. Maud Knobel--The Smaller Macaws
I finally decided to go and consult the Zoo on this point. Their opinion
was that they did not think he would be more noisy than many of the
Amazons, so I decided to risk it and returned post haste to Chapman's.
Alas ! how often one has missed things by hesitating. It is fatal in the
bird world. If you see something and want it you must have it now
and never pause to think. When I got back to Chapman's, and I had
only been away half an hour, the Severe was sold and destined for a
home in India. However, before he departed there he was put on deposit
at the Zoo, where I had an opportunity of visiting him several times.
What happened there I do not know, for he was not on show to the public,
and was kept in the inner room, but somehow this affected his temper,
and one day when I put my hand up to take him out he bit me through
the finger. This was a surprise I did not expect, and after that I never
touched him again. The head keeper, who was not there when it
happened, could hardly believe it, and took him out to show me how
mistaken I was, whereupon he flew at him and bit him through the
lip. I have often wondered whether in India he recovered his previous
good temper. After that I began to " cool off " Macaws, and it was
some time before I thought of possessing one.
Then one morning as I was dressing I heard the voice of a Parrot
across the square. I thought to myself, " Well, someone else must have
set up a Parrot and put it in the window." Its cries were incessant, and
after a time they seemed to come nearer, but even then it did not occur
to me that it was an escaped bird. It was not until after breakfast,
when I was just starting to clean and feed my own birds, that the cries
of the Parrot seemed suddenly to have come close at hand. I looked
out of the window and there on our balcony rail was an Illiger Macaw
and a woman on the next balcony with an enormous broom. How
she hoped to catch it with a broom was a mystery. I immediately
ran down to the balcony, and I heard the woman say, " Ah ! Now she'll
catch it." I put a Blue-fronted Amazon that was in the room on to
the balcony hoping that that would attract it while I went for an empty
cage. This I soon procured, and returned, having put plenty of food
at the bottom of the cage. I need not have bothered much, for no sooner
did the little Illiger see the cage than he ran straight into it and was very
glad to find himself once more in safe quarters. By this time there was

quite a crowd below the balcony, and as I turned to go in two people
came round the corner each armed with a cage, and great was their
disappointment when they saw that he had already been successfully
secured. He turned out to be a dear little friendly bird, and soon
made himself quite at home and had a good square meal. He was in
nice condition, but had a damaged foot. Of course, whenever one finds
anything these days one has to give notice to the police, and this we
duly did, but I must say I did hope that no one would claim him.
Two days went by and nothing happened, and I was really beginning
to think he was safely mine when one evening a policeman arrived with
a working man and his wife, who said they had lost a little Macaw.
I went down and saw them, and when they described the injured foot
I knew all my hopes were gone, and I sadly went up to fetch the bird.
Never shall I forget the scene that followed, the joy of that woman and
the bird. She put it round her neck and kissed it over and over again.
A mother having found her long lost child could not have been more
delighted than was this poor working woman. The man then explained
how they had no children, and he had saved up and bought the bird
from Chapman because she was so lonely while he was out at work.
They lived in a tenement in Somerstown and the bird had never been
in a cage, but was allowed to wander about the room free. The woman
had thrown up a window to speak to a child in the street, and the bird
had taken fright at something and darted through the window and
was gone in a moment. It apparently had been out three days before
I caught it, so no wonder it was glad at the sight of food, though I still
marvel that it so quickly went into a cage when it had not been used to
one. And what touched me more than anything was that the man
offered to pay me for the care I had given it. However, I gave them some
advice and told them if they wanted to keep it always loose about the
room they had better cut one wing--that would make it quite safe, and I
gave them the old cage that it was in. They went away a very happy
trio, and a big smiling policeman looking on.
Well, that little bird quite decided me that when opportunity
offered I must have an Illiger.
However, it turned out that a Severe was to be my first venture
into the Macaw world. I was at Chapman's one day when a lot of

Parrots arrived, and amongst them a most beautiful specimen of the
Severe or Brown-fronted Macaw. Why they should be called Severe
I cannot imagine. He seemed in perfect condition and talked a little
I was told by the man who brought him over. But all he seemed to say
was " Buck up ". I carried him home in triumph, and for a few hours
was very happy, but my happiness did not last, for my beautiful bird
seemed to be drooping and ill; he would not eat. I went back to
Chapman and learned that the consignment had been beautifully
brought over and well housed as far as Havre, but there they had had
to tranship, and for the last part of the journey the birds had been
put on the deck and many of them had caught a severe chill. By this
time Bucky, as I called him, seemed very ill indeed ; he could eat
nothing and seemed to be in pain and suffering from stoppage. I tried
a good dose of salad oil, an hour after I tried castor oil and put him
on a hot bottle and kept him in my lap near a fire. Then I tried a dose
of Glauber salts, which had the desired effect, and then he tried a little
warm bread and milk. After that I knew I had saved him, but it had
been a " near go ", and had he been left in the shop or gone to someone
who did not understand, his life in England would have been indeed
brief. He has just turned out one of the greatest successes one has
ever had. He literally adores me. Overjoyed when I come into the
room and hysterically ecstatic if I go near his cage, and cries when I
leave him. If he is out, which he often is, playing on my swinging
dog chain, he is only happy on it for a short time and then flies on to
my shoulder, letting himself slide down until he lies like a baby on his
back on my lap. That is his favourite place, and he will remain there
for hours while I try and answer inquiries of the Society on what to do
with a Parrot who has plucked himself bare, or why we cannot supply
sample copies of the Magazine, etc. Bucky never knows a dull
moment; he is the merriest bird of all my collection, always busy
about something, either swinging in his swing, playing with a piece
of chain, or lying on his back at the bottom of his cage playing with a
piece of wood and laughing to himself all the time. He talks quite a
lot, but not real wmrds, and he tries desperately hard to whistle. But
do Macaws whistle ? I have an idea they cannot. Anyway, he is a
great success.

My next venture in this line was an Illiger. On looking through
a lot of packing cases filled with Amazon Parrots at Chapman's, I
saw that three of them each contained one Illiger Macaw. They were
all most miserable birds. One was almost bare of feathers and in a
very poor way. The next was a little better, but wild and inclined
to bite. The third was also a little misery, soiled all over by the
droppings of the bigger birds, and every time he tried to feed a Blue-
front gave him a savage peck and he retired to the back of the crate.
Still he had managed to exist during the long voyage over. I brought
him home, and really when I looked at him I almost felt ashamed of
him. He had no wing feathers and no tail whatever, and was a
thoroughly miserable creature. In fact, during the week that followed
I was several times asked if he was dead yet ?
The first thing I did was to feed him up on good boiled maize, bread
and milk, apple, and Parish's food in the water. Then I washed him
in warm water and put him by a fire to dry. At the end of a week he
began to put on some flesh and fill out a bit, and his plumage began to
look a little less like wire and to take on a more silky appearance.
He soon proved himself an amusing little beggar, and very soon took
to water like a duck. Now the Severe Macaw never bathes, and hates
being sprayed or anything to do with water. Not so the Illiger. He
will get into quite a big basin and literally lie down in the water, first
on one side and then the other. He often gets so wet that I have to
turn on the gas-fire to dry him up a bit or else roll him in a towel. He
is quite different in character to the Severe, though he loves playing
about, and will run about the floor as quick as lightning, and likes
being on the floor, which the Severe does not. He gets into the waste

like a snowfield covered in white envelopes from members of the
Society. He has one horrid habit, and that is he likes to come and
give you a nip in the back of your ankle. I think it is only play : still
it is a nip. Now he can say quite a lot of words, but mostly talks in a
loud whisper. I have heard that whispering is one of the characteristics
of Macaws. Is this so ? He constantly asks " What are you doing ? "--
and is so fond of the word " doing " that he will repeat it half a dozen

E. Maud Knobel--The Smaller Macaws
times before answering " I'm busy When I first had him he showed
no red on the lower breast and very little on the rump, and only a
feather or so on the frontal. Now, of course, he is perfect, with his
plumage glossy like silk, far more so than the Severe. This I put down
to the constant bathing. But his tail is his weak point. He seems to
grow the feathers and then they break off or are malformed. I suppose
why people do not keep Macaws more is their voice, for they have
voices and can use them. Taking them all round they are no worse
than a Ring-neck or an Alexandrine, but they can be persistent, though
I have always found a remedy to stop it, either covering them over or
letting them out. But, like all the Parrot tribe, they generally like a
good scream about sunset, when, in a wild state, I imagine they are
returning to their roosting-places for the night. The two I have are
far more gentle and reliable than most Amazons, and there is no doubt
about their devotion to one. I have several times had an opportunity
of seeing very tame and charming Spix Macaws. Of the smallest of
all this tribe there is a delightful little specimen of the Noble Macaw
now at the Zoo. It is very tame and talks a little in spite of a defective
beak. It is a beautiful little bird, not unlike a miniature Severe,
though the head is very different, but the scarlet on the top of the
shoulder and inside the wings gives it a very striking appearance.
Of the other smaller Macaws at the Zoo there is a nice Yellow Collared,
but he always seems rather a dull bird, perhaps it is because he is rather
high up and one cannot get at him to pet him. But the pair of Illigers
that live at the end of the house are really a fine pair of birds. One
wishes they could be seen in an aviary where an attempt at breeding
might be tried. They are most amusing in the way they play with each
other, and the other day when I was watching them the cock was
feeding the hen. They are not tame, and will not allow one to touch
them. This is probably because they are sufficient unto each other.
I have written these few remarks in the hope that others who may
have kept this group may be induced to give us their experience and
so help to widen our knowledge.

THE TRAGOPAN'S DISPLAY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999453294117647" page_id="56773308"  page_num="193" year="" vol="">
The male of the Horned Tragopan (Tragopan saiyra ) has the head
mostly black, the neck and the whole of the under surface bright
orange-carmine, the back and tail being brownish. Over the whole of
the body plumage are distributed spots of white, with black edgings.
The skin of the throat is blue, more or less obscured by black hair-like
features. A peculiar wattle is situated on the throat, but this is so
contracted as to be invisible except on such rare occasions as during
the courtship display. The same may be said of a pair of wattles
growing from the top of the head, which are completely hidden by
the plumage except on rare occasions. The female of the Tragopan
is of an inconspicuous mottled brownish hue. During the breeding
season the cock Tragopan may frequently be seen to perform a lateral
display, walking round the hen with his tail and body plumage more
or less depressed laterally, a form of display that is common to many
Pheasants. But the full frontal display of this bird, which is seldom seen,
is one of the most remarkable exhibitions in Nature ; quite as extra-
ordinary a transformation as that of the display of either the Argus
Pheasant or the Great Bustard.
For the past twenty years and more I have known Tragopans
in captivity, but only on rare occasions have I seen the full display,
and I will endeavour to describe what I saw on a recent occasion,
and only regret that no description can adequately convey the thrill
that this wonderful spectacle gave me.
The hen Tragopan was walking unconcernedly out into the open
and I had not noticed the cock bird in the darkness of some under-
growth in the background, until suddenly out he came with a run,
his body erect, with the white-spotted carmine feathers of the breast
and flanks spread out like a skirt ; his black face surmounted by two
erect horns of vivid verdeter blue, and from his throat a large bib of
intense blue, barred with red. Thus he ran forward looking like a
little Mephistopheles. Probably he saw that he was being watched,
for he soon stopped, shook his head, and both horns and bib quickly
contracted and disappeared, and the Tragopan became once more
a normal bird.

NOTES FROM MY AVIARIES

<bodyText confidence="0.99278725" page_id="56773309"  page_num="194" year="" vol="">
The birds in one's aviaries at this season are so very interesting
that I thought some members might like to hear of my doings.
One aviary, inhabited by small Finches, so far is doing very well.
One pair of Three-coloured Parrot-Finches have built the most attractive
nest. They took to a box nest made from a stump of a tree, and
hung on the wall, with quite a small hole for them to get in and out.
They completely filled this with fine grass, twisting the grass round the
small entrance hole in the most wonderful way, making it impossible
for one to see in, so that I have no idea if there are even eggs in it,
but I feel pretty certain there are, as the hen is sitting tight. 1 I hope
in the course of a few days I may hear the voices of young birds. The
second pair of Three-coloured Parrot-Finches laid seven eggs in a box
on the wall, and then started to build. They covered all the eggs
and eventually forsook the nest, and I felt they were pretty hopeless
from the first. They then started a half moult, and now have recovered
and are in fine condition, and I hope they will go to nest again before
the end of the season. I have two pairs of the ordinary Parrot Finches,
both nesting, and the eggs should hatch in a few days. Diamond Doves
also are sitting in this aviary. I find my pair very free breeders.
In another aviary I have a pair of Shamahs ; the hen is sitting on
five eggs. As soon as these hatch I intend opening the door of the
aviary into the garden and letting the cock out to find live food for
the young.
My Blue Birds in another aviary had a nest of five eggs, but
unfortunately a mouse got in and ate all the eggs. They went to nest
again about a fortnight after this calamity, and now the hen is sitting
1 Since the above was written three young Three-coloured Parrot Finches have
left the nest, (12th June).

again. As she has changed her nest-box to a much more secluded place,
which I trust is impossible (if any place can be) for a mouse to get at,
I hope she may bring off some young. Last year I had no luck with this
pair. They will feed the young on nothing but live insects, and unfortu-
nately will not touch gentles--nothing but mealworms--and I find
they will not thrive on only mealworms, but must have live ant
eggs, caterpillars, grasshoppers, etc.
In another aviary I have a beautiful pair of Royal Starlings. These
I have seen carrying grasses, but so far there are no signs of anything
further. I also have seen the Niltavas doing the same thing, but as the
season is not very far advanced, I hope they will progress farther.
I have only one Spreo Starling flying about. The old hen only laid
two eggs, and one young one died when only a few days old. The
hen has started building again, and probably will do better with the
second lot.
Several species of Broadtail Parrakeets are nesting. The Golden -
crowned Conures are again nesting this year and have laid two eggs.
The pair of White-cheeked Conures are very interested in a log nest-
box. I hope they will do something.
I have been very lucky this year with all nesting birds. I have never
had any trouble over egg-binding, and this I put down to always giving
gin and glycerine in their water when I see them starting to nest. I
believe it to be a most excellent thing, especially in this very changeable
climate.

Some fifty members of the Society accepted Mr. and Mrs. Ezra's
kind invitation to spend the afternoon of Saturday, 28th May, at
Foxwarren Park. The weather was delightful, and much time was
spent in viewing the wonderful collection of birds in the aviaries and
the birdroom. After tea a visit was paid to the large enclosure of
some 45 acres, in which one saw Antelope, Deer, Patagonian
Cavies, Kangaroos, Cranes, Pheasants, Brush Turkeys, and Chukar

Partridges under very natural conditions. A Monaul hen Pheasant
was seen with her newly-hatched chicks, while another was sitting on
her nest on the thatched roof of a shed.
Our members will be interested to hear that Mr. Herbert Whitley
has opened his fine Zoological Collection at Paignton to the public,
and all who visit South Devon should make a point of seeing it.
Besides being an expert aviculturist and possessing a superb
collection of rare foreign birds, Mr. Whitley has a large number of
mammals and a remarkable collection of the choicest domestic stock
of Rabbits, Pigeons, Cavies and so forth.
In the King's Birthday Honours List appears the name of David
Elias David Ezra, late Sheriff of Calcutta. We very heartily congratu-
late Sir David, the brother of our President and member of our Society
since 1912.
The Scarlet-chested or Splendid Parrakeet (Neophema splendida) of
Western and South Australia, the most beautiful of a beautiful genus,
has always been regarded as a great rarity, and for several years has been
thought to be extinct. Now a few examples have been noted in New
South Wales, so that although extremely rare it appears to have a
very extensive range and may hold its own. A good coloured plate
of this species appears in the Emu for April, 1927.
Another of the nearly extinct Parrakeets of Australia and perhaps
an even more wonderful one than that first mentioned, has also been
recently noted in New South Wales, namely the Paradise or Beautiful
Parrakeet (Psephotus pulcherrimus). A writer in the Emu described
the appearance of a little party of five of these, driven out of their
ordinary habitat by the drought which has recently been very severe
in the interior.
It is much to be hoped that the Australian Ornithologists' Union
will use their influence to persuade the Government to take up seriously
the question of breeding some of these fast disappearing Parrakeets
in suitable aviaries in Australia. If put in charge of competent avicul-
turists, there is no reason why some of these birds should not be saved.

Mr. Heumann contributes some interesting Bird Notes to the current
number of the Emu, and from these we extract the following :--
" The rarer species of Parrakeets could be bred most assuredly in
numbers if aviculture were not looked upon as vandalism. Turquoise
Parrots are supposed to be almost extinct. As a fact, when I lost my
cock bird of this species I had to pay #30 for another specimen. Out
of the young which I reared, my friend, Mr. Harvey, jun., of Adelaide,
who has a pair of them, again reared eight young this season in two
broods of two pairs each. Mrs. Mellor, of Adelaide, bred about a dozen
Princess Alexandra Parrots ; so also did Mr. Lienau. Out in the open
these birds have not nearly the same chance, as Hawks especially
cause havoc amongst them. But catapults and pea-rifles and the
scientific and unscientific egg-collectors do their share in the speedy
extermination of anything that may be rare."
Mr. James Charles Edwards, of 629 South Grand Avenue, Los
Angeles, California, is probably the largest breeder of Budgerigars in
the United States. Commencing about fifteen years ago with one
hundred pairs, he has now 1,500 pairs. His aviaries are
100 feet by 100 feet, divided into ten compartments, each housing
150 breeding pairs. He is also breeding Blues, Whites, and
Cobalts.
Besides the Budgerigar aviaries Mr. Edwards has others in which
he is breeding Bleeding-heart, Cuban and other species of Doves,
Cockatiels, Redrumps, Lorikeets, Pennants, Blue-wing Grass Parrakeets,
and several species of Lovebirds, as well as many of the ornamental
Finches, and he greatly prizes some Tabuan Parrakeets given to him
by the Marquess of Tavistock for experimental purposes.
We are very pleased to receive a copy of the first issue of The
Budgerigar Bulletin, published by the Budgerigar Club. In it will
be found much useful advice and many valuable tips for those who
would produce the various colour variations to which this most wonder-
ful of Parrakeets is subject.

Those who are rearing Budgerigars should remember that a weakly
youngster, providing he is not denude of flight-feathers, if caged and
petted will become perfectly tame and make the most delightful of
bird pets. He will delight to sit on one's head, shoulder or hand, and
will actually repeat several words with very little training. A tame
talking Blue Budgerigar will delight all who come in contact with him.

The older members of the Society will recollect the instructive and
often humorous writings that appeared in our Magazine a good many
years ago by the Rev. C. D. Farrar and will welcome the appearance
of a new book on his reminiscences as an aviculturist. It is full of
delightful humour and sound advice, and he does not mind recording
his failures as well as his successes. His accounts of interviews with
the dealers of the past will bring back vivid memories of some of our
old friends of twenty years ago, such as Joseph Abrahams, of St. George's
Street, East, and Maschke, of Islington. He reminds us of the high
temperature and lack of ventilation of the latter dealer's shop, which
those of us who visited it will recall. But both Abrahams and Maschke
sometimes had birds which we never see nowadays. From Abrahams
Mr. Farrar bought a pair of Poes, better known perhaps as Tuis, but
they are not Australian birds, as we are told, but New Zealand.
Mr. Farrar's reminiscences go back to the time when Turquoisines
could be obtained without much difficulty, and that is a long time ago.
He was fortunate enough to obtain two pairs, both of which bred,
though one nest full of young birds died through the cock-bird feeding
them on elder. He tells us that for some years he was not without the
species, but not knowing what was coming he sold them all, as many
other people did. Now they are on the point of becoming extinct.
Aviculturists will find much to interest and amuse them in

Although this is a small book and produced at an extremely low
figure, it is one of the most interesting books we have read for a long time.
Why do birds sing ? Why migrate ? Why do some species require
a considerable area of territory for each breeding pair while others
nest in colonies ? Such questions may never have occurred to some
of us, but they are of great importance, and are ably discussed by the
author, who has for many years made a special study of these problems.
The book, in short, is the view of an observer who has carefully studied
the writings of the latest and best observers and put them thoroughly
to the test. The territory theory, for instance, for which credit is due
to Mr. Eliot Howard, applies to such birds as the Warblers, which
have a very restricted feeding area, but does not apply to those which
range far afield for their food. Gatke's theory of the speed and altitude
of flight during migration has been shown by recent observers to be
at fault, the movement of birds at such time being much like that at
other times, but in a straight line and towards a definite goal.

Sir, --With reference to my notes on the American Siskin in the last
number of the Magazine, I have looked at the illustration of Chrisomitris
arisiis, mentioned in your footnote, and my birds certainly do not
belong to this species. They much more closely resemble the Black
Siskin, C. atrata , found in Bolivia and North Peru. They differ from
this bird by having much more yellow on the under parts, by the wing
bar being white instead of yellow, and by the hen having the nape of the
neck greenish-yellow instead of black. I shall take the first opportunity
of examining the skins at the British Museum as they have been unable
to name it for me from my crude description.

Sir, --Bowdler Sharpe, in British Birds (Allen's Naturalist's Library),
vol. ii, p. 85, says, " There can be no doubt that the Snowy Owl becomes
whiter with age, and that the very old individuals lose their markings
almost entirely, though it is a question whether the females ever
become perfectly snow-white and lose their spots and bars." I should
therefore like to record that the oldest specimen in the Zoo, which was
received several years ago in the barred plumage, became at its first
moult in the Gardens nearly if not quite as free from dark markings
as it is at present. It will be interesting to see how its recently received
and well-barred companions moult out, and those who practise photo-
graphy would be doing useful work in recording their progress.

NESTING OF LOVEBIRDS

Sir, --Following on Mrs. Prestwich's very excellent article on the
Lovebirds, may I offer a few suggestions arising from my own experience
which may be of help to breeders ? My chief trouble, in common with
others, has been young dead in shell. I refer to the Nyasa and the
Black-cheek.
Mr. Denys Weston recently published an account of an ingenious
contrivance for retaining moisture in the nest. For it is probably a
fact these species affect in nature damp situations. Anyhow, I have
so far shirked the operation of re-modelling my nesting boxes, and have
hit upon an alternative which appears to answer the purpose well
enough.
Upon the floor of the aviary I set a shallow pan of water and
arranged therein a supply of the leaves of spinach-beet or kindred
vegetable. The birds eat this greedily, but in addition they carry off
the wet leaves and arrange them about their eggs. By this expedient
I have hatched this spring a large percentage of the eggs of both
species, and the young show a much decreased mortality. The water
in the pan must be renewed daily, as spinach-beet soon fouls it. The
nesting material most in favour is the bark of willow twigs, and I
find, too, that the sort of wood shavings used in parcels is acceptable.
Be sure not to use aluminium rings on these birds. They work them
up over the tibia, and swelling and gangrene rapidly set in.
I have now three pairs of the Abyssinian Lovebird (A. taranta)
nesting. These birds were with me three years without attempting

to nest. One pair have three young three weeks old. They used no
nesting material of any sort. I could not see that the cock took any
part in the incubation.
My Masked Lovebirds (A. per sonata) have gone to nest within five
days of their arrival. They are constructing rather stout edifices of
twigs, not bark, in the boxes. Being rather large birds, the nesting
boxes should be of generous proportions. So far, this species has
refused to have anything to say to green food, which I shall nevertheless
continue to offer.

Sir, --I have just bought Dr. Hopkinson's book, Records of Birds
Bred in Captivity. I see that there is only one record of the Desert
Bullfinch for the United Kingdom. I reared two nests of them last year.
Two young birds each time. The first nesb contained four young, but
when the first two left the nest I went to clean out the box and frightened
out two others which were still in the fluff, dropping on to the floor
from about six feet, one got killed and the other so hopelessly crippled
its legs that after it had left the nest and could fly I destroyed it myself
as it could not stand. These were reared in an aviary full of other birds.
I also reared last year two nests of Hybrids of a second generation
from a (Hooded Siskin X Canary) X (Canary).
Three young left the first nest ; one died later. Two left the
second nest. In the autumn I caught them up and caged them, when
two of them suddenly died. Whether it was fright or not, or owing
to the others, as they were not very friendly towards each other, I do
not know. I exchanged the two others with another member.
In 1923 I had two nests of Hybrids, Indian Silverbill X Zebra Finch.
Four young left the first nest; one died later. These three all sang
so I suppose they were cocks. The second nest only produced one
young, as the three young of the first brood always roosted in the nest.
It is rather a wonder that any were reared. This bird did not sing and
died the following spring, so I sent it up to the Museum as they were
asking for any Hybrid birds that might be bred.

Last year I also bred the Chestnut-breasted Finch. Three of the
four young are still alive, two of them have almost got their mature
plumage, but the third shows no sign of any colour on the under parts
yet; there are a few dark feathers on the face, which markings are the
last to appear on the young. Otherwise it might be a young Flavi-
prymna.

MONS. DELACOUR'S COLLECTION
Sir, --The first Pheasant hatches at Cleres are very promising.
The pair of Argus three years at Cleres have so far laid five eggs and
there are five young, respectively five, three, and one week old. Also
Imperial, Edwards', Elliott's, Crestless Firebacks, Crossoptilous, Bel's,
Black-crested, Horsfield's Kaliy, and six Cabot's Tragopans. Many
more are incubating, as well as Ducks, Geese, and Rheas.
J. Delacour.
A HYBRID SWAN
Sir, --Up to the end of April last year, it may be there still, on a
small piece of water, the remains of a lake in Corvill Hall, Brentford,
just at the eastern end and cut in half by the Great Western Road,
was a Hybrid Swan (Australian Black X Mute Swan S). The bird
appeared to be mature, and had a black and white spotted appearance.
The wings were mostly white, and the neck mostly black, spotted with
white, while the body was the reverse. The feet were, I think, very
dark. The carriage and general shape were more of the Australian
bird than the Mute Swan. The bird belonged to the Brentford Council.
I do not think they liked it as it was rather savage.

Obituary
Many members must bave books they no longer require, or which
they are willing to loan. These could be collected together with
advantage. If sufficient support is forthcoming I would give Seth-
Smith's Parrakeets , Greene's Parrots in Captivity, and sundry other
standard works, and act as librarian pro tem. Perhaps members
would give their views.

It is with deep regret that we have to record the death, which
occurred on 24th June, of Her Grace the Duchess of Wellington, Vice-
President of the Society.
The Duchess was a very keen aviculturist and took the greatest
interest in the welfare of the Avicultural Society. Her beautiful
aviaries at Ewhurst Park were well known to many of our members.

From my earliest days I have known and loved the Budgerigar.
As a child I remember some that were owned by an elder sister and
which I thought the most delightful birds in the world. There was
something about them that fascinated me then, and they fascinate
me still, and I shall always regard this species as the most wonderful
of all of the Parrakeets. There is only one species of Budgerigar,
and no other species is closely related to it, or has one-half of its charming
habits and ways. It has taken to a life in captivity as no other species
of Parrot has, and to such an extent has it been bred and reared in
captivity that the world is independent of the original source of supply,
and if no more ever come out of Australia its numbers in Europe, Asia,
and America can be kept up and increased to almost any extent.
As everybody knows, the Budgerigar, in its original dress, is of a
beautiful grass green, barred on the back, and with the forehead
bright Canary yellow. In this dress it occurs in its native habitat,
Australia, where it migrates from one locality to another in flocks,
following the ripening grass, upon the seeds of which it feeds. Yellow

206 D. Seth-Smith--The Budgerigar and its Colour Varieties
birds have been noted in such flocks, so it is not to be wondered at that
a yellow race was produced in Europe many years ago. Exactly
when these yellow birds were first produced I do not know, but I do
know that the yellow Budgerigars one saw ten or twenty years ago
were of a better and purer yellow than those one sees to-day. Yellow
birds are not very popular just now, and this may account for the
want of care that has occurred in their breeding. They have been so
much crossed with greens that most of the birds one sees have much
too much green in their colouring. What one wants to see is the true
lutino Budgerigar with pink eyes and no trace of green whatever.
Such birds have been produced, but the ordinary type of yellow
Budgerigar has dark eyes and a green tinge on the rump. The true
lutino would lack entirely the black pigment which, together with
yellow or orange pigment and peculiar feather structure, gives the
normal green coloration.
If the black pigment be retained and the yellow eliminated, we
obtain the beautiful blue variety which we have all become familiar
with. How the first of these mutants was produced we do not know,
but it was doubtless nothing more than a lucky sport which its
fortunate breeder took great care to preserve and to breed from. The
first blues seem to have appeared in Belgium in the early eighties, but
it was not until the year 1910 that specimens were exhibited in this
country. These were owned by a Belgian aviculturist who had
established the variety in his aviaries. Others both in Great Britain
and on the Continent obtained pairs, and the variety soon became
established. With the three colour varieties, green, yellow, and blue,
of a free-breeding species, there were great possibilities of producing
other colours by judicious crossing, and the results of such experiments
are seen in the cobalt, which is perhaps the finest of all, the mauve
and the olive. Then there is the white variety which generally shows
a considerable trace of blue. At the Zoological Gardens a brood of
three of these appeared from blue parents, but it has also been obtained
from crossing blue and yellow and mating their progeny. Experi-
menting with the crossing of the different varieties of this Parrakeet
is a fascinating hobby, and probably much still remains to be
accomplished in the production of new tints.

D. Seth-Smith--The Budgerigar and its Colour Varieties 207
One has heard of red Budgerigars, but few will be taken in by these
obvious fakes. Mr. Chapman recently had some sent to him from
somewhere in the East, and he was good enough to send me a pair
to see. They were very cleverly dyed an orange red and were of a
striking appearance, but a few new feathers were appearing here and
there and these were green S
Blue Budgerigars are expensive, and the cobalt variety is more
costly than the other, but they can be produced by breeding from green
birds that have been bred from one blue and one green parent. Such
birds are known as " blue-bred " birds, and provided their parentage
is known they may be expected to produce a percentage of pure blues.
A blue and a green bird mated together will produce only green
offspring, but these are the so-called blue-bred birds and are capable
of producing a percentage of blue birds.
When mated together these blue-bred birds should produce 25 per
cent of pure blues, 50 per cent of greens that are blue-bred, like their
parents, and 25 per cent pure greens that have no power to produce
blues. The trouble is that these pure greens cannot be distinguished
from the blue-bred greens from the same parents, and here lies the
cause of much disappointment.
In breeding blues from blues, although only pure blues will be
obtained, the stock is likely to become weakly after a few generations,
and so it is always advisable to obtain fresh blood by breeding a few
blue-breds, and mating these inter se. The blues bred from these will
be absolutely pure blooded, and may be used for fresh blood amongst
the original stock of blues.
With regard to cobalts, I have had no personal experience, but I
understand that blues mated to olive birds may produce birds which
in the next generation may produce this splendid variety. Perhaps
those of our members who have experimented in breeding these and
the less striking though very interesting mauve variety will give us
the benefit of their experience.

I was hoping to have written a long and detailed article on the birds
of some of the little-known parts of Portuguese East Africa, for on
11th September, 1925, two of us started from Mount Selinda on foot
with a number of native carriers, intending to march into the interior
of Portuguese East Africa, making the district where the Umvumaoodzi
and the Sabi Rivers join our headquarters for a time.
The same day that we started we crossed the frontier and spent
the night at Spungerbera, a small settlement where a Portuguese
Commandant lives; after that our way lay over the dense jungle-
covered Chimanimani Mountains, until 40 miles further on we
reached the great central plains, and in eleven days' time reached the
Umvumaoodzi River, and there we intended pitching our camp for
several weeks in a district which at the best of times is far from healthy.
But the hardships encountered en route, terrible tropical storms,
trouble with the carriers, illness, bad organization, terrific heat, and
last, but not least, acute starvation, rendered me in anything but a
mood conducive to observing birds ; hence these meagre notes.
The Umvumaoodzi is a very wide sand river (about 1 to 2
miles wide in the rainy season), but at the beginning of the wet season
is a chain of large deep pools resembling small lakes, covered for the
most part with huge water-lilies and fringed with tall and dense reeds.
This part of the country was particularly rich in bird life. We saw many
birds that I have already mentioned in my notes on Mount Selinda,
but the following were noted for the first time :--
The Hadada Ibis (Hagedashia hagedash)
In the early mornings, long before the dawn, we were awakened by
a small flock of these beautiful but extremely noisy birds flying over our
camp from their roosting-place to their feeding grounds down the river ;
the noise they make is incredible. I should think the noise made by a
large flock would be perfectly deafening. The birds had one special
roosting-tree, to which they came in small parties of three or four in the
evenings, and departed in the mornings to their respective feeding

grounds in the same small parties. The general colour of this bird is
light grey, the wings being metallic bronze green, the tail purple.
The Three-banded Plover (AEgialitis tricollaris)
These charming little birds are found in twos and threes in the
early mornings picking up their food on the sandy flats by the pools ;
they have a peculiar habit of running a yard or two and then stopping
and jerking their body up and down as though courtesying. They
run over the sand or mud flats with incredible speed.
Another little Plover, which I believe was the Caspian Plover
(AEgialitis asiatica), was common on the wet sand flats of the
Umvumaoodzi, where it kept in small flocks, running with great speed
and every now and then probing into the sand with its bill. It ^ was a
very confiding little bird and would come within a few yards of one.
The Saddle-billed Stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis)
I came across these unique birds but once on the dry sandy bed
of the river. They are easily distinguished from any of the other Storks
by the very peculiar black and crimson upturned bill, and when on the
wing by the pure white under-wing feathers. These birds are far from
common in East Africa, and only frequent the low-lying parts of the
country in the vicinity of marshes, swamps, and large rivers, where
they seem to go about in pairs. They are shy and difficult to approach,
flying up at the slightest sign of danger and making wide sweeping
circles in the air, rising higher and higher until they are lost in the blue.
The Black or Speckled Duck (Anas sparsa)
I frequently came across small parties of these Duck on the pools
or the rivers, usually five or six together ; they are far from shy and
will allow one to approach within easy distance of them. The Black
Duck does not seem to be very common in any part of South Africa.
A person who lived near Mount Selinda discovered a nest containing
five eggs of this Duck, which she placed under a fowl; the whole five
hatched and the Ducklings were dark brownish black, marked with
yellow. They were exceedingly tame, far more so than ordinary
Ducklings, and would come into the kitchen every day to catch flies.
They grew up without mishap into delightful pets, but what eventually
became of them I don't know. I'm afraid that people in general in

Africa don't cherish any sentimental ideas about their pets if they are
of any utilitarian value.
The Hooded Weaver Finch (Spermestes scutatus)
These pretty little birds, so well known in England as cage birds,
are very abundant in Portuguese East Africa. I first saw them in small
flocks on the ground, searching for seeds around the outbuildings at
Spungerbera, a small but pretty frontier station. I also saw them many
times on our march into the interior, invariably around old Kaffir
kraals and lands, feeding upon the minute seeds of various grasses and
plants. They were exceedingly tame.
The Fork-tailed Drongo (Dicrurus afer)
This was the commonest bird that we met with on our trip ; in some
parts there were hundreds of them and their loud notes could be heard
the whole day through. One hears them before any other bird in the
morning and last thing at night when all the other birds are at roost.
These Drongos seem to take all their food in the air, taking up a post
of vantage and making short flights at intervals to capture insects
as they pass. I have very seldom seen one on the ground. Sometimes
they have singing competitions ; two males will alight on a branch side
by side and sing with all their might, each one trying to drown the
notes of the other.
The Three-streaked Bush Shrike ( Telephonus australis)
I met with this rare Shrike several times, at least, I think it belonged
to this species. In colour it is ash grey, browner on the mantle, the
wings chestnut, and the tail black, the throat white, a black streak
from the base of the bill through the eye to the nape, the eyebrows
light grey. Its habits seemed to resemble in most ways those of the
Black-headed Shrike, to which bird it seems to be closely allied. We
found this Shrike in the thick bush by the Periwiri River.
The Melba Finch (Pytelia melba)
This charming little Waxbill was frequently seen around the Kaffir
kraals and huts either singly or in pairs busily engaged in picking up
minute seeds. It is a very confiding little bird and its habits resemble
more or less those of the very familiar Blue-breasted Waxbill.

The Carmine-throated Bee-eater (Merops nubicus)
Of all the African birds this is perhaps the most lovely--in colour
a mixture of delicate rose pink, of rich carmine, pale blue and green---
it is a glory of the avian world. At the Periwiri River, which is a chain
of large, still, lily-covered pools in the dry season, we found these
glorious birds exceedingly numerous. Sometimes when sitting on the
bare branches of the trees by the river's edge their plumage would
assume a burnished copper hue in the brilliant sunlight. At various
intervals during the day they hawked for insects high in the air, after
the manner of the Swifts, the whole flock mounting higher and higher until
they were lost to sight in the blue sky, then they would come down again
and fly just over the water, dipping their bills into it and drinking as
they flew. Their flight is nothing short of marvellous ; they can sail
along at an incredible speed, without a motion of their outstretched
wings, twist, turn, and stop dead still. Their method of bathing is
interesting. They first of all congregate in small flocks on the bare
trees near the water, and from there two or three at a time will take a
flight over the surface, suddenly dive down, and immerse their heads
under the water, rapidly beating the water with their wings and churning
it up into a spray and completely soaking the plumage. Owing to the
plumage being so wet the flight back to the tree is very laboured and
heavy. They then sit preening their resplendent plumage in the sun ;
meanwhile, there is a steady flow of birds back and forwards from
the water. The time taken by the birds in bathing is only a matter of
a few seconds. The voice of this Bee-eater is not in keeping with its
plumage, it is merely a rather loud harsh twittering. The birds seem to
have set times for bathing, resting, and catching their food. My com-
panion told me that these birds nest in hundreds in holes in the sandy
banks of the Zambesi. They are seldom found far away from water,
though I have sometimes seen them on the high dry veldt; but I believe
they were then only on their way to the north, where they go to breed.
Arnot's Bush Chat (Thamnolcea arnotti)
We frequently saw this rare bird on the high dry veldt in Gazaland.
A striking mixture of black and white makes it a most conspicuous
bird. The solitary specimens that we saw were always hopping about

the taller trees after the manner of a Thrush. Owing to the adverse
conditions we met with, I had little time for studying the habits of
this bird.
The Black Tit (Parus niger)
Occasionally we saw this very striking but very un-Tit-like bird
in the trees by our camps. Judging by its demeanour, it seems to
resemble the Shrikes more than the Tits. It is always a solitary bird ;
I have never seen it in pairs. It is very active in the trees, passing from
branch to branch the whole day and seldom resting. It does not run
over the boughs after the manner of the true Tits. It utters most of the
time a peculiar harsh note. The food consists of insects, especially
spiders, which it finds in the trees.
The Racquet-tailed Roller (Coracias spatulatus)
A pair of these beautiful birds were seen by our camp near the
Umvumaoodzi, sitting on the top of a tree uttering their peculiar and
very distinctive note. They feed principally upon grasshoppers.
The Yellow-billed Kite ( Milvus cegyptius)
We found this bird fairly common and single examples would stay
around our camp on the look out for scraps ; sometimes if they saw a
small piece of meat they would swoop down and seize it with their
talons within a yard of one. The flight is extremely buoyant and light,
and the tail during flight pivots from side to side. Sometimes this bird
will sweep over the low bushes in search of small birds and mammals.
Sparrman's Honey Guide (Indicator sparrmani)
In some parts, especially in the well-wooded districts, we found this
bird plentiful ; it at once attracts attention by its loud, harsh, chattering
cry. When it wishes to attract the attention of a human to a bees'
nest it is confiding enough, but at other times it is very shy and
extremely difficult to approach.
The Wood Hoopoe (Irrisor viridis)
We found the nest belonging to this species in a tree in the middle
of a rest camp about 50 miles from Spungerbera. We discovered the
nest owing to the female bird flying round and round uttering its loud

chattering cry. The natives we found had stuffed up the hole with
grass. I have no idea why this was done, because when a native finds
a nest with eggs in he usually keeps a watchful eye on it with a view to
taking the young as soon as they are large enough to eat. We found
the eggs, five in number, a beautiful pale greenish blue, very much
like those of the European Starling, at the bottom of a hollow branch,
about 5 feet away from the opening ; there was no nest, the eggs were
just lying on the damp rotten wood, and were very much stained in
consequence.
Moselikatze's Roller (Coracias caudatus)
Not far from the nest of the Wood Hoopoe we found a nest of this
Roller placed in the upright hollow branch of a large tree about 20 feet
from the ground, the hole was so small that we would have thought
it was almost impossible for the birds to enter.
The Swallow-tailed Bee-eater (Dicrocercus hirundineus)
We frequently saw these beautiful birds on the way down to the
Umvumaoodzi River, usually singly, perched on the topmost branch
of some dead tree, and from there making short flights into the air
to capture winged insects as they passed. They have a very
distinctive call.
The Brown-headed Parrot (Poeocephalus fuscicapillus)
In some districts that we passed through this Parrot was exceedingly
abundant, in one especially which was covered by grey lichen woods
they were breeding in the hollow trees. Like most of the East African
Parrots, these birds associate in pairs and are usually very shy, but
when camping by the Umvumaoodzi River we found them com-
paratively tame and quite easy to approach. They came there in large
numbers to feed upon the nectar of the huge red flower of the " German
Sausage " tree. During the time they were feeding they remained
fairly quiet, but at other times, especially when flying, they gave vent
to ear-piercing shrieks. This charming Parrot is light brown on the
upper parts, including the upper breast, darker on the head, and the
nape is tinged with green ; the mantle wings and tail dark grass-green,
the lower back rump, upper and under tail-coverts brilliant grass-
green, the under parts are bluish pea green, the under wing is brilliant

canary yellow, and is very conspicuous in flight. This Parrot seems
seldom to have been imported into England, which seems a great pity,
for it is plentiful in its native haunts and would, no doubt, make a
delightful pet.
Peter's Fin-foot (Podica petersi)
I first saw this strange Cormorant-like bird on a secluded lily-
covered pool of the Periweri Eiver ; it was swimming with the body
submerged, the back being on a level with the surface of the water.
It didn't seem in the least perturbed at seeing me, and later when I was
sitting on the trunk of a large fallen tree which lay half across the pool
it came and settled on a branch within a few feet of me ; it was in a
drenched condition, and at once proceeded with a lengthy toilet, which
lasted over a quarter of an hour. After that it went into the water again,
and proceeded to fish by diving and staying under the water ; some-
times it was submerged for more than a minute at a time. It must
have travelled at a great speed under the water, judging by where it
went under and where it came up again. If the fish it caught was a
large one, it would bring it to the surface to swallow, but if the catch
was a small one it would be swallowed under water. After about five
minutes of this the bird would come and settle near to me and again
proceed with a lengthy toilet. I have never seen such a fearless bird ;
it seemed, in fact, to approve of my company ; evidently I was the first
white man it had seen.
The Jacana (Phyllopezus africanus)
On the same pool on which I saw the Peter's Fin-foot I saw a pair
of Jacanas and spent several pleasant hours watching them. Their huge
feet are specially adapted for walking on the large water-lily leaves ;
when the leaves are en masse they do not sink under the bird if it is
stationary for any length of time, but single leaves gradually sink.
If the leaves are too far apart for the bird to comfortably walk on it
will swim. The whole time that the birds are walking over the aquatic
vegetation they are busily engaged in picking up minute aquatic insects
upon which they feed. The Jacana is an extremely graceful bird in
build and also in its movements.

The Swallow is a particularly attractive bird, which spends a great deal
of its time in the trees, where it utters its sweet and sustained song.
The Swifts were only seen in the early mornings before sunrise when
they bathed in the water. Owing to the extremely short tail and the
flittering mode of flight they look strangely like bats.

By J. Delacour
These birds have completely webbed feet ; the great toe being joined
by a membrane to the rest. They are mostly sea birds, and only a few
of them frequent fresh water. They are large perching birds and feed
on fish. Certain species are often met with in Zoological Gardens, where
they live well if given their proper diet of fish and meat, but few of
them are desirable to amateurs, for they are not beautiful, are large
feeders, and very dirty.
The Pelicans ( Pelecanus ) are well known, they are all large birds
having white or pale grey plumage. They are characterized by long
beaks, provided with an enormous expanding pouch below. There are
roughly speaking about ten species, all about the size of a Swan ;
all swim and fly with great ease. They do well in captivity, feeding on
fish. Pelicans have a duller colouring when in eclipse, and the females
differ slightly from the males. They are sometimes dangerous to feebler
birds. The species are as follows :--
Pelecanus onocrotalus, inhabits Europe, Africa, and West Asia ;
large ; white, with a pink flush and black flights.
P. roseus, which frequents the same regions and spreads to the
extreme east. Smaller, and with a shorter beak.
P. crispus, distributed over the same ground except Africa. Black
and white, with a crest on its head.
P. philippensis , from India, Indo-China, and the Philippines.
Black, white, and vinous brown ; smaller.

J. Delacour--Pelicans and their Allies
P. rufescens , from North-East Africa, resembles the preceding.
P. fuscus, Gulf of Mexico. Pale yellow head, brown neck, grey,
with black streaks above; vinous brown underneath ; small. P.
californicus, from the Pacific Coast, is much the same.
P. thagus, native of Peru and Chile, one of the guano-making birds,
is brown with white stripes ; head and sides of the neck yellow, upper
part of the neck black.
P. erythrorhynchus, from the interior, North, and Central America
is white with black flights and in the breeding season it is adorned with
a horny plate on the middle of the upper mandible.
P. conspicillatus, Australian, is white, with black on the mantle
and wings.
The Tropic Birds (Pbaethontidse) are very beautiful sea birds, with
white plumage more or less flushed with pink, and sometimes also with
black markings, and with very long pointed tails. Their bills are short
and conical, and their feet very tiny. There are about half-a-dozen
species, all frequenting tropical seas. They cannot endure confinement.
The same applies to the Frigate Birds (Fregatidae), large sea birds
with very long narrow wings and forked tails, which one often sees
floating above tropical coasts. They are black, but the male has a
naked red pouch under his bill, which he can inflate at pleasure. Young
birds have white heads and necks. They have been successfully kept
for a time in some zoological gardens, especially in New York.
Gannets (Sulidae) are large birds, with pointed tails and large
bills bare at the base.
The Common Gannet (Sula basana), well known on our coasts, is
all white save for its black flights ; there are many other species, mostly
white, or brown with more or less white, which cannot be enumerated
here. Gannets do fairly well in confinement, but have little to recom-
mend them to amateurs. They are generally to be seen in zoological
gardens.
Darters or Snake Birds (Anhinga) are curious birds, which
frequent river-courses and lakes in hot countries. They remind one
of Cormorants and have much the same appearance. They are thick-
bodied, with fairly long tails, very long and slender necks, terminating
in a scarcely larger head, itself prolonged by a long, pointed, narrow

Birds
Darters often perch ; they swim and dive with amazing facility,
and are very amusing to watch ; they also become very tame. I brought
some back with me from Orinoco, and one occasionally sees them in
zoological gardens.
The Ruddy Darter ( Anhinga rufa), from Africa and Asia Minor
is black on the top of its head and back of its neck, the throat and
front of the neck ruddy, with a white stripe from the eye to the shoulder,
the rest of its plumage is black, streaked above with white. The female
has the top of her head, middle neck, and back ruddy.
The Asiatic Darter (A. melanogaster) is known by its brown
head and neck, with white spots, and by its fawn-coloured mantle.
The Australian Darter (A. nova-hollandice ), also found in
New Zealand and New Guinea, is black with a white band at the sides
of the neck, a chestnut spot at the base of the neck and in front, and
white-streaked mantle. The female is brown above and white beneath.
The American Darter (A. anhinga) is black, with brown and
white mantle. The head and neck of the female are light brown.
Cormorants are well known birds ; our two species Phalacrocorax
carho and P. graculus are black with green lights ; the last named is
smaller and crested. After the breeding season they assume a dull, deep
brown plumage. There are many species of Cormorants, all much alike,
living sometimes by thousands on rocky coasts all over the world. Some
have black and white plumage. They all live well in confinement, and
some are always on view in zoological gardens ; but they are not birds
for the amateur ; so we need not dwell longer on them. They live on
fish. The Chinese and Japanese tame Cormorants and train them to
fish for them.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
Swans, together with Geese and Ducks, make up the Anseriform
Order, which is known by having webbed feet, but the big toe free
and flattened bills provided with lamellae or plates. Swans compose a
small, very special group of Palmipedes ; one species may be looked
upon as aberrant and intermediate with other kinds. They are large
birds of quarrelsome disposition, but given sufficient space and
water they are both beautiful and imposing.
Swans are a great ornament to a piece of water, but unless they can
be accommodated with a really large territory and plenty of water,
enough to enable each pair to isolate themselves, it is better to give
each pair a separate pond or tank, which, however, may also be
inhabited by aquatic birds of other species. They feed on grass, aquatic
plants and grain, and must be enabled to obtain all the vegetable food
which they need to keep them in good health. Generally speaking, Swans
do not mind cold. Although pairs of the same species or of different
species fight savagely for the purpose of keeping to themselves a stretch
of water which would really be large enough for a dozen of them, they
do not as a rule interfere with other swimming birds, except the largest
kinds, and those in particular which are coloured like themselves,
which last is a habit common to all birds.
The sexes are alike, but the female is smaller than her mate. They
are monogamous and pair for life, and should one perish the widowed
bird often pines away and dies of grief. A male which has lost its mate
often attacks a fresh one, but may, after a time, get used to and accept
her. Swans are migratory birds, as are most Palmipedes.
The Mute Swan (Cygnus olor ) is the White Swan, commonly met
with everywhere. It is perhaps the most handsome, but also the most
vicious of all its race. A breeding male not only tries to kill every other
Swan he comes across, but attacks all other kinds of web-footed birds.
The young in their first plumage are grey, which is the case with most of
the genus ; they turn white after their second summer. The so-called
" Polish " Swan ( C . immutabilis) is nothing more than an albino
variety of the domestic bird. Adults have grey feet and paler bills,

and the young in down are white. The so-called Mute Swan is not
really without a voice; it utters a kind of grunt. It is quite
domesticated here, but is wild in Northern Europe and Asia.
The Trumpeter Swan (C. buccinator) is the largest Swan ; it has
become very rare in its own country, western North America. Its beak
is perfectly black and its plumage white. It is easily domesticated,
the cock bird is very spiteful towards its own species, even in winter,
but does not attack Ducks. It has a very powerful voice, like the sound
of a trumpet.
The American Swan ( C . columbianus) is smaller than the preceding,
and has a small yellowish white spot at the sides of its beak, near the
nostrils ; it has the same kind of cry as Bewick's Swan. This species
has never yet been bred in confinement, though a cross has been
obtained between it and the wild Swan. It is a native of North-East
America.
The Wild or Whooper Swan (C. cygnus) is found in Northern
Europe and Asia. It has a musical cry like the sound of a shrill trumpet.
It is distinguished by the large yellow spot at the sides of the beak.
It has bred in confinement, but more often the eggs are unfertile ;
when this happens, the male bird should be changed for another. This
species is very migratory, and once it takes to flight it quickly
disappears.
Bewick's Swan ( C . bewicki) resembles the above-mentioned but
is decidedly smaller, besides having the yellow spots much diminished,
not extending beyond the nostrils. It has been bred occasionally. It
is as quarrelsome as the other species.
The Black-necked Swan (C. melanocoryphus) is a South
American species with striking plumage. Its body is white, head and
neck black with white - eyebrows ; bill bluish grey and a large red
wattle. It does very well in confinement, but should have a shelter in
winter lest its feet get frozen. The cygnets have a pretty habit of
climbing on to the backs of their parents by means of their bills and
taking refuge under their wing-feathers, leaving their heads outside.
They are somewhat delicate, need fine weather, and plenty of water-
weed. The female is the smaller, but has a wattle.
The Black Swan (Chenopsis atrata ) is greyish black, with the wing-

coverts streaked and white flights ; its bill is red. It breeds very freely
in captivity, and is very pugnacious, but not very powerful, and a
Canadian Goose can stand up to it. The female is smaller and has a
shorter neck than her mate. It raises its wings like the Mute Swan;
when flying it makes a peculiar but musical noise. It is a native of
Australia. It will not stay if full-winged.
The Coscoroba Swan (Coscoroba coscoroba) is probably only a huge
Dendrocygna , which it resembles in shape, but its size and colour have
caused it to be provisionally placed among the Swans. It is white with
black-tipped wings and red bill. Its feet are thick and pink. It is an
inhabitant of South America. Unfortunately this handsome species is
tender, needing very pure water, plenty of natural food and shelter
in winter. Its eggs should be hatched under a hen and the young
reared on duckweed and fresh grass. Should the Swan wish to sit
she may be given Ducks' eggs, but she is so excitable that she
seldom rears them. In this species the sexes are alike, but the female is
the smaller. It has a curious, rather low voice, and when annoyed
slightly ruffles up its wings.

In January, 1926, I got from Chapman a pair of Francolins from
Abyssinia. These were turned straight into a large aviary, with only an
open shed for shelter, in which enclosure they have been ever since.
This has proved them to be hardy birds, which one would rather expect
to be the case, as I believe they come from the highland districts of
North-East Africa, where the temperature at times must be very low.
They proved to be quiet and inoffensive birds with the other occupants
of the aviary, mostly Waders, and were well able to look after them-
selves, ignoring the sham attacks of the breeding Ruffs. On 1st May
I found the hen sitting on five eggs. These were cream-coloured, with a
few small pink spots. The eggs were shaped like those of the Sand
Grouse, being equally rounded at each end ; the shells were extra-

ordinarily thick. On the 24th two young were hatched, these were like
little Partridges, but rather larger. Both birds looked after them by day,
but the hen took sole charge by night, the cock retiring to roost in a
willow over the pond. The little ones grew slowly, but were soon able
to fly. At the time of writing they are about the size of Quails, and are
very strong on the wing. Size about the same as the Red-legged
Partridge. Colour above brown, each feather more or less pencilled
with a darker shade; underside bullish ; throat spotted with
chestnut ; a conspicuous white eyebrow stripe ; feathers on head
erectile. Both sexes are alike, but the male has spurs.

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.984286894736842" page_id="56773350"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
1793, and was thought to be a variety of A. pullaria. It, however,
received recognition as a separate species in 1817, under the name
Psittacus roseicollis , and its present title was bestowed on it in 1852.
The Zoological Gardens received their first specimen in 1862, probably
the year of the first importation. Roseicollis has been imported
frequently since, but in small numbers, and is at present rather scarce,
very few having arrived since 1914.
The Peach-faced is fairly popular with aviculturists, as it nests
quite readily, but unfortunately it has two drawbacks which lose it
many friends, namely its high-pitched, oft-repeated shriek and its
spitefulness towards other birds. Two pairs of Peach-faced should on
no account be kept together, and it is not advisable to trust them with
smaller and weaker birds. The sexes are somewhat similar, but the hen
differs from the cock in the slightly paler red colouring of the frontal
patch, which is usually more restricted, also the rosy colour extends
further towards the breast in the male than in the female. This member
of the family has been bred on many occasions. Dr. Brehm was success-
ful in Germany as long ago as 1882. The first recorded success in Great
Britain was that of Mr. J. Cronkshaw, who reared two young in 1895 ;

Mrs. Prestiuich--Lovebirds
Mr. Cocksedge bred eight in 1899. More recent successes are those of
the late Dr. Lovell-Keays, Dr. Amsler, Mr. T. Hebb, Mr. H. E. Bright,
Mr. E. J. Boosey, and the Marquess of Tavistock. They take readily to
nest-boxes or hollow logs, which they proceed to cram with strips of
bark, hay, grass, etc., carried in the usual manner under the feathers of
the lower back or upper tail-coverts. The number of eggs varies from
five to seven, which the hen alone incubates, being fed by the cock.
Three broods are frequently produced, and even more, Dr. Russ states
that when not prevented, six and even seven broods have been produced
in succession. After three nests their activities should be discouraged
for a time. Incubation appears to take nineteen to twenty days,
and the eggs, which are rather pointed, measure approximately
23-5 mm. X 17-5 mm. The young have no red colour on the forehead,
which is yellowish ; the rose colour of the cheeks and throat very pale.
Insectivorous food can be provided with advantage when young are
being fed, and some parents partake of this quite freely, suggesting
that in the wild state insect food forms part of their diet.
Little information is available as to the habits of this species in
the wild state, but Andersson in his Birds of Damaraland, writes as
follows : " This species is always observed in small flocks, and seldom
far away from water, to which it resorts at least once a day, and is
consequently not a bad guide to a thirsty traveller ; though, if he be
inexperienced it would hardly avail him much, as it frequently happens
that the drinking places resorted to by this and other water-loving birds
are but of small compass and strangely situated.
" This species is very swift of flight, and the little flocks in which it
is observed seem to flash upon the sight as they change their feeding-
grounds or pass to and from their drinking-place ; their flight, however,
is only for a comparatively short distance at a time. They utter rapid
and shrill notes when on the wing, or when suddenly disturbed or
alarmed. Their food consists of large berries and berry-like seeds."
Andersson then proceeds to make a statement which has caused
much controversy :--
" This bird does not make any nest of its own, but takes possession
of those belonging to other birds, especially the Social Weaver Bird
(Philceterus socius) and the White-browed Weaver Bird ( Ploceipasser

mahali). I cannot say whether it forcibly ejects the rightful owners of
these nests or merely occupies such as have been abandoned, but in
the case of the first-named species, I have seen the Parrots and Weaver
Birds incubating in about equal numbers under the shelter of the same
friendly roof."
Mr. Seth-Smith probably provides the true solution in his standard
book, ParraJceets. On page 147, he writes :--
44 Although we cannot doubt Andersson's statement that the huge
nests of the Social and White-browed Weaver Birds are often used by
Agapornis roseicollis as nesting places, his contention that this species
builds no nest of its own cannot be accepted by those who have known
the bird under more or less natural conditions in large aviaries in this
country and on the Continent.
" There is little doubt that the enormous umbrella-shaped nests of
the Weaver Birds, which are described as consisting of 4 whole cartloads
of grass ', are used merely as receptacles for the nests of the Lovebirds,
possibly in districts where large trees, containing suitable holes and
crevices for nests, are scarce." Some aviculturists have managed to
keep Peach-faced in large cages and have even induced them to breed,
but unless the cages are of very exceptional size, sooner or later they
develop into 44 feather-pluckers ". The Marquess of Tavistock has
tried this species at liberty, but found that it did not stay well.
A very interesting variety of the Peach-faced was received at the
Zoo in 1921 ; the rosy tint of the cheeks had spread over nearly the
whole of the body, so that the bird was rosy-pink over the greater part
of its plumage.
The ever-popular and accommodating Budgerigar has been used
successfully on several occasions to hatch the deserted eggs of Roseicollis.
Dr. Russ had young reared in this way, and M. P. Paillard, of
Bordeaux, met with similar success. Incidentally, Mr. J. W. Marsden,
a Blue Budgerigar pioneer, once had a Black-cheeked Lovebird fledgling
successfully reared by Budgerigars. In conclusion, the only 44 talking "
Lovebird I ever heard of was a Peach-faced, hand-reared by
Dr. Amsler. This bird, whenever he had misbehaved himself by giving
an extra hard nip, would say 44 Naughty Joey ! " quite distinctly.

So far as foreign birds are concerned, the breeding season of 1927
seems to have been a very bad one. The early part was abnormally
dry with cold winds, a condition that is most unfavourable. Clear
eggs, or no eggs at all, or young birds dead in the shell were reported
from most aviaries. And when the damp weather came there was
rain to excess with very little sunshine and a low temperature.
Mr. Walter Goodfellow has just returned home with a collection
of choice birds, amongst which may be mentioned 3 Twelve-wired
Birds of Paradise, 2 Red Birds of Paradise, 1 Lesser Bird, 2 Wilson's,
1 Magnificent, mostly adult males in full plumage ; 1 Great Black
Cockatoo, 2 Pesquet's Parrots, male and female ; 1 Goflin's Cockatoo,
7 Varied Lorikeets, 8 Black-capped Fruit Doves, 5 Tver on vernans,
an Owl (Huhua orientalis). Most of these birds are in beautiful plumage
and bear testimony to the great care that has been bestowed upon
them during the voyage.
The Ibis for July contains two papers of interest to aviculturists.
Both are from the pen of Mr. F. E. Blaauw, who describes the successful
breeding at Gooilust, Holland, of the Blue-winged Goose of Abyssinia
(Cyanochen cyanopterus) and the Bare-eyed Cockatoo (Cacatua
gynopis) during 1926. Of the first of these little was known until
Mr. Blaauw obtained seven examples in 1923. He finds that they
are very nocturnal in their habits, nest-building, courting, and mating
all taking place during the night. Five eggs, of an elongated shape
and cream-coloured, were laid, and four goslings were hatched by a
domestic hen after thirty days' incubation, all being reared
successfully.
The Bare-eyed Cockatoos which bred were very old birds which
had previously lived in the Zoological Gardens of Hanover, but
probably never before had an opportunity of nesting. A single egg
was laid in a log nest. Only the female incubated, and a chick hatched
after three weeks, but did not leave the nest until 9 weeks' old,
when it was the image of its parents.

About thirty Members of the Society met at the Zoological Gardens
on 8th July, and took tea together, afterwards visiting the Small
Bird House and other places of interest to aviculturists. It was very
pleasant to meet members who one has only known by correspondence,
and to discuss the many problems that confront aviculturists. Most
fortunately the weather was ideal.
In a few months' time the large collection of birds in the Small
Bird House at the Zoological Gardens will be transferred to their
new quarters in the old Reptile House, which&amp;apos;is being converted into
an up-to-date Bird House. There will be some twenty large wall
cages suitable for Toucans or Birds of Paradise, three very large
central aviaries, and some thirty or more small cages, while on the
south and west sides of the house will be a number of outdoor aviaries.
The house will be well lighted by electricity, both ordinary and " sun-
light " lamps being employed during dull weather, while palm-trees
and hanging baskets of ferns will add to the beauty of the house,
which will provide far better accommodation for the birds than they
enjoy at present.
Amongst the new arrivals at the Zoological Gardens are two
examples of the fine Derbyan Parrakeet (Palceornis derhyana) from
China, one of which has been presented to the Society by Mr. Eustace,
the other acquired by purchase. It is long since an example of this
fine species, a coloured plate of which we published in June, 1926,
has been represented in the collection. Both are males, one in perfect
plumage, the other showing signs of melanism on the head.
Mr. Allen Silver has recently constructed a very useful series of
aviaries which he believes to be mouse- and rat-proof as well as escape-
proof, the birds being fed from outside window-doors without the
necessity of the owner entering. Before completion, however, some
Grey and Green Singing-finches did escape, but they did not go away,
and when shown a cage with a millet-spray inside entered at once.
Mr. Silver believes that in a cat-proof garden the Grey Singing-finch
would stay and make a very tame and delightful pet. They are so

drawback to this kind of aviculture is that the birds are apt to be
taken by cats or owls, both the Tawny and Little Owl being very
destructive.

Sir,-- I am sending you a line to say that one young Barbet
(Abyssinian) left the nest yesterday, and in spite of flying straight into
some hot water as hot as I could bear my hands in, with which I was
washing some pans, seems none the worse to-day, and the parents
are still feeding it assiduously. I regret to say the other I found
dead on its back below the nest to-day--between the seed-box and the
wall; I suppose it came out of the nest this morning, got in there, and
could not get on to its legs; it is bad luck. I examined the nesting block
--no nest, no eggs, or remains of any, and very clean. Yet I never saw
the old birds bring out excrement, but they must have done so. They
fed the young for choice on mealworms, but used a great number of
gentles and possibly a certain amount of currants and soft food
mixture, also any other insects they could get, including dead blue-
bottles, which we gave them. I only hope they may nest again as
I should like to see the eggs. Am I the first to have bred them ? Please
use any of above you think fit for the Magazine. I regret to say have
had rotten luck with Nyasas ; had four young birds in nest--three
flew this week ; about a day after I found one on floor with head
bashed in, another dead next day plump as a Partridge and no sign of
mishap, and the fourth is neither in the nest nor elsewhere to be seen--
so one out of four remains !
John S. Reeve.
25th June, 1927.
[To breed any species of Barbet in captivity is a great achievement
and there is little doubt that Captain Reeve is the first to succeed
with Trockyphonus margaritatus. Writing on 15th July he says that
the young bird is feeding itself, and it may therefore be considered
as fully reared. --Ed.]

Sir,- -- I was much interested in Miss Knobel's article on the Smaller
Macaws. I have never kept any of the varieties described, but I have
kept a number of the larger ones : these seem to vary in disposition
almost as much as the Grey Parrot, although I think on the whole these
are less really bad screamers ; the best-tempered one I have had was
a Red and Yellow, with whom one could do almost anything. This
was closely rivalled by a Blue and Yellow, who quite made up for
occasional playful nips by being quite a good, if somewhat monotonous
talker. It is very fond of saying in a most sorrowful tone " Poor
La La ", and then looking round for approval. One curious habit
I have noticed with all Parrots, but more especially with Macaws,
is the way they open and close the iris with great rapidity, especially
when excited.
I have only had one Macaw that I really could do nothing with :
that was a Blue and Yellow, but I rather fancy it was caught as an
old bird. Macaws make charming pets in many ways, but they are
rather noisy and appallingly destructive.
By far the tamest Parrot I have ever had is a Hawkhead ; when I
first had her, she was extremely nervous, but with a little coaxing
she became very tame. A favourite game is to play dead, and she
will lie on her back on one's hand and go perfectly limp and will allow
herself to be passed from hand to hand. She behaves very much as
described in Green's Parrots in Captivity, except that she has never
shown any sign of talking or even trying to talk. All day she keeps
up a sort of " Chuck " noise, but when excited it becomes much higher
pitched and very rapid ; occasionally she whistles odd notes, but has
never tried to make a tune. She is most acrobatic and very quick,

with none of the laborious caution of the Grey Parrot, preferring rather
to jump than climb. At night she sleeps in a box attached to the door
of her cage. She always retires at about 7 p.m., even when it is light
in the evenings.
She does well on a good plain Parrot mixture with a little apple
or toast crust occasionally.
Apparently the crest is only thrown up after preening the feathers
or when defending itself ; she will terrify my Grey Parrot if it interferes
by throwing up her crest and giving short, sharp hisses.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969547111111111" page_id="56773357"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- One bird which was of special interest, from a spectacular
point of view, has been accidentally omitted from the list of birds of
prey published in the Magazine for June and July ; and as it was very
interesting when alive on account of the dark brown erectile crest on
its head and the long loud cry it uttered (rather like that of Pel's Owl,
see 1921 Yob, p. 154), a brief account from an old note-book may be of
interest to readers. It reads " Beautiful Wood Hawk (Dryotriorchis
spectahilis) from Lagos. Scalp, back, wings, tail, dark brown with
broad transverse darker bars on wing quills. Beak black. Face
around eyes and throat, pale brown, with dark moustache at each side
and a narrower dark median streak on throat. Breast and abdomen
pale brown, with dark broad transverse bars. Legs yellow. Well-
marked dark brown erectile crest. Utters long loud cry."
It was a largish bird, rather Buzzard-like in body appearance
excluding crest, and was in the Eastern Aviary of the Zoological
Gardens about the year 1906. So far as I know, it unfortunately
did not live long. I believe the first exhibited.

By J. Delacour
From the time of its discovery in 1895 up to 1915, when three more
specimens were found in Siam, this fine bird had only been known
through the three original specimens sent to the Paris Museum by
Father Renauld, from Central Annam. It is one of the rarest birds
in skin collections.
Since I have undertaken the ornithological exploration of French
Indo-China, in connexion with my friend M. P. Yabouille, Civil Officer
and presently Travelling Commissioner in Annam, we have procured
a number of Ground Cuckoos, several of which are now alive in our
aviaries at Hue (Annam) and four in our President's aviaries at
Foxwarren.
Of the latter I brought one home in 1926, the first to reach Europe
alive. It was sent by me to Cleres with another one in April of that
year. Both birds travelled quite well, and arrived safely, although
their plumage was rather damaged ; unfortunately, one got its leg
broken and had to be killed, as it had lost it whole, being otherwise
quite healthy. The sound specimen was soon put into an outdoor

aviary, where it slept in the open from June to October, keeping in
perfect health in spite of our very cold Normandy nights. To my
surprise, it never molested the other birds which inhabited the same
flight; Eheinardt's, Argus, young Sonnerets, Jungle Fowl, different
Pigeons and Doves, and even Waxbills, which Coucals, their near
relatives, would have most certainly eaten in similar circumstances.
It moulted in July and since has been in perfect feather. It became
very tame during the sea voyage, and now takes food from one's
fingers. Last spring I brought three more.
Ground Cuckoos are quite easy to cater for ; at liberty, they feed
on all kinds of worms, grubs, insects, and small vertebrates ; in captivity
they eat cut-up meat, earthworms, mealworms, and insectivorous
mixture, even bread and boiled maize.
The present plate, drawn from life, is worth any lengthened descrip-
tion, and I shall only add to it that Eenauld's Ground Cuckoos average
a total length of 28 inches, about the size of an ordinary pheasant.
From our investigations, it appears that this species inhabits
the whole of French Indo-China and the south and east of Siam. It
may not be as rare as it is generally thought, as it is a very shy bird.
Very little is known on the bird's habits at liberty ; they live in the
thickest jungle, where undergrowth, entangled vine, and boulders
make it most impenetrable. Only once did we see one flying low across
the path, at the Col de Nuages, in Central Annam, one of their favourite
haunts. Chicks remain unknown so far, though eggs have been laid
in Mr. Ezra's aviaries. This Cuckoo's ordinary voice is a low grunt
but it also utters sometimes a whistling call, resembling that of
the Argus Pheasant or the Brown Owl.
It is rather difficult at first to keep several Ground Cuckoos in the
same aviary, as they are rather quarrelsome at the beginning ; but
it can be done, and we have kept six in two aviaries, four in one
and two in another one.
It would be most desirable to breed these rare birds in captivity,
as there is little chance, owing to their retiring habits, of ever finding
their nests at liberty.

This very rare bird has been a source of great interest to me. The
single specimen brought over last year has done very well, in spite
of the long wet winter. Again this year, M. Delacour very kindly
brought me three more of these rare birds. All the four birds were put
into a large aviary. As they all look alike I thought I could sex them
in time, by Watching them, and their behaviour to one another. As
far as I can make out, I have two pairs, but of this I am not quite sure.
Although not very friendly, they are not really spiteful with one another.
They fly about a good deal and perch sometimes, but most of the
time they are on the ground. They eat a good deal of meat and earth-
worms and are very fond of mice, and sometimes will swallow as many
as four one after another. They are delightful aviary birds, and quite
hardy and easy to keep in an aviary, where they will not molest the
smallest bird. On 3rd July the boy, while feeding the birds in the
aviary, found an egg under a small tree in a nest consisting of a few
twigs and leaves. This egg disappeared about an hour after it was seen
and most probably it was eaten up by some of the other occupants
of the aviary. I don't quite know who the culprit was, but as the
aviary is occupied by Babblers, Boilers, Rails, and Starlings, I &amp;m not
surprised that the egg disappeared. The same evening I caught up all
the above birds, leaving the four Cuckoos by themselves, with only a few
harmless birds. On the 4th another egg was laid. This egg I removed
at once from the nest, and sent to Lord Rothschild, as I believe it is
the first known egg of this bird. I noticed that all four birds were
carrying twigs and leaves to the same nest. On the 6th of July I
found another egg in the nest. This egg the birds Were allowed to
incubate, and I am certain that three out of the four birds sat. They
incubated steadily for ten days, when this egg also disappeared, and
most probably was eaten by the birds themselves. The egg looks very
much like that of a Bantam, but is rather rounder, white in colour
with a rough shell. If they winter safely, I hope to be more successful

The Black-cheeked Lovebird was discovered by Dr. A. H. B.
Kirkman, on the Muguazi River, in September, 1904. The first small
collection, consisting of five birds, arrived in England, via Germany,
in April, 1908. Three of the five went to the late Mr. Reginald
Phillipps, and the remaining pair to the late Mr. H. D. Astley ; the
latter pair formed the subject of an excellent coloured plate in the
Avicultural Magazine, October, 1908. Further small collections
subsequently arrived, and Black-cheeks proved excellent among
birds and free-breeders.
During the years of the war the species almost died out in England,
and pairs were practically unobtainable. Last year, however,
Mr. Chapman received several very large consignments, and Black-
cheeks* would seem to be well-established once more. Some little
difficulty is experienced in obtaining true pairs, as the sexes are so very
alike. Mr. Phillipps, after exhaustive observation, came to the con-
clusion that the only way to sex them with any degree of certainty
was by noting the colour of the iris, which differs in the two sexes&gt;
that of the male being pale yellow-brown, and of the female dark
yellow-brown. This difference probably proves correct in many
instances, but cannot be relied on as an infallible guide, as the iris
will vary in colour in any particular bird according to its state of health,
age, light, and various other causes. When a number are seen together
pairs can be picked out with certainty by observing the shape of their
heads and beaks, which are noticeably broader across the top in the
males. The female would also appear to be slightly smaller and

duller in colouring, the forehead and front of crown is darker and
duller ; the orbital ring narrower ; the beak less suffused at base
with white ; while the front edge of the wing is slightly yellow in the
male and green in the female.
Black-cheeks nest very readily, and I have before me the names of
some twenty successful breeders. Mr. Phillipps was the first, a pair
of his original three birds went to nest about two months after their
arrival, laid four eggs, all of which hatched and the young reared.
Mr. Phillipps has written in a most interesting manner on A. nigrigenis,
and members should refer to his various accounts in the Avicultural
Magazine as follows New Series, Yol. VI (1908), pp. 206-10, 318-29 ;
Yol. YII (1909), pp. 31-6, 148-56.
The nesting arrangements are similar to those of A. roseicollis ,
except that the nesting material is usually carried in the beak, the
bulk of the work being done by the female. The eggs vary considerably
in shape, but are usually rather elongated and pear-shaped and
approximately measures 22&amp;apos;3 mm. by 16*9 mm. The usual clutch is
four, but the females seem to be in the habit, after disposing of the
first clutch, to lay immediately an additional three in the same nest.
The female alone incubates for seventeen to eighteen days, the male
not seeming to feed her until after the young are hatched. The
following description of the young is taken from one of Mr. Phillipps'
articles (Avicultural Magazine, 1909, pp. 33-4):--
" It was on 23rd July that I first saw a young bird in the nest.
One could only see a portion of the inside, but a nestling a few days
old was visible. On the 26th I saw two nearly naked little things
squatting side by side, like a couple of young pigeons. On the 29th,
Mr. Seth-Smith inspected the nest, and reported four young of different
ages, all right. On 4th August I just noticed a touch of colour, one
sturdy youngster having a pale yellow-red beak. On the 12th, the
crowns of the nestlings had all the appearance of being fully feathered.
On 13th August the two elder, after playing 'possum for a moment,
stood boldly up, raising their heads towards the opening. Along
their backs and down their necks there were the usual tracks of feathers
but they were far from being fully covered ; their tails, less than an
inch being visible, showed the subterminal band of black quite well

marked, especially in the eldest, where the markings were of a deeper
black and much more clearly defined. The forehead showed the colour
of the adult, or seemed to ; and the salmon-red patch on the chest was
conspicuous. The nostrils were quite covered and hidden; I could
not manage to get a glint of light on to an eye--in the shade of the log,
the irides seemed to be quite black.
" The first young bird to leave the nest appeared on 22nd August;
but, for a few days at any rate, he returned to the nest after a short
outing. No. 2, I think a female, appeared on the 25th. The green
of the general plumage of these two birds was at first very dull, but
rapidly became brighter, and the flanks yellower ; the breast-patch
at first was very bright ; the brown of the forehead extended farther
back in " A " than in " B ", and then there came some green or greenish.
The black on the sides of the chin seemed to be as deep as in the parents,
but only a little colouring extended upwards behind the eyes. The
head of " B " seemed to be broader than that of " A ", and, although
the younger, " she " seemed to be the larger bird. But all the
differences of shading quickly assumed a dull level--the young and the
old became very much alike. Even the yellow in the red of the beaks
of the fledglings seems to have gone. No. 3 had joined the group on
the 27th, as usual in the quiet of the early morning ; and the fourth and
last came out on the following day, carefully tended by one of its
parents. I think the latter must have been " hurried " out of the
log, for it Was less forward than the others, and was fed by the male
for some days after the others were feeding themselves. They quickly
took to nibbling at green food, but on and from the 30th the three were
feeding on dry seed, etc., with their father."
I am afraid the foregoing is rather long, but it seemed of sufficient
interest to stand reprinting.
Black-cheeks are exceptionally shy when breeding and on no account
should the nest be interfered with in any way. The young in the nest
appear to be practically mute, neither calling for food nor audibly
responding to its arrival.
Among the more successful with this species may be mentioned
the late Mr. H. W. Mathias, the late Dr. Lovell Keays, Capt. G. E.
Battigan, Mr. J. Sumner Marriner, Mr. H. Willford, and Mr. W. Shore-

Baily, the last-named having been extraordinarily fortunate in the
number bred.
The Marquess of Tavistock has tried this species at liberty and
found that although it readily nested it almost invariably migrated
in August or September after breeding.
Black-cheeks agree well together and with other members of the
family ; non-nesting pairs, however, seem inclined to interfere with
the young of nesting pairs.

A basket is required 14 inches long, 6 or 7 wide, and 6 inches deep,
closed with a lid, with a stick that runs through the wicker staples.
It should be of a light wicker-work, so as to be airy. Have two squares
of mackintosh for the bottom of the basket, and keep one dozen flannel
squares for loose lining. Lift the young birds out of the nest in the
aviary from time to time, to see their stage of growth, and take the one
(or the two) you intend to rear while still in down, with the feathers in
quills, the colour just showing, while the bird is at the age when it is
ready to gape for food, and can raise itself on its feet. Two are easier
to rear than one ; for they keep each other warm.
Place one rubber square in, and lay one of the flannel squares into
the basket loosely ; have more of the flannel under the birds than
over them ; there should only be one light " flap-over " of the flannel
to cover them, and as they get older they will not need even this. It is
essential they should be in a warm hole with air round them, rather
than folded closely. They must be able to potter about, inside the
flannel-lined basket and not be swaddled tight.
Between the wall of the basket and the flannel, keep a fresh bit of
brown bread in a wisp of tissue paper, so that it keeps clean, and that
you may always have it handy. Bite a little up into small bits, and
moisten it well in your mouth, and when it is in a soft, porridgy con-

dition, it is ready to give to the birds. Lift the one you want to feed,
and hold it carefully in both hands, place its bill between your lips.
It if does not take at once, touch its bill with your lips lightly. Never
close your lips over its nostrils. Place its bill to your lips sideways.
If they both take well, you can rear them ; if only one does so, put
the other back in the nest, and try another bird, who may take food
better.
Brown bread, mouth-moistened--almost fluid--is enough at first;
but as they get older you must mix it with little mouthsful of bitten
and peeled apple--or chewed lettuces--or the pulp of grapes, or bananas
and a hard-boiled egg occasionally.
Even from the first, small drinks of warm water are good. As
they get older this is essential. You will know when they want feeding
by their calling for it. Never force them to feed, but persuade them ;
once they get the habit they will let you know when they need it.
For the first four or five days feed them every three hours or so. I took
mine about with me in its basket, while it was still in down--and when
in the house it is wise to take the basket from room to room with one,
so that one can hear them when they need feeding.
Change the flannel squares repeatedly ; it is important to keep them
clean ; be sure the clean squares you put in are quite dry. When their
feet got clotted at all, I stood them for a minute or so in a soap dish
of warm water.
Do not line the basket with hay, as this fosters disease of their
lungs. Let them have exercise as they get older ; climbing about your
lap and up to your shoulders.
Be very careful not to let them drop out of your hands, nor let the
basket drop ; a fall kills a bird from shock. I think this is why
fledglings picked up in spring, having fallen from the nest, so seldom
live. I tied a label on to the handle of my basket with a big notice--
with care--live bird. This protects them from tidying housemaids,
and being casually shifted or jarred in ignorance. When almos^
fully plumed four meals a day suffice--but leave a millet spray in the
basket. Let the basket stand somewhere near your bed, so that you
can hear them when they wake, and feed them. I found that mine
slept till seven a.m., or later. When feeding them, always give a little

at a time ; and take time over it. Feeding three, I found, took twenty
minutes.
At a month old they should have millet in the spray put in their
basket with them, so that they can nibble the seed when they like.
They should often be lifted out of the basket and allowed to potter
about ; they like to stretch their wings, which they repeatedly do,
strengthening the muscles in preparation for flight, by winnowing
the air.
The advantage of bringing up by hand in this manner is that you
have birds so absolutely and entirely tame that you are able to know
them from a new angle. You see their ways, their movements, their
pretty loves and jealousies, their playfulness, and their exquisite
beauty, at close range. And all their feelings they expend on you,
flying to meet you as you enter the aviary, and not only tame to you,
but regarding all humans as their friends. In fact, it is a question
if birds thus reared will mate. They appear to become disoriented
from their own kind. This is true of the bird I reared last year ; but
it may be because I reared one, by itself.
It will be interesting to see if this will be the case equally of the
three I have reared this year. They have now grown to full size, and
are in no whit different from the three I left to the parent birds, except
in the matter of tameness.
The parent birds were given me two years ago by Lord Tavistock ;
they bred the first year I had them, hatching three out of four eggs ;
but the only one that lived was the one I took to bring up by hand.
At the next attempt in their breeding I had the great advantage of
Lord Tavistock's expert advice ; the male bird being one of his liberty-
trained birds, that can be released in the morning, returning to an
annexe of the breeding aviary through a wire funnel; a system that
has been, I believe, described by Lord Tavistock in the pages of this
magazine.
The female, he tells me, is an older bird than her mate, and bears
evidence of some years of previous life in a cage. She is certainly
tamer than he, and whistles a snatch of one of the more jaunty tunes
of the songs of Chevalier, but only in moments of stress or anxiety.
She sidles along the perch, if one looks at her young, whistling this tune

in hurried anguish, which gives a funny effect of conflict, just as you
might say " a merry Christmas " in a flood of tears. But her alarm
soon dissipates, and on the whole she trusts me, as indeed she may ;
for I would never take the whole clutch from her ; and, judging by
her decrease in vitality now, she has found rearing three birds sufficiently
exhausting.
The success we have had this year in hatching these six young
Bock Peplars, the full clutch of eggs, I attribute entirely to having
had the great advantage of Lord Tavistock's advice in the matter of
the right kind of nest-box, as well as in other nesting details. He
recommended a tall construction in appearance like a grandfather's
clock, filled up to within a foot and a half from the hole with dry wood
pith--the light, porous stuff you find inside a hollow tree that is invaded
by decay. The hen nested in April, the eggs hatched on the 18th of
May. I took the three young I intended to rear by hand out of the nest
on the 5th of June, and freed them into another larger aviary on the
7th of July, flying well and able to feed themselves.
Of the three I left to the parent birds to rear, one already flies
free, with its father returning through the funnel, to feed ; and I shall
bring the other two on to do the same. The extreme beauty of these
birds in flight cannot be described. I have not a wide experience,
but among the species of the Parrot tribe that I do know, I give the
Bock Peplars the palm, for they are without the two great disabilities
of their race--they are not noisy, and their beaks are too soft to be able
to hurt. They have also a further quality of grace--one by no means
of small account in the communal life of an aviary--they are gentle
and peaceful birds, and do not molest their neighbours.

lias been the evidence of the overwhelming superiority of the perpen-
dicular hollow tree trunk with a natural bottom or with no bottom at
all, the cavity being filled up to the required height with earth and
mould taken from the interior of a decaying tree. Hollow tree trunks
are terribly heavy and cumbersome to move and often difficult to
obtain, but the results more than justify their use in districts where
the climate is none too favourable to aviculture. When first I started
my birds in the new movable aviaries I provided artificial nest-boxes
with wooden bottoms covered with a layer of dry, decayed wood and
hung up in the flight. Those for Kings and Crimson-wings were nearly
6 ft. deep and the bottom rested on the ground. In these boxes the
first season I bred two or three lots of very healthy Kingnecks, a few
healthy Barrabands, and one healthy Rock Peplar. Kings and Crimson-
wings, however, were a dismal failure, the young either dying of
pneumonia at an early age or becoming hopelessly rickety about the
time they began to feather. One young Crimson-wing was bred in a
natural tree trunk with an artificial wooden bottom. When she left
the nest she was so rickety that she was quite unable to fly and could
scarcely crawl and remained in this condition for several weeks ; but
strange to say she slowly improved and in the end became quite
a decent bird with good use of her limbs : indeed, I believe she
eventually laid eggs. This proves that it was her early environment
and not inherited weakness of constitution that was the cause of her
feebleness. The two following seasons yielded less satisfactory results
with the birds using the artificial boxes. In only one out of four
Barraband nests were all the young reared. One hen, though a good
and attentive mother, lost all her brood from pneumonia at about
ten days ; another lost three out of four, a third two out of four. The
Rock Peplar, also an excellent parent, lost all her young and a breeding
pair of Ringnecks died of pneumonia while laying. The Crimson-wings,
however, in natural tree trunks with natural bottoms or hollows half
filled with mould, reared vigorous young with no sign of weakness.
Next year, in the hope of preventing losses from pneumonia, I put
artificial boxes in the aviary shelters which were very warm and dry.
Many-colours, Blue-winged Grass-Parrakeets and Yellow-rumps reared
healthy young under these conditions, but in the main the experiment

was a failure. All the young Ringnecks, Barrabands and Rock Peplars
died of pneumonia quicker than they had done in the flights, and young
Browns, Crimson-wings and Ringnecks were crippled with rickets,
although they had nearly a foot of earth at the bottom of their nests,
separating them from the wooden floor. As on the former occasion,
however, the Crimson-wings made surprising progress when they were
taken out of the aviary shelter.
This season I substituted Vita glass for ordinary glass in all the
shelters, and removed the trays at the bottom when the birds were
breeding, admitting far more air and moisture. These alterations
were, in the main, Useless so long as natural perpendicular tree trunks
were not employed. Two pairs of Ringnecks had artificial boxes in
the shelters. One lot of young died when a few days old ; the others
died of rickets soon after leaving the nest, though they were nice strong
birds at the start. Another pair had a natural log hung horizontally
in the shelter. The hen--a good mother--lost both her broods when
a few days old. Yellow-rumps were given a bottomless, mould-filled,
perpendicular box in the shelter for their first nest, and in it reared
five strong young. For their second nest they had a horizontal natural
log in the shelter and the young died when a few days old. But in a
similar log, similarly placed, Rosellas reared a healthy brood. A Red-
rump Parrakeet paired to a Hooded had an artificial box in the shelter
with the trays left in. Her two young hybrids lived to fend for them-
selves, but were weak on the wing and are now dead.
The Rock Peplar had a bottomless, mould-filled perpendicular
box in the shelter, and lost her young of pneumonia when about
ten days old. Another hen who laid on the ground in the open flight
reared a strong brood.
Crimson-wings lost their first brood in a rather small, draughty,
bottomless natural log in the open flight, but reared a second brood
well in a good tree trunk in the flight.
Malabars reared a strong brood in the shelter in a natural perpen-
dicular tree trunk with a natural bottom. Barrabands reared a strong
brood in a bottomless, mould-filled perpendicular box in the flight.
The results go to prove that the natural perpendicular tree trunk
with natural bottom or mould gives good results either in flight or

shelter, preferably in the former, for hardy species not subject to egg-
binding. The artificial box with no bottom but partly filled with mould
may give good results with the hardier species but in the shelter it is
no Use for Rock Peplars.
The horizontal natural log is, in the shelter, little better than the
artificial box and will only do for very hardy birds and for species (oddly
enough in most other ways delicate), which, like Many-colours and
Grass Parrakeets, are resistant to the normal ill-effect of the combina-
tion of artificial box and shelter. Pneumonia is not encouraged by the
moist and mouldy character of the interior of a natural tree trunk,
and it is not in the least discouraged by the Use of disinfectants, nor
by the extreme dryness of the nest and its immediate surroundings.
Rickets seem primarily due to artificial wooden floors, even when these
are covered with a thick layer of earth, and it makes no difference
whether the nest stands out in the fresh air and sunshine or whether
it is in a dark place with a closer atmosphere : diet makes no difference
either. Experiences with Crimson-wings are especially telling. Hen
No. 1 in 1921 reared in the flight a rickety young one in a natural
tree trunk with an artificial wooden bottom. In 1922 and 1923 she
reared healthy young in the flight in a perpendicular tree trunk with
a natural bottom. In 1924 she lost hybrid young by a Princess of
Wales' Parrakeet in an artificial box in the flight. In 1925 she reared
healthy hybrids in the natural tree trunk which had been the scene of
her previous successes. Hen No. 2 in 1926 had rickety young in a
box in the shelter and, after a failure in a rather poor log, reared
healthy young in a perpendicular mould-filled tree trunk in the flight
in 1927. Results may be summed up as follows :--

of brood died) 2, failures (entire brood died) 1, cases of rickets nil.

in, the aviary flight should be sure death to them in the aviary shelter.
In the case of Crimson-wings an artificial bottom to the nest is equally
fatal in flight or shelter.
I may say in conclusion that I do not suggest that my experiences
with nests need necessarily be those of all other aviculturalists. In
the healthier climate of Foxwarren Park, Mr. Ezra has reared healthy
young Barrabands under conditions which would be fatal here, and I
believe Madame Lecallier has reared Crimson-wings successfully in
artificial boxes--I wonder if she could tell us if these have wooden
bottoms ? However, it is probable that there would be a tendency
in most places for young birds to flourish, or the reverse, as mine have
done. I would particularly warn aviculturalists who lose young
Parrakeets in the nest not to be too ready to blame the weather and still
more not to be too ready to blame the parents, who are very seldom
guilty of neglect. In nine cases out of ten when young Parrakeets die
before they are fully fledged it is the fault of the owner who has provided
the old birds with an unsuitable breeding place.

By H. L. Sich
These birds are generally called Pyrrhulauda or Eremopteryx
leucotis, but the author of Birds Bred in Captivity says that they are
almost certainly the southern species, smithi, and mine are probably
the same. In the early part of 1925 a fair number were imported,
but all I could find in London were cocks ; however, by writing
to various dealers, I obtained a cock and two hens by 8th May. The
cock consorted with one hen, but drove the other one away ; this bird
showed a few black feathers on the lower part of the breast which
the other bird had not got. There was no further change when I let
my birds out into the flight of my new aviary at Worthing at the end of
May, 1926. These birds do not care for the grass and spend most of
their time on two gravelly patches just inside the two doors leading
from the passage into the flight ; in very dry weather they sometimes
go on to a strip of bare earth at one end. Under these circumstances

H. L. Sick--The White-cheeked Finch-lark
I have not found them very interesting. About the middle of June
last year I suddenly noticed that I had two full plumaged cocks, so
1 conclude that they take two years to reach maturity. If this bird
comes from the south of the Equator it may have been hatched about
November, 1924, which would make it about eighteen months.
When watching my birds on 9th June last I saw a harmless-looking
Turnix strolling over the grass : as it came close to the stem of a small
cupressus tree the pair of Finch-larks suddenly flew up and attacked
it, one bird perching on its back and pecking at its head ; this could
only mean a nest. On examination I found the cock bird squatting
on the ground just where the grass meets the soil close to the stem of
the tree. A yard in one direction the Turnix had a nest ; in the long
grass close by a hen Harlequin Quail was incubating seven eggs, due
to hatch in about a week. There was ho chance of a ground bird
rearing any young with a lot of Quail chicks scrambling over everything,
so a risk had to be taken. I formed a fence with wire-netting about
2 feet away all round the nest ; of course, the birds flew away during
the process, but a few minutes afterwards the hen was back again.
The nest was only a slight hollow, rather thickly lined with hay, and
contained only one egg, coloured very much like the dark brown
variety of that of a Skylark, much smaller, rather longer, and less
pointed in shape. Both birds incubated till 21st June. I fancied that
my going into the aviary to feed the Quail chicks had disturbed them,
but there was no signs of a chick in the egg when blown. On 23rd
June they were incubating one egg again, in the same nest. On 7th
July they had deserted it: there was no chick in that either. They
have not nested since. Only laying one egg seems rather curious, but
a single bird was reared in 1917 by Mr. Shore-Baily, and Avicultural
Magazine, August, 1924, pp. 183-4 : " Witherby found a nest above
Khartoum. . . It contained one egg." Perhaps insects to feed the young
with are scarce in their habitat, and one at a time is all they can
manage.
[The Southern White-cheeked Finch-lark bred successfully in the
London Zoological Gardens in 1917, and the accompanying photo-
graph shows the cock bird about to feed the two nestlings. The nest
was on the ground at the foot of a small bush. The young birds were

feathered in very dark brown, the feathers having paler brown tips,

STEAMER DUCKS AND SHEATHBILLS
AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983711230769231" page_id="56773392"  page_num="245" year="" vol="">
Through the kindness of Dr. Stanley Kemp and Mr. A. Gr. Bennett,
of the " Discovery ,5 expedition the Zoological Society has received
four examples of the Steamer Duck (Tachyeres cinereus) and five of the
Yellow-billed Sheathbill (Chionis alba) from the Falkland and South
Shetland Islands.
The Steamer Duck is a large, heavily built bird with a dark brownish
head and the body more or less spotted with grey, the bill of the drake
orange yellow and that of the duck greenish yellow, the feet also
being yellow. The under surface is white in both sexes. There would
appear to be two distinct types of this Duck, the one greyish in colour,
in fact in very old birds the head as well as the body becoming light
grey, the other type being mostly reddish in colour and smaller.
Moreover, the larger grey or greyish birds have short wings and are
flightless, whereas the smaller redder birds have longer wings and
are capable of flight.
The larger type is met with in the Straits of Magellan and the open
sea, whereas the smaller birds frequent more the inland lakes of Southern
South America. These two types or races of Steamer Duck have long
been a puzzle to ornithologists, for it is known that the one is not the
young of the other as has been suggested, and, moreover, it has been
observed that the two sometimes interbreed.
Steamer Ducks are so named on account of their habit of swimming
with great rapidity with the aid of both wings and feet, a mode of
progression that has been likened to " steaming 5? . They spend a good
deal of their time sitting on the rocks, and have their nests beneath the
cover of some bush or rock.

The bill of the Steamer Duck is very powerful and capable of
crushing shells such as mussels ; shell-fish, in fact, forming a consider-
able part of its food. On four occasions only has the species been
exhibited at the Zoological Gardens, the last being forty years ago.
The Sheathbills ( Chionis ), of which there are two if not three species,
superficially resemble large white pigeons, though in reality they are
related on the one hand to the Plovers and on the other to the Gulls.
But they are very distinct from all other existing species of birds.
Their bills are powerful and carry a peculiar sheath, the use of which
has never been satisfactorily determined, and the feet are not webbed.
C. alba inhabits the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, where it has
some three or four species of Penguins as its companions, and the eggs
of which form the chief food of its young. It is an omnivorous feeder,
a scavenger to which little comes amiss from Crustacea and sea-birds'
eggs to the excreta of Seals and Penguins.
Sheathbills have been imported previously on rare occasions,
but not for a number of years.

Macaws, she asks for experiences.
I had a Severe who could whistle and say " Come hon " : he hated
water, except to drink. He was pinioned when I got him, and in
summer-time he spent most of his time at liberty in the garden. If it
rained he made for the nearest shelter. One day a heavy shower came,
and I could not find him anywhere : after a time I heard his usual call,
" Come hon " ; he had climbed over the fence into the waterfowl
enclosure, and was sitting with a Duck under a nest-box. He was on
good terms with the fox terriers, so I had no fear of cats and vermin.
I have had two Spix Macaws. One, I think, was an adult-caught
bird and was never tame ; the other was very tame, but seldom made
a sound.

THE NESTING HABITS OF HONEY-GUIDES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99697376" page_id="56773394"  page_num="247" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Mr. Sydney Porter is to be envied his acquaintance with such a
charming bird as " William ", the Yellow-throated Honey-guide : at
the same time he is to be commiserated with, in that he was unable
to bring him back to England.
Concerning the parasitic nesting of Indicator, Lydekker writes
(Wild Life of the World, vol. iii, pp. 150, 151) :--
" According to a recent account, the widely distributed African
Yellow-throated Honey-guide ( Indicator major) in most cases makes
use of the nesting-hole of Spreo bicolor, a bird which, like the Honey-
guides themselves, lays white eggs. The Honey-guide's eggs are,
however, less elongated than those of its hosts, among which are certain
species of Swallows, as well as other birds laying white eggs. Whether
the Honey-guides lay more than one egg in the Spreo's nest is not
mentioned, but it is stated that these birds whenever possible break
the eggs of their hosts with their beaks, thus ensuring that their own
egg or eggs shall alone hatch. The most remarkable point connected
with this egg-breaking business is that the Spreos or other hosts should
continue to sit. Their parasitic habits being apparently well known,
the Honey-guides are in most cases fiercely attacked by the owners of
the nests visited, and in some cases the resistance prevents the intruders
from breaking the original eggs. In such instances the young Honey-
guides probably eject their fellow-nestlings, and it is noteworthy that
the beaks of the former are furnished with powerful hooks, which
disappear in the adult. This, it is conjectured, is a provision to assist
them in ejecting the other occupants of the nest. It has also been

noticed that a young Honey-guide taken from the nest of a Diamond
Sparrow (Petronia petronelia) was very large for its age; here again
exhibiting a Cuckoo-like feature. The mention of a single nestling
in this instance suggests that the Honey-guides lay only one egg in
a nest. As Indicator is common to Africa, Malaya, and the Himalaya,
it would be interesting to ascertain if the parasitic habits of the African
species are shared by their Asiatic cousins ; but as the Himalayan
bird is believed to lack the ' honey-guiding 5 habit of the South
African species, it may also differ in the matter of egg-laying. 55
Perhaps Mr. Porter, if he has had the opportunity of studying
the nesting habits of the Indicatoridse, would be so good as to comment
on the above, and make known his own observations.

Sir, --There is a slight error in Mrs. Prestwich's article, where I am
credited with finding the Peach-faced Lovebird a poor stayer at liberty.
It is the Black-cheeked that gave disappointing results. While I cannot

results with them when free in the garden. Many young were reared,
and the old birds did not appear to be migratory in the autumn.

THE DERBYAN PARRAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986295" page_id="56773395"  page_num="248" year="" vol="">
Sir, --With the acquisition of two new specimens by the Zoological
Society the number of this rare Parrakeet in captivity in this country
would appear to be raised to four. A male bird came into my possession
a few months ago, and has since done well. He was in perfect con-
dition on arrival, although he had evidently been closely confined for
a very long time as he had the cage-cramped habits of a bird which
has forgotten how to Use its wings or even climb. For several days
after he had been turned into an aviary it was necessary to hold his
seed and Water up to him on the perch, as he would have starved before
he ventured to descend the wire to the food dishes. He is perfectly

tame, and very amiable in disposition, having the little courtly
mannerisms characteristic of male Palceornis Parrakeets that have
been treated as pets. On the approach of a friend he keeps bowing and
touching the perch with his beak, moves his lower mandible very
rapidly, and makes a little sound between a puff and a hiss. When
excited by the presence of visitors he utters very loud, harsh, and
strident calls which would render him intolerable inside a building.
Judging from appearances, the nature of its habitat and the fact that
it is a glorified edition of the Moustache Parrakeet, the Derbyan is
probably an excessively hardy bird which it would be difficult to kill
except by violence. Mine is fed on the Usual seed mixture, together
with monkey nuts and apple, of which latter he is very fond. Like
most Parrakeets he greatly enjoys a rain bath.

THE BREEDING OF THE BIB FINCH AT LIBERTY
Sir, --Last May I obtained two or three pairs of this soberly-coloured
but not unattractive little bird, and after training them to enter an
aviary shelter through a little door a few inches in diameter, gave them
their liberty. They stayed and did well, and after some weeks my aviary
attendant reported that they had bred. On my return home in August,
almost the first small birds I saw in the garden were two young Bib
Finches on the feeding tray, very well grown, and only differing from
their parents in the lack of bib.
I have yet to winter them, but I do not anticipate great difficulty
in this, and it would appear that the Bib Finch can be added to the
list of small, common birds whose presence at controlled liberty can
be made to add beauty and interest to a well-planted garden. In spite
of its diminutive size and quiet coloration the Bib Finch is by no means
inconspicuous at liberty, as it is tame and not at all retiring in its
habits.

LEAD POISONING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989014545454545" page_id="56773397"  page_num="250" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Some time ago I bought lead wire for fastening labels on roses,
and, unthinkingly, used this for fastening drinkers on cages.
I use the cages for isolating birds for a few weeks after receiving them
from dealers.
All went well with ordinary hard bills, but latterly I have taken
up Lovebirds and Parrakeets.
About a month ago I got a pair of Masked Lovebirds from Chapmans,
and put them in one of these cages, and found, on the second morning,
they had eaten the wire through and spilt their water.
I fastened the drinker up again with stronger steel wire, and thought
no more about it. On going to feed them the following day I found the
cock completely paralysed in the legs, and so he still remains after
three weeks, although in other respects quite fit.
The same thing happened to a pair of Budgerigars before I found
out my mistake ; one Budgerigar died after severe contortions.
Perhaps you may think it worth while publishing this as a warning
to fellow aviculturists, who may, like me, find soft wire very easy
to use.
I have a young Black-cheeked Lovebird on its own, hatched
16th June, and should like to know if this is the first breeding success
in Ireland.

Sir, --Just a line to say that I have had a hatch of the Masked
Lovebird (Agapornis per sonata). Doubtless other enthusiasts can
report a success as early, if not earlier. The hen began to sit on 8th July,
and was still on three eggs when I left home on 4th August, on my
return to-day, 17th August, I found two young ones. Incubation must
have lasted at least twenty-five days.
Two other nests, which were started about the same date, appear
to contain addled eggs. These young are covered with the orange-
coloured down characteristic of the Lovebirds. It remains to be seen
how long they remain in the nest, provided all goes well.

COLOUR BREEDING IN BUDGERIGARS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985917375" page_id="56773398"  page_num="251" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The first three lines of your most interesting article in last
mouth's Magazine recall my own experience ; my elder sister had a
pair given to her when I was about 5 years old.
I was 11 years old when I got my first Budgerigars, and that is
more years ago than I care to think about. You refer to percentage
of blue young ; several of us tried this theory many years ago, with
greens and yellows, but the 25 per cent and 50 per cent did not turn
up, and I have tried it with blue and green since, without success.
On the other hand, one member, Mr. Danys Weston, has proved it
to work out with blues and greens. Now he used blues that had been
bred from blues for several generations, whereas I used blues bred
from blue-bred greens.
I like a dark blue (not cobalt) better than a sky blue, and as I do
not show, nor breed for the market, I seldom pair two blues together.
I think this proves that unless the blues are bred from blues and the
green blood bred out, they are not potent enough to prove this theory.
I was the first to introduce a blue-bred strain, and I find that the
better the pedigree of the blue-breds, more blue young are produced ;
in breeding it is not so much the colour of the birds, but pedigree that
counts. I have known young of other colours produced in an aviary
of only blue birds ; these would be the best of blue birds, of course ;
when producing a new colour, you would give consideration to the
colour of breeding stock, as well as pedigree. I think the olive was
produced by selection, so now we really have four shades of colours for
crossing green, yellow, blue, and olive.
It is a long time since I had any Pennants, or saw any young ones,
but as far as I can remember, the nest feather is nearly all olive green,
so generations ago the Pennant must have been an olive-green bird.
Now we have olive Budgerigars and the mauve has a pink shade showing
in the blue, so we are sure to get pink or red Budgerigars in time.
I have already heard of two cases of birds that show a few pink feathers.
John W. Marsden.

Mr. Allen Silver writes :--
" In peaceful Herefordshire, where no sound but the notes of birds
and the rustle of leaves in a hay-scented breeze broke the stillness of
a beautiful afternoon, stands the small church of St. George, situate
in the parish of Brinsop.
" A little before 3 o'clock on the afternoon of 30th July, a bell
could be heard calling to those who were gathering together in memory
of our much esteemed and friendly late member.
" The almost mediaeval atmosphere of this little church with its
sounds of ancient pipe organ and viols was most impressive, and the
Bight Reverend Dr. Trollope, in dedicating a window to the late
Hubert Delaval Astley, alluded in his address to the great interest
that was taken and the love that was shown by him for all things
beautiful.
" One has only to look through a series of volumes of our Magazine
to know how true this was, and to many of us who knew him personally
his memory will be long cherished like the sunshine and breezes of a
beautiful summer afternoon."

Our worthy Editor informs me that there is to be a plate of the
Crowned Wood Partridge (Rollulus roulroul) in the Magazine, and
that as I have been fortunate enough to breed this beautiful species,
it is my duty to record my experiences with it. To those Unacquainted
with the adult birds, the excellent plate accompanying these notes gives
such a life-like representation that further description is Unnecessary.
The Roul-roul is the sole member of its genus which is characterized
by the presence in both sexes of long hair-like bristles springing from
the middle of the forehead. All the Wood Partridges, and there are two
other genera, have the claw of the first toe rudimentary.
The home of the Roul-roul is in " South Tenasserim, Malay
Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, and Borneo " (B.M. Catalogue), and I under-
stand that it is upon the well-wooded hillsides at an elevation of from
3,000 to 4,000 feet, that it is usually to be found in " coveys " of from
six to a dozen.

To the late Sir William Ingram belongs the credit of being the first
to hatch the Roul-roul in captivity, and twenty years ago he was so
far successful in that he reared a chick so hatched to the age of
three weeks in one of his aviaries at Monte Carlo. A drawing of the chick
and an interesting account of the nesting habits of the bird appear in
Avicultural Magazine, New Series, Yol. YI, p. 38.
I purchased my first pair of Roul-roul from Chapman in the late
summer of 1924 . These were shortly afterwards turned out into a
fairly large aviary thickly planted with shrubs and in which there was
a good deal of undercover.
The cock bird never seemed to thrive, and about six weeks after-
wards he was found dead under one of the bushes. The hen, on the other
hand, appeared to improve and later came through a good moult. She
passed the winter in this aviary to which was attached a lofty shelter,
without artificial heat. She frequently roosted in the open, and except
in very severe weather the door of the shelter was never shut, whilst
the large window near the top of the shelter was continuously open
night and day.
I must here interpolate the remark that I do not recommend this
spartan treatment for Roul-rouls, as this last winter during a prolonged
spell of wet I found that the damp earth " balled " on their feet, and
that both parents and chicks seemed happier and naturally more
active when brought to a somewhat drier atmosphere where their feet
soon recovered from the chaps which were starting to form on the under-
side of their toes.
As a mate for the hen I purchased, in December, 1925 , a cock bird
from Mr. Hebb, of Luton. The weather being bad and the time of the
year unfavourable, I kept this bird for some time shut in a roomy cage,
but eleven days after his arrival he had the misfortune to break a leg--
this was on the 29 th of the month. Having set the bone to the best of
my ability, with a bandage soaked in white of egg, I kept him in the dark
until 3 rd January, 1926 , when preferring to risk the weather rather than
he should disturb the setting of his limb, I turned him out in the big
aviary with the hen. I have mentioned these details in order to show
that, whilst these birds probably prefer rather more warmth than an
average English winter brings, they are certainly not delicate.

On 3rd May the aviary attendant's notice was drawn to the cock
bird standing Under a laurel and near him a small mound of sticks
and dried leaves towards the centre of the bush. This mound was shaped
like a tunnel, with a small entrance hole in the front ; upon closer
observation the green body feathers of the hen bird were visible
within. Later in the evening the aperture was completely sealed and the
cock had gone to roost in the laurel above.
Some few days afterwards the hen was seen to be feeding, and a
visit to the mound disclosed the fact that she was therein incubating
three white eggs, almost round, with the shell having almost the same
texture and substance as the egg of the Guinea Fowl. The size of the
egg is given by the late Mr. Astley as diameter 1'25 in., axis 1*55 in.
The hen proved a very close sitter, and this was the only occasion
upon which she was found away from her nest. Every night she was
walled up inside and presumably she did this herself from within, but
it is possible that the cock lent a hand as he was invariably on guard.
Herein my experience differs from that of Sir William Ingram, who
found that his male bird kept " as far as possible from his partner's
abode ".
After three weeks the hen was gently driven from her nest, and the
eggs were found to be unfertile and removed.
About this time I considered it advisable to take off the bandage
which still adhered to the male bird's leg, and on 17th July the hen
Roul-roul was reported missing. After a prolonged search--and I
would here emphasize the marvellous way in which the domed nest
blends with the surrounding foliage--her whereabouts was discovered
on the other side of the aviary, at the foot of an old disused feeding
shelter, and seventeen days later the mother made her appearance with
four tiny chocolate-coloured chicks. One of these was noticed to be
weaker than its fellows, and was found dead later in the day. About
a week after this one of the remaining three chicks disappeared and was
never found, the other two reaching maturity and proving to be one of
each sex.
Sir William Ingram gives the period of incubation as eighteen days,
and with me the hen might have been sitting a day or two before she was
reported absent.

The Breeding of the Crowned Wood Partridge
Apart from the Boul-roul's ordinary food (grain, insectivorous food,
bread, and milk, and cut-up fruit) there was supplied finely chopped
egg and bread crumbs, chopped green food, and mealworms or gentles.
Both the old birds took a hand in feeding the young, but the hen alone
brooded them and this she was never seen to do except under the cover
of the nest.
It might be of interest here to remark that, as far as my knowledge
goes, green as a colour is unknown amongst the gallinaceous birds, save
in the female of this species, and in the males of the Blood Partridges or

Did the hen Boul-roul acquire her comparatively bright plumage
(i.e. for the brooding sex amongst game birds) because she builds a
domed nest for herself or does she build a domed nest because she has
put on somewhat gaudy attire ? Perhaps those interested in " protective
coloration " will give their opinion. Doubtless she is " protectively
coloured " whilst moving about amongst the changing lights in heavy
woodland, but presumably her vivid green tint would be conspicuous
when at rest.
At a fortnight old the chicks were able to fly into the low bushes
and roost with their parents. In their first plumage the young birds
had the body chocolate brown with speckled wings and a small creamy
fawn spot on each tail feather. As the moult took place the sexes
became discernible, and in three months or so they were almost
indistinguishable from the old birds, except in size. The white band
across the top of the head of the adult male bird took some time in
manifesting itself in the chick of the sterner sex.
In the early months of this year, when I brought the family under
cover for the reason stated above, the young male was if anything a
finer bird than his father. Presumably four eggs would be the normal
clutch for these birds.

For the third time in eighteen months a new species of Lovebird
has come to Us, through the enterprise in each case of Mr. Chapman.
This species hails from Tanganyika, and was recently depicted in
colour in the Magazine. But we find on comparison with the living
bird that it is not green on the back of the head as painted, but the
same bright orange colour as on the face and neck. It has a blue rump,
and is the same size as the Nyasa Lovebird, and not so highly coloured,
or in our opinion so attractive. Probably it will breed equally freely,
and in this connexion it may be useful to mention the experiences
of this year.
During the spell of dry, cold winds in April and May all Lovebird
eggs, Nyasa and Black-cheeked, proved Unfertile. They were thought
to need a cool, damp atmosphere more like their rain-soaked native
haunts.
Mr. Denys Weston devised a nest-box with a false bottom, below
which is a drawer packed with sphagnum moss which can be moistened
as necessary.
One of these boxes was given to one pair of Nyasas and an ordinary
Budgerigar box to another pair. Large baths filled with long grass
and groundsel were placed in each aviary and damp moss also thrown
on the floor. The result from both boxes was just the same, each
pair having reared a clutch of five young from as many eggs. The bath
should be big enough to oblige the birds to get into it among the damp
herbage, which is bitten off and taken into the boxes, and doubtless
supplies the necessary moisture. The Black-cheeks reared one young
only out of four eggs, and this one unfortunately died after leaving
the nest.
Lovebirds are rather a problem in the winter : they do not do very
well in cages ; if their aviary is quite cold they need sleeping boxes,
in which case they insist on perpetually breeding, and if a paraffin lamp
is used, as in my case, to exclude frosts and provide a little comfort,
the atmosphere probably becomes too dry.

Last winter, while visiting Mr. Lewis' fine collection, I was interested
to see three specimens of this lovely little bird, Psitteuteles euteles,
recently imported, and practically new to aviculture. Although I had
given up keeping Lorikeets some years before, as Mr. Lewis did not
want them himself, I was tempted to buy them. Unfortunately before
I was able to take charge of them one of the cocks died. The pair
I took home myself, not caring to leave such delicate treasures to the
tender mercies of the railway company. They arrived in good condition
but further ill-luck was in store. I told my aviary attendant to give
them Lorikeets' food. He misunderstood me and gave them Hanging
Parrots' food--mashed banana and sponge cake--which they would
not touch. The result was that next morning I found them in a very
shaky condition and before the proper diet could be obtained the
cock collapsed quickly and died. The hen soon revived on Dr. Allinson's
Food prepared as for infants and sweetened--the only diet on which
I have been able to persuade all Lorikeets to thrive and keep free from
fits. On this, with the addition of a few sweet grapes, she has lived
ever since.
After a considerable period of quarantine in the hospital the Lorikeet
was moved to the warm bird-room and thence, late in May, to a large
outdoor aviary with a heated shelter, of which latter she has made
full Use. When in the cage she was quite tame and almost inclined to
be friendly, but after a summer in the aviary she has become very
wild. In her movements and behaviour she resembles the Trichoglossine
Lorikeets, as also in her sharp cries, though being no larger than a
Tui these naturally have little power. Her general plumage is bright
glossy green, somewhat paler on the breast. On each cheek there is a
curious patch of yellow feathers interspersed with blackish ones in a
manner to give the former a streaky appearance. In the centre of the
upper part of the rump is a small patch of brilliant, deep blue. The
pointed tail feathers are first green, then red, and at the tip yellow.
The beak is red and the feet and legs, unlike those of any other living

This article might also be entitled "Per ardua ad astra", for although
I have had my Sula Island hen nearly nine years and she has laid once
and sometimes twice most seasons and sat diligently, she has been a
very difficult bird to mate with success. Her first partner was a
Red Shining Parrakeet, but her eggs with him were never fertile,
perhaps because he was twice her size which is considerably less than
that of a Common King. When the Red Shining died I attempted to pair
her to an Alexandra Parrakeet, but he never took to her and she was
afraid of him, which was odd, as she was by far the more powerful
bird of the two. I next tried her with Australian Kings, but she bullied
the life out of them although she was nearly a third smaller than they.
I believe they took her for a cock by reason of her plumage, and the
insult to her sex was more than she could endure ! Parrakeets are
apt to be strangely stupid in such matters and by no means so Unerringly
guided by instinct as one would expect. Adult Cock Barrabands will
display to cocks in first plumage with the greatest energy and are
obviously quite deluded into the belief that they are hens.
Finally, noticing that the Sula Island seemed attracted by the cock
Crimson-wings I had at liberty, I decided to offer her a Crimson-wing
as a mate. She obviously admired the fine male I introduced into her
aviary, although she was a little afraid of him, and had he possessed
the disposition of a gentleman all might have gone well from the
beginning. Unfortunately, however, a Crimson-wing has no manners
at all and considers it a necessary preliminary to married life to impress
his hen with his fine, masculine qualities by pursuing her with curses

up and down the aviary, biting her whenever he is able to catch her.
A female Crimson-wing understands this method of courtship and
apparently quite enjoys it, but hens of other species do not. When
the cock flies at them with his beak open, calling them unmentionable
names, and endeavours to pull a mouthful of feathers out of their backs,
they conclude that he dislikes them, and the more persistently he
declares his passion with strange oaths, the more hurriedly they flee
before him. This happened in the case of the Sula Island. When
the breeding season arrived her companion, I am sure, really quite
liked her. He got very thrilled over her visits to the nest-box and even
displayed to her at times, but he could not bring himself to forego
the formality of the preliminary thrashing, even when she was most
anxious to be on intimate terms with him, and she on her part could
not screw up her courage to the point of allowing him to bite her.
So the end of it was that the eggs were unfertile.
During the winter, however, the Sula Island made herself master
of her turbulent partner, and I had great hopes that the change in their
relationship might spell better fortune during the following spring.
Once, indeed, it seemed as though an accident would restore the former
position : in moving her we allowed a hen Crimson-wing to escape
and she flew to the aviary occupied by the cock Crimson-wing and
the Sula Island King. The cock was thrown into transports of excite-
ment at the unexpected appearance of a lady of his own race, and at
once fell upon the Sula Island and quickly put her to flight. We
captured the disturbing visitor as quickly as possible, and when her
presence no longer excited him to deeds of valour I was relieved to find
that the cock Crimson-wing once more accepted the domination of the
King, to which he had become accustomed. However, no better
fortune was in store, for the Sula Island King's eggs were again
clear. Worse still, as soon as she started to sit the Crimson-wing made
himself master and when the eggs were removed began to harry the
hen so unceasingly that in disgust I separated them and allowed him
to set up house with the female of his own kind already alluded to ;
this he did without a moment's hesitation or regret for his late com-
panion. So relieved, indeed, was he to be rid of the Sula Island that
he scarcely addressed a single cuss-word to his new bride and for the

first few weeks showed her more affection than I have ever seen in a
Crimson-wing before or since ; I fear I must, however, add that he-
has proved unable to keep it up indefinitely, although he is still with her
and is rearing a family at the moment. About a fortnight after the
Crimson-wing had been removed, the now solitary Sula Island laid two-
more eggs, one of which, to our intense astonishment, proved fertile-
and hatched ! The triumph was, however, short lived, as the chick
died when only a few days old, owing, as I now know, to the unsuitable-
nature of the nest, an artificial box in the aviary shelter being, in thi&amp;
place, a perfect death-trap for any young King or Crimson-wing.
In spite of the belated and unexpected measure of success attained
with the cock Crimson-wing, I felt it Useless, now that he had settled
down with a mate of his own species, to try further experiments with
him and the King. I therefore obtained a new Crimson-wing, choosing
a two-year-old bird not quite in full colour, in order that the Sula
Island might be able to discipline him and teach him manners before
age had developed the hooligan disposition of his race and sex. All
went well during the autumn and winter, the Sula Island keeping the
Crimson-wing well in his place. Early in March they became friendly
and paired and although she had no nest the King insisted on laying
two eggs on the sand on a zinc tray in the shelter immediately under the
feeding dish. This was not at all what I wanted as I planned to give
her a natural tree trunk in the flight as soon as the weather became mild.
My aviary attendant put the eggs on a concave wooden nest bottom
and the Sula Island proceeded to incubate them with great steadiness,
only flying off for a few moments when the little door above her head
was opened to replenish the food dish. I was, however, far from
satisfied about the probable fate of the chick which might hatch from
the one fertile egg. Young Aprosmictus Parrakeets develop cramp
and rickets on an artificial wooden floor as surely as Ducklings, so
I decided to try the Sula Island's patience by yet another interference
with her domestic arrangements. With great skill and by dint of
Herculean labours, the gardener and two assistants cut a gigantic
turf about 4 ft. square and 18 in. thick. I turned the Sula Island gently
off her eggs and shut her out of the shelter. Then we removed the
wooden block, established the turf, bottom upwards, in its place, and

Marquess of Tavistock --
put the eggs in a hollow on the top. As soon as I pulled up the slide
the hen, who had been quietly eating monkey nuts most of the time
we had been banging about in her home, went back to her eggs and new
nest, I was going to say " like a lamb ", but as lambs are not noted
for steadiness during incubation, " like a broody Dorking hen " might
be a better simile. That is the best of Parrakeets : they will stand
any reasonable and often quite a lot of most unreasonable interference
with their nests without deserting. They are wise birds, and, with
rare exceptions, devoted parents, very different from those addle-pated
Finches and Softbills that desert, at the most trivial disturbance, even
their helpless young. Unfortunately all our trouble was once more in
vain. The Sula Island sat over her full time, but the chick was dead
in the shell. I forgot to mention that soon after she had begun sitting
the Crimson-wing developed bad manners, made himself master and
bullied her so incessantly whenever she came off to feed that I removed
him to another aviary. With the failure of the first batch of eggs
there was nothing for it but to return him in the hope that solitude
had improved his temper. If anything, however, it had made him
worse : directly he got over the fright of his transfer he was after the
Sula Island for all he was worth, driving her up and down the aviary
with open beak and torrents of his choicest Billingsgate ; I could have
wrung his neck ! In desperation I resolved to apply to him the final
discipline reserved for hopelessly savage cocks. I told the aviary
attendant to catch him and cut his wing, not enough to stop him from
flying altogether, but sufficiently to restrict his capers pretty severely.
He was exceedingly annoyed at the indignity to which he had been
subjected, and for some days sulked inside the aviary shelter, swearing
at the Sula Island when she approached him. However, it turned out
eventually that the punishment had done him a world of good. In a
few weeks' time he was quite a reformed character and on excellent
terms with his companion whom I had provided with a piece of a
natural tree trunk for her next attempt. It was not an ideal nest,
having no bottom and being little more than 2 ft. 6 in. high, but it was
the best I could get hold of. I placed it in a sheltered corner of the
aviary flight and put plenty of mould and decayed wood in the interior.
The Sula Island laid three eggs which hatched a few days before I left

home in May. Shortly before I lost a brood of young Crimson-wings
in a very similar but rather more draughty log and my hopes of the
hybrid nest were at a very low ebb and were not raised by what little
I could see of the young ones when I got the chance of a peep with the
aid of an electric torch. Young Parrakeets when in good health usually
sit very upright and very close together with their funny little " arms "
round each others' necks and their heads wobbling over each others'
shoulders. But as far as I could see only one young hybrid was moving,
and that feebly, and the biggest lay very still and appeared to be dead.
I went away with a heavy heart, daily expecting to hear that X, the
evil spirit who appears to take a special delight in frustrating the hopes
of aviculturalists, had done in one or all of my greatest treasures of the
season--the hybrids, a Lutino Ringneck and a nest of Malabars.
X made no mistake with the Lutino and duly destroyed the lovely
golden bird I had toiled for twelve years to produce, a few days after
it left the nest, but for some reason the bad news of the hybrids never
came. The result was that when I got back in August I found sitting
on the perches three as sturdy and handsome young birds as one could
wish to see. They are not Unlike rather slender young Common Kings,
but all their colours are much more brilliant ; indeed, I have never
seen any Parrakeets in first plumage with such rich tints, and if they
live to be three years old they should be gorgeous birds, indeed. Their
heads, necks, wings, mantles, and breasts are green, the tint on the
breast being slightly paler. The upper part of the rump is brilliant blue
and the belly is very rich, dark crimson, streaks of the same colours
running upwards towards the breast and mingling with the green
subcaudal feathers. The cock has a few red feathers on the crown.
The tail feathers are green above and black below with pinkish-yellow
tips. The beaks of the young birds are of a pinkish colour, becoming
yellower towards the tip of both mandibles. Eyes large and very
dark. The Sula Island, encouraged by her success, went to nest a
third time and now (September 13th) has another young one about
half grown. The newly-hatched young were covered with long white
down.
It seems a great pity that the wonderful Aprosmictine Parrakeets,
the sexes of which are coloured alike, should remain practically unknown

THE BREEDING OF THE LEPURANA

By H. L. Sich
Of the very few of the twenty-odd species of Turnix which I have
been able to pick up nearly all have been hens.
As far as observation has gone they all appear to have similar
habits, which have been described before. I have never had more
than three eggs in a clutch and sometimes only two, with paired birds
as well as odd hens, although I have heard of four chicks having been
hatched and reared. It is impossible to say how many clutches are laid
by one hen in a season in nature. My two species, both paired, this
year have laid one five clutches, the other four, and the latter is booming
again now.
Lepurana is, according to Ogilvie-Grant, a sub-species of sylvatica y
differing only in being smaller, and having a more southern range in
Africa. But his description of the latter does not quite describe the
pattern of my lepurana .
I can see no difference in the two sexes except size, and that the
breast of the hen is a little brighter yellow. The Upper parts are
mottled and streaked with two shades of brown. The throat, breast, and
Under parts are yellowish buff, a streak down the middle of the head ;
the sides of the neck and sides of the breast are very nearly white in
ground colour but each feather has a black centre, giving a scaly
appearance. The bill, which is rather long, is lead coloured, the toes,
and tarsus yellowish white. The black of the eye is surrounded by
pale yellow, which gives the birds a very scared look.
Having got two tanJci hens last year and failing to find a cock any-
where I offered another bird in exchange for a Turnix which I saw in
the Small Bird-house at the Zoological Gardens, and thought that I

had been told that it was a cock. My offer was kindly accepted. Not
long after the bird was in my aviary it started booming, then I knew
it was a hen. Only then did I inquire its name and found it was
lepurana. I could see from the first that it was too different from my
hen to be a cock tanki , but it was better than nothing.
In the autumn some more lepurana were advertised. The first lot
which I bought were all dead in two days. I was just in time to save
one cock of the second lot. A hen Chinese Painted Quail had taken a
dislike to them, being, I suppose, too much like herself in colour,
and hunted them round the shelter in which all the birds were shut
up in for the winter.
Having caught up the remaining cock and the old hen for safety
*--she had not been attacked, being there before the Quail had arrived--
I put them in a small run 7 by 4 feet in the shelter of the other
division. By 11th April she had laid three eggs behind a board. These
I removed besides three more laid by 23rd April as there was no live
food for the chicks, even if the cock had hatched them, and there was
nowhere to put the hen if I had removed her. On 30th April they were
let out into the flight. On 4th June I discovered that what appeared
to be a handful of hay tumbled out of a privet bush was the dome of
a nest: being placed in short grass it was more elaborate than usual,
and looked much like a large nest of the Quail Finch. It contained
two eggs, a third being laid about midday and the cock began to
incubate soon after. The eggs are about 11 lines by 9 lines of a white
ground heavily mottled with dark olive brown and much smaller
blotches of pale brown and lavender grey.
By 7.30 a.m., 18th June, all three eggs were hatched. Going in
to feed some Quail chicks, the cock ran off the nest and the chicks tried
to follow. I collected them and put them back. When I went again
at 9.30 the nest was empty and the egg-shells which were there before
had gone ; the nest was never Used again. Did the cock eat them to
cover up all traces ? I never expected these eggs to hatch. The cock
was always off the nest when I came in the morning, and came off
regularly at about 6 p.m. for what seemed in my anxiety to be about
half an hour. Besides that about every quarter of an hour all day long
he would leave the eggs for five or ten minutes to feed or have a dust

bath. I could see the nest a good way off from the outside of the aviary,
so his coming off was not due to fear of me. He sat more closely the
last few days, which raised my hopes. What summer weather we have
had this year was over by the middle of June. The three chicks were
still alive on the 19th, after a soaking wet and stormy night, but on
the 22nd after a similar night there were only two left. I caught up
the cock and these two and placed them in a small run in the passage
about 6 by 3 feet and had no more trouble, feeding them on live
ants' eggs and gentles. I had to cover half the run over with roofing
felt to keep them moderately dry ; that and the drenching weather
made observation rather difficult. I noticed that even when quite
young when the sun shone the chicks would sit together apart from
the cock. At first they were dusky white with two darker stripes down
the back and the whole of the eye appeared black. At six days old
the wing quills were visible. At about ten days old they began to
pick up food off the ground. By 3rd July at fifteen days old the body
was covered with feathers and a little tail was showing ; the head was
still covered with down. On the 5th I first noticed that the irishadbecome
pale. On the 17th they were about two-thirds the size of the cock
and coloured much the same but very much whiter looking and without
any yellow on the under parts. I put them in a run by themselves,
inside, where they have been ever since. They are now, 1st September,
the size of the cock and coloured like him except the breast which
only shows a tinge of yellow. As they are both the same size they
are probably both the same sex and I expect cocks. The hen has laid
twice since, once in a small run where the cock refused to sit, and in
the aviary where he hatched out on 16th August, but I could not find
even the cock bird and in a week he appeared alone, so the wet and
scarcity of food, which I could only scatter broadcast, which the other
birds ate, killed them. My other species, nigricollis, hatched out two
from two eggs early in May, but on an isolated wet day and only lived
a few hours. They have nested since but the eggs did not hatch. The
young chicks were a few shades darker than lepurana but just the
same pattern and size.

By G. H. Gurney, F.Z.S.
To the Naturalist, whether he be ornithologist, botanist, or entomo-
logist, no group of islands present a more fascinating and interesting
field for his particular hobby than the Canary Island Archipelago.
The various species peculiar to the islands, or in several cases to one
particular island, offer problems of surpassing interest, and added to
the magnificent climate which one nearly always enjoys there renders
a stay on any one of the islands one of peculiar enjoyment. I spent
the greater part of February and March this year at Puerto Orotava
on the coast of Tenerife, and no better centre could be found from which
to work the birds which are found on that island. Puerto Orotava is
situated on the west coast of Tenerife, the largest island of the group,
and is reached by a drive through splendid scenery of 30 miles from
Santa Cruz, the principal town and port of the island. The island of
Tenerife roughly covers an area of over 900 square miles, and is 50 miles
long by 32 miles broad. A long Unbroken range of mountains running
roughly from Esperanza to Guia, forms, as it were, the backbone of
the island, and culminates in the well-known peak, the Pico de Teide,
which reaches a height of 12,180 feet. The sides of this long ridge of
mountains are deeply cut by barrancos (ravines) which run down on
either side, some of them of very large size. The entire surface of the
island is composed of basaltic rocks, lava, cinders, and scorrise, though
on the fertile LagUna plateau there is a fine rich mould. Owing to the
mountains there is a considerable amount of moisture which renders
the island far less arid than some others of the group ; indeed, many of
the barrancos are most luxuriant with brilliant almost tropical vegeta-
tion, and it is only in the extreme south of the island where typical
African desert conditions exist that sandy, stony tracts of desert
country are to be found, and it is on these desert-like plains that some
of the most interesting insular birds are to be found.
The extremely picturesque town of Orotava is situated 1,500 feet
above the sea, overshadowed by the snow-capped Peak of Tenerife ;
El Puerto, where I stayed, is 3 miles lower down, at sea-level. The
country all round is now largely devoted to the cultivation of the
banana, and a great deal of what was formerly good country for birds.

lias gone for ever. The banana plantations extend for miles all round
Orotava, and stretch up to some 2,000 feet, where one gets into the
region of the chestnut and laurel forests.
There has been in the past considerable differences of opinion amongst
scientists as to the origin of the Canarian Archipelago, and various
theories have been put forward : (1) that they are merely of volcanic
origin ; (2) that they were originally joined to the mainland of Africa ;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8760762" page_id="56773425"  page_num="268" year="" vol="">
(3) that they are the remaining peaks of the submerged fabled continent
of Atlantis ; but it is now, I think, generally agreed that they were
formed by volcanic action in the late Tertiary period. The Archipelago
is made up of some twelve islands, forming an eastern group and a
western group. The eastern islands are mainly composed of arid
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.92291364" page_id="56773425"  page_num="268" year="" vol="">
stony deserts and extinct volcanoes, with a very scanty vegetation ;
the two large islands of the western group, viz., Gran Canaria and
Tenerife, are also purely of volcanic origin, but on them water is fairly
abundant, and consequently vegetation is much more luxurious.
The whole of the island of Tenerife can be divided up into very distinct
zones of vegetation, which bear a marked influence on the distribution
of the birds. These zones may be differentiated as follows :--
(1) The Maritime Zone , which extends from sea-level to 1,000 feet,
and includes the desert-like plains. This zone is characterized by a
semi-desert flora, where such arid-loving species as O&amp;apos;puntia and the
wonderful Tree Euphorbias flourish, and is the habitat of suchinteresting
birds as the Courser and the Trumpeter Bullfinch.
(2) The Monte Verde or Zone of Cultivation, including the remains
of the chestnut and laurel forests, between 1,000 and 3,000 feet. There
the vegetation, whether indigenous or introduced, is of the utmost
luxuriance : vines, oranges, loqUats, and bananas all thrive, and wild
flowers of every description clothe the sides of the barrancos, while the
gardens of the villas and houses are more like outdoor conservatories
than anything else, with an extreme wealth of magnificent plants and
shrubs ; the brilliant yellow and scarlet Bignonia venusta, red and
purple Bougainvilleas climb in profusion over roofs and balconies,
flaunting crimson Hibiscus grow side by side with Daturas with their
enormous white trumpet-like flowers, while the beautiful blue Thun-
bergia grandiflora climbs over the dracaenas and palms, all making Up
a picture of surpassing loveliness. Special birds peculiar to this zone

plant Escobon (Cytisus prolifer) grows freely. Large tracts of the more
rocky parts of the island (Zone 1) are given over to the Prickly Pear of
two species, viz. Optuntia coccinellifera and O. dillenii, the former,
which in the past was largely cultivated, is the food-plant of the
cochineal bug, which previously was bred by the inhabitants for the
sake of the well-known dye ; this industry was killed, however, in
the Canary Islands by the discovery of aniline dyes in 1878. However,
I was told that recently an effort has been made to restart the cochineal
industry in Gran Canaria, principally because it is an industry which
requires very little heavy labour, and in consequence suits the tempera-
ment of the indolent Canarian peasants.
The larger Birds of Prey are very common in Tenerife : Buzzards and
Red Kites may be seen at any time, and are remarkably tame, though
they do not haunt the vicinity of the towns in the way they did twenty
years ago. The Egyptian Vulture is also an abundant species, but keeps
to the more mountainous parts of the island. It is a fine sight to see
three or four of these large Vultures wheeling over one's head, the black
and white plumage of the adults standing out finely against the brilliant
blue sky. Occasionally I saw them being mobbed by Buzzards, which
in their turn were mobbed by Ravens. The little Canarian Kestrel
(Tinnunculus tinnunculus canariensis ), which is a resident sub-species,
was extraordinarily abundant and breeding in the barrancos ; they
were absurdly tame, and would sit oji a small tree, or on the top of a
wall by the roadside, and hardly bother to fly away as one passed.
I think they feed almost entirely on the Lizards which swarm every-
where. A few years ago the Osprey was a comparatively common bird,
and lived in the cliffs quite close to Orotava ; I was disappointed not
to see it at all.

By Capt. H. S. Stokes
Two years ago I related in these pages how a single Senegal Touracou
had surprised us by laying a clutch of eggs.
There followed the difficult search for a cock, rather like looking
for a needle in a haystack, for Senegal Touracous are very few and far
between. However, through the kindness of friends we succeeded
in getting a beauty, and the two birds were duly put together. The
hen went for him like a tigress, and they had to be separated. They
were kept in separate aviaries, but within sight of each other through
the winter, and on Whit-Mondav, 1926, were put together, both in a
fresh aviary. They at once began to feed and kiss and make charming
crooning noises, and soon started a nest in some ivy outdoors, about
5 ft. from the ground. A clutch of two eggs was laid and the birds
sat steadily in June but the eggs proved to be clear.
We had been warned by the previous experience of Mr. Delacour
of the exuberance of the cock, who would certainly kill the first brood
of young, but we did not remove him as he regularly took his turn on
the eggs by day, after the manner of pigeons, and being also rather
lame with rheumatism was not addicted to wife-beating. A second
clutch of eggs was laid on the same nest in August, 1926, and one egg
hatched about 9th September.
On this date I went abroad, as I have learnt to do when any specially
precious birds are breeding. Letters from my aviary girl reported
the good progress of the baby, Upon whom she lavished endless care
and thought and trouble, and on my return on 10th October I was
shown the young with great and justifiable pride. It was not yet out
of the nest, about half grown, and about the size of a pigeon, and
covered with black down. It was about six o'clock in the evening
and just getting dark, when pleased to be home and elated at the birth
into the world of another Senegal Touracou, I stood outside the aviary
and talked to the mother, who is attached to me and will feed from
my hand. She came to the wires for a grape, and the cock joined her,
and both became very excited and began to crow. Alas, it was the death

knell of the poor little one : in their excitement they left it that night
to its fate, and in the morning it was dead. I learnt my lesson, and
vowed never more to pet them.
This spring about April the hen showed signs of wishing to lay,
so we made every effort to induce her to do so indoors. Boxes and
baskets were put up, and heather and dead damson branches strewn
about, but she would have none of them. Back she went to the old
spot, and though the nest of last year had been demolished and we
had put fresh heather up for her, it was all pulled out and the nest
rebuilt entirely of branches broken off a small tree in the aviary by
both birds.
One egg only was laid, and after two days it disappeared. One more
was then laid after a fortnight, and I caught the cock red-handed
eating it. Another egg was laid in July--observe that the clutch was
invariably only of one egg this year as against the normal two in 1926--
and this time both birds sat splendidly. The hen would come off
every morning about nine for breakfast and a bath, the cock taking
her place till six in the evening. We were very careful to keep them
quiet and to make no fuss of them. Indeed, I again removed myself
from the temptation of meddling by going to London.
About the twenty-first day of incubation--I think the full period
is twenty-four days--we began an extra feed of banana and bread
and milk. On my return home I was horrified to find both birds flying
about and my bird girl almost in tears. Fragments of egg, evidently a
clear one, had been found beneath the nest on the very day they
should have hatched.
For the second year, therefore, we are cheated of success and robbed
of the great joy of rearing so beautiful and delightful a bird, so rare too
in English aviaries.
No praise is too high for the Senegal Touracou. It is steady and
sensible and most beautiful in its dress of green and purple, with carmine
red in the wing. The sexes are by no means easy to distinguish apart,
but the cock is slimmer and longer than the hen, his green crest tipped
with purple, and a broader streak of white below the eye than she
possesses.
These birds lay very large and almost round eggs, and on more than

Aviculturcil Notes
one occasion the hen was so ill with the effort that she could scarcely
reach the nest to lay. However, she allowed herself to be placed on it,
and would feed from the hand on banana rolled in olive oil. She would
also let my bird girl take the egg from beneath her to examine it. We
have now stopped breeding operations for this year as the nights are
getting cold. Next year if both birds are still with us we shall consider
removing the cock directly the eggs are laid, but I am by no means
certain how this will answer in the case of birds of which both sexes
share the task of incubation.
Mr. Delacour was successful in breeding the species in France
before his aviaries were destroyed in the war, but it has not been bred
in England, no doubt owing to the great difficulty of obtaining pairs.

Mr. Webb returned home from Costa Rica on 21st August, with a
number of Humming Birds, which he had collected for Mr. Spedan
Lewis. Mr. Lewis most generously presented seventeen of these to the
Zoological Society, and as they required special lighting and heating
arrangements, special cages were arranged for them in the Insect House.
There are at least five different species, namely Pha&amp;apos;ethornis longirostris ,
Campylopterus hemileucurus, Thalurania colombica, Amazilia dubusi, and
Elvira chionura.
Humming Birds will live for a time upon syrup only, but a certain
quantity of insect food would seem to be necessary for most species
at any rate. There is a very small white fly which is extremely numerous
on the underside of the leaves of some marrow plants in my garden.
It is a regular blight, and appears to be responsible for a very poor
crop of vegetable marrows. But the Humming Birds love these tiny
insects which they capture on the wing in a very dexterous manner.
A pair of very beautiful Conures arrived in a recent collection made
by Mr. Chapman's representative in Central Brazil, and were purchased
by the Zoological Society. They belong to the species known as
Pyrrhura rhodogaster of Sclater--the Crimson-breasted Conure, which

is represented in the Natural History Museum by Mr. Sclater's type-
specimen only. It is slightly larger than the White-eared Conure, and
in many respects resembles that species, but its chief distinguishing
feature is its bright crimson lower breast and abdomen.
Mr. Frost has returned to England after an absence of three years,
and has brought with him a very fine collection, including several birds
new to aviculture. The Raja Lory (Chalcopsittacus insignis) somewhat
resembles the Black Lory, but is clothed in delicate shades of purple,
bronze, and red. Rosenberg's Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus rosenbergi) is
one of the most beautiful of its genus. The Javan Kingfisher ( Halcyon
cyaniventris), the New Guinea Kingfisher ( Sauromarptis gaudichaudi ),
and the very interesting Malayan Falconet (Microhierax fringillarius)
all appear to be the first of their kinds to be imported.
The collection includes thirty-three Birds of Paradise, belonging
to six species, no less than nine Great Black Cockatoos (Microglossus),
seventy Lories of various species, twenty-four Fairy Blue Birds, seven
Blue-tailed Pittas, forty Crowned Pigeons of three species, two Casso-
waries, twelve Egrets, and so on; a really remarkable collection.
These are temporarily housed at the Zoological Gardens, and those
who wish for rarities should communicate with Mr. Frost, c/o the

The question is often asked as to what is the best method of catching
birds from an aviary. For my own part I dislike nets in any shape or
form, though they are necessary in certain cases. A catching cage of
some form is much to be preferred. The birds are fed into this, and a
door is operated with a string. A combined feeding tray and cage can
be devised so that it is always available for catching any bird when it
visits the food-tray. This would be a rather large cage with a large
door at either end, which would be left open normally, but when a bird
was wanted, one door would be shut and the other worked with a string.
Nets must be used for some kinds of large birds, and these should be of
large size, the shape of a butterfly net with a strong cane or wooden
hoop and a light deep string net of half inch or one inch mesh netting.

Those who are interested in the breeding of Canary mules and
hybrids between the various species of British Finches, will be glad to
possess the new edition of Mr. Houlton's book edited by Mr. C. A. House,
both author and editor being experts in hybrid breeding.
While the breeding of Canary mules does not quite come within the
scope of our journal, we may well consider the production of hybrids
between two British species, such as the author deals with. Some of
these are extremely beautiful, as well as interesting, and the list of
those that have been produced is quite a formidable one, the most
remarkable being perhaps that between the Chaffinch and Bramble-
finch. Many have claimed to have crossed the Canary with the Chaffinch
or with the Yellow-hammer, but no bona fide specimen of either of
these has been produced.

<bodyText confidence="0.9992315625" page_id="56773431"  page_num="274" year="" vol="">
Sir, --About the middle of July my Orange Weaver had completed
a nest suspended to the outside twigs of a holly bush. I thought it
worth photographing. As the entrance faced the interior I was going
to remove a bundle of hay, of which the nest was entirely made, from
the middle of the bush, when the hen flew out. On 18th August I saw
the hen hunting round for insects, so I wrote for some mealworms.
In the meantime I beat the garden bushes for insects which were very
few and mostly plant bugs. One young bird left the nest on 23rd August.
It was well feathered, but had no tail, and seemed quite bare under the
throat, otherwise it was a paler edition of the hen and showed a slight
yellowish streak above the eye.
Now, 1st September, it is darker than it was and has a tail; it is
still being fed by the hen. What the hen found to feed the nestling
on in the earlier stages among a host of other birds puzzles me. Now
the cock has entirely picked the nest to pieces, which felt quite clean
inside when the bird had flown. H. L. Sich.

YELLOW-RUMPED PARRAKEET NESTING TWICE DURING

Sir, --It may be worth recording that my breeding pair of Platycercus
flaveolus , after rearing a fine brood of five young birds, laid again and
hatched two more, which unfortunately died when a few days old
owing probably to the unsuitability of the nest.
I have always found the Yellow-rump's very near relative, the
Adelaide Parrakeet, to be single-brooded, even at liberty, whereas
the Pennant, like most of the other Platycercus (including apparently
the Yellow-rump) is normally double-brooded under favourable
conditions.

FOOD OF CROSSBILLS

<bodyText confidence="0.999327272727273" page_id="56773432"  page_num="275" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Observations on the food of a species when wild are sometimes
of value to aviculturists because, as remarked by E. G. B. Meade-
Waldo, F.Z.S., of Kent, " The sciences of ornithology and aviculture
are intimately connected. Each has much to learn from the other "
(Avic. Mag. Yol. 1921, p. 34, beginning of article). Therefore
it may be of use to some member to state that on 5th August a bird was
brought to me (which had been accidentally shot in mistake for a common
species) and which I recognized as a Crossbill, evidently a this year's
bird, breast with dark streaks ; and on going round to the land where
the bird was seen I found four Crossbills feeding on the leading-shoots
of fruit-trees, plum and apple (while the peculiar voices of two others,
presumably parents, were heard quite close).
Up to that morning I thought the food of Crossbills consisted only
of vegetarian matter such as seeds of various fir-trees, mountain ash,
alder, hawthorn, etc., but these four birds were obviously clearing off
and eating greenfly from the leaves of the fruit-trees, and during the
time the owner of the land, Mr. Percy Dennis, and myself watched them,
for about half an hour they systematically " worked over " the top
shoots of young trees, holding the head sideways, almost flat, against
the leaf in doing so, and using beaks to pull themselves up the boughs.
With mandibles not meeting at the tips I should have thought that
eating aphides would have been very difficult for Crossbills, but these

four evidently accomplished the feat quite easily judging from the way
they climbed Parrot-like all up one twig after another ! There was
no sign of them interfering with the fruit, plums or apples. All were
very tame, one reddish on breast apparently a young male, and
presumably hatched in North Kent ; and Mr. Dennis informed me
on 15th August that the birds were still feeding chiefly along the
tops of trees as stated above.
Aviculturalists may find such food Useful for any young birds
hatched out in future years.

[There has been a large immigration of Crossbills to these islands
during the past summer, and they have been recorded from many
parts. We noted a number feeding upon thistle seed in South Devon-
shire, but their usual food is the seeds of various firs.-- Ed.]

BREEDING ROSY-FACED LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999708736842105" page_id="56773433"  page_num="276" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I note with interest in the August number of our Magazine
the article on the Rosy-faced or Peach-faced Lovebird, and as my
experience at present with this species is almost wholly at variance
with what is there recorded, I appear to be in possession of an
exceptional pair. They are housed in a cage of which the inside
measurements are 22 in. high, 18 in. wide, and 10 in. deep. I had no
idea of them going to nest in a space so limited. They were provided
with a husk in which to sleep, and after a time I noticed the hen got a
little rough in plumage. I blamed the husk and had it removed.
One morning, on attending to their wants, I noticed the cock would
not move from the bottom of the cage. His gaze was transfixed on
something in which he appeared to take great interest. On closer
examination I discovered that the object of his infatuation was an egg.
I took the hint, returned the husk, and with the aid of a teaspoon
deposited the egg therein. Along with that egg disappeared the cock
bird. For weeks he was rarely seen. I got anxious as to whether he
was being fed, and thought also that perhaps he was wasting time
and strength on one egg. Suspense prompted action. After some
difficulty he was induced to leave the husk, which was found to contain

seven eggs and a chick which appeared to be newly hatched crawling
over them. Of this clutch six hatched ; one did not, and the other
egg disappeared. Of the six that hatched three appeared not to have
been fed at all ; the other three are now in perfect health and plumage,
larger than their parents, and fortunately able to do for themselves.
The parents have again gone to nest, and would not tolerate the presence
of their offsprings. First the cock showed his resentment, and a few
days later the hen stopped feeding them and also became aggressive,
so they were separated.
The colour of the foreheads of the young reminds one of the head
of a hen Blossom-head, or a sort of dove grey : the throat and breast
are paler shades of those of the adult, but the beautiful blue of the
rump is quite as deep, and the tail when spread shows all the beautiful
markings of the mature specimen. The striking difference is the
colour of the Upper mandible : the upper two-thirds appearing to the
eye to be black, but closely examined would, I think, be found to be
a very dark brown. This is gradually disappearing from the point
towards the cere.
The eggs are white, large for the size of the bird, and round rather
than pointed.
One of the drawbacks mentioned in the article to A. roseicollis
does not apply to my parent birds. They never screech, or give vent
to ear-piercing sounds, but their progeny take turns at drowning each
other down. I thought this contrast to their parents would prove a
passing phase, and due to the exuberance of youth.
As they have not with me had an opportunity of displaying temper
towards their own or other species, I cannot express an opinion as to
their disposition in this respect. But to each other as a pair they are
Lovebirds indeed.
The necessity of removing the young at the succeeding periods of
nidification of parent birds apply to so many different species as to
exonerate A. roseicollis from being on that account considered spiteful.
The hay or rye grass supplied as part of their dietary was conveyed
by the cock, after being securely fixed in the lower back feathers, to the
husk and used as a lining. It was interesting and amusing to watch
this performance. He would fix about a dozen grasses, and then pass

in through the narrow aperture without shedding one. This appeared to
me as no mean feat.
Incubation, unfortunately, commences when the first egg is
deposited, consequently " hatching out " may extend over a week
and prove calamitous to the younger members of the brood.
The cock, and the cock bird alone , incubates, and will not allow
the hen to enter the nest when he comes off to drink. Time and
again, under this circumstance, I have seen the hen move up towards
the nest. He would emit a short, sharp command, which judging from
her action in response clearly meant " stop " and stop she always did.
During incubation the hen carries the food to her mate in the nest.
After the young are hatched she feeds him on the perch, and when the
young leave the nest both parents feed the young.
Their food consisted of canary, white and Indian millet, and a little
sunflower. Nuts and all fruits they ignore. Hay tops I have already
mentioned.
When the weather is propitious their cage is taken into the garden.
This procedure appears not to disturb in the least the serenity of the
cock bird, who sits tight through it all, while the hen is making the
most of the fresh air.
Beyond the size of the cage, I presume there is nothing remarkable
in this case, but it proves that however limited the accommodation
offered, A. roseicollis will increase and multiply.
The cock is now, 29th August, sitting on four eggs.
Alf. S. Nicholson.
[We should be glad of the opinion of others who have bred Agajpornis
roseicollis as to the alleged incubation by the cock bird, and would
suggest to Mr. Nicholson that he may possibly be mistaken in supposing
the sitting bird to be the cock. If he is correct then he has made a
very interesting discovery. --Ed.]

HYBRID BLACK-HEADED (BRAZILIAN) SISKIN &amp; AND
CANARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998245785714286" page_id="56773436"  page_num="279" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In the autumn of 1925 I obtained from a local dealer, who
was unaware of their identity, two cock Black-headed Siskins
(Chrysomitris icterica).
They were not in the best of condition, but soon improved in health
and appearance after being turned into a large flight cage and given
only plain canary and teasel seed, which latter had been previously
soaked for ten minutes in boiling water. This was given to the birds
in a damp state, not hot of course. It was amazing to note the improve-
ment it effected, and they soon began to sing. As a matter of fact,
this species is quite a fine songster, and in my opinion is superior
either to the Goldfinch or Brown Linnet, or as far as I know any other
small Finch. In the following spring they became more vocal and used
to sing incessantly, one against the other, with lowered wings, showing
off the beautiful golden yellow of the wing feathers.
I tried in vain to secure hens of their own race for that season (1926),
and both ultimately spent a bachelor existence in an aviary with other
Finches. It seems there are very few hens imported. Those avicul-
turists who have this species have only cocks. I saw two fine birds
at Mr. Ezra's in May.
This year I introduced a hen yellow Canary to one of the cocks.
In June she went to nest and laid one egg, which was clear. Then
she laid three more and two young were hatched on 17th July. Fourteen
days later the elder left the nest. The general colouring was yellowish
brown with darker markings on the back, and lighter under parts--
typical young bird colouring--resembling a young Brown Linnet but
of rather a yellower tint. The second was similarly coloured but had
more yellow in the wings and tail, 44 variegated " I believe is the Canary
breeder's term.

I should be interested to hear if this hybrid has been bred before.
I know the Hooded Siskin has been crossed with the Canary and I

MASKED LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999128586206896" page_id="56773437"  page_num="280" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I think perhaps the following incident might possibly be
interesting to aviculturists with regard to the hardiness of the beautiful
Masked Lovebird (A. per sonata). I recently bought a pair of these
fascinating Lovebirds from Miss Chapman, of Birmingham. I did not
think they were sufficiently acclimatized to put outside altogether,
as the weather just then was anything but good ! However, I wanted
to put them in an outdoor aviary as soon as possible for breeding
purposes, hoping to get them to go to nest before too late this year.
I decided, therefore, in order to accustom them to oUr changeable
climate to put them out in the garden for a little each day, just as they
were, in the wire cage in which I bought them. After a few days, as the
weather seemed suitable, I decided to harden them off a little more
by leaving them out until after dinner. This particular evening about
8.30 p.m. I went out to fetch my birds in, when to my horror an open
door and an empty cage greeted me ! They had somehow managed
to open the door with their beaks ! A pair of Black-cheeked Lovebirds
of mine did this in the early spring but fortunately in that case escaped
into a room. This door, however, seemed too secure for it to be possible.
Feeling utterly helpless and scarcely daring to breathe even, I called
to them. As they already seemed to know me a little, I hoped by this
means to keep them in the garden for the moment! The smaller one
answered at once from a tree just over the cage. He was perching on
a coconut husk, which I had hung up for wild birds to nest in, and was
apparently studying the accommodation therein! However, the
next minute the larger one called from the very top of a fir-tree close
by, and the smaller one flew to it immediately, while I stood with
bated breath waiting for their next move. Needless to say they had a
perfectly glorious time flying from tree to tree, and to my joy always
within sight! One bird flew once to the very tip of a poplar-tree quite

a hundred yards away from the cage, and I never thought to see it
back again. However, he returned, and so on, until too dark to watch
any more. Eventually they both went to roost in the fir-tree close to
their cage--which I had not moved, of course--and there I had to leave
them for the night. I think, of the three, I spent the most miserable
one ! We have a great many owls here, and I felt sure they would
never survive for this reason, even if they managed to stand the cold
and dampness of the night air. The next morning I was awake at
5.30 a.m. ! From then onwards I watched from a window overlooking
the garden for any sign of my Lovebirds. I did not see or hear either
of them until about 7.30, although the wild birds had been awake for
a long time. My birds did not believe in rising too early apparently !
Suddenly the smaller one flew down from the fir-tree on to the top
of their cage, and struggled unsuccessfully for several minutes to pull
a millet spray through the bars. At last giving up the struggle he
actually went inside the cage, and so was soon captured. The other
one followed suit soon afterwards, much to my joy. Neither of them
were any the worse for their adventure in spite of a very thick mist
in the early morning and a very cold night. This, I think, proves
that the Masked Lovebird is not at any rate delicate, also that they
show a certain amount of intelligence, and would, I believe, become very
tame. They fly very swiftly, and are a truly beautiful sight to watch,
but, even so, I hope never to see mine at large again ! All the same,
it does make one feel rather sad, of course, to see them shut up, after
one has seen them at liberty ! This incident happened about a fortnight
or so ago, when the evenings were lighter. I venture to send it to you
in case you might consider it to be of any interest.

that it has so far proved to be the most useful. In the same way
the Mauve, which is probably, as you say in your article, " less striking "
than the Cobalt (although many prefer it to all others), may prove also
to be of immense value. As yet this colour is hardly a true " mauve ".
It should contain more pink in its composition. Improvement, however,
is being made all the time, and already birds bred this season from
crosses with the Mauves which Mr. Roland Green painted for our
coloured plate are better in this respect. It is the ambition of many
breeders to go still further in this direction and produce a pure Pink.
This I believe to be quite possible, but it will be some time before it is
attained, although many secretive and admittedly speculative crosses
are being tried !
One variety that I hope soon to establish is the Silver-Grey. Some
crosses produce a beautiful French grey colour, but only those with
grey face-spots are likely to moult out true Greys, those having darker
spots moulting into light Mauves.
Apart from their attractiveness, two most valuable varieties would
be the Cinnamon and the Brown or Bronze. From experiments already
being made these are apparently well on the way. Their value for
colour crossing would, of course, be inestimable.

Sir, --I should like to supplement my article on Parrakeet nesting
sites by a further short note. I find that moisture is apt to be another
factor essential to the healthy development of the young. If the nest
gets too dry, even though it consists of a natural tree trunk filled with
mould and set up in the open flight, rickets are still liable to appear.
It is therefore desirable to place the tree trunk under the open sky
where the rain will fall on it and not to attempt to give it the protection
of any kind of overhead shelter.

Sir,-- It is unusual for young Parrakeets, as distinct from Lorikeets,
Conures, etc., to re-enter the nest once they have flown. It is somewhat
curious therefore that this year a young Barraband and also a young
Malabar Parrakeet did so for some days. The Barraband was a single
bird, but the Malabar is one of three. None of the Barraband's brothers
and sisters of former years have ever gone back to their nest after leaving
it, nor have the other two members of the Malabar brood attempted
to follow the example of the third. It appears to be only another
instance of the remarkable amount of variation in individual conduct
observable among the more intelligent birds.

HONEY-GUIDES
Sir, --In regard to Mrs. Prestwich's letter respecting the nesting
habits of the Honey-guides, I must confess that from personal experience
I know nothing whatever. The nesting habits of all parasitical birds
are very difficult indeed to study, the Honey-guides especially, because
these birds inhabit the bush " district of Africa and roam about in
areas comprising hundreds of square miles of thick bushland, they
are also very hard to find, being shy and retiring birds unless engaged
in the pursuit of bees' nests, when they elicit the aid of human beings.
And again they only lay their eggs in the nest of birds which breed
in deep cavities in trees such as Wood Hoopoes, Glossy Starlings, etc.
I could never glean any facts from the Europeans out there, for their
apathy towards bird-life is appalling. Very few people in Africa know
the correct name of any single bird ; true they know the difference
between a Parrot and an Eagle, or between those Useful for the " pot

and the remainder which prove useful as living targets for shooting
practice.
I might mention in passing that the skin of the Honey-guides is
extremely thick and tough and resembles leather, which is no doubt
a protection against the stings of bees and wasps. These birds also
co-operate with the Ratel, a honey-eating Badger which lives in Africa.
The Honey-guides have an extremely gentle expression which is
no doubt caused by the beautifully coloured brown eyes and the per-
fectly shaped head. In weight they are heavier than any other bird
I know in proportion to their size.

Sir, --Reading through the back volumes of the Avicultural
Magazine I noticed the following --
" On going to press we have received from Mr. George Carrick a
cutting from the Glasgow Evening News of 27th April relating to the
sale of Bostock's Menagerie. The most extraordinary bidding took place
when ' The Australian Gin-Gin bird, a small bird of the Parrot kind '
was put up. The bidding commenced at 10 guineas, and the bird was
knocked down for 260 guineas. This bird was said to whistle many
tunes. Can any member enlighten us as to the proper name of the
' Gin-Gin ' bird ? " (Avicultural Magazine, 1909, p. 214).
Apparently no member could, as the query remained unanswered.
Can any reader solve the problem now ?
The only name I can trace with any semblance to " Gin-Gin " is
an obsolete name used by Latham for the Cingalese Alexandrine
Parrakeet (Palceornis eupatria), namely, Gingi Parrot.
Whatever the bird, it fetched an exorbitant price.

SOME BIRD NOTES FROM TENERIFE
By G. H. Gurney, F.Z.S.
(Concluded from p. 269)
Ravens, Corvus corax canariensis, nearly always in pairs, were much
in evidence ; for a few days two haunted a large Ficus-tree in the hotel
garden, occasionally I saw them on the beach, searching amongst the
debris thrown up by the tide ; and not at all disturbing the Kentish
Plovers, another very common bird, which were engaged in the same
pursuit. In the gardens and thickly grown barrancos, many interesting
birds occurred, nearly all species or sub-species peculiar to the islands.
For instance, Cabrera's Blackbird (Turdus merula cahrerce), which
swarmed, cocks seeming to be a great deal more plentiful than the very
dark-coloured hens ; Canaries ( Serinus canarius) singing everywhere and
breeding by 1st March, Chiffchaffs in swarms, Dusky Blackcaps (Sylvia
atricapilla ohscura) and the Tenerife Blue Titmouse. With regard to the
latter species, there are no less than four perfectly distinct races of
Blue Titmouse living in the Archipelago. On Gran Canaria and Tenerife
Parus cceruleus teneriffce is the form : the islands of Hierro and Palm

each, have their own sub-species, P. c. ombriosa and P. c. palmensis ;
while on the two large islands of the Eastern Group P. c. degener is
found, and it is extraordinarily interesting to note that these races
show special colouring in their plumage according to the conditions
in which they live. For instance, P. c. palmensis, which lives in a
verdant mountainous island, is much more richly coloured than the
pale forms, P. c. degener inhabiting the dry arid islands of Lanzarote
and Fuerteventura. All these forms are races of the European Blue
Titmouse (P. c. cceruleus ). Another common bird, though a very
interesting one, which was generally to be seen in the barrancos was
the Spectacled Warbler (Sylvia conspicillata bella ). The cocks are beauti-
ful in their breeding plumage, but they were very shy, and would quickly
dive into the thick foliage if they thought they were being observed.
On 19th March a pair were watched carrying food in their beaks,
but owing to the extremely precipitous nature of the ground it was
impossible to search for any nest; when frightened this bird Utters a
very peculiar chattering cry. On more open ground Berthelot's Pipits
occurred frequently all round Orotava ; they were also breeding and
were very confiding and tame. Here, too, the Bufescent Short-toed
Lark was found, often in company with the Pipits. One of the
commonest birds at Orotava was the Hoopoe : they Were to be seen
everywhere, and two pairs were feeding young in the Martianez
Barranco just outside the hotel. In the Laurel Forest Zone at about
2,000 feet, one finds quite a different lot of birds, amongst the more
interesting the Superb Redbreast (Erithacus rubecula superbus) was
common, splendid large dark brown birds, with brilliant ruby-coloured
breasts; while flocks of Brehm's Pale Swift (Micropus murinus
brehmorum) flew screaming up the barrancos. Another species, viz. the
small Black Swift (Micropus u. unicolor ), was also seen, but as a rule this
seemed to be commoner nearer the coast.
A long expedition was made on 19th March to a reputed locality
for the Teydean Blue Chaffinch in the Pine Forest Zone above a village
called La Sorriba. After an hour's drive in a motor, which was enlivened
by the great quantities of Neophrons, Kites, and Buzzards which were
continually in view, we found mules Waiting for Us at La Sorriba.
Leaving the road, we began to climb upwards on a very steep mountain

track, with splendid scenery all round. After an hour's arduous climb
one became aware that the character of the country was changing,
and single pine-trees began to appear, and very soon we had reached
the forest itself. After the very gloomy accounts we had heard of the
destruction of the pines by local woodcutters, we were agreeably
surprised to find that here, at any rate, Were many miles of quite
Unspoilt forest, indeed the " Pinar " stretched as far as the eye could
see in all directions. We were not lucky enough to see the " Azule ",
the local name for the Blue Chaffinch, which has probably of recent
years become very much rarer in Tenerife than it was in 1893 when
Mr. Meade-Waldo wrote " it appears to hold its own in all the pine
forests of Tenerife " ; indeed, he was able to bring a pair home, which
bred in his aviaries, and Mr. Ezra had a specimen, I believe, a few years
later. All the natives know of the existence of the " Azule ", and have
an entirely inflated idea of its value, and although I offered a good
price if a pair of live ones were obtained for me, I never received any.
The natives are rather fond of keeping birds alive in cages, and one
often sees the fine local form of Koenig's Partridge looking remarkably
well in a tiny cage in which it can hardly turn round ! In some of the
patios in the Spanish houses were small aviaries containing Canaries
(they prefer the domestic breed to the much more interesting local
wild Canary), Goldfinches and, in several instances Blackcaps, the
latter in each case looking the picture of health and in the finest
condition. In the Botanical Gardens at Orotava was a large outdoor
aviary containing, amongst a number of common foreign Finches,
two good Black-breasted Sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis), two or three
specimens of the Least Goldfinch (Carduelis c. parva), some Madeiran
Rock Sparrows, a single Thanner's Bunting (Emberiza calandra
thanneri ), and a remarkably tame Red-billed Chough, which followed the
gardener about everywhere. On 25th March an expedition was made
to the Charco of Maspalomas in the extreme south of Gran Canaria,
and a most interesting day was spent in this very remarkable locality.
Leaving Las Palmas in the early morning by motor-car, the road for
the first 10 miles or so was fairly good, but after passing a place called
Telde, it very soon degenerated into the merest track, and at times
ceased to exist altogether. Large birds of prey were almost continually

in sight, and flocks of Berthelot's Pipits and many Short-toed Larks
would fly up from the side of the road as we passed ; soon after passing
Telde one gets into practically desert country, arid stony plains, and
miles of bare sandy ground, which have a certain fascination of their
own, added to by the wonderful desert flora one passes. The groves
of huge Candelabra Euphorbia (Euphorbia canariensis) which are
peculiar to the islands, followed by another most striking species,
E. balsamifera , which here grows over 6 ft. high, the miniature Dragon-
tree (Kleinia neriifolia) growing out of the sand, and as a contrast
the bright green pendulous foliage of Plocama pendula, all make up
a fascinating picture, which was accentuated by the interest of the birds
we saw, species peculiar to this district; the fine Koenig's Shrike
(Lanius excubitor koenigii) becoming quite common, and looking very
conspicuous as they sat on the topmost shoot of an Opunta, watched
us intently as we passed. I have no doubt they were breeding, but
we had not time to stop and look for their nests, as I was anxious
to get to the Charco itself, another 30 miles further on. This reason
also prevented me searching for the Eastern Canarian Thick-knee
(CEdicnemus o. insularum ), which is found not uncommonly on these
plains, and the Trumpeter Bullfinch had to be missed too, though I
expected to find the species at the Charco. A collision between our
motor and a bullock-cart also caused a long delay, the terrific arguments
between the drivers of each vehicle as to who was in the wrong nearly
came to knives being drawn in true Canarian fashion, and so it was
almost one o'clock before we eventually got to our destination and were
able to start searching for the Coursers which we had come so far to see.
The Cream-coloured Courser is found here on little shingly
beaches between the sandhills which stretch along the shore. The
sUn pouring down from a torrid sky made the ground extremely hot,
shade there was none, and vegetation seemed to have entirely dis-
appeared: in fact almost the only life of any sort to be seen was
represented by four large Vultures sitting motionless on the shore,
who allowed Us to approach very close before flapping slowly off.
We soon saw a pair of Coursers running on the shingle in front of us.
They were not particularly shy, and would often stop and turn their
heads right round to have a look at Us. When running they are

extremely inconspicuous, but as soon as they fly tbe black on the under
side of the wings shows them up plainly.
In the foregoing notes I have only mentioned a very few of the
more interesting species we saw at Orotava ; a little later in the year
Golden Orioles arrive, also Bee-eaters and Rollers, and many rare
migrants turn up. A sub-species of the Houbara Bustard (Ghlamydotis
undulata fuertaventura) is resident on the island of Fuerte ventura,
but found nowhere else. The extremely rare Black Oyster-catcher
(Hcemato&amp;apos;pus meadewaldoi) is also found there; the Black-breasted
Sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis) is another species peculiar to Fuerte-
ventura. Many rare species of Petrel and Shearwater breed on the
rocky coasts of some of the islands ; while a very local Chat (Saxicola
dacotice muriclce) has so far only been found in the islets of Montana
Clara and Allegranza. Indeed, so attractive is the bird life on these
Canarian Islands that I can imagine no pleasanter spot for an ornitho-
logist to pass a winter in exists.

By Maurice Amsler, M.B., B.S., F.Z.S.
It was in May of this year that a pair of these birds came into
my possession, through the kindness of one of our new members,
Mr. Geoffrey Davies, I.C.S., who had just returned on leave from
India. These birds had reared four young before they left their native
country, and had started laying again towards the end of their journey
to England.
Both birds were most delightful pets, far tamer than any Barndoor
Fowl--they had, I believe, been captured when quite young, and
were therefore thoroughly domesticated and much attached to their
small home, which was one of the familiar double-domed Indian bamboo
cages with a compartment for each bird--it was in these restricted
quarters that the first brood was reared in India--but the birds being
so tame, it was possible to open the doors and let them out to forage
for food, have their dust-bath, etc., and it was only necessary to
approach them with the cage, when they would step inside with
exemplary obedience.

290 Maurice Amsler--Breeding of the Grey Francolin
When the Partridges came to me on 19th May, the hen had laid four
eggs of a creamy white colour, milch the size of that of our own
Partridge.
On arrival I placed their cage with the doors opened in a small
covered run about 4 feet square. This enclosure was in the shelter
of one of my aviaries, and it was possible to let the birds out into
the aviary or confine them to the run, at pleasure.
I constructed a nest of turf and hay in one corner and placed the
four eggs therein. By 26th May nine eggs had been laid, and the hen
began to sit in earnest on the 27th. I reckoned that they should hatch
about 20th June, but on several occasions I found one or more eggs
thrown out of the nest. Sometimes they seemed almost cold to the
touch, but I always replaced them as soon as discovered.
On 19th June to my dismay I found that the hen had given up
sitting. The eggs which looked fertile were stone cold. It was the work
of a few moments to take the eggs indoors and place them in hot water.
After a very few minutes of this treatment some of them began to
"wabble" and show signs of life, and not long after several of the
chicks could be heard " cheeping " inside the eggs.
Having no broody hen at the moment and no incubator, the eggs
were placed in a box on the top of my hot water cistern for the night--
the temperature here was only 100*--and I had grave fears that all
the chicks would be dead by the next day when I was able to place
them in an incubator belonging to a man of my acquaintance. Within
a few hours six of the nine eggs hatched, and the chicks at first looked
quite normal, though perhaps a little less active than do most Game-
birds when they first leave the egg. I gave them ants' eggs, green fly,
and Armitage's No. 1 chick food, but on the evening of the third day
three had died, and although the remaining three were put in a brooder
and carefully fed I lost the last one on 1st July at the age of ten days.
On the Same date the old hen began to lay again. She chose a corner
of the run immediately behind her bamboo cage, laying the eggs on
the hard concrete. In this place I again made a nest for her, and she
repeated her previous clutch of nine eggs.
Incubation began on 10th July, and the eggs hatched on the 31st.
All the eggs were fertile, but one chick died in the shell.

Maurice Amsler--Breeding of the Grey Francolin 291
During the last three days of the incubation I noticed that both
birds sat side by side and brooded the eggs, this certainly did not
happen on the first occasion. The cock continued his care and attention
of the chicks after they had hatched ; in fact I think he was, if
anything, the better parent.
This second hatch proved to be much more vigorous than the
first, no doubt because the chicks got the correct amount of warmth
and protection from their parents, and also because they were shown
what to eat and what to leave. Their diet consisted at first almost
entirely of live ants' eggs. No water was given for thirty-six hours, after
which I gave them a few weeds pulled up in the garden, which were
covered with rain drops. It was most interesting to note how quickly
they realized that this was meant for a drink. First the drops of water
were swallowed, and next the tips of the small blades of grass were
pulled off and swallowed. On 3rd August I removed the whole family
to a small movable run which I had prepared. This was placed on the
lawn and moved a yard or so each day. At night parents and chicks
were driven into a closed box attached to the run, where they were
safe from cold, rain, and rats. Within a very few days I had to move
the run on to a piece of rough grass at the bottom of my garden as
the parents dug large holes 6 inches or more deep in their search for
worms and insects.
When it was raining, or on those rare occasions when the sun shone
hotly, each parent would take charge of four chicks and protect them
from the weather. The cock, hitherto very friendly and docile, made no
bones in trying to spur anyone who dared put his hand into the run.
As the young grew the diet was increased and varied a good deal.
Ants' eggs were always welcome and cleaned Up at once, but as they
were also required for other birds, I found that gentles were equally
acceptable. A small amount of insectile mixture was eaten dry, also
crumbled sponge cake and Indian millet. At ten days the chicks would
devour any amount of earth worms--even quite large ones, if broken
into pieces an inch long, were eagerly fought for and gulped down.
I feel quite certain that fresh grass must form a very large part of the
diet of these birds, both young and old ; for each day when the run was
moved the previous day's site looked as if it had been recently mown.

All seemed to be going well, for the youngsters grew apace, and had
their feathers well developed at two weeks, when I had to cut one
wing in case of their escaping. I then noticed that one of the chicks
whom I had suspected of some slight deformity, had four legs instead
of two, the two supernumerary legs were ligatured and snipped off,
and the young bird ah once began to eat and seemed none the worse.
At three weeks the young birds were the size of Chinese Painted
Quail; they had lost the longitudinal striations, which I believe is
common to Game chicks, and could fly strongly notwithstanding the
trimming of one wing.
About this time I began to think they did not look quite so tight
in feather as they should, and a few days later one died, and several
others looked ill. I came To the conclusion that they were suffering
from absence of sunshine and the effects of the constant rain. So on
30th August I replaced the seven chicks and their parents in their
original aviary, but did not confine them to the little run when the
chicks were hatched. The result of this was that the birds spent most
of their time in the soaking grass of the outer flight, and I lost two more
young Partridges.
Having learned my lesson, and being left with only five chicks, the
family were once more placed in the closed run, and all has gone well
since then.
To-day, 21st September, at about eight weeks, the young Partridges
are about half-grown. They are much like the hen in colouration, and
I should say are perfectly independent, but the moment the parents
hear me or my man walking in the aviary they begin to peck loudly
at the walls of their run, which means that they want some gentles
or worms, and when these are forthcoming not one do they touch,
all are left for the young and growing family.
I think there are three males and two females among the young
birds ; of this it will be easy to make certain in a month or two, as the
males have well-developed spurs when adult.
This species, like the more familiar " Black Partridge ", is much
prized in India for fighting purposes, and I believe that good fighting
males realize quite high prices.

GEESE

The term " Goose " is applied to several orders of web-footed birds,
all, speaking generally, large birds with varying characteristics recalling
those of certain Ducks, and as a matter of fact there are many birds
known as Geese or Ducks which by rights belong to the same sub-
families, and in many cases these so-called " Geese " and " Ducks "
interbreed freely (e.g. Egyptian Geese and Sheldrakes). As a rule Geese
have thicker feet and not such flat bills as have Swans and Ducks, and
they are not so aquatic. Some indeed do not like to go into water. Their
food mostly consists of grass, which, with the addition of grain, is their
usual diet in confinement. Most kinds of Geese are hardy and long-lived.
A number of pairs of different kinds can be kept together in a park or
other enclosure where there is water, and as a rule they will agree well
together. The Cereopsis, the Chloephaga, the Sandwich Island Geese,
the Spurwings and Egyptian Geese are, however, very quarrelsome
in spring and must be isolated in pairs in large enclosures well furn-
ished with grass and water. Geese are monogamous, and pair for life ;
they make admirable parents and usually find no difficulty in rearing
their young. They do not breed until they are three years old at the
earliest, and if they are older than this it is all to the good.
The true Geese, genus Anser , are migratory birds which nest in the
Arctic or temperate zones and go South for the winter. They are hardy
but not prolific in confinement, and must be pinioned to make them
stay. The males are rather quarrelsome in spring, but are not seriously
bad tempered and do not harry weaker birds. As soon as the young are
hatched disputes cease and the families often unite in a flock. The
sexes are alike, except that the female is the smaller.
The Grey-lag Goose ( Anser anser) is the ancestor of the domestic
Goose, the grey variety being like it, grey plumaged with pink feet and
bill. It is more inclined to breed and is less migratory than the other
wild species.
The Bean Goose (A. fabalis) is much smaller and darker, with
an orange bill, black at the base and on the nail ; its feet are orange.

The Short-billed Goose (A. brachyrhynchus) resembles the last
named, but is smaller, has a shorter bill and rosy feet.
The White-Fronted Goose (A. albifrons) is smaller and more
elegant in shape. It may be recognized by its white forehead and
the very dark deep brown spots on its breast.
The Dwarf Goose (A. erythropus) is the preceding in miniature
with slightly darker plumage ; it is the prettiest bird of the whole
genus.
The Bar-headed Goose (A. indicus) nests in Thibet and winters
in India ; it may be known from all its relatives by its pretty pearl
grey plumage picked out with darker grey and white, and by the two
black stripes across the nape of the neck and the yellow bill and feet.
It is often imported but is usually susceptible to cold and not very
prolific ; it has, however, bred freely at Kew Gardens. If it is not
pinioned it is apt to wander away, but it has not been found to do so
at Kew.
The Emperor Goose (Anser canagica) from North-east Asia and
North-west America is very rare and has only been bred in captivity
of late years. It is very handsome, bluish-grey, every feather edged
black and white. The sides of the neck and crown of the head are
yellowish white, the feet are yellow, and the beak rosy grey. It is
easily bred in confinement and is very gentle. It requires good pasture,
maize best not be given, being too fattening and likely to bring on
apoplexy. The sexes are alike in plumage but not in size. This species
cannot stand heat and requires fresh running water.
The Chinese Goose (Anser cygnoides) from North Asia is represented
in many farmyards by a domesticated variety from which it is
distinguished only by its more slender figure. The wild species is prac-
tically unknown in confinement. The male is the larger and has also
a large knob above its bill.
The Snow Geese are like the preceding but have rose-coloured
bills and feet. They are white or sometimes of a light bluish-grey colour.
They are inhabitants of North America and Eastern Asia and
are accidental visitors to Europe.
The White Snow Goose (A. hyperboreus ) is pure white with black
flights ; young birds are greyish-brown above. It begins to breed at

two years old, but does not go to nest readily and takes a
long time to make up its mind. Unpinioned birds will usually stay.
A larger species (A. nivalis) has been imported, a native of
Eastern North America. The Blue Snow Goose (A. coerulescens) is
sometimes considered to be a mere variety of the white; and
when the two interbreed their young may be either blue or white,
but the blues will be whiter underneath. This Goose is grey-blue with
dark grey markings, and with partly white wings, head, neck and
abdomen. It is met with in North America, east of the Rocky
Mountains.
Ross' Goose (A. rossi) is much smaller and more elegant; it is all
white except for the black flights. It breeds freely in captivity.
It is quite one of the prettiest Geese and is a native of North-west
America.
The Geese of the genus Branta are like the preceding species in
disposition, but are more marine; they have smaller bills, and
longer, thinner necks. The sexes can only be distinguished by their size.
The Bernicle Goose (Branta leucopsis) is one of the prettiest
European species, having its plumage heavily marked with black, white
and grey. It thrives and breeds freely in confinement. If the young
are left unpinioned they stay fairly well where they were born.
The Brent Goose (B . bernicla) is exclusively marine. It lives well
in confinement where it can have grass, but soon dies if fed on grain
alone. To our knowledge it has not yet been bred in confinement.
It is smaller, darker, and duller coloured than the preceding species.
The Red-breasted Goose (B. ruficollis) from Siberia has unusual
markings. It is the handsomest of the genus. Black, with the sides
of the neck and the breast bright rust coloured edged with white ;
it has also white about the head and under the body and wings. It is
very scarce ; does well in confinement, and has been bred at Woburn.
The Canada Goose (B. canadensis) is the largest of the wild
Geese ; it is a fine striking bird, in colour brown mixed with fawn, and
with a black head and neck. A white streak from one cheek to the
other passes under its bill. It is a native of North America, breeds freely
in confinement, and need not be pinioned. Its voice is one of its charms,
and as it calls principally while flying, it is preferable if only on this

account to leave it full winged. The male bird becomes quarrelsome
in the nesting season and may injure other Geese or even small Swans,
but it does not attack Ducks. Once the young are hatched the gander
abandons his warlike demeanour and with his family seeks the company
of his kind, thereby refuting the theory of certain naturalists that
the fierceness of breeding male birds is a provision of nature to ensure
sufficient space wherein to find food for the young.
Hutchin's Goose (B . hutchinsi) inhabits the same neo-Arctic regions
and resembles the preceding but is only half as large. It is rarely
met with in confinement. Another occasionally imported species which
resembles the first but is even smaller is B. minima from Western
America. They do well in confinement but, unlike their larger relatives,
are shy breeders.
The Sandwich Island Goose (Nesochen sandvicensis) is almost
extinct in a wild state. It is a very fine bird and has very pleasing
habits. Its colouring is brown variegated with grey and its neck
feathers are barred with light fawn ; its head, a stripe behind the neck,
beak and feet are black. This species bred freely in the London
Zoological Gardens many years ago and has been kept by Herr F. E.
Blaauw at Gooilust for the last thirty years. It is easily bred, but
in spite of this is not easy to manage, one reason being that the eggs
are laid very early in the year, the end of February or the beginning
of March, that is long before fine weather can be looked for. Conse-
quently they often fail to hatch or the young die from cold nights and
changes of temperature. Another reason is the spitefulness of the
males ; sometimes a gander has lived peacefully for years with its
mate, and then suddenly will attack and kill her, and one has not
always the luck to intervene in time. Some males are so ill-tempered
that they cannot ever safely be left with a female and always need
watching. The young are easily reared and thrive best when they are
left to their parents. They are susceptible to cold, particularly if it
comes suddenly after a long period of warmth, and it is wise to bring
them into shelter at night during early summer.
The South American Geese belonging to the genus Chloephaga form
a very distinct group. They are very handsome birds both in shape
and colour. They are more terrestrial than aquatic, are long-

legged and walk well; they have very small bills. The genus
contains six species; in three of these the sexes are alike, and
in three they differ, but both are pretty. Those in which
the sexes are unlike are the Magellan Goose (Chloephaga magelianica)
from Patagonia and the Falkland Isles, which is kept throughout
Europe, where it breeds freely and does well. The sexes are altogether
unlike each other, the male being white, striped on the sides with
black, with a grey back. His wings are grey with black and white
flights and a large reddish-brown speculum, his tail is black as are also
his bill and feet. The female is russet where the male is white, her wings
are like his but her feet are yellow. The male whistles, but the female
has a loud call resembling the word a purr-roor ". The sex of young
birds can easily be distinguished as soon as they get their feathers,
although at that time the males have grey heads instead of white ones.
In the breeding season these Geese are very vicious towards their
companions, particularly if these happen to be Sheldrakes. They
can be allowed full power of flight. The nearly related species
(G. inornata) is frequently imported, in this the male has the breast as
well as the sides barred. The females are identical. They are natives
of Chili and the Argentine.
The Ruddy-headed Goose (C . rubidiceps) is much smaller. The
sexes are alike and resemble the hen Magellan, only with redder
heads and greyer bodies and more delicate markings. Their voices
differ like those of the foregoing species. This is a far rarer and more
delicate species than those already mentioned. It requires very pure
water with fresh grass. It is peculiar to the Falkland Isles.
The Ashy-headed Goose (C. poliocepJiala) is another pretty little
species and is very rare. Needs similar treatment to the preceding
one and like it breeds freely. Both sexes have ashy-grey heads,
mahogany backs and breasts, white abdomens, and black and white
striped sides ; bills and tails the same colour as the Ruddy-headed ;
orange yellow feet spotted with black. It is found in Patagonia,
South Chili and the Chiloe Isles.
The Kelp Goose (C . hybrida) is a peculiar bird. The male is pure
white with black and yellow spotted bill and yellow feet. The female
is dark brown above and has white stripes on head, neck, breast and

sides ; her abdomen, rump and tail are white ; she sports a white
and green speculum ; has a flesh-coloured bill and yellow feet. This
handsome species is met with in the Straits of Magellan, Tierra del
Fuego, and the Falkland Islands. Unlike its fellows, the Kelp Goose
does badly in confinement, which is accounted for by its habits in
its own country. There, where the species is fairly plentiful it is always
found among rocks by the seashore. It does not go inland to feed
like other geese, but lives exclusively on a kind of algae called " lutsche "
by the natives, and doubtless also on small marine creatures. We once
brought a Gander back, but in spite of every care he only lived for a
few months at Gooilust; although he fed freely on all sorts of things
they did him no good ; he " went light 5 ' and finally died. We brought
with us a bag of dried " lutsche " bought at Santiago, where it is sold
for human food, but it became exhausted, and could not be obtained
in Europe.
Apart from this individual we only know of two other importations ;
one in 1868 to the London Zoo, and one more recently to Berlin ; but
neither bird lived for any length of time. Both male and female are very
handsome, and it would be interesting to make another attempt at
acclimatizing them.
The Andean Goose ( C . melanoptera) is rare in confinement but
has been bred in the London Zoological Gardens. It chiefly inhabits
mountainous parts of south-west South America. The sexes are alike
but the male is much the larger. It is a big white bird and its greenish
black wings have a purplish speculum; its tail is black, its
shoulders light brown with darker spots, beak and feet are red.
This species does not mind the cold, but is subject to various
diseases. It is easily tamed, but the Ganders are apt to turn spiteful,
pursuing their keepers, and puffing themselves out with curious
whistling noises. They appear to dislike the water.
The Blue-winged Goose (Cyanochen cyanopterus) from North-east
Africa has only twice been imported, but there are now several
at Gooilust. It is ashy brown with pale grey spots, black flights and
grey-blue wing coverts ; bill and feet are black. It seems to be
nocturnal in habit, only moving about like a true Goose after dusk.
It keeps motionless during the day, and if obliged to move it does so

in a very curious attitude, its head lying on its back and the chest
advanced. It has been bred by Herr Blaauw. Gander and Goose are
alike in their plumage, but she is the smaller and has a different call.
The Maned Goose (Chenonetta jubata) from Australia has
much the appearance and size of a Carolina Duck. It is one of our
prettiest species, the male bird's plumage is silvery grey and black
with deep chestnut head and back ; the feathers at the back of the neck
are long and form a kind of mane. The female is light brown with grey
flecks. Both sexes have very distinctive plumage and the effect is
delightful. This species is pleasing both in character and habits ; it is
very hardy and needs pure water and fresh grass. It breeds very
.irregularly and doubtless it would be desirable to give it a nest
receptacle like that used by Mandarins and Carolinas, a small kennel
raised above the ground and reached by a sloping plank. It bred
successfully thus in the London Zoological Gardens.
The Cereopsis Goose (Cereopsis novce-hollandice ) is a large and
remarkable Australian Goose ; its colouring, which is the same for
both sexes, is pale ashy grey, having blackish spots on the wings, the
cere greenish yellow, the legs are deep rose colour and the feet black.
It is a terrestrial bird and often travels far from water. It is very
aggressive during the nesting season, its victims being chiefly terrestrial
birds ; even Cranes find them dangerous. It is a very hardy species,
but often breeds in the depth of winter when it is necessary to shelter
the nestlings. The female has a deeper voice than her mate, and the
sexes can easily be distinguished owing to this peculiarity. The
Cereopsis must be pinioned to make it stay ; young birds disappear
with extraordinary rapidity unless pinioned.
We shall now consider those birds which, though popularly known
as " Geese ", scientifically speaking are really intermediary between
the Geese and Ducks.
The Spur-winged Goose (Plectropterus gambensis) and its related
species make up a little African genus of which Some examples are
imported from time to time. They are large birds with very large pink
feet, metallic black and white plumage, strong beaks with a purplish
red knob. They are unfortunately ugly and clumsily built, very
spiteful, and very susceptible to cold. The sexes are alike.

The Pied or Semi-palmated Goose (Anseranas semipalmata) from
Australia slightly resembles the above-named bird but anatomically
it is altogether different. Its colouring is dull black and pure white
but its shape is far more pleasing. Its bill and slightly palmated feet
are orange yellow. It is a hardy and harmless species. The sexes are
alike. It has not yet bred in captivity though eggs have been laid.
If allowed the use of its wings it perches freely. It has a peculiar odour.
The Egyptian Goose (Alopochen cegyptiacus), a native of Africa and
Palestine, really belongs to the Sheldrake group, with which it inter-
breeds readily and produces fertile hybrids. It is hardy and prolific
but very quarrelsome. If kept in a small enclosure it will kill all the
birds it can master, but on a lake it only attacks Geese and Shelducks
and leaves small Ducks in peace. Young unpinioned birds usually
stay well unless their parents drive them off. The sexes are alike in
plumage, which is greyish fawn prettily relieved with chestnut and
golden red. The wings are white, reddish brown and tawny with black
primaries. Feet and bill are pink. The Gander hisses and the Goose
makes a loud cackling.
The Orinoco Goose (Alopochen jubatas) is found on the banks of
the great tropical American streams, particularly the Orinoco and its
tributaries. It is very rare in confinement. Its head, neck and breast
are greyish white, the mantle is russet and brown, back, wings and tail
metallic black, the under parts a mixture of russet, white and black ;
beak red and black ; feet pinkish orange. The female may be distin-
guished by her smaller size, and resounding cry, while the male whistles
like the male Magellan Goose. The species has been kept several times
in the London Zoo and has been represented at Gooilust since 1886,
but it is only rarely imported and fresh blood is seldom available.
The Orinoco Gander is very aggressive, but usually his temper is
directed against human beings and not against his mate.
This species is not hardy in Europe, and must be taken into a heated
shelter as soon as the weather turns frosty. Even in autumn it should
be driven in as soon as the nights become chilly, and shut up in a shed
well furnished with dry straw. The Geese usually start laying late in the
season, which is a good thing as there is more hope of warm weather.
They lay at least eight to ten eggs every year, but very few are fertile,

so that one may consider oneself very lucky if four or five hatch out.
These Geese often fall ill if they are allowed to sit, accordingly it is
prudent to take the eggs away after a few days' incubation and put
them under a small kind of hen.
The young grow very quickly, and are not usually difficult to rear
if they are given plenty of ants' eggs and kept warm. They must be
kept in a warm place as soon as the weather begins to turn cold.
The Orinoco Goose is a splendid bird, but requires great care to
keep it healthy in our climate. It is closely related to the Egyptian
Goose with which it interbreeds very readily.

By The Marquess of Tavistock
This pretty Palceornis is an Uncommon bird in confinement; only
four have come into my possession since I began aviculture, and I
have seen but two more in other collections. The first specimen I
ever owned--a cock given me by Canon Dutton--I tried to mate with
a hen Moustache Parrakeet (P. fasciata) living at liberty. The two
birds greeted one another in the most friendly way, but Unhappily
the Malabar had not learned the language of his alien bride and did
not connect her with her cries when she was out of his sight. The
consequence was that he lost touch with her the evening following his
release, strayed, and was never heard of again. Several years later
my present breeding pair reached me. They were in immature plumage,
and as the beaks of both were black with a little red I concluded that
I had a couple of young cocks. It was, theref ore, an agreeable surprise
to me when the beak of one gradually became wholly red, and that of
the other entirely blackish, showing that I had a true pair. For a
considerable time the hen Malabar did not appear very strong, and
showed poor quality of feather. Feather weakness seems not Uncommon
in the species, as a breeding hen at the Zoological Gardens ultimately
had a very weak and ragged growth of feathers from close confinement
and lack of fruit, and, though she improved a little after coming into

my possession, I was never able to make a good bird of her to the
end of ber days.
For two years the Malabars showed no sign of nesting. In the
third they inspected a nest-box but got no further. In the fourth
the hen laid and got egg-boUnd--a very common occurrence with
this species, which likes to breed in February if it can. The three eggs
were given to foster parents, but proved infertile, as the cock, for
some reason, would not pair properly with the hen, though in most
ways he was very attentive to her and extremely interested in the nest.
Later in the spring the hen Malabar again laid, this time without
accident, as the weather was then warm, but once more the eggs were
clear.
I began to fear that my cock was useless as a breeder, and it was
an agreeable surprise when, the following year, one of the three eggs
proved fertile and hatched. All went well for about ten days, and then
one morning I opened the aviary shelter to find the nest-box
fallen to the ground and the young bird inside cold and dead.
The nest was fastened to the side of the aviary shelter by
means of a very large nail passing through a brass eyelet hole.
Naturally I supposed that the nail or the fastening had got
loose, but strange to say the latter was perfectly intact and seoUre,
while the big nail, with an upward cant, was as firm in the wood of the
shelter as when it was first driven in ! I can only conclude that my
enemy X, annoyed at the prospect of a young Malabar being success-
fully reared, had, in the dead of night, detached the heavy box from
the nail and hurled it to the ground !
This yeiar I determined that whatever games X might play, he should
not be able to repeat his little joke of 1926, so I provided the Malabars
with a perpendicular natural tree trunk in the shelter, about five feet
high and hollow for half its depth. For some reason the birds were
slow in settling down. April passed and May was well advanced, and
I began to have serious fears that they would drop into moult without
laying at all. The cock was anxious enough to set Up house and was
constantly rushing into the shelter with loud screeches and trying to
entice his mate to enter the hole. Finally, as on a previous occasion
when she had been Unduly slow in taking up her domestic duties, he lost

all patience and went for her tooth and nail. His display of temper
was all the more amusing as on ordinary occasions he invariably gave
way to her ; indeed in their behaviour to one another the pair always
reminded me of human married couples living in that bygone period
when husbands and wives addressed one another as " Mr." and " Mrs."
and treated each other with a kind of distant courtesy. The Malabars
were really quite fond of one another, but the hen always liked to
pose as being rather severe and managing, and as a rule her mate
humoured her out of politeness. During the winter and early spring
months they would display to each other from a distance, bowing
slowly with the neck extended, " chin " depressed, tail slightly
raised, and iris contracting. Occasionally during the display the
hen would bring Up food from her crop, but she never fed her mate
nor allowed him to approach her closely. Only when she was nesting
in earnest would she let him feed her. In the ordinary way the cock
appeared to be an almost henpecked husband, but it was only on
sufferance that she drove him about, as on the rare occasions when she
really annoyed him he put her in her place in no Uncertain fashion.
After the tiff above mentioned the hen went to the nest in a chastened
frame of mind, her movements being accelerated by her angry spouse.
At the entrance hole she turned on him and although a moment before
he had been making her fly for her life, he got out of her way at once,
for it is etiquette for cocks to give way to their wives at the nest. So
long as she was doing her duty he was still prepared to show her the
courtesy due to a lady, but at the same time there were limits to the
indulgence she had a right to expect, and in future she would remember
what those limits were ! One of the strangest, most interesting and
most amusing things I have observed with breeding Parrakeets is
the anger and distress the cocks often display when their partners
will not settle down in an eligible residence that has been provided for
them. This annoyance is not due to thwarted sexual instinct, as it is
displayed just as much when the hen is willing to pair ; neither is it
irrational, for it is hardly ever shown when there is no nest within
reach and the birds are in breeding condition.
After the lesson she had received the hen Malabar began to settle
down to business and had laid before the end of May. I was still anxious,

The Breeding of the Malahar Parrakeet
however, as she sat Unsteadily, coming off the nest at the slightest
alarm, while a dropped feather or two hinted at the arrival of the
moult already overdue. However, she did not desert. In due course all
four eggs hatched and early in August the young ones left the nest at
intervals of some days. In colour they are not Unlike the old birds
and more closely resemble the adult male than any other nestling
Palceornis I have seen. The areas of the plumage, which are grey in
the adult, are heavily washed with green in the nestling, giving a more
Uniform green tint to the whole body. The black ring of the adult
is quite clearly indicated by a dark line widening Under the lower
mandible. To my surprise, the beaks of all are not black but red, two
having a small dusky patch below each nostril. Presumably, therefore, the
dark beaks of certain female Palceornis are not a primitive characteristic
but a recent development, and it is the brighter red beak of the male
which is the primitive feature. The red-beaked female Javan Parrakeet
would appear to be a more primitive type than the dark-beaked female
of the almost identical Moustache Parrakeet. Does anyone know the
colour of the beak of a hen Moustache Parrakeet when she first leaves
the nest ?
On the day on which the last young Malabar emerged I was dis-
turbed, when passing the aviary, to hear flutterings and screeches,
which told all too plainly that a row was in progress in the shelter.
Had the parents, now that success was almost in sight, grown tired of
their offspring and decided to murder the lot ? On opening the door
of the shelter the cock popped out, and I found the hen and the youngest
baby both looking Upset and dishevelled and clinging to the wire. What
had happened, and what was to be done for the best ? Both adults
were moulting, so there was no question of a second nest. Had the
parents quarrelled about the education of their family or had the hen
attacked her youngest child and been very properly punished by the
father ? Belying on the fact that the male Parrakeets are usually
more patient and devoted to their newly fledged young than the
mothers, I removed the hen Malabar to another aviary and hoped
for the best. Luckily all went well, and the cock proved a model parent.
In the care of his children he was amusingly methodical. Each one
was fed at a different time to the others ; he seldom fed all at once.

The main aviaries consist of a range of twelve, facing south. Each
aviary has a shelter 6 feet wide, 4 feet deep, 6 feet high front, and
7J feet high back. A large window of Muranese glass is fitted in the
front of each. The floors are cement. Attached to each house is a flight
18 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet high, half-inch wire netting being
used. Shrubs, etc., were originally planted, but as the majority of the
inhabitants are Parrakeets, they were quickly denuded of leaves, and
now only the skeletons remain.
The inmates and their doings this year are as follows :--
No. 1.--A pair of Abyssinian Lovebirds, went to nest in May, and
laid four eggs which they did not hatch ; they are now incubating
again.
No. 2.--A large flock of Green Budgerigars have had a long
succession of nests and have done fairly well, but quite a number of
eggs have not been hatched.
No. 3.--Some odd Parrakeets, including a Cockatiel, an All-green
Parrakeet, and a Lineolated Parrakeet.

No. 4.--Eed-crested Cardinals and a Purple-eared G-lossy Starling.
No. 5.--A colony of Nyasa Lovebirds, have been very successful;
quite a large proportion of the eggs laid were hatched and the young
reared.
No. 6.--Madagascar Lovebirds, have only played at nesting ; eggs
laid everywhere but in the right place.
No. 7.--A pair of Red-speckled Conures (C. euops), have now been
out of doors four years. They have nested four times during the last
eighteen months, laying four or five eggs on each occasion ; in each
case they have eaten the eggs after sitting for ten days to a fortnight.
They are a true pair, but possibly the eggs are infertile.
No. 8.--Black-cheeked Lovebirds, have reared several youngsters.
No. 9.---A cock Madagascar Lovebird mated to a hen Red-faced
Lovebird, very friendly but do not seem interested in nest-boxes.
No. 10.--A cock Madagascar mated to a hen Black-cheeked Love-
bird, five eggs were laid but proved infertile. A Madagascar supplied
as a mate earlier in the year was scalped by the Black-cheek.
No. 11.--Masked Lovebirds, no attempt at nesting yet, but days
are still young.
No. 12.--A pair of Turquoise-rumped Parrotlets (Psittacula cyan-
opygia) from Western Mexico, wintered out successfully, but as far as
I can tell have never ventured inside a nest-box.
Another aviary with a shelter 12 feet wide and 6 feet deep, and with
a flight 42 feet long and 36 feet wide, is in course of erection ; this
will be tenanted by a mixed series of Lovebirds next spring. Two
smaller aviaries are reserved for the use of two African Grey Parrots
and a Blue-fronted Amazon, and for any British birds that come to
hand. A delightful pair of finger-tame Abyssinian Lovebirds completes
oUr family of aves at present.

to the Budgerigar as to other animals and plants, and an able article
by Consul-General Cremer shows how these laws can be relied upon
implicitly, and if a breeder understands them and knows the pedigree
of his stock he can calculate with accuracy as to what colour and what
percentage he may confidently hope to produce.
The chief difficulty when breeding from blue-bred greens or green
split-blues, as General Cremer calls them, is that a percentage of the
progeny are pure greens which cannot be distinguished from blue-bred
greens from the same nest. These can be tested by crossing them with
blues. If pure greens they will produce only greens, albeit these will
be blue-bred, but if themselves blue-bred (or split-blue) they will
produce some 50 per cent of blue offspring.
Another collector from the East has arrived in the person of
Mr. Mayer, who has landed a choice collection of birds, mostly from
New Guinea. Amongst these the following are worthy of special
mention : A Blue-collared Parrakeet (Geojfroyus cyanicollis), a very
beautiful species, though apparently delicate ; a Pleasing Lorikeet
(Hypocharmosyna placens), no larger than a Budgerigar, Black-winged,
Black-capped, Blue-streaked, and Purple-capped Lories ; Red Birds
of Paradise, Black-capped Fruit Pigeons, and Victoria Crowned Pigeons,
not to mention a large number of Three-coloured Parrot Finches.
The Emu for July, 1927, is a particularly interesting number,
containing as it does accounts of some of the most beautiful and rare
of the Grass Parrakeets, and their present status in their native habitat.
Mr. E. Ashby writes on the Orange-breastedand Blue-winged Parrakeets
(Neophema chrysogaster and N. chrysostoma) as observed by him.
Dr. W. W. Giblin and Mr. A. W. Swindells supply notes on the nesting
habits of the Blue-wing in Tasmania, while Miss Florence M. Irby
writes on the Scarlet-chested or Splendid Parrakeet ( N . splendida) and
the Paradise Parrakeet (Psephotus pulcherrimus) , both of which exquisite
species she has been fortunate enough to observe in their wild state.

information that this species also nests in holes in banks of creeks
after the manner of Kingfishers, an observation that has not previously
been published. Still another rare Parrakeet is the subject of an article
by Lord Clive in this issue, namely the Ground or " Button-grass "
Parrakeet (Pezoporus wallicus), which is still comparatively common
in South-West Tasmania, though gradually disappearing in front of
advancing settlement and settlers' cats.
A rare bird that has just been acquired by the Zoological Society
and has not been represented in the collection for nearly forty years is
the Horned Screamer ( Palamedea cornuta), from the Amazon valley.
It is as large as a Turkey, black above with white underparts and
mottled black and white breast, and on the head it carries a thin
horn. It has very large feet and feeds chiefly upon grass and other
vegetable matter. It is extremely tame and delights in being petted.

TANYGNATHUS LUCONENSIS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997030333333333" page_id="56773479"  page_num="308" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I have recently received a Tanygnathus Parrakeet ( Tanyg -
nathus luconensis) which is perhaps new to aviculture, although, strange
to say, it figures in Levaillant's quaint old book on Parrots. In size it
resembles Mueller's Parrakeet and in general plumage the Great-
billed Parrakeet, but it differs from the latter in having a wide bar
of turquoise blue across the head and hardly any blue on the rump.
There is a well-marked strip of brownish bronze feathers in each wing,
and some of the smaller wing feathers near the back and mantle are
broadly marked with blue. Taken as a whole, the bird's colouring is
distinctly beautiful, although, like all Tanygnathi, it lacks grace of
form. Unlike a captive Greatbill, which is Usually sluggish and morose,
the Lucon Parrakeet is active and friendly. He talks in a somewhat
husky and indistinct voice, and displays to a human friend in the
usual manner of the genus by throwing up the head and elongating the
neck. Occasionally he Utters a series of short screeches like a Palseornis

Parrakeet or Comire, which have no counterpart in the Greatbill's
repertoire. I hope eventually to allow the bird full liberty, and it will
be interesting to see whether in a state of freedom he indulges in any-
thing resembling the extraordinary " song 55 of his larger relative.

Sir, --In company, probably, with many other aviculturists, I have
received a few pairs of Fischer's Lovebird--the last member of the genus
to be introduced to British aviculture. It appears as hardy and ready to
nest as its other near relatives, the new arrivals settling down at once
in an out-door aviary and beginning to take an interest in the logs the
day they were put in. Fischer's Lovebird is much handsomer than
the Nyasa, with most attractive and rather UnUs.Ua! shades of red-gold

colouring about the face, head, and neck. Mine have a habit of working
at their nests extremely late in the evening, long after every other bird,
except the crepuscular Bourke's Parrakeet, has gone to roost.
The plate that appeared in the Magazine hardly, I think, does
justice either to A.fischeri or A. per sonata, the latter especially being
far more strikingly coloured than it is represented. I have four masked
Lovebirds--a pair and two odd ones. The pair are nesting and may have
young. The Masked Lovebird appears less amiable than its three
nearest relatives, and the first I received murdered one of their number
on the short journey from London to Havant. I must say, however,
that there is no undue squabbling between the nesting pair and the two
others, as would take place in the case of Peachfaces, so it may be that
it is only when its temper is exacerbated by uncongenial surroundings
that the Masked Lovebird's supply of love runs short. Certainly, as far
as appearances go, A. per sonata, with his bright red nose, coal black
face, large white eye circles, and yellow waistcoat, is the most perfect
little nigger-devil imaginable !

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999221866666667" page_id="56773481"  page_num="310" year="" vol="">
Sir, --With reference to the correspondence in the October number
of the Avicultural Magazine on breeding A. roseicollis, I succeeded
in rearing four young from one nest last season (1926). From my
observations I would say that the hen solely incubated the eggs,
although the cock went in and out of the coco-nut husk, presumably
to feed the hen, but rarely stayed more than a few minutes. Within
a week of the young hatching, the hen died from inflammation, and
the cock succeeded in rearing the young himself.
One young got its wing caught in a joint in the husk and unfortu-
nately died before I found anything wrong ; one I gave away, leaving
father and two young. Unfortunately I omitted to separate, and in
February this year one was killed by the parent, leaving one which
I am sure is a hen, although they have not shown signs of nesting.
Contrary to general practice, these birds made no nest other than
scooping out the husk.-

They are most spiteful, although at present I have a pair of Blossom-
heads with them, so far with no bad results.
My birds are noisy especially at day-break, but not unpleasantly so.
I feed solely on canary and white millet, the birds refusing
everything else.
I may state that the cock was noticeably smaller than his mate.
A. E. Blythe Jackson.
Sir, --I have successfully bred Agapornis roseicollis for some years
past, both in cages and aviaries, and my observations have shown that
the hen always incubates. The cock feeds her on the nest, which she
rarely leaves, and himself returns to the nest at night.
This year I have had a unique opportunity of making observations,
as my present pair are perfectly tame and do not in any way resent
interference, and on looking into the nest in the evening I have found
the hen covering the eggs, and the cock sitting by her side.
Wm. K. H. Bearby.
Sir, --When I bred the Rosy-faced Lovebird in a cage some years
ago, the cock of the pair being easily recognized by a defect in his
plumage, I found that the hen incubated the eggs. The cock entered
the nest at times of emergency, especially when the young were just
hatched, but he played no important part in the hatching of the eggs.
Were it not for the extraordinary amount of individual variation
in the conduct of Parrakeets of the same species, I should certainly be
tempted to conclude that Mr. Nicholson had mistaken the sexes, an
error which is not difficult to make, as a hen bird in breeding condition
will occasionally imitate, without exception, all the actions which are
commonly peculiar to the cock.

are creamy white, a very long blue crest of recurved feathers reaches
beyond the nape of the neck. As a matter of fact, I have had them since
last May, and though they have done very well, they were not in
sufficiently good condition when they arrived for any chance of
breeding them this summer. More recently I have obtained a pair of
White-crowned Glossy Starlings, Spreo albicapillus, 1 from Abyssinia.
This Starling is one of the largest of the group, and very noisy. They are
of a dull oily green colour, much marked and barred with creamy white,
head pure white, a very distinctive looking bird. This species also I
do not think has been previously imported alive.

THE YELLOW-BREASTED CISSA

This fine bird, figured from nature in the accompanying plate, was
first discovered in Cochin-China as far back as 1846, but it was not until
1885 that the collection then made and deposited in the Forms Museum
was sorted out and that G-iglioli and Salvadori named it ; as the type
specimen was entirely faded blue and white, they called the bird
hypoleuca, " white-bellied," an entirely wrong expression which we
had better change in English into " yellow-breasted The fresh bird,
in nature, is pale Naples yellow underneath, bright grass green above,
with a broad black band over the eye, black subterminal spots on the
tail and chestnut markings on the wings.
In captive specimens of all Cissas kept in indoor cages with
insufficient fresh animal food, all the yellow in the plumage fades to
white, and the green becomes pale blue, with greyish olive markings
on the wings. In that state, however, the present bird looks different,
but still quite handsome. The same thing happens to skins if they are
not carefully protected from all light. It seems that daylight destroys
the yellow pigment, which has to be constantly replaced through
substances derived from live or fresh food, such as insects, small

vertebrates and berries, and also that fresh air and sun is indispensable.
Flesh, the proper food, is essential, and is well shown by the fact that
we found wild Cissas which had faded to blue and white more or less
completely on the Kontoum Plateau in South Annam, a dry and burnt
district which had been suffering from severe drought and fire for
many months and where live food was very scarce.
The Yellow-breasted Cissa is a rare bird in skin collections, and until
I obtained it only three others, so far as I am aware, have been obtained
since itsdiscovery. It inhabits the thick jungle and forest of Cochin-China
and South Annam, moving about in small flocks and mixing with
Drongos,Babblers, Woodpeckers,etc. They are very noisy, shy, and very
difficult to secure.
For the past few years some had been kept by Dr. M. Cognacq,
then the Governor of Cochin-China, in the Saigon Zoo, and last spring
Dr. Cognacq brought to Cleres three fine birds, which I sent to Mr. Ezra
before leaving again for the Far East. As they had been over a year in
captivity they were blue and white, but in perfect condition. They
did very well in a very large outdoor aviary, with a heated shelter,
which contained other birds of similar strength, such as Starlings.
Although they mastered them, they never molested them. Their shape
and hues, as well as their pretty and amusing attitudes, made them very
conspicuous and charming. Male and female are similar, and their total
length averages 13 inches. These Cissas are fed on insectivorous
mixture, cut-up meat, fruit, and plenty of mice, mealworms, and
insects, which they are extremely fond of and which helps to retain
their yellow and green dress. The last time I Saw them they were
moulting and the yellow and green feathers showed distinctly among
the old faded white and blue ones. They are very strong birds, and
rather noisy. They had been carrying sticks about all the summer,
but never attempted to make a proper nest.
The three above mentioned Yellow-breasted Cissas are the first and
only ones ever imported alive into Europe, or, in fact, to leave their
native country.
Mr. Alfred Ezra adds the following notes :--
Mr. Delacour has already given a description of this beautiful bird,.

so I need say no more about its appearance. The three birds he gave me
last year have done splendidly in a large aviary, and I consider them
very hardy birds. They have been fed principally on insectile mixture,
with some meat and fruit, and mice when obtainable. Last October
I was delighted to see that the birds had moulted out in their natural
colours, and instead of being pale blue and white were grass green and
lemon yellow. This colour they retained right through this summer,
only getting much paler by the end of August, when they started to
moult again. From the few feathers they have grown so far it looks
as if they will be green and yellow again. The coloured plate gives a
good impression of the bird, both in its natural colours and in the
blue and white State. The whole of last winter the three birds were
kept in an aviary together. Last April, in order to give them a chance
of nesting, I tried to sex them, and to take the odd bird out of the aviary.
As all the three birds looked alike, this was no easy matter. After
watching them carefully for some days, I discovered that two of them
seemed rather friendly, so I caught up the third and put him in another
aviary. I also emptied out the aviary of all the other birds, and the
pair of Cissas had the whole aviary to themselves. The next day I
found the pair fighting viciously, and thinking that I had made a
mistake and put two cocks in together, I decided to separate them,
but put off doing this till the evening. To my surprise in the evening
I found them building in a basket I put up for them inside the
sheltered aviary. They worked very hard at it, and the nest was soon
finished. The outside was rather rough, but the inside was nicely lined
with dry grass and feathers. On the 16th April I found one of the birds
visiting the nest, and on the following day there was one egg in the nest.
On the 18th I found the hen bird on the floor of the aviary, egg-bound
and very ill. After treatment in a warm room, she recovered, but did
not visit the nest. As it was the first known egg of this bird, I removed
it and sent it to Lord Kothschild for his collection. Again, on the 28th,
I found the Cissa on the nest, and on looking into it I found her sitting
on two eggs. Only the hen bird incubated, but the cock sat on the side
of the nest, and attacked any of us if we entered the aviary. He was
quite fearless, and flew at our heads with open beak, making an awful
noise all the time. The hen bird sat till the 24th of May, when I took

the eggs away and, on examination, found them both clear. The
Cissa was seen on the nest again on the 2nd June, and on the next day
I found one egg in the nest. On the 4th I again picked up the hen egg-
bound, but she recovered after treatment. On the 5th she was on the
nest again, sitting on two eggs. I found two broken eggs on the floor,
so it looks as if these birds lay at least four eggs in a clutch. On the
16th they deserted the nest and again I found the two eggs clear.
They again went to nest, and I found the hen sitting on two eggs on
2nd July. These two eggs were also clear. After all her efforts I found
the hen bird in heavy moult and in very poor condition on my return
from abroad. I fed her up, but she suddenly died on the 20th September.
The size of the egg is more or less the size of that of a Blackbird, which
it resembles closely. A dull white with minute olive-brown spots,
specially heavily spotted at the larger end. Needless to say, it was a
great disappointment to me not to have succeeded in breeding this
lovely and interesting bird. I have put the two remaining Cissas together
in the same aviary, so far without quarrelling, but I am afraid they are
both cocks.

ROCK PEPLARS AT LIBERTY

<bodyText confidence="0.976401666666667" page_id="56773497"  page_num="316" year="" vol="">
By Lady Grey of Fallodon
Perhaps our members may be interested to hear of the young Rock
Peplars, an account of the rearing by hand of which was published in
the September issue.
All three prospered, and were strong on the wing, delightfully tame
and intelligent. One, when fully grown, succumbed to pneumonia,
but the other two continued to thrive. They live in one partition of
the aviary here at Fallodon, 22 by 25 feet in size, which they share
with a pair of Kentucky Cardinals, a Rock Thrush, three Amazon
Parrots, and one Grey African Parrot. Every morning the Peplars
are set at liberty, and they remain out till 2 or 3 o'clock in the after-
noon. These hand-reared birds fly to us readily for food and com-
panionship, and are easily taken in to their Safe quarters when we want
to put them back in security from the Brown Owls. They go at once
to the feeding trays, and eat with the zest their hours of flight have

given them. When first they are released their exuberance in flight
is exhilarating to watch : a marvel of speed, power, and grace. They
sweep past and over, it is difficult to keep them in sight. They go
threading through the green spaces of the trees, keeping in touch with
each other by their call-note, and when lost to sight this little yelping
note is audible quite far away over the Park, and then again
suddenly far to the left over the kitchen garden and drive, such is their
swiftness. It puts one greatly out of conceit with cages, and I feel more
convinced than ever that people might trust their birds with greater
liberty than is customary because the territory instinct is so strong ;
of course, always pre-supposing the point of contact with food and
drink is once established and the cage or aviary, as the case may be,
is familiar to the birds and easily accessible.
Our Amazon Parrots have their freedom in this way, and are
extremely intelligent about it. When the Rock Peplars alight on us
after one of their circling flights, they look hastily to right and left,
their eyes appearing not to focus on near objects at all ; but a raisin
or a monkey-nut soon catches their attention, and they feed from our
lips or hands till, like a flash, they are off again. They eat hawthorn-
berries and lime twigs and buds, and the daisies on the lawn and
seeding grasses; and such is their love of water that when quite wet with
rain they take an even more exuberant bath than usual.

BIRDS AT THE PRIMLEY ZOO, 1927

<bodyText confidence="0.9909022" page_id="56773498"  page_num="317" year="" vol="">
By Dr. E. Hopkinson, C.M.G., D.S.O.
The opening to the public of Mr. Whitley's marvellous Zoological
collection at Paignton has been a notable event of the year, not only
for South Devon, but for all interested. The " Zoo " is already attract-
ing many visitors and will continue to do so from far and wide, for
not only can nearly everything an ordinary Zoo contains be seen there,
but all sorts of rarer or more UnUsUal beasts abound--reptiles, tropical
fish of many colours and kinds, practically every race of domestic
pigeon, a lot of the rabbits, and still more fowls. Two especially attractive
beasts must have special mention, " Devonshire Mary ''and " The Pig ",

the first an eight-year-old Chimpanzee, who has now reached a weight
of nearly 10 stone and a size and bodily development never before
attained by any ape in captivity, though she is still far from adult,
in fact still quite a child. The second's proper name is Dinomys ,
and he is perhaps the last of his race, a large guinea-pig-like animal
from Peru, where his forbears were contemporaries of the Incas, or,
from his antediluvian looks, it might be of Noah.
However it is of the Paignton birds I intended to write, so will get
on to them and give some account of the rarer and more interesting
ones I saw on a recent visit, an account based on notes taken at the
time, and help from the owner where these and memory failed me.
Thrushes, etc--One Temminck's Whistling Thrush, one (or two)
Chestnut-bellied Rock Thrushes (P. erythrogaster) , two pairs of
Dayal Birds (both nesting), one Red-footed Cuban Thrush (Mimo-
cichla rubripes), and another Mocking Thrush ( Melanotis ccerulescens)
in a cage in perfect condition, though it has for long been blind
and must have kept perfectly well and fed itself somehow in the
aviary it Used to inhabit, for it was there for some time without showing
any obvious sign of failing vision before its condition was discovered.
Black-gorgetted and White-crested Jay Thrushes, one of each,
share an aviary, while an adjoining one contains, among other birds,
a rare and most interesting Babbler, a pale brown-grey bird like a
Crateropus, allotted to another genus, Turdoides. It is believed to be
the only specimen in captivity.
Tanagers. --Last year's Tanager hybrid and its parents are still
alive ; the mother, Mr. Whitley is almost certain, is episcopus. Other
rare Tanagers are two Pirangae, not yet certainly identified ; one
probably ludoviciana, the other ? bidentala. Two Schistochlamys capis-
tratus have been in the collection for three years and were shown at
the 1925 Palace Show.
Yellow-winged Sugarbirds.-- Two pairs nesting.
Bulbuls.-- Two of the rare Himalayan Hypsipetes psaroides and
two species of Chloropsis.
Pinches. --A perfect Pyrrhuloxia which mated with a Diuca hen
had two clutches of eggs, but both were clear. A really smart example
of the yellow-marked Red Cardinal mated to a normal hen ; in this

bird the yellow markings are milch more distinct and regular than in
other specimens of this ? " sport " I have seen, and its owner is
convinced it is a true species (or sub-species), not a freak.
Several of last year's young Rose-breasted Grosbeaks occupy
various abodes about the place, and young have been again reared
this year.
Blue Grosbeaks.-- One pair of the North American Guiraca,
so rarely seen nowadays, two pairs of Cyanocompsa cyanea , a male
which is almost certainly parellina, and another much larger bird
with a very big beak, at present Unidentified and not agreeing,
apparently, with any of the described species. One Black-throated
Cardinal. Three American Buntings of three species, two with
Lark markings (one perhaps a Field Sparrow), while the third has
turned out to be a male Spizella atrigularis, a small unpretending little
bird, grey with a longish tail and blackish mask, rather suggesting in
shape a Bearded Tit. Has this bird been imported before ? Several
Jacarini Finches. Some Cape x House Sparrow hybrids, bred
this year.
Weavers. --A Urobrachya cock paired with a hen Yellow-backed
Whydah, one Mahali Weaver, a cock and two hen Melanopteryx,
two pairs Dinemellia, and six Buffalo Weavers out of seven brought
from Gambia last year ; they look like two cocks and four hens. These
Weavers usually do not live long in captivity, though one has lived for
a good many years at the Zoo (the exception which proves the rule),
and the survival of six out of seven indicates a triumph of manage-
ment, as indeed does the condition of all the birds.
One of the new Estrilda xanthophrys. Scl. still survives. These birds
came from Duidua in Abyssinia ; the importer gave Mr. Whitley this
information and is sure of the facts, for on this trip he lost some of his
birds at Marseilles, among them other specimens of this Waxbill, which
accounts for the French examples from which the species was originally
described last year. A pair of Vinaceous Waxbills from Gambia
have nested and laid several times this year, but not reared ; the cock
was not very fit and had a bald head, but is now in good health, and
as the pair is nesting again, there is hope of success.

lands at the Palace Show, February, 1927, is now at Paignton ; it is
believed to have been bred in Australia.
Troupials. --An example of the extremely rare Cassidix oryzivora.
Starlings. --Two Galeopsar Salvadorii. Last year's Burchell's
X Red-winged Starling ( Galeopsar x Amydrus) still alive, but the
father is dead. One Malabar x Pagoda Myna bred this year, and
the parents nesting again. The Glossy Starling Mr. Whitley has
bred regularly is now considered to be nitens, not sycohius.
Orioles. --Three Maroon Orioles, which I saw in 1926 just after
arrival almost flightless and very untidy, now in good condition and
flying in one of the aviaries ; they eat a good deal of milk.
Birds of Paradise. --A pair of Twelve-wired arrived during
my stay, which were kept, but a male Red Bird was returned.
Crows, etc.-- Australian and Indian Crows, one Senegal Pie
( Cryptorhina ), one Cissa, several Occipital Pies, one Diademed
and one Sumichrast's Jay. A Crow Shrike ? fuliginosa (not versi-
color). One Rufous-backed Shrike ( erythronoius ) from India, one
of the small Blue Flycatchers ( Cyornis ), one pair Phainopepla
nitens, and one Townsend's Solitaire.
Motmots. --Two, apparently belong to two species.
Rollers are quite a marvellous feature. A pair of caudatus nesting ;
five eggs laid, four hatched, one died next day. I saw three about a
fortnight old, but Mr. Whitley wrote that one died soon after, and
that he did not think he would rear the others as they were weak and
had undershot beaks, which he attributes to the cock's poor condition
from persecution by his mate earlier in the season. Fighting among
themselves seems the great difficulty with Rollers, though they are
Usually harmless to other birds. The four old Burmese Rollers
(atfinis) which came in 1923, are still alive, including the half-beaked
hen ; she laid and sat again this season, but " incubation was terminated
by a family squabble, in which the hen got the worst of it ".
One indicus an odd caudatus, and a pair of ncevius complete the
Roller list ; the last were sitting, but on clear eggs.
Colies. --Two pairs (probably erythromelon = indicus).
Turacos, Senegal and Donaldson's. Examples of both Gallirex
chlorochlamys and porphyreolophus, which Mr. Whitley thinks are the

same ; at any rate pinkish feathers were showing on the neck of the
first when exhibited at the 1927 Palace Show and are still there.
A single Greater Ani Crotophaga ani, one of the various unique
cage-birds of the collection.
Barbets.--- Two Cyanops caniceps occupy neighbouring cages and
are always ready for a mutual scrap, if allowed.
Parrots.--Whitley's Conure paired up with a Patagonian.
One pair Petz's Conure. A pair of Black-headed have young in
the nest.
One pair Hyacinthine Macaws, wdiich take great interest in and
greatly interest visitors, one pair Lear's, one pair Red and Green
(chloropterus) , one each of the Blue and Yellow, the Red and Blue
( i macao ), and Illiger's, a pair of Severe, and a pair of Snx's.
More than a dozen species of Amazon, the rarest, Mr. Whitley
considers, being the little xanthops, but one of the most interesting is
certainly a red-backed Amazon midway between festiva and hodini ;
it has no blue cheeks and no black scallop-edges to the nape feathers,
and is exactly depicted in one of the two plates Reichenow gives of
hodini , explaining that the first was incorrectly coloured. Whether
this was so or not, there are now three red-backed birds to be seen
at Paignton, each equally distinct from the other, and exactly represent-
ing the three plates in Reichenow.
Three or four species of Pionus, including the yellow-billed maxi-
miliani.
Pceocephalus. --One very tame fuscicollis, two years old, with the
fiery-red anklets and shoulders of the adult but with the pinker red
of the head, which had disappeared and which I always thought a
sign of babyhood, increasing again from the forehead backwards.
Jardine's and Aubry's, one of each ; two hen rufiventris, one of
which mated with a Senegal had fertile eggs ; one fuscicapillus
also mated with a Senegal ; four flavifrons I; the yellow on the head
of these birds is very variable, and changes with age.
Mr. Whitley pointed out that all the Poeocephali have racket-tails
with short but distinct shaft-filaments when the feathers are new.
A Grey Parrot shows the same to a less extent.
Two Dasyptilus pesqueti arrived from Mr. Goodfellow ; one has

only a suspicion of the red ear-mark. The red so much suggested
turacin that we tested it with alkali, but it was not soluble.
Yazas.-- vasa and nigra.
One Hawk-headed Parrot.
Lovebirds. -- -Rosy-faced breeding freely for the last three years ;
second generation. Black-cheeked and Nyasa, both breeding, as
well as hybrids, which come true to type--intermediate between the
two parents. Some of them were shown at the Palace in February,
1927. Several Masked Lovebirds.
One Psittinus inoertus, several Eclectus and Tanygnathus, including
three T . everetti, one Alexandra Parrakeet, a hen, for whom a mate
has been long sought in vain.
Most of the Broadtails, mostly paired for hybrids ; Barnard's X
Yellow-naped have been bred, Mealy x Barnard's and Mealy x
Rosella, the last two being new successes. Yellow-bellied X
Rosella hatched but did not rear.
Budgerigars. --Blues breed freely and produce fine birds. Blues
always breed true ; one very interesting brood reared was five young,
of which two were Cobalt, one Sky-blue, and two Green from a Cobalt
cock and a Blue-bred Green hen, whose parents were Sky-blue X Green
A lovely pair of Swift Parrakeets.
Cockatoos. --A Great Black Cockatoo, a recent arrival and
I suppose the only one imported in recent years. 1 Two other Black
Cockatoos, one stellatus , the other (with pale yellowish ears) funereus
or baudini , if the latter probably the first to be imported to England.
Twelve species of Cacatua, that is all but, hcematuropygia, ophthalmica ,
and sanguinea. A pair of Licmetis.
Lories. --A pair of Red Lories, one Black-capped Lory ; eight
Varied Lorikeets ( versicolor ), one Massena. Red-collared breed-
ing ; two reared, the second generation, this year. One hybrid
Forsten's X Red-collared bred this year on the wing, and another
in the nest.
Hornbills. --A pair of magnificent Abyssinian Ground Horn-
bills and a single S. African ( cafer ).
Pigeons. --A newly arrived (and probably new) pair of Fruit

Three Turtledoves need identification; two have the neck-rings
half black, half white.
Last year's young Roulrouls, the first success, are still alive, but the
mother has unfortunately died. Another success with a gamebird,
is eleven young reared from a pair of the rare and only recently imported
Arabian Redleg Partridge (Alectoris melanocephala ).
Two Rails from South America (probably L. sanguinolentus) bred
this year, and the two young were fully reared and the parents had laid
again and hatched by the middle of August. Both the nests were
high Up, the first on the top of a big bush close to the wire covering the
aviary, a most Un-Rail-like nest and site.
I may conclude with a reference to another extraordinary nest,
which I forgot to mention in the proper place ; this is the Grey
Struthidea's, a large structure of mud with a vertical column placed
on a Strong crossbeam. The two birds have been making this sort of
nest for two seasons, but never produced eggs, so are probably of the
same sex. A third bird has recently been obtained which next year
will be given a chance. At present it is in the adjoining aviary and
taking an intelligent interest in all that it's neighbours do.

I procured my pair of Blue Tanagers ( Tanagra cana) from
Mr. Chapman in January, 1926. After a month or so, when their
plumage was in condition, I let them into my outdoor aviary, where
they have been ever since. I note this to show the hardiness of the
birds. All last winter they roosted in their usual corner in the open
shelter. On 16th March this year I noticed them building in a box
with half-open front in the shelter. Soon after they ceased owing to
bad weather, but resumed operations on 6th April. They then went
ahead and built a complete nest of dried grass, wood shavings (used for
packing), a few feathers, and a little cow-hair. So the nest remained for
several weeks carefully guarded by the pair but egg-less. About the

beginning of June they forsook it and began building in the next box.
This time I thought it advisable to give a little assistance, and put a
rush cup-nest in the box. They apparently appreciated the attention,
completed their nest, and adorned the entrance with a substantial
tuft of wood-shavings. By 15th June I felt certain the hen was laying.
On 16th June I took a peep ; there was one egg. I dared not stay to
measure it, but it appeared to be  |in. long, not very pointed at either
end, dull white, marked pretty evenly with purplish-brown spots and
splotches. Whether my visit was the cause or no, that was the only
egg laid. I dared not look again for some time, but I judge the period
of incubation to have been about fourteen days. At any rate, by
28th June the parents were clearly feeding young. About ten days
later I took another peep, and saw the young bird covered in blackish
down. It left the nest on 19th July, and received its first lessons in
flying, to the amusement of the other inmates of the aviary. In
appearance it was duller and, of course, much smaller than the parents.
They fed it assiduously for some weeks on mealworms, banana, lettuce,
soft-bill mixture, and, when I could get them, fresh ants' eggs. It is
now a strong lusty youngster, well able to take care of itself, but still
following the parents more or less and roosting near them in the old
corner. The wing feathers are now growing brighter with something of
the glorious blue sheen of the old birds.
Two further facts I should like to mention. My Blue Tanagers
were the shyest birds in an aviary which contains some forty birds of
various kinds. In this company they successfully nested. Further,
I made friends with them over the process. When they were feeding the
young bird they came to my call for a mealworm, and still come. The
other thing is this. They were assisted in the feeding business by an
odd cock Crowned Tanager, who dodged up to the nest with rations
whenever the parents' backs were turned. Often he was caught by them
in the middle of his unsolicited attentions and ruthlessly driven from
the scene.
May I mention also that my Brown-shouldered Meadow Starlings
have had two nests, and in the second instance reared a youngster
till it was half-fledged.

By E. Maud Knobel
Having spent a most delightful week-end with Miss Chawner
at Thatched Holme, Wargrave, and seen Mr. Spedan Lewis's wonderful
collection of Owls, of which Miss Chawner is curator, I think perhaps
a note in the Magazine will be of interest to some of our readers.
The aviaries are built on three sides of a quadrangle, the quadrangle
being large enough to contain a full-sized tennis court, and a fairly
large greenhouse for Alpine plants. There is room in the house for the
more delicate species. I do not suppose in any other part of the world
is such a unique and splendid collection of Owls--there were at the time
of my visit 113 individuals, comprising thirty-three different species.
There seemed every kind of Owl, certainly " more than dreamt of in
my philosophy", but, then, I do not know much about Owls. There
were great big fellows and tiny little pigmies that would go into the
palm of one's hand, and they came from every clime--from the tropics
to the Arctic zone. I have always been under the impression that Owls
could only see in the dark and therefore only came out at night; that
during the day they either lived in a hole in a tree or in the eaves or
rafters of a barn, where they slept quietly until it was dark enough for
them to venture out. Great, therefore, was my surprise to see these
Owls not only enjoying daylight, but sitting in the full glare of the sun,
many of them enjoying a real sun bath with wings outspread and
lying down on the warm stump of a tree to get the full benefit of the
warmth, also being able to see and take an interest in all that went on
around them. Another surprise to me was to find them such tremendous
bathers, splashing about in huge pans of water and getting thoroughly
wet through.
Out of such a collection it is only possible to mention one or two.
The biggest was the Eagle Owl, erroneously, I think, called " the
Turk ", for a tamer bird it would be hard to find. He followed
Miss Chawner about like a dog, and it was quite di#icult to get out of
his aviary without his coming also. His plumage was tawny and black,

white under the chin, and he had long ears and huge feet and talons
well feathered up to the toes. His eyes were of that wonderful deep
orange that belongs to some of the Owl tribe. Unfortunately he had a
badly dropped wing, but in spite of this handicap was learning to fly
from perch to perch.
The most beautiful to my mind, and also one of the rarest in the
collection was the little Hawk Owl from circum-polar regions. A really
exquisite little creature, with a coat of light and dark grey both spotted
and barred, the barring being specially noticeable across the breast.
It was about the size of a Pigeon, and more like a Hawk than an Owl.
It is really a day bird, and has pale yellow eyes. Another charming
Arctic Owl and also a rarity was Tengmalm's, very similar in colouring
to the Hawk Owl, but considerably smaller. There were two of these,
but unfortunately they would not agree together, probably on account
of sex. Perhaps the tamest in the collection was a White-eared Scops,
which just loved to be petted and made a fuss of--a very unusual thing
in birds of this group. But what fascinated me most were the Ural
Owls from the Mark of Finland. There were six of these, all young birds
of the year. Two were very tame, one specially so, coming to
Miss Chawner and playing with her gloved hand like a kitten. This
rejoiced in the name of " Black-eyed Susan ". The other was a more
daring bird and, having taken Miss Chawner's hat off her head and
carried it up to a rafter, had earned for himself the name of " Terrible
James They were delightful birds, and I was immensely pleased when
they eventually came on to my hand and allowed me to play with them.
Their colouring is composed of shades of dark grey with dark brown
bars, and their faces are like a baby's with a granny's hood round;
they have most beautiful dark blue-brown eyes, and the feathers of
the face are so fine that they are more like hairs than feathers.
It is quite impossible to describe in a short space all I saw. I can
only hope that perhaps some day other members of the Society may
see and enjoy for themselves what is a most unique collection.

ON COLOUR BREEDING IN BUDGERIGARS

Our Editor has published one or two notes on the abnormal coloured
Budgerigars, in which there has been such a boom during the past year
or more. Though not posing as an authority, I have had a certain
measure of success in breeding for colour during the past few years.
I am not at all certain that this is really a subject which should be
written on or discussed in a magazine such as the Avicultural, which
is purely scientific and not a publication for " fanciers ".
I started Budgerigars with Blue-bred Greens some years ago, and
after breeding from these for a couple of years with no more encouraging
results than young Greens, I parted with the whole lot ; some eight or
nine birds going to Mrs. Chatterton. I fancy these were all hens ; from
these hens, paired to Blue-bred Green cocks, which she purchased, I
believe, from Mr. Marsden, she has, as most people know, bred Whites,.
Blues, Yellows, and, of course, Greens.
I then Started with two pairs of Blues, and from these birds, with
a very occasional fresh Blue bird for new blood, I have during the past
four or five years bred some hundreds of Blues.
I think it may safely be said that with Torquoise-blues--Blues,
always breed Blues--the exception to the rule must be extremely rare
and can be taken as negligible--the Same does not apply to Cobalts^
which I Suppose must be considered a less fixed type. I have at the
moment a Green cock both of whose parents were Cobalts. Last month
I bred a Green bird from a Torquoise-blue hen and a Cobalt cock. The
same nest contained two Blues and three Cobalts, as I have already
stated a Green chick is a very rare occurrence when both parents are
of the ordinary or turquoise-blue colour.
The following notes are not of outstanding interest, but go to prove
that although it is worth while working on definite lines, results cannot
be guaranteed, and that there is no rule-of-thumb in colour-breeding.
Having one small heated aviary in the end of my greenhouse, I
decided to start breeding early last January. Even with heat there is
a distinct risk of egg-binding if one starts too early, so I put up four
Blue-bred Green hens and paired them with four Blue cocks. I got

two nests from each pair, some thirty young birds, before the cocks
were transferred in May to their rightful Blue hens. Among all these
young there was not a single Blue--but I did get two Yellows, which
I greatly prized, and rightly so, as will be Seen later.
Having one or two extra Blue cocks, I allowed one of the adult
Green hens to continue breeding later in an outdoor aviary. In the
second nest she produced three Blues and one Green, and at the present
moment she has five young, of which two are certainly Blues. This
goes to prove that it is not wise to turn down " a pair of birds if they do
not produce what is expected and wanted on the first occasion. In
July I paired one of the young Yellows (a hen then five months old)
to a Blue cock. I hoped to get a white, but the result was two Blues
and a Green.
I then gave her another Blue cock, and she has now two Whites and
a Blue, which is exactly what I expected and wanted. I think that it is
unwise to introduce the ordinary Lutino or Yellow Budgerigar into
one's strain--but if a Yellow is produced from Blue or Blue-bred
parents, it should be carefully preserved and bred from.
I have bred from several of this year's early-bred birds, and have
got some good youngsters from these young parents, but I must also
admit that some of the offspring have shown signs of " French moult "--
in varying degrees--whereas I have not had a single case among some
hundred birds bred from adults this year.
A few more statements of facts may also be of interest, if they only
give rise to opposition or discussion. There is little doubt, I think, that
even given the requisite abnormally bred or abnormally coloured
parents, it is more difficult to obtain young from these than it is from
common Greens. As proof thereof, when I was breeding from the Green
hens in my heated aviary in January, I also put in a Blue hen paired
to a Cobalt cock, the former died with her second egg. A Green Blue-
bred hen paired to a very fine White cock gave me clear eggs, as did
also a Cobalt hen paired to the Green cock previously referred to, who
was the offspring of two Cobalt parents. Some of these birds retrieved
their reputation later in the season ; the Cobalt cock has fathered three
nests and, paired to a Blue hen, has produced eight Cobalts, ten Blues,
and one Green.

One of the Green hens which produced two nests of Greens
in January to March has since then given me 50 per cent of Blues
paired to the same Blue cock. A young White hen, which came to me
in exchange for the White cock previously mentioned, laid a clutch of
minute eggs from which she reared ,two Blues, one of which was
featherless--her mate was a Blue ; she is now sitting on her last clutch
of four for this season, of which the eggs are quite normal in size.
November 10. These four eggs were put under a common green
hen who hatched and brought off four vigorous young blues.
In the absence of a white cock I should, I think, have done better
had I paired this white hen to a blue -bred yellow cock.
Since writing the above I have had quite a number of ill-feathered
youngsters in the third nests from my adult pairs and lam writing a
few notes on this so-called French moult which the Editor has kindly
consented to publish.

BIRD-CATCHING IN SENEGAL

Dakar, the chief port of Senegal, is the headquarters of the export
trade in the small ornamental Finches commonly called " Senegalis
These include the Waxbills, Firefinches, Cordon-bleus, and Lavender
Finches, and besides these a good many larger seed-eating birds are
also caught and exported--Weavers, Whydahs, Combassous, Singing
Finches, etc. These, or selections of these (according to season), form
the usual contents of the catchers' cages, though odd rarer birds may
occasionally be found there, but not very often, for these comparatively
rare ones are those which are not found as a rule in flocks and therefore
not to be caught wholesale, and the African, preferring quantity to
quality, wants a good return for every pull of his net. Such rarer birds
include Aurora Finches, Spotted and Yinaceous Firefinches, and
Magpie Mannikins, the last once very common, but now, for some
reason, only infrequently seen either wild or in the cages. Nowadays,
too, one may towards the end of the rains see cages full of the Yellow
Weavers ( Hyphantornis , etc.), mostly cocks in colour.
A bird-catching party consists of two or three men, each with a

cage and two or three nets like our clap-nets, but very much smaller
(about 8 by 2 feet), and used singly. The cage is an ordinary
packing-case, about 3 by 2 by 2 feet, with a wire netting front,
a sliding door in the top, and a wooden water-trough which slides in
from the front along one side of the cage and runs its whole depth.
Perches parallel with the front, a great number--often forty, in lines
occupying the upper three-quarters of the cage, and many, therefore,
one above another--complete the equipment ; they are fixed in holes
drilled in the ends of the cage, and are cut longer than the cage to
facilitate their withdrawal when it is wished to catch up the birds.
There is no drawboard, and therefore no means of cleaning the cage
while inhabited, but this does not matter much in the dry climate of
Senegal (i.e. in the dry season), and the big door in the top allows a
good scraping every time the stock is sold which, if things go well,
should be about once a month. The whole lot with the nets, a seed-
grinding mill and perhaps a cooking pot, forms a cumbersome but not
too heavy head-load.
In recent years great changes have, of course, occurred everywhere
and in everything--bird-catching even has been affected, and here,
as in many other things and places, the change has not been for the
better.
I am speaking of the Gambia, where for more than twenty-five years
I have lived (with yearly, or nearly yearly, leaves home), and where
I have Seen the catching of, and often also caught and brought home,
these birds. The Gambia Colony and its Protectorate is the River
Gambia and a narrow strip on each bank, running for about 300 miles,
right into Senegal and providing easy means of transport into the
interior, for ocean-going steamers go up for nearly 200 miles and the
local " cutters " and launches as far as our eastern boundary. Gambia,
and the adjacent French territory to the north used to be the favourite
hunting ground, owing to its nearness to markets, but nowadays
Gambia is less frequented and the catchers work along the new French
railway which runs much further east than does our Gambia.
Twenty years ago and earlier the catchers came from some Sort of
clan of their own, and the " profession " was obviously a closed one;
they were generally Senegal Fulas, of low caste apparently, for they

were certainly looked down on by everyone else, but they could catch
birds, and, what is more important, could keep them alive and in good
condition after catching.
A party would start operations from home and, moving about
every three or four days, travel slowly along till their cages were
full (400 birds was the object), and they had reached the place where
they could sell their catch. This was either Bathurst, one of our up-river
trading places, where they sold direct to certain captains of steamers
which came there to load ground-nuts, or at one of the French nut-
buying centres along the Dakar railway line, then only reaching about
100 miles from the coast. New hands I suppose had to find good places
for catching, but all the catchers I knew had learnt this from previous
visits ; they set the nets and began catching the first day, simply
putting them down early in the morning, baiting with a little seed and
plenty of millet-husks from the pounding-places, leaving them
untouched till the afternoon and then getting a catch. Sometimes they
would set at a drinking place, but this was mainly for Weavers, and at
the end of the Season proper or when they wanted Pigeons, etc. They
did not consider the results good enough to justify the spoiling of the
nets by the water, and therefore dry sites were the rule, clearings in the
tall grass either in or near the millet-fields or on the dry swamps,
Orange-cheek and Zebra, Waxbills being the commonest bag in the last.
Three pulls a day was the rule, four exceptionally, as during the hot
mid-day hours there is nothing doing in the bird-catching line. One
does not wonder therefore that they like as many birds as possible
per pull and take but little interest in birds which can only be caught
" one-one Soft-bill birds (except for an occasional individual who
went for Glossy Starlings) they never troubled about, and any mis-
guided bird except a seed-eater who got into the nets went into the pot,
even the over-bold Hawks, which So often spoil (experto crede) a
good chance.
As they travelled along the catchers lived in the small villages of
their friends and fellow-tribesmen along their road, and avoided the
bigger places, where they got plenty of abuse but little chance of food
for themselves or their birds. Among their friends they were able to
beg the seed for the birds and their own meals, or barter for it any

E. Hopkinson -- Bird-catching in Senegal
Doves or Sand-grouse they had caught, and every self-respecting
catcher had one old net which he set at a water hole simply for this
purpose. They fed their birds on millet ground-up in an ordinary
coffee-mill with the addition of " findo ", a small grass-like cereal,
whenever they could get it. Our millet in its ordinary state is too hard
for Waxbills and the like, though Weavers, etc., husk it easily, but even
these do better if given it ground. This grinding was done twice a day :
at daybreak and again after mid-day before the men started on the
evening round of the nets. The water troughs were filled at the same
time. The birds, therefore, had plenty of quiet time in which to feed,
the essential thing with fresh-caught birds. In Spite of the primitive
cages and the constant travelling, the birds did well in capable hands,
and I learnt a lot of useful tips about the business from these people.
My experience is that with proper food and average care the mortality
is very low, ridiculously low compared with what used to be the case
with English birds ; two per cent I should think was about the
average mortality while in the catcher's cages, Say for about a month.
What was the rate among fresh-caught Goldfinches at home ? Fifty ?
Such was the case under favourable circumstances, and I have often
got lots of birds all the way to England with the same success, my best
effort being with three dead out of 400 odd from day of catching in
Africa to arrival in England two months (at least) later. That is not
likely to be repeated, but I have often got other smaller lots home with
almost as good results, and, of course, there have been times when
things have not gone well and the death rate been really too high, but
then, thanks to 'flu, etc., we at times suffer from that sort of thing
ourselves. Why this is so I have never been able to discover. All my
birds have always come in July, at the best season, and to all
appearances everything, weather, shipment, length of journey, etc.,
has been the same in every case, good or bad. Our old catchers' birds
did just as well, if they got into the hands of exporters who also
understood them.
Nowadays all is altered. Up to about the war things were as
described, but now, owing, I suppose, to the greater demand for birds
and their decrease in the more accessible districts, things have been
speeded up, have " advanced " (Progress with a big P), and Ford cars,

railways and other results of Progress and advancing civilization have
opened up wider circles of possible catching and much shortened the
time between catching and export, so that the birds, as some one
recently put it, get to Europe " before they have time to die This
may be so or not, but they are now hustled along so quickly and have
no breaking-in to cage-life before shipment, that I should have
expected the dying rate would exceed the journey speed. In any case,
there is no doubt that these birds do not as a rule arrive in the condition
they used to.
The bird-catchers themselves have changed, and I believe also the
bird-buyers at the ports. Of the first, instead of the " select " few of the
old days, who caught only in the dry season, January to May, and
spent the rains at their proper job, that is on their farms, we now may
find any scallywag who is out of work, or thinks he has found a soft
job, trying his hand and at all seasons. A dozen or so will get to work
and set their nets anywhere where they see birds, even close to the
towns where Firefinches, formerly sacrosanct as guests of the town,
Cordon-bleus, and Combassous can easily be caught. In about a week
their cages are full ; they are then bundled on to a lorry and hustled
to the selling place with all speed. None of the old leisurely progress
giving plenty of time for the captives to feed and get accustomed to
cage-life; haste and quick delivery instead. Most of the present-day
catchers, too, know nothing about the birds and their care, and for their
food simply throw in millet uncrushed and expect that to do for all--
to do well enough at any rate to keep the birds alive till they can be
got rid of to the big buyer. It does not do, and hence more deaths.
Besides, catching now goes on at all seasons, for now that big liners
from South America put into Dakar, the dealers there have found that
they can sell at big prices cages of bright-coloured birds to the
passengers, and one sees there cages of Weavers ( Pyromelana , Quelea,
and Hyphantornis), Whydahs (Pintail and Paradise), Cordons, and
Firefinches, all in full colour, from about August to November. These,
of course, are caught during the rains, the period of full colour, and at
the best are unlikely to live, for at that time they live so largely on insect
food and soft unripe seeds. The change to hard seed, especially
uncrushed as supplied to the purchasers, is impossible, and in addition

most arrive in our cold weather, so that total loss of a whole cage-full
is almost the rule. Bird-catching in West Africa is foolish after May
unless you have a foolish buyer on your doorstep, and even then is
wicked. During the dry season, January to May, I can see no more harm
in it than in catching at home, or as a matter of fact than in shooting,
hunting, etc., or even eating butchers' meat.
The names used by the catchers are of some interest, for most are
sort of slang words, more or less French, more or less Joloff or Fula.

going on here since the end of the eighteenth century, at any rate ;

BREEDING THE HERMIT THRUSH
</sectionHeader>
<reference confidence="0.9375545">
By Maurice Amsler, M.B., B.S., F.Z.S.
On the occasion of my last visit to our late and much lamented
President, Mr. Hubert Astley, we were talking about his pair of Hermit
Thrushes (Hylocichla guttata ), which I believe he obtained through the
New York Zoo. He then said that if the cock did not shortly begin to
sing he would let me have them to try my hand at breeding them.

To the great sorrow of every aviculturist, Mr. Astley died within a
month, and through the generosity of Mrs. Astley the birds came into
my possession in May, 1925. The hen was not in perfect plumage on
arrival, but improved after being in an outdoor aviary for a few weeks.
The cock, though in good condition, never uttered, a note ; a few straws
were carried during the summer, but no serious attempt at nesting
was made.
Not knowing how hardy these birds might be, I caged them up in
the autumn, and a few weeks later the cock, who had for some time
exhibited a queer quivering movement in one leg, died in convulsions.
My chagrin at this was very great, both because of the bird's origin
and also because I did not think it likely that I could ever replace him.
Much to my surprise and delight, I received a letter from Chapman
in March, 1926, offering me another cock of this species. I, of course,
took the bird, which proved, indeed, to be a male. The sexes are
absolutely identical and, as they fight like Gamecocks, whether they be
pairs or like sexes, during three-quarters of the year, I was only able
to determine the sex of this last bird when he began to sing a few weeks
later.
I discovered subsequently that this cock came from Captain Stokes,
and that it was through him that Chapman knew I was wanting a
male of this species.
The two birds were turned out in April, 1926, and were inclined to
quarrel, but not seriously. Towards the end of the month the cock
began to sing, and continued this throughout the summer months.
In May the hen carried a few fibres, but did not build properly, and the
two birds may be said to have led entirely detached existences. There
was none of the devotion seen in true Thrushes during the breeding
season, when the cock collects and gives every dainty he can find to
the hen.
Thus, another breeding season passed with nothing achieved beyond
a great deal of singing of a somewhat monotonous quality.
The following autumn and winter were spent in the same aviary,
which has a good shelter but no heat.
In the early spring of this year there was some bickering between
the two birds, which by degrees became so serious that I had to put

the cock into an adjoining aviary whence he could see his wife but
could not molest her.
During the middle of March I replaced him with the hen, and a state
of armed neutrality was established and maintained. The male began
his little song in April, and this was continued from dawn till dark
throughout May, June, and July, until the hen began to sit, when he
became completely silent.
On 13th July my man informed me that the hen Hermit Thrush
had built and laid one egg. I did not look into the nest, which was
placed high up in a small open box about 4 inches square, but I was not
at all happy to see her carrying fine grass and coconut fibre after she
had begun to lay. This was something abnormal and irregular, and
boded ill for the future. On the following day I looked into the nest and
found a very neat structure, cup-shaped, and lined with very fine
grasses and fibres. It contained one small egg, which I just glanced at
and did not touch. For a couple of days building went on, and then the
hen spent most of the day on the nest. I took the opportunity of her
being off to look into the nest again. I found one beautiful elongated
" Starling-blue " unspotted egg, and the other which I had previously
seen. The latter I removed and examined. The hen's behaviour was
then explained. She had taken possession of and relined the nest of a
Siberian Bullfinch, which had built and laid one egg without my
knowledge.
Another egg was laid on the following day, and this completed the
clutch.
During the time of laying and the early part of incubation was the
only time when an onlooker would have suspected any association
between the male and female. The former was usually dancing
attendance on his spouse, and was frequently seen to give her gentle
but friendly pecks, quite unlike his behaviour in the early part of the
year. Incubation began in earnest on 17th July, and lasted until the
29th. During these twelve days the hen was only seen off the nest for
a few minutes on two or three occasions, and as far as I know was
never relieved or fed by the male.
There was nothing distinctive about the two squabs during their
early days. The first two days they were constantly brooded by the

hen, after which both parents took their share in the duties of
feeding.
During the first few days ants' eggs only were used, and meal-
worms entirely disregarded, I suppose, on account of their size. At the
age of six days, mealworms, a few small earthworms, and quantities of
well-scoured gentles were used, and all seemed to be going well from
what one could see from below, but on 7th August I found one of the
chicks in a fairly " high " state of decomposition, on the ground, 6 feet
from the nest. It was well feathered and looked much like a miniature
Song Thrush of about ten days of age.
My chances of rearing this species, already slender, were now halved,
and I have to thank the male parent for any success which I may have
to record, for from this day onwards the hen seemed to lose all interest
in her family, and the whole duty of feeding devolved on the male,
whose time was fully occupied in collecting live food for the remaining
chick and chasing the hen away from the much coveted contents of the
live-bait pan.
On 11th August the young Hermit Thrush had left the nest. He was
just thirteen days old, but looked as if he would have been the
better for another two or three days in the nest.
Compared with his parents, he was very dark in colour ; the back,
wings, tail, and head were a dark lead-grey instead of the bright
cinnamon-brown of the adult. The upper breast was a similar colour.
This, the crown of the head, and mantle were flecked with numerous
spots of light buff. The lower breast and abdomen were a dirty white,
with no markings of any kind.
The weather about this time was so atrocious that I expected each
day to find him drowned, but although he persisted in staying in the
outside flight, notwithstanding the fact that I often drove him into the
shelter, he seemed to have the sense to find spots on the ground where he
was more or less sheltered from the rain, and there he was constantly
fussed over and cared for by his father, who, like most parent birds,
always Seemed to know the exact whereabouts of his offspring, though
I frequently hunted around and could not find him. It is interesting
to note that the male began his little song again on the very day the
chick left the nest.

388 Mrs. G. K. Goddard--Breeding the Blue-rumped Parrotlet
On 16th August the young bird could pick up food and could fly
quite strongly, though he still spent most of his time Squatting under
bushes or other plants.
A day or two later I found the young bird in extremis , and on picking
him up discovered that he had attempted to swallow a dead bloom of
the day lily ( Hemerocallis ). This flower was about 4 inches long and the
thickness of a lead pencil, and he had very nearly gorged the whole.
I was able to extract it, and a few moments later he seemed none the
worse.
On 13th September the youngster was as large as his parents and
almost indistinguishable from them, but his general colour was still
a little darker than either of the adults and he still showed the buff
spots on the crown of his head and the upper mantle.
I believe and hope that it is the first occasion on which this species
has been bred in captivity, for I feel sure that had they not unfortunately
had to change hands, Mr. Astley, who was a past-master at breeding the
genus Turdidse, would have succeeded sooner or later in doing what
has taken me two years to achieve.

By Mrs. G. K. Goddard
About eighteen months ago I purchased from Mr. Hedges a pair
of Blue-rumped ParrotletS, Psittacula cyanopygia. These I turned into
a large outdoor flight, with some NyaSa and Black-cheeked Lovebirds.
In the centre of the flight I have a small house in which I put their food
and water, but the nest-boxes hung around the sides and at the ends of
the flight, the only protection being some felt on the outside of the wire
to keep the rain off. For months the boxes were only used by the
Nyasas and Black-cheeks, the pair of Blue-rumps roosting in the house.
One day, about the middle of August this year, I missed the little hen,
so watched closely for several days, when suddenly I saw her emerge
from one of the boxes. On looking inside I found three eggs. The nest
was made with a few pieces of dry grasses and old millet sprays, and in
the centre were many green feathers, plucked from her breast. On

chick left the nest fully fledged, and they are now strong on the wing
and flying about in the aviary, but go with their parents into the house
to sleep. Two are all green and show no blue, and I conclude these must
be hen birds, as the third chick has a blue rump and the wings show
blue underneath. The blue is a bright turquoise and very lovely (but
only visible when the bird is in flight).
I should much like to know if there is any previous record of these
birds having been bred in captivity ?

Recently so much has been written by members on the Nyasa
Lovebird that it is almost impossible to throw fresh light on the habits
of this interesting species. The excitement caused by the first arrivals,
the rapidity with which they settled down and commenced breeding
operations, and the subsequent " first " success of Captain Stokes,
are all still fresh in the memories of lovers of the Agapornes.
Mr. Seth-Smith gives a very complete account of this species in
the Avicultural Magazine, 1926, pp. 53-4.
Agapornis fischeri
Little seems to have been recorded concerning this rather sombre
coloured Lovebird, figured somewhat indifferently in the Avicultural
Magazine, July, 1926.
Until last month only one living example had ever reached England,
and that only stayed a few days before continuing its journey to
America. Now, thanks to the enterprise of our member, Mr. Chapman,
several consignments have arrived. It is to be hoped that those
members who obtain specimens will not fail to make known their
observations.
First discovered some forty years ago by Dr. G. A. Fischer, and
described by Dr. Reichenow in the J.F.O., 1887, p. 54.

Mrs. Prestwick--Lovebirds
Concerning this species, Dr. Emin Pasha, C.M.Z.S., who was
assassinated in the Upper Congo in the autumn of 1892, writes :--
" Agapornis fischeri is a noticeable bird of this country (Ussongo).
One seldom traverses the woods here without a pair or a small party
of three or four individuals being met with, which utter delicate screams,
not so piercing as those of Agapornis pullaria , as they fly high up with
a whirring noise, and in a straight course. These Parrots also frequent
the ground a good deal. In the crops of shot birds I have found fine
grass seeds, which must have been picked Up from the ground, as
there was no upstanding grass anywhere about." (J.F.O., 1891,
pp. 338-9.)
Agapornis personata
The Masked or Yellow-breasted Lovebird is undoubtedly one of
the most beautiful members of a very attractive genus. First discovered
by Dr. Fischer at Kibaya in Masailand and described by Dr. Reichenow,
in J.F.O., 1887, p. 55. Until recently extremely rare, only three
specimens having reached England, en route to America, in 1925 ; it is
now quite plentiful and is proving an excellent aviary bird. It remains
to be seen how it will stand the winter outdoors, but there is no reason
to suppose it will prove less hardy than A. nigrigenis.
The sexes would appear identical in plumage; the shape of the head,
however, is a sure guide in sexing. They are quite friendly disposed
to one another in an aviary, but some Seem very quarrelsome in a
confined space.
Mr. K. Y. Painter, of Cleveland, Ohio, was successful in breeding
from the three birds already mentioned. According to our Editor's
Parrakeets , p. 281, Mr. Painter writes that his three birds were put
in a large flying cage of which the inside part was about 14 feet
square and 10 feet high, with an outside flight of about the same size.
He had no idea of any young ones coming until they suddenly appeared
from the breeding boxes; " full grown and almost in mature plumage,
their plumage is so like that of their parents that they are hardly
distinguishable excepting that the colours are a little fainter." Con-
cerning the birds of East Africa, Mr. Loveridge ( P.Z.S. , 1922, p. 854)
writes: " Parties of this handsome little Lovebird (Agapornis
personatus) flew about with great rapidity, screaming noisily ; they

were first met with at Kongwa. They were nesting in the holes of a
baobab-tree, whose apertures they had apparently closed with a
defence of thorns. Two eggs were found at the foot of the tree, side
by side, and measured S X f in. How they came to be there I cannot
say, for they contained embryos nearly ready for hatching." Oscar
Neumann (J.F.O., 1899, pp. 63-4) writes : " I observed this brown-
headed dwarf Parrot in flocks from ten to twenty strong in the sacred
acacia groves of North Ugogo, also in Usandawes, Irangi, and at the
southern point of the Manjava Lakes. Its area of distribution appears
to be very limited."

The return of the Bittern to Norfolk is one of the most satisfactory
results of the efforts that have been made in recent years to protect our
rare birds. Some few years ago the Bittern was no more than a casual
visitor to this country on its migration. Many years before this it had
bred regularly in Norfolk, and elsewhere where conditions were suitable,
but persecution from collectors and so-called sportsmen had driven it
away, and it seemed unlikely that it would ever again return as a
breeding species. But now it has come back, thanks to the protection
that has been afforded it, and for several years past its " boom " has
been heard throughout the Broads district, and it has nested freely and
reared its young unmolested.
And it is the ardent desire of all bird-lovers that the case of the
Bittern may not be a solitary instance of a species returning to its
former haunts, and, with an increased love of birds and an abhorrence
of the insane desire to kill every rare arrival, other former breeding
Species such as the Avocet, the Ruff, the Black Tern, and the Spoonbill
may realize that here they will find a sanctuary and be our honoured
guests.
Every year these birds visit their old haunts upon their migration,
but formerly they were hunted down as soon as they appeared, and
it may take long for them to realize that an enlightened generation

in their breeding haunts now, one must follow Mr. Bentley Beetham,
who has spent many days amongst them in their haunts in Holland
and Spain, and who, in a most fascinating volume describes and
illustrates their life history.
The author writes in a vivid and charming style, and all his chapters
are delightful, but perhaps the most interesting of all is that devoted to
an account of the Spanish Marismas, vast areas of low-lying ground
at or near the estuaries of rivers that at times are swamped, except for
tiny scraps of land raising their surfaces above the water, which as
the sun increases in power, and the water evaporates, grow larger and
form ideal breeding places for many birds such as the Whiskered Tern,
the Egret, the Avocet, the Stilt, and the Pratincole.
Amongst all of these, Mr. Bentley Beetham has wandered and
waded, and his observations, so well described in his book, will give
great pleasure to all who read it.

The Island of Bute in the Firth of Clyde is about 16 miles in
length, with an average breadth of 4 miles. It is of a very irregular
shape, two-thirds being arable land and the remainder mostly under
heather. There are two large lochs, and the ground rises in parts to
over 600 feet, and parts are well wooded.
With such a variety of country a varied and numerous avifauna was
to be expected, and Mr. McWilliam is able to give accounts of no less
than 168 species as occurring on the island. The Lapwing is common
at all Seasons, and is extremely conspicuous in the fields and on the
moors in spring. The Curlew is also extremely common. The Skylark
and the Song Thrush and the Waterhen are easily found. The Gannet
is to be seen diving almost every day between April and September.
Gulls old and young are present almost everywhere at all seasons,
ki In fact," writes the author, " from the diversity of the country, there
are few places of the same size where a naturalist would be certain of
finding so many of the finer British birds as on Bute."

BEHAVIOUR OF BLUE ROBINS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965417" page_id="56773524"  page_num="343" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The following note may be of interest and help to anyone who
is the happy possessor of a pair of Blue Robins, but who has failed
to induce them to nest.
Last winter a pair of these truly delightful birds arrived here
and were most carefully tended ; in fact, they were perhaps pampered,,
so afraid was I of losing one or other before the breeding season. At
the end of March the birds were placed in a nice aviary with only a.
few Parrot Finches and some Chinese Quail as companions.
During the whole of April and May every insect was pounced on.
by the male and given to the female, who seemed to have a never-
ending appetite for such dainties ; at the same time never a straw was-
carried, though I had provided some four or five most attractive boxes,
of all types in the shelter of the aviary. I began to feel despondent,,
more especially So on 28th May, when I visited Mr. Ezra and found
that his birds were rearing their second brood. I looked around for a.
cause ; his birds were certainly not so fine a pair as mine--the aviary
was smaller, and there was less choice of nest-boxes; in fact, the one
the birds had used was hung in the open on a post--" A silly place for
the birds to choose," thought I.
On the following day, as my birds were still doing nothing, I took a
Budgerigar nesting-box and hung it on a nail which happened to b&amp;
sticking out of one of the posts forming the outer flight of the aviary,
some 6 feet from the ground. What was my amazement to see both
birds instantly dive into the box through the entrance hole. The time
was 1.15 p.m., at 2 o'clock I looked in the box and found an almost
completed nest. By 9th June the hen had laid her clutch of four eggs,
from which she reared three young. Contrary to Captain Waud, I find
these birds very easy to satisfy. Mine must have consumed several
pints of gentles when rearing their young.
The season was now too far advanced to expect a second nest, but
I am still wondering whether any attempt at nesting would ever have
been made had I not put that nest box outside.

Sir, --My Sula Island King, mated to a Crimson-wing,
hatched two young ones with her third nest ; one died when a few days
old, I think because the first brood worried her and prevented her
from feeding properly, she being too good a mother to send them
about their business. The Second left the nest on 4th October, and is a
fine bird, rather differently coloured from the three older ones, red
covering more than half the breast, while there is a tinge of the same
colour on the throat. About ten days before the young bird flew

AN INTELLIGENT CRIMSON-WING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998875" page_id="56773525"  page_num="344" year="" vol="">
Sir, --A young Crimson-wing I bred this last summer recently
gave an almost uncanny display of intelligence and adaptability.
When he could feed himself, I moved him from his mother's aviary to
that occupied at night by the liberty birds, it being my intention to
train him to fly at liberty. The liberty bird aviary is one of a row of
about twenty exactly similar aviaries, and is a hundred yards from the
Crimson-wing's habitation. The only means of exit in the morning is
through a small door about a foot square, low down in the front of the
flight, an opening not usually discovered by birds until they have
been in the aviary many days or even weeks. In the afternoon an
inward-pointing funnel of wire-netting is put in the little door to trap,
for the night, the birds which enter to feed. Only one Parrakeet, an
adult cock Crimson-wing, has ever learned to find his way out through
the end of the inward-pointing funnel, and it took him many months
to do so, and he was never able to negotiate a funnel as long as those
at present in use.
The young bird did not seem disturbed by his change of quarters,

morning I found him feeding inside the box used for birds at liberty,
which are not shut up at night. It has a dark interior, and the food is
not visible from the entrance, and only birds trained by gradual stages
ever use it. Of course, in this case he had his father's example to
follow, but even so he learned the use of the thing in an uncommonly
short time. As he had soon found his parents, and an outside Supply of
food, I concluded that he would enter the other aviary no more, but
within a couple of hours he had left the old birds and was back inside
it, and has never offered to leave it since !

THE GIN GIN BIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995224785714286" page_id="56773526"  page_num="345" year="" vol="">
Sir, --With reference to Mrs. A. A. Prestwich's inquiry about the
Gin Gin Bird, which was sold at the sale of Mr. E. H. BoStock's Scottish
Zoo in Glasgow on 27th April, 1909, at the record price of 260 guineas,
I was at the sale in question, and am able to give you the facts.
The bird was a Bauer's Parrakeet (Barnardius zonarius), not a
particularly fine specimen, but was a wonderful whistler, whistling one
or two tunes in a very Sweet mellow tone, in fact, it was the Sweetest
whistler of any bird I have ever heard.
The bird was sold to the late Mr. Frank Bostock, a brother of
Mr. E. H. Bostock, and many thought at the time that the sale of this
bird might be an advertising Stunt, but of course there could be no proof
of this.
I am afraid the name " Gin Gin " was a coined one.
And. Wilson.

Sir, --Being somewhat short of room, I recently turned a Fischer's
Lovebird that had been ill into a large aviary containing Siskins and
Buntings. Within a very few days and before its evil disposition had
been observed it had succeeded in killing one of each. This may act
as a warning to anyone who may be disposed to try this new Lovebird
in mixed company. I believe Black-cheeks and NyaSaS have the
reputation of being fairly amiable.

GEEEN INDIAN COEN AS FOOD FOE BIEDS

Sir, --It may interest some readers to hear that I have found the
green cobs of Indian corn (maize) a very useful food in my aviary
this summer, Budgerigars, Parrakeets, and Finches all seem very fond
of it and prefer it to lettuce, seeding grass, or unripe millet sprays.
The best time to use this corn is just before the grain is fully
developed, but no longer " milky
It is of course necessary to strip off the outer leaves and the silky
tassel, So that the birds can get at the grain easily.
The silky tassel when dried is an excellent material for nest linings.
This note is chiefly intended for overseas members, but I think
maize could be grown quite well in the south of England if the seeds
were Started early in the year under glass and planted out after the
danger of frost was passed.
Sweet corn, such as is grown for table use, is even more readily
eaten than the common yellow variety.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997702357142857" page_id="56773527"  page_num="346" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Having just received the Magazine for September, and read
Lord Tavistock's letter regarding the Cock Derbyan in his aviaries,
I am Sending you this note in case it may be of general interest.
The Derbyan Parrakeet reaches Shanghai under normal conditions
from Chungking in Szechuan Province, West China, and from the time
it is caught is fastened by a chain around one leg to its perch ; whilst
in transit this perch is usually a bamboo supported on a framework,
and several birds are attached to the same perch ; it is never caged.
In Shanghai the birds are sold on iron frames about fourteen inches
long, but as this perch has two moulded brass caps attached, one at
either end, the bird's movements are restricted to about ten inches
of perch, and if they are sold to the Chinese they remain fastened in
this manner for life.
The Chinese feed this bird on paddy rice, sometimes adding a little

hemp seed, and whilst agreeing with Lord Tavistock that the bird would
be hardy under the conditions in which birds are kept at home, yet it
would appear that they soon die in Chinese hands.
It has been quite impossible to obtain this species in Shanghai
or the lower Yangtze River ports this year, as no birds came down from
Szechuan last year owing to the civil war on the upper river, and as
the dealers were unable to produce birds when quite large sums were
offered one must assume that those brought down the preceding year
were dead.
Having twice met with no success in obtaining birds direct from
Szechuan I hope the third attempt will meet with results and that in
later issues of the Magazine we may read of " The Breeding of the
Derbyan Pararkeet " and that members will be able to see a pair of
these birds in the London Zoological Society's Gardens before next
spring.

ROSY-FACED LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99522" page_id="56773528"  page_num="347" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I read Mr. Nicholson's letter on the breeding habits of the
Rosy- or Peach-faced Lovebird ( Agapornis roseicollis) with great
interest.
In my experience of the breeding of this bird the eggs are always
incubated by the hen bird alone, the cock entering the nest solely for
the purpose of feeding the hen.
L. Christie-Miller.
Sir, --With regard to Mr. Nicholson's letter in the October issue,
seeing that you invite the experiences of other members who have bred
Agapornis roseicollis. I have bred a good many of these birds, and have
always found that the hen undertakes most of the business of incuba-
tion. It is true that the cock spends a fair amount of his time in the
nest with the hen, but that would appear to be the case with most
of the genus Agapornis. In the case of the Rosy-faces I have bred the
cock seems to spend even more time in the nest when once the young

are hatched, though the overcrowding with say five young and the two
parents in one nest must be appalling.
I have a late brood of half-fledged young in the nest at the time
of writing (24th October), and it is seldom that either of the parents
leave the nest-box.
Incidentally I have found the best nesting material for them to be
branches of lime, from which they readily strip the bark. I would
suggest that it is just possible that Mr. Nicholson mistook the sexes of
his birds, as I recently possessed an abnormal pair of which the hen was
not only the larger, which is not usual, but much the more brightly
coloured bird of the two.

MASKED LOVEBIRD'S BREEDING

<bodyText confidence="0.9985695" page_id="56773529"  page_num="348" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I am now able to record the successful breeding of the Masked
Lovebird (Agapornis per sonata). A single youngster, the only survivor
of four, flew from the nest on 29th October. The bird was as large as
the parents, and was readily distinguishable by the greyish tint of the
yellow collar and the less intense black of the head.
The nest was continually added to, so that the young were gradually
elevated in the box until almost pressed against the roof. In this the
practice of the Masked Lovebird conformed to that of the Black-cheek
and the Nyasa.
The young bird did not remain in the nest above a month.
M. V. Allen.
[Lord Tavistock has also been successful in breeding Agapornis
per sonata, but his article is unavoidably held over until next month.
In reply to our inquiry as to the date of leaving the nest, he writes, on
