REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1927
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965373260869565" page_id="58075387"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
It is satisfactory to be able to record that the year 1927 has been
a record in the annals of the Society. In the February number of the
Magazine will be found a Note, kindly furnished by Mrs. Prestwich,
on the last record year, 1909, when the Society&apos;s membership reached
451. The present year brings the membership up to 529.
The Magazine, under the able editorship of Mr. Seth-Smith, has now
attained a very high standard, and we have issued with this volume
ten coloured plates. We are very glad to find more members making
use of the Correspondence column of the Magazine, for it is here
that one of its chief uses may be found. We beg to tender our best
thanks to all who have helped to further the interests of the Society,
and especially we should like to mention the following who have given
coloured plates, defraying the cost of both artist&apos;s fee and reproduction
costs : Lord Tavistock (Barnardius crommelince), Mr. Ezra (Renauld's
Ground Cuckoo and the Yellow-breasted Cissa). We again offer our best
thanks to Miss Chawner for the translation from the French of many
articles, and to Mr. Newman for managing the Sale and Exchange
column, and at the same time we wish to express our appreciation of
the work done by Mr. Hicks in making post-mortem examinations of
a large number of birds&apos; sent him by our members.
(Signed for the Council) E. Maud Knobel,
Hon. Secretary and Treasurer.
December , 1927.

THE WHITE-FRONTED BEE-EATER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999288904761905" page_id="58075398"  page_num="Page 1" year="" vol="">
The White-fronted Bee-Eater, known to science as Melittophagus
bullockoides or albifrons , belongs to the group which has the tail neither
forked, as in the genus Dicrocercus, nor elongated as in Merops, but
square. It inhabits South Africa from Natal to the Zambesi, extending
into East Africa, and appears to be a resident species in those districts
in which it is found. Its food consists of diurnal winged insects,
especially small beetles, the wing-cases of which are subsequently
ejected.
These Bee-Eaters are said to be found near water, singly or in pairs,
perched on twigs on the look-out for insects which are always captured
on the wing. They make deep nest-holes in sand-banks, and are said
to use such holes for sleeping as well as nesting quarters.
Five specimens of this very beautiful Bee-Eater were brought
home by Mr. Webb in June last for Messrs. Gamage. They were
probably the first examples of the species to be imported to Europe.
The splendid condition in which they arrived showed Mr. Webb to be
a master in the art of caring for difficult birds, for Bee-Eaters are
certainly by no means easy birds to keep. Captain Stokes secured a
pair, of which he gave us a -very interesting account last October,
and Mr. Ezra the remaining three. I was privileged to see these birds
in their owners' aviaries last summer, and more delightful birds one

2 Capt. D. S- Stokes--The Small Bird House at the Zoo
could not wish to possess. But the secret of keeping Bee-Eaters success-
fully is to be found in the ability of their owner to keep up a plentiful
supply of live insects, and this is difficult, if not impossible, during
an English winter. Mealworms, when thrown into the air, are captured
with great precision, and during the warm months of the year every
fly, bee or wasp that enters the aviary is caught and swallowed, and
a piece of meat, hidden in some shrub, will attract an endless supply
of blue-bottles. But when winter comes the difficulty commences.
Having fed during the summer months on an abundant supply of live
food, these birds do not readily take to artificial food and, unless fed
four or five times a day with mealworms, will probably come to grief.
And it is a question whether mealworms alone will maintain any
bird in health indefinitely. Bee-Eaters have not often been kept
in captivity, so we have very little experience to go upon. In the
Zoological Gardens a pair of Australian Bee-Eaters (M crops ornatus),
obtained in the spring of 1911, lived in splendid health throughout
the summer in an outdoor aviary. They were taken into the Small
Bird House for the winter, which they survived, and again spent
the summer of 1912 in the outside aviary, but both died in the autumn

THE SMALL BIRD HOUSE AT THE ZOO
By Capt. D. S. Stokes
The pleasant winter task of reading through the Avicultural
Magazine for the last twenty years brings to mind that whereas a
good deal was written in former days about bird-keeping at the Zoo,
little has recently appeared on the subject in the Magazine. And as
the Small Bird House at present contains a very choice collection of
birds, some remarks may not be inopportune.
In the first place let no one think they can&apos;t keep birds there. They
can and do. You can see a Jackson's Whydah which has come gaily
into colour for eighteen years, a Golden Hangnest caged eleven years,
and many other old friends.
It is, of course, primarilv an exhibition in which as many species

as possible are displayed for the pleasure of fellows and the general
public, so that the birds are very numerous, though not crowded.
And if at the end of the day the cages look dirty and untidy it does not
mean they are not properly kept. When Shamahs are fed on showers of
monkey nuts, when Toucans are proffered buns complete with paper
bag by a well-meaning public, how can tidiness be maintained ? Rather
let us be thankful that the birds do not die of fits from such misguided
attentions. No ; but go into the bird house in the early morning (if
they will let you), when feeding and cleaning operations are in progress,
and you will see the care and attention that all the birds receive. Every
cage and aviary is scraped and swabbed and sponged as clean as a
: new pin ; the food is of the best, and by eleven o'clock all is ready for
the visitors. And here let me acknowledge a debt of gratitude I owe
to all the people responsible for the birds. However busy they may be,
however silly the questions I ask, the three keepers, Tanner, Raggett,
and Woods, are always kind ajid attentive and helpful. To return to
the birds ; pre-eminent is the series of Paradises. There are now eight
species of these, all the fruits of Mr. Goodfellow's two recent trips to
New Guinea. For rarity and splendour the Prince Rudolph's or Blue
Bird takes pride of place. Its lovely turquoise back and wings are but
a prelude to the glorious opal plumes, like filmy seaweed, which are to
follow when the bird shall reach maturity. The Princess Stephanie's
was recently illustrated in these pages ; there are a pair of Greater,
a splendid red-plumed Raggi's, a Hunstein's Magnificent, a King Bird,
and a Lesser Superb with wondrous pectoral shield, who will display
almost for the asking, changing himself from a bird into a catherine-
wheel of black velvet and emerald and aquamarine, and riveting
your attention by a loud whacking noise mysteriously made by some
movement of the legs and tail. There is a Wallace's Paradise, discovered
in 1858, and described in that great book The Malay Archipelago,
but never till now imported alive. At first sight it is an ugly bird, but
doubtless wonderful in display. More plainly coloured than the rest
of the tribe, it has a large green pectoral fan and from each shoulder two
long cream pennants which can be raised at any angle.
The Toucans are there in force. A Toco from Guiana with incredibly
huge orange beak spotted with black, replaces the late lamented

in the British Guiana section.
There are three Red-billed, two Ariel, three Green-billed, and a
Sulphur-breasted which has never looked otherwise than perfect for the
last seven years.
Hornbills come next in four species ; the White-crested from West
Africa, like an old lady with a lace cap and black brocaded dress, the
Black and White, the Undulated from Sumatra, and the Great Indian
Hornbill. He is the largest bird in the house, an ungainly creature of
some 4 feet, wearing a cardboard fireman&apos;s helmet and appropriately
called " Baby ", but gentle as a lamb. With his huge bill he will take
a grape as delicately as you could wish from between your lips, swallow
it, and then even offer it to you again if he likes you.
Barbets include a Lineated, a Javan Great-billed, a handsome
species with yellowish green head and a red throat, and a very attractive
small one called the Crimson-breasted, known in India as the Copper-
smith.
Of Touracos there are a Violaceous Plantain-eater, recently brought
from the Gambia by Dr. Hopkinson, a Frazer's, some Donaldsons, and
some White-breasted, demure grey and white people, lacking the lovely
colours of other races of Touracos. Rollers include the Blue-breasted,
a beautiful species from Gambia, some European, Indian, and Senegal,
as well as an Indian Broad-billed. The lovely Long-tailed South African
is not at present represented, but the last specimen lived six years.
Other interesting occupants of cages or indoor aviaries include .
Bengal Pittas, Guira Cuckoos, and a Solitary Cuckoo from Africa,
Verreaux's Amethyst Starlings, some Chats, and two species of
Sugarbirds.
Tanagers are not as well represented as in years gone by, but rare
species seem to come over so seldom. However, there are the
Desmarest's, green with a red head, the Yellow, the Superb, and one
or two other small ones, and among larger species two very beautiful
White-capped Tanagers. Birds of deep indigo blue, shading up to white
on the head, in the midst of which is a crimson blotch. Living in the
five central flight cages are birds arranged more or less by size. Two
of small Finches include a Blue-billed Weaver, a Hooded Siskin, Red-

crested Finches, and Parrot Finches of two species. Of larger soft-bills
there are a Regent Bird, Blue Robins, Indian Great Reedwarbler, a
Coach-whip bird from Australia, numerous Bulbuls and Babblers, and
a very attractive Glossy Calornis from New Guinea, green with brilliant
ruby eyes and beautiful copper and purple reflections on the head and
back. There are also superb Spreos and Royal Starlings from Abyssinia.
The five southern aviaries with outdoor flights contain a large mixed
collection. In one a Stilt from South America, a Blacksmith Plover from
South Africa, very smart in plumage of grey and black and white, and
Yellow-backed Whydahs. The next compartment has Roulrouls,
a wonderful ground Pigeon called the Grey-naped, as large as a Pheasant
and of similar shape and gorgeous colouring ; Pied Grallinas, which
built a nest and laid eggs, beautiful Spreos, and a pair of Regent Birds.
Fruit Pigeons come next, though only three species are represented
at present.
Another compartment has a pair of Sun Bitterns, and a Wood Thrush
from North America, and the last contains various Bulbuls, Cedar Birds,
Baltimore Hangnests, a Hermit Thrush, and Red-collared Whydahs.
Altogether the collection numbers close on a thousand birds, truly
a Mecca for aviculturists. The very noises are a delight to me. The
yapping bark of the Toucans, the crow of the Touracos, the ringing
wauk-wauk of the Greater Paradises and the silly Mynahs imploring
you to tell the time. The house is condemned to be pulled down to
make way for the large new ape and monkey house, and the birds are to
be transferred to the old reptile house, where, let us hope, the authorities
will provide as good quarters and as attractive a display as we have
at present.

The Ivory-billed Woodpecker (Campophilus j^rmcipalis) is in size,
though hardly in beauty, the Prince of Woodpeckers ; its length ranges
from 19 to 21 inches. It is found in Western Mexico, north along the
Sierra Madre.

<bodyText confidence="0.99896575" page_id="58075403"  page_num="Page 6" year="" vol="">
The Ivory-billed is rare, almost restricted to the extreme southern
states, especially those bordering the Gulf of Mexico. It is of a wild
and wary disposition, making its home in the dark swampy woodlands,
the dense cypress swamps of Florida being among its favourite haunts.
The nest of the Ivorv-bill is built in a hollow excavated in a tree,
from 30 to 40 feet from the ground, the cavity often being nearly 2 feet
in depth. Three or more eggs are laid.
This bird does not remain long in one place, and during the day
ranges over an extended territory. Its call, " Yap-yap-yap " sounds
in the distance like the note of a small trumpet.
All Woodpeckers are of value to cultivators and farmers, two-
thirds of their food consisting of insects, chiefly noxious wood-boring
beetles, both adults and larvse, caterpillars, mostly species that burrow
into trees, and ants, which are particularly harmful to timber. In
Mexico I found countless swarms of both red and black ants every-
where and was not able to sit down and rest on any fallen tree. One day
I put my hand into a very beautiful nest--found no eggs, but my
hand covered with ants. In one of the gateposts on the plantation
a pair of English Sparrows had reared young ones ; their last nest of
young ones I found all dead, killed by the ants.
The Downy Woodpecker ( Dnjobates pubescens) is the smallest of all
those inhabiting the Gulf States. I met with it almost everywhere,
it being very sociable in its habits, far more so than other species,
and often found in company with the White-breasted Nuthatch and
the Brown Creeper.
Early in the spring the " Downies " seek out their nesting places.
Their holes are usually excavated in dead willow-, poplar-, or oak-trees.
The entrance to the nest is about 2 inches in diameter, and the depth
of the nest hole varies from 8 to 12 inches. The eggs are four or five,
sometimes six in number, and are pure glossy white.
The Red-bellied Woodpecker ( Melanerpes carolinus ) is one of
the most beautiful of the twenty-five species of American Woodpeckers.
This bird is known in many parts as the " Zebra Bird ", from the
black and white markings of the back and tail ; head and breast scarlet
in the male ; the female only partly so.
The Blue-grey Gnatcatcher ( Polioptila ccerulea ) is found almost

everywhere in the southern states, inhabiting chiefly open, high woods,
skipping and darting about among the topmost branches of the trees,
his long tail elevated and jerking in Wren-like fashion, always moving
about and ever uttering his wheezy squeaky notes.
This bird is a most beautiful nest builder ; the nest, in fact, having
few equals. It is rather a frail structure, usually built on the small
horizontal limbs of trees, generally at an elevation of about 10 to 20 feet
The interior is deeply cupped, and the exterior is beautifully ornamented
with lichens. The eggs are four or five in number, greenish or bluish
white, speckled with chestnut.
The Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) is one of the largest of the
Warblers, often called the Yellow Mocking-bird. In the mating season
he is the noisiest bird in the woods. At this time he may be observed in
his wonderful aerial evolutions, dangling his legs and flirting his tail,
i singing all the while a sweet song. He imitates the mewing of a cat,
the barking of a dog, and other sounds, and in the variety of his notes
he is surpassed only by the Mocking-bird. The song is often heard on
bright moonlight nights. This bird migrates in winter to Eastern Mexico
and Northern Central America.
The cheerful little Phoebe is found nearly everywhere, and known
also as the Pewee, Barn Pewee, and Pewit Flycatcher. There are few
plantations or farmyards without a pair of Pewees. It is a familiar,
confiding, and gentle bird (something like our English Robin), attached
to localities and returning to them year after year.
Its nest is found in sheltered situations, such as under a bridge, a
projecting rock, in the proch of a house, etc. I found one nest with young
in the main street of a small town in the Southern Rockies, built by an
open window in full view of the family, quite unmoved by the presence of
the latter at mealtimes. In New Mexico I found another nest built in
a house on one of the rafters ; a cat took possession of this nest and
broke all the eggs, so I brought home the nest.
Motmots are peculiar to the new world, being found from Mexico
throughout the whole of Central America and the South American
continent. The general plumage is green, and the majority of the species
have large racquets at the end of the central tail feathers.
The Mexican Motmot is locally known as the Houton. To observe

this beautiful bird in his native haunts one must be in the forest at
dawn. The thick and gloomy forests are preferred by the Houton.
In the far-extending wdlds, about day-break, you hear him call in
distinct tones '' Houton, Houton ! " his tail moving from side to side
like a pendulum every time he calls. He makes no nest, but rears his
young in a hole in the sand, generally on the side of a hill.
The Purple Martin, with glossy violet black plumage, known also
as the Purple Swallow, American Martin, and Violet Swallow, is very
plentiful in the southern and many other states, wintering in Mexico
and the Bermudas. No bird is more deserving of protection and of
encouragement to live about the habitations of man than the
Purple Martin. One pair will destroy vast quantities of insects in the
season. Little nesting-boxes are fixed on the tops of poles for the
Martins. I saw many of these when travelling through the Middle
States to South-West Texas. One may see calabashes hung up by
Indians, also a hollow gourd attached to a pole near a negro hut; the
nesting-box on our plantation was often the scene of disputes between
the Martins and the English Sparrows.
Bullock's Oriole ( Icterus bullochi), one of the most handsome of the
Orioles, is found in Mexico all through the year. It is very plentiful
in the rolling prairie country traversed here and there by small streams
fringed with groves of cotton-wood trees. I found some very beautiful
nests when camping on the banks of the Gila River, North Mexico.
It is also found in Southern Arizona and Western Texas, and frequently
builds in bunches of mistletoe growing on the mesquite-tree. The
genus of American Orioles or Hangnests ( Icterus) contains about forty
species, the greater number being natives of Central and South America.
The plumage of nearly all the species is more or less coloured with shades
of yellow, orange, and black.
Audubon s Oriole ( Icterus auduboni) is another beautiful bird
found in Texas. It is more numerous in the valley of the Rio Grande
and southward in Mexico to Oaxaca. It is more common in central and
eastern Mexico than in any other part of its range. In the summer it
frequents the denser forests of its Texas home, but during the winter
months it will approach the inhabited regions.
It is said that these beautiful birds (with other Hangnests) are

frequently called upon to become the foster-parents of other birds,
and in the forest near the plantation I found a beautiful nest containing
seven eggs, two of these belonging to the Red-eyed Cowbird (Molothrus).
The Baltimore Oriole (Icterus baltimore) is locally known as the
Golden Robin and Hangnest Bird.
There is a story to the effect that when, in 1628, Lord Baltimore
was exploring in America, worn out and discouraged, he was so much
cheered by the sight and sound of the Oriole that he adopted its colours
as his own, hence the name " Baltimore Oriole This bird is fond of
building near the habitations of men. He weaves artistic habitations
in lofty trees, choosing strong flexible material for the pendant bag-
like nest, the strongest and best material being used for the part by which
I the whole is suspended. A native boy brought me a very beautiful
nest, but I was sorry to find he had accidentally broken all the eggs in
descending the tall tree in which he found it.
The Orioles are very fond of unripe maize. We had a " mealy
patch " on the plantation, and I have often watched these beautiful
birds feeding on the soft cobs.
The San Pedro Park (San Antonio), with natural springs and blue
lagoons, an old camping ground of the Comanchees, contains a large
number of wesach-trees, under which the Indians encamped in days of
old : a most delightful spot for Humming Birds and many others.
The nest of the Hummers I have mentioned in an earlier chapter
was blown out of the tree during a storm, both nest and young being
destroyed.
I have many happy memories of the four months spent on my
journey, bird life everywhere was wonderful; one could write much
more of the many species found in Texas and the Gulf States, New
Mexico, and Mexico.

By the Marquess of Tavistock and M. Delacour
The group of the Palccornithince contains several species of Parrots
and Parrakeets, which vary greatly both in size and shape. Some are
large and have fairly short, square tails ; others on the contrary have
very long and slender tails ; while there are yet others which are very
small and short-tailed.
Nearly all are seed-eaters. They are generally very handsome
birds, with the plumage differing according to sex. They live well
and some breed freely in an aviary. They are found in Asia, Africa,
and Oceania.

<bodyText confidence="0.999442136363636" page_id="58075407"  page_num="Page 10" year="" vol="">
The Eclectus Parrots are remarkable for the extraordinary difference
in colour of the sexes. The male is fine shining green, with red sides,
the wings and tail having blue markings, and the upper mandible
being red ; the female is red, with part of the back and wings, breast
and belly blue ; the tail is tipped with yellow and the beak is black.
On the whole the hen is far showier than the cock. Both sexes are
very handsome, but with their large bodies and short tails they are
not elegantly shaped, and they are inclined to be dull and morose
in confinement.
But it must also be allowed that when thoroughly tame they are
often very docile and affectionate and can be taught to say a few words.
Their voice, which luckily is rarely heard, is the most powerful and
unpleasant imaginable, and completely eclipses that of a Macaw or
Cockatoo at its worst. The hen often lays in confinement and has
sometimes reared her brood successfully.
The Eclectus Parrots, except when nesting, are gentle and harmless
with other birds, but male and female, unless they know one another,
do not agree if caged together. They will live on a seed mixture of
two parts canary, one part oats, one of hemp, one of sunflower, with
monkey nuts and plenty of ripe fruit. They should be allowed to
bathe. When they are kept in a cage, they should be let out every day
for exercise, but they do better in an indoor or outdoor aviary.

Eclectus Parrots are very susceptible to cold on first arrival and need
varmth and care ; when acclimatized and in an aviary, they only
leed heat in winter. They are very subject to contagious diseases,
md their abode must be kept perfectly clean, and they should never
3e associated with any doubtfully healthy bird. They do not stay
.veil, and cannot be trusted at liberty.
All the species and varieties require the same treatment. Six
lave been imported, often under the name of " Lories
Eclectus pectoralis from Papua is the species already described ;
t is frequently imported.
Eclectus roralus from the Moluccas (Halmaheira) also arrives pretty
requently. It may be known from the above by the male being
dightly more yellowish green ; the female is red, with nape, mantle,
*hest and belly purplish violet.
E. cardinalis from Amboina, Ceram and Bourou is small and
larker. E. westermani, E. riedeli, and E. Cornelia, all very similar, have
ikewise been imported.

The Tanygnathus Parrakeets are nearly related to the Eclectus ;
he differences of plumage between the two sexes are, however, less
striking. Two species have been occasionally imported and two others
very rarely.
Mueller's Parrakeet ( T. muellcri ) from the Celebes is a fine yellowish
jreen ; the wings are vividly marked with blue and yellow. The male
las a red beak, the female&apos;s is white, she is also not so brilliantly
*oloured. They should be given two parts of canary seed to one of
lemp and one of sunflower, with monkey nuts and plenty of fruit,
t is exceptional for one of these Parrots to show intelligence or
iffection for its owner ; as a rule they are dull, silent, stupid and
ininteresting in captivity, though they are long-lived. Probably they
re not happy, and have quite a different temperament when at liberty,
ts is shown in the case of an allied species, the Great-billed Parrot.
Mueller&apos;s Parrakeet needs heat at first, but afterwards is satisfied
vith protection from wind and damp. They are peaceful in disposition.

uninteresting when caged, but when allowed its liberty its peculiar
appearance and strange call, together with the bright colours of the male,
render it attractive. It is a native of New Guinea and the vicinity ; the
male is a beautiful green with wings delicately and beautifully marked
with blue and yellow ; the beak is red. The female is decidedly smaller
and duller, with blue only on the rump and the marking on her wings
is less distinct. This Parrot should be released at the beginning of
summer with one wing clipped; it is fairly hardy, but should be watched j
in frosty or snowy weather. This species is destructive to fruit when at j
liberty and it may be necessary to shut it up while the apples are
ripening. Individuals have paired with Alexandrine Parrakeets. |
They should have the same food as Mueller's Parrot. When they are j
at liberty, both sexes, on fine hot days, indulge in an extraordinary j
sort of " song " accompanying it with absurd movements, most
comical to watch. The courting of the female by the male is likewise j
very amusing ; he leaps into the air with strange cries.
T. luzonensis from the Philippines has blue and yellow wings j
and the top of the head is blue.
T. everetti, also a native of the Philippines, has a green head and j
blue markings on the wings mingled with yellow.

The Racquet-tailed Parrots ( Prioniturus ) are known by the j
two spathulate tips of their middle rectrices. These are " difficult '' j
birds : that is to say, they die for no apparent reason, even with the |
most careful treatment. They should be given canary seed, hemp,
millet, oats, sunflower seed, monkey nuts and fruit.
Both sexes have these curious spathulated feathers from which
they derive their name but in other respects their plumage may be very
different.
I have found this Parrot a gentle bird, but have never owned a
pair in breeding condition ; there was once a tame and gentle hen bird
at the Zoological Gardens of London, and an adult pair was imported
in the autumn of 1926.
The most freely imported species, though even this is very rare,
is P. platurus from the Celebes. The male is bright green, with a red-

Some years ago I had a pair of these birds. As they came over
uring winter I kept them in a well-warmed room. They moulted
lccessfully but the hen died of aspergillosis some weeks later. The
Lale bird was turned into an aviary when summer came, but in a few

J The Long-tailed Parrakeets ( Palceornis) have given their
*ame to their whole group. They are well-known birds with very
&amp;gt;ng narrow tails and fairly well developed heads and beaks ; almond
reen predominates in the plumage of most of them. They are chiefly
siatic. Some are extremely beautiful, and nearly all do well in cage
|l aviary. They become very tame and often learn to speak a few words
id to do tricks. Males are to be preferred to females, being more
mtle and prettier. Parrakeets do not like to be handled, but unlike
le Platycerci they become very much attached to their owner. Un-
*rtunately many are noisy. Their food should consist of a seed mixture
: two parts of canary, one of hemp, one of sunflower, with monkey
ats and plenty of all kinds of fruit; they do not care much for green
(tuff.
The Ring-necked Parrakeet ( P . torquata) which is found from
aluchistan to Cochin China, is of medium size, almond green, with a
luble black and pink collar and red beak. Hens and young birds
;e green all over and have no collar and no dark spot under the beak,
hey do not acquire full adult colouring until the third year, but they
ill breed while still in immature plumage.

Outside the breeding season the male and female show no affection
for each other : the females, indeed, are often so spiteful that it is
unsafe to leave the males with them.
This species nests twice a year when at liberty, but this does not
often happen in confinement. It often breeds very early, in February
or March. It is not as quarrelsome as the Australian Parrakeets,
but when she is nesting the female is sometimes dangerous to other birds.
Young birds reared together generally agree pretty well when adult, but
if they are not separated into pairs they may destroy each other's
young. In an aviary they damage all exposed woodwork. The Ring-
neck is decidedly capricious in its behaviour when at liberty, and its
size is not sufficient to protect it altogether from attacks by Owls.
Some specimens are good stayers ; others stay for some time and then
take their departure ; others have no idea of staying and stray at once.
A pair which mean to stay usually find a hole to breed in if there are
old trees about. Their flight is pretty and graceful: even their cries,
which are unbearable in a house, are rather agreeable than otherwise
in the open. They are not destructive to trees, but are prone to eat
too many apples. They should be let out when they are hungry, or
the male bird may first be released by himself during the nesting
season, when he feels affection for his mate and does not want to go
away from her aviary.
Tame cocks will talk quite well and can be taught all kinds of
tricks. Yellow, cream coloured, variegated and blue varieties appear
occasionally, and are very handsome. The yellows are usually hens
and are just as hardy and prolific as normally coloured birds.
The African Ring-necked Parrakeet (P. docilis) only differs
from the Indian Ring-neck in having a blackish beak, and has exactly
similar habits. It is found from Senegal to Abyssinia.
The Alexandrine Parrakeet (P. nepalensis ), which inhabits
North and Central India, resembles the preceding in both sexes and to
all ages, but is just about twice as large and has a red bar on the
shoulder. The Alexandrine Parrakeet is very hardy and is like the
Ring-neck in its ways. It is more gentle, however, and is one of the most
inoffensive Parrots, never hurting smaller birds, and rather letting
itself be bullied by its companions. It is, however, apt to be a nuisance

in an aviary as it destroys the woodwork very quickly ; also the
perches and even the wire netting if they be not sufficiently strong.
When at liberty it behaves like the Indian Ring-neck, but is lar^e
enough to be safe from owls. It likes to gnaw branches, but does not
lo a lot of damage, as it prefers the larger and commoner trees. The
Alexandrine does well in a cage, will learn to say a few words, and
becomes very fond of its owner. Occasionally one comes across very
1 beautiful yellow or blue individuals.
There are several sub-species of this bird which have been imported :
-P. eupatria from Ceylon, which is smaller; P. indo-burmanica from
Burma and Cambodia ; P. magnirostris from the Andaman Isles,
which has a larger beak. They all have the same habits as the
Alexandrine, and are very often mistaken for it.
Another species was formerly imported, but now is all but extinct,
;hom the Mauritius, P. eques, like the Ring-neck, only larger and a
larker green.
The Plum-headed Parrakeet (P. cyanocephaia ) is one of the
((prettiest members of the family and would command a high price
were it not so freely imported. It is a native of India and Ceylon.
It is rather small and its body is a slightly yellowish green, with a
ourple head passing into violet blue at the back, and there is a black
collar edged with greenish blue; the very long tail and the wings
ire shaded with yellow and pale blue ; it has a red bar on the shoulders,
die beak is yellow and black. Hens and young birds have lavender
coloured heads and no red on the shoulders. There does not seem to
3e any reason why hens should be so scarce, but among fifty lots not
pven one hen may be present.
It is a hardy species and will nest readily, in a cage as well as in an
iviary. It is not noisy, and in the nesting season the cock utters a
rind of whistle, which at all events in the open air is quite musical,
-t does not often gnaw or spoil the shrubs in its aviary. It does not
*&amp;gt;tay well when at liberty. Yellow individuals are sometimes found,
vith more or less rose-coloured heads.
It requires the same food and treatment as the Ring-necked
Parrakeet.

Blossomhead in Burma and Indo-China. It is slightly smaller and has
a pretty lilac rose-coloured head. The hen also has red on the shoulders.
Lutinos sometimes occur. Its habits are the same as the above-
mentioned.
The Slaty-headed Parrakeet (P. schisticeps) from the Himalayas
is larger, has a longer tail, and its head is a pretty deep violaceous grey,
beak red. The sexes are alike. P. finschi from Burma and Indo-China
is somewhat more yellowish. Both kinds are very pretty, but rare in
captivity.
The Malabar Parrakeet (P. peristeroides) from Southern India
is one of the prettiest, only too rarely imported. Its head, back, and
breast are a beautiful ashen grey with a black collar bordered with
greeny-blue, and there is some green round the eye ; the wings and tail
are bluish green, the beak red. The hen has a black beak and no
bluey green round her black collar.
This is a hardy species if provided with a shelter against wind and
rain, but, like all the Ring-neck family, goes early to nest, and if the
hen is allowed to lay in cold weather she generally dies of egg binding.
To rear these Parrakeets one must either give them a heated shelter,
or not provide them with a log before the middle of April. Malabars
are noisy and do not thrive in a cage. They should have the same
treatment as the Ring-neck.
Layard's Parrakeet (P. calthropce ) is a rare and pretty species j
from Ceylon, which may easily be recognized by its lavender-grey
head, violet-grey mantle and rump and tail of the same tipped yellowish
green. The under parts and the wings are green, beak red. The hen
has a black beak. Its great drawback is its piercing and monotonous j
call, which is intolerable in a house. An old male which I have is tame, j
amiable and inoffensive to other birds. He is always at liberty and;
does not attempt to go away, but this doubtless is because he is so j
tame. This is a delicate species when it first comes over and requires
heat and care, but once acclimatized can winter outside. It should be
fed and treated like the Ring-neck, and is very fond of fruit.
The Derbyan Parrakeet (P. derbijana ) from China is a large
bird ; it is green, with a grey head, a wide black band round the
neck and a violet breast, the male has a red beak, the female a black one.

This species would probably prove as hardy as the other members
of its family.
The Moustache Parrakeet (P. fasciata) is freely imported into
Europe. Of medium size, it has a large beak, and a rather short tail,
and it is not elegantly shaped. It is green shading into yellow, with
a grey head, a large black moustache and a rosy lilac breast. The male
has a red beak ; the female a black one. Young birds have green
j breasts. The species is found from the Himalayas to Tonkin. It
is a hardy and prolific species, but noisy and aggressive. It does
. well at liberty but has little to recommend it as a cage bird. Young
birds in their intermediate plumage are often sold as rarities. Food
and treatment should be the same as for the Ring-neck.
The Javan Parrakeet (P. alexandri) only differs from the above
in being smaller ; the female has a red beak, which makes it hard to
distinguish the sexes except by the more feminine look of the hen.
I had a pair which nested several times but did not rear the young.
( This hen always finished the nesting season by starting to murder
the male. This pair seemed to feel the cold and could not stand the
winter out of doors.
The Grey-headed Parrakeet (P. caniceps) from the Nicobar
islands only differs from the Moustache Parrakeet in its larger size
and in the absence of pink on the breast.
The Modest Parrakeet (P. modesta) from Sumatra is also rather
large; it is green with a black moustache ; the cheeks and nape are
bright rose colour and the crown is reddish and the breast brown ;
the beak is red.
The Nicobar Parrakeet (P. nicobarica) is like it but has a green
breast and green crown to the head.
Tytler's Parrakeet (P. tytleri) from the Andaman Islands, is a
near relative, rather smaller, with a back less tinged with yellow.
All these three species are rare and susceptible to cold as are also
I the following :--
The Malaccan Parrakeet (P. longicauda) is a delightful bird,
rather small, having a very long tail. Its colours are a beautiful light
green, cheeks and nape bright rose ; it has a large black moustache
and the crown of the head is deep green. The large wing and tail

feathers are blue, as well as the middle of the back. The beak is red.
The female is a little less brilliant and has a black beak. It eats the
same food as the Ring-neck, but it feels cold more than any other
Parrakeet. It requires a temperature of not less than 70*, and is likely
to die should it fall below 60*, for which reason we cannot hope to
keep and breed it in this climate unless in a specially constructed and
heated room as for Humming Birds. It is a native of the Malay
Peninsula and Sumatra.
The Blue-rumped Parrakeet
Here should be placed a very pretty little Malayan Parrakeet,
Psittinus incertus, which is rarely imported. It has a short tail and
large head. The head and neck are grey blue ; back dark grey, rump
bright blue, wings variegated with green, blue, yellow, and red, tail
green ; the under parts are olive tinged with grey blue, the beak red.
The female has a green back and browm head. It is decidedly delicate
and must be kept very warm. It should be fed like a Lovebird with
the addition of plenty of fruit.
The Lovebirds
The Lovebirds ( Agapornis ) make up a small family of miniature
Parrots, natives of Africa. In size they are about the same as or a
trifle larger than a Sparrow. They have short, broad tails. They
thrive and breed freely in aviaries, but do not live long in a cage.
Some species are quarrelsome among themselves, and pairs should not
be kept together. Some have a curious habit of lining their nests
w T ith strips of fine bark which they put on their backs between their
wings ; in this way they sometimes carry quite a load.
The Grey-headed Lovebird (A. cana) from Madagascar is the
best known in Europe. The sexes are easily distinguished, the hen being-
green, lightly washed with olive all over and paler underneath, while
the cock has a pale grey head and neck. Young cocks may be recognized
from the first although they are greener than adults. This Lovebird
goes readily to nest: the hen bird lines her nest wdth strips of bark
or little twigs.
They should be fed on millet, canary, and hemp, and some green
stuff. The males are fairly peaceful with other birds, but the females

are very spiteful and dangerous to weaker birds. Grey-headed Love-
birds may be bred at liberty during the summer, but they are not
entirely hardy, and as a rule cannot winter in&apos;the open : if they are
exposed to much cold they are apt to contract an incurable disease
of the lungs.
The Peach- or Eosy-faced Lovebird (A. roseicollis) from South-
East Africa is a charming bird, rather larger than the above. Its
colour is a pretty almond green, paler below, with the front of the
crown, the cheeks and the throat a pretty rose colour which gradually
merges into the green ; all the lower back and the rump are light
blue ; the tail is green, mingled with blue and red ; the beak is ivory
white, greenish at the tip. The sexes are similar, but the male has
&apos;perhaps a slightly larger expanse of rose colour on his head. This
is a very free-breeding species, but is spiteful towards its own kind
as well as with other birds. It is quite useless to try and keep two pairs
together. Feeding and general treatments should be the same as given
to the preceding species ; like the Madagascar, this bird is not altogether
hardy, and only certain individuals can pass the winter in the open air.
Although it does not always stay well, the Peach-faced Lovebird
can be kept at liberty ; it is necessary to accustom it thoroughly to
an artificial type of nest before releasing it, as in a natural state it is
:&amp;gt;said to use the nests of the sociable Weaver Bird and it does not find
9 ,
- nesting places readily in an English garden.
The Eed-faced Lovebird (A. pullaria) from West Africa is smaller
than the preceding species, grass green with forehead, cheeks, and
throat vermilion orange-red ; beak also red. The lower back blue
and the tail marked with red. The male has much more red on his face
and is brighter than the female. Although often delicate and susceptible
to cold when first imported, this Lovebird is quite hardy when
acclimatized and can stand bad weather. It does not breed freely,
even under the best conditions ; it does well at liberty and can be left
i out through the winter provided Owls are not too numerous. It should
; have the same food as the preceding species, with the addition of a
little apple.
The Abyssinian Lovebird (A. taranta) is rather large ; it is
brilliant green with part of the wings and tail black. The male has part

of the head carmine red, but the head of the female is green. Both
sexes have red beaks and the young resemble the female. Until
quite recently this was an exceedingly rare bird in Europe, but it
had once been bred. Lately it has been imported in large quantities.
It seems inclined to go to nest, but is very quarrelsome with its own
kind. It should be treated like the Grey-headed Lovebird.
The Black-cheeked Lovebird (A. nigrigenis) from Rhodesia
was only discovered some years ago. It has recently been imported
in large numbers and proved an excellent aviary bird, very hardy
and very prolific. Several pairs can be kept together and agree like
Budgerigars. This little Lovebird has black cheeks and is rather
dark green elsewhere, paler underneath ; the points of the wings are
black ; the head and neck are brownish green, and the face is brown;
the eye has a white circle round it, the beak is pink, deeper in colour
towards the tip. Its breast is a pretty tawny orange. Male, female,
and young are alike. It should be fed like the Grey-headed Lovebird;
it uses the green bark of trees as well as hay and straw to line its nest,
but it is wise not to let it nest during winter months.
The Black-cheeked Lovebird cannot be kept at liberty because
it is a migrant and departs in August after it has stayed for some
time and bred.
The Nyasa Lovebird (A. liliance) is a very recent importation.
It is rather like a small Peach-face with a green rump and a white circle
round the eye. It seems remarkably hardy and prolific, and resembles
the Black-cheeked Lovebird in disposition.
Two rare species of Lovebirds have recently been imported to
America, and went through London. Both live on the highlands of
the Tanganyika ; one, A. per sonata, somehow resemble the Black-
cheeked Lovebird, but has a dark brown head with a definite yellow
collar ; the other, A. Jinschi, is larger and resemble the Peach-faced
Lovebird, but has an orange red head.

tongues are not furnished with brushes. They have a curious custom
of sleeping head downward hanging by their claws.
They are to be found in tropical Asia and Oceania, and are seldom
imported and not much sought after by amateurs. It cannot be
denied that they are difficult to keep, but they are not very difficult
to feed and their voices are not unpleasant; they are inoffensive
with other birds and their habits are interesting, and when in good

If
birds should try to obtain Hanging Parrakeets.
The stock food is banana mixed with an equal quantity of crushed
sponge cake, ripe fruit, canary seed, and a few mealworms. A shallow
|bath should be hung on the wires of their cage, and the Hanging
Parrakeets rarely descend to the ground. They are delicate when
first introduced and always remain subject to enteritis and pneumonia,
yet when acclimatized they can stand a little frost without suffering.
They should be taken in about the middle of October and pass the winter
either in a sunny heated aviary or in a large cage, which must be kept
scrupulously clean and protected from draughts and changes of
\0x25BAtemperature.
It is not easy to detect the first symptoms of illness in a Hanging
Parrakeet, for they breathe heavily at all times, and when sleepy raise
-their head feathers and half close their eyes. One of the chief difficulties
with them comes from their trouble with wire netting : they climb
it easily, but when they want to fly they are hung up as if their claws
iiwere too long ; the result is that they lose their equilibrium, dash
I against something and hurt themselves. I lost many in this way,
and was eventually obliged to keep their aviary lined with string
netting and to cover all the wooden parts with soft stuff. Every
[ effort should be made to prevent their claws from getting overgrown.
The Vernal Hanging Parrakeet (L . vernalis ) from India and
Indo-China is green with a red rump, the throat and under the tail
I pale blue. The sexes are alike. Some of our specimens are more slender
and have darker eyes than the others. One of the larger, lighter-eyed

L. Jtosculus from Timor has the nape tinted orange and an elongated
red spot on the throat. Except for these differences they resemble
L. vernalis. L. chrysonotus from Cebu (in the Philippines) is green
with red forehead and rump, the crown, nape of the neck, and the upper
part of the back yellow, and a red spot on the breast. L. philippinensis
from Luzon has a red spot on the head, another on the nape, and a
larger one on the throat is orange ; the rump is red. All these species
have only been very occasionally imported.
The Ceylon Hanging Parrakeet (L . indicus) is pale green with
a red rump, and in the male a red spot on the head. It is fairly often
imported.
The Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeet (L. galgulus) is one of the
prettiest and most freely imported. It has a black beak, differing from
all the species hitherto described, which have yellowish red beaks.
The young, with dull and often soiled plumage, are not very attractive
on arrival, but an adult male clad in bright green wdth an intensely
blue spot on the crown of his head and throat and rump of dazzling
red, reminds one of a tropical flower when he hangs up by his feet and
the sun shines on him. The female has no red throat and scarcely
any blue on her head.
Those which I have are pretty quarrelsome among themselves and
wdth their relations ; but are harmless to little birds and seem rather
afraid even of Waxbills. The courtship of the male is pretty and
strange : he runs rapidly along the perch uttering a kind of buzzing
noise and suddenly raises the red feathers on his throat and rump.
Sclater's Hanging Parrakeet (L . sclateri) of the Isle of Tula

red stripe on the throat. I had one male some years ago w r hich only

four years, and had made several attempts during the last three years,
but had been unable to rear their young ones. During 1926, however,
seven young have been reared from three nestg. The nests were built
by the hen alone ; they were made of blades of grass pulled out of the
lawn of the aviary, and lined with horsehair and coco-nut fibres.
The first clutch consisted of three eggs ; the following ones of two each,
The eggs being pure white. The hen sits for eleven days, the cock taking
qo part in incubation. When hatched the young are dark red with a
pale greyish down. They are chiefly fed by their mother with small
insects, seeds, and green food. They leave the nest when nine days
fid, when they resemble their mother, though of a darker hue ; their
heads are almost bare of feathers, and they have very short tails. But
they can fly well and like hiding among the branches. They feed them-
selves when about twenty-five or thirty days old, at which time the
feathers of the head have completely grown, but they still lack the crest,
which does not appear until the first moult, which takes place about
nine weeks after they have left the nest.
The Red-crested Finches are good aviary birds, very handsome
and sufficiently hardy to be wintered out in an unheated aviary.
Their call note is low and plaintive, and repeated frequently. The
mng of the cock is uninteresting, and very similar to that of
Coryphospingus pileatus ; it is composed of some sharp notes and ends
m a trill.
I think that this species has not been previously bred in captivity.

Sir --I was interested to read the letter in the last issue of the
Magazine in regard to a new species of AAaxbill from East Africa.
I brought some Waxbills myself from the Island of Mozambique this
summer and also received some more this autumn from my friend,
Mr. Schulz, of Tanganyika Territory. These Waxbills resembled the j
Common Whxbill but were considerably smaller, of a darker colour,
more distinctly marked and had the areas which are pink in the ordinary
Waxbill replaced by vivid red ; the difference between the two species
was very apparent when they were compared side by side.
Unfortunately they proved to be very delicate and all died within
a few months; this was no doubt due to the great differences of tempera-
ture between here and East Africa. During the time I was at Mozam-
bique the thermometer was seldom below 110* F.

The very fine Roller depicted in the accompanying plate was
nought home from the Gambia by Dr. Hopkinson in July, 1925, and
ived in the Zoological Gardens until December, 1926. It appears
o have been the first living example of this species to reach this
country. The Blue-breasted Roller is readily distinguished from the
&amp;gt;ther species of the genus by its buff-coloured head and upper breast,
hackish back and rich ultramarine-blue under parts. It is a resident
pecies in Senegambia, but very little appears to have been recorded
)f its habits, though probably these do not differ from those of the other
pecies of the genus.
Rollers, in spite of their great beauty, are not very often kept in
*aptivity, neither are they particularly easy birds to keep. They are
'ery quarrelsome and, as a rule, each individual must have a cage or
kviary to itself, that is to say so far as others of its own kind are con-
*erned. They will not, generally speaking, disagree with birds that are
mrelated to them. The food of Rollers in nature consists of insects,
^.specially beetles, small frogs, and probably newly-hatched birds,
he method of feeding being to sit motionless on some bare branch of
tree and to scan the surrounding ground for any creature moving
&amp;gt;n the ground within the range of vision. Slow flying insects are also

2G Gapt. H. S. Stokes--Importation from Portuguese East Africa
taken on the wing. In captivity they should be fed upon a goo
insectivorous mixture in which there is a fair amount of fresh ra^
meat, also mealworms and cockroaches.
They thrive better in an aviary, where they can indulge in High
and, incidentally, exhibit the striking colours of their wing feather
than in a cage, and a Roller with full powers of flight, in an outdoc
aviarv, forms a very beautiful exhibit during the summer months.

A small but choice collection of birds has recently arrived at Messrs
Carnage's under the care of Mr. Webb, who has put in some months c
arduous work trapping under difficult conditions, and a good dec
more work getting his birds home to England in the beautiful conditio
we have come to associate with this collector.
Species new to aviculture in this country include the Purple Creste
Touracou ( Gallirex porphyriocephalus), 1 three specimens, of usud
Touracou colouring, with an irridescent crest of green and purph
These have gone to Mr. Ezra and Mr. Spedan Lewis.
The Natal Robin Chat ( Cossypha natalensis ) is very beautiful ij
shape, and coloured grey and orange. There are several Black Rail
(Limnocorax niger) of small size, and blue-black colour and (alas) onl
a hen of the Rufous Crake ( Corethrura rufa), a tiny species no larg^
than a Painted Quail, chestnut and black, spotted with white. Th
Blue Necked Rail (Pall us coerulescens) is also represented by on
specimen.
Two species of Sunbirds are also thought to be imported for th
first time, though the naming of Sunbirds seems to be in some confusior
They are a tiny one called the Plum Coloured ( AntJirothreptes longuemar .

(Concluded from Vo/. IV, p. 305)
The Brown-hooded Kingfisher ( Halcyon albiventris) belongs to the
genus Halcyon , the species of which do not keep exclusively to the
1 water like the other Kingfishers.
These birds will sit for hours on the branch of a dead tree or in
:some other conspicuous spot where the vegetation is rank and luxuriant,
t-rnd which is conducive to an abundance of insects, on the look-out for
[ dieir prey, which consists of large insects, lizards, etc. ; the birds sit
perfectly motionless except for the occasional turning of the head.
These Kingfishers frequently chase each other through the bush with
oud resounding cries.
They would make ideal cage birds, being intelligent, very beautiful,
[ind easy to cater for.
&apos;

sew Series, p. 119), the figure of the male being drawn from the first example

intil now has any number arrived.--E d.]

Speckled Mouse Birds (Colius striatus) always remind me of
Parrakeets, both in flight and general demeanour. They live in the
dense bush in small parties of about a dozen or more, and I have&apos;often
noticed that a little party of three or four would fly single file into a
bush, and a few minutes or so afterwards a few more would come, until
quite a number were gathered together. They usually sit very close
to each other, either lying on a branch or hanging underneath it, and
when in the latter position they half open their wings, puff out their
feathers, and sun themselves.
The Mouse Birds seem to be possessed of very little intelligence, for
great numbers visit orchards and get shot, yet there is always a con-
tinuous stream of newcomers, just as though nothing had happened.
They eat hard green fruit, especially peaches, which w T ould kill any
other bird; they eat these when hardly the size of a waluut, and in
fact seem very partial to them, for when they can get these they leave
other ripe fruit untouched. In this way they are a great pest to the fruit
growers and no amount of scaring will keep them aw r ay. Hundreds
can be shot in a single day, and yet their numbers never seem to
diminish ; this is strange, for they cannot be called common in any
district.
The flight though swift is rather laboured and heavy.
The Trumpeter Hornbills (Bycanistes buccinator), wdiicli are but little
inferior in size to the Crested Hornbills, frequent the wooded slopes
of the mountain and the dense bush lands at the foot. I have seldoir
seen them in the forest itself like that bird, except for a short time in
the year wdien certain berries are ripe on the forest trees, then they art
seen in small parties.
Outside the confines of the forest the Hornbills consort in pain
or small parties composed of three or four birds, and they are seer
on the tops of the large fruit or berry bearing trees.
They are tolerably tame, and let one approach within a goocj
distance for observation. They sometimes sit for hours scarce!}
moving, with a very dreamy expression in their eyes, no doubt due tc
the long black eye-lashes.
The cry, which is fairly loud, has nothing like the volume of that
made by the Crested Hornbill.

The Crested Hornbills (Bycanistes cristatus), which are amongst the
argest of the Hornbills, are very rare in South Africa, Mount Selinda
ieing one of the few places in wdiich they are &apos;found, and there they
ire seen in pairs or small flocks in the environs of the forest. In the
&apos;ores! itself the birds live in the tops of the tallest trees, feeding upon
l-dieir fruit.
The first time I was in the forest I was startled by a noise similar
o that made by an engine when letting off steam, this was made by a
arge flock of these birds, which I had disturbed in a tree over my head.
\0x25A0 [ doubt if there is another bird in the world which makes such a noise
,vhen in flight; the noise made by a flock of these birds flying over head
; s incredible. The call, too, is extremely loud, and it would lead one to
phink, if he did not know, that it was made by some large mammal
'ather than a bird ; it is a very loud braying bark, and is one of the
[well-known sounds of Mount Selinda.
The first birds that I saw on the mountain were a pair of these
Hornbills, wdiich flew 7 out of the forest into the blue gum-trees near the
lomestead as soon as w T e arrived. I don't know wdiether this w T as
lue to inquisitiveness, for I never saw the birds again there, they are
isually very shy on account of their huge size.
During the time that I w^as at Mount Selinda the majority of the
Hornbills there frequented one large tree in the forest, and at any time

if the dav one w^as almost sure to see a flock of them there, either
feeding upon the fruit or resting. Owdng to the great height of the tree,
pver 200 feet, it was necessary for me in order to observe them to
1 ie on my back, a by no means pleasant business especially w T hen an
j irmy of the fierce black forest ants passed in the vicinity. After
&apos;eeding the birds pair themselves off, and sit affectionately side by
f side.
One would think that the preening of the feathers would be a
! iifficult task for the birds, owdng to the enormous size of the beak,
i but this is not so, in fact they seem to be able to preen even the neck
i fathers with the greatest of ease.
It is a wonderful sight to see a flock of about twenty or more of
j:hese huge birds feeding in the forest trees. It is very amusing to
watch them courting, the hen squats dowm on a branch, the cock

meanwhile hopping about among the branches in a state of great
excitement, and every now and then bringing his intended mate a small
berrv in the tip of his great beak ; at other times he squats by her side
and preens her feathers and keeps eyeing her with many loving glances.
During this performance both birds look singularly grotesque.
I have questioned the natives through an interpreter--which is always
a very unsatisfactory business--in regard to the nesting habits of
these birds ; they state that the nest is made in a large hole at the top!
of one of the great forest trees, the female entering and the male then
plastering the entrance up with dung ; she is fed by him during the!
lengthy period of incubation and the rearing of the young.
The natives say that the hen moults during the time she is imprisoned
in her nest.
The colour of these birds is glossy greenish black, the feathers of
the back having a scaled appearance, the feathers of the head are
elongated, and form a full loose crest, the feathers at the front are
lavender grey, with the basal half black.
The ear coverts are grey, the feathers of the neck and throat tipped
with that colour ; the lower back, the tail coverts, the lower abdomen,
the back of the thighs, white ; the two central tail feathers are black,
the rest broadly tipped with white.
The enormous casque is light horn colour, the beak dark horn.
The naked skin round the eye pink, the eyes themselves are very
large, and there are long sweeping black eve-lashes, which give the
bird a very gentle expression.
The casque of the female is much smaller and darker than that of
her mate.
The beak and casque of this Hornbill is of a very fine texture, almost
like tissue paper, and when the bird is flying between one and the sun
the light shines through and it appears to be a rose pink colour ; this is
due to the presence of fine blood vessels in the structure.
These Hornbills in common with the rest of the family are very
poorly feathered, the under wing and under tail coverts being hardly
visible, and are little more than down, this I suppose accounts for the
noisy flight. The whole body too is very poorly feathered, the feathers
being thin and of a poor quality.

Sydney Portei--Notes on Birds of Mount Selinda 81
[i
Though the flight seems to be very heavy and laboured when the
&amp;gt;irds fly short distances, yet when they pass from hill to hill or from
"ne mountain to another, the flight seems remarkably light and
moyant, and they sail long distances with outstretched motionless wing.
The Ground Hornbill (Bucorax caffer) has been previously mentioned,
o I will say little else in regard to it.
The natives in Gazaland believe that the bird can detect any animal
hat may be in a hole in the ground by its sense of smell, they say
hat the bird then proceeds to blow down the hole, the foul breath of
he bird causing the unfortunate inhabitant to come to the entrance
or fresh air, when it is at once seized and devoured.
A pair of these birds were kept by a man at a native trading store,
,ome twenty miles from Mount Selinda, and when they were full grown
hey developed the most voracious appetite. There were large numbers
hi cats at this store kept to check the increase of rats, and, like all
members of the domesticated feline tribe, they were extremely prolific,
out the small community never increased in spite of numerous additions
rom time to time ; the reason for this was discovered one day by the
A
\ oroprietor, who saw one of the Hornbills seize upon a whole family
)f cats, and one by one throw them into the air (as they do with all
heir food) and gulp them down alive.
These birds live in small parties of uneven number, either five,
seven, or nine, seldom more or less.
I spoke to many people about this curious fact, including people
who had lived in Rhodesia many years, and had seen hundreds of them,
but they all said that they had never seen a party composed of an
even number. Perhaps the odd one acts as a chaperon !
The Narina Trogon ( Ha&apos;pcdoderma narina). The Trogons are very
beautiful and delicately coloured birds with very loose fine plumage,
tiny feet and small curved wings, which are usually hidden beneath the
long silky feathers of the back. They only inhabit the recesses of the
forests, and are never seen in the open country. They are found in
nearly all the tropical countries of the world, and live entirely upon
insects.
One species only is found in Southern Africa, namely the Narina
Trogon.

The first time I saw this beautiful creature at Mount Selinda was when
I was on the road through the forest to the Mission Station. I had been
watching Green Bulbuls when I heard the coo of a Dove as I thought
which I had never heard before ; I went in the direction of the sound,
and was greatly surprised to find that the sound was made by a Trogon.
The note was almost identical with that made by the English Wood
Pigeon, and while uttering it the Trogon sat upright on a branch, the
feathers being compressed against the body, making the bird look
extremely slim. I watched the bird for a short time until it flew away,
when I endeavoured to follow, but the undergrowth proved too thick;
it continued to call for a considerable time, the sound getting fainter
and fainter as it retreated to the heart of the forest.
Afterwards I saw these birds from time to time, always being
attracted in the first place by their dove-like notes. They live singly,
and inhabit the tallest trees in the gloomiest part of the forest, where
they pass from tree to tree with a silent and ghost-like flight.
These Trogons, at least the males, have patches of loose bare skin
of a brilliant bluish green colour above and behind the eye, at the
base of the beak, and on the throat; these are capable of erection, for I
have noticed that when the bird is uttering its cooing notes these
patches stand out very vividly against the rest of the plumage, and I
believe they are used in the display.
In colour the males are a wonderful golden metallic green above,
also on the upper breast and throat, the rest of the under parts being
a lovely shade of rose pink. The primary feathers are remarkably
narrow and sickle shaped. The wings are a mixture of black, white,
grey, and green, the wing-coverts being very finely vermiculated. The
four central tail feathers are dark glossy green, the rest are white with
black bases. The bill is pale green, and the bird has a very wide gape,
like that of a Nightjar. The female is somewhat similar to the male in
plumage, but is of a browner colour, and the rose pink under parts
are not so brightly coloured.
The Golden-tailed Woodpecker (Campothera abingdoni) was only
met with once or twice on some of the thinly wooded slopes of the
mountain, where it at once attracted my attention by its loud full
crv. It is a very active bird, and runs with great speed up and down

: the tree trunks, stopping every now and then to hammer at the bark
or to extract some grub, but it feeds principally upon a small species
of tree ant, licking them up with its long tongue as it runs along; in a
specimen that was secured I found the plumage full of these ants.
The Cardinal Woodpecker ( Dendropicus cardinalis) was exceedingly
common on the mountain, always busily engaged in running about the
ptree trunks in search of small insects which inhabit the bark. Some-
times these birds had singing parties in the trees, a dozen or so would
gather together and indulge in the most hilarious behaviour, in fighting,
}k chasing each other from tree to tree, and making a great noise. They
have no real song, but have a series of rich pleasant calls. The Cardinal
Woodpecker is the smallest of the South African Woodpeckers.
The Scaly-throated Honey Guide ( Indicator variegatus) is rare, and
I only saw it once deep in the forest, where it was hopping about the
branches of a tall tree, uttering the strange notes which are characteristic
of the family. I know nothing of its habits beyond that it is a very
quiet and unobtrusive bird, and is very rarely seen.
Levaillant's Barbet ( Trachyphonus cafer) are found but sparingly
( in the districts lying at the foot of Mount Selinda, where they at once
attract attention by their loud cries; they are very seldom seen, and
 |keep to the thick bush, as though conscious of their loud colouring.
They never associate in parties like the Black-collared Barbet.
The Emerald Cuckoo ( Chrysococcyx smaragdineus). When a child
I once saw a stuffed skin of this bird in a taxidermist&apos;s window, and I
was so struck by its extraordinary beauty that from that day I cherished
i a great desire to see the bird in its native haunts. Later on, I again
made its acquaintance; unfortunately--as part of millinery impedi-
menta--once in Paris I saw no less than seven skins of this wonderful
bird forming in conjunction with a chaotic mass of material what is
usually called a hat, but it was not until coming to the Mountain of
Selinda that I made the acquaintance of this exquisite bird in its forest
home.

One usually thinks of the Cuckoos as sombre-coloured birds, in
fact, most of them are, but the genus Chrysococcyx proves the exception,
in fact, they can boast of few rivals in the avian world, especially
the Emerald Cuckoo, whose colour is the most remarkable glittering

emerald green, the feathers having the appearance of scales ; the lower
parts are delicate canary yellow, the tail feathers are tipped with white,
the under tail coverts white barred with emerald green. The female
is marked with brown and is white on the under parts barred with green.
These Cuckoos are essentially forest birds, inhabiting the tops of
the highest trees, where they find most of their food, which consists
mainly of hairy caterpillars, and I have frequently seen them consume
quite large ones.
The presence of the bird (the male) can easily be detected by its
loud, clear, and very distinct whistle, which consists of three notes,
" chu--chu--chit,&amp;quot; which is uttered very slowly and repeated at
frequent intervals.
When about to call the bird chooses some thick straight branch in
the shade, then straightens himself out horizontally, and as he calls
he turns slowly round and round, moving his tail up and down, and
appearing to put his utmost strength into the production of the song.
The bird continues the call sometimes in the same position for over an
hour at a time, then it will fly to another tree close by, and on alighting
give utterance to a particularly loud alarm note, which is very different
to its usual song, and when it has found a suitable branch it commences
to call again.
Unless in the sunlight, the bird is very difficult to see in spite of its
brilliant plumage, which seems to tone down in the shadows and
harmonize with the surrounding foliage.
The female is an extraordinary illusive creature, and very difficult
to observe, for she cannot be detected by any note, for she is com-
paratively silent and very few T white people seem to have seen one.
Rain and mist do not seem to damp this bird's ardour, for I have
frequently heard its loud ringing notes when the wdiole forest has been
enveloped in dense rain clouds, so thick that the tops of the trees
were invisible.
These Cuckoos are parasitic, laying their eggs in the nests of other
birds.
The Klaas Cuckoo (Chrysococcyx klaasi) is another of the exquisite
Golden Cuckoos that I have occasionally seen on the lower
wooded slopes of the mountain. Like the Emerald Cuckoo it has a

remarkable loud clear call, and also like the latter bird it is hard to see
owing to its plumage harmonizing so well with the foliage.
It is never seen in the forest, but seems to prefer the more open
country.
Owing to its comparative tameness, I have had very good oppor-
tunities of observing it. It betrays its presence by its flute-like whistle
of three notes. The hen too has a distinctive note, but it is quite
different to that of her mate.
The birds seem to go about in pairs, the cock being an exemplary
husband. The hen seems to be very lethargic, at least she assumes
&apos; that pose whilst her husband makes a very energetic search of the
thorn-trees for the hairy caterpillars upon which these birds feed. As
soon as he has found one he brings it back to his mate, approaching
her with great ceremony, drooping his wings and raising and fanning
his tail, and, holding his head up as if to say, " Look what a fine one
this is,&apos;' he gives it to his mate, but I regret to say that she like many
humans shows little or no appreciation of what her husband does, but
simply snatches the food as soon as he is within reach and without
more ado swallows it. If the hen has moved to another tree before the
cock returns, he shows great concern when he finds that she has gone,
and hopping about all over the tree, he utters his call note, &amp;quot; Where
is it, where is it ? until she answers in a low whistle, " Here, here, here.
I once saw a male feed his mate during the whole of a morning,
and even then she was not satisfied.
The feathers on the thighs of the male are very long, and make
him appear as though he wore a pair of long white trousers.
In colour the male is shining emerald green, glossed with golden
copper, and marked with white above, the lower parts being white too.
The female is barred with creamy buff and brown, and looks very
much like a small edition of an immature European Cuckoo, except
that she has metallic green on some parts of her plumage.
Burchell&apos;s Coucal (Centropus burchelli) is very common, and is found
in the dense bush and reed beds which border the fast-running mountain
streams.
Its peculiar loud bubbling note, like the noise made by water running
out of a narrow-necked bottle, is often heard in the early mornings

and evenings; it is one of those strange exotic noises that are so pleasing
to the ear of the bird-lover in the tropics.
Burchelks Coucal differs in its habits from the Senegal Coucal, which
is the common Coucal in Rhodesia, in being practically terrestrial, this
being shown by the highly developed hind toe which resembles that
of a lark. When disturbed the bird rises up out of the undergrowth,
and flies a short distance, then dives again into the dense vegetation, 1
where it creeps about in search of the insects upon which it subsists. &amp;gt;
Occasionally I saw the birds on the edge of the forest, low down in the
dense jungle.
In colour, these birds are glossy greenish black on the head, nape,
and upper back, the mantle and scapulars chestnut with white shaft
streaks, the lower back is finely barred grey and white, the tail-coverts
greenish black, barred with white, the tail-feathers greenish black,
tipped with white, the entire under surface creamy white.
Livingstone's Touracou (Turacus livingstonii). Touracous are
large, splendid birds, quick and graceful in their movements, and
wonderful in their colouring, which is usually a harmonious combina-
tion of green, purple, blue, and carmine. Their attractive qualities
make them very suitable birds for aviaries.
The Livingstone's Touracou is a forest-loving bird, and only
frequents the densely wooded districts, and is seldom found outside
the confines of the dark forests, where it lives in the sunshine on the
tops of the great forest trees and never descends to the ground. It
betrays its presence by its extremely loud raucous cry, which resembles
the caw of a rook, but is very much louder and quicker, and when a
party of these birds form chorus the noise is perfectly deafening.
These Touracous seem to indulge in dancing and " singing " parties
in the high tree-tops. I have often watched parties of six or more
birds playing together, sometimes they all run together, one behind the
other, along a horizontal branch until they come to the end, when they
fly in single file across to another tree, where they fly from branch to
branch displaying their splendid carmine wings. If one sits quietly
they continue to play about, but sometimes in the middle of the play
they remember that they are being watched, and suddenly crouch
down in a clump of leaves and become almost invisible.

At times the forest seems to swarm with these birds, judging by
:he noise they make. They give full vent to their vocal powers about
rundown.
They live almost entirely on fruit and berries, but are especially
r ond of a small orange green berry which grows upon a large forest
cree; this berry is relished by most fruit-eating birds, it has the most
; horrible taste, and I can hardly see how birds can have any sense
of taste if they eat it; it is called the Guniti-berry.
If one happens to be near one of these Touracous when flying, a
remarkably loud rustle is heard even if the bird makes no motion with
its wings ; I noticed this especially when a bird of this species shot past
'me with closed wings down the mountain side.
In colour both sexes are rich grass green, dark metallic green on
the wings, lower back and tail, there is a white mark above and below
,the eye. The head has a long upstanding crest of decomposed feathers,
green tipped with white. The flight feathers are intense carmine red,
edged with dark metallic purple. The feet are black, and the bill
crimson.
It has often been stated that the carmine pigment in the flight
feathers of the Touracous is soluble in water, but I am afraid that I
cannot believe it, for I have tried many times with the feathers of
several species, using both cold and hot water, and also different kinds
of soap and soda, but I never washed any of the colour out.
The Purple-crested Touracou (Gallirex porphyreolophus ) cannot be
* called common in the Mount Selinda district; it is found rather sparingly
in the thickly wooded districts on the lower slopes of the mountain, and
I was fortunate in seeing quite a few during the time I resided at Selinda.
These Touracous are of a tame and confiding nature, and will
&apos;come within close proximity of the homesteads, where they visit the
fruit-trees and feed upon the fruit, being especially partial to plantains
and bananas. When at rest in the trees, they look very inconspicuous,
- their brilliant colouring seeming to tone down and harmonize with the
surrounding foliage ; they then look like large grey Pigeons, the crest
being depressed and the bird sitting close up to the trunk of the tree,
but in spite of their apparently lethargic attitude, their brilliant eye
is always fixed upon one.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Mount Selinda
They live principally upon a certain kind of wild fig, which grows
in great clusters upon the trunks of the tree, and in the vicinity of one
of these trees one is almost sure to find a pair of these birds.
The cry is rather pleasing, and is totally different to that made by J
the Livingstone&apos;s Touracou. It wanders about the country in pairs,
and is not migratory like the latter bird.
If the weather is very wet, these birds seem to be incapable of
sustained flight, for the natives sometimes capture them by chasing
them from tree to tree until they fall exhausted to the ground.
A young bird of this species was captured in this manner by the
natives, and kept for me by some friends. " Charlie " was his name, and
a most charming pet he made, he was fed upon fruit and cake, and in
time became exceedingly tame, but unfortunately one night a wild cat
attacked him, and tore half the lower mandible off, we fed him on soft
food for a time, but he lingered a few days and died.
In colour these birds are dark rich metallic green on the lores, eye-
brows, and on the frontal band, the long loose crest is brilliant purple,
under the lower mandible is a patch of metallic blue. The throat and |
breast are green with a pinkish bloom, the rest of the under parts are
slate grey, the back of the head, the whole of the upper parts, and the
tail either brilliant metallic purple or grey according to the angle at I
which one looks at the bird, the flight feathers are brilliant carmine,
edged with brownish purple. The tail-coverts are dark purple. The
legs, feet, and beak are black, the eyelids are edged with bright pink.
Both sexes are the same in colour.
Levaillant's Parrot (Poeocephalus robustus) is a large and handsome
Parrot, and only found at certain times of the year, especially when
the " Mahobahoba " fruit is ripe; this is a small round fruit, about
the size of a walnut, with an exceedingly sickly sweet flavour. The birds
associate either in pairs, or in small parties, and can be easily dis-
tinguished from all the other African Parrots when on the wing by the
brilliant green of the under parts and the red edging of the wings.
When flying they are extremely noisy, uttering all the time their loud
raucous shrieks.
Every morning from 7.30 to 8 a.m. they could be heard passing
over the homestead on their way from the lowlands where they roost

to the forest to feed upon certain fruits. Their shrieks can be heard
half a mile away.
j
Of an extremely wild and wary nature they will not tolerate the
presence of a human being, and consequently it is well nigh impossible
to observe them in the wild state. During their flight to and from
the forest, they frequently rest on the way in certain high trees.
It is a very easy matter to capture any number of these birds by
finding out the tree where they spend the night and then putting bird
lime on the branches on which they roost, and in this way the settlers
frequently capture large numbers ; but very few ever seem to reach
these shores.
The Crested Hawk Eagle (Lophocctus occipitalis). This very
beautiful and unique Eagle is seen but occasionally in the lowlands
around Mount Selinda, generally in pairs. It is a very conspicuous
bird when in flight owing to the black and white marking of the wings
and tail, and when in the distance I have frequently mistaken it for
one of the large Hornbills. It frequents the well-timbered and well-
watered districts, where it is to be seen sitting motionless on the top of
I some large bush or tree raising and lowering its long crest. When at
rest it appears to be quite black, but upon close examination is seen
to be of a general dark sepia brown, the wings and tail being broadly
banded with white, the cere, the gape, and the feet bright yellow, the
legs are feathered down to the toes, and the unusually large eyes are
yellow.
The Bateleur Eagle (Helotarsus ecaudatus) can be distinguished at
once from all other Eagles when on the wing, even though soaring at a
great height, by the white underwing coverts, the very short tail, the
end of which appears to be on a level with the secondary wing feathers,
and by the bright coral red cere and legs which are discernible from a
great height. When on the wing this bird is to me the grandest and
the most beautiful of all the Eagles ; the very embodiment of aerial
&apos; grace, it soars with the ease and lightness of a feather blown in the wind.
The African Buzzard Eagle (Asturinula monogrammica) resembles
at a distance a light-coloured Sparrow-hawk rather than an Eagle, it is
comparatively common in Gazaland, where it haunts the trees bordering
the rivers and larger streams, and is usually seen in pairs.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Mount Setinda
It is not at all shy, and will allow one to approach within a few yards.
It is a pretty and inoffensive little bird, and seldom if ever preys upon
the farmyard poultry, but it is always shot in common with the other
Hawks by the farmers.
Waterfowl are conspicuous by their absence in the district
immediately around Selinda, the reason being that even though there
is an abundance of water, the rivers and streams are extremely fast
flowing, and therefore are not conducive to an extensive bird life,
j m ean of aquatic fowl, who like swamps and broad shallow rivers
where they find an abundance of food. The only bird besides small j
Crake, etc., that I saw was the Black-headed Heron ( Ardea melano -
cevhala), a bird which resembles the Common Heron in colour, but is
larger in size and when on the wing can be distinguished by the pure
white under wing-coverts.
The Tamborine Dove ( Tympanistria bicolor) is met with usually
singly in the thick undergrowth in the forest. It is exceedingly shy
and timid, and very difficult to observe. It might easily be mistaken
for a Thrush by the casual observer as it grubs about in the dead
leaves under the bushes, for both in demeanour and colour it resembles
a bird of that family.
Occasionally I have seen it in the cultivated lands of the Kaffirs
on the edge of the forest, but even there it is very hard to observe,
flying upon the slightest provocation into the dense bush.
The Emerald-spotted Dove ( Ghalcopelia afro) is the commonest
Dove in the Selinda region except the Ked-eyed Dove, which is almost
the commonest of all the birds. It is found in small numbers in the
densely wooded kloofs, and as it usually sits motionless in the dense
vegetation it is very hard to find. It is shy and retiring, and if disturbed
in fairly open country it will fly into a tree and sit on a thick branch
close up to the trunk, and in that position is rendered almost invisible
owing to the grey colour harmonizing so well with the lichen-covered
bark.
It is a strange thing that all the Doves of Mount Selinda are so shy,
because they meet with no persecution; the Lemon Dove ( Haplopelia
larvata) is no exception, for it is the shyest of birds, and one only gets
a very fleeting glance of it as it flies away at one's approach. Upon

seeing the bird for the first time I mistook it for a Thrush, owing to
ts olive brown colouring and mode of flight.
The Lemon Dove only inhabits the parts of the forest where the
mdergrowth is the thickest, and there it can be heard walking about
m the dead leaves, but it is a hopeless task to try and watch it, for upon
die slightest sign of danger it flies up and after a short flight dives down
igain into the dense vegetation.
I once came across a bird of this species, caught in a native trap in
:he forest, it was hanging in the air by its legs, with the wings almost
ouching the ground, and in its struggles it had worn all the scales off
ts legs and the flight feathers from the wings. I brought it back to
;he homestead, where I kept it for a short time, but it eventually
lied, having I think, sustained some internal injuries when in the trap.
These Doves are practically terrestrial and only at rare intervals
jhave I seen them perch in the trees, and this was only when they were
disturbed from the ground.
At one season of the year these Doves gather together under a
pertain kind of forest tree, from which fall berries upon which they
ieed, the birds create quite a noise by grubbing about in the dead
V
eaves ; it sounds from a distance as though it were raining, often thirty
or forty birds can be seen in a space of a few square yards.
The flight is very heavy and noisy.
The East African Guinea-fowl (Numida mitrata ) is exceedingly
tiumerous on the lower slopes of the mountain, where it lives in flocks
of a dozen or more. From the terrace of the homestead, flocks could
always be seen in the old cultivated lands. Frequently these birds
indulge in a kind of play, chasing each other round and round, and
iunaping high into the air over the others backs. At night if one goes
out into the bush-veld, the number of Guinea-fowl one disturbs in the
. trees is amazing. Usually they roost in small flocks, but occasionally
1 have seen them in pairs or singly.
On one farm that I visited were some ordinary Guinea-fowl, and
eery often a flock of wild ones would join them and come right up to
the homestead. It was when the two species of birds were together
that the great difference could be seen between them, the wild species is
Bntirely black, whereas the other is grey, the spots on the feathers of

the former are much larger and more distinct, the helmet and wattles
are larger and of a different shape, also the whole neck is rich blue, and,
the wdld bird is also much slimmer in build.
I brought a bird of this species home with me, he was picked up
when a tiny chick, and we thought that he was a young Francolin, and
it was not until he began to get his spotted plumage that w T e found out
our mistake. When on board the ship he showed great character, and
proved to be a great pet, but on getting home he lost a great deal of
his tameness, and struck up a friendship with a male Impeyan Pheasant,
who had just previously murdered his wife.
The Crested Guinea Fowl (Guttera edouardi) is only found in the
deepest recesses of the forest, wdiere it is more often heard than seen.!
After the Crested Hornbill it is the noisiest of the forest birds, its cry
is very much like the noise made by the old - fashioned w ooden rattle,
which w T as used in the good old days for scaring birds and if one happens
to be in close proximity to a flock the noise is simply deafening.
Its presence can only be detected by its call 5 it is a hopeless task
to try to find it otherwise, for it only creeps about in the densest
undergrowth.
Taken voung, these birds (so I was told) make delightful pets. A lad)
living in the vicinity of Mount Selinda told me that one she hac
would follow" her about like a dog, even on long walking trips ; it alsc
kept order in the farmyard, stopping any dispute between the poultry
and seeing that the chickens' food was not eaten by the adult birds--
a truly useful acquisition to any farmyard.
This species is in my opinion by far the handsomest of the Guinea
fowd, being preferable I think even to the blue Abyssinian Guinea-fowl
The bird winders about in the forest in small parties of five to twrelve
feeding upon seeds, berries, insects, etc. When disturbed, it flies uj
into the trees, mounting from branch to branch until it gets to the top

AUSTRALIAN PARRAKEETS

Australia and its neighbouring islands are inhabited by many
splendid Parrakeets which may be divided into two groups, Polytelis
and Platycercus. The Platycerci are all birds for the aviary rather
than for the cage, and win favour by their exquisite colouring, their
power of enduring cold, their readiness to breed, and their comparatively
agreeable voices. They are quarrelsome, especially with individuals
&apos; if the same or nearly related species.
When a male and female are put together for the first time, they
must be watched ; if the male appears to be pleased with his com-
panion, or indifferent, it should be all right, but if he shows signs of
pnger and attacks her, they must be separated at once if her life is to
ibe saved, for there is little or no chance of their ever agreeing. With a
&apos;male Platycercus hatred at first sight is generally enduring except in
*ases where he still remembers the mate from whom he has been parted.
If the female gains the upper hand, they may live without serious
&apos;fighting, but there is little likelihood of their going to nest.
Although the majority, if in good condition, can stand a low tempera-
ture, broad-tailed Parrakeets are sensitive to draughts and cold
winds, and it is wise to make certain that they use their shelter, shutting
hem up in it at night, and during very bad weather. For satisfactory
&apos;breeding results a movable aviary not less than 24 feet by 8 feet by
3 feet is desirable. They will nest in much smaller aviaries of the usual
ixed type, but the young, if any are reared, are usually worthless for
dock purposes.
I. The Polytelis Parrakeets
The genus Polytelis bears some resemblance to the Palceornis
Parrakeets, in which they were included for a long time ; they are
bery fine birds, and easily kept when their requirements are understood.
They are found in Australia and some of the Oceanic Isles.
Barraband&apos;s Parrakeet (Polytelis barrabandi) inhabits east and
iouth-east Australia. The sexes can be easily distinguished. The male
s brilliant grass-green, black under the tail, the flights and rectrices
cashed with blue; forehead, cheeks, and throat golden yellow, with a

wide red stripe below the yellow of the throat ; beak red, irides yellow,
and feet pale grey. The female is a duller green, has no yellow on,
the head nor a red throat, but beneath the tail she is black and pink,
and she has red thighs. The young resemble their mother, but the
males from the first show faint indications of yellow and red where
those colours will eventually appear ; at first they have red thighs,
but these disappear as they grow older. They are about the same
size as the Ring-neck Parrakeet, and have small beaks and long pointedj
tails.
Barrabands do not scream, but their call is too piercing for indoors,
and although they will live in a cage it is a pity to shut up a bird, one
of whose chief features is its immensely powerful flight. They thrive
infinitely better in an aviary, and several pairs can be kept together,
either by themselves or with odd birds of either sex ; it is not eveD
necessary always to separate them when breeding, though a hen wil
sometimes sulk and refuse to lay if another takes possession of the
nest which she covets.
Barrabands are very ready to breed in confinement, but unless then
aviary is roomy they will only lay a few eggs and most if not all o
these will be clear. Once acclimatized they are quite hardy. Now anc
then a delicate individual may take cold, but this is the exception rathe
than the rule. The young need more protection than adults during tin
first winter, but do not usually require artificial heat.
Freshly imported specimens are liable to two troublesome diseased
The first is paralysis of the feet and legs, which may come on suddenly
The cause would seem to be too dry and heating diet after semi!
starvation caused by fear, which prevents them from eating freel;
during the voyage. Many newly caught Barrabands die in this way
and the danger is not over for two months after their landing. Escape*
individuals recaptured when tired and half-starved may suffer in th
same way unless they are fed on soaked canary seed and fruit an*
some kind of purgative is mixed with their drinking water. I do no&apos;
know a certain cure for paralysis, but cod-liver oil in their drinkin
water may do some good.
A still worse trouble among freshly imported Barrabands is a diseas
which causes swelling round the eyes, which irritates the bird, and i

&apos;time brings on weakness, blindness, and eventually death. It appears
to be contracted in the dirty travelling boxes used by the Australian
"catchers and dealers, and often makes its appearance on the voyage.
It is contagious, though not extremely so, but a diseased bird may pass
t on to another in the same aviary. It usually appears some days or
veeks after landing, but occasionally it lies dormant for months, and
i bird may even have moulted and shown a desire to nest before it
levelops.
I do not know any positive cure for this disease. If the weather
:)e fine the birds are better in an outside aviary, with perches that
&apos; ;an easily be cleaned with a non-irritant disinfectant. Everything should
3e done to improve the general health of the sufferers, and there is
'eason to hope that after a long time some of the less serious cases may
&apos;ecover completely. Birds which are badly affected are best off in
pages where they have their food close at hand.
&amp;gt;
A cock Barraband whose hen is shut up in an aviary is a delightful
oird to have at liberty, but care must be taken to ascertain that he is
'eally paired, or he may leave if he has a companion of his own sex
it liberty with him. A cock Barraband may court and even feed a hen
A T ithout being actually mated to her, but once this has taken place he
1 s the most faithful and devoted of husbands. A pair should never be
iberated together, or they will certainly be lost. Owls are to be feared,
nit it is not difficult to train a cock Barraband to return to his aviary
hrough an inward-pointing, funnel of wire netting for his evening
eed; once inside he cannot find the way out again, and will stay in
bntil he is let out the next morning.
Barrabands should be fed on canary, oats, and millet seed, with
ruit and green stuff ; some of them like mealworms. They do not
&apos;often damage shrubs in their aviary.
The Bock Peplar Parrakeet (P. mdanura ) from South and West
Vustralia, is another very beautiful species, slightly larger. The male
M yellow, deepening to olive on the head and back, the tail bluish, flights
&amp;gt;f the same colour but the lesser wing coverts are yellow, and the
greater red or black ; the mantle is olive green, beak red, feet olive

creen tail edged with pink. The young resemble the female, but the

males may be distinguished by their thicker and bolder heads. They j
also soon begin to chatter and call as they sit on a perch in a way that
hens never do.
These Parrakeets do not live long in close confinement, and suffer
from heart disease, but if allowed a spacious, movable aviary, they
do very well, and are hardier than Barrabands. They are equallv
willing to nest, but unless their aviary is really large, most of the eggs
will be clear. This species is more quarrelsome than the Barraband,
and adult pairs do not live peaceably together. The cocks can be kept
at liberty in the same way as Barrabands. The rapidity and agility
of their flight are positively astonishing, and it alone would make
them desirable even were their plumage no more ornamental than a
Crow's ! They are not hard to tame, and some have even learnt to
speak and whistle. Their food should be the same as given to the
Barrabands, with the addition of hemp and sunflower. Newly imported
birds are liable to eye disease, but I have never seen a case of paralysis
of the feet among them.
Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet (P. alexandrce ), perhaps better
known as the Princess of Wales's Parrakeet, has been removed from the
genus Polytelis by North, and placed in a separate genus, Spathopterus |
on account of the presence of spatules at the tips of the second fliglil 1
feathers. There is no doubt, however, that it is a Polytelis. Althougl!
abundant in its native place--the deserts of central and west Australia--
it has always been rare in Europe and has never been freely imported
It is one of the most beautiful and graceful of the whole family, its
colouring being exquisitely soft and harmonious.
The male of this species is slightly smaller than the Barraband, anc
has the back of the neck, the mantle, back, and flights ashy olive green|
washed with blue and yellow ; the wing coverts are pale greenislj
yellow ; the rump is pastel blue, the median rectrices golden green j
the others blue grey outside, pink inside ; the top of the head grey blue)
the face, throat, and front of the neck pink, as are also the thighs
the under parts pearly grey ; the beak bright pink, eye yellow, fee!
pinkish grey.
The hen bird is smaller, and her colours are not so bright, her head
and rump are grey rather than blue, and she lacks the curious spatule |

which the cock wears on one of his flights. This species is not as hardy
is the Barrabands and Rock Peplar and requires more protection from
the cold ; it is a good plan to shut it up at night&apos;, and watch it carefully
;n bad weather and during the moult. Acclimatized specimens can,
however, do without artificial heat.
Queen Alexandra&apos;s Parrakeets are quite ready to go to nest in an
rviary, but unless it is really spacious few eggs are laid and the male
birds are often sterile. Several adults will usually agree together, but
pairs kept by themselves in the breeding season are more likely to be
successful. They should be given the same food as the Rock Peplar,
with addition of a few mealworms, of which they are very fond. They
are particularly gentle and confiding, and will feed from their master's
hand ; they like to be noticed and spoken to, although, like many
Parrakeets, they object to being handled. They can occasionally be
taught to speak and whistle, but it is a mistake to make a pet of a cock
from whom one wishes to breed, as in all probability he will come to
prefer his master to his own mate.
The late Mr. Astley was the first to breed this species, and until
his lamented death in 1925 he kept a small flock in his aviary.
Hybrids have been obtained between Barraband and Rock Peplar,
and between Barraband and Queen Alexandra ; also between this last
and the Crimson-wing.
We now come to the genus Aprosmictus, of which the King
[&apos;
; Parrakeet is the typical representative. They are larger than the
I preceding species, with more ample wings and less pointed tails.
The genus contains several species and sub-species, but only one
is freely imported.
The King Parrakeet, A. cyanopygius, is a magnificent bird, and
t comes from South Australia. The male bird has the head, neck, and
L under parts of the body dazzling scarlet, the wings and mantle are
deep green, with a pale green stripe across the shoulders ; a spot at
[ the back of the neck, the lower back and rump are dark blue ; tail
bluish black, beak red and black ; yellow irides, feet black. The
female has a green head and neck, and her beak is blackish. The young
; of both sexes strongly resemble the adult female, but the upper mandible
j of young cocks turns red before their plumage changes. A well-defined

pale green stripe across the wing of a green-headed bird is a possible
sign of a cock, but not a certain one, as some hens also have this stripe,
though it is lacking in the majority of cases. They assume adult colour-
ing more or less after the first moult. A yellowish tinge in the red
parts of a cock bird is either a sign of illness or abnormality, and is
not, as some dealers assert, due to youth.
The King Parrakeet is hardy and easily kept, if protected from!
wind and wet, and can stand any amount of cold when once acclimatized.:
It should have the same diet as the Rock Peplar with addition of
monkey nuts and a generous allowance of mealworms. It goes to
nest readily, but clear eggs are the rule in a small aviary. The hen
may refuse to lay in the ordinary type of log or box nest; she often
prefers a very deep one something in the style of a tall clock case with
a hole near the top, where the dial would be. The box should be
lined inside with wire netting to enable the bird to climb up arid down :
a natural log of the right shape is best of all. The King will live in a
cage, and is not noisy, but kept in this way they mope and become
apathetic, and are neither happy nor interesting.
Pairs of Kings are not very satisfactory at liberty, but a cock whose
hen is kept shut up is ideal and can be strongly recommended to a
beginner. He is a good stayer, does no damage, and is too big to be
attacked by birds of prey ; he is wonderfully handsome, too, with his
fine plumage and elegant flight. He is also quite peaceable at liberty
with his own kind and sex. He may perhaps eat a few ripe apples, but
will not do serious harm in a garden. In the aviary Kings hardly
ever molest small Finches.
The Green-winged King Parrakeet (A. chloropterus) from south-
east New Guinea resembles the above, but the pale green band across
the wings and the blue spots on the nape and rump are much larger.
The hen has a green head and neck.
The Amboina King Parrakeet (A. amboinensis) has a carmine
red neck and under parts and green wings ; the back, rump, scapulars
the edges and underneath the wings deep blue ; the tail bluish black
the hen is like him, only smaller and less brightly coloured.
The Sula King Parrakeet (A. sulaensis) is smaller than the
above, the sexes are practically&amp;quot; alike. A female in my possession has

lived several years in an outside aviary and has laid and sat twice in
a year, even when unmated.
The Crimson-winged Parrakeet (Ptistes erythropterus) from north
and west Australia, is very nearly related to the King. The male is
slightly smaller than his mate, and is a very splendid satiny green, with
black mantle and scapulars ; the middle of the back is brilliant blue,
and all the wing coverts are scarlet. The beak is yellowish red ; eye
red brown, feet grey. The female has no black and has less red about
the wings.
Although it is liable to eye disease when freshly imported, like its
relative the King, and to attacks of contagious fever, the Crimson-
wing may fairly be called hardy. It goes to nest readily, has the same
requirements as the King, but it is not always easy to obtain a fertile
inale bird. Although it is one of the gaudiest and most brilliant of
Parrakeets, it must be admitted that the beauty of the male is wholly
exterior. He is quarrelsome and unfaithful. When a pair are put
together, the cock often attacks his mate, and drives her about viciously .
\0x25BASometimes, just when one is about to take her away, he will begin to
make advances, and directly afterwards they become good friends.
At times he drives her about for a month or more, and then makes up
to her, or he may never take to her at all, although they are both in
i breeding condition. They require a large aviary in order that the hen
*
can get away from the cock, and if he becomes too aggressive a few
E wing feathers may be clipped so as to limit his power of attack. If
unprovided with a " clock case &amp;quot; or deep natural nest, the hen will
sometimes prefer to lay on the bare ground sooner than use an
! ordinary log.
Though Crimson-wings may roam rather far away from their
t homes, they would really be very good birds at liberty, were it not for
their inveterate habit of going down chimneys. Every now and again
one comes across a cock who lacks this fatal curiosity, and he will
(* live out for years, to the great delight of his owner.
This species should be fed on the same mixture as the King. It
has been crossed with the King and with Queen Alexandra.
The splendidly coloured Parrakeets of the genus Pyrrhulopsis
i are natives of the Fijian Isles. Although in appearance they slightly

resemble the King, their habits are very different. They have stronger|
beaks.
The Red-shining Parrakeet (P. splendens) from Yiti Levu
and Kandavu has a carmine head and under parts ; a blue stripe on the
nape ; black and rump green ; wings blue and green ; tail blue;
iris orange ; beak and feet black. The sexes are alike. This is a delicate
species in captivity, being subject to a kind of chronic enteritis as well
as to tuberculosis and other diseases. It does better in a room or a large!
indoor aviary than in a cage, especially if it is timid, which is- sometimes
the case.
The diet should consist of canary, hemp, oats, and sunflower seeds,
along with monkey nuts and plenty of fruit.
This species utters two different calls, a soft cry and a strident scream.j
Some specimens learn to talk. I found them gentle in an aviary, but
other people complain that they are aggressive. It is said that
in its own countrv it is often tamed, and can then be left at
liberty.
The Tabuan Parrakeet (P. tabuensis) from Vanua Levu differs
from the preceding in having its head and under parts rich mahogany
purplish red ; it is occasionally imported together with an allied
species P. taviunensis from the Island of Taviuni which may be dis-J
tinguished by its smaller size and absence of blue on the nape, and
another intermediate species P. koroensis from Koro Island. These
are all very choice and fine birds.
The Masked Parrakeet (P. personata) has been practically
exterminated by Mongooses. It is green, with a black face, the middle
of the breast yellow, and the middle of the belly orange, the wings and
tail washed with blue.
I once owned a very old specimen who was allowed his liberty!
during the summer. Although he hated being handled, he was friendly
and liked sitting on one&apos;s arm or shoulder, but at times he would
viciously attack women&apos;s ankles. He was afraid of other birds, and
avoided them, but I once saw him happily feeding at the same dish with
an enormous rat ! He ate everything he could find, and drank ink,
cod liver oil, and every kind of medicine, so that it was astonishing
that he lived so long !

His only natural cry was piercing and harsh, but he made up for

We would commend to the notice of our members a very excellent
oook that has been recently published entitled Notes on the Game Birds
'if Kenya and Uganda (including the Sand-grouse, Pigeons, Snipe,
Bustards, Geese, and Ducks). It is written by Sir Frederick J. Jackson,
K.C.M.G., C.B., etc., than whom there is no one better qualified for
? such a task, for he has spent a great part of his life in East Africa and,
during more than thirty years there, has spent his spare time in the
pursuit of natural history.
Although Sir Frederick will always be remembered as a very
successful Governor of Uganda, he is perhaps better known to many
as an ornithologist, and we are very pleased to hear that he hopes
later on to be able to deal with all of the birds of Kenya and Uganda.
The present volume is published by Williams and Norgate, Ltd., at

Mrs. Prestwick kindly sends the following notes :--
The membership of the Society now numbers 433, the highest since
1910, with 444 ; the record year was 1909, with 451. The 500 mark
should be reached by the end of this year, if members will make a

The Society is now in its 33rd year, and it is pleasing to note that
f there are still six original members (October, 1894), namely, James
U&apos;ooper, H. R. Fillmer, James B. Housden, Mrs. Mortimer, W. H. St.
Quintin, and S. M. Townsend. There are seventeen members who

Sir, --I was very pleased to see your notice on the Budgerigar I
Club booklet, and should like to point out a very essential item that
Professor Duncker appears to have missed.
In colour breeding in all stock, there are two ways of producing!
new colours and shades, first by sports and selection, and second by j
crossing these shades and colours to get other shades and colours, j
From the table at the bottom of page 15, it might appear that all
the colours and shades were produced from sports or selective breeding, j
whereas Cobalt, Mauve, and Maygreen (apple-green) are produced by
crossing two or more of the other colours or shades.
About thirty years ago I produced Blue Japanese bantams and 1
have always been interested in colour breedings, and I consider this i
point should not be lost sight of.

Sir, --Although only Budgerigar episodes, perhaps the following
notes will be interesting to the members of the Avicultural Society,
All my Budgerigars are blue-bred greens from well-known strains,
and during 1925 did very well in turning up several blues and at that
time I had no blues in the aviary, but during 1926, without any
selection whatsoever (other than the birds themselves), a pair of my
own young ones of 1925 produced in their first nest one good blue,
two greens, and two white.
The white are as pure as any I have seen at the shows, the dark
markings almost eliminated and just a tinge of the palest delicate blue
on the under parts and between the wings. They are a very clean white
too, not looking like a washed-out and dirty blue, as some so-called
whites do. All my birds live summer and winter in an entirely unheated
garden aviary; there is a shelter shed attached, but that is only closed
!in on three sides, the birds fly in and out at will, and often spend the
(night on the open flight. The whites seem very hardy and bonny.
In another rather interesting nest two hens laid and nested together,
&apos;they laid eleven eggs, nine of which hatched out and were fully reared.
Two of these were good yellows, one a nice deep blue, and the other
six greens.
I have other blues, but these came from a blue pair in another
enclosure similar, the hen being one of my own from 1925 and the
\0x25A0 cock from the late Mrs. Dalton Burgess&apos;s strain, but of course, being a
blue pair not at all remarkable, but that a pair of greens should produce
whites seems worthy of comment. The whites I believe to be a pair.

ESCAPED BIRDS

Correspondence
Mr. McEuan, of Richmond House, Hayling Island, wrote a letter
in The Times on the subject last week, and has been good enough to
write to me personally in addition. He tells me that the bird was first
seen by one of the punt gunners in the neighbourhood last August,
and has since frequented Hayling Bay. It is very wild owing to the
frequent attempts which have been made to shoot it. Sir Thomas
Troubridge also writes to me from Beaulieu that a Flamingo was seen
there on the 21st September, which flew in from the east and pitched
near the mouth of the Beaulieu river, and remained for a day.
(2) Further, a Scaly-breasted Lorikeet escaped from my outdoor
aviary in September, was seen about the garden for a day or two, and
then disappeared. A naval friend of mine who was in H.M.S. Royal
Sovereign told me the other day that a bird of this description flew on
to the ship when she w T as eighty miles from land in the North Sea and
was captured, and is now safely at the home of the captain of the
ship. Unfortunately the bird was not ringed, so it is impossible to
prove anything. Owing to the rarity of the species in England, it is
extremely likely to have been my bird.

Sir,--S o far as my own experience of birds during nesting has been,
the usual proceedings have been that when a pair deserted a nest, which
they had made considerable progress with in building, and then chose
another site, that pair has deserted the original nest finally and for
the rest of the season. But last year a pair of Robins acted differently
in that they started early in March to build a nest in a shed in the
garden, where several bits of netting were stored up, some placed
against the wall; and soon a large collection of dead leaves, about
15 inches long, were placed on top of a heap of netting, just where it
touched the wall. Now as Robins will build in all sorts of peculiar places,
there was nothing unusual in such position, nor in the fact that as the
nest got disturbed (by the netting being later accidentally moved a
little by a man) the Robins retired from it and started a second nest

mtside the shed, this second nest being in a hedge several
/ards away.
Then came what seems to me the peculiar p&apos;art of their behaviour.
Vfter working for about ten days in this second building, where they
vere undisturbed and collected a mass of leaves larger than a coconut
--during which time they were never seen to re-enter the shed above
mentioned--they suddenly, one day, both re-entered the shed, and
I&apos;jegan again to work at the original nest, where they soon reared a
brood (all of which flew in safety). There was no doubt that it was the
same pair of birds ; and nothing was added to the second collection
pf leaves in the hedge after the day when the pair returned to the shed.

Sir, --It may be of interest to our members to hear of a lighting
arrangement that I have adopted for one of my aviaries, and which is
giving every satisfaction. I have a six-volt 60 amp. accumulator
(the bigger the amperage the better) and a small Osram lamp and an
slectric timing clock such as is advertised for wireless. I set the clock
to light up at 5.30 a.m., and to shut off at 8 a.m. The birds are busy
feeding by 6 a.m., and can continue to do so, for when the light shuts
&amp;quot;off it is daylight. The clock can be set to any time that is required,
but I have found the above times very suitable for breeding Budgerigars
luring the long nights.

larger than the house-fly, enters many country houses in autumn in
very large numbers for the purpose of hibernation, and is easily captured;
on windows. There is no difficulty in keeping it alive until the spring if
it be confined in a place which is sunny, but not too hot, and be supplied
with moisture and a little sugar. Water is an absolute necessity to the
flies, and must be provided in a way which will ensure their finding it
without drowning themselves.
Being a perfectly clean feeder, the cluster fly is not unpleasant to
keep and handle, and should be a wholesome food for delicate birds.

 |For many years I had had a great desire to see this bird alive, and
intended when an opportunity came, to make an expedition to its island
j lome and be the first to introduce it to Europe, but the war and other
f hin S s intervened, and my hopes were not fulfilled until 1926. It is
I ertainly not one of the most beautiful members of this gorgeous family,
&amp;gt;ut there was always something about its eccentric appearance which
ippealed to me irresistibly, and now that I have succeeded in capturing
aid safely landing over here five examples, I confess that far from being
disappointed, I am more in love with it than ever. In fact, I may as
 |^ ell say at once, that of all the Paradise Birds I know so far, this is my
j avou rite. Therefore, if I seem to some who have now seen it to be too
mthusiastic, they must excuse me. At the same time I am sure that
nybody who has kept one as long as I have will understand my
lfatuation for it. Their tameness, inquisitiveness, and merry ways,
ould not fail to appeal to everyone. They seem entirely without fear,
na this applies to them equally in their native jungle. They take an
itelligent interest in all one does, and at the same time keep up a
lerry chatter ; in fact, their repertoire of notes is extraordinary,

sometimes reminding one of our English Starling on the chimney
stacks, bubbling, gurgling, and producing occasional explosive sound
which shake their whole body. Other notes are reminiscent of th-
King, and still others of the Rifle Bird.
Wallace first discovered the bird in the fifties of last century on th
island of Batchian, or, to write it more correctly, Batjan, one of th
Moluccan islands \ perhaps the most beautiful of them all. Havni
been almost all over the globe, I think I can say that these islands ar
the most exquisite in all this world of ours. Later, it was found to occu
also on the much larger neighbouring island of Halmaheira, or as w
write it on our maps, Gilolo ; although Gilolo (or, rather, Djailolo) i
only a small town on the western side, nearly opposite to the bette
known island of Ternate. My birds came from Halmaheira and belon
to the sub-species hahnaherce, which has longer shoulder plumes tha
those from Batjan, and a more metallic violet shade on the top (
the head.
Perhaps, apart from the wonderful emerald green, resembling ric
silk, of the elongated breast shield, the first thing to strike one about tt
bird, is its long flat head, which gives it a rather reptilian appearance
In spite of this flatness, the bird is by no means stupid, quite tl
contrary. The two long feathers which spring from each shoulder, ari;
from two horny sheaths and are elongated spatula, whitisb towards tl
ends. These when at rest hang straight down towards the feet, but win
the bird is excited, and even at other times, stand out at right angl
to the body with a wild-Indian-like effect.
I had always understood the Malay name for the bird was Buroi
poelet ", the Epaulet Bird, but on Batjan I failed to find anyone wl
knew it. The island has only a very small population, including fr
whites, and is everywhere covered with dense virgin jungle, right
the top of the mountains ; the most conspicuous peak being Goenoi
Zibella. Failing to find anyone there to give me information about tl
bird, I continued on up to Ternate, where reside many merchants
the Paradise plume trade. Still among them I found only one who kne
the " Burong poelet " by name only. He said he must have had sor
of the skins, although he could not recall what they were like, and
believed they came from Patani, South-East Halmaheira. So to Pata

booked by the first monthly boat, and so elusive did the bird seem, it
v r as like chasing a will-o'-the-wisp. Everywhere I inquired, all told the
ame tale, " No Birds of Paradise were found on the island." At length
o &amp;gt;
rhen calling at Tobello on the north coast, where the Dutch have a
nilitary post, I came across a man who had been a plume hunter in
\ew Guinea. He knew the bird and correctly described it. From him
learnt that the local name was u Vecca-vecca " (nearly all birds'
tames are doubled out there), that he had seen a few occasionally in the
ungle, knew nothing whatever of their habits, and thought it would be
er &amp;gt; difficult to catch them alive. As this information did not seem very
iromising, I thought it best to continue the journey to Patani, several
lays further on.
We arrived at Patani early one morning, and I was quickly on shore,
aving left all my baggage and stores on board until I had made further
nquiries. I went to the house of the " Kampong Kapala ", or head
nan, who seemed very surprised when I told him what I was searching
or. Oh yes," he said in Malay, " you mean the Whicca-wacca, there
re many here. Naturally I took this to be the local pronunciation of
^ acca-\ ecca up north, so hurried back to the boat and landed all
ay gear. About an hour later the boat having already left, and as I
.as arranging myself in a native house, I received a visit from several

rows. Vainly I tried many times later to make them understand the
&amp;gt;ird I wanted, minutely describing it. At length I made a fairly good
ketch of one, when one old man present exclaimed " the Burong
&apos;let" (but sometimes they pronounced it " Pleti "). Hunters from
idore had been there years before and shot some. Still I.could not
ear how far away I should have to go to find them ; therefore I
ngaged several men to go in different directions to try and locate them,

of them went at all, but others did report the results of their searcl
I learnt that at one place five birds had been seen, and in anothe
three or four, but what I wanted them most to find were the feedin
trees, or dancing places, otherwise I did not see how I could calc
them. In this I had no success. One morning at daybreak I started o
with the men, when after a four hours' scramble and climb over shar!
coral trails, tumbling repeatedly, cutting hands and feet, we at lend
came to rather high jungle where at last I did see three or four hire
very high up in the trees, looking very small in the distance , but thei
was no doubt about their really being Wallace's. They all had gree
breasts, and seemed to be just moving along, and were soon out of sigh
The following dav I visited another locality in the opposite directioi
with still worse luck, for we did not see even one bird, but finding
small palm leaf shelter there I got my Indian boy to stop the nigl
there with one man to see if they could come across any in the vei
early morning, the distance from Patani being too great to get the]
early enough when the birds might be about. When he returned tl
next day he informed me he had seen one or two birds, but could nt
find any feeding trees. Things remained in this unsatisfactory state f(
a long time. The people lost all interest, and evidently had no knowledi
how to catch birds, and in vain I tried to enlist their help. These peop
are not jungle folks, but purely coast dwellers, cultivating little beyor
coco-nuts, and feeding chiefly on sago and fish. The whole of the interim
of the island seems to be uninhabited by any tribes.
During this time I was not idle myself, and as far as I could, withoi
a guide or trails to follow up, I made many short journeys to the jungl
clad hills at the back, till all mv shoe leather was worn through on tl
sharp outcrop of coral which one encounters everywhere. My body at
ached with rheumatism all over, through being constantly wet, ai
sometimes sleeping out all night in the rain.
By the beginning of the third week I think I had abandoned i
hope of ever getting Wallace's Standard Wing ; then one night a nu
came to me mysteriously, and said he knew a place where tin
abounded. How man}? - did I want, and what would I pay for them ? et(
etc. All this sounded too good to be true, especially as he was n
willing to take me along with him. Then another week, and still i

f Insular Lories ( Eos insularis) and their young one, caught on the
est; four Sun Birds, and a good number of Three-coloured Parrot
&apos;inches ( Erythrura trichroa). This was the sum total of my collection,

nd I naturally wanted to get home before the cold weather set in over
ere. Then the man I have mentioned turned up again. He said the
irds were still there, but he could not catch them, so came to enlist
ly help. I arranged to go with him early the next morning, and he
isisted that we must start before daylight, so that the villagers should
ot see the way we went. Before daybreak we were off ; the party
insisting of the man and his young son, myself and my Indian servant,

* ;raight, and with few branches, and these quite short; very little
ndergrowth, in some places none at all. Perhaps after being dis-
f ppointed so many times, my surprise may be imagined when I saw in
unparatively low trees at the very least thirty Wallace's Birds. I
&apos;ally could hardly believe my eyes, and out of all this number possibly
3t more than two females, or birds in brown plumage. The others

pemed to be all fully adult males. My guide had certainly done his
\0x25A0 3st to catch them. He must have put up scores of limed twigs, some
sing long tapering bamboos 20 or more feet long, with lime on
le extreme ends. This bird-lime is made out of the sap of the bread-

i the present case I think it had been badly prepared, as he said

\0x25A0nstantly on the move, flying backwards and forwards from tree to

movements, and emphasizes a habit they had of clinging to tree trunks
after the manner of Woodpeckers. I think from his description I had
always imagined this was a common habit of theirs, therefore I was
looking for it, but never once saw them do it. I can quite believe,
however, that they may do so, for even in a cage they are constantly
hanging upside-down, turning round and round the perch, and assuming
all manner of queer attitudes. Wallace also says : " The females and
young males far outnumbered the fully plumaged birds, which renders
it probable that the extraordinary accessory plumes are not fully
developed until the third or fourth year." This was the opposite to my
experience, for I did not see one half-plumaged bird among any I cann
across. It may be that the females were away nesting during June anc
July, and that the one or two entirely brown birds which I took to be
females were really young males.
Although we were plainly visible, the birds were not in the leas i
alarmed at our presence ; in fact, some came lower down to look ail
us, and one or two came within 15 feet. Neither then nor on subsequen
visits could I find any fruit-trees in the neighbourhood, and I neve
did find out what they live on. Of course, it would have been eas^
enough to have shot one to see what it had in its stomach, but thi
would have frightened them away, the very last thing I wanted to dc
Wallace, again, says " They seem to feed principally on fruit, bu
probably take insects occasionally My experience now is that the;;
are very insectivorous, and certainly prefer green-coloured insects, wit
a pronounced partiality for the large soft-bodied grasshoppers, near];
5 or 6 inches long, which live on the branches of the coco-nut palim i
It was a lesson in anatomy to watch the expert way they dissecte&lt; I
these insects, and also the large tropical cockroaches. These preference
were, of course, noted in the early days of their captivity. The
naturally change later.
Looking at the birds from below, in the jungle, they appeared to b
so very light in colour, almost white. The under sides of the wings ai
whitish, but I don't think that accounted for it all. After we had caugh
the first bird, the man remarked : " There must be two kinds, for th
others are white." I saw some of the birds with their green breasl
shields elevated, not horizontally, but perpendicularly, so that the hea j

nly is seen looking through at the deep V-shaped base of green feathers,
t this time the long shoulder plumes stand out at right angles below
he shield. These whitish plumes are constantly raised and depressed,
&apos;he short scalelike feathers on the top of the head, which are silvery
nrple, also seem to undulate with a curious effect. Of course, this I
nly noticed in captivity, as it requires a certain position of the head to
how it off, otherwise this colour effect is not even suspected.
As I have before said, I was always looking for their dancing places
i the jungle, but I now feel certain that these low trees formed a dancing
lace, and what I saw there, the display, otherwise why did they frequent
,!; more than any other spot, for it certainly was not their feeding
round ? I spent the remainder of the first day at this place and noticed
hat at midday all the birds disappeared. A few, I believe, remained
n the dense top of one of the great trees near by, and came out again
&lt;or a short time later in the afternoon. It did not take me long to note
hat certain trees were more frequented than others, so the next day
ve started to put up the nets. The trees were far too slender to allow
I anyone but a very light person climbing them, so I sent my Indian
"oy up. As he was arranging the first net one bird came within
&amp;gt; yards of him to watch the proceedings and as soon as the boy came
lown it went and shook the net with its bill. I was standing at the base
&amp;gt;f the tree and at once gave it a shake, when the bird flew right into the
&apos;let, so I got my first Wallace, and this is the bird now in the Zoo.
t was so inextricably entangled, the whole net had to be taken down
v ith the bird in it. As the boy was coming down with it its screams
nought all the other birds around, and I am sure if I had then had all
he other nets up my scoop would have been a large one. This habit of
oming to a companion in distress is not, of course, peculiar
o Paradise Birds, but I have many times seen plume hunters in the
Vu Islands and in New Guinea take advantage of this and deliberately
round a bird and keep it tied up out of sight under a dancing tree
\0x25A0 or its cries to attract the other birds, so that they could more easily
hoot them.
After catching the first bird there was great excitement in the
yillage. Men, women, and children crowded around my house en masse,
oossibly thinking it would be on public view. Needless to say, they were

sadly disappointed. Advice was freely given as to what I should, and
should not, feed it on, and this from people who had not only nevei
seen the bird before, but did not even know such a bird inhabited theii I
island. Many were now anxious to try their hands at bird catching,
tempted by the reward I had given to the man who showed me the
place, and all sorts of ruses had to be adopted to avoid giving the
locality away. Others were curious to know how I, a foreigner, knew
these birds lived there. As one man said : "We don't know the birds
in your country."
This last week of my stay was unfortunately very wet, and during
rain or dull weather no birds came out at all. This further convinces
me that I had found a real dancing place ; but with one ray of sunshine, i
birds suddenly appeared from somewhere, and at such times during the
remainder of the week, we managed to secure four more birds, three!
males and one female. I was at first very doubtful if such restless birds
would take kindly to cage life, especially in comparatively small
travelling cages. All fears, however, were soon set at rest by the birds
feeding at once, and showing no signs of fear whatever. They greedily \0x25A0
snatched green grasshoppers from my fingers the first day.
When the boat came to fetch me away the weather was so bad that
it was quite impossible for the ship's launch to get through the raging
surf, although several attempts were made to do so. A native in his
catamaran managed to reach the ship, and by him the captain sent me!
a note to say that if I could manage to get over the mountains to the j
other side of the peninsular, he would pick me up there. In spite of
the pouring rain, I had instantly to hunt up men to carry all my kit
over ; no light task, and after endless trouble I got some forty carriers, j
the bulk of them being anything but volunteers. Cases had to he
hurriedly broken open and the contents distributed almost anyhow
among them, for so steep are the mountains that not even moderately
bulky packages can be carried over. The journey took about four hours!
in almost continuous rain, and water poured down the steep trail like
a waterfall. Two of my birds had been caged less than twenty-four
hours, and yet they came through it all in perfect condition. That is j
the great charm about Wallace's Birds, their tameness and good sense
makes them ideal birds to move about. When crossing the range

several times heard others calling in the jungle, and at these places
noticed an abundance of wild nutmeg trees growing, which inclines
! ae to think that they may feed on this fruit. In New Guinea I have
ound the Eaggianas and Kifle Birds very fond of it. They swallow
he nut whole with the lacelike mace encircling it. After the latter is
digested the nut is ejected.
Without counting any Bower Birds, this makes twenty-two species
&amp;gt;f Paradise Birds that have been in captivity over here ; while no other
ountry has yet had even half that number. I have brought twenty
pecies, and seventeen of them for the first time. I have counted in this
lumber only two species of Manucodes, although I am sure we have
had more.

Nine of these birds were obtained, some from Mr. Carl Hagenbeck
i nd some from Mr. Falzfield, between 1911 and 1913. They showed no
igns of nesting until July of 1926. One of the birds was then missed,
md on search being made was found sitting on six eggs. The eggs were
hfted and put under a hen. Four goslings were hatched, one of which
died after three days. Another nest of six eggs was found, all of which
pad been destroyed. This probably accounted for a single egg which
E as found a week later and proved fertile. The eggs were removed
\0x25A0om the hen and put in an incubator to hatch out to avoid the danger of
le hen killing the young birds by trampling upon them. The period
&amp;gt;f incubation was twenty-five days. The young birds were put in a foster-
nother on a grass lawn. They were a dull grey brown all over when in
lown x except the face, which was dark brown. They did well, feeding
pn grass only. In six weeks' time they showed a good deal of colour
i &amp;gt;n their feathers, and by the end of September were in full plumage
j is regards colour and markings.
At this day, 17th January, all survive.

by Mr. H. L. Popham at the foot of cliffs, the clutches consisting of
from seven to nine creamy white eggs. It migrates south in winter
to the southern shores of the Caspian and even as far as the northern
portions of Africa. It occasionally wanders to the British Isles,
to Sweden, Denmark, Northern Germany, Holland, and France.
That it was known to the ancient Egyptians is proved by the picture
known as " The Geese of Medum ", for a photograph of which I am
indebted to my friend, Mr. F. L. Berney, who when sending it wrote
as follows : " The photo is of what is said to be the oldest picture in the
world. The age is early fourth dynasty, say, 3,000 years b.c. Found in
a chamber tomb at Medum on the Nile, where it formed part of the wall
decoration. The birds depicted are, first and last, Anser cinereus,
first pair Anser albifrons, second pair Branta ruficollis. It is pleasant
to think that in those far-off times there must have been
ornithologists and painters of birds, Thorburns and Keulemans.
Wealthy Egyptians of those days had the walls of their tombs decorated
with scenes such as had interested them during life, their work, their
hobbies, pastimes, and so on ; and the owner of the tomb was evidently
one who took pleasure in watching the rare and interesting birds he
kept in captivity. When one realizes that the painting is nearly
5,000 years old it has to be acknowledged that it is a wonderful piece of
work." The Bed-breasted Goose is very rare in living collections at
the present day, and a female received by the Zoological Society in
1858 appears to have been the only example that that institution has
possessed. The breeding of the species at Woburn is an event of very
great interest.-- Ed.]

otal this year being seven. Some of these have been disposed of. A
ufficient breeding stock has been retained, but an infusion of new blood
vould be an advantage. These birds roost out summer and winter on
arge trees in the park. It is an interesting fact that, about a year ago
he birds abandoned their favourite perch, and took to an adjoining
ree. About a fortnight later the original tree, which had shown signs
)f decay about the roots, broke off short and fell to the ground. It
ooks as though the birds had some feeling that all was not well with it.
Red Junglefowl, of which I received a trio from Rangoon a few years
igo, do very well here, and a considerable number of young has been
liatched. They are " as hard as nails ", and give no trouble. The hens
batch their own eggs and are excellent mothers. This year they got
little encouragement and only eight were reared, though a large number
of eggs was laid.
Pheasants have been rather disappointing, only five Golden, ten
Silver, and six Amherst having been reared. Reeves were a blank,
one adverse factor having been an inveterate egg-eating hen ! By
accident two Amherst-Golden hybrids have also been obtained. I
am still hoping to get, at some future time, eggs from a nice pair of
Monaul Pheasants, though these, I understand, are likely to be few and
far between. The only other species represented here at present is the
Crestless Fireback, of which two odd hens are in residence.
Ducks, which comprise Japanese Teal, Pintail, White-faced
Whistling Tree Ducks, an odd Widgeon, Mandarin, Carolina, and
Yellow Bills, have not done much, there being only four young each
from the two last named. The Yellow Bills have had a few young in
previous seasons.
A very interesting acquisition to the collection arrived from
I Wellington, New Zealand, recently, in the shape of a pair of " Pukekos '
or " Swamp Hens ". These are Blue Rails native to that country and
with their glossy black-green backs and indigo blue breasts they are
very attractive looking birds. It should be possible, given more natural
surroundings, to breed these birds, but as they are confined meantime
in an ordinary Pheasant run there is little prospect of doing so. I am
rather loth to turn them into the Waders' aviary, where they would find
water and a considerable amount of rough cover, as I fear they would

make short work of the contents of any small Finch nests that might
be built in the bushes. These birds appear quite healthy, but do not
relish frosty weather much.
As might be expected, there are no results to report from Waders
though some excitement was occasioned in the spring when a Knot
was seen squatting in a hollow beneath a grass tuft. It may have beer
broody, but no further developments took place. Each year some ot
these birds assume the full breeding plumage.
The small Finch fry flying in the Waders' aviary never seem to have
much luck with their numerous nests. Two or three broods of Zebra
Finches were, however, hatched in boxes, and two or three young
Waxbills also appeared. Most, if not all, of these seem to have died out
While the above results may seem meagre, some very interesting
hybrids have been hatched in addition to the Pheasants already
mentioned. From a Vulturine Guinea Fowl cock and a Common Guinea
Fowl hen fifteen eggs were obtained and hatched by various foster-
mothers. The hen, it may be mentioned, is itself a curiosity, it being a
pale lavender-coloured " freak " bred here from ordinary coloured stock
The young " favour " the male in their first plumage. The Vulturine
in common with his progeny, seemed hardly hardy enough for this
climate, and he unfortunately succumbed after a frosty night.
Another interesting cross was obtained from cock Red Junglefow&apos;
and a common hen Pheasant, which for want of other accommodatior
was turned down with them. There was a considerable overplus oi
young cocks in the pen at the time, which fact no doubt favoured tin
fertilization of the Pheasant's eggs. A last year&apos;s bird of this crosf
(unfortunately a hen) is now a very robust bird. It is even larger thar
its mother, which it generally resembles, though the brown body coloiu
is considerablv richer or redder. The head and neck are black. Thert
J
are two young this year from this mating, one of which I am in hopee
may turn out to be a cock. Has anyone heard of this cross before ?
A most interesting hybrid, which I believe is undoubtedly the first
of its kind, was obtained in the Waders&apos; aviary. Amongst the
miscellaneous Finch oddments was a large Yellow and Black Grosbeak,
said to be from South America. It was described as a " Giant Yellow-
bellied Grosbeak &amp;quot;. There was also an odd green Cardinal hen which

ad lost its mate. This bird was seen to be carrying food, but for a
ime it was only observed to be assisting a hen Blackbird, attending to
:s Grey-winged Ousel hybrid progeny. One day, however, the Cardinal
ras seen, after visiting the Blackbird's nest, to pop into an adjoining
ompartment. From its actions it appeared to be feeding there also,
nd when the Grosbeak was seen to lend a helping hand from time to
ime it was surmised that something out of the common was happening.
It may be explained that the nests were situated right on top of the
fall in the shelter, much too high up for any inspection.) In due course
"ne young hybrid Blackbird flew from the first nest, and some days after
young bird from the second nest was found on the floor in the shelter,
t had apparently made rather a premature departure from its home, as
t was little more than half-fledged and quite unable to fly. It was well
ooked after by its parents, however, the cock bird particularly, which
:ept continually packing it with food. It soon acquired sufficient
*strength to clamber about the bushes and finally to fly strongly about
he aviary, where it quickly developed into a strong, bold bird. It
considerably resembled a Cardinal in dull plumage, but had a larger
leak, intermediate in size between those of its parents. It eventually
lecame pretty much the " boss " in the aviary, from which it appears
ikely that it was a cock. It is very much to be regretted that one has
low to speak of this interesting bird in the past tense. It was picked
lip dead early in January. It may have fallen foul of its male parent,
which bird was showing signs of coming into breeding condition, and
had been standing up to its precocious offspring more boldly ! Most
unfortunately the body of the young bird was too much damaged by
mice to make the skin worth preserving.

Amongst the very interesting consignment of African birds recently
imported by Messrs. Gamage, Ltd., were several examples of the little
Rail (Limnocorax niger). In their printed list, which was sent to many
members of the Avicultural Society, these birds were classed as new to
Aviculture. But I brought one back alive from East Africa in 1908,
and Monsieur Delacour had two in his aviaries at Cleres six years ago ;

this pair he gave to me and I still have one of them in the best of health
the other escaped soon after it came here, and was never seen again.
The bird I have at present is a hen, and has laid single egg
on two occasions, making a nest of broken pieces of rush, clos
to the pool of water in its aviary ; needless to say that they dii
not hatch, though the old bird sat assiduously. But now that severa
have come over, there should be no difficulty in breeding this charmin;
little species. With me it is quite hardy, which one would expect, a
certainly in some parts of Africa it lives at a considerable elevation
where the nights are very cold. I have seen it at various places in Eas
Africa; on Lake Naivasha it was abundant, and much less secretive ii
its habits than the Rails generally are, differing much in this respec
from its big cousin, the Green-headed Porphyrio, which was equally
common on Naivasha, but seldom observed owing to its skulking habits
The Black Rails ran freely about on the leaves of the blue water-lilie
in company with Jacanas. I sometimes caught them in traps baitec
with cheese, set for small mammals, and once I dislodged one from ;
large Weaver Bird's nest, built in tall reeds hanging over the watei
In the streams and rivers they did not appear to be so common, althoug]
Crakes of other species were obtained ; probably the Black Rail prefer
a wider expanse of water.
I find mine are great vegetable feeders, and probably require
considerable amount of green food.

e line of a hedge. Then a large wood of beech trees, laid across
ie ridge, like a great mantle thrown over one shoulder of the landscape,
id a chalk-pit set at its foot; which, facing west, at sundown becomes
led with rose colour. This is the Rooky wood, which gives shelter
&amp;gt; a large community ; and it was from this wood Rookster came to us.
One of my children who, when very young, had the pretty idea
lat it was customary on one's own birthday to give presents to others,
rought him to me as a gift. With the candour of childhood that
*nders it unable to keep a secret, he had spoken daily of this surprise
&amp;gt;r some time before the right date fell. " It isn&apos;t out of a shop, you
now," he would say, a silken head nodding wisely : It is nothing
lat you can buy." Then, with a sudden largesse of confidence, with
oth hands tightly squeezed the better to keep back a part, at least,
f the previous news : It is something that God is making nicer
nd nicer for you, every day ! " This meant that Reuben, the garden
oy, had said that the rook was as yet too young to be taken ; and so
nother week would have to be passed in this struggle for silence.
Then one morning the day arrived. I saw them coming from
ar off across the open valley, threading their way by the narrow plank
widges set over the runlets and glittering streams that feed the water
tieadows, brilliant with marsh marigold. There was the tall figure of
he nursery maid, the small figure in a blue overall, Reuben, stout in
orduroy, with a ladder, and--when they were nearer--the young Rook.
He was easy enough to rear. He would take large pieces of milk-
op, thin shreds of meat, soaked biscuit, anything ; and soon he was
itting comfortably enough on the edge of his wastepaper basket,
hat was weighted against overturning by containing a large flint.
He was crafty from the first. He would be intrigued by the clefts
)etween the closed fingers of my hand, and he would prise them apart
vith an investigating bill, and an air of great secrecy. Anything slightly
lidden or an outline suggesting concealment would hold his attention
it once. As he grew older this led to trouble, for he was more destructive
han a Jackdaw, and, if not cleverer, more alert than a Raven. "To
loard," this was his motto ; and he remained as thin as a bone, because
mything that he liked eating, he immediately hid. He would take the
&apos;Smallest portion, and then in a series of long elastic leaps or a sidling

walk, he would be off with the remainder. So his whole life was o
long-drawn-out starvation, enhanced by delicious concealments, a
crafty storings in garden cupboards. If no further food had be
forthcoming, would he, I wonder, have remembered where he had hidd
those bones ? The pleasantest part of his character was his sense
companionship. This led him not only to occupy himself ceaseless
with our feet, shoe leather presenting pleasant beak-work, but a]
to accompany us on a walk. He was never shut into a cage. His ca
was what all cages should be, a place of rest and security wherein
could sleep, or find food, or drink if he wanted. So he would sudden
appear in the air beside us, as we started on a walk ; he would J
about eight feet above the ground, alighting ahead of us. There
would sit till we reached him, then he would take another flight, ai
so on, about twenty or thirty feet away. He always flew on our le
But after a certain distance the territory instinct arrested him--
did not care to go far from the house. This is curious when one conside
how far afield are the flights of the wild Rooks.
He was mischievous, and more inquisitive than Fatima. He nev

This is what intrigued him. The edge of a rug which could be easi
lifted was a matter for peering investigation. He took great trout
to undo one&apos;s shoelaces, he would even unlace a shoe. Thus he passi
his life in ceaseless investigation, and when he died it was from eatii
what even his powerful gizzard found indigestible. He had stolen
pin-cushion from one of the bedrooms, and, taking it to pieces, had mai
too light of the pins.
I would never have another Rook ; not from sentiment, except
so far as sentiment means right feeling, but because Rooks are mo
beautiful in their setting of wild life, in their own environment. Her
on Salisbury Plain, they are seen to great advantage ; large numbe

A very interesting account of an interview with a bird and anima
dealer, Mr. Foglia, of Adelaide, appeared in the Adelaide Registe
of 20th November last.
Mr. Foglia had just returned from a collecting trip to the Kimberle}
district, in the far north of Western Australia, -where bird life appear,
to be exceedingly abundant, but where occasional seasons of drough
result in great mortality :--
" As far as bird life is concerned in those parts, he said, an abundanct
of feed and water had resulted in remarkable increases in the bircj
population, including the larger types, such as Ibis, Native Companions
Turkeys, Geese, and Ducks ; and the area could only be described as
' Nature's sanctuary '. Untouched by the ravages of the white man foi
the greater part of the year, the Kimberleys especially had become theii
natural feeding ground. Mr. Foglia said he had been in other parts oi
Australia, but he had never had any idea of the extent of bird life
existent there. It was amazing, and he could not understand, after a

&amp;gt;nvinced one that there was little need for a policy of protection along

ere drop in the ocean ; but there was now the danger of an epidemic

II. The PLATYCERCINiE
Besides certain anatomical distinctions the Platycercinse are
^cognizable by their short beaks which may be light or dark grey,
at never red, their longish legs and long broad tails. The genus is
eculiar to Australia and Tasmania.
The Rosella Parrakeet (Platycercus eximius), from South-East
tid South-West Australia is the best known member of its genus, and
ne of the most beautiful. Its cheeks are white, its head, neck, and
reast and the feathers under the tail are red ; its belly is yellow, and
ie mantle greenish yellow, every feather having a black centre ;
ings blue and black ; rump and back green ; tail blue and green ;
, eak whitish ; feet grey ; eyes brown. It is the same size as the Ring-
ecked Parrakeet. The sexes are very much alike, but the male is a
rifle bigger and brighter coloured, with a thicker head and larger beak ;

the most reliable distinction lies in the colouring of the little feather
at the back of the eye ; they are brownish green in the normal adul
female, while in the adult male they are invariably red. Most female
have their flights spotted with white, and there is a green bar from th
back of the neck to the centre of the head ; these two latter feature
are rarely found among adult males, though immature specimens ma;
display them.
The young on leaving the nest resemble their parents, but the re&lt;
covers a smaller area, and all the colours are paler and the black mark
less distinct. The full colouring appears gradually, and is complete
after the first moult. If kept in a large aviary and well cared for Rosella!
may breed when a year old, but more often do not nest until th
following season. This applies also to the whole family of Platycen
and Barnardii. Rosellas, like all the family, are quarrelsome when paire
and in good condition, single and weakly birds are less spiteful. The
specially dislike their own and closely allied kinds, but are dangerou
with all weaker Parrakeets; they will not usually molest small Passerin
birds as long as these keep out of the way, unless the aviary is over
crowded. Rosellas should be fed on a mixture of two parts of Canar
to one of hemp, one of millet, one of sunflower seed, and one of oat:
together with monkey nuts ; they require green food and fruit
preferring apples, cherries, and gooseberries. They do not care fc
grapes or oranges, which are liked by the Palseornis. Groundsel, chick
weed, sprouting oats, flowering grass, and lettuce are all acceptable
and they love a fresh branch of some non-poisonous tree, of which the
will eat the buds and nibble the bark.
Rosellas are fond of bathing and should never be without watei
They are perfectly hardy once they have moulted, and can be wintere
out of doors if they have protection from rain and wind. Mos
Platycerci are stupid about using their shelter and often will 11 c
enter it, and prefer to freeze outside: they must therefore b
accustomed to their shelter by being shut into it for some days at tli
start by being fed there. It is also wise to shut them up every nighl
Young birds of the year need more protection than adults.

aced in a fixed aviary, with a cement floor. They are long-lived if
ven room to use their wings even in a small aviary, but it is cruel to
mt them up in a cage, and under these conditions few survive longer
lan two or three years. A large aviary is needed if they are to breed
itisfactorily, for if confined in a small space they often rear only sickly
r crippled young ones. Hollow logs or boxes make good nests for
lem, but there should be at least two for each pair, as the hen often
,ys a second time before the first family is fledged, the male parent
iking entire charge of the latter. If the hen bird has to wait until the
rst brood have flown she may pluck them in the nest, or she may herself
:art moulting, in which case all hope of a second brood is lost. There is
o fear that the father will neglect his youngsters. The young must be
sparated from the old birds as soon as the male begins to grow
npatient with them and drives them off. The usual clutch is from four
Jo six eggs.
Rosellas cross freely with allied species, and the hybrids are generally
srtile.
The Yellow-Mantled Parrakeet (P. splendidus), described by
Jould as a distinct species, is really only a local variety of Rosella, and
s even prettier and more brilliantly coloured. The edges of the feathers
I its mantle are golden yellow, with little or no green tinge. It is rarely
mported, and I have only seen four cocks and one hen alive.
A cock Platycercus whose hen is shut up can be safely given his
reedom and will not go farther than half a mile from her aviary,
le may bite off some fruit buds in spring and nibble apples m the
iutumn, but he will not do much mischief, and it is easy to shut him up
or a few weeks when necessary.
The Platycerci will breed at liberty, but pairs are sometimes inclined
o wander and nothing smaller than a cock Rosella is safe from the
I ittacks of the Tawny Owl, who is the worst enemy of exotic birds which
\0x25A0lave been set at liberty, and is the cause of many mishaps. If it is
 |lesired to set a pair at liberty it is wise to wait until they have bred
mce in an aviary. The cock should then be let out on a calm evening,
somewhere where he can see and hear the hen and where he will not be
ifraid to come down and visit her ; his food should be placed on the
\0x25A0 3op of the aviary. Some days later the hen can be released, also in the

evening, taking particular care that she sees her mate as soon as she i;
let out. Nesting places must be put up and Starlings, which tak&lt;
possession of these, must be shot, for, strange to say, these birds cai
overcome Parrakeets, even as large as Pennants.
All Platycerci have a great fondness for exploring chimneys and mus
be prevented, as far as possible, from amusing themselves in this way
The worst danger is that a bird may come out in an uninhabited room
where it may die of hunger before it is discovered. A movable win
netting top to the chimneys will not interfere with the sweeping, an(
prevents Parrakeets from entering, which they will do at all times o
year. Young birds reared at liberty must be caught up as soon as the 1 &apos;
can feed themselves, or they become too independent, take long distant
flights and annoy the neighbours by robbing their orchards.
It must not be forgotten that a pair of Platycerci are far mor*
spiteful at liberty than a cock whose hen is shut up, and more disposec
to drive away all their fellows. If a Parrakeet at liberty happens to die
if its mate is not replaced, it must be caught up at once, or it will stra^
and be lost.
Pennant's Parrakeet (P. elegans ) is decidedly larger than th-
Rosella ; it is a native of East and South Australia. Its colour is ;
fine carmine red, with pale blue cheeks, wings, and tail; the flight
and rectrices are in part blackish green. The feathers in the mantle bav
black centres. The sexes are alike, but the hen is smaller and her heat
and beak are slighter. This species ranges over a wide territory, ant
there are local varieties which vary in size and the amount of black h
their plumage. The beak is grey and white, iris brown and feet greyisl
black. When the young leave the nest they are deep green, with blm
cheeks, have a few red feathers on the throat, and some blue ones 01
the wings and tail.. The red feathers appear gradually through th&apos;
green ones during autumn and winter, and the adult plumage is com
pleted after the first moult. Young birds have been known to leave th
nest wearing the adult red plumage, but this is exceptional.
Pennants are the least quarrelsome of the large Platycerci, but thi
does not mean that they are amiable with other birds ; they ar&lt;
merely the mildest of a very quarrelsome family. They should bi
treated in the same way as Rosellas. A cock bird whose hen is shut u|

the aviary does well loose, has nothing to fear from Owls, and
jduces a very fine effect in a garden. A pair at liberty very often
sappoint their owner by staying several months and disappearing
len they appear on the point of nesting. In order to succeed with a
ir it is necessary to have a very steady cock, for among the Platycerci
is the cock bird who decides the movements of the pair.
The Adelaide Parrakeet (P. adelaidce), from South and Central
istralia, is classed by certain authorities as a variety of Pennant. In
:y opinion it may very well be a hybrid between P. elegans and
!. flaveolus , which has become fixed and now comes true.
The Adelaide differs from the Pennant by the paler red of its
umage, which has a yellowish tinge, and the mantle has pale orange
d edges. Individuals vary much in colour; some are very like Pennants,
[ L t the majority look very different and wear a mixture of colours which
akes them appear at once beautiful and remarkable. The sexes are
ike, the head and beak offering the only distinction, \oung birds
*e like Pennants, but their green is more golden in shade. They
\0x25A0quire the same treatment as the preceding species.
The Yellow-rumped Parrakeet (P. flaveolus) comes from the
me locality, but is very rare in confinement. It may be described as
small Pennant, whose red has everywhere been replaced by pale
;llow tinged with olive. The sexes are much alike in colour, but the
)ung seem to be much greener than the adults. A male which I
; Assessed was exceedingly quarrelsome. The same treatment as
le above.
The Yellow-bellied Parrakeet (P. flaviventris), from Tasmania,
aly differs from the last named by having the back, wings, and rump
ark green. Both sexes are alike in colour, but the hen may readily be
nown by her weaker beak and small head. The young are distinguish-
ble by their green breasts and more uniformly green backs.
This species is the most delicate of the Platycerci. Although easy
) feed and not much affected by cold, it is very subject to septicaemia,
iberculosis, and other diseases. It does best in a movable aviary
 |ith plenty of grass, and the site must be changed annually. It must
ot be too much exposed to the sun in summer, but enjoys it at other

The Mealy Rosella (P . pallidiceps) inhabits the east and the interic
of Australia ; it has the top of the head and back of the neck pal
yellow, the cheeks white, mantle greenish yellow mixed with blacl
the under tail feathers red, the lower back, rump, and all the und(
parts are pale blue. The hen is smaller and not as brightly coloured a
her mate. The young are less distinctly marked, and there is a shad
of green in their plumage.
This species should be treated like the others. Once acclimatizec
it is as hardy as any other of the family, but when newly importe
they are subject to chills and need watching. With ordinary precaution
they are not difficult to breed at liberty or in an aviary. A variet
(P. amathusia ) living in North Australia has blue cheeks and a greene
mantle. It is very rarely imported, although very beautiful.
Brown's Parrakeet (P. venustus ) from North Australia is smalle
than the above-named species. Many people consider this the mos
beautiful of its genus ; its head is black with white cheeks 5 under parts
lower back, and rump straw coloured, each feather narrowly edged wit&apos;
black ; sub-caudals red ; the feathers of the mantle are black edge*
with straw colour ; the wings and tail violet blue. The female is smalle
and not as brightly coloured as the male. They require the same treat
ment as the rest of the genus. But, like Palliceps, they must be protecteii
from cold on first arrival; afterwards they may be looked upon a
quite hardy. They do not breed as freely as the other Platycerc:
being slow to accustom themselves to our seasons, persistently moultin,
in May and laying in September. Toung birds hatched during autum:
and reared in a heated aviary rarely makegood specimens ; it is bette
to exercise patience and only to provide nesting boxes in April and t"
remove them at the end of August. If this plan be rigorously persevered
with the birds will moult earlier every year and finally go to nest h
July. Needless to say, it is quite useless to allow Brown's to nest outsid*
in cold w r eather ; if the hen does not die of egg binding the young wil
certainly perish soon after they are hatched. For no apparent reason
many more hens than cocks are imported. There is a blue-cheeket
variety which also has a yellow breast.
The Stanley Parrakeet (P. icterotis) is a native of South-Wes&apos;
Australia ; it is the smallest of its genus, and the only one in which th&lt;

k and hen have very different colouring. In the cock the cheeks are
it yellow, the rest of the head, the neck, and all the under parts of
" body are bright red ; the back and rump are green ; the tail and
igs green and blue. The hen is distinguishable by her dull red head
I breast, speckled with green and yellow. Young birds resemble
dr mother and gradually change their colouring like the other
itycerci. By the middle of January their sex can easily be determined,
is species should have the same treatment as the Kosella ; it breeds
ely in an aviary, but is as spiteful as its larger relatives.
Parrakeets of the genus Barnardius may be distinguished from the
le Platycerci by certain structural details ; but to the ordinary
lateur they belong to the same class. They are, however, larger and
ve thicker and shorter beaks ; they are usually green.
Barnard's Parrakeet (B . barnardi) from South and South-East
istralia is a beautiful bluish green, with a red forehead, head and
intle tinged with dark grey ; a half-collar round the nape of the neck
d lower breast is yellow ; the wings and tail are variegated blue and
een. A variety exists which has no yellow on the breast. The sexes
e alike, though the hen is sometimes duller ; the only sure distinction
:s in the size of the head and beak. When the young leave the nest
ey are less brightly coloured, and are greener and duller than the
lults. Barnard's bear a bad reputation in Australia for dying in
lantities on being captured, but those which reach us are usually strong
id hardy. They go to nest readily, either in an aviary or at liberty.
!iey should be treated like Rosellas.
Bauer's and Yellow-naped Parrakeets (B. zonarius and B.
mitorquatus), held by Gould to be two species, are only local races
the same bird. It is true that there is a great difference in the size,
*louring, and even the voice of the large Yellow-nape, all green
ith a red forehead, and the little Bauer with a yellow belly and black
rehead ; but between the two extremes is every possible gradation,
* much so that it is impossible to say where one begins or the other
ids. Yellow-napes inhabit the south-west and Bauer&apos;s the south and
iterior of Australia.
Bauer's are green, with blue on tail and wings ; the belly yellow,
half-collar of the same colour and a black head, shading into blue on

the cheeks. Yellow-napes are larger and have the under parts whol
green and the forehead red. The sexes are alike, but the hens ha
narrower beaks and smaller heads. Both Bauer's and Yellow-nap
are perfectly hardy. They should be treated like Bosellas. They a
terribly quarrelsome, and have a habit of biting off their adversary
beaks. Therefore, they must not be allowed their liberty where the
are other Parrakeets bold enough to join battle with them.
These Parrakeets can learn to whistle a tune, and even to speak
few words in a hoarse voice, but none of the Platycerci nor Barnarc
talk really well, nor can they be made real pets, for as soon as they lo,
their fear of man they usually grow vicious and aggressive and she
no real affection for their owner. The natural voice of Yellow-nape
though too powerful for indoors, is agreeable in the open, and the wi
whistling calls of a male bird when flying are charming. None of tl
Platycerci actually scream unless wounded or frightened, and as
have already said, their voices are usually musical. A blue and whi
colour variety of Bauer's Parrakeet has been met with.
The Bed-capped Parrakeet (Porphyriocephalus spurius) occupi
an isolated position and differs from the genuine Platycerci in its shap
its colour, and its manner of life. It is the same size as a Pennan
with a long and pointed tail and a long, narrow, peculiarly shaped bea
Its plumage is unique ; the top of its head is red, as are also the bel
and sub-caudals ; cheeks green, changing to yellow on the sides of tl
neck ; the back is green ; wings and tail green and blue ; the brea
is a pretty shade of slaty purple.
This species is to be found in West Australia. Its range is restrict
and its numbers are rapidly decreasing, owing to cultivation and tl
war waged on it by the owners of orchards. If it be not bred in co:
finement it will probably soon cease to exist. The sexes are easi.
recognized, for the hen always has more or less green mixed with the re
on her head and her cheeks are much duller. Young birds have entire:
green heads, but attain adult plumage after their first moult.
The Bed-capped Parrakeet is rare and is troublesome to manage i
confinement in this country ; if caught when adult, it is very wild an
never becomes really tame even after years of aviary life. Young birc
taken from the nest are, however, easily tamed. The species needs

efully protected from chills, and although it may, once acclimatized,

)orted it requires a very high temperature and plenty of exercise.
\ first it must not be placed in an unheated aviary, even in summer,

is a quarrelsome species, and as it is no more amiable towards its
n kind than towards other Parrakeets, it is imprudent to put several
lples together, even when travelling. In spite of its shyness, it is
!&amp;quot;; difficult to persuade it to nest; it has been bred in England. One
my specimens lived for a long time at liberty.
A Red-capped Parrakeet's aviary must be very strongly built,
although some individuals do not bite through ordinary wire netting,
lers quickly make themselves a way of escape, \oung birds are very
icate, for which reason the nest-box must be hung in a very sheltered

j a separate genus, for they are no more Psephoti than Platycerci or

with ; the sexes are alike, but the hens are smaller and duller. T1
young are very much the same as the adults, only slightly less bright
coloured.
Blue Bonnets are very active and playful, they are not suitable f
a cage, but would make admirable aviary birds but for the
susceptibility to infectious diseases, especially two kinds
septicaemia. They are very spiteful and can kill birds a good deal biggj
than themselves. Some aviary keepers have found them amiable wi,
small birds, but not all. Blue Bonnets should be fed like Rosella |
they can stand cold well, even when first imported if they are in goq
plumage, and they seldom require heat.
In consideration of their liability to disease, it is best to keep the!
in movable aviaries. A cock whose hen is shut up stays well, an
notwithstanding his small size, escapes the attacks of his enemi,
through his agility, caution, and his power of biting savagely. Paii
however, rarely succeed well at liberty, and are disposed

l a fine pair of Bauer's (Mr. Frostick) fourth.
The " All Other Species" class contained Whitley's Conure, of which
recently had a coloured plate in our Magazine. It received the first

ich took second prize, was a superb bird, while Lord Tavistock's
rfolk Island Parrakeet, which obtained third prize, was a great
Sty. Mr. Frostick sent a fine pair of the Tasmanian Yellow-bellied
Aakeets and Lord Tavistock a fine Yellow-rumped.
The class for Hybrids and abnormally coloured birds was, as usual,
, ery interesting one. Lord Tavistock sent his exquisite Lutino Blue-
nted Amazon. It is a wonderful bird, of a bright canary-yellow
h crimson markings. His hybrid Alexandra Crimson-wing is also a
tutiful and most interesting bird. Mr. Whitley's hybrid Glossy
trling is a great curiosity, the male parent being a BurchelFs Starling
I the female a Chestnut-winged Starling.
There were two Black Cockatoos, one sent by Mr. Whitley (first)
d the other by Lord Tavistock (second). Mr. Hawkins sent a Spix,
icaw (third), in a cage that was too small for it.
In the class for " All other species of Parrots ", Mr. Whitley took
it prize with a pair of the very rare Yellow-headed Poeocejphalus

were shown. There were also some good Rainbow Buntings, a Versicoi
Bunting, Gouldian, and others, but the rarest thing in the class, thou
perhaps the least conspicuous, was a small Waxbill sent by Mr. Width
It belonged to a species described as recently as October last and nam
Estrilda xanthophrys by Mr. W. L. Sclater in the Bulletin of the Brit,
Ornithologists Club. It was therefore the rarest bird in the show, thou
the judge may well be excused for not spotting it.
A very fine Mariqua Sunbird belonging to Mr. Maxwell very right
took first and special prize in the class for these birds, and the small
Tanagers and Sugar-birds. In the Glossy Starling class there were t\
pairs of Royals, some Superbs, and a very good Purple-head.
The class for Crows, Jays, and Toucans was interesting. Mr. Frostij
was lucky in securing first for a Red-bellied Toucan agaiu
Mr. Maxwell's very rare and beautiful Green Toucanette, which w
awarded second prize. Mr. Whitley&apos;s pair of Pileated Jays we
beauties, and his very small Aracari was a rarity.
The " Any other small species " class contained some very got
birds. Mr. C. T. Maxwell sent a lovely Minivet which obtained fir
prize, a rare Indian Shrike, shown by Mr. Whitley, coming second ai
a beautiful Rufous-bellied Niltava (Mr. C. S. Dunstan) third.
In the " Any other larger species " class Mr. Whitley took fir
with a very beautiful pair of White-breasted Touracous, a speci
that is a bad liver as a rule, though Mr. Whitley seems to have solvt
the difficulty of keeping it in excellent condition. Why the secoi
prize should have gone to a Donaldson's, a common species nowada;

which was also in the class and probably the first ever exhibited,

The Turquoisine was comparatively common as a cage-bird in
rope many years ago, and it might with care have been conserved
1 multiplied instead of being allowed to die out as it did, while
fortunately no trouble was taken to protect it in its limited habitat
South-Eastern Australia. The youths of Sydney were in the habit
proceeding to the country on Saturday afternoons in order to shoot
rrakeets for " Parrot-pie ", much of the " bag " consisting of
rquoisines !
Sheep farming was also a very potent factor in the diminution of this
icies, for the grass seed which formed the food of these Parrakeets
s not allowed to form when the sheep came and ate the grass.
But the Turquoisine is not extinct, as was at one time feared, and
s satisfactory to hear that our member, Mr. Simon Harvey, jun.,of
elaide, has reared a brood of Turquoisines in his aviary.
Mr. Blaauw has for many years kept a wonderful collection of
terfowl at Gooilust, in Holland, and he has bred most of the rare
;cies of Geese and Ducks. One of his latest successes has been with

xdes of which he published an account in our journal in July, 1925.

That the Californian Quail is not perfectly hardy may have been

The Thick-billed Parrot is the monotype of the genus Rhynchopsitta
d is placed between the genera Ara and Conuropsis in Ridgeway's
tssification of American Psittacidse. It is a medium-sized parrot
out the size of the Yellow-headed Amazon and is slightly reminiscent
the Military Macaw in appearance. It's bill is large and heavy
d black in colour. The habitat of this fine Parrot is in the pine belt
the mountains of northern and middle Mexico and it occasionally
mders northward into Southern Arizona.
Mr. Lee S. Crandall, curator of birds in the New York Zoological
irk, says he knows of no record of its ever having been kept in captivity
d diligent search on my part fails to reveal this fact.
In colour it is a deep green with none of the dusky colour edging
, the feathers. The cheeks are brighter green and the under parts
hter green and slightly duller. The forehead and a broad stripe
er each eye is deep carmine and the bend of the wing and lower part
i thigh is bright geranium red. The under surface of wing and tail
slate colour and the under primary coverts are clear yellow. The
*dy feathers have a highly polished effect.

G. H. Gurney--The Chestnut-headed Buarremon
Our bird, which we call " Mickey ", is very tame and affectionat
especially with our young son, but it does not seem to take to the ladie
It delights in snuggling around one's neck and rubbing its cheek again
one's ear. It has a decidedly unpleasant voice which, if my memo]
serves me right, is similar to that of the Rose-breasted Cockatoo.

I have lately received a pair of these birds, which I believe are ne
to Aviculture. The genus Buarremon is composed of a group of Tan
grine Finches, closely allied to the Saltators and to the Magpie Tanage
( Cissopsis ). They range over the whole of Central America, froi
Mexico to Peru, and are especially common in the Andean area. M
birds, which arrived in fairly good condition, have now settled dow
well, they are at present in a large flight cage, but no doubt later (
they will be put into an aviary. They are rather larger than a Scarl
Tanager, but much more sturdily built, the wings are short, and vei
square looking in flight, and the bill is considerably longer and mo
elongated than in the majority of the Tanagridae. There is a slig]
difference in colour between the two birds, one being somewhat light
than the other, and the black spots on the front of the head are n
so pronounced, this is presumably the hen. Above and on the low^
parts of the breast they are a dull yellowish green colour, wings ar
tail brown, the crown of the head is a rich chestnut red, sides of tl
head and forehead jet black, with three white longish spots, the thro,
down to the pectoral collar is snowy white, the collar black, upp
parts of the breast grey ; this description of their colouring will sho
that they are very showy birds, the black and white of the thro;
and head and the rich red brown top making them very conspicuou
My pair are very tame, and extremely active and inquisitive, alwaj
on the move, jerking their heads continually and flicking their rath
short tails in quite a Shrike-like way ; they are so square lookir
and thickset, that they remind one almost of a Dipper, and as the

Mr. Chapman has lately received a fair quantity of these from
exico. It is also known as the Grey Solitaire, and has been exhibited
fore at the Zoo, while an allied species, Townsend's Solitaire
l. toivnsendi), was described by the late Mr. Astley, and well illustrated
this journal in 1919 (New Series, Vol. VII, p. 319). According
Dr. Hopkinson's book, it was bred in Moscow in 1912.
It is about the size of a Scarlet Tanager, of dark slaty blue, with a
ag of white feathers round the eye.
It sings very attractively and continuously. Two or three in a room
mind me of a chime of little silver bells, or of those Japanese glass
limes which clash and tinkle in the breeze. (I am also bound to admit
iat one of my birdy friends described the song as like the scraping of
wheelbarrow wheel in need of oiling !)
The Clarino seems to be largely frugivorous, mine preferring soaked
irrants and chopped apple to anything else.
The hens sing also, and have a " feminine look " and a narrower
sad than the cocks, and care should be taken to see they get their
ir share of food when the sexes are put together as the cocks are very
hteful towards them.

AUSTRALIAN PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995093555555555" page_id="58075517"  page_num="Page 94" year="" vol="">
By the Marquess of Tavistock and J. Delacour
(Concluded Jrom p. 84)
The genus Psephotus is a well-defined group of small Parrakeet
whose chief characteristic is the striking difference in plumage betweei
the sexes ; the hens are nearly as plainly clad as hen Pheasants ar
when compared with cocks. Their wings and tails are long but thei
beaks and feet are small.
The Psephoti have very weak and musical voices which couli
not annoy the most sensitive ear, and are besides graceful and pretty
They are, however, very quarrelsome. They succeed very well ii|
aviaries but should never be confined in cages for any length of time!
To keep any Psephotus permanently in a parrot cage is exceedingly!
cruel.
The Red-rumped Parrakeet (Psephotus hcematonotus) is th
commonest of the group ; it is very hardy and easy to breed whd
acclimatized. The male bird is a fine green tinged with blue on th
head and wings, with a greyish mantle ; his belly is yellow passing
into white on the sub-caudals and the rump is red, the outer retrice
are blue and white. The female is greyish green. Young males car
be told by their greener hue and by a little red on the back. Th
length of this species is about 15 inches. Red-rumps should hav
the same treatment as Rosellas ; they do not care for fruit but ea
green food freely.
They are charming at liberty and stay well, breed rjeadily, do n&lt;
harm to fruit and never go down chimneys ; they look particularly
fascinating running about on a closely-cut lawn. Unfortunately
they can only be kept safely where there are no Tawny Owls. I

Red-rump loses his mate he will disappear after a few days if another
3 not provided at once. On letting out a pair the same precautions
hould be taken as advised for the Platycerci. Red-rumps are natives
f South and South-East Australia.
The Manycoloured Parrakeet (P . multicolor) inhabits the
iouth and interior of Australia ; it is the same size as the Red-rump
nd the male is really magnificent. His colour is satiny green shading
ato blue, with a yellow forehead. The nape is sometimes brick
ed, the wings are blue and green with a yellow mark on the shoulders,
he belly is red, w T ings blue and green bearing a yellow spot on the
houlders ; the tail is blue and white, green at the base ; there is a
ed spot on the rump and the belly is red, the sub-caudals yellow.
The female is grey green with nape, rump and shoulders spotted
i.ith brick red ; wungs and tail tinged with blue. They fly very
racefully.
They should be fed like the previously mentioned species, omitting
uemp and sunflower. They are nearly as ready to go to nest in confine-
aent but not so easily kept in good health. They can be kept out
&amp;gt;f doors when acclimatized, but w r hen first imported must be kept warm,
lanycolours must be shut up at night when kept in an aviary. Their
hief trouble is their habit of contracting contagious diseases, especially
epticsemia. But as the germs of this illness are local, one amateur
nay succeed very w t ell with this species while another cannot save them,
lovable aviaries are very desirable for them, indeed almost essential,
lanycolours may be let fly like Red-rumps, but are more inclined
o stray and it is necessary to take more precautions.
The Hooded Parrakeet (P . dissimilis) is one of the prettiest
^rrakeets in the world, and w r hen flying, looks like a huge butterfly,
die male has a black top to his head, his cheeks, throat, breast, belly,
nd rump are turquoise blue ; his back and mantle are greyish brown,
\ ail and wings deep blue green ; the small wing-coverts are golden
ellow and the sub-caudal feathers orange-red. The female has
greenish grey head ; back, wings and breast pale green ; the belly
s blue, sub-caudals orange-red, tail green and blue. The female
a a light brownish olive, washed with pale blue on the cheeks, breast,
nd under parts. This species is a native of North Australia.

Aviculture
The Hooded Parrakeet should have the same food as the precedi
species. As it comes from the tropics, it needs to be very cafefu?
acclimatized, and on first arrival it requires a high temperatui;
later it should be shut up for the night and in bad weather healtj'
specimens may be kept outside throughout the year. Unfortunate
the Hooded Parrakeet often retains the habit of moulting and breedi
according to Australian seasons and to cure this it should be treat!
like Brown's Parrakeet. In its native land it breeds in the neJ
of the termite and consequently some hens are difficult to please ai
will not make use of the ordinary nesting logs, and must be tempt
with other shapes.
Where there are no Owls these Parrakeets can be given their liber
and a pair of them will charm their owner more under those conditio
than a whole aviary full of other birds. When they have settled dov
they never stray, but a good deal of care must be exercised in liberatii
them. Young cocks are like the hens except that their cheeks a
a little bluer ; the black and yellow colouring appears after the fir
moult.
A dealer will occasionally offer a young bird, apparently in god
health, but minus flight and tail feathers. On no account should
be bought, for not only do the missing feathers never grow, but in tin
the bird loses even the feathers which it has. The Hooded Parrake

Golden-shouldered Parrakeet (P. chrysopterygius) is four
farther south in the interior of Australia ; it is much like the abov
but can be distinguished by its smaller hood and by a yellow bar
on the forehead. The hen also shows traces of this band. It is eve
more rarely imported than the Hooded.

Bourke's Parrakeet (Neopsephotus bourkei) from South Australia
iperficially resembles the genus Neophema but in reality it is very
istinct and has no very close affinities. It has none of those faults
hich make some people dislike Parrakeets. Its plumage is not gaudy
ut softly shaded, rosy grey on the head, neck, and breast, grey edged
ith green on the mantle and wungs, the folds of which are light blue ;
ae belly is pink, the under tail-coverts sky blue, the tail blue and dark
rey. It has a melodious voice, does not bite when handled and does
ot destroy shrubs. The sexes are alike in colour but the difference
l the size of the head is sufficiently pronounced to enable them to
e distinguished.
Bourke's Parrakeets inhabit desert country and never bathe in
onfinement nor eat green stuff ; they feed exclusively on millet and
anary seed. There is no harm in offering them groundsel or flowering
rass but they seldom touch it. Sometimes they like a turf of grass,
specially when it begins to wither. Once acclimatized they stand
old fairly well if protected from wind and damp. They go to nest
eadily but must only be allowed to breed during the w r arm months,
breeding pairs should be kept by themselves as the cocks may kill
ach other or if they do not go as far as that, the weaker will be
&amp;gt;adly plucked. The bottom of their log must be quite near the
sntrance hole, for this species, unlike most other Parrakeets, is not a
limber.
Bourke's Parrakeets are susceptible to disease, particularly tuber-
miosis, and need a clean sunny aviary. Their worst fault is their
nveterate habit of banging themselves against the roof and sides of
keir aviary in flight if they are frightened, or, in the case of the young
oirds, when they leave the nest. It is absolutely necessary to have

taut. I have found this species inoffensive &apos;with other birds.
The Grass Parrakeets ( Neojphema ) include some of the mo
interesting small Australian Parrakeets. They are, generally speakin
harmless to other birds, do not bite, and their voices are not disagre
able ; they are extremely pretty and breed quite readily in an aviar
Unfortunately they are excessively rare and competent observe::
assert that they are on the way to complete extinction ; but for a
that it has for years been believed that certain species had entire^
disappeared, and yet they have come to light again either in littl
scattered flocks or isolated pairs.
The Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet (N. venusta) is found i
Tasmania and specimens still occasionally arrive in Europe and America
Its colouring is olive green, yellower on the cheeks and belly, whic
last is sometimes tinged with orange ; a narrow band across the fore
head ; the wings and part of the tail are very bright blue. The fee
and beak are small and delicate. Its length is about 10 inches. Th
blue band across the forehead is duller and less marked on the hen
and she has also greenish feathers in the blue patch on her wings
Young birds have less blue than adults, but assume their full plumagi
long before they are a year old. Adults are quarrelsome ; the hen,
being more pugnacious and stronger than the cocks and a watch mus'
be kept lest a hen take a dislike to a new mate, for she may injure hin
severely. Bluewings require heat wdien they first come over, but once
acclimatized they will live out of doors if they are shut up at nighl
and during cold weather.
These Parrakeets are liable to septicaemia and it is advisable to
house them in movable aviaries. Like Bourke's they have the annoying
habit of hitting themselves against the wire and require an inner lining
of string netting to keep them from biting the roof mesh. A smooth plank
on which they cannot hang should be fixed just underneath ; they do
not gnaw hanging head downwards as they are not good at climbing.
Bluewings are rather liable to sunstroke in great heat for they
are apt to expose themselves most rashly. A few leafy branches
should be laid on the roof of their aviary so as to intercept the direct
rays, but in winter they need all the sun they can get. Like other

Grass Parrakeets eat millet and canary seed with a little hemp and
enty of groundsel and flowering grass. They usually lay four eggs

:e d in captivity are mostly infertile. As already mentioned when
waling with Bourke's Parrakeet, the entrance hole should be near
ie bottom of their nesting log.
The Elegant Parrakeet (N . elegans) from South-West
ustralia is much like the foregoing but the blue strip on its wings is
mch narrower and of two shades, and the green more golden. It is
iow very rare but in former times it was well known and has been
Ted in aviaries. Old males may have an orange patch on the
b do men like Bluewings and Orange Bellies.
The Orange-bellied Parrakeet (N . chrysogaster) is a native of
asmania and South and South-East Australia. It is like the
luewing but is greener and the blue area on the forehead is wider, more
idefinite, and less brilliant in colour. The species is almost unknown
i aviaries, and is probably on the verge of extinction.
The Rock Grass Parrakeet (N . petrophila ) is much like Venusta
ut is duller and more olive and has less blue in its wing. It is the
ullest-coloured member of the group. This species inhabits certain
oastal districts in South-West Australia and nests in holes under large
xmes. It is being exterminated by cats and rats, and is now very
^arce. I had two males in my possession for several years ; they were
msitive to the cold and could not be wintered out of doors. One
f them paired with a hen Venusta, but the eggs were clear. It has
een bred in Germany.
The Turquoisine (N . pulchella ) is a native of South and South-
last Australia. It is a tragedy that this lovely little bird was not
reserved in Europe, for it bred freely and might have been domesticated
ke the Budgerigar. For years it was believed to be extinct but latterly
few specimens have been discovered and two or three have reached
lurope and the United States. The male bird is olive green above

have even less blue than their mother but attain their full pluma
when a few months old.
These Parrakeets should be fed on millet and canary seed wi
flowering grass and groundsel. They have the same habits and diseas
as Bluewings. Turquoisines in former days were commonly in t
market.
The Splendid Parrakeet (N . splendida) is more beautifj
even than the Turquoisine Parrakeet; it was a native of Sout
West Australia and has always been very rare. It is, however, report&apos;
to have bred in the Zoological Gardens of London. Its back, manh
and tail are green, the latter being yellow underneath and at the side
Its head is brilliant cobalt blue ; its breast bright red \ its wings
mixture of light and dark blue; its abdomen golden yellow. The h&lt;
has no red breast. This species which was thought to be extin
has lately reappeared. It is said that two specimens were caugi
and eaten by a farmer whose granary they had entered during
drought ! Owing to the destruction of its refuges in times of droug]
and the increasing colonization of the country, there is no hope th;
the bird will maintain itself permanently even in the deserts of tl
interior.
The Cyanoramphus Parrakeets come from New Zealand ar
Oceania and are about the size of a Rosella. They are usually gree
but their heads are adorned with red or yellow and their wings tingf
with blue.
The Lew Zealand Red-fronted Parrakeet (C. novce-zelandic

scarcity in its native country and to the strict protection afforde
it, it is now hardly ever seen here. It is a fine grass green, has if

irns to speak. Its food should consist of two parts of canary to
.e of hemp and one of oats, together with apple and green food.
The Norfolk Island Parrakeet ( C . cooki) strongly resembles
e Red-fronted but it is much larger and it has a stronger beak. It
now almost extinct, having been exterminated by rats. They
ipear to be gentle but are apt to feel the cold : they should not be
owed much hemp or sunflower seed.
The Yellow-fronted New Zealand Parrakeet (0. auriceps)
even rarer than the above. It differs in not having red cheeks,
it a w r ide yellow band on the top of its head while its forehead is
d, and there is a red patch on the rump. It was freely imported
former times and was scarcely less prolific than the Red-fronted ;
was bred several times in France, especially by Delacour.
Besides these species the following have been imported : C. saisseti
om New Caledonia, C. unicolor from the Antipodean Islands,
id C. erythronotus from the Society Islands. The first may be dis-
tiguished from the Red-fronted by its larger size, and yellow cheeks
id throat; the second is all green ; the third has a black forehead
id the lores ; a spot on the ear-coverts and the rump are reddish
*own ; its body is olive green freely marked with blue on the wings
id tail.
The two species belonging to the genus Nymphicus differ from the
*yanoramphus by their pointed crests. They are pretty, interesting,
id inoffensive. They have been bred in confinement but very seldom,
they are usually most difficult to keep alive. Occasionally one
ay come across an individual who lives many years without special

ixatiously.
The Uvean Parrakeet ( N . uvceensis) from the Loyalty Islands
grass green, yellowish underneath and on the rump ; it has a crest
&apos;mposed of six curved dark green feathers, becoming paler towards
e extremities ; the feathers on the forehead are dark green with
d tips ; wings and tail partly blue ; the face, cheeks, and chin are
irk green. I believe the sexes to be alike, unless there is some
fference in the size of the head and beak.

aviaries died of anaemia and softening of the bones ; while othei
living in cages, succumbed to aspergillosis. It would seem that tl
best method of keeping them in good health is by giving them ve
nourishing and varied food ; hemp, canary, millet, oats, sunflowa
monkey nuts, fruit, green food, and mealworms. This Parrakeet hi
a peculiar but not disagreeable voice ; it is active and interest^
and becomes perfectly tame.
The Horned Parrakeet (N. cornutus) from New Caledon
is even larger and handsomer. Its chief difference lies in its head ar
crest. This last is composed of two long narrow feathers which pob
backwards and are black with red tips. The top of the head is re-
black at the base of the feathers ; the nape and flanks are yellow
face and cheeks black ; the remainder is grass green tinged with yello
on the rump and with blue on the wings and tail.
It is rarer than the Uvean and has not been imported for a lor
while. It was bred several times in France by Cornily, who also reare
the Uvean Parrakeeet and hybrids between the two ; but breedir
them at all must have been due to a lucky chance combined wit
uncommon skill.
The Swift Parrakeet (Nanodes discolor), very widely distribute
throughout South-East Australia and Tasmania, is an attracts
and very distinct little species. It is the same size as the Gra:
Parrakeets ; it has a yellowish beak and feet and golden yellow eve

Although it feeds in the same fashion as the Lories, and is, like then

a delightful species at liberty and well worth the trouble it may gb
in establishing it.
It is necessary to procure several strong, healthy pairs whkj
have been bred in an outside aviary and to keep them shut up f.
several months on the spot where it is intended to release them. Tht
can then be let out a few at a time, with food at hand and nest-box
in the trees. It is wise to catch up young birds directly they cd
feed themselves ; otherwise they stray. They should be fed at fir
on soaked canary seed and kept in a sheltered aviary. In the midd
of September all old cocks should be caught up and placed in aviarie
When it is certain that no young remain in the nests the hens can at
be caught. They are easily taken if they have been accustomd
to be fed in trap cages which can be closed by pulling a string. It
not safe to let Budgerigars winter at liberty on account of owl
Budgerigars do no harm to the garden and never touch either but
or fruit. The species is completely domesticated in Europe, an
breeding it has become a considerable business, particularly in Franc
where tens of thousands are raised every year. They are fed on canar
and millet with all kinds of green stuff and a little soft insectivoroi
food with bread and milk when they are nesting. Old wall morti
is indespensable for them. In southern parts, Toulon in particula
where they are chiefly bred, they are given Thuya boughs and lettuc
leaves.
Before leaving the Parrakeets we must mention those strang
Australian birds distantly related to the Platycercinae which ai
remarkable for their terrestial habits, and live on the ground, wher
they run with great rapidity on their long legs. They fly rapidly bu
never perch.
The Ground Parrakeet (Pezojporus terrestris) is found in Sout.

developed tail, and it has a very short beak. Its plumage is gree:

In the spring of 1922 I bought a pair of Green Cardinals and turned
lem out into the aviary in May. The cock bird, apparently quite
ealthy, I found dead one morning about three weeks later. Here,
may say that the aviary is built against a wall facing south-west,
lb is open to all weathers, winter and summer, except that one end is
lofed in with glass to keep the food dry in wet weather. Prior to
he arrival of the Green Cardinals I had a Virginian Cardinal (male),
ut it was not until the summer of 1925 that the Green Cardinal hen
lowed signs of nesting. In that year, at the end of June she built
nest of sticks and grass, rather an untidy structure, inside a wire
asket hanging from the roof under the end that was covered in with
lass. She laid four eggs, blue spotted with dark brown, and began to
t. At the time, there was a spell of very hot weather, and she was
i full sun directly under the glass, I put a bit of canvas shading over
le glass to give her some protection. My attention, however, was
ot appreciated, for she at once deserted her nest. I had no idea
b that time who her mate was, or w 7 hether the eggs were fertile. On
reaking one of them I discovered that they were.
She was not many days before she got busy again, carrying up
its of fresh grass to the old nest, and then laid three more eggs. This
me, something took the eggs, and I have never to this day discovered
ho was the culprit. I rather suspected a pair of Spreo Starlings
wrongly as it proved later) for I had seen one of them take a Zebra
inch's egg out of a nest-box.
Nothing daunted, the Green Cardinal laid a third time. So I
rught up the Spreos and caged them inside the aviary. However,

the eggs again disappeared, so the Spreos were once more set fn
So each attempt at nesting that year ended in disaster.
Last summer, however, she built again in the same basket, la
four eggs and again they were taken. There was not even a trace
broken shells. Soon after I saw her again carrying bits of gras
so I took the basket away, in the hope that she would shift elsewher
She then built a nest in a small fir-tree, laid three eggs, and this tin
was not molested and hatched them in July. There was no dou]
during incubation as to her mate, for whenever any mealworms we:
thrown in, the Red Cardinal at once took them up to her and fed h
while she was sitting. As soon as the young hatched he at once wei
on to the nest when she came off to feed and both parents fed the your
ones in turn. One young bird died in the nest, another I foun
dead below on the ground. The third became fully fledged, almo;
ready to leave the nest, when there was a violent thunderstorm. Th
nest got drenched and next morning the last remaining young one ws
dead. This was at the end of July.
Early in August, she began building again in the basket which
had replaced, so I moved it at once into a small wooden shelter insid
the aviary, a much more secluded spot with a roof over her hea
in case of storms. My hope that she might follow her partly-buil
nest to its new locality was fulfilled. She finished the nest, laid tw
eggs at some days interval, and duly hatched one. The other eg ;
came to nothing. Both parents again fed the young one. Ther
was the usual soft food available and I gave them a liberal suppl 1
of fresh ants' eggs and gentles, but was sparing with mealworms
In due course the young one left the nest. The first morning I fount
it out on the ground I had rather an anxious moment. Both the Spreo
were standing over it and I was much afraid that they were going t&lt;
kill it. My fears, however, were quite unwarranted, for I sooi
discovered that the Spreos were feeding it even more assiduousl)
than its own parents. The Spreos, usually gluttons for mealworms
flew down to the young bird, holding the mealworms in their beaks
at the same time giving vent to a loud twittering song. As soon as
the young one opened its mouth, the mealworms was popped down
its throat. It continued to thrive, and until it could fly I caught it

A TALE OF A BARNARD'S PARRAKEET
By the Marquess of Tavistock
I have, this winter, added one more to the list of the Barnard's
irrakeets of my acquaintance who have possessed abnormal tempera-
'snts. There was one that despised matrimony and devoted himself
the unpleasant hobby of biting human noses ; another whose devotion
his mate always turned to furious resentment if she left his company
t a few days, even against her will; a third who hated all Broadtails
espective of sex and loved all other Parrakeets, likewise irrespective
sex. The Perfect Gentleman came to me last summer, but at
st I did not realize he was in any way unusual. For several years
lave had two hen Barnards for whom I have vainly tried to obtain
ites. Barnard after Barnard has been sent on approval, only to
rn out to be another female ; if the new one did happen to be a
ile it was some wretched little aviary-bred degenerate of no possible

later in the year I got hold of a second cock, who is the Perfect Gent)
man, as a mate for the green-breasted hen whose portrait is to appe
in the Magazine at a later date. In buying the Perfect Gentlem;
from a fellow member I heartlessly arranged to have him separat
from the wife with whom he had lived happily for some time--a dir
trick for which my conscience has reproached me since I have cor
to realize the sterling merits of his character. Many cock Barnar
on being parted from their lawful spouses and introduced to a stran
female of unattractive habits would have murdered her without lc
of time, but that was not the way of the Perfect Gentleman. Althou"
he did not pretend to be greatly impressed with his new companio
he evidently came to the conclusion that there was some excu
for the poor thing and he lived with her on terms of kindly tolerant
Early in the winter I made arrangements for giving both cock Barnar
their liberty. The feeding and management of my Parrakeets
liberty is complicated by the fact that one set have to be shut up eve
night to protect them from Owls and consequently must know of i
feeding places except those inside an aviary, while the other set, whi*
is composed of birds too powerful to need protection, or too spite!
to be confined together at night, have to be trained to feed in plac
where the seed is not visible to those that have not been taught whe
to look for it. Most of the Parrakeets that roost at liberty are f
inside specially constructed boxes and the second cock Barnard w
educated to the use of the box, but I trained the Perfect Gentlema
who was the first to be released, to enter the shelter of a small avia
up the garden, the top of the flight of which is always open. So(
after being set free the Perfect Gentleman paid a civil visit to I
former companion, but instead of being pleased, the ill-natured hus
flew at him and tried to attack him through the wire. He was n"
at all afraid of her, but his feelings were naturally hurt. From th
day on he has never settled on the top of her aviary ; it is undignifit
to engage in a brawl with a female ; if she is rude to you, it is be
to avoid her. The hen has long ago repented and calls seductive
to him, but although he often looks at her from a distance he will n*
come within 30 yards of her home. When the time came for tl
release of the second cock I was a little anxious lest there should 1

bad fight between the two males, for all normal Broadtails love
row when they are in perfect health and spirits. A few hours after
e second bird&apos;s release I noticed a cock Barnard in the small aviary
&amp;gt; the garden already referred to. He was looking inside the little
"or of the shelter where the Perfect Gentleman's food was kept.
i getting near I was surprised to see that it was not the Perfect
?ntleman but the second cock and still more surprised to discover
e Perfect Gentleman himself inside the shelter, feeding amicably
:thin a foot or two of the other. Instead, therefore, of flying at him
e moment he set eyes on him as any ordinary cock Barnard would
tve done on meeting a strange male on his ground, he had civilly
inducted the newcomer round the garden and asked him in to lunch 1
l the afternoon the Perfect Gentleman showed his companion round
i.e aviary field, called on the second cock's wife, refused to be embroiled
the fight which that lady tried hard to precipitate, wished the couple
&amp;gt;od day and flew off to his tea. Some time later, it is true, there
as a temporary break in the amicable relations between the two
&amp;gt;cks, but the Perfect Gentleman was in no way to blame. He had
tnply flown into a tree near the second cock and the latter was rude
lough to make an unprovoked attack upon him. In the melee which
isued the Perfect Gentleman proved himself by no means lacking in
mrage and came off victorious, but he bore no ill-will, for on subsequent
eetings with the second cock he was as good-natured as ever, clearly
iving decided to let bygones be bygones. It might be imagined that
ie Perfect Gentleman's good humour was simply due to the fact
tat he was not in breeding condition, but nothing could be further
om the case. I have never seen a more active and virile bird. All
iy long he was whistling and tail-waggling and examining holes
hich might do for a nest. And yet never once have I seen him
tack another Parrakeet. Barrabands, Ping necks, Kings may settle
ose to him, but however excited he may be there is no attempt to
&apos;ive them off. On Christmas Day a tame cock Hooded Parrakeet
caped from his aviary and flew up the garden. When I went to look
r him I found that the Perfect Gentleman had taken him under
s care. He looked on while I coaxed the Hooded into a cage, followed
&amp;gt; back to the bird-room, came close to the cage when I put it down at

the bird-room door, expressed the hope that the Hooded was not tir*
by his excursion, wdshed him goodnight and flew away.
Not the least striking feature of the Perfect Gentleman's condu
is his delicacy in never forcing himself unduly upon any of his neig&apos;
hours. He can be sociable without ever being a bore. A predecess&amp;gt;
referred to at the beginning of this article, aroused one's astonishmei
by the large-heartedness he displayed to all distant connexion
but his best friend could not have denied that he w T as ill-mannerc
and eccentric. He may have meant well, but it was not really nit
of him to pester the old Masked Parrakeet with offers of half-digeste
food, when it was obvious that " Georgie " feared and disliked tl
entire feathered race and only cared for the company of human beiig
and rats ; nor, if he had had any tact, would he have forced his societ
on a Barraband at the precise moment when the latter was wooin!
the lady of his choice ; nor if he had had any sense of humour, woid
he have finally laid his heart at the feet of an enormous and elder!
Amazon Parrot more than three times his size.
Another remarkable fact about the Perfect Gentleman is thsl
he never uses bad language. Every other robust male Broadta|
I have come across has only to hear or see a rival, to start a rapij
&apos;clicking noise with his beak, low, malevolent, and most expressive
The Perfect Gentleman, living, as he does, in charity with all birds
is blameless in thought and consequently in speech. . . . The shoij
winter day is closing in and the birds rouse themselves to that las
period of activity which precedes bedtime. A Bingneck, tilting slightl j
from side to side, crosses the aviary field in swift, direct flight, hi!
appearance evoking a chorus of excited cries from his companion
below. Kings pass backwards and forwards with restless grace. The tw
hen Barnards break out into loud, sweet whistling in which the Perfecl
Gentleman joins. There is a pause and very far away there come
the whistle of a fourth Barnard. The chorus is renewed and a fe^
seconds later the second cock swings into a tree above the aviaries
The Perfect Gentleman flies to the same tree and settles a few yard!
from the newcomer. He bow r s to him three times and addresses Bin
in gentle chuckling tones. " I hope, sir," you can hear him say
" that you have spent an agreeable day ? Well, it is getting late

:ross the garden to his roost. A few moments later the second
)ck has taken a rather different line to his own chosen sleeping place,
he Kings, all together this time, pass overhead once more ; there is
Crimson-wing with them, but he leaves them and makes his way

to young animals of all kinds may have a most beneficial effect, an
we know of more than one aviculturist who has installed the systen
either by means of vita-glass or special electric lamps, into thei
aviaries.
Bone-weakness is very prevalent in young animals that are reare
artificially, especially during the winter months in our dull climate
and there is little doubt that this is accounted for to a large exter
by the absence of ultra-violet rays.
The application of artificial sunlight by means of electric lamp
made with special glass that admits the ultra-violet rays to tropica
sun-loving birds, should prove very beneficial, and the new Bir
House at the Zoological Gardens is to have such an installation.
For nearly six months a white Cockatoo has been living wild witi
a flock of Rooks in a park near Reading, so the Daily Mail informs us
It was formerly the pet of a lady living at Fleet in Hampshire, bu
being frightened by a dog, flew away, and is now as shy as the Rook
with which it lives quite happily.
The Editor of British Birds desires to make it known that his reader
have placed rings on the legs of over 170,000 wild birds during the las
seventeen years. Each ring is stamped Witherby, High Holborn
London, and bears a distinctive number. Any person finding a birc
bearing such a ring is asked to communicate at once details of the
number and the date and place of the finding or capture of the birc
to the address named, in order that its migration and other histon
may be recorded.
This system of ringing young birds has proved of immense value ir
adding to our knowledge of the migration of birds. Two Kittiwakc
Gulls ringed as nestlings, one in 1923 and the other in 1924, in the
Fame Islands, have been reported from Newfoundland in 1924 and
Labrador 1925 respectively.

In a recent consignment of birds from Mexico, received by Messrs,

amely the Crested Grey Bird ( Ptilogonys cinereus), a bird superficially
,jsembling the Clarino, but more closely allied to the Waxwings ; the
hick-billed Cardinal ( Pyrrhuloxia sinuata) : and the Mexican Barred

Sir, --The smaller Rails have always attracted me, and I am glal
to have had the chance of acquiring two species rare to Aviculture.
Limnopardalis rytirhynchus is given in the B.M. Handlist as hailir
from Brazil and Peru, though my four specimens are said to have coir
from Guatemala. Length, 9 inches ; olive green above, deep slat
grey below ; bill very long, pale green, spotted with red and bln
at the base.
The Black Rail of Africa, of which Mr. Gurney wrote last montl
is very attractive on account of its small size (7 inches) and neat shap&lt;
I have two pairs and a baby, from Messrs. Gamage's collectior
Although not an authority on the keeping of Rails, I believe the
are pretty hardy, wanting a soft floor covering such as peat-mosjj
plenty of branches to climb amongst, both indoors and out, and a sma
pond fringed with coarse grass and rushes to induce them to nest
which apparently they do readily. A coarse and not too ric!
insectivorous food with boiled rice and potato and a little raw mea
seems to satisfy them.

Sir, --Some time last July, Messrs. Chapman brought over a larg
consignment of these birds. Amongst them were a number havin
a good deal of black on the face and throat. Our Editor in the Augus
issue of the Magazine suggested that these were wild-bred hybrids
between the Nyasa and Black-cheeked Lovebirds. In order to tes
this theory I procured two pairs of the darkest-faced birds I could find:
These have nested several times but unfortunately no young have beer}
reared, but strange to say they have now entirely lost the black oi|
the face and could not be distinguished from birds of the normal colour!
Does not this do aw T ay wuth the hybrid theory ?

young aviary-bred Nyasa Lovebirds and some show no dark coloui

The fact would seem to be that the Black-cheeked and Nyasa

Sir,&apos; --Among the birds I have kept at liberty this winter is a young
Je King Parrakeet in immature plumage. As his companions of
} same species are adult and much taken up with matrimonial
airs, he has associated a good deal wflth a Barraband, a playful
ungster with tastes similar to his own. Lately he has started to
itate perfectly the calls of the Barraband. Most of the larger
rrakeets possess to a greater or lesser degree the faculty of mimicry,

iguage while living at complete liberty wdth others of his own kind.

Sir, --With reference to Lord Tavistock's letter in the February
mber of the Magazine, suggesting feeding delicate birds like Bee-
pers throughout the winter on cluster flies. I have used these flies
years for certain birds, with, I am sure, most beneficial results :
're is a quick and noticeable result in the condition of my Crimson-
;asted Shrikes, to give only one example, when they have them.
Lord Tavistock says, the flies are very easily captured when they
ier the house in the autumn, which in my case they do in swarms,
1 I easily keep them alive in the small wire meat safes, which one

isture I get over by placing a small sponge in a saucer, which it
st exactly fit, of water. In this way the flies cannot drown themselves

find them so charming that they can only marvel at the indifference
the rest. When it is realized that all Owls are beautiful, many quite
rdy when once acclimatized, long-lived, and easily kept in health
d perfect plumage, quickly become tame, and are often warmly
;ached to their keepers, their many merits should establish them
tnly in the affections of bird lovers.
As a rule their requirements are simple. My Owl's aviaries are merely
oden structures of various sizes with wire-netting fronts. The small
icies have their houses wired underneath as well, for fear of rats,
stump or two and some perches of various sizes with the bark on are
that is necessary inside with a barrel or box in the darkest corner,
il the floors are thickly strewn with coarse gritty gravel. Owls need
pty of room if they are to do themselves justice. An ideal position is
|e facing south, under large deciduous trees. During summer the
es provide the necessary shade, and when the leaves are off the birds
ve the benefit of any sun which may be granted us, and are protected
m north and easterly winds. If they have a dry abode and are safe
m draughts (this is very important) they do not mind cold weather
long as their food is not frozen. They should be given a bath, for

though certain species have no use for water in any form, most of then
especially the Wood Owls and Pigmies, are great bathers.
The staple food of all my Owls is rabbit, preferably wild ; they thru-
on it and do not seem to tire of it ; but of course they do better if tliei
food can be varied. Large species thoroughly enjoy a plump rat ncr
and then ; birds, drowned kittens, and mice are appreciated by thei
all, though I have found that they soon tire of mice if they are supplie
in quantity, but as a titbit now and then they are eagerly taker
Small Owls appear to be largely insectivorous. Pigmy and Scops Owl
are mostly fond of cockchafers, though there are exceptions. My he
White-faced Scops (Scops leucotis) will catch and eat as man
cockchafers as are turned into her aviary, but the male bird will nc
touch them. I have several times induced a sick bird to feed by givin
it cockchafer larvae, hand-feeding and even cramming it until it wa
strong enough to feed itself.
Owls are not often on the sick list when they are properly house
and fed, but care must be taken until they are acclimatized. Tropics
or southern species are much easier to manage than Arctic or Norther
kinds, the latter being very susceptible to cold and damp. The hens ai
rather subject to egg-binding after they have been some years in cor
finement. The best, if not the only remedy, is heat. All kinds nun
have fur or feather in some shape. Owls pair for life, and are usuall
very faithful and affectionate. They begin to take an interest in eac
other as soon as the moult is over, and by early spring are generall
ready to go to nest. Eagle Owls nest in a scrape made by the male bir
on the ground ; Burrowing Owls either tunnel into the earth for then
selves or take possession of and adapt some other creature&apos;s burrov
Wood Owls like hollows in trees, as do also certain Scops and Pigm
Owls. Some kinds like a tree from which the top has been blown of
and nest on the stump. The male bird digs the scrape or burrow o
carpenters at the chosen hollow, and when the hen is incubating o
has young it is his business to cater for the family while she stays an
guards her eggs or young. It is pretty to see the male return with hi
prey and alight by the nest and give his mate what he has brought
She feeds the young while he watches with the utmost pride and delight
Incubation lasts four weeks, and the young are usually white or gre;

Jen first hatched ; some resemble their parents as soon as their
I thers have grown, others have an intermediate plumage which often
ers considerably from that of the adult, which they do not attain until
j second moult. The larger kinds do not breed until they are three years
nore old ; they lay two eggs in a clutch, and may have two to three
tches in a season. Incubation starts as soon as the first egg is laid,
l with some species the second clutch and even the third may be laid
ore the first brood has left the nest, so that it may contain at one
e fledgelings, newly hatched young, and fresh eggs. Pigmy and
&amp;gt;ps Owls often lay three or more eggs in a clutch.
In confinement Owls usually seem willing to go to nest, but the eggs
often infertile ; in all probability one great cause of this is want of
, ;rcise, for Owls are mostly rather sedentary birds, unless spurred by
s necessity of hunting for food, which does not exist in an aviary,
other cause may be inbreeding ; the pairs which come over are
quently taken from the same nest, and unless a sufficient
mber arrive at once to ensure a thorough shuffling, in all probability
)ther and sister will be sold together and very few fertile eggs will
ult from such a union. If they do hatch the young Owls must be
b to themselves as much as possible ; the less they are looked at the
ter. Interference generally results in the young being devoured
their parents.
When all goes well, the young remain in the nest until well feathered,
lally about a month ; for the first week or ten days the mother broods
jim continually and scarcely leaves the nest at all, unless to defend
inn against some real or fancied enemy, for this she will do to the
nost of her power, choosing death rather than desert her offspring,
r While they have young to feed, the old birds live very sparingly,
t make up for it during the autumn when they fatten themselves
in preparation for cold weather.
European Eagle Owl (Bubo maximus), found throughout the
mntainous districts of Europe. Very large fine-looking birds, with
lg ear-tufts, feathered legs, and beautifully variegated and
rmiculated plumage in shades of brown, black, and tawny, with a
lite patch under the chin. Their irides are orange. Their call is a
, e, bell-like single hoot from the male, usually answered by his mate

with a double hoot pitched much higher. These Owls are very lonr
lived if properly treated. They have beeu bred ; they are all the bette
for a fast day once a week ; quite hardy and very fond of bathim;
They nest in a scrape prepared by the male, the clutch consists of tw
large round white eggs ; incubation lasts four weeks. The youn
have no intermediate plumage.
The Virginian Eagle Owl (B. virginianus and B. articus), fror
South and North America, which are smaller and differ slightly togethe
with B. ascalephus from North Africa, are generally imported, as ar
also the following : B. bengalensis, from India ; B. capensis, fron
South Africa ; B. cinerescens, from West and East Africa ; B. lacteus
from South Africa ; B. blakistoni , from Japan.
The Spotted Eagle Owl ( Bubo maculatus), from South Africa, i;
the smallest Eagle Owl; a handsome bird, particularly the form wind
is grey, thickly spotted all over with black. There is also a browr
variety, in which the spots are not as plentiful nor so distinct looking
The ear tufts are short and broad, beak strong and black, eyes bright
buttercup yellow, legs covered with grey down, claws black. Quit(
hardy, it is not very particular as to diet and not a very large feeder
It nests in a scrape on the ground, and lays two eggs to the clutch
Its note is a soft hoot, almost a coo. It is fond of bathing.
Fraser's Eagle Owl (Bubo poensis), from West Africa. A very
beautiful and distinct species, not often imported. In the intermediate
stage has a white downy head and breast, the back fawn colour mixed
with white, and black barred shoulders. Wing-coverts fawn. The
flights and tail yellow-barred black. Adult plumage : Head, wings,
tail, and back tawny yellow, barred with black, long ear-tufts of the
same ; breast white, finely barred with black ; legs the same ; claws
white ; eyes large and full, deep soft black, fringed with very long lashes.
Length when full-grown about 17 to 20 inches. It is not very hardy,
and requires a sheltered aviary with protection from cold in winter.
Its diet should consist of rabbits, young rats, mice, etc. It is very fond
of bathing. If kindly treated it becomes very tame, and fond of its
owner, but is capable of strong and lasting dislikes, and is jealous of
other birds. It likes to have its head scratched like a Parrot. The two
white eggs are laid in a scrape on the ground. Among sand or dried

ble hoot.
The Scops ( Otus ) are miniature Eagle Owls, possessing longer wings.
;ey are charming little birds, with beautiful plumage shading into
^;ry tone of brown, grey, and black, and are easily kept and bred in
ifinement. They are largely insectivorous. They are found all over
* world, save in Oceania. The plumage of many species varies between
lividuals.
The Common Scops ( Otus scops), native of Europe, is too well known
need description. It is enough to say that owing to its small size
1 docility it is a favourite cage bird. We have only space to
imerate the various species of Scops which figure from time to time
our aviaries : 0 . pennatus, from India ; 0. semitorques, from Japan ;
bakkamoena, from India, and its varieties lettia, from China, and
ipiji, from Indo-China and the Malay States ; 0 . asio, from North
nerica.
White-eared Aerican Scops (0. leucotis). These beautiful little
*ds are not quite hardy and cannot stand damp cold, but thrive
rfectly in an enclosed unheated aviary. They are about the size of a
ng Thrush, have large faces, white cheeks, and grey beaks very thickly
vered with long white hair, hiding the nostrils ; crown of the head
ij speckled and vermiculated with black and a black outline round
3 face. The eyes are large, glowing copper. The breast is streaked
3.y on white, legs white, feet large, lead coloured, back and wings
eaked and mottled grey and black. The general effect is singularly
autiful and rich. They have the curious habit of bowing rapidly
my times in succession while uttering a continuous husky chattering
ind, this appears to denote pleasure, and is used to greet friends,
3 offer of food, or merely in answer to a word in passing. The breeding
il is a soft grunting coo, and the anger note a savage growl. They
end most of the day dozing on a high perch, and if disturbed open
eir wonderful eyes to the fullest extent and lunge forward at the
emy with open beaks, at the same time swearing like an angry cat*
can easily be guessed that a squirrel or any other enemy coming
ddenly upon them in a tree would get the fright of its life when con-
)nted with such threatening gestures.

Probably they nest in a state of nature on a lofty tree whose t(
has been blown off, but in my aviary they adopted an enamelled ir&lt;
pie-dish filled with sawdust, laid two eggs, one of which proved addle
and reared a young bird. Incubation lasted a month, during which t
male collected and carried food to his mate. When the young hatch
the hen was very fierce, and flew straight for my face when I fed hi
The nestling was covered with greyish white down, and remained
the dish for four weeks, by which time it was well feathered. Its c.
for food was a low hissing croak, and it did not bow like its parei
until after it could feed itself and was quite independent. Its pluma
was like its mother's ; the cheeks were grey instead of white, the ba
darker and breast greyer. The ear-tufts did not show until it was qu
well feathered everywhere else.
These Scops never bathe nor apparently do they drink. I have nei
seen them dust, but they are always snowy white and speckless. Li
all of that genus they are enormous feeders, and cannot fast like otl
Owls. They cannot digest rats or very old rabbit, are fond of bir&lt;
mice, which last they usually swallow whole, and field voles, also you
kittens. They are not often imported.
Cyprean Scops (0. cypreus). These lovely little birds are pecul
to Cyprus, and are strictly protected. My pair were hand-reared a
brought over by the late Major Horsburgh ; I have never heard of a
others being imported. Their plumage is full and very soft, all shades
soft grey, beautifully mingled until they look like a piece of lichem
bark; eyes black. They are tiny creatures. My pair were very tame a
accustomed to be hand fed ; they had very large appetites, w
particularly fond of mealworms and cockchafer-grubs, and would gi
down seven or eight full-grown ones at a meal--no small feat for si
tiny birds. They also had mice, Sparrows, or chopped-up rabbit, 1
preferred the two former. They proved fairly hardy, and came saf
through the winter in a sheltered aviary with a box to retire into in 1
weather. They were very silent, but occasionally uttered a low cr(
' when hungry. They bathed occasionally.
The Wood Owls ( Asio ) are of medium size, have well-develo]
facial disks, and long ear-tufts.

Lcommon in fir-woods in England. It is rather smaller than the
iwnv Owl, and more elegantly shaped. Its face is round and
namented, with two long erect ear-tufts. The eyes are orange. The
ound colour of its plumage is brown, but it is beautifully streaked and
ottled in the most protective style, so that when it sits motionless
*essed close up against a fir-tree trunk with its eyes closed it is
,:ceedingly difficult to discern even if the observer is looking directly
it. It nests in hollow trees ; there are usually two young in a brood,
hunts chiefly by night, and is a friend to the farmer, since it destroys
great many mice and rats. It is vociferous, and has a variety of notes,
reams, mews, and other noises. It does well in confinement.
The Short-eared Owl (A. accipilrinus) is another European
)ecies, it frequents marshes and moors, and nests on the ground. It is
ightly larger than the above, and carries short thick ear-tufts. The
&apos;umage is rusty brown, mottled with dark brown. Eyes yellow. It
idures confinement well.
The Brazilian Long-eared Owl (Asio clamator) has only lately
een imported. It is larger than the English kind, and very handsome,
robably it has much the same habits in its natural state ; in con-
nement it is fairly docile and lives well; is fond of bathing. Is drowsy
y day, and usually feeds at dusk ; is fond of rats, mice, and birds,
ut will eat rabbit. The back and long wings, which project beyond
le tail, are yellowish brown mottled and vermiculated with pale black,
he belly rather bright buff, also the legs and feathered feet; toes long
nd slender, claws black. The breast is yellowish, with a large dark
entre to each feather. When young the facial markings are very
,bribing ; the head is buff, bright chestnut, with a faint black spot
ist over the eyes ; cheeks darker, but still bright chestnut; a broad
&apos;hite stripe forms a St. Andrew's Cross between the eyes down to the
lack beak ; chin white, with a few black spots ; the whole enclosed
y a thin black line ; ear-tufts very long ; eyes black. In voice and
abits it is very much like the English Long-eared Owl. Is quite hardy,
nd thrives on the same food.
The Brazilian Short-eared Owl (Asio stygius), from Brazil, is
arely imported. It is an exceptionally beautiful bird of very elegant
hape, the size is about the same as a Barn Owl. Its colour is golden-

brown, with a dark centre to each feather. Ear-tufts short and thic
face very round, eyes black with a bright golden ring. Mine was a greed
rather lazy bird, and was all the better for a weekly fast. It bath(
occasionally, and was crepuscular in its habits. Its call was a shar
rather melodious " wow ", several times repeated. It never becan
really tame.
A. grammicus, a closely allied species, has been brought over.
The African Swamp Owl (Asio nisuella), from North Africa ar
South Spain. Quite a number were imported by the late Mr. Hamh
in 1921. They varied very much in character ; a female which I boug]
has never become at all tame or tractable, but a young male was ;
tame as any bird in my collection, and very playful. It is dark chocola
brown, with dark brown eyes. Some have short ear-tufts, which usual
lie flat but can be erected. The beak and claws are black. It is qui
hardy and lives well on rabbit with an occasional bird or mouse. T1
note is a harsh loud squawk or bark, frequently repeated. It
crepuscular.
The Fishing Eagle Owls ( Ketupa ), with long ear-tufts, are to 1
found in Asia and the adjacent islands. They may be known by the
long and very powerful, almost bare, legs. They live near watercours
and feed on fish, but in captivity they will thrive on meat, and are lon :
lived.
From time to time K. ceylonensis has been imported. It is four
from Palestine to Indo-China ; also K. ketupa indigenous to the Mala
Peninsula and the Sondian Isles.
The Scotopelia only differ from the above in not having ear-tuft
They are natives of Africa. S. peli and S. oustaleti have been imported
The birds of the genus Huhua differ from those of Bubo in haviu
transverse stripes across their breasts. They are very handsome, ar
four species have been imported. H. shelleyi from the Gold Coast
H. nipalensis from the Himalayas ; H. orientalis from Malay ; an

ptivity, and has been bred, but needs care.
The Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata), from South America,
also known as the Downy Owl, and is a very distinct and handsome
ecies. It is perhaps the most easily tamed of all Owls, being very
id of having its head and neck scratched like a Parrot. This
arming bird is larger than the Tawny Owl, has a black face with white
spectacles " round the bright yellow eyes, and a white beak thickly
nged with hair. The top of the head and back are brownish black,
tl and wings brownish black faintly barred with grey ; breast, belly,
d legs bright tan, claws black. It has a faint white half-circle round
e front of the throat. Perfectly hardy and easily kept in health,
ad of bathing. Nests in hollow trees. The call of the male in the
eeding season is a kind of rattle, rather like a miniature machine-
n, at other times a gruff sort of growl, and a gentle twitter when
eeting its friends.
Young birds have the top of the head white and a black mask over
e face, the breast much paler, and the back and wings brownish
intly barred. They should be fed like the foregoing. All too rarely
sported. Anyone fortunate enough to own one of these delightful
rds should house it where it can enjoy human society, as it soon
opes when it is left to itself.
The genera Ninox and Sceloglaux form a group of small Owls which
e probably widely spread over Asia and Oceania. They do very well
confinement, and some of them, especially the Australian species,
&lt;ve been imported from time to time.
The Marbled Owl ( Ninox ocellata), from West Australia, is now
ry rarely imported. It is a pretty little bird, about the same size as
"e Little Owl, gentle and confiding in an aviary. The plumage is
11 and very soft, general colour dusky brown, breast lighter, and
heaked with warm brown. The wing-coverts and the scapulars are
* marbled &apos;&apos; with roun^l wdiite spots ; the eyes are greyish but sometimes
'aen the light catches the pupils they look as red as rubies. A dark
-tch just behind the eyes adds very much to their beauty. They are

aootk-skinned caterpillars and those large brown spiders which live

among rubbish. They nest in hollows and lay three to four rather lar&lt;
white eggs. Their call is a double hoot, wdiich sounds very much lil
a Cuckoo gone flat. They are great bathers, and should be fed like tlj
Tawny Owls with the addition of insects when obtainable. My coo
bird is 17 years old this summer.
As far as I know, the other species hitherto imported are N. boobon
and N. connivens, from Australia ; N. novai zeaJandice and Sceloglai
albifacies from New Zealand.
The Tawny Owl ( Strix aluco ) is a widely spread, very well-know
bird commonly distributed throughout England and Europe. It
round-headed, the plumage very full and soft. Its colouring is shades &lt;
brown and tawny, breast paler, all finely mottled and vermiculated

black, beak greyish or horn-coloured, legs feathered with grey dowj

Hand-reared specimens become very tame, and can be allowed the
liberty at night, returning to their aviary for the day. They nest i
hollow trees or in barrel-shaped boxes, have from two to four your
in a brood, and nest twice in the year. They are great bathers, an
perfectly hardy. Their food in confinement should be fur or feather, bi
they are not dainty.
Sharpe's Wood Owl ( Strix nuchale), from West Africa. Anoth&lt;
very handsome species, a typical Wood Owl, round headed, with blac
eyes and cinnamon coloured plumage. Its habits and requirements ai
similar to the Tawny Owl. It is not often imported, but appears to 1
quite hardy and becomes very tame. It is a size larger than th
Tawny Owl.

i image delicately marked with grey, brown, and white.
The Little Owl [Athene noctua ). Acommon speciesontlieContinent,
is introduced into England by the late Lord Lilford, and has become
turalized. It is gradually spreading all over the country and has
v^en rise to much controversy, many people considering it a dangerous
st, others protesting that it destroys more vermin than game, and
ould therefore be protected. It is a small bird, rather larger than a
irush, grey, thickly speckled with white ; its eyes are round and
iring, rather pale yellow, eyelids white. It is very active, bobbing up
d down in a ludicrous manner when it sees anyone approaching. It
mts by day and destroys a great many birds as well as mice and
;etles. It nests in holes and there may be three or four eggs to the
atch. It has a variety of calls, ranging from chuckles to loud shrieks,
terspersed with cat-like mewing. It has been bred in confinement,
n allied species from India [A. hramah) has likewise been imported.
Burrowing Owls (Speotyto cunicularia), South America, are
: *casionally imported and make amusing pets. Their habits are well
lown from many illustrations and articles. In America they share
arrows with " Prairie Dogs " and (possibly) rattle-snakes, and bob
a and down excitedly at the approach of a stranger. They are about
le size of Athene noctua , but stand higher, being longer in the leg.
heir heads and backs are speckled brown, the wings brown barred
ith white, as is also the tail. Under parts and legs pure snowy white,
j i spite of their burrowing habits. The young have brown heads without
1 ay markings. The eyes are bright yellow, beak pale. Their call is a
arsh croak, but if disturbed or alarmed they spread their wings and
i ireech loudly for several minutes on end. They also " swear ", which
Hinds like a tap being suddenly turned on. They run very swiftly,
[y pair constructed a burrow in their aviary but did not go to any
j. feat depth, and the soil fell in several times until I put a drain-pipe
j Lside the burrow. They worked hard at deepening and enlarging it,
ad finally started nesting. To my regret the hen died egg-bound
ith her third eg&amp;quot;. The cock lived many years longer, but I was unable
) get another mate for him. They are quite hardy, and do well on
ibbit and other fur and feather. None have recently been imported

species inhabiting California and Central America (S. hypogcea) has bee
imported.
The Sparrow Owls ( Glaucidium ) are tiny birds scarcely larger tha
a Sparrow.
The Passerine Owl (G . passerinum). Mountains of Europ.
particularly Switzerland. They have no ear-tufts and are much moi
diurnal and active than the somewhat lethargic Scops. They are grei
bathers, very quick in all their movements, eaten up with curiosik
and interested in all that goes on. They have rather long tails, whic
they wag from side to side, while they bob up and down with excite
chirps. Their eyes are light yellow, head and back dark brown thick]
speckled with lighter spots and marks, wings brown with a reddis
tinge on the flights, with paler bars, tail the same ; the feet are heavil
feathered, claws black. The eyes are ringed with pale grey and the ey&lt;
brows and facial disk are white, as is the beak. Breast light grey, wit
dark streaks. They need a good deal of exercise, and should be give
a larger aviary than their diminutive size would indicate. They ai
hardy in the South of England. They should have Sparrows and mice.
Mexican Pigmy Owl (G . Jisheri), habitat Mexico. About tt
same size as the last, and with much the same habits and colourin;
but closer feathered. A bold, fierce little creature with bright yello
eyes. On the back of the head, which is brown with small speckles,
has a curious grey-brown crescent-shaped mark. The unpaired mai
during the breeding season utters a metallic clinking cry, like the soun

imported, but last year several pairs came over. Mine went to nest i
a wooden nest-box, and sat steadily for four weeks, but either the eg#
were clear or went bad, as thev did not hatch and the birds did awa
with them when they had sat their full time. Food and treatment shoul

Besides the above, the following species have been imported :
&apos; plialoenoides, from Trinidad, and G. perlatum, from South Africa.
Photodilus badius . which inhabits the Himalayas, is a small brown
d, which forms a link between the preceding groups and the Barn
Ids. It has been brought over alive.
The Barn Owls ( Tyto ) differ from all other birds of prey in their
itomy. They chiefly inhabit barns, belfries, or caves in cliffs, and are
*eedingly useful in destroying rats and mice. They are to be met with
over the world.
The Barn Owl {Tyto alba ) is a very beautiful bird, having yellowish
ray plumage mingled with silvery grey, and lightly marked with
all black spots. The under parts and breast are snowy white. The
ial disk is well developed, the eyes are black and deep-set; the beak
;ite and partly covered with a thick fringe of hair, legs rather long and
3ck-kneed covered wdth white down, claws black. It is entirely
iturnal and therefore not very interesting in an aviary. It is
mailer, closer feathered bird than the Tawny. It nests in a barn or
low tree, and it is not uncommon to find fresh eggs in the nest at the
ine time as young birds. Barn Owls do not bathe and appear not
drink often. They utter a loud screech and sometimes a hissing
1. They will eat rabbits, rats, and mice, etc., and are quite hardy.
|ey have been bred in confinement. These are most useful birds to
mers and countrymen, as they destroy enormous numbers of rats
1 mice, and are too nocturnal to take chickens or young birds,
ich are all under cover by the time the Owls start hunting.
Other species which have been imported are : T. pratincola , North
lerica ; T. delicatula, Australia ; T. punctatissima, Galapagos
inds ; T. capensis, South Africa, and T. arfaki , from New Guinea.

Some time last November Mr. J. Bruce Chapman, to whom v
aviculturists owe so much, for his enterprise in bringing over so man
rare birds from all parts of the world, imported a fine consignment fro 1
the port of Vera Cruz in Mexico. Amongst these were about a dozcj
of the little Lark Sparrow (Chondestes grammacus strigatus), which i
secured. This little bird has the upper parts brownish grey, streakc
with blackish and the under parts white, the head prettily striped wit
grey, white, and chestnut. Its habitat is California and Westeij
America, but it apparently finds its way also into Mexico, unle
my birds should prove to be a sub-species resident there. Some of m
specimens have the throat and breast washed wdth yellow. I notice
when I bought them that some of them had a small spot of yellow on til
throat, and thought that these would be the males, but on dissectic
this has proved not to be the case. I have examined all the skins:
the British Museum and none of them show any trace of yellow, an
I cannot recollect ever having seen any with this marking in Californi
where they were quite common. I am hoping to get them to brec I
this year, and may then be able to find out something more about therj
Another interesting bird was the Dickcissel (Spiza americana) &lt;
Black-throated Bunting. This is a pretty bird, and hardy. The upp
parts are mixed grey, browm, and black ; chin and throat white, wil
a black patch in centre ; breast bright yellow. I secured two or tlm
specimens, but I am afraid all males, and these are now in full son
This species was bred by Mr. Teschemaker a good many years agoj
In this consignment were quite a lot of Thrushes, of which I bougli
about a dozen. I found on getting them home that there were thro
different species, but it took some time to separate them, as the
were in such rough condition, some of them being almost denuded j|
feathers through fighting. The most interesting was a Wood Thru*
(Hylocichla meistelina). This little Thrush is very like our own bir-
but is not much more than half the size. It is a native of the L.SA
migrating to Mexico in the winter. I think that my bird must be
hen, as it has made no attempt at singing yet. Another Thrush turne

Early in January Mr. Chapman had another important con-
tinent of Mexican birds, amongst them being, I think, several
cies new to aviculture. The most interesting is the Rose-breasted
&apos;dinal, a bird that I am inclined to think will be found to be a new
*cies. These birds are about the same size as the Common Cardinal,
jb are totally unlike them in colour. They differ in having the crest
(f, a patch on the cheeks buff, a patch under the black throat yellow,
I the abdomen pink. About eighty came over, besides a lot of the
mmon Cardinals, including a good many hens, but as the latter had
p been separated from each other, it was impossible to say to which
the two species these belonged. It has been suggested by some
lithologists that these birds are merely immature specimens of the
mmon Cardinal, but I cannot believe this, as this latter bird has bred
more than one occasion in this country and the young are said to be
e the hen. It is my belief that the birds are adults, and this seems
be borne out by the fact that a bird imported last year has not changed
our. However, Mr. Chapman is taking steps to bring over some more
;h the females, and then we shall have a chance of breeding them
1 learning something more about them. In the meantime, they appear
be lacking a scientific name. 1 Another interesting importation was
it of the Thick-billed Cardinal, and I secured a true pair of these,
eir scientific name is Pyrrhuloxia sinuata sinuata. They appear to
very closely allied to the Cardinals. Their colour is dark grey, with
ed crest and tail, under parts bufhsh pink or red, the hen not so
ght in these parts. Their most curious feature is the beak, which is
y short and thick, like that of the Bullfinch, hence one of the trivial

as well as in Mexico, and its habits seem to be very similar to those
the Red Cardinal. They appear to have a rather peculiar body scei
similar to what one finds in the Petrels. I do not know whether this h
been previously noted. I also secured half a dozen specimens of t
Californian Scarlet Tanager, which differs considerably from t
common Scarlet Tanager, more usually seen in this country. The co

also. I do not think that it has yet been bred here in captivity. Anoth

our Brambling. These are mostly black and yellow, but are not yet 1

think that any of the birds mentioned in these notes have been br
here, so I am looking forward to an interesting season in my aviari
this year.
Just as I had finished writing these notes I recollected one speci
that I had not mentioned, and that a not unimportant one, the Mexico
Barred Partridge ( Philortyx fasciatus). This is a small bird, about t
size of the Scaly Quail ( Callipepla squamata ), and its habits appe

Now that the breeding season is once more upon us, some notes
;he management and breeding of Lovebirds may not be out of place.
i genus Agapornis belongs to the sub-family Palseornithinae, and as
as is known at present consists of ten members : (1) the Madagascar
drey-headed (A. ctina) ; (2) the Abyssinian (A. taranta) ; (3) the
l-faced (A. pullaria) ; (4) the Rosy-faced or Peach-faced (A.
icollis ) ; (5) the Black-cheeked (A. nigrigenis ) ; (6) the Nyasa (A.
mice) ; (7) Fischer's (A. fischeri) ; (8) the Masked (A. personata);
Swinderen&apos;s (A. swindereniana) ; (10) the Black-collared
zenkeri).
he first six are all well known ; Fischeri and the Masked are
jeedingly rare and swindereniana and zenkeri have not yet reached
country alive. The genus is confined to the continent of Africa, and
w adjacent islands. Once acclimatized, they are all very hardy, and
be kept in unheated outdoor aviaries throughout the year with
ty, provided they have good, dry, draught-proof shelters. They
simple feeders, and no elaborate mixtures are needed ; most are
shed with canary seed and white millet, with the addition of a little
te sunflower and a few good oats, millet sprays, and seeding grasses
very acceptable ; hemp should be avoided, except sparingly in
7 cold weather, as it appears to make them fat and sluggish. Fruit
11 kinds is despised by most, a few, however, will eat apple and pear
linute quantities ; some will eat lettuce with apparent relish. When
hble they should be kept in aviaries, as their chief charm lies in the
they climb and scramble about, besides which their full beauty
ily seen wdien in flight. In cages they are apt to mope at their loss
berty and become dull and listless, sitting side by side and taking
j little interest in life in general, only moving to visit the seed and
er-pots. If, however, no other accommodation is available, and it is
red to keep a pair of Lovebirds, possibly Red-faced are the most
able, being the least active of the group ; Mr. W. T. Catleugh

The nest-box illustrated is eminently suitable for Lovebirds, and wi

The Madagascar or Grey-headed Lovebird is probably the best
lown of the group, having been imported in enormous numbers for
me years. No detailed description of this species is needed : it will
tffice to say that the cock is distinguished from the hen in having the
hole of the head, neck, and upper breast grey, and under wing-coverts
ack, whereas the hen has the head and under wing-coverts green,
he first importation was in 1860, and a pair was on view at the London
lological Gardens in that year. They are quite unsuitable for cage life
id when thus kept, as a rule, crouch in a corner and utter harsh
olding notes whenever anyone approaches. In an aviary they remain
*ry timid, and seldom get really tame. Madagascars are very spiteful
ith weaker birds, especially when thinking of nesting, the hens more so
lan the cocks. They associate well with Budgerigars and Passerine
arrotlets, with only occasional sparring. They do best in an aviary
y themselves, however, otherwise in mixed company, especially if
ley are at all crowded, they are liable to play at nesting. In the wild
ate they associate in large flocks, often as many as a hundred together,
id sometimes do considerable damage to the rice crops. The nest is

' bark, carried under the upper tail-coverts ; this method of carrying
laterial is usually adopted in captivity, but some carry pieces of bark,
dinters of wood, fragments of millet sprays and strips of leaves in their
saks. The hen alone usually cuts the bark, etc., and carries it to the
est, the cock meanwhile keeping guard. A nest-box similar to the one
lustrated is usually accepted by this species, although some shun boxes
f any kind, and lay their eggs anywhere but in the proper place,
irs. Charrington had a pair some years ago that burrowed under a tub,
)ntaining a box-tree, in an aviary where they constructed a nest in the

: leaf. The first nest contained clear eggs; they nested again,
lit with the same result. The eggs of Madagascars vary considerably
i size, the average being 18&apos;4 mm. by 13&apos;8 mm., and the number from
&amp;gt;ur to six or even more. Incubation seems to take nineteen to tw T enty

Fully adult plumage is donned at the first moult. The first to be success
ful in breeding this species in Great Britain was F. W. Oates, who ha&lt;
four young reared in 1900. In this case the hard-worked hen wa
deserted by the cock for a Passerine Parrotlet, but she managed to rea
the brood alone nevertheless. Amongst others to be successful wit)
this Lovebird may be mentioned the late Dr. Lovell Keays, the lat
Mr. Wesley T. Page, Mr. W. Shore-Baily, Dr. P. Gosse, and Mrs. F. G
Hedges. Aviary-bred birds are apt to be delicate, many suffering fron
a form of asthma. The Marquis of Tavistock states that " Madagascar
breed freely at liberty, but in a state of freedom are liable to becom
paralysed in the legs ". The reason for this is not known, as aviary bird
do not suffer in this way. Madagascars may be left out all year wit]
perfect safety, provided they are not allowed to roost in the open a
they are susceptible to lung trouble.

That tropical and semi-tropical birds can be accustomed to ou
British climate is generally recognized. But as a rule there is sonn
qualification attached to this statement, such as special accommodatioi
or feeding, so perhaps an account of how some of the common anc
less expensive seed eaters have been wintered on this bleak south-wes
Lancashire coast, may be of interest to those readers of the Aviculturai
Magazine, who like myself, do not profess to be experts, nor wealth
enough to maintain large and elaborate aviaries.
My bird census on 15th September, 1926, was 64 birds of 22 species
All seed-eaters, such as Waxbills, Buntings, Finches, Canaries, Pekii
Robins, Whydahs, Weavers, Siskins, etc., all reasonably priced bird
that one might experiment with.
My census to-day, 30th March, 1927, is 56 birds, 24 species (I bough
6 birds in January, 4 Lavender Finches and 2 Avadavats, thus increasing
the kinds by 2). The losses are 19 all species, 9 from pneumonia, 4 fron

Id age, and 6 from attacks by other birds, egg-binding or accident,
*uring the six months I have bought 6 birds, the natural increase being
, these are Silverbills and Zebra Finches, 3 and 2 respectively.
The conditions under which my birds are kept were described in
le October, 1924, Vol. II, No. 10, Avicultural Magazine, but I
light state that with the exception of an oil lamp kept burning during
pe months October to date in the shelter, the birds have had no other
rotection against the damp and cold of this last winter.
They are fed on a mixture of canary, hemp, white millet, Indian
lillet, sunflower and teazle, together with soft food made of Spratts
ad liver oil and softbill foods, to which is added maw seed.
They get unlimited supplies of greenstuff, mostly garden weeds, etc.,
nd the floor of the flights are grassed.
They can sleep inside or out as they choose, for though the shelter
indow is lowered, it is never closed. Fire Finch, Siskin,
Irey Singing Finch, Saffron Finch, Orange Weaver, and one pair
Zebras have slept out all winter, and seem to prefer to do so, whatever
he weather. The Javas, Whydahs, Nonpareil Buntings, and Cordon
Ileus are more discriminating, and go indoors if the weather is stormy.
Pekin Robins, Canaries, Combassous, Silverbills, Lavenders, Waxbills,
nd Fire Finches prefer the warm bedroom.
I don't know if my losses from pneumonia are due to the change of
emperature from outside to inside, but I don&apos;t think this is entirely the
ause, for the shelter is seldom more than 50* F. and in frosty weather
} as fallen to 40*. I rather put them down to the fog and damp we get
o much of here, along with cold damp winds. The losses from old age
Ve are all liable to, for we can seldom tell the age of an adult bird
jvhen bought. I generally look at the length of the upper mandible,
nd the state - of the tarsus, but this method is not infallible. All
hese four birds were in splendid plumage and condition.
The murders and accidents were preventable. A Green Singing
&apos;inch cock was responsible for three ; he wiped out the Siskin family,
ather and two sons, and himself died of fright when I caught him
fter the event. The other two were egg-binding, which I should
I j
iave seen to earlier. The moulting times are the critical ones so far

our reward in perfect plumage and greater resistive power. For instant
a cock Cordon Bleu which I have had three years is much mor
brilliant in colour and thicker in the feathers than others I have ha
only one year. The same applies to one of my Nonpareil cocks, he i
much brighter now than when I first received him. I wonder if an
one can tell me when a Nonpareil cock gets his adult plumage. I hav
a bird, bought as a hen, now showing unmistakable male colour. Thi
bird I have had two years, bought in July, 1925.
The Pekin Robins are in excellent fettle, and are busy with domesti
duties, as are some of the others.
A cock Combassou gives the Whydahs a very anxious time ; he wi
not allow them to feed at the same time as he and his wives, am
though, of course, they are much heavier birds, he goes for them lik
a terrier ; with this exception, since the Green Singing Finch cod
deceased, the inhabitants of the aviary get on well together.

Sir, --Cannot the Avicultural Society do something to improve th
conditions and management of Public Aviaries. At a few aviaries
have visited in the north of England there was a deplorable lack o
interest shown by those responsible for the stocking and managemen
of these aviaries. A man is put in charge of an aviary who know
nothing about birds and he has to take instructions from Towi
Councillors who know less.
At one place I saw Pheasants being kept in a glass house in whicl
were Parrots and monkeys. A Silver Pheasant hen was laid on th
floor and had lost the use of its legs. I asked the keeper why it wa
allowed to live in that state, and he told me that he could not do any
thing without instructions from the Borough Engineer.
At a seaside place I visited they have some ideal aviaries wit!
running water in. In one of the aviaries were a few Canaries and a Goldei
Pheasant cock in a dilapidated state. In another was a Silver cock to(
fat to walk with a pure-bred Amherst Pheasant hen, a rather scarce
and valuable bird to be wasted.

Even what is supposed to be a Lancashire Zoological Garden has no

In my opinion it is the duty of every member of this society to offer
5 ice and help to the councils who own public aviaries.
In two cases my advice has been accepted and an improvement
t taken place.
There must be aviaries in other parts of England where advice is
: ded. I think a list of all public aviaries should be published in the
) ?azine and reports sent in by members of the birds kept and their
: ditions. It cannot be any help to aviculture to have birds shown
. ier such wretched conditions.
An official letter from this Magazine suggesting that some member

It has been many times in France, as Delacour has written in 1

because the parents were troubled by other large birds, which liv
in their aviary (Glossy Starlings, Jays, etc.).

irds in the National Zoological Park at Washington ; he says the
may be considered very unusual in captivity and none too common
wild state. It is represented in their collection. The dealers from
far west do not know the bird.
have never seen a parrot more affectionate or playful than this
with my young son, aged 7. He is restless or noisy until Warren
3ars, when he utters sounds which most certainly express affection,
ortunately he does not talk, but the various sounds he makes are
: ising. He delights in crawling all over the boy, snuggling in his
and kissing him on the mouth (when permitted). He follows him
it like a dog, with a queer shuffling gait, and shaking his tail from
to side.
The plumage since his moult is beautiful, and of a rich mossy green
nr, and the red variations are brilliant. When the wings are spread,
yellow area is quite conspicuous. I do not think the bird can fly
! , as when he flaps his wings one does not open as fully as the other,
there is no suggestion of deformity when the wings are closed,
should like to sell the bird, as the family will be away the greater
of the summer, and I have other plans for the fall. I am offering

identification is based on a comparison with the mounted specimen

aders know that all the large weavers of the genus Hyphantornis,
\0x25A0 tagra, etc., only build their nests of long strips of palm leaves, etc.,
Inch they tear from the tree. They cut a small incision at the base
the leaf, then holding a piece of the leaf above the cut firmly in their
: ;aks they fly away, thus tearing a long narrow strip from the leaf,
ith this they make their wonderful hanging nests. Dry grass, leaves,

A NEW RACE OF BARNARD'S PARRAKEET

By the Marquess of Tavistock
The plate of a new race of Barnard's Parrakeet which Mr. G.
Mathews has named after my wife, Barnardius crommelince, has been
lone from a female bird imported by Mr. Frost some years ago and at
present living in my collection. The locality where it was captured
ippears unknown.
Barnardius crommelince differs from the ordinary form in its wholly
green breast. There is only a small patch of yellow on each side of
he neck in place of the almost complete half-collar and the general
hade of the plumage is a very pronounced blue- green.
[The following note on this bird, by Mr. Gregory M. Mathews,
appeared in the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club of 4th
November, 1925 (vol. xlvi, p. 21) :--
" While inspecting the aviaries of the Marquess of Tavistock, I was
.struck by the appearance of a Barnardius somewhat like Barnardius
mnardii Vigors and Horsfield, but noticeably without the yellow band
&amp;gt;n the lower breast--which, in my opinion, is a new species.
" It is as large as barnardii and richly coloured, with an abundance
uf blue, the cheeks being only less blue than in whitei ; entire breast

blue-green ; the yellow collar only faintly indicated by a small yello
patch on each side of the neck ; crown of the head pale green a dar
Y-shaped mark of dull blue-green at the back of the head ; red front;

Mr. Chapman is to be congratulated on having at length succeede
in importing several pairs of the very fine Masked Lovebird (Agaporm
personata ) from Tanganyika Territory. It is perhaps the most strikin
of the group, and, so far as I am aware, has never previously been offere
for sale in this country, if indeed in Europe. The only specimen
that have previously reached this country were three that Mr. Painte
brought through London on his way to the United States in 192f
as recorded in this journal for June of that year.
This species, in which the sexes are alike in colour, has the fac
blackish brown, a very broad collar on the nape and breast of yellow
the upper breast reddish orange, the wings, back and under part
green, and the upper tail-coverts ultramarine blue. The bill is brigh
red and there is a conspicuous ring of whitish skin round the eye.
Mr. Painter had no difficulty in breeding those he took to America
and there is little doubt that this species will prove to be a good breede
like the Black-cheeked and Nyasa Lovebirds.
Mr. Chapman's Tanganyika consignment contained a few othe
birds, two of which were new to Aviculture, namely the Blue-heade&lt;
Waxbill ( Urceginthus cyanocephalus) , which may be described as a Cordo]
Bleu with a red bill and the blue extending over most of the head
And the Buff-crowned Whydah ( Linura fischeri), a small and ver;
dark-coloured Whydah with a distinct buffish crown.

Agapornis taranta
The Abyssinian Lovebird has never been very popular with avi-
turists, probably because it is considered quarrelsome and very
inclined to reproduce its kind. Although it had been described
My a hundred years previously, it was unknown in the living state
England until the late Mr. H. D. Astley brought a pair from Italy
July, 1909. This pair was given to him by a lady who apparently
ught them quite common ; they were part of a small consignment
ich reached Genoa in November, 1908. A few had been imported
p Germany two years before, but had gone to the aviaries of an
ktrian enthusiast. Mr. Astley's pair formed the subject of a plate
he Avicultural Magazine, Third Series, Vol. I, No. 1. Abyssinians
lained scarce until 1923, when they started to come over in fairly
&apos;e numbers, and are now readily obtainable. The mortality in
dy-imported birds is very heavy; they usually arrive in a very poor
;e, crowded in filthy cages, and it is little wonder that disease is
ipant. In many cases they are entirely devoid of feathers on the
d. I once had the misfortune to see the survivors of a very large
ection : they were all in an exceptionally bad way and died in
ens during the few days following their arrival in England from
Britis and kindred troubles. In this case cocks and hens alike
e absolutely bald, in addition they had developed cannibalistic
lencies. It is common for the cocks to nibble and pluck the crimson
hers from the foreheads of each other, but these had long passed
3 state, and when a bird fell from a perch through weakness, several
Id immediately attack the unfortunate, and after putting it out
ts misery, eat the major portion of its head. Fortunately birds
orted direct by the English dealers do not arrive in such a shocking
e, but only the birds from Continental dealers, who are not as
icular as the majority of our importers. If newly-imported birds
obtained they should be kept moderately warm and given soaked
et and canary seed for a week or so, they can then be accustomed

Mrs. Prestivich--Lovebirds
to the staple diet of canary seed, white millet, oats and white su
flower, the last named they are especially fond of. Their water f
the first few days should be slightly tepid. If the plumage is very soil
they may be sprayed with lukewarm water after they have had tiij
to settle down provided they are kept warm and given an opportune
to dry thoroughly before dark. They should not be put out doc I
until the beginning of May, unless the weather is exceptional. Thj
will settle down very rapidly and are very hardy. A dry draught-prc
shelter is absolutely essential, as A. taranta , in common with all ti
other members of the family, cannot stand draughts or damp. T
Abyssinian is the largest of the group, but is not very active and rati
shy. They have rather pretty notes, sometimes resembling Peach-fac
Lovebirds, and sometimes the cock has quite a twitter, after the fashi
of the Bengalese. No difficulty is experienced in sexing this speci
as the cock has a cap of the richest crimson, which is wholly abse
in the hen. Nevertheless, breeding successes recorded in Engla
are few, but several have been reported abroad. The late Mr. Asti
stood a very good chance of being successful with his original pa
as contrary to general experience they showed signs of desiring
nest almost immediately after their arrival. Unfortunately the cc
was unable to climb out of an exceptionally deep nest-box, which
had been exploring ; he was not missed for several days, and it v
then too late. The unmated hen laid eggs the following year.
1925 Mr. W. Lewis claimed to be the first to succeed in Great Brita
The old birds took to a husk towards the end of June and laid f(
eggs, which they duly hatched, but only reared two young, which w
like the hen when Mr. Lewis disposed of them at three months c
Incubation was thought to take sixteen days. Soon after Mr. Le&apos;
had made known his success, Mr. Alfred G. Groves, of Bath, clain
priority. In response to a request by the Editor for particula
Mr. Groves wrote as follows : " The Abyssinian Lovebird bred 1
year left the nest the second week in June. The parents came from
late Mrs. Dalton Burgess' collection. Three eggs were laid, but oi
one was fertile and the youngster remained in the nest for a k
period " (A.31., Fourth Series, Yol. IV, p. 190). So it would seem tl
the honour of being first goes to Mr. Groves. In both cases det;

u*azine, June, 1926, to which members should-refer. The account
question is a translation from the German publication " A.Z." and
acerns the experiences of Herr Ed. Schlitze. The following extracts
3 for the benefit of new members who may not possess this number :
Che hen appeared to be incubating at the end of January, 1925.
i inspection on 17th February showed three almost round eggs,
the 23rd two young had hatched, the third egg being fertile. Size
eggs 23&apos;18 mm. Incubation period about eighteen days. The
n alone fed the young for about the first week. The young were
nost feathered by 16th March, looked out of the box for the first
he on the 19th, and the first left the nest on the 29th, the second,
ir days later. Both resembled the female, except the red of the
jak was paler ; both proved to be females. On 9th April the young
gan to feed themselves, but were still fed by their parents; 27th April,
ung independent, though still fed occasionally until 4th May. For
!3 first few weeks the young birds were given soft food, containing
ts' eggs and hard-boiled egg; on this food they thrived and later took
eating seed, especially millet. A very interesting point observed was
it these birds built no nest as other Lovebirds do, but the female
lcked the feathers from her breast with which to form a nest founda-
n." This was not the first occasion on which Abyssinians had been
id on the Continent as Neunzig (p. 715) writes : " In 1906 some were
ported by an Italian dealer and came into the possession of an
.strian aviculturist. They bred, two young were hatched, which were
ly coloured at ten months old. In another brood three young were
xehed." Another account of the successful rearing of this species,
t this time in America in the aviaries of Mrs. J. Bamfields, of Los
geles, appeared in the Avicultural Magazine of August, 1926.
n 1925, four eggs were laid, but only one youngster reared to maturity.
1926 four eggs laid, three hatched, two young reared. The eggs were
1 on a nest made of pieces of paper and canvas which they pulled
the front protection of their cage. This pair is in an aviary with
ne Softbills, and Mrs. Bamfields reports that they partake greedily
the mealworms and gentles intended for the other birds, and believes
it her success is partly due to this insect food." It will be noted that

Mrs. Prestwick -- Honey-Guide Death Lure
both Herr Schiitze and Mrs. Bamfields provided insect food and bot
have been successful, so it would seem that this species benefits 1
the provision of a good insectivorous mixture. In the wild state tl
Abyssinian is said to make use of the nest of a species of Weaver, j
the same way as the Peach-faced is said to use the nest of the Social)
Weaver bird. As regards its life in the wild, Heuglin says {Ornithology
Nord-Ost Africas, pp. 747-8) : " It usually lives in families of three l|
eight individuals, most abundantly in the so-called Woma-Ded
(7,000 ft. above sea-level), yet it descends to the lowest limi
of the Abyssinian olive-tree and the Qolqual Euphorbia, and |
Semien and Wogara we still met little parties at 9-10,000 f
altitude. The isolated companies lead a tolerably independei
life, but keep close together among themselves. They affect tl
crowns of the higher trees, especially of Juniperus and the Chandeli
Euphorbiae ; at the season of the ripening of the fruits of tl
Cordias and Sycamores they also settle upon them. The call-no
consists of a shrill, at times chattering, chirp, very like Agaporn
pullaria. The males when in flight often utter a sharp pfiff. The fligl
itself is usually high, straight and humming ; these birds also clin
with great facility/' Heuglin thinks the pairing season must be
midsummer.
Abyssinans are given a very bad name as regards their quarrt
someness, but they agree fairly well with other members of the genu
Softbills they ignore, but it is not safe to associate them with smi
Finches, etc., especially at breeding time. Two pairs of Abyssinia -
should on no account be kept in the same aviary unless it is of vei
exceptional size.

3 recent daily papers, and possibly some wondered to what bird this
erred. The following extracts are taken from .Newton's Dictionary
Birds and throw some light on the matter :--
" Honey-guide, a bird so called from its habit or supposed habit of
inting out to man and to the ratel ( Mellivora capensis) the nests of
es. . . . Yet Mr. Layard says ( B. S. Africa, p. 242) that the birds
11 not unfrequently lead anyone to a leopard or a snake, and will
low a dog with vociferations, 1 so that at present judgment may
rhaps be suspended on the matter, though its antics and noisy cry
[questionably have in many cases the effect signified by its English
me. If not its first discoverer, Sparrman, in 1777, was the first
10 described and figured this bird, which he met with in the Cape
&amp;gt;lony, giving it the name of Cuculus indicator, its feet with the toes
aced in pairs--two before and two behind--inducing the belief
at it must be referred to that genus. Vieillot in 1816 elevated it to
e rank of a genus, Indicator ; but it was still considered to belong to
e Family Cucu idce (its asserted parasitical habits lending force to
at belief) by all systematists except Blyth and Jerdon, until it was
own by Mr. Blanford and Mr. Sclater that it was more allied to the
ipitonidce (Barbet) and, in consequence, was then made the type of
distinct Family, Indicatoridce. ... In the meanwhile other species had
;en discovered, some of them differing sufficiently to warrant
mdevall's foundation of a second genus, Prodotiscus, of the group,
he Honey-guides are small birds, the largest hardly exceeding a Lark
size, and of plain plumage, with what appears to be a very Sparrow-
ke bill. Captain Shelley in 1891 (Cat. B. Br. Mus., xix, pp. 1-12)
;cognized nine species and one sub-species of the genus Indicator,
id two of Prodotiscus. Four of the former, including I. sparrmani,
hich was the first made known, are found in South Africa, and one
Prodotiscus. The rest inhabit other parts of the same continent,
ccept I. archipelagicus, which belongs to Borneo and Malacca, and
xanthonotus, which occurs on the Himalayas from the borders of
fghanistan to Bhotan. The interrupted geographical distribution
f this genus is an instructive fact.&amp;quot;

A possible explanation of the antics of the Honey-guide is giv
by a correspondent in the Daily Mail , who writes, " A honey-bird w
lure a man to a tree where there is a snake because the snake is in t
vicinity of its nest. My brother had an experience of this sort,
honeybird led him to a tree and fluttered round the stem where!
snake was coiled. My brother shot the snake, and the honey-bil
cheerfully settled on its nest."
Perhaps some member who has had personal experience with til
genus would give his observations.

If it had not been for a shower of rain William and I would not hai
met, which would have been William's loss. I will explain. Wanderil
one day in the Bush, in search of new birds, I encountered a show]
(they are called showers in that part of the world where 4 inch!
of rain in an hour is no uncommon thing, but in England it woul
have been called a torrential downpour). So not wishing to retra
my steps 7 miles in a soaking condition and swim a swollen riv
I sought shelter for the night at the homestead of a friend a few mill
away. When the ever-welcome pot of tea was brought in by a dusll
chef, a small feathered creature dropped on to the floor from somewhel
out of the said gentleman's attire and protested forcibly as it hoppl
across the floor. This was William. There was a general scrambj
and I caught him first ; then the dusky " gentleman " protested--tl
bird was the only titbit for the evening to augment the monotony of tl
usual mealie pap--but as possession is nine points of the law as they sal
I stuck to William and he spent the night under a wire meat covl
and was regaled with a diet of flies mixed with golden syrup. Till
was how William and I met.
Now the reason that I stuck to William was--because he was a vel
rare bird, far from common even in his native haunts. His other narj
was the Yellow-throated Honey-guide, his proper name Indicaf\
major.

The Honey-guides, only three species of which I have studied
heir native haunts, the Sparrman's Honey-guide in Mozambique,
Scaly-throated in Gazaland, and the present species in Mashona-
1, are quiet and unobtrusive birds, living in the thickly-wooded
;h and seldom obtruding themselves upon one's notice unless there
i; bees' nest in the vicinity ; then matters are reversed, and upon the
lj it of a human being, either black or white, the bird gets into a great
 |e of excitement, flying round within a few yards and uttering its
!i iously loud cry ; if it sees that one intends to follow, the bird will
\ from tree to tree a few vards ahead of one until it eventually reaches
nest. When it does actually reach the nest it utters an entirely
. erent cry to the one which it has been uttering whilst it has been
I ling one on.
It is always the custom to leave a portion of the comb for the bird
i payment for its services. The natives have a superstition that if
jf does not leave anything for the bird, the next time they follow
I, loney-guide it will lead them to a poisonous snake. It is a fact
1} t these birds do lead human beings to snakes as several of my friends
\0x25A0i r e proved, but this is done no doubt with the object of getting someone
&lt;: kill the snake, for undoubtedly these birds possess a large share of
elligence, as I proved by my pet.

To get back to William, the native who caught him said that
ever a Honey-guide drinks water it gets intoxicated and he fou
this bird " drunk " on the pathway leading to the native store. I thi:
that this nigger must have belonged to the local branch of tj
R.S.P.C.A., for instead of breaking the bird's wings and legs as tj
natives always do whenever they find a bird (I have known nath
to catch birds and treat them thus, leaving them all day in the boili i
sun so that they would be fresh for the evening's meal, cruelty beij
inherent to the African nigger), this fellow only cut its wing feathers oj
William had an insatiable appetite. I am sure that he ate seven
times his own weight in a week, even if the last grub was hangij
out of his mouth, because there was no more room inside, he won
call for more. We fed him on all manner of soft insects and honevcom!
J [
This is a very easy matter in a country where insects abound and wi
bees' nests are found everywhere. But hard insects and artific
food he would not touch.
There is a certain kind of hornet in the tropics which is a gre
asset to the amateur bird keeper. It builds large mud nests on the wa
of rooms, usually preferring the kitchen where it is extra warm. The
nests consist of from one to thirty compartments, the hornet la!
an each one and then stuffs it full of green caterpillars or lar
spiders, which it renders in a state of suspended animation by 1 1
injection of some subtle preservative, and as the hornets are continual
building these wonderful nests, there is provided a never-ending supp
of food, and upon the contents of these nests William was regale
If the egg in the hornet's nest had hatched and the insects were eat

TWO RARE WEAVERS

A few of these beautiful Weavers were brought down from the
tterior of Tanganyika Territory in Central Africa by my friend
'r. Schulz, and given to me in the spring of last year at Antwerp.
I have never heard of their being imported before, and there is
ery little likelihood of their ever having been brought to Europe
efore, for they are rare even in the very remote part where the}
)me from, and as notes on rarely imported birds are asked for I
enture to send these very meagre ones.
The Reichenow's Weaver is rather a large bird, and at first sight
light be mistaken for a small Oriole, and this is accentuated by the
ict that the beak is not at all Weaverlike, being thin, long, tapering
nd glossy black.
The birds were caught on a volcano where Mr. Schulz makes his
drican home. In size they are rather larger than the Black-headed
Veaver (Hyphantornis nigriceps), but more slender in build.
They made delightful aviary birds, exceedingly active and cheerful
n demeanour, also very tame and confiding, always ready to take
aealworms from out of one's hand even though they were in a large
utdoor aviary.

These Weavers are mainly insectivorous in a state of freedom, an
eat very little seed. On board the ship they killed and partly ai
several of the rare Black-thighed Weavers that were confined to th
same cage ; they also plucked all the yellow feathers from out of th
cock birds, and greedily devoured minced raw meat which was pi
into the cage for other birds. In captivity they eat a great deal &lt;
soft food and many mealworms.
In the aviary they spent most of their time searching the bushc
and the ground for insects and weaving, but they never made a perfec
nest. They moulted out into perfect specimens, but alas ! they wei
killed at the end of the summer by the wretched cats chasing ther
on the aviary at night.
In colour the Reichenow's Weaver is bright golden yellow on th
whole of the lower parts, somewhat greener on the flanks, the feathei
having a remarkable satin-like texture in the living bird, the uppe
parts jet black, the lower back and tail olive green, the wings marke
with olive yellow ; the iris is white, which gives the bird a very crui
expression, as indeed it deserves. There seems to be a seasonal chang
in which the front half of the head changes to golden yellow.
I hope to receive some more of these birds later this year.
The Black-thighed Weaver (Pyromelana capensis
xanthome laena)
This very pretty little Weaver seems to have been seldom if eve
imported, though it may have been confused with its very near all}
the better-known Cape Black and Yellow Weaver (P. capensis), ;
bird that it closely resembles and which it replaces north of the Limpop
River in South Africa. When in breeding plumage the male is velvet
black all over except the shoulders and lesser wing-coverts, which ar
bright yellow, and a broad band on the lower back which is brillian
golden yellow; the feathers are elongated and cover the wings ii
repose ; there is also an irregular line of white in the centre of th
abdomen ; the legs are black, also the upper mandible, the lower on
is white. The hen is much smaller than the cock, and is the usua
streaky brown with no trace of yellow. I bought my birds on th&apos;

land of Mozambique on the East African coast. I bought them with
-enty other birds for the sum of 6s., including the cage !
These Weavers are very conspicuous objects in the landscape in
e regions where they live owing to their brilliant coloration and
*mparative tameness, though they cannot be called common. In
, te breeding season each male takes possession of a certain area, either
irt of a reed bed or one of the huge anthills wdiich are covered by
dense tangle of tropical vegetation composed of thorn bush, reeds,
iparagus fern, etc., but always in the vicinity of water. Here he reigns
5 a little king with his harem, chasing any other bird of the same or
lied species from the immediate neighbourhood.
When in full plumage the male has a very peculiar " slow motion "
ight. He first puffs out his feathers until he resembles a black and
olden ball and appears to be twice his real size, and then sails with a
range jerky motion very slowly from bush to bush, and upon alighting
ach time utters his harsh rasping song. He is usually so engrossed
ith his performance that he takes very little notice of human beings.
Although the males are so much in evidence the females are very
eldom seen, for upon one's approach they slip away quietly into the
ense undergrowth, the male meanwhile chasing first one and then the
ther.
These birds feed upon the seeds of weeds, grasses, etc., and also
mall insects.
The nest is like that of the Scarlet Weaver, a most beautifully
 |roven structure of fine texture, attached to several reed stems. The
j ggs, five in number, are pale blue.
Out of the breeding season, a few join flocks of other Weavers when
hey can at once be distinguished from the others by the yellow lower
j &amp;gt;ack and wing-coverts, this colour being retained all the year round.
The majority of the birds, however, do not wander very far from their
! seeding haunts.
These Weavers are quite charming birds in captivity, lively and
; dvacious, singing the whole day long their rather harsh and rasping
[ &apos;Ong.
They are wonderful nest builders, having constructed many perfect
, lests exactly resembling those built in the wild state, and if I had only

left them long enough in my outdoor aviary doubtless they would ha\
nested, but I was compelled to take them indoors for the followin
reason : morning after morning to my great chagrin I found th
bodies of my beautiful Weavers stiff and cold on the ground, first od
and then another, all apparently in perfect health and feather, an
I only discovered the reason when three out of my twelve birds wer
left: it was that arch-enemy of all bird keepers, cats. The brutes ha
climbed over the aviary all the night, causing the birds in their fright t
batter themselves against the wires. The more the birds fluttere*
the more the cats chased them ; but this year I have a sure remedy-
arsenic and kippers !
Indoors the birds still continued to build, and at the present momen
the remaining hen and two cocks are still building perfect nests.

Aviculturists may be able to give us some light on this subject
since by breeding from abnormal birds they often throw light on tin
heredity or otherwise of variations. Their experiments have oftei
shown that a sudden variation or " mutation " is either inherited
completely or not at all; this is the case, for instance, with the black
winged form of the Peacock when crossed with the common type, am
the young bird bred at the Zoo from a Zebra Curassow (Crax globicera
feminine mutation hecki) and a typical Globose Curassow cock was ar
ordinary Globose Curassow hen, figured by our Editor with its femah!
parent in the Avicultural Magazine years ago.
Yet yellow Budgerigars appear to owe their present far too strong
tinge of green and too pronounced markings to crossing with greens!
and I can well remember when Silver Sebright Bantams, as described
in Wright's Poultry Book a generation ago, had become straw-coloured)
by crossing with the golds, though the first crossing of golds and silver^j
reproduces the original colours truly, and true silvers have long age
been re-bred and are now common.
Moreover, I believe that I can see in some of the present light blue
Buderigars a tinge of green, and this mutation can be better likened to

did form than can the yellow, for the light blue Budgerigar corre-
&amp;gt;nds to the green very much as the Indian Grey Tit ( Parus major
ereus ) does to our Great Tit ( Parus major), the yellow element in
* plumage being eliminated in the Indian bird.
Do we know, moreover, that such mutations as the new and
eresting Dark Common Pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus, mutation
curus Hachisuka), of which latter a nice pen are now exhibited at the
d, will not ultimately produce intermediate forms if persistently
\0x25A0d back to the typical birds ?
# 0
If they did, we could envisage the production of sub-species as
ows : First the type produces a mutation, which, if isolated or
messing some advantage of constitution, character, or adaptation
surroundings, becomes a constant local form. Then it breeds back,
ough some extension of range, locally to the type, and intermediates
se, all such intermediates being, as we know them to be in the case
our common British Pheasants, in the case of which imported sub-
;cies have been crossed in, of hybrid nature.
If this be ever recognized and proved as a fact, it will reduce sub-
:cies to the level of full-species hybrids, and render it as unnecessary
load our museums with series of sub-specific forms as it would be
-v considered unnecessary to fill them with avicultural full-species-
orids, albimistic varieties, etc.
It may be argued that what I have been saying only concerns
our-forms, which are not now--and rightly in my opinion--regarded
full species ; but one gets the same intergradation where structure
concerned, as between the common Reed-Bunting ( Emberiza
oeniclus) and the large pale Bullfinch-billed Reed-Bunting of Central
a, which Sharpe actually put into a distinct genus, Pyrrhulorhyncha.
also separated the Flightless Moorhen of Tristan da Cunha as a
ius ( Porphyriornis ) from the common Moorhen, though it chiefly
uers in reduced wings and stronger and yellow-coloured feet.
Here also we can find a parallel in domestic birds. If anyone goes
one of our great poultry shows and looks at the Fawn Runner Ducks,
ich are the truest representatives of the Penguin Ducks studied
f Darwin, it will be seen that these birds differ from Mallard in much
!..&apos; same way as the Flightless Moorhen does from our bird. They

F. Finn--Species and Sub-species
are shorter-winged and longer and stronger-legged, and although il
so true to type as wild birds, they certainly have evolved incident
differences in coloration. The Drake is like a Mallard with subdu
colours, dark olive bill, olive-orange legs, deep bottle-green he;
dull grey body, dull wing-bar, the white neck collar reduced
absent, and the chocolate breast-patch paler and less well defin
The Ducks are usually warm fawn, with a bronze wing-bar instead
blue, black bills and pure olive feet, and the black markings of 1
plumage reduced to small longitudinal streaks even on the upper par
Most interesting is the fact that the Drakes not unfrequent
even when having only a small white collar or none, have white wi]
coverts like Wigeon, and that such white wing-coverts occasiona
appear in the Ducks.
Altogether these birds, although a domestic race, look remarkal
like a full wild species evolved by isolation where flight and swimm
were both at a discount. Yet if they did exist as wild birds--as so
fanciers actually imagine--and an invasion of Mallard took pi
in their home, interbreeding would no doubt occur and sub-spec
forms would arise.
I do not mean to imply that the structural points of the Flight]
Moorhen and Bullfinch-billed Reed-Bunting arose by sudden mutati
any more than Mallard parents could suddenly produce Fawn Run
j
offspring complete in all points--though I have seen a Mallard Dij
in Regent's Park with the Runner carriage ; the structural peculiarii)
of such birds have no doubt arisen by the adding up of such sn
variations as we know to occur by natural selection (the Runner Du
no doubt, was not deliberately bred to the shape it shows, poul
being usually compelled to forage for themselves in the East),
coloration of such structurally different races often does not di
much from that of the type, and has no doubt arisen incidentally
being correlated with successful structural or constitutional variatic
Yet when structurally different forms of recent common origin m&lt;
we can see that they interbreed just as colour-mutations do, as in
case of the Kaleege Pheasants.

mtus) with its grizzled back and streaked breast. These species

*e, drooping-crested, long-tailed, white-backed Silver Pheasant
nychihemerus) which certainly would not have arisen suddenly in its
aplete form from the Lineated. Yet it interbreeds both with this and
h the Purple where they meet--though about thirty species were
*e made of the hybrids, of which some (of the Purple-Silver cross) are
, even alike on the two sides of the body.
To be developed as distinctly as it is, the Silver Pheasant must,
ts infancy as a species, have been isolated from its fellows for a
isiderable period ; while extension of range has apparently brought
m together again, producing hybrid sub-species.
If this view be correct, all sub-species are simply mongrels ; and
l species are those forms which have been so long isolated as to have
/eloped a dislike to mating with their relatives when by some cause
y are brought into contact. This is evidently the case with the
Iden and Amherst Pheasants (Chrysolophus pictus and C. amherslice)
ich do not interbreed when wild, or even, though living in the same
mtry, haunt the same localities, being indeed enemies; yet
culture has shown us that they will produce completely fertile
brid offspring. Indeed, a captive sub-species has been developed,
most Amherst cocks nowadays show a touch of Gold blood, though
s comes out, curiously enough, in an excess of red, not of yellow,
the plumage, as well as in the breaking up of the black tail-bars.
How, then, does one recognize a true or full species ? I think
illace's definition--one that differs from another in more than one
nt--is very near the truth, but not quite exact, for intermediate
ms may exist between two of such, as we see in the case of the
leege Pheasants.
The decisive points must apparently be at least three, as we see
the case of the Ruffed ( Chrysolophus) Pheasants, which differ in
! our, structure of ornamental plumage, feathering of face, and note,
l have ceased to regard each other as kindred in the wild, though
y will mate when man pairs them, and still produce, as I have said,
 |te fertile offspring.

The diurnal Birds of Prey (Falconiformes) are divided into tv
sub-orders, the Cathartse and the Accipitres. The former contains tl
New World Vultures (Cathartidae) with its sub-family Polyborir
(Carrion Hawks) ; the latter the Secretary Bird (Serpentaridse), tl
Old World Vultures (Vulturidae), the Carrion Hawks, Hawks, Eagk
Falcons and their allies (Falconidae) and the Ospreys (Pandionidse). Tl
Accipitres alone consist of nearly four hundred different speck
Although the Raptores are not nearly so often kept in aviaries as mai
other species, still probably from their use in hawking, they were sor
of the earliest birds to be kept in confinement. Possibly also their som
what sombre colouring, and their general reluctance to breed, may al
account for the fact, that but few aviculturists go in for them, or
may be the difficulty of providing animal food for them, or aga
their reputed fierceness and untameable natures may be the reason
and yet they are an extremely interesting group, and if properly und&lt;
stood, are generally easy birds to feed and cater for. Many of the
stand confinement extremely well, and live to a great age, whilst ma
are perfectly hardy, and will become very tame, and as those who
keep them will know, possess a charm and interest quite differe
from any other class of birds.
It is quite impossible in a short article of this description to descri
all the various species which have been kept in confinement: I can or
give a short account of those which are more commonly seen, with
very brief description of their plumage. Owing to there being but
small demand for them, no numbers of any one species are import*
odd examples of all kinds of different sorts, many of them very scar
arrive at the dealers, and may or may not be sold.
In this article I propose to describe ( 1 ) suitable aviaries, ( 2 ) fo&lt;
(3) species which have been kept in captivity.
Aviaries
No Birds of Prey of any kind are suitable for cages, they must
housed in aviaries. It is quite a mistake to suppose that they
all hardy ; like all birds they will become acclimatized, and very ma

ill stand any amount of cold, but the smaller tropical and sub-tropical
&amp;gt;ecies are often very delicate and must be treated accordingly. To
3gin with, the aviary must be (for all species) in a sheltered place,
possible facing south ; it is nearly always useless to have an open
ight, with an elaborate heated house, as very few Hawks will go into
ich a shelter of their own accord. The aviary should be open only in
ont, and boarded at the sides, back, and over the greater part of the
)p ; for the more delicate species, the whole of the top may be boarded
id a glass front, covered on the inside with wire netting, fixed to the
ont of the aviary in the winter time. The size of the aviarv must
spend a good deal on the bird it is to hold, but personally I am in
ivour of large aviaries for the Birds of Prey : certainly for the bigger
ultures and Eagles they can hardly be too large, though I must admit
have seen large Hawks (Buzzards and Kites) kept in quite small places,
ad looking the picture of health.
The perches should be placed well apart and at some distance from
le ground, so that the bird must use his wings to get from one to the
ther. They should be of good strong wood, of different thickness,
ad I find pieces of cork bark nailed round the perches in separate
laces very much appreciated by the birds for standing on. A large
beady block of wood, a couple of feet high, let firmly into the floor
f the aviary is also much liked. It is a great mistake to
vercrow T d an aviary with perches, but there should always be one at
lie back, where the bird will get the most shelter. As regards the floor
f the flight, it may be covered with sand, but I much prefer the natural
arth : in some of my Hawk's aviaries half of the floor is of bricks,
i diich are certainly easier to clean, and as these birds do not spend
luch time on the ground, it does not appear in any way to affect
heir feet.
In an aviary of this description most species of Kaptores, with the
xception of the Secretary Bird, and the smaller and more delicate
ropical species, may be kept throughout the year.
Food

The all-important question of food is often misunderstood in the
hrds of Prey. All my Haw T ks, except the small delicate ones, are starved

can consume at a meal, all food left uneaten is removed. They are fed
once a day only. The best food is small birds, rats, mice and rabbits
and for the larger vultures horse flesh, fowls' heads may also be
occasionally given. Whenever possible it is essential that fur and
feathers should be left on ; as a substitute for natural feathers, tow cut
up into small lengths and mixed with the meat may be used. This
plan is, or was, carried out at the Giza Zoological Gardens, and appeared
to answer very well, though I must say I have never tried it. Birds ol
Prey are always lethargic in confinement and if they are to be kepi
really well and in perfect condition, the different forms of food foi
the various species cannot be too closely considered. It is ofter
supposed that all a Haw T k requires is a large hunk of flesh throwr
into its cage and left there until it is consumed. It is quite unnecessary
as many people imagine, to feed Vultures on carrion ; they do perfectly
well on fresh meat, but the bones should be given with the meat
The very small Hawks, tropical and otherwise, some not much large:
than Sparrows, are almost entirely fed on worms, beetles, moths, cock
chafers, mealworms, and pieces of meat cut up very small; other:
rather larger may be given small birds, mice, lizards, and small fish
in fact many Hawks of all kinds delight in fish occasionally. The da]
before I starve my birds I generally give them an extra feed, but no
always. Of course, when a bird is moulting he will require rather i
more liberal allowance of food, but by feeding as I have described
the majority of Kaptores may be kept perfectly well and fit.
As regards drinking and bathing, I have seen it stated that Hawk
never drink in confinement. This is incorrect. A pair of small Black
winged Kites ( Planus) I had were constantly drinking, and a Blacl
Vulture also occasionally did so. They are certainly not great drinker
as a whole, but should always have easy access to a large pan of fresl
water, and the same applies to bathing. It is, as a rule, better to kee]
the Birds of Prey in separate aviaries, even if they are the same specie
(unless one is especially trying to breed them), one is often stronger tha:
the other, and will take all the food : I think they do better also i
apart. Vultures and possibly the Kites, which have rather differen
habits, may, however, be allowed to live together.
I will deal first with the New World Vultures.

G. H. Gurney--The Birds of Prey
The Secretary Bird (Serpentarius Secretarius ) has been importer
and kept in captivity from the very early days of aviculture. Th&lt;
first specimen to reach Europe alive was in 1770 and many of the
early English menageries had specimens. The enclosure for a Secretary
Bird can hardly be too large, and in such a place, they will take t
great deal of exercise and keep themselves in good health ; the enclosurt
should be surrounded by a wire fence at least 10 feet high, with i
large dry shed facing south, the floor of which should be well coverec
with peat moss litter. Kept under these conditions they are generally
pretty hardy, and may be allowed out, except in the hardest weather
They are tremendous feeders, and a diet of rabbits, given broken up
but of course with the fur and bones, rats and small birds suits then
well, if given perfectly fresh, while they are very fond of hens' eggs
I shall never forget the excitement of three Secretary Birds at th&lt;
Buda Pesth Zoo, when five large live snakes were turned into thei
enclosure. They were promptly killed, but not immediately devoured
These birds have not yet been bred in captivity, but I believe a nes*
was made at the London Zoological Gardens more than once ; anc
there appears to be no reason w T hy they should not breed in a suitabh
enclosure, under favourable conditions. The sexes are alike, except ii
size, the male being somewhat the smaller. They inhabit Southern anc

Kolb's Vulture ( G . kolbi ) and Kuepell&apos;s Vulture ( G . ruepelli).
&amp;gt;th these species have occasionally been kept in confinement. A pair
Kolb's Vultures nested at the London Zoological Gardens in
oc ember, 1912. After incubation lasting for fifty-four days, the young
e was hatched, but was unfortunately devoured by its parents two
ys later. They are found in West and South Africa.
The Bengal Vulture ( Pseudogyps bengalensis) is another closely
ied species, which has been kept at the London Zoological Gardens,
d in one or two private collections. It often makes an extraordinary
rking noise and becomes very tame. The lower part of the back
adult specimens is white, remainder black.
Other species which have been imported from time to time include
e Pondicherry Vulture ( Otogyps calvus), the Eared Vulture ( 0 .
ricularis), and the Occipital Vulture ( Lophogyps occipitalis).
The Egyptian Vulture ( Neophron percnopterus). White, primaries
ick, naked head, and neck bright yellow. This is one of the smallest
the Vultures, and has often been kept in captivity. Though some-
lat of a morose disposition, I knew one which would come to the bars
its cage to be scratched and was perfectly tame. This species requires
day shed for winter. The two examples I have kept appeared to
d cold rather considerably, and I do not consider it as hardy in
nfinement as most of the other Vultures.
Hooded Brown Vulture ( N . monachus). Dark brown, tail black,
;ck covered with thick down of a pale brown colour. This
&amp;gt;uth African species occasionally finds its way into European
&amp;gt;ological Gardens, but I have no records of how long it has lived
captivity.

Sub-family I. Gypcetince
Tail wedge-shaped, feet and bill blue grey. The Bearded. Vultv
(Gypcetus barbatus). The magnificent Lammergier is greyish blacl
with white streaks, top of the head white, pale brown lanceolate plumaj
on the neck and lower parts. This species has been kept at Lilfoi
at the London Zoological Gardens, and at Catton by my grandfath
where one lived to a great age in a comparatively small aviai
It is, however, very seldom imported. It inhabits mountaino
countries bordering the Mediterranean, and extends through Centi
Asia to China, and is widely spread over Africa.

The Goshawk (Astur pa&apos;umbarius ). Above ashy brown, four da
bands on the tail, which is tipped with white, below it is barred with brow

generally be seen at the London Zoological Gardens and becomes vei
tame and quiet in captivity. Four other species of Goshawks (Astm
have occasionally been imported, they include the Allied Gosha w
(A. approximans ) from Australia, the Gambian Goshawk (A. tibialil
from West Africa, the Tachiro Goshawk (A. tachiro) from South Afric
and the White Goshawk (A. novce-hollandice ) from Tasmania. The latt*
is one of the most beautiful Hawks there is and a fine addition to ar
collection. Pure white in colour, with black bill, yellow cere and leg
and bright red iris, a wonderful combination of colour.
The Sparrow Hawk (Accipiter nisus). It is hardly necessary to giv
a description of this well-known species, which extends throughov
Europe, North Africa, into Asia, north of the Himalayas. It is not
desirable species for captivity, being always exceedingly wild an
fierce, and never becomes tame, even if taken when quite young froi
the nest. Small birds are the only food on which this species will til
well in confinement.
The Black and White Sparrow Hawk (A. melanoleucus) from Sout]
Africa is a handsome black bird, which had been kept at the Londoj
Zoological Gardens. The Pileated Sparrow Hawk (A. pileatus) and tl
Red-bellied Sparrow Hawk (A. rufiventris) have also been kept in coi

this bird in Continental Zoos, and it has been occasionally brought
Ingland. It has very long legs, and in a wild state haunts thick
sts near water. It is found in Central America.

with six black bars, under parts whitish grey. This splendid bird
been kept rather frequently. One lived for many years at North-
&amp;gt;s in quite a small aviary, it was out in all weathers and appeared to
erfectly hardy: it was in perfect condition when it died. It was fed
rely on rabbits. Like the preceding species it inhabits Central and
northern part of South America.
The Monkey Eating Eagle ( Pithecophagajejferyi ). For an interesting
i amt of this fine forest Eagle see a paper by Mr. D. Seth-Smith
tie Ibis for 1910, vol. iv, p. 285.
The Bateleur Eagle ( Helotarsus ecaudatus). Black, back and tail
: red brown, much crested, cere, lores and feet bright red. This
t conspicuous bird is often seen in confinement. It is one of the
tly frequently imported of the Birds of Prey ; and by reason of
listinctive colour will always command attention. Hardy, quiet,
becoming very tame, it is one of the most attractive of the larger
vks.
One that was kept at Northrepps followed its owner about every-
re like a dog, and nothing pleased it more than to join the chickens
n they were being fed, and actually pick up the corn which was
; ig given to them. It would occasionally throw a grain of corn up
he air in play, but it was never observed to swallow any. It never

Another Bataleur that I knew had the same habit as a Cara-Cara

The new arrivals at the Zoological Gardens include a very beauti
pair of Mot-mots from Trinidad presented by Miss Byatt. The spec
found on that island and Tobago, Momotus swainsoni, is somewl
smaller than most of the mainland forms and more brilliantly colour
and is recognized by its rich chestnut undersurface which extei
to the throat.
The Mot-mots are allied to the Bee-eaters and have very simi
habits such as that of nesting in holes in banks, and capturing th
prey on the wing, but the tail of the Mot-mot is unique. The t
central features are considerably longer than the others and wt
they are first grown they are normal feathers, but after a short ti
the barbs for an inch or so disappear, leaving the bare shaft with a t
or racquet at the end.

or Ion&amp;quot; it was supposed that the Mot-mot carefully trimmed its
o this peculiar shape after every moult, but both Mr. Beebe and the
\Ir. Astley have proved that at this particular part of the feather
arbs, where they join the shaft, are degenerate and brittle, and that
either fall off without assistance, or are assisted in the ordinary
iss of preening.
Whether further consignments of the Masked Lovebird will be
rted we cannot tell, but in any case the small collection that has
ed should be sufficient to establish the species in this country
ome years to come provided they are well looked after and prove
e free breeders. It would be as well if those members who have
red pairs of these would get into touch with one another with a view
,xchanging stock after the breeding season. It would be a great
if this beautiful species, now that it has come to us, should be
ved to die out.
n the meantime we shall look forward to publishing the first account
ie successful breeding of the species in captivity, and hope that those
mate possessors of these birds will not forget to keep careful
s of their nesting habits.
dr. Ezra's wonderful collection at Foxwarren Park contains at the
ent time no less than twelve species of Birds of Paradise, namely
Twelve-wired, Greater, Lesser, Count Raggi's, Red, Princess
*hanie's, Magnificent, Hunstein's, Wilson&apos;s, Lawe's Six-plumed,
lace's, and the Lesser Superb. Amongst the new arrivals are
Wilson's in perfect plumage, and one had not before realized what
onderful little bird this is, as those imported some years ago by
Pratt were none of them in such exquisite condition as these.

Sir, --As the possible originator of the statement that it is c

like to say that I quite agree with the Editor that a pair shout
happy in a flight cage 48 X 12 X 18 inches, especially if they were tui|

Lovebirds, or the small Broadtailed Parrakeets of the Redrump t

fixed perches, with no fresh twigs to nibble and no facilities for nestl

HARDIHOOD OF SOME COMMON FOREIGN BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998853058823529" page_id="58075621"  page_num="Page 174" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I read with much interest the article by Mr. Appleby in
May number, and thought perhaps a few observations on the sub!
of mortality among the less expensive foreign seed-eaters might bj
interest.
My aviary is absolutely unheated and is situate in Surrey. Unfo
nately the only choice of position was one facing north, and only
open flight gets any sun. The shelter is in two parts, one altogej
open in the front and the other screened off so that no cold v
can penetrate. The roof of this latter part is lined with loose stj
tucked under laths and that is the only protection from frost,
roof itself is a high-pitched gable. In this I have Orange-chee
and common Grey Waxbills, also Cordon Bleus, and the only de;
for three years have been from accident, such as flying against a bra,
or from old age. My Grey Waxbills were purchased in 1921, and tl:
out of four are alive and in perfect condition. I also have kept Z(
Finches, yellow and green Budgerigars, an odd Java Sparrow-
other hanged itself in a forked twig, and some Cutthroat Fine;

\0x25A0st the hen Zebra Finch also through flying into a twig, and have
:e removed the fatal branch which projected .across the opening
n the inner shelter to the covered part of the flight. Since then
re have been no more accidents.
The water supply is a cement and pebble pool in the open flight
l has to be freed from ice regularly in the coldest weather. The
1 supplies are in hoppers in the covered flight and consist of canary
:1 and Indian millet only. Green foods such as flowering grass,
:kweed and groundsel are freely given, but the latter is not much
&amp;gt;reciated. All is scrupulously removed when withered. The covered
ht is floored with about a foot of sand so that there is no damp.
I this dryness I attribute the freedom from illness of my birds. There
re some small bushes of wild plum, and a small sycamore in the open
\0x25A0t of the flight, more for the purpose of harbouring insects than for
/thing else, as I find the Waxbills and Cordon Bleus are very keen
catching small flies.
The wire roof of the open flight is pitched as high as possible so as
get all the sun that is possible, owing to the north aspect. I find
j Waxbills, etc., appreciate a cosy box with plenty of dry straw in it
a winter roosting place in the inner shelter. I may say this inner
her is not dark as there is an obscured window in it besides the
ening from the covered shelter shed.
I have come to the conclusion that when acclimatized the most
&apos;ious dangers to this class of birds are damp and draughts. Cold by
elf is not to be feared so long as the birds have plenty of room for
*ht.
These remarks are merely platitudes, but some beginner may perhaps-
:k up some useful hint.
W. W. Smith.

It seems a general trouble that the young of both Black-che
and Nyasas die in the shell, and a foundation of damp moss or otl
substance seems a remedy.
In the nest that I have designed, which follows usual shape,
perforated zinc bottom is used, to allow the damp air to percola
from a zinc tray at the bottom. In this tray is placed either dan
spagnum moss or sponge.
It should be noted particularly that the damping fluid shou
consist of a weak solution of Sanitas or other compound that w
prevent decay.

This is one of the most beautiful of the genus to which it belongs,
is confined to the island of Ceylon, where it is not uncommon in
forest-covered hills. It is very seldom imported to Europe, which
d be regretted.
In its native country this Parrakeet is said to associate in moderately
d flocks and to be noisy and restless, uttering a harsh "crake "
the wing as it dashes up and down the forest-clad glens of the
Ion mountains. It is said to be very partial to the wild fig.
The coloured plate renders a description of this species unnecessary,
bird figured is a male, the female being very similar in colouration,
somewhat duller with the bill dusky black.

The White-Shouldered Eagle (A. adalberti). Crown of h
black, upper part of neck sandy-brown, upper parts black, entire ur

many years. They were obtained from a nest in Spain by Lord Lilf
in May, 1872. One of these Eagles was killed by an accident when ah
twenty-three years old, the other died from natural causes in Decern&apos;
1916, after forty-five years in captivity.
Other species of Eagles ( Aquila ) which have been kept in conf
ment are : the Spotted Eagle (A. clanga), habitat South Russia, Per
and India ; the Wedge-tailed Eagle (A. audax), habitat Australia ; i
the Vulturine Eagle (A. verreauxi), habitat South Africa.
The White-tailed Sea-eagle (Haliaetus albicilla). Gener;
brown, tail white, the fully adult plumage is not attained in this spe&apos;
until it is nearly six years old. Most of the Sea Eagles appear to do a
in captivity and, though not often imported, specimens may gener;
be seen, of one species or another, in Zoological Gardens, and occasion;
in private collections. This species is generally distributed over
Old World. The American form {II. leucocephalus ) and II. leucogas
the closely allied Australian species, have also both been kept in confi
ment. II. branickii , the Corean Sea Eagle, and H. leucoryphus,
Fishing Eagle, have been represented at the London Zoological Gardt
The Vociferous Sea-eagle {II. vocifer). Head and neck and eni
breast pure white, tail white, remainder of lower parts rich chesti;
primaries black. This very handsome species, although so comn
all over East and Central Africa, does not appear to be often import
though it has been kept at Lilford and in one or two other places.

The Rough-legged Buzzard ( Archibuteo lagopus). Light brown with

basionally be seen in captivity, and I have had two or three at one
!ie or another. Like all the Buzzards, they vary very much inter se :
jne birds become remarkably tame, while others appear never to
le their natural wild habits. This well-known species frequently
purs in Great Britain in the autumn, is common all over Northern
crope, migrating south in the winter.
The North American form, A. sancti-johannis , has been kept at the
, ndon Zoological Gardens.
The Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo), I suppose the commonest of
the birds of prey in confinement and one of the easiest to cater for.
\0x25BAthing comes amiss to them in the way of food and many live to a

I have never seen this species drink. It is perfectly hardy and
pears to be long-lived in captivity. In a wild state this species feeds
ely on snakes. It is found all over Central and Southern Africa.
The African Buzzard (B. desertorum ) and the Augur Buzzard (B.
jur), the latter a very handsome bird, are both brought over occa-
jnally, and have been kept by several aviculturists, while the
lowing species have been known in captivity. The Long-legged

Two Crowned Harpys were kept at Catton many years ago. It
a powerful and savage bird, very much of a carrion feeder. It ran^
over the greater part of South America.
The Black-necked Buzzard (Buteogallus nigricollis). Chestnut w;
black markings, head grey, remainder of the body black. Anotl
rare species from Brazil, solitary examples of which, however, ha
once or twice been brought alive to England.
The Brahminy Kite ( Haliastur Indus). Chestnut with darker wim
head, neck and lower parts white, streaked with black. This Inclii
bird is sometimes seen in captivity. Its flight is wonderfully easy a
buoyant; one that was kept at Northrepps spent the greater part j
its time on the ground in preference to a perch. This form has co
paratively weak feet. Two other closely allied species of Haliasi
have been imported, viz. II. intermedice, the Javan Brahminy Kil
and H. sphenurus, the Whistling Kite.
The Red Kite ( Milvus milvus). This noble bird still breeds, thanks i
strict preservation, in Britain. Centuries ago it was common even!
the streets of London, acting as a scavenger. Its broad wings ai
deeply forked tail are always distinctive when it is seen in the air.

The Black Kite ( M. migrans). Above dark brown, tail dark brown,
lining to rufous at the tip, head and throat whitish, under surface
ous brown. This species has been known to live twenty-two years
captivity, and is frequently seen in collections of birds of prey. It
found in Southern and Western Europe, accidental in England, the
i ater part of Africa, and probably extends into Central Asia. The
sely allied M. cegyptius is also imported.
The Black-winged Kite ( Elanus ccendeus). Above ashy grey,
ehead and sides of face white, wings grey and black, tail grey-white,
ier surface pure white, iris brilliant carmine. This very beautiful
1 distinctive little Kite is an admirable bird for an aviary. I brought
ee back alive from East Africa, and have never kept more attractive

The Sociable Marsh Hawk ( Rostrhamus sociabilis). Slate-grey all
?r, wings blackish, iris red. This very aberrant form has been
sorted a very few times. It feeds entirely on shellfish, and its
raordinary long slender bill with a large terminal hook is no doubt
: y useful for extracting the molluscs from their shells. It ranges
ough the northern parts of South America.
As far as I know, only two species of Pernis have ever been kept in

any length of time. These species would require plenty of gri
bees, and wasps as food if they were to do well, but no doubt wo
take small birds and rats as well. Mr. J. G. Millais kept a Ho
Buzzard for some time on a diet of French plums and honey, the c
things it would eat, while almost more extraordinary was a specir
kept by Lord Lilford, which was fed on rice pudding.

The Crested Black Kite ( Baza lophotes). Above glossy green
black, varied with white and chestnut on the wings, a broad b;

The White-legged Falconet ( Microhierax melanoleucus). Ab
bluish-black, under surface white. This tiny Eastern species, and
next one, require artificial heat, at any rate in the winter ; they
certainly delicate, but if they can be acclimatized they make
most delightful birds in a small aviary. They feed entirely on wor
beetles, moths, small lizards, and will eat small fish too. Both spe&lt;

The Kestrel ( Tinnunuculus alaudarius ). The Common Kes
is too well known, both in captivity and in a wild state, for any desc]

Mombassa in East Africa.
The Lesser Kestrel ( T . cenchneis). Claws white, back of male
spotted. Very similar in habits to the Common Kestrel, but
particularly hardy in confinement. It is widespread over the Afrit
Continent, and reaches the Pyrenees. Other species of Kesl

The Hobby ( Falco subbuteo). Fairly often seen in confinement.
The Red-thighed Hobby (F . femoralis) . I have had a pair of these
nitiful little South American Hawks for over two years. They have
iwn no signs of breeding. They have to be kept shut up in winter
they are not hardy. I do not think this species has been previously
pt in confinement.
The Eleonora Falcon (F. eleonorce). Everywhere dark brown
lining to black, tail brown. The late A. E. Jamrach imported
ese Falcons as far back as 1860. One of these birds lived at
&amp;gt;rthrepps till 1867, and there is a beautiful picture of it by Wolf,
: 3 great animal painter, when it was in entire bright Hobby-like
image. The very similar Ash-coloured Falcon (F . concolor) has been
pt at the London Zoological Gardens. Other species which have
en kept in confinement are the Rufous-throated Falcon (F . rufigularis)
an Mexico and the Orange-thighed Falcon (F. fusco-ccerulescens ) also
&amp;gt;m South America. The Merlin ( F . cEsalon ) is a lively and
:eresting little species in captivity, constantly uttering its shrill
te when excited or alarmed. There seems to be no reason why this
\0x25A0d, which nearly always nests on the ground, should not breed in
ptivity if suitable accommodation was provided for it. Young birds
ten from the nest and brought up by hand make delightful pets,
t they must be kept in an indoor aviary large enough for them to
ie plenty of exercise in during the winter. I have never, however,
md this species very long-lived. The Peregrine ( Falco peregrinus) *
.is well-known bird has been kept at one time or another in most
ivate collections of Raptores. Perhaps I have been unfortunate,
t of the six or seven I have kept only one was what may be called
satisfactory bird. Like so many of the British Hawks, unless reared
&amp;gt;m the nest they are probably brought to one after having been
nged or caught in a trap and therefore are slightly damaged, as
fortunately the Peregrine is one of the most persecuted of the birds
prey. I always feel a Peregrine is in a wrong place in an aviary,
&apos;wever large a one. It is essentially a bird of the air, and anyone

Agapornis pullaria
The Red-faced Lovebird of West Africa was described as long ago
1758, and has had a number of names bestowed upon it, such as
Little Red-headed Parrakeet ", " Guiney Sparrow ", " Red-headed
linea Parrakeet ", " Ethiopian Parrakeet " and Agapornis xanthops.
is generally regarded as being the most difficult of the family to
climatize, though when this is accomplished it is acknowledged to
fairly hardy. Certainly when first imported the mortality is very
gh. On arrival they look very well and seem pretty tame, but this
induced partly by the crowded travelling conditions and partly by
eir each having a clipped wing. Why this bird alone amongst the
ivebirds should be clipped is a mystery. It is best to keep them caged
d let them moult the stumps naturally ; but if an attempt is made to
aw them great care should be exercised, as any sudden shock may
ove very injurious to this highly sensitive bird. Only two or three
lbs should be drawn at a time, the operation being repeated at the
d of a week. They are frequently brought over from Africa on rice
the husk, but, in the absence of this, ordinary rice will do just as well,
ley take readily to white millet and canary, the former generally being
eferred. Some will also eat a little sunflower and a few oats. Fruit
ey do not seem to care for, except occasionally a little sweet apple,
ttle trouble will be experienced with this species if it is kept caged
til full-winged and is not put out of doors until May is well advanced,
ley can then be left out the whole year.
Red-faced are rather uninteresting aviary birds as they spend the
2 ater part of their time sitting in a group in the shelter, seemingly
diking the glare of the sun. Occasionally, however, they have bursts
energy, when they see how much damage they can do, stripping a
tall tree in an incredibly short time. In flight they are a joy to behold,
ssibly being the most beautiful of the family in this respect. They

paler colour of her face, it being more of a yellow-orange than orang
red, also the blue spot on the rump is paler than in the cock.
Although this bird has been known to aviculturists for so long, ar
has been exported to Europe in such numbers as to make it compar;
lively scarce in its own country, no record exists of it having be(
bred in captivity. Mr. G. C. Porter very nearly succeeded in 1901
he was unfortunately away at the time, so was unable to give mar
particulars. They nested in a small box with half a cocoa-nut hus
cemented inside. On his return he found two fine youngsters, fu
feathered, lying dead on the ground. They were very fat and appeare
to be as large, if not larger, than the old birds. He attributed h
failure either to the mice which infested the aviary or the excessiv
heat at the time. The young of this species are like the adult femal
except that the forehead is yellow, with no orange tinge, and tl
yellow-orange near the base of the bill and on the throat is paler. 1
1880 Mr. W. T. Catleugh put some into a large cage, and almos
immediately a hen took possession of a cocoa-nut husk and began t.
lay eggs. Some Budgerigars in the same cage, however, threw them ou
Eggs were obtained both by Mrs. Anningson and Mr. R. Phillipps i
1902 and by Mr. Shore-Baily in 1915. There have been several instance
of partial success in Germany, which show that the clutch is from thre
to five eggs, which the hen alone incubates for about twenty-one days
the young in down are scantily covered, white, with pure white fee
and beak. Concerning their life in the wild, Mr. George Bates {The Ibv
1905, p. 89) writes :--
c# They resemble miniature Parrots in their tones and actions, a
well as in their appearance. They go about in small flocks, makin
little metallic squeaky cries, which yet have something in them recallin
the screams of Parrots. They like open country, and especially th
tall grass called # ukae ', from which they get their Bulu name c
Kos-ukae ' ( # Kos ', meaning Parrot) ; hence they are more common
inland, for grass is scarce within a hundred miles of the coast. At th
back of my house at Efulen was a sort of wild fig-tree, and when it
fruit was ripe a flock of these little birds often visited it. Among ther
were apparently young birds, which would sit on a limb making a grea
racket and fluttering their wings till the others brought them food. '

By E. Maud Knobel
A great deal has been written from time to time on the larger
icaws, but I wonder how many aviculturists know the fascination
the smaller Macaws and what charming and delightful pets they
a make. There are some six or seven different species of the smaller
icaws, including the Spix, a very beautiful species, of delicate blue
d grey in colour. All the others are green with bright patches of
lour about them. They vary greatly in size, even those of the same
ecies. Mine have the same food as the Amazon Parrots, i.e. equal
rts of giant canary seed and white sunflower, mixed with a good
rn mixture containing wheat, oats, dari and maize. When young they
i :piire bread and milk, and even when adult I give it to them now and
ain. Of course, water and fruit, chiefly apple, dry biscuit, toast,
d pea-nuts.
I must confess that for years I looked at these Macaws and found
ev left me " cold ". The ones that one generally saw in dealers'
ops did not seem to me to be very interesting. They never seemed
ry tame or friendly, nor did they show very much intelligence, and
was a long time before I was attracted by them. Then one day,
ing into Chapman&apos;s, I saw a tame Severe, which came on to my
; nd and allowed me to do what I liked with it. He very soon made a
nquest of me. The dark green of his plumage with the brilliant
I arlet on the inside of the wings, the darker red on the under side of
I e tail made him a most beautiful and attractive creature. I longed
possess him, but hesitated on account of his voice. I had always
iderstood Macaws could scream and were unendurable in a room.

was that they did not think he would be more noisy than many of i

Alas ! how often one has missed things by hesitating. It is fatal in 1
bird world. If you see something and want it you must have it n
and never pause to think. When I got back to Chapman's, and I h
only been away half an hour, the Severe was sold and destined foi
home in India. However, before he departed there he was put on depc
at the Zoo, where I had an opportunity of visiting him several tim
What happened there I do not know, for he was not on show to the pub]
and was kept in the inner room, but somehow this affected his temp
and one day when I put my hand up to take him out he bit me throu
the finger. This was a surprise I did not expect, and after that I ne^
touched him again. The head keeper, who was not there when
happened, could hardly believe it, and took him out to show me hi
mistaken I was, whereupon he flew at him and bit him through t
lip. I have often wondered whether in India he recovered his previc
good temper. After that I began to " cool off " Macaws, and it w
some time before I thought of possessing one.
Then one morning as I was dressing I heard the voice of a Pari
across the square. I thought to myself, " Well, someone else must ha
set up a Parrot and put it in the window." Its cries were incessant, a
after a time they seemed to come nearer, but even then it did not occ
to me that it was an escaped bird. It was not until after breakfa
when I was just starting to clean and feed my own birds, that the cf
of the Parrot seemed suddenly to have come close at hand. I look
out of the window and there on our balcony rail was an Illiger Mac?
and a woman on the next balcony with an enormous broom. H(
she hoped to catch it with a broom was a mystery. I immediate
ran down to the balcony, and I heard the woman say, " Ah ! Now she
catch it." I put a Blue-fronted Amazon that was in the room on
the balcony hoping that that would attract it while I went for an emp
cage. This I soon procured, and returned, having put plenty of fo&lt;
at the bottom of the cage. I need not have bothered much, for no sood
did the little Illiger see the cage than he ran straight into it and was ve
glad to find himself once more in safe quarters. By this time there w

Parrots arrived, and amongst them a most beautiful specimen of
Severe or Brown-fronted Macaw. Why they should be called Se\
I cannot imagine. He seemed in perfect condition and talked a li
I was told by the man who brought him over. But all he seemed to
was " Buck up ". I carried him home in triumph, and for a few ho
was very happy, but my happiness did not last, for my beautiful l
seemed to be drooping and ill ; he would not eat. I went back
Chapman and learned that the consignment had been beautifi
brought over and well housed as far as Havre, but there they had 1
to tranship, and for the last part of the journey the birds had b
put on the deck and many of them had caught a severe chill. By t
time Bucky, as I called him, seemed very ill indeed ; he could
nothing and seemed to be in pain and suffering from stoppage. I tr
a good dose of salad oil, an hour after I tried castor oil and put 1
on a hot bottle and kept him in my lap near a fire. Then I tried a d
of Glauber salts, which had the desired effect, and then he tried a lit
warm bread and milk. After that I knew I had saved him, but it 1
been a " near go ", and had he been left in the shop or gone to some(
who did not understand, his life in England would have been indi
brief. He has just turned out one of the greatest successes one ]
ever had. He literally adores me. Overjoyed when I come into i
room and hysterically ecstatic if I go near his cage, and cries whe
leave him. If he is out, which he often is, playing on my swing
dog chain, he is only happy on it for a short time and then flies on
my shoulder, letting himself slide down until he lies like a baby on
back on my lap. That is his favourite place, and he will remain th
for hours while I try and answer inquiries of the Society on what to
with a Parrot who has plucked himself bare, or why we cannot sup]
sample copies of the Magazine, etc. Bucky never knows a cl
moment; he is the merriest bird of all my collection, always hi
about something, either swinging in his swing, playing with a pi&lt;
of chain, or lying on his back at the bottom of his cage playing witl
piece of wood and laughing to himself all the time. He talks quit&lt;
lot, but not real words, and he tries desperately hard to whistle. E
do Macaws whistle ? I have an idea they cannot. Anyway, he if
great success.

My next venture in this line was an Illiger. On looking through
ot of packing cases filled with Amazon Parrots at Chapman's, I
v that three of them each contained one Illiger Macaw. They were
most miserable birds. One was almost bare of feathers and in a
:y poor way. The next was a little better, but wild and inclined
bite. The third was also a little misery, soiled all over by the
)ppings of the bigger birds, and every time he tried to feed a Blue-
nt gave him a savage peck and he retired to the back of the crate.
11 he had managed to exist during the long voyage over. I brought
a home, and really when I looked at him I almost felt ashamed of
n. He had no wing feathers and no tail whatever, and was a
roughly miserable creature. In fact, during the week that followed
ras several times asked if he was dead yet ?
The first thing I did was to feed him up on good boiled maize, bread
i milk, apple, and Parish's food in the water. Then I washed him
warm water and put him by a fire to dry. At the end of a week he
?an to put on some flesh and fill out a bit, and his plumage began to
k a little less like wire and to take on a more silky appearance,
soon proved himself an amusing little beggar, and very soon took
water like a duck. Now the Severe Macaw never bathes, and hates
ng sprayed or anything to do with water. Not so the Illiger. He
1 get into quite a big basin and literally lie down in the water, first
one side and then the other. He often gets so wet that I have to
n on the gas-fire to dry him up a bit or else roll him in a towel. He
f ]uite different in character to the Severe, though he loves playing
out, and will run about the floor as quick as lightning, and likes
ng on the floor, which the Severe does not. He gets into the waste
! per basket and will carefully take pieces of paper out and strew them
3 r my floor. I have sometimes come in and found my floor looking
e a snowfield covered in white envelopes from members of the
iiety. He has one horrid habit, and that is he likes to come and
e you a nip in the back of your ankle. I think it is only play : still
s a nip. Now he can say quite a lot of wrnrds, but mostly talks in a
i d whisper. I have heard that whispering is one of the characteristics
Macaws. Is this so ? He constantly asks " What are you doing ? "
I is so fond of the word " doing " that he will repeat it half a dozen

times before answering " I'm busy When I first had him he show
no red on the lower breast and very little on the rump, and onh
feather or so on the frontal. Now, of course, he is perfect, with
plumage glossy like silk, far more so than the Severe. This I put do
to the constant bathing. But his tail is his weak point. He seems|
grow the feathers and then they break off or are malformed. I supp&lt;
why people do not keep Macaws more is their voice, for they ha
voices and can use them. Taking them all round they are no wo
than a Ring-neck or an Alexandrine, but they can be persistent, thou
I have always found a remedy to stop it, either covering them over
letting them out. But, like all the Parrot tribe, they generally lib
good scream about sunset, when, in a wild state, I imagine they r
returning to their roosting-places for the night. The two I have a
far more gentle and reliable than most Amazons, and there is no dou
about their devotion to one. I have several times had an opportuni
of seeing very tame and charming Spix Macaws. Of the smallest
all this tribe there is a delightful little specimen of the Noble Mac;
now at the Zoo. It is very tame and talks a little in spite of a defecti
beak. It is a beautiful little bird, not unlike a miniature Sevei
though the head is very different, but the scarlet on the top of t
shoulder and inside the wings gives it a very striking appearand
Of the other smaller Macaws at the Zoo there is a nice Yellow Collare
but he always seems rather a dull bird, perhaps it is because he is ratb
high up and one cannot get at him to pet him. But the pair of Illige
that live at the end of the house are really a fine pair of birds. 0
wishes they could be seen in an aviary where an attempt at breedii
might be tried. They are most amusing in the way they play with ea&lt;
other, and the other day when I was watching them the cock wj
feeding the hen. They are not tame, and will not allow one to tou&lt;
them. This is probably because they are sufficient unto each other.
I have written these few remarks in the hope that others who mi
have kept this group may be induced to give us their experience ar
so help to widen our knowledge.

The male of the Horned Tragopan (Tragopan satyra) has the head
istly black, the neck and the whole of the under surface bright
ange-carmine, the back and tail being brownish. Over the whole of
e body plumage are distributed spots of white, with black edgings.
ie skin of the throat is blue, more or less obscured by black hair-like
itures. A peculiar wattle is situated on the throat, but this is so
ntracted as to be invisible except on such rare occasions as during
, e courtship display. The same may be said of a pair of wattles
owing from the top of the head, which are completely hidden by
e plumage except on rare occasions. The female of the Tragopan
of an inconspicuous mottled brownish hue. During the breeding
ason the cock Tragopan may frequently be seen to perform a lateral
splay, walking round the hen with his tail and body plumage more
less depressed laterally, a form of display that is common to many
Peasants. But the full frontal display of this bird, which is seldom seen,
one of the most remarkable exhibitions in Nature ; quite as extra-
dinary a transformation as that of the display of either the Argus
heasant or the Great Bustard.
For the past twenty years and more I have known Tragopans
captivity, but only on rare occasions have I seen the full display,
id I will endeavour to describe what I saw on a recent occasion,
id only regret that no description can adequately convey the thrill
lat this wonderful spectacle gave me.
The hen Tragopan was walking unconcernedly out into the open
id I had not noticed the cock bird in the darkness of some under-
*owth in the background, until suddenly out he came with a run,
s body erect, with the white-spotted carmine feathers of the breast
id flanks spread out like a skirt ; his black face surmounted by two
'ect horns of vivid verdeter blue, and from his throat a large bib of
tense blue, barred with red. Thus he ran forward looking like a
ttle Mephistopheles. Probably he saw that he was being watched,
t he soon stopped, shook his head, and both horns and bib quickly
mtracted and disappeared, and the Tragopan became once more
normal bird.

The birds in one&apos;s aviaries at this season are so very interes|
that I thought some members might like to hear of my doings.
One aviary, inhabited by small Finches, so far is doing very \
One pair of Three-coloured Parrot-Finches have built the most attract
nest. They took to a box nest made from a stump of a tree,
hung on the wall, with quite a small hole for them to get in and \
They completely filled this with fine grass, twisting the grass round
small entrance hole in the most wonderful way, making it inrposs
for one to see in, so that I have no idea if there are even eggs ir
but I feel pretty certain there are, as the hen is sitting tight. 1 I h
in the course of a few days I may hear the voices of young birds. 1
second pair of Three-coloured Parrot-Finches laid seven eggs in a i
on the wall, and then started to build. They covered all the el
and eventually forsook the nest, and I felt they were pretty hope
from the first. They then started a half moult, and now have recovej
and are in fine condition, and I hope they will go to nest again be!
the end of the season. I have two pairs of the ordinary Parrot Fincll
both nesting, and the eggs should hatch in a few days. Diamond Doj
also are sitting in this aviary. I find my pair very free breeders.
In another aviary I have a pair of Shamahs ; the hen is sitting)
five eggs. As soon as these hatch I intend opening the door of
aviary into the garden and letting the cock out to find live food j
the young.
My Blue Birds in another aviary had a nest of five eggs, )|
unfortunately a mouse got in and ate all the eggs. They went to n
again about a fortnight after this calamity, and now the hen is sitt

n. As she has changed her nest-box to a much more secluded place,
ch I trust is impossible (if any place can be) for a mouse to get at,
pe she may bring off some young. Last year I had no luck with this
. They will feed the young on nothing but live insects, and unfortu-
dy will not touch gentles--nothing but mealworms--and I find
j will not thrive on only mealworms, but must have live ant
caterpillars, grasshoppers, etc.
In another aviary I have a beautiful pair of Royal Starlings. These
f /ve seen carrying grasses, but so far there are no signs of anything
her. I also have seen the Niltavas doing the same thing, but as the
&amp;gt;on is not very far advanced, I hope they will progress farther.
I f have only one Spreo Starling flying about. The old hen only laid
eggs, and one young one died when only a few days old. The
has started building again, and probably will do better with the
&amp;gt;nd lot.
Several species of Broadtail Parrakeets are nesting. The Golden-
vned Conures are again nesting this year and have laid two eggs,
pair of White-cheeked Conures are very interested in a log nest-
. I hope they will do something.
1 have been very lucky this year with all nesting birds. I have never
any trouble over egg-binding, and this I put down to always giving
and glycerine in their water when I see them starting to nest. I
eve it to be a most excellent thing, especially in this very changeable
fiate.

The Scarlet-chested or Splendid Parrakeet (Neophema splendida)
Western and South Australia, the most beautiful of a beautiful gen
has always been regarded as a great rarity, and for several years has b(
thought to be extinct. Now a few examples have been noted in N
South Wales, so that although extremely rare it appears to have
very extensive range and may hold its own. A good coloured pis
of this species appears in the Emu for April, 1927.
Another of the nearly extinct Parrakeets of Australia and perhs
an even more wonderful one than that first mentioned, has also be
recently noted in New South Wales, namely the Paradise or Beauti
Parrakeet (Pscphotus pulclierrimus). A writer in the Emu describ
the appearance of a little party of five of these, driven out of th
ordinary habitat by the drought which has recently been very sevs
in the interior.
It is much to be hoped that the Australian Ornithologists' Uni
will use their influence to persuade the Government to take up serious
the question of breeding some of these fast disappearing Parrakes
in suitable aviaries in Australia. If put in charge of competent avici
turists, there is no reason why some of these birds should not be saved

Mr. Heumann contributes some interesting Bird Notes to the current
iber of the Emu, and from these we extract the followin&amp;quot; :--
The rarer species of Parrakeets could be bred most assuredly in
ibers if aviculture were not looked upon as vandalism. Turquoise
rots are supposed to be almost extinct. As a fact, when I lost my
c bird of this species I had to pay #30 for another specimen. Out
ieyoung which I reared, my friend, Mr. Harvey, jun., of Adelaide,
* has a pair of them, again reared eight young this season in two
&amp;gt;ds of two pairs each. Mrs. Mellor, of Adelaide, bred about a dozen
icess Alexandra Parrots ; so also did Mr. Lienau. Out in the open
e birds have not nearly the same chance, as Hawks especially
?e havoc amongst them. But catapults and pea-rifles and the
atific and unscientific egg-collectors do their share in the speedy
A
\0x25A0rmination of anything that may be rare."
Mr. James Charles Edwards, of 629 South Grand Avenue, Los
eles, California, is probably the largest breeder of Budgerigars in
United States. Commencing about fifteen years ago with one
dred pairs, he has now 1,500 pairs. His aviaries are
feet by 100 feet, divided into ten compartments, each housing
breeding pairs. He is also breeding Blues, Whites, and
alts.
Besides the Budgerigar aviaries Mr. Edwards has others in which
s breeding Bleeding-heart, Cuban and other species of Doves,
iatiels, Redrumps, Lorikeets, Pennants, Blue-wing Grass Parrakeets,
several species of Lovebirds, as well as many of the ornamental
dies, and he greatly prizes some Tabuan Parrakeets given to him
he Marquess of Tavistock for experimental purposes.
Ae are very pleased to receive a copy of the first issue of The
7 erigar Bulletin, published by the Budgerigar Club. In it will
ound much useful advice and many valuable tips for those who
Id produce the various colour variations to which this most wonder-
)f Parrakeets is subject.

The older members of the Society will recollect the instructive ,j
often humorous writings that appeared in our Magazine a good m|
years ago by the Rev. C. D. Farrar and will welcome the appeara|
of a new book on his reminiscences as an aviculturist. It is fulj
delightful humour and sound advice, and he does not mind record
his failures as well as his successes. His accounts of interviews \j
the dealers of the past will bring back vivid memories of some of i
old friends of twenty years ago, such as Joseph Abrahams, of St. Georj
Street, East, and Maschke, of Islington. He reminds us of the 1
temperature and lack of ventilation of the latter dealer's shop, w]
those of us who visited it will recall. But both Abrahams and Masc
sometimes had birds which we never see nowadays. From Abrah
Mr. Farrar bought a pair of Poes, better known perhaps as Tuis,
they are not Australian birds, as we are told, but New Zealand.
Mr. Farrar's reminiscences go back to the time when Turquok
could be obtained without much difficulty, and that is a long time
He was fortunate enough to obtain two pairs, both of which b
though one nest full of young birds died through the cock-bird fee*
them on elder. He tells us that for some years he was not without
species, but not knowing what was coming he sold them all, as n
other people did. Now they are on the point of becoming extinct.
Aviculturists will find much to interest and amuse then

Although this is a small book and produced-at an extremely low
gure, it is one of the most interesting books we have read for a long time,
vhy do birds sing ? Why migrate ? Why do some species require
considerable area of territory for each breeding pair while others
est in colonies ? Such questions may never have occurred to some
f us, but they are of great importance, and are ably discussed by the
uthor, who has for many years made a special study of these problems,
'he book, in short, is the view of an observer who has carefully studied
he writings of the latest and best observers and put them thoroughly
o the test. The territory theory, for instance, for which credit is due
o Mr. Eliot Howard, applies to such birds as the Warblers, which
lave a very restricted feeding area, but does not apply to those which
ange far afield for their food. Gatke's theory of the speed and altitude
&amp;gt;f flight during migration has been shown by recent observers to be
it fault, the movement of birds at such time being much like that at
)ther times, but in a straight line and towards a definite goal.

Sir,-- With reference to my notes on the American Siskin in the las
number of the Magazine, I have looked at the illustration of Chrisomitril
arisiis, mentioned in your footnote, and my birds certainly do no
belong to this species. They much more closely resemble the Blacl
Siskin, C. atrata, found in Bolivia and North Peru. They differ fron
this bird by having much more yellow on the under parts, by the win*
bar being white instead of yellow, and by the hen having the nape of th
neck greenish-yellow instead of black. I shall take the first opportunity
of examining the skins at the British Museum as they have been unabli
to name it for me from my crude description.

Sir,-- Bowdler Sharpe, in British Birds (Allen's Naturalist's Library) j
vol. ii, p. 85, says, " There can be no doubt that the Snowy Owl becomes
whiter with age, and that the very old individuals lose their markings
almost entirely, though it is a question whether the females ever
become perfectly snow-white and lose their spots and bars." I should
therefore like to record that the oldest specimen in the Zoo, which was
received several years ago in the barred plumage, became at its fir si
moult in the Gardens nearly if not quite as free from dark markings
as it is at present. It will be interesting to see how its recently received!
and well-barred companions moult out, and those who practise photo-
graphy would be doing useful work in recording their progress.

NESTING OF LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98988132" page_id="58075656"  page_num="Page 201" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Following on Mrs. Prestwich's very excellent article on the
rvebirds, may I offer a few suggestions arising from my own experience
liich may be of help to breeders ? My chief trouble, in common with
hers, has been young dead in shell. I refer to the Nyasa and the
lack-cheek.
Mr. Denys Weston recently published an account of an ingenious
ntrivance for retaining moisture in the nest. For it is probably a
ct these species affect in nature damp situations. Anyhow, I have
far shirked the operation of re-modelling my nesting boxes, and have
1 1 upon an alternative which appears to answer the purpose well
ough.
Upon the floor of the aviary I set a shallow pan of water and
ranged therein a supply of the leaves of spinach-beet or kindred
getable. The birds eat this greedily, but in addition they carry off
e wet leaves and arrange them about their eggs. By this expedient
i have hatched this spring a large percentage of the eggs of both
j ecies, and the young show a much decreased mortality. The water
the pan must be renewed daily, as spinach-beet soon fouls it. The

nesting material of any sort. I could not see that the cock took ar.
part in the incubation.
My Masked Lovebirds (A. personata) have gone to nest within fh
days of their arrival. They are constructing rather stout edifices *
twigs, not bark, in the boxes. Being rather large birds, the nestir
boxes should be of generous proportions. So far, this species hq

Sir,-- I have just bought Dr. Ilopkinson's book, Records of Bin
Bred in Captivity. I see that there is only one record of the Desei
Bullfinch for the United Kingdom. I reared two nests of them last yea
Two young birds each time. The first nest contained four young, bi
when the first two left the nest I went to clean out the box and frightene
out two others which were still in the fluff, dropping on to the flex
from about six feet, one got killed and the other so hopelessly cripple
its legs that after it had left the nest and could fly I destroyed it nvysei
as it could not stand. These were reared in an aviary full of other bird!
I also reared last year two nests of Hybrids of a second generatio
from a (Hooded Siskin X Canary) X (Canary).
Three young left the first nest ; one died later. Two left tl:
second nest. In the autumn I caught them up and caged them, whe
two of them suddenly died. Whether it was fright or not, or owirs
to the others, as they were not very friendly towards each other, 1 d
not know. I exchanged the two others with another member.
In 1923 I had two nests of Hybrids, Indian Silverbill X Zebra Find
Four young left the first nest; one died later. These three all san
so I suppose they were cocks. The second nest only produced on
young, as the three young of the first brood always roosted in the lies&apos;
It is rather a wonder that any were reared. This bird did not sing an
died the following spring, so I sent it up to the Museum as they wei
asking for any Hybrid birds that might be bred.

Last year I also bred the Chestnut-breasted Finch. Three of the
ur young are still alive, two of them have almost got their mature
umage, but the third shows no sign of any colour on the under parts
t; there are a few dark feathers on the face, which markings are the
^ to appear on the young. Otherwise it might be a young Flavi-

A HYBRID SWAN
Sir,-- Up to the end of April last year, it may be there still, on a
! all piece of water, the remains of a lake in Corvill Hall, Brentford,
t at the eastern end and cut in half by the Great Western Road,
[s a Hybrid Swan (Australian Black g x Mute Swan $). The bird
)eared to be mature, and had a black and white spotted appearance.
3 wings were mostly white, and the neck mostly black, spotted with
ite, while the body was the reverse. The feet were, I think, very
k. The carriage and general shape were more of the Australian
1 than the Mute Swan. The bird belonged to the Brentford Council,
o not think they liked it as it was rather savage.

THE BUDGERIGAR AND ITS COLOUR
VARIETIES
By D. Seth-Smitii
From my earliest days I have known and loved the Budgerigar,

a child I remember some that were owned by an elder sister and
ch I thought the most delightful birds in the world. There was
lething about them that fascinated me then, and they fascinate
still, and I shall always regard this species as the most wonderful
all of the Parrakeets. There is only one species of Budgerigar,
t no other species is closely related to it, or has one-half of its charming
*its and ways. It has taken to a life in captivity as no other species
Parrot has, and to such an extent has it been bred and reared in
tivity that the world is independent of the original source of supply,
if no more ever come out of Australia its numbers in Europe, Asia,
America can be kept up and increased to almost any extent.
As everybody knows, the Budgerigar, in its original dress, is of a
utiful grass green, barred on the back, and with the forehead
:ht Canary yellow. In this dress it occurs in its native habitat,
jtralia, where it migrates from one locality to another in flocks,
owing the ripening grass, upon the seeds of which it feeds. Yellow

206 D. Seth-Smith--The Budgerigar and its Colour Varieties
birds have been noted in such flocks, so it is not to be wondered at tl
a yellow race was produced in Europe many years ago. . Exact
when these yellow birds were first produced I do not know, but 1
know that the yellow Budgerigars one saw ten or twenty years ;i
were of a better and purer yellow than those one sees to-day. Yelll
birds are not very popular just now, and this may account for 1
want of care that has occurred in their breeding. They have been!
much crossed with greens that most of the birds one sees have mi;
too much green in their colouring. What one wants to see is the 1 1
lutino Budgerigar with pink eyes and no trace of green whatev
Such birds have been produced, but the ordinary type of yell
Budgerigar has dark eyes and a green tinge on the rump. The t
lutino would lack entirely the black pigment which, together wl
yellow or orange pigment and peculiar feather structure, gives
normal green coloration.
If the black pigment be retained and the yellow eliminated, .
obtain the beautiful blue variety which we have all become famil
with. How the first of these mutants was produced we do not krnj
but it was doubtless nothing more than a lucky sport which 1
fortunate breeder took great care to preserve and to breed from. T
first blues seem to have appeared in Belgium in the early eighties, 1
it was not until the year 1910 that specimens were exhibited in t
country. These were owned by a Belgian aviculturist who 1
established the variety in his aviaries. Others both in Great Brit
and on the Continent obtained pairs, and the variety soon beca
established. With the three colour varieties, green, yellow, and hi
of a free-breeding species, there were great possibilities of produc
other colours by judicious crossing, and the results of such experime
are seen in the cobalt, which is perhaps the finest of all, the mai
and the olive. Then there is the white variety which generally she
a considerable trace of blue. At the Zoological Gardens a brood
three of these appeared from blue parents, but it has also been obtain
from crossing blue and yellow and mating their progeny. Exp&lt;
menting with the crossing of the different varieties of this Parrak;
is a fascinating hobby, and probably much still remains to
accomplished in the production of new tints.

D. Seth-Smith The Budgerigar and its Colour Varieties 207
One has heard of red Budgerigars, but few will be taken in by these
*ious fakes. Mr. Chapman recently had some sent to him from
lewhere in the East, and he was good enough to send me a pair
see. They were very cleverly dyed an orange red and were of a
king appearance, but a few new feathers were appearing here and
*re and these were green !
Blue Budgerigars are expensive, and the cobalt variety is more
tly than the other, but they can be produced by breeding from green
ds that have been bred from one blue and one green parent. Such
ds are known as " blue-bred " birds, and provided their parentage
mown they may be expected to produce a percentage of pure blues,
blue and a green bird mated together will produce only green
spring, but these are the so-called blue-bred birds and are capable
producing a percentage of blue birds.
When mated together these blue-bred birds should produce 25 per
it of pure blues, 50 per cent of greens that are blue-bred, like their
rents, and 25 per cent pure greens that have no power to produce
les. The trouble is that these pure greens cannot be distinguished
m the blue-bred greens from the same parents, and here lies the
lse of much disappointment.
In breeding blues from blues, although only pure blues will be
tained, the stock is likely to become weakly after a few generations,
d so it is always advisable to obtain fresh blood by breeding a few
le-breds, and mating these inter se. The blues bred from these w T ill
absolutely pure blooded, and may be used for fresh blood amongst

With regard to cobalts, I have had no personal experience, but I
derstand that blues mated to olive birds may produce birds which
the next generation may produce this splendid variety. Perhaps
I3se of our members who have experimented in breeding thes3 and

I was hoping to have written a long and detailed article on the hi I;
of some of the little-known parts of Portuguese East Africa, for :
11th September, 1925, two of us started from Mount Selinda on f&lt;
with a number of native carriers, intending to march into the interj
of Portuguese East Africa, making the district where the Umvumaooi
and the Sabi Rivers join our headquarters for a time.
The same day that we started we crossed the frontier and spJ
the night at Spungerbera, a small settlement where a Portugal
Commandant lives; after that our way lay over the dense jungj
covered Chimanimani Mountains, until 40 miles further on
reached the great central plains, and in eleven days' time reached tj:
Umvumaoodzi River, and there we intended pitching our camp t
several weeks in a district which at the best of times is far fromhealtl|,
But the hardships encountered en route, terrible tropical storri
trouble with the carriers, illness, bad organization, terrific heat, a
last, but not least, acute starvation, rendered me in anything but
mood conducive to observing birds ; hence these meagre notes.
The Umvumaoodzi is a very wide sand river (about 1 to [
miles wide in the rainy season), but at the beginning of the wet seas,
is a chain of large deep pools resembling small lakes, covered for tl
most part with huge water-lilies and fringed with tall and dense reec|
This part of the country was particularly rich in bird life. We saw maj
birds that I have already mentioned in my notes on Mount Selincj
but the following were noted for the first time :--
The Hadada Ibis ( Hagedashia hagedash)
In the early mornings, long before the dawn, we were awakened 1
a small flock of these beautiful but extremely noisy birds flying over o
camp from their roosting-place to their feeding grounds down the rivet
the noise they make is incredible. I should think the noise made by
large flock would be perfectly deafening. The birds had one speci;
roosting-tree, to which they came in small parties of three or four int
evenings, and departed in the mornings to their respective feediij

iinds in the same small parties. The general colour of this bird is
it grey, the wings being metallic bronze green, the tail purple.
The Three-banded Plover ( AEgialitis tricollaris)
These charming little birds are found in twos and threes in the
ly mornings picking up their food on the sandy flats by the pools ;
v have a peculiar habit of running a yard or two and then stopping
l jerking their body up and down as though courtesying. They
t over the sand or mud flats with incredible speed.
Another little Plover, which I believe was the Caspian Plover
gialitis asiatica), was common on the wet sand flats of the
ivumaoodzi, where it kept in small flocks, running with great speed
1 every now and then probing into the sand with its bill. It was a
y confiding little bird and would come within a few yards of one.
The Saddle-billed Stork ( Ephippiorhynehus senegalensis)
I came across these unique birds but once on the dry sandy bed
:he river. They are easily distinguished from any of the other Storks
the very peculiar black and crimson upturned bill, and when on the
ig by the pure white under-wing feathers. These birds are far from
union in East Africa, and only frequent the low-lying parts of the
intry in the vicinity of marshes, swamps, and large rivers, where
;y seem to go about in pairs. They are shy and difficult to approach,
ing up at the slightest sign of danger and making wide sweeping
cles in the air, rising higher and higher until they are lost in the blue.
The Black or Speckled Duck ( Anas sparsa )
I frequently came across small parties of these Duck on the pools
the rivers, usually five or six together ; they are far from shy and
II allow one to approach within easy distance of them. The Black
ick does not seem to be very common in any part of South Africa,
person who lived near Mount Selinda discovered a nest containing
e eggs of this Duck, which she placed under a fowl; the whole five
tched and the Ducklings were dark brownish black, marked with
How. They were exceedingly tame, far more so than ordinary
icklings, and would come into the kitchen every day to catch flies,
ey grew up without mishap into delightful pets, but what eventually

Africa don't cherish any sentimental ideas about their pets if they
of any utilitarian value.
The Hooded Weaver Finch (Spermestes scutatus )
These pretty little birds, so well known in England as cage bill
are very abundant in Portuguese East Africa. I first saw them in sn
flocks on the ground, searching for seeds around the outbuildings!
Spungerbera, a small but pretty frontier station. I also saw them mil
times on our march into the interior, invariably around old Kal
kraals and lands, feeding upon the minute seeds of various grasses J
plants. They were exceedingly tame.
The Fork-tailed Drongo ( Dicrurus afer)
This was the commonest bird that we met with on our trip ; in sol
parts there were hundreds of them and their loud notes could be he;
the whole day through. One hears them before any other bird in
morning and last thing at night when all the other birds are at roc
These Drongos seem to take all their food in the air, taking up a p
of vantage and making short flights at intervals to capture insel
as they pass. I have very seldom seen one on the ground. Someth::
they have singing competitions ; two males will alight on a branch si:
by side and sing with all their might, each one trying to drown
notes of the other.
The Three-streaked Bush Shrike (Teleplionus australis)
I met with this rare Shrike several times, at least, I think it belong
to this species. In colour it is ash grey, browner on the mantle, 4
wings chestnut, and the tail black, the throat white, a black stril
from the base of the bill through the eye to the nape, the eyebro;
light grey. Its habits seemed to resemble in most ways those of 4
Black-headed Shrike, to which bird it seems to be closely allied, h
found this Shrike in the thick bush by the Periwiri River.
The Melba Finch ( Pytelia melba)
This charming little Waxbill was frequently seen around the Ka &apos;
kraals and huts either singly or in pairs busily engaged in picking I
minute seeds. It is a very confiding little bird and its habits resom *
more or less those of the very familiar Blue-breasted Waxbill.

The Carmine-throated Bee-eater ( Merops nubicus)
Of all the African birds this is perhaps the most lovely--in colour
lixture of delicate rose pink, of rich carmine, pale blue and green--
5 a glory of the avian world. At the Periwiri River, which is a chain
large, still, lily-covered pools in the dry season, we found these
dous birds exceedingly numerous. Sometimes when sitting on the
e branches of the trees by the river's edge their plumage would
time a burnished copper hue in the brilliant sunlight. At various
3 rvals during the day they hawked for insects high in the air, after
manner of the Swifts, the whole flock mounting higher and higher until
y were lost to sight in the blue sky, then they would come down again
1 fly just over the water, dipping their bills into it and drinking as
y flew. Their flight is nothing short of marvellous ; they can sail
ng at an incredible speed, without a motion of their outstretched
lgs, twist, turn, and stop dead still. Their method of bathing is
eresting. They first of all congregate in small flocks on the bare
es near the water, and from there two or three at a time will take a
;ht over the surface, suddenly dive down, and immerse their heads
der the water, rapidly beating the water with their wings and churning
up into a spray and completely soaking the plumage. Owing to the
image being so wet the flight back to the tree is very laboured and
avy. They then sit preening their resplendent plumage in the sun ;
lanwhile, there is a steady flow of birds back and forwards from
e water. The time taken by the birds in bathing is only a matter of
few seconds. The voice of this Bee-eater is not in keeping with its
amage, it is merely a rather loud harsh twittering. The birds seem to
ve set times for bathing, resting, and catching their food. My com-
mon told me that these birds nest in hundreds in holes in the sandy
nks of the Zambesi. They are seldom found far away from water,
ough I have sometimes seen them on the high dry veldt; but I believe
ey were then only on their way to the north, where they go to breed.

the taller trees after the manner of a Thrush. Owing to the adve
conditions we met with, I had little time for studying the habits
this bird.
The Black Tit (Parus niger)
Occasionally we saw this very striking but very un-Tit-like b
in the trees by our camps. Judging by its demeanour, it seems
resemble the Shrikes more than the Tits. It is always a solitary bir
I have never seen it in pairs. It is very active in the trees, passing fr&lt;
branch to branch the whole day and seldom resting. It does not r
over the boughs after the manner of the true Tits. It utters most of t
time a peculiar harsh note. The food consists of insects, especia
spiders, which it finds in the trees.
The Racquet-tailed Roller (Coracias spatulatus )
A pair of these beautiful birds were seen by our camp near t
Umvumaoodzi, sitting on the top of a tree uttering their peculiar a:
very distinctive note. They feed principally upon grasshoppers.
The Yellow-billed Kite (Milvus cegyptius)
We found this bird fairly common and single examples would st;
around our camp on the look out for scraps; sometimes if they saw
small piece of meat they would swoop down and seize it with th(
talons within a yard of one. The flight is extremely buoyant and ligl
and the tail during flight pivots from side to side. Sometimes this bi
will sweep over the low bushes in search of small birds and mammals
Sparrman s Honey Guide ( Indicator sparrmani)
In some parts, especially in the well-wooded districts, we found tl
bird plentiful; it at once attracts attention by its loud, harsh, chatterii
cry. When it wishes to attract the attention of a human to a bee
nest it is confiding enough, but at other times it is very shy ai
extremely difficult to approach.
The Wood Hoopoe (Irrisor viridis )
We found the nest belonging to this species in a tree in the midd
of a rest camp about 50 miles from Spungerbera. We discovered tl

tss. I have no idea why this was done, because-when a native finds
lest with eggs in he usually keeps a watchful eye on it with a view to
dug the young as soon as they are large enough to eat. We found
3 eggs, five in number, a beautiful pale greenish blue, very much
e those of the European Starling, at the bottom of a hollow branch,
out 5 feet away from the opening ; there was no nest, the eggs were
$t lying on the damp rotten wood, and were very much stained in
risequence.
Moselikatze's Roller (Coracias caudatus)
Not far from the nest of the Wood Hoopoe we found a nest of this
)ller placed in the upright hollow branch of a large tree about 20 feet
)in the ground, the hole was so small that we would have thought
was almost impossible for the birds to enter.
The Swallow-tailed Bee-eater (Dicrocercus hirundineus )
We frequently saw these beautiful birds on the way down to the
tnvumaoodzi River, usually singly, perched on the topmost branch
some dead tree, and from there making short flights into the air
capture winged insects as they passed. They have a very
stinctive call.
Tiie Brown-headed Parrot (Poeocephalus fuscicapillus)
In some districts that we passed through this Parrot was exceedingly
mndant, in one especially which was covered by grey lichen woods
ey were breeding in the hollow trees. Like most of the East African
irrots, these birds associate in pairs and are usually very shy, but
hen camping by the Umvumaoodzi River we found them com-
. iratively tame and quite easy to approach. They came there in large
imbers to feed upon the nectar of the huge red flower of the # ' German
^usage" tree. During the time they were feeding they remained
irly quiet, but at other times, especially when flying, they gave vent
* ear-piercing shrieks. This charming Parrot is light brown on the
&amp;gt;per parts, including the upper breast, darker on the head, and the
ipe is tinged with green ; the mantle wings and tail dark grass-green,

^ an d is very conspicuous in flight. This Parrot seen I
seldom to have been imported into England, which seems a great pit'
for it is plentiful in its native haunts and would, no doubt, make
delightful pet.
Peter's Fin-foot (Podica petersi)
I first saw this strange Cormorant-like bird on a secluded lib
covered pool of the Periweri River ; it was swimming with the bod
submerged, the back being on a level with the surface of the wate
It didn&apos;t seem in the least perturbed at seeing me, and later when I w;
sitting on the trunk of a large fallen tree which lay half across the po-
it came and settled on a branch within a few feet of me ; it was in
drenched condition, and at once proceeded with a lengthy toilet, whic
lasted over a quarter of an hour. After that it went into the water agaii
and proceeded to fish by diving and staying under the water ; som
times it was submerged for more than a minute at a time. It mu;
have travelled at a great speed under the water, judging by where
went under and where it came up again. If the fish it caught was
large one, it would bring it to the surface to swallow, but if the catc
was a small one it would be swallowed under water. After about fh
minutes of this the bird would come and settle near to me and a*;ai
proceed with a lengthy toilet. I have never seen such a fearless bird
it seemed, in fact, to approve of my company ; evidently I was the fir
white man it had seen.
The Jacana (Phyllopezus africanus)
On the same pool on which I saw the Peter's Fin-foot I saw a pa
of Jacanas and spent several pleasant hours watching them. Their hu#
feet are specially adapted for walking on the large water-lily leaver

If the leaves are too far apart for the bird to comfortably walk on
will swim. The whole time that the birds are walking over the aquat
vegetation they are busily engaged in picking up minute aquatic insec
upon which they feed. The Jacana is an extremely graceful bird i
build and also in its movements.

These birds have completely webbed feet ; the great toe being joined
v a membrane to the rest. They are mostly sea birds, and only a few
: them frequent fresh water. They are large perching birds and feed
I fish. Certain species are often met with in Zoological Gardens, where
ley live well if given their proper diet of fish and meat, but few of
lem are desirable to amateurs, for they are not beautiful, are large
*eders, and very dirty.
The Pelicans ( Pelecanus ) are well known, they are all large birds
aving white or pale grey plumage. They are characterized by long
eaks, provided with an enormous expanding pouch below. There are
)ughly speaking about ten species, all about the size of a Swan ;
II swim and fly with great ease. They do well in captivity, feeding on
sh. Pelicans have a duller colouring when in eclipse, and the females
ilfer slightly from the males. They are sometimes dangerous to feebler
irds. The species are as follows :--
Pelecanus onocrotalus, inhabits Europe, Africa, and West Asia ;
irge ; w r hite, with a pink flush and black flights.
P. roseus , which frequents the same regions and spreads to the
I
xtreme east. Smaller, and with a shorter beak.
P. crispus, distributed over the same ground except Africa. Black
nd white, with a crest on its head.
P. philippensis, from India, Indo-China, and the Philippines,
flack, white, and vinous brown ; smaller.

P. rufescens , from North-East Africa, resembles the preceding
P. fuscus, Gulf of Mexico. Pale yellow head, brown neck, gre}
with black streaks above ; vinous brown underneath ; small. I
californicus , from the Pacific Coast, is much the same.
P. thagus, native of Peru and Chile, one of the guano-making bird,
is brown with white stripes ; head and sides of the neck yellow, uppt
part of the neck black.
P. erythrorhynchus, from the interior, North, and Central Americ
is white with black flights and in the breeding season it is adorned wit
a horny plate on the middle of the upper mandible.
P. conspicillatus , Australian, is white, with black on the mailt]

The Tropic Birds (Phaethontidce) are very beautiful sea birds, wit|
white plumage more or less flushed with pink, and sometimes also wit
black markings, and with very long pointed tails. Their bills are shoj
and conical, and their feet very tiny. There are about half-a-doze
species, all frequenting tropical seas. They cannot endure confinemen
The same applies to the Frigate Birds (Fregatkke), large sea birc
with very long narrow wings and forked tails, which one often se&lt;
floating above tropical coasts. They are black, but the male has
naked red pouch under his bill, which he can inflate at pleasure. T our
birds have white heads and necks. They have been successfully kej
for a time in some zoological gardens, especially in New York.
Gannets (Sulidoe) are large birds, with pointed tails and laq
bills bare at the base.
The Common Gannet ( Sula hasana), well known on our coasts,
all white save for its black flights ; there are many other species, most,
white, or brown with more or less white, which cannot be enumerate
here. Gannets do fairly well in confinement, but have little to recor.j

gardens.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
Swans, together with Geese and Ducks, make up the Anserii&apos;orr
Order, which is known by having webbed feet, but the big toe fre
and flattened bills provided with lamella) or plates. Swans compose
small, very special group of Palmipedes ; one species may be looke
upon as aberrant and intermediate with other kinds. They are larg
birds of quarrelsome disposition, but given sufficient space an
water they are both beautiful and imposing.
Swans are a great ornament to a piece of water, but unless they ca
be accommodated with a really large territory and plenty of watei
enough to enable each pair to isolate themselves, it is better to giv
each pair a separate pond or tank, which, however, may also b
inhabited by aquatic birds of other species. They feed on grass, aquati
plants and grain, and must be enabled to obtain all the vegetable foo
which they need to keep them in good health. Generally speaking, Swan
do not mind cold. Although pairs of the same species or of differen
species fight savagely for the purpose of keeping to themselves a stretc
of water which would really be large enough for a dozen of them, the
do not as a rule interfere with other swimming birds, except the large?
kinds, and those in particular which are coloured like themselves
which last is a habit common to all birds.
The sexes are alike, but the female is smaller than her mate. The
are monogamous and pair for life, and should one perish the widowe
bird often pines away and dies of grief. A male which has lost its mat
often attacks a fresh one, but may, after a time, get used to and accep
her. Swans are migratory birds, as are most Palmipedes.
The Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) is the White Swan, commonly me
with everywhere. It is perhaps the most handsome, but also the mos
vicious of all its race. A breeding male not only tries to kill every othc
Swan he comes across, but attacks all other kinds of web-footed birch
The young in their first plumage are grey, which is the case with most c
the genus ; they turn white after their second summer. The so-calle
&apos;\0x25A0 Polish Swan ( C . immutahilis) is nothing more than an albin
variety of the domestic bird. Adults have grey feet and paler bill?

The Wild or Wiiooper Swan (C. cygnus) is found in Northern
I irope and Asia. It has a musical cry like the sound of a shrill trumpet,
is distinguished by the large yellow spot at the sides of the beak,
has bred in confinement, but more often the eggs are unfertile ;
I ien this happens, the male bird should be changed for another. This
ecies is very migratory, and once it takes to flight it quickly
&apos; sappears.
Bewick's Swan ( C . bewicki) resembles the above-mentioned but
decidedly smaller, besides having the yellow spots much diminished,
i &amp;gt;t extending beyond the nostrils. It has been bred occasionally. It
i as quarrelsome as the other species.
The Black-necked Swan ( C . melanocoryphus) is a South
iinerican species with striking plumage. Its body is white, head and
*ck black with white eyebrows ; bill bluish grey and a large red
(jittle. It does very well in confinement, but should have a shelter in
inter lest its feet get frozen. The cygnets have a pretty habit of
imbing on to the backs of their parents by means of their bills and
king refuge under their wing-feathers, leaving their heads outside,
tiey are somewhat delicate, need fine weather, and plenty of water-
eed. The female is the smaller, but has a wattle.

Canadian Goose can stand up to it. The female is smaller and has
shorter neck than her mate. It raises its wings like the Mute S&apos;wai
when flying it makes a peculiar but musical noise. It is a native
Australia. It will not stay if full-winged.
The Coscoroba Swan (Coscoroha coscoroba) is probably only a hu.

in winter. Its eggs should be hatched under a hen and the youi
reared on duckweed and fresh grass. Should the Swan wish to s

seldom rears them. In this species the sexes are alike, but the female

ny friends, namely its high-pitched, oft-repeated shriek and its
, tefulness towards other birds. Two pairs of Peach-faced should on
; account be kept together, and it is not advisable to trust them with
iller and weaker birds. The sexes are somewhat similar, but the hen

jTher towards the breast in the male than in the female. This member

in Germany as long ago as 1882. The first recorded success in Great
tain was that of Mr. J. Cronkshaw, who reared two young in 1895 ;

Mr. Cocksedge bred eight in 1899. More recent successes are those
the late Dr. Lovell-Keays, Dr. Amsler, Mr. T. Hebb, Mr. H. E. Brigl
Mr. E. J. Boosey, and the Marquess of Tavistock. They take readily
nest-boxes or hollow logs, which they proceed to cram with strips
bark, hay, grass, etc., carried in the usual manner under the feathers
the lower back or upper tail-coverts. The number of eggs varies frc
five to seven, which the hen alone incubates, being fed by the ecu
Three broods are frequently produced, and even more, Dr. Russ stai
that when not prevented, six and even seven broods have been produc
in succession. After three nests their activities should be discourag
for a time. Incubation appears to take nineteen to twenty da 1
and the eggs, which are rather pointed, measure approximate
23-5 mm. x 17-5 mm. The young have no red colour on the forehea
which is yellowish ; the rose colour of the cheeks and throat very pa
Insectivorous food can be provided with advantage when young a
being fed, and some parents partake of this quite freely, suggesti
that in the wild state insect food forms part of their diet.
Little information is available as to the habits of this species
the wild state, but Andersson in his Birds of Damaraland , writes
follows : " This species is always observed in small flocks, and seldc
far away from water, to which it resorts at least once a day, and
consequently not a bad guide to a thirsty traveller ; though, if he
inexperienced it would hardly avail him much, as it frequently happe
that the drinking places resorted to by this and other water-loving bii
are but of small compass and strangely situated.
" This species is very swift of flight, and the little flocks in which
is observed seem to flash upon the sight as they change their feedir
grounds or pass to and from their drinking-place ; their flight, liowev
is only for a comparatively short distance at a time. They utter raj
and shrill notes when on the wing, or when suddenly disturbed j
alarmed. Their food consists of large berries and berry-like seeds, j
Andersson then proceeds to make a statement which has caus
much controversy :--
" This bird does not make any nest of its own, but takes possessi
of those belonging to other birds, especially the Social Weaver B.
(Philceterus socius ) and the White-browed Weaver Bird ( Ploceipass

tali). I cannot say whether it forcibly e&apos;ects the rightful owners of
ie nests or merely occupies such as have been-abandoned, but in
case of the first-named species, I have seen the Parrots and Weaver

Mr. Seth-Smith probably provides the true solution in his standard
k, ParraJceets. On page 147, he writes :--

" Although we cannot doubt Andersson's statement that the huge
f -s of the Social and White-browed Weaver Birds are often used by
&apos; pornis roseicollis as nesting places, his contention that this species
ds no nest of its own cannot be accepted by those who have known
bird under more or less natural conditions in large aviaries in this
ntry and on the Continent.
&apos; " There is little doubt that the enormous umbrella-shaped nests of

Weaver Birds, which are described as consisting of 4 whole cartloads
rass ', are used merely as receptacles for the nests of the Lovebirds,
sibly in districts where large trees, containing suitable holes and
vices for nests, are scarce." Some aviculturists have managed to
p Peach-faced in large cages and have even induced them to breed,
unless the cages are of very exceptional size, sooner or later they
elop into " feather-pluckers ". The Marquess of Tavistock has
d this species at liberty, but found that it did not stay well.
A very interesting variety of the Peach-faced was received at the

Me of the body, so that the bird was rosy-pink over the greater part

The ever-popular and accommodating Budgerigar has been used
cessfully on several occasions to hatch the deserted eggs of Roseicollis .
Russ had young reared in this way, and M. P. Paillard, of
&amp;quot;deaux, met with similar success. Incidentally, Mr. J. W . Marsden,
lue Budgerigar pioneer, once had a Black-cheeked Lovebird fledgling
cessfully reared by Budgerigars. In conclusion, the only talking
/ebird I ever heard of was a Peach-faced, hand-reared by
. Amsler. This bird, whenever he had misbehaved himself by giving

So far as foreign birds are concerned, the breeding season of 1
seems to have been a very bad one. The early part was abnornu
dry with cold winds, a condition that is most unfavourable. Ci
eggs, or no eggs at all, or young birds dead in the shell were repoi
from most aviaries. And when the damp weather came there
rain to excess with very little sunshine and a low temperature.
Mr. Walter Goodfellow has just returned home with a collect
of choice birds, amongst which may be mentioned 3 Twelve-wi
Birds of Paradise, 2 Red Birds of Paradise, 1 Lesser Bird, 2 Wilso
1 Magnificent, mostly adult males in full plumage ; 1 Great B1
Cockatoo, 2 Pesquet's Parrots, male and female ; 1 Goffin's Cockal
7 Varied Lorikeets, 8 Black-capped Fruit Doves, 5 Treron vernc
an Owl (Huhua orientalis). Most of these birds are in beautiful plum
and bear testimony to the great care that has been bestowed u
them during the voyage.
The Ibis for July contains two papers of interest to aviculturi!
Both are from the pen of Mr. F. E. Blaauw, who describes the succes
breeding at Gooilust, Holland, of the Blue-winged Goose of Abyssi
(Cyanocheyi cyanopterus) and the Bare-eyed Cockatoo ( Cacc
gynopis) during 1926. Of the first of these little was known u
Mr. Blaauw obtained seven examples in 1923. He finds that t!
are very nocturnal in their habits, nest-building, courting, and mat
all taking place during the night. Five eggs, of an elongated shj
and cream-coloured, were laid, and four goslings were hatched b
domestic hen after thirty days' incubation, all being rea
successfully.
The Bare-eyed Cockatoos which bred were very old birds wl
had previously lived in the Zoological Gardens of Hanover,
probably never before had an opportunity of nesting. A single
was laid in a log nest. Only the female incubated, and a chick hate
after three weeks, but did not leave the nest until 9 weeks' &lt;
when it was the image of its parents.

[ to discuss the many problems that confront aviculturists. Most
unately the weather was ideal.
In a few months' time the large collection of birds in the Small
d House at the Zoological Gardens will be transferred to their
!v quarters in the old Reptile House, which is being converted into
up-to-date Bird House. There will be some twenty large wall
es suitable for Toucans or Birds of Paradise, three very large
tral aviaries, and some thirty or more small cages, while on the
th and west sides of the house will be a number of outdoor aviaries,
e house will be well lighted by electricity, both ordinary and " sun-
it " lamps being employed during dull weather, while palm-trees
1 hanging baskets of ferns will add to the beauty of the house,
ich will provide far better accommodation for the birds than they
oy at present.

Amongst the new arrivals at the Zoological Gardens are two
imples of the fine Derbyan Parrakeet ( Palceornis derbyana) from
ina, one of which has been presented to the Society by Mr. Eustace,
! other acquired by purchase. It is long since an example of this
[*e species, a coloured plate of which we published in June, 1926,

image, the other showing signs of melanism on the head.
Mr. Allen Silver has recently constructed a very useful series of
aries which he believes to be mouse- and rat-proof as well as escape-
i )of, the birds being fed from outside window-doors without the
1 3essity of the owner entering. Before completion, however, some
ey and Green Singing-finches did escape, but they did not go away,

Sir,--I am sending you a line to say that one young Bar
(Abyssinian) left the nest yesterday, and in spite of flying straight i
some hot water as hot as I could bear my hands in, with which I a
washing some pans, seems none the worse to-day, and the pare
are still feeding it assiduously. I regret to say the other I foi
dead on its back below the nest to-day--between the seed-box and
wall; I suppose it came out of the nest this morning, got in there, i
could not get on to its legs ; it is bad luck. I examined the nesting bb
--no nest, no eggs, or remains of any, and very clean. Yet I never ,*
the old birds bring out excrement, but they must have done so. Tlj
fed the young for choice on mealworms, but used a great number
gentles and possibly a certain amount of currants and soft f&lt;
mixture, also any other insects they could get, including dead hi
bottles, which we gave them. I only hope they may nest again :
I should like to see the eggs. Am I the first to have bred them ? Plej

flew this week ; about a day after I found one on floor with hr
bashed in, another dead next day plump as a Partridge and no sigrl
mishap, and the fourth is neither in the nest nor elsewhere to be seei
so one out of four remains !

[To breed any species of Barbet in captivity is a great achievem
and there is little doubt that Captain Reeve is the first to succ&lt;
with Trachyphonus margaritatus. Writing on 15th July he says t
the young bird is feeding itself, and it may therefore be conside
as fully reared. --Ed.]

jaws. I have never kept any of the varieties described, but I have
t a number of the larger ones : these seem to vary in disposition
ost as much as the Grey Parrot, although I think on the whole these
less really bad screamers ; the best-tempered one I have had was
feed and Yellow, with whom one could do almost anything. This
; closely rivalled by a Blue and Yellow, who quite made up for
asional playful nips by being quite a good, if somewhat monotonous
;er. It is very fond of saying in a most sorrowful tone " Poor
La ", and then looking round for approval. One curious habit
ave noticed with all Parrots, but more especially with Macaws,
lie way they open and close the iris with great rapidity, especially
[ m excited.
I have only had one Macaw that I really could do nothing with :
t was a Blue and Yellow, but I rather fancy it was caught as an
bird. Macaws make charming pets in many ways, but they are
her noisy and appallingly destructive.
By far the tamest Parrot I have ever had is a Hawkhead ; when I
t had her, she was extremely nervous, but with a little coaxing
became very tame. A favourite game is to play dead, and she
1 lie on her back on one's hand and go perfectly limp and will allow
self to be passed from hand to hand. She behaves very much as
^ cribed in Green's Parrots in Captivity, except that she has never
*wn any sign of talking or even trying to talk. All day she keeps
a sort of " Chuck " noise, but when excited it becomes much higher
 |ched and very rapid ; occasionally she whistles odd notes, but has
\0x25A0er tried to make a tune. She is most acrobatic and very quick,

with none of the laborious caution of the Grey Parrot, preferring rath
to jump than climb. At night she sleeps in a box attached to the do
of her cage. She always retires at about 7 p.m., even when it is lig
in the evenings.
She does well on a good plain Parrot mixture with a little apj
or toast crust occasionally.
Apparently the crest is only thrown up after preening the feathc
or when defending itself ; she will terrify my Grey Parrot if it interfer
by throwing up her crest and giving short, sharp hisses.

Sir, --One bird which was of special interest, from a spectacull
point, of view, has been accidentally omitted from the list of birds
prey published in the Magazine for June and July ; and as it was vei
interesting when alive on account of the dark brown erectile crest (
its head and the long loud cry it uttered (rather like that of Pel's Ov
see 1921 Vol., p. 154), a brief account from an old note-book may be :
interest to readers. It reads " Beautiful Wood Hawk (Dryotriorcl
spectabilis) from Lagos. Scalp, back, wings, tail, dark brown wi
broad transverse darker bars on wing quills. Beak black. Fa
around eyes and throat, pale brown, with dark moustache at each si*
and a narrower dark median streak on throat. Breast and abdomi
pale brown, with dark broad transverse bars. Legs yellow. We
marked dark brown erectile crest. Utters long loud cry."
It was a largish bird, rather Buzzard-like in body appearan
excluding crest, and was in the Eastern Aviary of the Zoologic
Gardens about the year 1906. So far as I know, it unfortunate
did not live long. I believe the first exhibited.

By J. Delacour
From the time of its discovery in 1895 up to 1915, when three more
lecimens were found in Siam, this fine bird had only been known
xmgh the three original specimens sent to the Paris Museum by
ther Renauld, from Central Annam. It is one of the rarest birds
! skin collections.
Since I have undertaken the ornithological exploration of French
lo-China, in connexion with my friend M. P. Yabouille, Civil Officer
1 presently Travelling Commissioner in Annam, we have procured
lumber of Ground Cuckoos, several of which are now alive in our
aries at Hue (Annam) and four in our President s aviaries at
xwarren.
I Of the latter I brought one home in 1926, the first to reach Europe
v r e. It was sent by me to Clcres with another one in April of that
ir - Both birds travelled quite well, and arrived safely, although
,lr plumage was rather damaged ; unfortunately, one got its leg
&apos;ken and had to be killed, as it had lost it whole, being otherwise
i de healthy. The sound specimen was soon put into an outdoor

Ground Cuckoos are quite easy to cater for ; at liberty, they f

they eat cut-up meat, earthworms, mealworms, and insectivor
mixture, even bread and boiled maize.
The present plate, drawn from life, is worth any lengthened desc

From our investigations, it appears that this species inha|:

Very little is known on the bird's habits at liberty ; they live in
thickest jungle, where undergrowth, entangled vine, and boultj
make it most impenetrable. Only once did we see one flying low ac|
the path, at the Col de Nuages, in Central Annam, one of their favoul
haunts. Chicks remain unknown so far, though eggs have been j
in Mr. Ezra's aviaries. This Cuckoo's ordinary voice is a low grji
but it also utters sometimes a whistling call, resembling thatl:
the Argus Pheasant or the Brown Owl.
It is rather difficult at first to keep several Ground Cuckoos in
same aviary, as they are rather quarrelsome at the beginning; \0x25A0!
it can be done, and we have kept six in two aviaries, four in
and two in another one.
It would be most desirable to breed these rare birds in captivi
as there is little chance, owing to their retiring habits, of ever fine!
their nests at liberty.

This very rare bird has been a source of great interest to me. The
igle specimen brought over last year has done very well, in spite
the long wet winter. Again this year, M. Delacour very kindly
night me three more of these rare birds. All the four birds were put
o a large aviary. As they all look alike I thought I could sex them

though not very friendly, they are not really spiteful with one another.
iey fly about a good deal and perch sometimes, but most of the
ae they are on the ground. They eat a good deal of meat and earth-
rms and are very fond of mice, and sometimes will swallow as many
four one after another. They are delightful aviary birds, and quite
rdy and easy to keep in an aviary, where they will not molest the
.allest bird. On 3rd July the boy, while feeding the birds in the
iary, found an egg under a small tree in a nest consisting of a few
igs and leaves. This egg disappeared about an hour after it was seen
d most probably it was eaten up by some of the other occupants
the aviary. I don't quite know who the culprit was, but as the
ary is occupied by Babblers, Boilers, Bails, and Starlings, I am not
prised that the egg disappeared. The same evening I caught up all
' above birds, leaving the four Cuckoos by themselves, with only a few
rmless birds. On the 4th another egg was laid. This egg I removed
once from the nest, and sent to Lord Bothschild, as I believe it is
&apos; } first known egg of this bird. I noticed that all four birds were
\0x25A0rying twigs and leaves to the same nest. On the 6th of July I
pnd another egg in the nest. This egg the birds were allowed to
ubate, and I am certain that three out of the four birds sat. They
ubated steadily for ten days, when this egg also disappeared, and
st probably was eaten by the birds themselves. The egg looks very
ch like that of a Bantam, but is rather rounder, white in colour
h a rough shell. If they winter safely, I hope to be more successful

The Black-cheeked Lovebird was discovered by Dr. A. H. |
Kirkman, on the Muguazi Biver, in September, 1904. The first sir
collection, consisting of five birds, arrived in England, via Germai
in April, 1908. Three of the five went to the late Mr. Reginj
Phillipps, and the remaining pair to the late Mr. H. D. Astley ; 1
latter pair formed the subject of an excellent coloured plate in ij
Avicultural Magazine, October, 1908. Further small collects
subsequently arrived, and Black-cheeks proved excellent amc
birds and free-breeders.
During the years of the war the species almost died out in Engla:|
and pairs were practically unobtainable. Last year, howe\ ; .
Mr. Chapman received several very large consignments, and Bla
cheeks would seem to be well-established once more. Some lit
difficulty is experienced in obtaining true pairs, as the sexes are so v
alike. Mr. Phillipps, after exhaustive observation, came to the cl
elusion that the only way to sex them with any degree of certaii
was by noting the colour of the iris, which differs in the two sex!
that of the male being pale yellow-brown, and of the female da
yellow-brown. This difference probably proves correct in ma
instances, but cannot be relied on as an infallible guide, as the j
will vary in colour in any particular bird according to its state of heal;
age, light, and various other causes. When a number are seen togetlf
pairs can be picked out with certainty by observing the shape of tb
heads and beaks, which are noticeably broader across the top in 1
males. The female would also appear to be slightly smaller a

Jer in colouring, the forehead and front of crown is darker and
ler; the orbital ring narrower ; the beak less suffused at base
h white ; while the front edge of the wing is slightly yellow in the
le and green in the female.
Black-cheeks nest very readily, and I have before me the names of
ne twenty successful breeders. Mr. Phillipps was the first, a pair
his original three birds went to nest about two months after their
ival, laid four eggs, all of which hatched and the young reared.
. Phillipps has written in a most interesting manner on A. nigrigenis,
i members should refer to his various accounts in the Avicultural
,gazine as follows i--New Series, Yol. VI (1908), pp. 206-10, 318-29 ;
1. VII (1909), pp. 31-6, 148-56.
The nesting arrangements are similar to those of A. roseicollis,
;ept that the nesting material is usually carried in the beak, the
Ik of the work being done by the female. The eggs vary considerably
shape, but are usually rather elongated and pear-shaped and
proximately measures 22'3 mm. by 16&apos;9 mm. The usual clutch is
ir, but the females seem to be in the habit, after disposing of the
;t clutch, to lay immediately an additional three in the same nest,
e female alone incubates for seventeen to eighteen days, the male
t seeming to feed her until after the young are hatched. The
lowing description of the young is taken from one of Mr. Phillipps'
iicles (Avicultural Magazine, 1909, pp. 33-4) :--
" It was on 23rd July that I first saw a young bird in the nest.
ie could only see a portion of the inside, but a nestling a few days
1 was visible. On the 26th I saw two nearly naked little things
latting side by side, like a couple of young pigeons. On the 29th,
\0x25A0 *. Seth-Smith inspected the nest, and reported four young of different
3S, all right. On 4th August I just noticed a touch of colour, one
irdy youngster having a pale yellow-red beak. On the 12th, the
. &amp;gt;wns of the nestlings had all the appearance of being fully feathered.
l 13th August the two elder, after playing possum for a moment,
&amp;gt;od boldly up, raising their heads towards the opening. Along
1 fir backs and down their necks there were the usual tracks of feathers
t they were far from being fully covered ; their tails, less than an
( )h being visible, showed the subterminal band of black quite well

marked, especially in the eldest, where the markings were of a deep
black and much more clearly defined. The forehead showed the colo
of the adult, or seemed to ; and the salmon-red patch on the chest w
conspicuous. The nostrils were quite covered and hidden; I cou
not manage to get a glint of light on to an eye--in the shade of the lo
the irides seemed to be quite black.
" The first young bird to leave the nest appeared on 22nd Augus
but, for a few days at any rate, he returned to the nest after a sho
outing. No. 2, I think a female, appeared on the 25th. The gre&lt;
of the general plumage of these two birds was at first very dull, b
rapidly became brighter, and the flanks yellower ; the breast-pat(
at first was very bright; the brown of the forehead extended farth
back in " A " than in " B ", and then there came some green or greenis
The black on the sides of the chin seemed to be as deep as in the parent
but only a little colouring extended upwards behind the eyes. T1
head of " B " seemed to be broader than that of " A ", and, althom
the younger, " she " seemed to be the larger bird. But all tl
differences of shading quickly assumed a dull level--the young and tl
old became very much alike. Even the yellow in the red of the bea]!
of the fledglings seems to have gone. No. 3 had joined the group (
the 27th, as usual in the quiet of the early morning ; and the fourth ai
last came out on the following day, carefully tended by one of i
parents. I think the latter must have been " hurried " out of tl
log, for it was less forward than the others, and was fed by the ma
for some days after the others were feeding themselves. They quick
took to nibbling at green food, but on and from the 30th the three we
feeding on dry seed, etc., with their father."
I am afraid the foregoing is rather long, but it seemed of sufficiei
interest to stand reprinting.
Black-cheeks are exceptionally shy when breeding and on no accoU]
should the nest be interfered with in any way. The young in the ne
appear to be practically mute, neither calling for food nor audib
responding to its arrival.
Among the more successful with this species may be mention*
the late Mr. H. W. Mathias, the late Dr. Lovell Keays, Capt. G. 1
Rattigan, Mr. J. Sumner Marriner, Mr. Id. Willford, and Mr. W. Shor

A basket is required 14 inches long, 6 or 7 wide, and 6 inches deep,
&amp;gt;sed with a lid, with a stick that runs through the wicker staples,
should be of a light wicker-work, so as to be airy. Have two squares

idy to gape for food, and can raise itself on its feet. Two are easier

Place one rubber square in, and lay one of the flannel squares into

cover them, and as they get older they will not need even this. It is
sential they should be in a warm hole with air round them, rather
an folded closely. They must be able to potter about, inside the
mnel-lined basket and not be swaddled tight.
Between the wall of the basket and the flannel, keep a fresh bit of
&apos;own bread in a wisp of tissue paper, so that it keeps clean, and that

If they both take well, you can rear them ; if only one does so, p
the other back in the nest, and try another bird, who may take fo
better.
Brown bread, mouth-moistened--almost fluid--is enough at firs
but as they get older you must mix it with little mouthsful of bitt-
and peeled apple--or chewed lettuces--or the pulp of grapes, or banan
and a hard-boiled egg occasionally.
Even from the first, small drinks of warm water are good, i
tlle y g e f older this is essential. You will know when they want feedii
by their calling for it. Never force them to feed, but persuade then
once they get the habit they will let you know when they need i
For the first four or five days feed them every three hours or so. I toe
mine about with me in its basket, while it was still in down--and whi
in the house it is wise to take the basket from room to room with on
so that one can hear them when they need feeding.
Change the flannel squares repeatedly ; it is important to keep the
clean ; be sure the clean squares you put in are quite dry. When the
feet got clotted at all, I stood them for a minute or so in a soap dn
of warm water.
Do not line the basket with hay, as this fosters disease of the
lungs. Let them have exercise as they get older ; climbing about yoi
lap and up to your shoulders.
Be very careful not to let them drop out of your hands, nor let tl
basket drop , a fall kills a bird from shock. I think this is wh
fledglings picked up in spring, having fallen from the nest, so seldoi
live. I tied a label on to the handle of my basket with a big notice-

and being casually shifted or jarred in ignorance. When almos
fully plumed four meals a day suffice--but leave a millet spray in th
basket. Let the basket stand somewhere near your bed, so that yo
can hear them when they wake, and feed them. I found that min

a time ; and take time over it. Feeding three, I found, took twenty
nutes.
At a month old they should have millet in the spray put in their
sket with them, so that they can nibble the seed when they like.
They should often be lifted out of the basket and allowed to potter
out ; they like to stretch their wings, which they repeatedly do,
engthening the muscles in preparation for flight, by winnowing
e air.
The advantage of bringing up by hand in this manner is that you
ve birds so absolutely and entirely tame that you are able to know
mi from a new angle. You see their ways, their movements, their
itty loves and jealousies, their playfulness, and their exquisite
luty, at close range. And all their feelings they expend on you,
ing to meet you as you enter the aviary, and not only tame to you,
t regarding all humans as their friends. In fact, it is a question
birds thus reared will mate. They appear to become disoriented
-m their own kind. This is true of the bird I reared last year ; but
1 may be because I reared one, by itself.
It will be interesting to see if this will be the case equally of the
ree I have reared this year. They have now grown to full size, and
) in no whit different from the three I left to the parent birds, except
the matter of tameness.
The parent birds were given me two years ago by Lord Tavistock ;

the right kind of nest-box, as well as in other nesting details,
recommended a tall construction in appearance like a grandfath
clock, filled up to within a foot and a half from the hole with dry w
pith--the light, porous stuff you find inside a hollow tree that is inva
by decay. The hen nested in April, the eggs hatched on the 18tl
May. I took the three young I intended to rear by hand out of the i
on the 5th of June, and freed them into another larger aviary on
7th of July, flying well and able to feed themselves.
Of the three I left to the parent birds to rear, one already i
free, with its father returning through the funnel, to feed ; and I s
bring the other two on to do the same. The extreme beauty of tl
birds in flight cannot be described. I have not a wide experiei
but among the species of the Parrot tribe that I do know, I give
Rock Peplars the palm, for they are without the two great disabili
of their race---they are not noisy, and their beaks are too soft to be i
to hurt. They have also a further quality of grace--one by no me
of small account in the communal life of an aviary--they are ge
and peaceful birds, and do not molest their neighbours.

llar hollow tree trunk with a natural bottom or with no bottom at

the cavity being filled up to the required height with earth and
uld taken from the interior of a decaying tree. Hollow tree trunks
terribly heavy and cumbersome to move and often difficult to
i ain, but the results more than justify their use in districts where
: climate is none too favourable to aviculture. When first I started
birds in the new movable aviaries I provided artificial nest-boxes
&apos; h wooden bottoms covered with a layer of dry, decayed wood and
lg up in the flight. Those for Kings and Crimson-wings were nearly
t. deep and the bottom rested on the ground. In these boxes the
t season I bred two or three lots of very healthy Ringnecks, a few
dthy Barrabands, and one healthy Rock Peplar. Kings and Crimson-
lgs, however, were a dismal failure, the young either dying of
3umonia at an early age or becoming hopelessly rickety about the
le they began to feather. One young Crimson-wing was bred in a
rnral tree trunk with an artificial wooden bottom. When she left
i nest she was so rickety that she was quite unable to fly and could
,rcely crawl and remained in this condition for several weeks ; but
ange to say she slowly improved and in the end became quite
i decent bird with good use of her limbs : indeed, I believe she
entually laid eggs. This proves that it was her early environment
d not inherited weakness of constitution that was the cause of her
bleness. The two following seasons yielded less satisfactory results

was a failure. All the young Ringnecks, Barrabands and Rock Pepl
died of pneumonia quicker than they had done in the flights, and yoi
Browns, Crimson-wings and Ringnecks were crippled with rick*
although they had nearly a foot of earth at the bottom of their ne;
separating them from the wooden floor. As on the former occasi
however, the Crimson-wings made surprising progress when they w
taken out of the aviary shelter.
This season I substituted Vita glass for ordinary glass in all
shelters, and removed the trays at the bottom when the birds w
breeding, admitting far more air and moisture. These alterati-
were, in the main, useless so long as natural perpendicular tree trui
were not employed. Two pairs of Ringnecks had artificial boxes
the shelters. One lot of young died when a few days old ; the oth
died of rickets soon after leaving the nest, though they were nice strc
birds at the start. Another pair had a natural log hung horizonta
in the shelter. The hen--a good mother--lost both her broods wl
a few days old. Yellow-rumps were given a bottomless, mould-fill
perpendicular box in the shelter for their first nest, and in it rea
five strong young. For their second nest they had a horizontal natu
log in the shelter and the young died when a few days old. But h
similar log, similarly placed, Rosellas reared a healthy brood. A R j
rump Parrakeet paired to a Hooded had an artificial box in the shel
with the trays left in. Her two young hybrids lived to fend for the
selves, but were weak on the wing and are now dead.
The Rock Peplar had a bottomless, mould-filled perpendicii
box in the shelter, and lost her young of pneumonia when ab&lt;
ten days old. Another hen who laid on the ground in the open Aid
reared a strong brood.
Crimson-wings lost their first brood in a rather small, draugh
bottomless natural log in the open flight, but reared a second bro
well in a good tree trunk in the flight.
Malabars reared a strong brood in the shelter in a natural perp&lt;
dicular tree trunk with a natural bottom. Barrabands reared a stro
brood in a bottomless, mould-filled perpendicular box in the flight.
The results go to prove that the natural perpendicular tree trU
with natural bottom or mould gives good results either in flight

ter, preferably in the former, for hardy species not subject to egg-
ling. The artificial box with no bottom but partly filled with mould
y give good results with the hardier species but in the shelter it is
lse for Rock Peplars.
The horizontal natural log is, in the shelter, little better than the
ficial box and will only do for very hardy birds and for species (oddly
ugh in most other ways delicate), which, like Many-colours and
ss Parrakeets, are resistant to the normal ill-effect of the combina-
&apos; i. of artificial box and shelter. Pneumonia is not encouraged by the
st and mouldy character of the interior of a natural tree trunk,
1 it is not in the least discouraged by the use of disinfectants, nor
the extreme dryness of the nest and its immediate surroundings,
kets seem primarily due to artificial wooden floors, even when these
covered with a thick layer of earth, and it makes no difference
ether the nest stands out in the fresh air and sunshine or whether
.sina dark place with a closer atmosphere : diet makes no difference
ier. Experiences with Crimson-wings are especially telling. Hen
. 1 in 1921 reared in the flight a rickety young one in a natural
3 trunk with an artificial wooden bottom. In 1922 and 1923 she
red healthy young in the flight in a perpendicular tree trunk with
atural bottom. In 1924 she lost hybrid young by a Princess of
les' Parrakeet in an artificial box in the flight. In 1925 she reared
lthy hybrids in the natural tree trunk which had been the scene of
previous successes. Hen No. 2 in 1926 had rickety young in a
: in the shelter and, after a failure in a rather poor log, reared
lthy young in a perpendicular mould-filled tree trunk in the flight

II. L. Sick--The White-cheeked Finch-lark
I have not found them very interesting. About the middle of J
last year I suddenly noticed that I had two full plumaged- cocks
1 conclude that they take two years to reach maturity. If this 1
comes from the south of the Equator it may have been hatched ah
November, 1924, which would make it about eighteen months.
When watching my birds on 9th June last I saw a harmless-look
Turnix strolling over the grass : as it came close to the stem of a sn
cupressus tree the pair of Finch-larks suddenly flew up and attacl
it, one bird perching on its back and pecking at its head ; this co
only mean a nest. On examination I found the cock bird squatt
on the ground just where the grass meets the soil close to the stem
the tree. A yard in one direction the Turnix had a nest ; in the k
grass close by a hen Harlequin Quail was incubating seven eggs. J
to hatch in about a week. There was no chance of a ground b
rearing any young with a lot of Quail chicks scrambling over evervthi
so a risk had to be taken. I formed a fence with wire-netting ab(
2 feet away all round the nest ; of course, the birds flew away duri
the process, but a few minutes afterwards the hen was back a^a
The nest was only a slight hollow, rather thickly lined with hay, a
contained only one egg, coloured very much like the dark bro
variety of that of a Skylark, much smaller, rather longer, and Li
pointed in shape. Both birds incubated till 21st June. I fancied tl:
my going into the aviary to feed the Quail chicks had disturbed the
but there was no signs of a chick in the egg when blown. On 23
June they were incubating one egg again, in the same nest. On 7
July they had deserted it: there was no chick in that either. Tb
have not nested since. Only laying one egg seems rather curious, b
a single bird was reared in 1917 by Mr. Shore-Baily, and Avicultue.

STEAMER DUCKS AND SHEATHBILLS

Through the kindness of Dr. Stanley Kemp and Mr. A. G. Bennett,
jjthe " Discovery " expedition the Zoological Society has received
r examples of the Steamer Duck (Tachyeres cinereus) and five of the
: low-billed Sheathbill (Chionis alba) from the Falkland and South
tland Islands.
The Steamer Duck is a large, heavily built bird with a dark brownish
k d and the body more or less spotted with grey, the bill of the drake
nge yellow and that of the duck greenish yellow, the feet also
ng yellow. The under surface is white in both sexes. There would
t&amp;gt;ear to be two distinct types of this Duck, the one greyish in colour,
'act in very old birds the head as well as the body becoming light
y, the other type being mostly reddish in colour and smaller,
reover, the larger grey or greyish birds have short wings and are
titless, whereas the smaller redder birds have longer wings and
capable of flight.
The larger type is met with in the Straits of Magellan and the open
, whereas the smaller birds frequent more the inland lakes of Southern
ith America. These two types or races of Steamer Duck have long
n a puzzle to ornithologists, for it is known that the one is not the
mg of the other as has been suggested, and, moreover, it has been
perved that the two sometimes interbreed.
: Steamer Ducks are so named on account of their habit of swimming
h great rapidity with the aid of both wings and feet, a mode of
*gression that has been likened to
steaming
They spend a good
i 1 of their time sitting on the rocks, and have their nests beneath the
er of some bush or rock.

THE NESTING HABITS OF HONEY-GUIDES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94354196" page_id="58075722"  page_num="Page 247" year="" vol="">
Sir _Mr. Sydney Porter is to be envied his acquaintance with such a
rming bird as " William ", the Yellow-throated Honey-guide : at
tj same time he is to be commiserated with, in that he was unable
bring him back to England.
Concerning the parasitic nesting of Indicator , Lydekker writes
ild Life of the World, vol. iii, pp. 150, 151) :--
" According to a recent account, the widely distributed African
low-throated Honey-guide ( Indicator major) in most cases makes
of the nesting-hole of Spreo bicolor, a bird which, like the Honey-
des themselves, lays white eggs. The Honey-guide's eggs are,
! vever, less elongated than those of its hosts, among which are certain
cies of Swallows, as well as other birds laying white eggs. Whether
Honey-guides lay more than one egg in the Spreo s nest is not
ntioned, but it is stated that these birds whenever possible break
1 1 eggs of their hosts with their beaks, thus ensuring that their own
5 or eggs shall alone hatch. The most remarkable point connected
:h this egg-breaking business is that the Spreos or other hosts should
itinue to sit. Their parasitic habits being apparently well known,
s Honey-guides are in most cases fiercely attacked by the owners of
; nests visited, and in some cases the resistance prevents the intruders
m breaking the original eggs. In such instances the young Honey-
des probably eject their fellow-nestlings, and it is noteworthy that
1 ) beaks of the former are furnished with powerful hooks, which
appear in the adult. This, it is conjectured, is a provision to assist
im in ejecting the other occupants of the nest. It has also been

noticed that a young Honey-guide taken from the nest of a Diamc
Sparrow (Petronia petronella) was very large for its age ; here ag;
exhibiting a Cuckoo-like feature. The mention of a single nestli
in this instance suggests that the Honey-guides lay only one eijg
a nest. As Indicator is common to Africa, Malaya, and the Himakr
it would be interesting to ascertain if the parasitic habits of the Afric
species are shared by their Asiatic cousins ; but as the Himalay
bird is believed to lack the ' honey-guiding ' habit of the Sou
African species, it may also differ in the matter of egg-laying."
Perhaps Mr. Porter, if he has had the opportunity of studyi
the nesting habits of the Indicatoridse, would be so good as to commf
on the above, and make known his own observations.

S IR &amp;gt; There is a slight error in Mrs. Prestwich's article, where I a
credited with finding the Peach-faced Lovebird a poor stayer at libert
It is the Black-cheeked that gave disappointing results. While I cann
say that I have never lost a Peach-face by straying, I got very fs
results vith them when free in the garden. Many young were reare
and the old birds did not appear to be migratory in the autumn.

Sir, W ith the acquisition of two new specimens by the Zoologic.
Society the number of this rare Parrakeet in captivity in this counti
v ould appear to be raised to four. A male bird came into my possessic
a few months ago, and has since done well. He was in perfect coi
dition on arrival, although he had evidently been closely confined f(
a very long time as he had the cage-cramped habits of a bird whic
has forgotten how to use its wings or even climb. For several da^
after he had been turned into an aviary it was necessary to hold hi
seed and water up to him on the perch, as he would have starved befor
he ventured to descend the wire to the food dishes. He is perfect!;

e, and very amiable in disposition, having the little courtly
r merisms characteristic of male Palceornis Parrakeets that have
i 1 treated as pets. On the approach of a friend he keeps bowing and
king the perch with his beak, moves his lower mandible very
dly, and makes a little sound between a puff and a hiss. When
ted by the presence of visitors he utters very loud, harsh, and
lent calls which would render him intolerable inside a building,
ging from appearances, the nature of its habitat and the fact that
i a glorified edition of the Moustache Parrakeet, the Derbyan is
) rnbly an excessively hardy bird which it would be difficult to kill

l monkey nuts and apple, of which latter he is very fond. Like
t Parrakeets he greatly enjoys a rain bath.

THE BREEDING OF THE BIB FINCH AT LIBERTY
3ir, --Last May I obtained two or three pairs of this soberly-coloured
not unattractive little bird, and after training them to enter an
ry shelter through a little door a few inches in diameter, gave them
r liberty. They stayed and did well, and after some weeks my aviary
ndant reported that they had bred. On my return home in August,
ost the first small birds I saw in the garden were two young Bib
i ikes on the feeding tray, very well grown, and only differing from
r parents in the lack of bib.
1 have yet to winter them, but I do not anticipate great difficulty
his, and it would appear that the Bib Finch can be added to the
i of small, common birds whose presence at controlled liberty can
aade to add beauty and interest to a well-planted garden. In spite
; s diminutive size and quiet coloration the Bib Finch is by no means
nspicuous at liberty, as it is tame and not at all retiring in its
i its.

Sir, --Some time ago I bought lead wire for fastening labels on rc
and, unthinkingly, used this for fastening drinkers on cages.
I use the cages for isolating birds for a few weeks after receiving tl
from dealers.
All went well with ordinary hard bills, but latterly I have ta
up Lovebirds and Parrakeets.
About a month ago I got a pair of Masked Lovebirds from Chapin
and put them in one of these cages, and found, on the second morn
they had eaten the wire through and spilt their water.
I fastened the drinker up again with stronger steel wire, and thou
no more about it. On going to feed them the following day I found
cock completely paralysed in the legs, and so he still remains a
three weeks, although in other respects quite fit.
The same thing happened to a pair of Budgerigars before I foi
out my mistake ; one Budgerigar died after severe contortions.
Perhaps you may think it worth while publishing this as a warr
to fellow aviculturists, who may, like me, find soft wire very e
to use.
I have a young Black-cheeked Lovebird on its own, hate
16th June, and should like to know if this is the first breeding suc(
in Ireland.

Sir, --Just a line to say that I have had a hatch of the Mas]
Lovebird (Agapornis jpersonata). Doubtless other enthusiasts &lt;
report a success as early, if not earlier. The hen began to sit on 8th Ji
and was still on three eggs when I left home on 4th August, on
return to-day, 17th August, I found two young ones. Incubation in

Two other nests, which were started about the same date, app
to contain addled eggs. These young are covered with the oran
coloured down characteristic of the Lovebirds. It remains to be si
how long they remain in the nest, provided all goes well.

}ir,--T he first three lines of your most interesting article in last
th's Magazine recall my own experience ; my elder sister had a
, given to her when I was about 5 years old.
was 11 years old when I got my first Budgerigars, and that is
e years ago than I care to think about. You refer to percentage
lue young ; several of us tried this theory many years ago, with
ns and yellows, but the 25 per cent and 50 per cent did not turn
and I have tried it with blue and green since, without success.
)n the other hand, one member, Mr. Danys Weston, has proved it
ij -ork out with blues and greens. Now he used blues that had been
[ from blues for several generations, whereas I used blues bred
ii l blue-bred greens.
[ like a dark blue (not cobalt) better than a sky blue, and as I do
show, nor breed for the market, I seldom pair two blues together.
. think this proves that unless the blues are bred from blues and the
n blood bred out, they are not potent enough to prove this theory.
[ was the first to introduce a blue-bred strain, and I find that the
er the pedigree of the blue-breds, more blue young are produced ;
reeding it is not so much the colour of the birds, but pedigree that
i its. I have known young of other colours produced in an aviary
nly blue birds ; these would be the best of blue birds, of course ;
n producing a new colour, you would give consideration to the
ur of breeding stock, as well as pedigree. I think the olive was
I
luced by selection, so now we really have four shades of colours for
sing green, yellow, blue, and olive.
.t is a long time since I had any Pennants, or saw T any young ones,
! as far as I can remember, the nest feather is nearly all olive green,
enerations ago the Pennant must have been an olive-green bird,
we have olive Budgerigars and the mauve has a pink shade showing
he blue, so we are sure to get pink or red Budgerigars in time.
! ve already heard of two cases of birds that show a few pink feathers.

Mr. Allen Silver writes :--
" In peaceful Herefordshire, where no sound but the notes of b
and the rustle of leaves in a hay-scented breeze broke the stillnes
a beautiful afternoon, stands the small church of St. George, siti
in the parish of Brinsop.
" A little before 3 o'clock on the afternoon of 30th July, a
could be heard calling to those who were gathering together in men
of our much esteemed and friendly late member.
The almost mediaeval atmosphere of this little church with
sounds of ancient pipe organ and viols was most impressive, and
Right Reverend Dr. Trollope, in dedicating a window to the
Hubert Delaval Astley, alluded in his address to the great inte]
that was taken and the love that was shown by him for all thi
beautiful.
One has only to look through a series of volumes of our Magas
to know how true this was, and to many of us who knew him person;
his memory will be long cherished like the sunshine and breezes &lt;
beautiful summer afternoon."

Our worthy Editor informs me that there is to be a plate of the
wned Wood Partridge (Rollulus roulroul ) in the Magazine, and
t as I have been fortunate enough to breed this beautiful species,
; my duty to record my experiences with it. To those unacquainted
h the adult birds, the excellent plate accompanying these notes gives
&lt;h a life-like representation that further description is unnecessary.
The Roul-roul is the sole member of its genus which is characterized
the presence in both sexes of long hair-like bristles springing from
middle of the forehead. All the Wood Partridges, and there are two
er genera, have the claw of the first toe rudimentary.
The home of the Roul-roul is in '&apos;South Tenasserim, Malay
linsula, Sumatra, Java, and Borneo " (B.M. Catalogue), and I under-
id that it is upon the well-wooded hillsides at an elevation of from
X) to 4,000 feet, that it is usually to be found in " coveys " of from
to a dozen.

To the late Sir William Ingram belongs the credit of being the fii
to hatch the Koul-roul in captivity, and twenty years ago he was
far successful in that he reared a chick so hatched to the age
three weeks in one of his aviaries at Monte Carlo. A drawing of the chi
and an interesting account of the nesting habits of the bird appear
Avicultural Magazine, New Series, Vol. VI, p. 38.
I purchased my first pair of Roul-roul from Chapman in the la
summer of 1924. These were shortly afterwards turned out into
fairly large aviary thickly planted with shrubs and in which there w
a good deal of undercover.
The cock bird never seemed to thrive, and about six weeks aft&lt;
wards he was found dead under one of the bushes. The hen, on the oth
hand, appeared to improve and later came through a good moult. S
passed the winter in this aviary to which was attached a lofty shelb
without artificial heat. She frequently roosted in the open, and exce
in very severe weather the door of the shelter was never shut, whi!
the large window near the top of the shelter was continuously op
night and day.
I must here interpolate the remark that I do not recommend tl
spartan treatment for Roul-rouls, as this last winter during a prolong
spell of wet I found that the damp earth " balled " on their feet, ai
that both parents and chicks seemed happier and naturally mo
active when brought to a somewhat drier atmosphere where their fe
soon recovered from the chaps which were starting to form on the und(
side of their toes.
As a mate for the hen I purchased, in December, 1925, a cock bi
from Mr. Hebb, of Luton. The weather being bad and the time of t
year unfavourable, I kept this bird for some time shut in a roomy ca#
but eleven days after his arrival he had the misfortune to break a leg
this was on the 29th of the month. Having set the bone to the best
my ability, with a bandage soaked in white of egg, I kept him in the da
until 3rd January, 1926, when preferring to risk the weather rather th;
he should disturb the setting of his limb, I turned him out in the b
aviary with the hen. I have mentioned these details in order to she
that, whilst these birds probably prefer rather more warmth than i
average English winter brings, they are certainly not delicate.

On 3rd May the aviary attendant&apos;s notice was drawn to the cock
i standing under a laurel and near him a small mound of sticks
1 dried leaves towards the centre of the bush. This mound was shaped
" a tunnel, with a small entrance hole in the front ; upon closer
ervation the green body feathers of the hen bird were visible
hin. Later in the evening the aperture was completely sealed and the
k had gone to roost in the laurel above.
Some few days afterwards the hen was seen to be feeding, and a
it to the mound disclosed the fact that she was therein incubating
ee white eggs, almost round, with the shell having almost the same
ture and substance as the egg of the Guinea Fowl. The size of the
; is given by the late Mr. Astley as diameter L25 in., axis 1*55 in.
The hen proved a very close sitter, and this was the only occasion
on which she was found away from her nest. Every night she was
lied up inside and presumably she did this herself from within, but
s possible that the cock lent a hand as he was invariably on guard,
rein my experience differs from that of Sir William Ingram, who
md that his male bird kept " as far as possible from his partner&apos;s
ode ".
After three weeks the hen was gently driven from her nest, and the
*s were found to be unfertile and removed.
About this time I considered it advisable to take off the bandage
ich still adhered to the male bird's leg, and on 17th July the hen
ul-roul was reported missing. After a prolonged search--and I
uld here emphasize the marvellous way in which the domed nest
nds with the surrounding foliage--her whereabouts was discovered
the other side of the aviary, at the foot of an old disused feeding
dter, and seventeen days later the mother made her appearance with
ir tiny chocolate-coloured chicks. One of these was noticed to be
aker than its fellows, and was found dead later in the day. About
reek after this one of the remaining three chicks disappeared and was
ver found, the other tw T o reaching maturity and proving to be one of
:h sex.
Sir William Ingram gives the period of incubation as eighteen days,
d w r ith me the hen might have been sitting a day or tw T o before she v r as
)orted absent.

Did the hen Roul-roul acquire her comparatively bright pluma&lt;
(i.e. for the brooding sex amongst game birds) because she builds
domed nest for herself or does she build a domed nest because she hi
put on somewhat gaudy attire ? Perhaps those interested in " protects
coloration " will give their opinion. Doubtless she is " protective]
coloured " whilst moving about amongst the changing lights in heav
woodland, but presumably her vivid green tint would be conspicuoi
when at rest.
At a fortnight old the chicks were able to fly into the low busk
and roost with their parents. In their first plumage the young hire
had the body chocolate brown with speckled wings and a small cream
fawn spot on each tail feather. As the moult took place the sex&lt;
became discernible, and in three months or so they were almo:
indistinguishable from the old birds, except in size. The white ban
across the top of the head of the adult male bird took some time-i
manifesting itself in the chick of the sterner sex.
In the early months of this year, when I brought the family undt
cover for the reason stated above, the young male was if anything
finer bird than his father. Presumably four eggs would be the norm;
clutch for these birds.

For the third time in eighteen months a new species of Lovebird
s come to us, through the enterprise in each case of Mr. Chapman,
is species hails from Tanganyika, and was recently depicted in
our in the Magazine. But we find on comparison with the living
d that it is not green on the back of the head as painted, but the
ne bright orange colour as on the face and neck. It has a blue rump,
d is the same size as the Nyasa Lovebird, and not so highly coloured,
in our opinion so attractive. Probably it will breed equally freely,
d in this connexion it may be useful to mention the experiences
this year.
During the spell of dry, cold winds in April and May all Lovebird
gs, Nyasa and Black-cheeked, proved unfertile. They were thought
need a cool, damp atmosphere more like their rain-soaked native
unts.
Mr. Denys Weston devised a nest-box with a false bottom, below
lich is a drawer packed with sphagnum moss which can be moistened
necessary.
One of these boxes was given to one pair of Nyasas and an ordinary
idgerigar box to another pair. Large baths filled with long grass
d groundsel were placed in each aviary and damp moss also thrown
the floor. The result from both boxes was just the same, each
ir having reared a clutch of five young from as many eggs. The bath
ould be big enough to oblige the birds to get into it among the damp
j rbage, which is bitten off and taken into the boxes, and doubtless
pplies the necessary moisture. The Black-cheeks reared one young
ly out of four eggs, and this one unfortunately died after leaving
e nest.
Lovebirds are rather a problem in the winter : they do not do very
11 in cages ; if their aviary is quite cold they need sleeping boxes,
which case they insist on perpetually breeding, and if a paraffin lamp
; used, as in my case, to exclude frosts and provide a little comfort,
3 atmosphere probably becomes too dry.

Last winter, while visiting Mr. Lewis&apos; fine collection, I wasinteres:
to see three specimens of this lovely little bird, Psitteuteles eute
recently imported, and practically new to aviculture. Although 11
given up keeping Lorikeets some years before, as Mr. Lewis did i
want them himself, I was tempted to buy them. Unfortunately bef
I was able to take charge of them one of the cocks died. The p
I took home myself, not caring to leave such delicate treasures to 1
tender mercies of the railway company. They arrived in good condit
but further ill-luck was in store. I told my aviary attendant to g
them Lorikeets' food. He misunderstood me and gave them Hang
Parrots' food--mashed banana and sponge cake--which they woi
not touch. The result was that next morning I found them in a v&lt;
shaky condition and before the proper diet could be obtained i
cock collapsed quickly and died. The hen soon revived on Dr. Allinso
Food prepared as for infants and sweetened--the only diet on wh
1 have been able to persuade all Lorikeets to thrive and keep free fr
fits. On this, with the addition of a few sweet grapes, she has In
ever since.
After a considerable period of quarantine in the hospital the Lorik
was moved to the warm bird-room and thence, late in May, to a la
outdoor aviary with a heated shelter, of which latter she has irn
full use. When in the cage she was quite tame and almost inclined
be friendly, but after a summer in the aviary she has become Vi
wild. In her movements and behaviour she resembles the Trichogloss
Lorikeets, as also in her sharp cries, though being no larger thai
Tui these naturally have little power. Her general plumage is bri^
glossy green, somewhat paler on the breast. On each cheek there i
curious patch of yellow feathers interspersed with blackish ones ii

By H. L. Sich
Of the very few of the twenty-odd species of Turnix which I hii
been able to pick up nearly all have been hens.
As far as observation has gone they all appear to have simii
habits, which have been described before. I have never had mil
than three eggs in a clutch and sometimes only two, with paired bii
as well as odd hens, although I have heard of four chicks having bel
hatched and reared. It is impossible to say how many clutches are L j.
by one hen in a season in nature. My two species, both paired, til
year have laid one five clutches, the other four, and the latter is boomil;
again now.
Lepurana is, according to Ogilvie-Grant, a sub-species of sylvatl j.
differing only in being smaller, and having a more southern range !
Africa. But his description of the latter does not quite describe t
pattern of my lepurana.
I can see no difference in the two sexes except size, and that t|
breast of the hen is a little brighter yellow. The Upper parts a
mottled and streaked with two shades of brown. The throat, breast, ail
under parts are yellowish buff, a streak down the middle of thehea(|
the sides of the neck and sides of the breast are very nearly white
ground colour but each feather has a black centre, giving a sea!
appearance. The bill, which is rather long, is lead coloured, the to!
and tarsus yellowish white. The black of the eye is surrounded 1]
pale yellow, which gives the birds a very scared look.
Having got two tanli hens last year and failing to find a cock ana
vhere I offered another bird in exchange for a Turnix which I sawij
the Small Bird-house at the Zoological Gardens, and thought that !

been told that it was a cock. My offer was kindly accepted. Not
r after the bird was in my aviary it started booming, then I knew
r as a hen. Only then did I inquire its name and found it was
&lt;rana. I could see from the first that it was too different from my
to be a cock tanki, but it was better than nothing.
[n the autumn some more lepurana were advertised. The first lot
ck I bought were all dead in two days. I was just in time to save
cock of the second lot. A hen Chinese Painted Quail had taken a
ike to them, being, I suppose, too much like herself in colour,
hunted them round the shelter in which all the birds were shut
n for the winter.
Having caught up the remaining cock and the old hen for safety
ie had not been attacked, being there before the Quail had arrived--
ut them in a small run 7 by 4 feet in the shelter of the other
sion. By 11th April she had laid three eggs behind a board. These
amoved besides three more laid by 23rd April as there was no live
1 for the chicks, even if the cock had hatched them, and there was
j /here to put the hen if I had removed her. On 30th April they were
out into the flight. On 4th June I discovered that what appeared
)e a handful of hay tumbled out of a privet bush was the dome of
3 st: being placed in short grass it was more elaborate than usual,
,, looked much like a large nest of the Quail Finch. It contained
\0x25A0 eggs, a third being laid about midday and the cock began to
lbate soon after. The eggs are about 11 lines by 9 lines of a white
and heavily mottled with dark olive brown and much smaller
bches of pale brown and lavender grey.
By 7.30 a.m., 18th June, all three eggs w r ere hatched. Going in
eed some Quail chicks, the cock ran off the nest and the chicks tried
ollow. I collected them and put them back. When I went again
).30 the nest was empty and the egg-shells which were there before
11. gone ; the nest was never used again. Did the cock eat them to
er up all traces ? I never expected these eggs to hatch. The cock

ularly at about 6 p.m. for what seemed in my anxiety to be about
f an hour. Besides that about every quarter of an hour all day long

bath. I could see the nest a good way off from the outside of the avia
so his coming off was not due to fear of me. He sat more closely
last few days, which raised my hopes. What summer weather we h;
had this year was over by the middle of June. The three chicks w
still alive on the 19th, after a soaking wet and stormy night, but
the 22nd after a similar night there were only two left. I caught
the cock and these two and placed them in a small run in the pass
about 6 by 3 feet and had no more trouble, feeding them on 1
ants' eggs and gentles. I had to cover half the run over with rool
felt to keep them moderately dry ; that and the drenching weat
made observation rather difficult. I noticed that even when qi
young when the sun shone the chicks would sit together apart fr
the cock. At first they were dusky white with two darker stripes do
the back and the whole of the eye appeared black. At six days
the wing quills were visible. At about ten days old they began
pick up food off the ground. By 3rd July at fifteen days old the be
was covered with feathers and a little tail was showing ; the head t
still covered with down. On the 5th I first noticed that the irishadbeco
pale. On the 17th they were about two-thirds the size of the c&lt;
and coloured much the same but very much whiter looking and with
any yellow on the under parts. I put them in a run by themseh
inside, where they have been ever since. They are now, 1st Septeml
the size of the cock and coloured like him except the breast wb
only shows a tinge of yellow. As they are both the same size tl
are probably both the same sex and I expect cocks. Thehenhas.l
twice since, once in a small run where the cock refused to sit, and
the aviary where he hatched out on 16th August, but I could not fi
even the cock bird and in a week he appeared alone, so the wet a
scarcity of food, which I could only scatter broadcast, which the ot
birds ate, killed them. My other species, nigricollis, hatched out t
from two eggs early in May, but on an isolated wet day and onlyliv
a few hours. They have nested since but the eggs did not hatch. 1
young chicks were a few shades darker than lepurana but just t
same pattern and size.

To the Naturalist, whether he be ornithologist, botanist, orentomo-
st, no group of islands present a more fascinating and interesting
for his particular hobby than the Canary Island Archipelago,
various species peculiar to the islands, or in several cases to one
icular island, offer problems of surpassing interest, and added to
magnificent climate which one nearly always enjoys there renders
ay on any one of the islands one of peculiar enjoyment. I spent
greater part of February and March this year at Puerto Orotava
he coast of Tenerife, and no better centre could be found from which
vork the birds which are found on that island. Puerto Orotava is
ated on the west coast of Tenerife, the largest island of the group,
is reached by a drive through splendid scenery of 30 miles from
ta Cruz, the principal town and port of the island. The island of
erife roughly covers an area of over 900 square miles, and is 50 miles
r by 32 miles broad. A long Unbroken range of mountains running
ghly from Esperanza to Guia, forms, as it were, the backbone of
island, and culminates in the well-known peak, the Pico de Teide,
ch reaches a height of 12,180 feet. The sides of this long ridge of
intains are deeply cut by barrancos (ravines) which run down on
ier side, some of them of very large size. The entire surface of the
nd is composed of basaltic rocks, lava, cinders, and scorrise, though
i ;he fertile Laguna plateau there is a fine rich mould. Owing to the
intains there is a considerable amount of moisture which renders,
i island far less arid than some others of the group ; indeed, many of
barrancos are most luxuriant with brilliant almost tropical vegeta-
t, and it is only in the extreme south of the island where typical
ican desert conditions exist that sandy, stony tracts of desert
ntry are to be found, and it is on these desert-like plains that some
i he most interesting insular birds are to be found.
The extremely picturesque town of Orotava is situated 1,500 feet
ve the sea, overshadowed by the snow-capped Peak of Tenerife ;
Puerto, where I stayed, is 3 miles lower down, at sea-level. The
ntry all round is now largely devoted to the cultivation of the
1 iana, and a great deal of what was formerly good country for birds

has gone for ever. The banana plantations extend for miles all ro
Orotava, and stretch up to some 2,000 feet, where one gets into
region of the chestnut and laurel forests.
There has been in the past considerable differences of opinion amoi
scientists as to the origin of the Canarian Archipelago, and vari
theories have been put forward : (1) that they are merely of volcr
origin ; (2) that they were originally joined to the mainland of Afri

<listItem confidence="0.8760762">
(3) that they are the remaining peaks of the submerged fabled contin
of Atlantis ; but it is now, I think, generally agreed that they w
formed by volcanic action in the late Tertiary period. The Archipel
is made up of some twelve islands, forming an eastern group an
western group. The eastern islands are mainly composed of a

stony deserts and extinct volcanoes, with a very scanty vegetatit
the two large islands of the western group, viz., Gran Canaria #
Tenerife, are also purely of volcanic origin, but on them water is fai
abundant, and consequently vegetation is much more luxurio
The whole of the island of Tenerife can be divided up into very disti
zones of vegetation, which bear a marked influence on the distribut
of the birds. These zones may be differentiated as follows :--
(1) The Maritime Zone , which extends from sea-level to 1,000 fe
and includes the desert-like plains. This zone is characterized bj
semi-desert flora, where such arid-loving species as Opuntia and t
wonderful Tree Euphorbias flourish, and is the habitat of such interest
birds as the Courser and the Trumpeter Bullfinch.
(2) The Monte Verde or Zone of Cultivation, including the rema
of the chestnut and laurel forests, between 1,000 and 3,000 feet. Th
the vegetation, whether indigenous or introduced, is of the utm
luxuriance : vines, oranges, loquats, and bananas all thrive, and w
flowers of every description clothe the sides of the barrancos, while t
gardens of the villas and houses are more like outdoor conservator
than anything else, with an extreme wealth of magnificent plants a
shrubs ; the brilliant yellow and scarlet Bignonia venusta, red a
purple Bougainvilleas climb in profusion over roofs and balconi
flaunting crimson Hibiscus grow side by side with Daturas with th
enormous white trilmpet-like flowers, while the beautiful blue Thi
bergia grandiflora climbs over the dracaenas and palms, all making
a picture of surpassing loveliness. Special birds peculiar to this zo

} the Superb Redbreast, Spectacled Warbler, and till the destruction
the laurel forests, the wonderful Pigeon, Columba bollei.
(3) The Pine Forest Zone , 3,000-4,000 feet, and the habitat of one
the most remarkable of Tenerife birds, the Teydean Blue Chaffinch,
out which more will be said later on.
(4) The Cumbres , or high mountain zone, extending from 4,000 to
*00 feet; vegetation here is very poor, though the characteristic
nt Escobon ( Cytisus prolifer) grows freely. Large tracts of the more
by parts of the island (Zone 1) are given over to the Prickly Pear of

ich in the past was largely cultivated, is the food-plant of the
*hineal bug, which previously was bred by the inhabitants for the
;e of the well-known dye ; this industry was killed, however, in
s Canary Islands by the discovery of aniline dyes in 1878. However,
! ir as told that recently an effort has been made to restart the cochineal
lustry in Gran Canaria, principally because it is an industry which
M.uires very little heavy labour, and in consequence suits the tempera -
nt of the indolent Canarian peasants.
The larger Birds of Prey are very common in Tenerife : Buzzards and
d Kites may be seen at any time, and are remarkably tame, though
y do not haunt the vicinity of the towns in the way they did twenty
irs ago. The Egyptian Vulture is also an abundant species, but keeps
the more mountainous parts of the island. It is a fine sight to see
ee or four of these large Vultures wheeling over one's head, the black
I white plumage of the adults standing out finely against the brilliant
r
e sky. Occasionally I saw them being mobbed by Buzzards, which
their turn were mobbed by Ravens. The little Canarian Kestrel
nnunculus tinnunculus canariensis) , which is a resident sub-species,
3 extraordinarily abundant and breeding in the barrancos ; they
re absurdly tame, and would sit on a small tree, or on the top of a
II by the roadside, and hardly bother to fly away as one passed,
hink they feed almost entirely on the Lizards which swarm every -
ere. A few years ago the Osprey was a comparatively common bird,
! 1 lived in the cliffs quite close to Orotava ; I was disappointed not
3ee it at all.

By Capt. H. S. Stokes
Two years ago I related in these pages how a single Senegal Touraci
had surprised us by laying a clutch of eggs.
There followed the difficult search for a cock, rather like lookii
for a needle in a haystack, for Senegal Touracous are very few and f
between. However, through the kindness of friends we succeed
in getting a beauty, and the two birds were duly put together. T
hen went for him like a tigress, and they had to be separated. Tb
were kept in separate aviaries, but within sight of each other throu;
the winter, and on Whit-Monday, 1926, were put together, both in
fresh aviary. They at once began to feed and kiss and make charmi
crooning noises, and soon started a nest in some ivy outdoors, abo
5 ft. from the ground. A clutch of two eggs was laid and the bir !
sat steadily in June but the eggs proved to be clear.
We had been warned by the previous experience of Mr. Delaco
of the exuberance of the cock, who would certainly kill the first bro&lt;
of young, but we did not remove him as he regularly took his turn
the eggs by day, after the manner of pigeons, and being also rath
lame with rheumatism was not addicted to wife-beating. A secoi
clutch of eggs was laid on the same nest in August, 1926, and one e
hatched about 9th September.
On this date I went abroad, as I have learnt to do when any specia
precious birds are breeding. Letters from my aviary girl report
the good progress of the baby, Upon whom she lavished endless ca
and thought and trouble, and on my return on 10th October I w
shown the young with great and justifiable pride. It was not yet o&apos;
of the nest, about half grown, and about the size of a pigeon, a
covered with black down. It w T as about six o'clock in the eveni
and just getting dark, wffien pleased to be home and elated at the bii
into the world of another Senegal Touracou, I stood outside the avia
and talked to the mother, who is attached to me and will feed fre
my hand. She came to the wires for a grape, and the cock joined h
and both became very excited and began to crow. Alas, it was the dea

11 of the poor little one : in their excitement they left it that night
ts fate, and in the morning it was dead. I learnt my lesson, and
^ed never more to pet them.
This spring about April the hen showed signs of wishing to lay,
we made every effort to induce her to do so indoors. Boxes and
kets were put up, and heather and dead damson branches strewn
mt, but she would have none of them. Back she went to the old
t, and though the nest of last year had been demolished and we
l put fresh heather up for her, it was all pulled out and the nest
uilt entirely of branches broken off a small tree in the aviary by
h birds.
One egg only was laid, and after two days it disappeared. One more
5 then laid after a fortnight, and I caught the cock red-handed
ing it. Another egg was laid in July--observe that the clutch was
ariably only of one egg this year as against the normal two in 1926--
1 this time both birds sat splendidly. The hen would come off
ry morning about nine for breakfast and a bath, the cock taking
place till six in the evening. We were very careful to keep them
et and to make no fuss of them. Indeed, I again removed myself
m the temptation of meddling by going to London.
About the twenty-first day of incubation--I think the full period
j :wenty-four days--we began an extra feed of banana and bread
l milk. On my return home I was horrified to find both birds flying
)ut and my bird girl almost in tears. Fragments of egg, evidently a
ir one, had been found beneath the nest on the very day they
*uld have hatched.
For the second year, therefore, we are cheated of success and robbed
the great joy of rearing so beautiful and delightful a bird, so rare too
L
English aviaries.
No praise is too high for the Senegal TouracoU. It is steady and
i isible and most beautiful in its dress of green and purple, with carmine
11 in the wing. The sexes are by no means easy to distinguish apart,
t the cock is slimmer and longer than the hen, his green crest tipped
j :h purple, and a broader streak of white below the eye than she
ssesses.
These birds lay very large and almost round eggs, and on more than

one occasion the hen was so ill with the effort that she could scare
reach the nest to lay. However, she allowed herself to be placed on
and would feed from the hand on banana rolled in olive oil. She woi
also let my bird girl take the egg from beneath her to examine it. 1
have now stopped breeding operations for this year as the nights ;
getting cold. Next year if both birds are still with us we shall consi&lt;
removing the cock directly the eggs are laid, but I am by no met
certain how this will answer in the case of birds of which both se&amp;gt;
share the task of incubation.
Mr. Delacour was successful in breeding the species in Frai
before his aviaries were destroyed in the war, but it has not been bi
in England, no doubt owing to the great difficulty of obtaining pairs.

Mr. Webb returned home from Costa Rica on 21st August, witl
number of Humming Birds, which he had collected for Mr. Sped
Lewis. Mr. Lewis most generously presented seventeen of these to t
Zoological Society, and as they required special lighting and heati
arrangements, special cages were arranged for them in the Insect Hou
There are at least five different species, namely Phaethornis longirostr
Cam&apos;ptjlo&apos;pterus hemileucurus, Thalurania colombica, Amazilia dubasi, a
Elvira chionura.
Humming Birds will live for a time upon syrup only, but a certa
quantity of insect food would seem to be necessary for most spec
at any rate. There is a very small white fly which is extremely numero
on the underside of the leaves of some marrow plants in my garde
It is a regular blight, and appears to be responsible for a very po
crop of vegetable marrows. But the Humming Birds love these tii
insects which they capture on the wing in a very dexterous manner.
A pair of very beautiful Conures arrived in a recent collection ma"
by Mr. Chapman's representative in Central Brazil, and were purchas*
by the Zoological Society. They belong to the species known s

many respects resembles that species, but its chief distinguishing

Mr. Frost has returned to England after an absence of three years,
i has brought with him a very fine collection, including several birds

embles the Black Lory, but is clothed in delicate shades of purple,
mze, and red. Rosenberg's Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus rosenbergi) is
3 of the most beautiful of its genus. The Javan Kingfisher ( Halcyon
miventris), the New Guinea Kingfisher ( Sauromarptis gaudichaudi),
d the very interesting Malayan Falconet ( Microhierax fringillarius )
appear to be the first of their kinds to be imported.
The collection includes thirty-three Birds of Paradise, belonging
six species, no less than nine Great Black Cockatoos ( Microglossus ),

The question is often asked as to what is the best method of catching
&apos;ds from an aviary. For my own part I dislike nets in any shape or
m, though they are necessary in certain cases. A catching cage of
ne form is much to be preferred. The birds are fed into this, and a
or is operated with a string. A combined feeding tray and cage can
i devised so that it is always available for catching any bird when it
&amp;gt; dts the food-tray. This would be a rather large cage with a large
or at either end, which would be left open normally, but when a bird
! s wanted, one door would be shut and the other worked with a string.

Those who are interested in the breeding of Canary mules a
hybrids between the various species of British Finches, will be glad
possess the new edition of Mr. Houlton's book edited by Mr. C. A. Hon
both author and editor being experts in hybrid breeding.
While the breeding of Canary mules does not quite come within 1
scope of our journal, we may well consider the production of hybr
between two British species, such as the author deals with. Some
these are extremely beautiful, as well as interesting, and the list
those that have been produced is quite a formidable one, the mi
remarkable being perhaps that between the Chaffinch and Brand)
finch. Many have claimed to have crossed the Canary with the Chaffin
or with the Yellow-hammer, but no bona fide specimen of either
these has been produced.

Sir, --About the middle of July my Orange Weaver had complet
a nest suspended to the outside twigs of a holly bush. I thought
worth photographing. As the entrance faced the interior I was goi
to remove a bundle of hay, of which the nest was entirely made, fr(
the middle of the bush, when the hen flew out. On 18th August I &amp;
the hen hunting round for insects, so I wrote for some mealworn
In the meantime I beat the garden bushes for insects which were ve
few and mostly plant bugs. One young bird left the nest on 23rd Augu
It was well feathered, but had no tail, and seemed quite bare under t
throat, otherwise it was a paler edition of the hen and showed a slig
yellowish streak above the eye.
Now, 1st September, it is darker than it was and has a tail; it
still being fed by the hen. What the hen found to feed the nestli
on in the earlier stages among a host of other birds puzzles me. Nc
the cock has entirely picked the nest to pieces, which felt quite cle;
inside when the bird had flown. H. L. Sich.

Sir,-- Observations on the food of a species when wild are sometimes
; value to aviculturists because, as remarked by E. Gr. B. Meade-
/aldo, F.Z.S., of Kent, " The sciences of ornithology and aviculture
&apos;e intimately connected. Each has much to learn from the other
tvic. Mag. Yol. 1921, p. 34, beginning of article). Therefore
may be of use to some member to state that on 5th August a bird was
roughtto me (which had been accidentally shot in mistake for a common
lecies) and which I recognized as a Crossbill, evidently a this year s
ird, breast with dark streaks ; and on going round to the land where
le bird was seen I found four Crossbills feeding on the leading-shoots
f fruit-trees, plum and apple (while the peculiar voices of two others,
resumably parents, were heard quite close).
Up to that morning I thought the food of Crossbills consisted only
f vegetarian matter such as seeds of various fir-trees, mountain ash,
lder, hawthorn, etc., but these four birds were obviously clearing off
i nd eating greenfly from the leaves of the fruit-trees, and during the

1 hoots of young trees, holding the head sideways, almost flat, against

they climbed Parrot-like all up one twig after another ! There \
no sign of them interfering with the fruit, plums or apples. All w

sing incessantly, one against the other, with lowered wings, showing
f the beautiful golden yellow of the wing feathers.
I tried in vain to secure hens of their own race for that season (1926),

Sir, I think perhaps the following incident might possibly
interesting to aviculturists with regard to the hardiness of the beautif
Masked Lovebird (A. per sonata ). I recently bought a pair of the
fascinating Lovebirds from Miss Chapman, of Birmingham. I did n
think they were sufficiently acclimatized to put outside altogethf
as the weather just then was anything but good ! However, I wante
to put them in an outdoor aviary as soon as possible for breedii
purposes, hoping to get them to go to nest before too late this yea
I decided, therefore, in order to accustom them to our changeab
climate to put them out in the garden for a little each day, just as th(
were, in the wire cage in which I bought them. After a few days, as tl
weather seemed suitable, I decided to harden them off a little mo:
by leaving them out until after dinner. This particular evening aboi
8.30 p.m. I went out to fetch my birds in, when to my horror an ope
door and an empty cage greeted me ! They had somehow manage
to open the door with their beaks ! A pair of Black-cheeked Lovebirc
of mine did this in the early spring but fortunately in that case escape
into a room. This door, however, seemed too secure for it to be possibl
heeling utterly helpless and scarcely daring to breathe even, I calle
to them. As they already seemed to know me a little, I hoped by thi
means to keep them in the garden for the moment! The smaller on
answered at once from a tree just over the cage. He was perching o
a coconut husk, which I had hung up for wild birds to nest in, and wa
apparently studying the accommodation therein ! However, th
next minute the larger one called from the very top of a fir-tree clos
by, and the smaller one flew to it immediately, while I stood wit!
bated breath waiting for their next move. Needless to say they had .
perfectly glorious time flying from tree to tree, and to my joy alway
within sight! One bird flew once to the very tip of a poplar-tree quit

lUndred yards away from the cage, and I never thought to see it
ck again. However, he returned, and so on, until too dark to watch
y more. Eventually they both went to roost in the fir-tree close to
eir cage--which I had not moved, of course--and there I had to leave
em for the night. I think, of the three, I spent the most miserable
e ! We have a great many owls here, and I felt sure they would
ver survive for this reason, even if they managed to stand the cold
d dampness of the night air. The next morning I was awake at
30 a.m. ! From then onwards I watched from a window overlooking
e garden for any sign of my Lovebirds. I did not see or hear either
them until about 7.30, although the wild birds had been awake for
long time. My birds did not believe in rising too early apparently !
iddenly the smaller one flew down from the fir-tree on to the top
their cage, and struggled unsuccessfully for several minutes to pull
millet spray through the bars. At last giving up the struggle he
tually went inside the cage, and so was soon captured. The other
le followed suit soon afterwards, much to my joy. Neither of them
1 ire any the worse for their adventure in spite of a very thick mist
the early morning and a very cold night. This, I think, proves
at the Masked Lovebird is not at any rate delicate, also that they
ow a certain amount of intelligence, and would, I believe, become very
me. They fly very swiftly, and are a truly beautiful sight to watch,
it, even so, I hope never to see mine at large again ! All the same,
does make one feel rather sad, of course, to see them shut up, after

that it has so far proved to be the most useful. In the same w
the Mauve, which is probably, as yoil say in your article, " less striking
than the Cobalt (although many prefer it to all others), may prove a]
to be of immense value. As yet this colour is hardly a true " mauve
It should contain more pink in its composition. Improvement, howev*
is being made all the time, and already birds bred this season frc
crosses with the Mauves which Mr. Roland Green painted for o

breeders to go still further in this direction and produce a pure Pic
This I believe to be quite possible, but it will be some time before it
attained, although many secretive and admittedly speculative cross
are being tried !
One variety that I hope soon to establish is the Silver-Grey. Sor
crosses produce a beautiful French grey colour, but only those wi
grey face-spots are likely to moult out true Greys, those having dark
spots moulting into light Mauves.
Apart from their attractiveness, two most valuable varieties won
be the Cinnamon and the Brown or Bronze. From experiments alreac
being made these are apparently well on the way. Their value I
colour crossing would, of course, be inestimable.

Sir, --It is unusual for young Parrakeets, as distinct from Lorikeets,
iUres, etc., to re-enter the nest once they have flown. It is somewhat
ious therefore that this year a young Barraband and also a young
labar Parrakeet did so for some days. The Barraband was a single

l sisters of former years have ever gone back to their nest after leaving

Gance of the remarkable amount of variation in individual conduct

Sir, Reading through the back volumes of the Avicultur

" On going to press we have received from Mr. George Carrick
cutting from the Glasgow Evening News of 27th April relating to t
sale of Bostock's Menagerie. The most extraordinary bidding took pla
when The Australian Gin-Gin bird, a small bird of the Parrot kin*

knocked down for 260 guineas. This bird was said to whistle ma]
tunes. Can any member enlighten us as to the proper name of ti
k Gin-Gin ' bird ? " (Avicultural Magazine, 1909, p. 214).
Apparently no member could, as the query remained unanswere
Can any reader solve the problem now ?
The only name I can trace with any semblance to " Gin-Gin "
an obsolete name used by Latham for the Cingalese Alexandrii
Parrakeet ( Palceornis eupatria), namely, Gingi Parrot.
Whatever the bird, it fetched an exorbitant price.

each have their own sub-species, P. c. ombriosa and P. c. palmem
while on the two large islands of the Eastern Group P. c. degene
found, and it is extraordinarily interesting to note that these ra
show special colouring in their plumage according to the conditi
in which they live. For instance, P. c. palmensis, which lives i;
verdant mountainous island, is much more richly coloured than
pale forms, P. c. degener inhabiting the dry arid islands of Lanzar
and Fuerteventura. All these forms are races of the European B
Titmouse (P. e. cceruleus). Another common bird, though a v
interesting one, which was generally to be seen in the&apos; barrancos ^
the Spectacled Warbler ( Sylvia conspicillata bella). The cocks are beai
ful in their breeding plumage, but they were very shy, and would quic
dive into the thick foliage if they thought they were being observ
On 19th March a pair were watched carrying food in their bea
but owing to the extremely precipitous nature of the ground it t
impossible to search for any nest; when frightened this bird Utter
very peculiar chattering cry. On more open ground Berthelot's Pip
occurred frequently all round Orotava ; they were also breeding a
were very confiding and tame. Here, too, the Rufescent Short-tc
Lark was found, often in company with the Pipits. One of 1
commonest birds at Orotava was the Hoopoe : they were to be s(
everywhere, and two pairs were feeding young in the Martial
Barranco just outside the hotel. In the Laurel Forest Zone at ab(
2,000 feet, one finds quite a different lot of birds, amongst the m&lt;
interesting the Superb Redbreast ( Erithacus rubecula superbus) v
common, splendid large dark brown birds, with brilliant ruby-coloui
breasts; while flocks of Brehm's Pale Swift ( Micropus murir
brehmorum) flew screaming up the barrancos. Another species, viz. t
small Black Swift ( Micropus u. unicolor), was also seen, but as a ruletl
seemed to be commoner nearer the coast.
A long expedition was made on 19th March to a reputed locali
for the Teydean Blue Chaffinch in the Pine Forest Zone above a villa
called La Sorriba. After an hour&apos;s drive in a motor, which was enliven
by the great quantities of Neophrons, Kites, and Buzzards which wt
continually in view, we found mules waiting for us at La Sorril

ack, with splendid scenery all round. After an hour's arduous climb
ie became aware that the character of the country was changing,
id single pine-trees began to appear, and very soon we had reached
e forest itself. After the very gloomy accounts we had heard of the
sstruction of the pines by local woodcutters, we were agreeably
rprised to find that here, at any rate, were many miles of quite
ispoilt forest, indeed the " Pinar " stretched as far as the eye could
e in all directions. We were not lucky enough to see the " Azule ",
e local name for the Blue Chaffinch, which has probably of recent
&amp;gt;ars become very much rarer in Tenerife than it was in 1893 when
r. Meade-Waldo wrote " it appears to hold its own in all the pine
rests of Tenerife " ; indeed, he was able to bring a pair home, which
ed in his aviaries, and Mr. Ezra had a specimen, I believe, a few years
ter. All the natives know of the existence of the " Azule ", and have
1 entirely inflated idea of its value, and although I offered a good
*ice if a pair of live ones were obtained for me, I never received any.
ae natives are rather fond of keeping birds alive in cages, and one
ten sees the fine local form of Koenig's Partridge looking remarkably
ell in a tiny cage in which it can hardly turn round ! In some of the
itios in the Spanish houses were small aviaries containing Canaries
hey prefer the domestic breed to the much more interesting local
ild Canary), Goldfinches and, in several instances Blackcaps, the
tter in each case looking the picture of health and in the finest
ndition. In the Botanical Gardens at Orotava was a large outdoor
 |&apos;iary containing, amongst a number of common foreign Finches,
m good Black-breasted Sandgrouse (Bier odes orientalis), two or three
&apos;ecimens of the Least Goldfinch (Carduelis c. parva), some Madeiran
ock Sparrows, a single Thanner's Bunting (Emberiza calandra
inneri ), and a remarkably tame Red-billed Chough, which followed the
rdener about everywhere. On 25th March an expedition was made
the Charco of Maspalomas in the extreme south of Gran Canaria,
id a most interesting day was spent in this very remarkable locality,
saving Las Palmas in the early morning by motor-car, the road for
e first 10 miles or so was fairly good, but after passing a place called
dde, it very soon degenerated into the merest track, and at times
1 ased to exist altogether. Large birds of prey were almost continually

would fly up from the side of the road as we passed ; soon after passi
Telde one gets into practically desert country, arid stony plains, a
miles of bare sandy ground, which have a certain fascination of th
own, added to by the wonderful desert flora one passes. The groi
of huge Candelabra Euphorbia ( Euphorbia canariensis) which i

E. balsamifera, which here grows over 6 ft. high, the miniature Dragc
tree ( Kleinia neriifolia ) growing out of the sand, and as a contn
the bright green pendulous foliage of Plocama pendula, all make
a fascinating picture, which was accentuated by the interest of the bii
we saw, species peculiar to this district; the fine Koenig's Shri
(Lanius excubitor koenigii) becoming quite common, and looking ve
conspicuous as they sat on the topmost shoot of an Opunta, watch
us intently as we passed. I have no doubt they were breeding, b
we had not time to stop and look for their nests, as I was anxio
to get to the Charco itself, another 30 miles further on. This reas
also prevented me searching for the Eastern Canarian Thick-kn
(CEdicnemus o. insularum), which is found not uncommonly on th(
plains, and the Trumpeter Bullfinch had to be missed too, though
expected to find the species at the Charco. A collision between o
motor and a bullock-cart also caused a long delay, the terrific argumei
between the drivers of each vehicle as to who was in the wrong neai

It was in May of this year that a pair of these birds came into
y possession, through the kindness of one of oUr new members,
r. Geoffrey Davies, I.C.S., who had just returned on leave from
dia. These birds had reared four young before they left their native
untry, and had started laying again towards the end of their journey
England.
Both birds were most delightful pets, far tamer than any Barndoor
)wl--they had, I believe, been captured when quite young, and
ire therefore thoroughly domesticated and much attached to their
 |lall home, which was one of the familiar double-domed Indian bamboo
 |ges with a compartment for each bird--it was in these restricted
larters that the first brood was reared in India--but the birds being
i tame, it was possible to open the doors and let them out to forage
r food, have their dust-bath, etc., and it was only necessary to
*proach them with the cage, when they would step inside with
&apos;.emplary obedience.

Maurice Amsler--Breeding of the Greg Francolin
When the Partridges came to me on 19th May, the hen had laid fou
eggs of a creamy white colour, milch the size of that of our ow
Partridge.
On arrival I placed their cage with the doors opened in a sma
covered run about 4 feet square. This enclosure was in the shelte
of one of my aviaries, and it was possible to let the birds out int
the aviary or confine them to the run, at pleasure.
I constructed a nest of turf and hay in one corner and placed th
four eggs therein. By 26th May nine eggs had been laid, and the hen
began to sit in earnest on the 27th. I reckoned that they should hatclj
about 20th June, but on several occasions I found one or more ego
thrown out of the nest. Sometimes they seemed almost cold to th"
touch, but I always replaced them as soon as discovered.
On 19th June to my dismay I found that the hen had given uj
sitting. The eggs which looked fertile were stone cold. It was the worl
of a few moments to take the eggs indoors and place them in hot water
After a very few minutes of this treatment some of them began tcj
"wabble " and show signs of life, and not long after several of thi
chicks could be heard " cheeping " inside the eggs.
Having no broody hen at the moment and no incubator, the eggf
were placed in a box on the top of my hot water cistern for the night--
the temperature here was only 100*--and I had grave fears that al
the chicks would be dead by the next day when I was able to place;
them in an incubator belonging to a man of my acquaintance. Within
a few hours six of the nine eggs hatched, and the chicks at first looked
quite normal, though perhaps a little less active than do most Game-
birds wh^n they first leave the egg. I gave them ants' eggs, green fly,
and Armitage's No. 1 chick food, but on the evening of the third day
three had died, and although the remaining three were put in a brooder
and carefully fed I lost the last one on 1st July at the age of ten days.
On the same date the old hen began to lay again. She chose a corner
of the run immediately behind her bamboo cage, laying the eggs on
the hard concrete. In this place I again made a nest for her, and she
repeated her previous clutch of nine eggs.
Incubation began on 10th July, and the eggs hatched on the 31st.
All the eggs were fertile, but one chick died in the shell.

Maurice Amsler--Breeding of the Grey Francolin 291
During the last three days of the incubation I noticed that both
'ds sat side by side and brooded the eggs, this certainly did not
ppen on the first occasion. The cock continued his care and attention
the chicks after they had hatched ; in fact I think he was, if
ything, the better parent.
This second hatch proved to be much more vigorous than the
st, no doubt because the chicks got the correct amount of warmth
d protection from their parents, and also because they were shown
iat to eat and what to leave. Their diet consisted at first almost
tirely of live ants' eggs. No water was given for thirty-six hours, after
lich I gave them a few weeds pulled up in the garden, which were
vered with rain drops. It was most interesting to note how quickly
ey realized that this was meant for a drink. First the drops of water
;re swallowed, and next the tips of the small blades of grass were
lied off and swallowed. On 3rd August I removed the whole family
a small movable run which I had prepared. This was placed on the
vn and moved a yard or so each day. At night parents and chicks
;re driven into a closed box attached to the run, where they were
fe from cold, rain, and rats. Within a very few days I had to move
e run on to a piece of rough grass at the bottom of my garden as
e parents dug large holes 6 inches or more deep in their search for
&amp;gt;rms and insects.
When it was raining, or on those rare occasions when the sun shone
tly, each parent would take charge of four chicks and protect them
)m the weather. The cock, hitherto very friendly and docile, made no
nes in trying to spur anyone who dared put his hand into the run.
As the young grew the diet was increased and varied a good deal,
its' eggs were always welcome and cleaned up at once, but as they
;re also required for other birds, I found that gentles were equally
ceptable. A small amount of insectile mixture was eaten dry, also
imbled sponge cake and Indian millet. At ten days the chicks would
vour any amount of earth worms--even quite large ones, if broken
&apos;\0x25A0:o pieces an inch long, were eagerly fought for and gulped down,
eel quite certain that fresh grass must form a very large part of the
J 3 t of these birds, both young and old ; for each day when the run was

All seemed to be going well, for the youngsters grew apace, and \
their feathers well developed at two weeks, when I had to cut
wing in case of their escaping. I then noticed that one of the chi
whom I had suspected of some slight deformity, had four legs inst
of two, the two supernumerary legs were ligatured and snipped
and the young bird at once began to eat and seemed none the wo!
At three weeks the young birds were the size of Chinese Pain
Quail; they had lost the longitudinal striations, which I believ;
common to Game chicks, and could fly strongly notwithstanding i
trimming of one wing.
About this time I began to think they did not look quite so ti
in feather as they should, and a few days later one died, and sev"!i
others looked ill. I came to the conclusion that they were suffei
from absence of sunshine and the effects of the constant rain. Soli
30th August I replaced the seven chicks and their parents in tlj.
original aviary, but did not confine them to the little run when
chicks were hatched. The result of this was that the birds spent n
of their time in the soaking grass of the outer flight, and I lost twoin^
young Partridges.
Having learned my lesson, and being left with only five chicks,
family were once more placed in the closed run, and all has gone P
since then.
To-day, 21st September, at about eight weeks, the young Partriai
are about half-grown. They are much like the hen in colouration, ;j
I should say are perfectly independent, but the moment the partj
hear me or my man walking in the aviary they begin to peck lou ;
at the walls of their run, which means that they want some gen
or worms, and when these are forthcoming not one do they ton
all are left for the young and growing family.
I think there are three males and two females among the yon
birds; of this it will be easy to make certain in a month or two, as 1
males have well-developed spurs when adult.
This species, like the more familiar " Black Partridge ", is m i
prized in India for fighting purposes, and I believe that good fight!
males realize quite high prices.

The term " Goose " is applied to several orders of web-footed birds,
, speaking generally, large birds with varying characteristics recalling
pse of certain Ducks, and as a matter of fact there are many birds
own as Geese or Ducks which by rights belong to the same sub-
nilies, and in many cases these so-called " Geese " and " Ducks "
:erbreed freely (e.g. Egyptian Geese and Sheldrakes). As a rule Geese
ve thicker feet and not such flat bills as have Swans and Ducks, and
ey are not so aquatic. Some indeed do not like to go into water. Their
,^d mostly consists of grass, which, with the addition of grain, is their
ual diet in confinement. Most kinds of Geese are hardy and long-lived,
number of pairs of different kinds can be kept together in a park or

e Spurwings and Egyptian Geese are, however, very quarrelsome
spring and must be isolated in pairs in large enclosures well furn-
hed with grass and water. Geese are monogamous, and pair for life ;

ieir young. They do not breed until they are three years old at the
uliest, and if they are older than this it is all to the good.
The true Geese, genus Anser, are migratory birds which nest in the
retie or temperate zones and go South for the winter. They are hardy

The Short-billed Goose {A. brachyrhynchus) resembles the li
named, but is smaller, has a shorter bill and rosy feet.
The White-Fronted Goose (A. albifrons ) is smaller and mr
elegant in shape. It may be recognized by its white forehead a
the very dark deep brown spots on its breast.
The Dwarf Goose (A. erythropus) is the preceding in miniatu
with slightly darker plumage ; it is the prettiest bird of the whe
genus.
The Bar-headed Goose (A. indicus ) nests in Thibet and winte
in India ; it may be known from all its relatives by its pretty pea
grey plumage picked out with darker grey and white, and by the tv
black stripes across the nape of the neck and the yellow bill and fee
It is often imported but is usually susceptible to cold and not vei
prolific ; it has, however, bred freely at Kew Gardens. If it is n&lt;
pinioned it is apt to wander away, but it has not been found to do J
at Kew.
The Emperor Goose ( Anser canagica) from North-east Asia an
North-west America is very rare and has only been bred in captivit
of late years. It is very handsome, bluish-grey, every feather edge
black and white. The sides of the neck and crown of the head ar
yellowish white, the feet are yellow, and the beak rosy grey. It i
easily bred in confinement and is very gentle. It requires good pasture
maize best not be given, being too fattening and likely to bring oi
apoplexy. The sexes are alike in plumage but not in size. This specie
cannot stand heat and requires fresh running w r ater.
The Chinese Goose {Anser cygnoides ) from North Asia is representec
m many farmyards by a domesticated variety from which it iff
distinguished only by its more slender figure. The wild species is prac |
tically unknown in confinement. The male is the larger and has alscf
a large knob above its bill.
The Snow Geese are like the preceding but have rose-coloured
bills and feet. They are white or sometimes of a light bluish-grey colour.
They are inhabitants of North America and Eastern Asia and
are accidental visitors to Europe.

years old, but does not go to nest readily and takes a
&apos;time to make up its mind. Unpinioned birds will usually stay,
arger species (A. nivalis ) has been imported, a native of
tern North America. The Blue Snow Goose (A. coerulescens) is
etimes considered to be a mere variety of the white ; and
h the two interbreed their young may be either blue or white,
the blues will be whiter underneath. This Goose is grey-blue with
i grey markings, and with partly white wings, head, neck and
omen. It is met with in North America, east of the Rocky
mtains.
Ross' Goose (A. rossi) is much smaller and more elegant; it is all
,te except for the black flights. It breeds freely in captivity,
s quite one of the prettiest Geese and is a native of North-west
erica.
The Geese of the genus Branta are like the preceding species in
position, but are more marine ; they have smaller bills, and
?er, thinner necks. The sexes can only be distinguished by their size.
The Bernicle Goose (Branta leucopsis) is one of the prettiest
opean species, having its plumage heavily marked with black, white
grey. It thrives and breeds freely in confinement. If the young
left unpinioned they stay fairly well where they were born.
The Brent Goose (B. bernicla) is exclusively marine. It lives well
onfinement where it can have grass, but soon dies if fed on grain
le. To our knowledge it has not yet been bred in confinement,
s smaller, darker, and duller coloured than the preceding species.
The Red-breasted Goose (B. rujicollis ) from Siberia has unusual
'kings. It is the handsomest of the genus. Black, with the sides
;he neck and the breast bright rust coloured edged with white ;
as also white about the head and under the body and wings. It is
y scarce ; does well in confinement, and has been bred at Woburn.
The Canada Goose (B. canadensis) is the largest of the wild
se ; it is a fine striking bird, in colour brown mixed with fawn, and
h a black head and neck. A white streak from one cheek to the
er passes under its bill. It is a native of North America, breeds freely
onfinement, and need not be pinioned. Its voice is one of its charms,

account to leave it full winged. The male bird becomes quarrelsc
m the nesting season and may injure other Geese or even small Swa
but it does not attack Ducks. Once the young are hatched the gan
abandons his warlike demeanour and with his family seeks the comp*
of his kind, thereby refuting the theory of certain naturalists t
the fierceness of breeding male birds is a provision of nature to ens
sufficient space wherein to find food for the young.
Hutchin's Goose (B . hutchinsi ) inhabits the same neo-Arctic regi.
and resembles the preceding but is only half as large. It is rar
met with in confinement. Another occasionally imported species wh
resembles the first but is even smaller is B. minima from West*
America. They do well in confinement but, unlike their larger relativ
are shy breeders.
The Sandwich Island Goose (Nesochen sandvicensis) is alm&lt;
extinct in a wild state. It is a very fine bird and has very pleasi
habits. Its colouring is brown variegated with grey and its ne
feathers are barred with light fawn ; its head, a stripe behind the ne&lt;
beak and feet are black. This species bred freely in the Bond
Zoological Gardens many years ago and has been kept by Herr F.
Blaauw at Gooilust for the last thirty years. It is easily bred, b
in spite of this is not easy to manage, one reason being that the eg
are laid very early in the year, the end of February or the beginni
of March, that is long before fine weather can be looked for. Cons
quently they often fail to hatch or the young die from cold nights ai
changes of temperature. Another reason is the spitefulness of t
males , sometimes a gander has lived peacefully for years with i
mate, and then suddenly will attack and kill her, and one has c
always the luck to intervene in time. Some males are so ill-temper*
that they cannot ever safely be left with a female and always ne&lt;
watching. The young are easily reared and thrive best when they a
left to their parents. They are susceptible to cold, particularly if
comes suddenly after a long period of warmth, and it is wise to brii
them into shelter at night during early summer.

ed and walk well ; they have very small bills. The genus
ains six species ; in three of these the sexes are alike, and
three they differ, but both are pretty. Those in which
sexes are unlike are the Magellan Goose (Chloephaga magellanica )
i Patagonia and the Falkland Isles, which is kept throughout
ope, where it breeds freely and does well. The sexes are altogether
ke each other, the male being white, striped on the sides with
k, with a grey back. His wings are grey with black and white
its and a large reddish-brown speculum, his tail is black as are also
jill and feet. The female is russet where the male is white, her wings
like his but her feet are yellow. The male whistles, but the female
a loud call resembling the word " purr-roor ". The sex of young
Is can easily be distinguished as soon as they get their feathers,
ough at that time the males have grey heads instead of white ones.
In the breeding season these Geese are very vicious towards their
ipanions, particularly if these happen to be Sheldrakes. They
be allowed full power of flight. The nearly related species
s inornata) is frequently imported, in this the male has the breast as
as the sides barred. The females are identical. They are natives
/hili and the Argentine.
The Ruddy-headed Goose (G. rubidiceps) is much smaller. The
! is are alike and resemble the hen Magellan, only with redder
ds and greyer bodies and more delicate markings. Their voices
sr like those of the foregoing species. This is a far rarer and more
cate species than those already mentioned. It requires very pure
er with fresh grass. It is peculiar to the Falkland Isles.
The Ashy-headed Goose (C . poliocephala) is another pretty little
I&apos;cies and is very rare. Needs similar treatment to the preceding
and like it breeds freely. Both sexes have ashy-grey heads,
: logany backs and breasts, white abdomens, and black and white
[ped sides ; bills and tails the same colour as the Ruddy-headed ;
; lge yellow feet spotted with black. It is found in Patagonia,

sides ; her abdomen, rump and tail are white ; she sports a wl
and green speculum ; has a flesh-coloured bill and yellow feet. T
handsome species is met with in the Straits of Magellan, Tierra
Fuego, and the Falkland Islands. Unlike its fellows, the Kelp Go
does badly in confinement, which is accounted for by its habits
its own country. There, where the species is fairly plentiful it is alwi
found among rocks by the seashore. It does not go inland to f (
like other geese, but lives exclusively on a kind of algse called " lutsch
by the natives, and doubtless also on small marine creatures. We 01
brought a Gander back, but in spite of every care he only lived fo
few months at Gooilust; although he fed freely on all Sorts of thii
they did him no good ; he " went light " and finally died. We brou&lt;
with us a bag of dried lutsche " bought at Santiago, where it is s&lt;
for human food, but it became exhausted, and could not be obtain
in Europe.
Apart from this individual we only know of two other importation
one in 1868 to the London Zoo, and one more recently to Berlin : I
neither bird lived for any length of time. Both male and female are ve
handsome, and it would be interesting to make another attempt
acclimatizing them.
The Andean Goose (0. melanoptera) is rare in confinement b
has been bred in the London Zoological Gardens. It chiefly inhab
mountainous parts of south-west South America. The sexes are all
but the male is much the larger. It is a big white bird and its greeni
black wings have a purplish speculum; its tail is black, &apos;i
shoulders light brown with darker spots, beak and feet are red.
This species does not mind the cold, but is subject to vario
diseases. It is easily tamed, but the Ganders are apt to turn spitefi
pursuing their keepers, and puffing themselves out with curioi
whistling noises. They appear to dislike the water.
The Blue-winged Goose ( Cyanochen cyanopterus ) from North-ea
Africa has only twice been imported, but there are now sever

i very curious attitude, its head lying on its back and the chest
anced: It has been bred by Herr Blaauw. Gander and Goose are
:e in their plumage, but she is the smaller and has a different call.
The Maned Goose ( Chenonetta jubata) from Australia has
ch the appearance and size of a Carolina Duck. It is one of our
ttiest species, the male bird's plumage is silvery grey and black
h deep chestnut head and back ; the feathers at the back of the neck
long and form a kind of mane. The female is light brown with grey
ks. Both sexes have very distinctive plumage and the effect is
ghtful. This species is pleasing both in character and habits ; it is
y hardy and needs pure water and fresh grass. It breeds very
gularly and doubtless it would be desirable to give it a nest
eptacle like that used by Mandarins and Carolinas, a small kennel
;ed above the ground and reached by a sloping plank. It bred
cessfully thus in the London Zoological Gardens.
The Cereopsis Goose ( Cereopsis novce-hollandice ) is a large and
larkable Australian Goose ; its colouring, which is the same for
h sexes, is pale ashy grey, having blackish spots on the wings, the
, e greenish yellow, the legs are deep rose colour and the feet black.
It is a terrestrial bird and often travels far from water. It is very
: ;ressive during the nesting season, its victims being chiefly terrestrial
Is ; even Cranes find them dangerous. It is a very hardy species,
,; often breeds in the depth of winter when it is necessary to shelter
nestlings. The female has a deeper voice than her mate, and the
es can easily be distinguished owing to this peculiarity. The
i eopsis must be pinioned to make it stay ; young birds disappear
h extraordinary rapidity unless pinioned.
We shall now consider those birds which, though popularly known
" Geese ", scientifically speaking are really intermediary between
Geese and Ducks.
The Spur-winged Goose ( Plectropterus gambensis) and its related
; cies make up a little African genus of which some examples are
sorted from time to time. They are large birds with very large pink
11, metallic black and white plumage, strong beaks with a purplish
knob. They are unfortunately ugly and clumsily built, very
teful, and very susceptible to cold. The sexes are alike.

This pretty Palceornis is an Uncommon bird in confinement; only
r have come into my possession since I began aviculture, and I
T e seen but two more in other collections. The first specimen I
r owned--a cock given me by Canon Dutton--I tried to mate with
Len Moustache Parrakeet {P. fasciata) living at liberty. The two
J : ds greeted one another in the most friendly way, but Unhappily
Malabar had not learned the language of his alien bride and did
; connect her with her cries when she was out of his sight. The
^sequence was that he lost touch with her the evening following his
?ase, straved, and was never heard of again. Several years later
present breeding pair reached me. They were in immature plumage,
1 as the beaks of both were black with a little red I concluded that
ad a couple of young cocks. It was, therefore, an agreeable surprise
tne when the beak of one gradually became wholly red, and that of
! other entirely blackish, showing that I had a true pair. For a

end of her days.
For two years the Malabars showed no sign of nesting. In )
third they inspected a nest-box but got no further. In the foil
the hen laid and got egg-bound--a very common occurrence w
this species, which likes to breed in February if it can. The three e&lt;
were given to foster parents, but proved infertile, as the cock,
some reason, would not pair properly with the hen, though in mi
ways he was very attentive to her and extremely interested in the ne
Later in the spring the hen Malabar again laid, this time withe
accident, as the weather was then warm, but once more the eggs wt
clear.
I began to fear that my cock was useless as a breeder, and it w
an agreeable surprise when, the following year, one of the three ep
proved fertile and hatched. All went well for about ten days, and th
one morning I opened the aviary shelter to find the nest-b
fallen to the ground and the young bird inside cold and dea
The nest was fastened to the side of the aviary shelter i
means of a very large nail passing through a brass eyelet ho
Naturally I supposed that the nail or the fastening had g
loose, but strange to say the latter was perfectly intact and secUi
while the big nail, with an Upward cant, w r as as firm in the wood of t

enemy X, annoyed at the prospect of a young Malabar being sUcces
fully reared, had, in the dead of night, detached the heavy box fro
fche nail and hurled it to the ground !
This year I determined that whatever games X might play, he shou
not be able to repeat his little joke of 1926, so I provided the Malaba
with a perpendicular natural tree trunk in the shelter, about five fe^
high and hollow for half its depth. For some reason the birds wei
slow in settling down. April passed and May was well advanced, an
I began to have serious fears that they would drop into moult witlioi

y to her ; indeed in their behaviour to one another the pair always
linded me of human married couples living in that bygone period
en husbands and wives addressed one another as " Mr." and " Mrs."
d treated each other with a kind of distant courtesy. The Malabars
re really quite fond of one another, but the hen always liked to
se as being rather severe and managing, and as a rule her mate
moured her out of politeness. During the winter and early spring
&amp;gt;nths they would display to each other from a distance, bowing
wly with the neck extended, " chin " depressed, tail slightly
sed, and iris contracting. Occasionally during the display the
I would bring Up food from her crop, but she never fed her mate
r allowed him to approach her closely. Only when she was nesting
earnest would she let him feed her. In the ordinary way the cock
peared to be an almost henpecked husband, but it was only on
ferance that she drove him about, as on the rare occasions when she
dly annoyed him he put her in her place in no Uncertain fashion,
ter the tiff above mentioned the hen went to the nest in a chastened
me of mind, her movements being accelerated by her angry spouse,
the entrance hole she turned on him and although a moment before
had been making her fly for her life, he got out of her way at once,
' it is etiquette for cocks to give way to their wives at the nest. So
lg as she was doing her duty he was still prepared to show her the
j artesy due to a lady, but at the same time there were limits to the

lat those limits were ! One of the strangest, most interesting and
3 st amusing things I have observed with breeding Parrakeets is
e anger and distress the cocks often display when their partners
II not settle down in an eligible residence that has been provided for
em. This annoyance is not due to thwarted sexual instinct, as it is
; splayed just as much when the hen is willing to pair ; neither is it
ational, for it is hardly ever shown when there is no nest within
ich and the birds are in breeding condition.

four eggs hatched and early in August the young ones left the nest

Palceornis I have seen. The areas of the plumage, which are grey
the adult, are heavily washed with green in the nestling, giving a mo
Uniform green tint to the whole body. The black ring of the adr
is quite clearly indicated by a dark line widening under the low
mandible. To my surprise, the beaks of all are not black but red, tv
having a small dusky patch below each nostril. Presumably, therefore, tl
dark beaks of certain female Palceornis are not a primitive characterist
but a recent development, and it is the brighter red beak of the ma|
which is the primitive feature. The red-beaked female Javan Parrake!
would appear to be a more primitive type than the dark-beaked femaj
of the almost identical Moustache Parrakeet. Does anyone know tlj
colour of the beak of a hen Moustache Parrakeet when she first leav"l

had happened, and what was to be done for the best ? Both adult I
were moulting, so there was no question of a second nest. Had th
parents quarrelled about the education of their family or had the he
attacked her youngest child and been very properly punished by th
father ? Belying on the fact that the male Parrakeets are Usual); j
more patient and devoted to their newly fledged young than th
mothers, I removed the hen Malabar to another aviary and hope&lt;
for the best. Luckily all went well, and the cock proved a model parent)
In the care of his children he was amusingly methodical. Each on
was fed at a different time to the others ; he seldom fed all at once!

The main aviaries consist of a range of twelve, facing south. Each
iary has a shelter 6 feet wide, 4 feet deep, 6 feet high front, and
feet high back. A large window of Muranese glass is fitted in the
nt of each. The floors are cement. Attached to each house is a flight
feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet high, half-inch wire netting being
?d. Shrubs, etc., were originally planted, but as the majority of the
labitants are Parrakeets, they were quickly denuded of leaves, and
w only the skeletons remain.
The inmates and their doings this year are as follows :--

No. 2.--A large flock of Green Budgerigars have had a long

rrakeet, and a Lineolated Parrakeet.

No. 4.--Red-crested Cardinals and a Purple-eared Glossy Starlii
No. 5.--A colony of Nyasa Lovebirds, have been very success!
quite a large proportion of the eggs laid were hatched and the you
reared.
No. 6.--Madagascar Lovebirds, have only played at nesting ;
laid everywhere but in the right place.
No. 7.--A pair of Red-speckled ConUres ( C. euops), have now be
out of doors four years. They have nested four times during the 1;
eighteen months, laying four or five eggs on each occasion ; in ea
case they have eaten the eggs after sitting for ten days to a fortnig
They are a true pair, but possibly the eggs are infertile.
No. 8.--Black-cheeked Lovebirds, have reared several youngste
No. 9.&apos;--A cock Madagascar Lovebird mated to a hen Red-fat
Lovebird, very friendly but do not seem interested in nest-boxes.
No. 10.--A cock Madagascar mated to a hen Black-cheeked Lot
bird, five eggs were laid but proved infertile. A Madagascar suppli
as a mate earlier in the year was scalped by the Black-cheek.
No. 11.--Masked Lovebirds, no attempt at nesting yet, but da
are still young.
No. 12.--A pair of Turquoise-rumped Parrotlets (Psittacula eye
opygia) from Western Mexico, wintered out successfully, but as far
I can tell have never ventured inside a nest-box.
Another aviary with a shelter 12 feet wide and 6 feet deep, and wi
a flight 42 feet long and 36 feet wide, is in course of erection ; tl
will be tenanted by a mixed series of Lovebirds next spring. T 1
smaller aviaries are reserved for the use of two African Grey Pam
and a Blue-fronted Amazon, and for any British birds that come
hand. A delightful pair of finger-tame Abyssinian Lovebirds complet
our family of aves at present.

Consul-General Cremer shows how these laws can be relied upon
plicitly, and if a breeder understands them and knows the pedigree
his stock he can calculate with accuracy as to what colour and what
ventage he may confidently hope to produce.
The chief difficulty when breeding from blue-bred greens or green
it-blues, as General Cremer calls them, is that a percentage of the
)geny are pure greens which cannot be distinguished from blue-bred
sens from the same nest. These can be tested by crossing them with
les. If pure greens they will produce only greens, albeit these will
blue-bred, but if themselves blue-bred (or* split-blue) they will
)duce some 50 per cent of blue offspring.

Sir, --I have recently received a Tanygnathus Parrakeet (Tam
nathas luconensis) which is perhaps new to aviculture, although, strac
to say, it figures in Levaillant's quaint old book on Parrots. In sizel
resembles Mueller's Parrakeet and in general plumage the GreJ
billed Parrakeet, but it differs from the latter in having a wide b
of turquoise blue across the head and hardly any blue on the run:
There is a well-marked strip of brownish bronze feathers in each wii
and some of the smaller wing feathers near the back and mantle a
broadly marked with blue. Taken as a whole, the bird's colouring
distinctly beautiful, although, like all Tanygnathi, it lacks grace
form. Unlike a captive Greatbill, which is Usually sluggish and moros
the Lucon Parrakeet is active and friendly. He talks in a somewh
husky and indistinct voice, and displays to a human friend in t&apos;
usual manner of the genus by throwing up the head and elongating tl
neck. Occasionally he Utters a series of short screeches like a Palaeori

colouring about the face, head, and neck. Mine have a habit of work
at their nests extremely late in the evening, long after every other bi
except the crepuscular Bourke's Parrakeet, has gone to roost.
The plate that appeared in the Magazine hardly, I think, d"
justice either to A. fischeri or A. per sonata, the latter especially bei
far more strikingly coloured than it is represented. I have four mask
Lovebirds--a pair and two odd ones. The pair are nesting and may ha
young. The Masked Lovebird appears less amiable than its thi
nearest relatives, and the first I received murdered one of their numl
on the short journey from London to Havant. I must say, howevj
that there is no undue squabbling between the nesting pair and the t 1
others, as would take place in the case of Peachfaces, so it may be tli
it is only when its temper is exacerbated by uncongenial surroundin
that the Masked Lovebird's supply of love runs short. Certainly, as f
as appearances go, A. per sonata, with his bright red nose, coal bla
face, large white eye circles, and yellow waistcoat, is the most perfe
little nigger-devil imaginable !

Sir, --With reference to the correspondence in the October numb
of the Avicultural Magazine on breeding A. roseicollis, I succeed*
in rearing four young from one nest last season (1926). From w
observations I would say that the hen solely incubated the egg
although the cock went in and out of the coco-nut husk, presumab
to feed the hen, but rarely stayed more than a few minutes. Withii
a week of the young hatching, the hen died from inflammation, an
the cock succeeded in rearing the young himself.
One young got its wing caught in a joint in the husk and unforti
nately died before I found anything wrong ; one I gave away, lea vie
father and two young. Unfortunately I omitted to separate, and i
February this year one was killed by the parent, leaving one whic
I am sure is a hen, although they have not shown signs of nesting.
Contrary to general practice, these birds made no nest other tha;
scooping out the husk.

THE YELLOW-BREASTED CISSA

This fine bird, figured from nature in the accompanying plate, was
discovered in Cochin-China as far back as 1846, but it was not until
5 that the collection then made and deposited in the Fornis Museum
sorted out and that Griglioli and Salvadori named it; as the type
firnen was entirely faded blue and white, they called the bird
oleuca, &amp;quot; white-bellied,'' an entirely wrong expression which we
better change in English into " yellow-breasted ". The fresh bird,
pature, is pale Naples yellow underneath, bright grass green above,
h a broad black band over the eye, black subterminal spots on the
1 and chestnut markings on the wings.
In captive specimens of all Cissas kept in indoor cages with
Tfficient fresh animal food, all the yellow in the plumage fades to
&amp;gt;te, and the green becomes pale blue, wfith greyish olive markings
die wings. In that state, however, the present bird looks different,
* still quite handsome. The same thing happens to skins if they are
, carefully protected from all light. It seems that daylight destroys
yellow pigment, which has to be constantly replaced through
stances derived from live or fresh food, such as insects, small

vertebrates and berries, and also that fresh air and sun is indispensai
Flesh, the proper food, is essential, and is well shown by the&apos;fact t
we found wdld Cissas which had faded to blue and white more or ]
completely on the Kontoum Plateau in South Annam, a dry and bu
district which had been suffering from severe drought and fire
many months and where live food was very scarce.
The Yellow-breasted Cissa is a rare bird in skin collections, and u
I obtained it only three others, So far as I am aware, have been obtaii
since its discovery. It inhabits the thick jungle and forest of Cochin-Ch
and South Annam, moving about in small flocks and mixing w
Drongos,Babblers, Woodpeckers,etc. They are very noisy, shy, and v
difficult to secure.
For the past few years some had been kept by Dr. M. Cogna
then the Governor of Cochin-China, in the Saigon Zoo, and last spi
Dr. Cognacq brought to Cleres three fine birds, which I sent to Mr. E
before leaving again for the Far East. As they had been over a yea
captivity they were blue and white, but in perfect condition. T;
did very well in a very large outdoor aviary, with a heated she!
which contained other birds of similar strength, such as Starlii
Although they mastered them, they never molested them. Their sh
and hues, as well as their pretty and amusing attitudes, made them, v
conspicuous and charming. Male and female are similar, and their t&lt;
length averages 13 inches. These CiSsas are fed on insectivor
mixture, cut-up meat, fruit, and plenty of mice, mealworms, ;
insects, which they are extremely fond of and which helps to ret
their yellow and green dress. The last time I saw them they w
moulting and the yellow and green feathers showed distinctly am&lt;
the old faded white and blue ones. They are very strong birds, f
rather noisy. They had been carrying sticks about all the sumn
but never attempted to make a proper nest.
The three above mentioned Yellow-breasted Cissas are the first i
only ones ever imported alive into Europe, or, in fact, to leave tl
native country.

[ need say no more about its appearance. The three birds he gave me
3 year have done splendidly in a large aviary, and I consider them
y hardy birds. They have been fed principally on insectile mixture,
h some meat and fruit, and mice when obtainable. Last October
\0x25A0as delighted to see that the birds had moulted out in their natural
ours, and instead of being pale blue and white were grass green and
ion yellow. This colour they retained right through this summer,
y getting much paler by the end of August, when they started to
ult again. From the few feathers they have grown so far it looks
if they will be green and yellow again. The coloured plate gives a
&amp;gt;d impression of the bird, both in its natural colours and in the
e and white state. The whole of last winter the three birds were
ot in an aviary together. Last April, in order to give them a chance
lesting, I tried to sex them, and to take the odd bird out of the aviary,
all the three birds looked alike, this was no easy matter. After
tching them carefully for some days, I discovered that two of them
med rather friendly, so I caught up the third and put him in another
ary. I also emptied out the aviary of all the other birds, and the
r of Cissas had the whole aviary to themselves. The next day I
nd the pair fighting viciously, and thinking that I had made a
?take and put two cocks in together, I decided to separate them,
put off doing this till the evening. To my surprise in the evening
ound them building in a basket I put up for them inside the
iltered aviary. They worked very hard at it, and the nest was soon
shed. The outside was rather rough, but the inside was nicely lined
:h dry grass and feathers. On the 16th April I found one of the birds
iting the nest, and on the following day there was one egg in the nest,
the 18th I found the hen bird on the floor of the aviary, egg-bound
1 very ill. After treatment in a warm room, she recovered, but did
visit the nest. As it was the first known egg of this bird, I removed
nd sent it to Lord Rothschild for his collection. Again, on the 28th,
mnd the CiSsa on the nest, and on looking into it I found her sitting
two eggs. Only the hen bird incubated, but the cock sat on the side
the nest, and attacked any of us if we entered the aviary. He was
te fearless, and flew at our heads with open beak, making an awful
se all the time. The hen bird sat till the 24th of May, when I took

Cissa was seen on the nest again on the 2nd June, and on the next &lt;
I found one egg in the nest. On the 4th I again picked up the hen e
bound, but she recovered after treatment. On the 5th she was on
nest again, sitting on two eggs. I found two broken eggs on the fk
so it looks as if these birds lay at least four eggs in a clutch. On
16th they deserted the nest and again I found the two eggs cb
They again went to nest, and I found the hen sitting on two eggs
2nd July. These two eggs were also clear. After all her efforts I foi
the hen bird in heavy moult and in very poor condition on my ret
from abroad. I fed her up, but she suddenly died on the 20th Septeml
The size of the egg is more or less the size of that of a Blackbird, wh
it resembles closely. A dull white with minute olive-brown sp&amp;gt;
specially heavily spotted at the larger end. Needless to say, it wa
great disappointment to me not to have succeeded in breeding i
lovely and interesting bird. I have put the two remaining Cissas toget
in the same aviary, so far without quarrelling, but I am afraid they
both cocks.

Perhaps our members may be interested to hear of the young R
Peplars, an account of the rearing by hand of which was publishec
the September issue.
All three prospered, and were strong on the wing, delightfully ta
and intelligent. One, when fully grown, succumbed to pneumoi
but the other two continued to thrive. They live in one partitioi
the aviary here at Fallodon, 22 by 25 feet in size, which they si
with a pair of Kentucky Cardinals, a Rock Thrush, three Ama
Parrots, and one Grey African Parrot. Every morning the Pep
are set at liberty, and they remain out till 2 or 3 o'clock in the af
noon. These hand-reared birds fly to us readily for food and c&lt;
panionslnp, and are easily taken in to their safe quarters when we w
to put them back in security from the Brown Owls. They go at o
to the feeding trays, and eat with the zest their hours of flight h

?n them. When first they are released their exuberance in flight
xhilarating to watch : a marvel of speed, power, and grace. They
ep past and over, it is difficult to keep them in sight. They go
 |eading through the green spaces of the trees, keeping in touch with
h other by their call-note, and when lost to sight this little yelping
e is audible quite far away over the Park, and then again
denly far to the left over the kitchen garden and drive, such is their
ftness. It puts one greatly out of conceit with cages, and I feel more
vinced.than ever that people might trust their birds with greater
&amp;gt;rty than is customary because the territory instinct is so strong ;
! course, always pre-supposing the point of contact with food and
lk is once established and the cage or aviary, as the case may be,
amiliar to the birds and easily accessible.
Our Amazon Parrots have their freedom in this way, and are
remely intelligent about it. When the Rock Peplars alight on us
3 r one of their circling flights, they look hastily to right and left,
ir eyes appearing not to focus on near objects at all ; but a raisin
% monkey-nut soon catches their attention, and they feed from our
; or hands till, like a flash, they are off again. They eat hawthorn-
ries and lime twigs and buds, and the daisies on the lawn and
ding grasses; and such is their love of water that when quite wet with
a they take an even more exuberant bath than usual.

from his antediluvian looks, it might be of Noah.
However it is of the Paignton birds I intended to write, so will g
on to them and give some account of the rarer and more interesti:
ones I saw on a recent visit, an account based on notes taken at t&apos;
time, and help from the owner where these and memory failed me.
Thrushes, etc.--One Temminck's Whistling Thrush, one (or tw
Chestnut-bellied Rock Thrushes (P. erythrogaster), two pairs
Dayal Birds (both nesting), one Red-footed Cuban Thrush (Min
cichla rubripes), and another Mocking Thrush (Melanotis ccerulescei

aviary it Used to inhabit, for it was there for some time without showi
any obvious sign of failing vision before its condition was discovert
Black-gorgetted and White-crested Jay Thrushes, one of eat
share an aviary, while an adjoining one contains, among other bin
a rare and most interesting Babbler, a pale brown-grey bird like
Crateropus, allotted to another genus, Turdoides. It is believed to
the only specimen in captivity.
Tanagers. --Last year&apos;s Tanager hybrid and its parents are si
alive ; the mother, Mr. Whitley is almost certain, is episcopus. Otl
rare Tanagers are two Pirangae, not vet certainly identified ; o
probably ludoviciana , the other ? bidentata. Two Schistochlamys cap
trains have been in the collection for three years and were shown
the 1925 Palace Show.
Yellow-winged Sugarbirds.-- Two pairs nesting.
Bulbuls. --Two of the rare Himalayan Hypsipetes psaroides a:
two species of Chloropsis.

had two clutches of eggs, but both were clear. A really smart examj

L the yellow markings are much more distinct and regular than in
er specimens of this ? " sport " I have seen,* and its owner is
vinced it is a true species (or sub-species), not a freak.
Several of last year's young Rose-breasted Grosbeaks occupy
ioUs abodes about the place, and young have been again reared
i year.
Blue Grosbeaks. --One pair of the North American Guiraca ,
rarely seen nowadays, two pairs of Cyanocompsa cyanea, a male
ch is almost certainly parellina, and another much larger bird
h a very big beak, at present Unidentified and not agreeing,
jarently, with any of the described species. One Black-throated
idinal. Three American Buntings of three species, two with
:k markings (one perhaps a Field Sparrow), while the third has
ned out to be a male Spizella atrigularis, a small Unpretending little
i, grey with a longish tail and blackish mask, rather suggesting in
.,pe a Bearded Tit. Has this bird been imported before ? Several
uarini Finches. Some Cape x House Sparrow hybrids, bred
s year.
Weavers. --A Urobrachya cock paired with a hen Yellow-backed
i yd ah, one Mahali Weaver, a cock and two hen Melanopteryx ,
o pairs Dinemellia, and six Buffalo Weavers out of seven brought
m Gambia last year ; they look like two cocks and four hens. These
cavers usuallv do not live long in captivity, though one has lived for
rood many years at the Zoo (the exception which proves the rule),
d the survival of six out of seven indicates a triumph of manage-
;nt, as indeed does the condition of all the birds.
One of the new Estrilda xanthophrys. Scl. still survives. These birds
me from Duidila in Abyssinia ; the importer gave Mr. Whitley this
ormation and is sure of the facts, for on this trip he lost some of his
&apos;ds at Marseilles, among them other specimens of this Waxbill, which
I counts for the French examples from which the species was originally
i scribed last year. A pair of Vinaceous Waxbills from Gambia
ve nested and laid several times this year, but not reared ; the cock
is not very fit and had a bald head, but is now in good health, and
the pair is nesting again, there is hope of success.

believed to have been bred in Australia.
Troupials. --An example of the extremely rare Cassidix oryzivo
Starlings. --Two Galeopsar salvadorii. Last year&apos;s Burchel
X Bed-winged Starling ( Galeopsar x Amydrus) still alive, but t
father is dead. One Malabar x Pagoda Myna bred this year, a
the parents nesting again. The Glossy Starling Mr. Whitley 1
bred regularly is now considered to be nitens, not sycobius.
Orioles. --Three Maroon Orioles, which I saw in 1926 just af
arrival almost flightless and very untidy, now in good condition a
flying in one of the aviaries ; they eat a good deal of milk.
Birds of Paradise. --A pair of Twelve-wired arrived duri
my stay, which were kept, but a male Red Bird was returned.
Crows, etc.-- Australian and Indian Crows, one Senegal I
( Cryptorhina ), one Cissa, several Occipital Pies, one Diadem
and one Sumichrast's Jay. A Crow Shrike ? fuliginosa (not ver
color). One Rufous-backed Shrike (erythronoius) from India, o
of the small Blue Flycatchers ( Cyornis ), one pair Phainope}
nitens, and one Townsend's Solitaire.
Motmots. --Two, apparently belong to two species.
Rollers are quite a marvellous feature. A pair of caudatus nestin
five eggs laid, four hatched, one died next day. I saw three about
fortnight old, but Mr. Whitley wrote that one died soon after, a
that he did not think he would rear the others as they were weak a:
had undershot beaks, which he attributes to the cock's poor conditi
from persecution by his mate earlier in the season. Fighting amo:
themselves seems the great difficulty with Rollers, though they a

easure of success in breeding for colour during the past few years.
I am not at all certain that this is really a subject which should be*
ritten on or discussed in a magazine such as the Avicultural, which
purely scientific and not a publication for fanciers &amp;quot;.
I started Budgerigars with Blue-bred Greens some years ago, and
filter breeding from these for a couple of years with no more encouraging
\0x25A0suits than young Greens, I parted with the whole lot ; some eight or
Line birds going to Mrs. Chatterton. I fancy these were all hens ; from
lese hens, paired to Blue-bred Green cocks, which she purchased, I
 |elieve, from Mr. Marsden, she has, as most people know, bred Whites,,
lues, Yellows, and, of course, Greens.
I then started with two pairs of Blues, and from these birds, with
very occasional fresh Blue bird for new blood, I have during the past
mr or five years bred some hundreds of Blues.
I think it may safely be said that with Torquoise-blues--Bluest
! iways breed Blues--the exception to the rule must be extremely rare*
tid can be taken as negligible--the same does not apply to Cobalts,,
liich I suppose must be considered a less fixed type. I have at the

bred a Green bird from a Torquoise-blue hen and a Cobalt cock. The
ime nest contained two Blues and three Cobalts, as I have already
t :ated a Green chick is a very rare occurrence when both parents are*
f the ordinary or turquoise-blue colour.
The following notes are not of outstanding interest, but go to prove
(, lat although it is worth while working on definite lines, results cannot
e guaranteed, and that there is no rule-of-thumb in colour-breeding.,
laving one small heated aviary in the end of my greenhouse, I
ecided to start breeding early last January. Even with heat there is
distinct risk of egg-binding if one starts too early, so I put up four
*lue-bred Green hens and paired them with four Blue cocks. I got

two nests from each pair, some thirty young birds, before the coc!
were transferred in May to their rightful Blue hens. Among all the
young there was not a single Blue--but I did get two Yellows, whi&lt;
I greatly prized, and rightly so, as will be seen later.
Having one or two extra Blue cocks, I allowed one of the adu
Green hens to continue breeding later in an outdoor aviary. In tl
second nest she produced three Blues and one Green, and at the presei
moment she has five young, of which two are certainly Blues. Th
goes to prove that it is not wise to turn down " a pair of birds if they &lt;
not produce what is expected and wanted on the first occasion. J
July I paired one of the young Yellows (a hen then five months ok
to a Blue cock. I hoped to get a white, but the result was two Blm
and a Green.
I then gave her another Blue cock, and she has now two Whites an
a Blue, which is exactly what I expected and wanted. I think that it
unwise to introduce the ordinary Lutino or Yellow Budgerigar ini
one&apos;s strain--but if a Yellow is produced from Blue or Blue-bre
parents, it should be carefully preserved and bred from.
I have bred from several of this year's early-bred birds, and ha\
got some good youngsters from these young parents, but I must als
admit that some of the offspring have shown signs of " French moult
in varying degrees--whereas I have not had a single case among son:
hundred birds bred from adults this year.
A few more statements of facts may also be of interest, if they onl
give rise to opposition or discussion. There is little doubt, I think, the
even given the requisite abnormally bred or abnormally coloure
parents, it is more difficult to obtain young from these than it is froi
common Greens. As proof thereof, when I was breeding from the Gree
hens in my heated aviary in January, I also put in a Blue hen paire
to a Cobalt cock, the former died with her second egg. A Green Blue
bred hen paired to a very fine White cock gave me clear eggs, as di
also a Cobalt hen paired to the Green cock previously referred to, wh
was the offspring of two Cobalt parents. Some of these birds retrieve
their reputation later in the season ; the Cobalt cock has fathered thre
nests and, paired to a Blue hen, has produced eight Cobalts, ten Blue*
and one Green.

Dakar, the chief port of Senegal, is the headquarters of the export

usual contents of the catchers' cages, though odd rarer birds may
asionally be found there, but not very often, for these comparatively
1 3 ones are those which are not found as a rule in flocks and therefore

ere certainly looked down on by everyone else, but they could catch
rds, and, what is more important, could keep them alive and in good
*ndition after catching.
A party would start operations from home and, moving about
^ery three or four days, travel slowly along till their cages were
11 (400 birds was the object), and they had reached the place where
ley could sell their catch. This was either Bathurst, one of our up-river
ading places, where they sold direct to certain captains of steamers
hich came there to load ground-nuts, or at one of the French nut-
lying centres along the Dakar railway line, then only reaching about
)0 miles from the coast. New hands I suppose had to find good places
jf
n"r catching, but all the catchers I knew had learnt this from previous
sits ; they set the nets and began catching the first day, simply
atting them down early in the morning, baiting with a little seed and
lenty of millet-husks from the pounding-places, leaving them
^touched till the afternoon and then getting a catch. Sometimes they
ould set at a drinking place, but this was mainly for Weavers, and at
le end of the season proper or when they wanted Pigeons, etc. They
id not consider the results good enough to justify the spoiling of the
ets by the water, and therefore dry sites were the rule, clearings in the
dl grass either in or near the millet-fields or on the dry swamps,
range-cheek and Zebra Waxbills being the commonest bag in the last,
hree pulls a day was the rule, four exceptionally, as during the hot
lid-day hours there is nothing doing in the bird-catching line. One

Doves or Sand-grouse they had caught, and every self-respecti
catcher had one old net which he set at a water hole simply&apos; for tl
purpose. They fed their birds on millet ground-up in an ordina
coffee-mill with the addition of " findo ", a small grass-like cere
whenever they could get it. Our millet in its ordinary state is too ha
for Waxbills and the like, though Weavers, etc., husk it easily, but ev
these do better if given it ground. This grinding was done twice a da
at daybreak and again after mid-day before the men started on t
evening round of the nets. The water troughs were filled at the sai
time. The birds, therefore, had plenty of quiet time in which to fee
the essential thing with fresh-caught birds. In spite of the primiti
cages and the constant travelling, the birds did well in capable hane
and I learnt a lot of useful tips about the business from these peop
My experience is that with proper food and average care the mortali
is very low, ridiculously low compared with what used to be the ca
with English birds ; two per cent I should think was about t
average mortality while in the catcher's cages, say for about a mont

Such was the ease under favourable circumstances, and I have oft

effort being with three dead out of 400 odd from day of catching
Africa to arrival in England two months (at least) later. That is n
likely to be repeated, but I have often got other smaller lots home wi
almost as good results, and, of course, there have been times win

ie between catching and export, so that the birds, as some one

L y be so or not, but they are now hustled along so quickly and have
breaking-in to cage-life before shipment, that I should have
pected the dying rate would exceed the journey speed. In any case,
ere is no doubt that these birds do not as a rule arrive in the condition
ey used to.
The bird-catchers themselves have changed, and I believe also the
rd-buyers at the ports. Of the first, instead of the " select " few of the

I .ent the rains at their proper job, that is on their farms, we now may

&amp;gt;wns where Firefinches, formerly sacrosanct as guests of the town,
3 rdon-bleus, and Combassous can easily be caught. In about a week
ieir cages are full ; they are then bundled on to a lorry and hustled

l ige-life; haste and quick delivery instead. Most of the present-day

besides, catching now goes on at all seasons, for now that big liners

Passengers, and one sees there cages of Weavers (. Pyromelana , Quelea,

 |firefinches, all in full colour, from about August to November. These,
1 if course, are caught during the rains, the period of full colour, and at

BREEDING THE HERMIT THRUSH

By Maurice Amsler, M.B., B.S., F.Z.S.
On the occasion of my last visit to our late and much lamentec
President, Mr. Hubert Astley, we were talking about his pair of Hermi&apos;
Thrushes (Hylocichla guttata), which I believe he obtained through th&lt;
New York Zoo. He then said that if the cock did not shortly begin tc
sing he would let me have them to try my hand at breeding them.

To the great sorrow of every aviculturist, Mr. Astley died within a
nth, and through the generosity of Mrs. Astley*the birds came into
. possession in May, 1925. The hen was not in perfect plumage on
ival, but improved after being in an outdoor aviary for a few weeks,
e cock, though in good condition, never uttered a note ; a few straws
;re carried during the summer, but no serious attempt at nesting
is made.
S&apos; Not knowing how hardy these birds might be, I caged them up in
e autumn, and a few weeks later the cock, who had for some time
hibited a queer quivering movement in one leg, died in convulsions.
My chagrin at this was very great, both because of the bird s origin
id also because I did not think it likely that I could ever replace him.
Much to my surprise and delight, I received a letter from Chapman
j March, 1926, offering me another cock of this species. I, of course,
)0 k the bird, which proved, indeed, to be a male. The sexes are
Osolutely identical and, as they fight like Gamecocks, whether they be
airs or like sexes, during three-quarters of the year, I was only able
) determine the sex of this last bird when he began to sing a few weeks
iter.
I discovered subsequently that this cock came from Captain Stokes,
nd that it was through him that Chapman knew I was wanting a
nale of this species.
The two birds were turned out in April, 1926, and were inclined to
piarrel, but not seriously. Towards the end of the month the cock
I &amp;gt;egan to sing, and continued this throughout the summer months,
i [n May the hen carried a few fibres, but did not build properly, and the
, wo birds may be said to have led entirely detached existences. There
1 ,vas none of the devotion seen in true Thrushes during the breeding
I reason, when the cock collects and gives every dainty he can find to
i :he hen.
Thus, another breeding season passed with nothing achieved beyond
U great deal of singing of a somewhat monotonous quality.
The following autumn and winter were spent in the same aviary,
( which has a good shelter but no heat.
f In the early spring of this year there was some bickering between
the two birds, which by degrees became so serious that I had to put

the cock into an adjoining aviary whence he could see his wife b
could not molest her.
During the middle of March I replaced him with the hen, and a sta
of armed neutrality was established and maintained. The male beg;
his little song in April, and this was continued from dawn till dai
throughout May, June, and July, until the hen began to sit, when 1
became completely silent.
On 13th July my man informed me that the hen Hermit Thrus
had built and laid one egg. I did not look into the nest, which ws
placed high up m a small open box about 4 inches square, but I was nc
at all happy to see her carrying fine grass and coconut fibre after sh
had begun to lay. This was something abnormal and irregular, an
boded ill for the future. On the following day I looked into the nest an
found a very neat structure, cup-shaped, and lined with very fin
grasses and fibres. It contained one small egg, which I just glanced a
and did not touch. For a couple of days building went on, and then tb
hen spent most of the day on the nest. I took the opportunity of he
being off to look into the nest again. I found one beautiful elongate!
' Starling-blue " unspotted egg, and the other which I had previoush
seen. The latter I removed and examined. The hen's behaviour wa:
then explained. She had taken possession of and relined the nest of a
Siberian Bullfinch, which had built and laid one egg without iot
knowledge.
Another egg was laid on the following day, and this completed the
clutch.
During the time of laying and the early part of incubation was the
only time when an onlooker would have suspected any association
between the male and female. The former was usually dancing
attendance on his spouse, and was frequently seen to give her gentle
but friendly pecks, quite unlike his behaviour in the early part of the
year. Incubation began in earnest on 17th July, and lasted until the
29th. During these twelve days the hen was only seen off the nest for
a few minutes on two or three occasions, and as far as I know was
never relieved or fed by the male.
There was nothing distinctive about the two squabs during their
early days. The first two days they were constantly brooded by the

; a, after which both parents took their share in the duties of
ding.
During the first few days ants' eggs only were used, and meal-
.rms entirely disregarded, I suppose, on account of their size. At the
e of six days, mealworms, a few small earthworms, and quantities of
11-scoured gentles were used, and all seemed to be going well from
lat one could see from below, but on 7th August I found one of the
icks in a fairly " high " state of decomposition, on the ground, 6 feet
nn the nest. It was well feathered and looked much like a miniature
ng Thrush of about ten days of age.
My chances of rearing this Species, already slender, were now halved,
d I have to thank the male parent for any success which I may have
record, for from this day onwards the hen seemed to lose all interest
her family, and the whole duty of feeding devolved on the male,
lose time was fully occupied in collecting live food for the remaining
ick and chasing the hen away from the much coveted contents of the
j r e-bait pan.
On 11th August the young Hermit Thrush had left the nest. He was
st thirteen days old, but looked as if he would have been the
1 tter for another two or three days in the nest.
I Compared with his parents, he was very dark in colour ; the back,
ngs, tail, and head were a dark lead-grey instead of the bright
tmamon-brown of the adult. The upper breast was a similar colour.
iis, the crown of the head, and mantle were flecked with numerous
! ots of light buff. The lower breast and abdomen were a dirty white,
th no markings of any kind.
The weather about this time was so atrocious that I expected each
t iy to find him drowned, but although he persisted in staying m the
itside flight, notwithstanding the fact that I often drove him into the
elter, he seemed to have the sense to find spots on the ground where he
i as more or less sheltered from the rain, and there he was constantly
! ssed over and cared for by his father, who, like most parent birds,
 |ways Seemed to know the exact whereabouts of his offspring, though
frequently hunted around and could not find him. It is interesting
* note that the male began his little song again on the very day the
lick left the nest.

On 16th August the young bird could pick up food and could j
quite strongly, though he still spent most of his time Squatting und

A day or two later I found the young bird in extremis, and on pickii
him up discovered that he had attempted to swallow a dead bloom

thickness of a lead pencil, and he had very nearly gorged the whol
I was able to extract it, and a few moments later he seemed none tl
worse.
On 13th September the youngster was as large as his parents ai
almost indistinguishable from them, but his general colour was st
a little darker than either of the adults and he still showed the bn
spots on the crown of his head and the upper mantle.
I believe and hope that it is the first occasion on which this speci
has been bred in captivity, for I feel sure that had they not unfortunate
had to change hands, Mr. Astley, who was a past-master at breeding tl
genus Turdidne, would have succeeded sooner or later in doing wh&lt;
has taken me two years to achieve.

e rapidity with which they settled down and commenced breeding

Little seems to have been recorded concerning this rather sombre
floured Lovebird, figured somewhat indifferently in the Avicultural
Magazine, July, 1926.
Until last month only one living example had ever reached England,
ad that only stayed a few days before continuing its journey to

Concerning this species, Dr. Emin Pasha, C.M.Z.S., who w;
assassinated in the Upper Congo in the autumn of 1892, writes
" Agapornis ftscheri is a noticeable bird of this country (Ussongc
One seldom traverses the woods here without a pair or a small pari
of three or four individuals being met with, which utter delicate scream
not so piercing as those of Agapornis pullaria, as they fly high up wil
a whirring noise, and in a straight course. These Parrots also frequei
the ground a good deal. In the crops of shot birds I have found hi
grass seeds, which must have been picked Up from the ground, {
there was no upstanding grass anywhere about." ( J.F.O. , 189
pp. 338-9.)
Agapornis personata
The Masked or Yellow-breasted Lovebird is undoubtedly one &lt;
the most beautiful members of a very attractive genus. First discovere
by Dr. Fischer at Kibaya in Masailand and described by Dr. Reichenor
in J.F.O. , 1887, p. 55. Until recently extremely rare, only thre
specimens having reached England, en route to America, in 1925 ; it
now quite plentiful and is proving an excellent aviary bird. It remair
to be seen how it will stand the winter outdoors, but there is no reaso
to suppose it will prove less hardy than A. nigrigenis.
The sexes would appear identical in plumage; the shape of the heac
however, is a sure guide in sexing. They are quite friendly dispose
to one another in an aviary, but some Seem very quarrelsome in
confined space.
Mr. K. \ . Painter, of Cleveland, Ohio, was successful in breedin
from the three birds already mentioned. According to our Editor 1
Parrakeets , p. 281, Mr. Painter writes that his three birds were pu
in a large flying cage of which the inside part was about 14 fee
square and 10 feet high, with an outside flight of about the same size
He had no idea of any young ones coming until they suddenly appearei

*, for they contained embryos nearly ready for hatching." Oscar

The return of the Bittern to Norfolk is one of the most satisfactory
ults of the efforts that have been made in recent years to protect our
1 -e birds. Some few years ago the Bittern was no more than a casual
itor to this country on its migration. Many years before this it had
id regularly in Norfolk, and elsewhere where conditions were suitable,
t persecution from collectors and so-called sportsmen had driven it
ay, and it Seemed unlikely that it would ever again return as a
: ceding species. But now it has come back, thanks to the protection
it has been afforded it, and for several years past its " boom " has
sn heard throughout the Broads district, and it has nested freely and
ired its young unmolested.
! And it is the ardent desire of all bird-lovers that the case of the
I ttern may not be a solitary instance of a species returning to its
'mer haunts, and, with an increased love of birds and an abhorrence
the insane desire to kill every rare arrival, other former breeding

The author writes in a vivid and charming style, and all his chaptt

the sun increases in power, and the water evaporates, grow larger a

THE BIRDS OF BUTE 1

<bodyText confidence="0.9949255" page_id="58075837"  page_num="Page 342" year="" vol="">
The Island of Bute in the Firth of Clyde is about 16 miles
length, with an average breadth of 4 miles. It is of a very irregul
shape, two-thirds being arable land and the remainder mostly und
heather. There are two large lochs, and the ground rises in parts
over 600 feet, and parts are well wooded.
With such a variety of country a varied and numerous avifauna w
to be expected, and Mr. McWilliam is able to give accounts of no le
than 168 species as occurring on the island. The Lapwing is coram&lt;
at all Seasons, and is extremely conspicuous in the fields and on tl
moors in spring. The Curlew is also extremely common. The Skyla
and the Song Thrush and the Waterhen are easily found. The Gann
is to be seen diving almost every day between April and Septembe
Gulls old and young are present almost everywhere at all seasoE
" In fact," writes the author, " from the diversity of the country, the
are few places of the same size where a naturalist would be certain 1
finding so many of the finer British birds as on Bute."

BEHAVIOUR OF BLUE ROBINS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.883999828571429" page_id="58075838"  page_num="Page 343" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The following note may be of interest and help to anyone who
the happy possessor of a pair of Blue Robins, but who has failed
induce them to nest.
Last winter a pair of these truly delightful birds arrived here
; d were most carefully tended ; in fact, they were perhaps pampered,
afraid was I of losing one or other before the breeding season. At
[ 3 end of March the birds were placed in a nice aviary with only a
,v Parrot Finches and some Chinese Quail as companions.
During the whole of April and May every insect was pounced on
&apos; the male and given to the female, who seemed to have a never-
; ding appetite for such dainties ; at the same time never a straw was
j]
rried, though I had provided some four or five most attractive boxes
all types in the shelter of the aviary. I began to feel despondent,
3re especially So on 28th May, when I visited Mr. Ezra and found
at his birds were rearing their second brood. I looked around for a
use ; his birds were certainly not so fine a pair as mine--the aviary
i smaller, and there was less choice of nest-boxes; in fact, the one
e birds had used was hung in the open on a post--" A silly place for
k
e birds to choose,thought I.
On the following day, as my birds were still doing nothing, I took a
idgerigar nesting-box and hung it on a nail which happened to be
j eking out of one of the posts forming the outer flight of the aviary,
1 me 6 feet from the ground. What was my amazement to see both
rds instantly dive into the box through the entrance hole. The time
is 1.15 p.m., at 2 o'clock I looked in the box and found an almost
mpleted nest. By 9th June the hen had laid her clutch of four eggs,
3m which she reared three young. Contrary to Captain Waud, I find
i ese birds very easy to satisfy. Mine must have consumed several
j nts of gentles when rearing their young.
The season was now too far advanced to expect a second nest, but
im still wondering whether any attempt at nesting would ever have
&amp;gt;en made had I not put that nest box outside.
Maurice Amsler.

Sir, --My Sula Island King, mated to a Crimson-win;
hatched two young ones with her third nest; one died when a few da\
old, I think because the first brood worried her and prevented hq
from feeding properly, she being too good a mother to send thei
about their business. The second left the nest on 4th October, and is
fine bird, rather differently coloured from the three older ones, re
covering more than half the breast, while there is a tinge of the sam
colour on the throat. About ten days before the young bird fie 1
the indefatigable King laid a fourth time in the same log, feeding he
offspring and sitting on the eggs at the same time. In the former tas
she was helped by the Crimson-wing, although the latter has been Ion
in moult.

AN INTELLIGENT CRIMSON-WING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99530715" page_id="58075839"  page_num="Page 344" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- A young Crimson-wing I bred this last summer recent!
gave an almost uncanny display of intelligence and adaptability;
When he could feed himself, I moved him from his mother's aviary t
that occupied at night by the liberty birds, it being my intention t-
train him to fly at liberty. The liberty bird aviary is one of a row o
about twenty exactly similar aviaries, and is a hundred yards from th
Crimson-wung's habitation. The only means of exit in the morning i
through a small door about a foot square, low down in the front of th&apos;
flight, an opening not usually discovered by birds until they hav
been in the aviary many days or even weeks. In the afternoon ai
inward-pointing funnel of wire-netting is put in the little door to trap
for the night, the birds which enter to feed. Only one Parrakeet, ai
adult cock Crimson-wing, has ever learned to find his way out througl
the end of the iirward-pointing funnel, and it took him many month:
to do so, and he was never able to negotiate a funnel as long as tkos&lt;!
at present in use.
The young bird did not seem disturbed by his change of quarters
and was not observed to be making any effort to find a way out, bui
that Same afternoon, with the funnels in, he made his escape ancj
joined his father on the top of the aviary where he was born. Next

ruing I found him feeding inside the box used for birds at liberty,
ich are not shut up at night. It has a dark interior, and the food is
visible from the entrance, and only birds trained by gradual stages
*r use it. Of course, in this case he had his father's example to
ow, but even so he learned the use of the thing in an uncommonly
"rt time. As he had soon found his parents, and an outside supply of
d, I concluded that he would enter the other aviary no more, but
hin a couple of hours he had left the old birds and was back inside
and has never offered to leave it since !

The bird was a Bauer's Parrakeet (Barnardius zonarius), not a
rticularly fine specimen, but was a wonderful whistler, whistling one
two tunes in a very sweet mellow tone, in fact, it was the sweetest
istler of any bird I have ever heard.
The bird was sold to the late Mr. Frank BoStock, a brother of
. E. H. Bostock, and many thought at the time that the sale of this
d might be an advertising stunt, but of course there could be no proof
this.
I am afraid the name " Gin Gin '' was a coined one.

GREEN INDIAN CORN AS FOOD FOR BIRDS

Sir, --It may interest some readers to hear that I have found i
green cobs of Indian corn (maize) a very useful food in my avh
this Summer, Budgerigars, Parrakeets, and Finches all seem very ft
of it and prefer it to lettuce, seeding grass, or unripe millet sprays.
The best time to use this corn is just before the grain is fr
developed, but no longer milky
It is of course necessary to strip off the outer leaves and the si
tassel, So that the birds can get at the grain easily.
The silky tassel when dried is an excellent material for nest linin
This note is chiefly intended for overseas members, but I th

lid appear that they soon die in Chinese hands.
It has been quite impossible to obtain this species in Shanghai
he lower Yangtze River ports this year, as no birds came down from

dealers were unable to produce birds when quite large sums were
ired one must assume that those brought down the preceding year

Sir, -- I read Mr. Nicholson's letter on the breeding habits of the

I have a late brood of half-fledged young in the nest at the tir

Incidentally I have found the best nesting material for them to
branches of lime, from which they readily strip the bark. I wou

Sir, --I am now able to record the successful breeding of the Mask

</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981489555555556">
2. --The Avicultural Society shall consist of Ordinary and Honorary

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2b inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species&apos;], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.
