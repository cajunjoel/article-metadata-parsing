It is with much satisfaction that we present the ninth
Annual Volume of our Magazine, the first of the New Series, to
the Members of the Society, together with our Report for the
Year: satisfaction, not because we have reached, nor even
approached, either perfection or finality in improvements, but
in the pleasing and incontrovertible fact that we are able to
point to a steady advance all along the line.
The Avicultural Magazine, the great bond of union between
the Members, has been substantially improved. With every
number we have issued a coloured plate, most of them being of
first-rate quality, and every one an original painting of a living
bird, drawn specially for the Magazine. Only those who have
had personal experience can form an idea of the immense
labour and anxiety, and the heavy and continuous expense,
which attach to this one single item in the formation of our
Magazine. Most of the water-coloured drawings are by the
skilled hands of Messrs. Gronvold and Goodchild, and we
have also once more to thank the Rev. H. D. Asteey for his
kind assistance in this connection. Neither must we fail to
heartily thank those who allowed us to have their birds
painted.
In addition to the coloured plates, we have published
photographs and various interesting and valuable drawings and
figures, notably those which accompanied Mr. Pycraft's
valuable paper " On the Topography of a Bird," which appeared
in March.
The increase in Membership has been substantial, and
may still be expected to steadily increase as the Society becomes
more widely known; for it seems to be certain that there are
numbers of aviculturists in this country and around the world
who would be only too glad to join if they were aware of its
existence and merits. Here is a way--by making the Society
and its Magazine known--in which every Member can render
As the Monthly Magazines are sold, more and more plates have to be coloured as
circumstances may demand.-R. P.

valuable assistance. Our Magazine, month after month, finds
its way to France, Italy, Switzerland, to Holland and Bulgaria,
Portugal and Madeira; to various parts of India; to Egypt,
South Africa and Natal ; to the West Indies and the United
States of America; to Tasmania, Western Australia and New
South Wales. One Member studies its pages in his tent in the
Sudan, with a grave laxity as regards attire and his feet in a
bath, trying to feel cool with the thermometer standing at 122 0
Fahr. in the shade; while another, writing from Lokoja in
Northern Nigeria, tells us how she looks forward to the coming
of the Avicziltural Magazine , and how she enjoys the lovely
birds she sees about, and " If I can get any curious ones
photographed I will send you copies." The thought that our
Magazine thus goes to such distant and out-of-the-way parts of
the earth, and gives instruction and pleasure to so many at home
and abroad, ought to spur us on to produce a publication worthy
of the Society and of our country.

Society, with the view of strengthening it and making it more
efficient; we may specially refer to the creation of the new post
(honorary) of Correspondence Secretary, so kindly accepted and
ably filled by Dr. A. G. Butler, Ph.D., &amp;c., &amp;c.
It has been felt that it is unfair to old and faithful Members
that new comers, who have neither laboured nor contributed
towards the measure of success now attained by the Society and
its Magazine, should be able to step in and fully participate on
the payment of so small a sum as 2/6. The Entrance Fee has
consequently been raised to 10/6, a substantial but still quite a
small enough increase under the circumstances.
The sale of the Avicultural Magazine to the general public,
and business of a similar character, continue to show a steady
increase, thanks to the energy of our publisher, the volume of
business transacted being again well in advance of that of any
previous year. The demand for back volumes still continues,
with the result that Nos. 1, 3, and 4, as complete volumes, are
now out of print.
The season has not been altogether a favourable one for

Report of the Council.
the breeding of birds in our aviaries ; nevertheless some of the
results obtained have been of considerable value. The breeding
of the Indian Bustard-Quail or Greater Button-Quail, Turnix
tanki, by Mr. D. Seth-Smith, has taught the cabinet naturalist
that his conclusions, when the aviculturist has not been taken
into his counsels, are liable to be disturbed; and the most
remarkable fact, hitherto totally unsuspected, which has now
been brought to light, that the period of incubation extends for
only about twelve days, could never have been discovered by all
the Museums in the wide world. The timid Rain Quail has
been bred by at least four of our Members, and the beautiful
White - fronted Dove, Leptoptila jamaicensis, (and another
species which we are taking steps to see and identify) by Miss
R. Alderson. The former has likewise been bred by Mr.
Castle Sloane. But Mr. St. Quintin leads the van. Not
only has he bred and fully reared two Demoiselle Cranes, three
young of the Ruff, one Pin-tailed Sand-Grouse, etc., etc., had
young (5) from the Bearded Reedling and eggs from the Blue
Thrush, but his Waxwings have hatched young in two nests ;
unfortunately none was reared.*
The Black-tailed or Rock Pebbler Parrakeet has been suc-
cessfully bred by the Rev. B. Hemsworth and Mrs. Johnstone,
and Yellow-rumps hatched but not reared by Mr. Fasey ; and the
latter Member, and also Mr. D. Seth-Smith, have each reared a
brood of the charming Many-coloured Parrakeet. An illustrated
account of the nesting of the Silver-eared Mesia in Mr.
Phillipps' aviary adds to our knowledge of this interesting
species ; and it is not unworthy of being placed on record that
his pair of Bee-eaters, which were figured in April, 1902, and
have been in his hands since the 20th September, 1901, are still
alive and well.
Some of the above species have not hitherto been bred in
the United Kingdom so far as is known, and the Society's Medal
has been awarded in some cases, and doubtless will be awarded
* In the eighth edition of the Zoological Society's List of the Animals, there appears
an entry which infers that five Waxwings were born in the Gardens on roth June, 1881
Mr. Scherren, a Fellow of the Zoological and Member of our Society, most kindly in-
vestigated the matter, and wrote me as follows : " The Waxwings are all right. The entry
in the List is an error. Mr. St. Quintin is first after all."-- R.P.

in others as the accounts of the several occurrences are pub-
lished.
&apos; Amongst the birds of the year which have appeared may
be mentioned the Varied Lorikeet, figured in July, which perhaps
may be as disappointing as regards breeding as the Brown's
Parrakeet (August, 1902) seems so far to have been, and a new
Firefincli (. Lagonosticta niveiguttata), to which reference was
made at p. 179 ; a new Waxbill, too, Estrilda rhodopyga , has
appeared in the Italian Bird-market (see pp. 249 and 405). An
unusual number of the glorious Regent-bird which arrived in
January, mostly immature specimens, and which are scattered
about in our Members' aviaries and birdrooms, may give us an
opportunity, which should not be neglected, of confirming or
refuting the generally received opinion that the male takes only
two years to attain the plumage of the adult.
The pair of exquisite Golden - shouldered Parrakeets,
Psephotus chrysopterygius, referred to at page 300, remind us that
the energetic and enthusiastic Member (Mrs. Johnstone) who
imported the male has also privately imported (see also page 345)
various species from the Philippines, some quite new as living
birds, and some perhaps rare even as cabinet specimens. How-
ever this may be, a few skins sent to us for identification shew
that, among the living, there would appear to be two examples
of the glorious Philippine Oriole, Oriolus chi?ie?isis, distinguish-
able at a glance from the Black-headed Oriole, O. melanocephalus,
by the patch of bright yellow on the anterior part of the fore-
head, and from the Black-naped Oriole, O. difftisus, by the
smallness of that patch ; two of the vivid-green, ruby-eyed
Calornis panayensis ; a Mindanao Hornbill, Penelopides affinis;
a pair of the Philippine race of the Bronze Fruit Pigeon,
Carpophaga csnea var. chalybura; and last, but not least, a
Racket-tailed Parrot from Mindanao, doubtless Prioniturus dis-
curus (see page 408).
Thanks to the kind courtesy of another Lady-Member, we
have beeii enabled to issue (April) a carefully drawn head of a
Balearic Crowned-Crane, Balearica pavonina, shewing the correct
face-markings of a living male, and the tiny wattles of this (in
England) rare species, of which inaccurate and misleading plates

have been placed before the public, and which is so frequently
confused with the much more common Cape Crowned-Crane,
B. regulorum. Three good specimens of the latter may be seen
at the London Zoological Gardens, in their nice new home near
the Insect House.
The finances of the Society are as satisfactory as is
possible under the circumstances. In order that no good objects
for our plates may be missed, and that we may always be ready
with coloured plates, large sums of money have to be expended
months before the plates are actually issued, and are conse-
quently not available for paying current expenses. This causes
inconvenience, and hinders the development of the Magazine,
for it is occasionally found necessary to curtail the size of a
monthly number and to reject kindly offers of photographs, etc.
The nature of the work demands this, and it is unavoidable.
Nevertheless our bills are always paid, our business is sound and
healthy, and the Magazine has attained to a position far ahead
of any it has held in the past, and may now be regarded by our
Members as a valuable property ; and it is for the Members
generally, not for a limited few, to render assistance by
increasing the Membership and thus increasing the means by
which further improvements may be made in the Magazine--
and also by contributing to its pages.
We have to thank Mr. Arthur Girl for the assistance he
has kindly rendered to our Members by his Post mortem Reports.
The help rendered by the Officers of the Society and
Members of the Executive Committee we most gratefully
acknowledge.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.932521764705883" page_id="10284061"  page_num="Page 13" year="" vol="">
The Medal maybe awarded, at the discretion of the Committee, to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species
of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity
in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must
send a detailed account to the Secretary, for publication in the Magazine,
within about eight weeks from the date of the hatching of the young, and
furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive Committe may require.
The Medal wiil be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be
old enough to feed themselves, aud to be wholly independent of their
parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full, so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young,
and be oj value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of award-
ing the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the breeder.
Any evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only disqualify the
breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance, but will
seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently 7 advance
for the breeding of the same or other species.
In every case, the decision of the Commit f ee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as circumstances will permit.
The Medal is struck in bronze, and measures 2 |inches in diameter.
It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing
eggs, and the words "The Avicultural Society--Founded 1894." O11 the
reverse is the following inscription: "Awarded to (name of donee) for
rearing young of (mime of species) a species not previously 7 bred in captivity

THE BLUE WREN.
Malurus cyaneus.
By Reginald Phieeipps.
(Continued, from p. 249 of Vol. VIII.)
It is probable that this species has not previously bred in
this country ; so far as I know, this is the first year that the
living bird has found its way to these Islands. I will, therefore,
just add a word or two to what has already appeared.
Those who are accustomed to birds and their ways will
have observed, when they read my supplementary remarks on
p. 248 of our last volume, that coming changes had already cast
their shadows beforehand over my little Blue Wrens,--though at
the time I did not realize the full significance of the words I
committed to paper. I vaguely referred to the unrest of the
male, and to the circumstance that, when I peeped into the
aviary to see how the young bird was getting on, I found it
sitting side by side with its mother. This was the first occasion
on which I had seen these two sitting quietly together by them-
selves. From that time these two, and these two only, were
inseparable, hunting, feeding, and cuddling together, for they
had been absolutely deserted by the male. The latter now
seemed to have but one thought, how to get out of the aviary
and be off and away.
Whence this sudden change ! The bird whose chief
thought had seemed to be the protection of his fragile little
child had now ceased to think of it, and ignored its existence.
And whither did he want to be off and away to ? Had he a
touch of migratory fever? or was the old villain thinking of a

Mr. R. Philupps,
certain fair damsel, hitherto referred to in these pages as the
Spinster Aunt, who, when last seen, was bounding about on the
top of the aviary, and had suddenly and mysteriously dis-
appeared ? Is this then the secret of the reputed polygamy of the
Blue Wren ? Is it his custom, after nesting with one wife, to
hand all care of the young brood, when fairly independent, over
to her, and himself to start afresh with Spinster Aunt No. 2, and
so on until he has reared a brood by all of the three or four
Spinster Aunts, one after the other in due order and succession ?
Small wonder that the number of the latter is limited to four ! ! !
These little birds are always on the move. Like Fidgety
Phil, they can't sit still; and the colours of the old Bluebeard
are so bright that one can usually detect him in a moment. But,
on the 9th of August, not one moment but many passed, and the
moments developed into minutes, and the minutes into hours,
but 110 Fidgety Phil! ! ! In vain I scanned the aviary, in vain
I mounted to the higher windows of the house and searched the
neighbouring gardens with my eyes, but no glint of his bright
blue jacket rewarded my efforts. Nevertheless I felt pretty sure
that, if not caught nor killed, he would turn up before long--
and towards mid-day he was on the top of the aviary. It will be
remembered that the Spinster Aunt had been taken into the
house a short time previously. As quickly as possible I clapped
her into a cage-trap, let the trap down from a window 011 to the
top of the aviary--and before one could say "Jack Robinson"
Fidgety Phil was a prisoner and was safe in the house. Perhaps
unwisely, but fearful of further escapes, and not unmindful ot
the cold and wet, I caught up likewise the mother and child;
and the four birds have since been living together in a six-foot
cage in my dining-room.
I do not know what to say about the song of the Blue Wren.
They have several little twittering call-notes. In addition, a
little rippling twittering song is occasionally uttered, certainly
sometimes by the female, but I cannot say that it ever comes
from the male. It is an insignificant little song, bearing a
family resemblance to that of our own little Jenny Wren but
inferior to it. While the birds were in the garden, I occasionally
thought I detected, amidst the babel of many voices, a better

class of Wren's song, which I attributed to Fidgety Phil, so
perhaps what I now hear is the song of only the female--perhaps
of only the Spinster Aunt, who uttered it from time to time
during the period that she was alone.
The odd female, whose tail I carefully notched, has been
put back into her old position in the family circle of Spinster
Aunt, and is decidedly vinegarisli in consequence. The three
are once more united, but it is exceedingly difficult to pick out
the baby. Sometimes it will dart to its mother for a tit-bit: and
whenever the parents are sitting together it will jump on to the
top of them, and will not be satisfied until it has forced its way
down and finds itself once more with a beloved parent on either
side of it.
It had been my desire to have the family of Blue Wrens
painted whilst they were in the garden. The group I had in
my mind, and which I was anxious to have depicted on paper,
was the little tot glued on to the thin high waving cane on
which I had first perceived it, and which was its favourite perch
when the sun shone, with its parents on either side, the father
protecting the infant life while the mother nurtured it--a
beautiful picture of Family Life as designed by our All Wise
Creator. But Mr. Gronvold had his hands full, and was not
able to pay his respects to the Blue Wrens until the 13th of
August, after they had been brought into the house. This was
unfortunate, for the light was indifferent and the birds were
unrestful, and the male, with that remarkable consciousness of
brilliantly-coloured birds in the presence of strangers, declined
to be interviewed. I would not listen to our artist's bland
suggestion that I should terrify the little mites by catching them
up and putting them into a small cage, which might be moved
about, and in which they could be freely inspected; much as I
value a good painting, I have a far greater regard for the welfare
of my pets. Eventually a large plant was placed on the table,
and from behind it Mr. Gronvold made several sketches and
studies from life, on this occasion and again on the 29th, with
the result that we are now able to present to our Members the
exquisite plate which adorns our first number of the New
Volume and Series. The little caterpillar in the foreground is

On the Blue Wren.
over large for Mr. and Mrs. Phil, and baby Phil wonders whether
its parents will offer to pop such a huge creature into its tiny
maw.
I must now briefly bring this account up to date.
Early in September the male commenced a full moult, and
now, at the beginning of October, scarcely a vestige of his old
glory remains. The tiny blue feathers, cast from the head, and
blown out of the cage by the birds' wings, would lie on the
carpet, and on the oilcloth in front of the cage, and looked like
little specks of blue wash. At first I did not realise that the
specks were feathers. The changes of plumage at the wrong
time of the year, and the general confusion over the seasons, and
also the cold, greatly tried the bird, and I thought I should lose
him ; but he is maintaining his ground well, and I now have
great hopes that he will survive.
Many feathers in the cage showed that some other bird
was in moult. Whether it was only the young bird, or whether
the two adult females also moulted, I cannot speak positively ;
probably all have been moulting ; but the two females have kept
their health and plumage remarkably well. The young bird has
certainly been moulting, but retains the feminine plumage and
light-coloured bill, so I suppose it must be a female. My hopes
that it may be a male are sometimes raised by seeing it sitting
side by side with the Spinster Aunt ; but I am not very hopeful.
During the day, the four birds may often be seen cuddling
together, but at night, while three roost on a twig in the open,
side by side, the fourth, presumably the Spinster Aunt, hangs on
to the side of the cage under the shelter of some green baize.
During the day they frequently make use of a box I have placed
in the cage, but I am not aware that they ever roost in it.
Although the four often cuddle together for the sake of
warmth, it is more often only the three, the odd female being
still treated as a stranger.
For several weeks they were terribly frightened at the
approach of any one. The baby, when caught in the garden to
be transferred to the house, was terror-stricken. Now, however,
they are getting moderately tame, and never attempt to fly out

wants.
Their little rippling and twittering voices are incessantly

They are very sensitive to cold ; their delight, when the
sun shines into their cage, is unbounded.
The}&apos;&apos; seem to be wholly insectivorous.
I often wonder how it has fared with some other specimens

birds, on the 26th May last !

Part II.
In my last article I dealt with the birds inhabiting the
" coppet " or thick bush, and we will now turn to the tracts of
land locally known as Pine Barrens. These barrens are, as I
explained in my previous paper, extensive tracts of barren rock
on which grows a minimum of vegetation; but shooting up on
the rock in about two or three inches of soil, with their roots
stretching out horizontally in all directions, stand pine trees,
which reach a height of 40 or 50 feet. They are not very large,
seldom exceeding 15 inches in diameter, and are destitute of
foliage except at their summits where their branches join to form
a fairly dense covering. Here and there, amongst the trees, are
patches of bush, and over the rest of the ground long coarse
grass grows scantily, intermixed with a few palmettos. In this
region the birds are somewhat scattered and may mostly be found
round the clumps of bush : it must not, of course, be imagined
that the birds I am about to notice are strictly limited to the
barrens. Nature refuses to be ruled by laws as immutable as the
confines of an aviary and many of these birds are found in the
" coppet " and vice versa.
The commonest and perhaps the handsomest of all the
birds of the barrens is the Bahama Finch* (S. zena ) known

Mr. J. L. Bonhote,
locally as the Cock Robin. It is to be found in some numbers
round every clump of bush and seems to feed chiefly on berries,
the black berry referred to when dealing with the Grosbeak being
also a favourite with this bird. It is an extremely handsome
species, reminding one by its size and bearing of our Chaffinch :
in the male the whole of the head and throat are black with the
exception of a white superciliary streak and malar stripe, and a
patch of white shading into yellowish to form a median line on the
throat. The back, wings, and tail, are jet black, the wing-coverts
and outer tail feathers being broadly edged with white ; the nape
and rump are deep chestnut, as is also the chest, which fades away
to bright yellow on the breast; the rest of the underparts are
whitish, shading to olive on the flanks. The female is throughout
of a dull yellowish green and the young resemble her. I have
never found the nest of this species, but from the large pre-
ponderence of males at Abaco last March I feel pretty certain
thej&apos;' must have been nesting at the time. Flying about in small
flocks they may generally be found by listening for the call note,
which is a high-pitched " twee " frequently uttered, especially
during the early spring, when the males are very pugnacious ; it
does not appear to have any noticeable song. As this bird is
frequently caught alive I have on several occasions had one in
my possession, but they did not live long, and I never succeeded
in getting them on to artificial food, but have had to feed them
entirely on wild berries ; they get very tame, but their beauty is
their only attraction.
When wandering along the pine barren, apparently
destitute of birds, a loud laughing note may possibly ring in your
ear and in front of you on a bough may be noticed a large
Flycatcher, about the size of a Thrush, its colour and mode of
flight being very similar to that of our common species ; again
you will hear the note and the bird is gone, only to a neigh-
bouring tree in all probability, but so sudden and jerky are its
movements that the eye can scarcely follow it as it goes behind
one tree and round another, finally coming to an abrupt standstill.
Such is the Bahama King Bird, * Pitangus, locally known as the
Piiattgus bahamensis-- Mus. Cat. Vol. XIV., p. 180.

" Fighter," but not to be confused with the * Grey Tyrant, which
also passes under that name and which it closely resembles
in colouration and habits. There is one point worthy of note
about its plumage, viz., a bright coloured yellowish crest on the
top of the head. This crest occupies the same position as the
bright golden patch in our Golden-crested Wren, but there the
similarity ends ; in the latter bird the bright feathers are bright
for their whole length, but are concealed when the bird is
quiescent by the longer feathers in the front of the crown
completely covering them. With Pitangus it is otherwise ; the
bright colour is, as a rule, entirely concealed, being situated in
the bright coloured bases to the feathers of the crown, and no
amount of erecting the crest, which is frequently done, will
display to any extent this patch. The colour is displayed however,
and most effectively too; it is done by drawing to either side the
feathers of the crown, especially the small ones immediately in
front of the patch, and erecting the crest at the same time. A
bird which I had in captivity for a short time used, probably from
fear, to display it thus on my approach ; this it would do several
times in rapid succession, the sudden display and obliteration
producing a very curious and weird effect. Three or four other
species of Flycatchers are found in the islands, and they all bear
a very close resemblance to each other, although only Pitangus
and Tyrannus have the bright crest. The most common species,
next to Pitangus , is the Rufous-tailed Flycatcher ( MyiarcJuis
sagrae), a species generally met within pairs, and frequenting the
bushes in the pine barren, although it is often met with in the
" coppet."
They are very tame and allow a close observation, especially
when building their nest, which is generally placed down a hole
in a tree and composed chiefly of dry grass ; both parents work
assiduously at the nidification, but if they should meet on
returning with some material they would stop on a near-by
bough for a short flirtation, after which each would go off again
in a different direction.
No record of the birds in this part of the globe would be

Mr. J. E. Bonhote,
complete without mention being made of the Humming Birds, ot
which three species are found in the Bahamas. The commonest
and most generally distributed is the Bahama Woodstar (Doricha
evelynae) which is fairly numerous everywhere, although rather
local, being influenced chiefly by the plants in bloom ; they are
always especially common round the flow T ers of the sisal and
return again and again to a particular bush. The colouring of
this species is not very brilliant, being in both sexes of an olive
green, the gorget of the male, which is of a glistening purple,
excepted. The flight is straight and rapid, but seldom continued
long in one direction, the bird darting hither and thither or
hovering in front of some flower whilst sucking the nectar.
Another and rather finer species (Sporadimis ricordi) is only
found on Andros and Abaco, and is of a most gorgeous metallic
green all over, while a third species, which I did not meet with,
is restricted to Inagua.
Passing through the barrens a loud and clear call, consisting
of two notes, may often be heard ; in a short time a large black
bird with a long tail may be seen perched on a high branch
whence an extended view of the surrounding country may be
seen. On a nearer approach his cries will become more vehement,
and half-a-dozen or more of his comrades will rise from the
ground and settle on the neighbouring bushes, the whole flock
eventually taking to the wing and flying off in a long straggling
line. This is the Ani (Crotophaga ani) an aberrant species of
Cuckoo ; it is a long thin bird whose plumage is entirely black,
the most noticeable feature about it being the upper mandible,
which is flattened vertically so that its height at the base is nearly
two-thirds of its length. Although broad at the base it narrows
towards the tip and also along the culmen so as to form a sharp
ridge like a plough. I cannot speak from personal observation of
the uses of this curious beak, but according to Gosse, who writes
of it in Jamaica on the authority of Mr. Hill, it is used to open
out the soft earth in its search for food, and also " facilitates its
search for vermin imbedded in the long close hair of animals,"
for it is apparently accustomed in Jamaica to feed with cattle as
the Starling does in England. As I did not come across any
cattle in the islands I visited, there has been no chance afforded

me of confirming this habit. We have, however, not yet come to
an end of the peculiarities of this most eccentric bird. In its nest-
ing habits, about which much remains yet to be learnt, it carries
the idea of co-operation to an extent unknown, I believe, in
any other species of bird : for the whole flock builds a nest in
common, in which the eggs and young are hatched and reared
by the community. I can find no detailed account as to whether
the species is polygamous or not, nor the number of eggs laid,
etc. I have only come across two nests, which are large untidy
structures, built of twigs and apparently without any lining ; but
unfortunately in my first nest the inhabitants had flown, and
the second nest was placed high up in a species of cactus and
absolutely unapproachable without destroying the plant. At the
time I found it many and perhaps all the young were flying, but
the}&apos;&apos; used still to return every uiglitto roost in or near the nest. It is
very surprising that so little definite information should he forth-
coming about a bird so common and conspicuous, an inhabitant
of the cattle pastures, and with habits unparalleled among the
whole of the class Aves.
As the Sapsucker restricts its wanderings to the coppetand
gardens, so the Hairy Woodpecker (P.villosus) is only found, and
that sparingly, in the pine barrens. It is a black and white bird
resembling in size and colouring our Greater Spotted Woodpecker,
and apparently of very similar habits. Several other Woodpeckers
are found locally on some of the other islands, but I did not have
the good fortune to come across them. There are two other
species which may almost always be met with in the barrens ; the
one the Yellow-throated Warbler ( D. dominica), is apparently only
a winter visitor, but cannot breed * at any great distance away as
itis back again before the end of August; the other, the Pine
Warbler ( D. pinus ), is a resident, and has been separated into a
distinct race. The former is a beautiful little grey Warbler with
a bright yellow throat and chest margined with black ; the under-
parts are white heavily blotched with black on the flanks. It goes
about diligently searching for insects on the topmost branches of
the pines, reminding me by its actions of our Golden-crested

Mr. Russell Humphrys,
Wren. The Pine Warbler is a bird of similar stamp but of rather
stouter build, the upper parts being green and the lower parts
yellow. In habits it does not differ appreciably from any of its
congeners, and I have often shot it from among a flock ot Yellow-
throated Warblers. Such Pigeons as are found in the islands
may be looked for in the barrens, but, with the exception of the
White-crowned Pigeon, which is most abundant on the cays, and
of the Ground Dove, which abounds everywhere, the three or
four remaining species are all rather scarce and need not be
noticed here. The Ground, or as it is locally termed the Tobacco,
Dove is a most abundant resident and is common everywhere,
whether it be in the thick bush or in the pine barrens, on a
lonely desolate cay, in the gardens of the town, or even along the
roadside. It is a bird now too well known to aviculturists to
need a special description here, and is almost invariably met with
in pairs. It feeds and lives entirely on the ground, but when
flushed perches immediately on the nearest tree or wall. It breeds
practically all the year round and the nest, which is the flimsy
twig structure of all Pigeons, is placed either on the ground or
on a tree or bush at any height up to io or 12 feet. When the
nest is approached the parent does not go far away, and by her
solicitude betrays the fact of its existence, although a close search
is then required to find it, especially if it be 011 the ground, as it
is by no means conspicuous. The food seems to consist almost
entirely of a hard black seed (sp. ?), though it may be easily
trapped with any bait, and in confinement, becomes very tame,
feeding on very small grain.

Niltava su?idara.
By Russell Humphrys.
It may perhaps be of interest to our members to have a
short account of an example of Niltava sundara which came
into my possession early in June this year.
" The genus Niltava ," says Oates, " contains three species

of Flycatchers remarkable for the brilliant plumage of the
males. The sexes differ in colour, but both may be recognised
by the presence of a bright spot or mark on the side of the neck.
The Niltavas frequent thick jungle and are less typical in their
habits than the species of Cyornis , and they are said to eat
berries. They appear to be resident on the Himalayas.
" I11 Niltava the bill is somewhat compressed laterally and
narrow, and the base is covered by a multitude of dense plume-
lets, which conceal the nostrils : the rictal bristles are moderate
in number and in length ; the first primary is large, being quite
half the length of the second, and the tail is rounded."
He describes the male as follows : " Forehead, lores, sides
of the head, chin and throat deep black ; crown of the head,
nape, rump, upper tail-coverts, a spot on either side of the neck,
and the lesser wing-coverts glistening blue ; the remaining
coverts and quills dark brown edged with purplish black ; tail
black, the outer webs edged with bright blue ; the whole lower
plumage and the under wing-coverts chestnut ; bill black, legs
brown, iris dark brown ; length about 6-5 inches. Distribution :
the Himalayas from Simla to Assam, from 5,000 to 8,000 feet
elevation ; the Khasi Hills; Karennee at 4,000 feet. Blytli
records this species from Arrakan and Tenasserim. It extends
into Western China."
This beautiful Flycatcher is, I have reason to believe, the
first of its species to reach this country alive. It was in
excellent condition on arrival, perfectly healthy, in verjr good
feather and quite tame, illustrating how much can be accom-
plished in the way of importing delicate insectivorous birds by
those who are fortunate enough to be able to afford the necessary
time and trouble. The bird on arrival was placed in a roomy
box cage and fed on the usual soft food ; a few mealworms and
a little ripe fruit are given daily, a partiality being shown for
over ripe pears and greengages ; oranges or bananas are hardly
touched. In addition to the soft-food mixture, a small quantity
of dry ants' cocoons are placed in a separate dish, and are
invariably finished before a start is made on the moistened food.
Any insects that are procurable are highly appreciated.

Mr. P. W. Farmborough,
Early in June the bird commenced to moult, and at the
present time (Sept. 30th) it is practically completed, the quills
on the forehead and sides of the head alone remaining. Mr.
Harper wrote me that the bird was in song ; he was evidently
just going off, previous to moulting, when he arrived. He has,
at the present time, just started recording again. His initial
efforts resemble the warble of the male Red-backed Shrike, aud
some of his call notes are very similar to the English Robin ;
but it is too early to write much about his vocal abilities at
present.
I11 any case his extreme rarity aud brilliancy of plumage
make him a very interesting aud welcome addition to the aviary.

By&amp;quot; P. W. Farmborough, F.Z.S., F.E.S.
Once a y&apos;ear, at least, I spend some time at Sandwich,
Kent; where, as much as my opportunities permit me, I employ
my time in studying the fauna of the district; although
principally&apos; my attention is devoted to mammalian life, I often
for a change have a day with the birds of the district, with the
result, usually, that the one day only I originally intended to
have extends into several.
A very&apos; favourite hunting-ground of mine (both ornitho-
logically and entomologically) is that stretch of land bordering
the sea shore about three miles from the town of Deal. No doubt
many of the members of the Avicultural Society&apos;--certainly&apos; the
golfing members--will best know the district I mean when I
state that it is in the immediate vicinity of the St. George's Golf-
links and on the seaward side of the famous links. Some of our
readers will remember that, in the fourth volume of the Society's
magazine, I gave some experiences of the Grasshopper Warbler
obtained there. On this occasion I have to deal with the Ringed
Plover.

river Stour, my attention was attracted by some birds on the
water-line some distance away. Being tolerably certain that a
nearer approach would only end in their flight, I sat down among
the dunes just at the back of the beach, where I had a convenient
opportunity of studying the birds through my field glasses. My
curiosity was aroused after some time by noticing that every now
and again some of the birds flew or ran from the water-line to
the back of the beach where they remained a few moments, and
then rejoined their companions by the waves. This went on for
about an hour, until, after having noticed that certain of the
birds always went to the same spot, I gradually edged my way as
stealthily as I could nearer and nearer, still carefully focussing
my glasses on the line of shingle they kept returning to. That
there were nests there, there was little doubt, but knowing the
extreme difficulty of finding the eggs or young except by pure
accident I had little hope of being successful in discovering either,
but thought it was as well to try and see what could be done.
After very closely watching for nearly another hour some
signs of movement were detected among the pebbles ; the spot
was carefully marked and then I arose and approached it. The
majority of the Plovers flew off but two or three endeavoured by
artifice to attract my attention to themselves ; this however was
unavailing, and after a minute search round the marked spot I
discovered two downy little mites. As four is the usual number
of eggs laid by the hen Ringed Plover there were probably two
others, but, in spite of examining every inch, as I thought, for
yards round, I was unable to find more. Not having any basket
with me I was at a loss to know what to do with my young
captives. But whilst putting damp sand and some pebbles into
a straw hat hardly improved either its appearance or utility as an
article of wearing apparel, it certainly formed a makeshift arrange-
ment which answered the purpose.
Having got the youngsters home it was a poser to me to
know upon what they should be fed ; they obstinately refused all
food that evening, and would not look at hard-boiled egg the
next morning; I sent a wire off for a supply of mealworms and
fresh ants' eggs to be sent me immediately as there were none to

be had in the town, and whilst waiting the arrival of these I
went down to the beach and canglit a varied collection of insects,
sand-hoppers, small shrimps, etc. When these were offered they
were seized with avidity. When the ants-eggs and mealworms
arrived I made a chopped paste of equal parts with hard-boiled
yolk of egg; this was refused, and this resulted in another
journey to the sea-shore. This time a larger quantity was pro-
cured and I tried leaving out the mealworms and substituting
chopped shrimps in their place with the ants' eggs and yolk of
egg; this they accepted, and after one or two mouthfuls made
no demur again. I found that cooked shrimps were taken just
as well as the raw ones, but these I made into a paste by pound-
ing them up before mixing with the other ingredients. After
some few days some minced meat was gradually added to the
food, and from this they were by degrees weaned on to a staple
diet of chopped hard-boiled eggs, both whites and yolks being
used, chopped raw meat, bread crumbs, and a little game food
mixed in : this they thrived well on. *
As pets Ring Plovers get remarkably tame and confiding,
and will always come to the wires of the aviary if called to
obtain some tit-bit or another. They prefer a very thick laj^er of
sand in the aviary, and are very fond of dabbling in a very
shallow tray of water which was placed in for their benefit.
They do not seem to be quarrelsome birds and do not interfere
with their companions, the Californian Quails.
* I had just finished writing up to this point when, on taking down
my numbers of the Avicultural Magazine to have a glance through, I noticed
that on p. 90 (the March No. of this year) Mr. Percival has an article 011
rearing Ringed Plovers from the egg, which I was unaware of. I must
apologize for not having more carefully read my numbers of the Magazine,
before wasting space in the Society's periodical, which might be used to
better advantage than in being utilised to chronicle my experiences of a
bird which another member has done more than myself with.--P. W. F.
Independent accounts are always valuable ; and I am sorry that Mr.
Farmborough did not continue his account of these interesting birds.--R.P.

Pitta brachyura.
It was with considerable interest that I read the excellent
article by our esteemed Secretary, Mr. R. Phillipps, on the Pitta,
which is concluded in the September number of our Magazine.
I was disappointed, however, to find that nothing definite
was mentioned about the difference between the sexes. Our
most recent publication upon the birds of India, by Oates and
Blanford, gives us no clue ; it merely states that the sexes are
alike. During the past two or three years in India, I have made
it my business to carefully compare all the live Bengal Pittas I
could see ; with the object of discovering any guide to the identifi-
cation of the sexes. The Bengal Pitta is the only species of the
genus ordinarily met with in captivity; but it is far from being
a common cage-bird, even in India, where it is indigenous. Still,
I have had an opportunity of observing a few dozens of them ;
and the only distinction I can find is the width of the black
band of feathers which runs along the top of the head. In some
birds it is quite twice the width of what it is in others. This
difference is observable both in adult birds and also in the
young, even before the first moult; and I am thoroughly con-
vinced that it is to be relied upon. To determine whether the
cock or the hen has the broader line upon the head can only be
ascertained by dissection. E. W. Harper.

Sir,--A pair of my Budgerigars have chosen a very curious place for
nesting.
A few da} T s ago, whilst brushing out the fountain in the aviary flight,
I noticed a Budgerigar fly up from almost under my feet. Thinking it
rather strange that I had not noticed the bird on the ground, I stooped
down and discovered a hole (large enough for a rat to pass down) burrowed in
the earth underneath a large stone. I lifted the stone up, and a little further
under the surface I could just see a nest containing four or five eggs, which
appeared almost on the point of hatching. The Budgerigars had lined the

soil. I should think the burrow would be from twelve to fifteen inches
long.

I have had them for a few days, and they are very lovely ; and I am
naturally very anxious to get them through the winter well. They are in
very good condition, and do their importer much credit.
I am giving them canary seed, white and spray millet, rock salt,
cuttle-fish bone, and flowering grass. They are in a box cage, in a warm
room, with no fire, but next a bright conservatory.
I believe you have had these birds; and if you can help me in any
way as to their treatment I shall feel much obliged.
Can you tell me also if any others were imported ? these w r ere brought
over privately for me. M. A. Johnstone.
The following reply was sent to Mrs. Johnstone :
You are indeed fortunate in having secured a pair of the rare and
beautiful Golden-sliouldered Parrakeets.
You will find a coloured illustration of a pair, and a short account of
the species, at page 153 of Volume IV. of the Avictiltural Magazine; and a
further account of one of the females nesting (with a Red-backed Parrakeet)
will be found on page 157 of Volume V.
So far as I know , none of these birds has been imported since 1897.
Excepting the pair secured by the Zoological Society, all the specimens I
saw were females. I obtained two ; and the one which I wrote about on
the two occasions quoted is still alive and well.
She has been flying loose in the aviary and birdroom, and feeds on
what she likes. As far as I can see, she behaves like the Many-coloured
Parrakeet, and is just as easy to keep.
Although so &amp;quot;well seasoned, she does not like cold weather. During
the winter months, the birdroom is kept warm. O11 a fine day, the window

seldom that she does not go out.
When the nesting season is over, and the whole aviary is thrown open,
she spends most of her time, if not too cold, amongst the trees and shrubs,
nibbling away at the tenderest bark and young wood, and at any leaves and
shoots that may remain.
More or less all through the year, if I can find the time, I sow wheat,
etc. When the seeds begin to shoot up, she nibbles away at them with
much pleasure.
Her old mate, a poor creature, died long ago, and she will not take to
his successor, but spends her time flirting with the Red-faced Lovebird,
exciting the jealousy of the female, with whom sometimes she has fierce
battles ; so I am not hopeful of any further nesting operations from her;
and I cannot arrange to place her elsewhere.
She always wants to nest in the early spring, and falls into moult
rather soon.
She is a very simple feeder, partaking of the seeds you mention, and
occasionally taking a little raw fruit. I think she sometimes helps herself
to a morsel of plain biscuit.
Perhaps these notes may help you a little bit.
I should most certainly keep your birds warm during the winter and
spring. I may&apos; be quite wrong, but I do not believe in exposing such birds
to cold.
The difficulty about the nesting lies in their wanting to commence so
early in the year.
My female was a very timid sitter, so you would have a better chance
in a large than a small aviary. You will know best what arrangements you
can make; but take care that no other Parrakeets or disturbing elements
are placed with them.
My bird nested in a log-nest in the birdroom which was carefully
hidden away, and which was lying on its side, slanting up a little, with the
top off; but such a natural hollow tree as the one in which you reared your
Barnards would be infinitely better.
My bird takes a bath pretty regularly. R. Philupps.
[The species is still not infrequently confused with its near relative
the less uncommon Beautiful Parrakeet, Psephotus pulcherrimus.
Mr. Campbell says,--" Nests and Eggs. --Undescribed." I do not
know when those words were penned, but certainly some time after the

THE LETTERED ARACARI, ORIOLES, ETC.
Sir, --My husband has asked me to write to you about a miniature
Lettered Toucan we have just received, as he had to leave home this
morning. The Toucan has got a cold, to all appearance in its head (if this
is possible in birds); it snuffles through its nose until I feel inclined to
offer it a pockethandkerchief! ! and sneezes, and both eyes are running
so much that after a sleep they are so glued up the poor thing cannot open
them until I bathe them with warm water.
It eats well. I feed it on bread and apple mixed, bananas and pears
cnt up, and it has taken a great fancy to small raisins steeped in water. It
drinks a great deal, and I put glycerine and Parrish's food in the water. It
is very&apos; light to handle, and seems to feel the cold greatly. Its plumage is
rather dirty, but I suppose it would not be wise to wash it until it is better
--if it ever does get better. Are these birds very delicate as a rule ? I
suppose they come from South America ; I have looked through all the
numbers we have of the Avicultural Magazine but do not see any one
mentioning them.
Please let me know if there is anything else we could do for it, as I
would be very sorry if it died it is such a pretty bird, and so brightly
coloured; and I do not think it is often on the market, though I frequently
see the Ariel Toucan advertised.
You may like to hear that the Sykes' Oriole, the young one that we
sent you a sketch of some time ago (Vol. VIII., p. ioo), has not yet changed
plumage, though it looks much brighter in colour, and has a bright
yellow vent and under tail-coverts. The little yellow feathers are still on
its shoulders that were marked in the sketch, but are brighter yellow. It
has still got a speckled breast, and is in perfect health and plumage.
Our aviary did very -well this year. We had not many deaths, the
worst being three young Diamond Doves that were bred in the aviary and
lived about four or five months, and then seemed to get fits and died; they
were in lovely plumage, and hardly to be distinguished from the parents.

Onr Blue-winged Lovebirds also bred in a log-nest out-of-doors while
we were away, but on onr return we found five dead young ones fully
feathered in the nest. I fancy rain must have got in and drowned them.
Our Virginian Cardinals also built, laid, and hatched, but we could not get
enough insects in time for them, and they (the young birds) gradually died,
the surviving one being about seven days old when it died.
M. F. RaThborne.
The following reply was sent to Airs. Rathborne :

Your Lettered Aracari is very seriously ill. Keep it as warm as
possible, be very careful to shelter it from draughts, and do not wash it on
any account.
Try and get it to take svrnp of squills. Try also ipecacuanha wine in
the drinking water. Place as near as possible to the bird ( outside the
cage and out of its reach) a small cup filled with cotton wool, on which
from time to time pour eucalyptus oil. In addition to the fruit, offertliebird
a few mealworms and a little very carefully scraped raw meat, and a
little cooked meat, such as cold mutton. Whole raisins often cause
indigestion; it is best to cut them up. You may also give boiled carrots
(cut up), grapes, and egg.
These birds are very sensitive to cold; and they are often in a dying
state before they reach our hands.
The Lettered Aracari, Pteroglossus inscriptus, comes from Guiana and
Lower Amazonia (South America). The throat and neck in the male are
black, in the female brown. (See also my letter on "Toucans," in the
October number).
I am glad to hear that your Sykes' Oriole is well. May I ask you to
watch its breast, and note when the speckles disappear. My Blaek-naped
Oriole (Vol. VIII., p. ioo) has been very slowly changing his body feathers
all through the summer, and last September suddenly&apos; grew (for the first
time in this country) wings and tail, and is now flying about the aviary in
the most brilliant plumage, almost eclipsing in colour (a), but not in
character, the male Regent-bird (Vol. VII., p. 138).
The Blue-winged Parrakeets, Psittacnla passerina, are not true Love-
birds (see Vol. II., p. 49). Although so common, they do not very often
breed successfully&apos; in this country&apos;.
* I have been so severely censured for presuming- to compare the two birds that I
hasten to add that the beautiful velvety feathering of the head and neck of the Regent is
\0x25A0wholly wanting in the Oriole, the latter also wanting the rich orange-yellow and reddish
orange of the head and crown of the Regent-bird. In character the two species cannot be
compared for a moment.--R. P.

The young Doves should not have died. If they had fits, there was
something wrong with the feeding.
Some insectivorous parents will carry preserved yolk of egg in flakes
to their young. Another time you might try this along with the insects
should your Cardinals nest again. Ordinary boiled egg will not do ; it is
too sticky I suppose. Reginald Phieeipps.
RAVENS, CROWS, ROOKS, ETC.
Sir, --Can you give me any information regarding the habits of
Ravens ?
A friend of mine in this town has a bird which we call a Rook, not
knowing what else to call it; but we think now it must be a young Raven.
She found the bird some two months ago outside her drawing-room
window, pecking hard at the glass to draw attention to its state of hunger.
The bird must have escaped from somewhere as its wings had been clipped,
but the creature could fly to a certain extent, and used to spend most of
its time in my friend's garden roosting in the trees. It has one very
interesting habit which I have never known Rooks have, and that is hiding
its food in holes and crannies of rockery-sort-of-places. It is very fond of
my friend as also is my friend of it, and will let her do anything she likes
with it.
The bird was missing for a few days last week, greatly to our sorrow ;
and we were afraid it had been caught or killed by stone-throwing boys, of
which there are a terrible number in Bideford ; and my friend hunted
everywhere for her pet, and enquired at the houses all round. It was
found at last in a cottage near by, in quite a small box in which it had
hardly room to move; and I should imagine that not much food and no
water had been given to the poor thing all the three days it was missing.
My friend is now afraid of giving the bird its liberty; and I suggest that a
large aviary be built for it somewhere in the garden.
It is jet black, with very clean neat black legs, the head is rather flat,
and there is not a white feather to be seen anywhere.
It is full of mischief, and steals everything it can lay hold of, and
then hides it and covers it all up with anything it can find. Can you give
me any suggestions as to treatment, etc. ? It prefers meat to anything else,
but nothing seems to come amiss.The plumage is glossy
blue-black, and the size about that of a full grown Rook now, though the
bird is quite young. I do not think it can be a Rook, but fancy it is a
young Raven. Mary Keene.
The following reply was sent to Mrs. Keene :
I understand from your letter that you are acquainted with the Rook.
If the bird be a trifle larger than a Rook, then doubtless it is a Crow ; but
if it be a good deal larger, with a long stout bill, then it is a Raven.

The Raven is such a fine bird that you cannot very well mistake it.
In the wild state, it keeps together in pairs, breeding usually in cliffs,
though occasionally in trees. It is still moderately common in some parts
of the coast where there are cliffs, but is, generally speaking, rare inland.
It will eat any living creature it is able to kill, and also feeds on dead crea-
tures, large insects, eggs, and almost anything that conies in its way. In
captivity it makes a splendid pet if allowed plenty of room, imitates almost
any sound that may take its fancy, and will learn to speak a few words
clearly. If the bird be young, now is the time to teach it. If it may not
be allowed to roam about, the larger the aviary you can make for it the
better; one part must be sheltered, and the rest open to the weather. A
few thick perches should be fixed about. It is very foud of washing. Feed
on mice, rats, young rabbits, sparrows, and scraps from the dinner table of
almost any kind, the greater the variety the better, and may include
cabbage, carrots, peas, etc. (not potatoes unless well mashed up with gravy),
and now and then a little fruit. Butcher's meat (raw) is very heating for a
bird, and is apt to cause it to pluck out its feathers. If it should shew any
tendancy to do this, at once put fluid magnesia in the drinking water and
give less meat. Fowls' heads, necks, etc., come in useful.
Some day if I can find the time, I will write the story of a Raven
which I had here for years.
The Carrion Crow is a fairly common bird, breeding freely wherever
there are plenty of woods and trees. It is wonderfully clever in selecting
spots where it is likely to be unmolested. Like the Raven, it keeps in
pairs, never going about in flocks like Rooks ; and in its habits generally
it is much like the Raven. When a lad I often kept young Crows, but they
are neither so clever nor so interesting as Ravens.
Rooks, although omnivorous, are more inclined to be insectivorous
and granivorous than either of the foregoing. Rooks congregate in flocks
all the year through ; and old Rooks have the space round the base of the
bill bare of feathers. Young Rooks and young Crows are much alike, but,
unless my memory plays me false, the young Crow is of a very dead black,
while the young Rook is glossy&apos;. Books tell us that young Rooks may be
distinguished from young Crows in two ways. Turn back the body feathers,
and the bases of the feathers in the Rook are grey, in the Crow white. The
inside of the mouth of the Crow is said to be of a pale flesh colour at all
ages, while that of a young Rook is said to be of a dark flesh colour, soon
turning livid, and becoming of a slate colour in the adult bird. The Jack-
daw may be distinguished in a moment by its light-blue eye.
The Raven nests early, and a young Raven ought by now (August) to
be considerably larger and more bulky than a Rook. Most of the young
Ravens met with in captivity in this country come from the continent.
During the coming winter and spring, carefully watch the small feathers on

the front of the bird's face, near the bill. If they drop ont, leaving the
skin bare, then it is a Rook. It will be very useful if you carefully watch
the process, noting particulars and dates, and report to us for publication,
as the exact manner in which a Rook gains its bare face is not certainly

known.
[The solitary nature of the Carrion Crow is well known, but it is not
so well known that, under certain conditions, the species will breed in
miniature colonies. When the attraction is only the collection of specially
suitable trees (in a wood) within a limited area, the nests will not be near
enough to one another to deserve the name. So far as I have myself seen,
the "colony" occurs only iu districts where the keeper is active, and
where, by some chance, a wood or portion of one escapes his unwelcome
attentions.
In a long out-lying wood at one time well known to me, and ever
sacred as the one in which I found my first Hobby's nest, in a corner of
immature oaks (it had been thinned ont a few years previously), with but
little covert of any kind, and a most unlikely place for Crows, and which
the keepers had almost given up in despair because of the distance and of
its close proximity to a hamlet of evil repute, I came oue year upon a
remarkable colony of Carrion Crows, quite a number of nests being herded
together, each one that I examined having its full complement of semi-
incubated eggs.--R. P.]

Sir, -- I noticed last year Lady Dunleath wrote you saying she had
bred and reared Spice Birds in her aviary which, I think, is the first
authentic notification of these birds breeding in captivity in England.
This year I have had three young ones of this species successfully&apos;
reared in my aviary. Many were the attempts the old birds made to nest,
but until this time they&apos; were unsuccessful. Either the Yellow Budgerigars
would wilfully destroy the nest, or the Golden Weavers would borrow the
nesting materials, and on one occasion a pair of Starlings purloined the
eggs. The last time not only did they deceive the other birds, but me also,
for I did not even know they were building. One day to my surprise, when
feeding, I saw the old birds flying about and feeding three young ones
which were nearly&apos; as large as their parents, and in perfect feather and tight
as wax. They are now feeding themselves, but are still iu nestling plumage,
which is of a uniform brown and, excepting for the white colour at the
junction of the upper and lower mandibles, might be taken for adult birds
of some other species.
The old birds have been in my&apos; outdoor aviary for about two years*

Sir, --During a stay of three weeks in Shropshire, on the borders of
Montgomeryshire, I had the satisfaction of seeing some rare birds, for
instance, a Green Woodpecker, a Heron, and a Jay, the last a very scarce bird
indeed in that part of the world. I also caught sight of a family party of
seven Goldfinches, the first I have seen wild for a longtime: they were
feeding on some thistles on a piece of waste land in the Welsh county.
Sparrows and Wood Pigeons were decidedly too numerous, the former
especially, and were doing an appreciable amount of damage to the corn
and other cereals. I also perceived a belated Cuckoo, and saw numerous
Swallows sitting on the telegraph wires, preparing for their departure to a
more genial clime, which was rather early for them to think of leaving us,
for some of them had young ones still in the nest, but the weather was so
inclement, one cannot wonder at their hurry. The Chaffinches had broken
up their family parties and I saw several flocks of the males, but the
females were conspicuous by their absence. Starlings were plentiful, so
were Yellowhammers, but I saw no Linnets, for there was little or no furze
coverts about. Pheasants were numerous, but backward, and many couples
(or is it brace ?) of Partridges appeared to be childless, while those with
families had not many young, the biggest covey I saw only consisted of
twelve birds, and many only numbered seven or eight. W. T. GrEENE.

Sir, --It may interest some of the readers of the Avicultural Maga-
zine to know that I have bred the Blackheaded Gouldian Finch in my out-
door aviary. The pair of birds were removed from an aviary they had
inhabited for three months, into another containing Redheaded and Black-
headed Goulds, White Java Sparrows, Parrot Finches, Cordon Bleus and
Grassfinclies on the 18th July, and on the 26th of the same month the first
egg was laid, and three young birds were hatched by the third week in
August. They are all remarkably strong and healthy birds, their backs
already colouring green, and the violet on the breast quite observable. Mr.
A. E. Nicholson states in his interesting letter of last month that the young
males of this species assume adult plumage when 14 months old, which
seems a long time, especially as my young birds (only 6 weeks old) already
begin to show colour on the body, the heads being still the same dull grey.
I may say that the old birds were remarkably tame while nesting, allowing
me to lift the cocoa-nut husk off the nail on which it hung, the bird still

remaining on the nest. I have now a pair of Redheaded Goulds nesting,
also a Cock Redhead and hen Blackhead with five eggs. I am anxiously
looking for results, but the cold nights are trying and the season far
advanced. I feed my birds on the best large Spanish canary, the small
Indian millet, spray millet, with plenty of cuttle-fish and fresh lettuce
daily. All the birds are in perfect health and feather, and, with the ex-
ception of four or five, sleep in the trees growing in the outside uncovered
portion of the aviary, and which is exposed to all weathers; they, however,
seem none the worse for the very frequent night soakings they must have
experienced this season. I notice that the White Javas always seek some
retreat or nest in the closed in portion of the aviary. Do these birds from
the Celestial region feel our climate more than their African and Australian
brothers?* My birds have made mail} 7 nests and laid main 1 eggs, but they
seem to lack the patience and persistency in sitting which characterize the
Goulds. I have always found them extremely hardy, and not so pugna-
cious as most of our naturalist books tell us; although I should not advise
any reader to keep them in a small cage with any weak or defenceless
birds. I have always found some difficulty in obtaining the pure White
Java, as nearly all those imported from China and Japan into this country
are foul-marked birds. The three birds I have, one is slightly spotted
the other two are pure white and very large birds. I should never hesitate
to recommend them to anj&apos; amateur who wishes to keep a pair of birds
as pets in a small cage, for they are very tameable, have a pretty, liquid
song, and a handsome appearance.
My Grassfinches have not been successful this year, for, although
having several nests of eggs, no young birds have been reared.
A pair of Fire Finches nested in a small rush basket; four eggs were
laid, but no results.
Will not a few more members give us their experiences this year, on
the nesting and rearing of their birds in outdoor aviaries?

cock was successfully raised. He had left the uest only a few days before a
second nest was built, and very soon the lieu was sitting again on three or
four eggs. I say " the hen " because with Green Cardinals the work of
incubation is left entirely to her. Of these, two were hatched, and the
young grew rapidly, needing many mealworms and cabbage caterpillars to
satisfy their enormous appetites. They were about five or six days old
when I noticed the child--as we called the young cock--standing on the
edge of the nest with a mealworm in his beak, and calling to the young just
as the parents did: a large mouth opened wide, and the mealworm was
dropped in. After this I frequently saw him feeding them, and the parent
birds would stand aside, if on the nest, to let him come and give his worm
or caterpillar.
Mr. Green, of Bournemouth, called one day and saw this done. He
was much interested, and said he could scarcely have believed it had he
not seen it.
At that time the child could not have been more than from six weeks
to two months old, and I think it was a very beautiful instance of un-
selfishness in a little bird He thoroughly enjoyed a mealworm or cabbage
caterpillar himself, yet never thought of taking one until the young were
satisfied. M. D. Sharp.
JARDINE'S PARROT.
Pceocephalus gulielmi.
Sir,-- Do you think it advisable to let a Parrot brood a hen's egg ?
I have a Jardine's Parrot which laid an egg some time ago, and which I took
away. Now, my man has given it a hen's egg, and it is brooding it in the
bottom of the cage, where it has got a lot of chips of wood together, and
sits on it. I am afraid it may exhaust it, all the more so as it has got into
the habit of picking its breast bare for some two years past.
The cage is a large waggon-shaped one, about 5 feet high, 3J feet
deep, and 4^ feet wide. The bird was brought some nine years ago from
St. Paul de Loanda on the West Coast of Africa. It talks German in a
mumbling sort of way, but says very distinctly "Jacob." It would be a
very handsome bird were it not for its breast and back being picked bare
of feathers. I saw two very good specimens at the Amsterdam Zoo., and
Jamrach had two about two years ago. I shall write to him for another, as
perhaps having a companion might wean it from its habit. It is a very
tame and affectionate bird, dances on its perch when it sees me, and gives a
postman's knock against the wires or any sort of wood within its reach. It
will not touch boiled maize, but prefers hemp seed and sunflower seed to
any other. It has also half an apple every day, and now and then a dry
biscuit and cherries, and green peas in the pod, but it does not seem very
fond of grapes nor yet of dried figs.

Correspondence.
My sister-in-law, who gave me the bird, as she thought in a very
large cage or loose in a bird-100111 it might get rid of the habit of feather
picking, wrote me the other day from German}'that a friend of hers had
cured two Grey Parrots of feather eating by feeding them on crusts of
bread soaked in water, and strongly advised me to keep the bird on that
diet to try whether it had any effect. I have powdered it with toilet
powder and Fuller's earth powder. The bird rather likes it, but very
strongly objects to lanoline cream or other similar preparation with which
I have rubbed the bare spots. I will put a little magnesia into its drinking
water, and hope a beneficial result will follow.
Yon did not say what seed to give the Parrot, but I expect you meant
maize and canary. At present I am giving it green peas in the pod and also
cherries, but it certainly does not care for the latter nor yet for any other
fruit excepting apples, which are regularly supplied. My Salvin's Amazon
is fond of carrot, but Jardine's will not take to it.
August 19th, 1902.--I am sending you two eggs my Gulielmi laid
lately. What a pity I have not a cock bird ! It still pecks itself bare,
although I apply lanoline every day, and have also powdered it with a very
cooling powder. I have given it a great quantity of peas, both in the pod and
otherwise. The eggs were laid in a box which I put into the cage to be
bitten to pieces. Noticing the bird sitting as if brooding I took her out,
and lo! there were two eggs.(August 22nd)--Herewith another egg
he Jardinelaid this morning. The colour of her eye is brown.
F. MOERSCHEUv.
The following are a feiv of the hints suggested to Mr. Moerschell:
If I may venture to advise you, I should strongly recommend that
you take away the egg, nest, and everything appertaining thereto; nay, if
it be practicable, put the Parrot into a strange cage, so as to divert her
thoughts as much as possible. The sitting on the nest increases the fever
of the body and the consequent irritation of the skin. Put fluid magnesia
into the drinking water, and give fruit, so as to cool the blood.
Hemp seed is bad, as regards feather picking, and sunflower is
nearly as bad. Nothing under the sun will do any good unless you stop the
hemp and moderate the sunflower. I should banish them both. The bird
cannot be fed too simply. Let it have canary, oats, a little plain fruit (not
stone fruit), and green food, with occasional doses (in the drinking water) of
fluid magnesia and fluid extract of taraxacum. I am doubtful about the
lanoline, unless mixed with quassia or something bitter. It might acquire
a taste for the lauoline by itself.
Of the two eggs sent to me on the 19th of August, one was smashed
in the post. The other is a very round blunt egg, x-5/i6ths inch long by
i-2/i6ths inch broad. The third, laid on the 22nd, is oval, i-5/i6ths inch
long by one inch broad.

[The colour of the eye is interesting. Dr. Greene (Parrots in Captivity,
Vol. III., p. 85) tells us: "The female cannot be distinguished by her
outward appearance from her mate; but as some of these birds have brown
eyes, and others have the irides of a bright orange-red colour, it is possible
that the latter may be the females; and perhaps the young of both sexes
may take after their mothers in this respect; in which case the eyes of the
young males would become dark as they&apos; reached maturity, and those of
the females retain the lighter shade."
Some nine years ago I received a letter concerning a reputed pair of
these birds, in which I find the following passage : " These birds I should
say are a pair, the irides of the one being orange-red, of the other brown.
One has also more scarlet upon the head than the other though I think
both are adult."
I11 the Museum Catalogue (Vol. XX., p. 366), the colour of the iris of
the adult is given as light brown.
The evidence is insufficient to enable us to arrive at a couclusion.
So far as it goes, it might appear that the eye of the immature bird is
orange-red, that of the adult of either sex brown, and, therefore, that the
species cannot be sexed by the colour of the eye. Perhaps some of our
readers will state their experiences on this point.--R. P.]

WINTERING FOREIGN FINCHES OUT-OF-DOORS.

The following advice has been sent to Mrs. Sherston in reply to a query :
Although some of our members have shown that the more delicate
African Finches can be wintered out-of-doors, and although I have myself
known some of them to live through a good many degrees of frost, I
nevertheless think it exceedingly&apos; risky to subject the more thinly&apos; feathered
African Waxbills to extreme cold.
I should certainly recommend that Orange-cheeked and St. Helena
Waxbills should be brought indoors for the winter; but St. Helena Seed-
eaters would probably not suffer from cold, the Serins as a genus being
naturally rather hardy.
I should not be afraid of Ribbon-finches suffering from cold, provided
that they did not attempt to breed in the winter. From my own experience
with them I should fear they would begin this month (September), and
continue throughout the winter, if nest-boxes were available.
Virginian Cardinals are better out-of-doors than in; all I ever had
(five) died from lieat-apoplexy, although one of these was kept in an
outdoor aviary.

THE SECRETARY AND THE SOCIETY'S MEDAL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993003476190476" page_id="10284119"  page_num="Page 42" year="" vol="">
In the last number of this journal we published a new Rule in con-
nection with the Society's Medal, which had been carefully considered and
passed by the Executive Committee of the Council. (See page 305). We
did not expect any of our members to object to such a rule, and were
surprised to receive a letter from the Rev. C. D. Farrar, protesting strongly
against it, and asking if it had been passed by the Committee or was
merely the work of the Hon. Secretary. To this we replied that the Rule
was passed by the whole of the Executive Committee, and that we
considered it a perfectly fair and necessary rule. We have received the
following letter in reply to this, which, not being marked private, there can
be no objection to our publishing. We publish also a reply from the Hon.
Secretary.
We may say that we strongly object to Mr. Farrar's attitude in this
matter, and if the Society's Medal is going to cause ill-feeling amongst our
members we shall consider it our duty to put before the Council the advis-
ability of discontinuing to award a Medal at all, though this would be a
pity.-- Editor.
Micklefield Vicarage , Leeds, Oct. 18th, iqo2.
Sir, --Thanks for your letter of to-day. I do not consider that the
Executive have any right to make rules apart from the rest of the Council.
It seems to me that the Executive now does just as it pleases, and it puzzles
me and a good many more to know what good the rest of the Council are.
I am a member of the Council, but I am never consulted on any
single point. I was once summoned to a meeting in London, and that is
all. I feel very sore, indeed, on the way the affairs of the Society are
conducted. It seems to me that the Council are mere dummies, with three
exceptions.
With regard to the Sydney Waxbills, I do not see why Mr. Gedney is
not to be believed quite as much as Mr. Wiener; for example, Mr. Phillipps
refused me a Medal because he said Mr. Wiener said he had bred them--
Malabar Mynahs; also I was denied a Medal for breeding Dhyals, because
Mr. Phillipps said the Zoo had bred them. Would anyone believe, who
knows anything, that the Zoo could rear such birds as Dhyals ! and yet I
had to sit down under Mr. Phillipps' dictum ! I think what is sauce for
the goose is sauce for the gander, and I for one, consider that, unless dis-
proved, Mr. Gedney should be believed as much as Mr. Wiener or the Zoo.
Also I think that it would be more satisfactory to members if some-
body saw the birds alleged to be raised. I always bring witnesses; why not
others? It hardly seems right that a man should award a Medal to himself.
With regard to the new rule, I can see nothing unfair if a friend likes
to lend you a pair of birds to breed off, on the strength of your skill. After
all, the object is to breed a new species; not to enquire to whom the old

birds belong. Your argument cuts both ways. Suppose you are a very
rich man and I am only a poor one, it is most unfair that you should be able
to buy birds that I cannot afford to and so get a Medal.
After all, the new Rule is only the outcome of petty spite and
jealousy.
Yours faithfully,
C. D. Farrar.
Sir, --In the two letters which yon kindly forwarded for my
inspection, the Rev. C. D. Farrar brings certain charges against me as
Secretary ; and it seems desirable that his inaccurate statements should be
publicly refuted.
Referring to the new Medal Rule which was published on p. 305 of
our last number, Mr. Farrar (I am writing from memory, having returned
this letter to you) accuses vie of having imposed the Rule on the Society
and says that it is scandalous that one man should be allowed to do this and
that, and much more to the same effect. The Rule was passed by the
Executive Committee; even the thought of it did not originate with me,
though I fully approve of it, and, after reading Mr. Farrar's letters, see the
necessity for it.
Mr. Farrar objects to a Medal being awarded me for having bred the
Australian Waxbill. He is quite at liberty to object, but his offensive
manner of doing so is inexcusable. He founds his objection on Mr.
Gedney's statement that these Waxbills " have been bred by every one who
has tried the experiment, but all the instances recorded have occurred
where the birds were bred in rooms, and as my own experiences are limited
to similar conditions " etc. etc. Nowall the "recorded" instances are the
partially successful ones of Dr. Russ in Germany, to which I referred at
p. 290. If Mr. Gedney's "own experiences" had been only partially
successful, he would most certainly have referred to the plumage of the
young birds. He does not state that he bred the species.
Mr. Farrar writes,--" Mr. Phillipps refused me a Medal because he
said Mr. Wiener said he had bred them (Malabar Mynah); also I was denied
a Medal for breeding Dliyals because Mr. Phillipps said the Zoo had bred
theni. Would any one believe, who knows anything, that the Zoo could
RKAR such birds as Dliyals? and yet I had to sit down under Mr. Phillipps'
dictum ! "
On these two occasions I was not Secretary. Why then is my name
brought forward any more than that of any other member of the Execu-
tive ? I do not remember about the Malabar Mynah, but I observe that,
after some years of failure, Mr. Wiener did eventually succeed in rearing
a brood of three. But what has that to do with Mr. Phillipps ! ! ! And
what does Mr. Farrar mean by his expression, relative to the Dhyals, "Mr.
Phillipps said the Zoo had bred them ! " In the Zoological Society's

Correspondence.
"List," at p. 213 of the Eighth Edition, it is recorded by the Society, not
by Mr. Phillipps, that two were "Hatched in the Gardens, May 23, 1873.
(First time of breeding)." I was told, rightly or wrongly, that one of these
two was reared. Of course it would have been my duty, as a Member of
the Executive Committee, to bring this under notice, or, if I did not,
somebod}&apos; else did. But my chief objection to a Medal being awarded off
hand, as the then Secretary seemed about to do, was because it was doubt-
ful, from Mr. Farrar&apos;s own account (Vol V., p. 145), whether he did rear the
young birds to be independent of their parents as required by the Rule.
The young (two) were killed by the cock on the floor. Judging by the
Shama, Mr. Farrar had by no means been fully successful, and therefore,
irrespective of the Zoo, had not qualified himself to be a recipient of a
Medal !
Mr. Farrar goes on : "I think it would be more satisfactory to
Members if somebody saw the birds ' alleged ' to be raised. I always bring
witnesses; why should not others? It hardly seems right that a man
should award a Medal to himself." The last clause seems to indicate that
this is intended especially for me,--doubtless because in the past, and
especially some weeks back, I resisted Mr. Farrar's defiant evasions of the
Medal Rules and disregard for them. And what is more, let me tell him
that I will continue to do my duty and uphold the Medal Rules in spite of
his offensive suggestions. So far as my young birds are concerned, they
have been seen by several Members , the young Wren (in the house) by quite
a number, for during the past summer my birds have been visited by many
Members. Mr. Farrar says "I always bring witnesses." Does he? He
has but a poor opinion of some of our memories. And there is one point
which Mr. Farrar regularly avoids--witnesses, or even a definite statement,
that his young birds have been fully reared as required by the Rules.
On what authority does Mr. Farrar accuse me of awarding a Medal
to myself? Will he oblige me by stating when I ever did such a thing ?
I11 every case I make preliminary enquiries of the Members of the Execu-
tive before it is stated in the Magazine that a Medal is " proposed." After
the publication, I send a Circular Letter to the Members of the Executive,
asking the direct question whether it is their will that a Medal be awarded,
and each Member of the Executive gives a written reply. Of course, like
almost every thing else, I have to start the machinery and carry the
business through, but it is the Executive, not I, who award the Medals.
And yet Mr. Farrar accuses me of awarding a Medal to myself!
A day or two before I saw Mr. F&apos;arrar's second letter, I had started off
my usual Circular to my colleagues asking if it was their wish that a
Medal should be awarded in the four cases "proposed" last month; and
I especially referred to Mr. Farrar's objection (first letter) in the case of the
Waxbill. Whether they will award a Medal for the Wren and for the

Waxbill I cannot say, but I can say that, as a protest against Mr. Farrar's
continuous objectionable remarks (which now we never fail to delete from
the proof sheets) concerning other Members of the Society, who toiled in
the dark and laboured at aviculture years and years before he was ever
heard of, and the fruits of whose labours he now reaps, I decline to take a
Medal for either the Wren or the Waxbill, whether awarded or not. I do
not keep my birds for Medals. The pleasure in watching the friendly little
Waxbills and the timid and fragile little Wren, and Mr. Gronvold's
exquisite painting of the latter and its parents, are better to me than any
number of Medals. Reginald PhillippS.

Sir, --May I have a short space to answer one sentence of Dr. Salt's
letter, viz., the one referring to the covers going the way of all covers to
the w.p.b. as waste. No bookbinder who understood his art would do such
a thing in binding the Avicultural Magazine, but would on the contrary
carefully preserve them and bind them in at the end of the perfect
pagination. Ail}' binder who did otherwise with my numbers would have
the volume returned, with a request for fresh copies bound in a proper
manner, as indeed I had to once.
As a bibliopliilist, as well as an aviculturist, I do not see why an
engraved cover should get roughened and dirty, except by improper and
careless treatment. My books, and those of any book lover, are kept in
"mint" condition.
Whilst agreeing that the interior could be improved, for nothing is
perfect, I would ask Dr. Salt to compare the volume just ended with any
earlier one he likes to take, and make a comparison both as regards literary
matter and illustrations.
One who would cavil at an engraved cover afterwards, must indeed
be hard to please. P. Wellington Farmborough.

By the Rev. Hubert D. Astley, M.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Even if somewhat broken down in health, the enthusiastic
cage-bird lover, unless confined to his bed, is always on the look
out for something new, especially if he or she find themselves in
a new country.
And so it happened that my search for new health and
new birds seemed to go hand in hand on my arrival at Santa
Cruz, the port of the far-famed Island of Teneriffe, in the last
days of 1901.
It was more amongst birds dropped by the coaling vessels,
the merchant ships, etc., that I hoped to find something new,
than among the wild birds indigenous to the Island.
Santa Cruz, pronounced, in correct Spanish, " Santa
Crooth," is a halting spot for multitudinous ships, plying from
England, Spain, Italy, etc: to Africa and America, and vice
versa ; so that we may find on board these vessels birds from
Mogador and the West Coast of Africa, birds from South Africa,
and more especially from South America.
Going to the Canary Islands, I certainly did expect to see
Canaries. Nor was I deceived in my expectation, though I did
believe the Canary Islands could exist without the birds ; unlike
a certain lady who gravely supposed that the latter had given
their name to the former, which would be equivalent to thinking
that Queen Victoria had been named after Victoria Park. But
Canaries, real genuine wild ones, there certainly are.

Rev. Hubert D. Astley,
In Santa Cruz it is a common cage-bird, and on driving
out of the town, it very soon makes itself either heard or seen in
a state of natural freedom. At first sight, a flock of these birds
might be mistaken for a flock of Linnets when flitting from tree
to tree, or gathering together on the rocky ground, picking up
stray seeds of various plants.
In January and February, some of the Canaries have
already paired off on the lower ground of the Island, whilst
hundreds of others are still in large or small flocks ; and a very
pretty sight and sound it is to see perhaps hundreds of these
little greenish-grey birds sitting on the still bare stems of a large
fig-tree amongst the wild desert-like ground, bestrewn with tufa
and lava, and to hear probably twenty male birds all twittering
and singing together, whilst others give vent to many a ' tweet,'
bringing back nursery days and one's first cage-pet.
Turned towards the sun, the males are easily recognisable
by the bright touches of yellow on their breasts. And whilst
this wintry scene of gathered birds is going on, many pairs have
stolen away from that tuneful concourse (which makes one think
one is in close proximity to a vast aviary, or Canary-breeding
establishment), and already in January are building a compact
nest of moss and interwoven grass and lining of feathers,
perhaps amongst the top branches of an orange-tree in some
garden.
The scene is wintry only because of that flocking together
and assembled concourse of fluttering wings, and in no other
way, for the usual January temperature, which month in Teneriffe
pretends to call itself a winter one, is somewhere about 6o* ; and
even stuffy people are glad to keep their windows open at night.
So much for the Wild Canary! "and where does the
Hooded Siskin come ? " Not until the 3rd Act. He delays his
appearance like a great actor or Prima Donna. The scene of
Act ii. is laid in a greengrocer's shop in Santa Cruz--a green-
grocer who appears to be the only person there publicly calling
himself at the same time a bird dealer. When his vegetables
run out and perhaps his fruit, then he turns an honest piastre,
or otherwise, by the birds.

It's dirty there in that off street ; it savours at the very
least of rotten cabbages, and there's nothing much worse, but
the oranges and bananas, piled amongst the vegetables on either
side of the steps leading up into the big shop, are fresh and
good. The shop when one enters is like a large scullery, or bare
kitchen, bare except for fifteen or sixteen cages hanging on the
walls.
In some there are yellow Canaries (which are not wild !)
commencing to build, some indeed are already sitting. Then,
in larger cages again, there are fluttering jumbles of West
African birds, Fire - finches, Lavender - finches, Weavers and
Whydahs, and also a Combassou or two.
But it is to three birds in three smaller cages that I am
chiefly attracted, after having ascertained that amongst the West
Africans there is nothing but what one can see any day in
London. Are they Canaries, these three? A variety or species
of Wild Canary that I have never seen ? or has the Santa Cruz
greengrocer been feeding the ordinary Wild Canaries on cayenne,
or has he been dipping their bodies in saffron dye, or have the
last rays of the setting-sun caught them to leave this golden-
orange tint all over. " What bird is this ? " I ask. " Mr.
Canaria," is the answer! Is the man laughing at the Senor
Ingles or is this his way of informing me that it is a Canary of
the male sex ?
Then, through an interpreter, I gather that it is 'Mista'
or mixed; in other words a hybrid Canary. " Mixed with
what?" "A Cardinal." "A Cardinal? Surely not!" For
the birds look like Wild Canaries in form and size and carriage,
and indeed in voice too ; the ' sweet ' of the Canary is unmistak-
able.
But I am assured---''Si, si, Cardenal ; a misto Cardenal."
" Yes ! yes! a Cardinal." " What colour is the Cardinal ? " I ask.
" Red, all red, and a little black." Can he mean a Virginian
Nightingale, a Red Cardinal ? It would seem so.
I purchase one of these 'Mista Canaria'; I might go
further and say one of these mysterious Canaries, with a deter-
mination to find out the father.

On the Hooded Siskin.
The mother is a Wild Canary. And so the curtain drops
on Act ii., with much debate between the scenes, as to what
Act iii. will divulge.
Between the 2nd and 3rd Acts, a day elapses (as they write
on the play bills).
It was on the following day, as I was driving down one of
the principal streets of Santa Cruz, that I caught a passing
glimpse of a brilliant little bird in a cage which was hanging
outside a bootmaker's shop : and I knew that Act iii. had begun.
Just a flash of flame colour, or that of a good orange nasturtium.
" Stop," I shouted, " Stop." " El pajaro." " The bird " : it was
the first Spanish word I had studiously committed to memory.
It was rather a case of " spit it out," for the * j ' in Spanish
sounds somewhat like the ' ch ' of a Scottish ' loch.' " Que
pajaro es este ? " I stuttered, wildly turning over the pages of a
conversation book. "Cardenal," was the reply.
Enter the hero ! amidst loud applause.
The owner was an ancient person, as ancient as the bird;
for all that, I tried to purchase the latter, but met with a quite
definite refusal; not departing however before I had discovered
that this was actually the species that is mated with the Canaiy,
producing the ' Mista Canaria.'
I at once commissioned the Manager of the hotel where I
was staying to try to procure me one, and some two or three
weeks afterwards the brilliant little bird, whose portrait I have
tried to paint, appeared at Giiimar, a small town on the S.E. of
Ter.eriffe, where I was staying. The same day of his arrival he
sang gaily, and has done so ever since up to the moment of
writing this in September.
O11 studying him at closer and more intimate quarters, I
came to the conclusion he must be certainly allied closely either
to a Siskin or a Goldfinch. His movements and song resemble
both, and his general characteristics. A most charming gay
little bird, about the same size as his portrait, if not exaetty the
same. These ' Cardenals,' as the people of Teneriffe call them,

There was a 4th Act ! an Act in which Mr. Phillipps was
stage-manager. I roughly painted a sketch of my bird, sent it
to him, and received a reply that it is undoubtedly a Hooded
Siskin of Venezuela and Caracas.* The bird is a male (a Mr.!),
and it would seem that the females are not imported, and are of
much duller tints. Why this species has not been carried on in
some of the ships to England is curious. That it is not, would
seem to be the case, for I never saw one in any London bird-
dealer's shop, which fact Mr. Phillipps corroborates.
In Santa Cruz it is thought much of.
THE SPOTTED-WING.
Psaroglossa spiloptera.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
Towards the end of July of the present year I received a
letter from our Member, Mr. E. W. Harper, in which he said--
" I have a Spotted-wing (Psaroglossa spiloptera) which I wish to
give away to a good home. As the species is not common in
this country, it occurred to me that you may not perhaps have
kept the bird. If you would like the Spotted-wing, I shall be
delighted to send it for your acceptance."
Naturally I replied that I had always been interested in
the various birds of the Starling group, and should be delighted
to have it. I11 a letter, informing me that he was sending off the
bird, Mr. Harper informed me that he considered the affinity of
Psaroglossa to the Starlings very doubtful ; as it was a hopping
bird and did not use its mandibles as dividers after the manner
of Starlings.
The bird reached me on August 1st, and the food in its
cage gave me a good idea as to the proper method of feeding it:
I turned it into a flight-cage, supplied it with my usual soft-food

Dr. A. G. Butler,
mixture, half an orange, a few grapes, and one or two meal-
worms. The bird seemed weak ; and, until it had taken a bath,
was unable to fly up to the lower perch (perhaps 18 inches from
the sand-tray), later it managed this feat, aud thence easily flew
to the upper perch on the opposite side of the cage.
Watching this interesting bird, I quickly came to the same
conclusion as Mr. Harper; the bird's actions were, in every
respect, those of a Bulbul rather than a Starling; it moved even
on its perches by (lateral) hops : when eating it pierced the fruit
with slightly opened mandibles, the tongue exserted and then
retracted ; the bill closing upon the enclosed fragment of fruit,
then withdrawn and almost immediately plunged in again for
the next mouthful. This action is exactly opposite to that of a
Starling, which always pierces with closed bill, then opens the
mandibles to divide the food and afterwards picks up the small
fragment separated from the bulk of its food. The habit of
dividing up fruit, or tough portions of food, such as pips, bread
or biscuit, is characteristic not only of the Sturnidce but of the
Icteridce .
Another Starling - like characteristic which is wholly
wanting in the Spotted-wing, is the apparently aimless and
undecided way in which the Sturnidce and Ideridce usually
approach their food, trotting backwards and forwards, perhaps
two or three times, round the saucer before making up their
minds as to what they will begin upon : Psaroglossa always flew
straight to one side of its food-vessel and started feeding at
once : it did not eat a great deal of the soft mixture, but every
scrap of fruit, excepting banana, which I supplied. Occasionally
it would eat banana, but not if there was plenty of other fruit
handy. When ripe oranges failed and I had to substitute pear,
it fought shy of the latter for one day ; but, on the following
day, when I cut a ripe pear through the middle so as to show the
pips, it cleared out this fruit to the skin and never subsequently
failed to eat all that was given to it.
Watching this bird as I did, I was distressed to notice that
it did not appear to grow stronger, in spite of the amount of food
which it consumed. As I knew the value of spiders as a pick-

me-up for insectivorous birds and other soft - food eaters, * I
gave it not only specimens of Epeira and Agelena, the two forms
of spider most readily obtained, but several green caterpillars ;
but in spite of all it grew weaker until it could hardly reach its
perch, often failing in its first attempt; its wings drooped more
and more, it failed to replace a few small feathers missing from
the back of its crown, and at length, to my horror I came down
on September 25th to find it lying with its feet up across the top
of its drinking-pan, dead as Queen Anne.
Early in the mouth I had written to my friend and late
colleague in the Natural History Museum, Dr. R. Bowdler
Sharpe, telling him of Mr. Harper's kind present and of the
conclusion which he and I had come to, after observing the
bird's habits, that it had been incorrectly referred to the
Starlings. Dr. Sharpe replied--" My dear Butler: If the Psaro-
glossa dies, please let me have it for Pycraft to find out its natural
position. The first evening I can spare, I must come down and
see it. Oates considers it a kind of Babbling Thrush." When
it died, therefore, I sent the bird off without delay to Dr. Sharpe.
It will be interesting to see what he discovers from its anatomy.
To my amateur, if somewhat artistic eye, the form of the bill
suggests a Bulbul rather than a Starling and it is satisfactory to
know that experienced ornithologists regard the bird as probably
one of the Babbling Thrushes.
As regards its habits. Dr. Jerdon, who called the bird
" The Spotted-winged Stare," remarks as follows :--" This bird
is found only in the Western and Central Himalayas. It is not
known in Sikliim. It frequents the valleys about Simla and
Mussooree, up to 6,000 feet, lives in small flocks of five or six;
its note and flight, says Hutton, " are very much like those of
Sturnus vulgaris, and it delights to perch on the very summit of
the forest trees. I have never seen it on the ground, and its
food consists of berries. It nidificates in the holes of trees,
lining the cavity with bits of leaves cut by itself; the eggs are
usually three to five, of a delicate pale sea green, speckled with
blood-like stains, which sometimes tend to form a ring near the
* In August I saved the life of one of my Scarlet Tanagers and restored it to per-
fect health by giving it plenty of spiders and a few mealworms.--A. G. B.

Mr. J. L. Bonhote,
larger end. Dr. Adams says that it frequents rice fields, or the
sides of mountain streams, and that it is shy and timid."
The above account indicates some features in common
with Starlings : the voice is harsh and abrupt, not strikingly
resembling that of Sturnvs vulgaris to my ear, rather one might
say it resembles the scolding note of the Crested Mynah,--a
sound most irritating to me from its parrot-like raspiness. As
for the flight, I had no opportunity to observe it in a cage, but
that of Sturnus vulgaris , which always reminds me of that
unambitious rhyme "Twinkle, twinkle, little star": etc., is so
distinctive, that it would be difficult to suppose that Mr Hutton
could have erred respecting it.
The colouring of the eggs seems to separate Psaroglossa
from the typical Starlings; and I should judge (from their
marked character) that although this bird may nest in holes in
trees, they must be very shallow holes; and not such as Sturnus
V7ilgaris selects for its unmarked eggs.
Take it all round, I think there is, at present, very little
evidence for the Sturnine affinities of Psaroglossa ; but I suppose
dissection will throw a clearer light upon this question.
So far as I have been able to ascertain, the Spotted-wing
has never found its way to our Zoological Gardens; and Dr.
Russ does not mention it in his latest work on soft-food cage-
birds.

Part III.
The next type of country into which I would ask the reader
to follow me is one which is frequently met with in these islands,
viz., the swamps and lagoons, where may be found many of the
most beautiful and interesting species of birds. The countr)&apos;&apos; is
somewhat peculiar, so I may perhaps be excused if I dilate a
little upon it before treating of its inhabitants. The Bahamas,
as we noticed before, are essentially different in their formation
from the other West Indian Islands, being formed, according to

Professor Agassiz, of wind and waved-tossed coral sand, which,
having been left high and dry by the action of the tides and
currents on the shallow banks, has been converted into solid
rock. Owing to this formation, there is no high land in the
group, and a considerable portion of many of the islands lies
below the level of the sea. In most cases there is a seaward
ridge, which shuts out the sea altogether. In other cases a
subterranean passage exists, so that large tracts of country are
converted into lakes that rise and fall with the tide, leaving a
rich feast along their banks for many species of birds ; finally in
other cases breaks occur in the ridge, forming narrow channels or
creeks, which open out, behind this barrier, into large branching
and shallow lagoons, so that the whole country for miles round
becomes a mere mass of scattered islands, and enormous tracts
of swamp are laid bare with each tide. Along some of these
lagoons a boat can go, but, as the} 7 are for the most part entirely
unexplored, one is very liable to be stranded by the falling tide ;
the most satisfactory way of getting about is to wade, there being
but few places where the water is more than thirty inches deep and
as an average it would barely exceed six inches. The bottom
consists of rough rock, covered with weed or mud, and though
the walking is of the worst, it is not treacherous. The adapta-
bility of plants to their localities is nowhere better exemplified
than in these islands. Were the rock and soil that is found there
to be brought over to this country, I doubt if even our hardiest
seeds would succeed in establishing themselves. In that country,
however, it is different, and wherever land is found sufficiently
elevated to be beyond the reach of the high tides and heavy
floods, there the luxurious coppet flourishes. At a lower eleva-
tion (we are only dealing with elevations of inches ! ! !) in country
flooded by the heavy rains of the wet season we find a thick tangle
of coarse grass and palmetto, the latter a most useful tree,
without which the explorer in these parts might fare badly, for it
formed, on occasions, our shelter, bed, fan, tinder, string, etc.,
and the number of uses to which the natives can put it is
practically unlimited. Lastly, in those places which are covered
every tide, grows the universal mangrove, stretching out often
for a mile or more in an unbroken even line about two feet high,

its horizontal roots lacing and intertwining in all directions,
while at other times it rises up in large clumps some twenty or
thirty feet high, forming islands in the centre of the lagoons.
Such, then, is the general aspect of the country, and, I trust that
I have not tried the reader's patience ; but, in my opinion, an
idea of the country in which a bird lives is as essential for a
proper appreciation of its actions as a description of the habits
themselves.
I well remember my first landing in this country of
lagoons ; it was towards evening, and, after crossing the beach
and the ridge, I came upon a large lagoon. There were not
many birds to be seen ; a few Grey Plover were piping round
about, and on the beach, which I had left, a small flock
of Turnstones were following the receding tide. Except for
these, there was little life, but across the lagoon, in the
distance, I saw a large white bird, and, by the aid of my glasses,
made it out to be a White Heron. Unless one has seen them it is
impossible to convey in words the beauty and grace of the White
Egrets in their native wilds, where, standing out white against
the dark green background, they can be seen and watched at a
distance of many hundred yards as they slowly walk along the
edge of the water, now darting out their long necks with
unerring aim at some passing insect or fish, now standing stiff
and erect while looking with curiosity at the unusual sight of a
human form. Sometimes, without apparent reason, one of them
would jump in the air, race along for a short distance, and
stopping suddenly, flap his wings at the same time so that he
appeared to be dancing and full of exuberant spirits at being
alive. When in pairs this dance was frequently carried on, so that
it is evidently a courting measure, and, during its progress, the
gorgeous Egret plumes would be erected and shown off. I
venture to think that if those ladies (and I sincerely hope there
are none in our Society) who wear the batches of Egret plumes
in their hats, were to see the true display of these birds, they
would appreciate the impotence of man to show off the beauties
of nature, and, let us hope, give up the attempt. Many charming
ornithological pictures recur to my mind while writing these
articles, but none (not even excepting the gorgeous Flamingoes)

give me more pleasure than those of the White Egrets sporting
about with that fearlessness of man who is threatening their
extinction.
The bird, whose actions I have so feebly portrayed, is not
the bird from whom the elongated plumes are generally
procured, but a nearly allied species, the Reddish Egret (Ardea
T 7 tfa). The true Reddish Egret is a bluish bird with a chocolate
coloured neck, and the white specimens were for a long time
supposed to be the young, but as both forms have since been
obtained in the adult, as well as the young, plumage they are
either varieties of one species or two closely allied species.
Several other Herons were met with in these lagoons, but
none so tame and confiding as the above. Of these the
commonest was perhaps the Violet - crowned Night Heron
(.Nyctiardea violaceus), whose harsh scream was frequently to be
heard at dusk. Although very beautiful, it can hardly be styled
an interesting bird, and spends most of the day among the
thickest cover, generally mangroves, wandering abroad
towards evening. It is rather more partial to the sea shore than
the other Herons, where it feeds chiefly on crabs, and is often
shot by moonlight by the natives, who esteem it for food. Never
having summed up courage to try it, I cannot speak of it as an
article of food from personal experience, but I should imagine
the flavour to be very strong. The nest is built low down on a
mangrove, a small isolated bush being generally chosen, round
which, before the eggs are laid, the birds may usually be found.
It is sometimes stupidly tame, hardly realizing one's approach,
or expecting, by remaining motionless, to escape notice, and so
still do they remain, that on one occasion I was enabled to fulfil
the proverb of catching one by the application of salt to its tail,
or rather my hand on its legs, which latter method seemed to me
the more efficacious.
The little Green Heron (A. bahamensis) is a charming and
common species, of which the Bahama form is quite distinct
from that found on the mainland. Abundant everywhere, it was
always to be seen darting out of some mangrove bush as one
disturbed it, or wandering along the shore recently left by the

Mr. J. L. Bonhote,
tide. In this last place it looked more like a Rail than a Heron,
and if not too suddenly disturbed it would run to the nearest
shelter with its neck held low in front, and as soon as some
sheltered spot was gained, often under the shadow of some rock,
it would draw in its neck, and, bunching itself up, remain
motionless. When among trees its method of concealment was
precisely the reverse, and instead of bunching itself up in a dark
shapeless mass, it would stretch upwards to its full extent,
becoming as thin and long as possible and appearing like a
branch of the tree itself
The Great Blue Heron ( A. herodias ) is also numerous
throughout the islands, but is without exception the wariest bird
I ever met with. Most of the individuals seenare immature, and
I doubt if it breeds nearer than Florida. Another fairly numerous
species, especially in summer, is the Louisiana Heron ( A . Uicoloi &apos;).
This is a small bird of most graceful flight, and nothing can
exceed the delicate beauty of its breeding plumage ; the whole
colour of the neck and upperparts is a delicate blue, the longer
Egret plumes having a tendency to pale rufous, as have also the
elongated feathers at the base cxf the neck. The chin is white,
shading into rusty, and forming a uarow stripe down the neck.
The crest is short, being only about three inches long ; in colour
it is white, each feather having a rusty tip. The whole of the
underparts are of a perfectly pure immaculate white. When alive
all the blue portions are tinged with a delicate plum-like bloom
which adds a handsome finish to the graceful beauty of the bird.
In this species the bare skin in front of the eye, yellow at other
times, is, during the breeding season, bright ultramarine blue, and
the bill itself is deeply tinged with the same colour, causing the
bird to be erroneously described as new some years back under the
name of A. cyanirostris . The blue colour (present only during the
breeding season) in the skin of this and several other species,
eg., the Green Heron, and in a less degree in the Reddish Egret,
is worthy of note as it has hitherto been considered as an
established fact that blue pigment did not exist among birds.
In winter the Louisiana Heron is generally to be found in flocks
of twenty or more, almost iuvariabty congregated on one of the
large mangrove islands noticed above. They are very tame

allowing a close approach, and, when disturbed, settle again in
the water or on the neighbouring bushes ; where it is astonishing
how well their colour harmonises with their surroundings, so
that until they move they are practically invisible. Their
flight is slow, weak, and undulating, the apparent undulation
being to a great extent caused by the wings raising the body
when they are depressed and vice-versa, so that we have a state of
things analogous to " the tail wagging the dog." The nest is
placed in the large clumps of mangrove about seven or
eight feet from the ground, but in the breeding season they do
not appear to be gregarious.
The eggs and nest resemble that of most Herons. I found
a nest on one occasion, however, in a somewhat curious place,
namely, in the side of an Osprey's nest. A few of the sticks from
the larger nest had caught in one of the boughs supporting it,
and on this a Heron had built up its own nest partly with new
material and partly by abstracting materials from the side of the
other; neither nest being occupied at the time of my visit, I
cannot say whether botli nests were in use simultaneously or
not.
The Osprey or Fish Hawk (Pandion haliactus) is practi-
cally the only bird of prey which inhabits these wastes, and they
are by no means abundant. The form found in the Bahamas
is resident and differs from the continental form in the head
being pure white instead of brown. Although a fine bird, the
flight is somewhat heavy, and, owing to its size, it appears rather
cumbrous and unwieldy in spite of its actions being similar to
those which are so pleasing in the Kestrel.
When fishing it soars round in large circles till a fish is
seen ; it then gradually narrows the circle, and finally, before
the stoop, hovers like a Tern for a few seconds till it dashes into
the water, whence it emerges, if successful, with a struggling fish,
which it takes to some quiet spot to devour.
The nest is an immense structure some four or five feet in
height and placed, so far as my experience goes, as high up in a
bush as possible, though other observers have stated to the
contrary. It is merely a shapeless accumulation of rubbish and

Mr. J. L. Bonhote,
dead twigs forming on the top a roughly circtilar platform some
two or three feet in diameter. Three appears to be the usual
number of young, and incubation commences towards the
beginning of December. The photograph which appeared in
the last number will give some idea of the nest and the
mangroves among which it was placed ; one of the young from
that nest is now alive and well in my aviaries. The first photo,
in the present number represents an adult bird which was captured
after being slightly hit in the wing; but I did not succeed in
keeping it alive.
Before they are fledged, the young have a peculiar habit,
when annoyed or alarmed, of sitting up on their tarsi, and holding
their heads vertically downwards, drooping their wingp at the
same time, and in this attitude they remain motionless until the
cause of alarm has passed away. In the nest they are very
quarrelsome, pecking viciously at each other for no apparent
reason ; after leaving the nest, however, they roam about in
family parties, aud, if met with under these circumstances,
the old ones will hover round the intruder uttering their plaintive
cry,which much resembles that of the majority of the Raptores.
As will be readily understood, small birds are almost
entirely absent from these regions (the thick bush excepted), and
in all my wanderings I have hardly noted half-a-dozen species.
One kind alone is at home here and was not found elsewhere,
namely the Summer Warbler {Dendroeca petechia) or one of its
nearly allied races. This species is quite the brightest of the
Warblers met with in the Bahamas. In its general tone it is
bright yellow, tinged with greenish on the back, while the neck
and flanks are more or less striped with chestnut. It is a
sprightly little bird and looks a veritable jewel as it darts to and
fro in the dark thick tangle of the mangroves among which
it lives.
The Red-winged Starling (Agelczus phcoiiceits) is another of
the mangrove and swamp-loving birds; the male is pure black
with a gorgeous blaze of scarlet on the upper wing coverts, which
is only displayed when flying or when pouring out its rapturous,
if somewhat unmusical, song. The females and young males are
very different in appearance, being of light brown in colour with

lighter stripes. This species is a strong flier, and when
disturbed, often flies long distances ; the} 7 have also a habit of
running on the ground among the roots of the mangrove, so that
even if you have watched a bird into a particular bush, it may
be no easy matter to get a glimpse of it on a nearer approach.
The Belted Kingfisher (Ccryle alcyoii) is frequently met
with during the winter, although it can hardly be considered
common, and is, as a rule, a very 7 shy and wary bird, flying out of
the tall mangrove clumps long before close observation has been
possible; and, making its wav 7 with long undulating flight to the
shelter, it will settle, and by 7 its chattering alarm the whole
neighbourhood. When fishing they 7 would remind me very 7
much of a Kestrel, or other small hawk, for which I have at times
mistaken them ; they 7 hang over the water with rapidly vibrating
wings and, making a downward swoop, rise again to a similar
elevation some thirty 7 or forty yards farther on, and thus work
along the shore of the lagoon. When a fish is seen they 7 make a
swift dash at it, and, if successful, they almost invariably retire to
a conspicuous position to devour it.
As would be naturally expected, these large and shallow
lagoons abound during the winter with Ducks, and although a
good many 7 species occur, only 7 three or four of them can be called
common, and foremost amongst these is the Bahama Duck
(.Dafila bahamcnsis&apos;). This fine Duck is probably 7 well known to
many members, as it is frequently 7 imported. In colour it is
light brown, spotted all over with a darker shade with the
exception of the tail, which is lighter, appearing conspicuously 7
so when on the wing, and the sides of the face and throat, which
are pure white. The beak is black with a bright triangular
crimson patch at the base of the upper mandible ? in some
specimens this patch is much paler, or even y 7 ellow. Although
belonging to the genus Dafila, i.e., true Pintails, the central
tail-feathers do not greatly exceed the others in length, and are
hardly 7 more pointed than those in many other genera. These
Ducks, which are met with in flocks of from half-a-dozen to
several hundreds, inhabit, as a rule, the inland lagoons, being-
found more rarely 7 on the sea shore ; they 7 are fairly 7 tame, and

generally allow one to get within easy distance, but the larger
the flock the more difficult it is to approach them.
Another species to be found in similar situations is the
Tree or Whistling Duck (De?idrocyg?ia atborea ), which, from its
size and the length of its legs, more resembles a small goose. It
is a very dull-coloured bird, of which the sexes are alike, and is
brown on the back and light below, with dark markings on the
flanks ; it is fairly numerous, though occurring in much smaller
flocks than the last species ; on the wing the flight is excessively
heavy and seldom long sustained.
The only other species to which I need, call attention is the
Scaup (Fuligula americanaj, a bird very numerous on the
lagoons in close proximity to the open sea. As with us in
England, it is much more of a sea-loving bird than either of the
foregoing, and its number on the lagoons is always greatly
augmented after a storm. It is shy and wary, and, from its
habit of keeping to open places, very difficult to approach, and
when shot the flesh is too strong to be eatable.
When wandering through the mud after duck, several other
kinds of birds are met with, which perhaps deserve passing
mention. The American Coot, a bird closely resembling our
well-known species, is abundant on many of the lagoons, from
which they never seem to wander during the winter ; but in
spring the majority migrate northwards, although a few remain
to breed. Another, but scarcer bird, is the Florida Gallinule
(Gallimcla galeataj, which, except in being slightly larger, is
the counterpart of our Moor-Hens. There are also many
Rails, but owing to their skulking habits they are seldom seen.
These birds have, however, distinct tracks or roadways through
the mud, and, although their footmarks frequently diverge as a
single bird turns aside, yet the main roads are obviously used by
many individuals.

By Mrs. Johnstone.
It is with very mixed feelings that I am sending an
account of the nesting of the Satin Bower-bird for publication
in the Magazine ; but I much hope that at any rate the account
may be instructive, and that keepers of insectivorous birds may
benefit from my, alas! very partial success.
I was fortunate enough, last Autumn, to become the
possessor of three pairs of Satin Bower-birds, freshly imported
and all out of colour. They were housed in a small house,
made partially of wood, with a glass roof, and heated with hot
water pipes, the temperature never going below 45 degrees.
There they passed the Winter in perfect health, with one
exception : a hen Satin-bird, which had an apoplectic fit and
died. They were terribly wild at first, and the old Suffolk
keeper, who looked after them, was much distressed at their
continued terror every time he fed them. "They fare so wild I
dursent go near them, they bang about so," he complained : and
to remedy this and give them confidence, several thick boughs
of Scotch fir were placed in a corner of their house. They
diligently made bowers all the Winter of the remains of a garden
broom ; and in the Spring, quite at the end of April, they were
all turned into a garden aviary, where their talents could have
fuller scope.
Their aviary is a large one ; wild rhododendron bushes,
varying in height from 3 ft. to 10 ft., grow in profusion, and
quantities of short sticks, which had collected under the
bushes, were soon brought into use, and a very pretty bower
constructed. It measured 10 in. high and 15 in. long, and the
walls were thick at the base aud curved inward, forming a
passage between ; and the ground for about a ) 7 ard all round was
thickly carpeted with short sticks, and decorated with every
treasure they could find ; even the body of a little Indigo Finch
was carried off and its death first realised by being found
amongst a motley collection at the entrance of the bower.

All the Satin-birds (five) assembled here, and the curious
rolling trilling song of the cocks was continually heard, and
their love dances watched with much interest by the hens who,
so far as I could see, never helped in the building of the bower
or of the decoration thereof. They were to be distinguished
from the cocks by their slighter build, and by their rather
smaller and generally more feminine appearance.
The first nest was constructed of loose twigs in a thick
rhododendron bush, and about eight feet from the ground ; this
was pulled to pieces and a more substantial foundation built,
still of twigs but of some thickness ; and almost immediately
on the completion of the nest the hen began to sit. The nest
looked like a small Crow's nest, and, as I discovered afterwards,
was well lined with small rhododendron leaves. It was situated
about 36 ft. from the bower, and only visited by the pair of birds
to which it belonged, the cock usually keeping guard at the side
of the bush, and attacking any other bird who approached too
near. He never, as far as I could see, fed the hen when on the
nest. She came off at rare intervals and fed herself, but he used
to sing a great deal, particularly in the evening ; the curious
rolling rippling note could be heard a good distance away. He
was, I believe, the oldest of the party, and was a larger bolder
bird than the others, and showed signs of coming shortly into
colour. The back of the neck was thickly pencilled with purple,
and, in comparison to the other birds, he appeared to have
almost a ruff, so thick were the feathers around the back of the
neck A&apos;
The hen sat very closely for three weeks, commencing to
sit on June 7th, and carrying mealworms to the nest for the first
time on June 28th ; and from that time until July 29th, when the
young birds left the nest, she was kept busy, as almost the entire
work of bringing them up devolved upon her. She brooded the
young very closely at first, darting down to seize the mealworms
or cockroaches ; but she never would feed them when anyone
was watching, and would patiently wait with her beak full of
mealworms until the aviary was free from intruders. The young
This rather suggests the Spotted Bower-bird, if lilac instead of purple.--R. P.

birds, too, had their orders, and the nest might have been quite
empty for anything that could be seen from the outside.
Later, they grew too large to be hidden, and tufts of soft
grey down could be seen over the edge of the nest, and their
voices could well be heard at some distance. The cock rarely
fed them ; he would come to the plate of mealworms, satisfy his
own wants, and, if there were one or two to spare, carry them up
to the nest--a great contrast to his hard working little wife, who
drove all the birds from the plate (her greedy husband included)
and filled her beak with mealworms, before eating any herself, to
satisfy the two hungry babies. Cockroaches were first in favour,
then mealworms and gentles; snails they would not touch, and
only a very occasional earthworm was disposed of. Soft-food
mixture or fruit was never used for feeding the babies, although
it was the old birds' staple food.
On July 29th, two young birds (the usual brood when in
a wild state) left the nest, and were first seen squatting on the
rhododendron boughs near the nest, and looking very like young
Thrushes with violet eyes. They were fed all day by their
devoted mother, and occasionally moved from bough to bough,
but they did not look lively or very happy.
And now comes the sad part of the story, for on the
following morning, July 30th, one young bird was found dead,
the mother bird in the greatest distress running wildly up and
down with mealworms in her beak, hunting in every bush, and
taking very little notice of the survivor, who sat stolidly on a
bough, looking, alas! very poorly clothed for our changeable
climate, and not at all lively.
That night the wind changed to N.E., and the following
morning the second little body was discovered ; the keeper fully
realizing something was wrong by the short cries of the poor
mother, who carried the much-loved dainty, some cockroaches,
straight to the body, and then ran wildly up and down in the
greatest distress.
Mr. Phillipps most kindly, after seeing the bodies, told me
the reason of the deaths. Although the bodies were fairly well

Mrs. Johnstone,
nourished, they had received severe checks at some time while
in the nest, due to insufficient food, and the cold winds and
want of feathers had caused a chill to which they succumbed.
He has kindly consented to add a description of the two young
birds, as they were sent to him as soon after death as possible.
[This is a very valuable experience, for even in Australia
very little is known of the private family life of this species.
It will be observed that the father had not adopted the plumage
of the fully adult male, and that the eyes of the young birds
were of the same colour as in the adult. There was an in-
describable difference in the shading of the general colour of
the two young birds, tending to point to their being a pair.
The number of eggs in a clutch is usually two, but not in-
frequently three.
The youngsters were splendid birds, and not badly
nourished on the whole, although the plumage of&amp;quot; the one
first received bore two tell-tale famine streaks. Mrs. Johnstone
had, most unfortunately, left three odd adults in the aviary, so
the task of providing sufficient insect life was superhuman. If
the odd birds could have been quietly run into an adjoining
aviary, their presence would have encouraged the nesters
without interfering with the food supply. The stomachs of the
young ones were absolutely empty of food, though that of the
second contained two pieces of grit. The amount of food that
two great long-legged fast-growing youngsters of this kind
required to fully nourish them and their fast-growing feathers
must have been enormous.
There was another error in the treatment of the breeding
pair. We are told that they were supplied with food every two
hours, later every hour. From this I gather that a certain
amount of insect life was placed in the aviary from time to time.
This is altogether a wrong principle to work upon. And how
about the early mornings ? Can it be stated positively that the
periodical feeding commenced at three o'clock in the morning
and was never delayed or omitted ! The famine streaks on the
tail feathers of the one and the empty stomachs of them both
tell a different tale. If young birds are to be reared successfully.

on the Nesting of the Satin Bower-bird.
there must always be a supply of food within reach of their
parents, especially in the early mornings.
The plan I adopt for the piece de resistance is to have some
large flat pans, nearly filled with bran, sunk in the earth, under
a shed, nearly to a level with the ground. From time to time,
and especially at night, I place handfuls of mealworms in the
bran. When the parents want food for the young they always
have mealworms to fall back upon.
The same course may be adopted with maggots-- but I do
not favour them if I can get anything else.
From time to time, according to my stock in hand, I place
cockroaches in the aviary, in the " demon " trap itself (of course
without the lid) or in some other suitable receptacle.
The course to be adopted is that mentioned by Mr. Farrar
in connection with his Cat-birds (Vol. VIII. p. 286). The place
should be alive with insects, notwithstanding warnings of
plagues of ants as a consequence.
There should also be a supply of prepared yolk of egg, in
flakes, in the aviary. Some parents will just now and then carry
a flake of this to their young when hard pressed ; ordinary
boiled egg is of but little use.
Nevertheless I think they might have been reared if it
had not been for the cold. Down the centre of the underparts,
from chin to tail, when the side feathers were brushed aside,
there was a track of about inch in width, wider over the
abdomen, absolutely bare and naked ; and as soon as they left
the nest the cold was too much for them. I cannot speak
positively, except by conjecture, of the second bird, which,
being found dead on Sunday morning, had been placed in ice
to preserve it for despatch on the following day, but the first
bird, which came to me immediately after death, shewed un-
mistakable signs of a severe abdominal chill.
The following is the description of the young birds:--
Total length to tip of tail inches ; length of bill to gape
1 inch ; Tarsus if inch ; tail barely i# inch. Head sparsely
covered with mouse-brown down. Mantle brown tinged with

blackish, with light shaft streaks. Back dark brown, with buff
shaft streaks, but dark at the tips, giving an indistinct mottled
appearance. Upper tail-coverts the same, but with a tinge of
olive, and with the mesial streaks slightly extending to the
web on each side of the shafts. Tail brown, lightly tipped
with sand} 7 &apos; buff. Quills brown with yellow shafts (inconspicuous
above), with inner webs washed with light sandy; on the fifth
primary yellow encroached on the sandy, and the yellow be-
came more extensive as the body was approached, occupying
the larger part of the inner web, the under aspect of the greater
part of the wing being yellow. Uesser wing-coverts brown, with
sandy shafts; greater wing-coverts brown with darker centres,
edged at tip with sandy, with sub-terminal line of dark brown
or blackish ; primary-coverts dark brown, outer web lighter,
inner edged with yellow or yellow-white. Tower throat and
upper breast soft and downy brown, shafts sandy, tipped
with darker sub-terminal mark, giving a mottled appearance.
Breast much lighter, buff white, with sub-terminal bar of
darker, becoming lighter on abdomen. Under tail-coverts the
same bnt darker. I have described these feathers as they
appeared but, as already stated, when moved aside the centre
track was found to be bare. The flanks were of the same
general character, but more distinctly mottled owing to the
"sub-terminal" bar being darker, and the sandy-buff " tip "
much larger; these again seemed to be faintly edged with
darker at the tip.
Bill, of the characteristic shape of the adult, light but
becoming rather dark horn-brown towards tip. Thighs bare.
Tarsus and feet pale washed-out slaty blue, claws more inclined
to brown. Toes very long and large for so young a bird. All
the flights were encased for about one inch in the quill, with
2-3 inches free. No under wing-coverts.
Inside of mouth bright orange yellow.--R. P.]

By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
The restlessness which drove Elizabethan men Westward
Ho ! sets me East itching to cross the borders of the avian world
in this latter day, there to seek for new creatures, and to see new
things, to experience new dangers, excitements, privations.
The land I loved was the land I saw
Just dropping below the sky;
And when I was there, it was good no more,
So forward again trudged I.
When, therefore, one morning in the early Summer of
the present year I received a letter from Mr. Hamlyn, offering
me a pair of Pied Shrikes from Australia, I fell an easy prey to
his too persuasive pen. My good nature is such that, as a quaint
miner friend once said to me : " If it was only two cocks ye see
fightin' on the road, yer heart'd take part with one o' them ! "
Briefly, I am a martyr to a sense of duty--and curiosity.
The old bait of knowledge is still effective. We cannot get rid
of Eden, our curiosity is rampant as ever. We all take a bite
out of the apple now and then ; some of us from the green side,
others from the rosy : but we all like a bite more or less, sooner
or later. It is a trick to be regretted, as knowledge really seems
to bring a deal of trouble in its train ; from the sticking on
of the fig-leaves, down to too close acquaintance with our
neighbours lives.
The birds arrived in due course, and quite took my fancy
with their quaint Quaker-like costume. The Pied Shrike may
be briefly described as a " study in black and white." The cock
is about eight inches long ; he has a bold black eye ; the head a
beautiful glossy black; chin and breast dusky white; wings
black with white shoulder patch, and a second small patch on
the top of the flights ; back and sides of the rump black. The
beak has a strong curved hook on the end, as I shall always
remember from the hearty way in which he laid hold of my
finger : I fairly screamed with agony. Have you ever run a fish
hook into your hand ? if you have, you will appreciate my
sufferings. The legs are black. The outer tail feathers are

white, except just at the base ; the next are black, except on the
outer edge and tip, centre of the tail black.
The hen is rather smaller than the cock. She has only
one white patch, and is reddish on the sides and under the
wings.
My birds were wonderfully tame, and seemed to have no
fear of man at all. Of course, being Shrikes, they require a
large amount of animal food. Give them a small mouse, and
they will kill and eat it with as little compunction as an English
sportsman would kill a rabbit.
The Pied Shrike is one of the most beautiful and dapper
birds I have ever kept; always spotlessly clean, and, in his
beautiful white waistcoat and glossy black coat,- reminds me of
the late Mr. Panmure Gordon, of Stock Exchange renown.
My Pied friends are very easy to feed. I give them any
soft food with a plentiful supply of mealworms, blackclocks, and
small baby mice, and they always look fat and well - liking.
Needless to remark, they are not birds that you would turn into
an aviary where there was aught that you valued.
I should not call the Pied Shrike a grateful bird, for after
I have fed him to the full with luscious mealworms, I have seen
him repeatedly hop away contemptuously ; saying as plainly as a
newsboy in Boar Pane would say it, " Oh, now you can go and
shoot yourself! "
THE TASMANIAN MAGPIE.
The Piping Crows ( Gymnorhina) of Australasia, known to
the Colonists as " Magpies," are an interesting and entertaining
genus, combining the intelligent mischievousness of the Corvidce
with an exceptionally musical voice. The Eesser White-backed
species of Tasmania ( G. hyperleztca), is the subject of an interest-
ing article by Mr. Frank Eittler in the current number of the
Zoologist. The species is entirely confined to Tasmania, not even
being found on any of the islands of Bass Strait. The same
tree, we are told, is resorted to year after 3&apos;ear, for the nest,
although the same nest is not occupied during successive

seasons ; and, should one of a pair be killed, the survivor brings
another mate to the old nesting tree. Although the usual
nesting materials are sticks and twigs, some Magpies in the
Longford district built their nests of the wire that the first self-
binding machines used for binding the sheaves of corn. It is
much to be regretted that so many of the farmers in Tasmania
regard the Magpie as one of their enemies, and in some districts
have almost exterminated it. Seeing the birds searching among
the sprouting grain for the grubs which form one of their chief
items of diet, they imagine they are eating the grain itself, and
so wage war upon one of their best friends. The Tasmanian
Magpie makes a most delightful pet, Mr. Littler informs us,
" though after a time it becomes very mischievous, and delights
in pulling up freshly-set plants."' One of these birds used to
watch turnips or onions being thinned out, and then, when it
thought no one was looking, went on with the thinning until not
a plant remained.
CORRESPONDENCE.
HEATING, ETC., FOR AVIARY.
The following reply ?vas sent to ll/r. Mathias in reply to a query:
You cannot do better than carry out your plan of carrying on the
hot water pipes into the proposed aviary.
I have tried all kinds of oil stoves and two forms of gas stoves, and
have found both expensive, dangerous, and most unsatisfactory. I now use
only hot-water pipes and radiators.
If you colour part of the glass, to deaden the sun-heat, I do not
think the roofing-felt will be necessary ; but, it would be well to wire the
inside all over with half-inch netting, A11 open-flight for the summer
months would be a valuable addition.

and it was found had laid an egg. Unfortunately the bird became worse
later and died. I was ill at the time and did noc see the egg (which got
broken soon after it was laid) ; hut niv birdman told me it was pure white,
rather larger than the egg of a Parson Finch, and much more slender and
pointed. I did not even know the Whydalis were nesting, though I once
saw the cock making a strange sort of love dance. Dr. Russowr^ raised one
young bird, but he regrets he missed observing the appearance of the eggs.
jMy cock Whydah caught cold and died a day or two after the hen.
In the same aviary I have a cock Green Singing-finch, and a hen
English Goldfinch. These two birds have nested together twice this
summer. The first time four or five eggs were laid. They were greyish,
with dark red blotches. This nest was destroyed by some other bird, and
the eggs broken. One egg that I had transferred to a Canary failed to hatch.
The second attempt was more successful, three young birds being hatched.
Of these, two are now larger than the Green Singing-fincli. At present
they are in size and shape very like the young hen Chaffinches, but they look
like making handsome birds later on. The other nestling, which was the
finest of the three, unfortunately got drowned just after it had left the
nest.
The first nest was built within a few inches of the nest of a Violet
Dove, and both birds sat at the same time in perfect harmony. Both the
Goldfinch and Green Singing-finch were most careful parents, and in
consequence the young birds are very strong and healthy.

Since writing the above the birds have developed orange chins and
foreheads, and also yellow in the wings. One of them can already sing

GREEN BULBULS, (Chloropsis).
Sir,--I have just received a "Green-Bulbul," a very healthy lively
bird, and so tame ; it will eat out of my hand.
I am rather curious as to which " Green-Bulbul " it is ; I rather fancy
it must be Chloropsis hodgsoni , as it answers very well&apos; to the description of
that bird at page 12 of Vol. VII. of the Avicultural Magazine.
It is at present minus a tail and some flights ; but the blue patch
meets under its bill ; and then comes a black bib, edged with an orange
border which fades into the green of the breast. The patch on its head is
much the colour of that on a cock Saffron Finch, very bright ; and it has
pale blue shoulder patches.
Its two call-notes answer exactly to those of hodgsoni --one harsh
and one a lovely clear loud whistle. I see they are referred to as rare and
expensive ; I paid only 15/6 for this one, which seems very cheap.
Mary F. Rathborne.
The following reply zoas sent to Mrs. Rathborne:
I think the writer of the account of C. hodgsoni to which you refer
must have been confused in his mind over the Green-Bulbuls. For some
reason, people will persist in confusing the rare (in this country) Malabar
Green-Bulbul with the common Gold-fronted Green-Bulbul, Chloropsis
anrifrons. Your bird is doubtless the latter. See Mr. Finn's " Notes" on C.
malabarica and C. anrifrons at page 86 of Volume VIII.
Chloropsis hodgsoni is more commonly known as the Blue-winged
Green-Bulbul; but the better name is " Orange-bellied Green-Bulbul," the
under parts being orange. You will find a coloured plate of the male and
female of this species in Volume III., facing page 169, with an account of
the bird from the pen of our esteemed Member, Mr. Russell Humplirys.
The Golden-fronted Green-Bulbul makes a charming pet when kept by
itself (it is usually very spiteful towards other birds), but please remember
two things :--(1) It is sensitive to cold, and must be kept warm ; (2) It is
liable to fits, and must not be too highly fed.

BURROWING OWL IN A FIT.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994914414634147" page_id="10284157"  page_num="Page 74" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I should like to tell you about one of my Owls. A few days
ago the male was suddenly seized with violent convulsions ; its wings were
stiffly stretched out, its beak dug into the ground, it could not stand ; this
went on for some time, then its eyes closed, and it drew its wings together
and seemed to fall or roll down the burrow. It lay there motionless from
about three to seven o'clock. We could see it just breathing : this seemed
gradually to get fainter, and we thought the bird was dead, but decided to
leave it alone till the next morning. I heard the hen bird many times in
the night, and began to wonder what I should do with her alone, as I feared
she would pine. Next morning, to my astonishment, I saw both the Owls
flying and hopping about apparently in the best of health. The male
seemed just as usual through the day, ate his food well, and has gone on so
ever since. Is it not extraordinary ; can you account for it at all ? Do you
think they do not get enough mice ? We never see any pellets in the
aviary. Perhaps Owls have a greater tenacity to life than other birds.
Octavia Gregory.
The following reply zvas sent to Mrs. Gregory :
Your Owl has had a very serious fit. You should have instantly
seized him, held his head well up, and dashed cold water freely over his face
and head.
For such a bird, strong quick-acting medicine must be administered
with as little delay as possible. Castor oil is the best, but the greatest care
must be taken not to soil the feathers. For this reason, Epsom salts are
preferable. But there is great risk in administering medicine to a sense-
less bird, at some of it may go down " the wrong way " and be the means of
causing death. With the ring part of a key you may often force open, and
keep open, the mouth of these birds, and then, with a paint brush, the
medicine may be placed inside the mouth. Sometimes this may be done
with a quill. In any case, it is more easy in theory than in practice.
You feed too well or not correctly. Give as little solid meat as
possible. Mice are the best; also rats, rabbits cut up with the fur, heads,
etc., of fowls from the poulterers--j'ou must give fur or feather.
Remove all the water except a small dish. Put Epsom salts in this :
if he will not take it then j&apos;ou must fall back on fluid magnesia.
These fits must not be neglected ; and please remember they are
almost always brought on by improper feeding in some form or another.
I know very well that it is more easy for me to preach than for you to
practise; but it is best to point out what is wrong, so that you may know
what to aim at. Reginald Phieeipps.
[This poor bird has since died. It is not often that a bird really
recovers from the effects of so serious a fit as that described.--R. P.]

THE LETTERED ARACARI, ORIOLES, ETC.
(Seep. 32;.
Sir, --You will, I am sure, be glad to hear that the Lettered Aracari
is much better now.
He got very bad after I last wrote, would hardly eat anything--just a
little banana--and sat all fluffed up with eyes closed panting hard. He had
very bad dysentery, and did not digest his food in the least; he drank a
great deal. I gave him the squills and " hippo wine " in his drinking
water, and also occasionally raw meat juice, as he would not eat meat or
mealworms. He kept getting worse and worse for about eight days, when
I thought he would not live many hours, and as a kill or cure gave him au
egg-spoonful of Epsom salts in water; in about an hour he seemed better
and ate a little bread and milk, and ever since has been steadily improving,
and eating well.
I now give him a mixture of egg, breadcrumbs, and potato, pretty
moist, for he will not eat it at all dry; also cut up banana, sweet grapes
split, and squills in the drinking water. He got back the dysentery on the
bread and milk diet, but I cured it at once with five drops of chlorodine in a
wine glass of water; a few sips twice a da) r cured him at once. He is now
quite lively and tight feathered, croaks and plumes himself all day long,
but the snuffling keeps as bad as ever in his nostrils ; how could I cure
this ?
Our Sykes' Oriole has now just begun to moult; it will be rather
exciting watching him. We are putting up a radiator in his room to warm
it better.
Mary F. Rathborne.
The following reply toas sent to Mrs. Rathborne.
Possibly, if Mrs. Rathborne were to try a few drops of paregoric, that
might dry up the catarrh ; or there is a new preparation called Glyco-
Thermoline, that I have found decidedly useful in some cases where I used
it diluted as a nasal douche ; but it may also be taken internally, say ten
drops in a tablespoonful of water for drinking, a few sips at a time.

WINTERING COCKATOOS, ETC.
Sir, -- I have had two Great Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, two Rosy-
breasted Cockatoos, and one Bauer Parrakeet, each summer for about
ten years, flying loose in an outdoor aviary, 24ft. by 6ft., by 8ft. high,
all open wire work, and facing south. At the north end there is an
enclosure of brick 8ft. by 6ft., by Sft. high. My birds each winter have been
moved into a wire enclosure in my conservatory.

Henry Fother gill, Major.
Sir,--C ertainly, Mr. Buxton, in his paper on the Parrots he turned
loose at Northrepps, found Cockatoos too hardy. They would stay out in all
weathers, and get their toes frost-bitten.

CROWS, ROOKS, ETC.
&apos; Sir, --I see in the November number a query re Crows, Rooks, etc. I
think from Mrs. Keene's letter that there can be little doubt that the bird is
a Rook. A young Raven by the end of April is much larger than a Rook,
and it hardly grows once it is full feathered. The Crow it is certainly not,
as Crows are not glossy blue black, but much duller birds and of darker

colour, especially about the head. Glossy blue-black exactly describes the
colour of a young Rook in its first year. The distance from the line of
demarcation, between the ordinary feathers and those covering the nostril,
to the tip of the beak measured along the middle line, is nearly inches in
the Rook, and only two inches in the Crow, so that if the bird allows itself
to be handled the matter should be easily settled.
Mr. Phillipps' remarks about the colour of the base of the feathers
hold good, if specimens of both species are at hand to compare, as those on
the Crow are lighter than on the Rook, but are not pure white.

Sir,--W ould you kindly advise me as to my Yellow-naped Amazon
Parrot. I bought it about a mouth ago, and it had then a bad cold and wheezed
and sneezed a great deal. It is better, but one nostril is still a good deal
stopped up and sometimes very wet. It is in fair condition and is just finish-
ing moulting. I feed on a mixture of Parrot-food, canary, and millet as a
staple,with a small piece (three or four inches) of bread with hot milk poured
over and drained off, sprinkled thickly with sugar, every morning at break-
last. Occasionally nuts, fruit, and twice I have given it a piece of cooked
mutton, the size of a large pea, which it seemed to enjoy. It is fairly tame,
and sits outside its cage, and, after much persuasion, on my hand.
I want to get it into bright hard condition; the feathers seem dull
with no life in them. It eats cuttlefish and eggshell freely. Is there any

way of guessing at the age of Parrots ? This one's beak is rather shelly,
and uneven at the tip.
(Mrs.) M. V. Charrington.
The following reply was sent:
I should not give the bread and milk at present. So long as the bird
has a running at the nose I should put a few drops of Tabasco's sauce into
its water. Make up its food of one quarter sunflower seed, one quarter
hemp ; the remaining half of equal parts of oats (white), millet, and canary
seed. Shake all these well together. Peanuts, nuts, walnuts, and fruit
may be given, and the bird should have green wood from sycamore, lime,
beech, and horse chestnut, to bite to pieces. Keep it warm and out of
draughts.

THE MISUSE OF THE MEALWORM.
Sir,--I n July, at p. 1S2, in connection with the swollen feet of my
Pittas, I referred to the evil results that follow the feeding of certain species
of birds too freely on mealworms. I have since received a letter from the
Rev. Hubert D. Astley, which he authorizes me to publish for the inform-
ation of our Members. -- R. PhieeippS.
" I grieve over the Pittas.I come to the conclusion that
you are perfectly right about the injurious results from over-feeding on
mealworms.
Now I know--thanks to you:--
i. My Hoopoes --constantly eating mealworms. All died off with festered
feet, or over-heated skins.
ii. Lesser Ring Plovers --The same.

HARDY BIRDS.
Sir,--C ould you forward a list of birds which would live in an out-
door uulieated aviary. Would the Weaving Weavers and Wrens live.
C. Castee-Seoane.
The following answer has been sent to Mr. Castle-Sloane :
My experience of foreigners has led me to the conclusion that all Doves
most Australian Finches, the Indian Amaduvade (Avadavat), Java Sparrows,
Saffron Finches, and all the typical Weavers are absolutely hardy. I should
expect to find foreign Wrens more delicate than our British one.

LIOTHRIX: REDPOLL: HYBRID.
Sir,-- Would you kindly inform me wliat would be the best treatment
fora Pekin Nightingale, which seems to be very costive, has slight swelling
about the throat, with a continual opening and shutting of its beak, and a
seedy appearance generally ? It is a great favourite (the aviary is an out-
door one) and it is well acclimatised, having been through last winter
successfully, It is a hen bird, its mate is very fit. It will take a meal-
worm out of my hand, but seems to see with difficulty, and its eyes looked
swollen. I shall be glad of any information that will tend to cure it.
I have noticed in some of the numbers of the AviculturalMagazine
that I have received, that Redpolls do not often breed in captivity. I have
bred them for two successive seasons, and a Grey Linnet assisted the two
birds (the parent Redpolls) to rear their young.
I also bred two years ago a cross between a South African Green
Singing-finch, and an English Canary (hen), the bird is now living and
sings splendidly, throwing its head back, like its male parent, which it
much resembles, except that it is considerably larger. Is this cross a
common one ? I have not met with it before. I did not try to mate them,
they were at liberty in the aviary along with the others.
E. Norwood.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Norwood:
It looks as if your Pekin Nightingale had caught a severe cold ; but,
in any case, it ought to be caged and kept warm indoors for the present.
Put five grains of Epsom salts, dissolved in a wineglassful of warm
water, into a drinking-pan for one day's drink. After this has acted,
substitute a mixture, consisting (daily for eight to ten days if necessary) of
five grains of iodide of potassium, eight drops of glycerine, ten drops of
tincture of lobelia, and twenty drops of Hoffman's anodyne to a wine-
glassful of water.
Should the bird get better, complete the cure by giving a mild tonic
daily for a week or two--a few crystals of sulphate of iron will do very well
dissolved in the drinking water.
Redpolls do not often breed in captivity ; probably because they are
seldom tried in outdoor aviaries.
The hybrid you mention is not a common one ; but I believe most
attempts to breed it have been made in cages indoors.

(Trochalopterum lineatum ), in an unheated garden aviary throughout the
winter. I should also be very glad to know of any (excluding Parrakeets)
bright-pluniaged birds about the size of Cardinals, which would be
hardy enough to stand an English winter without protection except that
of an unheated aviary. Frederic Waecop.
The following reply has been sent to the Hon. F. Wallop :
Although I have never tried so-called Orioles, Bulbuls, or Laughing-
Thrushes out-of-doors in the winter, I do not for a moment believe that
they would be able to stand the cold and moisture which characterize that
season in our country.
When one considers that those of our insectivorous birds which
naturally migrate to N. Africa, are unable to stand the English winter, it
seems more than probable that natives of Southern N. America, Nepal, and
Persia, would stand but a poor chance of survival.
The Rose-breasted Grosbeak might stand a better chance, but it is too
good a bird to risk the life of.
The Doves form the hardiest group of cage-birds, least liable to suffer
from cold, on account of their dense plumage ; some of these are brilliant
in colouring, but it is not easy to select many brilliantly coloured birds, the
size of Cardinals and excluding Parrots, which are capable of standing
extreme cold. Some of the Starlings, such as the Rose-coloured Pastor,
and perhaps some of the Mynahs, would probably do very well.

BRITISH BIRD NOTES.
Sir, --On the 17th of April last I found a pair of Tree Creepers were
building in a box, which I had nailed on to the side of an old shed. The
nest was built of pine tw'igs with moss, hair and grass, and a lining of
feathers. Five eggs were laid. Both birds brought material to the nest,
but one seemed to do all the building, as it stopped in the box for a minute,
while the other only stayed for a few seconds.
On May 31st the birds looked ready to fly. There were four young
Creepers and a bird with great wdiite patches on the sides of its head (I
took one of the Creepers eggs for a specimen). I could not make out what it
was at the time and I could not get it out of the nest, it clung so tightly to
the bottom. I took the box down and found it was a j-oungGreat Titmouse
(Pams major). I tried to hand-rear two of the Creepers, and miserably
failed. I fed them on ants and winter moth larvae, yolk of egg and ants'
cocoons, and gave them a drink afler every meal. They died in two days.
I shall not try any more birds after that. Do birds get anything to drink
before they leave the nest ?
On June 3rd. at 8 p.111., the two other Creepers had flown, but not the

Titmouse. It was fastened down by a piece of stringy material round
above and between the toes of one foot. I did my best, but cut the hind
toe nearly off. The next day the bird was dead on the ground, about ten
yards from the nest, with one wing broken, probably owing to my clumsiness.
Last year I found a Linnets' nest of the ordinary size, with three song
Thrushes' eggs embedded in the material, two at the bottom and one at the
side, just showing through. The Linnet was sitting on four of her own
eggs at the time. I think some small boy must have put them there when
the nest was partly made. If so, the wonder is that the Linnet did not
desert.
I have found here a Marsh Tits' nest with nine eggs in it, and a Turtle
Doves' with three eggs. Doves' nests are very flimsy things, and daylight
can be seen through them, but sometimes it is quite impossible to tell
whether there are any eggs in them or not without climbing up to see, as
eggs and daylight look just the same from about 15 feet below.
H. L. Sich.
A FEATHER-PICKING SHAMA.
Sir,-- My Shama has for the last fortnight or so been picking out the
feathers on the top of the wings and shoulders, and picks at himself a
great deal, especially in the evenings. I caught him this morning, and
found that all the skin looks red, but could not see any insects. However,
I dusted him with a little Keating&apos;s. He is in a wooden cage, and kept
very clean. * He washes well every day, and otherwise is perfectly healthy,
although he is not singing much. He moulted well in August.
He is fed on egg, a food mixture, a little raw meat, and two or three
mealworms per day. M. E. StanyFORTh.
T/ie follozving zeply was sent to Mrs. Stanyforth :
When it is quite dark, some two hours after sunset, take a good light
and, if necessary, a magnifying glass, and carefully examine the cage. If
there are insects, you will see them running about.
Should there be insects, and the symptoms you describe are those of
red mite, get some common soft soap, and, with the soft soap as bought, fill
up all the chinks and crevices in the cage. Every night, rub the cage well
over with a good sized piece of rag which has been soaked in paraffin.
If the bird is healthy, usually it is uot necessary to touch them ; if
you should do anything, a little extract of quassia in the bathing (not
drinking) water will probably be quite sufficient.
A Shama kept in a cage in the house all through the year very often
takes to plucking its feathers from irritation of the skin. This is caused by
injudicious feeding in some form, usually by too high living. You cannot

feed a Shama caged in the house too simply. Raw meat is distinctly bad ;
if necessai&apos;)-, give him a little cooked meat (say a scrap of cold mutton) very
carefully scraped and triturated ; and, for the present at any rate, stop the
mealworms. Preserved j'olk of egg, in flakes, is better than ordinary hard-
boiled egg. Spiders, earwigs, woodlice, small cockroaches, &amp;c., are good.
From time to time, place a little fluid magnesia in the drinking water.
Occasionally give him a grape, cut up into small pieces.

THE NEW MEDAL RULE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98810075" page_id="10284164"  page_num="Page 81" year="" vol="">
Sr,--T he Executive have acted ultra vires in making a new Medal
Rule.
Rule io. of the Society says: "The COUNCIL (but not a Com-
mittee of the Council) shall have power to alter and add to the Rules, from
time to time, in any manner they may think fit."
I happened to say to several members, including at least one member
op the Council, that the Hon. Walter Rothschild had kindly lent me a pair
of Brown's Parrakeets, and that they were sitting.
In the next number of the Magazine the new Rule, re Medal,
appeared, and I feel justified in saying it was the outcome of petty jealousy.
Had I not mentioned the fact that the Brown's had been lent me, I
venture to think we should not have had this new Rule. I am confident it
was made for my special benefit, although I am sure I was conscious of no
wrong, or I should never have spoken so openly op Mr Rothschild&apos;s kindness
to me. C. D. Farrar.
[Mr, Farrar refers to the Rules which govern the Society itself; they
have nothing to do with the Medal, which has always been entirely under the
control of the Executive Committee.
We can positively state that the new Medal Rule was not suggested
by any member of the Council to whom Mr. Farrar had mentioned the fact of
a pair of Parrakeets being lent him b)&apos; the Hon. W. Rothschild, neither was
the fact made known to the Committee by any such member. When the
Committee conceived the idea of awarding a Medal for the breeding of birds
that had never before bred in the United Kingdom, it was never their
intention that the Medal should be awarded to borrowed birds. It would
be most unfair to those who, perhaps, spend a considerable sum in
purchasing some rare species of bird and hope some day to induce them to
breed and thus merit the Society's Medal, if another member can go and
borrow an acclimatized pair of the same species, and, by inducing them to
breed, gain the Medal. We leave it to our members to judge as to whether
the new Rule is fair or not, and we have little doubt that their verdict will
be in the affirmative. This correspondence must now close.--E d.]

By Reginald Phillipps.
It was in April last, at page 10S of Vol. VIII,, that this
interesting species was brought specially under the notice of our
readers by Mr. E. W. Harper. Mr. Harper has given such a
good account of the bird that little remains for me to say.
Moreover, Mr. Harper knows the bird in its native country and
has kept several specimens, whereas my personal knowledge of
the species is limited to one solitary individual, a chance impor-
tation that came into my hands, with one of its wings cut, on the
7th of July, 1902.
For a while I kept it in a four-foot cage in a spare room,
with my Silver-eared Mesias, and, later, loosed it into the bird-
room.
For some time it led a very secluded life, partly because
of its inability to fly, but chiefly from fear of its feathered
companions. It climbed about the place, slipping between the
bars of the several " houses," and was nearly as difficult to find
as a mouse. Not that it went to the ground ; far from it; but it
kept a great deal in dark corners and quiet nooks, where it would
be least likely to be observed, more often hanging on to the
inside of the wire of a "house" than sitting restfully on a perch.
Little by little it grew bolder, and in due course moulted,
when it became much bolder and freer in its movements,
occasionally paying a visit to the garden, where it would be
supremely happy creeping and clambering about the shrubs.

Mr. R. Phillipps,
But it did more than this for, little by little, it became very tame,
and now will hardly move out of a feeding saucer for me when
I am attending to the food. It has found out that I am not a
person to be feared, but an amiable kind of food-producing
creature whose presence in the birdroom is rather to be
encouraged than otherwise.
I have not the time to attempt to make a pet of it, but
Mr. Harper has told us how familiar this species will become,
everything he tells us being corroborated by my own observations
on my solitary Golden Eye, excepting only the " tickling," which
my specimen, so far, has managed to exist without.
I do not know the sex of my bird, the sexes being alike
we are told (Cat. Birds, Vol. VII. p. 510); but probably it is a
female. It is a pity that it should be alone, for with a companion
it would be so much more at home, and one would have a better
chance of observing its true nature. So far, it has not shewn
the slightest inclination to keep company with any other bird ;
even when confined with the Mesias, they kept as separate as oil
and water. It spends much of its time with a Golden-throated
Barbet (Cyanops jranklini), but probably that is only for the sake
of convenience ; it is I think the Barbet's house and food that
attract it, not the Barbet himself.
It is an insectivorous and more or less frugivorous species,
doubtless in the wild state climbing amongst the underwood,
etc., and searching for insect life in every form. In captivity it
seems to be fond of preserved yolk of egg, picking this out of
the food dishes when there chances to be any.
To what extent it is actually frugivorous I do not know,
but I frecpiently see it at the fruit saucers. When I bring the
latter, freshly attended to, into the birdroom, there are five birds
that are stirred up into active life at the sight. The two Golden-
throated Barbets and the Black-naped Oriole (p. 33 ; and p. 100
of Vol. VIII.) at once take their stand by the place where each
bird's dish is invariably placed. This shews reasoning power--
for they never fly towards the dishes in my hands, but know
their several destinations to an inch. Directly I enter the room,
a light slim little figure perches 011 the edge of a saucer; the

corner by the door is, this time of the year, too dark for the bird
to select what it wants, but, as I advance into the light, it picks
out the choicest piece of grape, and flies off with it. This is the
Brown-eared Bulbul, Hemixus flavala, referred to at p. 185 of
Vol. VIII. But while this bit of by-play has been going on, my
little friend with the Golden Plye has been coming towards me,
tripping and flicking, turning now this way then that, along a
long perch, about on a level with my face. It cpiietly comes on to
the rim of a saucer and, like the Bulbul, chooses a piece of grape,
which it carries off to some secluded corner where, holding it
in one foot, it discusses it at its leisure. It does not swallow the
portion of grape whole like the Bulbul, but carefully picks out
the fleshy part from the skin. Jerdon says, " It feeds mostly on
insects, often on ants and small coleoptera."
In the wild state, this species is common over the greater
part of India, and ranges eastward into Burma, etc., a kindred
species with black nostrils, P. nasalis, being found in Ceylon.
Common as it is, however, Mr. Harper tells us that it is not a
favourite cage-bird in India, and this is doubtless the reason why
it so seldom finds its way to this country.
According to Jerdon, our present subject with the yellow
nostrils is not a bird of the hills, but " frequents low jungles, or
the skirts of forests, long grass, hedge-rows, and even comes
occasionally into gardens. ... it is generally seen in small
parties of five or six, flying from bush to bush before you, and
trying to conceal itself in some thick clump. ... I have on
several occasions heard one, perched conspicuously on a high
bush or hedge-row (*), pour forth a remarkably sweet song."
Jerdon's description of the bird is short, and I will give it
as it stands :--" Above clear red brown, rufous or cinnamon colour
on the wings, and the tail obsoletely banded with dusky ; lores,
and all the lower plumage, white ; lower surface of wings and
tail dusky cinereous. Bill black, with the nostrils deep yellow ;
legs orpiment yellow ; hides dark brown, with an outer circle of
buff; orbits bright orange. Length 6J inches." The bill is
short, deep, and arched. Mr. Gronvold informs me that, at the

Museum, the bills of some of the specimens are deeper and more
arched than that of my bird, but whether this difference is a
mark of sex or age I do not know. Perhaps it is the distinctive
mark of the male.
To the foregoing description of the plumage I must add
that, when feeding below me on the ground on a bright day, I
have noticed some delicate shading and clouding on the back,
which are not usually observable. Perhaps this is the "slight
shade of olivaceous above " of the young bird, as described in
the Museum Catalogue. But it is only since the moult that it has
been observed, and it has never occurred to me that my specimen
is a bird of the year. If this be so, then Mr. Gronvold's
painting is that of a bird in its nest-feathers. Further on in the
Catalogue it is added that " Birds of the year will probably be
found to be paler and more fulvescent in tone of plumage than
adults." The bill of my bird is black, not dark brown as that of
the young bird is stated to be.
The bird will perch or hang in any position, its powerful
legs and toes being specially observable. Referring to Jerdou
again, in the N.W. Provinces this is the bird said by the natives
" to support the heavens by its legs, lest they fall."
It must not be supposed from the foregoing that the
Golden-eyed Babbler is an insipid and spiritless creature, for
such is not the case. Only yesterday (December ioth) for
instance, I happened to notice the much larger Brown-eared
Bulbul approach its favourite food-dish ; but it was immediately
put to flight, for our little friend, with head well down, made a
ram-like charge at the intruder who, true to his character, beat a
hasty and undignified retreat.
My little Golden-eyed Babbler makes a very engaging and
interesting pet, easily kept if not exposed to cold ; in my
opinion the species is well worthy of an honoured place in our
aviaries ; and Mr. Harper, as may be seen from his Article, is
of the same opinion.
December nth:--This afternoon, I heard my Golden
Eye sing for the first time. Noticing a strange song when
feeding the birds, I traced it to a gable-roofed " house " where, in

a quiet well-sheltered spot, I found our little friend singing away
most happily. Although a " little " song, it was sweet and
attractive, and adds considerably to the value of the species as a
pet. He was quite alone. He has several little call notes, not
very often uttered, one commencing with a running twitter being
perhaps the most commonly uttered.
From this, and his exhibition of boldness yesterday, I may
now conclude that my bird is a male, probably a young one.
The comparatively small bill may, therefore, be accepted as a sign
of juvenility, not of sex.

Part IV.
One of the chief objects of my journey was to learn more
about the nesting habits of the Flamingo, which is undoubtedly
the most beautiful bird found in these islands, and, in this
respect, the results were not very satisfactory. The Flamingo,
as most of my readers are aware, is an aberrant, and very highly
specialized, member of the Duck family. It is entirely an
inhabitant of salt, shallow lagoons, and, in such places, a species
of the genus may be found, though by no means commonly,
throughout the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world.
Its food consists, almost entirely, of small animalculae and
molluscs which it-stirs up with its feet from the mud at the
bottom of the lagoons in which it feeds. Once these facts are
understood, the reason of its peculiar structure becomes at once
patent; the long legs enable it to keep its body above the water
and at the same time to stir up the mud, while the long neck by
counterbalancing the legs enables it to feed comfortably from the
bottom.
The peculiar shape of the beak has always struck me as a
most marvellous instance of adaptation, the large and hollow
lower mandible and the flat upper mandible are precisely analo-
gous to those of a duck except that the positions of the man-

Mr. J. L. Bonhote
dibles are reversed so that the upper mandible takes the place of
the lower and vice versa.
But this difference is more apparent than real, for, when
the bird is feeding, his mandibles, owing primarily to the down-
ward bend of the neck but also to their own peculiar shape,
become reversed so that the beak is, for practical purposes,
precisely similar to that of a true duck. The edges of the
mandibles are laminated though not quite as thoroughly as in the
ducks; but the tongue which is very large and fleshy has
filamentous processes on either side answering the same purpose,
and which, as the bird strains the water through its bill, serves to
retain any solid particles of food or mud, the latter being
swallowed in large quantities. Owing to the barrenness of the
localities in which it lives and to its brilliant colour it is a most
conspicuous bird, aud can be made out at a distance of a mile or
more; it is however very wary and most difficult to approach,
stretching up its neck to the uttermost on the slightest sign of
danger.
Their power of hearing does not appear to be very greatly
developed as, if near any cover, they would allow a close
approach so long as the observer kept out of sight; let him,
however, but show himself in ever so slight a manner, every neck
at once shoots upwards and the birds will retreat walking away
in a slow aud dignified manner and eventually take to the wing.
The bump of curiosity is, however, considerably developed
and they seldom flew away at once, almost invariably taking a
good look at the intruder before doing so, and frequently settling
again a few hundred yards off to study the habits of the strange
human animal that was invading their solitudes. If undisturbed
they remain very quiet all day, and are rarely seen on the wing
except in the morning aud evening. During the winter they
spread about over the islands wherever suitable feeding grounds
are to be found, but in the breeding season they r gather together
in immense flocks at certain places which are frequented year by
year. The colonies of nests are not built every year on precisely
the same spots, but within a very short distance of those of
former years; I found about ten colonies in various stages of
decay within a radius of about a mile.

The position which they assume when incubating their
eggs has long been a doubtful point among naturalists, and,
although at the present day it is generally acknowledged that
they sit on their nests like ordinary birds, several independent
naturalists have asserted that they sit astride, and the point has
never been definitely solved.
The nests, as may be seen from the photograph, are conical
structures of mud, about 12 to iS inches in height, by about 9
inches at their upper end and 5 or 6 inches more at their base ;
they are hollowed out at the top something in the shape of a soup
plate and the large chalky white egg is placed in the depression.
In their breeding habits they appear very irregular and in some
seasons do not apparently breed at all. The mud for the nests
is scooped up from the ground immediately surrounding them,
though I am unable to say the exact manner in which they lift it.
The few nests which I came across in process of building were
very much trampled upon, as if they had been patted down to
solidify them, but whether that was so, or merely that they were
trodden on owing to the number of the birds, I cannot say.
It has often been remarked as very curious that the birds
should build these mud nests right out in the water , but after
having seen them in their native haunts (I am of course only
speaking from my Bahama experience) it would be difficult to
imagine a more comfortable way of solving the matter. The
land there lies so low that during the rainy season it is mostly
under water, so that, were they to nest on the ground, the}&apos; would
be very liable to be washed out, and, were they to nest on the
obviously higher ridges, the young would have a terrible walk
to their feeding grounds which would be practically impossible
to such a long legged bird.
It is therefore essential that the nest should be near the
-water, and, as from causes of tide and rain, the water fluctuates
in depth, the nest must be built sufficiently high off the ground
to avoid the floods. As there are no trees or shrubs capable
of supporting so large a bird, the case is most easily settled
by building up a mud structure.
In the building of this mud nest difficulties arise; if

Mr. J. b . Bonhote,
built right in the water it would never harden and consequently
would gradually be worn away by the action of the water ; on
the other hand, if it were built on dry land, the mud is too hard
to be scooped up, and to transport fifty or sixty pounds of mud
from the water to the shore would be an undertaking beyond the
power of any bird. Consequently I believe that, in the Bahamas
at any rate, the birds wait for the first rains in May to soften the
mud some feet or even yards away from the water. They have
then no difficulty in getting plenty of soft mud and, being
beyond the reach of all except the highest tides, the sun is able
to bake the nests hard as they are being built. I have come to
these conclusions, as ail the colonies I visited with one exception
were situated on mud so hard that it would have been impossible
for the birds to gather it up as had obviously been done when
the nests were built. At the colony where nesting operations
had begun, the nests were placed as near as possible to the dry
land in about an inch of water, but there were, at the most, only
forty nests, whereas the number of birds I had seen there only a
fortnight before must have been well over a thousand, so that
the majority of the birds were either not breeding or had
removed to a more suitable locality.
I fear I have transgressed at some length on these birds,
but so much still remains to be found out about their habits that
any information, however scanty, forms another stepping-stone
by which we may eventually hope to thoroughly understand
them, and the more one knows of these birds the more
one is able to realize how perfectly their curious modi-
fications are adapted for the life they lead. One more
point before I leave them ; these immense flocks are all
supposed to be under a leadership, fh&apos;ing and feeding in regular
order, and always leaving one of their number on the watch.
This rule did not appear to us to be by any means an invariable
one; but some vague idea of their beauty and formations may, I
think, be gained from the following quotation from my notebook,
written a few hours after seeing them.
I had been watching at a distance an immense flock of 700
or 1,000 feeding, preening, and wading about, and, desiring a

closer inspection, had approached to within 20 yards of the
nearest bird when I stumbled, and thus gave them the alarm.
" As soon as they saw me they all bunched up together,
their long necks stretched up as high as possible, and all I could
see was a mass of living scarlet streaks. Although I remained
absolutely quiet, the birds would not settle down again ; at first
four or five, then the layer about four deep nearest me, then the
next layer, and so on and so on, slowly rose expanding their jet
black wings and displaying, as they did so, the pink of their
backs and the gorgeous scarlet of their under wing-coverts.
Thus they went slowly filing off in a long irregular column till
not one was left, and, as they wended their way across the sky,
one saw first the contrast of black and scarlet till it gave place to
an intermittent line of red, gradually fading away in a pink haze
on the eastern horizon. Such a blaze of moving colour, set in the
deep blue of a tropical sky in the light of the afternoon sun,
forms a spectacle of natural beauty which cannot be surpassed."
The margins of the lagoons and rock}&apos;&apos; shores of the
islands are populated by large cosmopolitan flocks of waders ;
many of them, like the Grey Plover, Turnstone, Sanderling, etc.,
being common English species; others, such as the Yellow-
shanks, Red-breasted Snipe, and Willett, belong to the shores of
America, the last-named, however, being a resident in many
parts of the Bahamas. Finally, we have the Black-necked
Stilt, a local and somewhat scarce wader belonging to the sub-
tropical regions of the world, and which nests sparingly by a few
of the lagoons. This last is a very noisy bird and, when
disturbed, flies round and round, uttering loud and shrill cries
not unlike the call of the Redshank.
We must now leave the lagoons and turn our attention to
the isolated rocks and Cays which are scattered about throughout
the group. In the early part of the winter they are absolutely
devoid of bird-life, but towards February many of them are
resorted to as breeding stations by large flocks of Frigate Birds
and Boobies. I was not fortunate enough to meet with any
Frigate Bird colonies, although individuals may constantly be
seen high up in the air. At Abaco, where I was staying for a

Mr. J. L. Bonhote,
short time, there is a large pool of fresh water, and on most
mornings, flocks of these birds, in which the males greatly out-
numbered the females, used to come and splash about like
Swallows, never settling on the water, but dashing into it and
rising again at once. This would be repeated a few times and
then the flock would gradually make off again, slowly soaring
round in ever increasing circles till they became lost in the
distance. This was in March, during the early part of the
breeding season, the nearest colony being about 40 miles away.
My first visit to inhabited Cays took place early in May, and I had
them under fairly close observation for about a fortnight. Three
species of Terns were breeding on the Cay, viz. : The Noddy,
Sooty, and the Bridled, and, on my first arrival, Royal, Sandwich,
and Lesser were also seen there, but apparently not breeding.
Although the island was at the utmost half a mile long by a
cpiarterof a mile broad, each species had its particular distribu-
tion : the Sooty, which was perhaps the most abundant, nested
chiefly in colonies where the prickly pear was not more than a
foot in height, and, in such a place, the eggs would be crowded
together hardly a couple of feet apart ; besides these, under
the bushes all over the island, would be found scattered
nests, more often in groups together but sometimes singly. The
Sooty makes no nest whatever, merely laying its single egg on the
bare rocks ; in only one case, out of the many thousands I must
have seen, did I find more than one egg in a nest, but in this
case the eggs were so dissimilar that I expect them to have been
the produce of different birds.
In the more open places the birds all sit fairly close,
allowing an approach to within three or four feet, but under the
cover of the bushes they were much tamer, and allowed them-
selves to be taken off the nest without attempting to fly away.
The Soot} ? Tern lays its eggs in the middle of May about a
fortnight later than the Noddy Tern.
This latter was, next the Sooty, the most numerous
inhabitant of the rock, and their nests were found scattered
about everywhere, the majority being on the ground under the
bushes. Like the Sooty, it only lays a single egg, and, when on
the ground, makes no real nest, but collects a few small stones

with which it forms a rough cup. Many nests, however, were
placed on the bushes and were quite large structures composed
of a heap of twigs and dead vegetable matter, piled up with no
attempt at interweaving or of making a solid structure, and on
the top of this pile, as lining, were generally placed a few of the
small stones, as used when nesting on the ground.
Both these species frequently perch on the trees and
shrubs, and appear able to balance themselves with comparative
ease. The photograph shows one of each species on a dead
branch. The Sooty Tern is very noisy and may be heard by day
as well as by night as they hover, like flies, over the island;
towards dusk, however, appeared to be their chief feeding time
when most of the birds, except those actually engaged in the
duties of incubation, would fly out to sea. During the day, most
of the Sooties would spend their time sitting in flocks at the
margin of the vegetation, some three or four yards from the edge
of the rock ; the Noddies, on the other hand, would sit on the
outermost edge of the rock or on ledges down to the sea level.
The third species of Tern breeding on the Cay was the
Bridled Tern (.S', anostheata&apos;), a bird very similar in appearance
to the Sooty but smaller and greyer. These birds breed about
the same time as the Sooties, but place their single egg under-
neath an overhanging ledge on the edge of the sea, or even two
or three feet down a hole with an aperture barely large enough
to admit one's hand. These birds were much scarcer than
either of the other two species, and the majority w r ere found
breeding on a bare rock absolutely destitute of vegetation, and
inhabited almost entirely by themselves. No mention need be
made of the other species, as they were not breeding, and merely
used the rocks as resting places.
Three other kinds of birds are found on these Cays ; firstly,
the Tyrant or King Bird ( Tdominicensis) which arrives about
May, and nests on the low bushes in some numbers ; secondly,
the White-crowned Pigeon which is found sparingly on any Cay
on which there is a bush of sufficient size to bear the nest, but on
many of the Cays they nest by thousands, flying to their feeding
grounds, often over 20 or 30 miles of ocean, twice daily. There

is a curious and superficial resemblance between the Pigeons and
the Noddies, so much so that at a distance in the glare of the sun
one has to look twice to make sure to which species the bird
belongs; this resemblance is curiously enough augmented by a
habit of the Noddies of taking what, for want of a better term, I
would call " nuptial flights." These flights are undertaken by a
pair of birds, and consist of a very rapid and sharp flight high
up in the air with sudden alterations in its course which very
greatly resembles that of the Pigeon. I am not of course
suggesting any possible mimicry, which I think in this case very
improbable, but merely noting a curious coincidence.
There remains but one more species to be noted on these
Cays, namely the Dusk}&apos;- Shearwater (P. auduboni) known locally
as the " Pimblico." Although on some of the Cays these birds
swarm during the breeding season yet I never saw one of its own
free will, and one might well spend the whole breeding season on
the Cays without being aware of its presence. It nests in holes
and recesses of the rocks generally far in and out of sight, but
sometimes under the thick matted plants or under the centre of
some prickly pear. Before the single egg is laid both birds occupy
the hole, but,when incubation commences, one bird only is found.
In the majority of cases the male bird was found incubating
during the day, but there did not appear to be any invariable
rule. During incubation they sit very close, allowing themselves
to be lifted off the egg, but not without many protests of a
forcible nature from their powerful and sharp-pointed bill; in
fact when caught they are extremely pugnacious and fight and
bite at anything within reach, even if it be one of their own
fellow comrades. When the young is hatched they do not brood
it like a hen, but sit beside it for the first three or four days, after
which, during the daytime at all events, the chick is left to
itself.
As soon as the young is hatched they will not remain by it
if disturbed, but scuttle away to the farthest end of the hole or
even make their way out by another entrance and, when free, run
along with shuffling gait to seek shade and shelter, but never, so
far as my experience went, would they take to the wing unless

and consists of nearly the same sound uttered two or three
times, with an expiration and inspiration alternately. In
coloration the adults are very similar to the Manx Shearwater
being of a dull black above with whitish underparts. The young
are pale slate grey with lighter underparts and a large circular
patch of grey on the vent; they are just as pugnacious as their
parents and utter a soft peeping note not unlike that of a newly-
hatched chicken.
Sncli are my notes on the principal species met with in
these islands, although from paucity, or lack of experience, a few
important species such as the Parrot and the Quail have had to
be entirely omitted ; I have, however, brought home some living
specimens of both species, and I shall hope to have something
to say about them on a future occasion.
When seeing foreign birds in their native wilds, one
cannot help wondering that any of them can be successfully kept
in the aviaries of a northern clime, where every surrounding is so
totally at variance with those to which they have been accustomed
for generations, and, if these articles enable aviculturists to better
appreciate the needs and surroundings of their feathered
captives, they will have fulfilled their purpose.

TRAGOPANS IN CAPTIVITY.

hast year I recorded elsewhere how my Tragopans (Cabot's
and Temmiuck's) had bred in my Pheasant enclosure, and how, in
each case, the eggs were placed at some height from the ground
in an old Wood Pigeon's nest. I had three clutches of eggs laid
this year. The first was by a Cabot hen (not the same one
which bred last year). She laid her two eggs in a pigeon's nest
about Sft. up in a spruce tree. She was watched lining the nest
with dead twigs which she broke off the neighbouring branches,
adding to the original structure considerably. These eggs were
clear, as I had no adult male of that species at the time.

On Tragopans in Captivity.
Later on a Teuuninck laid two eggs in another Pigeon's
nest. These also failed to hatch in the incubator, being unfertile.
The third clutch of eggs, again two in number, were laid
by another Temminck's Tragopan, on an artificial platform,
which we had fixed up in a yew tree, 8ft. from the ground.
Two young birds were hatched in the incubator, and one was
reared ; the other getting damaged by an accident and dying.
The survivor is doing well, and is evidently a male.
In the last three seasons I have now had six clutches of
eggs, laid by four different individual Tragopans (two Cabot's and
two Temmiuck's). In each case the eggs were laid in a Pigeon's
nest, or on a platform resembling one, from 8ft. to 14ft. from the
ground. Each of these clutches contained only two eggs. It
certainly looks as if the habit of the Trogopans (at least of the
two species under notice) was to nest off the ground, and to lay
small clutches.
The flight feathers of the young Tragopan chick are
extraordinarily developed when it leaves the shell, and the bird
is very active and independent. Bearing this in mind it causes
no surprise to find that the egg is of unusual size, and it might
be difficult for the bird to find a tenantless nest capable of
containing a larger number of eggs. This practice of nesting in
a tree, coupled with the extraordinary activity of both the
juvenile and the adult in trees (I recorded, last year, how the
young Cabot Tragopans of a few days' old flew from perch to
perch in the wire run of the foster-mother, like young Thrushes
or Robins), suggests the thought that in its native haunts the
Tragopan has to use its wits to escape from ground enemies of
some particularly destructive type. We find little recorded of
the breeding habits of the various Tragopans. They appear from
description to be excessively difficult to flush or even to see ;
and most of the examples, dead or alive, sent to Europe would
seem to be netted or snared by natives.

By John Sergeant.
The ruralizing of towns by the gradual advance of bird
life from the country is an interesting study, and one to which I
have devoted some attention in the locality in which I live.
Southport, unlike many other towns, has been blessed by
far-seeing land-owners, who have made it a rule that each house
should occupy a certain area of land, and, as a consequence, most
of the gardens are large and the houses stand back from the
street, some of them embosomed amongst trees and shrubs. It
would, therefore, perhaps be conveying a wrong impression to
such of our members who do not know the town to designate it
as such, when the general idea conveyed by the term is one of
busy crowded thoroughfares, rows of shops, and terrace houses,
abutting close upon the street, and a smoke laden atmosphere ;
whereas here we have wide streets, the principal one planted
with trees, nearly all bordered by trees in the gardens on each
side, with privet hedges, grass lawns and flower borders galore,
and despite this a population of over 60,000. It is really a suburb,
but a suburb without the contaminating proximity of a city.
This explanation and little digression are necessary to
what I am about to say. About twenty-four years ago, when I
first began to take an interest in birds, in my school boy rambles,
I used to notice 011 the outskirts of Southport and Birkdale (its
sister township) such birds as Thrushes, Blackbirds, Robins,
Tits, Hedge Sparrows, etc., among the Starlings and Sparrows,
which we always have with us, and occasionally an odd bird or
two in the town itself; but year by year as the trees grow and the
hedges get thicker I find that there are more of them, and they
become bolder, penetrating farther and farther into the centre of
the town. On several mornings this year, on my walk down to
business, I saw or heard Blackbirds, Thrushes, Robins, Blue

Tits, Oxeye Tits, Cole Tits, Wrens, Starlings, a Bullfinch,
Chaffinches, Chiffchaffs, Hedge Sparrows, Green and Brown
Linnets, Swallows, Wagtails, and, as a climax, a lovely Willow
Wren and a Garden Warbler, both of the latter in the centre of
the town amongst the noise of the traffic. The Thrushes and

Mr. John Sergeant,
Blackbirds seem oblivious of street traffic ; they sing away over
the hissing electric wire of the trams as if they were in the heart
of the country. And the most surprising circumstance is that
the majority of these birds are not merely travellers or country
cousins come in for the day, they are residents and breed here,
and many of them winter with us.
From the frequency with which some of the birds I have
mentioned visit my garden during the breeding season, I know
that their nests cannot be far away ; and a reverend neighbour of
mine in his large vicarage garden has many a nest, the owners of
which waken me frequently by their burst of song almost before
daylight. A pair of Missel Thrushes spent the whole of the
spring and summer in the neighbourhood, and I could make a
very good guess in whose garden their nest was built.
Within ten minutes' walk of my house in the gable of a
house that has been standing empty for some time, and within
twenty yards of the street, a pair of white Owls have reared a
brood for two seasons. Every night, just on the stroke of nine,
during the summer, standing on the steps in front of the house,
I could see one of the birds floating up the street and passing
close over my head, when I could discern the bent neck and
head, and large moving eyes, as he scanned every inch of ground
he passed over; he would turn sharply round a cherry tree, fly
between the house and the vicarage, and so disappear. I have
watched this many times ; he always came from the same
direction and at the same time, and invariably turned between
the two houses, and, when I have not been waiting for him, I have
heard his call--I will not call it a screech, as I consider it a libel
on the bird--as he passed. I have often wondered what he found
for his family in the many gardens he passed over each night.
I never once saw him " stoop," although I have met him in
other localities, but that was perhaps because he saw I was
watching. One night he happened to be gliding up the street
when a tram was coming down, and I was interested to see
whether its rattle and lights would scare him, but he kept on his
smooth glide and did not deviate from his usual pathway, as if he
had the greatest contempt for modernity in the shape of a noisy
tram.

Cuckoos too, during the summer, are heard and seen
frequently, but more especially in the parts where there are the
largest and most secluded gardens.
Jackdaws are very busy about the Church spires in the
early spring, but whether they actually breed in the town I have
not ascertained, though I am inclined to think they do.
One can draw many conclusions in explanation of this
feathered invasion, but perhaps, in our ignorant groping after
the truth, none of them would prove to be the right one. Are the
birds becoming more numerous each year through the operation
of the Wild Birds' Protection Act, and, finding the surrounding
country contains as many birds as there is food for, they are
thus impelled to seek fresh fields ? It cannot be that here
amongst human-kind they find fewer natural enemies. It is true
we have no stoats, weasels, or marauding rats, and other vermin
to rob their nests and destroy their young, but we cannot be said
to be without cats, and where is the cat, however well fed at
home, that will not spend the greater portion of its time
prowling beneath hedges, and lurking amongst shrubberies on
the chance of getting a fat young Thrush or Blackbird or
Starling, not even despising a Sparrow.
Burroughs, the American ornithologist, and one of our
most fascinating writers on birds and bird life, says that birds
love the vicinity of human habitations. He relates how in one
of his excursions he penetrated into the American wilderness,
miles from any settlement, and how struck he was by the com-
parative scarcity of bird life, and how disappointed he felt, as he
was expecting to find amongst the quiet woodland glades, almost
untrodden by the foot of man, a kind of bird paradise, such an
abundance of bird life in fact as he had never seen in the
vicinity of the towns he had lived near.
If such a bird lover as Burroughs advances such an
opinion, surely we are justified in adopting it in this instance as
one explanation of the increase of birds in Southport and
Birkdale, and, inasmuch as the explanation is flattering to our
vanity to think that the birds return the affection some of us
lavish upon them, it will be all the more agreeable.

Rev. C. D. Farrar,
But, nevertheless, I should be very much interested to
learn from other members whether they have noticed anything
similar, and what they think is the reason of it. I am aware
that many comparatively rare birds make the Parks in the heart
of London their home, but the gigantic size of some of these
open spaces makes them almost as rural as the country itself,
although surrounded by a teeming population. * f
A MODERN NOAH.
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
King Solomon tried hard to bring all the beasts together
by opening a Zoological Gardens at Jerusalem : but before he
was able to complete his plan he unfortunately died ; and as
neither Rehoboam nor Jeroboam inherited his scientific tastes,
the contents of the Gardens escaped from Jerusalem at the
earliest opportunity, and went back to their respective homes.
Since that day several attempts have been made by public
bodies and private enterprise to bring together meetings of the
wild beasts of the earth and the fowls of the air. One of the
most successful of these modern enterprises is the work of one
of our members, the Rev. B. Hemsworth, of Monk Fryston Hall,
Yorkshire. All who have seen his splendid collection of birds
and beasts will allow that he is no unworthy successor of the
Wise King of Jerusalem. To visit Monk Fryston is far better
than to go to the London Zoo. Here you will find birds that the
Gardens know nothing of ^ ; and all are in the perfection of
beauty, and enjoy almost perfect liberty 7 .
* In many cases, perhaps in the majority of cases, birds come to the localities where
they are allowed to nest undisturbed. Where the nests are protected, the loss of an
occasional brancherby cats will not affect them to the same extent.-- K. P.
+ I thinjc there can be no doubt that the increase of birds in towns and suburbs is
chiefly due to the constant destruction of woods, commons, and waste lands by the owners,
and the conversion of the lands into building-plots. In undisturbed parts of the country,
birds are numerous as aforetime; but undoubtedly many birds now build in our gardens
which formerly were confined to the country. I believe a pair of Lesser Wliitetliroats
nested in a crimson may-tree in my garden this year, the parents were constantly to be
een, and later they were accompanied by four young ones.--A. G. Butler.
J We should be glad to know the species that are unknown at the Zoo.-- Kd

After visiting the aviaries at Fryston you will feel like
Stainer in the " Lost Chord," weary and ill at ease--weary
because you have walked hundreds of miles, and ill at ease
because you have seen so many birds you covet but have not.
First of all, a word about Mr. Hemsworth himself. He is
a well preserved man of middle height and robust form, who can
still run a race with the swift and come off conqueror. He is of
course wealthy, and enthusiastic on all his creatures, and never
tired of showing his treasures to others. His motto concerning
his marvellous collection ought to be, if it is not, "Non sibi, sed
gregi " : not for himself, but for the public. Unless you have
been to Monk Fryston and seen for yourself, you will feel like
the Queen of Sheba--the half has not been told you.
To see Fryston properly you want a long summer day.
On entering the grounds you are beset by dangers. A Sikka
stag disputes your way, with horns as sharp as needles, and if
you have not a good thick stick, he will think nothing of laying
you low, even with the ground : he did so with the vicar's
daughter not so long ago. Having passed this first danger, y 7 ou
encounter a second--a fierce and bellowing Rhea will next
dispute your path, and unless you beat him right sore, he will
break your leg with a blow of his foot. If you succeed in
escaping these perils, there are the Llamas to pass, who spit at
you with supreme contempt, but otherwise let you alone. You
now realise St. Paul's statement, " in perils oft." Mr. Hemsworth
assures you that all the brutes are absolutely 7 harmless ; but I
always notice that he gets behind me, and advises a good thick
stick for the passage! !
Arrived at the aviaries, y T ou see such a wealth of birds
that you hardly 7 know where to begin. The first building is
some thirty 7 feet long and nine feet wide, divided into four
compartments.
In the first are Yellow Budgerigars, a pair of Melodious
Finches, a pair of Brazilian Sparrows, and a Garrulous Honey 7 -
eater from Australia--these, except the Budgerigars, are all
exceedingly 7 rare birds.
In the next division are a magnificent pair of Brown's

Parrakeets, generously lent by tlie Honble. Walter Rothschild :
they have laid eight eggs this 3 r ear. With them is a very rare
bird, an Olive Oriole from Australia, something like our Missel
Thrush, and a magnificent songster. *
In the third division are American Catbirds, Dyals from
India, a lovely pair of Blue - shouldered Tanagers, a lot of
Chinese Zosterops, and several others I forget.
In division four are the gems of the collection : the
loveliest pair of Manycolours I ever set eyes on. With them
are Blue-throated Hanging Parrakeets, Red-headed Hanging
Parrakeets--all most rare : Lineolated Parrakeets, Bibfinches,
Ruficaudas, Australian Crimsonfinches, Yellow-headed Sparrows,
Brazilian Sparrows, White-throated Finches, Pileated Finches,
and a host of others; also a pair of Musky Lorikeets that feed
entirely on honey, and are the picture of health.
We pass on next to the Parrakeet aviaries, about eighteen
in number;

Walking back across the park about a mile, we come to
the heated aviary. Here the birds are arranged in big cages.
In the first is a splendid Talking Eclectus : his neighbours are
Hanging Ceylonese Parrakeets, New Zealanders, and a lot of
small fry. If you don't look out you will have your hat torn off
by one of the many Macaws hanging on swings from the rafters.
The rarest of these is a splendid pair of the Green Military
Macaw.
Next we notice a splendid pair of Sliamas, an Indian Tree
Pie, and a gorgeous Long-tailed Glossy Starling. In a cage on
the floor are a Tricolour Amazon, a Cuban Amazon and a Red-
fronted Amazon. A Blue Barbet catches the eye: Bare-eyed
Cockatoos, Nasicals, a grand pair of Salmoncrests, and two
lovely Leadbeaters. In a large cage is a host of little birds,
such as Parrot Finches, Whydalis, Nonpareils, Indigoes, a Yellow-
breasted Robin, and a host of others. The noise is, to put it
mildly, trying to the nerves; and the heat reminds one of
Central Africa, so I do not linger long.
In the private room of the manager, Mr. J. Levitt, is a
splendid pair of talking Grey Parrots, true cock and hen. They
can sing like almost any bird I ever heard.
I have enumerated a lot of birds : it would be difficult
to name a bird that is not at Monk Frystou. All are in the
pink of condition and reflect high credit on "Johnny." Johnny
tells me plaintively sometimes that his life is but " labour and
sorrow," and that he does not know what " rest " means. I do

not believe him, for lie looks the picture of health, and is beloved
of all the fair !
When I say that the lovely grounds of Monk Fryston are
always open free to the public, I think I have said enough to make
many determined where to spend their next Bank Holiday. Mr.
Hemsworth is the essence of good nature, and he is never so
happy as when, like Cook, he is " personally conducting "
a party round his place. Sometimes he says to me quite
wistfully, " Do you think anyone has a better collection of birds
than mine?" And I feel I am speaking only the truth when I
say " No."
Mr. Hemsworth, in addition to his "small collection" of
birds, has a capital lot of poultry ; millions of rabbits, at any
rate a good lot; pigeons galore; a pet monkey, a beast to be
avoided ; Persian cats ; and one of the best collections of water-
fowl I ever saw.
To anyone who is anxious as to " whereto spend a happy
day," I would reply, "Go to Monk Fryston, and you will not be
disappointed."

I will now give a short note on each kind of Dove or

THE TRIANGUEAR-SPOTTED PIGEON.
Columba g 7 iinea.
Some years ago I had an offer from a dealer, of a " Fruit
Pigeon" for ten shillings. It turned out to be a Triangular-
spotted Pigeon. The bird was a hen, so I wrote to the Zoo to
see if they could supply me with a cock, as I knew that this

pigeon had been bred there. Fortunately they had a bird to
spare. These pigeons never nested whilst I had them, though I
used to hear the male making a most singular cooing--more like
the barking of a small dog than a sound made by a bird.
This pigeon I found very quiet and good-tempered toward
the other doves in the aviary, but it is far too large to keep in
anything but a large space. I11 colour the Triangular-spotted
Pigeon is chiefly ashy-grev. The spots of white from which it
takes its name are very distinctly marked on the wings. There
is a patch of bare red skin round the eyes ; the irides and feet are
also red ; the neck reddish, the tips of the feathers being bifid.
The sexes seem almost the same in colouring, though
my cock was a thicker looking bird than the hen.
Habitat : Africa and several other parts of the globe. It
is very destructive to the crops in its native land.

This is such a very well known bird that no description of
it is necessary, for everyone knows its creamy coat and black
collar, but individual specimens vary, and some birds I have
had were much prettier than others. It is worth from one and
six to two and six a pair. I have a flight of these doves
flying loose in the garden. They always roost, summer and
winter, in the same trees, and twice a day come, as regularly as
clock-work, up to the front of the house to be fed. They all
begin to assemble as the tea hour draws near, and, being very
punctual birds, if the proper time is past, and no tea has
appeared, they all fly down together to the orchard, where they
know that at that hour the}' will probably find my birdman, to
remind him and escort him back to the feeding-place. The
moment his steps tend in that direction, they all leave the
Blenheim orange tree, where they have been waiting, and form
a joyous advance guard, leading the way to the house. I put up
a cote for these doves, but they one and all despised it. Many of
them are killed by cats, or stolen, and several times they have
flown against the plate-glass windows with great force, and

as a foster-parent, and several times when a pair of rare doves

own eggs, and after I had put the other eggs in their place she
would give them a little tuck in with her beak, as if to help me.
Once I bred some beautiful hybrids with a hen Barbary and
a cock British Turtle Dove, and one of these hybrids (after
I had parted with it) bred in turn with another hybrid, a
Barbary-Necklace.
Almost every spring I find voting Barbary Doves deserted
by their parents in the garden. It is no use trying to get
another pair to take to one of these poor little things, for when
it runs to them for food it only meets with rebuffs. So then I
have no other course left but to "bring them up by hand," like
poor little Pip in "Great Expectations." It is not a difficult
task, though hardly a pleasant one, but one cannot see the little
bird starve, which it would do if help were not given it.
THE HALF-COLLARED TURTLE.
Tiutur semitorquatus.
This is a very fine, well-shaped dove, the chief fault
being that it is too large for a small aviary. In colour it is a rich
vinous pink, shading into drab on the back and wings. The
lorehead is whitish grey--this being more distinct in the bird
that I take to be the male. The eyes are orange, and a broad
black collar goes half-way round the back of the neck. I had a
pair of these doves sent me, with four other kinds, from Africa
last March. The}&apos; began to nest in May and have been doing so
practically ever since. Both doves are excellent parents, and
are a strange mixture of boldness and timidity. They were
constantly being driven off from one part of the aviary by a
Necklace Dove (a bird much smaller in size) yet, on the other hand,
they beat off with their wings one of my large Masked Parrakeets
when he was climbing the wire to see if they had any eggs to
dispose of. " Jack " has held them in respect (if not in affection)

ever since. Alas ! that so lovely and charming a bird as the
Masked Parrakeet should have this grave fault. Yet so it is, both
my birds are as bad as any schoolboy in their search for fresh
eggs.
I do not know the worth of the Half-collared--as I have
never bought any through a dealer--but as I have never (that I
remember) seen them advertised for sale, they cannot, I think, be
very common, and I should value them at twelve shillings and
sixpence the pair.

Turtur senegalensis.
This is a very sweet little African Dove. I11 size it is
midway between a Zebra Dove and a Barbary; it varies, though,
very much in size. Its general colour is bright vinous red, and
ash grey on the back. It has a collar (like the Necklace Dove)
the feathers being tipped with black and having the appearance
of small checks. In the Necklace, however, the collar is round
the back of the neck, in the Senegal round the front. This dove
is very dainty, and soon gets tame, and breeds freely in an aviary.
The young ones are also ash grey and vinous, but not so bright
as in the old birds, though they soon get the adult plumage. I
have bred some hybrids with a lien Senegal and cock Necklace,
and the young ones were handsome birds. The value of the
Senegal is about fifteen shillings a pair, though I confess I paid
twenty shillings for mine, but I bought them in ignorance of their
real value. However, they have been a very good pair, so one
must not complain. It is not a bad plan to study the weekly sale
list in the Feathered World , even if you are not actually wanting
any birds, and in this way one can learn the prices, and at what
time of year they are lowest.

and lacks the white in the face. I have found this dove per-
fectly harmless towards others of its tribe, indeed rather timid
than otherwise. It seems somewhat susceptible to cold, and once
I found one of my cocks moaning and almost unconscious on the
aviary floor one bitter morning. The poor thing could not
stand, and I hurried with it to my heated aviary, put it on the
warm pipes, and gave it brandy and water. Gradually it ceased
moaning and could hold up its head, and in a few hours was
cpiite recovered. In the birds' medicine chests, which should be
in every aviary, it is as well to always keep a small quantity of
brand}&apos;. It may be wanted for a bird in a great emergency--
when delay might mean loss of life to the sufferer.

This bird is very like the well-known Aurita Dove, but
has much more metallic reflection ou the neck than the latter
bird. I bought my pair as Auritas, and they cost sixteen
shillings, but I am nearly sure they are Bronze-necked.* The
cock is a lovely chestnut brown and pinkish vinous on the breast,
shading into white. The back of the neck is very metallic, and
in the sunshine iooks like polished brass with violet reflections.
This dove is of short and plump build, and always looks smooth
and in good condition. I found my cock bird terribly quarrel-
some with other doves. He even carried it so far as to wish to
retain the monopoly of the trap cage for himself and his wife,
refusing to allow the other doves to enter--which, as he was not
the bird I wanted to catch, was rather hard on me as well as ou
them. The note of this dove is a very mournful " liaa, haa,"
repeated five times. The hen is very like the cock, but the neck
is not so bright.

Bird Notes from the Zoological Gardens. 109
Narrow black lines cross the wings, and on the top of the head
is an upright crest of very fine feathers, which look as if the}&apos; had
been wetted and brushed all together into a point. The bird can
lower this crest at will, and I have noticed it frequently does
this when angry, or preparing to attack another bird. The young
birds are very pretty little things, and have tiny crests even
when in the nest. When the Crested Dove alights on a bough it
raises the tail straight up and then drops it again. I have found
this pigeon rather tiresome with other doves in the nesting
season, but I have only had experience with two specimens. It
is a very beautiful bird however, and well worth keeping. In
size it is rather larger than a Barbary. My pair of crested
pigeons had at one time a perfect mania for sitting--and sitting
well--on other doves' eggs. Nor were they content with one
nest, but each took a separate one. At last I took them away,
and gave them a little aviary to themselves, and here they
brought up several young ones. The Crested Pigeon has a sort
of barking coo, like "* whuff, whuff," and when angry they make a
snapping noise (rather like an owl) with their beaks.

VARIATION IN BIRDS.
Mr. Frank Finn sends us a re-print, from The Journal op the
Asiatic Society of Bengal, of a paper from his pen on this subject,
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.998377" page_id="10284200"  page_num="Page 111" year="" vol="">
in which he notes many curious and interesting cases of
birds varying from the normal state. Variation in structure is
rare, but a common Quail ( Coturnix communis&apos;), obtained in the
Calcutta Bazaar, possessed five toes on each foot like a Dorking
fowl.
Birds with abnormally-coloured plumage are not par-
ticularly uncommon, and Mr. Finn tells 11s of many instances
of departure from the ordinary in this direction. We are told
that a yellow variety of the common Ring-necked Parrakeet
(.Palccornis torquata) is not rare ; and a case is mentioned in
which a pair of normally-coloured wild birds constantly
produced a yellow brood.
In captivity birds are not liable to variation to the extent

to which ornithologists generally give them credit, but several
cases are noted, some of which, such as the loss of the red on
the head and breast of the Linnet and Redpoll, are well-known
to all keepers of British birds.
Domestication is also responsible for the white form of the
Java - Sparrow, and white and pied forms (Bengalese) of the
Sharp-tailed Finch (Uroloncha striata ). We perfectly agree
with Mr. Finn that there is no reason for supposing the latter
birds to be hybrids.
Instances of variation in disposition, taste and habits are
well-known to all students of living birds.

BiRD NOTES.
We are pleased to hear that the Corporation of Stockport have decided,
at the suggestion of our member, Mr. Bouskill, to introduce an aviary into
their Vernon Park. The North-east side will be devoted to members of the
Crow family; in the centre will come Parrakeets and the larger finches, and
the south end will be used for the smaller finches, mostly foreigners. We
wish other towns would follow the good example set by .Stockport.
A small consignment of the pretty little Varied, or Red-crowned
Lorikeet (Ptilosclera versicolor), which inhabits Northern and Western
Australia, has recently reached this country, and there is little doubt that
these are the first examples of this interesting species to arrive on our
shores. This small Lorikeet was separated from the genus frichoglossus by
Bonaparte, and certainly differs very materially, both in its habits and the
arrangement of its colours, from that very well-defined genus.
Gould wrote :--" Could this species be transmitted to Europe, and a
kind of food suitable to it be discovered, it would form one of the most
delightful cage-pets that has ever been introduced." Fortunately we have,
in sweetened milk-sop, a substitute for its natural food which, with the
addition of sweet grapes and other fruit, seems to suit it admirably. At
present seed is not touched.
With reference to the subject of food for Lorikeets in captivity, Mrs.
Hamilton, who recently lost a specimen of Swainson&apos;s Lorikeet ( Tticho -
glossus n over-hoilan dice) which had lived in her possession, in perfect
health, for ten years, writes :--" I can hardly sav he had any particular diet,
as I gave him freely of anything he would eat, in the way of apples, grapes,
sometimes a bit of banana, honey, sponge-cake, and what he loved better
than anything,--occasionally&amp;quot; a teaspoonful of milk. A bit of sugar was also
appreciated. As to seed, he had canary and a little hemp always in his
cage, but he lived so much out of it, and was so inquisitive, going to all
the other cages, and slipping inside to see what his friends had, that I think
he partook of a variety of seed. Latterly I fancy he took too much sun-
flower seed. I supplied green food daily when not wet flowering
grasses, groundsel, mignonette, and dandelion flowers. He always returned
to his cage to order, and made several very pretty little cries, chuckling like
a hen, and whistling a clear, long note. He loved his bath and rolled
over and over until every feather was soaked. He was a very excitable bird,
and loved to be noticed, and was jealous of any one speaking to any of his
companions. I attribute his long life to the freedom he enioyed. His last
effort was to fly over to me, in doing which he dropped lifeless."

nearly black, feet and legs grey. Local name " Papacapim,'' has a peculiar
habit of spreading its tail fan like, and a very fine singer.
No. 2. Whole of upper parts, wings, tail, and head very dark green,
under parts greenish white, bill and feet leaden. " Begordi."

primaries dark grey ; bill, dark horn ; feet and legs light brown.

No. 4. All upper parts, wings, and tail glossy black, breast and under-
parts rich dark chestnut ; bill horn, nearly black and much higher than
wide, in fact conical from side view ; feet and legs brown. " Courial." I often
think that Brazilian birds are very little known to aviculturists, and although
the majority of the seed-eaters are rather quietly coloured, many are very
fine singers and very graceful and pretty.

I make out Papacapim to be the Lined Finch (Spennophihi lineola).
Patetiva-the Plumbeous Finch ( Spermophila plumbed) ; Courial I cannot
discover. If it had a chestnut or cinnamon rump, it might possibly do for

Sir, --In the December number of the Avicultnral Magazine , just
received, I recognise with pleasure an old friend of mine, on the front
page.
The Hooded Siskin is indeed a very beautiful and most charming
little bird, but I met it only once in London, and then kept it for some
considerable time. I found that it was so very rare that I did not include it
in the list of foreign cage birds.
When I obtained the only specimen I ever saw, I found much
difficulty to name the bird twenty-five years ago.

pencil note "Calcutta."
Chrysoinitris is a terrible family name, and tristis certainly a mis-
nomer. I always thought the bird's native country was Mexico.
It astonishes me to hear of the little bird being found at a bird-
dealer's shop in Teneriffe; but strange things do happen. I met with one
of the few specimens of Gould&apos;s TEgintha picta which were ever seen in
Europe, at an East End bird-dealer's shop in a cage full of little African
finches just arrived from Marseilles, and a friend of mine brought home
from Brazil an undoubted big white Lemon-crested Australian Cockatoo.
If the red Hooded Siskin can be obtained in the Canary Islands, it is
to be hoped that the publication of the very pretty coloured plate may lead
dealers to bring the species over, for the bird would be a very welcome
addition to the small exotic finches with which aviaries are now stocked.

[The American Siskin (Chrysoinitris tristis) is a very different species
from the Hooded Siskin f C. cucullata). The former, which was the subject

EDITORIAL.
With the appearance of the one hundredth monthly
number of the Avicultural Magazine, the members may, we
think, look back with satisfaction on the progress the Society
has made, and congratulate themselves on the possession of a
journal which has done more than any other publication to
encourage scientific aviculture. As we look at the eight bound
volumes on the bookshelf, the eighth fully twice the thickness of
the first, as we notice the steady increase in the number of
members,--173 in November, 1895, and 331 at the present time,
or the number of illustrations which now appear as compared
with a few years ago, it is at once apparent that steady and sure
progress has been made. But we must not consider that we are yet
at the top of the ladder, or that, like Alexander the Great, we
have 110 more worlds to conquer; surely we are still in our
infancy ; much, very much remains to be done by aviculturists,
in the way of studying the life habits of birds.
The Natural History Museum at South Kensington
contains thousands of skins of birds, from every part of the
globe, but how much is known of the living habits, of the
plumage of the nestlings, of the changes from summer to winter
plumage, of the many little items which make the difference
between the living and the dead ? Travellers may teach us much ;
but it is left to the aviculturist to teach his fellow bird-lover--his
fellow ornithologist--many things that could not otherwise be
known. We use the term " ornithologist " advisedly, for we do not
consider that there should be a breach between the ornithologist

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
and the aviculturist; in other words the aviculturist should be
an ornithologist ; he should find out, as far as possible, all that
is known about birds, and he should study his living birds with
the object of finding out what is not known, and what cannot be
found out from dried skins or books.
In looking back over the first eight years of the Society's
life, there are two or three names that stand out prominently, and
to whom every member owes a debt of gratitude. We refer
especially to those gentlemen who were chiefly concerned in the
foundation of the Society, and who held the honorary posts of
Secretary and Editor during its first j^ears. And we need not
remind our members of the amount they owe to the present
hard-working Honorary Secretary, who has been a pillar of
strength to the Society since its birth in 1894.

THE BLUE-BREASTED WAXBILL.
Estrilda angole?isis.
By Reginald Phillipps.
When our Members open their Magazine this month, the
Centenary Number of the Society's publication, and look at the

portrait of the graceful little birds that adorn its pages, not a few
of them will exclaim, " A common Cordon Bleu ! " But if our
friends will kindly look again, those of them who are sharp will
quickly discover that the birds figured by our artist are not
Cordons, although remarkably like, and very closely related to,
our familiar little friend. I11 the Zoological Society's " List,"
the latter does not appear under the name of Cordon Bleu but as
the Crimson-eared Waxbill (E. phocnicotis) ; and here at once we
have a difference between the two species, for the male of the
Blue-breasted Waxbill lacks the well-known crimson ear-patch
which is so conspicuous on the male Cordon.
According to books, there is not any other difference in
plumage between the two species, the females being alike. I
think it was Mr. D. Seth-Smith who told me last year that he
had been comparing a skin of the female of each species, and

was unable to perceive any difference between them. For
myself I can only say that, as the birds now portrayed are the
only two I have ever kept, I hesitate to make any positive
statement as regards the live bird. Moreover, in order not to
mix the two species, I have kept them as much apart as possible,
and mostly under different conditions, especially since the cold
weather set in, so a comparison is not of much value with
foreign birds of delicate natures and brightly-coloured plumes.
Any way now, in January, both of my Blue Breasts are consider-
ably more blue than the Cordons, especially the female. The
Cordons, however, are loose in the birdroom by night and the
garden by day, and are subjected to influences adverse to
delicately tinted feathers, whereas the Blue Breasts are caged
for the winter in my dining-room. All the same, during the
summer I more than once remarked that the Blue - breasted
Waxbills had more blue about them than the Cordons.
Whilst writing on the subject of the plumage of these two
species, I cannot refrain from remarking that, in the British
Museum Catalogue of Birds, Vol. XIII. pp. 400-2, the females
of both species are described (excepting as regards the red ear-
patch) as similar to the male. I have kept and seen a great
number of Cordons, and, in my opinion, the males have always
been more blue in colour than the females. Even Dr. Stark
writes in the same disappointing strain, for, of the adult female
of Estrilda angolensis, he says, " Resembles the male in plumage,
but is a little smaller." (.Fauna of South Africa, Vol. I. p. 103).
My two birds, at an} 7 rate, plainly differ, as a glance at their
portrait will shew. During four days in June did Mr. Goodchild
work at the painting, with the birds before him in a small cage in
a good light, finishing off the painting on October 23, one of the
special points he laboured to portray being the differences
between the sexes. And not only, as may be clearly seen, is the
blue of the male of a deeper hue but it is more extended.
The following are my own notes, made at the time the two
birds were in the small cage, which I will transcribe in their
original curtness and roughness ;--" Blue of male more intense
and more extended, especially over eyes and loral region, and

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
extending much lower towards vent ; more pure on flanks,
female having good deal brown ; brown on female's neck
extends farther across throat, threatening to connect; eye
of male perhaps more red, and larger ; the bills lilac with black
tips and edges ; under side of tail looks light drab rather than
blue; male distinctly larger; on primary coverts of female,
when wings closed, several dark brown washes, not appearing
on male: brown abdomen of male (only a) narrow point
running (forward) into blue, female's being much broader."
The birds have since moulted ; and on 4th January, 1903,
I carefully examined the under parts as they were sitting
side by side on a perch close to and about on a level with my
face, the light shining well on their breasts. The brown (light
drab) on the abdomen and breast of the female was fully three
times as broad as the brown on the male, and extends distinctly
higher up towards the throat. In this respect, at least, the
statements made that the sexes are alike are wanting in
accuracy.
Tike the Museum Catalogue, Stark declares the only
difference between the two species to be the crimson ear-coverts
of the male Cordon. But the following differences would seem
to be not entirely apocryphal :--Bod}&apos; of bill of Blue Breast
lilac instead of crimson ; iris reddish-hazel instead of yellowish ;
legs and feet pale or pale brown instead of flesh-coloured
(Butler) or reddish (Catalogue). Perhaps the Cordon may be
the smaller bird.
The song of the Blue-breasted Waxbill, judging by my
own male (the female is said to sing, but I have not heard mine
do so), although practically the same as that of the Cordon, is
sweeter and better sustained, and the love dance of my male is
in a marked degree more boisterous; he jumps into the air
higher, and thumps down on his perch with a noise I have never
noticed in any male of the kindred species.
The Cordon is very widely distributed across Africa, but
the range of our present subject seems to be limited more or
less to the south-eastern parts of that continent.

on the Blue-Breasted WaxbilL
I think I may with advantage quote here a few words from
Dr. Stark's work:--"These beautiful little Waxbills are usually
met with in small parties, but occasionally in autumn, after the
young have flown, in very large flocks. They prefer localities
which are partly open, partly overgrown with scrub or low trees,
and are specially fond of scattered mimosa bushes, in which
they can take refuge if disturbed when feeding on the ground on
their favourite grass-seeds. When frightened they rise with a
shrill twittering to take shelter in the nearest bushes. In spring
both male and female sing not unpleasantly. Although the
adults appear to subsist entirely on grass-seeds, the young,
before they leave the nest, are fed on small grubs and insects.
The nest is invariably built in a bush, often in a low mimosa, and
is generally placed in a fork at a height of from three to eight or
nine feet. At first sight it looks like a ball of dried grass
carelessly thrown into a bush; on investigation a small side
entrance, nearly concealed by the projecting ends of grass-stalks,
may be found, leading to the interior which is smoothly and
warmly lined with finer dried grass and feathers. Three or four
eggs are laid. These are pure white, and rather round in shape.
. . . . Mr. Andersson found this Waxbill nesting in Ondongo.
A nest taken by him on the 2nd February, 1867, was constructed
of grass, and had no internal lining. It was built in a palm
bush, six feet from the ground. The eggs were five in number."
The story of my pair of Blue-breasted Waxbills is un-
eventful, and soon told. They reached the Port of London, direct
from an aviary in Natal, on 26th May, 1902, and were in my
hands before midnight. The male was good, the female less so.
On June iS they were loosed into my garden aviary, and almost
immediately commenced to build in a thorn bush, between five
feet and six feet from the ground. They were bullied by the
Double-banded Finches, and, being neither robust nor in good
condition, eventually retired, and passed the remainder of
the summer quietly, to the great advantage of their general
health. On October 21 they were transferred to a six-foot cage,
in my dining-room. After settling down, I noticed that they
were desirous of nesting, and were endeavouring to build
on the top of a travelling box; but their mode of working

Rev. F. L. Blathwayt,
shewed that they were dissatisfied. I placed a little conical
rush nest by the side of the box, and in this they built a tiny
nest. The first egg was laid on the iStli November. They had
behaved so steadily, and in such a businsss-like way, that, if
they had been left undisturbed, doubtless they would have done
their best to reproduce their kind. But here the disadvantages
under which the aviculturist with very limited accommodation
labours stepped in and upset everything. Theirs is the only
cage I have in which to winter my best Foreign Finches ; I had
left the latter as long as I dared in the garden, but soon they
flooded the Waxbills' cage and overwhelmed the nest.

A VISIT TO THE FARNE ISLANDS.
" The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl."
June 23rd, 189S, will always be a red-letter day in my
memory, for it was on that day that I was able to pay a long-
wished-for visit to the Fame Islands, those famous nurseries of
many kinds of sea-fowl.
The Oxford term was just over, and all thoughts of
' Mods ' and ' Greats ' were banished to the winds, as, on the
evening of June 22nd, I found myself, with my brother and two
college friends, on the platform of the little station of Chathill,
near the coast of Northumberland.
A drive of a few miles, during which the lights on the
Fames could be seen twinkling in the distance, brought us to
the little village of Sea Houses, where we were to stay 7 for the
night. As soon as we entered the Inn we felt we were already 7
among the birds. The walls of the little parlour were decorated
with photographs of the islands and their feathered inhabitants,
while stuffed Gulls and Guillemots and cases of birds' eggs
reminded us that we were near one of the most famous breeding
haunts of our British sea-birds. We made arrangements with

the boatmen for an early start on the morrow and then ' turned
in ' to dream of wonders in store for us.
There was no lingering in bed the next morning, and a
glance at the East convincing us that it was going to be a
glorious Summer day, we all raced away in high spirits for a dip
in the icy waters of the North Sea, and, after a somewhat
hurried breakfast, assembled at the quaint little harbour with
camera and field-glasses, some time before the appointed hour.
A few Terns were diving for their prey, and some Eider Ducks
were floating on the water, but there was little evidence that we
were within a few miles of teeming colonies of birds.
The outward voyage was slow owing to the absence
of wind, and seemed doubly so to us who were straining
our eyes at the black rocks in front, and longing to be scrambling
over their rough surface. As we approached the islands the
bird life increased. Parties of Guillemots were hurrying across
our bows, just above the waves, and many comical little Puffins,
*or 'Tammies' as the boatmen called them, were floating on the
water, hardly taking the trouble to get out of the way of our
vessel. Presently two Ganuets in immature plumage, wanderers
no doubt from the Bass Rock, flew lazily past us, apparently
gorged with fish. We steer close under the flat-topped Pinnacles
and land on a corner of Staple Island, one of the group of
Outer Fames.
There was no delay about getting ashore, and scrambling
up the rocks, we soon found ourselves in the middle of a large
colony of Eesser Black-backed Gulls (Larus fuscus). The birds
rose at our approach, filling the air with their harsh cries of
' Hoiv , how, how ,' and circled over our heads, one or two bolder
than the rest sometimes swooping down upon us if we walked
too near their eggs or young. The nests were placed on the
bare rock or among a luxuriant growth of sea-campion, and
only consisted of dry grass and weeds roughly put together.
Most of the nests contained two or three eggs, but some of the
young had already been hatched. It is found desirable to keep
down tne numbers of these Gulls, as they are inveterate robbers
of the eggs of other sea birds.

Rev. F. L. Blathwayt,
A few pairs of Herring- Gulls (Larus argentatus) were
nesting among the Black-backs, and the soft soil on the top of
the island, overgrown with sea-campion, was honeycombed with
the nesting burrows of the Puffins (Fratercula arctica). The
ground w T as constantly giving way beneath us, and we often
found that we had trodden through a Puffin's burrow the owner
of which, if ' at home,' did not appear to be very pleased, biting
fiercely with her formidable bill, if handled. Usually, however,
the sitting birds scuttled away from beneath our feet as they
heard us approach, and made off to sea, leaving in the hole
either a single, much discoloured egg, or a young bird covered
with sooty down. The sea below was dotted all over with the
odd-looking ' Tammies,' and many others were flying about in
all directions, some carrying little fish in their bills.
Just off Staple Island stand the curious flat-topped rocks,
known as the Pinnacles. We had passed close under them before
lauding, and had seen Guillemots hurrying off them in streams,
but we were hardly prepared for the sight which met our gaze
when looking down on to them from the cliffs of Staple Island.
The surface was absolutely covered with Guillemots ( Uria troile),
most of them sitting upon a single egg, laid on the bare rock,
and one could not help wondering how any more birds could
possibly find a resting place, yet many were continually coming
in from the sea, and these, alighting on the backs of their
comrades, squeezed themselves in amid a chorus of purring and
grumbling notes. It seems impossible that each bird can
know exactly where her own egg has been laid, and though
some observers say that this is the case, it would be an exceed-
ingly difficult statement to prove. Many Guillemots, finding no
room on the flat summit, had clustered on the ledges, looking
like swarms of bees, and some, finding no room even here, were
forced to leave the Pinnacles and had laid their eggs on the
cliffs of Staple Island just opposite the main colony.
On the sides of the Pinnacles and on the ledges and in
the clefts of the steep cliffs opposite, the Kittiwakes (Rissa
tridactyla ) were breeding in fairly large numbers. Their nests
were made chiefly of sea-weed and were stuck against the face
of the cliffs wherever a small ledge of rock afforded sufficient

hold. These contained one or two eggs and occasionally a
newly-hatched bird. These pretty little cliff-loving Gulls were
flying all around us and filling the air with their cries, sounding
like the words ' get-away-all ' ' get-away-ah&apos; with the accent on
the third syllable. Reluctantly we listened to their entreaties
and turned away with regret from this animated scene.
On our way back to the boat, we almost trod upon an
Eider Duck (, Somateria mollissima) sitting upon her four or five
eggs. As she left her nest she squirted over the eggs a very evil-
smelling yellowish fluid. The object probably was to keep off
enemies, but I very much doubt whether it would be successful
in keeping off the marauding Gulls which are ever on the look
out for uncovered eggs on which to make a meal. When the
watchers, who are placed on the islands to take care of the birds
during the breeding season, find an Eider Duck's nest uncovered,
they tear up some grass and scatter it over the eggs, lest they
may catch the eye of one of the rapacious Black-backed Gulls.
We found several other nests of the Eider Duck with their warm
lining of down, and one bird sat so closely that she allowed us
to stroke her back, and did not even then leave her eggs. The
birds, however, usually left if we attempted to touch them.
Leaving Staple Island and the Outer Fames, we steered
S. W. to the inner group of Islands which are two or three miles
nearer the mainland. Out to sea, the Crumstone Rock, haunted
by seals, was visible above the water ; and more to the North the
Longstone Lighthouse recalled to our minds the story of the
wreck of the ' Forfarshire,' and the heroic deed which has
immortalised the memory of Grace Darling.
We landed on one of the Wedums or Wideopens, and,
scrambling up to the top, found a small colony of Cormorants
which, the watchers told us, had only recently settled there.
Here we found a few more Eider Ducks sitting and also two
nests of the Oyster-catcher ( Hocmatopus ostraleg&apos;us), each contain-
ing three eggs. These latter birds are very wary, and it is
almost impossible to see them upon their nests. On the Inner
Wideopens an enormous colony of Arctic Terns {Sterna inacrura&apos;)
were breeding. The birds rose in front of us like a great white

Rev. F. D. Blathwayt,
cloud, and flew about, over our beads, in all directions, looking
like a shower of huge snow-flakes. It is a sight, which, when
seen for the first time, cannot fail to leave a vivid impression
on the mind. The air above seems full of the dainty little
Terns, resembling big white Swallows, and the chorus of their
cries is almost incessant; while the shingle beneath is so thickly
covered with their eggs that it is quite necessary to pick one's
way to avoid crushing them. Each bird lays two or three eggs
in a very scanty nest, sometimes quite close to high-water mark.
At the time of our visit many of the chicks had been hatched,
and were crawling about among the pebbles which they very
much resembled in colour. Occasionally a bird, leaving the
wheeling crowd above, would make a bold dash and almost
strike us, and one of the watchers showed us a scar on his head
caused by the bill of one of these little birds, which had
struck him with so much force, through his cap, as to draw blood
from the wound.
Robert Darling, another of the watchers, and a nephew of
Grace Darling, told us that there were two or three pairs of
Roseate Terns (Sterna dougal/i) nesting in the colony, and that
he could distinguish them by their harsher note ; but although
we scanned the fluttering crowd with our field glasses we were
not fortunate enough to identify this rare species.
On the Knoxes, a sandy ridge connected with the Wide-
opens at low tide, a very flourishing colony of Sandwich Terns
( Sterna : cantiaca) were breeding. It was easy to distinguish
these birds from the other Terns by their greater size. Their
beautifully marked eggs were laid in the merest pretence of a
nest, and were placed so closely together that a dozen or more
clutches could be seen at one glance. In the middle of this
colony we found four eggs of the Ringed Plover {/.Egialitis
hiaticola ) laid on the bare sand.
The common Tern {Sterna fluviatilis ) also inhabits the
islands, and probably many were breeding in the colony on the
Wideopens and Knoxes, but the majority certainly belonged to

We had by this time become almost bewildered with the
multitudes of birds we had seen, but the boatman told us that,
as the tide was low and the sea calm, we had a good opportunity
for landing on the Megstone Rock. Accordingly we steered
N.W., and soon arrived at this famous but unsavoury haunt of the
Common Cormorant {Phalacrocorax carbo&apos;). As soon as we landed
our nostrils were assailed by ' a very ancient and fish-like smell,'
and when we got among the nests, this, under the hot rays of the
sun, became almost unendurable. The surface of the rock was
painted white with guano, the accumulation of many years, and
the rotting remains of fish were strewn in all directions. Hinc
illce lacrimce. However, w r e put up with this for some time as
the colony was a large and most interesting one. The big black
birds flapped lazily out to sea on our approach and swam about
in a scattered flock near their home. The nests consisted of large
piles of dry sea-weed placed on the bare rock, and contained
pale green eggs roughly coated with lime, or newly-hatched
young. These latter were black and naked, and were, I think,
the ugliest little creatures I have ever seen. Among the
Cormorants' nests we were surprised to find two or three eggs
of the Guillemot, laid in crevices of the rock. We were glad to
leave the Cormorants in possession of their island, and to take
big draughts of pure sea air. The fishy odour, however, still
seemed to cling to us, and it w r as some time before we could get
quite free from it. Even now, when I see a Cormorant, I seem
to get a whiff of the Megstone Rock.
A steady and favourable breeze had by this time sprung
up, and so, as it was getting late, we determined to turn home-
wards. The breeze freshened just at the right time, and so,
skimming merrily over the water, we soon found ourselves once
more at the little harbour at Sea Houses, after having spent a
day among the wild sea - birds which will long live in our
memories.

THE "BEUE-HEADED" TURTLE. * {See plate).
Turtur humilis.
This very pretty little dove is not often imported, but a
few cocks were sent to England last autumn. The sexes are not
alike, and unfortunately both my birds are cocks. In colouring
the "Blue-headed" is something like the Parson-finch. It has
the same grey head, and brick-red body. A black collar goes
half round the back of the neck. It is considerably smaller
than the Senegal Dove, and seems to vary in size, for one of my
birds is much larger than the other. The Blue-lieaded Turtle
is a very gentle little bird, and it seems a pity it is not more
freely imported. Its habitat is Burma, China, the Philippine
Isles, and other places. I gave about fourteen shillings for my
two birds.
THE NECKLACED DOVE.
Turur tigrinus.
This dove has always been one of my greatest favourites;
the arrangement of its quiet colours is so beautiful, and their
blending so harmonious. The Necklaced Dove comes from
Burma. In size it is about the same as the common Barbary,
but more slender and elegant. Like many other doves the breast
is vinous ; the head is greyish, with a broad collar half-way
round the back of the neck (not in front as in the Senegal Dove)
of rich black and white feathers, giving quite the appearance of
minute checks. The back is olive brown, with a buff tip on each
feather. In my old cock these buff spots are ver\^ round and
distinct, which gives him a particularly handsome look. I have
* Known in India as the "Kuddv" Dove. Salvadori describes the female thus:
General colour pale brown, but the lower parts vinous grey where vinous red in the male;
theie is a black collar as in the male, but edged above with whitish grew"--Kt&amp;gt;.

bred many young ones, but none of them have equalled the old
bird in their markings. I have had him now for some years.
He was an imported specimen from Burma. The cock Necklaced
Dove looks the most imposing when he coos--for his fine collar
is all puffed out until you would almost think he had a ruff
round his neck My old friend has one grave fault, he is some-
what flighty and impatient over his nesting arrangements. The
hen is a pattern bird, and will never stir from the nest on any
consideration, but when the cock is taking his turn on the eggs
I sometimes think he is only too glad of an excuse to leave them
on my coming into the aviary. Young Necklaced Doves are very
pretty little things, soft drab in colour, with the most innocent
round eyes imaginable. Necklaced Doves may be had from
12s. 6d. a pair and upwards.
THE WHITE-WINGED ZEN AID A DOVE.
Melopelia leuccptera.
In the Magazine for last October I wrote a full account of
these pretty doves--so that it seems hardly necessary to say
much about them here. Their general colouring is a soft olive
brown, with a broad white band crossing the wings. The eyes are
orange surrounded with a patch of sky blue skin, which greatly
enhances their beauty. I found m3&apos;&apos; cock White-winged rather
aggressive towards other birds in the nesting season, but he
never did any real harm. He seemed to think that because the
nest was such an event to u. must be equalH so to every
other bird in the aviaiy. He Wc, i lower his head until it was
in a straight line with his body--and then make for an\ r
inoffending bird that happened to be near him, but after all this
show of fierceness he generall}&apos; quieted down, and did nothing
more than chase the other doves.&apos; 3,4 I found the White-winged
Doves steady sitters and excellent parents. Three other pairs of
doves nested in this aviary (which is 16 ft. by 6J ft.) at the
same time, namely Bleeding Hearts, Necklaces, and Senegals,
and all reared young ones successful!}&apos;. I took out several of
A male Melopelia leucoptera in our possession was such a terribly quarrelsome bird
that we were glad to despatch him to the Zoo.--E d.

the earlier broods of young birds, but found, in spite of this,
that the aviary was too full. I gave 15s. for my pair of White-
winged Doves when newly imported.
THE BLEEDING-HEART DOVE.
Phlogamas luzonica.
It is said that at one time the natives of the Philippine
Isles, where this beautiful dove comes from, used to keep its
presence there a secret, so as to retain the monopoly of it to
themselves. I have at present six Bleeding-hearts, besides two
more that I am just sending to a friend. In colour the Bleeding-
heart is ash-grey, with darker bands crossing the wings. The
crown of the head is grey, the lower part of the face and throat
pure white, the breast whitish with a patch, irregular in shape, of
blood-red feathers. So realistic is it that visitors before now
have thought the bird was hurt. The back of the neck is as
metallic and changeful as the colours in an opal, a perfect glory
of green and blue. But no description can do the Bleeding-
heart justice. It must be seen to be admired as it deserves. It
is a tame dove, and yet a very timid one, for when frightened it
will run into a corner and try, like the Ostrich, to hide its head,
long after the imagined danger is past.
There is a beautiful old legend about the Bleeding-heart.
Long ages ago the Bleeding - hearts had all snowy breasts as
white as their throats, but at the Crucifixion one settled on the
Cross, and a Roman soldier shot it with an arrow in the breast.
Ever since then the birds have worn the "bleeding heart." The
young birds are dear little creatures covered with dark chocolate
down and buff bars across the wings. They are not unlike a small
Woodcock in appearance, though the beak of course, as in all
young doves, is thick and heavy. The " heart" first appears as a
slight streak of red when the bird is a few weeks old. This dove
costs from 20s. to 25s. each bird, and is only seldom in the
market. I thought, after much trouble, I had got a pair, for they
agreed so well, but I louud out both were cocks. I then
advertised for a hen, but got no response, nothing at all, except
a letter from a lady, a complete stranger to me, asking if I had a

spare cock I would part with, as she had a hen, that had laid,
a great many eggs, and she had spent quite a small fortune in
trying to find it a mate. This letter put a bold plan into my
head. I did not want to part with either of my cocks, they were
such beauties, but I did want very much to breed this dove, So
I wrote to the lady and said, " Will you let me have your bird for
the summer, and if I can rear any young ones we will divide
them." After a few days an answer came to the effect that
"Joey" was to come to me. Her answer went on to say how
very much she valued the bird, it was such a pet, and used to let
her catch it without being frightened, and it would often come
and settle on her head. The affection she had for the bird was
evidently so genuine that I began to regret what I had done.
Suppose the bird died while with me! I began to imagine all
sorts of dreadful fates for it, and felt quite uneasy.
But in bird-keeping (as in other things) it is unwise to
make troubles before they come. "Joey&amp;quot; " arrived in March, and
from that day&amp;quot; to this she has never had a day's illness. The
Bleeding-hearts had many nests, but from various causes I have
only reared three y&amp;quot;oung ones. Two are the finest birds I have
ever seen. I wonder if it is a general rule that an aviary bred
bird is larger than a wild caught one? The third young one is
just changing from the brown plumage to the grey&amp;quot;. I have
never found the Bleeding-heart quarrelsome or tiresome with
other birds, and I have tried it with tiny&amp;quot; finches and waxbills,
and with other doves.* The Bleeding-hearts are particularly
fond of ground biscuit, and are always on the look out when I
fill their tin with a fresh supply, and begin to eat it at once.
(To be continued.)
* I found it positively dangerous to a Picui-dove (steel-barred) which had a drooping
wing and was consequently unable to escape rapidly when the large bird rushed at it.--

AVIARIES. Some Notes and Notions.
By H. C. Martin.
The aviary most to be desired, and the one with which
one is most likely to be successful in breeding birds, is no doubt
that of large dimensions where their natural surroundings can
be to a great extent reproduced and where they can be left largely
to their own devices as far as the means and material for nesting
are concerned. It is not, however, very often practicable to
build an aviary of this type, and for one such I think there must
be many, like my own, in which the birds live under conditions
which are distinctly unnatural, however suitable the}&amp;quot; may be.
For my own part, much as I would like to have my birds almost
at liberty, and to enclose a whole garden for them if I could, I
must say I think the small "artificial" type of aviary has its
advantages, and is more interesting in this way, that its inmates
must of necessity be tamer and that their goings and comings
are under closer observation. I must confess, too, to a certain
predilection for a building on " ornamental" lines as well as to a
weakness for symmetry, new paint and general spick-and-span -
ness.
One learns by experience and, simple as it may seem at
first sight to build and fit out a home for a score or so of small
birds, it is astonishing (at least, I should say, it was in my case)
how many points one may overlook or fail to foresee, and how
many more will suggest themselves from time to time. I venture
then to record a few such points as have occurred to me in my
small experience, and to make one or two suggestions for the
possible improvement of the small, "artificial" aviary, with a
view to making it most suitable for the birds and most convenient
for the owner.
When I decided to build my aviary--a little span-roof
structure, 12ft. by 8ft. by 7ft. (which, to begin with, would have
been much better split in two and built as a 24ft. " lean-to "), I
thought how nice it would look amongst that foliage three-parts
of the way down a rather long garden. So it did--in summer-

time--except that those shrubs kept off more sun than I
had expected, and seemed to attract an undue amount of
moisture. But the prospect is not quite so fair, on a January
morning say, when one has to wade down through 6 inches of
slush or, with a chisel in one hand and the kitchen kettle in the
other, set forth in semi-darkness to tackle that solid block of ice
in the water-pan, reflecting meanwhile that time and trains (and,
incidentally, hot breakfasts) are in the habit of waiting for no man.
The moral of this is that the next time I build an aviary it is
going to be rather nearer head-quarters, for the benefit both of
the birds and of their owner.
When I first started, I carefully laid out a neat little plot of
turf and planted a small bush--I forget of what kind--in the
centre. The effect was charming, and I do not think I spent
less than an hour at first in happy contemplation of the doings
of my dozen or so of small Britishers. Alas! in a week or so's
time; my poor turf! An enterprising Yellow Bunting had nipped
most of it off at the root, blade by blade, for the sake of the
juicy ends which this bird, like the Green Cardinal, is very fond
of " chewing," if one may so express it. And, as for the bush--
well! it was decidedly the worse for wear. Moral No. 2 ; unless
your aviary is very large, your birds are very few, and yourself
very, very fond of hard work, do not go in for interior decoration
of this order ; it is much better to content oneself with plain
gravel and to keep all garden work outside ; a neat flower border,
I need hardly add in passing, gives a very nice finish to an
aviary and has the merit of attracting insects.
There are gravels and gravels : one variety I have met
with has the property of being uncommonly muddy in wet
weather and uncommonly dusty in dry weather. This is the
sort to avoid, though it must be said that fine, clean gravel with
sandy particles is not easy to obtain.
I find that it does not do in a small aviary to have open
wire-work at the top; cats, or perhaps an owl, will startle
the birds at night ; up they will go towards the light, bumping
up and down like moths on the ceiling and perhaps in the morn-
ing you will find half a dozen unhappy individuals sitting

bunched up exhausted and with bleeding skulls. When this
happens, too, I find that the feathers at the base of the beak
seldom grow properly again.
At first I brought my wire-work in the outer flight down
almost to the ground level, but I soon found it desirable to put
in an Sin. edging. Feathers and building material will collect
at the bottom of wire-netting and defy all ordinary attempts at
tidying-up, while young birds, not yet able to fly, will do their
level best to commit suicide by pushing their soft, silly skulls
into all sorts of hard wiry corners. The edging prevents this
and, to some extent, keeps the rain from splashing in. It also
makes it difficult for cats to do any mischief, and more than
a few of our members can, I daresay, tell a tale of what grimalkin
is capable of doing even through small wire-work.
My aviary was constructed with rather too many cross
framings inside ; this I should avoid another time in order to do
away with the numerous corners where dust and dirt are sure to
collect.
Canary-seed husk is most untidy stuff and cannot possibly
be swept up from a gravel floor, i.e., unless you sweep up the
gravel as well. Most birds will sit and crack their seed on or by
the food-pan and, this being so, it occurred to me to fit in the
outer part of my aviary a large, open, detachable " feeding box,"
I suppose I may call it, in which the seed-pans are placed and
which catches nearly all the debris, so that it ma) r easily be
removed. I have endeavoured to illustrate such a box (Fig. 1)
which, if I built another aviary, I should make of stoutish wood
and place outside, providing it with a door as at A B, hinged at
the top so as to close by its own weight, and. which could be
provided with a lock. This would save much dodging in and out
and avoid disturbing birds nesting possibly close by. Ordinary
sardine-tins, thoroughly cleansed and with the rough edge
neatly hammered down, or better still, with a stout iron wire
soldered round the rim, will be found to make very suitable
holders for the different kinds of food. Disguise them with an
outside coat of hard enamel-paint and no one will detect their
humble origin.

Half the pleasure in keeping birds is, to my mind, to have
them tame and confiding, and for this reason I have a great
objection to the catching-net, always preferring to quietly trap a
bird if I can possibly spare the time--and there are some, how-
ever tame, which are wary enough to take a deal of trapping.
For this purpose I would suggest using the feeding-box I have
described, fitting it with a quietly-closing spring netting like
that of a bird trap. A light wire-work frame could be attached
above it to close the opening left when the box is temporarily
taken away.
A rather good way to give green food is to hang it up in
an ordinary glass jar containing water. It will thus keep fresh
throughout the day, and if it is tied in a bunch the birds cannot
pull it to pieces and litter it about the place. (I merely mention a
glass jar because it permits you to see how much water you
aren't pouring over your slippers). I have tried to illustrate such
a jar (Fig. 2) and one way of suspending it; the string should
be fairly stout, or Goldies and Siskins will soon tease it to a
thread and possibly let the whole thing down with a run.

Mr. H. C. Martin,
For perches I use principally small branches placed
horizontally fairly high up, out of the way of one's head, and
more or less on the same plane so that they do not get soiled
too quickly. They cost nothing, are easy to replace, and the
birds seem to prefer them to other perches, finding much
amusement in stripping off the fibre and nibbling at buds and
so on. It is not a bad idea to suspend in the open part of one's
aviary, by the thick end, a spreading piece of branch or a small
dead bush free from leaves ; it soon becomes a favourite perch,
especially if one places there the usual piece of cuttle-bone
or an occasional apple, which I find all my birds are
fond of. For ordinary, permanent perches there is nothing
better than those long, round sticks, called " dowels," which are
sold for id. or i^d. each at the oil shops; what they are really
for I have never found out, but they are of just the rightsize and
are made, evidently by machinery, from some tough, hard
wood--beech, I fancy--and are much superior to ordinary soft
brittle deal. Many canary fanciers maintain, I believe, that the
proper shape for a perch is broad and flat. This seems to me
ridiculous since Nature makes her perches almost invariably
round, and a small bird's foot is surely exactly adapted to grip
more particularly a circular object. (This is no doubt why the
intelligent bird-cage maker generally makes his perches square.)
A proof that broad thick perches are not the most comfortable is
that many birds will choose the very slenderest little twig to
roost upon, and a Siskin of mine--though Siskins are certainly
eccentric in the matter of roosting places--likes nothing better
than to tuck himself away on a thin, solitary French nail, an inch
and a half or so long, sticking out of a top plank of the aviary
at an angle of nearly 45 0 .
Whitewash is often recommended for the inside of an
aviary; for my part I think it is a great pity to use such coarse
stuff on any neatly-made wood-work and, until this year, I have
always employed ordinary oil paint, which has much to
recommend it. This spring, however, I made a trial of one of
the patent water paints, and was so satisfied with the result that I
should certainly use it again. It is ver} r easily applied with a
large brush, and dries quickly like distemper but does not rub off.

I used a clear bluisli-green, the effect of which is very pleasing
and which shews the birds up well. Of course such paints can
only be used for inside work away from moisture, and they go
best on a somewhat rough surface, such as unplaned wood or
plaster. The sort I used was very inexpensive and the makers
state that it is quite harmless.
The nest-boxes usually offered in the shops are not of
much use, and far better ones can be contrived from the various
little boxes which the domestic department is generally glad to
get rid of. Some, of Continental and American make, are
particularly suitable, being made of sound material and some-
times even dove-tailed : cigar boxes, I find, are rather too light
to work upon and need no end of soaking to get rid of their
paper covering. With a centre-bit, a " keyhole " saw and a few
extra nails, these little boxes can soon be converted into desirable
detached residences of sufficiently artistic appearance and
undeniable sanitary perfection. Of course there is just the line
to be drawn between the useful and the ornamental, and it is
undesirable to add any external decoration to the original box.
In one, like the first I have illustrated (Fig. 3), my two hen Green
Cardinals built a nest on the co-operative plan (there was,
unfortunately, no male). And in a box, like Fig. 4, a Linnet,
caught certainly not more than a few months before, successfully
reared a brood ; a sufficient proof, I think, that conditions even
approaching the natural are by no means essential to success.
These nest-boxes are best painted or varnished inside and
out, and if the front pieces, as at C for example, are made
</bodyText>

detachable they can be easily cleaned. A eonple of little spikes
put in at the back as at D will ensure their hanging firmly.
I do not know whether it is a new idea to supply one's
birds in the Winter-time with little shelters, open at the bottom,
specially for them to roost in, but when I tried the experiment
there was soon great competition for the possession of these
" cosy corners." I have out-lined patterns of two such roosting-

clearer. Of course such things would be valueless in a well-
sheltered aviary, but my own is rather exposed and the birds
seem to appreciate the protection thus afforded.
Amongst other things, I think I should consider in build-
ing another aviary, are the advantages of making it, at least as
far as the wire-work is concerned, in separate, easily detachable
sections ; of raising the ground for the floor a foot or so from the
general level; of using patent, wire-woven, transparent sheeting
for roofing and lights (I once used ground glass but the birds
thought they could fly through it, and it had to be covered with
netting) ; of an automatic water supply working from the outside
on the siphon or intermittent spring principle ; of specially
arranging a portion of the aviary so that a camera could be
successfully and readily brought to bear upon one's birds.
Some, at least, of these " mult a et mira " things, many and
wonderful, as the Latin ,primer says, I hope to carry into effect
" one of these fine days," but meanwhile I find I am consuming
with elementary trifles a most immoderate quantity of our good
Editor's space and therefore hasten to conclude, merely

THE RUFF.
Machetes pugnax.
By G. C. Porter.
It would be difficult to find a more interesting and hardy
bird than the above named wader. At first sight it appears a
bird totally unsuited to captivity&apos;, but such is by no means the
case, as better acquaintance with it proves.
The Ruff is almost universally distributed, many breeding
in the Arctic Regions, while others have been found in different
parts of India, Asia and America, but I am not sure whether it
has been found in Australia. This bird belongs to the Snipe
family, and is a summer visitor to this country, arriving about
the end of March, when it resorts to the Fens to breed. Each
Ruff takes from three to five Reeves, as the hens are called, and
at this period guards them very&apos; jealously&apos;, fighting furiously with
any&apos; rival who may be in the vicinity&apos;. This bird, contrary, I believe,
to the habits of almost all other waders, is polygamous, and this
is sufficient to account for its pugnacity&apos;. This was the time
when the fowler used to net them, the attention of the birds
being so occupied in fighting one another that they r did not
notice his approach, and so fell easy&apos; victims. The draining of
the Fens has made the Ruff very scarce in this country&apos;, but one
has been shot during the last few weeks on the Irrigation Farm
here at Bedford, and it still remains a common bird on the
Continent, especially&apos; in Holland. Considerable numbers are
still imported to Eeadenhall Market. I11 the Spring the Ruff
puts on the breeding plumage for which he is so well known.
The face is ornamented with light yellow skin, ears ornamented
with blue tufts, while round his neck spreads the beautiful ruff
shining--in the case of my bird--with blue and green tints. As
the summer advances, however, the feathers begin to drop oft,

Mr. G. C. Porter,
but the process is very slow, as it is now October and the face is
only denuded of the small bluish green feathers and the ears
have lost their tufts.* f In the winter the Ruff is very much like
the Reeve, all his former glory has departed, and he is now clad
in a sober suit of grey and brown, but is, I should think, about a
third larger than the Reeve, and the yellow bill is very much
stouter and has a black tip, while that of the Reeve is quite
black.
As they are extremely fond of bathing, a good sized pan of
water should be provided, and of course if anything more preten-
tious can be provided, such as a small pond, so much the better.
A bird of this kind is absolutely regardless of the weather.
This is in many respects a great advantage, as during the Nov-
ember Fogs and on cold winter nights one need not have any
fears concerning them; they are sure to turn up read} 7 for their
breakfast in the morning. I wish the same could always be said
about some of the foreign birds.
The Reeves differ very much in plumage; one would
hardly know that they belonged to the same species. The Ruffs
differ even more than the Reeves. I myself have seen stuffed
specimens with a light brown ruff spotted with black, while Gatke,
in his " Birds of Heligoland," states he has twice shot specimens
with this appendage pure white. The only note I have ever
heard (and this is common to both Ruff and Reeves) is a low
barking noise. I give them the pupae of the meat fly, gentles,
mealworms and if a pot full of earwigs or spiders can be emptied
in so much the better. From experience I may say that they
winter admirably on this fare. One difficulty is that,
although tame enough with me, the sight of a cat, or a strange
noise, causes them to fly up and dash their heads violently against
the netting, so it is advisable to cut a few feathers from one wing.
This does not detract from the appearance of the birds, and I
found it to act satisfactorily.

They eat a large quantity of canary seed, swallowing it
whole, and although this certainly is not natural it does not seem
to disagree, as they are in perfect condition. I suppose it is too
much to hope to breed them, but then the unexpected often
happens. I have certainly given them every opportunity, as the
aviary is close on one hundred feet long with plenty of cover.
As I have previously remarked, they are extremely fond of a
bath, which they take dipping up and down like a duck. Among
themselves they are extremely quarrelsome and merit to the full
their names "machetes" and " pugnax," bickerings frequently
taking place among the Reeves, which at meal times sometimes
develop into stand-up fights. Beyond pulling a few feathers
out of each other, however, they do not do each other much
harm. I have never seen them attack any other species, with
the exception of the Corncrake, who allows himself to be bullied
by every bird in the aviary, and the Porphyrios who, however,
are quite capable of looking after themselves.
Judging by the small space the study of wading birds
takes up in our Magazine, they do not appear to find much favour
with aviculturists, which is I think surprising, as they are
extremely tame and healthy, and combine beauty with an
unrivalled gracefulness of form. They present a very different
appearance in an outdoor aviary to the wretched specimens I saw
cooped up in the Fish House at the Zoological Gardens on my
last visit there. The birds appeared to be kept at an unnatural
temperature and fed on unsuitable food, and certainly looked
very unhappy.
What a pity an enclosure out of doors, like that provided for
the Gulls, cannot be given to them. I have kept several species
of wading birds, but none of them cared for any kind of soft-
billed food. During the winter they have lived almost entirely
on mealworms, which so far from proving " too stimulating,"
seems to agree with them perfectly.
I have just read with some interest the article entitled
" The Misuse of the Mealworm," and may say that my
experience is very different. I have found that mealworms form
a perfect food for all waders, rails, etc., and the} 7 cannot possibly

Reeves alone consume about a pint per month and show no
ill effects whatever. *

* Mr. G. C. Porter does not believe in "The Misuse of the Mealworm," which is just
as he thinks fit, but his arguments to the contrary are not convincing. He tells us that his
Ruff, with many mealworms, did not moult satisfactorily,whereas mine, with very few or no
mealworms, always moulted out clean and tight. His birds did not attempt to breed,
whereas mine I found to be ready breeders, even in my comparatively small aviary.
I have invariably found the Reeve a very nice bird in the aviary, but every Ruff I
have had has been an unmitigated nuisance, owing to the way he constantly and unceas-
ingly bullied the other ground birds, especially the smaller ones ; and X formed a very
poor opinion of his pluck.
It is a misfortune to have to cut the wing of a ground bird. It is better, if in an
aviary, to cut a little off the tip of both wings ; the birds then cannot hurt themselves,
but fly sufficiently to aerify their lungs ana dry their feathers in cold wet weather. After
the first moult, with Ruffs and most birds, it is not usually necessary again to cut the
wings, at any rate if only "tipped" in the first instance.--R.P.

Among the interesting additions were four hybrid Parra-

Parralceets (between Psephotus ehrysopfetygitis and P, multicolor),
four hybrid Macaws (bred between Ara macao and A. militaris ) ;
this is, as far as is known, the only instance on record of
hybridism between two species of Macaw in captivity; and two
hybrid Finches (between Munia malacca and M. rubro-nigra).
A11 August Amazon, Chrysotis aug 7 ista, from Dominica, and a
Guilding's Amazon, C. guildingi, from St. Vincent, were also
obtained, so that the forms peculiar to the Desser Antilles were
all to be seen in the Parrot House at one time : the former was
figured in Vol. VIII. p. 151 of the Magazine, and it is hoped
soon to figure the latter species.

Aviculturists, and especially those who care about
Parrots, will welcome the appearance of Parts II. &amp; III. of
Mr. Setli-Smith's book on the Parrakeets.
In these two he finishes the Conurince and the Palceor-
nithince, comprising amongst the former the Quaker Parrakeet,
the Blue-winged Parrakeet, and the Brotogerys family. We have
full and interesting accounts given us of the Cactus, Brown-
throated, Patagonian, and Carolina Conures. It is rather to be
regretted that, if the Carolina Conure is to become extinct, a
coloured plate was not given of it.
No doubt Mr. Seth-Smith intends bis work to be a help to
the aviculturist, and there is nothing for which the beginner is
more grateful than good accurate plates. It is very difficult to
construct a bird to the mind's eye from the most accurate
description. And Mr. Setli-Smith's plates are all so good that
they make us, like Oliver Twist, " ask for more." It would
have been a good thing also to have one of Henicognathus. It
is very possible that a record of rare birds may be lost from
people, who have come across them in captivity, not in the least
recognising what they were.
Perhaps it should be taken as the note of a good book
that it should make 11s regret that the whole of it cannot be
plums, like Mr. Phillipps' description of the Tui.
The account of the Quaker Parrakeet is almost better than
the bird itself deserves. The Author must have missed the
account of the escaped one in the New Forest, which appeared
either in this Magazine or in The Feathered World, or he would
not have failed to insert the curious story of this bird making
itself a nest in a thatch.f

very good, and be really enables the beginner to distinguish
readily between two easily confused species-- P. rosa and P.
cyanocephala : though here again one would have liked a plate of
the two species side by side.
In Polytelis he gives a charming plate of Barraband's
Parrakeet, but as that is a fairly well known species it might
have been better to have given one of Spathopterus alexandrce.
By the way, it really seems like divisions run mad, when a bird
so obviously a Polytelis is erected into a separate genus 011
account of a slight difference in one wing feather ! However,
that is not Mr. Seth-Smith's fault, though the British Museum
Catalogue of 1891 does not separate it.
The following parts will be awaited with much interest.
It would be a help to a good many people if a diagram of
a bird were given, with all the separate parts such as lores,
scapulars, primaries, secondaries, etc. clearly marked out. The
professional phraseology is to many people so much Greek.

CORRESPONDENCE.
"HYBRIDS " (see page 78 J.
Sir, --On pages 6 and 7 ofVol. VI., there is a notice of some birds reared
in my outdoor aviary by a cock White-throated Finch and a hen Canary.
I decided afterwards that the father of the two hybrids was the Bearded
Seedeater mentioned at the beginning of the article. I have the variegated
one now ; he is a lovely singer, and very brilliant in colouring.
Mr. Norwood might like to have his attention drawn to this.

NIGHTINGALE NOT MOULTING.
Sir,-- I should like an opinion on the following :
"I11 November, 1901, I got a cock Nightingale, but since I got it it has
never moulted, and although I pulled its tail in October (the feathers being
all broken) the new feathers have not come. The bird has been in perfect
health to all appearances, and is now singing with " open mouth " every
daj T . I feel quite satisfied with the food I am giving my birds. I have

two latter I have had caged over three years. What I should like to know
is, would it be wise to try and force it to moult, or let nature have its
way ? "
David Bentley.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Bentley:
I am not sure that I am the best person to answer your question,
because I never yet had any bird which failed to moult at the proper time.
Possibly this may be due to the fact that most of my birds are under glass,
and are, therefore, not only kept very warm in the moulting season, but are
not subject to any draught.
I should certainly be inclined to induce a moult by keeping the bird
warm (about 60 deg. Fhr. if possible) putting a few drops of syrup of
phosphates daily in the drinking water and a little powdered cuttle-bone in
its soft food.

Sir, --I should be very glad of any hints regarding the treatment of
the smaller delicate birds on first arrival from a journey. I have had quite
a number of Pin-tailed Nonpareils and Gouldian Finches sent me from a
London dealer lately, and have utterly failed with them.
They have had rice in the ear, millet in the ear, ants' eggs, etc., to
choose from, but have declined from the first. The journey proved too
much for most of them. They have been put in a temperature of 50*
to 55 0 Fahr.
I have a brood of Californian Quails about half-grown ; one of them
is brown all over ; the other four have white or whitish grey 011 the breast
and wings. Is this usual ?
I have had a lot of Budgerigars this year between a yellow cock and
ordinary hen ; the young have all taken after the hen and shew no leanings
towards the cock bird's colouring.
G. Rice.
Ihe following reply was sent to Captain Rice:
The journey from London to Blairgowrie is a very serious one for
weak unseasoned birds, straight from a dealer's shop.
The first and most important point is to give them warmth. I fear
that the temperature you mention is not sufficiently high. For unseasoned
specimens of the two species you mention, 65*--70* would not be
a whit too warm.
Gouldians are very simple feeders. Give them common white
millet, millet in the ear, and canary now and then.

To the Pin-tailed Nonpareils' (110 connection with the American
Nonpareils) food I should add the best white oats and a little preserved yolk
of egg.
I should feel disposed at first to place a speck of sulphate of quinine
in the drinking water. A little later, you might give minute doses (in
the drinking water), now and then, of syrup of hypophospkites.
But I fear none of these things will avail without extra warmth.
The plumage of your young Californian Ouails is not usual nor
satisfactory. Either there has been inbreeding, or something unusual
about their food, or they have found your climate too cold for them. If
well nurtured, it may be expected that they will moult into the normal
plumage.
The result of the Budgerigar breeding is interesting, shewing the
strong desire of Dame Nature to go back to the original stock.

Sir, --Do Rosellas generally breed the year after they are hatched ?
Thus will birds reared last September breed in 1903?
I purchased two pairs of young Cockatiels in 1901. One pair reared

F. H. Rudkin.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Rudkin :
It is unlikely that Rosellas bred last September will themselves
breed this year, unless it may 7 be quite late in the season ; and it would be
better for the birds themselves to wait yet another year.
We often see disputes as to the age at which Cockatiels commence to
breed. Your birds seem to have begun early, though it depends a good
deal at what time in 1901 they were reared.

Sir, --I think it may interest your readers to hear that an egg of
Mantell's Apteryx was laid in the aviaries here on December 31st last. The
egg was deposited in a deep scraping in the ground some distance from any
building, and under a thorn tree. A pair of Apteryx mantelli and a pair of
A. oweni have been for some considerable time at Lilford, living in a state
of semi - freedom. They are entirely " self-supporting " except in very
severe weather, when their natural food is supplemented by raw meat,
etc. One of each species has recently died, and the two remaining have,
presumably, paired. There is no reason to doubt the egg having been
fertile, but it was badly cracked ; and besides this, I fancy the severity of
the weather would have prevented all possibility of hatching.

Sir, --There is perhaps nothing in which the aviculturist is more
handicapped to the student of Nature than with regard to the peculiarities
in the flight of birds.
This difficult}^ is not easily overcome, as the former studies them
within the confines of a limited space, the latter studies them in the world
at large; the one observing them using their wings, only as far as a few
yards at most, the other seeing them where they have their freedom and
where they can acquire speed and so get from place to place with the least
possible exertion.
This is, perhaps, more particularly with large birds than with small,
but even with the latter it is oftener the case than we suppose (as an
example I will give will show).
In February last, while I was having hot water pipes fitted into my
aviary, my cock Australian Crested Pigeon escaped through the
aperture made for the pipes and flew away to the top of some
high beech trees close by. I made haste and caught the hen, and put it
out in a cage to attract his attention, in order to try and secure him with a
trap cage. The day was fine, and he sat and cooed and preened his
feathers for a considerable time, but after a bit, off he flew like a rocket,
almost straight up into the air, and to a great height, clapping his wings
against his body all the time he ascended. Then he held up his wings and

I 5 I
descended rapidly at a very acute angle till lie reached about the same level
from which he started and then he flew away and alighted on the top of a
larch tree about a hundred yards off and up went his tail as he poised
himself, which he did without difficulty on the thin twigs. The joys of
freedom, sweet freedom, seemed to have returned to him, for up into the
air he went again and again, and always in the same rocket like style
followed by the rapid descent to the level of the starting point.
No doubt this is the Crested Pigeon's love flight, and in Australia I
daresays he will be often seen indulging in it, such as we see the Ring Dove
doing in this country&apos;.
He amused himself flying as described and sitting cooing alternately
for the most of two hours, and then he began to fly r about lower, often
alighting on the thick branches low down on the trees, and once on the
house top, and now was beginning to look for something to eat. I shifted
the hen to several different places hoping to entice him down, and although
he saw her perfectly&apos;, and often flew straight as if he would alight beside her,
yet when nearing, never even checked his speed to do so, and he alway&apos;s
flew at a very great speed, faster than even a Rock Pigeon.
I noticed also he did not check his speed any&apos; before alighting on a
branch, but flew arrow like to where he perched, throwing up his tail to
arrest his momentum.
When flying low his appearance was much like a Cuckoo and his
crest was always carried on his neck, but when he mounted in the air as
before described, he reminded me of a Pheasant, which, when flushed in a
wood, makes for an opening in trees straight overhead, but the great
rapidity&apos; of his flight was what struck me most. Out of six species of
foreign Doves I have kept the Australian-crested is the only&apos; one I would
call fascinating, but it has to be at liberty to see it at its best.
As night came on he seemed to get very hungry and alighted on the
ground to get some grain I threw down for the poultry&apos;. I got a wire frame,
raised it up on one side with a short piece of stick and a pull line attached,
threw in a little hemp seed, and I soon had my Dove again and all the
experience into the bargain.
Two days after this a cock Canary&apos; got out of the aviary and flew about
enjoying its liberty to the very utmost, and I was very surprised to see that
it delighted to sing vociferously when flying.
It took flights away out from among the trees into the open with
flappings of the wings precisely the same as a Greenfinch does. I have
kept Canaries in ail aviary with a fairly&apos; large wire flight (16 feet by 9 feet),
and although there was ample room I have never seen them indulge in their
love flight with its accompaniment in song.

Correspondence.
PEKIN ROBINS.
Sir,--A friend of mine has a pair of Pekin Nightingales with which
she has vainly tried to breed, and I should be most grateful to be told where
she is at fault.
The birds are kept by themselves in an aviary in a conservatory, and
provided with a growing shrub, and further shelter arranged by fixing fir
and other branches at the top of the aviary. The birds are in good
condition, and two years built a nest by weaving soft unravelled string,
grass bents, etc., but, before it was finished, in each case, the hen laid her
eggs, not soft ones, from a perch, so of course they were broken. She used
to squat broodingly on the earth in the flower pots, but never built in such
a situation. The birds disregard a box on the wall with pigeon-hole
entrances.
In the spring mouths they have the use of the conservatory, which
keeps them entertained insect-hunting. Perhaps the right nesting
material has not been provided, though almost everything has been tried,
including fibre from palm stems, moss and feathers.
M. Kangford.
The following reply was sent to Miss Langford:
The Pekin Robins are dissatisfied with their surroundings, or with
the accommodation provided for them.
They build open nests, and will not take readily to any kind of
closed-in nesting-box, except the common wooden-barred German cage.
In the garden aviary they build in bushes.
In smaller places, they nest in open nest-boxes, like Canaries.
One of the earliest cases of the successful breeding of this species in
England was an experience of a lady-friend of the Society, a lady who still
keeps many Canaries, who, after various failures, loosed her Pekin Robins
in the Canary birdroom,--"and I hung for them, at about two feet from the
ceiling, a Canary nest-box, with a tiny basket, lined with flannel, tightly
fixed into it. This time they did not try to build a nest, but on the ist
August I had the satisfaction of finding that an egg had been laid in the
basket." Two young were reared. See Notes on Cage Birds , Second
.Series, page 157.
String, or anything of that kind, is dangerous. Give hay, grass, etc.,
and small feathers, and hang up Canary boxes, etc., and Canary pans lined
with felt,-- and give them as much liberty as possible. The less you
examine the nests the better.
Reginald Philupps.

The following letter u&amp;gt;as forzvarded to Mrs. Gregory in answer to an
enquiry:
The yew is delightful for insectivorous birds, and birds that do not
touch it, but please note that it is a deadly poison to birds that partake of it.
Perhaps a lopped or dead bough may be more poisonous than a living one,
but death lurks in the yew tree. Of course I do not say that the Cranes will
eat it. If they do not, all well. A loaded gun left lying about is all right if
not meddled with--but sometimes it goes off! ! !
The box is quite different. It is not poisonous I suppose, but badly
disarranges the stomach. I have had many box trees in my aviary, and the
birds did not seem to touch them as far as I remember. Anyway, I have
never heard of a bird being Imrt by a box tree in an open aviary where
they have other things to nibble at. In your large garden, I should not
hesitate to plant the box border, as probably the Cranes would not pick it.
But, all the same, I should watch.

<bodyText confidence="0.998903666666667" page_id="10284248"  page_num="Page 153" year="" vol="">
It has been suggested that a General Index to the first
eight volumes of the Avicultural Magazine is much needed, and
would be highly appreciated by many of our members. It is
very trying, when one wishes to look up a certain subject, to
have to wade through the eight volumes, in some of which the
indices are not very complete. An index to the whole of the
volumes would save much time, and is, we think, unquestionably
needed. But the preparation and production of such a work
would entail considerable expense, and the Society would not be
justified in issuing it unless, say, one hundred members would
subscribe. The price per copy would have to be fixed at 6 s.
to members, and 10s. to non-members. The Editor would be
glad to hear from all members who would be willing to
subscribe for a copy in the event of a General Index being
published ; only a limited number would be printed.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gili., M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case.
No replies can be sent by post.
Grey Parrot. (Mr. C. P. Arthur). In owner's possession twelve mouths ;
lost its appetite. Gave it a teaspoonfnl of fluid magnesia to one ounce
of water; would not feed so gave it Bovril, of which it drank three
tinsful daily, but almost as soon as swallowed brought it up again;
gave it three drops of chlorodyne in water to stop diarrhoea; fed on
seed and water. [Enteritis was cause of death. Your Bovril treatment
aggravated the disease and is quite uusuited to any granivorous bird.
The chlorodyne was correct; had you commenced with it the chances
of recovery would have been far greater. It was a male].
Gray Waxbill and Combassou. (Dr. Creswell). Both found dead ;
seed hopper was clogged, and all other birds very hungry. [Birds
died of exhaustion from want of food, neither one having a single grain
in the crop].
Paradise Whydah. (Hon. M. C. Hawke). Purchased a month ago;
always seemed strong; found dead. [Bird died of apoplexy].
Hen Pin-Tailed Nonpareil (Mr. W. C. Douglas). Purchased less than
a week ago; it looked sick on arrival; found dead. [Concussion of
the brain was cause of death. There was extravasated blood at anterior
part of skull at base of beak. The clot was not sufficiently extensive
to kill outright but it had occurred some days before death].
Two Combassous. (Rev. R. H. Wilmot). Only purchased a few days ago ;
both sitting on the floor when uncovered in the morning; one died at
once, the second two hours after. [Enteritis was cause of death].
Goldfinch. (Dr. W. G. Creswell) Found dead. [Apoplexy],
Gouldian Finch, hen. (Mr. N. B. Roberts). [Acute congestion of liver,
which had ruptured]. _
Rufous-necked Weaver. (Mr. W. Tomes). Has not seemed to moult
well; it continually opened its beak and shook its head. [Your bird

died of starvation, not being able to take sufficient nourishment owing
to a diphtheric deposit in the mouth and throat, involving the base of
tongue].
Pair Pin-Tailed Nonpareils. (Mr. W. H. Foster). Were sent by train.
[Concussion of brain in both cases].
Whydah. (Rev. R. H. Wilmot). Seemed very ill this morning and died
soon after. Can I give the others anything in their drinking water ?
[Enteritis was the cause of death. All birds that have been in contact
(as you say a fortnight) should be kept in one cage and the cage
isolated. I cannot suggest any treatment further than scrupulous
cleanliness: remove all excrement at least once daily].
Black-headed Gouldian, Cordon Bleu, Weaver, lieu Budgerigar
(Mr. Mathias). [Gouldian, extensive disease of the liver, bird much
emaciated, has fed very little for some time : Cordon Bleu, apoplexy:
Weaver, tuberculosis of liver: hen Budgerigar, fatty degeneration of
liver]. _
Scarlet Tanager. (Mr. Cuthbertson). Has not been well since I had
it first; found dead. [Pneumonia was cause of death].
Zebra Finch. (Mr. L. W. Horton). It had been quite well until yester-
day, when it appeared to faint and fell off the perch and remained
very quiet all day; died this morning. [Apoplexy was the cause of
death]. _
Grey Waxbill and Avadavat. (Mr. M. E. Griffiths). These, together
with several other small foreigners, were found dead. The birds were
given some green food which was left in aviary over night and got
frosted, which I thought might have caused it. [Birds both died of
enteritis : the frosted green food would quite account for it].
Musky Lorikeet. (Mr. Castle-Sloane). Found dead. [Apoplexy.
These birds should not be fed on seed, as fits are almost sure to follow
such unnatural feeding. I have kept many varieties of Lorikeets in
perfect health with bread and condensed milk made with boiling water,
and whatever fruit may be in season].
Hen Nonpareil. (Mr. Douglas). The bird seemed weak on the wing
when purchased. [Congestion of the liver was cause of death. You
do not state what food it has received : it might be caused by some
error in diet, but I should think it had been affected for some time].

temperature frequently prove fatal. Mine are in an open aviary in all
weathers, and I have never lost one yet. You do not mention the food,

By Mrs. Gregory.
My Crowned Crane was brought from the West Coast of
Africa (Nigeria) two years before I purchased him. During
those two years he was kept in a wired-in run five yards square ! !
When he came to me his spirit for a time seemed broken, and
he did not understand or appreciate being let loose in a garden
to wander about as he liked. Instead, he would remain standing
close to wire or fences, as if he liked to feel sheltered and pro-
tected. After some weeks he began to improve, to walk about
more and enjoy himself, and finally to flap his wings, bow
grotesquely, and indulge in eccentric dances with a pair of
Demoiselle Cranes.
He is an extremely gentle bird, and obediently walks
before me into his house when it begins to get dusk. There he
sleeps squatting down on a bed of straw or dried bracken. I do
not know if this habit is peculiar to the Crowned species, as
usually Cranes sleep standing on one leg.
In the morning, about half-past seven, the Demoiselles
walk up a little passage leading to his house, exactly as if they
were going to call him, for in a few moments the Crowned
Crane walks slowly out, stretching his long neck forward (in a
manner which always makes me think of a Giraffe), and follows
them with wings outspread.
I notice that he is much more of a grain eater than they ;
occasionally he will eat a small snail, but he is indifferent to
worms and slugs, and hunts very little after flies, grubs, &amp;c.

Mr. W. P. Pycraft,
Mr. Gronvold's exquisite plates are so life-like that there
is no need for much description of this bird's colouring. He is
taller and handsomer than the two Cape Crowned ( B. regulorum )
hens which I saw in the Zoo lately; his neck is longer, much
darker in colour, and more graceful. The face markings differ
considerably in the two species; in Regulorum the cheeks
are white, except in a small space at the upper part, and
the wattles are long and pendulous ; while in B. pavonina the
white and pink patches on the cheeks are almost equally divided,
and the wattles (under the chin only) are so tiny as scarcely to
be seen unless looked for.
[The concluding part of this paper, and an enlarged coloured figure
of the head only of Balearica pavonina showing clearly its distinctive mark-
ings, will appear in the next number of this journal.--E d.]

By W. P. Pycraft, M.B.O.U., &amp;c.
In writing the description of a bird it is found expedient,
where a varied pattern of coloration has to be described, to
locate the variously coloured areas of the body by distinct
names. At the request of some of our readers these areas have
been mapped out, and will be found in the accompanying chart
(Plate i).
The description of the plumage completed, many other
points require attention that are but too frequently neglected, or
slurred over. One of the most important of these is the colour
of the soft parts--that is of the iris, the eyelids, beak, inside of
the mouth, and the feet.
With regard to measurement, it is not sufficient to give
the total length from the beak to the tip of the tail. The
expanse of the wings stretched to their fullest should be given,
as well as the distance from the tip of the closed wing (a) to the
crown of the head, and (#) to the tip of the tail. In making
skins from freshly killed birds careful attentiou should be paid
to the preservation of these measurements. In a series of skins
of the same species recently examined by the writer, some had

the wings projecting nenrly an inch beyond the tip of the tail,
others had the tail projecting as much beyond the tip of the
wings. Few authors appear to take these measurements into
account when describing a bird.
After measurements should follow the enumeration of
the remiges, or flight feathers, counting first the number of
primaries, then of the secondaries. Their shape should next
be noted, and the relative length of the primaries. It is often
customary to express the relative lengths by what is known
as the wing formula, merely writing the number of the feathers
in order from the longest, the first primary being the outermost,
thus: 4-3-2-5-1-6-7-8.
In the normal wing there are eleven primaries, but the
number varies. In the Carinatse (i.e., all birds except the
Ostrich, Rhea, Cassowaries, Emus and Apteryx) there are never
more than twelve, and never fewer than nine. Only certain
Storks, and Grebes have twelve primaries. The length of the
innermost quill should be especially noted. Often it is reduced
so as to be with difficulty distinguished from its covert, than
which it is often smaller, as in the so-called nine-primaried
Passeres. When reduced to the size of, or less than its covert,
it is called a " remicle.&amp;quot;
In describing the secondary feathers the length of the
inner quills should be noted. They may be either conspicuously
short, or long. When very long, as in Wagtails and Pipits and
certain Ducks for example, they should be described as elongated
inner secondaries, not as tertiaries or tertials, as is so often done.
This is a gross error based on ignorance of the meaning of these
terms.
After the number of the quills or remiges has been counted,
and their shape described, the wing should next be examined to
see whether it is " diastataxic " or "eutaxic." It is diastataxic
when the fifth pair of major coverts (Plate II) lack a quill
between them. When every pair of major coverts embraces
a quill between them the wing is said to be eutaxic.
The overlap of the covert feathers of the wing, and the
number of rows of minor coverts should, when possible, also be

Mr. W. P. Pycraft,
recorded. These coverts are said to have a proximal overlap,
when the free edge of the covert is that turned towards the body
in the outstretched wing, and a distal overlap when the edge is
turned away from the body. The major coverts always have a
distal overlap. There is never more than one row of major, or
median coverts, there may be several rows of minor coverts, or
these may be wanting. The terms " greater," " middle," and
"lesser" coverts are vague, and should be avoided.
The presence of claws in the wing should also be looked
for. One is commonly found on the thumb.
The under surface of the wing often presents features
worthy of record. Such as the length and number of rows
of minor coverts, and the pattern of the long " axillary " feathers,
such as occur in the Snipe for example.
After the wing, the tail should be described, record being
made of the number and shape of the tail feathers, and the
presence or absence of an oil gland, and whether this is tufted
or not.
Much helpful information would be gained if a practice
were made of recording the extent, nature, and colour of the
downy underclothing when this exists. For example, the
Bustards have a vivid pink down, which fades soon after death.
Other birds develop tufts of a remarkable form of down known
as " powder-down." This may form huge patches on the breast
and thighs, as in Herons and Bitterns, or be scattered over the
body as in certain Hawks and Parrots.
Finally, the horny parts must be described. These in-
clude the sheaths of the beak, and the scaly envelope of the feet.
The beak sheath is often compound, that is, formed of several
distinct elements (Plate III). More often these sheaths--for
the upper and lower jaws--are each composed of a single piece,
and are then said to be " simple." They may be deeply
grooved, or their edges may be toothed as in Shrikes or
birds of prey, or serrated as in Gannets or Mergansers. The
nature of these " teeth " aud serration should be accurately
described. The form of the " file " on the under surface of the
tip of the Parrot's beak is a character of some importance.

Careful attention must be paid to the form of the nostrils.
In some birds, as in the New World Vultures, these are pierced,
and are then said to be perforate ; when the nostrils of the two
sides are separated by a partition they are said to be imperforate.
Often this aperture is guarded by a scale or operculum. I11
some birds, as in Gannets and Cormorants the nostrils are want-
ing. The length and shape of the beak will, of course, also be
noted.
The legs and toes are generally encased in a horny sheath,
the podotheca. When this sheath is divided into a number of
small pieces it is said to be schizothecal. I11 most cases these
pieces take the form of moderately large shields, when the
sheath is said to be scutellate; when the shields are small and
octagonal in shape, reticulate. Sometimes the back of the tarso-
metatarsus or planta is invested in a pair of plates meeting one
another in the middle line ; this arrangement is known as lamini-
plantar. This character is a conspicuous feature in the sub-
division of the Passeres. A still further fusion of plates, resulting
in the formation of a continuous sheath along the front of the
leg, or acrotarsuwi, results in what is called a liolothecalpodotheca,
e. g. Robin. Generally it will be found this sheath is composed
of scales of various kinds ; thus the lower portion of the acro-
tarsium may be scutellate, the upper portion reticulate ; similarly
th e planta may be clothed partly in scutellae, partly in reticulated
plates.
Sometimes these scales give place to a thin skin marked
with fine lines as in the Duck ; the sheath is then said to be
cancellated.
In certain birds of prey, Owls and Grouse, the scaly cover-
ing is replaced by feathers, which may even clothe the " soles "
of the feet.
The under surface of the toes in birds of prey have large
fleshy tubercles at the joints ; these are known as tylari.
The form of the claws should be carefully noted. Often
the claw of the middle toe has a comb-like edge, when it is said
to be pectinated or serrated.
The general form of the foot varies greatly. Normally

Mr. P. W. Pycraft,
four toes are present, three of which are turned forwards, and
one, the hallux, or great toe, backwards. When all the toes are
free the foot is said to be eleutherodactyle. Sometimes, as in
Coots, and Waterhens, and Grebes, the sides of the toes are
fringed with a series of folds or lobes, when they are said to be
lobed. The Ducks, Gulls, and Petrels have a palmated or
webbed foot, that is to say, the front toes are connected by a
web. In the Gannets and Cormorants and their allies, all the
toes are thus connected, hence the foot is totipalmate. In some
birds the front toes are half-webbed, or semi-palmate, e.g.
Anseranas. The foot is said to be pamprodactyle when all the
toes are turned forwards, as in the Swifts ; zygodactyle when the
first and fourth are turned backwards, as in Parrots and Wood-
peckers and Cuckoos ; heterodactyle when the outer or fourth toe
is reversible, as in the Owls, Osprey, and some diurnal birds of
prey. The Kingfisher, Bee-eaters and some others have a syn-
dactyle foot, that is to say, the three front toes are closely
bound together throughout the greater part of their length.
In conclusion, I would remark that the technical terms
cannot be too emphatically condemned in the descriptions in-
tended for the perusal of the general reader ; on the other hand,
their adoption in purely scientific treatises is not only thoroughly
justified but absolutely necessary. By their means we are
enabled, without circumlocution, to state tersely and precisely
what are the distinguishing characteristics of the bird we are
describing.

By Graham Renshaw, M.B.
In spite of the ever increasing numbers of those who take
an active interest in natural history, opportunities of studying
rare foreign birds in confinement are by no means so frequent as
might be wished. The difficulty of obtaining many species
owing to the remoteness of their haunts, together with the
problem of transport (since the bird during its long journey
must be fed daily and with the right sort of food) constitutes a
serious impediment to progress in this very interesting depart-
ment of zoology, whilst the high prices often demanded for
rare birds are an additional hindrance to extensive aviculture.
Hence most of the rarer exotic birds which are brought to
Europe appear almost exclusively in the splendid aviaries of the
various Zoological Gardens, and hardly come under the notice
of the average amateur at all. As scarcely anything appears to
have been hitherto recorded concerning the habits of many
species in captivity, I have much pleasure in contributing the
following original observations on various foreign birds now,
or lately, living in my own collection.
The species are as follows:
PASSERES.
Garni lax r sinensis (Chinese Jay Thrush).
The Chinese Jay Thrush has many virtues to recommend
him : his cheerful, wide-awake, alert bearing, wins the bystander's
interest at once, and this intelligent demeanour is enhanced by a
considerable capacity for being tamed. Although but soberly
clad in hues of grey and greenish brown, with a white patch on
each cheek, the sturdy figure of the Jay Thrush is very pleasing
to the eye; some of these birds are also pleasing to the ear, since
they can pipe with some ability, although my own specimen did
but little in this direction. Ever jolly, self-reliant, and enter-
prising, there is hardly anything that the Jay Thrush will

refuse to eat, so that his owner need fear no breakdown of
the commissariat. Unfortunately, his enquiring disposition and
omnivorous appetite render this bird a dangerous companion for
smaller birds, whose thin skulls would stand little chance against
the hammerlike strokes of his closed bill. The Jay Thrush may,
however, be safely allowed in a mixed aviary, provided that it
contain no weaker birds for him to bully ; this aviary may with
advantage have an outdoor compartment, for so robust an inmate
requires no coddling, and visitors to the Amsterdam Zoological
Gardens may recollect the fine example of Garrulax si?ie?isis
which was thriving out of doors during the past (so-called)
summer. The Chinese Jay Thrush has of late years been
frequently imported into this country, and well deserves the
attention of amateurs, to whom it appears to be practically
unknown.* f
Lamprotomis caudatus (Long-tailed Glossy Starling).
The Eulabetidce, or Glossy Starlings, are pre-eminent
amongst the feathered tribe in the incomparable beauty of their
plumage, the lovely metallic hues of which recall the splen-
dours of their near relations, the Birds of Paradise. There are
several species of Long-tailed Starling: the individual I now
possess has golden-yellow eyes, and much of the plumage is
magnificent rich violet, resembling the glorious hues seen on the
wings of the Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise (Seleucides 7 iigricans).
Long-tailed Starlings are remarkably Corvine in gait and manner,
and much resemble Magpies both in their demeanour and in their
odd partiality for glittering objects, whilst the likeness is in-
creased by their long tails. These Starlings soon become tame :
my own bird will fly down to take grapes or mealworms from the
hand, but it is capricious at times, for if not very hungry he will
not accept a grape unless bit by bit; should a whole grape be
offered by his dutiful owner the bird takes it in a blase sort of
way, holds it in his beak for a moment, and then contemptuously
* I have had four specimens and found them to vary greatty. One was a superb
whistler.--R. P.
t I think Dr. Renshaw is mistaken in this assumption : the bird was tolerably
well-known when I first began to take up aviculture (some twenty-one years ago). The
name is not a good one ; as the Collared Jay-Thrush, a rarer bird undoubtedly, is also
a Chinese species.--A. G. B.

lets it drop on tlie floor. When hungry, this Starling, on seizing
the grape, flies to the ground with it, and by dint of vigorously
shaking it and beating it against the ground, soon wrenches it
into a shapeless mass, which is then swallowed. He has various
ways of amusing himself. A piece of talc, which had fallen out
of the front of a small stove, was recently a great treasure,
worthy of being carried about in his beak : but his great accom-
plishment is solo singing. Closely caged, the Glossy Starling
is silent enough ; but turned loose in an aviary these birds will
perch in the highest attainable situation, and make a brave
attempt at a song, the melody (?) being remarkably limited in
quantity, whilst the noise is prodigious, the bird shrieking and
shouting at the top of its voice in a most disagreeable manner.
During special vocal efforts the Dong-tailed Starling half ex-
pands its wings and allows them to droop in a characteristic
fashion. As regards its treatment of other species, I have kept
my own specimen in a mixed aviary, containing many tiny
birds, without murder being done, but I understand that other
ornithologists have not been so fortunate.
Lamprocolms chalybeus (Green Glossy Starling).
The Short-tailed Glossy Starlings are as beautiful as their
long-tailed brethren, but whereas the latter resemble Mapgies in
their deportment, the former are more like Jackdaws in their
sharp inquisitive scrutiny of various objects, and in their quick
business-like gait. The eyes of the Green Glossy Starling are
rich golden yellow ; the plumage is changeable steely green,
diversified with a dark patch on each ear and a few rounded
spots on the wings. Like its long-tailed congeners this Starling
becomes very tame in confinement : the one I had last year
would call as soon as he heard my footsteps in the morning! and
would come running up to the wires to be fed. He would also
readily take various dainties from the hands of a complete
stranger. The bird shares the usual Starling ambition to become
a singer, and succeeds in producing a discordant but vigorously
rendered series of noises, perhaps, however, more agreeable than
those of the preceding species. The Green Glossy Starling may
be fed on potatoes, damped sponge cake, bread-crumb, figs, and

dried ants' eggs: at meal-time my bird was inclined to be a
bully, driving off the other birds by jumping on them in no half-
hearted fashion, a proceeding which seemed to cause them con-
siderable inconvenience. Although I have seen it stated in
print that Glossy Starlings, though becoming very tame, are
but short lived in confinement. I have found them to be hard}&apos;&apos;
enough, and repeated inspection of the splendid series of these
birds--consisting of Lamprotornis aeneusLamprocolius chalybeus,
L. nite?is, and L. auratus\ --which has been maintained at the
Amsterdam Zoological Gardens during 1899-1902, has convinced
me that, with proper care, they will do at least as well as any
other birds brought from sunny Africa to colder climates. All
the Glossy Starlings delight to bask in the sun : they then preen
their resplendent plumage and endeavour to sing. Young birds
are duller in hue than their seniors, the gorgeous metallic tints
being in them largely represented by lustreless greyish-brown.
Icterus jamacaii (Brazilian Hangnest).
This handsome black-yellow bird is to be seen in every
European Zoo. As regards external characters it is remarkable
for its long and sharply-pointed beak, for the curious area of
naked blue skin adjoining the eye, and for the large powerful
feet. The Hangnest is carnivorous]:, and will promptly kill any
small bird introduced into its cage. Several times small species
such as Mannikins, that had escaped from neighbouring cages,
were seized by my Hangnest, which savagely gripped them by
the leg and endeavoured to drag them through the wires. I have
known a Cordon Bleu ( Estrilda phcenicotis ) to have one leg
almost completely severed from the body by this mode of
attack. In addition to animal food, Icterus jamacaii will also
take fruit. The bird has a curious habit, when feeding on a fig
or similar dainty, of thrusting its closed beak into the fruit, and
then by separating the mandibles with a compass-like action,

exposing the interior to view. The Hangnest will occasionally
pipe in confinement. Several of these birds kept together in a
very large cage make a fine show, and will agree together, owing
to mutual respect (inspired by each others beaks and claws) or,
perhaps on the principle of " honour among thieves." Other
birds must be introduced with caution, since even so bulky a
species as the Scarlet Tanager (.Pyranga rubra) is by no means
safe from attack. Brazilian Hangnests vary in the intensity of
their yellow colouring: in some individuals this part of the
plumage tends to a citron hue, in others it approaches orange.
Molothrus bonariensis (Silky Cowbird).
This South American species is annually imported into
England in considerable numbers, and, unlike many exotic
birds, can be usually purchased at a very low figure : a handsome
male which I now possess was bought in Liverpool for under four
shillings. Young birds and females are more or less brownish :
but the adult cock is of a magnificent violet, and is frequently
sold as a " Glossy Starling." Unlike those fowls, however, the
Silky Cowbird sings very melodiously : he is not at all dangerous
to small birds ; he requires but the simplest diet, such as millet
or other bird seed; and he is not given to violently jumping
upon any weaker comrade who may have caused his displeasure.
In addition to these virtues the Cowbird's character exhibits a
very pleasing trait--a kindly disposition to companions in mis-
fortune. I remember how, when one of my Glossy Starlings
was afflicted with what proved to be its last illness, a Cowbird
would come and stand by the sufferer in silence, its whole bear-
ing eloquent of sympathetic interest. My present birds are
males, and show great preference for each other's company : and
although at night these bachelors will bicker for roosting places
their quarrels are conducted in a series of melodious twitterings,
and they threaten each other rather than fight. The Silky
Cowbird is quite hardy, and requires but little protection even in

Pyranga rubra (Scarlet Tanager).*&apos;
This brilliant bird is gaily decked in summer in a garment
of flaming scarlet with wings and tail of a jet black: in winter
the scarlet is replaced by dingy yellow. A cock bird in my
collection during 1901 was fed on fruit, auts' eggs, and sponge
cake. He used to hop to and fro, uttering his curious chirp as he
alighted 011 his perch, and was of a self-reliant disposition, for,
on the Glossy Starling attempting to bully him at meal-times,
he promptly turned on the aggressor, whom he menaced to such
purpose that his adversary never repeated the experiment.
The Hangnest was, however, too much for him, the Tanager
being pulled over on to his back, and receiving repeated stabs
from his enemy's dagger-like bill. Since this occurrence the
Tanager continued to feed well, but gradually became less lively
and declining daily in health died several weeks after this
encounter. He was much emaciated, having probably received
some internal injury. This bird was peaceable enough with his
companions if let alone, only fighting in self defence. I cordially
recommend so lovely a species to the notice of amateurs.

Hierococcyx varius (Indian Hawk Cuckoo).
These Asiatic Cuckoos, with their curved beaks, long wings
and tails and barred plumage, curiously resemble Accipitrine
birds, a likeness which is, however, at once dispelled by a glance
at the characteristic zygodactyle foot. My Cuckoo was the
tamest bird I ever had, and would fly 011 to my hat or hand
expecting to be fed. He disposed of a considerable quantity of
grapes, which were swallowed whole; if disturbed too soon
after feeding he would frequently lighten himself by regurgitating
a grape, which was allowed to drop on the floor. The bird was
also very fond of mealworms. His disposition towards other
birds was snappy and quarrelsome, every feather bristling up if
another bird ventured to perch on the same branch as his
highness, whilst any intruder he thought sufficiently weak-

minded was scared away by the wide opening of his feeble beak.
Although feeding well and even voraciously, this Cuckoo was
never very animated, except at meal-times, when he was always
well to the front: he seldom ventured into the outdoor aviary
(where he sometimes would sit listlessly on a branch) and I only
once heard him calling. Perhaps the climate did not suit him,
for although he took every care of his precious person by con-
tinually moping indoors, he was taken ill during the prevalence
of some keen east winds, and died about twenty-four hours
afterwards.
Colins stria his (Striated Mousebird).
It must be confessed that the Striated Mousebird is an
ugly little creature in his dull brown plumage, but, nevertheless,
this species makes an interesting pet. The beak is remarkable

for its Hawk-like upper mandible, which is of a deep blue-black
colour contrasting sharply with that of the lower bill, which is
ivory white. I am not sure that the Mousebird is content with
the mere possession of an Accipitrine beak, at any rate my bird
is under grave suspicion of having used it to some purpose, since
he was found recently dragging about the dead and partly-
devoured body of an Avadavat ( Estrilda aviandava&apos;). The head
of the Mousebird is surmounted by a thin crest of wiry feathers,
which can be raised or depressed at will. The flight of this
species is short but rapid : when it settles on a tree (as remarked
by T.ayard years ago) the bird alights on one of the lower branches
and jerkily creeps upward into a higher situation. When creep-
ing down a bush towards its food (I often suspend a bunch of
grapes to a convenient twig in order to study this point) Colins

bird would do, edges its wa}&apos; slowly down grasping parallel twigs
instead of different portions of the same one. O11 reaching the
fruit the Mousebird bites a piece out of it, and swallows it with
a masticating action of the beak: it will often pick up a loose
grape from the floor and fly away with it; on alighting, the grape
is shifted from the beak to the foot, which grasps it in a singular,
and almost monkey-like manner, while the bird solemnly pro-

Mr. Graham Renshaw,
ceeds to make a meal. When on the ground the Mousebird hops
quickly along, the whole metatarsus touching the earth, and the
long stiff tail dragging behind. This species sleeps in an extra-
ordinary fashion, for, instead of roosting like ordinary birds, it
lies prone on a convenient ledge or shelf, and looks as if dead or
at the last gasp. The Striated Mousebird may be fed on ants'
eggs, mealworms, grapes, apples, and pears; its note is a weak
chirp, but it squeaks rapidly when much alarmed.
Although in poor condition when he arrived (owing
apparently to an insufficient fare of cheap unripe fruit) my bird
soon improved on a liberal diet of mealworms and grapes, the
plumage becoming beautifully smooth and fine. Perhaps this

improvement in health led to the adoption of the luxurious tastes
which eventually proved his destruction, for, during the moult,
instead of sleeping on a perch or sill like an ordinary bird, this
Sybarite began to intrude upon an African Jerboa-rat {Diptis
agyptius) which shared the aviary, and used to sleep in this
animal's warm bed every night. The Jerboa began to take pay-
ment by stripping off the Mouse-bird's feathers, and we suppose
one night accidentally overlay the Mouse-bird, for the un-
fortunate Colitis was found apparently smothered, being in
excellent condition and without external wound, but lifeless.

The Jerboa wasted no time in sentimental tears, bnt promptly
plucked the body quite bare, except the wings ; the plump,
well-nourished condition of the Mouse-bird was thus plainly
evident, as was also the weight and firmness of the body on
being taken into the hand.
Anthracoceros convexus (Temminck's Pied Hornbill).
All the specimens of this bird I have seen were sleepy-
looking fowl, and the hen Hornbill, which I received in 1901,
was no exception to the rule, sitting sluggishly on her perch for
an hour at a time, and only descending to feed. On feeling the
pangs of hunger she would utter a hoarse croak, and then, hop-
ping off the perch and across the floor in a very ungainly fashion,
would seize the food--grapes, chopped bananas, pieces of fish,
and so on--swallowing great portions whole, and disposing of
piece after piece in rapid succession. Live frogs were killed by
a nip of the beak, and then the luckless victim was passed
backwards and forwards in the bird's bill until crushed into a
shapeless mass, which was then swallowed. Drowned mice were
carefully dried before being devoured, the Hornbill rubbing the
body on a branch in the most fastidious manner, pausing from
time to time as if to test the dryness or otherwise of the dainty
morsel by means of the tactile sensibility of the membrane
lining the beak : the whole operation was a very solemn affair,
conducted with due gravity and often occupying a full ten
minutes. I once gave this Hornbill a small dead bird. She
eyed it attentively, and then, as if suddenly comprehending what
it was, quickly threw her wing over it to prevent its escape : the
crushing and swallowing programme followed in due course.
This Hornbill had a curious habit of shaking the feathers with
a tremulous movement as if shivering: this habit has also been
recorded of other picarian birds.
Coracias garrula (Roller.)
This lovely bird is only seen to advantage in a spacious
aviary, where it can fly freely and expand its silvery cobalt
wings, the full beauty of which can only be seen during flight.

captivity, and the only example I have ever seen alive was the
specimen which I recently secured for niv collection. Soon
after his arrival in the aviary this bird greatly distinguished
himself by his voracity, seizing a huge piece of suet which he
obstinately retained possession of, although a portion hung out
of his beak, still unswallowed, hours after he had first annexed
this bonne bouche. A full account of this beautiful bird in con-
finement would be a very interesting contribution to zoological
science.*! This remark also applies to the great majority of the
feathered tribe, many of whom are little known even in the
districts which they inhabit, whilst others, although common
enough in their own land, have, from various reasons, never
hitherto been brought alive to Europe.

SHOW.
This exhibition, which opened on February 13 and closed
five days later, contained some interesting and rare birds, though
it must be admitted that there were not very many kinds with
which the majority of aviculturists are not perfectly familiar.
The show was held under the rules of the Loudon and Provincial
Ornithological Society, whose Committee are to be congratulated
on the selection of experienced aviculturists for their Judges in
the British and foreign sections on the present occasion..
The first of the foreign bird classes was devoted to Love-
birds and Budgerigars, a pair of Agapomis roseicollis belonging
to Mr. J. Storey taking the first prize.
In the class for other Parrakeets and Lorikeets a pair of
Varied Lorikeets ( Ptilosclera versicolor) owned by Mr. L. W.
Hawkins were prominent, and well deserved the premier honours
on account of their being the first of their kind exhibited in this
country. They seemed to feel the situation keenly however.
The only food provided for them consisted of preserved yolk of
egg and honey, both of which appear to the writer to be

unsuitable. I have found that these beautiful Lorikeets do
very well indeed on a diet of sweetened milk sop, and ripe fruit
such as sweet-water grapes, of which they are exceedingly fond.
A nice Black - tailed Parrakeet ( Polytclis 77 iela 7 iura) was also
shown here, as well as a good many common kinds such as
Kings, Crimson - wings, Pennants, Rosellas, and the three
commoner species of Palceo 7 &apos; 7 iis.
There was little of special interest amongst the larger
Parrots. A pair of Swainson's Lorikeets were exhibited in this
class, and were 7 iot disqualified, both judge and exhibitor over-
looking the fact that they should have been in the previous
class.
The class for commoner foreign finches contained one
curiously-marked White-headed Mannikin, in which the throat
was entirely black ; it might well have been taken for a hybrid
between Munia viaja and M. atricapilla , and as these two
closely-allied forms appear to overlap one another's boundaries
the possibility of hybridisation is by no means remote. I believe
however it belonged to the rare form inhabiting Java, and
known as M. fe 7-7 7 ighiosa.
The class for the rarer Waxbills, Grassfinches and
Mannikins contained a bird that was a puzzle to a great many
aviculturists, and which was probably the first of its species
ever shown in this country. I took it to be a specimen of
Lag 07 iosticta 7 iiveig 7 cttata from East Africa.* This was shown by
Mr. L. W. Hawkins, and was rightly awarded the first prize.
Other notable birds in this class were, a pair of Blue Waxbills
(.Estrilda a?igole 7 isis), pairs of Ringed Finches ( Stictoptcra amm-
losa ), Double - banded Finches (S. biche 7 iovii), Rufous - tailed
Finches (. Bathilda ruficauda ), Pin-tailed Nonpareils (. Erythrura
prashia). Red - faced and Aurora - finches (. Pytelia afra and P.
ph&lt;# 7 iicoptera ) ; Gouldian, Long-tailed, and Masked Grassfinches.
The next class was devoted to " Grosbeaks, True Finches,
and Buntings," but contained little that was especially note-
worthy. Two pairs of Olive Finches ( Pho 7 iipara lepida ), a hen

Cuba Finch (P. canora), and a pair of Passer hiteiis (the cock of
which died during the show) were the most interesting exhibits.
Two cock Black - headed Buntings ( Emberiza melanocephala)
were shown as a pair for the second time, and were again
awarded a card by the Judge* (see Vol. VIII. p. 93). Surely the
Judges at important shows like this ought to know the difference
between the sexes of this very well-known European bird.
The class for Tanagers, Sugar-birds, Honey - eaters,
Zosterops, and Bulbuls, was perhaps the most interesting in
the show. Mr. L. W. Hawkins sent a Purple Sun-bird ( Arach-
nechthra zeylonica) which the Judge considered should have
been in another class, which is surely going too far. I11 a
popular sense at any rate any member of the sub - family
Nectariniida: should be entitled to a place in this class. Here is
a case of the Judge being hypercritical, whereas in another class
we see the other Judge passing a pair of Swainson's Lorikeets
in a class for the larger Parrots and Lories, when there was
clearly another class provided for them. The Purple Sun-bird is
an exceptionally difficult bird to keep in captivity, and all possible
credit should be given to the owner for exhibiting it in such
splendid condition. Mr. S. M. Townsend sent some rare and
beautiful Tanagers, the first prize going to a Tricolor ( Calliste
tricolor ), but I preferred his rarer Yellow Tanager (C. ftava).
Mr. J. A. Swan sent a fine specimen of the rare White - capped
Tanager ( Stephanophorus leucocephalus&apos;) from Argentina, and a
good Blue Sugar-bird (. Dacnis cayana). Mentioning the White-
capped Tanager reminds me that there is now, living in the
Zoological Gardens, a specimen of this species which has been
there for nearly twenty years. There were two good specimens
of Chloropsis hardwickii, and some of the commoner C. aurijrons.
There were two species of Zosterops , the common Z. simplex , and
a larger form which Mr. Fillmer tells me he believes is Z.
japonica: the latter seems to have been imported somewhat
freely of late.
The next class was devoted to all species that were not
eligible for the other classes, and here, as usual, were some

decidedly rare birds. First came Mr. L. W. Hawkins' very fine
Silver-eared Mesias (Mesia argentauris ) beautifully shown, and
in perfect condition. The same exhibitor sent a Blue-winged
Siva (Siva cyanuioptera), which was awarded third prize, Mr.
Osbaldeston showed a fine Green-billed Toucan which obtained
the second prize, and Mr. Townsend's Andaman Starling came
fourth. A fine Red-headed Hangnest (Amblyrhamphus holose-
riceus) passed unnoticed by the Judge.
Space will not permit of dealing with the British birds,
but mention must be made of an exceedngly beautiful albino, or
rather lutilo, Yellow-hammer. It had pink eyes, and the entire
plumage was of a pale canary-vellow.

THE QUAKER PARRAKEET AT LARGE.
A short note on an escaped specimen of Myiopsittacus
building a nest in a thatch in the New Forest appeared in this
Magazine for February, 1901, but a very much fuller account
of this interesting Parrakeet, by Mr. W. F. Rawnsley, is
published in the January number of the Zoologist. It appears
that the bird was first caught, apparently in a somewhat injured
state, in the heather of the open forest in August, 1899. It was
then caged, but managed to escape in the following June, when
it had fully recovered its powers of flight, and betook itself at
once to a farm near by, where it fed with the chickens. In
October, 1900, it commenced to weave a tunnel-shaped bower
with twigs, on the thatched roof of the farm-house, close to a
brick chimney-stack, in a position where shelter and warmth
were secured. In December the direction of the entrance was
changed, and the tunnel, which was about a yard in length, was
used as a sleeping place by the bird every night throughout the
winter. I11 the spring of the following year a second tunnel,
parallel to the first, was constructed, but this was soon blocked
up, and a third tunnel constructed above the second. The
mouth of this was turned round so as to prevent the rain from
the south-west blowing direct into the tunnel. In April, a new
thatch was put on the roof, but care was taken not to interfere

with the Quaker's nest, and its activity increased with the
advent of warm weather, " snipping off the twigs from a haw-
thorn hedge and carrying them in its beak, screeching as it flew,
with a very quick beat of its thin-pointed wings, and with its
pin-tail never spread. It worked most industriously, taking a
long time to fix each twig, and weaving them together very
neatly at the opening, which was about six inches across, and all
the way along the tunnel inside. The outside twigs, though
they all looked rather haphazard, were so interwoven that no
wind ever displaced them.
" By May it had greatly enlarged the pile, and had brought
it down and fastened it ingeniously to the elbow of the stack-
pipe, which gave increased stability, but made a bend in the
tunnel necessary. The whole structure was now seven or eight
feet long, and nearly three feet across at the lower end, and
with this the bird seemed content."
It was considered probable, from the bird's skill in nest-
building, that it was a female, and thinking it a pity that it
should not have a male, a second bird, supposed to be a male,
was procured, and the original bird having been caught in its
tunnel at night, the two were caged for a short time, and then
both released together. The new one never offered any
assistance in nest-building, though the original bird continued to
add to the nest. So long as the hedges remained bare, the only
nesting material used was the prickly hawthorn twigs, but when
the hedges became green, the tops of the pea-sticks were used.
The new bird became mischievous, picking off the green
apples, and so had to be captured and caged, and his mate had to
share the same fate in case she should also have learnt this
objectionable trick. Unfortunately a rat got into the cage and
killed the new bird, and so all hope of successful breeding was
at an end. The original bird was set free again, and lived until
June, 1902, after which it was seen no more.
We sincerely hope that Mr. Rawnsley's very interesting
experience with this nest-building Parrot will induce others who
live in the country to try the experiment of releasing a pair or
two of these birds and to let us know the result.

(Extract from a letter addressed to the Honorary Secretary ).
Sir,--I do not quite agree with you re the Malabar Bulbul. I have
had between seventy and eighty of these birds during the past year, and
am confident that sixteen at least were not the Aurifrons. The blue formed
a complete bib, and the black extended farther down the breast, the birds
being at least an inch longer and deeper in green than Aurifrons.
I see you give the Blue-winged as Chloropsis hodgsoni. I always
thought it was C. hardwickii , but have only Jerdon to go by. Aurifrons is
known in Calcutta as the Goruckpore Flycatcher, Hardwickii as the
Bareilly Flycatcher ; and it is from Bareilly that the rarest birds of the hills
are brought.

(Vol. VII. p. 12) are not recognised in modern books ; and when I wrote the

Fruitsucker, Chloropsis hardwickii , in my mind.

under notice the great inconvenience and annoyance that are caused by the
use of obsolete names, both English and scientific. So loosely are names
now used that it is sometimes difficult, sometimes impossible , to know what
species is referred to.
I11 the early days of the Avicultural Society, it was resolved that the
scientific names given in the British Museum Catalogue of Birds should be
used by r us as far as practicable. I have myself kept to this rule, but it has
very generally been ignored by the other members, I regret to say.
I am not without hopes, however, that steps we are now endeavouring
to arrange may lead to an improvement, not only as regards the use of
scientific, but also as regards the so-called "trivial " names of birds.
A name ceases to be of practical use when no definite subject is
connected with it. It is simply an " uncertain sound." -- R. P.]
THE ALL-GREEN PARROT.
Sir, --I have been asked to send a few notes to the Magazine on the
All-Green Parrot, Chrysotis agilis, which I have had some time. This bird
(sex unknown) is of a lovely emerald green on head, back, and wings;
breast, a vivid grass green, and much lighter. The wings underneath are
dark blue shaded to green, and four short red feathers lie on the blue, but
are not seen unless the wings are open. At present the wing feathers are
very rough and ragged, having been cut before it came to this country.
The bird was brought from Jamaica by Mrs. Leslie Williams, and,
apparently, must have been in its first plumage, as it has grown since I had
it. It is about the size of a Pigeon, and weighs ten ounces. The beak is
grayish ; eyes, dark brown ; and there is, on each side of the head near
the eyes, a small patch of brown feathers; legs and feet, gray.
The bird is very tame, and lets one handle it freely, and is of a very
jealous disposition, and cannot bear to see any other bird noticed. It was
great friends with my dear old favourite " Sweetie," the Blue Mountain
Lorikeet, and for some time lived in the same cage ; but one day there was
a serious quarrel, and the apparently happy couple had to be separated, and
never again would either enter the other's cage. M. Hamilton.

Sir,--I t may interest members to hear that, whilst visiting at a farm
house in Anglesey, I saw three Grey Parrots which had one wing clipped,
otherwise they were allowed perfect freedom. The owner informed me
that they had been out for some mouths, that they all roosted in a wooden
box which was put out for them, and that they were let out every day, no
matter what the weather was like. The day 011 which I saw them was

bitterly cold with heavy showers, but the birds appeared to be thoroughly
enjoying themselves in the trees, and were in very nice feather, excepting
of course the clipped wing. This was the first time I had ever seen Grey
Parrots in freedom, so I was naturally very interested.

THE PIN-TAILED WHYDAH.
Vidua principalis.
Sir, -- I should be so glad if you could give a little advice in the
Avicultural Magazine on the treatment and feeding of Wliydalis.
I have a pair, bought at different times, that I put together in a large
aviarv-cage indoors. They agreed perfectly for many weeks, when the cock
turned spiteful, and would I feared have killed the hen, so I separated
them by a wire division ; and for many weeks they have lived peaceably in
adjoining compartments. But, during the last two days, his spiteful fit has
returned, and they mutually fight through the bars, both with outstretched
wings and with angry sounding notes. I can find no history of them in
any of the Avicultural Magazines--and I have them all--fori am an original
member of the old Society, and have a large number of birds.
I feed them on Indian millet, white millet, and canary seed. They
are both very healthy and lively. They are not Paradise Wliydalis, but the
kind with Skylark markings and a dark tail. The cock is only two years
old I believe, and has not a very long tail but it is getting on.
B. Mortimer.
The folloioing reply was sent to Mrs Mortimer:
If j'our birds are the Pin-tailed Whydah, the male is almost invariabl} r
an exceptionally vicious and spiteful creature, not always at first, but
getting worse and worse as he grows older and more accustomed to his
surroundings, attacking almost every inmate of the aviary that he dares to,
besides the males of his own kind. In a large aviary, however, he usually
pursues his own and the females of other species, with comical aerial
dance, mote from love than spite; for these birds in the wild state have
many wives, who nest in the long grass in open spaces, whilst he goes
dancing about in the air above them. The female has never given me any
trouble when loose in the aviary.
The only treatment for the male that I can suggest is to keep him b} r
himself, or with large birds which will not stand his nonsense.
In a cage, the male Pin-tailed Whydah is rather w T asted, as his great
attraction is his dancing on the wing in the open aviary.
It is a very simple feeder, the seeds you mention being quite sufficient,
but you might add spray millet.

Sir, --I have just received six Parrakeets said to be Plumheads.
Three have red patches on the wings or shoulders; three have not these
patches; they all have lavender heads, but the three without the red
patches have a shade of red or blush, not a real red, in the blue or lavender.
What I wish to know is this: in Parrots in Captivity it states that the young
and the hen have no red patch on the wings, yet three of these have the
red patch on the wings, and the lavender head. Can yon explain this?
I am feeding on hemp, canary, millet, and oats, and as they are newly
imported I have them in the kitchen in a large cage. They are in good
feather. F. H. Rudkin.
The following answer ivas sent to Mr. Rudkin :
I think the only explanation of your difficulty must be, that you have
received two species--the true Plum-head or Blossom-head ( Palceornis
cyanocephalus) and the Burmese Blossom-head or Rosa's Parrakeet (P. rosa).
The three with no red patches, but with traces of red in the lavender
of the head, are probably young males of P. cyanocephalus and will develop
the red shoulder-mark as the red on the head becomes more pronounced.
The three with lavender heads and red shoulder patches are hens of
P. rosa, the Burmese type.
That the two birds are probably imported mixed together, is not
surprising. At the Crystal Palace last year I believe a male Plum-liead was
exhibited with a female of Rosa's Parrakeet (as a pair).

The following advice has been sent to a member in reply to a query:
A Goldfinch should be fed upon two parts best canary, one part
German rape, one part hemp, a little teasel, thistle, or dandelion ; all three
if easily obtainable.
During the winter, if you grow some rape seedlings in a box, and cut
some of the cress daily for the bird, he will much appreciate it. In the
summer, groundsel and chickweed may be given instead.

Sir, -- I have a young Grey Parrot, supposed to have been brought to
En&amp;quot;land last March. He is clean moulted, tail just showing; eyes just
turning yellow since here; eats with relish white bread soaked in tea, or
milk that has been scalded. He will not touch anything else, with the
exception of Parrot maize, and that I do not think he eats; he seems only
to powder it up, as I find almost the same amount of powder as there was
maize given him (that is only when I have withheld the bread to see if I
cannot make him eat corn or otherwise). He always has a tin of mixed
seed and a tin of maize in his cage, also grit. We have tried him all ways
to eat fruit of all kinds, also nuts, but he will not touch them ; he will take
a small piece of orange, and that is all.
He sits on his perch all day without moving, unless made to come to
the bottom of the cage for his food. His head feathers are almost ahvays
erect, and he looks a perfect picture of misery. He utters no sound, only
when he sees his food (the soaked bread) he squeaks once or twice. Up to
a day or two ago he used to make a horrible row whenever I went near his
cage, but he has stopped that now ; it seems too much trouble for him to
move, he sleeps nearly all day, and I think he gets thinner.
I had him in a small cage, as I-thought being a young bird he would
be better, but have removed him into a large cage to see if it w r ould make
him better, but no good. When he evacuates he does so with a squeaking
noise, and mostly his evacuations are frothy when first passed. He wakes
up and cleans himself now and again, but in a way that appears a great
trouble for him to even do that. Thinking it was his liver, we have given
him a few drops of aconite and mercurium in his chilled water. He has
been here since December 8th.
Can you tell me what is the matter with him, and what I can give
him ? He looks (when his feathers are done properly, which is not often)
quite well, and a rather nice looking bird. Hy. J. Bull.
P.S.--I might say he is in the same room as my other birds : an
Amazon, African Grey and Yellow Crested Cockatoo; and my wife is in and
out all day, so it is not as if he were by himself. --H. B.
The following reply has been sent lo Mr. Bull:
You are feeding your bird most improperly, and if you continue the
treatment you will most certainly lose it before long.
The larger parrots, and in fact all but the Lories, Lorikeets, and one
or two others, are naturally extremely dry feeders : they drink water only,

once or at most twice in the (lay, when at liberty; and the only other
moisture which they swallow is in the form of fruit.
To feed a Grey Parrot upon sop, and especially sop flavoured with
tannin, is to ruin its digestion and undermine its constitution.
A Grey Parrot when first imported may have a little boiled maize
daily in addition to dry seed ; because, when in the nest, it has been fed
upon partly digested cereals and fruit (probably plantains) ]&amp;gt;y its parents;
but as soon as it eats dry seed freely, boiled maize may be discontinued,
though a little occasionally will not hurt. From the first, banana, sweet-
water grapes, ripe orange, pear, or sweet apple should be given daily ; dry
plain biscuits, such as captains, cracknels, or arrowroot are always good;
and nuts, especially walnuts. When in season green peas in the pod are
much appreciated.
The best seed-mixture for a Grey Parrot consists of wheat, dari,
hemp, and canary ; the last three in equal parts by measure, the first about
half as much as of the others or it will be wasted, unless the bird is really
hungry.
It is of no use to say the bird will not eat these things; it must eat
them if it is to live and become healthy. What do you do to a child if it
will not eat wholesome food? Do you immedately offer it something
poisonous to tempt its palate? Jf it is hungry it will eat: a little healthy
hunger never killed anything yet. A. G. BUTJ.KK.
MOCKING-BIRDS.
Sir, --I should be much obliged if you would kindly let me know if I
could safely keep (without danger to the other birds) a pair of Mocking-
birds (presumably Mimicspatachonicnsf in the same aviary with Virginian
Cardinals and Blue Robins? also whether, if I added a hen polyglollus, the
two Mocking liens would quarrel ? I propose to turn out these Mocking-
birds in April: would that be too early ?
The aviary is a large one, about 20ft. long by 15ft. in width, and well
planted with shrubs, with a warm shelter at one end.
Frkdkkic Waij.op.
The Jolloicing answer has been sent to the Hon. Frederic Wallop:
From what I know of the behaviour of Minins polyglollus, when
associated (without a wife) with other birds as large as, or larger than,
itself; I should be afraid that, when it had a wife to protect, it would not
be content merely with scaring and chasing its companions; but would do
its best to kill them.

Virginian Cardinals would probably be able to bold tlieir own ; but
Blue Robins would be tolerably sure to be killed. With the exception of
Doves, I have not found the hens of birds very quarrelsome; but it is
possible that the cock Minins patcigonicus might persecute the hen M.
polyglottus, if his proper mate were also with him ; that you can only
decide by experiment, being at hand to catch out the Northern bird if
necessary.

BREEDING BIRDS IN IMMATURE PLUMAGE.

Sir, --The very interesting account of the breeding of the Satin
Bower-bird in the December number of the Magazine records an instance
of the rather unusual occurrence of a bird breeding in the immature, or
rather perhaps more properly, imperfect, plumage.
These male Bower-birds are described in the article referred to as
being out of colour; but one was gradually assuming his proper dress at
the time that he was assisting at the nesting operations.
Some of the larger birds of prey, which are long-livers, and slow to
attain maturity, breed before assuming the perfectly adult plumage. I
have a photograph before me of an old friend, now 7 dead, taken in Norw&apos;ay,
with a recently-caught female Goshawk seated on bis wrist. This bird was
snared on her nest, and with her brood, brought in from a long distance by
some country people, w&apos;ho had seen an advertisement offering a reward for
young Goshawks for training purposes. The picture clearly shows that
the bird was in the plumage of the second summer. The poor thing w 7 as
almost exhausted for want of food, but by patience and skill my friend
restored her to perfect health, and released her before returning to
England
Though I cannot find the reference, I feel sure that I have read of an
escaped Peregrine (trained) being shot at the nest in the North of Scotland,
with his jesses on, and in the red plumage. I knew myself of a male
Gold-Pheasant which bred in the aviary of a fellow-member of this Society
before coming into colour.
But, as far as my experience goes, these cases are uncommon, and
seem to deserve notice.

Sir, -- I am anxious to know whether you or any of your readers
could name the following birds which I will try to describe. They were
brought by a friend of mine from Cape Colony about three weeks ago. A
professional bird catcher caught them for him near Middleburg, where he
has often seen them flying about -- there are five Weavers (?), three cocks
and two hens. They are like in shape to my Orange Bishops.
The hens are grey and the cocks have a black mask, orange-red
ring about a quarter of au inch wide round head and throat, dull orange
shoulders merging into bright orange-red to just beyond root of tail, velvet
black from orange band round throat, all underneath up to root of tail where
there is a patch of orange. They have far more black than my birds : wings
and short tail same as my Bishops. I enclose feathers to show colour, as it
seems rather different to mine. As I am on a visit I cannot see the birds
together. The other birds are tw T o Cape Canaries and three small Waxbills,
and then there are two I want named: About the size of a Chaffinch,
beak like Bullfinch, head and throat a bronze-red, the}&apos; look as if they had
not quite got their colour yet. Breast and flanks laced like Silver
Wyandotte fowls. I enclose feathers. The lacing becomes light brown
underneath, merging into white below tail, wings and tail same as feathers
I enclose with irregular markings, back light brown, tail slight, about one
and a half inches long. They have a little warbling song and stretch
themselves out like Cutthroats when they sing. The natives call them

The following reply has been sent to Lady Dunlcath :--
I think there can be no doubt that the Weaver is the smaller variety
of the Oryx Weaver (Grenadier) to which the name of P. sundevalli has been
given. It was supposed to represent the more northern race of the species,
but is said not to be constant.
The other, I should say, has been correctly identified as the Red-
headed Finch (Amadina erythrocephala), but the colouring of the head has
probably not been perfectly developed yet, and will become dull blood-red
instead of bronze-red. I suppose the feathers you sent are from either the
breast or flanks, the huffish tint being confined to the centre of the feather
behind the black and white bars.

By Mrs. Gregory.
(Continued from page ibo).
The voice of the Crowned Crane is much less loud and
more melodious than that of any of the other Cranes, with the
exception, Tegetmeier says, of the Asiatic White Crane (Grus
leucogeranus ), whose cry he describes as being " very feeble--a
mere chirrup for so large a bird." To explain this he says, in
The Natural History of the Cranes, " In general, the trachea (of
Cranes) is elongated and forms a convolution within a cavity in
the keel of the breast bone, but it is remarkable that this
structure does not occur in the Crowned Crane (Balearica )."
My bird makes no sound (beyond a "cluck" of pleasure some-
times) unless he is frightened, either by the approach of a
stranger or the sight of a few feathers on the ground ; even at a
few little Sparrows' feathers I have seen him stop with a most
alarmed look, and croak loudly many times.
His walk is slow and stately, but he can run at a great
pace, with wings outspread. His habits are retiring ; at first he
was so shy his great idea seemed to be to hide himself, and I
often had a difficulty in finding him, for he generally selected
pampas grass to stand or lie behind ; and his wonderful buff-
coloured crest so much resembled the grass in colour, and made
him so difficult to see, that I sometimes wondered if this crown
could have been given him as " protective colouring."
He is very fond of water, and the last hour or two before
retiring for the night he spends by the side of a pond, standing

so close to the edge that he sometimes has to spread his wings
to prevent himself from falling in. Before he was pinioned, he
used to fly on to the rocks&apos; in the centre of the pool, and
made a beautiful picture standing there flapping his large white
wings.
Cranes are wonderfully intelligent! As an instance of
this, my bird has learnt to pick up with his beak a string which
is tied to the lid of a tin box, in which his seed is kept; the
other end of the string is fastened to a window, from which it
can be pulled to shut the box when the Sparrows come in flocks
to steal the grain. At first the Crane stood patiently by waiting
for me to do this for him ; now he has learnt to open the box
himself ; perhaps some day he will close it after him ! !
My last remark is, I am astonished that these particular
Cranes are not more frequently kept in captivity. They have
not a single fault as far as I can discover. Unlike other
members of the family, they do not dig up newly planted turfs,
destroy borders, and root out bulbous plants. Above all, their
almost musical and seldom sounding voice makes them
irreproachable pets where neighbours have to be considered.

Myiophoneus temmincki.
By The Rev. Hubert D. Asteey, M.A.
Through Mr. Phillipps' courtesy I became the proud
possessor, last September (1902), of two Blue Whistling Thrushes
(Temminck's) which at that time, and indeed it may still be the
case, w 7 ere I believe the 011I3 7 specimens in Europe.
Mr. Phillipps most kindly sent them to me in Italy at the
hands of a friend, who must have wished me, or at any rate the
* Mr. Astley's name of Blue Whistling&apos; Thrush belongs to Af. cceruleus (Avic. Aiag.
VII., 209), a Chinese species very like it but with a black bill, which has been repre-
sented at the Zoo. Mr. Astley's species is Temmiuck's or The Himalayan Whistling-
bird.
I have before remarked (VII., pp. 203-4) that the usual name of Whistling "Thrush "
for birds of the genus Myiophoneus is incongruous and misleading, That of " Whistiiug-
bird " would be better, and would readily lend itself to adoption from its similarity to the
other.--R. P.

Thrushes, at the bottom of the sea. But my great pleasure at
receiving them safely after two days and one night's journey,
seemed to compensate the bearer for any trouble he had in
conveying them.
Mr. Phillipps had had them a very short time in his care,
and had not had much opportunity for knowing them at all
intimately, and he wrote to me to say that the bird he considered
the male was less shy than the other (whose sex he was doubtful
about), but that the other was terribly timid, and he advised me
to give it some nook into or behind which it could shelter.
Then, too, this one had fits, whilst the other was by no means in
robust health ; indeed both birds were in a precarious condition
when received by Mr. Phillipps. Whether it was the beautiful
climate of the Italian Riviera, or what, I can't say. That
certainly would very easily account for the rapid recovery to
robust health which both of the Blue Whistling Thrushes under-
went, but did it also account for their change of demeanour?
Mr. Phillipps had warned me not to handle them if I could
help it, but if there is a thing I do dislike to see, it is a bird
that ought to be very handsome, which is rendered the reverse
by a half-inch of broken stumps instead of a tail, so that I
couldn't resist removing these stumps from the bird that was
very evidently a male, at the risk of rendering him more timid
than he was already said to be.
On the following day he very much enjoyed a bath in the
sunshine of an Italian day in early Autumn, and from his whole
demeanour I began to think that he must be like some people
who conceal their natural shyness under a bold manner. Two
days after they arrived, I went so far as to venture to let
" Tommy " (the one whom I had welcomed by tweaking out his
apology for a tail) come out of his cage in the dining room, so
at home did he seem. Certainly I expected he would probably
dash wildly about when once he found he was out of his cage:
instead of which he hopped about the floor as if he had been
there all his life. A small piece of Gruyere cheese was thrown
to him, which he at once swallowed. After lunch his protector
(on his journey out) sat down on a sofa and placed a piece of

cheese on his knee. Tommy, from the floor, stretched himself
up on tip-toe, peered about, and without more to-do hopped on
to the sofa by his side, and thence on to his arm where he very
quickly seized the piece of cheese offered in his fingers. And
this was the shy, timid bird that I must take care not to disturb,
or handle ! ! Would Mr. Phillipps have ever spared him to me,
could he have seen him then ? ! ! I shouldn't have blamed him,
if he hadn't.
And after a fortnight I hardly dared let him out ! and
why ? simply because he had become so arrogant and autocratic,
that he flew at me like a furious game-cock, settling on my hand,
and pecking till he drew blood.
I11 three days' time after his arrival, he began to sing,
sotto voce ; to record, as they say, and a very pretty warble it
was, sometimes like a Blackbird's, but intermingled with curious
bubbling and guttural notes, which remind me of the manner
in which a Blue Rock Thrush sings.
By the iotli of November his new tail was full grown, and
his whole plumage, from daily baths, wholesome food, and fresh
air by day and night, in beautiful condition.
As to the other one, which at first I thought to be a
female, but about whose sex I am now doubtful*, it is true that
for a tew days it was decidedly timid, but not too timid in the
small out-door aviary in which I had placed it, to come down
and take a bath as well as food within two yards of me. The
traces of fits, about which Mr. Phillipps had warned me, were
still visible in a certain twirling of the head and an unsteadiness
of gait, but in a week those symptoms had quite disappeared, and
the bird was as strong as possible, very quickly becoming glossy
in plumage, and tamer. But in a week this bird also was
'recording' in exactly the same tones as 'Tommy'; so that,
although hen birds of some species, especially perhaps of the
Thrush family, do record in Autumn, I began to wonder whether
that also might turu out to be a male. The sexes are alike
in the Myiophoneus family (I believe), but this second bird is
more slender in shape, more leggy, and of more feminine
March, 1903. There is now not much doubt that it is a male bird also.--H. I). A.

appearance, although this may be merely a matter of being
more juvenile than the other one.
Myiophoneus temmincki is a native of the Himalayan range
as far as the Tenasserim provinces. Colonel Irby has recorded
in the Ibis that he found it common in Kumaou in May (iS5g),
and adds that it is rather solitary in it's habits.
Mr. W. E. Brooks (Ibis, i86g) wrote that he saw this bird
several times, generally by rocky and mountain torrents, and
that it's song is pretty and Thrush-like. He observed these
birds near Myree Tal and Almorah.
Jerdon says that the extent of the wing is 21 inches, and
adds (Ibis, 1872)--" I have found this bird in various localities
in the N. W. Provinces, viz : near Saharaupore, in the Byuori
district, and also in the Punjab. I found it's nest near
Mussooree, in a hole in a cliff at the very edge of the Batta
waterfall. It breeds at a height of 8,000 feet, in the end of May.
This beautiful bird is also generally distributed over the lesser
ranges and valleys of Cashmere, where it frequents mountain
streams, and builds a nest like that of a Blackbird, to which in
habits and general appearance it bears a resemblance.
" It's note is musical, slow and measured.
"It's food consists of insects and larvae."
Gould (Century of Birds&apos;) has written that this species fully
equals in size the Myiophoneus flavirostris, and is adorned with
plumage, if possible, still more intense and brilliant in colour.
The principal characteristics however (he adds) which dis-
tinguish the species from the Javanese bird (M. flavirostris) are
it's more slender beak, more lengthened tarsi, and a tail longer in
proportion to the dimensions of the body. Gould also records
that M. temmincki is found equally in the warm regions of the
Doon, and the colder temperature of the higher grounds--that
it's native name is Kuljet, and that it's habits and actions, when
on the ground, much resemble those of the English Blackbird.
The general plumage is black with azure reflections ; the
forehead and shoulders bright lapis-lazuli blue. Each feather
on the back, as well as on the sides of the neck and chest, is

glazed along it's centre, which gives to those parts of the bird a
metallic lustre. This peculiar glossy glaze is most difficult to
reproduce in a water-colour painting.
The wings and tail, which in the shade appear to be
almost black, flash out into a superb and brilliant deep blue in
the sunlight. There are small triangular white spots on the
tips of the feathers of the greater wing coverts. The quills are
black, the bill orange-yellow, but stained with brown on the
upper mandible, whilst the legs and feet are black.
In an aviary, and especially at first sight, the Blue
Whistling Thrush resembles a gigantic Blackbird (Turdus
vieridd), both in movements and appearance, but it has one
very characteristic action of the tail, peculiar to it's particular
family, I should imagine. Upon settling on a branch, or on
being startled in any way, the tail is jerked up and down two or
three times, and then fanned out laterally, exactly as if a string
was being pulled inside, and also in just such a manner as a
lady's fan is quickly opened and shut. The whole tail is spread
out somewhat slowly into this broad fan form, to be immediately
shut up again sharply, when it is again extended, and the action
again repeated several times.
A more charming pet I have never possessed, for it
combines extreme rarity (as regards a European cage-bird),
great beauty, audacious tameness, and a charming song.
In addition to this, I do not think the Blue Whistling
Thrush, breeding as it does at a height of 8,000 feet, can be a
delicate bird.
I feed these two on Abrahams' egg bread, ants' cocoons
and silkworm cocoons, about which latter I should like to say a
word. In Italy one can buy a large sack for 20 francs, all ready
pounded up, and being quite dry, it will keep any length of
time. It is rather strong smelling ' en masse,' but that is not
noticeable in a small quantity sufficient for a day's feed. It is
composed of the large cocoons of the silkworms, which are put
aside after the silk has been wound off for the manufactories*.
* It would be more correct to say chrysalides, or pupae; the cocoons are the outer
coverings which are wound off.--A. G. B.

In Italy Blue Thrushes, Rock Thrushes, Blackbirds, and
Nightingales, etc: are almost invariably fed on these pounded
silkworm cocoons mixed with " farina," which is ground maize.
I recall that some mention was made of this insectivorous food,
by Mr. Phillipps I think, in one of the summer numbers of 1902,
as being something new to him ; but I have known of it for
some fifteen years, and cannot imagine why I never introduced
it into England for my birds, and perhaps also for other people's
too.
I now feed my pair of Hunting Cissas on it, as well as
any other insectivorous birds that I have, and find they like it
well after the first two or three days of introducing it to them.
Given plain and in too great a proportion, it might be over-
heating, but I haven't found it so.
The Blue Whistling Thrushes are very fond of fruit, and
when my Italian garden yielded it's vintage, they would swallow
three or four grapes one after the other, ejecting later on the
pips, but not, as far as I could see, the skins.
They are birds that love their baths very much, and a fine
splashing they make in a fair-sized pie-dish, which is none
too large for them.
[Since writing this, word has been sent me that it is not intended to
reproduce my water-colour painting in colours. This I regret, as though
but an amateur artist, the drawing was sufficiently like the original to
show our members in one moment by a picture, what one cannot do in one
year by a verbal description.
As I believe I possess the only two living specimens of Myiophoneus
temmincki in Europe, and as those two are at this moment in Italy, I fear
I cannot lend them to a professional artist for the purpose of painting
them, whereby the Society is a loser.--H. D. A.]

By W. H. St. Quintin, P&apos;.Z.S.
There can be no doubt that, as the writer of the interesting
paper on the Ruff in the February number of the Magazine says,
the members of this family of birds are, to those who can
contrive a roomy aviary, with grass lawn, and abundance of
clean water, among the most charming of pets. If my
experience, especially as to diet, is likely to be of any use to
those who may be inclined to try Waders, but are deterred by
fear of trouble or cost, I shall be happy to give it.
In the first place, let me say that my experience entirety
confirms what Mr. Porter says as to the hardiness of many of the
Waders. I find that, if obtained with sound feet to begin with,
several species, especially if full-winged, are quite indifferent to
any frost that we ever have, even in East Yorkshire. And, if
the aviary has a lean-to shed at one end, facing South, as a
refuge, with clean gravel beneath it, even deep snow makes no
apparent difference to their comfort, if care is taken that they
always have access to unfrozen water.
(This does not apply to Snipe, W 7 oodcocks, Dunlins or
Dotterel, nor to some other birds, not Waders proper, but which
may be associated with the latter in mild weather, such as
Spoonbills, or the smaller Herons, Bitterns, etc.)
My own Waders' aviary is 73 feet long, and 31 feet wide,
with a lean-to shed at the North end, and a pond with a stream
running through it near the opposite end, about 21 feet by 10
feet.
Some yews and hollies, kept low, afford shelter on the
East. And I found it necessary to board up the sides, and the
South end of the aviary, to a height of 18 inches. This gives
shelter from wind, and prevents the occupants, when new
comers, from fretting up and down against the wire netting.
Part of the ground is gravelled over, part is under turf;
and I have tussocks, and clumps of the coarser grasses here and
there to give shelter and a sense of security.
Here I have kept for several 3&apos;ears, and apparently in

thoroughly comfortable imprisonment, Knots, Ruffs and Reeves,
Bartailed Godwits, Redshanks, Waterrails, Landrails, Common
Sandpipers, Lapwings, Stonecurlews, besides Nutcrackers,
Siberian Larks, and sometimes in summer Pintailed, and Black-
bellied Sandgrouse, and Chinese Ouail.
But far the most delightful of all the non-waders were
some half dozen Pratincoles, which were turned out for the
summer about three years ago. They charmed everybody by
their agile flight, and lively movements, running along the
gravel, chasing the flies which visited the food dishes, or hovering
like Terns before the door, if they thought that I had some meal-
worms to show to them. Unfortunately we had a visitation of
Sparrowhawks which, in spite of all the measures that we could
devise, relentlessly persecuted the inmates of this aviary, which
is some way from the house, and near a wood. Of course the
Hawks could not touch the birds ; but they caused several of
them, especially the Knots and the Pratincoles, to dash them-
selves against the wires in their panic ; several being killed
outright, and others having to be destroyed as being injured
beyond recovery.
In the end I had to withdraw the Pratincoles, and to
shorten the wings (both) of the Knots. The Redshanks, and
Ruffs, and Reeves I have been able to leave full-winged, and never
found them to touch the wires, except on one occasion when a
very small Weasel contrived to get into the aviary, and then I
lost a Ruff and a Reeve.
And now I come to the question of diet. My Waders
scarcely ever see a mealworm ; but they manage to capture a
good many insects which find their way into the aviary,
especially in spring and summer. Twice a day a flat dish is put
in, containing Spratts Poultry Meal and crissel scalded, and
mixed with a little insect food (dried corixae, and ants' cocoons, I
believe), and made into a crumbly mass with ground oats.
Another dish contains some finely chopped sheep's heart, liver,
or rabbit; but the former is the best.
The birds thrive on this diet, and the Ruffs assume, and
throw off, their extraordinary nuptial dress completely, and at

the proper seasons: which goes a long way to prove health and
condition.
One of my Reeves has nested these last three summers ;
hollowing out a cup-shaped depression in a tuft of grass, much as
a Dunlin does. She has not always been fortunate in her choice
of site, and last year her eggs were broken (we suspected the
Stonecurlews). But in 1901 a young bird was hatched, though it
did not leave the nest. This was probably owing to the aviary
being rather overstocked. Each time the little bird left her
eggs or returned to them, she was attended by an interested
party of her companions, and incubation was carried on under
great difficulties.
Reeves and Redshanks do not require much cover for
their nests. If the grass is allowed to grow in patches six or
eight inches high, that is quite enough. The rest of the lawn is
better kept mown close.
HOW NOT TO BREED REDRUMPS.
By Emily Brampton.
We have read in the Magazine many interesting accounts
of the successful rearing of various foreign birds, but we do not
often see accounts of the other side of the picture.
Rearing birds has been called &apos;* The triumph of hope over
experience," and sometimes I am inclined to think that other
members get all the experience, while little more than the hope
falls to my share. Of that I have always an unlimited quantity.
Being fired with the ambition to rear some young Redrumps,
I purchased a beautiful pair of these birds two years ago, and
turned them into my Cockatiels' aviary. The new arrivals were
certainly young and skittish, and they soon made it evident that
they did not intend to be dull themselves, or to let me be so.
There were two pairs of Cockatiels in the aviary, and no
sooner did these unlucky birds decide on a nest-box and get
comfortably settled in, than the Redrumps came down like
wolves on the fold, evicting the rightful tenants, and taking

on how not to Breed Redrumps.
possession themselves! There was generally one egg at least
in the boxes when these raids took place, but they were easily
rolled into a corner and gave the conquerors no trouble. This
see-saw backwards and forwards was very bewildering tome;
and apparently the Cockatiels found it the same; for first one
hen and then the other gave up the struggle and quietly died,
and the two disconsolate widowers were removed to more
peaceful quarters.
Last season the Redrumps had the aviary to themselves,
and again they did their best to give me an interesting summer.
In February the cock started feeding the hen, so I put up the
nest boxes, artfully concealed among furze and dead branches,
and supplied a more generous diet.
For weeks they played in and out of the boxes as they had
done the previous season, but in May the hen disappeared and
remained invisible for seventeen days, while the cock^kept guard
at the entrance of one of the boxes. When the young might be
expected to hatch, extra seeds, especially hemp, were supplied
regularly, with fresh groundsel twice or three times a day; and
no doubt the birds had a royal time. I believe they were clever
enough to know why the good living was supplied, and organised
a regular campaign to cause it to continue. Whenever they
heard me approach the aviary the cock would give warning,
and the hen would race into the nest, while he kept guard at
the doorway, and reported my movements. If, however,
I came up undiscovered, he was scolding her in a most
ill-tempered fashion, and these two changes of attitude used
to puzzle me considerably.
At last, after seven weeks of patient feeding, no young
birds making their appearance, I looked into the box. Even
then the hen managed to slip past me and gain the nest
unnoticed, evidently trying to pass herself off as a young bird;
but though the interior of the box was rather dark I discovered
the fraud. Further examination showed one clear egg and not
even a piece of shell of any other.
Even then the birds tried their old tactics for a day or
two, but, finding no more dainties forthcoming, settled down to

a plain diet of millet and canary, and the remembrance of
past luxury.
They evidently mean me to have not even hope next
season, for the hen has developed every symptom of French
moult, and is climbing about the aviary with a very short
allowance of flight and tail feathers*.
THE CHIFFCHAFF AS A CAGE BIRD.
By C. M. Mayor.
This pretty and diminutive Summer migrant is not, I
believe, often seen as a cage-bird. As such, perhaps some people
may think, it has little to recommend it; but, though its song
may not be very pretentious, it is an engaging and very active
little bird, and becomes very tame in the house.
In South Devon the Chiffchaff usually arrives about the
latter end of March, and some few are supposed to stay through
the winter. I have records by a careful observer in this district
for most years since 1879, the earliest date on which he has first
seen or heard the Chiffchaff being March 2nd in 1883, and the
latest April 18th in 1900. It is certainly noticeable that in some
years the bird is much more abundant than in others. In the
Spring of 1893, for instance, we observed abnormally large
numbers about our garden and the lanes of the neighbourhood.
Often in March we experience a combination of hot sun and cold
East wind, and at such times these little birds are very fond of
frequenting the South walls of houses, an examination of which
will generally reveal plenty of flies, sleepy bluebottles, and such
like, enjoying a sunbath. Many of these insects probably fall
a prey to the Chiffcliaffs, and are sometimes pursued right into
the rooms if the windows be open, as we have observed on more
than one occasion.
I11 the Spring of 1891 I found a nest low down in a rough
tangle of bramble by the side of a ditch. It contained six
3&apos;ouugsters, and in a few daj^s, when they were sufficiently

advanced, I took the nest and its contents, and carefully placed
it in a small wicker basket. One nestling appeared decidedly
weak -- a sort of "parson's pig" -- and this one subsequently died.
I fed them from the first on soaked ants' eggs -- previously
picked over--and small mealworms which I always broke in two
before using. I was fortunate in having a good supply of these
latter from an old mill near by. And what beauties they were !
As fat as they could be, and so active that you would hardly
think the poor skinny, sluggish creatures often supplied by
dealers could possibly be the same insect. The young birds got
along excellently on this diet, varied as much as I could with
caterpillars, flies, etc. As soon as they evinced the desire to
leave the nest, I put the five of them into a flannel cricket cap in
a clean basket. After a few more days, however, when I opened
the lid to feed them, they began to hop out like so many " Jacks-
in-the-box," so I transferred them to a warm roomy cage, wired
only in the front, where they soon managed to feed themselves.
But long after they could well do this, they always opened their
little beaks and cried out when anybody approached them.
It seems somewhat inhuman, but I found it an excellent
plan to cut up the mealworms with a pair of scissors into the
dish containing the dry ants'eggs, which adhered to the pieces
of worm, so that both were consequently eaten together. Other-
wise the birds would never have taken to ants' eggs alone.
After a time they fed freely 011 these,--either dry, just as bought,
or soaked,--together with preserved yolk of eggs and a free
addition of mealworms.
When the young birds were grown and had moulted they
got in beautiful condition, and became very tame. One cock I
separated from the others, as he was the finest of the brood.
Unfortunately he made his escape through the wires of the cage
into a conservatory, got out of the open window and no doubt
joined his wild brothers, though history does not relate how
he was received by them, or what was his ultimate fate.
I must say I was very pleased with the four remaining.
There was something so neat and trim about the little fellows as
to provoke admiration from any lover of birds. I was per-

suaded to exhibit two of them at a certain Show that shall be
nameless, and this I subsequently had great cause to regret, as
one of them caught cold and died, and the other was only
highly commended, passed over in favour of two others of
my own birds incomparably inferior, and judged beaten by a
Blackcap, awarded ist prize, that had a bald patch on its head !
My two Chiffchaffs were in perfect feather and condition, and
considering that they are by no means easy to hand-rear and
keep, I was rather disgusted, and have never exhibited another
bird from that day to this.
Some years later, I again reared a nest of this species
quite successfully, but let them all fly early in the summer of
the following year. All, that is, save one beautiful little cock
bird, for which Dr. W. T. Greene kindly said he would find a
home, as he had never previously kept the Chiffchaff in
confinement. This bird, he wrote me, travelled well the long
journey, reaching him safely and none the worse. After a time,
however, it escaped either through an open door or window.
These birds are so small and active that they soon get out
of a very tiny hole, and it is necessary to have the cage rather
closely wired for them*. I have offered various fruits, but they
only occasionally eat anything but insects, which, I suppose,
form their sole natural diet. Flies they very much appreciate,
so we used to keep butterfly nets handy indoors, as a few
vigorous sweeps in the kitchen every day during the summer
months generally resulted in a good "catch," which the
Chiffchaffs appeared thoroughly to enjoy. Small moths, too,
were a luxury for them, and all spare insects from entomological
expeditions were divided among these birds and other " soft-
bills."
I ought to mention that I always kept my Chiffchaffs in a
warm room where a fire was burning during the winter, in fact
the cages were placed in whatever room we were using. I
stacked them one upon another each side of the window,
carefully excluding draughts, and, if very cold, moved them into
* Every autumn, many of these charming little birds on migration visit my aviary,

the centre of the room before going to bed, so that the birds got
the benefit of the fire during the night. I admit this is rather
a troublesome proceeding, but the result of having your
special pets always in the room with you is that they become
exceedingly tame.
I had a Wliitetliroat for nearly ten years, and she became
so tame that she would hop about on the hearthrug in front of a
blazing fire without betraying any signs of fear. My Chiffchaffs
would feed freely from our hands, and became quite pets.

Hypsipetes psaroides.
By Wesley T. Page, F.Z.S.
I had hoped to have been able to give a full account of
this interesting bird, which was kindly presented to me by my
esteemed friend, Mr. E. W. Harper--instead of which I have
a tragedy to record. The bird had been in my possession barely
three months when, owing to the garden gate being inadvertently
left open, a strange dog wandered in, forced in the front of my
aviary, and killed half my birds before it was observed, the
Bulbul among the number. Its body was much knocked about,
but I sent it to Messrs. Crockett, who have set it up for me and
have made a very fair specimen of it.
Mr. Harper, when I saw him just before his return to
India, informed me that it was popularly called the Goat Bird
on account of its call resembling the bleat of a kid. He also
considered (and I think very rightly) that its name of
Himalayan Black Bulbul was most inappropriate, for it is not
black at all. and that a more appropriate one would be the
Coral-billed Bulbul.
He also stated that when wild it lived very largely 011 the
pollen from flowers, but with the same it must also get a good
number of insects, and not small ones either I should say ; for
while in my possession it never touched any of its other food
till every mealworm was consumed.

Mr. Wesley T. Page,
It ranges over the whole of the Himalayas at from 3,000 to
4,000 feet, while many are also found at as great an altitude as
5,000 feet. It is gregarious, and is said to be very noisy in a
wild state (this is also true of it in the aviary).
Its plumage is roughly, top of head, upper neck, flights
and tail feathers, black ; the rest of the plumage being iron
grey, bill coral red, legs red.
Mr. R. Phillipps kindly copied out for me, from Jerdon's
" Birds of India," an account of this bird for comparison ; from
which I now quote the description of its plumage, which is very
true, save that the grey in my specimen was a little warmer in
tone than perhaps the following description conveys :--
" Head sub-crested, black; body and wings dark ashy or
iron grey ; tips of the quills and the tail black; beneath dull
grey, as above, the lower part of the abdomen and vent paler;
under tail - coverts edged white; bill bright red ; irides red-
brown ; length n inches."
To this I would simply add, quills very dark grey, almost
black, merging into intense black at the tips; vent, almost
white; and the bill I should describe as coral red.
It is said to have powers of mimicry. This I should
consider very probable, but I had it under my observation too
short a time to confirm this or otherwise ; it is a bird of strong
character, yet quite amiable, and can safely be kept even with
the smallest Waxbills, and may be kept out of doors all the year
round.
It is of very powerful flight, and flits from one perch or
branch to another like a flash of lightning, yet in quite a.
natural and unscared manner ; it is bold, yet apt to be wild in a
fair sized aviary; its movements very much resemble those of
our English Blackbird, but, as above indicated, it is even
more alert, and rapid in its flight.
Song it has none; its call from which it takes its popular
name is very realistic. Friends and neighbours unacquainted
with the fact that I had such a bird thought we had a goat, its
call was so real; to produce it the head is thrown back till it

almost touches its back, and the bill fully opened till the points
are nearly an inch apart, and so produced the call, usually
repeated several times in succession, and is exactly like the bleat
of a young goat ; my bird had no other, save a subdued
clucking sound, a sort of shrill whispered imitation of an
ordinary fowl.
It is not brightly coloured, yet is a handsome bird, of fine
contour, and of a good upstanding carriage: the black feathers
on the head being very fine and lustrous; each one stands
separately from the other and is finely formed ; these, when the
bird is at all excited, are erected in the form of a semi crest.
When I first received the bird it was in the thick of the
moult, and could scarcely fly from one end of the aviary to the
other, but it came through the same very rapidly, and was soon
in fine plumage and very strong on the wing. It was fed on
Arthur's Finch Mixture, mixed with double its bulk of mashed
potato or stale bread crumbs, plenty of fruit and mealworms,
being especially fond of orange, eating a good sized one each
day, though of course the fruit was varied, apple, banana, pear,
etc., being also given. It also paid short visits to the seed pans
and swallowed a little canary and millet whole ; it was very fond
of mealworms, and its companions had to be very sharp to
get any of them.
I believe Mr. Harper also presented one of these birds to
the Rev. C. Farrar ; and I venture to hope he will be more
fortunate with it than myself, and kindly supplement these
rough notes with a fuller account a little later.
It seems rather strange why some of these fairly common
(in their native wilds) birds are not more often imported. So
far as I can trace, last summer there were only three of these
birds in England, the two aforementioned and one at the Zoo.
I shall certainly avail myself of the first opportunity of
acquiring another specimen.

CAGE BIRDS IN SIERRA LEONE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976527" page_id="10284321"  page_num="Page 212" year="" vol="">
By Robin Kemp.
In March, 1902, the s.s. Fantee landed me at Freetown,
the capital of Sierra Leone, to proceed up country some 55 miles
to the small native town of Rotifunk, then the terminus of the
railway.
There I found quarters in a wooden bungalow, in a
compound containing orange, banana, lime, mangoe and other
trees, from which, as far as the eye could reach, stretched the
primeval bush, occasionally broken by rice-fields and with
numerous swamps in every hollow.
It was not long before I began to get acquainted with the
birds, and, so soon as the natives found a ready purchase for any
of the feathered tribe, they were not slow in trying to
supply me.
First of all a boy brought six or seven Tambourine Doves
(Tympanistria tympanistria ) which he had entrapped in a rice-
field, with all their flight feathers, and in most cases their tails
also, ruthlessly plucked out. Some of these had white breasts
and some grey breasts. But I had no cage to place them in to
prevent them wandering away, so I turned to and with some
empty gin cases and pieces of wire, and a few branches for
perches, managed to make them a couple of fairly roomy cages.
I placed them on the verandah and used to watch them and
wonder if the wliite-breasted ones were the same species as the
grey-breasted. I believe the grey breast is the first year's
plumage.* They were quite content with rice to eat as also was
the next live bird that was brought along, viz., a Collared
Pigeon (Turtur semitorquatus ). This was a handsome bird,,
though not to be compared with the Green Fruit Pigeon which I
obtained later. He was very wild at first, but settled down in a
week or two. Unfortunately he came to a very sad end.
About two months after obtaining him, I had to pass up-
country on one of my frequent journeys, and left him in the pink
of condition. On my return the following day the cage contained
only three or four bones and feathers. Ants had come, as they&apos;&apos;
More likely females.--E d.

frequently do, in their armies of countless thousands, had found
the poor bird, killed him and either eaten or carried away almost
the whole of him. My black boy said he was all right when he
went to sleep at night, but in the morning pigeon and ants had
disappeared, the latter leaving their unmistakable track behind.
Later on I made some experiments with live frogs to see how
quickly ants could dispose of them, and was astonished to see
how short a time they took; indeed there is a story in Sierra
Leone of a drunken man in a prison cell being killed and
disposed of by ants in one night.
However, the next pigeon which the natives brought
along was a most gorgeous one, a Green Fruit Pigeon ( Vinago
sharper). My boy told me he w&apos;ould only eat Christmas seed,
whatever that was, but when I instructed him to obtain some he
quickly informed me that he couldn't, as it wasn't the season.
So recourse was had to rice, but it was evident it was not
suitable, and by degrees this pigeon sickened and died, though I
obtained some Christmas seed towards the end. The natives
allege, and it appears to be a fact, that this Pigeon will never fly
to the ground, but will only w&apos;alk to it down a twig, and will
even break a twig on purpose rather than fly to the ground.
I had not been many hours at Rotifunk before finding the
various trees in the compound were the resort of many hundreds
of hard-billed birds. With a butterfly net and a lantern at night
time my black boy and I could easily catch two kinds of
finch, small and large respectively ( Spermestes cucullata and
Avianresthes fringilloides). At one time over thirty of these
birds in a large tin lined cage, which a short time before had
been the home of a young leopard, came in very handy as diet
for two Owls. We could also sometimes catch a Fire-finch
{ Lagonosticta. minima) in an orange tree and occasionally we got
a Lime-bird ( Silagra brachyptera). My boy became very clever
at using the butterfly net, and the resultant catches always were
put in cages to wait till such time as coloured drawings could be
made of them.
One day a native brought along a little wicker cage, and
great was my delight in seeing it contained a large fierce but very

pretty owl ( Syrnium nuchale). A bargain was soon struck, and the
owl with difficulty transferred to a larger cage. My boy said he
was so fierce because he was ashamed of having been caught,
and stated that such birds would pluck out persons' eyes.
After a w^eek or two in confinement he was much tamer,
and, cutting his wing, I let him wander about the bungalow,
when he soon became quite sociable and friendly. During the
day he would sit under the bed or on a dark shelf in the room,
and the night he generally spent in the pantry doing good
execution among the rats, of which we had many. After
having him thus for some three months, one night he wandered
away, and, though I sent the boys round to make diligent search,
all efforts to find him proved futile. A coloured drawing of this
owl pleased the black boys immensely.
Another owl which came about the same time into my
possession was a White or Barn Owl ( Strix flamniea&apos;), identically
the same species as the British Barn Owl. The frame of mind
of this bird was very different from that of the former owl,
being untamable and shy. Both these owls had to be fed
largely on the two kinds of birds mentioned previously.
Several live birds I also had in captivity for a short time
only. Among them were a beautiful little Falcon (. Elanus
caerulens), a Tree-duck {Dendrocyg)ia viduata), a young Tiger-
Bittern ( Tiorisoma leucolophnvi), two Kingfishers, two Sun-
birds or Banana-suckers, and a Moorhen. The last bird my boy
put into one of the cages, but, having misjudged his size, he
speedily escaped between the bars.
The nine months which it fell to my lot to spend at
Rotifunk were rich in interest in the way of birds, both alive and
dead. With what pleasure did I obtain the first Bee-eater,
which there abounds, and the pretty little Sun-birds. To
paddle down the Bumpe River in a dug-out canoe and observe
the Eagles, Herons, Ducks and smaller birds in their native
haunts I found a wonderful set-off against the insidiousness of
so tropical a climate.

THE MISUSE OF THE MEALWORM.

Sir,--M ay I be permitted to make a few remarks with regard to Mr.
Phillipps' note (p. 144) at the foot of my article on the Ruff, in which he
states: "Mr. G. C. Porter does not believe in the misuse of the mealworm,
which is just as he thinks fit, but his arguments to the contrary are not
convincing, etc."
About last Christmas time, I visited the London Zoological Gardens,
and curiously enough, noticing several of these birds had not yet shed all
their nuptial plumage, I sought the obliging keeper of the Western Aviary
and asked him how he accounted for it. He stated that it was a most
unusual occurrence, and in his opinion, the abnormal season we have just
experienced would amply account for it.
Now this was exactly my opinion, and I would humbly submit that
this retaining of the ruff is not caused by the food supply, as Mr. Phillipps
supposes, but by the weather. The Ruffs in this Western Aviary get very
few, if any mealworms, yet several of them have almost exactly the same

How does Mr. Phillipps account for this ?
My Reeves are perfect, and they have the same treatment as the Ruff,
so why should not the same management suit the Ruff equally well ? I
have had one Reeve for about two years, but only procured a Ruff and
another Reeve in May, when it was too late to think about breeding them.
Mr. Phillipps states that the Ruff is an unmitigated nuisance owing to
the way he constantly and unceasingly bullied other ground birds. My bird
seldom attacked any thing else, although kept with Laud and Water Rail,
Porphyrios, Quail, and other ground birds. .Sometimes in a scramble after
those unwholesome worms he will so far forget himself as to give a peck at
some bird who is appropriating more than his fair share. With the Reeves
it is different, he has to assert his authority over them with a firm hand.
The Ruffs at the Zoological Gardens very seldom attempt to molest
anything, and the keeper states that their pugnacity is very much over-
rated, so I think Mr. Phillipps' bird must be exceptionally quarrelsome.
To cut a few feathers from one wing is no hardship to the birds, and
although the) 7 can still fly, they do not injure themselves as they would do
if the wings were uncut. It is a question in our cat infested neighbourhood
of a clipped wing or a bleeding scalp, and, personally, I prefer the former.
I really cannot see that it would be any improvement to clip the tips of
both wings when one answers the purpose equally well and is quite in-
visible.
No doubt it is great presumption on my part to differ from so ex-
perienced an aviculturist as Mr. Phillipps, but I simply stated my experience.
G. C. Porter.
[Will Mr. Porter be so kind as to read his own Article and my Note a
little more closely. I may add, to make my meaning more clear, that I do
not suggest that it is not often necessary to cut the wings of a ground bird.
There are many advantages in shortening both wings evenly. Amongst
others, such a bird can still fly evenly, prettily, and happily, which the bird
with one wing cannot.
I do not know if the Ruffs at the Zoological Gardens are pinioned.
If they are (I do not say that they are), that will be sufficient to account for
their quietness and late moulting. As Mr. Porter's Ruff has had one wing
cut, and has been in his possession not longer than since last May, not even
passed a spring with him, he has not yet had time to observe the character
of the bird.
I am in great hopes that Mr. St. Quintin will shortly give us an
account of his Ruffs and Reeves, which " have never seen a mealworm . . .
the males go in and out of colour to the full extent, and at the proper
season."--R. P.]

Sir, -- P lease accept my best thanks for the interesting account of the
Estrilda. I wrote to.who says that I shall find what I want
in Lloyd Morgan&apos;s Animal Instinct . and he adds. ' Greenfinch egg hatched
under Canary built normal nest. Young Bullfinch taken very early did
same." So it seems to be true that they can build normal nests ? by
hereditary memory without parental instruction. Geo. Hexslow.
The account referred to was that of a young aviary bred Cordon
Bleu CEstrildaphcenicotis that built his first attempt&apos; a normal nest* in my
aviary notwithstanding that his parents had not done so, and have never
done so to this day. although nesting three or four times every summer.
A " popular " account of the rearing of this young Cordon will be found
at p. 141 of Vol. V., the nest being referred to in the last paragraph.
From Lloyd Morgan&apos;s Habit and Instinct, where the matter is thought-
fully and ably dealt with, we quote the following &lt;p. 235 et seq. : --
' Mr. Jenner Weir, writing to Darwin in 1S6S, says: "The more I
reflect on Mr. Wallace&apos;s theory, that birds learn to make their nests because
they have themselves been reared in one. the less inclined do I feel to agree
with him.It is usual with canary fanciers to take out the
nest constructed by the parent birds, and to place a felt nest in its place,
and when the young are hatched and old enough to be handled, to place a
second clean nest, also of felt, in the box, removing the other. This is
done to prevent acarL But I never knew that canaries so reared failed to
make a nest when the breeding time arrived. I have, on the other hand,
marvelled to see how like a wild bird's the nests are constructed. It is
customary to supply them with a small set of materials, such as moss and
hair. They use the moss for the foundation, and line with the finer
materials, just as a wild goldfinch would do, although, making it in a box,
the hair alone would be sufficient for the purpose. I feel convinced nest-
building is a true instinct."
This view of Mr. Jenner Weirs is based, it will be seen, on personal
observation which is well to the point. Here is another piece of direct
evi ience. Mr. John S. Budgett. a careful observer, placed in 1890 a green-
finch's egg under a canary, and this in due course was hatched, the young
bird proving to be a hen. In the following autumn he bought a caged bird.
* I have the definite statement in my Eird Journal that, on 13 Hay, " Young male
busy building with hay in poplar.&apos;&apos; and, on following days &amp;quot; Still building in poplar." --R.P.

acock, probably of the same year, and in the succeeding spring turned
them out into an aviary with furse and box hushes in it. Materials of
suitable kind were supplied--twigs, roots, dried grass, moss, feathers,
sheep's-wool, and horsehair. The hen soon began to build her nest, while
the cock did not seem to take the slightest interest in her proceedings,
Mr. Budgett never saw him with a twig in his mouth. In a few days she
had finished her nest, and Mr. Budgett having sought and found several
wild greenfinches' nests, made careful comparisons. Taking them as a
whole, he says, the aviary nest was like the wild ones in every particular,
made of wool, roots and moss, lined with horsehair. A second nest which
the aviary greenfinch built was also perfectly typical.
In the same year Mr. Budgett reared from a few weeks old a young
hen bullfinch, and kept it in a cage till the next spring, when be bought a
cock, probably an old bird, and turned them together into the aviary. The
hen soon began to build, and finished her nest in about four days ; but she
used neither roots nor twigs, of which there was a plentiful supply. The
nest was composed of nothing but dried grass, with a little wool and hair.
She laid therein five eggs, two of which hatched, but the little birds soon
died. She then began another nest, this time a typical bullfinch's nest of
fine twigs and roots lined with horsehair. Here five eggs were again laid,
all of which were hatched, and three reared. .She also built a third nest,
which was perfectly typical of her species.
Some birds build their nests true to type, without opportunities or
with but the slenderest opportunities of imitation or instruction. IL appears
to me that the evidence before us justifies the conclusion that nest-building
in definite ways is an instinctive activity ; but that it is modifiable by
individual experience. Whether the modifications are inherited we do
not know. It may be well to note how largely the performance of this
activity is due to internal impulse, the external stimulus being perhaps
afforded by the sight of the requisite materials.
Intelligence is so individual a faculty, enabling the organism to adjust
his life to his own special surroundings, that it is difficult to see how, out
of the somewhat divergent individualism to which intelligence tends, there
could come that stereotyped unifoimity which the nests of any given species
present. Imitation would no doubt tend to uniformity, but here, again, it
is difficult to see why a bird should imitate the nests of its own species,
and not the equally good or, perhaps, better nests of an allied species,'
I had not intended adding anything to the foregoing; but, since
writing, I have been recommended to read Mr. Charles Dixon's Birds&apos;
Nests; an Introduction to the Science of Caliolofiy, where the subject is
dealt with in the "Introduction." J am surprised and disappointed at the
views and conclusions I find expressed there, and desire to state most
emphatically that I do not agree with them.

Correspondence, Notes, etc.
I commenced birds'-nesting (under my father's guidance, who was
sportsman, field-naturalist, geologist and botanist) as soon as I could toddle
--more than half a century ago---and bird-keeping not much later ; and
there is hardly an inland British bird with whose nests and eggs and
general habits I am not intimately acquainted. And I have had in captivity,
in my dining-room, in birdrooms, and in the garden (an open garden,
covered over with wire-netting, kept as natural as possible, but with various
artificial shelters), a vast number of different species from practically everj r
clime ; and as I watch them and their ways day by day, year in and year
out, I find it impossible to help feeling absolutely certain that birds, how-
ever young and inexperienced, and with none of their own species about
them, have a strong natural inclination and impulse from within (call it
what you will) to court after the manner of their species and to construct
nests true to type ; and with me, in their first efforts, they have almost in-
variably built normal nests as soon as they have been loosed into the garden,
although not always previously. And I also almost invariably find that,
sooner or later (some species learn readily, but others are remarkably
tenacious and conservative, and extraordinarily slow to depart from the
ways of their ancestors), after having been exposed to, and had nests
ruined by, cold and wet, and having found out the advantages of shelters
and cosy rain-proof nest-boxes, they have discarded (I do not say lost for
they sometimes revert to them) their original modes of nesting, though not
of courting, and have adapted themselves to the circumstances of their
surroundings. A nest suitable for a hot climate, built in a position which
would be proper in a country where sun, not rain, is the order of the day,
is usually quite out of place in an exposed aviary in the United Kingdom,
especially when we take into consideration that many of the birds them-
selves are delicate and incapable of bearing cold and cold-wet.
More than five years ago, in a light and airy mood, and therefore all
the more valuable as being wholly unbiassed, I wrote Hozu the Birds learn ;
or. Nesting under Difficulties (Vol. III., p. 174), in which I gave the story of a
pair of Zebra Finches ( Tceniopygia castanotis), how they commenced by
building normal nests and ended by breeding in a sheltered box. One of the
curiosities of the story is that these birds commenced housekeeping in an
open, instead of in a domed nest after the manner of their kind as
previously exemplified in British aviaries and birdrooms. When I looked
over this account last night, I was much disturbed, for it seemed to be
opposed to my own opinions as expressed above. I forthwith consulted
Campbell's Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds , published in 1901, long after
I had written my little article, in which I find, at page 484, " They often
start laying as soon as the foundation of the nest is placed in position,
and keep on building and laying until both operations are finished ; " and,
"Mr. Wells found a Wedgebill's nest near our camp which had been appro-
priated by a pair of these Finches. It contained one egg when first

discovered, but before the clutch was completed the birds had finished
roofing it over."
It will be seen, therefore, that, even in this irregular peculiarity, the
Zebra Finches, the only specimens I had at that time, followed in the foot-
steps of their Australian forefathers.
I should add that birds which have been in the house for quite a long
time, and have nested and even reared young in artificial next-boxes, will,
when introduced into my natural garden aviary, proceed to build normal
nests in normal sites, and will not take advantage of the shelters and boxes
for nesting purposes until after they have undergone the uncomfortable
experiences of wind and rain already alluded to.
Reginald Phillipps.
Sir, -- I have already proved that both Canaries and Bengalese, when
turned into an aviary with growing shrubs, instinctively build nests of the
same type as those which their remote ancestors built ; although, for
centuries, these birds have been accustomed to build in boxes, in which
they had 110 weaving to do. In both of these cases no instruction was, or
could have been, given to the architects. Prof. Henslow will find these
facts recorded in the 'Zoologist' for July, 1902, p. 258.
A. G. Butler.
Sir, --In reply to Rev. Prof. Geo. Heuslow's interesting query under
this heading, I would like to quote several pages of Rev. J. G. Wood's
" Man and Beast," but it would take up too much of the Magazine's space.
I will therefore confine myself to quoting only a paragraph, as follows :
" Though the 3&apos;ouug pass their first few weeks inside the nest they
do not see the outside, neither can the) r possibly learn from their parents
where the materials were obtained and the mode of putting them together.
Each species moreover adheres to the habits of its kind, so that a Chaffinch
if bred in a Redstart's nest, would build the nest of a Chaffinch and not
that of a Redstart. There have been countless generations of Cuckoos,
but although every one of them was bred in the nest of a foster-parent not
of its own species, not one of them has learned to build a nest for itself,
but when it becomes a mother, is taught by instinct to lay its eggs in the
nest of some other bird.
" Take the case of insects. Instinct teaches the silkworm to make
its cocoon, to wait there until it is developed into a moth and then to force
its way into the world. It has never seen a cocoon before, so that it could
not learn by imitation. Its mother died long before it was hatched, so that
it would not learn by instruction. But taught by instinct it forms its
cocoon exactly as did its parents whom it never saw, and as will its offspring
whom it never will see."
As to facts--Canaries have been bred in cages for generations and

have been provided with artificial nests lined with linen and cotton wool to
nest in -- at least this is the way in this country, and my Canaries were born
in such breeding cages where they had no chance of building for themselves.
But as soon as I turned them loose in my birdroom, well furnished with
bundles of feathers and bushes, they have discarded every artificial structure
and have built nests of grass and hay, lined with feathers and cotton wool,
round open nests of the shape of that of the Chaffinch--Who has taught
them ? No doubt similar facts will occur to many. I have no doubt that
instinct teaches birds to built nests, while I am quite as sure that animals
also possess reason--and it is generally in cases when they act contrary to
instinct that their power of reasoning is shown. Many facts could be
brought to prove this, but I have already taken up too much of your
valuable space. Giueie Tommasi.
A CROSS BETWEEN A MANNIKIN AND A CAPE CANARY.
Dr. Greene sends the following letter from a correspondent.
Sir, --A few years ago I possessed a large Crystal Palace dome
shaped aviary, that could be divided into three partitions. At that time I
kept all kinds of Spice Island birds. Gradually they died off, some flew
away, some fought and were killed. I replaced them by Canaries ; of the
old lot only a pair of Mannikins and a pair of Cape Canaries remained ;
these were of a deep yellow, with deep orange tufts on their heads, hand-
some birds. The cock bullied the Canaries, so I put the pair into one of
the partitions, also the Mannikins, being quite inoffensive birds. As I
wished the Capes to pair, I put a nest in, and covered the partition with
paper, so that they might be undisturbed. A couple of eggs were laid and
two birds hatched. After a few days I looked at them and found one
killed, the other cast forth on the floor of the cage ; it was living, so I put
it under a Canary whose eggs were on the point of hatching. She and her
cock took to this foundling and went on feeding it, even after they had a
second brood, it was so backward and forlorn! For a long time it could
not fly, as it had a wing injured by its fall from the nest. I then put it
with the other Canaries, who also took pit}&apos; on it, and it always slept
between two, who seemed to guard and keep it warm. It was--in birds 1 --
the ugliest thing ever born. Imagine a Mannikin's head and beak, goggle
eyes--it looked like an Owl--a short body, one shoulder higher than the
other, the feathers and legs of a Greenfinch. It had no song, only an
occasional chirp ; it looked dull and seemed sorry for itself, otherwise it was
well and happy. I never saw it take a bath.
With great regret I had to part with my birds, as their seed brought
mice into the room, so I gave the poor little dwarf away ; it soon pined for
its companions and died.

WAX BILLS IN A CAGE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998320285714286" page_id="10284332"  page_num="Page 223" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have a large open cage, 29 x 16 x 30 inches, in which I am
keeping a pair of Silverbills, a pair of Cordon Blens, a pair of Avadavats,
and four other small foreigners. The cage stands in a window with an
eastern aspect, in a room which we nse only for taking our meals in, and
which is warmed with a thoroughly well ventilated gas fire which is turned
off directly each meal is over and only relighted shortly before the next.
We feed the birds on white millet, spray millet, and canary seed, with
a little fresh dried yolk of egg each morning, and give them plenty of
clean sand and a bath, of which they are very fond, most mornings while
we are having breakfast. During the winter we cover the cage with a light
muslin cover after our last meal, to afford protection to the birds from
draughts when the room is swept and ventilated in the mornings.
The birds appear generally health}-, but their plumage is far from
satisfactory. The hen Cordon Bleu has not a feather on her head and the
cock bird constantly picks her as they cuddle side by side, often giving her
skin a pinch that evidently hurts her: his plumage is perfect.
An Orange-cheeked Waxbill shows similar tendency, and its feathers
are rough, especially on the shoulders, and there is some bareness on the
neck.
Another bird, whose identity 1 cannot determine, never having seen
one like it before, has been in capital condition all last summer and
autumn until recently. Now its plumage has gone very rough, and it sits
most of its time lumpy and with its head "under its wing." I bought him
last June, out of a mixed lot from a dealer who did not know anything
about him, and he has been a strong vigorous bird, full of life and activity.
He resembles a Lavender Finch that has lived in the Black Country, and
got thoroughly smoked and grimed until the lavender has become a dirty
grey and the claret of the wings and tail a dull reddish brown. He was in
poor plumage and condition when I bought him, but soon improved and
became sleek and well feathered. Just now he looks about as bad as he did
at first. He has only one poor note of a guttural character, like the chirp
of a Sparrow.
I feel sure the cage and birds are quite clean and their condition is
not due to insects : there is no trace of irritation among them.
Can you help me to identify my bird, and advise me how I may
vary the treatment so as to improve the plumage ?
Chas. L. Rothera.
The folloTving reply has been sent to Mr. Rothera :
When Cordon Bleus or Orange-cheeked Waxbills are kept in cages
they almost invariably amuse themselves by plucking one another's heads
and necks : I do not believe there is any remedy but isolating the plucked
specimens until the feathers have grown again.

In the case of both forms of Amaduvade Waxbills, and frequently in
the case of Orange-cheeked Waxbills, this abominable propensity is
common even in good-sized aviaries, especially if several pairs of the same
species are kept together : it is the chief drawback to keeping these other-
wise charming little finches.
If your unidentified bird agrees in size, and the colour of its beak,
with the Lavender Finch, it can only be a melanistic example of that
species; but if it is larger, and has a greyish beak, it is probably the Black-
necked Waxbill ( Lagonosticta nigricollis) from the Niger: but this seems
unlikely.
When a Lavender Finch goes wrong, especially in a cage and after it
has been some months in captivity, it is generally suffering from pulmonary
disease, and is doomed : it is one of the most sensitive to cold of all the
Waxbills, and three years is the longest period for which I have been able
to keep it alive in my aviaries.

points :

1. --Would a pair of Zosterops live in safety in the same cage (a
large one) with a pair of Blossom-headed Parrakeets and a pair of Yellow
Budgerigars ?
2. --Could I put ui}' Zosterops in the garden aviary--say in May--and
would they winter out-of-doors ? My aviary has a closed in part, lighted
by a window access for the birds, the closed part being gained by a square
opening in the door. In the summer the door between the closed in and
open parts of the aviary is open night and day.
3. --My Blossom-lieads (young birds) seem to eat very little in pro-

The folloioing reply zcas sent to Mrs. Williams :
1.--The Zosterops would not be safe with the Parrakeets. The latter
differ greatly in disposition, but some of them, especially Budgerigars, are
spiteful, and nip and break the limbs of other birds.

THE BLUE-BEARDED JAY.
Cyanocorax cyanopogon.
By Arthur G. Butler, Pli.D.
Early in the year 1895 a fair number of specimens of this
beautiful Brazilian Jay came into the British Bird-market. Our
member, Mr. J. B. Housden, purchased, I think, seven
examples ; one of which came into my possession, and is still in
admirable health and spirits.
According to the late Dr. Carl Russ, this species is rare in
the German market, and is only imported singly; it was first
received in the Zoological Gardens of London and Amsterdam in
1864.
Burmeister tells us but little respecting the wild life of
the Blue-bearded Jay; he says it has the same habits as the
European species, feeding upon insects and seeds, more
particularly of forest trees. From what Mr. White says of the
allied Pileated Jay, it is probably more like our Magpie in its
inquisitive behaviour, and its liking for the vicinity of human
habitations.
I fancy that the English Jay would soon be in a bad way
if fed only upon insects and seeds; and the same may be safely
concluded in the case of Cyanocorax. The former, as we know,
feeds upon worms, spiders, insects, eggs and young of small
birds, probably mice and other small rodents, berries, acorns,
beech-mast, and nuts. I have 110 doubt that the species of
Cyanocorax do the same.
In captivity not only Jays, but all members of the family

Dr. Arthur G. Butler,
CotvidcE, are liable to receive more raw meat than is good for
them. When this is the case, the birds suffer from relaxed
bowels, cramp, fits, and a short life. I think it probable that
this was the reason, rather than their condition when received,
why four specimens of this vigorous bird which reached the
Calcutta gardens in November, 1888, "died within a month or
two of their arrival."
When "Jack," as I call my bird, came into my possession,
he was rough iu plumage, dirty in feather, with the underparts
stained of a buffish tint like the specimens seen iu collections of
skins. It is probable that this staining of the snow-white
feathers in cabinet specimens is acquired by the birds squatting
upon natural branches after washing; since it does not appear
in examples which moult in captivity, and are properly looked
after.
At first Jack was very wild and nervous ; and as I was, for
a time, obliged to keep him in far too small a cage, he was
somewhat offensive. Later, I wired iu the sides and end of a
narrow staging at the end of my conservator}&apos;, thus forming a
flight cage about five feet six inches in length, two feet in width,
and 31 inches high ; two perches cross this cage at a height of
about 20 inches from the ground ; one towards each end, so as
to allow of a short flight ; and two metal trays slide in from front
to back, one for sand, the other for shingle; upon the latter the
large water-pan is placed, and upon the sanded tray is his pot of
food.
The staple food provided for this and my English Jay
consists of crumb of stale household bread, powdered sweet
biscuit, yolk of egg, Abrahams' food for insectivorous birds, and
ants' eggs, thoroughly mixed together and slightly damped.
Once a week both birds receive a piece of raw beef, about a cubic
inch, cut up small. I11 addition I give all mice caught in the
traps*, young birds thrown out of nests or deserted eggs, of any
birds nesting in my aviaries ; cockroaches in plenty, an
occasional mealworm, spiders, rarely worms ; also fruit, left by
the other birds, grapes now and again, nuts, biscuit, or sponge
I have had none to catch for the last five months, so they have to do without them.

cake if handy. As Jays delight in washing, it is hardly
necessary to say that both birds are generally perfect in plumage,
and never know what it is to feel in the least degree unwell.
Although I only give dead mice to Jack, he once dropped
upon a stray youngster which was foolish enough to enter his
cage; and then I am sorry to say he displayed the cruelty
inherent in his savage nature; for, instead of killing the
unfortunate little beast with a blow on the skull, as some
sanguine students of Nature would like us to believe that all
predacious birds do, he simply held it between his feet, and
pulled off its limbs and swallowed them one at a time ; nor could
I get at him to interfere, so I had to console myself with the
hope that the victim's sufferings were not very acute ; they were
certainly soon over.
When a dead mouse is given, it is always held between
the feet, not grasped by the claws after the manner of a hawk.
Generally the abdomen is first attacked, the powerful bill being
brought down with unerring precision repeatedly upon one spot,
until the skin is pierced ; then the latter is torn laterally, the
entrails are dragged out, the liver is eaten, and after the whole of
the interior of the body is devoured, the skull is cleared of skin,
broken by blows of the bill and the brains cleaned out; the skin
is then dropped, the legs being picked out and eaten later ; it
seems strange therefore, unless it was for the cruel satisfaction of
hearing its victim squeak, that the legs of the living mouse
should be eaten first.
As I observed before, Jack was very wild when I received
him ; but gradually, as he got to know and value me, he became
exceedingly tame and confiding. O11 two occasions, when his
upper mandible has grown too long for his comfort, I have
simply called him, shown him a pair of steel nail-clippers, and
(probably pleased with the bright metal) he has put his bill
through the wire and allowed me to snip off the long point ; all
he did was to rub his bill once on the perch, and, remaining
close to me, put down his head to have his crest tickled.
Jack is very fond of being tickled by me, either in the
side, on the breast, or on the top of his head ; he also allows

me to take hold of his bill between my finger and thumb, though
he does not like his toes to be touched, but if anyone else
attempts to tickle him, he turns round and digs at the end of the
forefinger with all his might; and some visitors don't seem to
like this, though it really does not hurt much.
When Mr. Gronvold came over to make the drawings of
my Blue-bearded Jay to illustrate this article, he wondered how
he was to get into line with it, and get it steady enough for his
purpose ; but I assured him it would be quite easy. Having
seated the artist on a low stool in line with the outer perch, I
simply called "Jack," and the bird flew to me at once; then I
only had to tickle his side to keep him quiet as long as I pleased
(I don't think it was far short of an hour).
To get the bird in position for the smaller sketch is
equally easy; you only have to give him a seed of Indian maize,
and he places it between his feet and hammers away until he is
tired, lets it drop for a minute, then replaces it and goes on
again.
If I notice the other birds without stooping to pet Jack,
he comes to the front and utters his loud metallic barking notes
to call my attention to him ; then he bows over the perch
dancing, and crooning a ridiculous little song which sounds
most comical coming from so large a bird. A similar song
and a stamping dance are mentioned by Mrs. Olive Thorne
Miller in the interesting account of her pet Blue Jay, in her
delightful little book called " In Nesting Time."
As a pet, this bird could hardly be surpassed ; it is not only
confiding and interesting, but very beautiful ; its jet black,
snow-white, and greyish brown plumage; the laveuder-wliite
crestdike nape-plumes behind the true crest, the varied blue
patches on the face, and the brilliant golden yellow of its eyes,
produce altogether one of the most charming combinations to
be found in bird-life ; and when kept in a large cage in a
conservatory it is not offensive, provided that the remains of
dead mice are removed as soon as done with. The fact that I have
already had my bird for eight years, shows that it is not a short-
lived species.

This pair of doves came to me under this name, but I do
not know if it is the correct one or not. I believe they came
from the West Indies, and their worth is from 30/- to 35/- a pair.*
In shape, the Rufous is something like the Bleeding Heart, short
and sturdy, and with long legs. I have noticed both birds flirt
the tail up and down when alighting on a bough. In colouring,
the cock has a grey forehead, olive brown back, and vinous
breast, and has a general look of vinous colour all over him.
The hen is a larger bird, and quite different in colour. She is a
greyish brown, with beautiful metallic green reflections on the
neck, etc. I sometimes wonder if they are really the same kind
of dove or not. They take little notice of each other, but
to-day I saw the cock dressing the lien's feathers and trying to
rouse her. She has, I think, got a little cold, and I must put
them in a warmer place for the winter. Both the Rufous Doves
are great favourites of mine, and they have also the merit of
being very quiet, inoffensive birds.

I have had two pairs of these very lovely doves. Neither
of my first pair could fly, each having a rather drooping wing,
and one of them, after I had only had them a few mouths, broke
its leg and died. I got a third specimen, a magnificent bird, but
he would not take to the poor little survivor. This new bird
had been hand-reared by the natives. I wonder if it can be a
general rule that any bird, reared either by hand or in an aviary,
is finer than a wild specimen, merely because it has no lack of

know if they were of the same species.--It. A.

food or nourishment when young and growing? My two young
Bleeding Hearts, for instance, that I bred this year, were soon far
finer birds than either of their parents. None of my three wild-
caught Violet Doves can equal this hand-reared bird. I wrote to
the friend who had kindly supplied me with these doves to see if
he had still another. Fortunately he had just one. It was, he
said, healthy, but in terrible plumage, having only just been
received, and had been plucked on the voyage by some other-
bird. I said I would gladly have it, and so the dove was sent to
me. It was certainly almost featherless, and when I put my
hand in the hamper, it gave me quite a shock to feel only flesh,
and hardly any feathers. This same bird is now in perfect
plumage. I kept her to herself until she was in good con-
dition, and then put her in the same aviary as my hand-reared
bird. The poor fellow, who had been looking very lonely and
drooping for some months, took to his new companion at once.
They had several nests last season, but though the eggs were
fertile, and they sat well, I was not fortunate enough to rear any
young ones. I suppose a good pair of Violet Doves would be
worth at least 50/-, as they are very rare, and all I have known
were imported privately.
The colouring of this dove is very pretty. The back is
olive green, the breast creamy white, the front of the head
greyish, and the neck gorgeous with metallic colours, which look
most beautiful when the bird coos and bends his head to the
ground, as if he were making a most profound obeisance. There
is a patch on each side of the bird's breast of light maroon,
from which I suppose its name is derived. In shape the Violet
Dove is rather sturdy, with long legs. When once in condition
it always seems to look in good plumage, but it is very lightly
feathered, and the least touch seems to bring the feathers out.
Both my birds delight in cut up pea or "monkey" nuts, and
always look up for some when I go into the aviary.

brother from Africa, and the mate to it died on the voyage.
My friend had no aviary, and for some time she kept "Chib-
warra" in a cage. She told me he loved to be put where the
firelight fell on him, evidently thinking it was sunshine, and
would now and then make a curious whistling sound. But
after a few weeks the pigeon began to be ill, and my friend,
fearing he would die, asked me if I would take him to do what
I could for him. Poor "Chib" arrived one snowy day, and
I did my best to nurse him back to health, but he grew gradually
weaker. At last, in despair, I tried him with some of Mr. Dixon
Jenkinsou's pills, though in much doubt as to how they would
suit a Fruit Pigeon. They seemed to do the bird a great deal of
good, and had I given them earlier I think he might have got
better, but it was too late to save his life. "Chib" was a hand-
some bird, bright green in colour, with bright yellow 011 his
underparts and thighs. He had pale blue eyes, and very scarlet
legs and feet. The shoulders were washed with a purple
mantle. Half his beak was grey and the other half bright red.
" Chib" fed on boiled maize. He used to hop in a very curious
way, and though so handsome was rather a clumsy bird.
THE DAMARA TURTEE-DOVE.
Turtur damcirensis.
I have given what I conclude is the correct name for this
dove--as it agrees with the description given in the British
Museum Catalogue of Doves and Pigeons---but I cannot be sure
it is the right one. I had four of these birds sent me in a
consignment of doves from Africa. Three of them, I believe,
were cocks, the fourth a hen; but the sexes seem alike in
plumage. I have one pair left, and they are pretty gentle little
birds. In size about the same as a Senegal Dove, and in
colour soft shades of grey and white, with a black collar half way
round the back of the neck, and full dark eyes. The breast is
almost white and the back brownish grey, while the feet and legs
are crimson, as is the case with most other doves. In that
quaint and interesting old book, " The Dovecote and Aviary," by
the Rev. E. S. Dixon, there is a curious old Arab legend as to
the reason why the feet and legs of doves and pigeons are

almost invariably red or crimson. The story runs that the first
time the dove returned to the Ark it gave no indication as to the
state of the earth except by the olive branch in its beak. The
second time, however, that it returned, its feet were covered with
red mud, which proved that it had actually walked on earth that
was above the level of the waters. To record the event Noah
prayed that the feet of doves might ever after continue to be red,
and so from that day to this these birds have had red feet.
My pair of Damara Doves began to nest soon after they
came to me last March. The hen laid many eggs and sat well, but
always some accident occurred, either the eggs were broken or
tbe young birds came to grief. Once I reared the young ones
until they were out of the nest. They were exceedingly prett) 7 ,
such soft, gentle-looking little creatures, and much more graceful
than the generality of young doves. One poor little thing was
found pecked to death early one morning, the supposed culprit
being a bad-tempered Necklaced dove, who had a great dislike
to the young one's parents. The second young bird I also lost
shortly afterwards, but hope this year to be more successful.
THE DIAMOND DOVE.
Gcopelia cuneata.
This is a very tiny dove compared to those previously
described. It is a very graceful little bird with a long slender
tail. In colour ash grey with white spots dotted over the wings.
Some specimens I have seen had almost a brownish tinge, but
the ash grey colouring is much the prettier shade. The eyes,
and a patch of bare skin surrounding them, are red, which gives
just the touch of colour needed to complete the beauty of this
attractive little dove. I nave seen a pair of Diamond Doves
offered for sale at about 15/-, but this is an exceedingly low price,
and the usual one is from 21/- a pair and upwards. My pair of
Diamonds built many nests and raised my hopes time after time,
but alas! my nests were only for "squatting" in. The little
couple would sit on one of these structures for weeks at a time,
until I really began to think they must have some eggs, but each
time I was disappointed. The cock Diamond Dove looks very

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983946875" page_id="10284346"  page_num="Page 235" year="" vol="">
Chamoepelia passerina.
This is a pretty little short-tailed ground dove from the
West Indies, costing about 10/6 a pair. There has been so much
variety in the colouring of the different specimens I have had that
I find it rather difficult to describe the bird properly ; perhaps the
most commonly seen kind is of the shade of vinous pink, with
dark tips to the feathers, giving the bird a speckled look.
One Passerine I have just now (a cock) is of this shade, while the
hen has quite a brown colouring. One very handsome specimen
I once had was almost black. Of course the lighter the ground
colour of the bird the more distinctly the dark tips to the
feathers show. East year my Passerines made a very pretty
round nest of hay, on the top of a wooden bracket, and the hen
laid one egg. The Passerines were very important over it all,
and sat so well, that I quite hoped to rear a young one, as the
egg soon changed colour. The nest was in a very open
position, and thinking to screen it a little I fastened up a few
Scotch fir branches in front, though not in any way touching the
nest. I watched my opportunity and did this while the hen was
off, but to my disappointment she would not go back until I had
taken down the branches, when she returned at once. Just a day
or so before the egg was due to hatch, I saw to my sorrow the
cock sitting beside the hen in the nest. My hopes sank, for I
knew what it meant: he was eager to nest again and was trying to
persuade the hen to leave the one precious egg. He succeeded
in doing so, and in a few hours I had to admit the disappointing
fact that the nest was deserted. It was all the more trying as
the egg contained a very fine young bird just ready to hatch.

possessing any. Last March, however, three were sent me from
Africa in the consignment I have alluded to before. Two were
cocks, the third a hen, and all three are now in splendid health
and plumage. The Tambourine is a sturdy little dove. In colour
the male bird is dark chocolate with a pure white face and
breast, and on the wings are several dark spots. The hen
bird is rather lighter in colour, and the breast and face not
nearly so snowy, but much greyer. My Tambourines stay high
up in the branches in the shelter nearly all day, but seem to
come out at night and roost in the flight in some fir boughs ;
they are very peaceable little doves, and decidedly a nice
addition to an aviary. I have never seen any offered 011 sale,
so do not know their value, but they are probably worth a good
deal, as they only seem to be imported privately.
THE STEEL BARRED OR PICUI DOVE.
Columbula picui.
This little South American Dove is very pretty and dainty-
looking, though the colouring is very quiet. It is grey on the
back and head, shading into almost white on the face and breast,
and a steel blue bar runs across the wing, but as this band is
very dark, it does not do much to lighten up the colouring of the
bird. This dove seems to be very seldom imported, and is one of
those birds that one may have to wait for for months before one
can find an odd bird to make up a pair. I have now, after much
patient waiting, secured six specimens that I believe are three
true pairs. It has taken me some j^ears to do this, but my
original pair still flourish, and are the finest of the three.
Unfortunately the hens seem very delicate, and are much given
to laying soft-shelled eggs, though they have a good supply of
small grit and cuttle-fish bone in their aviary continually. This
dove is worth 20/- a pair.
THE CAPE OR HARLEQUIN DOVE.

very seldom, and is worth about 13/6 a pair. The cock
Harlequin has a black mask over his face and throat, and the
same shade appears in the wings and long tail and the bauds
across the rump. The remainder of the plumage is soft
brownish grey, and there are some white feathers in the tail.
The beak is orange at the tip, turning to dull crimson at the
basal half. The lieu Harlequin lacks the black mask, and is
much browner than the male bird. The flight is very graceful,
but weak, and the bird really looks not unlike a large
Swallow-tail butterfly when flying. I have never been successful
in breeding this dove, though my hens have laid eggs.
Unfortunately both my female birds are dead, one of them, poor
thing, coming to a very miserable end. The bird had a knack of
getting over on her back, and was then quite helpless and not
able to right herself. Many a time she had been rescued, but
one morning early she was found dead, having got over 011 her
back, and 110 one had been by to save her.
THE DECEPTIVE TURTLE-DOVE.
Turtur decipiens.
Besides the doves I have mentioned I have two other
kinds. One sent me by my friend from Africa, is a handsome
bird, and has been identified by the Museum authorities as
Turhir decipiens. I had four specimens, but two are
unfortunately dead. In colour this dove is brownish on the
back, lavender-grey on the head, shading into a beautiful pale
vinous colour on the breast, and a black collar edged with a very
narrow white line running round the back of the neck. The
eyes are pale yellow, surrounded by a bare patch of red skin.
Decipiens is a very attractive looking bird and is about the size
of a Barbary Dove. Both my specimens are unfortunately very
nervous birds.
This concludes the list of all the doves I have kept up to
the present. There have been some lovely varieties in the
market lately, beautiful Fruit Pigeons, Scaly, Geoffrey's, and
others. I have not been fortunate enough to possess any of
these, but I hope some of our members who have obtained them

This book is divided into two parts, the first dealing with
the Canary Islands, and the second with South Africa.
The Canaries are now so popular as a winter resort that a
book which deals with the natural history of the islands, and
with the customs and habits of its inhabitants should be
welcomed by many.
The author went first to Fuerteventura, a bare and
desolate island, rarely visited by Englishmen and sparely
inhabited. The birds here are few, Hoopoes, Coursers, Stone
Curlews, Shrikes, Ravens, and one or two others being more or
less common ; and the author managed to obtain some
excellent photos of most of the species which were breeding at
the time of his visit. It is no easy matter to conceal a camera
close to a nest on the bare plain, where there is absolutely no
cover, so successfully that the bird is not afraid to return to the
nest, but this the author succeeded in doing, as the admirable
photos reproduced in his book testify. Vilaptor, the highest
village in Teneriffe, is richer in bird-life; here Berthelot's Pipit
was abundant on the open ground, and the Blackcap and Canary
were common in the wooded parts. Berthelot's Pipit occurs in
all of the islands, but is particularly interesting, as being
confined to the Canarian Archipelago.
Many birds familiar to us at home are represented in
Teneriffe, such as the Blackbird, Chiffchaff, Black-cap, Green

Woodpecker, and Grey Wagtail. The Teneriffe Blue-tit is quite
as lively as his English cousin, but he was not sharp enough to
evade Mr. Harris' lens, and a beautiful portrait is the result.
The Teydean Chaffinch is peculiar to Teneriffe, and was met with
in the pine-forests on the higher slopes of the mountains, but it
is a late breeder, and the author was consequently too early to
obtain a photo of the nest.
I11 the second part of the book Mr. Harris takes his
readers to South Africa, where many birds and their nests were
successfully photographed. In the reeds that border the streams
Weaver-birds are exceedingly abundant, and the observations
on their nest-building will especially interest aviculturists.
The descriptions of the places visited and of the habits
and customs, both of the people and the birds, are written with
considerable literary skill, and the book, which is beautifully got
up and printed, is throughout very interesting, and especially
commends itself to those contemplating a visit to either the
Canaries or South Africa. We reproduce on the accompanying
plates a few of the photos from this book.

This volume is one of the " Open-air Studies " series
which is being brought out by Messrs. Charles Griffin. The
author is Mr. Charles Dixon, who is too well-known as an
ornithological writer to need any introduction to our members.
He informs us, in the Preface, that the present volume "has been
written with the express object of furnishing a popular intro-
duction to the study of ornithology by visits to British birds in
their homes," and after a perusal of the book we have come to
the conclusion that the author has very successfully achieved
his object. The arrangement followed is somewhat novel, the
book being divided into chapters dealing with the various
haunts of the birds ; thus one chapter deals with " The spacious
air," another with "Woodlands," a third with "The sands and

the strict order followed by the more purely scientific, and con-
sequently somewhat dry, arrangement of the majority of
works on British birds. But there is nothing in the least
unscientific in the book, in fact the author has in many cases
added particulars concerning the orders, families, etc., to which
the species belong. The book has been written by a most
careful observer and recorder of the wonders of bird life, and in
a stjde which commends itself especially to those who love the
woods and fields, who love to wander far from the madding
crowd and to be alone with nature.
We can strongly recommend the present work to those
who require an absolutely reliable, inexpensive, and very
interesting guide to the study of British birds.
There is a coloured frontispiece as well as several
beautiful process plates from drawings by Mr. Charles Whymper,
besides numerous cuts in the text.

ROSS'S SNOW GOOSE (CHEN ROSSI) BREEDING
IN CAPTIVITY.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997575625" page_id="10284353"  page_num="Page 240" year="" vol="">
In the current number of the Ibis Mr. F. E. Blaauw, C.M.Z.S.
gives a very interesting account of the breeding of a pair of these
rare Geese in his park atGooilust, Holland. In the year 1900 an
egg was laid by a solitary female of this species, and was exhibited
by Mr. Blaauw at a meeting of the British Ornithologists' Club
in March, 1901. A year later a second living specimen of the
bird was obtained, which fortunately proved to be a male. The
birds soon paired, and in May, 1902, the female made a nest
which consisted of a slight depression in the soil, lined with dry
grass and roots, under a bush in her enclosure. Five eggs
were laid, and incubation lasted only 21 daj^s, wdiereas the usual
period with Geese is about 2S days. Mr. Blaauw accounts for the
very short term of incubation by the fact of this species breeding
very far north, where the summers are short, and consequently
the birds have but a short period in which to complete the whole
process of propagation.

All five eggs hatched, and the chicks are described as " of
a yellowish grey, darker on the tipper side and lighter below, and
have, what makes them most conspicuously beautiful, bright
canary-yellow heads, with the most delicate greyish sheen over
them, caused by the extremity of the longer down-hairs being
of that colour. The bill is black with a flesh-coloured tip. A
little spot in front of each eye is also blackish. The legs are
olive-green." Curiously enough, this description applies to only
three of the chicks, as in the other two the part was white which
in the others was yellow. Unfortunately none of these chicks
was reared, one after the other getting something wrong
with its breathing organs, and the last dying a fortnight after
they were hatched.
Aviculturists will sympathise heartily with Mr. Blaauw
over his misfortune in the loss of this fine brood of exceedingly
rare birds, and will sincerely hope that better fortune may favour
him in the coming season.
THE GIZA ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.
Captain Stanley S. Flower, the director of the Zoological
Gardens at Giza, near Cairo, sends us the Report on that
institution for last year. The menagerie appears to be in a most
flourishing condition. The birds numbered 526 specimens, com-
prising 112 species, on October 6th last, and amongst other interest-
ing species are three specimens of the rare Whale-headed Stork,
Dalceniceps rex. Two specimens of this remarkable bird were
received alive by the London Zoological Society in April 1S60,
and there is one living specimen now at Khartoum, but these
and. the specimens now in the Giza Zoo are believed to be the
only examples ever kept in captivity. It is interesting to note
that a daily list of the wild birds observed in the gardens is
kept, and during last year the following species were noted :--
Blue-throated Warbler, Roller, Turtle Dove (71 auritus&apos;). Rock
Dove, Little &apos;Egret, Spoonbill, and Coot.

THE BEACK EMEU.
Dr. Graham Reushaw deserves the thanks of ornithologists
for the trouble he has taken to bring to light all that is known of
the long-since extinct Black Emeu of Kangaroo Island ; and
his article on this subject in the March number of the Zoologist
is of great interest. The Black Emeu (.Dromceus ater ) was a little
larger than a Bustard ; brownish black in colour, and with a
curious over-development of the plumage, "the elongated
feathers hanging loosely about it, as if too ample for the body
which they covered."
The history of the species is best told in Dr. Renshaw's
own words:--"In 1803 a French scientific expedition under
Captain Baudin landed on Kangaroo Island. Baudin himself
took a great interest in natural history, and had sent a rich
collection of specimens--both zoological and botanical--to the
Jardin des Plantes only a few years previously, On one
occasion he had the valuable assistance of Peron, the celebrated
zoologist, and it is to the work of this expedition that scientific
Europe is indebted for almost all its knowledge of the Black
Emeu. Kangaroo Island w r as uninhabited by man, but abounded
in the marsupials from which it took its name, and there were
also a great number of D. ater --' Casoars,' as the Frenchmen
called them. By a happy chance it was determined, if possible,
to bring away some of the pigmy Emeus alive; had it
not been for this haphazard resolution, the species we are
now considering would probably never have been known
at all to naturalists. Three birds were taken alive, and it speaks
well for the intelligent care taken of them during the voyage
home that they all arrived safely at Paris in 1804-5. One of
these Emeus was placed in the menagerie of the Jardin des
Plantes, where it continued to thrive for many years; the other
two, with a zebra, a monkey, and a large collection of plants,
were destined for the Empress Josephine. The Empress's
Emeus were sent to her residence of Ea Malmaison, and, at their
death, one of them--indeed, probably both--was placed in the
Jardin des Plantes Museum."

about the year 1822, which were examined by Dr. Datliam, who
called the species "Van Diemen's Cassowary."
That the species was perfectly capable of semi-domesti-
cation in Europe there can be little doubt, as one of the
specimens brought alive to France in 1804 lived in the
menagerie of thejardin des Plantes until 1822 ; this specimen was
well preserved and mounted when it died, and is still in excellent
preservation, as Dr. Renshaw's photograph shows, and probably
quite unique.
The species has long been absolutely extinct, a squatter
having settled on the island and barbarously exterminated both
the Kangaroos and Emeus.
THE HINDLE AVIARY, DARWEN.
The erection of aviaries, in public parks and recreation
grounds, in which can be kept the hardier British and foreign
birds, should be encouraged wherever possible, as they cer-
tainly form one of the best means of educating the public in
natural history. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity of
bringing to the notice of our Members the fine aviary, known as
the "Hindle" Aviary, in Bold Venture Park, Darweu. This
aviary was presented to the town in November, 1901, by Mr and
Mrs. F. G. Hindle, to commemorate their silver wedding. It is
50 feet long by 16 feet wide, divided into two parts, one of open
wire-work and the other glazed. The descriptive account of this
aviary and its inmates with which we are favoured is published
by Mr. J. J. Riley, of the News Office, Darwen, at the very low
price of one pennjo It contains a short account of each species
which is represented in the aviary, and photographic repro-
ductions of coloured figures of the birds which are fixed outside
the aviary to enable visitors easily to identify each bird. It
seems a pity that the scientific names should not be given in the
list, and that the word "variety" should be used instead of
" species," and we are sorry to find that the Passerine Parrakeet
is classed as a Lovebird, but these are minor details in a popular
descriptive catalogue. We can only say that Mr. Hindle's
generosity is worthy of the highest praise ; and it is sincerely to

be hoped that ere long well kept aviaries may be a feature of
many public parks and gardens.
The little monthly journal called Hints, the first number of which
came into existence in October last, contains, besides much useful informa-
tion on all manner of subjects, some we! 1 written and very interesting
articles on birds by Mr. Watldn Watkins.. Those entitled ' How to observe
birds,' 'How to attract birds,' and 'London Birds' are especially worth
reading. We understand that the paper can be obtained at any of the
bookstalls or from the Manager, 115, Chancery Lane, W. C. The price is
one penny, monthly.

NEW ZEALAND BIRDS; BRITISH BIRDS IN NEW
ZEALAND.
The following extract from a letter from a bird-dealer in
New Zealand (Christchurch) will be read by our Members with v
mixed feelings. It will be observed he regards the Canary as a
native bird.
" Am very pleased to hear from you again, although I
cannot do any business with you in New Zealand birds. For ten
years I made a trade of them--they used to be plentiful; but
now they are very scarce, so the Government has protected all
except two kinds.
New r Zealand birds are not good livers, only the paroquets
being seed eaters. The names of our native birds are as follows :
Tui, Bell-bird, Paroquet, Robin, Canary, and a few smaller sorts
purely insect eaters. Big birds : Kakapoo Parrot--cannot fly,
Kiwi, Maori Hens, Kaka Parrot, Bush-bird, Keas or sheep
killers, and native pigeons.
The paroquets were so plentiful they had to be shot off the
oat crops in hundreds. I have not had a Kiwi for two years, but
am told the dealers in the north get #7 each for them.
The English birds, which were liberated over twenty-five
years ago, have greatly increased. Next month (February) we
can catch fifteen dozen Goldfinches a day. One day last April I

Sir, --I bought a pair of health}' Blue-winged Love-birds about three
months ago. One went all bare on the head and has died, the other looks
as if it was going to start going bare 011 its head too. Is it a catching
disease ? because I wanted to turn it out into the aviary in a few weeks.
I have a Nightingale too that won't sing, I have had it since November; it
is healthy and in perfect feather. It has little tiny growths at the edge of
its beak where it opens, but they do not seem to affect it at all. It has all
the appearance of a cock bird, but never utters a note. Food : best ants'
eggs, hard-boiled egg, mealworms, Abrahams' and Century Food No. 1.
M. C. Hawke.
The following reply has been sent to the Ho 7 ible. M. C. Hawke:
It is possible that the birds may be victims to "surfeit" so-called,
which generally affects the feathers of the head. The cure for this is to add
five grains of Epsom salts and the same quantity of chlorate of potash to
the drinking-water for one day only, to give plenty of green food if the
birds will accept it, and to give the most simple seed-diet. I give two parts
white millet to one part of canary, and a few whole oats (I am not sure that
all examples eat the oats, but I have known them to be eaten).
Again, it is possible that parrot-lice may be the cause of the trouble,
but it is not probable, because these pests generally attack the butts of the
wings, back, and breast, but not the head. Spraying with quassia, or
repeated powdering with Keating's Insect-powder, are the best remedies.
I should say that your Nightingale is either rather backward, being a
young bird, or it is hand-reared, or it may be a hen. The food you give
could not be improved upon, and if the bird is a wild-caught cock-bird, I
should confidently look forward to its singing later.
Nightingales never quite lose; the so-called " waxy-skiu " or expanded
margins, towards the base of the cutting-edges of the mandibles, which
are characteristic of baby birds: possibly, therefore, the growths you speak
of may only be this natural expansion of the edges.

SEXUAL DIFFERENCES.
Sir, --Being asked recently, as I often have been before, how to dis-
tinguish the sex of the European Goldfinch, it occurred to me that I might
perhaps get hold of better characters than those usually given, by comparing
properly sexed examples and expanded wings of the same. Unfortunately
I only possess one hen in the skin, and this exhibits the remarkable
character of brown upper tail-coverts!
So remarkable a distinction from the colouring of the tail-coverts in
male Goldfinches determined me to examine the series of skins in the
British Museum. The following sexual differences are the result of my
comparison of skins and wings :--
The male varies in size more than the female, as I well knew; one of
my living examples being indistinguishable in size and colouring from
normal Siberian specimens, though I purchased it as a Greypate from a
bird-catcher, who netted it in Kent: at the same time the average cock
Goldfinch is distinctly larger than the average hen, and has decidedly
longer wings: the greater length being due chiefly to the better develop-
ment of the second, third, fourth, and fifth primaries (counting from the
front of the wing in the old style).
All the colours are brighter in the cock bird, the black of the wing
being distinctly deeper and more glossy; the yellow belt of a narcissus,
rather than primrose, colour. On the secondaries the 3 r ellow belt is broad
throughout ; it narrows somewhat on the inner secondaries, but it is not
clouded as in the hen. The upper tail coverts in the cock bird are
invariabl) T white, more or less washed with buffish-sienna; those of the
hen vary considerably; being, however, always distinctly browner than
those of the cock bird.
All the white portions of the plumage are purer in the cock, the
cheeks especially being much less stained with brownish : the blaze or mask
is of a brighter crimson in the cock, but its extent appears to differ very
slightly, and I think not constantly.
The form of the beak is very different; that of the male being much
wider at the base and tapering much less gradually than in the hen, though
slightly longer.
After examining the Goldfinches at the Museum, I thought it might
be useful to look at the various groups of Starlings, to see whether they
approached most nearly to the Thrushes or the Crows in their sexual
differences. I found that, in total length, and in the relative formation of
their bills, the sexes correspond with the Thrushes ; only these sexual
characteristics are far less marked, and in Spodiopsar they are barely
distinguishable ; a series of expanded wings would probably show more
marked differences.

Sir, --Will you please let me know liovv to feed the Purple-rumped
Sun-bird*, as I am thinking of purchasing one.
When I purchased my Green-billed Toucant I was informed that,
after death, the colour of the bill fades away. This, I think, must be wrong
as the one I had kept its colour.
C. CastpE-Spoane.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Castle-Sloane:
The staple food for a Sun-bird should, in my opinion, be honey,
which must be absolutely pure and extracted from the comb, because these
birds are very apt to make themselves sticky when given the comb,
especially when they first arrive, as they are then generally in a weak state.
With the two I had I always put in a pot of insectivorous food, but I do not
think they ever touched it. They were very fond of good grapes and small
flies and spiders, but I think the two last should be given with great
discretion, as they are very eager for them, and are inclined to eat more
than they can digest.
I consider them to be very delicate birds, and requiring to be kept
warm.
I should advise you to see them before buying, as, if you do not get a
tolerably healthy one to start with, there is very little chance of it,
surviving.

Sir, --A new bird we have is the little Australian Plumed Ground-
Dove, a cock. I would very much like to procure a hen, to try and breed
them; but I am afraid they seldom come into the market. Do } T ou think
any other kind of Ground-Dove would cross with him ?
M. F. Rathborne.
The following reply was sent to Mrs. Rathborne:
This little dove is so rare that I am afraid it would be rather difficult
to get it a mate of its own kind. The only dove available as a substitute
would seem to be either a Zebra or a Peaceful Dove, as these doves are
both the same size as the Plumed Ground-Dove, namely eight inches in
length. A Senegal Dove would be too large, and a Passerine or Picui too
small. As the Plumed Ground-Dove has been bred at the Zoological
Gardens some years ago, it might be worth while writing to the
Superintendent and asking if they have a hen to dispose of.

Doves are very strange-tempered birds. Your cock might take to
another dove of his own size, and on the other hand he might kill it, but
as these small doves seem to fraternize much better than the larger kinds,
when kept together; I think your idea would be worth a trial.
R. Anderson.
[.Lophophaps plumifera being strictly a ground species, never
perching on trees, and nesting on the ground like a Quail, there would seem
to be little or no chance of its breeding with any other species except the
other two belonging to its own genus, or perhaps with one of the species
belonging to the genus Geophaps, which are also ground nesters.--E d.]

NESTING OF GREENFINCHES AND ZEBRA FINCHES.

Sir, -- I have a fairly large outdoor aviary, about thirty feet long and
eight feet high.
Into this aviary I turned out about a month ago a pair of Green-
finches. The hen is a last year&apos;s bird, and has been in a cage since she was
a fledgling. The cock is probably a last year's bird ; I bought him out of a
little shop here. The lieu started building in a very old large-leaved ivy
growing up the house on 30th March, and laid her first egg on the 3rd of April,
then three others, and began sitting on the 7th--a lovely nest lined with
cotton wool and hair, and very cunningly concealed. As far as I could see,
the cock took no share whatever in the building. It is certainly wonderful
that a bird who has never been wild should build such a perfect nest.
I turned out a pair of Zebra Finches 011 April 4th, from a small cage
indoors. They commenced building in the ivy at once, and laid their first
egg on April 8. The nest was not then domed. On the 9th, however, there
was another egg, and the birds had nearly finished doming in the nest.
Both birds took a hand in the construction.
Could you kindly tell me how long incubation lasts for the Green-
finches and for the Zebra Finches ? There are about two dozen birds of all
kinds, principally British, in the aviary, but the Greenfinch does not seem
to mind them poking about the aviary in the ivy.
Could you tell me how I should feed the Greenfinches and Zebra
Finches, if they should hatch ?
W. Tweedie.
The jollozving reply was sent to Captain Tzveedie.
It is very interesting about the Greenfinch's nest. They are easily
bred. Feed much as you would a Canary, and especially supply plenty of
preserved yolk of egg. In my opinion, this is very much better than
ordinary boiled egg. They feed their young to a great extent on insects,
therefore something besides seeds is essential; and also green food of

some kind is very desirable. Wheat and other seeds grown in the aviary
give great satisfaction, the young shoots being pulled np by some species,
and the green tips nibbled by others.
And what will suit the Greenfinch will serve the Zebra Finch. I
never fed them specially. When birds are loose in the aviary, they manage
to pick up what they require, and give marvellously little trouble in warm
weather.
The ivy against the house is splendid for them ; but you will be wise
not to inspect the nests.
As far as I have been able to observe, young Zebra Finches come out
in about I2 |days, and Greenfinches in about 13 days; but I observe that
Dr. Butler, in Foreign Finches, states that the eggs of Zebra Finches
are hatched in about 11 days.

Sir,--I have some African Waxbills like the common Grey Waxbill,
but they have black bills instead of red, and dark-red tails; also bright
patches of red on their wings, something like the Auroras. They look so
pretty in the sun. They came with the Common Waxbills, Cordon Bleus,
and others, and had no red when I bought them a few mouths ago. Can
you tell me what they are ?
G. Tommasi Baedeeei.
The Jollowing reply has been sent to the Contessa Baldelli:
Your question respecting the new Waxbills is certainty puzzling: the
nearest species that I can find is the Crimson-rumped Waxbill ( Estrilda
rhodopyga) from Northern to Equatorial Africa : but the latter is said to
have the cutting-edges and base of the beak red, probably as in the
Lavender Finch*.
I see no reason why this species should not occasionally be brought
over with other Equatorial species; but, hitherto it has not, I think, been
recognized in the bird-market.

JAVA SPARROWS.
Sir,--I should be much obliged for advice about breeding and
rearing Java Sparrows in confinement. I have a pair which laid many

* In a letter since received the Contessa informs me that the cutting-edges of the

there are splotches of red on the wings.--A. G. B.

results than a small one; as the nest of a Java Sparrow is naturally large.
A shortish cigar-box (for 100 cigars) with about a third of the lid removed,
and the remainder tacked down, is the favourite receptacle : it should be
stood on end with the opening at the top, facing the front of the cage, and
hung up in one top corner.
I have never known Java Sparrows to eat their eggs; but my birds
have always had plenty of cuttle-fish bone and soft food to fall back upon.
I give, as seed-mixture, millet, canary, and whole oats.

THE NIGHTINGALE.
Sir, -- I shall be glad to know if an English Nightingale would live
in an open aviary all the year round, or would it have to be taken indoors
in the winter months ? Would it sing out of doors all the summer months?
Have any of your Members ever had any breed in an aviary ?
William B. Gibbins.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Gibbins:
The Nightingale will not live in an open aviary all the year round.
It seems to be quite unable to stand the cold and cold wet of an English
winter. It should be taken into the house for the winter. As far as my
experience goes, the male does not sing all through the summer when
out of doors. In my garden aviary it has sung brilliantly', but never
for more than a few weeks.
I have read of several cases of the Nightingale breeding in a garden
aviary, but have no personal knowledge of a case. It will become so
friendly that I see no reason why it should not breed*.
* Mr. Babb, the bird-dealer at the Crystal Palace, bred Nightingales some years ago.
If I remember rightly they were ftying freely in a room.--A. G. B.

BY H. HANEEY, SERGT.-MAJOR 1st LIFE GUARDS.
Being of opinion that any bird which breeds in this country in a wild
state might, by studying its habits, be brought to do so in a state of
captivitj - , I made preparations during the winter of 1844 for trying the
Nightingale, which I considered to be the most retired in its habits of any
of our summer visitants. I had a cage made, four feet long by three feet
high, the back, ends and top solid, with a wire front, in which I placed a small
Scotch fir-tree, planted in a flower-pot ; to each end of the cage I attached
a common-sized Canary's breeding-cage, communicating with the large
cage by a hole about four inches square. I broke a new birch-broom and
filled up the cages at each end, to make them resemble, as near as posible,
the bottom of a thick hedge, and then put in a plentiful supply of withered
oak-leaves and moss, of which the Nightingale forms its nest, covering the
fronts of the two small cages with green glazed calico. I placed the cages
high up against a wall facing a landing-window.
The following spring, that is, about the latter end of April, 1845, I
directed a bird-catcher (Blake, of Johu-street, Totteuham-court-road), who
goes to Watford every season to catch Nightingales, to bring a cock and
hen bird which had paired naturally; he did so, and, fortunately, they
meated off very readily. By " meatiug off," I mean that such birds as live
on insect food will not peck at dead food until taught to do so, which is
effected by enclosing meal-worms in a small glass tube, corked up at each
end, and then placing the tube in their food; on pecking at the worm the
beak slips off the glass amidst the food, which they swallow, and will
afterwards go to it without the aid of a tube. On finding my birds feed
freely in the small cage, in which until then I had confined them, I turned
them into the place I had fitted up for them, and was much gratified, about
a week afterwards, to observe the hen bird flying about with an oak-leaf in
her beak. She made her nest in one of the small cages at the end of the
large one, laid four eggs, of which she hatched and brought up three
young ones. During the time she was sitting, the cock sang as well and
as loud as I ever heard one in a wild state : when the young were excluded*
"Ejected" from the eggs.--R. P.

GREY SINGING-FINCHES BREEDING.

Sir, -- It may interest some of our members to know that I have
three young Grey Singing Finches in my out-door aviary. I have had the
old birds four years and had given up hoping they were a true pair. This
winter I left them out, in company with a Goldfinch, a hen Bullfinch, and
a hen Canary, and before Christmas I noticed the cock feeding the hen.
The nest is in a home made box of the "soap dish" pattern, into which I
pressed one of Reece's felt nests; this they lined with a little fine hay, and
the hen laid four eggs. Last Tuesday, April 7th, there were three tiny
black youngsters, and 011 Wednesday a fourth. One was thrown out of the
nest, the other three look fat and well fed ; there is no down on them.
The parents are very fierce, chasing the other birds directly they
move. I had to remove the Bullfinch. We-diad ten degrees of frost last
night, but the young took no harm. At nine o'clock the old birds, who
are very tame, flew towards me ready for breakfast, having eaten all the
egg flake and bread and milk. Both at once fed the young. The nest is near
the glass roof and not protected in any way.

FINCH.
Sir,--T here has lately come into my possession a small bird which I
cannot identify, and I should be very much obliged if you could tell me
what it is.
The bird is about the size of a Bullfinch, with a thick head, and
heavy bill. I11 colour it is all blue, or in parts blue black. The forehead,
cheeks, and a patch on each shoulder, are bright blue; the breast is dark
blue, and the back also (perhaps rather darker than the breast). The tail
and long wing-featliers are black or blue-black, a mark of the same deep
shade goes round the base of the beak, and from the beak to the eyes.
The legs are dark, the bill whitish but darker at the base; the e}'es are
very bold and dark. The bird had been two years in England when I
bought it, in a small cage, and had been fed on what looked like canary and
rape seed. It was said to sing very sweetly, but I have only had it a short
time, so cannot say how much of this statement is true. The bird was
brought by a sailor from India, and he called it an " Indian Satin
Starling," but there is not the slightest resemblance to a Starling in
" Billie." He is very fond of a mealworm, and does not swallow them, but

sucks the skin dry. "Billie" is always on the look-out for me, when I go
into the aviary, and I think will get very tame. The pale patches of blue
on him look as if they had been roughly daubed with a brush -- the blue is
not a green, but more a French blue shade.
Mr. Rothera may be interested to hear that the Lavender Finch I
bred, and for which I was awarded a medal by the Society two years ago (it
not having been bred in Britain before), has always been a veiy sooty
shade of grey, and does not seem as if it would ever be any lighter. The red
also seems darker. This little Lavender is, I think, a hen, and is a strong
bird. It has never ailed anything, until the last few weeks, but it seems
about right again now. For some time its head has been rather bare of
feathers. I have quite come to the conclusion that tiny birds suffer from
this in an aviary as well as in a cage, and that when a bird is once in such a
condition it is very doubtful if it is ever really well feathered again.
This Lavender Finch looks so dark by my three others as to seem
almost a different variety. .Some years ago I had a very dark adult hen,
but hardly so dark as the one I bred.
R. Anderson.
The following reply has been sent to Miss Alder son :
I think there can be no doubt that the bird brought by a sailor
" from India," is what the Zoological .Society's list calls the " Brazilian
Blue-Grosbeak " (Gniraca cyanea) ; and that the sailor, in the lax language of
his kind, said that it came from "The Indies," meaning perhaps Trinidad,
or even Venezuela!

I should think].

THE BLACK-HEADED SIBIA.
Malarias capistrata.
By Reginald Phillipps.
This interesting species has already been referred to in
our Magazine, at pages 76, 145, and 162 of Vol. VII., and at
page 244 of Vol. VIII.
It is an Indian bird, being found throughout the Himalayas
at an average altitude of some 7000 feet, and about Darjiling is
stated to be common. Jerdon tells us that " It frequents the
highest trees, climbing up the larger branches, and clinging
round and below the smaller branches, almost like a Wood-
pecker or Nuthatch."
As may be seen by a glance at our illustration, it is dis-
tinctly handsome; and in a good sized aviary it is showy and
attractive. Nevertheless the illustration does not do the species
justice, for Mr. Goodchild's portrait was taken in cold weather,
from the male when he was ill and lumpy and the plumage dirty
and dull. But if he had not been ill he would not have been in
a cage, and if he had not been in a cage he could not have been
painted. Herein lies one of the beauties of our coloured illus-
trations, and their superiority over most of those with which
we meet, that whereas the latter are usually taken from dried
shapeless skins, most of ours are original portraits and paintings
taken from the living bird, a most difficult and trying task. Of
course our picture of the Sibias was finished off later from the
birds as they were flying about in the aviary. When in good
condition, on a warm day , they are slimmer in appearance and

Mr. Reginald Phileipps,
brighter in colour. Moreover, when first received on 21 August,
1900, their tails were longer. This is one of several instances I
have noticed in which the plumage of some foreign birds moulted
in a cold aviary like mine suffers deterioration, either in length of
feather (notably in the tail with long-tailed species) or brilliancy
of colour. The crest of the male, too, was longer, being blown
about with every breath of wind like a little boy's hair.
The black of the head in my birds becomes very rusty long
before the moulting season comes round, but a marked access of
black and of general brilliancy, including a great fulness of the
black feathers of the head and crest, seems to come every spring
with the nesting season and warm weather. Sometimes the
latter have the appearance, especially in the male, of a great
black too-large wig put over the head, with excrescences (the
ear-coverts) sticking out from the sides of the head like the gills
of a fish out of water. During this season, when the two Sibias
are looking straight at me, the ridiculously huge wig of the male
has the appearance of being altogether considerably larger and
broader than that of the female.
I may add, on the authority of the British Museum Cata-
logue (VII. p. 404), " I11 N. W. India the birds are much paler
than Nepal or Bootan specimens, especially on the hinder neck,
and the ear-coverts are browner black than the head." . . .
" YoJing. Differs from the adult in being more dingy in colour
and in having the head less glossy black, the white bar on the
wing less distinct and washed with rufous, and the back rufous,
a little duller than the neck and rump, and not showing a distinct
mantle-patch as in the adults." As regards the latter, on looking
at my birds now (April, 1903), although the line is not sharply
drawn, the difference in colour between the chestnut red collar
(called " rufous" in the Museum catalogue) and ashy brown back
is very marked. The white alar bar, although sometimes con-
spicuous, at others is not even visible. The sexes are alike ;
nevertheless it is seldom that I cannot distinguish my male from
the female. During the first year the difference was usually
unmistakable, the male being the larger and thicker bird, and
the crest longer and more wavy; and he was much more bold
and enterprising. But, if the birds were dead, it would be

exceedingly difficult to distinguish the sexes from the skins,
although probably actual measurements of some of the bones
would reveal a difference.
During the summer of 1901, my Sibias commenced build-
ing in a lime tree and other places, but the presence of a pair of
Rufous-chinned Laughing-Thrushes (Trochalopterum rufigulare)
and a pair of Bulbuls prevented them from settling down.
During the following summer, they were most anxious to nest,
and I gave them the opportunity ; but immediately they found
themselves in my nesting aviary without any of their enemies,
they set to work to "clear the deck"--to kill off my little
Finches--so I was obliged to bring them back into the general
aviary ; thus they have lost their chance, for I have no other
nesting place, and cannot sacrifice all the little birds for them.
When put up for nesting, I observed a great change come over
them ; from the bold and forward favourites on the look out for
a mealworm, they became the shy and retiring bird of the
forest, sneaking about the thickest of the foliage, inspecting
every possible nesting site, and but rarely to be seen in the open.
Of the nest Jerdon can tell us only : " Hutton procured the nest
at Mussooree, made of coarse grass, moss, wool, and roots; and
the one egg he got was pale bluish-white with rufous freckles."
Concerning the food of this species, Jerdon says :--" It is
very fond of concealing itself in the thick masses of Epiphytic
plants found on all lofty trees in Sikhim, and its favourite food is
the fruit of the Epiphytic andromedse so abundant about Darjee-
ling; it occasionally, however, picks insects from moss, or
crevices of the bark." Here Jerdon misses a very marked
characteristic of the species, that of incessantly hawking after
insects on the wing. No fly or gnat so tiny but a Sibia darts into
the air after it; and so sure of aim are they that I may say they
never miss an insect that comes fairly into the aviary. On a
warm day, especially towards evening, they are never at rest,
but are ceaselessly darting into the air after their prey. During
the summer, they seem to live solely on fruit and the insects
they catch for themselves. The fruit they like best in captivity
seems to be the grape cut up into small pieces, but they also
partake of ripe pears, oranges, garden currants, &amp;c. When

devouring a portion of grape, they hold it in one foot, peck or
rather suck at it, and finally devour it. With many fruits, they
suck up the juice ; with the mandibles but very slightly parted,
with the assistance of the tongue, they literally suck it up.
Concerning the tongue, Jerdon says of the genus:--"The form
of the birds of this genus is slender, and the bill is more
lengthened and attenuated than in most of the members of this
family. The tongue, moreover, is forked and slightly brushed,
somewhat as in Phyllornis " (Green-Bulbuls).
They are nearly as late going to roost as the Tui of New
Zealand, like that bird sitting up for the purpose of catching the
evening moths.
The Sibias are exceedingly fond of mealworms ; and it is
difficult to keep the mealworms from them. If I omit to shut
the door of the bird pantry every time I go in or out, they slip
in in a moment, in the hopes of finding an uncovered mealworm
dish. If I toss a mealworm to some other bird, like a flash they
catch it in the air, and bear it away in triumph. Like the pro-
verbial stern parent, I endeavour to steel my heart and refuse to
give them the coveted tit-bit, but they come to either side of me,
like a couple of spoilt children, and looking up into my face
with bewitching appeals ask for just one, only one, and too often
they get it. It is an exceedingly pretty sight to observe the
cleverness with which they catch a mealworm in the air, and I
could sit and watch them by the hour. But mealworms give the
male fits, and more than once I have nearly lost him. This is a
great misfortune, for otherwise the Sibia is fairly hardy; but
experience has taught me that it cannot be fed too plainly.
One instance of the male's illness--the last to date but I
dare not boast--is too remarkable to be passed over unnoticed.
O11 the morning of 16 December, 1901, I found him on the floor
almost lifeless and with eyes closed, but conscious. He had had
a fit during the night, and had fallen like a stone from his high
perch. I laid him in a tiny basket by the fire, but neither
medicine nor even brandy revived him. After some hours he
was able to suck a little milk (with fluid magnesia and bromide
of potassium in it) from a paint-brush held to the tip of his

beak. For the next four days, he was able to sit up, but was too
weak to do more ; on the 21st he was really better, but still took
no food but milk, sucking it up from a dish in the manner
referred to. On the 22nd and 23rd he "nibbled" at a cut-up
grape, and on the 25th ate some tiny cockroaches, but up to
about the end of the month he practically lived upon milk. In
my opinion he could not have been saved if it had not been for
his ability to suck up fluids. He was not loosed into the aviary
until the 2nd January, but even then was still weak and tottering.
During the later days of his incarceration (in a small cage in the
dining-room) he would often utter a modification of his si-si
call, to which the female in the birdroom would immediately
respond with a loud clattering cry.
A marvellous feature in the economy of the Sibia is the
pursuit of the female by the male. It would be folly to suppose
that the like does not obtain in any other species, but I can say
that I am not myself acquainted with any other in which it is
even approached. The only parallel that I have myself ever
witnessed or heard of is to be found in our common English
Squirrel. The love pursuit of a pair of wild Squirrels, if once
beheld, can never be forgotten. Up one tree, from bottom to
top, and down another, through a plantation and back again,
surging backwards and forwards as if possessed by demons in-
numerable, no words that I can pen can afford even the faintest
conception of this wondrous sight. In captivity, if I mistake
not, the Squirrel has never bred :--may it not be because in a
confined space it cannot perform its wonderful love-race? How
it may be with the Sibia in the limitless forests of the Himalayas,
I know not, but within the straitened borders of my aviary it is
almost an agonizing sight; for as one watches their mad reckless
flight, high and low, round and round, in and out, rushing and
smashing, dodging and doubling, through bushes and trees, in hole
and corner, one expects every moment that pursuer or pursued
will be dashed to atoms or fatally impaled. Finally, the female
usually darts into some box or barrel, followed by her mate.
The Sibia has many call and other notes, an unusual
variety I think, especially if temporarily separated, for my two
are close friends, and are practically always together. Mr. Frank

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
Finn says (VII., p. 145) " Sibya is the name given to the bird by
the Nepalese, who know it as a native." But why ? Probably, I
think, because the song of the bird, which, at some seasons of
the year, is frequently repeated, may without much imagination
be reduced to writing as follows : Si-si-si-si-si-bia ! this is some-
what of the same character as that of our Yellow Bunting ; it is
pitched on a high note, the emphasis on the final si, the number
of which is usually four or five, with the bia a falling slur, the
vowels as in Italian.
The si-si song degenerates somewhat as the summer passes,
and stops towards autumn, and is succeeded by a Chaffinch-like
song. *
Another common note, sometimes used as asong,is chisick,
repeated quickly from three to eight times ; it is pronounced like
" Chiswick," the well known place 011 the Thames. Occasionally
this note is used as an alarm call (not quite the same as the cat
call), but then the " chisick " as a distinctive word is lost, owing
to the rapidity with which the "chisicks" follow and run into
one another. This " chisick " call forms the foundation of many
of the other calls and notes.
Another call may best be simply described as squeak, re-
peated usually four times.
They have a low ventriloquial danger call-whisper, a little
quavering squeak on a low note, exceedingly deceptive as to spot
and distance where uttered ; doubtless it would be used should
any one approach young or nest. When suddenly disturbed, it
* This season, so far, the si-si song has not been uttered either so
frequently or so fully as in former years; and on April 25 I heard the
Chaffinch song three times. Moreover, now they seem&apos;to have started a
new song which, since the warm weather commenced (I had not noticed it
before), appears to have superseded the si-si song. The song proper is
che-00 (the "ch" as in "chief") repeated quickly four times, but it is
ushered in with a sort of gurgling creaking (like some of the Weavers)
which is half stifled and difficult to get out (like the "song" of the Black
Cassique; see Vol. VI., p. 24), the four che-oos being the Lilliputian result of
a great labour. It is frequently uttered, and without the slightest variation.
Can it be a natural song? or is it a 'makeup' from the babel of voices
that now fills the aviary ?--R.P., May 2.

flies away with a tsit, doubtless the note it would use if driven
from its nest. Again, when one has some mealworms in one's
hand, it comes up to one with the most imploring whispered
tsit that can be imagined.
Towards roosting time, at the sight of a cat, they or one of
them will call out loudly as our Blackbird does at sight of Owl,
or prowling cat or fox. Although often disregarding nocturnal
foes during the day, many species towards nightfall become
exceedingly alarmed, for instinctively they feel that in but a very
short time they will be entirely at their mercy. This evening
alarm call, a kind of chickwp , repeated very rapidly and sharply,
rarely uttered during the day, is not identical with that of the
Blackbird, but is of the same character.
I11 addition to the foregoing, the Sibias have many rippling
and si-si notes, especially on a bright warm day in the early
summer, though many are only whispered between themselves.
It is in dull cold weather that they are thick ; in warm sunny
weather they are sleek and slim, fully alive and ever on the
move, and rarely silent though not noisy. A single Sibia may
be uninteresting, but a pair in a roomy garden aviary are
exceptionally attractive.
My two Sibias are so fond of one another that one feels
inclined to think that birds of this species must pair for life.
It is unnecessary to add that they always squat together when at
roost, the hind parts of the bodies pressing together, as they sit
side by side, with the foreparts pointing right and left, at an angle
of some forty-five degrees or more. They sleep in high sheltered
spots, but never in any hole or box.
As I have pointed out, the Sibia is not a delicate species;
and it would make a charming addition to the wild birds of this
country could it but be acclimatised. East summer, eleven
examples were loosed in England (I think in Surrey or Sussex,
but am not sure) by Mr. E. W. Harper, of which one was shot,
and another drowned ; of the fate of the others I have no
knowledge. In my own opinion, they could not live through
our cold damp winters and springs, even if they could find a
sufficiency of food. My own birds have a keen appreciation of

the value of fresh air and cold water ; but they do not see any

of their own accord to the snug shelter of the birdrooin, where,
with an abundance and considerable variety of food close at hand,
they can ride out the roughest gale in comfort and safety.

By E. W. Harper, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.,
Member of the Bombay Natural History Society.
Probably very few members of the Avicultural Society
have ever indulged in the sport of bird-catcliing; except, per-
haps, in the days of their childhood, by means of the old-
fashioned brick-trap, or a sieve supported upon one side by a stick.
But I can assure them that, to anyone who is keenly interested
in birds, the art is intensely interesting; and, what is more
satisfactory still, there is generally something to show for one's
trouble. Besides, one is able to study the habits of our feathered
friends in their natural haunts, which, to an aviculturist, is both
instructive and useful. And, I may add, a certain amount of
knowledge of the habits of birds is necessary to obtain success
in the pursuit of bird-catching.
Speaking generally, the English bird-catcher has little to
learn from his Indian confrere: clap-nets, trap-cages and bird-
lime being the means chiefly adopted both in England and India.
But, as I shall endeavour to show later on, the great variety of
birds in the latter country, with their different habits, often
necessitates special methods of capture.
Clap-nets in India consist of two nets, each about ten
yards long and four yards broad. These are placed upon the
ground, parallel to each other, four or five yards apart; the ends
of the nets being fastened together. One side of each net is
pegged to the ground, the other side having a string running
along it. When the string is pulled, it causes the side of each
net through which the string runs to rise, so that both nets meet
overhead, each net having a stick stretched across it at both

ends, to keep it in position. Looking at the closed nets, after
the string has been pulled, they form with the surface of the
ground an equilateral triangle--in other words, they resemble
the gable of the roof of a house. Naturally, the birds which are
caught in clap-nets are those whose custom it is to feed upon the
ground. These include Crows, Larks, Starlings, Wagtails,
certain Babblers, Doves, Finches, etc. Food is sprinkled between
the nets as they lie open upon the ground, several birds being
generally caught at once. The bait may consist of seed, grain,
boiled rice, maggots, etc., according to the kind of bird it is
desired to catch. The maggots used are the larvae of the
common fly, bred in a mixture of cow dung and blood, and
afterwards cleansed by being shaken up with dry earth. After
this process, the maggots are perfectly sweet and wholesome, and
quite free from any unpleasant odour. Shamalis, some Drougos,
and Rollers are sometimes caught in nets ; but more frequently
by a special method with bird-lime, to be described later on.
For Kites, a piece of raw meat is placed upon the ground between
the nets, upon which the bird swoops. Tommy Atkins occa-
sionally amuses himself, in a simple way, by catching Kites. He
takes a piece of raw meat, and, having tied it in the centre of his
blanket, stretches the latter upon the ground in an open space.
Kites in India being more numerous than Blackbirds in Eng-
land, Tommy Atkins has not long to wait before down swoops
a Kite in a graceful curve, to clutch the meat in its talons.
Its claws having become caught in the blanket, the unhappy
Kite finds itself temporarily a prisoner, the artful soldier
immediately rushing up to secure it. A Kite is a more unerring
catch in mid air, than the cleverest point" who ever stood
upon a cricket field. Frequently have I tossed a dead rat into
the air. when a Kite has been wheeling about overhead. Quick
as lightning has the bird turned, swooped, and caught the
descending rat in its talons, before the latter had time to fall
to the earth.
Those Kingfishers which are partially land-feeders are
captured by means of a very fine net stretched upright between
two sticks. The net is very loosely hung in folds, and the bait --
generally a lizard--is placed near it upon the ground. Upon

Mr. E. W. Harper,
seeing the bait, the bird dashes into the net, which is almost
invisible, becoming entangled in its folds.
Quail-catching in India is an industry of considerable
importance, many thousands being sent to the Calcutta market
alone, every year. The two men in the photo, at the bottom of
the plate are professional Quail-catchers, whom I caused to be
recently photographed at Lucknow. Each of the twenty-four
cages depicted in the photo, contains a single call Quail, which
has been caged some time. Just prior to its service as a call-
bird being requisitioned, the cage of each Quail js carefully
wrapped in a cotton cloth ; for, by this means, it is supposed to
call more loudly. A Quail net measures about five vards broad
and about fifteen yards long. It is spread in a concave shape,
one side being supported by upright bamboos, or sometimes by
bushes. The other side of the net hangs loosely upon the
ground. Towards dusk, in the evening, the cages, all tied
together, are suspended about six feet above the ground, from a
stout upright bamboo, stuck in the ground immediately in front
of the net. Very early in the morning, shortly before dawn,
three or four beaters commence operations some few hundred
yards in front of the net, towards the mouth of which the
Quails are gradually driven. The call-birds meanwhile un-
consciously allure their unhappy fellows to captivity. Once
having struck against the net, the Quails are afraid to run back,
because of the near approach of the beaters, who, coming up
behind the fluttering birds, secure them in their vain endeavours
to penetrate the net. The greatest care is taken of the call
Quails, they being of quite as much importance to the catcher
as the milkman's cow, the coster's donkey, and the keeper's dog
are to their respective owners. The call-birds' diet is a very
simple one: it consists of seed and water, the nourishing pro-
perties of the former being enhanced by the addition of a small
quantity of butter, which is rubbed into the seed with the hands.
I recommend this process of administering a powerful fattener
to the attention of those who keep Pigeons, Doves, Quails, and
other grain-eating birds.
Waterfowl are largely caught by driving them at night
along the surface of the water, upon which they are reclining,

into a net, lighted torches being used for the purpose. Another
method, displaying considerable ingenuity on the part of the
duck-catcher, is as follows. A man goes into the water where
the ducks are, his whole body being immersed except his head ;
this is inserted within a globular earthen jar, such as is com-
monly used for carrying water in. Peep-holes in the side of the
jar enable the wearer of this extraordinary head-gear to see
where he is going. Having approached his quarry, the duck-
catcher quietly takes hold of the legs of a duck from below ;
and before the owner of the legs has time to cry " Quack ! " it is
quickly drawn under water. Here, transferred to a bag, or
fastened to its captor's waist, the unfortunate duck soon drowns.
For a few days previous to his sallying forth amongst the ducks,
the catcher floats several empty jars--such as he intends to wear
over his head--upon the lake where the ducks congregate. As
soon as they have become accustomed to the floating jars, the
catcher dons one, and enters the water.
The trap-cages used in India much resemble those em-
ployed in England. Tike the majority of Indian bird-cages,
they are made of thin strips of cane, or bamboo, tied together
with twine; perforated cross-bars of the same material tend to
add strength to the structure. The trap portion is sometimes at
the side of the apartment occupied by the call-bird ; sometimes
above it; and often both positions exist in the same cage. The
door is held open by a twig, which, being liberated by the
entrance of a bird, causes the door to close, by means of a strip
of cane and a piece of twisted twine, which together act as a
spring. The trap-cage is particularly useful when it is desired to
catch small birds which congregate in parties or flocks. The
calling of one bird is sufficient to attract the whole lot, chiefly
owing to their inquisitiveness and extreme sociability.
I shall now pass on to consider the remaining agent
ordinarily employed in bird-catcliing, namely, bird-lime. As
prepared in India, it is a mixture of three ingredients: a milky
exudation obtained by striking the bark of the peepul tree with
a stone ; expressed oil of mustard-seed ; and a resin of arboreal
origin. These three things are melted together in a vessel over
a fire, and heated until the required consistence is attained. For

Mr. E. W. Harper,
removing bird-lime from the feathers of captured birds, all that
is necessary is to rub them with dry ashes. Bird-lime is used in
India in two different senses, which I shall term "passive" and
" active." In the former, limed twigs are placed in convenient
positions for the capture of the bird -- either by its feet or by its
wings -- when it comes in contact with them. In the latter sense,
the bird-catcher literally hunts his prey, "stabbing" it with a
long rod, which is limed at its extremity. The "passive" sense
I will deal with first : it is the only one adopted in England.
There, the common method is to place limed twigs just above a
cage containing a call-bird, the catcher waiting near in a con-
cealed position, ready to remove the bird the moment it is stuck
to the twigs. In India, however, many other ways exist of using
bird-lime in a "passive" sense. Fruit-suckers ( Chloropsis ) are
caught by tying one of these birds to a horizontal rod, the end
of which has been coated with bird-lime, the rod being then
placed near a tree frequented by these birds. Xo sooner does
the wild bird see one of its own kind sitting on the rod than its
pugilistic qualities cause it to descend, for the purpose of
engaging in a combat -- which, of course, never comes off. In
order to make the tame bird sit still upon its perch, it is tem-
porarily blind-folded, by having its eyelids sewn together.
Perhaps the most efficacious method of all contrivances
for using bird-lime in a "passive" sense is the one in which
two thiu limed twigs are crossed in the middle at right angles,
the ends being then stuck into the ground. This forms a
structure resembling the double hoops used at croquet, but only
about a fourth the height. From the centre of the hoops a live
grasshopper is suspended by a fine thread. All insectivorous
birds which dart down upon their prey from a prominent position
(generally returning to their perch to devour it) may be readily
caught in this way. Drongos, Rollers, Sliamahs, Shrikes, etc.,
are among the usual captives of this device, the outstretched
wings of the bird becoming glued to the limed hoops.
Kites, Crows, and sometimes Hawks, are caught by tying
a piece of meat or a small bird in the middle of a stick, which
has been previously coated with bird-lime, and placed upon the
ground. A Kite, or a Hawk, grasping the bait in its talons.

attempts to fly off with it, when its extended wings become
stuck fast to the stick. A Crow alights upon the stick, and is
held by its feet. The most usual methods of catching Hawks is
by having as a bait a live pigeon, secured by a string. The
catcher erects a hut or a screen of grasses on a plain frequented
by Hawks, and secrets himself within. A Hawk, upon seeing
the pigeon, darts down upon it, when the man gradually draws
the captive pigeon, and the Hawk too, within reach of his hands.
The hungry Hawk thinks that the pigeon is escaping, and so,
utterly regardless of its own safety, clutches on more fiercely,
and allows itself to be captured. To keep the pigeon from
fluttering at the sight of the Hawk, the poor bird is often blind-
folded in the same manner as the Fruit-sucker, already described.
The most simple way I know of catching Crows is often resorted
to by natives. It consists in taking a live Crow, and placing it
upon its back on the ground, with extended wings; these are
kept in position by being tied to two pegs, driven in the ground.
The Crow's friends believe in " hitting a man when he is down " :
no sooner do they see him lying in a state of helplessness than
they come to bully, tease, and trample on him. But the help-
lessness of the captive Crow does not extend to his feet, for in a
vice-like grip of his claws, he clutches his tormentor, and holds
him until the watching catcher transfers him to his basket!
I will now pass on to describe what I consider the most
interesting and sporting of all methods of bird-catching--the
using of bird-lime in an "active" sense. The accompanying
photo, of a bird-catcher was taken at Lucknow. In his right
hand are a number of thin bamboos, all furnished with a hollow
joint at one end, so that they may be fitted together upon the
principle of a chimney sweep's brush, or a fishing-rod. Each
bamboo is about five feet long, and every catcher carries from
four to eight of them. At the end of the topmost joint a forked,
limed twig, about a foot long, is inserted. When not in use, the
twig is carried in the bird lime receptacle--a thick, hollow
portion of bamboo about a foot long--which is seen in the photo,
stuck in the right side of the catcher's loin cloth. The flat,
circular basket at the man's left elbow is for putting the birds in,
when caught. When the catcher sees a bird in a tree overhead.

which he wishes to capture, he quickly lengthens his rod with as
many joints as may be necessary (according to the height of the
bird), gently pushing up the rod until the limed twigs are within
a foot or two of the bird. Then, by a sudden push, at the same
time slightly twisting the rod, a capture is generally effected. In
order to decrease the possibility of the bird being frightened by
the sight of the catcher, a screen of green leaves is often
attached to his left arm.
Arboreal birds are the ones which are chiefly caught by
this method--especially those which are of solitary habits. The
notes of the first songster, perched high up in a tree overhead,
may be suddenly cut short by the gliding, sticky tips of the
catcher's rod. Quite recently, having procured the necessary
implements for this " active " sport, I started for a beautiful
garden, in Upper India, well shaded by orange- and mango-trees,
for a morning's bird-catching. Ignoring such ordinary birds as
Barbets, Mynahs, Dhvals, Babblers, etc., I sought something
uncommon from an aviculturist's point of view. In the course
of a short time my patience was rewarded by the capture of the
four following species :--

new to the Loudon Zoo, and have probably never been seen

catching for trial in the British Isles.

THE OSPREY.
Pandion carolinensis.
By J. Lewis Bonhote, M.A.
It must have been during the early days of 1902 that he
first saw the light of day, and doubtless brought joy into his
parents' hearts. His home was some 25 feet up on the summit
of the tallest mangrove of the district, and from this lofty pinnacle
he might, had he felt so inclined, have had a view of miles upon
miles of mangroves, broken up here and there by the clear blue
of the water, from which his parents would daily take toll to
supply the needs of his inordinate appetite.
Of man his parents knew little or nothing; true there was
a settlement of perhaps a dozen huts some 50 miles away, and at
sea, some four miles off, many small sailing boats would con-
tinually be passing and repassing; but these men cared nothing
for the great bird that now and again would swerve round their
ships, for they were earning far too precarious a livelihood by
sponging to have any time to waste on mere birds. In addition
to "Joey," for we must give him a name, two brothers were
hatched about the same time, and for a month all passed un-
eventfully, plenty of food and fresh air, causing the young
birds to grow apace.
One morning, however, Joey's father was somewhat per-
turbed by the sight of a human being coming towards his home ;
at once, mounting the top of a mangrove, he called out vigor-
ously, with a loud and shrill cry, and his mate who had been
fishing a short distance off came hurrying up and added her
cries to his. This doubtful enemy still continued his advance,
and finally reaching the nest, climbed up; there was no doubt
now about his intentions, and the parent birds determined to
defend their young ones vigorously, swerving down at the in-
truder again and again, but never actually daring to attack. It
did not however take long, and Joey and his two brothers were
borne away, leaving the parents to their now deserted home.
Although barely a month old, each of the three young ones had
found time to develop a definite character. The youngest was

still comparatively small, and although rather shy at first, never-
theless soon became bolder, though continually kept in check
and bullied by his brothers; the next was a large and vicious
bird, persecuting his younger brother and crying out whenever
anyone approached him ; lastly came Joey, a bird of absolutely
unruffled temperament, whose sole idea in life was to be quiet,
an idea which later on caused his death.

At first they all three had a most peculiar habit Illustrated
in the above cut, when approached by anyone, of sitting up on
their tarsi, drooping their wings and head, and then vigorously
screaming while in this position ; even when adult, they would
011 being approached, hold the head well below the so-called
shoulders of the wings in a somewhat vulturine position which
I take to be a remnant of this early pose.
For the first week they absolutely refused food, which had
to be forced down their throats four or five times a day; Joey
would take his without moving ; he suffered his mouth to be
opened and the food to be put in and pushed down his throat.
No 2 would fight and struggle viciously, and show that he
already understood the use of his claws, while the youngest took

it from one's fingers, evidently realizing the advantage of his
elder brothers being too shy to fight him. After nearly a fort-
night's travelling and camping out they all arrived safely at
headquarters, and were established in a fair-sized aviary : and
soon after they had partially recovered from the first shock, fed
eagerly on the fish with which they were provided. Joey and
No. 2 were now practically full grown, but the younger one did
not grow much, and died shortly after the hand-feeding ceased,
possibly because of his brothers' persecution, but the cause was
not clear.
The other two lived on in peace for some weeks, till one
day, for no assignable reason, No. 2 ended his short career, and
Joe)&apos;&apos; was left in full possession of a fairly large aviary. There he
would sit almost motionless all day, unless anyone approached,
when he would lower his head in the vulturine position noted
above, and call out with the plaintive cry of his species.
He had an excellent appetite, and used to clear up from
four to six pounds of fish daily, and for the first two months of
his life was fed twice a day. He would not take food out of one's
hand, but as soon as it was placed in the aviary he would pounce
upon it, carry it to the ground, and bustle away into a corner
with drooping wings and outspread tail. When about five
months old, he started for England in a large case of which more
than half one side was a door; for the first three days he refused
food, but eventually he gave in and ate his daily rations with
avidity. I used to visit Joey daily during the voyage, take him
from his case, and hold him up to the wind on my arm, that he
might be able to spread and exercise his wings, and prevent
them becoming cramped; on the sixteenth day he landed safely
in England, and was installed at my aviaries.
Here, for several months he did well, and completed a
partial moult of his small feathers, but remained always of a
very sluggish disposition, sitting solemnly all day on a perch or
the ground, and but seldom offering to move. He never took a
bath, or indeed any notice of the water in his compartment, but
simply sat and ate, occasionally, when approached, ruffling up
his feathers and calling out. Winter came, and with it the cold

weather of November and December; being fearful of losing my
friend, on whom I had already bestowed so much care, I gave
him rather more food, and so I am afraid was indirectly respon-
sible for his death, which occurred suddenly from a fit in
December last, and when examined all his organs proved to be
clogged with fat. Such was his end, and great was my sorrow,
for although his ways were dull and uninteresting, yet he came
of a fine race, and one which is seldom seen in captivity for any
length of time, and is not very well suited for such a life.
In keeping birds of prey one has to remember that the
pursuit of their sustenance entails such violent exertion that,
unless moved by the pangs of hunger, they are the most sedentary
of birds ; and further I doubt whether, in a wild state, they ever
chase their food until driven by hunger so to do. Consequently
in aviaries, where they are regularly fed, unless their diet be
limited and they be fasted once a week, they become at once
mopish and accumulate vast stores of fat. They are well
adapted from their natural means of livelihood to sometimes go
supperless to bed, a course which only stirs them to more healthy
activity in the morning; and in captivity I recommend that they
should be fed moderately during the week, with a good feed in
the shape of fur or feather on one day, and a complete fast on the
following day. I am aware that in the case of the Osprey I did
not practise what has just been preached, which was due to my
over anxiety not to lose him, and his death proves my mistake.
There is one more point to be noted in keeping birds of prey;
contrary to general ideas they are most susceptible to cold,
probably due in part to their sedentary habits ; and the aviary in
which they are kept should be roomy and closed in on all sides,
except the front, which should face so as to get a fair percentage
of the day's sun, while at the same time it should be so constructed
that they can always get some shade should they so desire. The
perches are best placed lengthways, the one at the back being
higher than that in front, and on the ground in front of both
perches the}&apos;' should be given a bath at least once a week, and
the floor should be covered with fairly coarse sand. I am not
claiming anything new or original in this method of keeping the
raptorial birds; those who have kept them will doubtless learn

nothing new, and may differ on several points, but it is the

birds" may be glad to learn of a practicable method, which will

{Merida migratoria).
[The following interesting paper, from the pen of our
highly esteemed member Professor \V. E. D. Scott, appeared
in the American Journal Science , and is here reproduced by the
Author's permission.]
On June 17, 1902, a pair of Rob ins 41 {Memla migratoria&apos;)
confined in a large room with some hundred and fifty other birds,
of various sorts, hatched eggs which had been laid for some
twelve days. This pair of Robins were birds about four years old,
and were what are known as hand-reared birds. I had taken
them when very young from wild parents and raised them by
hand.
On examining the nest after the second day I found there
was only one young bird. It appeared to be perfectly healthy
and normal, and so matters went on until the fourth day. O11
the morning of the fourth day I found the young Robin had
disappeared from the nest, but the female bird was still brooding.
It now occurred to me to substitute two wild young, rather older,
from a nest of Robins that had been hatched out of doors in the
yard. I introduced these two young birds to the parent birds,
with some remonstrance on their part, but within five minutes of
the time when I placed them in the nest the old birds were feed-
ing them, and were apparently as solicitous for them as if they
had been their own. At the close of the day, the substitution
having been accomplished early, and I having watched the birds
closely, it appeared to me that only one of the two young birds was
being fed, and I took the other from the nest to rear it by hand.

Professor William E. D. Scott,
Both young birds are now going about, beginning to fly,
learning to eat unaided, etc., I feeding one, and the male parent
Robin feeding the other.
The following comments suggest themselves to me :
To go back in the history of the parent birds, they were
birds that were taken from a nest in May, 1898, and were naked
and blind, probably not more than three days old when adopted.
The usual method of procedure which I have employed in rear-
ing wild birds by hand is to take an entire brood and nest, and
keeping the young birds as undisturbed as possible, to do practi-
cally as near what the old birds do as is attainable.
It is unnecessary to suggest that the parent birds I am
speaking of are healthy aud vigorous, because the very fact
that they have bred in captivity seems to determine this. A
word seems essential to their method of nest-building. All the
Robins that I have in captivity, some sixteen or seventeen
in number, of which three or four pairs breed annually, are
unable to build a nest-structure, though furnished with every
facility, except under particular conditions which I am about tO&apos;
relate. They have been unable apparently to erect a nest of the
conventional Robin type. The trees in the room in which they are
confined seem to present every kind of fork aud crotch and angle
of branch that Robins select out of doors for nest sites. After
watching these birds for two years in their efforts to build nests,
when they were supplied with every material, the mud for the cup
and all kinds of grasses and rootlets for the foundation and super-
structure, I found that apparently they were unable to formulate
a nest that would stay together. I therefore provided them with
small circular baskets, which were at once taken possession of,
and generally the process of nest-building was as follows : They
selected various grasses aud rootlets, and after much work,
covering a period of some three or four days, they lined the
baskets in a manner that seemed to them satisfactory, when they
proceeded to lay eggs and go through the ordinary aud regular
processes of Robins' lives during the breeding season. However,
in most cases they were so much interfered with by the other
birds at large in the room with them that they failed to succeed
in hatching their eggs ; or, if they did hatch them, the young

were destroyed by other birds whenever an opportunity was
given.
It is rather difficult in such a heterogeneous company to
determine exactly what transpires; but this is about the case :
They do not attempt to build any cnp of mud in such a nest as I
have indicated, but the particular pair of Robins in question did
not put a mud floor in the basket. I was unable to see them feed
or take care of the very small young Robin which I observed in
their nest and which was their own progeny, during its early
infancy ; but when I substituted the foster-children, as I may call
them, that were older than the young bird, all the operations of
feeding and taking care of the young were apparent. The female
bird brooded the young ones for periods of from fifteen minutes
to au hour,while the male bird constantly brought her food for the
young. He also removed all excrement as it was evacuated and
carried it at least ten feet away from the nest, and generally
farther. Twice I saw him eat the excrement after he had laid
it on the floor. I have watched Robins carefully out of doors ;
and so far as I am able to judge, these Robins in captivity went
through all of the actions and attained all the results that Robins
attain with broods out of doors. It is not a little singular that
they neglected, or that I fancied they neglected, to take care of
one of the young ones, and that their attention was entirely
concentrated 011 a single bird. All of these actions that I have
recorded must have been instincts awakened by the various
stimuli which precede instinctive acts, for no education by
imitating the acts of older birds was possible.
It is also interesting in this connection to record the fact
that another pair of Robins breeding, or attempting to breed,
under similar conditions, so far as I know have failed to lay eggs,
or their eggs have been stolen by other birds after they were
laid. However, the female parent is incubating and is fully as
4 broody ' as any hen would be under like circumstances. That is,
I may go up to the nest where she sits, and it is absolutely
necessary for me to take her from the nest by force if I wish to
see what is beneath her. At such times she bites my finger and
fights, and when removed from the nest, utters all the alarm cries
and notes that a bird out of doors does when disturbed.

More about the Spotted Whig.
The special point to bear in mind in considering the fore-
going records is the fact that all of the birds in question were
hand-raised-birds that cannot have gained anything by experi-
ence or education from acts performed by their parents ; and all
of their doings that I have recorded I suggest are in the line of
pure instinct.

Psaroglossa spiloptera.
Since I wrote my article upon this bird in the December
number of this Magazine, I have purchased the second edition
of Hume's " Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds." At p. 162 of the
first volume Mr. Oates makes the following remarks about the
species:--
"The eggs are so different in character from those of all
the Starlings that doubts might necessarily arise as to whether
this species is placed exactly where it ought to be by Jerdon and
others. I possess at present only three eggs of this bird, which
I owe to Captain Hutton. They are decidedly long ovals, much
pointed towards the small end, and in shape and coloration not
a little recal those of Myiophoneus temmincki. The eggs are
glossless, of a greenish or greyish-white ground, more or less
profusely speckled and spotted with red, reddish brown, and
dingy purple. In two of the eggs the majority of the markings
are gathered into a broad irregular speckled zone round the large
end. In the third egg there is just a trace of such a zone and no
markings at all elsewhere. In length they vary from i - 03 to
ro8, and in breadth from o&apos;68 to 074."
Colonel Charles Bingham, who is familiar with Psaroglossa
in a wild state replied, when I asked him his opinion as to the
natural position of the species :--" Undoubtedly a Bulbul ; it
agrees with the Bulbuls in almost all its actions when at
liberty."

When last at the Natural History Museum I asked Dr.
Sharpe what conclusion Mr. Pycraft had come to from a study of
the anatomy of the Spotted-wing, and he answered :--"Well, he
agrees with you that it is a Bulbul ; but it is a strange thing and
I can't quite understand it; it is certainly said to fly like a
Starling, and the Glossy Starlings lay spotted eggs."

Parrot lovers will welcome Part IV. of Mr. Setli-Smith's
book on Parrakeets, more especially as it treats of the more
commonly kept species.
This part embraces a good many kinds. The Crimson-
wing, the King Parrakeet, the Masked and the Shining, the
Dove-bird, the Hanging Parrakeet, and some of the Platycerci ,
are amongst those treated of, so there is 110 want of variety.
And we are grateful for the plates of such unfamiliar birds as
Sclater's Hanging Parrakeet and Brown's Parrakeet. Indeed, if
we have a fault to find, it is that Mr. Goodchild's admirable
painting should be wasted upon such well-known birds as
Pennant's Parrakeet and the Yellow-rumped Parrakeet, instead
of giving us plates of Masters's, or of Psittinus incertus. It is
true that an aviculturist is not likely to have such a piece of luck
as to acquire one of these, but then we might have said the same
of the Polyielis alexatidrcz, or of the Golden-shoulder some years
back. And it is of great importance to be able to turn to a
figure of an unknown bird. No description equals a plate.
In the accounts of the Crimson-wings and the King, Mr.
Seth-Smith does not note what I have found the habit of these
birds, their always nesting on the ground--nor does he comment
on the peculiar musky smell of the Masked Parrakeet, which
makes a bird otherwise so desirable as a pet, unsuitable for
dwelling rooms.

Corresponde?ice, Notes, etc.
It is singular that with nine species of Love-birds known
only three ever reach this country. It is a pity the author is
obliged to give the Rosy-face a bad character for shrieking, for
so small a bird would otherwise make a charming pet. Though
no one seems to record a talking Love-bird, it cannot be more im-
possible, one would think, to teach it than to teach a Budgerigar
to talk.
The Hanging Parrakeets are, viewed as pets, hardly worth
the space given to them. If the soft food they require is no draw-
back, their dirty habits prevent any but the most determined
bird-lover wishing to keep them.
The Platycerci are always fascinating, and Mr. Seth-Smith
would not have wearied us, had he given us double as much " copy"
about them as he has. He does not take up the question of the
different coloured tails in the sexes of Pennants, started by Mr.
Farrar some time ago. Perhaps he thought so thorny a question
better left alone. But though it seemed to so phlegmatic a
person as myself to engender an unnecessary amount of heat, I
never thought the question had been thrashed out as thoroughly
as it deserved to be.
However, let us not complain at what Mr. Seth-Smith has
not given to us, but tender our grateful thanks for what he has.

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE MISUSE OF THE MEALWORM.
Sir, --The Ruffs at the Western Aviary are not pinioned, so this does
not explain the lateness of the moult.
They are all kept together and have the same food, viz.:--Hard-
boiled egg, Spratt's chicken meal and chopped raw beef, so why should
some retain the breeding plumage while others cast it off?
A mealworm diet cannot explain this.
Mr. Phillipps states that I have not had the Ruff long enough to
observe its character.

Surely ten months is ample time to observe the habits of any bird*, for
I notice Mr. Phillipps wrote an extremely long and interesting article on
birds he had for only seven.
There must be some other reason for this prolonged moult, but
suggestions like those advanced bv Mr. Phillipps do not help us very much.
Perhaps Mr. St. Ouintin, who has had large experience of wading
birds, will give his opinion on the subject.

PECTORAL FINCHES, &amp;c.
Sir, -- I have a pair of Pectoral Finches and can find nothing about
them in my books on birds. Will you kindly tell me if these finches are
to be trusted in an aviary with Gouldiaus and Waxbills? My two are wild
and do not look amiable so I still keep them in a cage.
Can you recommend me any book on foreign finches ? I have Dr.
Butler's Foreign Bird Keeping. (Mrs.) R. S. Vivian.
The following reply has been forwarded to Jl/rs. Vivian :
Pectoral Finches are not common birds in this country, and I think I
am right in stating that, only during the last year or so, has a pair been
exhibited at the great Crystal Palace Bird .Show.
The late Mr. Erslcine AII011 had a pair of Pectoral Finches among the
three hundred birds associated in his bird-room, and he does not mention
them among those which he found treacherous towards their associates
(see Avic. Mag., Vol. III., p. 125).
Of the Chestnut-breasted Finch, which is certainly related to the
Pectoral Finch, I had, at various times, eight examples living amicably
with Waxbills and many other small finches in one of my aviaries; so that
I should net anticipate mischief from M. pectoralis.
You can obtain a copy of the second edition of my " Foreign Finches
in Captivity," through our publisher, I think at about a fifth of the cost of
the original hand-coloured edition : of course the plates, being reproduced
in chromo-lithography, are not anything like so perfect in colouring as the
4to volume; but the text is a little more up to date, having been revised
two or three years later. A. G. BuTEER.
* Not necessarily, especially when that period does not include the nesting&apos; season,
nor the birds with full wings. A little difference in the state of health, age, length and
condition of captivity, a number of little things affect individual birds as they do human
beings. For instance, at the present moment I have here two male I.ong-tailed Whvdahs,
the one in summer the other in winter plumage. East summer the one was in my aviary
the other elsewhere, with the result that they are assuming their wedding plumes at
different seasons. Another Member, with beautiful aviaries, complains that her specimens
failed altogether to don their wedding dresses last year, and have not done so up to the
present time (May 7). I am under the impression that all of these birds were brought
over from South Africa at the same time and by the same hand, and yet they now differ
widely.--R.P.

DIAMOND DOVES, &amp;c.
Sir,--F rom the account which Miss R. Alderson gives of the
Diamond Doves in the May number of the Magazine, it would appear as if
these pretty little Doves were generally hard to breed in this country.
I should like to know whether mv experience with them is at all
unique as I find them breed freely. I have just the one pair which are
allowed to fly about in my wired-in garden, with finches both English and
foreign, possibly altogether over a hundred birds.
During the first week in March the lieu bird built a miniature nest in
a fir tree growing in the garden and laid two eggs. I feared for the safety
of the eggs upon such an apology for a nest but they were both hatched
within a fortnight, the cock taking regular turns with the hen in incubation,
and on Monday last both young birds left the nest and are flying about
freely. In size they are not larger than a fair sized Whydali bird;
already the hen has built another nest in an adjoining fir tree, and
appears to be about to lay again.
Might I trouble you with the following questions :

The Jollowing reply zoas sent to Mr. Rabbich :
Diamond Doves are not difficult to breed in outdoor aviaries; though
I failed to breed them in my indoor ones : our Editor has always been able
to breed these doves without trouble.
The best way to test the sex of the Pekin Nightingale is, to imitate
the monotonous call-note of the hen: a cock almost invariably replies with
a short song-like phrase of seven to nine syllables.
The sexual differences are so slight, and the colouring and size of the
hen so variable, that (after making several mistakes in my efforts to pick
out pairs) I have concluded that the answering call of the cock is the only
absolutely sure test.
The hen has no song : the cock has a short song for a call, and a
much longer song for the delectation of himself and family.
The Pekin Nightingale has been bred more than once in captivity in
England ; probably Mr. Keulemanns the artist was one of the first (if not
the first) successful breeders. * A. G. BuTEER.
* I overlooked the last three lines of Mr. Rabbich's letter. The Indigo Bunting and
Nonpareil differ markedly in colouring from their hens, though the former assumes almost
the female dress in winter (I believe both have been bred in aviaries). Mr. Rabbich does
not say which Tanager he refers to.--A.G.B.

NIGHTINGALES, PASSERINE PARRAKEETS, &amp;c.
Sir, -- I have kept more than one Nightingale through the Winter in
sheltered but open and unheated aviary, and have a hen bird at present
that was put out on 28th February, 1900, and is perfectly healthy at present.
I have never been able to get a cock bird, or at any rate one that would
sing.
Is it not rather hypercritical to complain of a Passerine Parrakeet
being called a Love-bird (p. 243) ? See Miss Hawke's enquiry on p. 245. I
conceive that 99 people out of 100 would speak of any of the small species,
were it red faced, or white-headed, or blue-winged, or even the Budgerigar,
as a Love-bird. It may not be scientific, but it is at least more generally&apos;
intelligible than the names which the scientific classifier uses.
I thank Miss Alderson for her information about the colour of her
young Lavender-finch. I am still at a loss as to the identity of my bird, its
beak being entirely unlike that of a Lavender-finch. It is large for the size
of the bird, and similar in shape to that of a Chaffinch, rather a formidable
vicious looking black beak. The bird is about the size of a Silverbill, but
shorter and dumpier in its build, and has no light colour about it, only a
dark, dingy blue gray body with red wings and tail. The dealer entered
him in the invoice as " Hybrid," and was evidently unaware what it really
was.
Cordon Bteus. The cock bird is clearly the culprit and accountable
for his wife's baldness. I have placed him in solitary confinement.
Chas. L. Rothkra.
[The Passerine Parrakeet, although superficially resembling the
Love-birds (Agapornis) , is geuerieally perfectly distinct, and we do not see
that it is hypercritical to point this out.
Mr. Rothera's description of the bird he cannot identify appears to
correspond with that of the Aurora Finch, Pytelia phoenicoptera. -- Ed.]
THE LITTLE OWL.
Sir,--C ould you identify the accompanying bird ? There were a pair
about here for several weeks, but a youth threw at this one and broke its
wing. I was very&apos; vexed.
Belton, Uppingham, May nth. F. H. Rudkin.
The follozumg reply teas sent to Mr. Rudkin.
The bird was a male of the Common Little-Owl, Carine noctua, or
Athene noctua, as lovers of the Classics delight to call it, for it is the Owl
which was sacred to Pallas Athene. It is a common species in most of the

countries that border the Mediterranean, extending northwards as far as
Germany, etc., and eastwards to Southern Russia, Asia Minor, and perhaps
farther.
To what extent it is a genuine visitor to England, or resident, is not
known, as numbers of imported specimens have been set free, notably by
the late Lord Lilford, Mr. Meade-Waldo, and I believe by Mr. St. Quiutin.
As long ago as 1853 or 1854, my brother and a companion took a
solitary egg from a hole in a pollard willow in a little coppice in Worcester-
shire. I saw the egg within two minutes of its having been taken, and on
a later occasion visited the nest-hole. I have the egg now, and suppose that
it belongs to this species.
It makes an interesting and absurdly comical pet, and in some of its
ways reminds me of the Burrowing Owl.
It is a useful bird to the farmer, killing mice, voles, insects-and
birds I regret to say ; and the species has not become well established in this
country generally, Mr. Meade-Waldo's neighbourhood, -where it is "quite
common " as a wild species (VII., p. 112), being I fear the exception and not
the rule. It is a misfortune, therefore, that the bird should have been
slaughtered, as doubtless the pair were about to breed, or perhaps were
breeding, for they should have had a nest by this time. However, if I may
judge by the plumage and its general poor condition, an attempt was made
to keep this bird alive, and the breaking of the wing may not have been
quite recent.
Reginald Phillipps.
HEMP SEED.
One of our members has recently lost some valuable Parrakeets from
fits, and we suggested that hemp seed may have been the cause. The Rev.
Professor Henslow seemed to think that as " bhang," which affects the
heads of the natives of India so powerfully, is obtained from hemp, it might
be that hemp seed may excite the brains of birds and thus provoke the
fits. Most kindly he has obtained for us the following communication from
an analytical chemist to whom the question was put, who wrote:--"I do
not think that any analysis yet published of hemp seed --wherever growu--
shows the presence of any toxic or medicinal principle. Still one would
expect that where the plant produces, in tropical countries, the active
principle which characterizes "bhang," etc., the seeds would contain at
least traces of this substance. But this argument will not affect the case of
hemp seed grown in Europe. I have also been in the habit of looking
upon the oil in hemp seed as the offending constituent. It amounts to
33--36 per cent., and is, in some animals at least, found to be less
digestible than the oil of some other oleaginous seeds and grains."

It would appear, therefore, that hemp seed in all probability causes
indigestion, which sets up in some of the Parrakeets a heated and impure
condition of the blood, followed by feather-picking, fits, and other
mischief.--R. P.

NIGHTINGALE OFF SOUTH AFRICA.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9890163125" page_id="10284402"  page_num="Page 283" year="" vol="">
I11 a very interesting article by Mr. George Carrick entitled " A Trip
to Australia," which appeared in this Magazine last year (Vol. VIII. p. 223),
the author tells how a Nightingale came on board his ship in Latitude
39*o3 S., Longitude 26 Q 46 E., or 306 miles due South of Port Elizabeth,
South Africa. Shortly after the publication of this article I received the
following letter from Dr. P. L. Sclater, late Secretary to the Zoological
Society of London, and an Honorary Member of this Society
''Do you really think that Mr. Carrick caught a Nightingale 300
miles South of Port Elizabeth (see Avic. Nag&apos;. Aug. last, p. 223) or is there
not some mistake ? The Nightingale is not in the South African list, and I
hope you will get the story properly investigated."
Mr. Carrick had then gone back to Australia, and I was unable to
communicate with him until his return ; but I happened at that time to be
in correspondence with Mr. A. J. Campbell, of Melbourne, a well-known
Australian ornithologist, who, Mr. Carrick stated, often paid him a visit on
arrival, and inspected his birds. I therefore asked Mr. Campbell if he had
seen the bird and could corroborate Mr. Carrick's identification of it. Mr.
Campbell replied as follows: "Referring to your question re Mr. Carrick
and the Nightingale caught at sea, I did not understand where the bird was
taken, but I saw in Mr. Carrick's possession, on his ship, a bird which I
believe was the Nightingale, and a friend of mine from Britain pronounced
it to be that bird. I also know the person who purchased it. The bird was
successfully kept for three or four months on mealworms and other
insectivorous food, but in our autumn I think it got mixed up in its moult
and succumbed." I have since had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Carrick on
his return to England last January, and he told me that he was perfectly
certain that the bird was a genuine Nightingale, and that it came on board
at the exact spot stated in his article. At the Crystal Palace Bird Show in
February last he examined the Nightingales closely, and told me that he
had 110 doubt whatever that the bird above referred to belonged to the same
species.
There are three species of Nightingales, the Greater Nightingale or

" Sprosser " (Daulias philomela), inhabiting Scandinavia, Denmark, and

differs very slightly from oirr own bird, but to whichever form it belonged,
the fact of a Nightingale being captured so much farther South than it has
previously been recorded from, is well worthy of especial notice.

THE HIMALAYAN BLUE-PIE: THE INDIAN ROLLER.
Sir,-- Perhaps you can help me to identify a bird that I bought some
six months ago ; it is a blue Jay of some kind, but the dealer from whom I
bought it could not tell me quite where it came from. I will give its
markings: Head and neck, black, with white spots on the top of head
which the bird can move at will; the back of the bird a very nice light
navy blue; the breast is bluish white; tail black, with white markings
underneath ; the bill is coral red, also the legs and feet. He has been out
in one of my open aviaries all this last week, and will eat hardly anything
but fresh meat; he will come and take pieces out of my hand. Also do you
think it safe to turn two Hunting Cissas out with him next month, also a
pair of Indian Magpies ? I may state lie can kill a Parrakeet or a rat as
well as any dog.
I am sending you either to-morrow or next day, carriage paid, skin of
a lovely bird of the Jay family, belonging to a friend of mine, in the hope
that you will kindly tell me what it is ; he bought it with several other
skins from a sailor, who said he had brought it from Australia. Perhaps
you can tell me if they have ever been imported. I should very much like
to have one or two alive. H. W. BURGESS.
[The bird described is the Himalayan Blue-Pie (Urocissa occipitalis),
a remarkably handsome species. Perhaps some other member who has
kept the bird will give us his experience of it as an aviary bird.
Whether Mr. Burgess's specimen would agree with the Cissas and Indian
Magpies it is difficult to say 7 , but we should consider the experiment some-
what risky. *
The skin sent is that of the Indian Roller (Coracias indicus), a species
which is occasionally imported alive into this country, but has naturally not
been studied by aviculturists so well as its European relative. (.See Vol. IV.
pp. 103 and 121; Vol. V. pp. 46, 64 and 182 ; Vol. VII. p. 217 ).--Ed.]
* I have kept many of the Blue-Pies [Urocissa), three species, and several Hunting'
Cissas, and they did not interfere with one another, but they were in a large aviary. The
name " Indian Magpie" is vague : Probably a Tree-Pie (Demirocifta). A pair of Wandering
Tree-Pies were great favourites here some years ago--but the amount of space is the main
point.--R.P.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after deatli as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. No
replies can be sent by post.
Banded Paurakeet, lieu. (Miss F. Sliowell). Found dead in aviary.
[Concussion of brain : there being a blood-clot over the entire right
side of the head].
Californian Quail, hen. (Miss R. Alderson). Feathers fluffed up,
slightly lame on one foot, put in a warm place, suddenly collapsed and
died. [Cause of death was inflammation of the oviduct owing to
retention of a broken and partially shelled egg. Your soft food is apt
to cause this want of shell formation. These birds do well on dry seed
and green food, with a small amount of egg or insect food occasionally].
PENNANT ParrakeeT, young hen. (Mr. A. J, Salter). Purchased only a
few days; yesterday appeared drowsy, but no outward symptom of
ailment; this morning excrement watery; fell off perch, dead; has
been kept in conservatory and fed on canary seed. [Acute enteritis
cause of death. Likely causes : sudden change of diet, very cold water
to drink, or contracted chill]. _
Red-headed Gouldian. (Captain B. R. Horsbrugli). Bought five days
ago, seemed well, looked puffy, kept fluttering his wings. [Cannot
understand bird appearing well: he is a mere frame. Death was due to
heart failure, caused by exhaustion subsequent on malassimilation of
food, hence the extreme wasting].
Lovebird. (Rev. R. II. Wilmot). [No particulars of symptoms.
Fractured skull was cause of death].
Lavender Finch. (Mr. Bathe). Found dead. [Concussion of brain
caused by an injury to back of skull].
Hen Cockatiel and Java Sparrow. (Lady Carnegie). 1st, Found dead
this morning; I think I broke an egg when feeling bird over. Bird
excessively fat; died of egg binding ; fed on canary, millet, oats, cuttle
fish bone, old mortar, and green food. 2nd, Found dead; had not
apparently been ailing. [Bird a great deal too fat. Fatty degener-
ation of liver was cause of death].
Satin Bower Bird. (Mrs. Johnstone). Found dead. It appeared to be
quite well yesterday; kept in an outdoor aviary; been out a month.
[I am at a loss to understand how it was the bird showed no symptoms
of ill health, as the liver and bowels were acutely inflamed and must
certainly have been thus not less than twenty-four hours].

Zebra Finch. (Mrs. Maxwell Slierston). Found dead, and very stiff as if
wings were glued to sides. [Concussion of brain was cause of death.
The rigid condition referred to was rigor mortis , which is present in
almost all cases after death for a varying time, but frequently absent in
animals killed by lightening].
Bearded Reedring. (Mr. H. L. Sicli) Found on its back, dead; been
turned out three days. [Fracture of skull at base of beak, caused
by a direct injury at the point of the bill, most likely during flight].
Tri-COROURED Mannikin. (Miss Appleton). Found dead; turned into
outdoor aviary yesterday. [Concussion of brain was cause of death.
It was a lien]. _
Parrot Finch, hen. (Mr. Cummings). Slightly puffy j&apos;esterday ; found
dead to-day. [Acute enteritis].
Brue- fronted Amazon Parrot, and Saffron Finch, ist, Ailing
slightly four days, had difficulty in breathing and swallowing.
[Pneumonia caused by a chill. 2nd, No particulars; congestion of
longs]. _
Orange Bishop. (Mr. H. B. Rathborne). Looked dull some time, eyes
dull, died this evening. [Ruptured blood vessel on brain, which left a
clot of blood, causing pressure. It was of some time standing. Your
bird not moulting properly signified debility].
COCKATIER, lieu. (Mrs. Charrington). In outdoor aviary, apparently well
yesterday, found dead this morning. [Acute inflammation of oviduct
and bowels, owing to retention of a soft-shelled egg].
BUDGERIGAR. (Miss Willatt). Has been ailing a fortnight. Fed on millet,
canary, oats, hemp, and sunflower seed. [Congestion of liver. I
should say the hemp and sunflower seed would quite account for it].
Brack-headed Gourdian. (Mr. H. L. Sicli). Was in an outdoor aviary,
did not fly much, suffered with diarrhoea. It turned its head about
slowly, I thought it was getting blind. [Your bird died of enteritis.
The weather has not been fit for freshly-imported Gouldians nor
acclimatized birds of this species, to my mind. The movements of
the head were symptomatic of pain].

THE VARIED LORIKEET.
Plilosclcra versicolor.
By Reginald Phillipps.
At page 114 of the current Volume of the Avicultural
Magazine, our Honorary Editor introduced this pretty little
Lorikeet to our Members.
It was on, or very shortly before, the 15th November last
that about nine supposed pairs reached London. It seems likely,
but I do not know, that they came from the continent, as, writing
from Florence on the 4th of the same 111011th, the Contessa
Baldelli informed me that some had been offered to her by an
Italian dealer. It is a little humiliating that the honour of first
bringing living examples of this interesting species from Aus-
tralia does not fall to the Britisher, and that only the " remnants "
should have come to us. Whatever the exact circumstances of
the case may have been, the fact remains that they were 011 sale
on the continent before they reached this country.
It was 011 the 15th November that two " pairs " were
offered to me, two of the birds having red crowns, the other two
only the red frontal band. It was supposed that the red-crowned
specimens were the males, and the others females ; but, if I
mistake not, the latter are immature, the former mature, birds
whether male or female, the red crown being a sign of maturity
not of sex. I selected two of the birds, and believe I have a
true pair, but the red-crowned bird is the female and the other the
male.

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
Very shortly after their arrival, Mr. Goodchild made a
water colour drawing of them as they were then, and a glance at
our illustration will enable our readers to see the plumage of the
mature and of the immature birds ; some of the other specimens
shewed intermediate stages between these two feathers, so that
probably it takes at least three years before the fully adult
plumage is attained.
The male has moulted since my pair were painted, and
his crown is now more brilliant than that of his fellow; he has
not so much of the plum colour about the breast nor is it of so
deep a shade, but he has more blue about the face, and the
yellow ear-coverts are more yellow, and more sharply defined
and conspicuous. There is a difference too in the curve of the
upper mandible, and the female has a black line along the basal
third of the culmen. Some time ago, however, she darted out of
her cage and dashed against the window, so these two differences
may be due to accident. He is now the larger bird of the two.
My male is a very healthy satisfactory bird, tame and
inclined to be friendly, and repeatedly utters his little warbling
"song"; but unfortunately I have not the time to respond to
his advances. The female, on the contrary, from the first has
not been so good, and is shy and nervous ; and for many weeks
she would utter wild shrieks every time I put my hand into the
cage for cleansing purposes, especially when I attempted to clean
the perches. The male has the common little dance of the
smaller Lorikeets. Moreover, since they have been in a large
cage, the male may frequently be seen on the watch--stiff and
straight as a bit of wood, head down and tail up at an angle of
about 45 degrees. Sometimes he slightly varies this position by
sitting (quite naturally and easily) as it were on the side of the
perch instead of on the top, the head being straight down, the
tail pointing to the skies, in which position he will remain
perfectly stiff and still for 40--60 seconds.
Mr. Goodchild, who, whilst painting them, had more time
to watch them than I have j^et been able to spare, quite agreed
with me as to the sexes.

flashing on the topmost flowering branches of the eucalypts and
melaleucas. It may be readily distinguished from all the other
Lorikeets by the narrow stripe of yellow down the centre of the
feathers of the plumage, and the rich, red crown of the head.

Mr. Reginald Philupps,
tralian Scrub. Their craving for water and the squeal of the
female may be especially noticed:--
" I am forwarding a skin of a Lorikeet (female) obtained
on the river here, where during the past month it has been
numerous, feeding on the honey of the bauhinia blossoms and
the river gums. Never saw it on the ground except when down
at water. It apparently lives almost entirely on honey. One
we caught, and which has taken very kindly to captivity, is
reported never to eat seed, but to subsist on sugar and water,
with perhaps now and again a small portion of bread soaked in
sugar and water. I examined three specimens recently that
suicided in a well. They were all females, and, like the one I
skinned, contained in their ovaries only very minute eggs The
bird sent fell into the sheep water-trough. I rescued it (only to
make a specimen), when it squealed so vigorously that in an
instant I was standing in a cloud of the Parrots, which settled on
my arms, hands, shoulders, and hat till they weighed down the
broad felt brim of the latter, almost to shut out my sight. There
must have been two or three dozen on me. It was a wonder-
fully pretty sight, and I should much have liked to have caught
the picture with a camera.-- Fred L. Berney. Richmond
(N.Q.), 2/11/02."
The reference to water reminds me that my birds, or one
of them, take a bath very nearly every warm morning before I
come down to breakfast. I notice that they come freely to the
bottom of their cage when no one is near, not only for the water-
dish on the floor but also for remnants of sultanas that have been
dropped, and any other food on the ground. Immediately, how-
ever, they observe any one approaching, they hurriedly scuttle
up to the perches. Doubtless naturally they would prefer taking
their bath in the wet leaves of trees after rain ; but drought and
captivity upset the private arrangements even of Varied Lori-
keets.
Most of the different kinds of food are in dishes hung up
inside the cage. Mr. Setli-Smith has told us about the food
suitable for these and other Lorikeets. With the milk and grapes
I likewise give dry crumbled biscuit, sweet but plain, of which

a certain amount is taken, and sultana raisins. Of the latter
they are especially fond ; but I must add that I give the very best
sultanas I can obtain, not the dirty mixture which is all that can
be purchased from the local grocers. I am not aware that my
birds have ever touched the seed always placed in the cage for
their use.
For a time, and until after Mr. Goodchild had completed
his work, I kept my Varied Lorikeets in a small cage in my
dining-room. Then for some time they were in a four-foot
flight cage, and the change to their larger domicile was highly
beneficial to them.
A much better six-foot cage has now become available for
their use ; and, as is often the case with nervous birds, they are
much more quiet in their larger home. In the larger cage, too,
they come more boldly and frequently to the ground, on which
they run with freedom and rapidity ; but, as they run along
perches in the same way, this does not necessarily indicate that
they go freely or at all to the ground in the wild state.
Unquestionably they are active birds, running along the boughs,
climbing after the blossoms, and without the slightest hesitation
hopping or bounding from perch to perch in the ordinary course
of their movements.
Towards the end of May, the male seemed to have com-
pleted his moult and the female to be well advanced ; but they
have moulted so gradually that, except for the change of colour
in the male, their sharp-pointed tails, and the cast feathers in the
cage, there has been nothing to indicate that they have been
moulting at all.
Judging from their moulting season, taken in connection
with the particulars furnished by Mr. Bernev, we may assume
that naturally they would breed towards November and Decem-
ber. How this will work out in our climate, however, remains
for some aspiring would be medal winner to find out for us.

Mr. G. S. Chase,
A HALF-DAY'S BIRD-NESTING WITH THE CAMERA.
By G. S. Chase.
For some time I have taken a great interest in the
fascinating pursuit of obtaining photographs of our feathered
friends' homes in situ, apart from the study of foreign birds in
aviaries ; and in this article I propose to describe the doings of a
half-day in the field.
Starting early after mid-day on one of my rambles, first by
the lane and then taking to the fields, I at last arrived at a pile
of rough cuttings from hedges, not many yards from a farm-
house, and, looking leisurely round, came upon my first quarry in
the shape of a nest of our well-known Blackbird {Merula merula&apos;)
(Fig 1.). It is a typical nest of this bird, although perhaps in a
somewhat exposed position, and almost on the ground, as will be
seen from the illustration.
Working along the hedgerows for some distance, and on
approaching a group of large gorse bushes, I heard the cry of a
Chaffinch (Fringilla coelcbs&apos;), and, suspecting that I must be " on
his preserves," I examined the gorse closely, and discovered his
mate comfortably seated on the nest (Fig. 2), which she left as my
apparatus was being fixed. The nest contained two eggs which
can be partly seen in the photograph.
Departing from the narrative a little, I may remark that,
whenever I come across the nest of a Chaffinch, it reminds me of
an incident which happened a few years ago, when a schoolboy.
Three or four boys, besides myself, were out bird-nesting and we
spied an old can lodged in a tall hawthorn hedge. Of course we
must, as boys do, throw stones at the can, and, to our surprise,
when a stone struck the can. out flew a bird, in great distress, to
a neighbouring tree. O11 examining the can, we found that a
pair of Chaffinches had selected this spot for a nesting place.
Returning to the story, I may mention that I made friends
with a gamekeeper, and, after a little coaxing, he told me he
knew of a Hawk's nest in a wood nearby, and, on my suggesting

that I should like to photograph it, we went to the spot--a tall
Mountain Fir, the nest being about forty feet from the ground.
I proceeded to climb (the rough bark of a fir tree is not pleasant
to the hands), the camera slung on my back, and, after a struggle,
reached the nest which contained five eggs. It was a very good
specimen of the nest of Accipiter nisus*; but, very much to my
disappointment, I found that to fix the camera was impossible,
the branches above the nest being very rotten ; and those on
which I sat, near the nest, would hardly bear my weight, and
were rather treacherous. I was thus forced to abandon this
opportunity.
After a short rest we moved on, and, when crossing a field
near the wood, I noticed a pond well surrounded with rushes,
and we took a walk round it. Beneath a small bush, overhanging
the pond, was the nest of a Moorhen ( Gallimda chloropus),
(Fig 3). This nest was rather difficult to photograph, being
about three feet from the top of the bank, and the water in the
pond too deep for wading. The photograph was eventually
obtained by placing one leg of the tripod over the bank, and
laying the other two legs flat along the ground, pegging them
down to prevent the camera toppling over into the water. It
will be seen from the illustration that the view is taken looking
directly down into the nest, the " sky " portion in the photo-
graph being the water in the pond.
As may be imagined, all these operations took up a con-
siderable amount of time, and the afternoon was then brought
to a close.
Concluding, it must be understood that the nests and eggs
are not to be seen exactly as represented in the photographs, as,
in almost every case, some part of the bush or other surround-
ings had to be removed a little in order to obtain a view of the
nest.

Dr. Arthur G. Butler,
THE LESSER ROCK-SPARROW.
Petronia dentata.
By Arthur G. Butler, Pli.D.
In the February number of Vol. IV. of the Magazine, a
note was inserted on the cover asking members of the Society
to forward to me dead specimens of any birds with perfect wings,
to enable me to extend my study of sexual differences in birds.
Several months later, as recorded in my ' Foreign Bird-
Keeping ' part I. p. 44, a travelling cage reached me in which
were three living birds:--a Long-tailed Grass-Finch, and two
different-looking small Sparrows. Outside, the cage was pen-
cilled :--"Parson Finch with injured wing, and two foreign
Sparrows ; better send them to Dr. Butler (address added), who
is studying the wings of birds." I never discovered the sender,
nor could anyone definitely name for me the two Sparrows,
though everyone believed them to be a pair. The late Mr.
Abrahams told me they were a pair of ' Yellow-throated Spar-
rows,' and that the hen was a most murderous bird, attacking
and killing birds even larger than herself: I therefore never
turned this supposed pair into an aviary, but kept them per-
manently in a flight cage, with a small cage hanging up in one
corner, in which I hoped to breed the species.
From time to time, year after year, from 189S up to the
present time, a nest has been built in the hanging cage, and eggs
have been laid (though rarely in the nest) ; these have generally
been broken by the birds ; though last year both birds spent
some time on the nest, attempting to hatch out two or three
eggs which chanced to be laid therein.
The eggs are almost certainly quite unknown to science,
inasmuch as Von Heuglin's statement that " their eggs, which
he found in a Weaver-bird's nest, were pure white," is still
quoted as authoritative by Capt. Shelley in his ' Birds of Africa '
(Vol. III. p. 263). Without doubt the eggs found by Von
Heuglin were Weaver's eggs, many of which are white.

Eventually, on May 9th, my supposed pair of birds both
got simultaneously egg-bound, and the supposed cock died.
After its death I squeezed out the egg, which (although broken)
was in all respects identical with those previously laid. I sent
the bird to a taxidermist to be skinned, and asked him to get it
correctly identified for me : this was done at the Natural History
Museum, the bird being pronounced a slightly aberrant example
of Petronia dentata, the forehead to the middle of the crown, the
throat, and centre of abdomen being snow-white in my specimen.
The general colouring of P. dentata is ruddy mouse-
brown, the median and greater wing-coverts with slightly paler
edges ; the flights and tail-feathers much darker but with pale
edges; wings below with the coverts and inner edges of the
flights whitish: the crown of the head is usually dark grey, but
in my bird, the back part is dark brown (a little more smoky
than the back) and with a large irregular snow-white frontal
patch. There is a broad reddish clay-brown eyebrow streak.
Usually the chin, upper half of throat, breast, and under tail-
coverts, are white, shading into pale brown on the sides of head
and throat. I11 my specimen the white splashes over, upon the
front of the face, and is strictly limited to the centre of the
throat, where it is continuous with the usual pale sulphur patch
in front of the breast; the whole abdomen also is white, only
stained at the sides with brown. Iris reddish-brown ; beak dark
horn-brown, flesh-coloured towards base of lower mandible; feet
dusky flesh-coloured.
The eggs, of which I was only able to save two, are re-
markably uniform in character for eggs of a Sparrow, but are
unmistakably of the Sparrow type, not white: they are more like
a very aberrant egg of the House Sparrow (fig. 141 of Brit. Birds
with their Nests and Eggs) in my collection, than any others
that I have seen, but, in some respects, remind one of some
eggs of the Greater Whitethroat, with which they also corres-
pond much better in size.
The ground of the egg is greenish-white, more or less
thickly dotted with dark brown ; the larger extremity is always
sooty blackish, exactly as if it had been held in the smoke of a

lamp until well blackened : the extent of the dull black patch
varies somewhat, but I have not seen one egg without it among
the many which my birds have broken. In shape they are broad
ovals resembling, both in outline and general size, those of the
Greater Whitethroat.
Capt. Shelley gives the following account of the distri-
bution of Petronia dentata in Africa:--" The Lesser Rock-
Sparrow inhabits northern Tropical Africa between about 9 0 and
18 0 N. lat.
The occurrence of this species in West Africa was first
made known to us by Dr. P. Rendall, who procured it close to
Bathurst on the Gambia river, and Sig. Fea has obtained speci-
mens on the Bissagos islands at Bulamo and Bissas. At Gambaga,
about 250 miles due north of Cape Coast Castle, Captain W.
Giffard collected a male and two females in January, August and
November, 1898, and Col. H. P. Northcott has presented to the
British Museum a male and an apparently young female killed
at the same place in January and July. Capt. Boyd Alexander
has, more recently, met with the species at Walwali, Gambaga,
and Karaga, so these birds must be not only resident, but also
plentiful in this district.
These Sparrows cross the Continent, for they range over
Abyssinia generally, but I cannot trace them farther south than
9 0 N. lat. I11 this latitude, on the Nile near the mouth of the
Seraf river, Captain H. M. Dunn obtained a specimen, and Lord
Lovat shot one at Maritchi in South Abyssinia. In Slioa accord-
ing to Dr. Rogazzi it is abundant, and he collected specimens at
Farre, and Antinori others at Ambo-Karra.
From Northern Abyssinia there are specimens in the
British Museum collected by Dr. Blanford and Mr. Jesse at Rairo,
Anseba, Gelamet, Bejook and Waliko."
The only published notes on the habits of the species
would seem to be those of Von Heuglin, who " met with the
species along the Blue Nile and its tributaries, near the White
Nile, and in the Abyssinian lowlands. They were found in pairs
or small flocks along the openings in the woodlands or perched

on the Lesser Rock-Sparroiv.
on the bushes ill the deserts, generally near water." He further
remarks that in habits and note they resemble our House-Sparrow.
After keeping the hen for about five years, I should say
that the note was distinctly sharper and clearer than that of
Passer domesticus. It is evidently a quarrelsome bird, the dis-
putes between it and the other hen (which from its pale huffish
eyebrow-streak is far more Weaver-like in appearance) being
frequent, and sometimes alarming.
The nest which was built in the cage was neatly formed,
externally of hay, internally of feathers and wool; and, so far
as I could judge, where nearly every egg was dropped from the
perch and smashed, the clutch consisted of from five to six
eocrc
I have now proved that the supposed young of this species
with 'sandy buff' eyebrow is represented by my surviving hen,
and that we either have here a case of dichroism in the same
bird, or else two races have been confounded as adult and young.
Both of my birds having been in the same cage for five years, it
is evident that age will not account for their difference in colour-
ing. Capt. Shelley observes :--" Were it not that the specimens
have been sexed by their collectors, one would have expected the
grey crowned birds with the rufous eyebrow and uniform backs
to have been adult males and the others adult females and
immature birds." It was therefore no great mistake for me to
suppose the two birds to be sexes, and wonder why I could not
breed from them: however, as the fact of their being both hens
has enabled me to throw some light upon the life-history of the
species, I do not complain ; and now that Ornithologists have
decided that it is necessary to give names to subspecies, I think
these two forms will certainly need separation. The form with
the pale eyebrow must therefore stand as the P. albigularis of
Brelim.
It seems probable that my specimens were imported from
the Western, rather than the North-Eastern coast of Africa : we
see comparatively few Abyssinian types in the bird-market.
Dr. Russ says that "this bird is not rare in the trade, but
is only imported a few at a time ; as it however is neither beauti-

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
ful, nor sings, but also is unfriendly after the Sparrow fashion,
and moreover destroys other birds' nests, it hardly compensates
one to purchase it as a cage-bird ; if given its liberty it is always
necessary to keep it in an aviary with larger and more powerful
inhabitants. The pair rushes about flirting the tail in the Bird-
room, and proves itself at all times lively and restless, also very
daring. On several occasions have they started to breed and
thrown together a very coarse nest in almost any hollow or in a
large Weaver's nest, the cup formed of blades of grass, cotton-
wool and feathers. Surprising to relate, it has never been
extended to egg-laying : otherwise it might have been as easy to
breed as Swainson's Sparrow ,;s . As however I just then had
many Ornamental finches in the Birdroom, I took out the spite-
ful Throat-sparrows very soon, and am of opinion that a study of
the nidification was not delayed thereby. To my knowledge
nobody else has bred the bird, and there is nothing to be found
in literature respecting the nidification when at liberty."
It would seem therefore that I am the first bird-student
who has seen the eggs of this little Sparrow.
In the British Museum there is an example of P. dentata
showing the two white wing-bands : this I take to be the im-
mature form of the species. It seems probable that the white
tips to the lesser and median coverts point to an ancestral
character, still retained in the first plumage of this species.
A FINE COLLECTION OF PARRAKEETS.
Through the courtesy of our member Mr. W. B&apos;asey, I
recently had the pleasure of inspecting his very fine collection
of Parrakeets at Suaresbrook ; and, as I could not persuade him
to write an account of his birds for our Magazine, he has
allowed me to tell our members of what I saw.
* It is quite possible that all the eggs were dropped on the sand,
smashed, and overlooked from the fact that Dr. Russ fully expected them
to be white.

Mr. Fasey believes in giving each pair of birds a separate
aviary where possible, and there is not the slightest doubt that
most Parrakeets are much more likely to breed successfully
when thus accommodated than when a number have to share the
same place. But, as there are nearly eighty birds, representing
some thirty-two species in this collection, it is quite impossible
to keep each pair separately.
The first aviary we came to was a large one, consisting of
a warm building, thatched with heather (an excellent material
for insuring an even temperature), and a large grassed flight.
This aviary is well furnished with nesting-logs and boxes, and
contains a rare assortment of Parrakeets :-- Pennant's, Mealy-
and Red-Rosellas, Kings, Crimson-wings, Rockpeplars, Red-
rumps, Barnard's, Yellow-naped, Javan, Blossom-headed, and All-
green Parrakeets ; Swaiuson's. Musky, Scaly-breasted, and Ornate
Lorikeets; Patagonian, White-eared, and other Conures. I was
shown three young Rosellas in one nest, and another contained a
clutch of Redrump's eggs. A cock Pennant was busily feeding a
hen Mealy-Rosella, and a cock Barnard was evidently paired to a
hen Yellow-naped. Mr. Fasey has since written to say that the
Yellow-nape is sitting on four eggs.*
Although this aviary contains such a mixed collection, the
birds seem to agree fairly well together, but, naturally breeding
results are not so good as they might be if there were fewer
birds.
Mr. Fasey has followed the advice that is invariably given
by dealers, as to the feeding of Lorikeets, and confines them to
seed ; and I must admit that a pair of Muskies looked remarkably
well on it. Nevertheless, I cannot be persuaded that this is the
correct food for this honey-eating family.
On leaving the large aviary we passed a range of some
half-dozen small aviaries in the course of construction, which,
when finished, will each be tenanted by a pair of Parrakeets.
Then we looked at a small aviary containing a pair of Coekatiels
Mr. Fasey now writes that the eggs are hatched (June 18).

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
with young. Further on, we come to the most important col-
lection of all. Here was a range of some eight or nine aviaries,
most of which contained but one pair of birds. In the first
was a most interesting family of Many-colours ( Psephotus vmlti-
color), a pair, with three young ones, just out of the nest.
The Rev. C. D. Farrar reared one young bird of this
species in Yorkshire last year, but I believe no others have been
reared until these three. At the time of my visit, however, three
tiny balls of fluff occupied a nest-box in my own aviary, and
these are now developing into three fine Many-colours, so Mr.
Fasey's are not the only young birds of this very lovely species
bred in England this year. Last year Mr. Fasey's birds hatched
two young ones before Mr. Farrar's celebrated medal-winner
was hatched, but the excessive cold of May killed them.
We looked long and lovingly at these three little beauties ;
two showing distinctly that they belonged to the masculine
gender, by a faint yellowish tinge on the wings, and an indica-
tion of green on the face. The third was an undoubted hen.
The fact of the sexes of the young being easily distinguishable
at so tender an age is a great point in this bird's favour as an
aviary bird, if indeed it has not already enough good points to
recommend it. Mr. Fasey and I quite agreed that there could
hardly be a Parrakeet more charming in every way than this.
In the next compartment was a nice pair of Blue Bonnets
(.Psephotus xanthorrhous ), which had been scraping about a
good deal in their nest-box, with a view, let us hope, to a
family.
Three beautiful Turquoisines (Neofihema pulchella), a cock
and two hens, were in the next aviary. Why is this Parrakeet so
seldom seen now-a-days? With the Turquoisines was a cock
Stanley, or Yellow-cheeked Parrakeet ( Platycercus icterotis), a
rare and extremely beautiful species from Western Australia.
Then we came to the gems of the collection, in the form
of a pair of the exquisite Golden-shouldered Parrakeet
(.Psephotus chrysopterygius), a species about which nothing had
been heard for fort}&apos;- years until a few turned up in the flesh
some six years ago.

Mr. Fasey may consider himself extremely fortunate to
have secured this pair, the male from one of our members, and
the female from another, the latter, by the way, being one of the
original consignment of some six years ago, though she still
looks as young and beautiful as ever. It is too late, I fear, to
hope for a nest from this pair this year, as they have commenced
to moult, but, with luck and care, there should be a very good
chance of a brood next spring.
In the next compartment were some immature Pennants,
and next to these a Barraband and two Rock Peplers. Then we
came to a fine pair of Yellow-rumps (Platycercusflaveolus ), whose
nest-box contained one egg. I am glad to hear that, since uiy visit,
three more have been laid, and the hen is sitting well. I think I
am right in saying that if this bird brings up a brood it will be
the first instance of young being reared by this species in Great
Britain.*
A pair of New Zealands ( Cyanorhamphus nov&lt;z-zealandi&lt;z)
came next, and the last compartment contained a pair of
Brown's ( Platycercus broivni), which had but recently arrived.
Mr. Fasey expects, very shortly, to add a pair of Golden-
crowned Parrakeets ( Cyanorhamphus ciuriceps ) to his collection,
which is undoubtedly one of the finest owned by a private
individual in the country.
I wish I could persuade Mr. Fasey to thrash out the
origin of Count Salvadori's Platycercus erythropeplus, the so-
called Red-mantled Parrakeet. It is intermediate between
the Pennant and the Rosella, and its habitat is unknown ; it
seems most probable that it is nothing more nor less than a
hybrid between the two, though this can only be proved by
experiment, which should not be a difficult matter with Mr.
Fasey's fine series.

was told they were brought from Africa, and that they are Weavers.
They are larger than the usual Weavers, with longish black beaks, the

upper mandible slightly curved at the end. Head and neck grey, shoulders
wings and rump reddish brown, breast light grey fading into white on
the belly and under parts. The tail is dark brown, so are the flights,
each feather being almost black in the centre and of a lighter brown at
the edge. The under part of the wings is also brown but of a lighter
shade. The cheeks are of a darker grey than the rest of the head,
and give the impression that if the bird were in full colour it mi ght
have a black mask (but I do not know whether it is in full colour or
not). Eyes dark and bright, legs stout and strong and of a flesh colour.
It is a lively&apos; restless bird, and often hangs down from its perch. There
is a slight white band across the wings which does not always show.
At the International Bird Show now being held here (Florence) I have
called it Nigrita arnaudi, and it has been accepted under that name ;
but never having seen the bird lam not at all sure of being right, nor am I
sure of its being a Weaver. I have not yet heard its voice. It eats seed,
but I should think it probable that it likes fruit, or at least berries, for it
rushed at some maize--which however it found too hard to peck. It is
about the size of a large Greenfinch. Giur.iA Tommasi.
The following reply was sent to the Contessa Baldelli :
I must confess that your description of the pair of Weavers has
puzzled me completely.
If the birds are the size of a large Greenfinch, and if the breast is
light grey fading behind into white, I do not see how they can be Philceterus
(Nigrita) arnaudi; because the latter is i |inches shorter than an ordinary
Greenfinch, and has drab-brown underparts.
I11 most respects your description seems more nearly to correspond
with Ploceipasser rujoscapulatus, wdiich is only 2-ioths larger than an
ordinary Greenfinch; and though that bird is said to have the " bill and
feet horn-colour," it is quite likely that the colouring of these parts was
taken from a dead specimen, and had long before faded.
P. arnaudi, on the upper surface, is mostly light " drab-brown " ;
P. rufoscapu talus " rufous-chocolate," which seems to answer better to the
reddish brown of your description.
The only serious discrepancy seems to be in the colouring of the tail,
which you describe as dark brown with blackish shaft-streaks, whereas in
P. rujoscapulatus it is described as uniform light brown ; but, as the species
seems to have been described from a unique male, this might be due to
discoloration.
If your bird is a Weaver, I see nothing else for it; but it seems
hardly possible that so rare a species should turn up as a cage-bird. The
trick of hanging downward from the perch is peculiar; it is a common
amusement among Hangnests and some of the Troupials, but I have not

clinging to the wires of an aviary. A. G. Butler.
LOVEBIRDS, ETC., FOR COLD GREENHOUSE.
Sir, -- I would be very pleased if you could tell me if Madagascar
Lovebirds, Nuns, Java Sparrows and Cutthroats would live in a greenhouse
without steam heating all winter, we have very little snow or frost ? Could
you also tell me of some other small birds that would live in cages in the
unheated greenhouse? Wiei.ie H. Workman.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Workman :
In times past I have kept all the birds you mention in a covered
aviary, one side of which was only protected from the open air by a canvas
screen : the aviary at that time was unlieated, and the thermometer in the
winter frequently registered a few degrees of frost (on one occasion as many
as twenty-one degrees): I lost very few birds from cold, and those that did
die from that cause were chiefly British birds.
In a greenhouse the cold would not be so great as in my aviary as it
then was, therefore doubtless the same birds would live ; whether they
would enjoy their life is another matter : as I concluded that it was hardly
fair to subject birds from warm climates to a temperature which was
painful to myself, I filled in the open side of my aviary and introduced a
radiator : the result is that if my birds desire to breed in the winter, fewer
suffer from egg-binding.
The Weavers, the Common and Green Amaduvade Waxbills, the
Parson-finch, (and probably&apos; the Long-tailed Grassfincli) are not susceptible
to cold, though I suspect they all prefer warmth.

HYBRID SINGING-FINCH, ETC.
Sir,--I do not know whether the following facts will be worth
recording in the Avic. Mag.
Last autumn or winter I purchased two newly&apos;-imported Singing-
finches, one a grey&apos;, the other a green. I kept them indoors until April,
tlieu I turned them out into au aviary&apos;. They soon went to nest, the Green
one being the cock, and the Grey&apos; the hen. They built a pretty&apos; little nest
of fine grass, on a foundation of fern leaves, in a Hartz cage, and laid four
eggs which all proved clear, so I removed them. The hen, in less than a
week, laid again in the same nest, without apparently altering it. She laid
three eggs, and this time two proved fertile and hatched out, but one young
one disappeared; the other they successfully reared, and it is flying about,
strong and healthy, now in the aviary&apos;. It has the marks of the Green

Cockatiels are most disheartening ; eggs never hatch although the
birds sit well. Sometimes the young are quite fully developed in the egg.

<bodyText confidence="0.997132764705882" page_id="10284428"  page_num="Page 305" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I am quite ashamed of giving you so much trouble about my
birds.
Since writing to Mr. Phillipps I have heard the note of what I
supposed was the Nigrita arnaudi. It is decidedly like the chirp of a
Sparrow, and I wonder whether they can be Swainson's Sparrows instead
of Weavers.
The birds were brought from Africa by a gentleman, who kept them
in an aviary with Red-faced Love-birds, and he considered them very rare.
After his death the bird-dealer got them, thought nothing of them, and
was glad to make them over to me. They were pronounced to be Ploceidce
by some learned gentlemen at the Show, but they are not like an}&apos; Weaver
I have ever seen, and are very like Sparrows in their ways and in their
movements and in their song. The beak is long and black and shining ;
the point of the upper mandible slightly arched and projecting over the
under one. They peck hard if taken in the hand. The head, neck, and
breast are of a soft bluish grey ; a patch of darker grey round the eyes; the
bend of the wings and rump are of a reddish brown, like the brown of the
Black-headed Nun; the flight feathers and tail are dark brown with light
edges; across the wings is an indistinct white bar which only shews
occasionally when the feathers are ruffled.
If they turn out to be Sparrows of some kind could you tell me what
their character is, and whether they can be trusted in a mixed aviary ?
Also I would like to know what their food ought to be. I was told millet and
canary seed ; but one of them has got very thin, and turns up the seed and
seems to miss something necessary. I have tried bread and milk, but they
do not care for it; egg they will not touch; cherries and dried figs they
seem to relish, and they are very keen on mealworms, but I dare not give
more than two or three per day. They eat salad, and pounced 011 some
bullock's heart but did not swallow it. They are often nibbling at the
cuttle-fish bone, and pick up sand and old mortar on the bottom of the
cage.
I should like to know the difference between the Golden Sparrow and
Passer luteus. Those I have are bright yellow with brown wings, the hens
being of a yellowish grey : and I do not know which of the two they are.

I have become lately the possessor of a pretty Ccereba cyanea, which
is fed on sugared milksop. It has lived on this food and on what flies it
can catch for nearly three years. Could I give it very ripe oranges and figs
or grapes in their season ? Bananas I do not think are good here.
I am anxious about a Macaw which has got very thin without anj'&apos;
apparent symptom of disease, and has lost its appetite. I am inclined to
think jealousy is partly the cause, for it dotes on my maid, and wants more
attention and petting than the girl can give it; still at times it ruffles the
feathers on its head and moans just as if its head ached. I have removed
it into another room to give it a change, and am trying different seeds,
biscuits, potatoes, and fruit to induce it to eat.
My numerous birds give me plenty to do.
Giui.ia Tommasi Baedeeei.
The following reply has been sent to the Contessa Baldelli:
I have little doubt that you are correct in your identification of the
supposed Weaver with the Passer swainsoni of the British Museum
Catalogue, but which Capt. Shelley in his ' Birds of Africa ' says he is
unable to separate from Passer dijfusus, the well-known Grey-headed
Sparrow of Africa.
I had a specimen of this species (I think a hen) for five or six years,
and wrote a short paper upon it in the second volume of our Magazine;
but, in case you do not possess that volume, I may say that I kept it with
African Weavers, because Dr. Russ states that it is spiteful towards smaller
associates. My bird had access to oats and hemp, in addition to millet and
canary.
Passer luteus has a deep cinnamon back; but Passer euchlorus (the
'Arabian Golden Sparrow' according to Shelley) has the back canary-
yellow like the head.
I have never kept Ccereba cyanea, but should think it risky to mix up
milk and oranges: perhaps I am wrong. I do not think figs or grapes
w r ould be hurtful.

FEATHER PLUCKING, NIBBLING, AND EATING.
Sir,-- . I am not sure my Canary-winged Parrakeet
may not be going to turn over a new leaf. It seems to have left some of
the feathers on the back alone.
I wish M. Pasteur would rise up and investigate the cause of feather
eating.
Do any other birds than Parrots eat or pluck feathers ?
In Seth-Smith's extracts from other authors, I see they say the
Parrots eat the small insects on the trees.

Now there are three things :--

<listItem confidence="0.555705714285714">
1. --Feather plucking. Very rare; I have seen only one case. Probably it
was much more common sixty years ago when Parrots were less under-
stood and given meat. In that it is undoubtedly irritation from fevered
blood, and diet will cure it.
2. -- Feather nibbling. A trick like biting nails in children : quite incurable.
3. -- Feather eating. Probably from want of something in diet: could be
cured possibly if we knew what; but the bird generally dies.
It is just possible that my Canary Wings were wrongly fed or in-
sufficiently so. They seem to eat nothing but canary seed, but rather more
than would keep a Macaw going. Now they have plenty, the}- may not
want their feathers.
I fancy some breast feather plucking may have to do with nesting. I
had a Grey who always plucked her feathers before laying an egg.

The following reply ioas sent to the IFon. and Rev. Canon Dutton:
Yes, other birds besides Parrots pluck their feathers.
Many years ago, a Raven I had plucked its breast horribly. I did not
know then, but do now, that this was caused by too much solid raw meat.
Several years afterwards, a Chinese Blue-Pie (Urocissa erythrorhyncha )
we had here commenced plucking her breast very viciously ; twice she did
this, and was cured each time with fluid magnesia and more careful feeding.
She lived with us for many years afterwards (over twelve altogether) but
never repeated the plucking.
.always feeds hisTui Parrakeets on hemp seed, and every
Tui I have bought from him has eaten its breast feathers; and in every
case the bird has discontinued the habit within a few months of purchase,
the hemp being stopped, and canary and banana or cut up grapes substi-
tuted. A female I have at this moment was wretched when purchased, but
is now in faultless feather.
Speaking from memory,.feeds all his Brotogerys on
dherup ; and he had a number of Canary Wings (or rather White-winged
Parrakeets, Brotogerys virescens ) a little while back. I feel pretty certain
that your bird has been fed on hemp, and pretty confident that it will come
all right again if properly fed. Reginald Phieeipps.
THE SPARROWHAWK AND THE LONG-HORNED OWL.

fashion flew off and lit in the Sparrowliawk's tree, almost if not quite upon
the nest. The old Sparrowhawk returned, and dashed at the Owlet, dragging
it through the branches to the ground, and my man rushed in and seized
it! It is doing well on the lawn under a tree, seated on a hawk's block,
with leash and soft jesses on. W. H. St. Quintin.
CARDINAL ILL.
Sir, -- Having a cock Virginian Nightingale that is unwell I should be
much obliged if you would kindly let me know what I could do for it.
I have had it about eighteen days, during which time I have kept it in
a large cage in my outdoor aviary, and it appeared well when I got it.
It looks puffed out a bit, and stays principally on the bottom of the
cage, and keeps its wings down its sides, the feathers being spread out, and
does not eat much, only I fancy a few mealworms, and seems to have some
difficulty in swallowing, but what it passes appears fairly right.
It has not been well for about three days, but to-day it is much less
active and looks worse, so I am afraid it will not live long.
For food I have given canary, millet, ants' eggs as bought, some fruit,
such as banana, orange, and apple, about three mealworms daily varied by
cockroaches, also occasionally some white sunflower seed and a little hemp.
Nicholas S. O'Reilly.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. O&apos;Reilly.
I should think it probable that, previous to its coming into your
possession, the bird had been kept in a close warm place, and that its
exposure in an outdoor aviary during the late extremely variable weather
may have affected its lungs.
If the excreta are healthy, it is evident that the bowels are not
inflamed: on the other hand the difficulty in swallowing which you
mention indicates a probable affection of the respirator) - organs.
The feeding is correct; though I would substitute oats for hemp, as
being more easy of digestion ; and, unless the bird quickly recovers, let
it have a little egg and biscuit daily as soft food.
A purgative at the commencement of the treatment is always advis-
able, and, as it is difficult to administer castor oil to a Cardinal, I should
advise the addition of six grains of Epsom salts to the drinking-water for
one day. On the succeeding days I would put into the drinking-water 10
drops of glycerine, about an equal quantity of dissolved gum arabic, 5 drops
of solution of muriate of morphia, and S minims of tincture of digitalis.
Keep the bird indoors and out of draughts. A. G. Butler.

Dr. Butler would kiudlv give her some advice about a Virginian
Nightingale (scarlet). It has lived on the Riviera some years and is not at
all young. It moulted well in February. It had not been specially suitably
fed ere Miss Hammond received him as a present, and she gave him one
or two mealworms a day, and he sings most beautifully, which he had not
done for a year or two. She brought him to England some six weeks ago,
and he had not been here a fortnight before he went into moult again,
skin very white. He seems only to have moulted on his head, otherwise
he seems to be in perfect health and spirits [and song. His food now is
Abrahams' food, canary seed, fruit, and millet branch. Is this right
feeding? He bathes freely--but his head is almost bare of feathers.
The Jollowing reply has been sent to the Hon. Katherine Hammond :
There is no doubt that the Cardinal which you have is suffering from
what is known as "surfeit," a disease which is due to incorrect feeding,
and which invariably results in the untimely loss of feathers from the
head.
The cure for this, in a bird the size of a Virginian Cardinal, would be
to give, for one day, six grains of Epsom salts and an equal quantity of
chlorate of potash, in the drinking water ; to let the bird have plenty of
fresh green food (chickweed and groundsel for preference), and the proper
food. Anoint the bare part of the head with vaseline.
Your feeding would, I think, be improved by the addition of
whole oats and sunflower seeds. I would not recommend you to add
maize and hemp-seed (as recommended in my little book--" Foreign Bird
Keeping"), because both are somewhat heating for a bird with an unhealthy
skin.
It is important that Virginian Cardinals should not be subjected to
great heat; as, if kept too warm, they are liable to apoplexy. A cool shady
room, or an outdoor aviary, suits them best.
A. G. Butler.
THE SEX OF PEKIN NIGHTINGALES.
Sir,--I cannot agree with Dr. Butler's opinion that the sexual
differences in the colouring of Pekin Nightingales " are so slight."
The truth is that the males of this species are nowadays extremely
scarce in England. Quantities of these birds are imported by the large
dealers, but they are not infrequently all females! I have purchased so-
called pairs from two noted bird-dealers (one in London and one elsewhere)
everyone of which were hen birds, and in wretched condition too! Amongst
perhaps fifty to a hundred hen birds, supposing one is choosing them in the
shop, there are naturally some individuals that are brighter in colouring
than others, and these (at first sight) one is apt to select as males, and the
duller coloured birds as females.

some pairs in a dealer's shop in East Loudon. There was a very great
difference between those two male birds and the large number of Pekin
Nightingales which I had seen an hour before; one realized then that one
had been looking at a lot of females. Mr. Hawkins at once admitted that
he had obtained those two males with difficulty, and that for some unknown
reason only females had for some time past arrived in the English market.
I have lately seen many Pekin Nightingales in bird-shops in Genoa
and Florence, where the males were predominant. I picked out two or
three genuine pairs with hardly any hesitation. I admit that if the birds
are not in good condition and plumage, it is much more difficult, or may I
say, less easy to do so; but all these birds were more or less in very fair
condition. The males are a much lighter olive green on the head, the dark
line running from the corners of the mouth is more pronounced (consider-
ably more so), the yellow throat is much more brilliant, whilst the orange
of the fore neck extends farther and is much richer and deeper in colour.
If a male and female are put together in a cage, both in good plumage, I
believe that even people quite unused to them would pick out the sexes.
And then again the bill of the male is a brighter red than his mate's.
To go into further comparisons, I may say that where, in the male
bird, the deeper sunset orange of the fore neck is sharply defined beneath
the yellow throat, in the female the paler yellow throat continues over the
foreueck and fades away into the dull olive coloured breast. In the female
also, the pale yellowish feathers (which in the male, sharply divide the olive
green of the head from the dark lines that run from the corners of the
mouth) are very much less definite and more washed out. When a pair of
Pekin Nightingales are seated side by side, the breast colouring in each
bird is most distinct.
Other details which can be detected but which are less evident, such
as a larger head and eye in the male, need not be so closely dwelt upon. Of
course I am speaking of adult birds.
What Dr. Butler writes as to the voice test in selecting a male and
female is ver\&apos; true.
As a rule if a male bird is picked out from a number of others and
placed in a cage by himself, where he cannot see his companions, he will
very quickly begin calling and even singing.
The female merely chatters, whereas the call note of the male is far
more melodious. H. D. Asxr.iCY.
Sir, --In reply to Mr. Astle}&apos;, I frankly admit that the distinctions
which he points out (and which the late Mr. Abrahams relied upon) exist
between males and some females of the Pekin Nightingale : but, unhappily,

both types occur in the female sex, so that a brightly coloured hen when
seen beside a typical cock differs only very slightly in size and in contour of
the bill.
Among three dozen hens which I bought some years ago, hoping to
get a fair percentage of cocks, the colour differences, had they been
constant, would have been ample to distinguish several well-marked
species ; in two examples the throat was quite white. I have females now
which answer to Mr. Astley's description of both sexes.

The Annual Meeting of the Council was held at the house of the
Honorary Editor on the 13th June, and important business was transacted,
various alterations being made in the Rules, bringing them up to date and
more into accordance with the general advance and extension of the
Societ} 7 , all with the view of strengthening the Society and preparing it for
steady and good sound work in the future. The Rules, as revised, are
given below.
The Correspondence Secretary.
The nomination of Dr. Butler to the new post of Correspondence
Secretary was confirmed with acclamation (see p. iii. of cover of the June
Magazine).
Rude 5.--The Entrance Fee.
It is felt that it is unjust and unfair to old and faithful Members that
new comers should be able to profit by and enjoy the fruits of their labours
by the payment of such a paltry sum as 2/6. After September next, new
Members, including all who do not subscribe for the current year, will have
to pay an Entrance Fee of 10/6.
Rude 7.--Non-Payment of Subscriptions.
The attention of Members is especially drawn to Rule 7 as revised.
In future, no Magazine will be forwarded to any Member until the annual
subscription shall have been paid. In deciding upon this important step,
which indeed has been forced upon the Council b} 7 the Members them-
selves, and in thus placing the matter upon a proper business-like footing,
the Council is but following the lead of practically every well established
and important Society in the country.
Ruee 9.--The Eeection of Officers.
The old Rule 8 has been entirely remodelled. As regards the
Council, as no election has taken place for two years, it has been decided
that an election shall take place this autumn. The names of new
candidates, duly seconded, must reach the hands of the Business Secretary
before the 10th of September; and present Members of the Council,

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. No
replies can be sent by post.
Pint aided Nonpareil. (Mr. N. S. O'Reilly). Turned into a small aviary
with pair Bull-finches and Bicheno-finches ; found it dead shortly after.
[Concussion of brain due to direct injury to the skull].
Pair Cordon Bleus. (Capt. B. Horsbrugh). Bought last week, turned
into greenhouse, not exposed to open air ; both died to-day. [Both
birds died of pneumonia].
White-throated Finch and Goldfinch. (Mr. H. D. Panton). 1st
Suddenly became very puffy and gasping for breath. [Acute pneu-
monia], 2nd In song day of death, but seeming too fat I transferred
it to a larger cage; it immediately began to pant for breath, and began
to swell with tympany. I pricked skin in three places, and fearing fit,
put it in cold water. It died same evening. [Ruptured blood vessel
on brain ; bird died of pressure on brain caused by blood clot. Tym-
panic condition I cannot account for; pricking skin was useless, and
putting body into cold water unless head was also immersed 111 ight
have caused the rupture of the blood vessel. Do not experiment on
such delicate little creatures, is my advice to you and others : many a
bird is killed by anxiety to do good when the bird might recover by
itself]. _
ROSELLA Parrakeet. (Miss Alderson). Seemed in perfect health until
day of death; had three fits. Could I have done anything for him?
[Death was due to apoplexy. A smart aperient is about the best thing
to be done if one is suspicious of apoplexy, but am afraid there are
usually no premonitory symptoms].
Grey Hen, a; Nutcracker, b. (Mr. W. H. St. Quintin). a Seemed
quite well until early in the winter, when I lost another of the same
brood from fits. The bird now sent seemed heavy and dull. I removed
her, carefully fed her with a variety of food but no maize. Found her
gasping a day or two ago ; when I caught her up she had a fit and died.
[The bird was very fat, there being liver disease of some time standing,
and recent inflammation of both lungs no doubt causing the gasping.
Being in such a weak condition from the diseases mentioned, the
excitement of catching up caused heart failure, which was the

immediate cause of death. I should certainly advise keeping the
other birds on diet less nutritious for a while]. B Seemed ill on
Sunday. I caught it up, but it died in another aviary the same day.
[Acute inflammation of the liver caused death. The post-mortem
appearances you describe were identical with the one I examined : this
condition may be caused by either too stimulating a diet, or chill].
Gouldian Finch, a; Shamah, b. (Lady Louisa Feilding). a Apparently
well on Saturday, very mopey on Sunday, found dead on Monday.
[Was much emaciated. Enteritis was cause of death. It was a cock].
b Apparently well on Tuesday evening, found dead on Wednesday
morning. Been in outdoor aviary some weeks with Budgerigars, other
small birds, and a Red-vented Bulbul. [Bird died of shock caused by
external injuries at the back of the head. The Red-vented Bulbul is,
I should say, the culprit. I have proved them to be dangerous and
very uncertain companions for smaller birds].
Virginian Nightingale, lieu (Mr. N. S. O'Reilly). In my possession
nearly two weeks: appeared well until yesterday, when it seemed
mopey; this morning I found it dead. [It was rather relaxed.
Inflammation of the bowels caused death].
Violet Tanager, lien. (Miss M. Wilde). Was flying about yesterday in
our bird-room apparently quite well. They had built a nest, and were
fed on fruit, Abrahams' insect food, etc. [Bird was excessively fat.
Inflammation of right lobe of liver; but immediate cause of death was
apoplexj&apos;]. _
Virginian NiGhtingalk, cock. (Mr. N. S. O'Reilly). In my possession 19
days, shewed symptoms of dullness only three days ago; fed on canary,
millet, ants' eggs, banana, orange, apple, mealworms, sunflower-seed,
and a little hemp. [Your bird died of apoplexy, and I think your
food was too stimulating for him. I know these birds are fed on a
large proportion of insect food, sunflower-seed, and hemp. I have
never lost one although I have had many, and have fed only on canary,
millet, hemp, and fruit. They of course catch a few insects out of
doors. _
Bullfinch. (The Duchess of Bedford). [Cause of death was exhaustion
from want of food. The feeder being accidentally turned round was
most unfortunate, but there was not a trace of food in the body].
Budgerigar. (Miss Appleton). Bird found dead in nest on four eggs.
[Death was due to inflammation of the bowels caused by constipation].

The genus Turnix, which appears to occupy a position
between the true Gallinaceous birds and the Rails, comprises
about twenty species, popularly known as " Hemipodes,"
" Bustard-Quails," or " Button-Quails." They range from Spain
and Sicily, through Africa, Madagascar, the Indian Archipelago,
China and Australia.
The Hemipodes are characterized by the entire absence of
a hind toe, and by the female being, in most cases at least,
decidedly larger and more brightly coloured than the male ;
and it is from a comparison of the females , not the males, that
specific distinction can be ascertained.
As regards the nesting habits of these small birds, very
little has been observed in a wild state, but it has been supposed,
and in the case of one species at least, proved, that the incuba-
tion is performed by the male.
Regarding the one species whose nesting habits have been
observed--the Black-tliroated, or Common Bustard-Quail (T.
taigoor), Mr. Hume gives the following very interesting
notes:--
" The most remarkable point in the life history of these
Bustard-Quails is the extraordinary fashion in which amongst

them the position of the sexes is reversed. The females are the
larger and handsomer birds. The females only call, the females
only fight--natives say that they fight for the males, and probably
this is true. What is certain is that, whereas in the case of
almost all the other Game Birds it is the males alone that can be
caught in spring cages, etc., to which they are attracted by the
calls of other males, and to which they come in view to fighting, in
this species no male will ever come to a cage bated with a male,
whereas every female within hearing rushes to a cage in which a
female is confined, and if allowed to meet during the breeding-
season, any two females will fight until one or other is dead, or
nearly so.
"The males, and the males only, as we have now proved
in numberless cases, sit upon the eggs, the females meanwhile
larking about, calling and fighting, without any care for their
obedient mates; and lastly, the males, and the males only, I
believe, tend and are to be flushed along with the young
brood.
"Almost throughout the higher sections of the animal
kingdom you have the males fighting for the females, the females
caring for the young; here, in one insignificant little group of
tiny birds, you have the ladies fighting duels to preserve the
chastity of their husbands, and these latter sitting meekly in
the nursery and tending the young."
I was very&amp;quot; glad indeed to see, in a well-known bird-
dealer's shop, in October last, a cage containing several Bustard-
Quails ; for it is very rare for any species of Tumix to be
imported alive into this country. The consignment referred to
consisted, for the most part, of Turnix dussut?iieri, the Tittle
Bustard- or Button-Quail; but I noticed also two fine females
and one male of the rarer and more handsome T. tanki ,--the
Greater Button-Quail, or Indian Bustard-Quail. There were
also two males of the Black-tliroated or Common Bustard-Quail,
Tur?iix taigoor. I left the shop with the three examples of T.
tanki , a pair of T. dussumieti, and a single male of T. taigoor.
T. tanki is certainly the rarest as well as the most handsome of
the three species; it has been represented in the Zoological

presented by Mr. E. W. Harper in 1901, which unfortunately
lived but a very short time.&amp;quot; 5
Iu a wild state it occurs throughout " the Peninsula of
India, and east of the Bay of Bengal as far south as Tippera."
( Ogilvie- Grant).
It is from observations I have made of my examples of
this species that I am about to set down a few notes that may,
I hope, be of interest and value to those who study this extra-
ordinary and little-understood group of birds.
Mr. Ogilvie-Graut, of the British Museum (Natural
History), is undoubtedly the first authority of the present day on
the Game-birds, and he is the author of a most able monograph
of the genus Turnix, which was published in the Ibis of 1889 (po.
446-475). One of the conclusions he has arrived at however in
studying this group is, that the characteristic adornments of the
females, such as black throats (as in T. taigoor) and rufous nuchal
collars (as in T. tanki), " are not seasonal or nuptial plumages,
as supposed by some authors, but denote maturity, and are
found at all seasons in fully adult females."
It will be seen from the coloured illustration that appears
with this, that in Turnix tanki the rufous nuchal collar is a very
well-marked feature of the female, and my two examples of this
sex, when obtained on the 24th of October last, were in perfectly
full colour. However, as the winter approached they com-
menced to moult, and the collar was completely lost, the plumage
becoming appaVently similar to that of the male, though I did not
handle the birds to examine them minutely. The two females
at this time exactly resembled some specimens in the series at
the Museum which are labelled "immature," but which, I am
now led to suppose, are really adults in winter plumage. Another
fact which tends to prove this conclusion to be correct is, that a
young female, whose history I am about to relate, has developed
a perfect rufous nuchal collar at the age of six weeks.
Siuce the above was written two more females of T. tanki have been received by the
above-mentioned dealer.

In March the females gradually regained their rufous
collars, and, at the same time, became rather spiteful towards
one another, and had to be separated, one being placed with the
male, in an aviary about twenty feet long by ten feet wide, in
which a temperature approaching 6o* Fahr. was maintained.
The pair, as a rule, kept fairly close together, but other-
wise appeared to take very little notice of one another. As the
days lengthened they seemed to become somewhat interested in a
certain corner, the warmest place in the aviary, close to the
boiler connected with the hot-water pipes, and just by the door,--
perhaps the worst place they could select for a nest, as it was
impossible to enter the aviary without disturbing the sitting
bird. The hen would sometimes squat in this corner with her
breast on the ground and her tail pointing upwards, and made a
peculiar soft clucking noise. The cock would then go and take
his turn in the same corner, the hen having moved out. At
this time the lieu would often be seen standing rocking her body
backwards and forwards in a peculiar manner, but I saw nothing
approaching actual nuptial display by either sex, in fact they
seemed to regard one another almost with indifference except
when I threw a mealworm to the hen when she would generally
(though not always by any means) hold it in her bill, and
stretching out her body, remain motionless, glancing sideways
at the male, until he ran up and took it. Probably she actually
called him, but I could detect no sound. At any rate, she
presented tit-bits to him in precisely the same way as he, later
on, presented food to his chicks.
Just as the males of other gallinaceous birds will pick up
dainty morsels and gallantly present them to their wives, here
we have a casein which the order is exactly reversed, the females
unselfishly presenting the most attractive morsels to their
husbands.
On April 24th a slight nest of hay was observed in the
above-mentioned corner, and on the following day I discovered
one egg in the nest. On the 27th a second egg was laid, and a
third on the 28th, on which day the male commenced to sit, and,
although the nest was in a perfectly open place, and I was

obliged to disturb liim each morning as I went to feed the birds,
he continued Ids task in a most praiseworthy manner and, on
May iotli, hatched all three eggs, incubation having been
completed in the incredibly short space of tzvelve days.
Here is surely another fact which stamps this genus as one
of the most remarkable in the avian kingdom; that young, as
well developed in every way as those of the true Quails and
other Game-birds should be produced in about half the time
that those birds occupy in incubation. The Painted Quails
(. Excaljactoria ), be it remembered, take 21 or 22 days to hatch,
and yet they are about equal in size to, and their young are no
better developed at birth than those of, the birds now under
notice.
From the day she laid her third egg the female appeared to
take no notice whatever of the nest, and even when the young
were hatched, apparently ignored the presence of both her mate
and offspring. In fact I found that she ate most of the food that
was provided for the chicks and so shut her in a separate place.
The little cock took the greatest care of his charges,
brooding them most tenderly, and attacking any living creature,
including myself, that might approach them too closely. He
would pick up minute insects and hold them in his bill until the
chicks came and took them from him, and, for the first day or
two the chicks, so far as I was able to observe, never picked up
food for themselves.
The three chicks progressed favourably for the first two or
three days, but it was, unfortunately, almost impossible, so cold
had the weather been, to find a sufficient stock of the right kind
of insects, and artificial food of all kinds was rejected. Fresh
ants' eggs would have answered the purpose admirably, but
there were none to be had ; small gentles would have done,
but they were not to be obtained either. I had decided
to arrange for a stock of these, but I had put the probable
period of incubation at about three weeks, and as they arrived
in twelve days none were ready. I dug over the best part of
the garden in search of insects; I swept the hedgerows with an
entomologist's sweeping net, but, with the exception of finding a

few aphides and flies, to no effect. The consequence was that, at
the age of three days one chick died, and a second followed its
example on the following day. These two, which were admirably
mounted by Mr. Charles Thorpe, of George Street, Croydon,
have enabled Mr. Gronvold to give us the figure which appears
below. In colour they were mottled brown, but without very
distinct markings. They are now reposing in the Bird Gallery
of the Natural History Museum at South Kensington.*
Turnix tanki, 4 days ot.d. Naturae size.
On May 20th, the weather having improved, the parents
and the one surviving chick, were put into a small outside
aviary in which grass was growing, and here the youngster grew
apace. At this date its plumage presented a spotted appearance,
especially on the sides, but with the exception of the black
stripe on the head, which is clearly shown in the illustration, it
presented no very conspicuous markings. O11 May 28th the
light irides of the adults were visible, the eyes having previously
appeared perfectly black. O11 June 2nd, I noticed a distinct
reddish tinge on the nape, and as I write (June 27th) this young
bird, which is a female, is equal in size to her mother, and may
now, at nearly seven weeks old, be said to be in perfectly adult

plumage, with the rufous collar almost, though perhaps not
quite, as distinct as that of the old female.
The weather of the first half of June was so extraordinarily
wet and cold that I thought it advisable to put these birds back
into the warm aviary, especially as they never seemed to care
much for the grass. The change appeared to please them, and
they soon began to visit their old nesting-place. O11 June 20th
I noticed that a nest had been made. This, however, was
abandoned for another site near by, where, on the 22nd, I
discovered a more perfect nest composed entirely of hay, which
they must have carried some distance. On the 24th it contained
an egg, a second being laid on the 25th, and a third on the 26th.
On the 27th, the day on which I am writing, the male has
commenced to sit. I may mention that the eggs are creamy
white, spotted with innumerable buff and grey spots.
From my observation of my specimens of Turnix tanki,
as well, as a pair of T. dussumieri , I am led to the conclusion
that these birds do not care much for long grass. The difference
between these and the little Painted Quails {Excalfactoria) is very
marked in this respect ; the latter makes tunnels through the
long grass in all directions, and darts through these like
lightning when alarmed ; but the Hemipodes do not seem to be
at home in long grass, they apparently prefer the open sandy
ground, with patches of short rough grass and such like growing
here and there. They are extremely fond of dusting themselves
in the sand.
The second hen of T. tanki has been out in a large aviary
with the male T. taigoor since May, but the grass and under-
growth is so thick that I rarely see either of them.
The call-note uttered by the Hemipodes seems to be much
the same with all,--a soft booming sound which is more or less
ventriloquial. The female utters this note far more frequently
than the male, and I am not perfectly sure that he calls at all,
but I believe he does occasionally. This note may almost be
called a "coo " ; I have frequently mistaken it for the coo of the
Bronzed-winged Pigeon in the distance. Some writers have
likened it to the distant bellowing of a bull, and the Mediterranean

Mr. E. G. B. Meade-Waldo,
form, T. silvaiica, is known as "Torillo" or " little bull." The
note is absolutely unlike that of any other gallinaceous bird, so
far as I am aware.
[On the first of July I obtained a female of T. taigoor
and placed her in the large aviary with the male of this species,
and I have since, on several occasions, heard the call-note,
evidently uttered by the female only, as stated by Hume. It is
somewhat different to that of the other two species I have, being
more like a prolonged " purr ; " it might, in fact, be described as
between a "purr" ahd a "coo."
The male Turnix tanki hatched all three eggs, either in
the night of July 8tli, or very early on the morning of the 9th,
the period having been, as before, about twelve days. One of the
chicks was weak from the first and died the day after birth ; but
the other two are progressing splendidly on a diet composed
chiefly of living ants' cocoons and small gentles. When three
or four days old they were noticed to pick up small particles of
yolk of egg as well as preserved ants' eggs occasionally, but they
cannot do without live food].

All dwellers in the Southern and Eastern half of England
who are interested in ornithology and aviculture must have
suffered more or less directly from the disastrous rains of the
month ofjune. The almost unprecedented deluge that continued,
almost without intermission from the 9th to the 21st, will leave a
mark that it will take more than one good breeding season to
blot out. In addition to the heavy and continuous rains, we also
suffered from a phenomenally low temperature, culminating on
the 21st inst., when for forty-eight hours previously our maximum
temperature was 48*, our minimum 28*, and our rainfall 1*23.
The effect of this last spell of bad weather was to practically
annihilate the nests and young broods of many birds. I11 our

nest boxes at home I found numerous broods of young dead.
Whole broods of Tits starved and perished from cold. Not a
brood here and there, but some dozens ; in some cases half the
brood had flown leaving half dead in the nest. I found but one
brood of Tits gone clean away, and they were a brood of Coal
Tits in a box in a dense cedar. Nuthatches suffered in a similar
way in many cases ; the mud lining to the roof of the box had
fallen in (melted from the wet) and buried the young. I also
saw several nests of the Nuthatch in natural situations in which
the same thing had happened. I found two broods of young
Wrynecks perished : one in a box, the other in a hollow spout of
an apple tree. Young Jackdaws perished in numbers, and many
might be picked up hopping about, having left their flooded and
breeding holes before they could fly. Stock Doves also suffered
severely.
I11 two Barn Owls' nests I found but two young ones in
each, standing on the dead bodies of their brethren. These
evidently had starved owing to their parents being unable to
hunt in the continuous rain. I also picked up two fine youug
Little Owls dead from the same cause, uuder a nest in a rock,
where they must have been perfectly dry. Another brood of
four in a hollow apple tree were all drowned. Even Waterfowl
could not stand against the deluge and floods. Twenty out of
twenty-one young wild-bred Pochards on a mill pond were all
carried over the hatches and whirled away on the flood. House
Martins, of which for some reason we have an unusual number
this season, lost all their nests, scores of them having fallen
from the buildings, but they fortunately will not suffer, as they
are all hard at it again. Partridges as a crop have practically
vanished, every known sitting nest being forsaken even when on
the point of hatching, scores with the eggs " billed." In cutting
vetches and clover since the rains many old birds are found
dead on the nests, also many sitting Pheasants, but early
broods of Pheasants did not suffer, and locally, at any rate, hand-
reared Pheasants did extremely well. Our own Pheasants 011
high and very exposed ground throve wonderfully. In my aviary
a Chinese Painted Quail was drowned out of the nest, and on the
21st I lost a pair of young Pin-tailed Saudgrouse a fortnight old.

326 On the late Rains and their Effect on Bird Life.
These, whose natural home is the burning desert, had withstood
the whole deluge, and until the last fall had thriven, and I think
they really failed through the impossibility of procuring ripening
seeds of their food plants owing to the weather. The rapidity
with which the old parents console themselves and "begin again"
is extraordinary. When the hen laid her first clutch this year I took
the eggs away after they had sat on them for two days, as I felt
sure there would be no food when the young hatched, owing to
the backwardness of the season. Nevertheless she was sitting
again on a full clutch of three eggs on the eighth day after I took the
eggs. Two of these eggs hatched. On the sixth day after losing
her young ones, she was sitting again on three very fine eggs, all of
which are fertile. How is this managed! ! And if birds in an
aviary can reproduce their species so rapidly under adverse
circumstances it goes far to prove how such birds as the Peewit,
who are systematically robbed of their eggs, well maintain their
numbers in a state of nature. The Plovers moreover are not
very distantly related to the Sandgrouse. Even the Wild
Peewits were affected by this weather. A11 old Peewit brought
her young ones in amongst the farm buildings on our home-farm,
and reared her young ones amongst coops of young chickens and
ducks, after a short while taking no notice of human beings,
beyond running a short way and giving vent to a plaintive
Pee-e-wit. The young ones gave up hiding, and used to run a
short way pretending to pick up food in an unconcerned way.
Not only hole-breeding and ground-breeding birds suffered.
Whole broods of Eong-tailed Tits, ready to leave the nest,
perished, also broods of Goldcrests. Most nests of Hedge
Sparrows contained some dead young, as did also those of Green-
finches and Chaffinches.
Even the well-drained nests of the Jay were not proof
against this cruel storm. The broods are very small, mostly two
or three in place of the usual five or six. I don't suppose that
my experience of the effect of this weather 011 our wild birds is
at all singular, and it would be interesting if other aviculturists
and ornithologists who lived in the afflicted area would also give
us some account of what the effect has been in their country, and
in their open aviaries.

By A. G. Butler, Pli.D.
I should like to call attention to the apparent variability
both in the number and colouring of the eggs of the Grey and
Green Singing-finches (S. leucopygius and 5 &amp;quot;. icterus) and to
invite those members with whom these birds have gone to nest,
to give their experiences.
It is a good many years since the Grey Singing-finch first
went to nest in one of my birdroom aviaries, building a neat little
nest on the floor of a Hartz-cage, but dying on the nest before
laying its second egg : since that time no perfect nests have been
built in any of my aviaries until this year. Early in April
several attempts were made by a hen to build in a dead cypress
in my long-covered aviary, but in each case the nest was
destroyed before its completion by Zebra-finches.
In May the indefatigable hen Singing-finch tried to build
in a swinging seed-tin ; and, although nearly the whole of the
material was stolen, so that only a little pad of flue and feather
remained at the bottom of the tin, she laid three eggs thereon,
and sat for about a fortnight; she was, however, extremely
nervous ; leaving the nest whenever the aviary door was
opened : all the eggs proved to be addled.
In June a nest was successfully completed in the dead
bush before mentioned : It is a neat little deep cup-sliaped nest,
resembling that of our Reed-Warbler in shape, but more woolly
and much smaller: again three eggs were laid, the hen sitting,
but still flying nervously off on the least notice being taken
of her.*
In Shelley's Birds of Africa, Vol. III., p. 217 it is stated
that Heuglin found a nest on the Blue Nile which contained
three eggs which were pale greenish grey, spotted at the thick
end with brownish red and dusky brown.
* After sitting about a week she died and I was on the point of taking the nest to
preserve it and the eggs for my collection when I noticed the cock and a second hen
nervously approaching : on leaving the aviary she went on the eggs. My friend Mr. Seth-
Smith visited me shortly afterwards, and on looking into the nest observed two newly
hatched young : these however disappeared two or three days later, having probably
died.--A.G.B.

On Eggs of Serin-Finches.
Dr. Russ, in his account of the nidificatiou of this bird,
states that the laying consists of four to five eggs, pale blue, at
times greenish, finely speckled, and spotted with reddish or
brown. Did Dr. Russ make a note, at the time when he bred
the species, of the number and colouring of the eggs ; or did he
slightly modify Heuglin's account of the colouring, and take his
number from what is known to be most usual among Serin-
finches ? It is interesting that Heuglin's nest should have
contained three eggs only, and that both of the nests built in
my aviary this year should have been limited to that number.
In any case, it proves that the number for a normal clutch
should not be put down as "4 to 5 " ; if the higher number is
ever reached, the normal number should stand as 3 to 5 : this is
a point upon which I should like additional information.
Again, as regards the colouring of the eggs, mine have all
been pure white ; the solitary egg in my first nest being
unspotted.* I11 the two later nests the eggs have been uniform
in character, being finely spotted and speckled at the large end
with pitchy black: they remind one a little of some eggs of the
Chiff-Chaff, only they are longer ovals and the spots 011 them are
smaller. Here again I should like to hear the testimony of
other breeders.
As regards the Green Singing-fincli, I have had nests
built about five times, mostly in&apos; boxes hung upon the wires of
my aviaries: in each case I have seen the eggs while the bird
was off; and in every instance the eggs have been pure creamy-
white and immaculate, or so nearly so that, without taking them
out and examining them under a lens, no markings could be
distinguished : the}'' varied in number from four to six. I11 every
case they disappeared shortly after the completion of the clutch,
being probably eaten by the cock bird.
According to Shelley, the number of eggs of this Serin is
three to five, of a pale bluish ground-colour, sparingly spotted
towards the larger end with pale reddish brown.
Dr. Russ says that the laying consists of four eggs,
yellowish white, for the most part spotted with buff. Mr.
When partly incubated, they might assume a greyish tinge.

Catleugh, who bred the species in 1884, does not describe the
colouring, but gives the number as five.
Is it possible that captivity can make so great a difference
in the colouring of eggs as to change them from bluish, spotted
with reddish-brown, to creamy-white, sometimes spotted with
buff? I think it more probable that the eggs obtained in Africa
belonged to a different, though perhaps nearly allied, bird. In
any case the number of eggs would have to stand as 3 to 6,
not 3 to 5,
More information is required upon this head.

Mr. Seth-Smith publishes another part, from my point
of view the most interesting and valuable we have yet had. It
would be worth while to get the book for the sake of this part.
For one thing out of the four plates given two are invaluable,
one of the Red-vented Blue-bonnet, and the other of the Golden-
Shoulder. Let me confess my ignorance ! The Red-vented Blue-
bonnet is a revelation to me. I thought I knew something about
Parrots, but I did not know such a bird existed. Now I shall never
be happy till I have seen a live one. I fear that we shall be many
years before that is imported, but the other plate, that of the
Golden Shoulder is likely to be of direct use, because that bird
does come--and only rarely--the plate therefore is just one of
those that is a real " boon and a blessing" to avicultural men.
Then again, Mr. Seth-Smith gives directions by which the
unlearned can distinguish between two species so alike as
P. zonarius and P. semitorqucitus. These are just the things
which make a book of use.
The present section is entirely confined to Australian
Parrakeets of the Broad-tailed family. This is probably the
most popular section there is. Their comparative freedom from

shrieks, their beauty, their hardiness, and their readiness to
breed in confinement, all commend them to the amateur. So
ready are they to breed, that Mr. Seth-Smith's record of various
hybrids, including one so strange as that between a Rosella and
a Cockatiel, is not the least interesting part of this section.
In some of his quotations from other works, once or twice
the fact is dwelt upon that the Platycerci not only eat seeds, but
also insects. Does this help us at all to an explanation of feather-
eating. I have not so extensive an experience of Parrot-keeping
as many of our members must have, but I have only found this
trick amongst the Psephoti and in a Nymphicus. Are they seek-
ing for some substitute for insects?
I have a pair of Brotogerys tirica lately given to me, of
which one was a feather-destroyer. But as I found feathers in
the cage I think the culprit was a feather-picker and not a
feather-eater. And as the feathers are now coming, it was pro-
bably owing to wrong diet. But if Platycerci are accustomed to
some insect food, they may find the want of it.
I conclude by again saying that this section of Parrakeets
should be got by everyone who proposes to keep any of that
most charming section, the Platycercince.

ST. KIDD A. *
There are few spots in the British Islands so interesting to
the ornithologist as St. Kilda. Here the Fulmar has its head-
quarters, and its habits in the nesting season may be observed as
at no other place. The Fork-tailed Petrel too is plentiful, and a
form of the common Wren is peculiar to the Islands. Many of
the common sea-birds are here extremely abundant, and the
islands form the richest of feasts to those who delight in the
study of sea-birds in their breeding haunts.
St. Kilda and its Birds is the title of a most interesting
lecture delivered by Dr. J. Wiglesworth before the Liverpool
Biological Society, and now printed in book-form and beautifully
illustrated by photographs.

The author gives a most interesting account of the inhabi-
tants of St. Kilda, their life-history and mode of living. Of the
birds a complete list is given together with a short account of
each species. Perhaps the most interesting bird is the Fulmar
which provides the chief form of livelihood to the inhabitants.
On the 12th of August in each year the great raid on the Fulmars
begins. The young are taken in immense numbers. Their
feathers help to pay the rent, the oil extracted from them forms
the sole method of lighting possessed by the inhabitants, besides
a considerable quantity of it being sold ; and the bodies form a
valuable article of diet.

Dr. Butler, our much esteemed Honorary Correspondence
Secretary, is so very well known to our members, and the work
he has done in the cause of scientific aviculture so highly appre-
ciated, that a handbook by him giving hints on aviculture in
general is certain to meet with a good reception.
" Hints 011 Cage-birds, British and Foreign " was the title
of a series of very useful articles that appeared a short time ago
in the Feathered World , and that these should have been made
permanently useful by being republished in book form is most
satisfactoiy. The author goes thoroughly into almost every
question that is likely to confront the tyro in aviculture, and to
the latter this handbook can be most heartily recommended. It
is profusely illustrated, chief!y from photographs, some of which
are very good, while others might with advantage have been
omitted.

Waterfowl do not appear to have been studied by
aviculturists to the extent to which they deserve, seeing
how seldom they are mentioned in this Magazine; and Mr.
Finn deserves the thanks of aviculturists generally for having
placed the result of his knowledge and experience of this
attractive and beautiful family at their disposal.
This little book treats of several rare species, as well as
of all the commonly-kept forms, and their domesticated
descendants. It contains numerous illustrations, mostly by Mr.
Lydon in his well-known style, but a few are direct reproductions
from photographs, and two of these (on pp. 25 and 29) are

GREY PARROT BITING ITS FEATHERS.

Sir, -- I am anxious to obtain advice about my African Grey Parrot
which I have had more than six years, during which time lie has had
perfect health in every wa)\ Last Wednesday afternoon he suddenly
commenced plucking his plumage. He does not pull his feathers out but
bites the tips off and throws them down on to the bottom of the cage. He
has completely ruined his plumage and looks dreadfully rough. He always
looked so beautiful before. I feed him on ordinary parrot food and boiled
Indian corn as directed by the lady from whom I bought him. I gave him
old reels of cotton and a stone to play with and bite, but nothing stops him
biting his feathers. I should be much obliged if you could let me know of
any remedy for this habit. Perhaps he has got insects and you might
inform me what to do with him in that case.
Walter Burton.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Burton :
I believe the only effective cure for feather-plucking in parrots,
would be to turn them loose in a large outdoor aviary : but au aviary for a
Grey Parrot would have to be as strongly built as the Monkev-cages at the
Zoological Gardens.
There is not the least doubt that the cause of your bird ruining its
plumage is, that it has been improperly fed for more than six years. If it
had not been a very healthy and vigorous bird, feather-plucking would
have been resorted to years ago : it is the invariable result of using so-
called " Parrot-food," sooner or later.

If you examine the seeds, you will probably find hard maize, chillies,
monkey nuts, prairie-grass, pumpkin, marrow or melon-seed (which
perhaps may be almost as nutritious as cardboard), red-millet (I believe
generally used for Game-birds), and dirt.
As a Grey Parrot ought to have wheat, dari, hemp, and canary, with
plain dry biscuit, and fruit; walnuts, crack-nuts, or green peas when in
season ; it will be evident to you how suitable such a hap-hazard collection
of seeds as is usually sold under the all-embracing name of "Parrot food"
must be. I know that it is a cause of disease and death to many hundreds
of parrots and parrakeets yearly ; but the name sells it.

BRAZILIAN HANGNEST.
Sir, -- I am wanting to try a Brazilian Hangnest, but am doubtful
about where I could keep it. If loose in the birdroom would it be likely
to interfere with a Shamali, or a Violet Tanager, who are loose at times;
or would it be safe in an outdoor aviary, 12ft. by joft., with a Mocking Bird
and other birds, the smallest being Pintailed Wliydahs ; or in an indoor
aviary 6ft. by 4ft., with a pair of Alexandrine Rock Parrakeets ? I should
prefer the bird room, if possible, with a cage of its own, but not unless it
could be let loose in the room in the day time. R. H. WilmoT.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Wilinot.
I am afraid the safest thing for a Hangnest is a large flight cage and
solitary confinement. It might do with the Mocking bird; though if it
came to a fight, I think there can be little doubt that the larger bird would
go to the wall ; but with small finches like Pintailed Whvdahs, there can be
little doubt that a Hangnest would be a dangerous associate.
To put it with powerful Parrakeets would be equally dangerous for
the Hangnest. A. G. Butler.
DEMOISELLE CRANES.
Sir, --About four weeks ago one of my Demoiselle Cranes laid an egg
--I have five Cranes in a large covered aviary (all wire) in which they flv
about. As I was away from home my keeper took the egg and put it under
a large Barn-door Fowl, as well as some Muscovy Duck eggs. The hen has
been sitting as closely as possible, and she will probably hatch out presently,
and certainly before I can receive answers to the following questions in the
Avicultural Magazine, so will you kindly inform me how long incubation
lasts with these Cranes, and what I ought to feed the youngster on if it
hatches out. My birds have never laid before.

the old bird commenced to sit. The first day was spent in, or close about,
the nest. But, on the second day, the parents led the two young up a bank
on to the level part of the paddock, and commenced to fetch food (flies,
&amp;c.) to the young, which received each insect from the old bird's bill. At
this time the young bird seemed quite incapable of picking up anything off
the ground. It was not till the 12th day that I saw the young attempt to
feed themselves, and they did very little in this way till the 17th day, when
I saw them pick up for themselves a few mealworms which I threw to
them. Therefore I think it may be taken that, for a fortnight at least, your
young Crane, if hatched, will not be capable, even if food be before it, of
supplying its own wants. I should suggest that, after the first day, the hen
be turned loose with it into some sweet orchard or paddock, where there is
some long grass, and in which she may find the insects which she will
perhaps capture and hold for the young bird. Some mealworms and very
small clean earthworms might be given several times a day. The difficulty
will be to tide over the first fortnight. After that I should expect no great
difficulty. As soon as the young Crane can pick up its food, scalded
Spratt's meal, finely chopped raw meat, and yolk of egg should be given ;
and at the same time plenty of range over clean ground, where it w&apos;ill find
insects for itself. Wishing you all success. W. H. S&apos;l&apos;. Quintin.

NESTING OF THE RUBY-THROATED HUMMING BIRD.

The following cutting is from the Field of July 4th, 1903 :--" About
the middle of May last year a pair of Humming birds built their nest in a
large honeysuckle which partly covers one side of my house. The nest was
not more than 2ft. from a window much darkened by the creeper, and in
due course contained two eggs. The ruby-tliroated owners gradually lost
all shyness. During incubation the hen bird amazed us by her frequent
and prolonged absences, lasting occasionally more than an hour. On each
return the little creature would dart down at full speed, never settling on
twig or leaf but " plumping" right into her nest, and keeping her brilliant
eges fixed on those watching her. In exactly twenty-one days two young
ones, much resembling spiders, appeared. Again the prolonged absences
occurred. So far as we could judge, intervals of about two hours elapsed
before the bird's return, always at the top of her speed, and luckily for us,
invariably announcing her arrival in the very audible manner of all Hum-
ming birds. The bills of the young for two or three days looked much like
the beaks of other small birds, then they visibly lengthened from day to
day. During the feeding process the parents appeared to disgorge a tiny
pellet (honey and microscopic insects presumably), which was held in the
tips of their long curved bills and then thrust down the throats of their
young. The latter throve and soon appeared to out-grow the tiny nest,
which, by the way, was built largely of my wife's hair combings, plenti-
fully decorated with silver lichen, such as the Chaffinch uses for ornamental

Sir,--I am sorry to inform you that, on looking in the nest to-day, I
found the two young Yellow-Rumps dead. I cannot understand the cause,
the old ones looked after them well, and there was seed in their crops. On
dissection they appeared to be as healthy as possible, but very small; they
were only just dead, and about three weeks old, but they were not more
forward than other birds I have had a week old. There were also two
unfertile eggs, so I suppose the old ones are weak, although they look as
well and healthy as can be. The eggs were very small, no larger than
Redrumps. Perhaps they were disturbed when the eggs were being laid.
I hope better luck next time, they may possibly lay again this year.

YELLOW SPARROWS.
Sir,-- I have a pair of birds, the identity of which I do not know.
Will yon tell me what they are? They are about the size of Silverbills,
but I think more slender in figure; head, breast, under parts, and under
part of tail, pale yellow ; wings and tail brown with Sparrow-like markings.
The head of one more deeply shaded than the other, so I suppose
they are cock and hen. The} 7 have rather a Sparrow-like look, but they
hang on to the wires of the cage something like Tits. I expect they are
not uncommon, but I can't find them in the books.
They seem to eat very little, chiefly white millet; they do not seem
to touch the canary seed, and are not keen on spray millet, although they
eat a little of the small Indian millet.
I give Abrahams' food and a little yolk, but if they eat any 7 it is very
little. They like mealworms, but I don't know if it is right to give them.
I should be glad to know what they are and how to feed them. They are
pretty little birds, but not gay. The beak is more like the Indigo-bird I
think than any other I know. E. E. WEST.
The following reply has been sent to Miss West:
I suspect that the birds are Yellow, or Golden Sparrowsf (Passer
luteusj : you do not say whether the} 7 were received from Africa or not; but
if they are what I suppose they are natives of N. Africa.

Sir,--I n your description of Mr. Fasey's aviaries, you add that you
wish he would prove the origin of Platycercus erythropeplus. Mr.
Cocksedge, in his aviaries at Beyton, bred two fine Red-mantled Parra-
keets from a cock Pennant and a lien Red Rosella. These nested and
hatched two young ones, but they died when a few days old.
The old birds were shown at the Palace Show and awarded first prize.
They were described by Canon Dutton in the Avicultural Magazine, and
their great rarity commented upon.
They passed into my possession and I had them some time, but I
parted with them at the end of last year. I have had frequent nests of
this cross in my aviaries. This year two, but in only one case were the
eggs fertile, but the young birds (2) were killed by a weasel about two
weeks after they left the nest. Marian Johnstone.
[We are much obliged to Mrs. Johnstone for her interesting com-
munication, which proves conclusively that the so-called "Red-mantled"
Parrakeet is, as was supposed, merely a hybrid between Platycercus elegans
and P. eximius. --Ed.]

GOULDIANS.
Sir,--M ay I trouble you to kindly give me a little information re
Gouldians.
I have a Red-faced cock paired to a Black-faced lieu, and they have
been sitting on five eggs since Sunday the 21st June. When may I expect
them to hatch ?
When due to hatch, I propose giving them dried yolk-flake and
flowering grass, besides their usual seeds; is there anything better? Would
it be any advantage to scald some canary and Indian millet for them? they
eat chiefly the small Indian millet.
They are in a small cage; and the nest is in a cocoa-nut husk, and
built of grass I gave them to pick the seed off.

The following reply ?oas sent to Mr. Arthur:
When not spoilt, Gouldians ate the most simple feeders imaginable,
and seem to rear their young (from the crop) on hard seed only.
I most strongly advise you not to give egg-flake or egg in any form,
nor ants' eggs or anything of the kind. They generally like white millet;
also cuttle-bone, and a lump of rock-salt kept clean and moist. Also the
Indian and spray millet and a little canary. I should not scald any of the
seed. Keep the water-glass clean and regularly filled.
Incubation lasts about twelve days.
In a cage (but not in an aviary) the males sometimes give trouble
when the young are a few days old, wanting to go to nest again prematurely.
In the meantime, all you can do is to leave them alone and watch.
If the male should go wrong, you must be very canny, for sometimes
the female will not feed the young if the male be removed. Individual
birds (in a cage) differ as much as Canaries do ; but with all your experience
with birds generally you will be able to manage all right I suspect.
The only real difficulty with Gouldian-breediug in a cage comes when
the female is allowed to go on lay, lay&apos;, lay', until she kills herself.

THE SCARLET IBIS.
In reply to an enquiry, the Jollowing letter zoas forwarded to
Mrs. Gregory:
The Scarlet Ibis is not unduly sensitive to cold, but would not long
survive in a damp wet situation whether indoors or out.
At the London Zoological Gardens, they&apos; are now (July 4) breeding in
the great aviary&apos;. I11 the winter they are kept in the aviary opposite, which
consists of a part glass shed with a large open flight in front, and as a rule
they&apos; go in and out as they please; but they are shut up every night, and
also day and night while snow is on the ground.
They are fed on chopped plaice, whiting, shrimps, &amp;c., and must
have access to a fairly large pan of frequently renewed water.
To sum up, the Scarlet Ibis can be kept with the same protection as
that given to ordinary&apos; fowls, but the shed must be dry and free from
draughts, and should be well lighted.
Probably cats would not attack them ; the greater dangerin a country&apos;
district would be from foxes, stoats, and possibly rats.

CORDON BLEUvS NESTING.

<bodyText confidence="0.995464" page_id="10284463"  page_num="Page 338" year="" vol="">
Sir. --My Cordon Bleus have made a nest of fibre in a small pine tree in
an out-door aviary. There is one egg--possibly more--in the nest, and the
birds are sitting. I am afraid that I shall not be able to supply them with
any insects but house flies and mealworms. Both old birds are very fond
of these, but will they give them to the young birds? I have Abrahams'
food and preserved egg. and could get dried ar.ts' eggs and mealworms
from London. The nest is the shape of a small soda water bottle and is not
lined. I should be grateful for any instructions as to food.
(Mrs.) R. S. Vivian.
The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Vivian:
Dr. Russ says that Cordon Bleus should have fresh small ants'
cocoons ; or, if these cannot be obtained, they must be accustomed to
soaked ants' cocoons with egg-bread and soaked (scalded) seeds.
Years ago I repeatedly tried Waxbills and Grass-Finches with
scalded ants' eggs, and they never touched them, simply ignored them.
I should, therefore, be inclined to mix dried ants' eggs with yolk of
egg and biscuit, adding a few small mealworms and some blight from roses
if you can get that easily (we have too much of it this year).
Whatever the old birds eat they must necessarily give to the young
birds, because they feed them from the crop. Let them have plenty of
chickweed and flowering grass, which are (I believe) as important as
insect food for rearing the young. A. G. Buteer.

Sir, --Can you tell me what is the proper food for Blue-winged
Parraquets having young ones. The hen laid seven eggs and hatched six.
She began to sit when she had laid three eggs and has hardly been off
since. The first young one was hatched June 30th, and five more during
that week. The cock sat on the first young ones while the hen had the
eggs. The young ones don't thrive and four have died. The others look
thin and miserable as if they were starved. They have canary, millet,
oats, hemp, soaked bread, and soaked biscuits and egg food, and fresh
flowering grass. B. Shepherd.
The following reply was sent to Miss Shepherd:
It is very strange that the young ones should not thrive on the
liberal diet that you have been supplying them with. You might try
bread-and-milk, though it is doubtful whether this would be an improve-
ment on the soaked bread.
Mr. Cresswell bred this species in a small cage in 1896, and one young
bird was reared, chiefly on hemp seed. (See Vol. II., p. 144.)

THE BLUE THRUSH.
(. Monticol-a cyanns).
Sir, --I have brought home from Italy some Blue Rock-Thrushes,
which I hope to be able to breed next season if they live, as I have one
good hen.
They appear in good health, but have all gone bald. I know they
are subject to surfeit, and have been avoiding over-feeding, and have not
given a mealworm.
I feed with egg, bread crumbs, ants' eggs, dried flies, an odd cock-
roach and a large snail, fruit, etc. I put a little Parrish's food in the
water. I do not give them all that the}' would be willing to eat had they
the opportunity, so am puzzled how they can be suffering from surfeit,
which I understand is the cause of baldness. In Italy they feed them on
ground Indian meal*, not even cooked, and a little cheese. I changed this
food when I came home, as the meal I got in this country did not seem to
agree with them.
I lost a Pied Rock-Thrush not long ago from swollen feet and eyes ;
but when I was away from home he ate all the other birds' food.
H. B. Ratkeokne.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Rathborne :
I am very glad to hear that you have succeeded in bringing some
Blue Thrushes home.
I find a little difficulty in replying to your letter as you do not say ir
they are birds of the year or adult specimens, whether you keep them
together or separately, and whether in cages or in an outdoor aviary.
Put a little fluid maguesia occasionally into the drinking water, give
them plenty of clean water both for washing and drinking (they cannot get
on in hot weather without their bath), give them as much fresh air and
liberty as possible, feed very plainly, and see that they do not kill one
another. Are you sure they are not pecking one another's heads ?
The Pied Rock-Thrusli will live for years if carefully fed, but will
very quickly go wrong in the way you mention if given stimulating food;
but, except for fighting, I have never had a Blue Thrush go wrong (I have
had three), and have always regarded it as one of the easiest of birds to
keep.
Referring to your food, I should stop the " dried flies" altogether.

Take care also that the bread is stale, but not sour; a bird in confinement
cannot digest new bread. The ants' eggs should be mixed with soft food
before being given to the birds, so as to give them a chance of swelling; if
swallowed perfectly dry, they swell inside the bird, disarranging strong
species, and killing some of the more delicate ones. Moreover, you must
take care that the ants' eggs be clean and good.
Parrish's food is unsuitable at present. Healthy birds are better
without anything of that kind.
Give spiders, earwigs, cockroaches, woodlice, etc. (not mealworms
as long as other small creatures can be obtained), and fruit. Try also an
orange cut in halves, placed in a little earthenware (not metal) dish with the
face up.
Of course they will require protection in cold weather; and look out
for the moult.
Blue Thrushes have been and are nesting in Mr. St. Quintin's aviaries
this summer. Reginald Phieeipps.

<bodyText confidence="0.9967236" page_id="10284465"  page_num="Page 340" year="" vol="">
Sir, --With regard to the sexes of this most charming of cage-birds,
I may say that my experience in India, like Mr. Astley's in Italy, was that
in a lot containing both sexes it is easy enough to pick out the males by
the brighter colour, especially when the pairs are side by side. Here,
however, what with the paucity of males, the variability of the species, and
the disgusting state some dealers let their stock get into, it is not easy to be
certain, so that I agree with Dr. Butler that the voice test is the best.
Among a lot of about two dozen I had in Calcutta some time ago the few
with completely red bills were undoubtedly males ; but I have also seen
undoubted males with black at the base of the bill, and this does not
disappear with age. A poor, mostly out-of-conditioned lot which I picked
up in Rondon lately were nearly all clear red in the bill, but yet were
mostly hens as far as I could see. As these were simply dying off, I let
them go in the backyard of my lodgings, where there were a few trees, and,
to ni}^ delight, they proved good homers. The sickliest birds did not leave
at all, but four went off, via the trees, into the adjoining gardens, one,
which was the worst flier, coming back that night. The rest returned in a
day or two. Some more of the sickly ones died, and I sold some of the
better specimens, leaving one sore-eyed bird, which seems to have gone off
when he found himself alone. One bird came to grief by getting lost
behind some object in an outhouse where it was not found till too late, but
all the others came back regularly for days. As only one bird was able to
fly properly--most having broken flights--it says volumes for the
intelligence of the birds that they escaped cats. Sparrows did not seem to
give them any trouble, and I have seen the two species close together. As

we know Liothrix is very omnivorous, and can winter outside without heat,
I hope that this experience will encourage some one to try these charming
birds in the open -- anyone living near a London park would be well
situated for this. But he should get strong fliers and separate the sexes,
letting out the cooks one da}&apos; and hens another. A bird which, even
without proper power of flight, can run the gauntlet of cats and Sparrows,
given vegetation of a very limited kind, has possibilities which might be
made more of by people who would like to try aviculture in the open.

PROLIFIC REDRUMPS.
Sir, -- M y Redrumps hatched and reared five young ones last autumn,
all of which proved to be hens.
In April they again went to nest, and again hatched a brood of five
consisting, this time, of three cocks and two hens.
Before the young had left the nest a week the cock began to ill-treat
them and I was forced to cage him. The good little hen continued, single-
handed, to feed the five. At the end of another week they were able to
shell seed, so I removed them to a small aviary, where they have flourished
exceedingly.
The old hen soon went to nest again, laying four eggs in her log
nest and dropping one soft one on the ground.
Last Sunday, seeing the hen outside, I felt in the log and found there
only a few small pieces of broken egg-shell. Could mice have destroyed
the eggs ? A perch had fallen in such a way that they might have obtained
access to the log. The cock was then busy feeding the hen, and they
evidently mean to try again to raise a family.
I only hope that such a succession of nests will not prove too much
for the hen.

The value of good clean grit for birds in captivity is well known to
aviculturists, but it is often difficult to obtain this in its most suitable form.
Mr. Arthur Gill has brought to our notice some specially crushed
grit which he has proved to be admirably suited to the requirements of
birds in captivity; and from a careful examination of it we are convinced
that it will prove to be invaluable to aviculturists. It is manufactured by
Mr. Herbert Clarke of Bank Buildings, Erith, Kent, and is known as
" Herbert Grit." It is sold in several degrees of fineness. Extra fine grit
at 1/- for 7lbs., 2/6 for 281bs. or 8/- per cwt. A slightly coarser quality,
suitable for all but the smallest birds, is priced at 2/- for 2Slbs. or 6/- per
cwt.

The shell-grit, which is crushed into minute cubes without any sharp
edges, is extremely useful in supplying lime in a most convenient form
readily taken by the birds. We understand that this grit has been
manufactured in the coarser quality for pigeons for some time, but it is
only recently that Mr. Gill has been able to persuade the manufacturer to
crush it fine enough for the use of aviculturists; and we can heartily
recommend it to their notice.

Sir, --Towards the end of May a friend gave me some ornamental
grass, which I offered to my Gouldian Finches. They ate it with such
avidity, so very much more eagerly than they do roadside grass or chick-
weed, that I immediately jumped to the conclusion that the grass must be
setaria glauca. Mr. Wiener, however, told me this is not so : and he very
kindly found out the name for me-- Briza media. Fie said I ought to let
you know how fond the Gouldians and Parrot Finch are of this grass. I
have since discovered that the birds are all equally&amp;quot; fond of green oats (in
the ear), and now that I cannot get any more Brizamedia, I am giving them
oats instead.
I have lately added two Javan Maja-finches ( Munia ferruginosa ) to
my family. I don't know if they are a pair, they 7 are very 7 much alike, but
one makes a ceaseless little call, like a chicken who has lost its mother, and
the other makes a noise like a wheelbarrow complaining that its wheel
wants oiling. The band of brown between the black throat patch and the
black that extends to the tail is broader in one than in the other, but I
cannot see any other difference. The dealer from whom I purchased them
had only 7 four, and the other two died; they 7 w&apos;ere both males. Mine seem
perfectly well, but I have only had them a week yet. They will eat nothing
but spray millet. . D. Hamilton.

they are still fed occasionally by their parents, although they have been able
to look after themselves perfectly well for some time.

RULES.
Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. No
replies can be sent by post.
(a) Virginian Nightingale, (b) Weaver. (Lady Carnegie), a Was very
wild when turned out, and struck himself very often ; found dead next
morning, b Would not fly, but hid in corners; found him on the
second day caught in a bush head downward. [a Died of concussion
of the brain. B Was badly bruised on back of wing and breast, which
prevented flying; death was caused by shock from injuries received
possibly when hung up in bush].
Cock and hen Virginian Nightingales. (Mr. Moerschell). Both found
dead. [Apoplexy in both cases ; your feeding seems correct, unless
they eat the bulk of the hemp--in future I would not give hemp].
Cock Diamond Dove. (Miss Chawner). Looked puffy yesterday, found
dead to-day. [Acute inflammation of liver, caused probably by chill].
Grassfinch. (Captain Tweedie). Yesterday looked puffy and sat screwed
sideways on the perch and seemed to have a difficulty in swallowing.
[Bird died of enteritis ; the difficulty you refer to is often present with
many diseases of birds].

Prioniturus platurus (Vieill.).
In his "Hand-list" of Birds, Dr. Sharpe enumerates ten
species of Racket-tailed Parrots, but the subject of the coloured
plate which accompanies this, is the only one, so far as I am
aware, that has been brought alive to Europe, although I am
informed that a member of this Society is privately importing
some Racket-tails from the Philippines, which may prove to be
either P. discursus or P. luconensisP
When, in the summer of last year, a specimen of the
Racket-tailed Parrot arrived at the Zoological Gardens, the
Executive Committee of this Society decided that a drawing
should be made, and a coloured plate presented, in due course, to
the members.
At page 262 of the last volume of this journal, Mr. E. W.
Harper, who brought the first example of P. platurus to this
country, gave a very interesting account of the bird, to which
our members are referred. He fed it as he would have fed an
African Grey Parrot, namely, "on canary seed, hemp, dari, rice
in husk, and millet. It was particularly fond of canary seed.
A bit of dry biscuit, toast, or crust of bread was always relished ;
as were also fruit, such as banana or orange, and a little lettuce
now and then."
O11 arrival at the Zoological Gardens this bird was in good
condition, though the spatules of the tail had been broken off.
It would have been extremely interesting to have watched the

growth of these characteristic adornments had the bird lived to
complete a natural moult; but unfortunately it very soon
sickened and died, probably from a want of knowledge on the
part of those in charge of it, of its proper treatment. It is
greatly to be hoped that others may be brought to this country,
and possibly, when better understood, they may prove to be
less delicate than they appear at present to be.
Although the specimen above referred to was, in all pro-
bability, the first living example ever seen in the British Islands,
it was not, as at first supposed, the first of its kind to arrive in
Europe, for Herr Blaauw kept one as long ago as 188S in
Holland, a short account of which he published in our Magazine
last year (p. 277). It was an adult, with the spatulated feathers,
perfectly developed, but it was not in robust health, and lived
but a short time. " This Parrot," writes Herr Blaauw, "fed on
seeds, with the addition of stale bread soaked in milk, with
some sugar over it ; a food which I have often found very
beneficial to Parrots when in rather a poor condition."
Dr. A. B. Meyer gives the following interesting account of
this Parrot in its native island--Celebes :
" This bird flies much during the night, and can often be
heard crying 011 the wing over one's head. It feeds in the night
on the fruits of gardens and fields, and is fond of Indian corn,
rice, and fruits, like lansa, pakowa, etc. During the day-time it
is seldom to be met in the plantations, but is to be seen flying
very high and crying loud, seldom alone. It makes its nest in
hollow trees. On trees it does not move much, but sits quietly.
If one is shot down from a group, the others do not stir, but lie,
concealed by their green plumage, between the leaves, just as I
have noticed in the case of other Parrots.
"The natives of the Minahassa assert that if the ' kulli-
kulli ' is taken by surprise in the rice-fields, it becomes confused
or terrified, falls down, and then can easily be caught. This
does not appear very credible ; nevertheless it agrees with the
observation that one can be brought down by a shot out of a
group without the others moving ; perhaps these are struck by
terror, and do not know what to do. This fact has given rise to

HONEY-EATERS.
By A. J. Campbell, Melbourne.
(Author of " Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds.&amp;quot;)
The Meliphagous or Honey-eating birds of Australia are
an exceedingly numerous and varied family--there are no less
than between seventy and eighty species. Besides being naturally
graceful in form, the majority are very beautiful and amongst the
liveliest and most songful of the feathered denizens of the
bush. Seemingly they lead quite a romantic existence flitting
from flower to flower, feasting on insects and wild honey all the
day&apos;s of their life. They feed principally on the nectar of the
abundant flowers of the ubiquitous Eucalypt trees one or other
species of which blooms all the year round. Should this giant
form of vegetation (heights ranging up to 300 feet) be scarce,
then cheerful Honey-eaters fall back on the cyclindrical
flowers (called " honey-suckles ") of the Banksia trees, the star-
shaped flowers of the Leptospernmm , the bottle-brush-sliaped
blooms of the yellowish Melaleuca or flaming Callistemons, etc.,
etc., scrubs, not to mention honey laden bells of the heatli-like
Epacris and other shrubs. Indeed, some of the pretty birds
when the land, in a good season, is literally flowing with honey,
have surfeited themselves so much that they have been picked
up incapacitated under some favourite flowering tree (but please
tell it not aloud) in a state of dnmke?i?iess and that too in the
day time.
Notwithstanding this human-like weakness it would seem
a pity to confine even in a spacious aviary such feathered

Mr. A. J. Campbell,
fairies, but I have lately learnt that they take very kindly to
captivity, and I feel assured that were any of the tribe
introduced (if they have not been already) into the British Isles,
they would be amongst the most charming and attractive of the
smaller birds of the world.
My friends, Dr. and Mrs. G. Horne, and their niece Miss
Bowie of this city, possess an aviary containing twelve species of
Honey-eaters, which I propose to enumerate, giving by the way
such field notes or bush reminiscences as I possess that may
possibly be of interest. Recently I visited the aviary (a well-
sheltered structure containing living shrubs, etc.). No sooner
had I entered than two or three active little White-naped or
Lunulated Honey-eaters (Melithrcphis lunulatus) attracted by
the flowering branclilet of iron-bark Eucalyptus which I held in
my hand, flew on to it, clinging in pretty poses while ravishing
each bloom for honey. They are fine little fellows, about five
inches in length, wearing a greenish-olive coat and white under-
surface, head black, relieved with a white crescent-shaped
mark on the nape--hence the vernacular name--their dark
brown eyes are relieved by naked stripes of red over the
upper lids. They possess a plaintive half-whistling, half-sibilant
note--a familiar sound in heavy forest country. I recollect there
was something akin to an irruption of these birds in the vicinity
of Melbourne and suburbs about the season 1866, when I particu-
larly remember the so-called Cape Wattles (a variety of Acacia )
being crowded with the birds feeding amongst the flowers.
But getting back to Dr. Horne's aviary, and while still
admiring these " honey-nourished " (literal meaning of Melithrep-
tus) birds something tickled my beard which caused me to look
downward, and lo, a Spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris) was
prospecting the flowers (also a Eucalypt ) that were in the
button-hole of my coat. How deftly the dear little creature
probed each disc with its long slender bill (about an inch in
length) while glancing at me with its beautiful ruby-red eyes !
Its plumage though not gay is rich, the head and upper surface
being dark, under surface chestnut, excepting the throat, cheeks,
and chest, white, the first with a patch of brown in the centre,
deepening into black on its lower edges. Total length about 5J

inches. During flight it makes a sharp " purrt, purtt, purrt"
sound with its wings. Its call is an exceedingly high-pitched
note, oft repeated and quickly. The Spinebill is a fairly
common bird both in town and country. I have watched
Spinebills in my own garden, gathering pollen from the Chiuese-
lantern blooms ( Abutilon ). They did so on the wing, fluttering
Humming-bird-like while probing the bell-shaped flowers.
When exploring with companions an enchanting gully for water
course) in the country we discovered in the space of about
half-a-mile, three Spinebills' nests--one being prettily ensconsed
in a bunch of flowering Clematis at the top of a Mclalezica.
The nest was open, deep and warmly feathered.
Both the Spinebills and the Wliite-uaped Honey-eaters
were perfectly fearless of my presence in the aviary. Next to
approach me was the fine White-eared Honey-eater (. Ptilotis
lencotis). At first it perched on my hard hat before it summoned
up courage to join in the feast of flowers which I still held in my
hand. It is a fine, snowy, Honey-eater, about 7^ inches in
length, its black throat and otherwise aesthetic green plumage
being conspicuously set off by its white ear coverts. The
White-eared Honey-eater is somewhat wild in the open and its
nest usually built in ground scrub is hard to find. The cup-
sliaped home is lined with a thick ply of fur or hair. It is an
interesting sight to watch the busy birds plucking hair off the
backs of cattle, for nest lining. Once a friend of mine enjoyed
a comical experience. While hunting in a scrub for nests a bird
actually perched on the horse he was riding and plucked hairs
therefrom. This hair-plucking instinct is strong in the aviary
bird, for when Miss Bowie enters the bird sometimes alights
upon her bare head and pulls at her tresses.
I commenced to survey the aviary for some of the White-
cheeked cousins and detected five other species of Ptilotes. First
and foremost were three splendid Yellow-tufted Honey-eaters
( P. auricomis). But they were not so confiding as the previously
mentioned birds. However a transparent tube filled with live
house flies which Miss Bowie held in her hand was too tempting,
and one Yellow-tufted beauty came down and sampled the dusky
tit-bits. As a typical and beautiful Australian Honey-eater I

Mr. A. J. Campbell,
have suggested it as a subject of an illustration, together with a
flowering spray of the Iron-barked Eucalypt upon which it loves
to feed when in the open. As will be noticed the Yellow-tufted
Honey-eater wears a beautiful, rich, golden-tinted plumage,
especially the under surface, with a lengthened tuft of extremely
rich j^ellow feathers extending backwards from the ear. Its
total length is about seven inches. I once enjoyed a glorious
sight--about ioo of these birds under a shining sun flying
across a flat evidently in search of "fresh fields and pastures
new." Like other Honey-eaters the gay Yellow-tufted is
gregarious at times. This bird constructs a striugy-bark nest in
the pendulous branches of a Eucalypt or Acacia , laying in
common with the other members of its tribe, two or three rich
salmon-pink eggs more or less spotted with reddish-and
purplish-brown--some, the loveliest items in creation.
I fear I have not space enough to more than mention the
remaining Ptilotes --the White-plumed ( P. peuicillata&apos;), the
graceful Yellow-plumed ( P . omata), the Fuscous ( P. fusca), and
the sprightly Yellow-faced (A*, chrysops). The} r are all about the
same size--6A- inches in length--and dressed in art greens with
the distinguishing features as suggested by their respective
vernacular names. The White-plumed Honey-eater is the most
familiar about our city parks and gardens, while the Yellow-faced
cousin has perhaps the merriest song and is fond of timber-
margined streams. An oological reminiscence of the latter
bird --a lovely green, moss-made nest, containing red mottled
eggs, suspended in an acacia bush abloom with yellow, over-
hanging a moss-covered bank in a sheltered forest nook.
The two species of shy and distrustful birds of the aviary-
belonged to the genus Meliornis (from two Greek words
meaning honey-bird). First the White-bearded Honey-eater
(A/. novcc hollandice), whose showy figure may be thus described :
Head black, conspicuously marked by a stripe over each eye,
moustache and small tuft of feathers behind the ear, white ; rest
of the upper surface dark, save a patch on the wing and the
margin of the tail, which are yellow, while the under surface in
general is white striped longitudinally with black ; eyes pearly-
white ; bill and feet black ; length, seven inches.

The White-bearded Honey-eaters kept on the far side of
the aviary amongst the bushes, but in the open they are some-
what bold and cheeky. They are a common bird in the coastal
scrubs where the Banksias grow, but I have also observed them
far in the interior in the mallee scrub (a dwarf Eucalyptus].

Mr. A. J. Campbell,
They build a nest in a cosy bush, lining it with the brown,
velvety particles of Banksici cones, sometimes with soft seed-
cases of other vegetation. The other wild Melinoris was the
Crescent Honey-eater ( M. australasiana). No wonder this
splendid little fellow appeared timid, because its natural home is
the depths of the forest, especially where the thick undergrowth
flourishes in moist or swampy situations. The bird is not so gay
in appearance as its White-bearded cousin, and takes its
vernacular name (Crescent) from the black lunar-shaped mark
down each side of the breast of the male. A prettily situated
nest I once found was placed a foot or two from the ground in a
bunch of graceful coral fern ( Cleichenia ). The nest was
beautifully lined with the reddish flowering stalks of moss, upon
which three richly coloured eggs rested.
The biggest Honey-eater in the aviary was a solitary
Warty-faced Honey-eater (Meliphaga phrygia). It was happy upon

black and golden garb, the head, throat and chest being black,
while the rest of the plumage in general is beautifully mottled
with black and pure yellow. There is a patch of small wart-like
excrescences on either side of the face, hence the distinguishing
name, Warty-faced. This handsome Honey-eater is about the
size of a Thrush, or about SJ inches in length. Imagine a flock
of about fifty of these beauties darting from tree to tree through
the bush. I have been spell-bound by such a sight, and what a
picture, too, their beautifully constructed, cup-shaped, bark-made
nests make, when resting on a horizontal limb, not to mention
the " pigeon" pair of lovely salmon-coloured eggs!
Now I have come to the last as well as the least of the
captive and captivating Honey-eaters--a little Sanguineous or
Blood-Bird. There was only one specimen--a female (some
gorgeous males having succumbed)--her plumage as usual
being uniform light brown and her length about five inches,
including a long (one inch) Humming-Bird-like bill, so
admirably adapted for prospecting tempting flowers. The males
have their heads, necks and backs of shining scarlet, hence the
name Blood-Bird. In the tropics I have enjoyed watching
scores of these little beauties in their brilliant livery, disporting
themselves and feeding, on dewy mornings, among the Melaleuca
blossoms.
To conclude, I suppose I have come to the crux of my
article from an aviculturist's point of view. How are all these
delightful birds kept in captivity ? Miss Bowie informs me the
food is very simple--garden honey diluted with water ( i.e hone} 7
two parts to one part water--pure honey makes the birds too
fat); a little Lark-food, or instead, bread and water sugared;
plenty of green stuff--lettuce, etc.,--and any seasonable fruit.
Of course, not forgetting a few flies or sucli-like insects.

DEATH-RATE.
By W. Geo. Creswell, M.D., L.R.C.P., F.Z.S.
On the most casual consultation of the pages of any book
or paper devoted to aviculture it is manifest that a great
importance is attached to the question of what dietary is
suitable or unsuitable to the health of any species of bird which
is for the moment under consideration by the particular writer.
This importance is not misjudged: there can be no question--
all my readers will agree with me--that the mortality of birds is
enormously increased coincidently with their impressment into
what we may call the service of man. As an aviculturist of
more than fort}&apos;&apos; years' standing this fact has been painfully borne
in upon my recognition times and times again without number ;
and it is hardly to be supposed that the mind of a medical man,
who has in addition been a student and lover of nature since his
earliest years, has not as a first consequence been persistently
exercised in the attempt to solve the apparently insoluble problem
as to the causes of this mortality. I say apparently insoluble
advisedly, because, although in spite of all the opinions and
even dogmas that have been constantly laid down by one after
another of our most earnest and enthusiastic workers, the
mortality still continues the same, or at any rate has not
diminished in even a proportionate ratio to the admittedly
improved conditions under which our charges are now housed
and lodged ; yet I am confident that in the near future we shall
see much improvement.
This mortality has been evidently accounted for in the
minds of most aviculturists by some occult influence exercised
by this or that article of diet. P&apos;irst we see one thing con-
demned, then another. Colour-food, inga seed, rape seed,
mealworms, some particular kind of green stuff, then any kind
of green stuff if it is wet, bread, pea meal, and in short every-
thing, except canary seed and egg yolk, is in turn condemned as
being the prime factor in this lamentably heavy death-rate.
Then on the other hand all these proscribed articles of diet have
their respective champions, who are ready to fight to the death in
defence of their favourite selection. And neither of the parties

to the controversy has any better reason to allege for its
opinions than the somewhat vague one that they have observed
a heavy death rate, or on the contrary have not experienced any
increase in mortality, after the use of the food for the time being
in dispute. They often go on to say, with the object of
strengthening their position, that the experience of a lifetime
bears them out in whichever opinion they hold.
But it is obvious that of two men, imbued with diame-
trically opposite beliefs on one and the same narrow subject, both
cannot be right: they are more likely r to be both wrong. When
you find one section of aviculturists never giving x and another
section always giving it to their respective birds, and when you
find the death rate in neither section shewing any appreciable
improvement, does it not point irrefragibly to the conclusion that
they are both of them needlessly quarrelling over some-
thing that is really outside the scope of their practical politics,
and that they should rather seek for some cause of the high
mortality which is common to both parties and which has
hitherto never been suspected by either of them? When we see
enteritis (inflammation of the mucous lining of the bowels)
accounted for by half-a-dozen different men, all equally honest
and all equally desirous of helping their fellows, on the score of
half-a-dozen different so-called errors in feeding, each of which
in the eyes of the other five appears to be harmless, (though the
enteritis still continues), what does this confusion point to in the
eyes of the rational onlooker? Exactly what I have said
before--that while it is evident that all of them cannot be right
it is quite possible, and indeed more than probable, that all of
them are wrong. Again, if all of them cannot be right, and one
of them is, which of them is it? And he that is right should be
able to definitely prove the stability of the position he takes up.
As the matter stands each has only the one and the same
argument, namely, that of experience, in other words "post hocA
and this he wishes to convert into " propter hoc.&amp;quot; Therefore, as
far as such argument as he has at command goes, each one is
equally right, which is an absurdity, as Euclid puts it in his
terse and felicitous terms.
Happily, however, the microscope has ended the con-
fusion. It has shewn explicitly and indisputably that errors in

diet as the causes of death are but few, but that although few
they are all-powerful; that having once set up the condition of
disease leading to death, they have put the sufferer practically
beyond the help of drugs: and that the only hope for the
amelioration of the existing difficulties in the way of what is
called acclimatization of foreign birds, and of keeping canaries,
etc., in health, consists in, first, a thorough reorganization of the
existing methods of importation and housing, and, secondly, the
total abolition of egg as an article of food. This, and this alone,
is the offending diet which has done so much harm ; which has
hitherto been unsuspected by our aviculturists ; and which has
been in all our own houses the while we have been seeking
to find the iniquitous something which we fondly supposed to
exist in only our neighbour's.*
I am quite well aware that, in penning the above state-
ment, I am administering a shock of considerable intensity to
my readers ; that it will take them a considerable time to get
over it; and that in the eyes of a few of them it would be well
that I adopted the Shakespearian advice and " write me down an
ass." The defence of my thesis is however too long to inflict on
fellow members in this article, but those of them that are
also members of the Foreign Bird Club will find it set out else-
where, as I hope both fully and convincingly. Septicaemia
in its various types never will--never can--be absolutely
eradicated from the position of being a part of the environment
o [captive wild birds, whatever may be the ultimate position with
regard to it of the purely domesticated species: but by a more
thorough and intelligent adaptation of hygienic laws than exists
at present, and by a rigorous discontinuance of that article of
food which of all substances is the most prolific of the most
virulent form of its causative bacilli, it can be greatly modified
both as to its amount and its capacity for harm, f |
* And yet birds which never eat egg are as subject to disease as those which do.
When I first took up aviculture, and for several years afterwards, I only used egg for
Canaries ; but the death-rate among my other birds was far higher than it has been since
I have given egg. The experience of aviculturists throughout the civilized world for the
past century, is surely of more pxictical value than even microscopic investigation. The
discovery of the potential germs of disease in a food, does not postulate the existence of a
receptive soil to ensure their development.--A. G. B.

hard-boiled egg has been recognised by many for a very long time. -- K. P.

(A mpel is ga mil us).
In many of our readers, I fear the above simple statement
will fail to arouse either surprise or interest. To some, the
difference between a Waxwing and a Waxbill is not very
apparent; to others, the Waxwing is a common bird easily
obtainable for a small sum, and not always a thing of delight
when obtained. But to a goodly few the announcement that
Waxwiugs are nesting in our Honorary Treasurer's aviary, have
laid eggs and are now sitting, will be received with warm
intelligence if not with enthusiasm.
Those of the present generation who know things as they
are, but not as they were, will find it difficult to fully understand
the feelings of naturalists half a century ago on the subject of
this well known species. Perhaps I cannot present the case to
our readers in a better way than by simply quoting from an old
book entitled " Maunder's Treasury of Natural History." Under
the heading of " The Bohemian Waxwing " we find the follow-
ing:--
" ' Whence,' exclaims C. Bonaparte, ' does the Bohemian
Waxwing come at the long and irregular periods of its migra-
tions? Whither does it retire to pass its existence and give birth
to its progen}'? These are circumstances involved in darkness,
and which it has not been given to any naturalist to ascertain.
It has been stated, and with much appearance of probability,
that these birds retire during summer within the arctic circle :
but the fact is otherwise, naturalists who have explored these
regions asserting that they are rarer and more accidental there
than in temperate climates. It seems probable that their chief
place of abode is in the oriental parts of the old continent, and,
if we may hazard an opinion, we should not be surprised if the
extensive and elevated table land of Central Asia was found to
be their principal rendezvous, whence, like the Tartars in former
times, they make their irregular excursions.'
" It seems that in Northern Russia, and the extreme north
of Norway, they are seen in great numbers every winter ; and.

notwithstanding they at times invade peculiar districts in vast
numbers, so remarkable was their appearance in former times
considered, that they have alarmed whole regions, and been
looked upon as the precursors of war, pestilence and other public
calamities."
And even in the Rev. J. G. Wood's "Birds" we find the
following :--
" Although the migratory habits of this bird are well
known, and many of the localities which it frequents have been
recorded by various writers, no one seems to have any certain
information as to its true home, or the country wherein it breeds,
although it is so numerous a species in its own locality that its
hiding places could hardly have escaped notice had they occurred
within the ordinary limits of scientific observation."
And Morris boldly tells us :--"These birds are believed to
breed within the limits of the Arctic circle--in holes among
rocks, or in deep forests." Moreover, having the courage of his
convictions, he gives us a figure of the egg in anticipation of its
discovery--but he would have been wiser in his generation if he
had left that alone.
An illustrated account of the finding of the first Wax-
wing's nest, in Rapland, in 1S56, was given by Professor Newton
in The Ibis for 1S61 (pp. 92-106, pi. IV.). I do not possess this
volume, but in Cassell's Natural History (Vol. IV. page 86) parts
of the account are supplied, and may well (in part) be repeated
here.
The Editor commences with,--" It is difficult, at a distance
of many years, to imagine the excitement which existed in
former days amongst zoologists concerning the nest of the
Waxwing ; and the first authentic record that was published of
the breeding of this bird was an account of the researches of the
late Mr. John Wolley, to whose indefatigable zeal the world is
indebted for positive information of the nidification of a great
number of the rarer European birds." Professor Newton tells
the story of Mr. Wolley's success in The Ibis, which, as quoted,
runs as follows: --
" It is unnecessary to repeat here the fabulous accounts

given by former writers respecting the nidification of this bird.
The very plain statement communicated by Mr. Wolley to the
Zoological Society on the evening of the 24th of March, 1S57, is
sufficient to set them at rest for ever. But still I may remark
that from the days of Linnaeus (who said of it, ' Nidus in rupium
antiis ') downwards, nearly all the conjectures published seem to
have been wide of the mark. In years gone by, one of the
hardiest of our Arctic explorers, Sir John Richardson, had failed
to ascertain anything connected with its breeding in the far
countries of the north-west; and, more recently, the intrepid
Siberian traveller, Dr. A. Von Middendorf, was unsuccessful in
the north-east. Yet it may be safely said that there was no bird
whose egg was so longed for by the ornithologists of the whole
world. Various were the plans they bethought them of for
attaining this desideratissimum. Many tried to keep pairs of
living birds, in the hope of inducing them to breed in confine-
ment. One enthusiastic egg-collector, Baron R. Von Konig-
Warthausen, we are told, even went to the trouble of caging a
whole flock. It is true that here and there an oologist might be
found with whom the ' wish was father to the thought,' and who
accordingly deluded himself into the belief that in some un-
usually large specimen of the egg of the allied species ( Ampelis
cedrorum ), or in some queerly-coloured monstrosity of a bird,
perhaps not at all connected, he recognised a genuine production
of Ampelis garrulus ; but such instances were certainly excep-
tional, and there can be little doubt that prior to 1856 no one
with any pretension to the title of naturalist had ever set eyes on
a real egg or nest of the Waxwing, and that this privilege was
reserved for one who of all men eminently merited it. It is due,
however, to Scandinavian naturalists to say that several of them
who had travelled in Lapland had expressed themselves con-
fident that the bird did sometimes breed in that country ; and
though the reports of its nesting which some of them brought
home have been shown by Mr. Wolley's discovery to be probably
incorrect, yet it was, I think, reliance on the general fidelity of
those gentlemen in matters of this kind which kept alive my
friend's hopes of one day finding the long-sought treasure : but
hopes they were of a kind so remote, that when they were ful-

filled he was justified in speaking of the discovery as ' unex-
pected.'
" The first intimation I received from Mr. Wolley that the
discovery was accomplished was contained in a letter written by
him on his way up the Baltic, and dated 2nd September, 1856.
He says :--' Let me tell yon now, whilst I think of it, that I have
some reason for believing that the Waxwing makes its nest in
good-sized fir-trees in the month of June. I give you this hint
in case I should not live to give you more certain information ;
but you remember that I am not to return home without a Wax-
wing's nest in my hand.' He had, in fact, a few days before,
when at Stockholm, received from his faithful Ludwig a letter
telling him of his discovery, in which Ludwig had himself
assisted, and respecting the truth of which he said, his ' master
must be quite sure--without doubt.' Mr. Wolley, however, for-
bore to allow his own or my expectations to be raised too highly,
and in spite of his receiving confirmatory evidence on his arrival
at Haparanda and on his way up the river, it was not until he
had reached Muoniovara, and had satisfied himself by repeated
investigation of the whole story, that he trusted himself
to write to me positively. His letter, dated ' Muoniovara, 14th
September, 1S56,' after describing his own doings and those of
the friends I had made the preceding year, telling me of the
expected scarcity of food, and giving the general results of the
nesting season, goes on to say : --
" ' I have still to tell you of Ludwig's expedition with
Piko Heiki to Sardio, on the Kittila River. It was early in June,
and he had to wade over Pallas-tunturi up to his middle in snow.
Arrived at Sardio, he found them all at home, deep in dirt and
laziness. He soon extracted from them the information that a
pair of birds had been about, which they took to be Tukarcistas ;
and Ludwig himself had seen such a bird, and this bird's egg
was entered in my list. . . . Ludwig immediately started oft
into the forest, and sure enough he saw a bird which he thought
was Sidensvans ; but he was not quite sure, for the end of its
tail looked white in the sun instead of yellow, as in your
picture, but the next day, or in the evening, it was cloudy, and
Ludwig saw the yellow ; and now he had no longer any doubt.

He said he would give all the lads day-money, and they must all
search, even if it were for a week, till they found the nest. They
sought all that night and the next day till about mid-day, when
a lad called out that he had found the nest; and there it was,
with two eggs, about nine feet high on the branch of a spruce.
.After five days Ludwig snared the old bird--a
beautiful cock ! and you may fancy with what pleasure I took it
in my hand and saw that there were no doubts remaining.
Indeed, I had before been pretty confident about it : Ludwig had
written that I might be cpiite satisfied that it was the right bird.
Martin Pekka had the picture with him at Sodankyla, and as
soon as he came back Ludwig compared the bird with it, and
certainty was doubly sure.You can fancy how
eagerly I waited for Ludwig to produce the eggs. With a
trembling hand he brought them out: but first the nest,
beautifully preserved. It is made principally of black ' tree-
hair' (lichen), with dried spruce twigs outside, partially lined with
a little sheep's-grass and one or two feathers--a large, deep nest.
The eggs--beautiful! magnificent!!---just the character of the
American bird. A11 indescribable glow of colour about them.
Ludwig had made for them such a box that even if a horse trod
upon it it would not break.
" Almost every day (and it is now the sixth since that of
my arrival here) Ludwig has told me the whole story of the
Sidensvans&apos; nest, and I am never tired of hearing it:--How the
season was very backward ; how, in their expedition, he and
Piko Heiki were getting very much out of spirits at the little
success they met with. How he saw this bird in the sunshine.
How, when at last the nest was found, he could scarcely believe
his eyes ; how he went to it again and again, each time con-
vinced when at the spot, but believing it all a dream as soon as
he was at a distance. The rising and falling of the crest of the
bird, its curious song or voice--all he is eager to tell over and
over again ; and I have the fullest version, with all the " I said,"
" he said," " Michel said," " Ole said," etc. These Sardio lads,
as you have heard me say formerly, have a good knowledge of
the small birds of their neighbourhood, but they are none of
them sure whether they have ever seen Sidensvans before. As I

have also told you, it seemed to be known to a very few wood-
men on that side of the country under the name of " Korwa-
rastas&amp;quot; or " Korwa - Hutu" (Ear-bird). It had occasionally
attracted their attention as having feathers on its head standing
up like Squirrel's ears. It was not till the second year of my
stay here that I ascertained this with certainty. The first
summer I believed it to be " Harr hi&apos;&apos; a bird coming in bad
seasons, and properly the common Jay ; but it seems that this
name is also really sometimes given to Sidensvans, and therefore,
as well as for other reasons, I am inclined to believe that the
bird is only here very occasionally."

1S58 Mr. Dresser found a small settlement of the species on an

island in the Baltic near Uleaborg, and with his own hands took
a nest. It is now pretty evident that the Waxwing, though
doubtless breeding yearly in some parts of northern Europe, is
as irregular in the choice of its summer-quarters as in that of
its winter - retreats. Moreover, the species exhibits the same
irregular habits in America. Mr. Drexler on one occasion, in
Nebraska, saw it in ' millions.' "
From the " Royal Natural History" I cull the following:--
" Great interest for many years attached to the nesting-habits ot
the Bohemian Waxwing, which were surrounded by mystery
until solved by Messrs. Dresser and Wolley. The former of
these ornithologists found the Waxwing breeding in Finland in
the year 1858, onl) r two years after the latter had obtained the
nest of a Waxwing in Lapland. Writing of his nest-hunting
experiences, Mr. Dresser says that, after finding a tree in which
a Waxwing built, 'I climbed up to the nest, which was in the
fork between the main stem and the first branch, and not above
nine or ten feet from the ground.' " The nest contained five
young ones.
And in Sharpe's " British Birds" we find:--" Its breeding
quarters are the pine regions in the north of the Old and
New Worlds, about the line of the Arctic Circle. It has been
recorded as nesting in North-eastern Norway, in Lapland, in
Finland, and Mr. Seebolmi says that he met with it during the

breeding season in the valleys of the Petchora and the Yenesei.
Although the species occurs in the interior of Alaska, apparently
somewhat plentifully, only once has its nest been found in the
territory; this was by Kennicott, near Fort Yukon, in July, 1S61.
This species must surely nest elsewhere in the Arctic portions of
North America, as it has been observed on the Anderson river
during the breeding-time ; but at present the Alaskan record is
the only one for the whole of North America."
I have recently received three letters from Mr. St. Quintin,
extracts from which he authorises me to publish :--
"June 26, 1903. I thought I was going to chronicle a real
success in bird-breeding! A pair of my Waxwings, some three
weeks ago, began to feed each other, and show various evident
signs of pairing (we saw them pair once). Ten days ago I put a
rough nest into the aviary suspended from a beam (a mistake).
They soon took to this, altered it, and rebuilt and lined it with
small roots and feathers. I had not then any of the ' old man's
beard,' or tree lichen, which I have now obtained from Scotland.
The birds became exceedingly tame, and I fed them well, adding
mealworms freely to the ordinary diet. At last we felt sure that
there was an egg, or eggs, and expected the hen to commence
sitting. Suddenly Mr. Meade-Waldo, who has been here, told
me on Monday that he thought the hen was going to build in
another place. I am sorry to say this is true, and they are
building, but in a more desultory way, in the head of a spruce
tree nailed against the wall, in an old Missel Thrush's nest,
which they have added to.
"I am afraid they are not so keen as they were ! How
near success we were you may guess when I say that this
morning I found a beautiful egg, perfectly formed and coloured,
in the deserted nest. I fear the cause of desertion was that, in a
heavy wind from an unusual quarter, the nest (in a cage dressed
with yew-boughs, and made up from the bottom with twigs and
roots, to receive the true nest of the birds) swung and twisted
round. As soon as I noticed this, it was rectified ; but I fear it
unsettled the birds. I took three other Waxwings out of this

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
aviary in order to have the first pair quiet; two of these seem
inclined to nest too."
"July 2, 1903. I thought you might like to see a
Waxwing's egg laid in Great Britain , and am therefore sending
for you to see the egg my bird laid in the first nest. She is
sitting nicely now in the second nest, and, though I have not
ventured to look, from her movements when she 'goes on,' I
have no doubt at all that she has the rest of her clutch under
her. I know my man will do his best, but do regret that I
am leaving home just now.If we do rear a young
Waxwing or two, I will of course send you a paper on the
subject. It seems rather a moot point what may be the food
supplied to the young by the parents, berries (of the preceding
summer?) or insects. The former seems to be unlikely, but the
birds shall have their choice, including of course the much
abused mealworm, and fresh ants' eggs, egg, etc. I have never
seen the male take anything to the female but mealworms. I
expect that this will be what they will carry to the young--
should they hatch."
"July 4, 1903. The hen bird is sitting very steadily."
The following I take from Sharpe's " British Birds,"
already quoted :--
"Nest. --According to Mr. Seebohm, the nest is a large
and very compact structure, the outside diameter of one in his
possession being seven inches and the inside four inches; it is
about four inches high outside, and nearly two inches deep.
The foundation is made of twigs of spruce fir and reindeer-
moss. The nest itself is composed of feathers and black hair-
lichen, interwoven together w r ith very slender twigs and a little
moss and inner bark, the feathers being most numerous in the
lining.
"Eggs. --From five to six and occasionally seven in
number. They are quite unmistakable, being of a lilac-grey or
stone-grey ground-colour, with spots of black or blackish-
brown, varying in size and intensity, but pretty equally
distributed over the surface of the eggs, and accompanied by

underlying spots of violet-grey, more or less distinctly
indicated. Axis, 075--1'05 inch. ; diam., C65--075."
Mr. St. Ouintin's egg, which he has so kindly forwarded to
us for inspection, is doubtless the very first egg of the species
that has ever been laid in the United Kingdom, whether by
wild bird or captive, and the first egg of the species that has
ever been laid in captivity, either in this country or any other.
Mr. Gronvold, an expert on the colours of eggs, describes it as
follows:--"Of a regular egg-shape; ground colour, light bluish
green ; surface spots blackish-brown; underlying spots, lilac-
grey varying dark and light; a fair number of spots generally
distributed ; length, o&apos;9S ; diameter, o - 69."
As regards the feeding of the young, Wilson tells us of
the closely allied Cedar Bird:--"About the last week in June
the young are hatched, and are at first fed on insects and their
larvae ; but, as tlie3 7 advance in growth, on berries of various
kinds. These facts I have myself been an eye-witness to."
Concerning the "wax" tips to some of the feathers,
Wilson (on the Cedar Bird) writes ;--"Six or seven, and some-
times the whole nine, secondary feathers of the wings are
ornamented at the tips with small red oblong appendages,
resembling red sealing-wax ; these appear to be a prolongation
of the shafts, and to be intended for preserving the ends, and
consequent^ the vanes, of the quills from being broken and
worn away from the almost continual fluttering of the bird
among thick branches of the cedar. The feathers of those birds,
which are without these appendages, are uniformly found ragged
on the edges, but smooth and perfect in those on whom the
marks are full and numerous. They are common to male and
female. The young do not receive them until the second fall,
when, in moulting time, they may be seen fully formed, as the
feather is developed from its sheath. I have once or twice found
a solitary one on the extremity of one of the tail-feathers."
As to the name, I protest against the senseless title of
"Bohemian" Waxwing being perpetuated b)^ modern writers.
The species is not in any way peculiar to Bohemia ; on the
</bodyText>

And why these continual side-hits against the name
" Chatterer ! " The bird does not, as far as I know, utter any
loud cry, but it does chatter. It is a very sociable bird, and when
in a flock they chatter away freely. Even in my own aviary, I
used to hear my diminutive "flock" chattering away.
I may close by briefly stating that there are only three
species in the genus Ampelis \--

Coturnix coromandelica.
By L. M. Seth-Smith, B.A.
This species seems to have been little known to
aviculturists until last year, when a few were imported, and
now there seems to be a considerable number on the market,
obtainable at a reasonable price.
The male is a very handsome bird, like the male of
C. communis, but with the black pattern on the throat more
strongly marked and with a large black patch covering the
middle of the chest and breast.-

on the Black-breasted or Rain Quail. 367
The female is very like that of C. communis.
This bird inhabits the greater part of India, merely
changing its feeding ground with the change of the season.
About Christmas, 1902, I obtained a pair of these birds,
which had been kept in a large outdoor aviary for some months,
and so were in very nice condition. They were put into an
unheated covered aviary, a few branches of evergreen being
put on the ground as a retreat, and of these they took full
advantage, as they were very shy.
Early in February they were let out into a grassed, wired,
enclosure adjoining, about 20 feet square, the grass however
being too short to afford them cover, which was supplied as
before, in the form of evergreen.
Early in May I found, on several occasions, eggshells, the
contents of which had been eaten. About the middle of the
month, on going into the aviary, I accidentally kicked a tuft of
grass, out of which the hen rushed, and on looking I found a
nest, or at least a slight hollow in the ground, perfectly hidden,
with one egg in it. The next day the egg was lying some three
or four feet away from the nest, which was empty, and during
the next few days several eggs were found lying about in all
directions, some partly eaten and others whole. In Hume's Nests
and Eggs of Indian Birds Mr. Davidson remarks, "One thing about
these Quails I noticed was the enormous number of nests that
were destroyed. I hardly ever walked out without discovering
broken eggs lying about; but what animal was the culprit
I never could be sure, though I suspect the common Crow
Pheasant and the large Eizard (Blood-sucker) are generally the
offenders."
Upon reading this it struck me that possibly the birds had
been frightened when laying and had eaten the eggs themselves,
as was the case, I feel sure, with my birds; at any rate it seems
a curious coincidence. All the eggs I found were of the same
brownish colour, but varied greatly in markings, some being
finely speckled, others boldly blotched with dark brown.
This egg-eating habit made me give up all hope of

successfully rearing any young birds. About May 25th, however,
I missed the hen. The grass was very high, and I could not
watch the birds nearly so closely as I should like to have done,
in fact, sometimes I could not see either of them for days. Then
came the terrible wet weather, of which we had such an interes-
ting account last month. On June 21st I thought the hen must
be dead or else the eggs spoilt by the rain, so I determined to
search for the nest. This was no easy matter, as the grass was .a
foot high and in some places there were patches of nettles three
feet high ; however, after a long search, I saw the hen dart
across a small opening in the grass, and, on looking, I found the
nest at the end of a tunnel in the grass containing seven eggs.
I was at first afraid the bird would treat the eggs as she
had done before, but on June 23rd I was delighted to see her
followed by several chicks, and on visiting the nest I found that
all seven eggs had hatched, which speaks well for the pluck}^
little bird who had sat through almost unceasing rain.
But alas! I found three dead the same morning, two more
in the evening, and one the next evening. They were supplied
with plenty of food, fresh ants' eggs etc. The cause of their
dying seems to have been cold, for the hen, being timid, runs
away at the least sound, and if the young are not strong enough
to follow they die in a very little while.
The only young one that remained, however, was well
looked after by the hen, and was soon strong enough to follow
her about anywhere. It grew rapidly and when three weeks old
was the image of its mother, though considerably smaller.
The cock did not seem to take any notice whatever of
the young one.
The note of the cock bird in the breeding season is
worthy of a remark, it being a double whistle (not with three
notes as in the case of C. communis&apos;) repeated several times, at
first softly, but becoming louder and louder as the bird raises his
head higher and higher. It sounds more like the note of a
Parrakeet than that of a Quail.

To those of our members who are interested in the works
ofthelate Poet Laureate, the beautifully got up book by Mr.Watkin
Watkins will prove a great delight. Few of the poets were so
familiar with the English country-side, and few had a sounder
knowledge of the birds, or knew better how to present a more
faithful picture of their life habits. It is, therefore, somewhat
remarkable that a book like that now before us has not appeared
before. Mr. Watkins has done for Tennyson what Mr. Halting
has done for Shakespeare, namely, collected and explained the
many references to birds to be found in his poems, and his book
is rendered doubly attractive by a series of excellent illustrations
by Mr. Lodge.

Few, if any, of our members who keep British birds to
any extent are unfamiliar with the late Dr. Bradburn's most
useful handbook, for it is a book that the aviculturist or fancier
who attempts to liand-rear British birds, whether he keeps them
for show or otherwise, cannot do well without. There is
certainly no other book of the kind that goes so very fully into
the many matters connected with British birds from a fancier's
point of view, and, although some may disagree with him on
a few of his theories, no one will deny that his book is most
valuable to those who would " go in " for many British birds.
The present edition has been revised and enlarged by Mr.
Allen Silver and contains some nice illustrations, as well as a
valuable article by Mr. Fulljames on the feeding of insectivorous
birds.

Sir, --It lias been stated in the Journal d&apos;Acclimatation, the Garden-
taube, and other periodicals that there exists near Tunis an Institution for
the breeding of Egrets in captivity, in order to supply plumes ( aigrettes)
for ladies' hats in Paris. It is said that the birds multiply rapidly in a large
aviary supplied with trees and water and are regularly "deplumed '' twice a
year. They are stated to yield on an average "six grammes of featheis
worth five francs per gramme," so that the feathers are " more valuable
than gold, which is worth only about three francs per gramme! "
I should much like to know whether this circumstantial story is true,
for Egrets are not usually good breeders in captivity. Can any of your
readers kindly supply me with information on the subject?

One of these died (the only one since shipment), so I replaced it by another
before I cleared out the rest. The birds were kept confined about a week,
and let out early last week. They much appreciated their liberty, and have
been going about the island, behind the keeper's house, and som e
occasionally crossing to the mainland, where I am told they alreadj&apos;

was that the sailor had taken it with him as a companion on three voyages

distinctly, is in good health, although it lost a portion of its beak and one
toe in a fight with a dog about twenty years ago. It may be added that the

GERMAN BIRD-DEALERS AND FANCIERS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998868227272728" page_id="10284502"  page_num="Page 371" year="" vol="">
SIR,--Having been obliged to go to Germany lately for a course of
baths, I took the opportunity of visiting a few of the bird-dealers in the
vicinity of the Black Forest.
Air. Kestermann (a member) most kindly advised me to go and see
Herr Karl Kullmann if I should happen to go to Frankfort-on-Main.
Herr Kullmann is an enthusiastic bird-lover, and a great authority on
birds. He keeps them for pleasure, and very courteously showed me
his pets. He goes in almost entirely for European insectivorous song-birds,
such as Nightingales, Blackcaps, Blue-throated Warblers, Robins, Orphean
Warblers, Garden Warblers, etc.
A beautiful Blue-throated Warbler (the white-spotted one) he has
had eight yea:s; and I believe I am correct in saying that he has had a
Nightingale for close on 16 years. This bird, he told me, comes on his
hand, and there sings.
Herr Kullmann keeps all his birds in cages open to the front only,
and I noticed that he gives them no sand, but a slip of paper, fitting to the
drawer, fresh ever} - day.
Indeed since I have seen his birds and those of a dealer at Bad-
Homburg who also makes use of no sand, I have begun to wonder wdiether
it is needful, although we in England have always had the idea that it is
necessary to the health of the birds. There is one great disadvantage of
sand, to my mind, in the cages of insectivorous birds, and that is if
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.975971428571429" page_id="10284503"  page_num="Page 372" year="" vol="">
Correspondence, Notes, etc.
they have fruit and bits of meat, etc., they so often, in their desire to
make the mouthful a suitable size, knock it about in the sand until it is
covered with it, and I should think it is a great question as to whether food
swallowed in such a state is healthy for them.
Then also, when the birds hop about, their feet often become
encrusted with sand mixed with excreta, and this is very bad for them.
Sand has a tendency to dry up the feet too much, for birds in their
wild life constantly keep them moist in dewy grass. At any rate, there are
Herr Karl Kullmann's birds, living for eight, ten, and fifteen years in
perfect health, and I never saw Nightingales, Blackcaps, etc., with feet in
better condition ; or in better all-round health.
Herr Kullmann's address is
Staufen Strasse, 26,
Frankfort A/M.
He is a most extraordinarily clever imitator of birds' songs, and
without in the least attainingto the true key notes, or even by whistling, he
will, by means of various vocal sounds, convey to you the song of a bird.
He has studied for many years the most desirable manner of feeding
insectivorous birds, and has put together a mixture called " Lucullus,"
which is made up by a bird-dealer at Homburg.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.53171875" page_id="10284503"  page_num="Page 372" year="" vol="">
The address is

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.97754025" page_id="10284503"  page_num="Page 372" year="" vol="">
Germany.
Herr Fries excels in making cages, especially cages for insectivorous
birds. They are open to the front only, and the tops are of green plush-
silk (or some such texture). The perches are screwed 011 from the outside,
so that they can be moved to any part of the cage, and they do not go right
across.
He particularly studies the size of the birds' feet for which the cage
is intended ; and the result is quite excellent. They are not round, but a
flattened oval.
Herr Fries' birds are most beautifully kept. He uses peat moss
litter at the bottom of the cages, and when .lie sends a bird by rail, a piece
of paper is placed over the peat-moss, and fixed down by means of three
pieces of wood (" perches " they might be called), so that when the cage
arrives after a jolting in the train, everything is in order; the pieces of wood
are removed and the paper which they have held down, and there under-
neath is a clean bed of peat-moss litter. A great advantage of this moss is
that it will keep clean for a very long time; it is only necessary to turn it
over and shake it up every morning, removing any dirt, which is easily
done. Then, too, the moss is beautifully soft for the birds' feet, and
absorbes the water which may be splashed on to it from the bath.

As in the case of sand, it does not do to give the birds food which
they will be likely to mess about with before eating (the paper makes this
all right), but Herr Fries feeds his insectivorous birds (Nightingales,
Sprossers, Blue-throated Warblers, etc.) entirely on the mixture already
mentioned--" Lucullus "--and there is with that no need for the bird to
put the food in the tray. There was every possible sign that this food is
extremely beneficial. Herr Fries is most particular with regard to the
ants' eggs (cocoons), etc., which go towards making this mixture.
When his more delicate insectivorous birds are moultiug, he gives
them nothing except quite fresh "ants' eggs," which of course in the
neighbourhood of the Taunus Mountains and the Black Forest are easilv
found. Then when the moult is over, he gradually reintroduces amongst
the fresh ants' eggs the "Lucullus" mixture until the latter once more
reigns supreme. He has won several medals for this food ; and he tells me
that he does send some to England.
I bought of him a beautiful Blue-throated Warbler (a white-spotted
one with an extra large white spot) which is now nearing the completion of
it's moult as I write, in the middle of August. The bird is in splendid
condition, his feathers tight up, and his legs and feet beautifully clean and
slender. He certainly seems none the worse for having been four months
without any sand.
At the Zoological Gardens at Frankfort, all the insectivorous birds (a
very interesting collection) are fed on "Lucullus." Amongst them there
are Long-tailed Titmice, Golden-crested Wrens, Black Redstarts, Great
Reed Warbler, Alpine Accentors, Golden Orioles, and many others.
Another German bird-dealer (not mentioned, I fancy, in Mr.
Kestermann's list) is
J. M. Hoeffliu,
Konradstrasse, No. 4,
Freiburg,
Baden.
His birds are kept in very' good condition, and amongst them I saw a
Thrush, whose exact name I was uncertain of. He told me it is a Chinese
bird. It was too old, or I would have bought it. The general upper
plumage was pale grey, and the under plumage (speaking sketchily !) was
pale chestnut. I remember seeing the bird figured in Sharpe's "Mono-
graph of the Turdidae," but have not the work by me at the present.
In conclusion I may add that the German bird-dealers, so far as I
have seen, set our English ones an example which some of them might
with advantage follow (both for the sake of the birds and the customers),
namely, the example of cleanliness, which is a natural part of what with
the Germans one sees so evidently shewn forth. I mean thoughtfulness
for the bird's welfare.

The filth, with its accompanying horrible smells, and the want of fresh
air in some of our English bird-dealers' shops are most objectionable;
and also quite inexcusable, considering that it is their profession. But
perhaps just as there are dirty houses and clean houses, so too with the
bird shops.
The result of this slovenly and dirty way of keeping the birds must
mean disease and a large accumulation of parasites, both of which are only
too often, when birds are purchased, carried into aviaries, there to spread
disastrously. I went to four bird shops at Frankfort-on-Main, every one of
which was beautifully clean and sweet.
There were not so many birds as one sees in some of the English
shops, but I would far sooner see two or three genuine pairs of Japanese
Robins (to take an example) in good plumage and well kept, than a hundred
of these birds, minus tails and flight feathers, often clotted with dirt, with
perhaps two or three dead ones lying in the filth at the bottom of the cage,
and the drinking water looking as if it had been taken from a sewer.
What it must be to the poor birds after luxuriating in pure fresh air
(day and night), after washing in clear streams and pools, after good food
obtained amongst leafy trees and cool grass, I can't imagine.

THE EGGS OF THE GREY SINGING-FINCH, &amp;c.
Sir, --If my small experience is of any value, I may say that my
Grey Singing-finches had four eggs in their first nest (see May number) and
hatched four young. In the next nest there were three eggs, one hatched
and in the third, three clear eggs, they were then moulting (July).
All the eggs were creamy white, entirely without spots.
I once had a pair of Bearded Seedeaters (see page 5, vol. 6), their
eggs were spotted at the larger end, and were somewhat like Canaries'
eggs, they were alwaj'S four in number.

a few moments, while I was sitting in another part of the garden. The
birds had been in the same aviary for nearly two years, and had always been
perfectly friendly. Another Golden Pheasant is now in the same aviary,
and they are perfectly quiet; is it safe to leave this one without making a

and I had thought that there would be time enough if I saw signs of
fighting.
Now, as I want to buy some more, I shall be glad to know which
kinds will agree together ; for instance, could I make a wire division down
the length of the run, and keep two male Amliersts on one side and two
Golden on the other ? The females are such plain birds I do not care to
have them ; and I do not like the idea of only two Pheasants in a run -- it does
not look full enough.
Before I had an Amherst, my three Golden males (which were of one
brood) never fought; is this a general rule, or is it only Amliersts and
Golden that will not do together ? Octavia Gregory.

Sir, --I wrote last year, and gave my experiences of breeding
Virginian Cardinals. This year, at the end of April, they&apos; went to nest.
I did not remove the cock bird, and he helped the hen, and brought up
two fine young birds. The last two years when I left him in the aviary he
ate the voting ones, so this is the first year he has not been taken away. The
next nest, built in the same cage-box in the inside of the aviary, contained
three young birds. [The parents fed them till they left the nest, which
they always do when half feathered; it was a very&apos; cold day, and one
left in the nest, with no feathers on, died. I picked up another nearly
dead, and returned it, but it got cramp ; this, and the healthy one, I brought
in and liaud-fed, the same way as I reared one last year, but the cold day
must have been too much for them, for they both died. A pair of Popes I
bought last winter were in the other aviary adjoining, with a pair of Green

Cardinals bought in February, and a lot of other small foreign and English
birds. The Popes laid, but as they went for the birds that came near their
nest I removed them to a little hutch about a yard square, where they
continued to lay. One egg I put under a Canary hatched, though most of
them were clear. The Green Cardinals are very tame and built in the
outside of the aviary, and they sat alternately, changing nests whilst Iwas
looking on, but I am sorry to say their eggs are clear.
I am much troubled with red mite in my aviary ; one side I have
syringed with creosote, but the birds would not go in for some days, as the
stuff was very strong. The other side; was limed and done with Jeve's fluid
this spring, but several Canary and mule nests have been deserted when
hatched, and the young have been covered with red mite. They do not
mind Keating, as all the boxes are done often out, and fresh hay with
Keating put at the bottom, and they were scalded this spring. I find that
only creosote kills tlieur. Can I put anything into the birds' bath water, as
they pick themselves. A Bullfinch hatched and then deserted owing to
these mites.*
I have a pair of tiny Quails, but the cock nearly 7 pecked the hen's
ey 7 es out, and I had to separate them. The cock Saffron-fincli paired with
the Canary, but she deserted; the eggs were fertile, I believe. The
Virginians are sitting for the fourth time; the eggs disappeared the third
time when ready to hatch.
I wish some more of the members would describe their aviary-
experiences for the benefit of others.
I have a pair of Robins : the cock only calls to the hen if separated :
he never sings. Last year a Lavender Finch, two Yellow-cheeked
Waxbills, and three Cordon Bleus, one of which I bred, stood i8* to 24*
of frost in my out door aviary. I should like to know if many of the
members have tried leaving the Spectacle-birds out.

Two Young Virginian Cardinals. (The Hon. M. C. Hawke). One was
very bare of feathers and hen was not sitting on it. I gave it to a
Green Cardinal sitting on clear eggs. They fed it all that afternoon
and evening with mealworms, but it was dead at 8 a.m. next morning.
The other one left with parents I found dead this morning,

worms and which caused intestinal irritation. 2nd, Congestion of
lungs].
Liothrix. (The Hon. M. C. Hawke). Well until three weeks ago, then
seemed to get worse every day. What sex was it ? [Liver disease of
longstanding. It was a hen].
Patagonian Conure. (Miss R. Alderson). Had been sleepy and listless
for some weeks, I turned it from a cage to an outdoor aviary, and
here it seemed much better. It frequently sneezed but seemed
better; on Sunday it was worse and died on Tuesday. It seemed
very thirsty and bowels were relaxed. [Bird had congestion of
liver, but the immediate cause of death was enteritis, I should say
caused by a chill possibly contracted when turned out of doors. It
was a hen].
Pennant ParrakEET. (Mr. Leigh). Bought in June, put in an outdoor
aviary. P&apos;ed on canary, hemp, and sunflower seed. Well until a few
days ago, became dull and disinclined to fly. [Bird died of
inflammation of Mver, and I fear the sunflower seed may have
indirectly been the cause owing to the large quantity of oil it
contains. The acute phase of the disease might have been caused by
chill upon the already over stimulated liver. In my opinion, sun-
flower seed should be used with caution, especially when given
with hemp. It was a male].
Gouedian Finch. (Mrs. M. Charrington). In outdoor aviary three years ;
perfectly well until yesterday morning, seemed paralysed in after-
noon. Had commenced nesting. [Apoplectic fit was cause of death.
I think you are to be congratulated on keeping your birds so long a

THE SILVER-EARED MESIA.
Mesici argentauris.

I think it was Mr. Wesley T. Page who first drew our
attention (VII., p. 168) to some rare and beautiful birds that had
been presented to the London Zoological Society by Mr. E. W.
Harper, and which, in June 1901, were on view in the Parrot
House. Amongst these was a male Silver-eared Mesia, which he
at once recognised as being akin to our very old friend the
Yellow-bellied Liothrix, Liothrix lutea. Early in 1902, Mr.
Harper personally brought some specimens to this country, five
I was told. Some of these have appeared at the Bird Shows,
and will have been noticed by several of our Members; and I
suppose that these are the three, one male and two females, which
rather recently have found a resting place in Mr. D. Seth-
Smith's comfortable aviaries. But the other two came into my
hands on the 27th June, 1902; and it is this pair that form the
foundation of the present article. Before taking up their story,
however, let me say a few words concerning the species
generally.
As already stated, the Silver-eared Mesia, called by Jerdon
the Silver-eared Hill-Tit, is nearly allied to the common
Liothrix, although placed in a separate genus, and like that
species is a native of the Himalayas. It, however, keeps to a
lower elevation, a circumstance that points to its being a less
hardy species. Its range too is not so extensive, for, while the
Liothrix may be found as far away as Southern China, the
Museum Catalogue (VII., p. 643) tells us that the Mesia is

confined to the "Eastern Himalayas, throughout the hills of
North-Eastern Bengal and Burmah to Tenasserim." In a letter
to me Mr. Harper said that they are very rare even in the Indian
market, and that during the past three years (he was writing in
June, 1902) he had seen only seven ; and Mr. Frank Finn says
that he has never seen this bird wild.
Mr. Gronvold's excellent drawing presents the plumage
of this species to our readers ; it may be distinguished from the
Eiothrix by its black cap, the silvery-white ear-coverts, and by
the (when in good condition) bright light-yellow bill.
The sexes are different, a point of immense value and
relief to the aviculturist. The general plumage of the male is
brighter and more gaudy, especiall)&apos; on the wings and around
the base of the tail, and the tail-coverts of the male are deep
red, of my female now yellow-green like the nuchal collar. The
shades, and indeed the actual colours in these birds, at any rate
in captivity, differ considerably, so that one can speak only
generally of some of them, but a glance at the tail-coverts will
always, I suspect, enable one to distinguish the sex. I11 the
Feathered World of 12th January, 1900, Mr. Frank Finn says on
this point:--"Also the male has a bright red patch round the
root of the tail, which patch, being buff in the female, furnishes
a ready means of discriminating between the sexes" ; but this
is in India, not in an open aviary in Fondon.
There is but one other species in the genus, Mesia laurina ,
which is " Confined to the higher ranges of the island of
Sumatra," and is not likely to find its way to this country yet
awhile.
The ordinary song of the Mesia, usually frequently
repeated, especially in the early morning during incjibation, as a
song, is very poor ; but it is generally uttered in such a bright
cheerful crisp way as to form a pleasing and noticeable addition
to the many voices that emanate from the aviary. Although
but one song, it has two phases, the one consisting of five the other
of six notes, but there are occasional differences and divergences
in accent and inflection. Mr. Finn has put the second phase into
words, and says:--" The male only,* I think, sings, but his
I am not fully satisfied on this point.--K.P.

notes, though remarkably loud and clear, are not to be compared
with the Pekin Robin's. One male I had always seemed to me
to say, or rather shout, You--just -- conic -- over--here , a very
suitable call for a hill bird, as this is." But he disregards the
pause, sometimes a very marked one, which usually follows the
first note :--" Boy ; just--come--over--here," and occasionally
after the second, " You--dolt ; come--over--here." The song of
my male more frequently consists of the five bare notes, varying
in intensity, and often uttered with much force: --Boy: you--
just--come--here. During incubation, in the early morning, my
bird would ejaculate this song with o'er much energy and
emphasis for the sensitive ears of my neighbours, ears attuned
to the symphonies of cats and the melodies of dogs, and to
whom the singing of the birds comes as a discordance and an
abomination. One morning, after a "complaint," the song
commenced at 4.iS, and, thinking of my watchful neighbour, I
quailed and writhed at each repetition, and hoped against hope
that each might be the last, but it was uttered with unabated
vigour thirty-three times in succession. I thought this was
sufficient, but, four mornings later, commencing shortly after
4 o'clock, the irrepressible creature went on and on until I retired
into the land of Nod on or about the 150th repetition of the
stern invitation to the heedless boy--let us hope that I lost
count, or that my sleepless neighbour was] as sound asleep as I
soon was. It is specially noticeable that whatever phase or
variation of the song the bird may commence with, that
particular variation is mostly adhered to throughout all the
repetitions. One morning, for instance, the joyful father started
off in a regular jingle :--" Come along--and see--my babe;"
this was repeated a great number of times, but when once
dropped was lost. When one thinks of the variations in the
song, one feels that a young bird, carefully trained, might be
taught snatches of other songs, or even to repeat a short
sentence ; but the strictness with which it keeps to a limited
number of notes, rarely exceeding six, is discouraging.
Then there is the ordinary call-note, used by male and
female, consisting of one note repeated quickly several times,
but so seldom uttered by my two contented birds that I hesitate

to describe it. I think I am not far wrong if I say that it much
resembles that of the common Liothrix.
Then again there is the watchman's alarm-rattle, which I
have never heard but when the birds had young. It consists of
a low grating chatter, the tail vibrating in unison with each
" click" of the rattle. It was not always uttered with the same
intensity, but whether this was regulated by the supposed
urgency of the danger, or whether the more feeble alarm was
that of the female, I could not determine. On September 5, a
mouse having been seen near to the baby's box, there was a
great ado ; but only the male was clattering, the female joining
in in perfect harmony with a loud " tsit." I improved the
occasion by slipping round and inspecting Nest No. 5.
We are told that some of the colours (presumably of a
preserved skin) of the Mesia fade if exposed to light:--"The
colours in this species fade on exposure to the light, the olive-
colour of the back shading into grey, the underparts into ashy
white, while all the brilliancy of the bright portions of the wing
and of the tail-coverts disappears." (Mus. Cat. VII., p. 643).
" The colours fade to slaty, with a faint tinge of green, and paler
beneath." (Jerdon II., p. 252). It is not only in Museum
specimens that the colours fade, but also in the living bird, at
any rate in my garden, my pair being now quite of an ordinary
colour, green-gray predominating, though the male still has
some bright red 011 the wings and tail-coverts. I11 August last I
examined the male which has been in the Parrot House at the
Zoological Gardens since 1st January, 1901, and found it but
little brighter than mine, but with a duller and darker bill. The
bills of my birds, since they have been in condition, are of a-
bright clear yellow, pointing to an improvement in health since
they were painted by Mr. Gronvold.
At page 244 of Vol. VIII. of our Magazine, Mr. E. W.
Harper, in his interesting article on the Blue-winged Siva, says :--
"At the present time I haveSivas, Mesias, Yellow-eved Babblers,
Sibias, and Common Babblers all in one apartment. These birds
are almost exactly alike in general habits, and are on the best of
terms with each other. A glance at them after roosting time is

sufficient to verify this, owing to the snug way in which they are
packed side by side upon the perches. So closely do they sit, that
their tails almost invariably cross those of their neighbours."
Surely Mr. Harper must have overlooked the Sibias when he
penned the words " These birds are almost exactly alike in general
habits." My Mesias detest the meddling interfering prying Red-
eyed Babbler*, and likewise the Sibias have no respect for him
and occasionally swoop at him savagely ; and the general habits
of the Sibia, a species which we described in our June number, are
about as unlike those of the Mesia and Babbler as can well be.
While the liglit-bodied Sibia is so fond of the air, and takes so
much of its prey on the wing, and is constantly darting hither
and thither as light of " foot" as a Springbok, the Mesia hops
and clambers about amongst the foliage, hunting for tiny insect
life which it picks off the leaves, but never darting into the air.
In vain did I, when they had young, breed and entice flies into
the aviary and to the very food dishes, regardless of olfactory
consequences, but they absolutely ignored them. It has not the
same power of sucking as the Sibia has, and generally takes its
food differently. If I may judge by my own specimens, the
Mesia and Sibia are unlike, and in many ways diverse.
The Mesia is fairly general in its tastes, devouring a good
deal of tiny insect life, a fair amount of fruit, and possibly a
little seed. It will take very small cockroaches, but seems to
have no idea of tackling anything too large to be swallowed
whole. Its inability to cope with any but small insects very
greatly added to the difficulty of rearing the 3 7 ouug in Tondon
where insects are practically unprocurable. Gentles my birds
would never look at, but they did their best to kill themselves
with mealworms during the nesting period. Three things I
think I noticed. While the first nest of young was in hand,
they so upset themselves with mealworms as to become demoral-
ized, but when the second nest containing young came on they
* Now that my Yellow-eyed Babbler (see page 83 of this volume) has become adult,
the eyes have turned deep red. A fine male which was forwarded to me soon after death
not long ago had also red eyes ; and the eyes of the one at the Zoological Gardens are
reddish. Some time ago Mr. Heselton wrote to me about the " Red-eyed Babbler," which
would seem to be a more descriptive name for the species.--R.P.

were more temperate, as if they had learnt a lesson. While they
had young to feed they seemed to give up fruit, which, as they
fed from the crop, is suggestive ; but they took a little sop. And
after they had nearly killed themselves and their young one with
wasp-grubs, they suddenly almost deserted them. Ordinary
insectivorous food is always within their reach, and is just pecked
at when they can get nothing better. It seems to me that insect
life, gathered from the foliage of trees, is probably their principal
food in the wild state. My birds do not betray any disposition
to search for food along hedge bottoms or on the ground.
The Mesia would seem to be a good liver in captivity. I
have heard of only six examples reaching this country, and all
the six are still alive and well.
Let me now take up the story of my own birds more
definitely.
For over a fortnight the two Mesias were kept in a flight-
cage in the house, to enable them to gather themselves together
a bit; and it was whilst they were thus detained, that is, as long
ago as the 14th July, 1902, that they were sketched for our
magazine by Mr. Gronvold ; and on the following day they were
loosed into the aviary.
During that year at least there was nothing more to be
expected of them than that they should pick up their strength and
become accustomed to their new surroundings and companions.
Months roiled on with, happily, no startling events to record of
them. Every night they were carefully housed in the bird-
room ; every day, except when cold, they would fly into and
spend in the garden ; and from time to time during the spring
of this year, much too earl}&amp;quot; to please me, they betrayed a dis-
position to go to nest.
In books I can find but little information about the
nesting habits of this species. Jerdon only says :--" Its manners
are very similar (to the Liothrix), and the nest has been brought
to me, with the eggs very like those of the last, but with the
spots less numerous"; and Mr. Frank Finn:--"The nest and
eggs are very similar to the Pekin Robin's."
On May 17th, I transferred my pair to the reserved aviary.

On the 26th they commenced building in a lime tree in the
centre. Last year's long shoots had not been lopped, but had
been wound round and round, and interwoven hither and
thither, so as to form a head. From this head the shoots of the
year grew up straight and fairly thick, as from a pollard. Of
this first nest I cannot say much; externally it had the
appearance of a bulky solid deep nest of hay, grasses, and dead
Virginia creeper ends, firmly fixed amongst the young shoots
some seven feet above the general level of the garden. Both
birds assisted in the building, the first materials carried being
the creeper, dragged from the growing plants, much force being
used when necessary. For five days the little architects were
greatly disturbed and discouraged by a succession of terrific
thunder-storms, accompanied by tropical torrents of rain.
Nevertheless they persevered with remarkable tenacity, duly
finished their work, and commenced sitting on the 7th June.
At first the female did most of the work, and perhaps on wet
daj^s; but, as soon as they had settled down, the male
customarily sat during the day, the female at early dawn, late
evening, and during the night, the male roosting elsewhere.
The newspapers had a good deal to say of the rain that
fell in London at this time ; and for some sixty hours before the
young were due to be hatched it came down without cessation.
Before the sixty hours were up, twenty-five million tons of rain
were reported to have fallen in Inner London ; and the cold for
the time of the year was intense, June 19th being reported as the
coldest June day on record. In our August number, Mr.
Meade-Waldo's interesting but most pathetic story tells our
Members how the wild birds suffered in this corner of England.
And yet these two Mesias stuck to their nest through it all.
How did they manage it! How could they have endured it? I
observed that during long spells of rain they relieved one another
on the nest at frequent intervals. On one occasion the female
came off so soaked and sodden it seemed impossible that she
could continue, but- she did, and I do not know that the trial,
although very severe, really injured their health ; but they were
well seasoned, and had been well taken care of and protected during
the winter vio?iths. Mr. Finn wrote me on August 20th :--"The

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
Mesias' want of pluck is interesting ; I have noticed the same
thing in Liothrix, which, however, makes up for it in presence
of mind! Iam not surprised they stand the rain well as the
Himalayas are rainy enough in all conscience. You should see
the great tresses of moss on the trees there!"
June 19th, about the day the eggs were due to be hatched,
was not only the coldest day but was likewise very wet ; the
male sat all the day, but I could not detect any signs of young.
On the 20th and 21st, both parents were feeding well, and
appeared to be carrying the food--only mealworms as far as I
could see; but day by day they seemed to be carrying less.
And I observed also how they allowed other birds, of which
there were too many, to come to the nest and inspect its contents,
making perhaps one dash at the intruder but not persevering.
The Yellow Sparrows, Passer luteus, whose home was close by,
were often sitting on the edge of the nest. On the 25th, I felt
and found there was then not less than one young bird alive, and
having satisfied myself on this point I hastily retreated ; and 011
that day at any rate the parents were carrying mealworms. But
the carrying became less frequent; and, on the 28th, on again
feeling, I found the nest quite empty, neither could I find the
slightest trace of eggs or young.
I left this nest as it was, as I wished not to disturb the
place. I tried, however, to drive the Yellow Sparrows out of
the aviary, but signally failed. The rain had caused the
vegetation and foliage to become so dense that I found myself
helpless ; and I had to have regard for other nests and could not
disturb the aviary overmuch.
On July 2, the Mesias were busy building in the same
tree, not much more than a foot from the first, but this nest,
instead of resting on the head of the tree, was slightly above it
and suspended among the upright shoots, and on the 7th they
commenced sitting; but they sat feebly, coming off for meal-
worms every time I entered the aviary ; and on the 12th the nest
was deserted. It contained but one egg (see figure of egg and
nest), which had the appearance of having been pecked in three
places. Perhaps the birds, weakened by their previous hard-

ships, had laid only one egg, but who had pecked it? or were
the " pecks" really claw-marks from nervous fear on the part of
the sitting-bird when cats invaded the aviary at night, and
stationed themselves, as I found them doing more than once,
directly over the nest ? It was suggestive that, although assist-
ing heartily in its construction, the male afterwards seemed to
take but little interest in it.
This nest I pulled down. There were other nests about,
the tree was pretty thick and I was unaware of any peculiarity in
its construction, it was rather a stretch and I wanted to retire as
quickly as possible, and I irreparably damaged its most interest-
ing feature. Several dead Virginia creeper ends had one end
laid along and fastened to the outside of the nest, and the other
bound to an upright shoot of the tree. This was uniform all
round the nest, which was thus firmly tied with hawsers to
various small boughs. In nests 1, 2, 3 and 5, the first materials
carried were invariably these ends of the creeper ; nest No. 3 is
also figured, but about two inches below it, in a fork, there was a
large mass of material, presumably a proposed foundation, but
which was never joined to the nest proper suspended above it.
But to return to No. 2. I had to use considerable force to
pull it from its position, thus breaking many of the " tentacles"
and displacing the others ; and it was further damaged before it
reached the hands of Mr. Seth-Smith, who most kindly photo-
graphed the egg and two of the nests for us. With the exception
of the creeper ends, and a few leaves at the bottom, it was con-
structed mostly of dead grasses of various kinds, with a lump or
two of the "hair" supplied in the nest-bags of the shop, the
lining of course being of much finer materials--no feathers. It
was solidly built, with much outside material, the following
being about the dimensions in inches of the nest proper, which
seemed to be a counterpart of the first nest:--Diameter varying
but about 5J, of the cup 2J; height ; depth of cup just over 2
inches ; thickness of wall at top inch. The egg is pinky-
white, with an irregular zone of red-brown blotches inclined to
yellow at the larger end, the latter being washed with yellow-
brown.
On July 14, the two birds were very busy building in a

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
scraggy holly, some four feet above the ground, but on the
following day they stopped work:--the nest had been appropriated
by a Crimson Finch. With much difficulty I succeeded in eject-
ing this slim, evil-tempered bird from the aviary, and also two
other " objectionables," and on the 16th had the satisfaction of
seeing that the Mesias had returned to duty. On the 19th, once
more they commenced sitting -- and stopped on the 25th. I
examined the nest and found it quite empty ; but both birds had
sat well, and I am certain that there had been eggs. Who was
the culprit ? A few days later I detected the female Violet
Tanager slipping out of the Yellow Sparrows' nest; and then it
flashed across my mind that on several occasions I had seen this
pair of "innocents" hovering about the other nests. To remove
a Violet Tanager is a simple matter ; one has but to take away the
banana, and within a couple of hours it will follow you like an
old ewe when one has her lamb in one's arms, so they were
quickly disposed of; and the Mesias were not afterwards dis-
turbed in the same way. This nest was practically suspended
from three branclilets of the holly, of about the thickness of a
pen-holder, which jutted out at an angle of some 45 degrees, to
two of which it was securely lashed. It was constructed of
grasses, very fine inside, with a few pieces of dead Virginia
creeper outside.
Nest No. 4 was commenced on July 26. This one was
built at the near end of the aviary, close to the general aviary, in
which there are birds of many kinds, some of them detested and
feared by the Mesias, who nevertheless deliberately set up house
thus close to them. Every evening these birds retire to the bird-
room, in which they are shut up that they may not disturb the
morning slumbers of my unsympathetic neighbours. But the
Burrowing Owls are then loosed; and one of the favourite
perches of the old male is close to the Mesias' nest. Moreover,
while the Mesias were sitting, the two baby Owls were growing
their flights, and, when loosed of an evening, their favourite
playground was a mound opposite the nest, on and from which
the} 7 would spring into the air again and again, trying their new
wings, and sporting about, full of youthful vigour and play, a
charming sight to behold--but liardty an attractive one to a

small timid sitting-bird one might suppose. To these nightly
honors must be added the wild shrill screams of the nervous
mother, uttered night or day at sight of man or beast. I feel
sure that in the choice of the sites of nests 3, 4 and 5 the fear of
the cats chiefly influenced them. Again, although No. 3 would
not have been entirely safe from a cat inside, No. 4 was perhaps
quite so. About 5^-ft. from the ground, it was suspended
between two outside twigs of a golden elder bush, on twigs so
unseasoned and unreliable that my first impulse was to destroy it
as unsuitable aud unsafe. However, I reasoned that every day
the wood would be getting more tough, aud I decided to leave it
alone. Above the nest, there were several layers of leafy
branchlets, which effectually concealed it from cats on the top of
the aviary.
On July 26 and on the morning of the 27th, there was
nothing but a rope ladder of hay, connecting two twigs about
four inches apart; but by the evening of the 27th the latter had
developed into a hammock suspended between the two twigs.
As the rains came down, the bindings of hay seemed to stretch
and appeared rotten ; aud occasionally I schemed with my eye
how best to arrange a support without disturbing the birds.
Happily the need for action did not arise ; the Mesias had done
their work well, so well that even when the wind blew hard the
nest never lost its level, but, with the sitting-bird upon it, was
tossed hither aud thither and high and low, without any mishap ;
aud now in September, discoloured, deserted and forlorn, it still
retains its position and bears testimony to the good work of the
clever Mesias. The position of this nest was delightful for me.
From the outer aviary I could at any time see if a bird were on ;
and from the path just inside, where I attended to the food and
water dishes, at a distance of about four feet, I had a good view
of the nest and could make my various observations.
On the 31st, observing signs, I felt in the nest and found
one cold egg. From that night they commenced to sit and, on
the following afternoon, being offered a chance which was not
repeated on the succeeding days, I again felt and found two
warm eggs. Now I could be certain that the birds were not
playing the fool, but I am perfectly certain that they were

doing so with the third nest. On August 13 there were no signs
of young, but on the following morning the mother asked in a
lukewarm way for a mealworm. Later in the day, however,
both birds were at me, and I knew that another Mesia had been
born into the world.

Ily W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S.
Readers of the Magazine will recollect an interesting
paper contributed a few years ago by Mr. Lascelles, describing
the hatching of two young Demoiselle Cranes by a pair then in
his possession at Lyndhurst. Unfortunately from various causes
these young ones came to grief, and I believe before another
breeding season came round one or both parent birds had been
killed by foxes. I have been more fortunate this summer, for a
pair of these Cranes which I have had for about six years have
reared two young, which are now fullgrown, or at least of the
same apparent size as the parents.
After laying eggs several times, which always proved
unfertile, the birds went to nest at the end of April this
year, but contrary to their usual custom laid, instead of two, only
a single egg. Partly on this account, and partly because the
weather was then particularly cold and unseasonable, I took this
egg, and the birds almost immediately selected another very
suitable site, five or six feet off a small stream, and laid two
eggs. There was no real nest, only a few short dead sticks,
perhaps half a handful, scattered loosely on the spot where the
eggs were deposited.
The first egg was laid on the 7th May, the second on the
9th, and the birds began to %it on the latter day.
Both parents, as they always have done, shared the task of
incubation, frequently changing places during the day. Though
really perfectly tame, these Cranes are very secretive when

was great, the female generally scrambling oyei the ground as il
injured, while the male would erect his ue&lt; k plumes, and do his
best to intimidate.
On June ,pd the young hirds could he heard, and next day
one egg was chipped. The first young one was hatched on June
5th. It spent most ol this day in the nest. Once we saw it
standing up about two feet away from the other egg, and the old
one was trying to coax it back. &apos;The next morning the second
little Crane was hatched. It stayed in the nest all day, one
parent brooding it, while the olhei one could walk a little, and
was sometimes two 01 three yards away, closely attended by tin*
second old bird. I saw the lallci once holding it's beak down to
the young one, apparently offering it some small insect, but
it did not then seem willing to feed. I decided, as there seemed
some risk of the little birds falling into the stream, to run a roll
ol nunow wire netting between them and the water, &apos;fins we
safely accomplished, my man nriauging the netting, while I
held the young birds in my hand, art we were .afraid ol the old
ones trampling upon them 111 theii excitement. The patents
soon settled down, and we left them for the rest ol th** day.
On the 7th, the Cranes took the young up a bank on to the
level pail ol the paddock, and at once began to forage Idi them in
the long grass, and &lt; at 1 ied to them a few mealworms which, baling
the supply of natural food might be insufficient, I threw to them.
The young birds were taken down tin* bank again at night and
were brooded close to the old nest. That was the last time that
they returned to the nest ; but for some weeks the young wei e
taken at dusk, or during the day if rain fell, to a diy place
under a beech tree, on the top of a bank, where the grass was
short. No belter roosting place in the field could have been
selected, and in this as in other ways the parents showed much
intelligence, as well as the greatest devotion and cap . As long
as th&apos;- young were feeble the old ones searched the long grass at
a distance of some yards, and brought each insec t separately to

the young, each parent attending to one young one. As
the young became stronger they would advance to meet
the approaching parent, and receive the insect. Finally
they promenaded the field in line np and down, the young
in the centre, and the two old birds on the flanks, each
picking the flies off the grass, and handing it to the young
one next to it, the latter taking it with great dexterity, so that
the progress of the quartette was scarcely delayed. By degrees
the young might be seen making pecks at insects settled on
the grass in front of them as they advanced. But it was not till
the 23rd June that I saw the young pick anything for themselves
off the ground (mealworms).
At this time the bird first hatched appeared twice as large
as the other. It's twenty-four hours start seemed to give it a
great advantage over the other, and it probably did get more
than its share of food so long as they received everything from
the parents' bills. At this date (August 24th) it has quite grown
up to the other, and there seems no appreciable difference in
point of size. F&apos;or the first twelve da&amp;gt; T s I believe the young
lived entirely upon insects captured on the grass stems and
foliage, and 011 a very few mealworms, occasionally thrown to
them. Small earthworms, yolk of egg, etc., the parents would
not offer to the young, but devoured themselves. On the 18th
I saw the old birds give the young some meal and even grains
of w'heat, and from this time they throve and grew rapidly.
The young Demoiselle differs from the other immature
Cranes that I have seen in that the plumage is not fawn or
sandy-coloured at any period, but grey, though duller, and less
silvery, than that of the adult.
The cheeks are white, but, as Blvth says in his Monograph,
the eartufts are " only slightly indicated," and the elongated
tertiaries, and pendent breastplumes so ornamental in the adult
are at this early age not noticeable.
The risk of trying to keep Cranes unpinioned was
exemplified in this instance. These young birds couid fly before
their quill-feathers were fully grown. Cousequentljq though

time, it was insufficient to prevent the birds from getting
up into the air, or even soaring. I was away from home
at the time, but I was told that it was a pretty sight to see these
two birds flying round in a circle with a diameter of almost a
mile, at times 150 yards up in the air, from which elevation the}&apos;'
fortunately always descended to alight near their distracted
parents. I11 the end, with some difficulty, they were captured,
and the feathers which had completed their growth were further
shortened. So the birds are now safe until we have time to
properly pinion them.

By Miss R. Alderson.
I think most aviculturists who have at last bred a
beautiful bird after many disappointments will understand the
pleasure I feel in my pair of young Violet Doves. The old birds
had failed over and over again to rear any j&apos;oung ones until at
last I felt so disheartened that whenever I saw my Violets
nesting I determined not to hope nor to expect any success.
I obtained my first pair of these Doves in October, 1901,
at a cost of 25/- the pair, and I believe the gentleman from whom
I got them had double that sum offered him for them after he
had sold them to me. I have never seen this Dove offered for
sale by a bird dealer, and the few specimens I have heard of in
this country have been imported through private enterprise. I
believe my hen is now the only hen left in England, unless one
of ray young birds proves to be the same sex. Even in their own
country, the West Indies, these Doves are not common.
In colouring, the Violet Dove is very lovely. It is stoutly
built, but very shapely. In size, about the same size as a
Bleeding-heart Dove.
* The name "Violet Dove" is more properly applied to Geotrygon violacca than to the f
present species.--E d.

Miss R. Anderson,
The back is olive brown ; the throat, breast, and under-
parts pure white; the front of the head greyish; the neck so
metallic as to look almost phosphorescent; the feet and legs
crimson ; eyes bright and very expressive ; the shoulder-butts
(as in No. 3 photograph of the old cock) pure white ; on each
side of the top part of the breast a large patch of maroon, shading
in a most exquisite way, into the white breast.
When the cock Violet Dove is cooing to the hen is the
time to see his gorgeous neck at its full beauty, for he puffs out
his feathers and bows very low, with his beak almost touching
the ground, thus showing the brightest part of his plumage to
the best advantage. The Bleeding-heart Dove, on the contrary,
throws himself back to show off the blood red patch on his
breast. The hen Violet Dove is rather smaller than the cock,
and her neck is less metallic. These Doves are very lightly
feathered, and the least touch will bring out their soft plumage.
And now having told you what my Violet Doves are like,
I must continue their story. The first pair of birds I had could
not fly, each one having a slightly drooping wing. One of them
broke its leg sometime later, I think through catching a claw
in some way, and after lingering a few days it died. I wrote to
my friend to see if he could replace it, and found he had several
Violet Doves left from another importation, and in March, 1902,
I procured from him a cock bird.
This last Dove was a particularly large and lovely
specimen and had been hand-reared by the natives. To my great
disappointment he would not take to my other bird, perhaps
because she could not fly, and to my alarm the new-comer began
to pine away. I bitterly regretted I had not procured his
original mate, and wrote to see if it was still possible to get her,
but found she had been already sold with the rest of the Violet
Doves to a lady in Germany. The next month, however, my
friend received one odd bird, the only one living out of a large
consignment, all the remaining birds having died, owing to
neglect and delay in their delivery after landing in England. I
thankfully accepted the offer of this one bird, though I did not
know its sex, and my friend warned me it was in terrible
plumage, though health}&apos;.

On Nesting of the White-fronted or Violet Dove. 395
This poor little Violet Dove had evidently suffered much
from the attacks of its companions on the voyage, for it was
literally almost featherless, and when I drew it out of the basket
it felt more flesh and bone than anything else. I have only once
seen a bird in worse plumage. Fortunately it was very strong
and healthy, and with care and quiet its feathers soon grew
again, though it was a little time before I could introduce the
new-comer to my cock.
The latter was looking very lonely. He would spend
most of his time sitting on a perch, his feet hidden in his
feathers, and his beak buried in his breast, giving utterance now
and then to a plaintive hoo, hoo, hoo . hoo, and then relapsing
into dejection again.
Very fortunately the last Violet Dove turned out to be a
hen ; and the joy of " Narcissus," (as we had nick-named the
cock,) when "Bessie" was put into his aviary was very great, and
he at once began cooing and bowing to the ground.
I pass over an account of my Violet Doves' failures in
1902. Nest after nest was made and fertile eggs laid with no
success : every time my hopes were defeated.
This year the Violets began nesting so early that, by the
middle of February, I was obliged to tie them up a nest basket
(the nests had been removed during the winter) as one or two
eggs had been already laid and broken. It was either a choice
of doing this or separating the birds, and the latter course I did
not care to adopt as they were so devoted to each other. The
Doves sat well, and I began to hope for success, but was very
disappointed one day to find a gnawed and broken egg on the
aviary floor. The egg was very large and full in shape, and of
course, like most Doves' eggs, pure white.
At first I thought I would take the Violets out and put
them into another aviary, but I suspected they might possibly
have a second egg, as they refused to leave the nest. It turned
out that this surmise was right. The birds continued to sit
steadily, both being generally on the nest together, for they were
so devoted to each other they would not keep apart. On March

broken egg with a strong and healthy young one dead inside
just due to hatch. The shell looked gnawed in the same w r ay as
the first egg, and a part of it was missing.
Again the Violets nested, this time in a Parrots' wooden
nesting box. One egg got broken, and the other shared the same
fate when just due to hatch. I thought the Doves might be the
culprits themselves, but one day the real offender was caught in
the very act. On April 24th the hen Violet laid an egg on a
shelf that runs along the front of the aviary, and a tiny
Combasou was discovered pecking the egg and driving away a
second bird that tried to do the same. On examining this egg I
found it had been gnawed in just the same way as the other
eggs had been.
I decided at once to take the Violet Doves away and put
them into another aviary; they are very steady birds and did
not much mind being caught, and settled down well in their new
home.
In this aviary were a pair each of Half-collared Turtles
and Necklace Doves, several Picui Doves, a Shamah, and a
Half-moon Parrakeet. Two days after the Violets were moved
they took to a fresh nest. I put up an especially large wicker
one, so that both birds could sit in it at once without fear of the
eggs being rolled out.
Again tu ? o eggs were laid, and again I had to record a
failure. One egg was found broken on the floor containing a
fine young bird, and on May 14th, four days later, a second
beautiful young one was found dead (if I remember rightly) in
the nest. I could only conclude the old birds had smothered it
through sitting on the nest together, and for this there seemed
no remedy, though we tried putting the odd bird in the next
aviary, w'here the pair could see her.
The Violets were verj^ undaunted, for in less than a week
they were nesting again. This time the birds were at last
successful. I11 the second week in June the young Violet Doves
were hatched, and though the parents guarded them very
closely, yet I could tell the young w r ere alive as I saw them,
through the wicker work of the nest, moving inside it. As a
general rule, if there are two young Doves in a nest they are

cock and hen, and the former is the first out of the nest. This
may be taken as a general guide, though of course there are
exceptional cases. On June 24th the first young Violet Dove
ventured out of the nest. It must have been then at least a
fortnight old. The parents were in a great state of excitement,
and while "Narcissus" was left to guard the little daughter,
"Bessie" took the small sou into her sole charge. She was
intensely proud of him, and, though really a cpiiet and good-
tempered bird, in her anxiety over the young one she
became very irritable towards the other birds in the aviary.
You may imagine my pleasure in handling at last a
living baby Violet Dove. I had been away from home and only
returned the day after the young bird had left the nest. I found
it very snug and happy in a very large (lidless) box, on a bed of
hay. My brother had very thoughtfully put it in this place of
safety, and the little thing looked quite at home there. I know,
to my cost, the risks that young birds run when just out of the
nest and unprotected in an aviary. They may be drowned in
baths of water, or they may be plucked and half killed by some
other bird. Sometimes, if different pairs of Doves quarrel, they
will torment each others' youngones--and perhaps even kill them.

I believe it is not generally known, and certainly it was a
new fact to me, that Doves are not exclusively vegetarians*
In August 1902 Mr. T L. Bonstow, a gentleman from
South Africa who was visiting England to complete his education
as an engineer, wrote to me under cover as follows :--
" Drar Sir,--I am pleased to be able to inform you that I have
brought from the Cape Colony a pair of Tambourine Pigeons and a hen
Bronze-wing Pigeon (Chalcopelia afra)\ with which I intend to present
you; will you kindly give me your address so that I can arrange to let
you have them, that is if you care to accept them : I should like to
see you."

Dr. A. G. Butler,
Naturally I cared very much, and shortly afterwards Mr.
Bonstow brought the birds to my house, and I turned them into
one of my bird-room aviaries.
At first the male Tambourine Dove neglected his wife ;
but ardently courted the Emerald Dove, pairing with her though
without result ; I therefore removed her to another aviary.
Shortly afterwards the male bird made overtures to his own hen,
bitt she invariably scurried away at his approach ; nevertheless
she dropped several cream-coloured eggs from a branch, of
course smashing them.
I now hung up a sponge-basket near the ceiling, partly
filled it up with one of Mr. Abrahams' plaited Doves' nests, and
supplied twigs and hay, with which the Tambourine Doves
formed a little natural nest on the top of the other. Unfortunately
the slope of the basket and the fact that the doves had nearly
filled the remaining space, made it possible for the eggs to be
knocked out on to the floor and smashed.
I next substituted a little upright wicker basket (the lid
of which I had replaced by wire hooks to enable me to suspend
it) removing the natural nest to it. The doves took readily to
the new receptacle, two eggs were laid, and the birds took turns
to sit for twenty-six days, but without result.
It was while this fruitless incubation was proceeding that
I first saw the hen on the floor of the aviary, breaking up and
swallowing a cockroach. When she had finished this strange
meal, I went and got her a mealworm, which she hurried to
seize, with the same eagerness that a purely insectivorous bird
would show.
Shortly afterwards these doves went to nest again, sitting
steadily for seventeen days, but again without hatching ; and,
during the incubation, the hen devoured mealworms whenever I
threw them to her; and doubtless such small cockroaches as
strayed into the aviary, although I did not catch her in the act.
Mr. Seth-Smitli having told me that, in his opinion, I
should do no good in breeding doves, until I built an aviary in
the garden, enclosing growing trees ; I set a carpenter to work

and put one up (length 22 feet, width 9 feet 6 inches, height at
ridge 14 feet) enclosing two trees reaching to the centre of the
roof, one or two young trees, a lot of ferns and other plants, to
which I added some creepers : trees, bushes, and creepers
surround the aviary on three sides.
When the aviary was completed, the Tambourines had
just started sitting the third time: I therefore turned out a pair
of the Australian Green-winged Dove (Chalcophaps chrysochlora ),
but unfortunately discovered that the hen had lost the use of her
wings during her moult, so that she found it difficult even to
reach the lower branches of a fir-tree in the aviary, and spent
nearly the whole of her time on the ground. One day, as I was
watching her, I saw her seize a worm which had crawled on to
the path, shake it to pieces, and swallow each fragment as it was
disconnected, until the whole had been devoured.
Since then I have introduced the Tambourine Doves to
the same aviary : they agree perfectly with the Green-wings;
but they are too pleased to be able to fly freely in the open air,
to trouble about breeding.
Miss Alderson, who has had more experience in dove-
breeding than most of our members, majr perhaps be able to tell
us whether it is the hens alone of the Columbce which feed upon
insects and worms; and whether they have this peculiarity only
in the season when they are either breeding, or ready to
breed.*
Although I have not noticed the habit in other species, I
should think it hardly likely that it was limited to the Bronze-
wings and their allies : perhaps however it may be a peculiarity
of those doves which pass a good deal of their time on the
earth, unlike the so-called Ground-doves, which as a rule only
come down to feed. Such birds as Phlogoenas and Guira ought
strictly to be called Ground-pigeons, not Zcnaida and Leptoptila
which spend nearly all their time among branches.
* We have seen a male Bronze-winged Pigeon (P/taps chalcopterci) swallow large
earthworms ; and the Bleeding-heart Dove (Phlogcenas luzonica ) readily devours meal-
worms.--E d.

On Reeve Breeding in Confinement.
REEVE {Pavoncella pugnax ) BREEDING IN
CONFINEMENT.
By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S.
A Reeve, one of two, which with a Ruff inhabits one of
my aviaries, where they have been for some four years, has
reared three young this summer. This Reeve has more than once
previously nested, but her eggs have always been disturbed by
other occupants of the aviary ; though last year one young one
was hatched, but it never completely freed itself from the shell,
and soon died. The Reeve forsook her first clutch this spring,
having been interfered with, as we thought, by some inquisitive
Nutcrackers. But by the time she laid again the grass was well
grown up, and the nest escaped notice. Seeing that the bird
was sitting very steadily I removed most of the other birds,
including a Landrail and some Stouecurlews, which I thought
might be dangerous companions.
The young were hatched on June 25th, and at once left
the nest. There was at this time a great deal of cover, including
rank grass, in the aviary, and it was not easy to see the young,
especially as the mother always kept repeating the alarm note
when one was near ; but by patiently watching, especially in the
evenings, they could sometimes be seen climbing about the
tussocks and bunches of grass, often several inches off the
ground, picking off flies and minute insects ; while the parent
kept guard, driving off any other bird that came too near,
including the Ruff, who met with no more consideration than
the others.
Though the foodpans were kept well supplied, we could
not see that at that time they were ever visited by the young birds,
though the parent fed freely from them. There is no doubt that
the little ones supported themselves entirely on what insects they
picked up, without any assistance or guidance from the old bird.
Until they became fledged, the young crept about, and
squatted so closely, that we had to use the greatest caution in
moving about in the aviary. As soon as they were fledged (they

could fly on July 15th), they ceased to squat, and began to run
off when disturbed, and took no pains to hide themselves.
They are now (August 24th) as perfect as wild birds, and
seem of the same size as the mother, so I fear they are all females.
If one or more had been a Ruff, it would have been interesting
to notice whether later on they would at all have resembled their
male parent, who each spring assumes a handsome black and
chestnut nuptial dress.
Although I am aware that the Reeve has occasionally laid
in aviaries, this is the first time, so far as I know, that young of
this species have been reared in confinement in this country.

The beautifully-illustrated work published by Messrs.
Brumby and Clarke some few years ago under the title of British
Birds zvith their nests and eggs hardly met with the amount of
support it deserved from the hands of British ornithologists. It
is true that of the making of books on British birds there is no
end, but this work was unique in that the different species were
admirably figured zvith their nests, and a most beautiful series of
coloured plates of the eggs of every species was also given, all
the illustrations being by Mr. Frohawk. Another point, in our
opinion in favour of the work, was that it was not the production
of one man only, but the various families were separately
treated by authorities who were especially capable of dealing
with them.
Perhaps the most useful part of the work above referred to
consisted of the full and concise notes on the nests and eggs,
together with the unequalled series of plates of not only the
typical eggs, but also of the numerous varieties.
It is satisfactory to find that the Publishers have been
persuaded to re-issue the magnificent series of coloured plates

Sir ,--Re colour of eggs of the Green Singing Finch. I see in the
August number, Dr. Butler calls attention to the variability of the
colouring.
At the time my Serin Finches were nesting, Zebra Finches were the
only other birds that I had put up for breeding, and as far as I can recollect
the eggs were the same colour as those of the Chestnut-eared Finch. Had
they differed in marking it would have attracted my attention, for at that
time these were the only birds that I had tried my 'prentice hand on. I
had no idea that they were difficult to get to breed--had not long taken up
Foreign Birds--had no Bird Book--used to saw away one-quarter of a
cocoa nut shell, ram in part of a cow hair and moss nest, wire it into a
canary breeding cage, and the birds took to it with very little altering, and
reared a family.
But this is going away from the subject, and I can look back twenty
years, and go over again the pride I felt when I first saw the youngsters in
the nest. It was in exactly six weeks that a precocious ' mother's darling'
made his or her first appearance before the public, and sang so sweet a
song. It is only those devoted lovers of birds that can understand what my
feelings were, when I first heard those beautiful notes.
I fear, Mr. Editor, in my enthusiasm I have got off the track, and
must crave your indulgence and pardon.

Since receiving the birds most of the huff feathers have been moulted and
chocolate coloured ones have grown. The song resembles that of the
Cordon Bleu, but is longer, and instead of being shrill is very sweet; in
fact, it is almost exactly like that of the Blue Waxbill ( Estrilda angolensis)
which I also have. Both male and female Violet-eared Waxbills sing, but
the song of the female is weak. When singing both sexes hold a straw in
the beak and dance sideways in jumps down the perch. At the same time
I received a pair of Red-faced Finches {Pytelia cifra), and a young bird sup-
posed to be of the same kind (it does not look quite the same). The adult
Red-faced Finch does not sing at present, but the attempts of the young
bird to sing are like those of a young Canary, and some notes are quite
loud and not in the least like those of Waxbills. Can you tell me what
Pytelia melba is like ? I am giving all these birds a few fresh ants' eggs
every day. Do you consider these too fattening ?
A male Avadavat and a male Silverbill, which we have had for five
years, are inseparable companions; this year they have made a nest in
which they sleep, and at present they are taking turns in sitting on one egg
which was laid in their nest by a Gouldian Finch.
R. S. Vivian.
&apos; The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Vivian:
Although Holub says (see Foreign Finches in Captivity, new ed., p.
123) that the Violet-eared Waxbill resembles the Weavers and Whydahs in
its change of plumage, it struck me that he might have been misled by
seeing the change from the young into the adult plumage: therefore, know-
ing that Mr. Phillipps had a male of this species, I wrote to him. He
replied: " I obtained an adult male Violet-eared Waxbill on the 26th May,
1902; it is still with me and in faultless condition.
" I have never noticed ain T seasonal change of plumage, nor anything
that would lead me to suppose that one exists.
" Mrs. Vivian's bird was probably moulting from the immature to the
adult plumage."
The 011I3&apos; Waxbill which, to my knowledge, exhibits seasonal changes
of plumage is the Amaduvade.
Zonogastris melba is altogether a duller coloured bird than Pytelia
afra* ; the back more olive-tinted, the crimson parts duller, the grey of the
head darker, more slaty, and extending over the ear-coverts (which are
crimson in P. afra) ; the breast spotted with white and barred with black
and white; in P. afra it is simply barred with white which, in that species,
continues on to the abdomen, whereas Z. melba has the abdomen white.
A. G. Butler.
* The scarlet face, and spotted and barred under-parts of Zonogastris melba cer-
tainly give it the appearance of a more brightly coloured bird than Pytelia a/ra.--&apos;ED.

FLAMINGOES.
The following letter was forzvarded to Airs. Gregory in reply to an
inquiry :
I think you might safely embark in Flamingoes, and that you would
be pleased with them. But I would not recommend them to anyone who
has not a pond, or bit of shallow water, in which they can stand all day,
for that is their habit. In cold weather the}&apos; might be walked iuto a shed
for the night, and in the case of frost and snow that would be necessary, for
they are very helpless, and slip about most uncomfortably upon ice. I do
not think that they are at all affected by cold, except that they are unhappy
if they are compelled to stand upon ice, or slippery snow. (It is not at all
w&apos;hat one would expect, but this is my experience, and I have heard the
same from others who have kept these birds.)
They will thrive upon grain of all kinds, maize, oats, barley, wheat,
but the last is their favourite.
I have given shrimps, as is done in the Zoological Gardens, but I do
not find it necessary. My six birds have not had any shrimps for over a
year. The best way to feed Flamingoes is to place their grain in a pail of
water, and to mount the pail up so that ducks or other birds cannot rob
them. Leave the grain in as long as possible to soften.
I think you will find peat moss litter better than straw to lay on the
floor of the shed. It is absorbent, and a deodorizer. The Flamingoes
should have something soft (like the moss litter) to stand 011 when they are
not in the water.
They are most inoffensive birds, and not at all noisy, only occasionally
making a croaking noise if squabbling over their food, etc.

Sir, --I should be much obliged if you could give me some advice
about a Greater Hill Mynah (Indian). He eats well and his plumage is
fairly good, but one toe of each foot is very much inflamed and very tender.
I have had the bird three years, during which time his feet have never
been right though I have never known them quite as bad as they are now.
I have bathed them in hot milk and put on tincture of myrrh without
success. Could you tell me of any lotion I might apply? The bird is fed
on boiled rice, potato, currants and carrots, and I am most careful to see
that the perch is kept dry and clean.
I should also like to know the name of any good Parrot food for a
small Australian Yellow-crested Cockatoo.
E. Kirkwood.
The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Kirkwood.
I think it quite possible that the inflamed condition of the Mynah's
feet is due to incorrect feeding.
I have, at various times, kept the Greater Hill Mynah, the Common
Mynah, the Malabar, and the Crested Mynah, the last being still in good
health. I have come to the conclusion that these birds should be fed upon
'Century Food ' or its equivalent; grapes, oranges, or pears; insects, but
especially cockroaches or grasshoppers; and a very little raw meat once a
week : on this food they do splendidly.
I should nevertheless recommend you to bathe the bird's feet in fairly
hot water and afterwards in a weak solution of chloride of zinc : this
should be done at least twice a day until the bird recovers.
As regards your question about a good general "Parrot Food"; the
thing is a hopeless impossibility, and nobody who knew anything about
parrots and had their interests at heart would have the effrontery to put
such a thing on the market.
Cockatoos do well on a mixture of maize, oats, wheat, dari, hemp,
nuts, fruit, raw carrot, plain dry biscuit; pure water only to drink.

near the seed pan. It looked like a large blue-bottle fly and we could not
imagine what it was. It was not a little Fire-fincli, nor a Bib-finch. It was
too small for a Cordon Bleu,
" We tried to find the nest it had tumbled from, but in vain ; so I
placed it on some cotton wool and left it, hoping its parents would look
after it. It was still alive but cold and miserable the next morning. I
warmed it and tried to give it a drop of milk, but it would not open its
beak and it lingered on till the afternoon and then died.
"That same afternoon I saw another little mite hopping and chirping,
but I then succeeded in finding its nest where an egg and another nestling
were snugly hidden. I put it back and it stopped there for the night.
Next morning the two nestlings were on the ground again and I found it
no use to replace them in the nest, for they only tumbled out again, so I
put them in a quiet corner and after a while the parents went to look at
them.
"The parents are a cock rhodopyga and a hen grey astrild. The nest-
lings have a rusty red band across the wing, white gapes, and though the
beak is small there is a great length from the scalp to the beak. They wag
their tiny tails and are now beginning to fly. The feathers are not fluffy
but rather oily which retards their flight.
" The egg is white and small. The nest is built of grass neatly woven
into a large ball, over which other equally large balls are placed : perhaps
several pairs take apartments in the same house ? They do not build in
bushes, but on the ground in a corner; and if possible behind a bush, or a
broom, or any hiding place. This particular nest was built on a shelf under
some heather and leaning on a nest-box. I hope the young birds will live,
and wonder if the) 7 will have black beaks like the father or red ones like
their mother. The little mother has her breast nearly bare of feathers,
whether from sitting or from pluming herself to garnish her nest I do not
know.
"I thought this report might interest you and perhaps it would
interest Mr. Pliillipps. I have found a dead nestling of unknown deriva-
tion and a fine black egg of the size almost of the paddy bird's and don't
know where they came from, unless it belongs to the Passer luteus.&amp;quot;
I felt sure Mr. Pliillipps would agree with me that it would be selfish
to keep these breeding-notes to ourselves, for I am satisfied that they will
be equally interesting to others.

Sir, --I am sending you a few notes to supplement Mr. L. M. Seth-
Smith's interesting account of the breeding of the Black-breasted Quail in
captivity.
My pair were turned into an outdoor aviary the end of April last ;
towards the end of May I noticed a slight scratching in a corner of the
Medal of the Society.

Correspondence , Notes, etc.
aviary lined with a few grass stalks; an egg was laid on June 2nd, and one on
each of the six succeeding days when the hen commenced to sit, hatching
out six young ; these seemed going on well, but the lieu spent half her time
watching and chasing away the cock bird ; on the morning of the fifth day
I found the hen alone and the six young dead in different parts of the
aviary.
On July 12th, I noticed another nest close by the old one and on the
i6tli an egg was laid, the hen laying eight altogether, after which I
removed the cock bird. The hen sat splendidly and hatched eight young ;
these, with the exception of a weakly one, which died during very stormy
weather, are now (September 3rd) strong healthy birds--a little smaller than
the hen--the black feathers are showing in the throats of the cock birds.
The period of incubation was eighteen days in each case.
I have not the least doubt in my own mind that this bird is a polyga-
mous species, and that the young of the first clutch were either killed by the
cock or the hen was driven off from brooding the young at night and they
perished from cold. I should imagine Mr. Seth-Smith's perished in the
same way.

THE RACKET-TAILED PARROT.
In the few notes written to accompany the coloured plate of
Prioniturusplaturus in the Magazine last month, I mentioned that I had
been informed that a member of this Society was privately importing some
Racket-tails from the Philippines, but I added a footnote to the effect that
all had died on the voyage. I am, however, very glad to find that I was
misinformed on the latter point and that Mrs. Johnstone, the member
referred to, has one Racket-tailed Parrot alive at the present time, which
proves to be a specimen of P. discurus, a species which is most probably
absolutely unknown in this country in a living state.
D. Srth-Smith.

RULES.
Kach bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. No
replies can be sent by post.
Pennant Parrakeet. (Mr. Rudkin). [Bird died of apoplexy. Your
feeding seems very fattening to my mind. The hemp, sunflow'er and
nuts all contain a large quantity of oil, and if you give them alter-
nately as a change this would be quite sufficient. You do not mention
green food. They should certainly have some. It was a lien].
Avadavat. (The H011. Mrs. Carpenter). [Concussion of the brain
caused death. The point of beak had evidently been brought in
contact with some hard object].
Goldfinch. (Mrs. Robertson). [Bird died of enteritis. This is very
common in grey-pates during the process of seeding off, and is
usually due to the indigestible food (dried seeds) being substituted for
the natural succulent seeds, and possibly a moderate amount of fruit
and insects].
Bronze Mannikin. (Miss Appleton). [Death was due to an apoplectic
fit. It was a lien].
Fire-FINCH. (Miss Thomas). [Acute inflammation of liver caused death.
Am unable to say cause of death of the hen, but there are no traces
of infectious disease in bird sent me].
Bicheno Finch (nestling). (Mr. N. S. O'Reilly). The nest was in a bush,
not under cover. [Pneumonia was cause of death, in all probability
produced by wet and cold weather].

Dove. (The Hon. Mrs. Hodgson). [Cerebral haemorrhage caused death
by pressure on the brain. Possibty caused by fright].
Red-faced Finch. (Mrs. Robertson). [The bird died of enteritis which
has no appearance of being the contagious form. The featherless
condition is possibly caused by some one or more of its companions
pecking at the feathers. The best way is to watch and remove the
offender or offenders. Many of the small finches acquire this habit
when caged, and if they were turned into a large aviary would, in all
probability, soon feather].
Grey Singing-finch. (Mr. Simpson). [Concussion of braiu was the
cause of death, but I should scarcely think the injury was caused bv
a bird, as too large a surface of the cranial cavity was involved. It
was a hen]. -
Orange-cheeked Waxbiel. (Miss Shepherd). [Acute inflammation of
liver and jaundice. It is not infectious],
