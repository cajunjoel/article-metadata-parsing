It is proposed to publish under this heading a series of
articles, by different authors, upon some of the species, both
British and foreign, which are comprised in this sub-family.
As a rule, two articles will be published each month during the
current year, one of which will deal with a British and the other
with a foreign species, but no attempt will be made to observe
any scientific arrangement in the order in which the articles will
appear. The classification adopted by Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe
in the British Museum "Catalogue of Birds" will be adhered
to, but it must not be inferred that all the writers who contribute
to this series necessarily approve of that classification.
The Fringillince or True Finches form one of the three
sub-families into which the Family Fringillidce is divided. The
other two sub-families being the Coccothraustin&amp;lt;z or Grosbeaks,
and the Emberizince or Buntings. These sub - families are
distinguished by differences in the shape of the skull.
It is hoped that by placing British and foreign species in
juxtaposition their close relationship may be better realised, and
the artificial character of the distinction between British and
foreign birds more clearly perceived.

Pinicola enucleator, Finn.
By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
This is a circumpolar species, occurring principally in the
forests of conifers in the north of both Old and New Worlds.
The colouring of the adult Pine Grosbeaks is very pleasing: :
the general ground-tint being ash-grey, but the feathers of the.
crown, sides of face and rump almost wholly vinous rose-coloured

in the male, and orange-golden in the female ; the remaining
feathers above and below, with the exception of those of the
belly, thighs, and under tail-coverts, more or less broadly
bordered in the male with vinous-rose, and in the female with
golden ; another peculiarity, which seems to be frequently
overlooked by describers, is that in the male the feathers of the
mantle and back are marked just behind their rosy fringes by
ill-defined blackish V-shaped characters ; the wing-coverts and
inner secondaries are broadly bordered with white, the tips of
the lesser coverts in the male slightly tinted with rose : the wings
and tail, apart from the borders already noted, smoky blackish
with very narrow pale edges, rosy on the primaries ; beak,
blackish-brown ; feet, nearly black ; iris of eye, hazel. Imma-
ture males, and males which have been kept in cages, resemble
the females, but the golden of the head and rump is less orange
in immature birds.
Scientific ornithologists have introduced this species into
the British list on the ground that five * examples have been
obtained, within a period extending over something like twenty-
three years, at sea-ports or within easy reach of the sea. When
it is remembered that the Pine Grosbeak is a common cage-bird
in Canada ; and sufficiently pleasing, when in full colour, to be
attractive to sailors; although less likely to satisfy them when
{owing to close confinement) the glory has departed from the
plumage; the only wonder is that at least fifty have not fallen to
that impulse said to be natural to true-born Britons in fine
weather--" Lovely day! Let's go and kill something."
The nest of the Pine Grosbeak is usually placed on a
thick branch of spruce-fir, or birch, close to the main stem and at
a distance of from ten to twelve feet from the ground ; it is some-
what like a large edition of that of the Bullfinch, the outer frame-
work consisting of slender twigs of fir and the inside of fine
grass-bents, roots, and hair-lichen. The eggs number from
three to four, of a pale turquoise blue colour, with deep purplish-
brown or blackish spots, and greyer brown shell-spots ; they
vary much in the same manner as eggs of the Bullfinch.
During the winter months this species is gregarious in its
habits, and is so tame that it is easily caught or shot, but in the
summer the flocks break up for breeding purposes and the birds
are then somewhat more shy, though never so much so as our
Bullfinch.
* Formerly the number recorded was twenty-five; this was subse-
quently reduced to five; and (after further investigation) Mr. Howard
Saunders is only disposed to admit one; which is also open to doubt.

The song in the wild bird is said to be very melodious and
flute-like, the flight powerful and undulating. It is a true bird
of the woods and a somewhat late breeder : it feeds on seeds of
conifers, berries, and buds, as well as inserts and their larvae, and
earth-worms.
About July 20th, I received a letter from Mr. James H,
Fleming, of Ontario, in which he informed me that he was send-
ing off a box containing six Pine Grosbeaks and a Purple Finch,
under the care of Mr. J. B. Williams (Curator of the Montreal
Natural History Society). I received this kind present on July
23rd; all the birds reaching me alive, though very dirty and a
good deal the worse for quarrelling during their fortnight of
close confinement.
I turned the Pine Grosbeaks out into my garden aviary,
giving them a seed-mixture, consisting of sunflower, hemp, oats,
canary and millet: I found that they ate these seeds in the
order given above, beginning with the sunflower; they did not
seem to care about the millet. During the first two or three
da}^s they washed almost incessantly, so that whenever I looked
at them I was sure to see one or two bedraggled looking, soaked
individuals.
By the end of the first week my birds were clean, though
ragged, and five of them appeared to be in excellent health :
seeing them eating worms which had crawled from below their
water-pan, I dug some up and offered them ; they seemed much
pleased and quarrelled for them. I also found that they were
very glad to get caterpillars and spiders.
Shortly afterwards, Mr. Williams called upon me, and
seemed gratified to find the Grosbeaks well and contented : in
the course of conversation, he unfortunately told me that, in
Canada, the favourite food of the Pine Grosbeak consisted of
berries of the Mountain Ash. Next morning, I put a bunch of
these berries into the aviary and two of the birds immediately
flew down and devoured them : by the evening both birds were
staggering about as if frightfully drunk ; when they flew towards
a perch they missed it and fell heavily to the ground ; if I
entered the aviary the}^ seemed scared almost out of their wits;
although, naturally, they are the tamest and most gentle birds I
ever had, utterly devoid of fear ; now they dashed wildly and
blindly against the wires, fell to the ground, staggered up and
flew off again madly ; they had constant diarrhoea, were unable
to see their seed, tumbled into the water, had fits every few
minutes, and after two or three days of misery died. It is.

therefore, clear that berries of the mountain ash are deadly
poison to captive Pine Grosbeaks.
With August, came heavy and almost incessant rains, and
this did not seem to suit my Canadian birds ; so that by the end
of the month a third had died in a rapid decline: it was a young
male in hen plumage. As I write, therefore, I have three birds
left, an adult male in rose plumage, a female and (I suspeCt) a
young male : the}?&apos; are in moult and may be unable to stand our
sloppy climate ; but while they live they are charming, though
formidable to look at, being as large as Blackbirds, with stout beaks
like our Bullfinch/ 11 Doubtless, they could bite severely if they
pleased, but even when they are ill and y&apos;ou pick them up, they
do not attempt to use their beaks, but merely utter their plain-
tive call:-- eer; eer, eer, eer.
The song, so far as I have heard it hitherto, is very low-
pitched ; a sort of liquid warbling ; but it is probable that this is
merely practice (usually known as recording) : the birds will sit
and sing on a branch within six or eight inches of 3&apos;our head as
you stand in the aviary, and will take sunflower-seeds, cater-
pillars, or spiders from your fingers. If 3 7 ou walk outside the
aviary one of them, at least, is certain to fly down to a ledge and
run or skip along beside you as you go, looking up sideways and
even occasionally reminding you with its eer , eer , that it would
like a dainty. Then, if you begin to dig, the bird quietly watches
until you have found a worm and, without the least excitement,
takes it from your fingers.
Sometimes two birds get hold of the same worm and
quietly tug until it divides in the centre ; they do not appear
even to dispute with any violence ; a grimace, after the fashion
of our Bullfinch, is usually enough : but the condition of the
birds when I first received them, with bare crowns and many
gaps in wing and tail-feathers, was evidence enough to prove that
the Pine Grosbeak can make himself objectionable if he chooses.
My conclusions, after brief experience, therefore, may be
summed up as follows: The Pine Grosbeak is the tamest and most
confiding of all finches, he is too lazy to be nervous, or spiteful ;
if you offer him a finger, he will taste the end with his tongue,
but will not bite it ; if he gets a sunflower-seed jammed in his
upper mandible, he will let you put your finger in his mouth to
hook it out : he is, therefore, most charming. But--I am afraid
* After completing tlieir moult in September, the young male died,
and was plucked by the survivors after his death.

that England is not the climate to suit this bird, for we cannot
give him open-air exercise without wet: still, I may be mistaken,
I am sure I hope so.
II.--THE BULLFINCH.
Pyrrhula eitropcm, Vieill.
By Albert Rettich.
The song of the wild or untutored Bullfinch is certainly
not a musical triumph, though it is very soft, without unpleasant
or shrill sounds. Nor is the bird capable of mocking other species.
Nevertheless, when properly trained, the Bullfinch excels them
all in what many think a far more desirable and wonderful
accomplishment, &apos;that is, in his remarkable aptitude for learning
whistling as performed by human lips, or, as it is termed,
piping.
The natural call-note of the Bullfinch is in itself a piping
sound; simple, short, flute-like, and easily imitated by the human
lips ; this simple call the bird can modulate at will a few
semi-tones higher or lower. This very elementary talent has
been fostered and developed by man, calling to aid the power
of mimicry nascent in the bird.
At the present time the training of this bird to pipe really
pretty airs has become quite a profession among the peasants in
the Black forest, Spessart Mountains, and other wooded districts
of Germany, in which Bullfinches abound. They devote their
attention seriously to the rearing and training of numbers of
young birds every year, and dispose of them, sometimes at very
remunerative prices, to the travelling dealers who supply the
different markets of the civilized world.
Now, it must not be supposed that because a first-class
piping Bullfinch fetches easily five pounds sterling in London,
or as much as fort}^ dollars in New York, that a royal road to
fortune has been found. The general result of a season's
Bullfinch training is not always so lucrative as this might lead
one to believe : for, when visiting Fulda, Gelnhausen, and other
places in the training districts, I ascertained that scarcely two
nestlings in a hundred attain the perfection requisite to com-
mand such high figures, and the dealers have, of late years,
displayed such eagerness to obtain their stock early, that the
birds have not always time to complete their studies and become
valuable.
But, even if that were not so, there is much to contend
with. A large proportion of the young birds are females ; some

<bodyText confidence="0.997638906976744" page_id="32635089"  page_num="6" year="" vol="">
die early ; some learn only a part of their lesson, say the first
line ont of four ; some learn just one short ditty, whereas, a
really good piper should master two airs correfitly and finish his
performance with a military bugle call. Extraordinary specimens
will even do more than that, but they do not make their appear-
ance every year. The majority have to be sold at low prices,,
and make charming pets for the bird lover of not unlimited
means and who is content to enjoy but a partial fulfilment of
the bird's early promises.
Yet, all these birds receive the same care and attention to
complete their education, which is conducted as follows: A
score or so of learners, still in their nest feathers and each in
a cage, are hung around a partly darkened room. When-
ever the enterprising peasant has a spare moment he enters that
room and whistles with his lips the tune decided upon for that
3 r ear. By the time the moult is over, the best birds have learned
that tune and are removed to another part of the cottage, where
the second subjefit of their studies is introduced to them; viz.:
the militaty bugle call. Onty a very few show aptitude enough
to be promoted to another removal for the purpose of being
taught a second air, when the first and the soldier's call have
been acquired by them.
Tong ere this, the peasant has found out which among his
team show signs of "piping to command ; " he takes the cage of
those most promising into his hand at all hours of the day,,
whistles the air, and then encourages the inmate to repeat it by
coaxing him with his voice, by imitating the sound of kissing,
and especially by gently rocking his head. A willing and
promising pet at once hops to the front of his cage and, puffing
out his plumage, sweetty gives a call or two, and then saj r s
his lesson to the best of his knowledge. When they pipe
their tunes readily in response to the manoeuvres just described,,
they are said to " pipe to command." The sound of osculation
is one of the first things Bullfinches imitate to perfection.
Of late years some improvements in teaching have been
introduced. Instead of moving the head to make the birds pipe to
command, the same motion is effected with the hand and extended
forefinger ; and instead of whistling, small bird organs are made
use of, the reed pipes of which are flute-like in sound and are
always of the correct pitch. Bullfinches that pipe to command
are much sought after, as they make most charming pets, and
great trouble is taken by the teacher to educate as many as
possible to that mode of producing their music.

Early in winter, the travelling collector of Piping
Bullfinches and German Canaries makes his appearance and
purchases all he can get at his price ; the birds are transferred
to the well-known wicker cages in which we see them later,
exposed for sale in our large towns and cities.
Given a family of nestlings in good health, a bird organ,
and the patience to turn the handle for half-an-hour every
morning and afternoon, I do not see why our native " Bullies"
should not be trained in this country with satisfactory results ;
perhaps it is being done, but I cannot say that English Pipers
have come under my notice.
Bullfinches are getting less abundant in this country than
formerly. No doubt the ready sale they find at comparatively
high prices, causes a great many of them to be deprived of liberty.
Even under the most favorable circumstances, Bullfinches cannot
be said to be endowed with longevity; three years of cage life is
rarely exceeded, after wdiich period their arch-enemy, asthma, is
very liable to seize them. Incorrect treatment and draughts
carry off a great many before they reach even that age. The
bright tints and glossy black become dulled, and the head
feathers fall out, if the bird is not properly treated; whereas, a
clean house, a bath, sound and varied food in which greenmeat
and fruit figure proportionately, will keep him in excellent
plumage and health. Imported birds do well on German rape
seed, with a daily allowance of about twenty hemp seeds ; but
some juicy dainties should not be omitted.
In the aviary, one or a pair of Bullfinches will be found
ornamental and amusing; they make a great show of affedtion,
carrying feathers, etc., for building, and the female wall lay a few
eggs, but there it mostly stops; breeding Bullfinches in confine-
ment is a thankless task. On the other hand, they should be
watched from time to time, to make sure that they do no harm to
the other occupants of their habitation. Not all, but most of those
I have thus kept, have ended by suddenly taking a dislike to
some unoffending Finch or Canary, and from that moment there
was no peace until one or the other was removed. A strong
cock Bullfinch can do some mischief in the limited space of
wood and wire, but in such a dilemma the judicious partial
clipping of the wings would be justifiable, as it is not always
convenient to shut him up separate!}&apos;.

(second paper).
In the Avicultural Magazine for April, 1895, I described
my first experiments in aviculture ; I now propose to give some
of my further experiences.
I soon found that, with limited time at one's disposal,
soft-billed birds are a pradtieal impossibility, owing to the
amount of cleaning and preparation of food necessary. I, there-
fore, decided to confine my attention to seed-eaters, of which
there is a sufficient variety to absorb the interest of the most
ardent aviculturist.
My next alteration was to do away with cages. Instead of
these, I have now in my bird-room three aviaries, each 15 feet
long and about 4^- feet wide. The centre aviary is 5J feet
high, but the roof being a span, the side ones slope down to
about 3 feet. The want of height is unfortunate, but could not
be avoided as the aviaries had to be built above the existing iron
staging. There is room left for two or three cages, which I only
use for acclimatizing and testing new birds.
The centre aviary is devoted to Weavers: the rarest
occupant is probably the Red-collared Whydah ; but I have
lately received from Mr. Swaysland a bird which, I think, must
be Urobrachya bocagii, a probably rarer species. I have, besides,
the Yellow-backed Whydah, Yellow - shouldered, Baya, Oryx
and Crimson-crowned Weavers, as well as the more usual species.
There is, of course, a certain amount of bickering among these
rather pugnacious birds, but the}&amp;quot; never seem to fight seriously.
Dr. Russ recommends giving aloe fibre to Weavers for
their nests. In the only form I have been able to procure it, the
fibres are firmly united in places by remaining parts of the pulp
of the leaf, and seem, besides, unsuitable on account of their
extreme fineness. A better material is a kind of raffia, which is
easily split up into strips of appropriate width and length ; my
birds are also fond of a long-leaved grass slightly faded. My
Weavers have never yet completed a satisfactory structure;
they seem to prefer pilfering each other's nests to obtaining their
supplies honestly from the material placed at their disposal. The
Red-billed and Russ'are certainly the most satisfactory builders; the
species of Pyromelana are too much addicted to weaving aimless
masses of fibre between the wires of the aviary instead of on the
branches provided for that purpose. Madagascar and Comoro

Weavers have never attempted to build at all, perhaps because
they are bachelors.
The two side aviaries contain such other finches as I do
not care to trust in the open air. I expect these are too crowded
for breeding; I have had nests of Bengalese, Aurora, and
Rufous-backed Finches, and Pied Mannikins, but with no result.
Red-headed Gouldians filled the bottom of a box with grass, but
the hen then died egg-bound. My Parrot Finches, then in a cage,
built a nest of hay and cotton wool in a small travelling-cage in
April; but, unfortunately, the cock caught a chill and died ; I
have only lately been able to replace him.
I notice Mr. Fillmer reports that his Jacarini Finch will
eat nothing but seed ; my bird is very eager after mealworms and
\0x25A0earwigs ; his disposition is quite peaceful, I have never observed
him attack other birds. The White-throated and Fined Finches
seem entirely seed-eaters; but I have lately got a hen Gutteral
Finch which is decidedly fond of mealworms and soft food
generally--is this exceptional ?
In my old garden-aviary breeding results have been better
but not altogether satisfactory. I made a considerably denser cover
this year with furze, broom, and heather, and have had a good many
nests. Three pairs of Zebra Finches have raised eight young,
and there appear to be two more broods not yet fledged. Ribbon
Pmches have hatched out two or three times, but failed to rear
their progeny; two of the cocks were bred in this aviary last
3^ear. Parson Finches have also lost two broods. A hen Nonpareil
laid and sat very steadily for ten da3^s, and then I found her
nest destroyed. Saffron Finches paired and built in March, but
the hen died egg-bound ; and a hen I bought to replace her
killed her husband, after chasing him about wildly for a couple
of days.
I have tried to keep Gouldians in this aviary, but eveiy
bird has died within a few weeks, though in perfect health at
first.
I have built another aviary, 14 feet long, 10 feet deep, and 8
feet high to the ridge, with a house at the back (double boarded)
5 feet deep, and the same length and height as the flight. The
whole is divided into two equal compartments. In the flight I
have planted ivy and bushes of box, and the front part of the
ground is turfed. One compartment is devoted to Cardinals
(Red-headed, Green, and Virginian), a cock Black-tailed Haw-
finch, Red-headed and Japanese Buntings; these all live together
perfectly amicably, but none have attempted to breed.

<bodyText confidence="0.998676875" page_id="32635085"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
The other compartment contains Waxbills. A pair of
Green Avadavats commenced to build in a box in the house in
May, directly they were put out, but have not reared any young.
A pair of common Avadavats built a tubular nest of hay and
grass stems on the furze, and hatched out; one young bird has
survived ; it left the nest on the 15th August, and is not yet in
colour, the back and wings are dark grey with a few white spots
on the latter, underneath yellowish white, upper tail coverts-
reddish, beak black. St. Helena Waxbills also built in one of the
box bushes, but their nest was almost immediately destroyed.
Mr. Farrar's account of his success in breeding is cer-
tainly encouraging, if somewhat tantalizing. It would be very
instructive if he would give a more detailed description of his
aviary: whether, for instance, it is entirely open to the air, or
has any covered refuge for his birds in frosty and inclement
weather. As regards birds injuring shrubs, I find my Cardinals
utterly destroy the ivy in their aviary, but hardly touch the box;
the smaller finches certainly do no harm to either ivy or box.
A great advantage in open-air aviaries is the amount of
insect food birds are able to procure for themselves. I have, in
particular, often noticed Indigo and Nonpareil Buntings hunting
the small flies, etc., that settle on the wire netting; earwigs are
also always abundant, and doubtless many other small insects.
I have seen it stated that Indigo and Nonpareil Buntings,
if kept together, fight incessantly ; I have had, this year, three of
each of these (a cock and two hens) in the same aviary, but
never observed any quarrelling among them.

This thoughtful and suggestive work contains a good deal
which is of interest to aviculturists, and for their benefit we give
the following extracts, in the hope that they may be tempted to
read the book as a whole.
" Wherever the vocal organs of cage birds permit them to imitate
human speech the}' are apt to devote a large part of their labour to this-
task, paying little attention to other less meaningful sounds. It appears

and therefore take a peculiar pleasure in copying it. It is hardly to he
believed that they ever get a sense of the counotative value of words, but
it is not to be doubted that they sometimes attain to a certain appreciation
of the denotation of simple phrases. In this task the)&apos; do not exhibit as
much sagacity as the dog, a creature which learns to understand the
purport of rather complicated sentences. Nevertheless, their capacity for
imitating speech is a fascinating peculiarity, one which has greatly
endeared them to bird fanciers.
" Those who have observed the talking birds have doubtless noted
the fact that their capacity for remembering and uttering words varies
greatly. I am inclined to think that in the same species some individuals
can do such tasks several times as easily as others. If those speaking
forms could be brought to breed in captivity, and something like the
selective care were given to their development that has been devoted to
the varieties of pigeons, we might well expect to attain very remarkable
results. If anywhere in the animal world there is a chance to open com-
munication by means of speech with the lower creatures, it should be
here.
"The ease with which most birds, except those of prey, may be
reduced to domestication is due to the remarkable intensity of their
sympathetic motives. In this regard the class is much more advanced
than that of the mammalia to which we ourselves belong. Accustomed as
they are to ceaseless and active intercourse with each other by means of
their varied calls, largely endowed with the faculty of attention, and provided
with fairly retentive memories, the birds are, on the average, nearer in the
\0x25A0qualities of their intelligence to man than are many of the species in his
own class. It was long ago remarked that the birds of the remote islands,
such as the Galapagos, which had never seen man, were at first not in the
least afraid of him. It required, however, but a few generations of experience
to show these creatures that the unfeathered biped was a singularly
dangerous animal, and they at once and permanently adopted the habit of
avoiding him. This incident of itself shows how quick birds are to learn
large and important lessons. We see also the reverse of this education in fear
in the rapid way in which birds become tame when they are secured from
persecution. Whenever shooting is stopped over a considerable territory the
birds rapidly become more tolerant of man's presence. Even among
migratory species the individuals appear to learn that certain places where
they are protected may be resorted to with safety.
" Because of their freedom of flight it is in all cases difficult to bring
our perching birds into such relations with the domiciles of man that they
can be truly domesticated. The success, however, which has been attained
in the case of the pigeons, which have been so far made captive by the
change of their instincts that they never depart far from their cotes, seems
to indicate that this tendency again to go wild is by no means ineradicable.
In other instances it will probably disappear as it has in this by long-
continued care in breeding. Our successes with the geese, ducks, and swans,
all of which belong to genera characterized by the migratory habit, show
how readily in the course of time the old native instinct may be subordinated
to the will of man. Although the degree of the difficulty which will be
encountered in taming many wild forms may be far greater than that which
has been met in those which we have domesticated, there is no reason what-
ever to believe that in any case it will be insuperable.

" While all the creatures of the wilderness may by the breeder's art
be induced to vary in the conditions of captivity, the birds have shown
themselves more plastic in our hands than any other animals. In almost
every brood we find individuals possessing marked peculiarities of form or
plumage. In their mental qiralities also there is a like range of variation.
Seizing upon these, the fanciers can guide the quick succeeding generations
so as to cause the form to depart in the course of a few years very far from
its original aspect. With each step in this succession of changes, the
readiness with which the species responds to selective care increases. . .
" Perhaps the greatest conquests which we have yet to make among
the birds will be won from the species which have the habit of dwelling
mainly or altogether on the ground. These, as experience shows, can be
more readily brought to the uses of man than the species which are free by
their wings to wander through the realms of air. There are very many of
these ground birds the domestication of which has never been fairly essayed.
There are perhaps a hundred species which, in one part of the world or
another, might afford valuable additions to our resources, those of orna-
ment or of economy', and yet within tlmee centuries only one of these, the
turkey, has been brought to the domesticated state. The greater part of
our game birds, such as the quail, pheasants, and partridges, though they
appear on slight experiments to be untamable, could probably&apos; by 7 con-
tinuous effort be reduced to perfect domestication. For ages they 7 have
been harried by man in a manner which has insured a great fear of liis-
presence. We have indeed through our hunting instituted a very 7 thorough-
going and continuous sy 7 stem of selection which has tended to affirm in
these creatures an intense fear of our kind. Only the more limorous have
escaped us, and y 7 ear after year we proceed to remove with the gun the
individuals which by' chance are born with any 7 considerable share of the
primitive tolerance of man's presence. It is not to be expected that the
chicks of these species will at once accept relations with our kind. The
domestication of many of these forms is to be desired, not only 7 on account
of the excellent quality of their flesh, but because of their beauty and the
charm which their quick intelligences afford them. Whoever has watched
them in the care of their y 7 oung or their other social habits, has observed
features which indicate a possible development under domestication,
perhaps greater than that which we have attained in any other of our
feathered captives.
" It seems most important that experiments in the future domestica-
tion of birds should be first addressed to certain large ground forms, which
are now in more or less danger of extinction. The newly 7 - instituted
industry of ostrich farming has probably insured this the noblest remnant
of the old avian life from destruction; but the emu and the cassowary 7
are still among the diminishing and endangered forms which, unless taken
into the human fold, are likely soon to pass away. The brush turkey' and
the bower bird of Australia, two of the most curious inhabitants of that
realm of strange life, appear to have qualities of mind and body' which&apos;
would make them readily domesticable, and which would cause them to be
among the most interesting of our feathered captives.
" Owing to their singularly' perfect protection against the cold, and,
also perhaps to the quickness of their wits, birds are more readily 7 trans-
ferable from one clime to another than any other animals. The feathered

tenants of our barnyards are, except perhaps the aquatic species and the
turkey, all from the tropical realms. Experiments with various other wild
forms go to show that there are very many other tropical species which
will prove to have an equal tolerance of high latitudes. If this be true we
may fairly look to the domestication of the varied bird life of the equatorial
regions for the enrichment of our northern lands."

French aviculturists are sometimes more successful than we are on
this side of the Channel. Is this due to the more genial climate, to greater
skill, or to greater luck ? We hear that there have recently been several
instances in France of the successful breeding of the Many-coloured
Parrakeet--when shall we hear of the same thing taking place in England ?
A member reports that he possesses a female Avadavat which has
been in his possession for six years, and which shows unmistakable signs of
age by patches of white in its plumage. Six years does not seem a very
patriarchal age, and probably many instances could be found of Waxbills
and other tiny birds attaining a greater age in captivity. In " Foreign
Finches in Captivity," Dr. Butler mentions a White-headed Mannikin
which died at the age of eighteen years. Will those of our members who
possess old birds kindly let the Secretary know about them ? We may thus
be able to get together statistics which will throw a little light upon the
subject of the age attained by birds in captivity--a subject which is at
present greatly obscured b}&apos; legends, wild guesses, and assertions unsup-
ported by evidence.
The Feathered World has now reached a very large circulation--we
believe considerably over thirty thousand copies are issued weekly. This
must be very much greater than that of any other " birdy " paper. Mrs.
Comyns-Dewer heartily deserves the success which has attended her
labours, for the Feathe?-ed World has always been on the side of honesty
and humanity and everything which tends to elevate what is called "the
fancy." It has never descended to the vulgarity which disfigures some of
its contemporaries, and has, undoubtedly, a strong influence for good
among a very wide circle of readers. The Feathered World is a striking
instance of the success which may attend unpaid journalism, for nearly all
the literary matter in its columns is the work of those who write without any
expectation of paj-ment. We sometimes think that some of the letters in the
Correspondence Columns would be the better for a little more "editing,"--
they would be easier to understand if the grammar were corrected, and
pleasanter to read if more courteously worded--but they would certainly
be less piquant and characteristic. Perhaps Mrs. Comyns-Lewer believes
that a more active censorship would cost her paper more in individuality
and interest than it would gain in grammar and politeness.
To those in want of an amusing pet we would recommend the
Senegal Parrot. It is only the size of a small Parrakeet, but is as intelli-
gent as a Grey or Amazon, and more active and lively. Moreover, it does

not scream. On the other hand, it is not usuallj- much of a talker, though
very clever at imitating the call-notes of other birds. It rapidly becomes
very tame, and seems to be more certain of its temper than some of the
larger Parrots. It has a comical way of hopping about the floor of its cage,
and will sometimes roll on its back when at play, just like a kitten.
We wish all success to the new "National British Bird and Mule
Club," and we also wish it a rather less cumbrous name. We observe that ten
out of the twenty-one officers of the Club are members of the Avicultural
Society. We notice, with pleasure, that the protection of wild birds is one
of the objeCts of the Clnb.
The Cage Bird Club was wound up some months ago, and the funds
in hand divided amongst the members. We are glad to hear that the
members subscribed liberally towards a testimonial for Mr. Betts, and that
he was presented with a handsome ruby ring -- it was fitting that there
should be some recognition of the manner in which Mr. Betts lavished both
time and money upon the Club. We believe that we are right in saying that
Mr. Betts paid deficits in the revenue of the Club to the extent of over _#6o.
No doubt the main cause of the failure of the Cage Bird Club was the high
subscription.

WHAT IS A BRITISH BIRD ?

<bodyText confidence="0.988828785714286" page_id="32635081"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I n last month's Avicultural Magazine Mr. Swailes starts a corre-
spondence on what is, perhaps, the most important matter with regard to
British birds from a show point of view; and one on which I hope members
will freely give their opinions. If once a definition be decided on and
accepted at our principal shows-, it will tend to greatly diminish the dis-
content which one hears frequently, and, I think, with good reason.
At the time of the last Brighton Show, I thoroughly thought the
matter out, with the result that the following rules were added to the
schedule.
Should no serious objection be made to these rules in the course of
the next month, might I suggest that they should be put to the vote ? If
passed, one would have a solid ground on which to ask for their insertion
in the schedules of the principal shows.
The Rules ran as follows : --

I would, therefore, exclude all accidental visitors which have not been met
with tolerably frequently.
1. Allowing the widest possible margin, on the off-chance of a
species having been overlooked, I would not permit an3' bird to be
exhibited in the British classes which had not been known to occur in
Great Britain and Ireland at least five times.
If Howard Saunders' list were to be taken as a guide, we should have
to admit species upon the show-bench in the British classes which the
author of the list does not himself consider to be British birds.
2. I would not admit aii}^ bird as British, solely on the ground that
specimens had been shot or caught in the British Isles; but would exclude
all of those which might resonably be believed to have been liberated, or
to have escaped from captivity&apos;: as examples I would exclude the Pine
Grosbeak in spite of the twenty-five or more recorded occurrences (twenty-
four of which are already discredited ; the birds having been probably
liberated). I would also certainly exclude the Scarlet Rose-finch, as being
a largely imported bird, and one not likely to interest any but an enthusi-
astic aviculturalist, after losing its rosy colour in captivity. It has been
suggested to me that the birds obtained were not in that bright adult
plumage which would render them likely to have been imported; this is
exactly what I should have expected, though I do not admit that only
brightly coloured birds are imported.
3. I am not at all sure that it would not be best for judges at shows
to exclude all accidental visitors, restricting the term " British " to resident
species and regular immigrants. This would greatly simplify matters, and
save a lot of discussion.
I see no reason for admitting certain birds known to have been
imported, simply because a specimen of the exhibited species was once
shot on our shores, and excluding imported Goldfinches because the
particular variety has not been recorded as British.*
A. G. Butrer.
I am disappointed that I have not received more letters upon this
most interesting subject, as the point is one of great importance, and there
seems to be an opportunity for our Society to do a very useful work. After
carefully considering the two foregoing letters, and further correspondence
with both Dr. Butler and Mr. Bonhote, it appears to me that we could not
do better than accept Mr. Howard Saunders' list for general purposes,
rejecting, however, those rare and doubtful visitors the English names of
which he prints in italics (there are nearly one hundred of these). But I
think that for show purposes it would be better for the Society to prepare
a list of its own, embracing only the orders Passeres, Pic aria', and Columbcc,
and omitting all species which are so rarely found in this country that the
presumption would be heavily against the British origin of an exhibited
specimen.
This is, of course, merely my personal opinion, and I hope that the
members will now take the matter up and express their views freely. The
subject will then be brought before the Council for their decision.

Sir, -- There is one point in this correspondence which has not
received the attention its importance deserves. Mr. Farrar seems to have
been found fault with because he reared his young Blue Robins on meal-
worms (and cockroaches), but can any of our members suggest a practical
substitute ? I write feelingly ; for I prefer insectivorous birds to seed-eaters,
and know only too well the difficulty, at an}&apos; rate here in London, of rearing
the young of the smaller species of the soft-bills owing to the seeming
impossibility of obtaining proper food. I am well acquainted with the
danger of the mealworm, but where would the young be without it! to
quote Mr. Farrar, they " would now be stiff and cold." I cannot obtain a
sufficient number of cockroaches to feed two hungry parents and a brood
of still hungrier youngsters--for be it remembered that usually the former
will themselves partake freely of the insects of whatever kind before taking

even one to their nest, and so all day and every day. Many birds will not
carry egg-food and the like to their young ; gentles and their relatives are
generally unsuitable ; and fresh ants' eggs are here unprocurable. Cannot
any aviculturalist help us ? We want to hear of the experiences of others

INTERESTING OPERATION ON A GREY PARROT.

Sir, -- M essrs. Cawthorn and Hutt wrote to me about a Grey Parrot
of which one eye was swollen. I went and saw the bird. It seemed suffering
from some tumour; I advised their consulting Mr. Bartlett, of the Zoo-
logical Gardens. As, after some weeks the eye was no better, I urged their
taking further steps. The following communication is an interesting
account of what was done. F. G. DuT&apos;fON.
An Interesting Operation.
On Saturday, October 3rd, an operation of unique character was per-
formed on a two-year old Grey female Parrot, at the Royal Westminster
Opthalmic Hospital, by Mr. Henry Juler, F.R.C.S. The bird, which is the
property of Mr. H. T. Hutt, of the firm of Messrs. Cawthorn and Hutt,
British Library, No. 24, Coclcspur Street, S.W., had been failing for some
time, and, notwithstanding the fact that experts had inspected her, no
real cause for indisposition could be arrived at, until skilful surgical aid
was obtained. Such a step was prompted by the value of the bird; a
splendid piper and talker; and the examination proved the existence of a
travelling tumour upon the under-lid of the right eye, which would, in
time, have affedted the sight to such an extent as to wear away the eye-ball,
and, in the end, bring about results which would probably have proved
fatal. An operation was decided upon, and, 011 the day named, was success-
fully carried out. The bird, having been firmly held by an attendant, was
treated as follows: -- A11 incision of V-sliape was made with a lancet, and
the opening thus caused, enabled the operating Surgeon to remove the
tumour piece by piece, in a very brief space of time. The usual steps were
taken to prevent bleeding and allay pain, and, in due course, the wound
was sewn up by the aid of the most modern contrivance for such a purpose.
The operation was most skilfully performed, and has proved a decided
success. It was witnessed by several members of the Surgical Staff and

GOULD IAN FINCHES AND VIRGINIAN CARDINALS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996652954545454" page_id="32635078"  page_num="17" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I am much obliged to Mr. St. Quintin for his interesting article
" On the Treatment of Newly-imported Gouldian Finches." I was in hopes
my question as to the treatment they require would have revealed some-
thing new in the shape of food, other than white and spray-millet, canary
seed, flowering tufts of grass, and chickweed ; a substitute, for example, for
the occasional insect they probably pick up when in their wild state, and
miss (with harm) in confinement.* My Gouldiaus eat a little Inga-seed now
and then ; but I have never seen them touch a mealworm, ant's egg, yolk
of egg, or any such food so readily eaten, with benefit, by scores of other
birds, and which, in moderation, would most likely benefit them too, if
the}&apos; would eat it.
Generally speaking, I have treated my newly-imported birds in the
way Mr. St. Quintin describes, but have, nevertheless, lost more Gouldiaus
(in value) than any other birds I have kept. My experiences agree with his
in several instances--as regards their waking up on the introduction of a
light, and feeding; also as regards the grit, of which, I believe, they can
take too much and derive harm instead of benefit from it.
I am extremely fascinated with these lovely birds, and have carefully
read all the articles I have found, in French and English, on the treatment
they need on their arrival in Europe. The following may be new to some
of our readers : A long and exhaustive article on the treatment of newly-
imported specimens appeared some two years ago in a Parisian paper,
L&apos;Acclimatation Journal des Eleveurs , and in this article it was stated that in a
wild state, in their native country, they purge twice a year with salt--
" volontairement en absorbant du sel gemmet qu'ils trouveut aux carrieres-
uiemes qu'ils visitent a cet effet,"--and the article recommended that they
be purged in a similar manner on their arrival in Europe. To do it, the
following was advised : Mix with the sand in the bottom of their cage
some pounded egg-shell, cuttle bone, and a pinch of pounded coarse salt.
Salt I have never seen recommended except by the writer of the said
article. A few months after its appearance, I purchased from a shop one
of the finest pairs of Redheads I ever saw. In less than a week, the cock
seemed to be going wrong, and I tried the above purging; he died in a few
days ; I cannot say if the salt had anything to do with it, but I have not
given salt to any since. One thing is certain, they seem extremely fond of
the mixture and continually pick it over.
When Gouldiaus are thoroughly acclimatized they are, in many
instances, quite hardy birds, as the following shows. In 1894, I purchased
* Is it not probable that the food which newlj&apos;-imported Gouldian Finches miss,
and die for the want of, is some kind of seed, possibly in a half-ripe condition ? They
are strict vegetarians in England, and there seems no reason to believe that they eat
insects in their native land.--E d.
+ Sel gemme is rock salt, which I always supply to my birds, and which many of them
eat greedily at intervals.--R. P.

from a gentleman in France (Sarthe), a pair hatched in his aviary in 1S93.
He keeps his birds, he wrote me, all the year round, in a garden-aviary, and
in winter simply shuts, at night, the door of the covered part where they
sleep. I believe it, for the hen he sent me had lost the tip of two toes from
frost-bite. Fast year, I bought another pair from him in the same state;
one had lost three nails from the frost-bite again. In 1889, he obtained,
he wrote me, 17 young in his garden aviary from one pair each of Black- and
Red-heads, and 12 in 1S93. I could mention several other instances where
Gouldians have been kept in this country, summer and winter, in outdoor
aviaries, and, as far as I know, on the usual seed and green food only.
Gouldians, to be able to stand such an amount of cold, must, of
course, be thoroughly acclimatized, or hatched in Europe ; but as most of
those offered for sale, by dealers especially, are imported, my objeft in asking
for a.11 article on their treatment, was in hope that it might assist in keeping
down the mortality, which is, doubtless, still very great with many who
purchase them. An acclimatized Gouldian is not a very difficult bird to
keep, but a newly-imported one, c&apos;est autre-chose !
While writing, I should like to say a little about breeding Virginian
Cardinals, on which Mr. Fillmer gives an extensive article in the September
number of the Magazine. From his remarks, I have succeeded with a
brood this season about as far as Mr. John Sergeant did with his. Iliad
three hatched in July, quite at the commencement, from three eggs. They
fledged splendidly the first fortnight, but left the nest far too soon, before
they could hop property, much less fly, and perished one after the other
from cold at night. I saw, as soon as they left the nest, how things were
likely to end, and put them back several times, and as the nest was in a
box, reduced the size of the opening; it was of no avail, the}&apos; w T ere out
again in a few minutes, with an apparent determination of stopping out.
A second nest of three, from three eggs also, followed in August, but they
were abandoned nearly as soon as hatched, the parents having come into
moult. I fed them on bread and milk, mealworms, gentles, scalded ants'
eggs, and the usual seed. Milk-sop is a splendid food for young Cardinals
and the parents feed freely with it, for the first week especially.
As regards the song of the Virginian Cardinal, it consists mostly, as
Mr. Fillmer says, of the repetition of one or two loud notes ; one of the
notes resembling the noise a chicken makes when it has lost its mamma ! It
is a fact that Virginian Cardinals sing at night. I have heard mine doing so
many times at ten or eleven o'clock. Hens sing, too,when the breeding season
is coming round; and, with my pair, a good row, lasting several days, has
often been the commencement of their matrimonial bliss: the cock
singing and chasing the hen, then the li en singing and chasing the cock ;
they arrange matters, though, amicably afterwards, and all the eggs get
fecundated. So far (4 years) I have not had a single clear egg. I keep my
pair in a mixed aviary containing birds from the tiny Waxbills upwards,
and, so far, not even in the breeding season, has any harm been done by
them. I have never had more than three eggs to a nest.
The Redrumps I wrote about in the August number, hatched the last
clutch of eggs and reared all the young -- five. I have, therefore, had eleven
young, in all, this season, from the pair in the box-cage.

My cage is 20ft. by 10ft., by 6ft. high, in the open air, with a fountain
in it; also a young yew, and two that have died off.
I am desirous of knowing the most suitable food which can be
readily obtained; whether I should provide any further protection from
the weather ; and any hints that your experience would suggest.
Chas. Louis Hett.
7 &apos;he following reply was sent to Mr. Hett :--
At the Zoological Gardens Ruffs are fed on hard-boiled eggs chopped
small, scraped meat, grated carrot, and breadcrumbs; and this is,
doubtless, the most suitable diet. I have, however, successfully kept them
on Spratts' Game Meat, with a little scraped meat and hard-boiled egg once
a week. They also require plenty of water in a flat-bottomed dish, as they
are very fond of standing in it. Of course, the more worms they can have
the better, and as they are freshly caught, I should suggest feeding them
at first on worms and hard-boiled eggs, gradually decreasing the worms and
substituting game meal for them.
With regard to providing them with shelter: it is pratically useless,
as the}&apos;will not avail themseves of it; but I should see that the whole
aviary is sheltered from the wind, especially at the north and east.

Sir, --I have been interested in both Mr. Wiener's and the Hon. F. G.
Dutton's letters. I have kept both Tanagers and Honeysuckers for several
years. At the present time I have a very fine Honeysucker ; also a Scarlet
Tauager, which has moulted six times in the seven years it has been in my
possession : it has always been in the finest health and plumage.
I feed them on broken sweet biscuits, soaked bread, potatoes, soaked
ants' eggs and grocers' currants; and fruit when in season.

THE TRAFFIC IN INSECTIVOROUS BRITISH BIRDS.
Sir, --Apart from the fact that Mr. Perkins is, to say the least, im-
polite to a fellow-member in meeting a well-intentioned letter with a flat
expression of disbelief, he seems altogether to have missed the point of the
original communication. It is not a question as to whether a Wood-wren
is "not a cage-bird at all," and Mr. Perkins' crudely expressed opinion that
" Varet" has most likely never seen a Wood-wren in a cage does not affect
the matter. Further, there was no suggestion in " Varet's " letter that the
various birds were equally difficult, one with the other, to keep in captivity.
The writer, who thinly veils his identity under the pseudonym " Varet," is
much too experienced an aviculturist to suggest anything of the sort.
Every one knows that it is easier to keep aWagtail or a Redstart than aWillow
Wren or Flycatcher, and even if it were the case that " Varet " had never

seen a Wood-wren in a cage, it would not alter the fadl that he is en-
deavouring to do his best to stop the wholesale extermination of our
delicate insectivorous songsters. Even a Wagtail or a Redstart requires
intelligent treatment in captivity, and, when fresh caught, unceasing
attention besides; and it is this, fortunately, that protects, in a degree, these
birds and the others mentioned, it being a fact that an ordinary bird-catcher
does not find it worth his while to catch them, while, if he occasionally
finds an accidental specimen in his " catch " he mostly releases it, as he
knows the bird-dealers will not take it off his hands. Any amateur of
ordinary experience would not buy one of these birds from a dealer, know-
ing, as he would, that it would already be half dead ; but when such an one
sees advertisements offering specimens at prices which would only be
warranted by the birds indicated being already " meated off," he is tempted
to send for them and, as pointed out in the letter which has given rise to
this correspondence, some unprincipled persons have ingeniously adopted
the practice of so advertising them. While the advertisements are appear-
ing these people make nightly excursions into the country, and in the early
morning catch all they can possibty get their nets over, or can inveigle on
to their "limed" twigs. All the unfortunate captives are brought home,
and if orders come in they are sold. The catcher crams them with gentles
and mealworms to prolong their lives as far as possible for his own mercen-
ary ends, but troubles nothing if, to use the words of " Varet's " letter,
"scarcely one in a hundred of those sent away would live for twenty-four
hours," or that " those he succeeded in selling did not represent a tithe of
those originally caught." Even if the buyers knew they were receiving
freshly caught birds, and knew how to property treat them on arrival, the
cruelty involved would be quite sufficient to call aloud for suppression, but,
as the inhuman traffic is now carried on, purchasers are deceived into the
belief that the birds they are buying are already accustomed to captivity,
and the cruelty is thereby intensified.
If I have not already trespassed too much upon space, I should
like to mention an experience of my own which has taught me never to buy
birds from advertisements of unknown people. Some years ago I had a
small collection of British birds in an outdoor aviary, and quite the most
interesting of the lot were a pair of Blue-tits and a pair of Coal-tits. Every-
one who has kept these charming little birds knows that they will get
through apertures which seemed, beforehand, much too small to be unsafe,
and one day I lost all my four birds. I bought many afterwards from
time to time in the bird-shops, but could never keep one alive. Seeing an
advertisement from a man in Devonshire, I wrote, ordering two pairs each
of Blue-tits, Marsh-tits, and Coal-tits. In due time two cigar boxes were
delivered, and these, upon being opened, proved each to contain six birds,
every one dead. I have not the slightest doubt that the advertiser was of
a kidney with those mentioned by " Varet," and was one who caught birds
by the thousand, and packed them off, dead or alive, so long as he re-
ceived the money beforehand.
The whole thing needs the intervention of the R.S.P.C.A., or of the
various Societies for the protection of our feathered songsters. They could
find out these things as easily as could amateurs, and can scarcely be blind
to the abominable cruelty going on all around them.

(THIRD SERIES).
I.--THE GARRULOUS HONEY-EATER.
By RussEivT Humphrys.

. Perhaps it may interest some of the members of our
Society to have a short account of a pair of Garrulous Honey-
eaters ( Myzantha garrula) which I became possessed of some
months ago. This bird, a member of a somewhat extensive
group, is a native of Tasmania and New South Wales, in both
of which localities it is fairly common, although local in
some cases, being found in great numbers on one side of a river,
while on the other side not a bird can be seen. It is said that
those which inhabit Tasmania are larger than those of New
South Wales : the greater size being probably due to a
greater profusion and more nourishing properties of the food.
They haunt the eucalypti forests that abound in those regions,
and feed upon the nectar of flowers and small insedts that
frequent them. In size, the Garrulous Honey-eater equals
a large Thrush, and although sober in colouring is very
pleasing in effedt. The top of the head is black, and the face
and remainder of the head grey, with the exception of a broad
dash of black, which reaches from the ear to the angle of the
mouth. The whole of the upper surface is alight greyish brown,
each feather in the neck being tipped with silver grey. The
wings are dark brown, diversified with longitudinal streaks of
yellow, produced by the bright yellow colour which stains the
outer web of each quill feather. The tail is greyish brown,
streaked with narrow dark-brown lines, the under surface being
grey, with the exception of a dark brown patch which is found
upon the chin. My birds occupy a lean-to cage some five by
five by eight feet in a corner of ni3 r bird-room. They are very
active and highly amusing birds, and, judging from my ex-
perience, not particularly susceptible to a low temperature, as on

cold nights they have been in a room at 45 0 or even less, with-
out showing the least signs of discomfort ; whether they would
stand it for any length of time I am unable to say, as I always
endeavour to keep my rooms as near 6o* as possible. They
amuse themselves by chasing each other round the cage, over
and under the perches and occasionally swinging round and
round with an agility that is perfectly astounding, this exercise
usually being terminated by two or three somersaults thrown on
the wing. They are very noisy birds, uttering their curious bell-
like note, which is almost exactly similar to that of another little-
known member of this genus, viz., Myzantha melanophrys, or the
Bell-bird of Australia, a pair of which occupy the opposite corner
of my bird-room, and carry on an animated conversation with
their vis-a-vis the greater part of day. Their diet consists of
boiled potato chopped fine, mixed with yolk of egg and grated
carrot, with a few scalded grocers' currants added. They are
great fruit eaters, and have a daily supply of banana and orange;
the former they are particularly fond of, especially if a trifle over
ripe. If, as occasionally happens, neither of the above-mentioned
fruits are obtainable, a slice of ripe pear, or a few green figs, make
an efficient substitute. They are also very fond of the ordinary
green-fty, which is such a pest to the garden, and if a branch
-covered with this insedt be placed in the cage,they rapidly strip the
leaves by licking them with their long tongues ; it is needless to
add that mealworms are an especial delicacy. My birds are very
fond of their bath, and are supplied daily with an earthenware
panful of water, some 15 inches in diameter, in which they simply
revel, it being by far the most important item of the day's pro-
gramme. They perform their ablutions in rather a curious
manner, first sitting on the edge of the pan, apparently making
up their minds for the inevitable plunge ; then with wings out-
stretched and tail extended, they run rapidly across the pan
under the water, emerging on the other side thoroughly
soaked ; this process being repeated some half-dozen times,
they scramble back with some difficulty to the nearest available
perch to plume themselves and complete an elaborate toilet.
Although not particularly demonstrative towards each other,
they strongly resent an intruder in their cage, as I have several
times placed a third party with them, always with disastrous
results--the last unfortunate individual being an especially fine
example of a Jamaica Troupial, who, apparently, treated their
hostile demonstrations with the greatest scorn, but some week
or ten days after his arrival, whether from the effedts of constant
harrying, or from an over-burdening sense of being perpetually

de trop, lie succumbed : since then I have not repeated the ex-
periment, which I found decidedly expensive. Garrulous Honey-
eaters must have a cage to themselves, and a roomy one. To
anyone who has the chance of obtaining specimens of these
rare birds, I say buy them, as more amusing and interesting
birds it would be difficult to obtain.

Held at the Aquarium, London, October i^th --29 th, 1896.
By Reginald Phieeipps.
This Society is to be congratulated on their capital Show,
which was held at the Aquarium on the last Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday of October, at least a capital Show as regards the
foreign birds, and probably of the Canaries, &amp;c., likewise. I
would first remark that if this Society can have a good Bird Show
in the middle of the week, thus avoiding much Sunday labour,
it should not be quite impossible for other Societies to do the
same. It is a real misfortune that the use of some better lighted
place than the Aquarium cannot be obtained ; it is hardly corredt
to say that the light is bad ; rather it is that some parts are dark
with hardly a trace of light. For instance, I looked carefully
into one cage (922) in search of a bird ; after a while, I detected
a darker shade in one spot ; on referring to the catalogue, I
found that a pair was mentioned ; after another diligent search,
I did detedt another shade ; but whether the catalogue was right
in saying that they were a pair of Combasous I do not know.
This kind of thing makes a visit to a Show a rather tedious
matter. I am right glad to be able to say that the incomplete
feet so common at the Palace of recent years were wholly absent
so far as I was able to see--for happily some of the cages were
more open and in better positions than was No. 922. I visited the
Show on the Tuesday morning before the catalogues were out,
and again on the Wednesday afternoon for a brief while--to
obtain a catalogue in fadt. A few birds, by the way, were in
wrong classes, but of this no notice seems to have been taken
the judges were very amiable and lenient.
Quite the bird of the Show to my thinking was Mr.
Humphrys' Black - throated Grakle (897--V.H.C.), from the
Philippine Islands, at least so says the catalogue, but Graculipica
nigricollis comes from " China to Cochin China, Burinah, and
Tenasserim." This fine fellow, on finding himself in such good
company, was passing the time on Tuesday morning uttering

a pretty little call or song, accompanying each call with a raising
of the crest and a spreading of the tail--which was very prettily
marked on the under side. Birds know well where their beauty
lies. Putting aside the Peacock, I can never forget the ex-
ceptional manner in which the Golden-winged Woodpecker
shows himself off in the presence of his female ; and this Grakle
knew well which side of his tail to spread out before his visitors..
On the Wednesday he was not quite so jubilant, and no wonder,,
for the awards had been published, and the judges had given
him only V.H.C. He has my sympathy, for he was worthy of
a better place.
The next exhibit in the order of avicultural interest was a
pair of Garrulous Honey-eaters (899--first), owned by the same
gentleman. These two birds (and also a third), if I mistake not,
were for some time in the hands of Mr. Abrahams, with whom I
had previously seen them on more than one occasion. They are
Myzantha (better Manorhina) gar nil a, well-known to the Austra-
lians under the familiar name of &apos;&amp;quot;Bell-birds, birds which I am
told are more frequently heard than seen in their wild state, f I
have not heard, however, that these two have uttered their
tinkling bell-like notes since they have been in this country. In
this respedt they differ from their relatives the New Zealand Bell-
birds, Anthornis melaimra , several of which paid a fleeting visit
to London this summer, and respecting which I was told that
they rang together in a body, note under note, producing a
charming effedt. The members of the two genera, although
differing considerably in external appearance, are rather closely
connedted through the well-known Tui or Parson-bird. These
two Garrulous Honey-eaters were in a capital cage as regards
size, but cruelly open considering their nature ; and they seemed
a little uncomfortable on the large hard perches ; what a relief
to many of these birds would a natural bough be, in the place of
the stiff, formal, usually too large, orthodox perches !
Of Toucans there were but two, Mr. Fulljames' Ariel (906-
--V.H.C.) and Mr. Arthur's much rarer Short-billed Toucan,,
Rhamphastos brevicariaimis (91 iB--second). The Glossy-Starlings
had but one representative, a Purple-head (902) in poor colour,
the Tong-tailed Starling of the catalogue (901) turning out to
be naught but a Rail in a most unsuitable cage. The Green-
* The Australian and New Zealand Bell-birds must not be confused
with the famous Bell-birds of South America.--R.P.
t Mr. Humphrys calls Myzantha ( Manorhina) nielanophrys "the Bell-
bird of Australia." I am very glad to be put straight; nevertheless, in some
districts M. garrula is also called the Bell-bird.--R.P.

Bulbuls were represented by three of the common Malabar
(905--third ; 911 A. ; 915) and two of the rarer and prettier
\0x25A0"Blue-winged" species (908--H.C. ; 913). The latter name is
obtained, I believe, from the Zoological Society's " hist," but, as
several of the species in this genus ( Chloropsis , commonly
Phyllornis) have blue wings, the name of Orange-bellied Green-
Bulbul is preferable, C. hardwickii being the only one that has
the orange belly in both sexes. Mr. Swaysland adopted a curious,
perhaps unique, method of insuring that his Malabar Green-
Bulbul should not be starved by a seed or any other " Show "
diet by fixing up in the cage a good piece of honey in the honey-
comb ; but this spoiled the bird's chance of a prize, for with its
sticky bill it had preened its feathers--and the result was not
satisfactory either to the owner or to the looker-on. There were
three White-eared Bulbuls (911 ; 912--V.H.C). A Pileated in
bad colour (910--H.C.) and a fine Mexican (91 iC--ex. third)
exhaust the list of foreign Jays ; the latter, with a mate, is an
attractive bird in an aviary, but of small account in a cage. A
fine Shama (903--V.H.C.) might have been placed a little higher,
and a Dyal-bird might have been mentioned. Classes 100, 102,
and 103 were very much in the dark, but a Violet Tanager (914--
third) seemed a nice bird, as did also two Scarlet Tanagers (917--
second ; 921--H.C.) ; all things being equal, the Violet should
have had precedence of the others, the Scarlet bird being easily
kept in health and plumage. A pair of Australian Zosterops
(918--first), a Blue Robin (919--V.H.C.), and a couple of Pekin
(or Peking, if we are to remain in L,i Hung Chang's good books)
Robins (920) about exhaust the list of the foreign non-seedeaters.
The Pekins, by the way, not being colour-fed, were ignored by
the judges, for these pretty little fellows do not keep their colours
well in this dull climate without a little " assistance," but they
should not have been condemned on this account.
Of the Weavers and Whydahs I need not say much; there
were several Weavers of the kinds usually met with, and also a
pair of the Rose-breasted (884--C.), not looking very spruce ; of
the latter there were a fine Red-collared (886--first) and two
Yellow-shouldered (892--second ; 894--V.H.C.). Amongst the
smaller foreign Finches there were some nice birds, but none too
many. There were three Parrot finches, but, alas ! the one was
dead : those who objedt to Bird Shows have something to say on
their side. Red-headed, Rufous-backed, White-eared, Parson,
St. Helena Singing, Pileated, Cuba, Alario Finches, and a good
Black-headed Siskin, were just represented, singly, or in pairs,
but were nearly invisible. There was a larger supply of Gouldian

<bodyText confidence="0.941073318181818" page_id="32635069"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
Finches, mostly Red-faced, and mostly a poor lot. TheGonetian
Finch (928A) seemed to be a Black-faced Gouldian. The class
of Waxbills, &amp;c., produced several nice specimens of the ordinary
kinds, but nothing rare ; the Cordon Bleus in pairs made a
pretty show, Mr. Maxwell's (872--first) particularly attracting
my attention.
Of all the members of the Parrot family present, my heart
went out most warmly towards a good pair of Musky Rorikeets,
Glossopsittacus concinnus (845--second) ; although usually classed
among the Trichoglossi, they differ from them in their habits and
in other respedts ; and dearly as I love the latter I love the
Musks yet mere. Although not angels (nice birds and persons
never are), they are not such blood-thirsty demons as are the
Trichoglossi , with whom I do not class the Scaly-breast, which
is different again ; they have very charming little ways when
flying free in bird-room and aviary--all these birds are wasted
when kept in a cage. In some respedts they are rather delicate
little things ; several came over last spring ; it was then stated
that they had not been seen in this country for twenty years ; I
have never before seen one at a Show. An Australian colonist
cold me recently that the Musks are not kept in confinement in
Australia as they always die in fits ; I noticed the other day
that the female at the Zoological Gardens (a pair was obtained in
the spring) had disappeared. Now the Many-coloured Parrakeet
is common, and very easily kept in health and condition ; and
yet at this Show one of the latter was placed first--over the head
of the Musks.
On the Tuesday morning, the Musks were looking bright
and well, but on the Wednesday afternoon they were very, very sad
and down ; how different from the pair who greeted me so glee-
fully on my return home, and asked so prettily for their supper !
Their nervous system is too highly strung to stand safely the
roughing and excitement of a Show. The only other Rorikeets
were an Ornamented (851--ex. third), which well deserved the
notice taken of it, and a Swainson's Rorilceet (832) which, treated
as a (Blue Mountain) Rory, was given a third although in the
wrong class. So much for a popular name : but the judges
should have been made of sterner stuff. There was not a Rory
in the building ; but why " Rorey " and " Roreys ? " The word
is from the Malay Rurf, so Rury, sometimes used, is the better
word. The Brotogerys genus, quite one of my favourites, was
represented by one solitary bird (852D.), an Orange-flank look-
ing very lumpy. One Red-backed Parrakeet (843--V.H.C.) and
one Many-coloured (850--first) were present; on the Tuesday morn-

ing, both were at the bottoms of their cages looking thoroughly
" done," and both were still sleeping when I glanced at them on
the following day. I roused up the Many-coloured, and it seemed
a capital bird--but it should not have been placed before the
Musks for all that. One male Barraband supported the Polytelis,
and two Patagonian Conures the still smaller Cyanolyseus genus.
Another Conure (929--V.H.C.) is described in the catalogue as a.
Golden Crowned Parrakeet ; but Golden-crowned " Conure "
would have been a less misleading title for the familiar Half-moon.,
Mr. Maxwell's " Amazon " (930--first) turned out on in-
vestigation to be a couple of Rosy Rove-birds ; of Rove-birds
there were not any more, and of Amazons only a few. There
was rather a fine show of Kings and Crimson-wings, some of
them being excellent birds. The female Crimson-wings quite
often spend much of their time on the bottoms of their cages,
as most exhibitors seem to know, but the female in 834 looked
very uncomfortable standing on the gridiron of an otherwise
nice large cage ; in 842, however, the lady had the best of it, for
the male was suffering terribly from cramp up on his thick, hard
perch.
Only a small number of Cockatoos was present, of which
I liked the Readbeater best, but the Sleuder-bill was not to be
despised. The Red-sided Eclecti were in force, but the Macaws
could only muster a nice Red and Blue (S23--first) and an
ordinary Illiger. The Greys (816 and 817) were both good.
With Miss Bland's bright little Senegal I may well wind up the
Parrots.
It goes without saying that there was a goodly number
of capital Blackbirds, Thrushes, and Starlings ; there were also
a Missel Thrush and a Jay, both rather good for caged specimens.
There were some good Nightingales and other little " Warblers":
I hope I shall not be hauled over the coals, as I have been before
now, for not speaking of them as " Thrushes; " there was a
good Swallow, too, who looked quite happy over his first prize.
The Wagtails were a poor set ; but there were some good male
Redstarts, notably Mr. S. Cook's. Nuthatches were plentiful,
and there was one Great-spotted Woodpecker (810--first), a
Ring-Ouzel, and a Red-backed Shrike. Why the Bramble
Finches should have been regarded as non-migratory is not clear.
A Golden-crested Wren (first) and a Rong-tailed Tit (second)
were well deserving of mention and of their places. There were
several other common birds, many of them in excellent condi-
tion, and with one of these, Mr. Francis' Hawfinch (781--first),
which specially caught myeye, I really mustclosemyramblingtale.

Petronia petronella, Eicht.
By E. G. B. Meade-Waedo.
The Rock-Sparrow lias for some years been a favourite
aviary bird of mine ; although I do not fancy that it is so with
the majority of bird-keepers. I like it because it is associated
with some pleasant years spent in the Canary Islands, where
its loud sparrow-like chirp, coupled with the Poo-poo of the
Hoopoe, were the first bird-sounds heard every morning at day-
break. The range of the Rock Sparrow extends from the
Canary Islands on the west, throughout the Mediterranean
region into India and Afghanistan. It is a bird of old buildings
and rocks, but as far as my experience goes does not frequent
towns, except in the few cases where no form of the House
Sparrow occurs. In the Canar}^ Islands this is the case, for in
those Islands where no House Sparrow is found the Rock
Sparrow is ubiquitous ; while where the Spanish Sparrow, Passer
salicicola, occurs, the Rock Sparrow frequents the mountains
only--the large and powerful Rock Sparrow giving way at once
before the other.
The Rock Sparrow is a shy bird in a wild state, feeding
always far out in the country, and only resorting to towns for
nesting and roosting. It has a very powerful and sustained
flight, as its long pointed wings, with the first and second
primaries of almost equal length, point out; and it may be seen
hurrying to feed its young with a large grub or caterpillar in its
beak in a manner that is very suggestive of a Starling on the
same errand. In "showing off" to his mate, the Rock Sparrow T
adts in much the same way as our own House Sparrow does--
hopping round with his wings half open and shivering, and his
beak pointed upwards, all the feathers on his head drawn tight,
but his bright canary-yellow throat feathers spread out like a
little fan ; he also has his tail half-spread, so as to show the
round white spot at the tip of the inner web of each tail feather.
The Rock Sparrow thrives in an open-air aviary, and
except during the breeding season is a peaceable bird ; in the
nesting time, however, he is a perfedt demon, and no small
passerine bird can exist with a breeding pair of Rock Sparrows.
All seeds are eaten, hemp and wheat, however, being the
favourites, and they are great devourers of all insects and egg
foods. A four-inch drain pipe, with one end blocked and the other

half plugged, forms as good a nesting-place as any in an aviary,
and the nest is built precisely like that of the House Sparrow. The
eggs, as a rule, are much like Sparrow's eggs, but are larger, and
some varieties (one especially, which is blotched with two shades
of chocolate) do not seem to be ever quite represented in House
Sparrow's eggs. I have noticed that the young of this bird,
when they first leave the nest, are peculiarly tame, and I have
had them fly and settle on me, calling at the same time to their
parents for food. The actions of the Rock Sparrow on the
ground are quite peculiar ; as, although they hop, they also run
like a Lark, and I have watched a flock, suddenly alarmed when
feeding on a stony plain, quickly scuttle off in different directions,
each bird stopping motionless with his beak against a stone until
the danger, whatever it might be, had passed over.

This bright and lively finch is very common, and widely
distributed throughout our country. It has always been a great
favourite with me, and is not, I think, estimated at its true worth
on this side of the Channel. In winter it enlivens the woods
and gardens with its oft - repeated " pink, pink," in spring
its lively, though short, song is a welcome sign of returning
summer; while its nest, placed in some hedgerow, is neater
and better finished than that of any other bird in our Islands.
To begin with, let us look more closely at its name,
Fringilla ccelebs or the Bachelor Finch. This name was given
by Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist, because, at that time, the
males were supposed to spend the winter in Sweden, while the
females migrated southward in large flocks. In our country
there seems to be no such separation of sexes, although large
flocks composed solely of one sex or the other are frequently
to be met with.
The sexes differ greatly in plumage. The male has the
crown of the head blue, the back brown, the rump green and the
underparts reddish. The hen is of various shades of greenish-
grey, and the young, until their first moult, resemble her. In
spring the broad edgings of the feathers are worn off and both
sexes become much brighter ; the bill, which in the male is
horn-colour in winter, becomes dark. Both sexes may always
be distinguished, when flying, by a white cross-bar on each wing.

I shall have more to say on this cross-bar.in my article on the
Brambling, which will appear at a later date.
The nest is built towards the end of April, and is
beautifully made of moss and lichens matted together, with a
lining of horsehair. In shape it is circular and rather deep.
The eggs are usually five in number, and of a pale blue colour
with large reddish-brown spots, generally with a darker centre,
although there is a nice variety in which the spots are entirely
absent.
In an aviary it is a welcome inmate. It is very lively and
ever on the move, showing off its plumage to great advantage.
A friend of mine, Mr. C. V. Bulstrode, was successful in
getting these birds to breed in confinement. They built, laid
and hatched, but then, alas! a marauder in the shape of a
Redpoll removed the bottom of the nest!
The ordinary note of this species is the well-known "pink,
pink," from this it derives its local name of Pink or Twink, the
French name Pingon and the German Fink : whence comes our
word Finch. One may compare this with the Cuckoo, which
derives its trivial name from its note in almost all European
countries. The song proper consists of a few syllables, which
Mr. H. Saunders renders by the words " toll, toll, pretty little
de-ar." This is repeated incessantly from the same perch,
especially toward evening. In England it is never kept as a song
bird, but in Germany it is greatly prized and taught to sing at
word of command. It cannot, however, be taught to sing a
tune, like the Bullfinch, but only its own song with various
modifications, which are sometimes heard in wild birds. These
songs are, so to speak, cultivated, for the 3^oung are taken from
the nest and only allowed to hear the strains of a specialty
fine songster, thus learning his notes only. Bechstein, in his
" Natural History of Cage Birds," adtualty enumerates eight of
these variations. The best seems to be the " Double Trill of
the Hartz," which is entirely created by man, and "is composed
of six strains, rather long, the last of which is ended by dwelling
on the two final syllables, which I shall express here b}f the word
weingeh" (pronounced vine-gay). The names of the other
songs are Reiterzoug, Wine Song, Brautigam or Bridegroom
Song, Gutjalir, Ouakia and Pithia, all of which seem to var}^
chiefly in the pronunciation of the last two syllables. "If,"
says Bechstein, " the bird adds to its last strain the sound 'fink/
which bird-catchers translate by ' amen,' it is of the highest
value."

As a cage-bird it is not very suitable: being wild, it soon
knocks its plumage about ; while its song is liable, from the
frequency with which it is uttered, to become monotonous. In
an aviary, on the other hand, it is a most delightful pet, con-
tinually on the move and keeping the whole place bright with
its cheerful call-note. It is a hardy bird in captivity; living
many years, and requiring no food other than the ordinary mixed
seeds, thriving well without any insects or Soft food, though if
these latter be supplied it will freely partake of them.

In previous communications (Nov., 1895, and May, 1896)
I have discussed some of the difficulties the aviculturist is sure
to meet with, and the subject of dangerous birds. I now
propose to narrate some of my experiences of an analogous
character drawn from various groups of birds, and which can
be best described by the expression adopted as the title for this
paper.
Bast year I reared some fancy Pheasants under Bantam
hens. I set two within a day or two of each other, but the
second one did not take kindly to her nest, and by dint of
scratching and worrying about broke most of her eggs; however,
she eventually settled to her work and hatched one chick. The
other hen had brought off some five or six chicks about 24 hours
previously. Not wishing to keep a hen isolated for several weeks
with only one baby, I transferred it to the other hen on the
evening of its first day and saw it safely nestled under her
before I left them. Next morning I noticed the little one looked
very dejedted and made great efforts to hide itself under the hen,

who did not seem any too well disposed towards it. But I was
not long in discovering that the real trouble arose with the elder
chicks. The little odd one no sooner showed itself out of shelter
and tried to pick up a living than one or more of the others set
upon it with beak and heel, so that by midday, when I returned
from business, I found it with a perfectly raw head, too weak to
stand and apparently at its last gasp. However, I determined
to do what I could for it, and succeeded in bringing it round
sufficiently to restore it to its rightful mother, who reared it
without further trouble. And, strange to say, when it grew
up, it appeared that the hen was its rightful mother in very deed,
for it turned out to be a Bantam cockerel, and no doubt this
explains at once why the Pheasants were so hard upon it; but
that they should have been able to distinguish the difference
before they were 36 hours old, and should have so strongly
resented the intrusion of a tiny stranger, is truly a wonder.
The history is not yet complete. When the young cockerel was
more than half grown and beginning to crow, I found that his
father was very jealous of his presence, and was making the run
rather hot for him ; so I took him out and put him with an odd
adult hen in a coop by themselves. Next morning he was so
mutilated that I killed him out of sheer pity, and his female
assailant looked as proud as Ducifer over her achievement.
This season a Golden Pheasant hen and a cock Californian
Quail sat simultaneously in opposite corners of the same aviary,
and the Pheasant brought off her brood some days before the
Quail led out his tiny mites. He was in a state of intense
excitement about them, but showed no disposition to protect
them in the same way that a Bantam hen does, and before any
steps could be taken to preserve them, the Pheasant chicks had
worried them off the face of the earth, seizing them by the head
or back and shaking them as a terrier does a rat. (By way of
parenthesis, is there any other known instance of a cock bird
undertaking the whole duty of incubation and rearing of the
young, the hen taking no part whatever after laying the eggs ? I
fancy the Ostrich is, perhaps, another example, but am not sure :
it seems to be the normal characteristic of the Californian Quail).
To resume. We have, in our Arboretum, besides the
enclosed aviary, a pool of water with two islands on which a
small collection of water-fowl disport themselves. It is not well-
arranged or adapted for breeding, but occasionally a Tufted Diver
will bring out a brood, or a Wild Duck will sail out some fine
morning with a train of a baker's dozen of tiny puff balls
apparently endowed with all the attributes of quicksilver except

that of weight. This summer we have had three such broods:
the first, a small one of four, appearing several weeks before the
last. No sooner did the last lot come out than they became the
objedt of assault by the first four, and eventually only two
survivors were left out of a family of nine. In this case the
aggressors were of the same species, and thus the example
differs from the preceding ones.
Again, some years ago we kept some Water Hens and Bald
Coots on the pool. Both reared families, the Coots being the
earlier, and the young Water Hens were not left undisturbed for
an hour, and before many hours they all succumbed to the
unremitting attacks of the young Coots. An old Swan, with no
family of his own to care for, proved a veritable demon among
the young life on the pond, and was ultimately converted into a
specimen for the Museum in consequence.
The habit of the Wagtail has already been mentioned by
another contributor, and I can confirm his experience by the
following stories. The first I ever had was a wild Grey Wagtail
that was brought to me by a birdcatcher, and was put at once in
the British bird section. Next day the same man brought me
another, which was added to the collection. But the first never
gave it a chance to show itself or time to peck a mouthful of
food, and drove it to death in a few hours. The aggressor turned
out to be a hen, for next spring she mated with a Pied Wagtail
and hatched, but failed to rear, two young ones. Bast summer
we had an old cock Pied Wagtail in our pool aviary, the only
specimen of his family for a while. Bater in the year we
procured a pair with their three young ones about three parts
grown, and these were all put into the aviary together. All went
merry as a marriage bell, the young ones were well cared for and
throve, until the first touch of frosty weather, when the original
old cock turned awkward and murdered the whole family, him-
self falling a victim later to the rats which found entrance into
the pool.
It is a widespread belief that the young Robins of the year
systematically kill off the old ones. I cannot affirm or deny this,
but I think it improbable; possibly other members of the Society
may have knowledge of the subject. That they are notoriously
pugnacious in disposition and difficult to keep with other birds,
is well known to aviculturists. A few weeks ago I came upon
two Sparrows fighting to the death in the street. I approached
close enough to be able to touch them with my stick before they
observed me, and then they flew into an adjoining garden and
resumed the combat with the same fury. An old man standing

by, remarked " Ah! it's their way, it's only the young one
killing off the old one." I replied that it was perhaps a good
thing for some of us that humans had learnt better manners,
and went my way.
But this peculiarity of bird-nature makes not the least of
the difficulties that beset the aviculturist, and while putting out
of account all the interesting questions of growth of instindt,
inherited tendencies, ethics of living and so on, leaves for
him the great problem how it is practicable, under such conditions,
to increase his stock.

Mrs. Charles Mallet, in the Animals&apos; Friend , tells how a lady attracted
fourteen different species of birds into her London garden, surrounded on
all sides by houses. "Chaffinches, yellow-hammers, house-martins, and
some which are but seldom seen within the precincts of the great city,
came to look upon the house and garden as a safe and happy refuge. The
murmuring music of the wood-pigeon, of which six frequented the garden,
sounded throughout the quiet summer afternoon, and many a glad song
of thankfulness was heard from some little contented thrush or blackbird,
well satisfied with the feast of good things provided." We believe that the
capabilities of small town gardens, from a " birdy " point of view, are not
sufficiently appreciated. If people would take the trouble to feed the birds
regularly (with food which they like , not mere bread crumbs) and would
pi&apos;ovide shelter and nesting-places, they would be amply repaid by the
presence of many species which they would never have expected to see
within the boundaries of a town.
A fine male Gang-gang Cockatoo (Callocephalon galeatum) has just
appeared in the London market. It is said that one has not been seen in
England for fifteen years, and that this is the only one in Europe.
There are some forms of cruelty which are constantly being denounced
and are apparently universally condemned, and yet they continue to be
practised just as if no protest had ever been made against them. One
abomination is the wearing of birds' plumes and skins in ladies' hats.
Another is the senseless destruction of specimens of rare British species as
soon as the} r appear amongst us. The members of the Avicultural Society
are too well instructed to require to have the folly and wickedness of either
practice pointed out to them. We are heartily sick of the very mention
of them. But they appear to go on, just the same as ever -- and so long as
this is so "men of goodwill" must go on protesting against them. Will
the members do all they can, both by precept and example, to discourage
both practices ?

Mrs. J. C. Pool sends a. most interesting account of her window aviary,
but we hesitate to print it as we fear it would not be very intelligible -with-
out the aid of drawings. One feature of her aviary must, we think, be
unique--" A hole, just large enough for Rosellas and Pennants to wriggle
through, leads from the large drawing-room aviary through a tunnel 14ft.
long into a still larger out-door aviary, 74ft. in length. The birds are
passing through this tunnel all day long, a few always coming indoors to
roost."
An extremely rare bird has been shot near Beverley. We wish it had
not been shot. It was a specimen of Macqueen's Bustard. We believe that
only one or two have hitherto been recorded in this country, and very few
on the Continent. It is, properly, an Asiatic species.
Mrs. Phillips (of Forest Hill) has a nest of two young Cordon Bleus,.
three days old. The eggs were hatched almost entirely by the cock, the
hen taking but little interest in them, and only sleeping in the nest at
night. It will be recollected that in the Magazine for last Juty, Mr.
Catleugh recorded the hatching of a nest of Cordon Bleus which lived for
ten days. Some few years ago Miss Bamford had three young birds of this
species which survived for fourteen days. It is believed that some English
aviculturists have succeeded in rearing this bird to maturity, but we cannot
find any detailed account of the event.
The actual rearing of a young Avadavat (Sporcsginthus amandava),.
related by Mr. Todd in the Magazine for November, is an extremely rare
event in this country. They have frequently been bred in Germany, but
very seldom in*England. The Rev. C. D. Farrar bred them in an outdoor
aviary in 1895, and this is the only other instance we know of. Mr. Todd
is to be heartily congratulated 011 his success.
The members of our Society are very devoted to their feathered
friends, but we question whether many of them would carry their devotion
so far as did a certain clergyman, who was greatly interested in the nest-
building of a pair of Tits. He believed the Tits to be very much in want
of hair with which to complete their nest, and having no other hair to give
them, he cut off his unusually fine beard and laid it on the window-sill of
his dressing-room. He had the satisfaction of seeing his beard speedily
woven into the nest. Mr. G. D. Leslie, R.A. relates the story on the
authority of a Bishop, so it ought to be true.
Birds, when perching, always keep their heads towards the wind.
The direction of the wind may frequently be told by watching the position
of birds.

<bodyText confidence="0.995322130434783" page_id="32635037"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I must begin by complimenting you on the charming number
\0x25A0with which the new series of the Avicultural Magazine begins. Plates --good
coloured plates--of the various birds are what all amateurs want. How
many can realise a bird from the scientific description ?
Now, the point of my letter is to say that I see, in "Avicultural
Small-Talk," a recommendation to bird lovers to try the Senegal Parrot as
a pet. I have long had the opinion that these, and the allied Riippell's, and
Meyer's Parrots would make charming pets; but they must be procured
tame and free from fever , to which they are as liable as the Grey Parrot.
It is curious that, according to my experience, the fever which is so
destructive to Grey Parrots, is confined to them and Peeocephali. I have had
an Amazon in the room with Grey Parrots and Senegals, everyone of which
was swept off by it, but it was quite unaffected; nor do the Parrakeets
seem liable to it.
It is a pity that no one will try and cultivate the bacillus and
inoculate Grey Parrots with it Birds safe through the fever would com-
mand a good price. At present, buying a recently-imported Grey Parrot or
Senegal from a shop is sheer waste of money.

A PET TROUPIAL.
Sir, --It has been suggested to me that it may interest some of your
readers if I give a short account of a Troupial that we have had for the last
seven-and-a-half years.
In the summer of 1SS9, my husband sent it home to me from New
Barcelona, in Venezuela, where he was then residing. He had bought it of
a negro boy, who was carrying it on his hand in the street and exhibiting
iLby letting it sit on his finger. Not having a cage in readiness, on
reaching home my husband turned it loose into an enclosed courtj^ard,
where it at once made itself at home, never attempting to fly further away
than to the roof of a neighbouring house ; and soon after a friend brought it
to England, and from that time till now, under the name of "The Baby,"
it has been the pet and plaything of the house.
With the fear of cats before me, I keep the Baby in a cage, but
constantly let him out to hop about the room. The window opening into a
greenhouse, on warm days he loves to flit about among the plants searching
for insects; and though at times he gets into disgrace by opening the buds
of the flowers with his beak to see what they may contain, I forgive him, as
he devours an immense amount of green fly and other troublesome insects.
Hardly any inseft comes amiss, but he chiefly delights in earwigs, black
beetles, spiders and all sorts of flies. He sits on my finger and catches flies
off the window with extraordinary rapidity, and when I gather a bunch of
roses I always bring them to him and he will deftly lift ever} r petal in search
for earwigs.
In his cage he is fed with sop, sponge cake, biscuits and fruit; and
in winter, when it is difficult to keep him supplied with insects, he occasion-
ally has a little chopped raw meat. At afternoon tea, he often has a

spoonful of milk with a lump of sugar in it, which he greatly enjoys. He
always has a bath hung over the door of his cage, but he never goes into it,
but contents himself with flicking the water over himself with his beak--\0x25A0
this he will do several times in the day. In the summer he is often hung
out of doors or allowed to spend the day in a sunny aviary.
During the first winter we had him he became very ill, lost his
plumage, moped and was very weak, and we feared he was going to die, so
I put him in a little basket on a bed of cotton wool with hot flannel over
him, and he soon began to recover. Since then, summer and winter, he
has always gone to bed in that same basket. When his bed and blanket have
been well warmed, the basket is held to the cage door and Baby at once
jumps in and nestles down, and is then covered up with his hot blanket
with only the tip of his nose sticking out. The basket is tied down and
placed on a table with a cloth over it to keep the warmth in. If, on getting
into his basket, he finds the bed has not been warmed, instead of nestling
down he hops back into his cage and " cheeps " in a plaintive, discontented
voice. In the morning, when his basket is opened, he usually hops out
and begins a loud, cheerful whistle; but sometimes, when, on putting his
nose out he finds it cold, he just cuddles down again, as much as to say,
"You have called me too earl}&apos;." I am sure that heat is life to the Baby.
As I sit by the fire in the evening he loves to creep under a fold in my dress
on my lap and will remain there quiet for an hour, or he will sit nestled
under my chin while I am writing letters, only now and then making a
dart at the feather of the pen if it comes too near him.
With me he is never cross, but with my husband he dearly loves to
have a fight: he is placed on his back on the table and then my husband
attacks him with his fingers, and the bird strikes at him with his sharp
pointed beak with all his force, but shows no signs of fear, for he allows
himself to be rolled about and lifted up by his tail, and all the time he
keeps up his sharp, clear, pretty whistle. If strangers come into the room
the Baby will fly on to their heads and attack them or their hats in a fury.
But his bite noire is the housemaid's cap : on two occasions he escaped out
of an open window and flew on to the roof of the house, but each time the
housemaid came into the garden and the bird at once flew down on to her
cap and was so intent upon tearing it to pieces that he allowed himself to
be caught readily.
Curiosity is the Baby's besetting sin : when loose in the room he
pokes his head into everything, opens books and peeps in between the
leaves, lifts the lids of little boxes and turns over papers; but the first
thing he makes for is the inkstand, lifts the lid and, unless stopped, will
drink the ink !
In conclusion, I may say that I am at all times delighted to show my
bird to anyone who takes an interest in such pets--and he has many
visitors. S. I. P. Barkley.

for his. My concluding remarks were merely incidental. I cordially
accept the explanation that " Varet " did not intend to imply the equal
delicacy of the Redstart and the Willow-wren. His mention of the Wood-
wren in such a connection was an obvious slip, and I thought it right to
draw attention to it in the interests of the accuracy of the Magazine: I am
sorry if I made too much of it. A year or two ago I saw a Willow-wren at
a Bird Show catalogued as a Wood-wren, and I am told that this is not
unusual: so it seems that some confusion exists upon the subject.

RAW MEAT FOR BIRDS ; ZINC FOOD-PANS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994040129032258" page_id="32635039"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I should like to have the experience of members on the subject
of raw meat as food for insectivorous birds. I once saw a letter in which
the writer attributed the death of a Thrush to its having been fed on raw
meat at a show. In India, it is a very general practice of bird dealers to
give raw meat to insectivorous birds: but after being chopped, it is
washed, so that the blood, as it is called, may be washed out. They say
that leaving the blood in the meat causes looseness. I have followed the
above plan of preparing raw meat for my birds for a long time, and have
found it agree with them. I first scrape the meat, which, I think, is more
satisfactory than chopping it. The meat, being in a small plate or
saucer, water is poured on to it, and the meat is spread out so that every
particle of it comes in contact with the water. A piece of cloth about the
size of my hand is then placed in one hand, and the meat and water-
emptied into it, the meat being squeezed as dry as possible. It is then
made into pellets of the required size between the fingers. One advantage
in washing the meat is, that it removes all stickiness, and when made into
pellets they remain separate instead of sticking together, as they would do
if made from unwashed meat. The stickiness of chopped and unwashed
meat renders it very inconvenient in feeding, as a great deal of it gets
scattered about the cage. I also give my birds cooked meat -when more
convenient. Instead of chopping it, I have latel} T taken to tearing off bits
with my thumb nail. Each bit is then rolled into a pellet between my
thumb and forefinger. My reason for adopting this plan is that, when
cooked meat is underdone, it is too adhesive after being chopped, and by
the tearing process I can regulate the size of the pellets to the size of the
bird. Of course my process of making pellets would be too tedious for a
large number of birds.
(2). I think I have read somewhere that food or water pans should
not be of zinc on account of its being more or less of a poisonous nature.
I should like to know if such is the case, and the nature of the poison.

The following reply was sent to Mr. Speed :--
1. The best " meating-off" food for Bullfinches is privet berries:
give them plentj&apos; of these, and scatter crushed hemp and other mixed
seeds about on the floor. Gradually diminish the hemp and privet berries.
2. They are best kept for the first month, at least, in box cages (i.e.:
those which only open in front). Food should be scattered on the floor
as well as placed in a dish. Both food and water dishes should be inside the
cage. The cage should, for the first few days, be placed in a semi-dark
position, and during that time they should be left very quiet. If you have
an old cage Bullfinch you can put in with them, so much the better. After
they are meated-off it matters little whether they are kept in a cage or an
aviary, of course they shew themselves off best in the latter.

The hemp should not be diminished much, but they should have free
access to other seeds. After about a fortnight the hemp need not be
crushed. J. Lewis Bonhote.
RUFFS.
Sir, --Referring to Messrs. Hett's and Bonhote's letters, as I have
kept Ruffs and Reeves more than once in past days, perhaps a few words
further about them may be of interest.
I found them very easy to feed: game meal, crissel, ants' eggs,
preserved yolk of egg (for these birds better than fresh)--nearly any soft
food mixture will do, but the plainer the better, for they quickly ]ay on fat.
In ordinary weather I give short (comparatively) billed birds of this kind
simply the leavings from the insectivorous birds' saucers, with an occasional
mealworm.
The Ruffs, in the spring, are a great nuisance, charging madly and
without cessation at every small and timid ground-bird in their aviary. I
have had a Woodcock permanently and two or three Snipes fatally injured
by being frightened into reckless flight; and eventually I had to part with
the Ruffs, but not without regret. The tiny Rock Quails were sometimes too
much for them : squatting like a stone, and on the path from preference,
they would wait until the Ruff was nearly on them, when they would
spring sideways about a foot; again and again would the Ruff turn and
charge, only to be foiled each time in the same manner, until, quite crest-
fallen, the bully would pretend he had an engagement elsewhere and would
hurry away after more taiigible quarry. They gave me the appearance
of being cowards, for they never charged home at birds that stood their
ground, a look being sufficient to turn them off in another direction.
The Reeves (females) are charming little things, quiet and peaceful,
and for most of the year every whit as pretty as their lords; diligently and
silently they quarter over the ground, picking the smallest insects off the
blades of grass without perceptibly causing them to shake ; when we sat
in the garden they would come feeding around us as tame as chickens, but
infinitely more graceful.
For two j&apos;ears running one of my Reeves nested, sitting, however,
very timidly; some of the eggs were partially hatched, but the first year
were destroyed by the male, the second probably by the Purple-headed Glossy
Starlings. As with other polygamous birds, either several females should

<bodyText confidence="0.986190133333333" page_id="32635041"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
be supplied to each male (a difficult matter to arrange in this county, as so
few females are imported), or the male should be removed, for the female
will sit very well without him, and would doubtless rear her young under
favourable circumstances; my own aviaries were too crowded for any
reasonable hope of success. On one occasion I found a female Wood-
cock composedly sitting On the Reeve's eggs, but she did not lay, much
to my disappointment, hike other ground-birds, they do not carry the
materials to the nesting-places. As the female walks about, every bit of
hay or stuff, suitable or unsuitable, that comes in her way, is chucked over
her shoulder in the direction of the nest, and later on chucked a stage
nearer. The eggs were often moved from one place to another.
These birds used to be exceedingly common in the fens ; but are now
011I3&apos; occasional visitors to our shores. Those which appear every summer
are brought over from Holland.
When first received, the tips of both wings should be cut off, but after
the moult, in a large aviary, they will flyabout without hurting themselves;
and a pretty sight it is to see these birds and their relatives on the wing.
My birds were in the open garden summer and winter, and never ailed ;
but there are several sheds and thick bushes about, under which they would
seek shelter if they required it; nevertheless, they seemed to feel severe,
cold. During frost and snow I used to lay down liajr, sacking, etc., which
they seemed to find a great comfort. If the wings of Mr. Hett&apos;s birds have
been closely cropped after the usual custom, and a valuable part of their
clothing thus removed, shelter will be desirable : a mound thrown up in a
suitable place, with a covering two or three feet above, will probably attract
them.
A good part of the ground should be turfed over, for they will not do
well 011 gravel; they are fen lovers by nature.

THE GODDEN-CRESTED WREN.
Sir, --Would you kindly oblige by giving me a little information
respecting the treatment of Golden-crested Wrens ?
E. Griffiths.
The following reply was sent to j\lr. Griffiths :--
The real secret of keeping these birds is the necessity of an unlimited 1
supply of insects or their equivalent. I should keep them in a cage open
only at the front, and place the cage in a moderately warm room. As staple
food I should recommend hard-boiled egg passed through a wire sieve, and
ants' eggs ; in addition to this they must have as many insefls as can
possibly be got. Mealworms are rather heating, although they may be
given sparingly. In default of fresh insects give them a piece of scraped
raw beef every day. The food is best given in china dishes, which can
be thoroughly cleaned every day. They should, of course, have an
abundance of fresh clean water.

PETREL.
By the Rev. Hubert D. Asteey, F.Z.S.
As we steamed in a trim little launch on the waves of the
broad Atlantic amongst a group of islands whose whereabouts
may perhaps be guessed, but not stated positively, the blueness
and brilliancy of a June sky were overhead; the Cormorants and
Shags were fishing on either side of us ; the water, when one
looked down into its depths, was clear as crystal, and the brown
and orange sea-plants could be seen waving long graceful tresses,
on which numerous anemones were anchored with mauve and
.green tentacles : the flowers of the ocean..
Now and then the forests under the waves were skirted by
broad stretches of sand, protruding from which one caught
glimpses of other species of anemones, preferring in the order
of their nature to fasten themselves more firmly, pushing their

tentacles above the surface [of the foundation of the rock and
stones to which they are fixed, so that only their disks of
marbled pink and brown and grey studded like blossoming
bulbs the smoothness of the glistening sand, where here and
there walks with solemn side-gait an evil-looking crab with
outstretched pincers. A separate world, one would think, a world
from which on calm summer days the veil seems to be lifted in
part, a world of which it may be said one sees as it were through
a glass, and that darkly for the most part, only filling us with the
desire to see and to know more, a place where fishes dart and
gleam, where a myriad creatures of the ocean expand and throw
up feelers and tentacles and feathery crowns painted with a
myriad hues, where shells are twisted as fanciful trumpets and
horns, scalloped and fluted and ribbed and coloured--such
colours! palest rose-leaf pink, saffron yellow, deep iridescent
blues and mother-of-pearl.
On, over all these mysterious depths we steam, rolling and
tossing as we meet the incoming tide and leave the shelter of
the shore. We are now where the waves are travelling on,
meeting the swell of the great Atlantic, and the face of the
waters behind us can vie with the colours of the Mediterranean,
so vivid is it in stretches of blue and purple and green.
Ahead of us lies a group of islands, one of which is long
and low in shape, except for the extreme western end, where the
rocks are broken up into giant haycocks, against which, even on
the calmest days, the spray and the surf are ever dashing and
breaking.
To-day there is from the distance but little white foam to
be seen, which assures us that our landing will be effected, for
the sailors know by the amount of swell what our success might
be.
The island in question is the home in the nesting-season
of thousands of Puffins and Manx-Shearwaters. The Resser
Black-backed Gulls are there too : a large colony! besides a
sprinkling of Oyster-catchers, Ringed Plovers, Terns, and
Herring Gulls.
Now the Puffins begin to show themselves; first two or three
almost under the stern of the launch, as she hurries to our
destination.
Quaintest of quaint little birds (I am sure they live to the
age of Methuzelah !) ; one popping with a neat header under the
waves, which sets us on the look-out to see where he will " bob
up serenely from below;" two or three others pattering along
the surface, so close that each wave as they flutter along catches

their breasts, and stops their hurry-scurry, until they settle on
the surface of the water again, looking round at us with quickly-
turning heads and paddling feet--One might believe them at
those moments to be automatic toys.
There are some more, six or seven, and more again, and
now several fly past with their small quickly-beating wings, one
overhead having three or four sand-eels in his brilliant parrot
bill; he is on his way to his fluffy soot-coloured baby which is
sitting in the burrow under the thrift tufts, squeaking with
hunger.
But enough about our dear quaint friends the " Puffs," as
we call them, for more about them another day. It is true we
were going on purpose to pay them a visit, but our attention has
been distracted. For to-day the Puffins are left to themselves,
and can come and go without our paying them over-much
attention.
Anchoring the launch at a trustworthy distance from a
shore which, above high water mark and below it, is all rocks and
boulders, we have jumped into the boat which we towed in our
wake, and rowing to an inlet, have landed in safety, carrying our
luncheon with us.
The atmosphere of the island is as an oven compared with
the breeze on the sea, and the odour of sea-birds is apparent.
No wonder, for they are everywhere ! In earth and on it, in air
and water. It is positively bewildering--the air is as full of
birds as it is of bees when they are swarming. Under our very
feet they have burrowed, and are sitting. On the rocks and
thrift tufts all over the island they are standing. In the bays
there are thousands floating on the water, and beneath them are
more, diving in hundreds.
The whole island is fringed with rough boulders and large
stones, lying upon the top of one another to a height of three or
four feet from the sandy foundation, just beyond the high-tide
boundary.
As we walk along, stumbling from time to time through
the soft Puffin-burrowed soil, we can hear the comical notes of
the Puffins themselves, a great many of which are on their eggs,
not only under the soil, but also under those loose stones and
rocks, beneath which they have shuffled in where passages are to
be found.
That there was anything besides Puffins and Razor-bills
had not crossed our minds.

We had heard of the Storm-Petrels nesting habitually
under huge rocks in very inaccessible places upon a smaller
island that lies more to the westward of the group we are
visiting, but never on the island we are now exploring.
The Puffins and the Razor-bills give vent to uncanny
grunts and groans, which sometimes sound as if their "tummies" -
were aching badly ; but as I stumble over the boulders, what is
that curious croaking chatter immediately beneath my feet ? Now
it has stopped--yes ! but there is a similar sound only a yard away.
It might be a frog, or a swallow, and yet not quite--something
between the croak of the former and the warbling of the latter.
I am on my knees in a moment, for it is a vocal sound that is
new to me. There again ! with my ear to an opening amongst
the stones, it is distinctly just below me.
The voice of a bird ! what can it be ? I must remove the
big stones to satisfy curiosity--curiosity stirred by keen excite-
ment ! And this lends me strength ! The June sun is broiling
down, its heat reflected into one's face from the stones them-
selves ; but the mystery must be solved, and taking off my coat
I bend myself to the task, removing with much exertion stones
of no light weight, and striving whilst so doing to keep smaller
ones, dislodged from their positions, from rolling into the hollow
I am making. There again! the same frog-like chattering L
What does the heat matter, the risk of a sunstroke or an
apoplectic fit, which I confess seems imminent. What does a
bruised nail signify, or a bleeding knuckle ?
I am two feet down now, and cannot be far from the
foundation. An old Puffin grunts close by me, and pops his
head out with a queer squint in his right eye as he turns it up
and looks at me as much as to say--"What on earth are you
interfering here for ? Spratts and sand-eels ! blazes and turf ! do
leave us alone; you've already dropped four pebbles on my back,
and sent a shower of sand into my left eye."--with which he
pops back again, and I hear him scrimmaging off by another
way : he is evidently greatly perturbed ! So I proceed with my
employment, and after chucking out some smaller stones as
large as my head, remove one, immediately beneath which is
sitting what at first sight might be a House-Martin, a bird of
much the same size, sooty-black all over except for a beautiful
snow-white patch above the tail. At once I see that it is a
Storm-Petrel, and as she only shuffles two or three inches awajq
revealing in so doing a round white egg, minutely dotted with

red speckles, on which she is sitting, I take her in my hands to
admire her beauty.
The small black bill is opened to eject with a sudden spurt
some greenish oil, which action is repeated as, on loosing the
bird from my grasp, she flits rapidly across the shore twisting
and turning in her flight from one side to another until she
reaches the ocean's surface, over which, with Swallow - like
motions, she is quickly lost to view.
It was uncourteous to have disturbed her and her mate,
whom I found behind a large stone not a foot from where her
egg was laid, and who in his turn was lifted up in brief captivity
to be granted the freedom on the briny waves for which he was
struggling.
In the ordinal course of their daily life they would have
sat snugly under the rocks in the semi-darkness until the sun
had neared the horizon and was sinking in a splendour of
golden glory, lighting up the waves as they rolled on and on in
ever-widening grandeur, until with a roar they were broken one
by one against massive rocks and granite boulders.
Like the Petrels, we lingered until the day was dying,
before we too were launched over the waves on our homeward
voyage, leaving regretfully the interests and beauties of the
sea-birds' isle.
A WALK IN THE " JARDIN D'ACCLIMATATION "
OF PARIS.
By O. Ernest Cressweee.
No aviculturist should lose an opportunity of seeing the
Jardin d'Acclimatation of Paris. I have often been astonished
to meet people who think they know Paris well, and yet have
never been through these charming Gardens. Situated as they
are, just within the Bois de Boulogne, and just outside the Porte
Maillot, which is reached through the Arc de Triomphe by
probably the most striking avenue in any European capital, they
may well be taken at the beginning or end of a drive in the
fashionable Bois. The real lover of birds will, like myself,
hardly be satisfied with such a visit by the way, but will find
much to occupy him for a long morning, if not for a long
afternoon too. An omnibus from the Rue de Rivoli takes one
to the Porte Maillot, whence it is but a few steps across the
broad avenue to the station of the Miniature Tramway; this, at

least in my own experience, is an unique specimen of public
conveyance. The gauge is very narrow, and is traversed every
few minutes by little long cars drawn by pairs of really flying
little ponies, some Javanese, some Javanese and Shetland
crossed, for which the establishment is famed. In a few minutes
one is whisked through about half-a-mile of the Bois, across
several of its drives to the gates of the Jardiu. Here I always
descend, but the line is carried on through the Garden to
various stations, so that a bad walker may see most of it with
a minimum of fatigue.
The place has always had a great fascination for me.
I remember it quite in childhood, and delighted then, as I
delight now, in the great multitude of many species of birds,
especially of aquatic birds, which are seen together. I never
realized the exquisite beauty of Mandarin Ducks till I once saw
here 120 together on the water. I have known the Garden in
many phases of gradual progress. I had not seen it for three
years till this Autumn, when I spent parts of two days in it on
my way to and my return from more Southern regions. For
those of our Society who do not know it, or have not visited it
of late, I have jotted down these few notes.
The establishment is partially botanical. From each side
of the wide entrance-road, walks radiate off to fine tropical glass
houses ; but we are now only concerned with the birds, so keep-
ing to the right we pass long fern houses, and soon come to an
aviary for Budgerigars. It is very shallow for its length, glazed
above, and leans against a heated Monkey-house. I have before,
as this year, observed that the large colony of its inmates look
chilly and less sprightly than the occupants of a more open
aviary, which quite confirms the opinion of many aviculturists
that Budgerigars are none the better for coddling. Among them
I observed two or three cock Redrump Parrakeets, in lovely con-
dition and apparently of amiable disposition. This is interesting,
for some authorities give them very bad characters as persecutors
of smaller birds. I have a great favourite of the race, which I
bought years ago at the Antwerp Zoo. I have never trusted him
with other birds, for I must say he does not look amiably at them.
Why it should be so difficult, as I have found it, to obtain hens
of this breed, I cannot understand. From the Budgerigars' aviary
we next come to a fine row of Pheasantries--well-arranged Sum-
mer abodes, for Pheasants like shelter, but a little too shady for
Winter. I specially admired some Reeves' and Elliott's Pheasants,
some handsome Firebacks (Euplocamus veilloti) and above all a
splendid pair of Temminck's Tragopans, as sleek and hard in

feather as they might be in their native Himalayas. In one of
these Pheasant enclosures were some Australian Bronze-winged.
Pigeons (Phaps chalcoptera) which the French call Eumachelles.
In feathered nature there is little more lovely than the wing of a
Bronze-wing cock, especially of a Tasmanian one (for these are
more brilliant, though in no other respedt different from their
Australian relatives) catching the rays of the sun. I have had
several in my own aviaries, and they were a constant source of
delight to visitors. The bird stands in one position, and the
wing glances gold and green with opaline prismatic tints; he turns
a few inches, and it flashes red like rubies. They want a sunny
aviary, alike to do justice to their plumage and to keep them in
health. I have not succeeded in keeping them more than two
or three years--few so long--though I have had some bred in
English aviaries. In our damp air they seem subject to con-
sumption, though mine never appeared to suffer from even
severe frost.
We come next to another aviary of Budgerigars, partially
glazed over, but apparently not heated; its multitude of tenants
looked happier and harder in feather than the others. Among
them were two or three lovely Yellow-rumped Rosellas ( Platy-
cercus flaveolus ).* I have sometimes wondered (and, I think, seen
it suggested by others) whether this sub-variety of Platycercus
could be the offspring of a Red-headed and a Mealy Rosella.
An Australian lady who once saw my own favourite Mealy
{Platycerais palliceps&apos;), which, alas ! succumbed to sunstroke from
accidental exposure, told me that she had known a single Pale-
headed bird in Australia which always accompanied a flock of
the commoner Red-headed.
Semi-detached from the Budgerigars' aviary is another,
tenanted by Cockatiels, mostly in nice plumage, and Ring-necked
Bengal Parrakeets of which I cannot say the same.
From here I digressed a minute to the left, to see who was
the vocalist of the sweetest piping. I found a large double cage,
well raised from the ground, but terribly exposed to wind and
weather. In the first compartment were some Choughs with
their bright red beaks and legs ; in the second, the songster--
an Australian Black and White Crow.
Next we come to a grand range of Aviaries, in a charming
sunny position, and most imposing from their great height and
great united length. They have only recently been completed.
The two end aviaries are immense, and stand out far beyond the
* The Yellow-rumped " Parrakeet" (not " Rosella,") P. flaveolus , is a
well recognised species in the genus Platycercus. --R.P.

fifteen others, with round ponds in their centres. The first is
chiefly tenanted by the Ibis tribe, the roseate hues of some of
which are most beautiful. Each of the fifteen smaller aviaries
has two inner apartments, one below, the other above. The
objedt, apparently, of the upper floor is to accommodate races
which like to roost aloft, and to give a quiet retreat to shy birds.
Certainly, this great height shows to the utmost advantage birds
of elegant flight. I specially observed this in the case of some
long-tailed Glossy Starlings and Blue Magpies. In one com-
partment were strange companions--Peacocks and Pigeons--the
latter the " Triangular-spotted Pigeon " of the Cape (Columba
guinea ?) said to be there very numerous and very destructive to
the crops. It is a handsome bird, blue, with maroon markings,
seldom to be met with in England and then by far too dear.
In the next I coveted a lovely Sonnerat's Jungle Cock.
Not far off was another, both without mates--I suspedt the
survivors of a quartette, imported by an English dealer, and
all sold to the Directorate of these Gardens ; a pair of which I
was disappointed not to get. In Odtober, a Bantam hen was the
companion of one, and was wickedly employed in pecking out
his spangled neck-hackle ; in November, I was glad to find her
removed.
Then come cobalt Vulturine Guinea-fowls, and the great-
est of the Columbine tribe, the Great-crowned Pigeon (Goura
coronatci ) ; then lovely Siamese Fireback Pheasants (. Euplo-
camus ignitus ) which our older ornithologists called the
" Macartney cock," in compliment to the great ambassador.
Then a collection of Pennant's Parrakeets and Mealy Rosellas--
the contrast of the rich glowing plumage of the former, and the
soft shades of lavender and canary of the latter is beautiful,
and the races seem to live in perfect harmony. Then Troupials
and various foreign Pigeons; then more Bronze-wings, and
more Pheasants ; and in the great end aviary a collection of
small Ducks, Mandarins, Carolinas and others, and various of
the Penelope tribe. Forty-five years ago, in the charming old
" Dovecote and Aviary," Mr. Dixon wrote of the Curassows and
Guans as a possible addition in the future to our domestic birds.
I believe they are to-day no nearer domestication than they were
then, and I cannot say that I much admire them, either in the
" Eastern Aviaries " of the Regent's Park, or in their still larger
Parisian abode. They are by nature arboreal in their habits,
and, doubtless, to be seen to advantage should be seen flying
rom bough to bough, in their native South American forests.

Chrysomitris icterica, Licht.
By V. Castellan.
This charming little bird belongs to a group of small true
finches which is distributed over a large portion of both the Old
and New Worlds: being represented in Abyssinia, the Himalayas,
Siberia, the United States, and especially South America. To
the latter continent belongs the subjedt of my article, being an
inhabitant of Brazil and the Argentine Republic as far as Pata-
gonia. This species seems to be partially migratory in some
distridts. The colouring of this Siskin is yellow and black and
almost the same as that of our English Siskin, except that the
whole head is black instead of only having a black cap, like the
latter. The female, which I have never seen alive, but only
know from a plate, seems to be much lighter in colour and with
a great deal of grey about her, and the head is not black.
They build their nests in the hollows formed by the small
branches and the trunks of trees, and always prefer a poplar
to build in. The nest is well made of several materials, lined
with horsehair, down, or feathers. The eggs are delicate, small,
and pure white : which is very curious in the case of a bird that
builds an open nest. This species lives in small flocks, even in
the breeding season, roving about in small communities with a
rapid undulating flight. They feed chiefly on the ground, where
seeds of various wild plants are consumed.
This lively and graceful little bird has not much of a
song ; it consists of a variety of short twittering notes, uttered
very rapidly and continuously. The specimen I possess is only
a moderate songster, but is very lively, being almost always on
the move. He is inclined to be somewhat quarrelsome with his
cage-mate, a hen Canary, with whom he has lived now for over
a year, without, however, showing any signs of pairing. I still
hope to be able to breed mules with him, as I believe such a
thing has already taken place. He has been in my possession
for nearly two years, I having bought him after the Crystal
Palace Show, 1895, where he was shown by a dealer, newly im-
ported and in poor condition. Having successfully got through
his moult, and being in perfect condition, he easily won first
prize at the last Palace Show.
I think this Siskin is quite hardy (as are most of his kind)
and that he would do very well in an aviary. So far I have not

tried him out of doors ; but in my bird-room, where the tempera-
ture has fallen as low as 45 degrees, he has never shown any
signs of discomfort; and during the whole time I have had him,
he has never ailed in the least. I hear that Mr. Erskine Allon
has some half-dozen of this species in his bird-room, and that
his experience agrees witli mine as to their hardiness. My bird
moults regularly every Autumn without any trouble ; he is,
however, not very fond of bathing, so that now and again I have
to spray him.
His food is very simple, consisting principally of canary
and rape seed, the latter being very much to his liking; he
also has, now and then, some linseed and any other fancy seeds
for a change.
This Siskin is by no means common, as I have only
seen two besides mine: one at the last Palace Show, where
he was entered in the wrong class, and the other at the
last Aquarium Show, where, as far as I remember, he was
noticed by the judge. This little bird, I think, is very desirable
on account of his pretty though dark plumage, pleasing ways,
and lively song. -

Chrysomitris spimis, Einn.
By Thomas Marshall.
This lively and altogether delightful little member of the
Fringillidtz family is so truly a cosmopolitan in its habits that a
list of the places where it is not to be found would probably be
the easiest method of dealing with its habitat, but when I say
that its proper home appears to be in the north of Europe, I
think that for present purposes I shall have said all that need be
said on that point. I will venture to add, however, that it
is more common in England than is generally supposed. A
bird-dealer acquaintance of mine, who gets consignments of
Kinnets from various parts of the Midlands, frequently has a
few Siskins amongst them.
Speaking of Siskins to a bird-catcher (aviculture, like
poverty, brings us into contadl with queer folk) he told me that
he had been catching, off and on, for forty years, and had in his
time taken as many as seven dozen Siskins " at a pull," but then
that only occurred in one of their flight years, because, he'd have
me to know, that Siskins only visit England in flocks at intervals
of seven years ! Truly we live and learn.
As a cage-bird, the Siskin is much more desirable than
many birds generally included under that head. It takes kindly

to captivity, and with reasonable care and attention soon adapts
itself to its new surroundings and becomes quite tame. It
seems blessed with a prodigious appetite, and for a bird of its
size consumes an enormous quantity of food. As it only requires
and does best on plain canary seed as a staple (bemp seed and
maw seed are much appreciated in addition) the aviarist need
not begrudge the little chap his living, especially when we are
able to record the fadt that, when not eating, it is either singing
its quaint little song, or attending to its toilet.
It, as frequently as not, prefers to roost, if it can be called
" roosting," on the wires, whether of cage or aviary, and some-
times head downwards. In its acrobatic performances it has
something in common with the Titmice, and there is some
resemblance in their respective bills.
I have never been able to understand why we see so few
Siskin hybrids, because, in my experience, it is almost as ready
to pair with other finches as the Greenfinch, which is saying a
great deal. It is a matter of ancient history, however, for
Mudie, writing fifty } r ears ago, tells us that the hybrid produced
between the Siskin and the Canary Finch is very handsome and
fertile ! Certainly the Siskin-Canary mule (I suppose I must
refer to a bird with a Canary for one of its parents, asa" mule "
and not as a " hybrid ") is, to my mind, far prettier than some of
the crosses which are produced in greater numbers.
In common with the other members of the finch family,
the Siskin offers us some interesting varieties; some being
much brighter in colour and markings than others, the differences
in the cap especially being very noticeable. Some have the cap
black and unbroken, while others have it laced, i.e., the margins
of the head-feathers are tinged with grey, giving the cap a
spangled appearance, which, in a good specimen, has a very
pleasing effect. A little patch of black feathers under the chin
is, on some, very conspicuous, but on others hardly noticeable.
Writing in this connexion, it is curious to record how
superior in colour and markings the genuine English-caught
Siskin is, as a rule, to that of the Siskins sent to us by continen-
tal dealers ; all of which seem to bear a more or less washed
out appearance, and run smaller in size than those from our
midland counties. I say it is curious, because just the reverse
obtains in the case of the continental Goldfinches and Redpolls.
It would be interesting to know the cause of these differences,
and I think it would form a good subjedt for discussion in the
pages of our Magazine at some future date.

THE DEFINITION OF A "BRITISH BIRD."
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.958999306122449" page_id="32635053"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
As there has been a considerable amount of discussion and some
difference of opinion on this subject, I think it may be of advantage for
me to briefly relate what has taken place, in order that the actual facts may
be placed on record.
After the letters published in the November Magazine, only one more
was received (from Mr. Harrison). The subject appeared to be one with which
the Council, as a body, were not altogether well qualified to deal, and it
was therefore proposed that it should be referred to a Special Committee
consisting of Dr. Butler, and Messrs. Bonhote, Marshall, Seth-Smith, and
Swaysland, with full power to settle the matter. This proposal was carried
by the Council. The members of the Special Committee are all " British
Bird men " and exhibitors, and were selected on account of this double
qualification.
The following series of questions was then submitted to the
members of the Special Committee, and the answers returned were
embodied in the definition published in " Notices to Members " last month.
There were some further questions, which were rendered useless by the
nature of the replies to No. 4. A copy of Mr. Howard Saunders' hist was
sent round to the Special Committee with the questions, and also Mr.
Harrison's letter.
Question 1.----Are you in favour of the Society preparing and publish-
ing an independent list of its own ? This was answered in the negative by a
majority of the Committee.
Question 2.--Are you in favour of adopting Mr. Howard Saunders'
list ? This was answered in the affirmative by all, one member adding
" with modifications."
Question 3.--If Mr. Saunders' List be adopted, are you in favour of
those birds the English names of which are printed in Italics being
excluded ? This was answered in the affirmative bj r all.
Question 4.---Are you in favour of a separate list for .Show purposes ?
This was answered in the negative by all.
The answers to the foregoing questions were then embodied in the
following definition: "For the purposes of the Society, "British Bird"
shall mean any individual (foreign Bullfinches and Goldfinches excepted)
of any species included in Mr. Howard Saunders' Eabel Fist of British
Birds (excluding those species the English names of which are in that list
printed in Italics.)"
O11 the 20th of November, 1S96, I wrote to the Manager of the Crystal
Palace informing him of the adoption by the Council of the above
definition, and suggesting its insertion in the Schedule of the next Palace
Show. In reply I received a letter from the Manager, thanking us for the
suggestion, but regretting that he did not see his way to " publish any
particular standard for judging British or other birds in the rules."
To this I replied, explaining that we had not suggested the publication of
standards for judging, and asking him " to give the matter a little further
consideration before he decided finally against it." I then received a letter
from the Manager, dated the 24th November, saying, "O11 further con-
sideration I have decided to print the note (mentioned in your former
letter) in the Schedule." I thereupon wrote to the Editor of the Feathered

World announcing that the Manager of the Crystal Palace had promised to
adopt our definition, and my letter appeared in that paper on the 4th of
December. A few days after, I received the following letter from the
Manager, dated the 7th of December: " Since writing you to say I would
have a notice re Standard for British Birds printed in the Schedule for 1S97,
I have had several letters protesting against the adoption of any such rule,
and I have also taken the opinion of the judges, who also consider that it
would not be advisable to publish any rule. Under the circumstances,
therefore, I shall leave the definition of a British bird to the judges, and
shall not print anything in the Schedule." To that letter I replied as
follows : " I think the Society has serious ground to complain of the course
which you have pursued. In mj^ last letter I asked you to give the matter
' a little further consideration before j-ou decide finally against it,' but I
did not ask you to at once pledge yourself to adopt the rule. However, in
your next letter you distinctly and unconditionally promised to adopt it,
and if, in so doing without consulting the judges, you acted unwisely, it
was not my fault. Now, after you have led me into announcing in the
Feathered World that you are going to adopt the Society's rule 3 r ou withdraw
from your promise and make the Society look extremely foolish. I consider
that you have treated the Society very badly."
I do not wish to make any comment, in this place, on what has
occurred, but I think everyone will agree with me that, if the Manager was
bound to defer to the opinion of the judges, he ought to have consulted
them in the first place.
By the same post as that by which I wrote to the Manager of the
Crj^stal Palace, I wrote to the Hon. Secretary of the National British Bird
and Mule Club, informing him of the adoption of the definition by our
Society, and inviting the co-operation of the Club in getting it generally
adopted. I added, " I should have much preferred previously to submit
the matter to your Society," (before writing to the Manager of the Crystal
Palace) "but as the time before the issue of their Schedule is now very
short, I did not think it would be possible to do so without abandoning all
hope of getting the rule into next year's Schedule."
It is important to bear in mind that the primary object of the rule
is that it may be a guide in the general affairs of the Societ} r , and that its
adoption or rejection as a Show rule will not affect its usefulness in other
ways.
Some letters on this subject appear in the Correspondence Columns
this month.

There are now, or were recently, some ver}^ rare new arrivals at the
Zoo. A pair of Franklin's Gulls (.Lams franklini) are the first of their species
to- make their appearance in Regent's Park. The same may be said of the
pair of White Rheas, which were only at the Gardens for a short visit on
their way to the residence of their owner (Mr. Walter Rothschild) at
Tring. The Common Rhea, the Great-billed Rhea, and Darwin's Rhea,
have all been seen at the Zoo, but the White Rhea never before. The bird

differs from the common Rhea americana in being white instead of grey,
with the exception of some feathers about the head and neck. Then there
is a Brazilian Courlau (Aramus scolopaceus). The last specimen, purchased in
1S75, died more than twenty years ago. The Courlan is about two feet in
length, and bears a general resemblance to a large Rail. Its general colour
is chocolate-brown, with a somewhat metallic lustre.
We have very great difficulty in accurately ascertaining the tastes
of the majority of our readers. We try to do the best we can for them,
and we believe that on the whole they are very well satisfied with the
fare provided, but we are a good deal in the dark as to what is most
appreciated and what left unread--we almost wish sometimes that the
members would grumble more, and then we should know better what to
avoid. We wish we could have a peep at our readers while they are
cutting open their Magazines, and see to which pages they first apply the
paper-knife.
It is certainly a pity that we cannot afford to give everyone coloured
plates without extra charge; but it is, and, what is more, always will be,
quite impossible. No increase in the number of members would ever
enable us to give away a hand-coloured plate each month, for the cost of
the hand-colouring of the extra copy required for each new member would
just about absorb his subscription. If, therefore, w r e are expecting an
increase of membership to enable us to give away a coloured plate monthly,
we are like the Irishman who sold his goods under cost price and
thought he made a profit by selling a large quantity. We must not, however,
jump to the conclusion that more members would be useless, for the fa6t
is they are wanted very badly, and the great drawback to the Society is its
comparatively small membership. If we had 300 members we could have
a plate every month (those who wish for it coloured paying extra for it)
and we could also have more illustrations in the body of the Magazine, like
Mr. Astley's charming drawing wdiich we publish this month. Will the
members please do their utmost this year to gain recruits so that next
year we may be able to afford a plate every month ?
We find that some of our remarks about the Feathered World in the
November Magazine have been misunderstood--they were perhaps a little
misleading. It is true that the correspondence in that paper is, of course,
unpaid (and we think the correspondence is the best part of the F. W.) but
most of the articles are paid for, and, of course, the Show Reports.
A member of the Society thinks that aviculturists ought to be warned
against trusting specimens of the genus Petronia among other birds. A
pair of Petrotiia fiavicollis "managed to kill, in a travelling box as they
were being brought from Marseilles, six Parrot Finches, four Lagonostica
brunneiceps, a Pectoral Finch, a Sydney Waxbill, and various Mannikins; a
little hole being neatly drilled in their heads." After this performance, we
are not surprised to hear that the happy possessor of these blood-thirsty
little birds keeps them in a cage, and does not trust them loose in his bird-
room. A well known dealer lost nearly #100 worth of birds through the
destructiveness of one cock of the same or a similar species.

We hear that one of the judges of British birds at the Crystal Palace
adtually threatened to resign if the Avicultural Society's definition of a
British bird were adopted. We may be mistaken, but we fancy that the news
of the resignation of either, or both, of the British judges would be received
by aviculturists generally with perfect equanimity.

Sir, --On behalf of the Committee of the British Bird and Mule Club,
I have addressed the following letter to the Crystal Palace Company, re the
acceptation by the Company of the Avicultural Society's decision that
"British Birds" shall mean any individual (foreign Bullfinches and Gold-
finches excepted) of any species included in Mr. Howard Saunders' Label
List of British Birds (excluding those species the English names of which
are printed in italics)
Dear Sir, --At the monthly meeting of the Committee of the British
Birds and Mule Club, held on Thursday last, it was proposed and carried
unanimously, that "the British Bird and Mule Club draw up a list of birds
that shall be entitled to compete for their gold medals given for most points
in British classes," and at the same meeting the information transpired that
the Crystal Palace Company would, at their forthcoming show, accept as
British birds all those species, the names of which were printed in capitals
in Howard Saunders' List. In a full Committee Meeting a long and
interesting discussion took place on the matter, and, in the end, I was
desired, as a vice-president and chairman of the Club, to point out to you
that such a regulation would admit among British Birds such species as the
Blue-throat, Barred-Warbler, Savi's-Warbler, Tawny-Pipit, Red-breasted
Ffycatcher, Two-barred Crossbill, Ortolan Bunting, Lapland Bunting, Nut-
cracker, Crested Lark, Short-toed Lark, and Bee-eater, not to mention many
other varieties which have never yet been admitted as British birds in show
competitions. I am further to mention that while the B.B. &amp; M.C. would
be most anxious not to oppose the Avicultural Societ)&apos;, yet the members of
the Committee feel that they cannot support a show at which the above-
mentioned birds are accepted as British birds. A satisfactory list of British
Birds for show purposes cannot be compiled from Mr. Howard Saunders'
list, which includes any bird of which six specimens have been shot, captured,
or seen during the past two hundred years or so, and our own list will not
be decided on without full discussion amongst our members and any others
who may be interested in the matter. Our Committee hope, therefore, that
the Avicultural Society's definition will not be accepted by the Crj&apos;stal
Palace Company, and that the British classes will be under the same con-
ditions as heretofore. That the Avicultural Society's adoption of Mr.
Howard Saunders' list is an unsatisfactory method of deciding a very
important question is best shewn by Mr. Fillmer's own note, "That even a
bad rule would be better than no rule at all." This may be, but in the near
future the Committee of the N.B.B. &amp; M.C. hope to frame a rule which will
not come under the category of bad rules.
On behalf of the Committee,
Yours faithfully,
The Manager, Crystal Palace Bird Show. Henry J. Fueej ames.

[The above letter appeared in Fur and Feather of the ioth December, and
the following answer in the same paper on the 17th December, 1896.]
Referring to the letter by Mr. Fnlljames in yonr issue of the iotli
inst., I regret to say that the manager of the Costal Palace Company has
withdrawn his promise to insert the Avicultural Society's rule in the schedule
of the Crystal Palace Show. Mr. Fulljames' letter, no doubt, assisted in
bringing this about, but I think the manager's acftiou has been mainly due
to the interference of some of the judges, who seem not to be content with
their judicial functions, but to aim at legislative powers also.
The Avicultural Society's rule was drawn up mainly with a view to
the general purposes of the Society, and its application to Bird Shows is of
merely secondary importance. It was, however, drawn up by a Special
Committee of our Council, after the most careful consideration of the whole
question, and that Special Committee unanimously rejected a proposal to
draw up a separate and independent list for show purposes. The objection
to a different list for show purposes is that it would have the effedt of ex-
cluding from the British classes at shows birds which are always recognised
as British species--we should then have a new riddle--"When is a British
Bird not a British Bird ? " Answer: " When it is at a Bird Show." There
is already a good deal that is illogical and unscientific about our Shows, and
we do not want to make them more absurd.
The objectors to the Avicultural Society's rule seem to be under the
impression that it would lead to the flooding of the British classes with
birds which have hitherto been excluded from those classes--I think I can
shew that this a mistake. For all practical purposes British Cage Birds may
be considered as belonging to one or the other of two orders, and those two
orders, under our rule, include 115 species. Of these, S5 are recognised as
British by everyone, and could not possibly be excluded from any list; one
of the others (the Alpine Swift), is not a Cage Bird, so that there are only
29 as to which there can be any dispute. These 29 are : White&apos;s Thrush,
the Black Redstart, the Bluethroat, the Barred Warbler, the Firecrest, the
Marsh Warbler, Savi's Warbler, the Alpine Accentor, the White Wagtail, the
Blue-lieaded Yellow Wagtail, the Tawny Pipit, Richard's Pipit, the Golden
Oriole, the Great Grey Shrike, the Woodchat Shrike, the Waxwing, the
Redbreasted Flycatcher, the Mealy Redpoll, the Two-barred Crossbill, the
Ortolan Bunting, the Dapland Bunting, the Rose-coloured Starling, the Nut-
cracker, the Crested Dark, the Short-toed Lark, the Shore Lark, the Roller,
the Bee-eatei - , and the Hoopoe. Of these species the Black Redstart, the
Marsh Warbler, the White Wagtail, the Blue-headed Yellow Wagtail, the
Golden Oriole, the Woodchat Shrike, and the Hoopoe, breed in this country ;
it would, therefore, be obviously preposterous to exclude them from any list
of British Birds. The Fire-crested Wren, the Mealy Redpoll, the Lapland
Bunting, and the Roller, have all been caught in considerable numbers.
Thus only 7 iS species are left as to which there can be any possible doubt. And
it must not be strpposed that the inclusion of these 18 species in the British
classes is an innovation, for during the last five years three of the 18
(namely, the Waxwing, the Shore Lark, and the Great Grey Shrike), have
been exhibited at the Palace as British Birds. Moreover, three other species,
not British under the Avicultural Society's rule, have been so exhibited.
These last are the Serin Finch, the Black-headed Bunting, and the Scarlet
Grosb eak. On the other hand, only two of these doubtful species--the

Waxwing and the Bluethroat--have, during the same period, been exhibited
in the Foreign classes.* It would, of course, be very desirable, if it were
possible, to exclude from the British classes all foreigu-caught specimens.t
But it is not possible, as in most species those caught in Britain are
absolutely identical in plumage with those caught elsewhere. Any attempt
to exclude an undoubtedly British species might lead to the great hardship
of the exclusion of some rare Britisli-cauglit specimens.
It is unnecessary for me to enlarge upon the urgent necessity for some
rule upon the subject. That is universally admitted. The Avicultural
Society has proposed a rule which the British Bird and Mule Club, and the
judges at the Crystal Palace, will not accept. It is now the duty of our
critics to at once propose a rule or list of their own. By adroitly quoting
my remark about a bad rule being better than no rule at all, Mr. Fulljanies
has almost made it appear as if I personally disapproved of the rule. This
is not so. I consider the rule the best which could be drawn up which
would have any chance of general acceptance. I confess that I am sceptical
as to the power of the Committee of the British Bird and Mule Club to draw
up a list or rule which will not be even more open to criticism. Neverthe-
less, as the Council of the Avicultural Society hasjno object in view but the
advancement of aviculture, it will, doubtless, gladly support any fair and
unprejudiced attempt to settle the matter. At the same time, the multiplica-
tion of rules and lists is to be deprecated, as it must lead to much confusion.
Horatio R. Fiixmer,
Hon. Sec. Avicultural Society.
Sir, --The promise of the Manager of the Crystal Palace to insert in
the Schedule of the forthcoming Cage Bird Show the Avicultural Society's
definition of a British bird, has called forth a considerable amount of
dissatisfaction from British bird exhibitors; the reason, I take it, being that
they are afraid of some rare bird taking the prize and their's going un-
noticed.
Nevertheless, I think it will not be long before exhibitors of British
birds come to the conclusion that it is far better to admit any species
included in the British list. To me it seems absurd to exclude a species
such as the Waxwing, which is a comparatively common winter visitor to
this country. On the other hand, nine out of ten of the Bearded Tits one
sees in British classes at Shows, may safely be considered as Continental
specimens.
We are not likely to see either Rollers or Bee-eaters at shows, but
should one appear it would be a rare treat for lovers of British birds.
No one is more in a position to decide what species are "British"
than Mr. Howard Saunders, who is undoubtedly one of the best authorities
* To put this argument more briefly and pointedly:--All the 115 species admissible
under the Society's rule are, and have been for years, admissible into the British classes at
the Palace Show. On the other hand several species, not British in any reasonable sense
of the word, but which have hitherto been exhibited in the British classes, would under
our rule be excluded from those classes. The Society's rule would, therefore, actually tend
to exclude doubtful species, not to admit them.--H. R. F.
t It should be remembered that most of the Siskins and Mealy Redpoles are foreign-
caught. Also that large numbers of Continental (not Russian) Bullfinches and Goldfinches
are exhibited as British without being questioned.--H. R. F.

on British birds of the present day. He has compiled a list of species, all
of which are admitted by the best authorities to be British. Then what
better definition of a British bird could there be than "any individual of
any species included in Mr. Howard Saunders' Label List of British birds
(excluding those species the English names of which are in that list printed
in italics) " ? And why should this list not be adopted at our principal bird
shows? My own opinion on the subject is this: we should accept any
species in the British classes that is recognised by the highest authorities of
the day as "British," and we should allow any specimen of that species
in the British classes, whether or not that individual was obtained within
the British Isles. If the species is included in the British list we should
admit the individual (irrespective of where it was obtained) as a representa-
tive of a recognised British species.
It is absolutely impossible to prevent foreign-cauglit birds from being-
exhibited in British classes, unless we exclude almost every rare bird, and
the British classes are of very small interest to many if no rare birds are
shown. I am quite sure that if rarer birds were admitted into the British
classes those classes would be far better appreciated by lovers of British
birds. D. SeTh-Smith.
Sir, -- The intended adoption of onr rule by the Crystal Palace
authorities seems to have stirred up a great deal of latent indignation, which,
personally, I was rather afraid it would. With your permission, I should
like to state my views on the subject, but, at the same time I wish it to be
clearly understood that these views are only my own individual opinions,
being put forward as such and without consulting any other members of the
Council. The facts of the case are already before you, and the position seems
to be as follows: --
On the one side stand the judges, who are adverse to a rule which
should in any way restrict their powers. Next comes the Manager of the
Show, who, after accepting our rule, rejects it, clearly shewing that he will
follow whichever side is the stronger. Lastly comes the B.B. &amp; M.C.,
together with a few other exhibitors, who see the necessity of a rule but
object to ours.
It does not seem to me that the Council would be justified in taking
any further steps, without learning first of all what the wishes of members
are on this subject. There are but two courses open; either to enter into
communication with the other Society or Societies (if there be any others),
in order that a rule, satisfactory to all exhibitors, should be drawn up, which
the Manager of the Palace Show might easilj- be forced to accept by the
threat to withdraw British bird entries should he refuse, which I am sure
he would not do under those circumstances. The other course is for the
Society to have no more to do with the matter. I think members should be
given an early opportunity of expressing their opinion on this matter.

BREEDING MEALWORMS.
Sir,--I have referred to the Index in the Avicultural Magazine, and
not finding any directions for successfully rearing these worms, if it is of
sufficient interest to our fellow-members, I will relate my experience.

It is getting on for twenty years since I first started the keeping of
foreign birds, and for three parts of that time I followed the directions
given in various bird books as to the proper way to get the worms to
propagate. I was fortunate up to the Chrysalis state--then each year these
were attacked by thousands of very minute insedls, which exterminated
them before they could turn into beetles. Then for food I "rung the
changes" by feeding them on barley meal, wheat flour, oatmeal, raw
potatoes and carrots, Spratt's dog biscuits whole--but I will not give all my
experiments in feeding. Perhaps what I am now about to state may be
a case of "coals to Newcastle" to some of your readers.
For the last two years I have filled the two gallon jars with layers
of thick brown paper and bi-an to within three inches of the top, and tied
a muslin cover over them. Occasionally the contents are overlooked, by
spreading a newspaper on a table and lifting out the different layers. From
these I pick out the fattest worms and drop them into a tin that measures
about 5 ins. high by 2^ ins. across. The food now supplied is thin captain's
biscuits ; and it is a wonderful sight to see a biscuit perforated by these
hungry little fellows--it reminds me of a skeleton leaf. Manicure nippers
are useful in picking up the selected worms.
As two years have elapsed without the chrysalides being destroyed by
their very tiny enemy, I consider that my manner of treatment has been
fairly tested.

THE AGE OF CAGE-BIRDS.
Sir, --In the November number our Secretary wishes for information
on the above subject, also whether white feathers appearing are caused by
age.
At the present time I have a hen Dwarf Finch, purchased in Nov.
1893, with white feathers in the tail. A hen Zebra Waxbill, bought 12th June
1S90, which went bare for some months at the back of the neck, has the
once bald space covered with a patch of white. A hen African Grey Wax-
bill, that came to me 011 nth June, 1S89, has white feathers in the tail.
To test how long these wee mites could live in captivity, I used to
buy a certain number of each species, and not obtain any more until the last
had died. Unfortunately, through my hanging a bath (with one of the
supports partly broken) at an open door of a large cage, my experiment
received a severe check, for a favourite Persian cat of my wife's was shut in
the room one evening, and managed to get the bath away, so that all my birds
were dead when morning came. Unhappily, three years afterwards, the cat
was again accidentally shut in the room, and there was a similar slaughter.
I give the age of the Waxbills at the time they were massacred :_
Green Avadavat, 6 years; Orange Breast, 7J years ; Orange Cheek, 8# years;
African Grey, 8 years ; St. Helena Waxbill, 7 |years ; Lavender Finch, SJ
years ; Cordou-bleu, 6 years.
I have been living in the country for the last 10 years, and know that
small finches and waxbills live longer in the pure air than when kept in a
town. The dreadful fogs used to make the Avicultural Death Rate rapidly
rise.

fellows will stay until they receive their call to depart to their Happy
Hunting Grounds, I trust that I may live long enough to send you certifi-
cates of " Death from Old Age " from the little friends that I now have.

GOULDIAN FINCHES.
Sir, --I have been greatly interested in the several notes on the
treatment of newly-imported Gouldian Finches. I have had a number
sent to me (at different times) from a friend in N.E. Queensland, mostly in
full plumage : these have arrived apparently in the best of health, but
often died in a very short time after I received them.
The last lot sent me were young birds (uncoloured Painted Finches as
my friend called them) and were brought home by a man who thoroughly
understands the treatment of birds. He took on board a bag of sand,
which he supplied them with fresh each day ; this lasted till he reached the
Red Sea ; the next stopping-place was at Suez, where he supplied himself
with another lot, which lasted till he reached home; but from a cage of
sixty-three I did not lose a single bird.
I think the best way is to get young birds, and a great deal depends
on the treatment on the voyage home. These were fed on Canary seed
only, and sweet biscuit finely powdered thrown into the cage, which they
seemed to eat very readily. I fed them in the same way, and kept them
till most of them were nearly in full colour, without the loss of a single
bird. James B. Housden.
PARRAKEET HYBRIDS.
Sir,--A friend of mine, living at Trowbridge, last year had a cock
Rosella which paired with a hen Cockatiel. The Cockatiel laid and hatched
four young ; but one day, noticing that the parent birds did not enter the
box, my friend looked in and found the four young ones dead : they were
then about fourteen days old.
Has anyone ever succeeded in rearing young from this cross ? I
wonder whether they would be crested ? I have reared jmung from cock
Meal}- and hen Red Rosella, and my Pennants and Rosellas have paired,
and laid eggs which, after being incubated, proved unfertile.

GREAT BUSTARDS.
By W. H. St. Quintin.
Very possibly some of the readers of the Avicultural
Magazine may at some time entertain the idea of keeping these
splendid birds, and in that case my experience, (extending over
the past eleven years, during which I have never been without
several specimens) may be of use. I have kept Great Bustards
which have come from Spain, East Germany, and Hungary. At
present, I have only one pair. The male, a fine seven or eight years
old bird, came from Germany, while his female companion is
Spanish. An old female, one of the first pair which I ever had,
has died recently from the effedts of an accident, after being in
my possession just eleven years. Although the males have
always shown off in the spring, I have never seen here any signs
of breeding, except that the female just mentioned did, three or
four summers ago, drop an egg without scratching a nest.
Though my birds have the run of an enclosure of a quarter of
an acre, part in grass, partly gravelled, and often with a plot of
rye or barley, sown in the middle of it, I have not yet induced
them to go to nest. Many of your readers will have seen that in
Regent's Park they have been more successful; for one of the
females in the Bustard enclosure, a bird which, by the bye, once
belonged to me, has for several seasons laid eggs, and has sat
upon them ; though, probably from being too much disturbed
by visitors, and by the Cranes in the neighbouring paddocks,
hitherto without result.
The assumption in the male of the nuptial plumage, by
which I mean the long moustachios and the chestnut pectoral
bands, is a gradual process extending over several months, and
is interesting to watch. The whiskers or moustachios are shed
early in July, when the annual moult commences; and the}&apos; - do
not appear again until just before Christmas. From that time.

until about the end of February, the} 7 are slowly increasing in
length. The pectoral bands do not appear with the young feathers
after the autumn moult, but are put on in the spring.
The extraordinary "play" of the male, as the breeding
season approaches, commences with a slight inflation of the
throat, and a partial reversal of the tail-feathers over the back.
But it is not until he is in the height of the breeding " orge "
(op^rj) that he assumes the, to us, supremely ridiculous attitude
which has been so well reproduced by Wolf and other artists.
At this season tame Bustards become most impudent. At
one time I had two fine old males, who used to rush at an intruder;
and I have often, to protect my legs from the furious digs of their
beaks, walked across the enclosure holding one in each hand by
the neck ; the birds angrily protesting with their gruff barking
grunts, but not exhibiting the least fear, and ready to resume
the attack the instant they were released.
In order to take a portrait of a male in the height of his
play, I had to take the photograph through a wire netting, so
as to keep the bird at the required distance.
But, tame though the birds may be with those whom they
know, they are very easily thrown into a paroxysm of terror by
a strange dog, or even by the too abrupt approach of a visitor
with whom they are not familiar.
When alarmed like this, Bustards will dash themselves
against the fence of their enclosure ; and, as their bones are
extremely frail and brittle, in proportion to the weight of the
bird, they may suffer serious damage. It is better to pinion the
birds; tying up the arteries previously, by passing a double
thread between the two bones of the wing, and bringing the two
ends of each thread together with a firm knot.
I was formerly afraid to perform this operation ; but as the
flight feathers are a long while coming down, the unpinioned
birds require catching several times during the moult, which is
very undesirable.
The food, which my birds get, is chiefly barley-meal, made
into a crumbly ball with Spratt's game - meal and crissel,
cabbage-heads, bread and potatoes. Some of my birds have
eaten chopped rabbit readily, also mice. Those which I have
now will seldom touch any of these. But they should, especially
in winter, have as much animal food as they will take. The main
requisites for keeping Bustards healthy, are :--ist, a good space
to roam in, where they can find a good deal of natural insect
food and clean grass; 2nd, shelter from strong winds in the

*shape of bushes or hurdles packed with straw ; 3rd, if possible,
a light, dry soil, with facilities for dusting. The enclosure must
be effectually fenced against the intrusion of dogs, and of course
of foxes. Though the plumage of the Bustards is soft, and they
suffer much discomfort from continued wet, they seldom, of
their own accord, seek shelter from any kind of roof overhead ;
but good thick evergreen bushes, dotted about, will afford a good
deal of protection from bad weather, and they readily avail
themselves of it.

I have always " gone in " for British birds rather than
foreigners, (though I have not been very successful in breeding
them) and an article on a foreign species is a little out of my
line. Still, I succeeded one year in rearing a good number of
young Ribbon Finches, and it may interest the readers of the
Avicultural Magazine to hear the story.
But no. I won't tell the story just as it happened, for I
did many stupid things with my Ribbon Finches, and I don't
want to expose myself to the friendly contempt of those
members of our Society who are more learned about the habits
.and customs of foreign finches than I ,am. I will tell my
readers, instead, how they ought to proceed, setting down,
however, naught which I have not proved the truth of by
personal experience.
And one word more in preface. What I am going to say
refers only to breeding Ribbon Finches in-doors; for I have
never tried them in an out-door aviary.
I do not intend to write an eulogy of the Ribbon Finch,
for my deliberate opinion is that it is a hateful little bird, but it
has one great advantage over the Parson Finch, the Silverbill,
the Bronze Mannikin, and some other easily-bred species, in
that the sexes are readily distinguished both in mature and
immature birds. The Cut-throat mark of the male Ribbon
Finch is unmistakable. You will therefore have no difficulty in
selecting a pair. And if you have made up your mind to try to

breed this species I should advise }a)U to purchase at least two
pairs.
The great point is to obtain really strong, healthy liens r
for it is absolute waste of time to attempt to breed with a hen
which is in the least "puffy," or " sleepy," or out of condition.
If possible, buy aviary-bred birds, firstly, because they are more
hardy and, therefore, less likely to cause disappointment, and,
secondly, because it is right to encourage the sale of aviary-bred
birds. If the birds are aviary-bred it will be well to keep the
sexes apart for two or three months to make sure that they are
suificently matured before allowing them to nest. If they are
newly-imported birds, this separation will be equally necessarj r
in order to give the birds time to recover from the effects of the
change of climate and the hardships they have undergone. Of
course, if you can get aviary-bred birds which you know to be
several months old, or imported birds which have been over
some time, you may begin operations at once, if the time ot
the year be suitable.
And this brings me to another point. Ribbon Finches
and their relations will nest at any time of the year, but if they
have a preference, it is for the time when our English winter is
either near at hand or in full blast. If you let them follow their
own sweet will, and set up housekeeping with the temperature
below 6o p , you may possibly rear some j'oung birds ; but the
chances are ten to one that the hen will be egg-bound, and then
} r ou will get nothing but disappointment for yourself, and misery
and death for your birds. You can, of course, keep up an artificial
temperature of over 6o* even in the severest frost, but it is
difficult to do it and at the same time supply plent\ r of fresh air T
without which you are not likely to have much success. If you
take my advice, you won't attempt breeding until the spring,
(say the end of April or the beginning of May) and even then
you ought to have means of producing artificial heat in case
there should be a spell of cold weather.
I never had any success with breeding Ribbon Finches (or
indeed any birds besides Canaries) in cages. No doubt it is pos-
sible to breed them in cages, but I think it is much more difficult
than in aviaries, unless the cages be very large. Wire netting is
now r so cheap that a small bird-room aviary can be made at much
less expense than the cost of a large cage ; I therefore strongly
advise everyone to try aviary-breeding in preference. The
aviary need not be large, but it should go right up to the ceiling
of the room, and the nest boxes should be fixed high up on the
wall, near the ceiling. Almost any kind of nest box will do.

*either cocoa-nut husks, or Hartz-cages, or the well-known cigar-
box pattern. I think the birds prefer the husks, but I prefer the
*cigar-boxes, as they are cleaner and it is easier to remove dead
nestlings from them.
There must not be more than one pair of Ribbon Finches
in the same aviary, and it is better that there should be no other
occupants. But Ribbon Finches, as a rule, are tolerably peace-
able, and at the same time very capable of defending their nests;
therefore, other birds may often be placed in the aviary without
disaster ensuing.
Fine hay is sufficient for the nest, and the best plan is to
throw some handfuls into a corner of the aviary, for the exercise
of carrying it up to the nest-box is good for the birds.
As to food :--Of course there must be a constant supply of
white millet and canary seed, and in addition either " spray
millet " or the so-called " Indian " millet should be given. Fgg-
food in some form is also required for feeding the young, and I
found that hard-boiled egg and biscuit, prepared as if for
Canaries, was preferred to the preserved egg, but the preserved
egg would doubtless do as well and is much more convenient.
Soaked ants' eggs may also be given, but are certainly not
essential; I cannot say whether the birds succeed better without
them, for according to my experience they did neither good nor
harm.
Green meat should be given daily while there are young
in the nest. Chickweed (not too rank and luxuriant), water
cress, and lettuce, are all good. Groundsel is useless. Water
cress is very wholesome and much liked by the birds, but is said
to be sometimes the means of introducing bird-fever.
Crushed egg-shell should be supplied, especially when the
hens are laying. But if the hens be healthy and the weather
warm there is not much risk of egg-binding.
And now, having waited till the proper season, placed
your birds in a suitable aviary, and supplied them with everything
they require in the way of food and nesting materials, you
naturally expect to rear brood after brood without mishap. Well,
you may do so, and on the other hand you may not. Ribbon
Finches are most perverse creatures, and will often persist in
*doing what they are expected and wished net to do.
You must not attempt to examine the nests, or interfere with
them in any way, and if you can restrain yourself from undue
curiosity the eggs will generally be hatched, but unfortunately it
does not follow that all the young, or indeed, any of them, will

<bodyText confidence="0.999670206896552" page_id="32635105"  page_num="66" year="" vol="">
be reared. I do not know the cause, but in my experience one
or more of the young in every nest are almost sure to die. If
this occur soon after hatching the little body is thrown out of the
nest and will be found on the floor of the aviary, but if it take
place when the nestling is over a week old the corpse remains in
the nest and soon causes a truly awful smell. When this is
discovered (the smell I mean) you must examine the nest and
remove the dead bird. Sometimes the whole brood will die. So
far as my experience goes, Ribbon Finches do not throw out
their young alive, but if other aviculturists have actually known
it to happen I am of course prepared to believe it; however, at
present I am disposed to think it is a myth. The presence of
young in the nest can always be known by the noise they make
while being fed. As they grow older this noise becomes very
loud. They leave the nest when nearly three weeks old, and are
then perfectly fledged; the red collar of the male is then clearly
visible, though not nearly so bright as it afterwards becomes.
The old birds show much affection for their young and much
resent being separated from them. It is not wise to remove
the young so long as the parents continue to feed them, and yet
their presence often leads to the failure of the next brood. For
this reason Ribbon Finches and similar species frequently only
rear every other brood.
Having reared your young Ribbon Finches, you will pro-
bably find that there is no sale for them, and that you are rather
tired of these common, noisy and (under certain circumstances
mentioned above) nasty smelling birds. You will, however, have
gained some experience which may be of help to you in breed-
ing rarer and more attractive species.

Our Hon. Secretary has asked me to write an article oil
the Green Singing Finch for this series, as I appear to be the
only member who has succeeded in getting this bird to bring its
young to maturity.
The Green Singing Finch is too well known for a descrip-
tion of its appearance to be needed. The only bird with which
it could very well be confused is the St. Helena Seed-eater
(Setinus flaviventris&apos;), but although the two species are singularly

alike in plumage, they can be readily distinguished by the
difference in size, the St. Helena Seed-eater being much the
larger bird--as large, in fact, as a good-sized Canary. Un-
fortunately, there are no means of telling the sex of the Green
Singing Finch readily and with certainty. Dr. Butler says " the
hen is paler in colouring than the cock, is somewhat browner
above, and has a white spot on the chin ."--Foreign Finches in
Captivity , page 36. But this white spot (if it always exists in
the female) is very difficult to detect, and the other differences
in colour are differences in degree only, and depend almost as
much upon age as upon sex; thus an old female may be much
brighter than a young male. In choosing a pair, a good plan
is to select one very bright bird and one much duller in colour.
But, of course, the test of song is the most certain.
Minute differences in plumage may be noticed in specimens
of this species, and some have supposed that there are more than
one species imported--it is probable, however, that these are, at
most, nothing more than local varieties of the same species.
I have referred to the note book which I kept at the time
when I bred the Green Singing Finch, and will give an account
of my treatment of these sweet songsters. They are, however,
by no means " sweet " to other birds, being most quarrelsome
little fellows, although some people differ from me about their
pugnacity.
When first the birds came into my possession, they were
turned into a waggon-cage a yard long and half-a-yard wide,
which contained about two dozen Waxbills of all sorts. As they
were so quarrelsome, not only in chasing each other about, but
taking hold of the other wee inmates and making them cry out, I
resolved to put them into a small breeding cage, never thinking
for a moment that they would breed--for it seemed to me that I
had been " had," and that, instead of a genuine pair, they were
two cocks. However, to give them a chance, I removed the
nesting boxes and division at the end of the cage, and, in their
place, put a cocoanut shell which had part of a cowhair nest-bag
pressed tightly into the bottom and sides. This the birds
altered but very little, and a tiny piece of chickweed and half-a-
dozen blades of grass, which they carried up, w 7 ere all the
additions that they made to it. I have found that it is a mistake
to allow birds to have access to a lot of building material, for
when I first began my apprenticeship to the breeding of foreign
birds, with Zebra Finches, they would, after sitting a few days,
carry up chickweed, grass in flower, and even a?its ' eggs, and
entirely cover their eggs.

The cage was further altered by cutting extra holes for
seed-tins. The diet was canary seed, Indian millet, Italian
millet, maw seed, and, as a stimulant, preserved yolk of egg
mixed with one-third Jamaica sugar, this prevents egg binding.
Sponge cake, crumbled, was also given every morning.
The only available room that faced S.W. was the children's
day-nursery; the cage was hung against the window-shutters. To
give as much light as possible to the little prisoners, the wooden
end of the cage nearest the window was cut out, and a pane of
glass inserted. The blind was never drawn down, so that they
had the benefit of the whole of the daylight. A bath was kept
hanging at the open door. Five eggs were laid, and the offspring
successfully reared. Whether the first hatched was a precocious
youngster I know not, anyway, it began to sing before it was
seven weeks old.
The Green Singing Finch has been crossed with the
Canary both in Germany and in England.

Acanthis rufescens, Vieill.
By G. C. Swail.es.
This charming little bird, the smallest of our native
Finches, is decidedly rare as a breeding species in the southern
part of our Island, though it has been reported once as breeding
so far south as the Isle of Wight, and has probably nested in
most of the southern counties: but it breeds commonly in all the
counties of England north of Norfolk and Leicester and in most
of the Scottish counties. Seebolim says there is but one record
of its breeding out of Britain ; but according to Howard
Saunders nests have since been found by other naturalists in
Switzerland, and he says " it appears probable that this species
inhabits the greater part of the mountain ranges of Central
Europe."
It is strange, indeed, that a bird so common here should
have been observed on only two or three occasions on that
wonderful island Heligoland; on one of these instances,
however, the birds remained and bred in Mr. Gatke's garden.
A detailed description of the colour of this well-known
bird is unnecessary, being chiefly brown, with, in the adult male,
a crimson crown, breast, and rump: the female having the
crimson crown alone. The jantng acquire the colouring on the
head at the first moult (the breast at this time is slightly^
marked with red) and the full-coloured breast at the second

moult; I have seen young males breeding without a tinge of
crimson on the breast. Unfortunately, if kept caged, the bright
colours are lost at the first moult and replaced by feathers of
a bronzy yellow, but in a good-sized aviary, if given plenty of
green food, insects, etc., they will keep almost as good a colour
as those at liberty.
As an aviary bird it is one of the easiest to reconcile
to captivity, and few are more interesting. It lacks much gift
as a songster, but the twitter of both sexes and the few notes
of the male during the breeding season, though not loud, are
very agreeable.
It is one of the readiest species to breed in confinement,
and in an aviary will generally rear young if supplied with
groundsel-tops, flowering grass, etc. : a branch infested with
Aphides is a great treat at this time, every insedt being picked
off and again disgorged to feed the young. A pair in my aviary
reared three broods during the summer of 1895.
The seed of the alder and birch is much sought after as
food, but in captivity they will thrive well on canary and rape
seed : if allowed too much hemp they get too fat and unhealthy.
A little hemp maj^ be given as a change, and it is better to
have it slightly crushed, as Redpolls can only remove the husk
with difficulty, and I have known the cutting-edge of their beaks
considerably damaged with feeding on this seed.
Here, in Hast Yorkshire, this bird is popularly known in
the country as " French Linnet " and also as " Chewy Linnet,"--
the word Chewy, I suppose, somewhat resembling the note
usually given when flying.
In captivity, hybrids have been bred between this bird and
the Greenfinch, Goldfinch, Siskin, Linnet, Bullfinch, and Canary.
Varieties in abnormal plumage are not very rare, and in
all the individuals which have come under my notice, whether
white or cinnamon coloured, the crimson cap has been retained,
though fading, if kept caged, at the first moult, to yellow. A
beautiful bird I possessed, and which was awarded a prize at the
Crystal Palace Show in, I think, 1894, had the head and shoulders
white, but had a brilliant cap and breast; I paired this with a
nearly half-white pied hen, which had two nests of infertile eggs.
At the death of the first-named bird, on dissedtion it proved to
be a female ; it was, I imagine, an old bird, and the fact of its
having a red breast was probably analogous to the not uncommon
assumption of the plumage and spurs of the cock Pheasant by
old, and probably diseased, hens.

REVIEW.
"British Birds-, their Nests and Eggs." Volume I. -- Passeres, by
Dr. A. G. Butler. (.Brumby &amp; Clarke , Limited , 5,
Farringdon Avenue , London , E.C., and Hull.&apos;) *
Of late the British public has been deluged with books
dealing with the avifauna of these Islands, but none have been
so neatly and well got up as " British Birds, their Nests and
Eggs," which Messrs. Brumby and Clarke, of Hull, are now
bringing out in parts.
There is a full-sized plate of every undoubted British
species, by Mr. Frohawk, and each month a coloured plate of
eggs, by the same artist, while the letterpress of the Passeres is
in the hands of Dr. Butler, who needs no recommendation to
readers of this Magazine. The book is written, throughout, in
Dr. Butler's pleasing and easy style, and deals fully with all
phases in the life of each bird.
Quotations have been freely borrowed from many well
known authors, especially in matters relating to geographical
distribution and descriptions of plumage. In disputed points,
Dr. Butler has carefully abstained from innovations and from
forcing his beliefs on his readers, but gives in clear and concise
language both sides of the argument and leaves the readers to
form their own opinion. In regard to aviculture. Dr. Butler has
practically only his own experience to give us; but whose
experience, save, perhaps, that of the late Eord Eilford, could
well be better ?
Although the book is, professedly, a popular one, it
contains much of great value to the scientist ; no book since
Seebohm's " British Birds" has dealt so fully with the habits of
our feathered fauna, whilst aviculture is dealt with in a manner
which no one else has before attempted.
We could find no bad inaccuracies or omissions, and the
book shows further evidence of having been compiled and
written with great care. One point, only, calls for redress, and
that is a certain want of arrangement: the facts are all there,
but it would have been better had they been re-arranged before
finally going to press.
Dr. Butler's remarks on the trapping and slaughtering of
the Blackbird, on account of its propensity for fruit, are well
* Now issuing from the press, in weekly parts price 6d., and monthly
parts price 2 /-.

meant, although it is open to doubt whether its numbers in
England would be increased if such practices were put an end to.
As regards doubtful species, the author has done most
wisely in just mentioning their occurence, with data, and
leaving it to the reader's discretion to consider them British or
not.
We cannot agree with the remark that the Wheatear is
scarcer in the southern portion of these Islands, having found it
distributed in suitable localities quite as abundantly in the south
as in the north. Speaking of the plumage of this species, Dr.
Butler states that the change from summer to winter is produced
by the wearing off of the pale buff edgings as well as by growth
of colour in the feather itself. With all deference to the author,
we are personally of opinion that there is no such thing as
growth of colour in the feather; the change in this and most of
such cases being due to a wearing down of the feather itself, but
not merely an abrasion of its edges.
In the article on the Stonechat, he remarks: "When
roosting or hopping, its tail is incessantly in motion." We
suppose he only refers to its " day roosting," more commonly
called perching, as we should imagine that to keep its tail going
night and day would be rather trying to any bird.
When wuiting of the Redstart, Dr. Butler says that he
does not believe in the migratory instinct, and " that the true
explanation of the so-called migratory instinct is merely another
name for short commons." With this we cannot agree; for if
that be the case, how does he account for the migration of many
young birds long before the summer is over, notably in the case
of Richard's Pipit, in which species, according to Herr Gatke,
the young migrate before they have lost their down and a
considerable time before their parents, who stay to moult ? Or,
again, does food become scarce in Africa about April, causing
birds of all kinds to flock North about the same time ? Mr.
Stirling's nests of the Black Redstart cannot be taken seriously,
for that species has never been known to breed in hedges, but
generally in walls or clefts of rocks. It is possible for the bird
to have erred in one case (for we know an instance of the
Common Redstart breeding on the ground) ; but reports of the
nest of a rare bird being found by the same person in very
abnormal situations, in two if not three instances, cannot be
believed. Stuff such as this ought to be consigned to the waste-
paper basket and not repeated, more especially as Dr. Butler
himself does not credit the statement.

The description of the habits of the Blue-throat, although
in the main exact, does not really convey a correct idea of its
ways. Of course we have not had such an early opportunity
of watching it as the late Mr. Seebohm, nor have we seen it on
migration as Herr Gatke has ; but in the middle of summer had
we not seen a shadow* that kept disappearing in the willow scrub,
or frequently recognised a note not unlike the " chack-chack " of
the Robin, we should never have been aware of the presence of
this beautiful warbler. This bird is always to be found near a
marsh--vdiat spot on the fjelds of Norway does not answer to
that description ? It is always heard on dry spots among short
scrub, though hardly ever among trees.
In criticism of the most interesting article on the Night-
ingale, we have but little to say. No mention is made of the
" churr churr" which is the welcome sign of the successful
hatching of a brood. The fact of its nesting at some distance
from the ground is more common than is generally supposed.
A nest was taken in 1894, built in a bush growing against a
paling, fully 8 feet from the ground. We don't approve of hand-
rearing members of this family ; they are much nicer as pets
if caught in spring, before the arrival of the females, and when so
caught will generally sing at once and continue throughout
the summer. Should anyone attempt hand-rearing, one of the
best foods is fresh wasp grubs, if they can be procured at the
right time ; we wonder Dr. Butler has made no mention of them.
We heartily re-echo Dr. Butler's sentiments when he states,
with reference to the Barred Warbler, " It seems a thousand
pities that these rare birds should not be captured alive [or left
alone] and their habits in captivity studied in detail. All that
can be learnt from the stuffed skin of a Barred Warbler has
either long been known or can be equally well studied from
skins already in our cabinets ; but really to know something of
the nature and peculiarities of a bird, it must be studied, not
only flying freely in its native home, but in a good sized aviary."
It is precisely these notes on their habits in captivity, written,
as they are, by one who knows those habits so well, that renders
this portion of the book unique and well worthy of a place in
every naturalist's library, be he a scientist or a fancier. Dr.
Butler shows clearly that the science of aviculture (for it is
indeed a science) is just as important to the study of ornithology
as other branches of the subject, and a book such as the present
tends to do much good in bringing the subjects into closer
relation with each other.

Again we would draw the reader's attention to the very
sound and sensible remarks on the destruction of birds by man.
The whole passage on page 85 is too long to quote, but the last
two lines contain the gist of the matter.--" No Adt for the
protection of wild birds which does not prevent the wholesale
grubbing of woods and so-called ' waste land,' will ever prevent
the diminution of bird-life in our Islands." Of course it is
obvious that a certain amount of drainage of fen land must be
done, but there are many parts of England where the wholesale
lopping of hedges, or their substitution by a wire fence, might
with advantage be stopped. At the same time, we do not mean
to imply that no harm is done with net or gun ; as several
*species, notably the Hoopoe, would probably nest in England if
unmolested on their spring migration.
No mention is made of a good distinction between the
nests of the Chiffchaff and the Willow Wren : namely, the fact
that the nests of the former species are always placed on or
above the ground, but never in it, as is the case with the Willow
Wren. In the geographical distribution of this last, no mention
is made of its very northern range, nor of its Eastern repre-
sentative ; and in dealing with this very confusing genus, a key
to the species might well have been added, especially as some of
its members are continually being found on our shores, this
season alone having added two, viz .,P. virida?ms and P.proregulus.
To describe the Reed Warbler's song as poor is, perhaps,
hardly correct. It bears a family likeness to that of the Sedge
Warbler; but the bird always seems to be in such a hurry to get
it out that the notes become mixed and jumbled up together;
nevertheless, in its natural haunt, it sounds distinctly pleasing,
though somewhat harsher than that of the Sedge. Although it
may require a keen observer to tell the nest of the Sedge
Warbler, when suspended, from that of the Reed Warbler, that
of the former bird may always be distinguished by its being
much shallower.
With regard to Dr. Butler's remarks on the Hedge
Sparrow, we cannot agree in any particular except as to their
pugnaciousness to their own species. They alwaj^s sing in a
most charming manner, and on being turned into a large aviary
always seem to settle down without, apparently, noticing their
altered circumstances. In one case, an attachment was formed
with a St. Helena Waxbill, the two birds were always about
together, and at roosting time the Waxbill would lie as close as
possible to his feathered friend.

As regards the systematic position of the Bearded
Reedling, the author takes the wisest course in leaving it where
it has been ; at the same time, his arguments on the subject are
very sound and clearly put. The name, " Reedling," which he
gives it, is most suitable and by far preferable to the misleading
one of Tit; but surely, to be consistent, the Hedge Sparrow
should be called an Accentor.
In the article on the Wren, Dr. Butler supports what we
have always found to be a popular delusion, namely, the easy
way in which it deserts its nest. We have known of a nest,
which had had a clutch removed, used again, even though
the eggs of the second clutch were removed every day as they
were laid. Nevertheless, six eggs were laid, and on some of
them being replaced, were successfully hatched and reared.
The so-called "cocks' nests" are probably resting-places for
the young brood when on the wing.
Dr. Butler slanders the Pipits when he writes of them as
pugnacious. The Tree Pipit is certainly most peaceable as long
as it is not driven from its accustomed corner. Its song in
captivity is also most delightful. We fancy Dr. Butler gets his
ideas of a bird's pugnaciousness from its behaviour in a sort of
" happy family" aviary. Any Englishman would feel insulted
if imprisoned with a Red Indian or a Kaffir, and it is not to be
wondered at that an English bird should objedt to a tropical
cousin, such as a Rosa's Parrakeet.
Lastly, it remains for us to notice the illustrations by Mr.
Frohawk. The coloured plates of the eggs are good : the eggs
being, in most cases, easily recognisable. They have one merit,
that of being drawn diredt from actual specimens ; although too
great prominence seems to have been given to differences in
shape, while some well-known varieties of common eggs have
been omitted, notably, the greenish variety of the Tree Pipit
and the pure blue one of the Spotted Flycatcher. The plates are,
however, executed in Mr. Frohawk's best style and show the
artist to be a keen observer of nature, which, in pidtures of this
kind, is half the battle. The illustrations are finished off with
great care, as is shown by the little sketches in the background :
two to which # we would especially call attention, being a Thrush
on her nest, and the two Bearded Reedlings on a reed. Mr.
Frohawk is such a good observer that he cannot draw what he
does not see, consequently his attempts at flying birds do not
come up to the others, that of the Bearded Reedling and Blue
Tit being rather stiff.

All the plates being of such high merit, it would be
difficult to give the palm to any particular one, those of the
Fieldfare and Tree Creeper being, perhaps, among the best; but
to any lover of birds and their ways, be he scientist, aviculturist,
or oologist, we can only advise him to get the book and see for
himself, and we will guarantee that the money will be well spent.

There has lately been a revival of the controversy as to the harmful-
ness of the Sparrow 7 , and we are much afraid that the balance of evidence
is against our impudent little friend. Most farmers and gardeners are of
opinion that he does more harm than good, and although aviculturists have
a soft place in their hearts for him, they will probably agree that there are
too many Sparrows. After all, a country can only support a certain limited
number of birds, and the prolific, pertinaceous, predatory Sparrow takes
the place which would otherwise be filled by more useful and interesting
species.
In the report of the L. and P. O. Society's Show in our December
number the fact of a Half-moon Parrakeet being catalogued as a Golden-
crowned Parrakeet is commented upon, and it is remarked that Golden-
crowned " Conure ''would have been a less misleading title. Injustice to Mr.
Arthur Jones, the exhibitor of the bird in question, it ought to be known
that the misnaming of the bird was not his fault, as he did all in his power
to insure accuracy. Mr. Jones sent a description of the bird to a gentleman
well known as an authority on Parrots, and was told by him that the bird
was a Golden-crowmed Parrakeet. It seems that the gentleman alluded to
was misled by a singular error in a book to which he referred--the plates
of the Golden-crowned Parrakeet and Golden-crowned Conure being
transposed in his cop} 7 .
Many aviculturists find Alario Finches dreadfully delicate-after a
few months they go into a decline from which they never recover, growing
gradually weaker till they die. We strongly advise all who may possess
these delightful little birds to most carefully avoid giving them any millet
seed. If they have access to millet they will often become very fond of
it and neglect other seeds. Feed on canary-seed and good German rape,
with a few hemp-seeds daily. For this reason it is never wise to endeavour
to keep Alario Finches in the same aviary as Waxbills and similar birds,
but, on the other hand, they will do well with Canaries. Fed as advised
above, Alario Finches will be found fairly hardy.
Before our next number appears the Crystal Palace Bird Show will
have come and gone. It is the great event of the year to many, perhaps
most, aviculturists, whether they be exhibitors or not. By a large number it
is looked forward to eagerly, and looked back upon with pleasure--for at
the old Palace of glass, in the chilly month of February, they not only
delight their eyes with the sight of rare and beautiful birds, but also renew
their acquaintance with many friends of like tastes.

This year the prizes in the Foreign classes at the Palace are raised to
the same level as those in the Canary 7 classes. It is a mere adt of justice,
and ought to have been done years ago--for the entry fee has always been
the same in each case. Besides, everyone knows that the British and
Foreign Birds are the chief attraction to visitors. We really do not think
that an} 7 particular credit attaches to the Management for this tardy adt of
fairness.
The classification has been greatly improved of late years, but we are
a little dissappointed that no further advance has been made in the Schedule
for 1897. The grouping of Cuba Finches with Gouldian Finches Parrot
Finches and Pintailed Nonpareils has always struck us as somewhat strange.
The class for Grassfinches, Mannikins and Waxbills sadly wants dividing--
of course any division between these groups would have to be a little
arbitrary, though the Mannikins, at any rate, are fairly well defined. But it
is the Parrot classes which are now most open to criticism. The Love-birds
are still, apparently, considered to be neither short-tailed nor long-tailed.
Lories and Lorikeets can only be shown singly, but Parrakeets can be
shown in pairs. Greys, Amazons, Eclecti, and Cockatoos must be single,
while other short-tailed Parrots may be in pairs. And in spite of the cor-
respondence in our columns last spring, the quaint wording which, apparently,
excludes Macaws, and classes the Slender-billed Cockatoo with the Parrots,
is still retained. It would not have been much trouble to remove these
anomalies, and it would seem as if some of them are retained out of sheer
perverseness.
We have no wish to say any more, at present, about the absence from
the Schedule of any definition of that very elastic term "British Bird."
But w r e should like to know the precise meaning intended to be conveyed
by the expression " Birds of Passage and Migratory Birds." Are " Birds of
Passage" the same as "Migratory Birds," or are they not? Fhom the use of
the word "and " it would seem that they are not. Then, are "Birds of
Passage and Migratory Birds" included among the British Birds? They
would certainly seem not to be so included, but to be placed by themselves
in the Schedule as if they were neither British nor Foreign ! Truly the
Schedule of the Crystal Palace Show is an ornithological conundrum.
Can anyone explain why it is that while birds in cages almost always
become infested with insedts, in spite of all precautions; yet in aviaries,
even quite small aviaries, they are almost entirely free from them ? We
have for several years had a few cages in our bird-room, and, notwithstand-
ing constant cleansing and shifting of the birds from cage to cage, there
are always some insects about the ends of the perches after the birds have
been in them for a time. On the other hand, we can never find any 7
traces of these pests in the aviaries in the same room, except behind the
nest-boxes in the summer. We have a theory of our own which offers a
possible explanation, but we are afraid to make it public until it has been
confirmed by further observation.

OPERATIONS ON BIRDS.

Sir, --The account in the November Magazine of an operation per-
formed on a Grey Parrot is very interesting. Only about a week before
the November number came into my hands, I performed a similar operation
on a Pekin Robin belonging to Lady Margaret Spicer, of Spye Park. Her
ladyship brought the bird to me and asked me to look at it. I told her
there was a large tumour under the eyelid, and that if she would wait about
five or ten minutes, I would take it out. But she said her doctor had looked
at and lanced it, and said nothing would come from it. I assured her, if
she would take the risk, I had confidence that I could successfully remove
it. Her ladyship left the bird with me to do with it as I liked, and called
about fifteen minutes afterwards, to see the bird in its cage with its face a
natural shape, only the eye (which before was completely closed) being a
little weak, and slightly damp from the bathing.
I think many species are very subjedt to these tumours: Virginian
Nightingales and Gre3 r Cardinals frequently get them just over the upper
eyelid, probably by dashing the head against the top of the cage when first
caught, as all these birds, at the slightest fright, make a dasli upwards; but
Pekin Robins alwaj-s throw themselves blindly against the wires of then-
cage, so the tumour in their case is either just over the bill or between the
bill and eye.
If not taking up too much space, I will relate how I first discovered
how simple a matter it was to remove one of the tumours. A farm labourer-
brought me a pure white Thrush (an Albino with pink eyes) which had
died, thinking I should like it to stuff. (It was a strange thing that he had
had this bird six months and I had never heard of it). He said he caught
it as a young nestling, but since he had had it a " big lump " had grown on
the top of its head and killed it. I accepted the bird, and, when skinning
over its head, I found the skin quite free from anj- connection with the
tumour, and the latter quite free from an}&apos; adhesion to the skull-bone,
coming off the skull about the size of half a pea and of a hard cheesy sub-
stance. When the bird was stuffed no one would have noticed that there
had been anything the matter with it : but before, its eyelid appeared to be
drawn up almost to the crown of its head. Now, it so happened that, at the
same time, I had a Grey Cardinal, a very fine bird, with exactly the same
complaint, and which I daily expected to die. So I determined, kill or
cure, to try the operation. After much persuasion, and a suggestion that
she was faint-hearted, I succeeded in getting my wife to securely hold it,
while, with the small blade of my penknife, very sharp, I carefully cut just
through the skin, right across the centre of the tumour, and, with the
point of the knife, parted the skin and uncovered the whole of the tumour,
which then easily came away. (But this one appeared as though in two
halves, like two chestnuts in a husk). After a minute's bathing with a bit
of soft sponge and warm water, I replaced the skin as neatly as possible
omitting the sewing-up process, which I have never attempted, and then
turned the bird into a large outdoor aviary, where it was not likely to strike
its head ; two days later it was singing and appeared none the worse, wdiile
three weeks later it was V.H.C. at the Crystal Palace Show--so the

operation did not leave much mark. Since then I have never hesitated to
cutout these tumours. I simply cut through the thin skin right over the
centre, gently work off the skiu each way with the point of the knife, take
out the cheesy substance, carefully bathe the spot with warm water and a
very clean soft sponge, and close up the skiu. I cannot advise the sewing-
up process unless in skilled hands.

A MANNIKIN HYBRID.
Sir, --I have to record the breeding of a cross between the Bronze
Mannikin and Rufous-backed Finch (Spennestes nigriceps). There are two
of each of these birds in one of my indoor aviaries, and, apparently, neither
of them are pairs, as each has taken a mate from the other species ; but I
am not sure which are males and which are females. I only became aware
that one pair had bred when the young bird left the nest.
The nest is in a furze-branch, and was originally built by a pair of
Avadavats, with hay and aloe-fibre ; it is tubular in shape, with an opening
at one end. The Mannikins have not altered it in any way.
The 3&apos;oung bird left the nest on the 2nd of January, and began to feed
itself about a week later. I found four dead unfledged young on the floor
of the aviary about the middle of December, which probably were from the
same hatch ; they had been overfed and were badly crop-bound, the crops
being full of whole white millet.
The colouring of the young bird is: back blackish-brown, head
darker, tail black; underneath whitish, throat and breast greyish, beak
blackish, legs dark grey, ej^es black, iris white; no markings on sides.
I am inclined to think that the Rufous-backed Finch is the hen, as
this bird most often feeds the young one. The other pair are now building,
and both birds seem to work equally.
I noticed to-day, in one of my open-air aviaries, a Zebra Finch nest
and one egg already laid ; this seems very early.
With reference to the second paragraph of " Avicultural Small-talk,"
in last month&apos;s number, there is one feature of the Magazine that I have
been sorry to see discontinued: I allude to the descriptions of members'
aviaries and bird-rooms, which were of the greatest interest. Probably
every aviculturist, owing partly to the force of circumstances, keeps his
birds under more or less different conditions, and the publication of these
varying conditions, with some indication of the accompanying difficulties
encountered, would add greatly to our knowledge of how to keep our
birds most successfully.
Temperature is an important question, and the amount of inseft and
other stimulating food given, as compared with the space available for
exercise, in the case of hard-billed birds ; what species are found to agree
together ; and many other points would sooner become matters of certainty
if we could get a greater number of records of avicultural experiences.
As regards antipathies : I have found the Magpie Mannikins gener-
ally very peaceable ; but they at once attacked a pair of Striated Finches
placed in the same aviary with them ; perhaps the similarity of colouring
had something to do with it.

CRIMSON-WING PARRAKEETS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986146255319149" page_id="32635118"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
SIR,--In the early part of 1895, my hen Crimson-wing laid two eggs;
but I found the old birds did not sit well, the result being that both eggs
turned out addled.
Profittiug by my experience, and in order to be prepared, should
they have eggs next year, I purchased several Doves; and it so happened
that a Dove laid an egg the same day as the Crimson-wing in January, 1896.
I changed the eggs, and placed the Dove's egg under the Parrakeet and
vice versa. I again found the Parrakeet unreliable, so allowed the Doves to
continue sitting on the Parrakeet's egg (only one was laid on this occasion)
with the ultimate result that the egg was hatched. Unfortunately, the
time of the year was against rearing the young one, and the Doves could
not feed it although they tried, I believe, very hard, and, as I thought, were
succeeding. I did not interfere until the Sunday morning, when I found it
dead, although it was alive at twelve o'clock on the Saturday night, it
having been hatched on the previous Friday.
I showed both my pairs of Kings and Crimson-wings at the Crystal
Palace last year. It was my first attempt at showing, and I was awarded
1st for the Kings and Extra 3rd for the Crimson-wings--the well-deserved
reproof from Dr. Simpson, in his article of March last, may explain why
the latter did not do better. The hen had laid an egg the day before being
sent to the Show, and I can only plead my ignorance in birdy matters for
having sent her. As it was, she caught cold and I very nearly lost her, as
she parted with a soft egg after a very great deal of trouble. Since then she
has recovered, and I am looking forward to trying again to get them to
breed, and shall be very grateful for any information concerning either the
Crimson-wings or Kings.
I may add that they occupy a cage 23m. by 19m. bj&apos; 19m,with a breeding
box attached, into which is fitted a block of wood hollowed to the centre,
so that the eggs will be prevented from rolling about. I have not pre-
viously had such a suitable nest-box as I have now, consequently I am a
little more sanguine of success.

A CHEAP FOOD FOR INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS.
Sir, --Towards the end of 1896, I received a letter from our member,
Mr. Frank Finn, Indian Museum, Calcutta (dated December 9th) as follows:
" Dear Sir,--I am sending you, this mail, a pound sample of a dried insect
which I think would prove cheaper and more attractive as food for birds
than ant cocoons. I have seen it eaten dry, by several species, and am now
feeding a Sliama largely on it. You will see that it ought to be just the
thing for breeding Finches. Should a demand for it arise, any quantity
could, I think, be supplied, as the insect is excessively abundant during a
short period each year, andean be collected in handfuls under lamps. You
might, if you would, bring this to the notice of the Avicultural Society."
On the 2nd of January, the box arrived and I opened it with interest;
I found it filled with a mass of minute insects, about the size of Aphides,
bright green sometimes varied with black. Close examination proved that
they were the perfect insects produced from some form of "cuckoo-spit"

or "spittle insect," belonging, in all probability, to the genus lassus. I
was not, however, able to identify the species, as it was not represented in
the Natural History Museum. It belongs to the same group of insects as
the so-called " dried flies " well-known to aviculturists, but is much smaller
and, owing to its green colouring, attracts the attention of the birds more
readily than the wliity-brown species generally in use.
I found that not only was this insect relished by the American Blue-
bird, the Green Cardinal, the Liothrix and the Yellow Wagtail, to all of
which I offered the insects dry, and unmixed with other food ; but that some
which I gave to a friend (who is anxious about his Indigo Bunting) were
greedily eaten by half-a-dozen Canaries as soon as they were put in a little
heap on the floor of the aviary.
I have since mixed them with my usual soft food, and find that all
my insectivorous birds have eaten them. If, therefore, these insects can be
imported so as to be obtainable at a cheaper rate than ants' cocoons, they
would certainly be a great boon to aviculturists.

ZOSTEROPS.
[In reply to an enquiry by a member as to what Zosterops are, the
following letter was written by Mr. Phillipps.]
These are little birds freely scattered over large portions of the world.
Many of the species have a ring of white feathers round the eye, from
which they take their name (Zosterops) and also the familiar name of
Spedtacle-bird usually given to them in this country. Over eighty species
are known, but, so far as I have observed, only two have been shown in this
country -- I maybe quite wrong here--an Australian and a Chinese species.
For a few years back, not many appeared, and these were sold at
very high prices: consequently the markets are now glutted. On their
arrival, they are usually in poor condition and partially naked; but I find
that they are easily kept, and with warmth and proper care will come
round all riglit if not too far gone. They are lively little things, and have a
cheerful twitter. The}' require to be always eating, and should always
have a supply of food in their cage ; during the dark evenings a light
should be supplied, so that they may feed up to at least io p.m. or n p.m.
They make a lot of mess in their cage. The most suitable foods for them,
according to my experience, are stewed apple sweetened with white castor
sugar, biscuit and milk sop, pears, bananas, and a little insectivorous food.
Mine were very keen after prepared yolk of egg: but I think it should be
given only in moderation. I found them slow in taking to a new food, but
when once they commenced on the stewed apple, they wholly deserted the
raw. I could never teach my birds to touch grapes.

THE ORNAMENTED LORIKEET.
Trichoglossus ornatus.
By C. S. Simpson.

There are, I suppose, few aviculturists who have not at
some time or another been fascinated by the splendid beauty of
some species of Trichoglossus seen, perchance, at a Show or in a
dealer's shop. Some, doubtless, have purchased such birds,
only to find that the attention required to keep them clean and
healthy was too great for their patience : others, more cautious,
have taken the precaution of referring to some popular work on
aviculture and have read so forbidding an account of the delicacy,
the uncleanliness, and the difficulty of feeding Lorikeets, that
they have then and there forsworn the care of such birds.
And yet, of a truth, Lorikeets are by no means specially
troublesome to attend to, provided that suitable surroundings
can be given them. I willingly grant that under unsuitable
conditions no birds are more troublesome and unsatisfactory to
the aviculturist.
Those members of the Avicultural Society who have kept
Ornamented Lorikeets will readily, I believe, endorse the above
remarks. An Ornamented Lorikeet kept under unsuitable con-
ditions, that is, kept separately in a small cage, is a miserable
creature capable of affording but little pleasure to its owner;
but a pair of the species, kept in a moderately large aviary, are
things of beauty and a joy for ever.
The name of "Ornamented Lorikeet" was given to this
bird by Dr. Russ, in accordance with its Latin name, and a fairly
good description of the bird is given in that author's " Speaking
Parrots," though he does not appear to have had personal
experience of it. " It is," he tells us," a native of Celebes, and the
Togian Islands. Dr. A. B. Meyer found it there in abundance
and sometimes in very large flocks, which flew away with rapid

strokes of the wing, uttering short shrill cries. The natives
keep them in numbers, chained to a little stand before the doors
of their huts by means of a ring made of cocoa-nut shell, and
feed them with rice and bananas. The above-named explorer
informs us that this bird has a perceptible and not unpleasant
smell of musk."
My first Ornamented Lorikeet was obtained three years
ago, and, as I had no aviary available at the time, was kept in
an ordinary square parrot-cage. I soon came to the conclusion
that this species is not suited to cage life. My bird was not wild
(on the contrary, he was a bold and fearless bird, though
excitable) but his movements were rapid and sudden, and he
*constantly injured his plumage against the wires : he was restless
and active, always wanting to fly, and would start from his perch
with a strong " whirrh " of the wings, only to be brought up in a
few inches by the bars of his prison. And, like all caged Lori-
keets, he was a dirty bird, and his cage required constant attention
to keep it even fairly sweet.
After a time, he was transferred to a small aviary in
company with half-a-dozen other Parrakeets. Here he was
happy enough, and soon reduced his comrades to a very sub-
missive condition, but he was of an interfering and jealous
disposition and could never leave any female Parrakeet alone.
Constant squabbles were the result, and in these he was invariably
victorious. Failing to obtain a bride of his own species, he was
eventually satisfied with a hen Purple-capped Lory, for whom
he manifested the greatest affeCtion and with whom for a time he
was happy enough.
In the Autumn of 1895, m Y friend Mr. W. H. Betts offered
to lend me a female Ornamented Lorikeet in order that I might
attempt to breed the species. I need hardly say that the offer
was gladly accepted ; an aviary was prepared for the reception
of the pair and they were duly introduced, the Purple-capped
Lory being relegated to a cage in the same room. The aviar} 7
which I gave them was about ten feet by three, and nine feet
high--small in comparison with some of those described by
contributors to the Magazine, but large enough to afford the
Lorikeets an opportunity of stretching their wings. Their
delight on acquiring this moderate degree of freedom was
intense, and their activity was marvellous : from morning to
night they were in constant movement, chasing each other from
bough to bough, whirring with their strong rapid flight from end
to end of their domain, hopping with quaint sidelong jumps

on the floor, and occasionally occupying a short period of
comparative repose by performing each others' toilet. They
frequently bathed, soaking themselves until they were unable to
fly. Kept thus, no birds could have been less troublesome than
the Ornamented Dorikeets: a very simple diet sufficed to keep
them in splendid health, and with a good layer of sawdust
on the floor, a weekly cleaning was all that the aviary required.
Their diet consisted of canary and hemp-seed (which they took
readily), a saucer of bread and milk every morning, and a piece
of banana or other fruit later in the day. The male bird was
bold, and would fly on to the food-saucer and help himself while
I held it, but he showed no liking for human society and would
never allow familiarities ; the hen was shyer.
On the approach of Spring, the male bird's attentions to
his lady became marked and demonstrative : he constantly drove
her about the aviary, and, for a time, she would fly from him,
then, relenting, would rest tranquilly on a bough, while he
performed the most grotesque antics which she, doubtless, thought
charming. His love-making consisted of a peculiar dance, or
rather a series of jerky movements of the head and body,
puffing out his body feathers, putting out his tongue, and uttering
various clucking and hissing noises. During the time of court-
ship he would never, if he could prevent it, allow the hen to feed
herself. Whenever she tried to reach the food-vessels he drove
her away, and after helping himself called her to him and fed her
with regurgitated food. I watched them closely, and I believe, for
days together, the hen received nothing but what the cock gave
her; but as she remained plump and well, there seemed no reason
for interference.
When I thought the pair ready to nest, I provided them
with a small barrel artistically covered with bark, hung rather
high and secluded by surrounding branches. They at once set
to work on this, pulled off every atom of bark, and bit every
twig off the surrounding boughs. They took possession of the
barrel and spent much of their time scuffling about inside it: the
hen always spent the night in it, the cock usually roosting on the
top or in the entrance-hole.
To my great disappointment, they never got any further
than this : both birds were in splendid health and condition,
they paired, and during the whole of the Summer appeared to be
on the point of nesting, but no eggs were laid, and on the
approach of Autumn their manifestations of affedtion became
less demonstrative, though they still appeared greatly attached
to each other.

Mr. Frohawk's beautiful plate renders a detailed descrip-
tion of the plumage unnecessary: the distinction between the
sexes is not such as could be represented in an illustration,
though I could always easily recognise the female by the slightly
narrower skull and the generally more effeminate (I can think of
no better word) appearance.
Until the last two or three years, the Ornamented Uorikeet
was a very rare bird indeed, but a considerable number were
imported in 1895, an d since then they have been comparatively
common.

CRYSTAL PALACE SHOW, 1897.
BRITISH BIRDS (OMITTING CLASSES 92-95 &amp; 99.)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984625" page_id="32635125"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
By J. Lewis Bonhote.
The Palace Show this year cannot be said to differ much
from its predecessors. In the actual number of exhibits there
was a slight falling off, but the quality was quite up to the usual
standard. The pick of the show, as far as British Birds are con-
cerned, was a Long-tailed Tit, exhibited by Mr. Fulljames. It
was a nice bird in good trim, and anyone who has kept, or
attempted to keep, British Birds knows the difficulty that has to
be overcome with such birds ; it ought undoubtedly to have taken
first. Again let me protest, as I did last year, against distinctive
marks on the cages, such as instructions for feeding (in one or
two cases with initials), or a peculiar printed label stating the
name of the bird. I do not wish to imply for a moment that
these marks are placed there for any but legitimate purposes ;
but all exhibitors must realise that it opens a high road to
collusion between judge and exhibitor. Another point was that
the hall was kept at rather too high a temperature ; this may be
hard to regulate, but it ought to be possible; as it was, at least
one bird succumbed to the effects, while several others had to be
removed.
The judging, as usual, presented the customary formalities
and freaks. Looking at the awards, one would be apt to
imagine that the judge did not know what the typical Linnet or
Siskin was like. However, let us take the classes in order and
examine the facts, which are stubborn things and more stable than
their opinions. The Bullfinches were a large class and contained
many birds of high merit. There was the usual sprinkling of
small foreigners, most of which were rightly ignored ; 1,368,
1st, was a splendid specimen, good in every way and well worth
its place; 1,344, 2n was a nice sized bird, but had no colour,

and its left leg had at one time been broken ; 1,346, 3rd, was a
very good bird, but I should call it a small foreigner; it is of
course a matter on which one cannot be quite certain, and I have
no doubt the judge drew his conclusions carefully before
awarding it a prize; 1,341, was a specially fine bird and ought to
have been noticed.
Class 85 (Goldfinches) was a very strong class, almost all the
birds being of high merit, and the judging, which can have been
no easy task, was creditably done.
Class 86 (Chaffinches) was a small class; only two
approached a typical bird, namely 1,444, which was 3rd, its only
fault being that it was wild, and 1,450, which was unnoticed.
All the rest were far too dark and deserved no notice whatever.
Class 87 (Linnets) was a large class, but it ought not to
have been hard to judge ; 1,470, 2nd, was by far the best;
1,497, 3 r d&amp;gt; being also a good bird ; while the next best was 1,468,
H.C. ; 1,479, 1st, was very dark and as unlike the typical wild
Linnet as a Mealy Redpoll.
Class 88 (Redpolls). At the beginning of the catalogue I
read "Preference in judging will be given to cage-moulted
specimens." I11 accordance (?) with this rule the one bird in this
class not cage-moulted takes first. There were also several
beautiful Lesser Redpolls, all of which were unnoticed. The
best bird in the class was 1,512, though it may possibly have been
colour-fed ; 1,510, 2nd, was the next best.
Class 89 (Siskins). The prizes all went to colour-fed birds.
Whatever may be said to the contrary, I feel sure that this is a
wrong system; the only standard we can take by which to judge
a British Bird is that of its wild brethren, who never assume the
beautiful (?) colour of 1,517 and 1,518, the first and second. The
best bird in the class was 1,527.
Again there is a "boom" in Skylarks, which were well
represented this year; 1,537, 2u d, was the best, being a fine slim
upstanding bird, while 1,542 ought to have been second.
Class 91 (Robins) was a good class ; 1,552, 1st, being a
specially fine bird, next to him I preferred 1,547.
The Hybrid Class (No. 96) brought forth nothing very
striking, most of them being Bullfinch-Goldfinch or Bullfinch-
Linnet. Among the others were Greenfinch-Linnet, Twite-
Linnet, Goldfinch-Greenfinch, wild bred; and a Siskin-Redpoll,
Greenfinch-Bullfinch, artificially produced. First went to a fine
Linnet-Bullfinch ; 2nd, to a Bullfinch-Goldfinch ; and 3rd, to a

colour-fed Bullfinch - Lfinnet, at least I believe that to have
been its parentage, it was stained almost beyond recognition.
Class 97 (Albinos). First went to the usual White Black-
bird, as this is the only true Albino shown it deserved its place,
but to give 1,630 fourth because it had a few white feathers in fit
is quite another story. Next to Sparrows, Blackbirds become
pied more commonly than any other species ; 1,631, a White
Chaffinch, if such it be, ought to have been second, to me the beak
seemed to be too obtuse, and I fancy I detected some Canary
yellow about it; 1,632 was a beautiful Redpoll of a light
chocolate colour all over, and 1,636, second, a nice fawn-coloured
Starling. The class also included a Cinnamon Robin, third ; a
White Sparrow and two Cinnamon Greenfinches.
On first reaching the A.O.V. Class I at once began to
wonder how many anomalies I should find, and truly in this
show the judges seem to have surpassed themselves (if possible).
The first bird I looked at was a Brambling, which was in its
wrong class, but unnoticed, good! 1,643 was a fine Ortolan
Bunting, a thorough migratory bird, getting V.H.C. in the resident
class. Next came three Bramblings, all unnoticed, and I began
to give the judge credit for knowing the habits of one of our
commonest British Birds, when alas ! a few cages further on was a
Brambling getting V.H.C., and the judge's ignorance was dis-
played. I was glad to see this year that Grey Wagtails in the
A.O.V. (resident) were noticed, and the second prize bird was a
beauty. This is in any case a move in the right direction, for
last year they were all disqualified.
I11 Class 99 the judging was all right, two birds in the
wrong class being unnoticed.
Ret us now look at the A.O.V. (migratory) : 1,693 was a
very nice 7z&amp;lt;?7z-migratory bird, the Stonechat; it is, of course,,
awarded V.H.C.! ! ! 1,694, a Brambling in its right class gets
V.H.C. The judge evidently forgot he had already noticed it in
the non-migratory class. How can a bird be a resident and a
migrant at the same time ? An answer will oblige ! ! 1,695 was a
Swallow in very bad condition, but it is, or rather has been, a
Swallow, and that is sufficient to give it V.H.C.!! ! 1,698, a
Grey Wagtail in its wrong class takes V.H.C., but the judge
rightly considers it a resident bird, how then can it be a migrant?
Will someone enlighten me ? The judge must (?) be right! ! ! !
The rest of the class was chiefly composed of Redstarts, some of
very high merit, a fine Wheatear, two or three Ring Ouzels, and
a very fine Red-backed Shrike. The first prize bird, a Redstart,

holds the distinction of being among the worst in its class, very
dark in colour, and rather wild; 1,711 (V.H.C.) was the best
Redstart there. A Redwing, not a very good one, was un-
noticed, as of course our good friend the Waxwing, and, needless
to say, a Corncrake. A Crossbill in its wrong class was, however,
worthy of a card.
So much for the judging, now for the birds. In Class 98
A.O.V. (small), Mr. Galloway's Goldcrest takes first, and great
credit is due to that gentleman for having kept it so long ; it
looked rather " thick" and sat with its head under its wing, and
I should therefore have placed it third ; 2nd was, as stated above,
a splendid Grey Wagtail, and 3rd a Long-tailed Tit in very fine
trim, which ought, undoubtedly, to have taken premier honours ;
1,641 was a nice Meadow Pipit and 1,659 a good Blue Tit.
One word about Class 99, which is in better hands than
mine. Birds of prey are excluded, but a bird larger than most
of our British Birds of prey, feeding solely on raw meat, takes
first prize. Another conundrum !
The Nightingale and Blackcap class was not very remark-
able. The first prize went to a moderately good Nightingale ;
2nd, to another Nightingale, badly shown and in bad feather ;
3rd, to a very large and good bird, the best Nightingale ; while
the best bird in the class was a very fine Blackcap (No. 1,689)
which got V.H.C.
THE LARGER BRITISH AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
By Thomas Marshall.
This department of the 1897 Ornithological Revel at the
Crystal Palace having been allotted to me, I snatched what time
I could from the usual round of handshaking and social reunion
which this event annually brings about to jot down a few notes
anent the exhibits in Classes 92, 93, 94, 95, and 99.
Commencing with the Blackbirds, I found much to admire
in the class, the first prize bird (1,560) being a very fine specimen
with wonderfully good bill and eye-cere. The owner of this bird
is to be congratulated on getting both size and quality, a by 110
means common combination in a male Blackbird. The other birds
in this class do not call for further comment excepting 1,558,
which, for so young a bird, had a remarkably deep-coloured bill.
The twenty Song Thrushes forming the next class were an
ordinary lot. The first prize went to the biggest bird (1,575), but
to my mind the best bird in the class was 1,574. a young and very
stylish bird, nicely spotted, and undoubtedly a male, which I

<bodyText confidence="0.999411627906977" page_id="32635129"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
could not say of the winner. I have never been able to under-
stand old scaly-legged Thrushes beating young clean-legged
birds, other things, except mere size, being equal; nor should fat
dumpy Thrushes be preferred to the slim and reacts sort, all too
seldom seen on the show bench. I have often compared the one
to a cart horse and the other to a thoroughbred, and I do not con-
sider the simile too far fetched. The third prize went to an
erstwhile inmate of my own bird-room, whose show days I con-
sidered over when I presented him to his present owner nearly
twelve months ago. No. 1,585 (V.H.C.) was a very light and
stylish bird, and was certainly better marked than 1,586, which
took fourth prize. The owner of 1,571 evidently wished it to be
understood that sopped bread and crushed hemp seed was an
ideal food for Thrushes, for he expressly stipulated that his
bird was to be so fed, poor bird.
Class 94 was the Starlings, not the least interesting of
which was Mr. Fulljames' well-known bird, which had a word
for any visitor who cared to speak to it. What he said I am
unable to record, but he appeared to mean well. Mere intelligence,
however, does not win honours at the Palace, and this loquacious
bird had to be content with third prize. The old adage that fine
feathers do not make fine birds does not hold good at bird shows,
however, and 1,595 and 1,592, the first and second prizes,
deserved their respective positions, 1,595 being a beautifully
lustrous specimen.
The winner of the first prize in the next class was the
well-known Magpie " Victor" (1,604). This bird was in superb
condition and clearly deserved first honours. I11 awarding the
other prizes, however, the judge seems to have felt it desirable to
give a prize to one of each sort in the class, accordingly he gave
second to a Jay (1,606) with a bad wing and a fraj^ed tail; and
third to a Jackdaw (1,598) in by no means good feather. There
were other birds in this class which for condition alone beat it
by many points, notably 1,600, a Magpie, which, had it not been
shown in a wicker cage, must have commanded higher honour
than the V.H.C. awarded to it.
The Missel Thrushes in Class 99 were very good specimens,
especial^ 1,663, which was a very steady bird in grand condition
and nicely marked; why it should have been called upon to play
second fiddle to the Raven (1,672), which, by the way, had a deformed
claw, is a matter for conjecture; and I must say a good word
for 1,664, a well-marked cage-moulted Fieldfare, which deserved
a card, but was unnoticed.

I will conclude by saying that the feeding of the birds in
the classes I have discussed was simply disgraceful. I am quite
sure that to many an insectivorous bird at this show it was a week
of starvation, not because food was not given them, but because
they would prefer death to eating the atrocious mixture of pea-
meal, fat, and treacle provided for their delectation.

FOREIGN FINCHES AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.

By A. G. Butler.
This year's show of Foreign Birds was, in my opinion,
vastly superior to that of 1896, and I only regretted that I had
not secured two holidays instead of one, in which I could do
justice to them ; the fadt being that so many aviculturists were
present, some of whom I then made the acquaintance of for the
first time, that I really had but little leisure in which to study
the finches.
At the opening of the show the light was so bad that the
smaller birds looked pretty nearly all one colour, and therefore
the quietest time was lost in examining birds which were large
enoughto be recognised : later, however, either thelight improved
or my e}^es became accustomed to the semi-darkness of the tent,
so that I was able to commence the examination of Class 103.
The first question which arose respecting the two Parrot
Finches to which first prize was awarded was as to whether a
hen bird, however old, ever attained to the brilliant colouring of
either of these specimens. I11 my own mind I must confess that
I decided against thepossibility and concluded that they were both
cocks : an undoubted pair shown b} r Mr. Osbaldeston, should, I
think, have taken precedence, although the cock was less
brilliant, and the hen had evidently not by any means attained
her full colouring.
Mr. Maxwell's Pin-tailed Nonpareils appeared to be a
good pair; but, without lifting up the cage and turning it
towards the end of the tent (which I did not venture to do) I
could not see them distinctly.
As regards the Gouldian Finches, I considered none of them
veiy remarkable, but the condition of Mrs.Wickin's pair beingfiner
than that of the single Red-headed male to which the third prize
was awarded, personally I should have preferred the Black-heads.
Class 104. Among the Java Sparrows, Mr. Oakey's pair of
white birds was very pnre and perhaps deserved its position, but
I noticed that one of them (apparently the female) had lost a
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.985772136363636" page_id="32635131"  page_num="90" year="" vol="">
go
good many feathers from one side of the body in a patch : this
would have been considered a serious blemish in the eyes of
some judges and should certainly, if possible, be avoided by
exhibitors of white birds ; Mr. Smith's pair well deserved the
second place. I was amused to see that the low price which I
put upon my pied birds caused them to be snapped up quite early
in the day.
Class 105. In the Class for Weavers and Whydahs, our
friend Mr. Fulljames, who seems to make a speciality of these
birds, had things pretty much to himself: his hong-tailed
Whydali was in good form and clean ; though, being a
young bird, it has not yet attained its full colouring. Mr.
Housden's birds were more matured in colouring, but almost
too recently imported to stand a chance of winning against the
more perfedt and cleaner bird ; next year they may prove
dangerous opponents. Mr. Fulljames' Crimson-banded Whydali
was a healthy young bird ; curiously enough only just coming
into breeding plumage, at this season, when most Whydahs have
either just lost or are beginning to lose their summer dress : his
Yellow-shouldered Whydali and Taha Weaver were both good
examples of interesting species.
Class 106. This was a very good class, in which Mr.
Fulljames again figured largely : his Australian Fire-finches
were a very nice pair, and I was sorry to see that the hen looked
out of sorts ; I hope she may have recovered later in the day ;
his Cordon Bleus and Rufous-backed Mannikins were also in
excellent form, as also were Mr. Housden's Red-headed Finches,
as nice a pair as I have seen. Mr. Maxwell's birds were all
very good, but few persons present could recognise Dufresne's
Waxbills under the fearful misprint of " Drefree's " ; Mr.
Watson's Rufous-tailed Grass-finches were not a bad pair by
any means ; but--the gem of the class, and well worthy of a
double first, was Mr. Castellan's charming male Violet-eared
Waxbill. May we all some day have many such !
The two next classes always irritate me ; they have no
business amongst our tropical pets ; they are a vain repetition
of British species in the Foreign sedition of the show, and ought
to be classed as 84A Continental examples, 85A Continental
examples. I did not at all approve of the judging of the Gold-
finches; all the prize birds were very steady, but extremely dull
in colour, almost as dull as hens. The wildest bird in the class
was far and away the best bird, and, should it live to grow tame,
will doubtless carry off all the firsts in future years. It was

exhibited by Dr. Frederic Dale, and is, without exception, the
most brightly and distinctly marked Goldfinch I ever saw, with a
pure white baud on the nape where other birds have a blurred
whitish bar. The Bullfinches, which are far more difficult to
judge, were, I think, well treated.
Class 109. I was delighted to see that Mr. Davis' Thick-
billed Cardinal occupied the place of honour this year. Mr.
Osbaldeston's Virginian Cardinal doubtless deserved the second
place and got it; but it was by no means the brightest specimen
of the species which I have seen. Mr Housden's Popes took
third ; they were not a bad pair, though he has had brighter
specimens.
Class no. I was much charmed with Mr. Humphrys'
Trumpeter Bullfinches which rightly took first; Mr. Ball's
Nonpareil was not a bad example of a cage-moulted bird, but I
should have given precedence to Mr. Housden's much rarer
Grosbeak (No. 1855). Mr. Maxwell's Black-headed Siskin was
in grand condition and made the successful winner of last year
look rather dowdy, whilst his Blue Grosbeak, in spite of its
being a little abraded about the base of the beak and elsewhere,
was a lovely bird and a treat to look at. Mr. Ball's Indigo-bird
must, I think, have been forced into its colour before its time,
but it looked well and happy.

The Crystal Palace Bird Show of 1897, the greatest event
of avicultural interest of the year, has come and gone, and to
lovers of foreign birds it will long be remembered as the finest
show that has been held for many a day. When looking around
a show like the one that has just gone by, one cannot help
realizing that aviculture, although still in its youth, is indeed
growing apace, thanks, in a great measure, to those in whose
minds the happy idea originated of forming a society devoted
entirely to this delightful science.
It was very pleasant to meet several old friends, and to be
introduced to others whose names one has long known, almost
as well as one's own, although never before having had the
pleasure of an introduction.
The three classes for insectivorous and fruit-eating birds
contained some of the rarest and most interesting birds in

the show ; many, indeed, were entirely new to many avieulturists
present, whilst one looked in vain for some old friends : where
are the pretty little Red-sided Tits ? Gone, I fear, to their
happy hunting grounds, after a brief sta)&apos; amongst us, perhaps
to be seen again no more for many years to come.
Class 112 (Any species of Tanager or Bulbul) contained
twenty-one entries, all of which showed up, although, un-
fortunately, the best bird should have been elsewhere. This little
gem, catalogued as Dacnis cayana, is, I believe, the female Yellow-
winged Sugar-bird, perhaps more correctly named Coereba
cyanea. Although exceedingly rare in this country, I believe
examples of the female have occasionally been exhibited in the
Zoological Gardens, where there are now some specimens of the
male, a glorious little creature of brilliant shades of blue and
black. It is a South American species. The specimen exhibited
by Mr. Fulljames received the special prize for the best foreign
bird in the show.
The first prize in this class was awarded to Mr. Russell
Humphrys for a very perfect Blue-winged Honeysucker. Mr.
Osbaldeston received the second, for his Superb Tanager, and a
truly superb specimen it was, without a fault, apparently. A
nice Green Malabar Honeysucker, belonging to Mr. Maxwell,
received the third prize. Perhaps in somewhat less perfect
plumage than its Blue-winged cousins, this was, nevertheless, a
very good bird. A Violet Tanager belonging to the same
exhibitor as the last was well worth the fourth prize which it
received. Prominent in this class was a very fine pair of (V.H.C.)
White-eared Bulbuls; by the way, the males of this species are, I
am told, excellent songsters. Mr. Housden's Red-vented Bulbul
was the survivor of last year's first prize pair: this bird was
awarded a V.H.C. card. There were no less than five Scarlet
Tanagers, each of which received V.H.C. A very nice Black
Tanager was Highly Commended.
Class 113 (Any species of Crow, Jay, Magpie, Starling, or
Mynah). There were here eleven entries, all very good birds.
Mr. Humphrys' Black-throated Grakle made a good first-prize
winner, and certainly appeared to be very proud of his achieve-
ment, for he was for ever chattering, and puffing out his feathers
and spreading his tail. He is a beautiful bird, but his incessant
cries and chatter must become somewhat monotonous after a
time.
A Purple-headed Glossy Starling, belonging to Mr. H. B.
Smith, received the second prize ; the third going to Mr.

Arthur's grand Mexican Jay. Mr. Maxwell's Long-tailed Glossy
Starling was fourth : it had a somewhat rough tail; but the
difficulty of keeping birds with such long tails in perfect feather
in cages is very great, and the judge probably considered this
point before awarding the prize.
There were other good birds in this class, but with the
above rarer species to compete against, they had to take a back
seat. There were two Green Glossy Starlings, each of which
received V.H.C. ; a pair of common Brown Mynahs (H.C.) ; a
pair of the somewhat uninteresting Military Troupials (V.H.C.) ;
a Black - backed Piping Crow (H.C.) ; and a female Black
Tanager, which was, apparently, not noticed by the judge, for it
should have been marked "Wrong Class." I was sorry not to
see either species of Hill Mynah represented here.
Class 114 (Any species of insectivorous or fruit eating
bird not previously mentioned). This was a grand class and
consisted of no less than thirty entries, four of which were,
however, absent, whilst a fifth should have been elsewhere.
Mr. Humphrys again carried off the palm in this class,
his beautiful Garrulous Honey-eaters being easily first. It will
be remembered that a full account of these rare birds, written
by their fortunate owner, appeared in No. 26 of this Magazine.
They are certainly delightful birds, and were, moreover, seen to
the best advantage in their very room}^ cage, With reference
to cages, of course those exhibitors who live but a short way
from the Palace have a distiudt advantage over those who live at
a distance and have to trust their birds to the tender mercies of
railway porters. The former can afford to show their birds in
large roomy cages, whereas, to the latter, the carriage by rail
would be no small item of expense.
Mrs. Henderson well deserved the second prize for a very
good specimen of the somewhat rare Lettered Aracari. The
third prize went to Mr. Humphrys' Australian Bell-bird, an
exceedingly pretty creature. A Yellow-tufted Honey-eater, sent
by the same gentleman as the last, was, like all his exhibits, well
shown and in perfedt condition, and worthy of more than V.H.C.,
but it had to stand aside for Mr. Osbaldeston's Green-billed
Toucan : a grand bird, which received the fourth prize. An
Ariel Toucan, belonging to the same gentleman, received V.H.C.
Two pairs of Zosterops were exhibited, and a very nice Wax-
wing (H.C.) of which species, by the way, there was an example
in a British class. Mr. Fulljames' beautiful Shama (V.H.C.)
was the only representative of this very delightful species.

There were three Brazilian Hangnests, all good birds. Mr.
Fulljames' Blue Robins were a very nice pair, and a single bird
of the same species, belonging to Mr. Ball, was equally good.
Two good pairs of Pekin Robins were shown ; but, poor little
chaps! they stood no chance of a card in such a class. There
was a very nice Dyal-bird (V.H.C.) shown by Mr. Maxwell.
This bird is said to be one of the most delightful and intelligent
of cage-birds, and it is a great pity that it should not be more
often imported. A very good (V. H. C.) Mocking Bird was
exhibited by Mr. H. Phillips, and a (wrong class) Glossy
Starling was sent by Mr. Swaysland. Mr. Housden's Blue-
cheeked Barbet (V.H.C.) was a very nice bird, the survivor of a
pair exhibited last year. Two Golden Orioles were shown by
Mr. Babb, but in a miserable cage and without tails they looked
anything but attractive objects : they were catalogued as
" nestlings," but what constitutes a nestling ? These birds were
certainly wearing their adult plumage, in fact, had worn it
nearly all away. I might mention here, with reference to
the question as to whether this species should be considered
"British" or not, that I remember years ago my father telling me
of a pair of Golden Orioles which took up their abode one summer
in our garden in Surrey : they were, of course strictly protected by
him, and although a nest was never discovered, it was evident, by
the movements of the birds, that they had a nest somewhere in
the grounds.
A Pectoral Rail (not Pectral or Pectorial, please) with a
somewhat rough tail, and a very good Chinese Jay-thrush
(V.H.C.) complete the somewhat long list of non-seed-eaters.
On the whole, the show was a grand one, and worth going
a long way to see.

These notes were taken at the end of a very tiring day's
work of judging, and in a bad light, so I must ask the indulgence
of my readers if the}&apos;- be found in any detail inaccurate.
The Parrot classes were, in every case, well filled, and the
majority of the specimens were of high merit. One expedts,
however, at the Palace, to meet with at least a few novel or
rare birds, and in this respedt this portion of the show was
disappointing.

Of Dove-birds there were nine entries, and of these no less
than eight were of the Peach-faced species, the remaining couple
being Davender - headed. Mr. Storey's pair, which took first
prize, were beauties, and catalogued at a low price. Although
the Peach-faced birds are much more common than they were a
few years back, it is seldom that a pair can be bought for a
reasonable sum.
The Budgerigars were good, especialty those belonging to
Mr. Arthur, which took ist and 2nd prizes, but caged Budgerigars
are rather dull birds at the best. There were some good 3^ellow
or albino specimens, but I do not admire these.
Class 117 contained an assortment of Rosellas and Mealy
Rosellas, good, but not especially interesting, and the same may
be said of the King and Crimson-wing Parrakeets (Class 118).
Here Mr. Doherty's King and Queen were again first, though
the former suffers from a deformed toe : nevertheless, they are a
grand pair.
Class 119 (Ring-necked or Indian Parrakeets). The most
interesting exhibit in this class, to my mind, was Mr. Maxwell's
Malaccan or Pink-cheeked Parrakeet, which seemed, moreover,
to be in fine condition. Mr. Railton's Ring-necked, which was
first, was, however, a ver} r good bird.
Class 120 (Dories and Dorikeets) contained thirteen birds,
and would doubtless have been better filled if the birds could
have been shown in pairs. Mr. Housden's Ceram or Chattering
Dory, an old stager, was again first, and a good Ornamented
Dorikeet, belonging to Mr. Maxwell, was second. Three
beautiful specimens of Swainson's Dorikeet were contributed by
Mr. Waddell, Mr. Bellani}q and Mr. Frostick respectively: it
was difficult to say which was the best of these. Mr. H. B.
Smith sent two Dories, neither of which was in first - rate
condition : one of these was a Red Dory f Eos rubra), the other
I hesitate to name from memory, though I have seen the species
at the Zoo.
Class 121 (Single Parrakeets). The Pileated Parrakeet
made his third appearance and, I was glad to see, was awarded a
first prize. Second prize went to a fine Fiji or Masked Parrakeet.
Mr. Fulljames' Many-coloured Parrakeet was a nice bird, but not
quite faultless in condition ; the same gentleman took fourth
with a good Blue-bonnet. I wish this species was more often
to be obtained, for it is a charming bird. Two handsome
Barrabands were exhibited, Mr. Seth-Smith's being the better of

the two. Mr. Swaysland had a good Patagonian Conure, and
Mr. H. B. Smith a Red-rump, not in the best of plumage.
Class 122 (Parrakeets, in pairs) had an excellent pair of
Many-coloured Parrakeets, which won the first prize for Mr. H.
B. Smith ; several gorgeous pairs of Pennants, and a pair of
White-eared Conures, described by their owner as " very rare."
Dr. Butler entered a pair of Rosa's Parrakeets, the Burmah
variety of the Blossom-head, which were "wrong-classed," and
should, I think, without doubt, have been exhibited in Class 119.
Class 123 had eleven Grey Parrots ; the first-prize winner
was a beauty, and all were good.
Class 124 contained a grand array of twenty Amazon Parrots.
A Green-cheeked was first and a grand Yellow-naped came second.
A Spectacled Amazon was third, a small and uncommon species,
one of the most interesting in the class. Mr. Osbaldeston
contributed a magnificent Diademed, a Double-fronted, aSalvini's,
and a Maximilian's Parrot. The latter is a bird not often seen,
of a rather curious metallic green colour. Though sometimes
called Maximilian's Amazon, it is more correctty classed with
the Pionus Parrots.
Class 125 (Eclectus Parrots) had eight birds ; exhibitors
should, I think, have the option of sending these birds in pairs.
The specimen (No. 2,068) described as "supposed to be the
only specimen in England," was not named, but bore a close
resemblance to the male Red-sided, excepting only the absence
of the red sides. I believe this was Westerman's Eclectus. The
remaining seven were males and females of the Red-sided and
Grand Eclectus.
Class 126 had a very good Red-vented or Blue-headed
Parrot, one of the Pionus genus, a species not often seen and, I
believe, a very desirable pet. A fine Blue and Yellow Macaw
was first; and the remaining birds in the class were two
Senegals, a Vasa, a Red and Blue, and an Illiger's, Macaw.
The Cockatoos were more numerous than usual, but some
of them wanted washing badly. The Eeadbeaters were good,
especially Mr. Martin's prize winner. Two Salmon-crested birds
were awarded first and second prizes respectively. Mr. Housden's
Slender-bill Cockatoo made its eighth appearance at the Palace.

CORRESPONDENCE.
THE TUI OR PARSON-BIRD.
Sir, -- I should be glad to know whether any of the members are
keeping or have kept the Tui or Parson-bird. I had a Tui some three years
ago, but only managed to keep it alive for three months. I found it the
most interesting bird I ever had, but it died suddenly, having been
apparently quite well the day before. After death, it was found to be a mass
of fat, and no doubt it died in a fit.
F. MoKRSCHEhh.
The following ?-eply was sent to Mr. Moerschell.
I kept the Tui very successfully years ago, one female living with me
from May, 1889, to August, 1892--over three years, in perfect health and
plumage, and then it died in a fit (the usual cause of death) from eating
something intended for some other birds. If properly attended to, there is
no reason why it should not live any length of time.
Some two 3&apos;ears ago, or more, since when an unusual number of
Tuis have been brought over in excellent condition, I noticed that the old
food had been discontinued, and that the Tuis were being brought over on
condensed milk ; (one of our members referred to this food in the Magazine
last summer or autumn). I have used Nestles' condensed milk and biscuit
for a long time past for my Lorikeets, and certainly should use it (with
caution, for it is very sweet) for Tuis, should I ever keep them again.
I take a little out of the tin with a small spoon, and place the spoon
with its contents in a small saucer (a deep one if it can be got ); over this I
crumble biscuit and then fill up with water. Finally, with the spoon, to
which much of the milk will adhere, I stir &apos;well up, until all in the spoon has
been dissolved. The best biscuit for birds that I know of (if there is a better
I should like to know of it) is Huntley and Palmer's tea biscuit. I give
ordinary biscuit (the more I see of bread for birds the less I like it) and milk
sop in the morning, substituting the preserved milk in the afternoon, as it
does not get sour during the night: by this arrangement the birds have
plenty of food in the early morning to keep them going until their
"breakfast" is served.
I have tried honey and various other things, but have not found
anything to come up to well-stewed apple sweetened with castor (my brown)
sugar. I give this in addition to the milk, and also other food according to
the bird.
The Tui has a brush-tipped tongue, and during a fine summer, when
mine were out in the garden, they were constantly seen hanging downwards
from the branches of any low bush or tree, thrusting their tongues into the
flowers. They also licked Aphidce from the leaves ; but most of their insedt
prey w f as taken on the wing, the birds hawking until quite late in the
evening--but only after the smallest gnats and midges.
Only the smallest insedts should be supplied to them, winged ones in
preference, as the wings seem to adt as " dispersers." I do not approve of
dried ants'-eggs for Tuis, unless better than any I ever see, but fresh ants'-
eggs for a change might be very good. I should feel inclined to try dried
flies if one could get a good sample. Do everything you can to prevent

their getting fat and lazy. The longer the cage the better, with perches at
the ends only. Above each end perch there should be an extra little one ; the
one at the darker end will be used as a hiding-place (which these nervous
birds require) the other as a gymnastic-pole--for the Tui is a splendid
gymnast. The perches should be thin, but of different sizes. Never handle
or frighten them, for they (especially the females) will have partial paralysis
from sheer nervousness. I used always to place bromide of potassium in the
drinking water before moving the one I had for so long. Be very careful
about raw fruit, especially bananas; good grapes they appreciate, and
possibly the ripest of ripe pears would not hurt them.

BREEDING CRIMSON-WING AND KING PARRAKEETS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986902666666667" page_id="32635139"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In the February number of the Magazine, Mr. John Doherty
asks for a little information on the above subject, and I venture to send
these few notes. The idea of a Dove rearing a Parrakeet is novel, and, in
my humble opinion, impossible, the shape of the beak, etc., forbids it.
When Mr. Doherty gets a nest of Parrakeets, and sees the parents feeding
them, he will see the reason. Doves and Parrakeets do not, and cannot, feed
in the same way.
Crimson-wings (Aprosmictus crythropterus ) and Kings [Aprosmictus
scapulatus) were bred in France in 1880, (about), for the first time, as far as I
know, and have been bred (Crimson-wings especially) a considerable num-
ber of times since by amateurs. Instances have been recorded where
Crimson-wings in aviaries have laid on the ground, behind a faggot placed on
the floor of the aviary, where the Golden Pheasants they were kept with used
to lay; another time in an open box, with saw-dust in it, placed also on the
floor of the aviary; and again on the floor, in the usual nesting-box or log.
This would tend to show that they prefer a nest placed low, on or near the
floor, to high up under the roof; but anyone who breeds them in a good sized
aviary can put a nest-box in each position, then they can chose to then-
own liking. Kings prefer the nest-box fixed as high as possible under the
roof. Both species are capable of having two, or even three, nests in a year,
when they commence breeding early in the season, and the autumn is mild.
There are generally 3 eggs to the clutch, sometimes 2, but they have been
known to lay 4 and 5 per clutch. They incubate 21 days, and the young
remain 40 to 50 days in the nest. Food, canary seed, wheat, oats, sunflower
seed, hemp and maize, mixed or separate, and spray millet; green-food--
groundsel in flower, chickweed, etc., of which they require a large quantity
when feeding their young. Some amateurs give also, when they have
young, separatel}-, boiled maize and milk-sop--boiling milk poured over the
bread -- given cold, naturellement, but care must be taken these two latter do
not become sour; they must be given fresh at least once a day, and more
frequently in hot weather if they do become sour. Some pairs will eat fruit,
apples, pears, cherries, etc., while others will scarcely touch them. Both
.species are adult the third year, in full plumage by then and fit for breeding.
I never heard before of a pair trying to breed in a cage so small as the one
Mr. Doherty keeps his in. He has evidently a good pair anxious to breed,
and with care he ought to be successful. But a larger cage, a box-cage
wired at the front only, would suit better, say 3 or 4 feet cube, especially
when the young leave the nest and they require more room.

Sir,--A propos of the discussion on this subjetil, I may, perhaps, be
allowed to give my experience, which is to the effect that sweetened
bread-and-milk sop, made sloppy, appears to suit even such delicate
creatures as Sun-birds, which take it readily and appear to thrive on it.
Green Bulbuls (both Gold-fronted and Orange-bellied) seem to like
sop made with boiled rice and milk, well sweetened; so do Zosterops. I
think I have also given them bread-and-milk. Condensed milk should be
just the thing.
I only gave the sop once a day, and I fancy, in this climate, it
generally went sour; but this does not seem to affect the birds' health. I
have seen both Zosterops and a Grey-headed Mynah eat putrid banana,
without any ill effects, that I saw.
Why should not fruit-eating birds like these and Tanagers be fed on
scalded currants and Sultana raisins ?

Sir, -- I read with much interest Mr. Pliillipps' remarks on Spectacle
"birds (Zosterops) in this month's Magazine.
I have kept both varieties, Chinese and Australian, in a large aviary
cage with a number of small foreign birds. My Zosterops have always
been fed on Mr. Abrahams' insectivorous food mixed with bread crumbs
and slightly moistened, grated potato mixed with Mr. Abrahams' preserved
egg, and fresh fruit daily, oranges, pears, grapes, strawberries, etc. They do
not however care for bananas, and apples must be very soft and ripe to suit
their little beaks. The Chinese birds merely twittered, but the gre3 r -backed
Australian cock has a very sweet song. I often see them pecking at the
Millet sprays and at the seed tins, but I do not fancy they eat the seed.
Mine will eat meal-worms.
With regard to the articles on "quarrelsome birds" last year, I may
say that I found it impossible to keep Pekin Robins (Liothrix luteas) with
other birds. They were always pouncing on the little Waxbills and
suspending them by their tails. I had to give up keeping them in
consequence, and I found the Grey Singing Finch and Green Singing
Finch equally objectionable. Diamond Sparrows or Finches (.Staganopleura
guttata) are also very vicious, and one of mine killed a Pintail Nonpareil.

INDIGO BUNTINGS.
Sir, --I am anxious to know if the hen Indigo-finch can be easily
distinguished from a cock Indigo-finch out of colour ? Is there anv way
of distinguishing the sex ? Also would it be difficult to procure a hen ?
H. K. O. Warke;r.
The following reply was sent to Miss Walker.
The hen Indigo-finch is distinctly smaller than the male, three-tenths
of an inch shorter from beak to end of tail. In the winter she is decidedly
less blue both on wings and tail, and much more streaked, especial^ on the
breast, with dark brown.

THE SPELLING OF THE NAME " BENGALESE."

<bodyText confidence="0.996017888888889" page_id="32635141"  page_num="100" year="" vol="">
Mr. Wiener and Mr. Gedney, and, I believe, all of what may
be called the "earlier school" of avicultural writers, wrote " Bengalese,"
both for singular and plural. Dr. Butler writes "Bengalee" for the
singular and " Bengalees " for the plural, and Dr. Simpson (in his interesting
article on this species in a recent number of a weekly contemporary), uses
" Bengalee " for the singular and " Bengalese " for the plural.
Now, with all respedt, I venture to differ from my friends, and prefer
the original spelling, for the following reasons : (i) Bengalese is a perfectly
legitimate form, analogous to "Maltese" and "Japanese," and there is,
therefore, no reason for the change. (2) Bengali would be more correct
than Bengalee, but either requires to be pronounced with the accent on the
second syllable (Bengawly)--and surely it is not proposed to alter the
pronunciation as well as the spelling ?
The whole point is a very small one, and perhaps I ought to apologise
for calling attention to such minutiae. Of course the name itself, whatever
spelling or pronunciation be adopted, is absurdly inappropriate to the little
artificial product of the ingenious Japanese, which has no association
whatever with Bengal. Horatio R. Fieemer.

Sir, --I believe that most aviculturists who have studied this very
beautiful species are agreed that it is in most cases difficult, in many cases
impossible, to determine the sex with certainty, by a simple inspection.
This being so, I think a judge is hardly justified in disqualifying two birds
because he suspects that both birds are of the same sex. Unless he can
decide the point with tolerable certainty it is fairer to give the exhibitor the
benefit of the doubt, which he may nevertheless feel.
Dr. Butler thinks the two birds which won the first prize were both
cocks, and that Mr. Osbaldeston's pair should "have taken preference." I
do not think he quite grasps the situation. If I could have been
certain that Mr. Smith's birds were both cocks, it would have been my
duty to disqualify them : but, if I could not be certain, I was bound to admit
them to competition, and having admitted them, to judge them on their
merits.
Referring to the birds which Dr. Butler says were "an undoubted pair,"
I beg leave to differ from him. A pair they may have been ; an " undoubted "
pair they were not, for one of the birds was in immature plumage, and neither
Dr. Butler nor any one else could by simple inspection have formed an
opinion of much value as to whether it would eventually turn out to be a
cock or a hen. By-the-bye, in his recently-published and admirable work,
" Foreign Finches in Captivity," Dr. Butler (while quoting another author
on this subjedt) sums up his own opinion in the words "sexes alike:''

THE BLUE ROCK THRUSH.
By the Rev. Hubert D. Astley, M.A., F.Z.S.
Illustrated by the Author.
" The Sparrow that sitteth alone on the housetop "--as the
Psalmist writes. Passer is the Eatin for a Sparrow, and Passera
solitaria is the Italian name for the Blue Thrush. The Solitary
Sparrow. What happy sunshiny days the bird reminds me of !
I am surely back in Italy once more! beautiful, warm, fruitful
Italy ! Does the Passera solitaria feel the same delight, I wonder,
as he wings his way from his winter sojourn in Africa to the
mountains of Savoy? Could any life be more entirely enviable,
that spring and summer passed amongst the freshness of the
mountain air above the level of the chestnut groves and the
acacia trees, flitting from boulder to boulder, from ravine to
ravine, splashing in some clear pool of a mountain rivulet,
preening his feathers in the light of the morning sun, perched
upon some stone near which blossoms the edelweiss, and below
which stretch the roseate hues of bright masses of the Alpine
rhododendron filling the air with aromatic scent ? Such is the
life and environment of the Blue Thrush in his wild state.
When the Nightingales and the great host of migratory
birds are on their way to England, he too is leaving his winter
quarters in Africa for Southern Europe and parts of Asia. In
Palestine he may be found seated on a ruined temple, fluting
with his soft and melodious voice under the blue vault of heaven.
Passera that sitteth alone on the house-tops ! Solitaria !
But it is in Italy that I have made his acquaintance under
all sorts and conditions. It is in Italy that I have heard his
voice ringing in the still air as one wound one's way up some
mountain path and paused to recover one's breath. It is in Italy
that I have found his brood of young ones hidden in the cleft of
the rock, it is there that I have seen him caged, oh so miserably

too! caged in filth and grimy dirt, with unwashen perches, until
his poor, tender, slender feet were encrusted.
The rememberance of it recalls to me hot evenings after
hotter days in June, when one had to descend from mountain air
into an atmosphere laden with the balmy scent of cheese and oil
and drains! Italian drains ! oh! ! Can't you see the narrow
streets with the rough pavement and the cobble stones, over
which the carts are rattling and jolting? Can't you hear the
crack of the whip and the cries of the driver, the chatter-chatter
of the women and the men as they sit by the doorways of their
shops and gesticulate ? Whilst above it all there sounds a bird's
voice chanting in broken bars of melody. I am just passing
the old fruiterer's shop, Pietro Paufrauconi, and there under the
green outside shutters on the pink coloured plaster of the wall
hangs the rough wooden cage, in which a Blue Thrush is
imprisoned. I stop to look up at him and give him a friendly
whistle, which greeting is soon interrupted by old Pietro, who,
smelling of garlic, pot-bellied and blear-eyed, with a few old grey
bristles scattered over his bullet head (he is a "very imperfedt
ablutioner ") immediately puts in his "oar."
" Buouo sera, signore!" "Good evening," I answer, " is
your Passera for sale ? " "Si, si, signore," he says, and proceeds
to tell me that it is the best singer in Italy, truly a beautiful bird,
and yesterday he refused an American gentleman for it. This
is what one might call Pietro's " last; " but never mind ! In the
meanwhile, Francesca, whom I gather to be the daughter of
Pietro, is despatched upstairs to bring the bird down, and
Francesca accordingly appears in the little balcony a moment
afterwards, lifts the cage off the nail in the wall, and re-appears
below stairs. " Fcco ! ecco ! signore," says Pietro, " e proprio
unabella Passera; bella! bella /" Pietro, with all these praises of
the intense beauty of his Blue Thrush, must surely be referring
to the character of the bird, to some hidden charm, for outwardly^,
through no fault of the poor Passera himself, he is anything but
beautiful: his tail is a quarter of an inch long, and more to be
likened to a worn-out scrubbing brush than anything else, the
flight feathers being in much the same condition ; his feet are
heavy with dirt, and most of the feathers round his bill are
rubbed off; add to which, he is generally, like old Pietro, in sore
need of a tub !
After a good deal of bargaining, by the end of which
quite a small crowd has collected round us, I carry off the Blue
Thrush triumphantly, not, however, before Francesca has run

down to tlie shop in the market place, where bird cages are sold,
to fetch me a new one with clean glasses for food and water, for
I should blush to carry into my hotel, on the edge of the lake,
such a dirty old cage as Pietro's.
After all, my Passera cost me thirty francs instead of a
hundred ; for old Pietro soon found that I was not quite so
" green " as he had hoped for.
Having brought him home, I proceed, next morning, to
wash him: soaking his feet in warm water and removing the
encumbrances, which to the dainty feet of a bird must be as a
ploughman's boots to a lady. The water in the basin is of a
deep brown, and the bird himself looks like a drowned one, but
the air is soft and the sun is shining, so I hang his cage on my
balcony, covering the top with a sheet of brown paper, leaving
him one perch in the shade and one in the sun, and in an hour
he looks considerably better.
Birds are naturally cleanly, because they instinctively
obey the laws of nature, and cleanliness is not merely next to
but part of godliness ; so that my Passera shewed true joy when
he found himself amid cleanly surroundings and felt the fresh
water on liis feathers.
That was five years ago, and still he sits and sings, but
always now in perfect plumage, his lovely smart blue attracting
the attention of ever}&apos; visitor.
I have found Blue Thrushes quite hardy as indoor cage
birds, and possessing characters that are very attractive, singing
at any time of the night as long as the lamps or the candles are
lit, and knowing as w T ell as any dog a familiar or unfamiliar
form--for they are sometimes shy with strangers, and generally
almost terrified at ladies in large hats !
A lady said to me the other da} r , " What a dreadfully wild
bird that is of yours ! " I pointed out the fact that a bird
is naturally frightened at being suddenly confronted with a
colossal and nodding mass of ribbons, flowers, and perhaps
feathers ! (a few years ago it was a bunch of birds ! /) apparently
descending upon him. Why, if ladies' headgears frighten the
men, it is not to be wondered at if a Blue Thrush had a fit on
the spot.
And all the lady says is " Stupid bird! "
But you should see him when he is not frightened. Then
he will come to me, perch on my hand and fight me, singing all
the time and even speaking : for " Pretty boy " comes as easily
from his throat and as distinctly as from any talented Parrot's.

He is fed chiefly on Mr. Abrahams' mixture for insectivorous
birds, but he loves mealworms and small pieces of fresh raw
beef, with chopped up lettuce in the summer-time. He is always
strong and full of vigorous life, with a flight when out of his
cage as rapid and quick as any wild one, neither has he a feather
out of place.
The sketch I have done, though of course unworthy of
the original, is taken from life. Although of a deep slate blue
all over, his whole head, especially in the spring-time, is of a
much paler tint, which may be likened to china blue, and his
eyes are edged with a narrow yellow skin. He is about the size
of a Song Thrush, but his head and bill are longer and narrower.
I have successfully reared a brood of five of these birds in their
native country, and consider them easy to manage from the very
first. I shall never be without a Blue Thrush, if I can help
it, as long as I live.

Many years ago I used to be astonished at the ease and
certainty with which Mr. Joseph Abrahams selected the sexes
of birds, in which I could discover no difference of colour or
pattern ; and I invariably asked him by what characters he
decided the sex of an individual.
Mr. Abrahams, discovering that I was of an enquiring
turn of mind, never hesitated to give me the information which
I sought; merely stipulating that should I ever make any of his
secrets public, I should give him the credit of having imparted
them : this, in common honesty, I should certainly have done in
any case, for apart from the fact that credit should always be given
where it is due, the gain of the information which I acquired, by
rendering it at first possible and in course of time tolerably easy
to sex some of the most puzzling birds, has been considerable.
One of the most valuable features of the instruction
which I received from this experienced naturalist consisted in
his method of making me not only use my own e}^es to try and
discover differences for myself, but in asking me questions
tending to call out my powers of reasoning. Thus, the first
point to be settled was : If there is no difference in the plumage.

how does the male bird know its female ? How should we know
our partners if we were all dressed alike ?
Mr. Abrahams told me that this was the first question
which he asked himself, and he decided that the character of the
face was the one to study.
In most if not in all Finches there is a noticeable
difference in the form of the beak, which when one first looks at
it, seems to be trivial and unimportant; but which if magnified
to the size which would be required for birds of our stature,
would be incalculably more marked than any by which we
should decide the sexes of uniformly clothed human beings. It
is doubtless owing to the feminine character of face given to
many birds by the form of their beaks or bills, that the males
chiefly recognize them ; and it is by the same feature that with
constant practice (our eyes being thereby educated) we can
frequently, and without a shadow of doubt, select pairs for
breeding purposes. In proof of this statement I may just note
the fact that of the many pairs of Java Sparrows which I have
put up for breeding, both for myself and for others, I have never
yet made a mistake; that a pair of selected Red-crested Cardinals
commenced a flirtation as soon as I put them together in a
breeding-cage ; that Saffron-finches almost in the same plumage,
and many other species, have shown almost immediately that
they were correctly sexed. And yet I do not consider that my
training in this branch of sexual selection is by any means
perfect; I am still far behind my instructor, whilst even he is not
quite infallible though very nearly so.
As I consider that example is always better than precept, I
have carefully sketched the heads of the male and female of a
fully adult pair of Java Sparrows, as well as the beaks of two
other species--the Red-crested Cardinal in profile, and the
Parson-finch as seen from above.
As a rule the beaks of female finches are narrower,
more gradually pointed, and often (though by no means always)
longer than those of the male: this rule, however, is not
invariable, because the beak of a bird being its chief offensive
and defensive weapon as well as its substitute for a pair of
hands, has to be modified to serve divers purposes. I have,
however, found the general plan of development to be somewhat
as follows :--
i. Birds which build nests for their wives have broader
skulls, and consequently a broader base to the beak.

The reason is not far to seek, for breadth of skull means
more brain area and increased intelligence : also breadth of
skull gives a wider and, therefore, firmer base to the beak,
enabling its owner to inflict more powerful blows without
injury to itself.
Quite recently I discovered that the form of the beak,,
although the feature doubtless recognized by male birds, is not
the only one by which sexes may be distinguished ; inasmuch as
some birds, though I believe only those which pursue their
females, have a very distincft outline of wing, that of the male
being specially constructed for speed. This is certainly the case
both with the Ifinnets and Skylarks: and I am gradually having
my dead birds mounted w r ith a view to the study of this
character, which will, I think, prove more or less useful to
ornithologists. I had hoped that it would have enabled the
Pigeon-fancier to make himself happy, but I was only able to
examine seven birds, three cocks and four hens, and all that I
could find was a difference of about an inch in the length of the
inner secondaries; whether the males always have this greater
basal depth of wing I cannot say, but it would be worth looking
into.
With the slight differences of tint which sometimes dis-
tinguish the sexes of Finches, such as the buff tinting of the
underparts in the Magpie-Mannikin and the pink line at the
base of the upper mandible in the female Diamond Sparrow,
with similar small but infallible guides, the readers of my
"Foreign Finches in Captivity" will be familiar; but all these
species can be with certaint}^ recognized by outline of beak. The
females of very many species can be approximately guessed at
by their inferior size and slimmer or sometimes stouter build,
the typical Finches being usually stouter and the Grass-finclies
slimmer in outline.

Alario alario, Finn.
By H. R. Fiixmer.
In colouring the male bears a superficial resemblance tO&apos;
the Reed Bunting. The back and tail are a dark reddish brown
(the colour of a bay horse), the entire head and throat are black
and the black extends down on each side of the breast in the
shape of an inverted V. The under-surface of the body is
dirty white, and that colour extends upwards over the shoulders,
meeting at the back of the neck where it forms an exceedingly
narrow collar.
In the female the black on the head, throat, and sides
of the breast is absent, and the breast and abdomen are pale
brownish, with darker markings at the throat and breast. The
brown on the back is greyer and less brilliant than in the male.
Young males are very much like the old females, and
assume the black head gradually after a moult. But I have
possessed young males with black heads, which yet were not in
full plumage ; one of these moulted in my possession several
months after importation, and then assumed the full plumage of
the adult male ; when I first bought him he was quite unlike a
hen, and yet his colours were much less distinct and well defined
than they are in the adult cock. I inferred from this that the
male did not assume full plumage till after the second moult,
but when I bred this species I found this inference quite wrong,
for my aviary-bred cock came into full plumage alter the first
moult, and when only a few weeks old. Perhaps the shock
to the system caused by the change of climate delays the com-
pletion of the first moult in young imported birds, and causes
them to remain for months in an intermediate, half-moulted,
state of plumage, which they would naturally pass through in a
few days.
Athough very soberly attired, the Alario Finch is a pretty
bird ; but its chief attractions are not its beauty, but its very
sweet song and its great tameness.
The song is low and warbling, a little like that of the
Goldfinch. There are no loud or harsh notes, and while almost as
varied and musical as that of the Canary the song of the Alario
Finch is not sufficiently loud to irritate even the most sensitive
ear. The Alario Finch is not such a good singer as the Grey
Singing Finch, but still I claim for it a very high place as a
songster. A healthy cock bird will sing almost continuously.

Dike our European Siskin and Redpoll, the Alario Finch
seems to have scarcely any fear of man, and very little objection
to captivity--it is, therefore, an ideal cage or aviary bird. I
have seen a cage full of these birds in a dealer's shop, newly
arrived from Africa, and have noticed that instead of dashing
madly about when a hand was introduced into the cage, as most
other birds would have done, the Alario Finches contented
themselves with slipping quietly out of the way to avoid capture.
After a very short acquaintance with its master, the Alario
Finch becomes most engagingly tame, and of all foreign finches
it is the best adapted for a pet.
There seems to be no reason to suppose that this species is
otherwise than fairly common in South Africa, but it is imported
in very small numbers, and the importations generally consist of
cocks only. As it does not possess striking or gaudy colours it
commands neither a high price nor a ready sale, and is conse-
quently not much sought after by the dealers. Aviculturists of
experience, however, value it highly, for it is a bird which only
requires to be known in order to be appreciated at its true value.
I consider the Alario Finch to be one of the most charming of
foreign cage birds.
It is perfectly harmless in the aviary, but two males will
often quarrel and spar in the manner of Canaries.
The Alario Finch has frequently been crossed with the
Canary, both here and on the Continent, and the hybrid has
been exhibited more than once at the Crystal Palace. It seems
scarcely possible that the species should not have reproduced
itself in Europe until 1S96, but I can find no record of its
breeding either in England or Germany. Dr. Russ says distinctly,
" has not itself been bred."
In the autumn of 1S95 I succeeded in obtaining two
females from Mr. Swaysland : one of these was a young bird in
good plumage and perfect health, which I placed in an aviary
with a male which had been in my possession for some time.
The male sang to the hen, but she never attempted to build.
The other female was considered by Mr. Swaysland to be a bird
which had recently nested in a state of freedom--he came to
this conclusion from the state of her plumage. This bird was
in very shabby condition, and, instead of improving after I
purchased her, she went from bad to worse, until she was almost
bare of feathers and I feared that she suffered from some
feather desease. However, about May she moulted, and came
into splendid plumage. Shortly after this I obtained from

Mr. G. C. Swailes, in exchange for another bird, a remark-
ably vigorous male Alario Finch, which I placed with this
hen, in a good-sized indoor aviary all to themselves, and almost
immediately had the pleasure of seeing her begin building.
The nest was built in an open Canary nest-box with a perforated
zinc bottom, which I had hung up high on the wall at the
back of the aviary. The nest was a beautiful little structure
of hay, neatly lined with hair from a common Canary nest-bag.
I never saw the eggs, but I believe that only two were laid; for
two young were hatched, and no eggs were left in the nest when
I examined it after the young had flown.
The hen began to sit on the 7th of July, and hatched on
the 19th or 20th. The young left the nest on the morning of
the 2nd of August, when to my great surprise I found them at
the bottom of the aviary. They could not fly for several days
after. While the young were in the nest the parents partook
of hard-boiled egg and biscuit, and Abrahams' preserved egg,
but afterwards very little, if any, egg was eaten, and I think the
young were mainly reared on crushed hempseed and green food.
Considerable quantities of chickweed and lettuce were con-
sumed, but not very much of anything else. Both old and
3 r oung birds now live on canary seed and German rape seed (of
which they eat about equal quantities) and a small daily treat of
hempseed, and, of course, green food.
The young birds were much like their mother, but greyer
and more speckled. One turned out to be a cock and the other
a hen. I thought for a few days that the mother would have
laid a second time, as she became rather busy with nesting
material; but colder weather set in, and all inclination to nest
passed away.
I consider the Alario Finch to be a somewhat delicate
bird, and I at first found much difficulty in keeping it in health
for any length of time. My Alario Finches went into a sort of
decline, and after death I found their bodies extremely thin. I
used then to keep them in an aviary with Waxbills and other
birds where they had canary seed, white millet, and so-called
Indian millet, with occasionally some egg. I do not think this
diet was sufficiently nourishing, and I have found these birds to
keep in health much longer upon canary and rape, with some
hemp. If they have access to millet seed they will often become
very fond of it and eat it in preference to the other seeds which
are more wholesome for them. I do not think that this is a
mere fad of mine, and I would strongly recommend all who

no
wish to keep their Alario Finches in health to studiously avoid
giving them millet seed.
The Alario Finch is a native of South Africa, from Cape
Town northwards to Damara Land and eastwards to Port
Elizabeth.

Fringilla montifringilla , Finn.

This bird is, with the exception of the Chaffinch, the only
species of the genus Fringilla, which visits our shores. It is a
tolerably common winter migrant to Scotland and the greater
part of England, its numbers varying greatly from year to year.
Its summer quarters extend from the south of Norway as far
north as it can find suitable trees or bushes on which to breed,
extending eastwards into Siberia.
The sexes differ in plumage. In summer the head, cheeks,,
nape and back of the male are of a deep steel blue ; the upper
wing-coverts, throat and breast vary in colour from a brown
red to a light buff; greater wing-coverts black with two faint
white lines, tail and quills black ; under parts and rump white, the
flanks being spotted with black. The female resembles the male
but is much duller, and in summer the back and head are
speckled with dark brown. The young resemble the female. In
winter all the feathers have broad buff edgings which are worn
off as spring advances, and the bill, which in summer becomes
black, is yellow with a dark tip.
On two points of its colouration, the Brambling shows
clearly the principals of evolution. When it first began to
separate from the Chaffinch, or a bird similar to the Chaffinch,,
probably rather resembling the female, it was necessary for it to
start some means whereby it might easily recognise itself, in
order to prevent its interbreeding with the parent form. From
this arose the white rump ; or what amounts to the same thing,
possibly a few sports with a white rump were produced, which
recognising each other by this mark bred together and so started
the species.
It became at the same time necessary to do away with the
cross-bars on the wings, which would tend to cause unions with
the parent stock and prevent the formation of the race. Conse-
quently, these cross-bars wxmld diminish in size and become of
a less conspicuous colour till they were no longer sufficiently
visible to lead to false unions ; then natural selection would

cease to adt and they would remain as ornaments such, as we find
them at the present day. We may also infer that the Brambling
is the newer form since there is a tendency, though it be but a
slight one, for the rump to become spotted with black, whereas
the rump of the Chaffinch never shows any tendency to revert
to a white form ; nor do we find a single other case of a white
rump in any other species of the genus.
Although rather apart from the present article, it may be
noticed that in no part of the world, except Kurope and the
Canary Isles, do two species of this genus come in contadt.
In the Canary Islands there are two species, F. ca?iariensis
and F. teydea ,* of which the latter loses the cross-bars by
suffusing them with blue, whereas in all the other species they
are white as in the Chaffinch.
ffike all finches the Brambling is a late breeder, the nest
being seldom begun before the middle of June. The nest is
placed, as a rule, about ten feet from the ground (where the trees
are sufficiently high to allow it) at the junction of a branch with
a main trunk ; although it may occasionally be placed low
down on a juniper bush.
It is composed of bents and grass with occasionally some
lichen and a little moss closely interwoven, and although bulkier
than that of the Chaffinch is remarkably well finished off. It is
lined with hair, feathers, and perhaps some willow down. The
eggs greatly resemble those of the Chaffinch, but as a rule the
spots are more confined to the larger end and not so much
blurred.
It is said to have bred in Scotland on one occasion, but
the occurrence is rather doubtful. The call note, which is
frequently uttered, consists of a harsh chirp, and although the
male is said to have a song of a few flute-like notes, I have never
had the pleasure of hearing it either wild or in captivity. When
near a wood in which they are breeding, one hears incessantly
the long-drawn ' tweeee,' f occasionally varied by the ' weeeech '
so frequently heard during the winter. The former is in my
opinion the summer call, and the latter the note of alarm or
anger. The birds, until the young are out of the nest, are seldom
seen. It is said to have bred in captivity on several occasions.
As a cage bird it has little but its beauty to recommend it; it

becomes beautifully tame and utters its call-note with aggravat-
ing frequency. In an aviary it is one of the most delightful of
birds and always keeps itself in first-rate condition. I have never
found it to be very pugnacious, although on that score it has a
bad reputation.
In this country it is very fond of beech-mast, and ma) r be
found in huge flocks where such food is plentiful. In captivity
it is long-lived and hardy, thriving well on the ordinary seeds
without any additional dainties.
A WALK IN THE "JARDIN D'ACCLIMATATION "
OF PARIS.
By O. Ernest Cresswerl.
(Continued from page 48J .
Opposite to the fine range of aviaries which I attempted
to describe in my last paper, is the Doves' house ; I do not mean
a dovecote in the common sense of the term, but a house chiefly
devoted to foreign Doves. The tribe are special favourites of
my own, and so it is that I always visit this house with very
mixed feelings, for it is singularly ill-adapted to its purpose--at
least to the purpose of housing these sweet exotic races in
anything approaching to comfort. For the mere exhibition of
the birds, as in a show or dealer's shop, it is fairly well
suited; but I do not conceive this to be the chief objeCt of an
acclimatization Society. A number of Doves, chiefly of the
smaller races, are usually on view, but every time I go to the
gardens I find, apparently, a fresh stock. The house is somewhat
ornamented, many-sided, and well roofed, but too much shaded
by trees. The pens (for this is, I think, the most appropriate
term for them) are in two stories ; the upper ones are entirely
roofed over, boarded at the back and sides, and wired in front,
not unlike show-cages. They are furnished with perches, but
with no nooks for retreat, or real shelter from wind ; and some
of them are never reached by the sun.
These are the abodes of the foreign Doves--natives, for
the most part, of tropical Africa and the islands of the Indian
seas--I have before found them well filled with the smaller and
more attractive of the not very rare species : I cannot say always
accurately named, for in 1893, a cage full of the little Brazilian
Chceitiepelia picui , so distinctly barred on the shoulder with steel
blue, was labelled Chalcopelia afra , the little African Dove to
which Eevaillant gave the inappropriate name of Emerald. Last

Autumn there was little of great interest in the cages; in one, a
pair of the Turtur picturatus of Madagascar, which I do not
remember to have seen before ; in another, a pair labelled
Zendida aurita, colombe a oreillon bleu, the French call them,
though I could not discover a trace of blue about their heads :
nor can I in the beautiful illustrations of the bird in Temminck's
great folio volume, a copy of which I possess. In the next cage
were a few poor little Diamond Doves, already looking chilled
and wretched, which they should not have done, for I have
wintered them out of doors, though in an aviary open to every
ray of the sun. Then came some Blood - breasted Pigeons
fPhlogcenas cruentata) which I have always thought a most
fascinating variet}^ with their general plumage of subdued
shades of greyish-blue and purple, and their breast pure white
splashed with a large blood-coloured spot, like a dagger-wound.
Their French name Colombe poignardee, is very apposite. Fast, a
single little Australian Crested Dove ( Geophapsplumifero )--these
are charming little creatures, much smaller than the well-known
Australian Crested Marsh Doves ( Ocyphaps lophotes) and very
different in their habits. Their plumage is of various shades of
yellowish-brown ; there is an excellent picture of one in Sturt's
volume of travels about 50 years ago, into the interior of
Australia. They are veritably ground Doves, run like Quails,
and always remind me of Plovers in their action. Unfortunately
they rarely come into the hands of English dealers, but I have
seen them at Antwerp and in other foreign collections; and only
last summer I saw one incubating on the ground in the Western
Aviaries of the Regent's Park.
The under apartments of this house have little runs
covered over with netting to the height of two or three feet ;
their usual tenants are Quails and Tinnamous--I once found
several Sun-bitterns in one, of all birds imaginable for such a
prison ! It was sad to see these lovely creatures peuued to the
ground, the bright rainbow hues of whose wings are only visible
in flight. I would advise any aviculturist who has not seen
one on the wing, to get the courteous keeper of the aforesaid
Western aviaries of the Zoo to show off the Sun - bitterns.
Where so man)^ arrangements are good it is sad to see tender
and elegant races so ill-housed, and I hope that the next
improvement may be commodious abodes for the Doves, in
which they may nest, as so many of them are ready to do in
captivity.
From here two or three winding paths bring one to the
ponds, alive with an infinite variety of Ducks and Geese. In
</bodyText>

every enclosure there are plenty of sheltering reeds and shrubs,
and grassy banks for the birds to walk about or sun themselves
on. The great charm of these ponds is the multitude of
specimens of many kinds that one sees, all looking happy and
all as if in their native haunts. Close by is the Pigeon Tower--
a really wonderful brick eredtion of several stories--for domestic
Pigeons.
Bearing back from the ponds, towards the entrance
gates, on the right side we soon come to perhaps the most
interesting of all the houses, the new great hall, or rather series
of halls, devoted to the Parrot tribe and to various other birds
which require heat. In the autumn of 1893, I found this great
structure already partially tenanted, but still unfinished and too^
redolent of wet mortar. In 1896, I found it finished and
garnished, and the various halls appropriately warmed for their
occupants. I wish many of the birds could be less closely con-
fined, but of course it is very difficult, next to impossible, to
show such a number of races, save in some way caged. The
first hall, like the rest of them, is entered through glazed doors ;
it is airy and spacious ; on the right side is a handsome enclosure
for exotic water-birds. The water is evidently kept at a suitable
temperature, and in and around it are rocks for resting-places
the most striking of its tenants was a Roseate Mexican Flamingo,
in lovely plumage and condition, which was taking its bath with
evident pleasure. I do not ever remember to have seen water-
birds from warm climes housed in such perfedt comfort. I fancy
there is an arrangement by which in summer they can be let out
into an outside enclosure. From this hall, a few steps lead up to
the next, kept at a higher temperature ; it, too, is lofty and airy,
but less spacious than the entrance hall. On the right side are
ranged a row of fine cages in which birds of some size can take
exercise. I specially observed some handsome Green Touracous,
always so adtive, comic, and attractive in their ways. On the left
side are many tiers of cages, varying in size and chiefly tenanted
by small birds--lots of the Waxbill tribe and other well-known
pets. Several Tanagers--Crimson, Superb, and others--looked
at home and happy : certainly in the feathered creation there is
little more exquisite than the Tanager family, and sorely tempt-
ing it is to see them offered now-a-days at such moderate prices ;.
but I have never yet given way to the temptation, for I fancy,
save the Crimson, they require much warmth and much care
in the preparation of the substitutes for their native fruity
and insedt diet. The cage, of all others, which pleased me in
this house, was one full of what the French call Diamants a ailes

rouges- --our Aurora Finches ( Pytelia phcenicoptera) from West
Africa, so sleek in condition and full of life and activity, with
their fire-coloured rumps and patches on the wing. Hence,,
another door leads into the lofty Central Parrot Hall.
This Parrot hall is far more lofty and airy than the Parrot
house of our own Zoo, though this does not necessarily say very
much for it. A gallery tenanted by Macaws, and apparently not
open to the public, runs round it. In the centre are some
artificial metal trees, not, perhaps, in the best of taste, which
serve the purpose of stands for more Macaws, all of well-known
species. The rows of cages ranged round are just of the
common square shape, in size far too prison-like for some of
the birds. The collection of Amazons is large and good ;
among them, specially handsome, is a Diademed Amazon, and
a rather small Crimson-fronted species ( Chrysotis pretii) much
took my fancy, I do not ever remember to have seen one before;
the band of crimson over the beak is very vivid, as is a fine blue
patch on the wings. Several of the smaller Parrakeets are well
represented--a pair of the engaging little Brotogerys Tuipara,
a single Multicolor in lovely condition, a Blue-bonnet, and a
Nanday. The gems of the collection are a Palceornis colmnboides
of wondrous hues, and, above all, a Queen of Bavaria Parrakeet
(i Conurus luteus) --I had never seen one alive, and from pictures
and even from stuffed specimens had gathered that the general
tint of the plumage was light canary--the reality far exceeded
my visions of it. The general body-colour is of the most
splendid amber, and it seems as if one looks through the rather
downy plumage to richer depths of amber below. The green,
too, of the primary and secondary- wing feathers is vivid bey^ond
description. The figure of the bird is not very elegant, but of
this one cannot judge fairly in a cage, deplorably cramped for
so lovely^ an inmate. Surely it should have an aviary to itself 1
I have no idea if there are in Europe any proud private
possessors of a specimen of this glorious Conure.
The Parrot house concluded my walk, but I should not
fail to direct the visitor to the Musee (I think they call it so)
directly opposite, i.e ., on the right as one enters the Gardens.
It is simply^ a large bazaar where appliances of all kinds for
Poultry-, Pheasants, and cage birds are on view. Every article is
ticketed with its price, and is on sale. It is convenient to look
over the devices of many makers without being invited to buy
them ! Parisian cages are certainly very light, elegant, and
temptingly cheap, and their cane perches look more natural and
comfortable for the feet than the English regulation perch, but

when one examines the detail of their workmanship one cannot
fancy that they are either durable or easily kept clean.
I fear I have trespassed too largely on the space of our
Magazine in the hope of encouraging other aviculturists to
spend a few hours as pleasantly as I have often done at the
Jardin d'Acclimatation.

(For thu Children).
By the Rev. J. E. Kuusaul.
Once upon a time, not long after the war between the Beasts
and the Birds, there were three naughty cock Sparrows who would
not choose their wives when all the other birds did on St.
Valentine's Day. The first one said " I shall not marry one of my
cousins the hen Sparrows, because they cannot fly well enough.
I want a wife who can fly for hours without stopping."
And so he married a Swallow, and their children are the
little brown birds that sit on the palings and catch flies in the air.
You can tell that their father was a Sparrow, because they are
brown all over, and because they like to live near houses. And } r ou
can tell that their mother was a Swallow, because they chase the
fliesin the air, and because they are too delicate to stay here in the
winter, and always fly away with the Swallows to a warmer country
in the autumn. The books call them Spotted Flycatchers, but
country people call them Beam-birds, because they make their
nests on the beam.
And the second cock Sparrow was as naughty as the first
and he said " I shall not marry one of my cousins the hen
Sparrows, because they cannot sing well enough. I want a wife
who can sing."
Aud so he married a Skylark. And their children are those
stupid brown birds that sit on the top of the hedge aud try to
sing, but only make a noise like this :--"Zick, zick, zick, teriddle,
iddle, iddle. " You can tell that their father was a Sparrow
because they are brown all over and because they have thick bills.
And you can tell that their mother was a Dark, because they live
out in the fields and build their nests on the ground. The books
call them Corn Buntings, but the country people call them
Bunt Darks.
And the third cock Sparrow was as naughty as the second,
and he said " I shall not marry one of my cousins the hen

Sparrows, because they are so ugly. I want a wife who wears
bright feathers."
And so he married a Goldfinch, the bird of seven colours.
And their children are the fat green birds that will come in front
of your window with the Sparrows if you throw out some hemp
seed. You can tell that their father was a Sparrow, because they
have thick beaks, and are greedy and fight over their food, and
they look almost the colour of a Sparrow until they spread their
wings and tail. But when they spread their wings you can tell
that their mother was a Goldfinch, for they show beautiful golden
feathers in their wings and tail. And so the books call them
Greenfinches, but the five real Finches say they are only green
Sparrows.
The five real Finches are the Hawfinch, the king of the
Finches, and the Bullfinch, and the Goldfinch, the bird of seven
colours, and the Chaffinch, who belongs to the Band of Hope
(but that is another story), and the Bramble-finch, who lives in
Norway and only comes to England in the winter.
So nobody knows what to call the greedy green birds..
Country people call them Green Linnets, though they are not a
bit like the pretty Rose Linnet that lives in the furze bush. And
poor people in London call them just Green-birds, which is-
rather rude.
This is only an old wife's tale, but perhaps it will help you
to know those three poor dull birds when you meet them, the
Spotted Flycatcher, the Corn Bunting, and the Greenfinch.

AVICULTURAL SMALL-TALK.

Some people have the mistaken impression that "aviculture" and
"aviculturist " are merely newer and finer names for "fancy" and
" fancier." Aviculturists should do all in their power to explode this
fallacy. The truth is that aviculture and " the fancy" are as far asunder as
the poles, and must ever remain irreconcilable. Aviculture is the practical
application of the science of ornithology, and has for its province the
acclimatization and breeding of imported species and the study of the habits
of all species, both British and foreign, especially in a state more or less
under the dominion of man. The aim of the " fancy " is the breeding and
exhibiting of specimens which shall as closel}&apos; as possible conform to some
ideal artificial type. We do not suggest that these definitions exhaust the
purposes of either aviculture or " the fancy," but we believe that they
suffice to point out the main objects of each. The breeder of j-ellow
Budgerigars, and white Java Sparrows and Bengalese, is a "fancier," but
those who devote themselves only to the culture of natural forms of either
British or foreign birds are not " fanciers," even though they may be
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.995190804347826" page_id="32635163"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
\0x25A0exhibitors. Strictly speaking then, there is no such thing as a " fancier "
of British or foreign birds, for, with a few unimportant exceptions, those
birds are not bred for " fancy " points.
On the other hand, it is well to bear in mind that although aviculture
is a branch of ornithology, and an important branch, it is not identical
with ornithology; for classification, structure, and the habits of wild birds,
are not strictly within the province of aviculture. The aviculturist is always,
in some sense, an ornithologist, but the ornithologist is not necessarily
an aviculturist. Aviculture is the part and ornithology is the whole.
Unfortunately most ornithologists, in the past, have been ignorant of the
avicultural branch of their own science, but now there is good prospect of a
\0x25A0change for the better in this respect, and one of the most important objects
of the Avicultural Society is to assist in bringing about this change. It is
\0x25A0equally unfortunate that so many aviculturists are ignorant of all branches
of ornithology but their own, and this again is an evil which our Society
hopes to help in remedying.
The ignorance of some of the gentlemen who pose as judges is really
plienominal. After a recent Show an exhibitor enquired of one of these
learned persons why his pair of fine Saffron Finches had been entirely
ignored. " Oh," says the judge, " they&apos; are not a pair. That," pointing to
the female, ''is not the hen of that," pointing to the cock. "They are two
different sorts of birds." In this case the female was immature, and
therefore presented a greater contrast to the male than an adult bird would
have done. If the exhibitor had shown two cocks together he would
doubtless, under this judge, have been a prize winner.
CORRESPONDENCE.
THE TUI.
Sir, --I tried, time after time, to keep the Tui Tui or Poe or Parson-bird
in my aviary, but they invariably died very soon in a fit. The birds were
then rather dear, costing about #3 each, and I was determined- to succeed
if possible, but did not, though I tried every kind of food I then thought
suitable. Food on which Thrushes and Glossy Starlings did wonderfully
well meant death to the Tuis. Unfortunately I did not then think of
condensed milk : had I done so, there would have been a good chance, I
believe, of keeping alive one of the five or six Tuis which I had at
various times. When too late, I have often remembered the advice of a
very experienced bird dealer : avoid any too rich food if you want to keep
this pretty bird alive, and feed him on boiled mealy potatoes. I disregarded
this well-meant advice, because I thought mealy boiled potatoes could not
possibly contain sufficient nutriment for any bird. If I had occasion to try
again, I would offer the Tui as food a mixture of slightly&apos; diluted condensed
milk and sponge cake and half of a mealy boiled potato. I should almost
be inclined to mix the potato with the condensed milk after a while and to
withdraw the sponge cake gradually. I found the Tui very fond of meal-
worms, but this rich food is practically a slow poison for them.

THE SEX OF PARROT FINCHES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990276583333333" page_id="32635164"  page_num="119" year="" vol="">
Sir, --As regards determining the sex of Parrot Finches, I may
perhaps be allowed to add a few words to the discussion of the subject. I
believe I had the first pair ever imported. When I made a chance purchase
of three Parrot Finches about 20 years ago, I made, what I believed, were
*exhaustive enquiries and found that only one bird of the species had until
then been seen in Europe, and had found its wa}^ to thejardin d'Acclimata-
tion in Paris. My three birds were at first sight exactly alike, and it required
a rather close examination to find a material difference in the size of the red
mask. One of the three was blind in one eye and otherwise damaged and
soon eliminated, but luck would have it that the remaining two were a pair,
for the}&apos; soon bred successfully, and in course of time I bred from their,
progeny. I do not know whether other amateurs have succeeded since in
breeding this very beautiful and most amiable bird. It seems to me to be
*comparatively easy to do so. I have no doubt that the only difference in
the plumage of the male and female is, that the red face of the female will
he found, on close examination, sensibly smaller than the male's.
The age of the birds must also be considered. When leaving the nest
the young birds were green all over and the red onl}&apos; appeared after their
\0x25A0second moult and seemed to me to grow larger as the breeding season
arrived. When the birds were in full plumage and in full health and
basking in the sun, their green plumage had a slight tinge of a golden
\0x25A0sheen.
I should place the Parrot Finches in the foremost rank of those
foreign finches which are likely to repay close attention by amateurs.

SOME BRAZILIAN BIRDS.
Sir, -- It may interest some of the readers of the Avicultural Magazine
to hear that the Brazilian Hangnest is called in his native country
" Bem-ti-vi." This pretty, lively bird is seen very frequently in the gardens
near Rio de Janeiro flying towards evening, from tree to tree, perching 011
the highest branches and calling something which sounds very much like
Bem-ti-vi, which, translated from Portugese into English, means " I see you
well."
The Saffron Finch is there seen as often by the road-side, perching 011
hedges as the Chaffinch does here. To breed this bird in the cage would be
almost as easy as breeding our common Canaries, provided it is borne in
mind that his breeding season coincides with our winter; we don't keep him
in an absolutely cold room, and we supply artificial light enough to feed his
brood during the long winter evenings and before the sun rises at Christmas.
It would be amusing for many amateurs to breed something during the
winter. I fancy that to rear his young the Saffron Finch will require a trifle
more animal food than the Canary, a little more egg, an odd mealworm at
times, or a few good ant's-eggs.
The pretty Green Cardinal, too, breeds more readily in the cage than
his gaudier Red-lieaded cousins. I found mine not very particular as to
seasons, but that may have been individual. But their broods were never
numerous at any time. My Green Cardinals always proved harmless to
other birds, whilst the Red-headed Cardinals were tyrants and murderers

when in the aviary with other birds. However, during the breeding time
the temper of no bird or animal is quite reliable; separation of species,
and isolation of pairs, is always the safest and saves much annoyance and
disappointment. Aug. F. Wiener.

DACN1S CA YANA,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9956264" page_id="32635165"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
Sir, --As my hen Dacnis cayana has been so much talked about,
perhaps Mr. Setli-Smith will permit me to put him right in his criticism.
Several exhibitors told me at the Palace that, although they had
never kept a hen of the species, yet the cock was not exceptionally rare.
These exhibitors had all fallen into the same error as Mr. Seth-Smith. The
" Yellow-winged Sugar-bird," the male of which is now at the Zoological
Gardens, is Cuereba cyatiea as stated. The Dacnis caya?ia, however, is quite a
different bird. The former has a curved beak, long for the size of the bird,
and has brilliant red legs; the hen is much more sober in colour than the
Dacnis cayana. The latter is a much larger bird, with a very differently
shaped beak. I doubt if, with the exception of my own specimen, either
male or female of the Dacnis cayana has ever been imported alive into
England.
Anyway, my bird is certainly not Coereba cyanea as suggested by Mr.
Seth-Smith. Henry J. Fueejames.

<bodyText confidence="0.995636814814815" page_id="32635165"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Your critic, Mr. T. Marshall, " does not understand old scaly-
legged Thrushes beating young clean-legged birds, other things being equal,
except mere size." He further writes, " The third prize went to an
erstwhile inmate of my own bird-room, whose show days I considered over
whenl presented him to his present owner, nearly twelve months ago." Mr.
Marshall did very kindly present this very bird to me, he knew I was
anxious to have him ; about six months before he gave him to me, I offered,
I think, 15/- for him, but he declined, as the bird was given to him. Now
I think Mr. Marshall has been very harsh in his criticism upon this grand
old bird "Temple Terror." If the young birds are to win all the prize-
monev because of their clean legs, the old birds would probably suffer, as
their owners would not think it worth while to bestow much attention upon
them. Then again, if smooth legs were so essential to the birds winning a
prize, some owners might be tempted to tamper with the birds' legs, and
cause the birds pain. I for one should be very sorry to see any more
cruelties practiced on birds, there are too many already; what with
flighting voting Canaries, cutting cockerels' combs, compulsory pepper-
feeding, &amp;c., make some of us shudder and wonder what diabolical
practice will next be introduced. These things, Sir, I think should be
strongly denounced through the medium of the Avicultural Magazine,
and if such cruel practices were abolished, shows, I am sure, would be
far more popular.
With regard to the food given to the birds in the classes Mr. Marshall
criticised, I can only say that my birds were extremely low in health when
they came back from the show, which coincides with his remarks that the
birds were disgracefully fed with improper food.

To describe the occupants of one's bird-room is b} r no
means an easy matter. In the endeavour to avoid giving a
mere catalogue of names, the writer is liable to go to the opposite
extreme, and furnish minute details of the domestic concerns of
common birds, which, however much they may interest their
owner, will not be attractive to aviculturists in general, who are
quite capable of making such observations for themselves. In
order to avoid the accusation of committing either of these
offences, I may say at once that the real object of what follows
is to show that with very few exceptions all the small seed-eating
birds usually imported can be kept flying loose together in a
room which, though of a fair size, by no means answers to Dr.
Russ' palatial requirements. Among these exceptions I include,
of course, all Parrakeets, Weavers (as a class), and Java Sparrows.
As regards many small seed-eaters, the recognised authorities on
ornithology have propagated such alarmist ideas as to the
combative habits of many kinds that my bird-room was for a
long time lacking in species that, when introduced, proved them-
selves to be absolutely harmless. The mere fadt of three
hundred birds living together without seriously quarrelling--
much less murdering one another, speaks volumes for their
amiability. Of course, the arrangements of the bird-room have
* A melancholy interest attaches to this the only contribution to the
Avicultural Magazine from Mr. Allou's pen, in consequence of his death
shortly after correcting the proof. Mr. Allou, though personally known to
very few of the members of the Society, was a true ornithologist, and
possessed a rare knowledge of the scarcer foreign finches. His death is a
severe loss to the Society, none the less real because most of the members
were unaware of the extent of his knowledge. Some few months ago he
sent us a long list of articles which he proposed to write for the Magazine,
and it is sad to think that this, the first of them, must also be the last.--E d.

something to do with this, but of these it is impossible to speak
now.
First among treacherous birds I should place the Rock
Sparrows ( Petronia ) which, though fascinating when caged (JP.
fiavicollis is a charming singer) are simply murderous ruffians
among other small birds. Then there is the Australian Fire-
finch. I have had six pairs, but never one in which the cock
did not attempt wife-murder. My present pair have to be
caged separately. The cock's power to do evil does not equal
his will, otherwise he would have slaughtered a Crimson-crowned
Weaver, who fled for his life before him! Mr. Abrahams says
that the above has been his invariable experience with these
birds ; and he has had many hundreds of pairs. Fastly, there
are, I regret to say, Parson Finches. I have had comparatively
few of these birds, as they never seem to ail anything; but I
have caught them stealing eggs, pulling nestlings on to the
floor, and hanging Waxbills up by the leg. Therefore, they are
imprisoned for life. All the undermentioned birds, however,
fly loose.
To begin with Grosbeaks. I have, at present, pairs of the
Blue Grosbeak (Guiraca cyaned) and of the smaller and brighter
Gtiiraca parellina. What the bird thus named in the Zoological
Gardens is, I will not venture to say positively : but it certainly
is not a Grosbeak. These birds, as well as other species I have
had formerly, look very strong, but their undue zeal for meal-
worms is often fatal to them. Another of their weaknesses is a
pomegranate, which they clean out almost as quickly as a
Tanager would.
Of the Spermophihz, I have the White-throated, Bluish,
Plumbeous, Reddish, Guttural and Fined Finches. Has it ever
been pointed out in how many respects the last named differs
from his relations ? He shows considerable affedtion for his hen,
he lets his nails grow like a Mannikin, and worst of all, he is
distinctly delicate, dying generally from some form of paralysis.
The Spermopliilce hens, in general, build their nests alone,
preferably of cotton wool. This is the only drawback to success
in breeding, as the nest is so flimsy that hen and eggs sooner
or later make an ignominious descent to the floor. All my hens
lay, and I have never known one egg-bound.
Of Jacarini Finches, I have two cocks (one of the Central
American variety, without the white quill lining, which is such a
distinctive feature of this bird) and one hen. The hen I have
never seen elsewhere, but she is a most uninteresting looking

bird, much like a hen Combasou. As to the question of insect
food, my experience is that the Spermophihz when first imported,
and the Jacarinis always, are very eager after it.
A pair of Cuba Finches, though in fine condition and
eager to nest, have unfortunately fixed their affedtions on a tree
sacred to the Aurora Finches and their young, and consequently
have never got on far with their own arrangements.
Of True Finches I have two pairs of Trumpeter Desert
Finches, some Black-headed Siskin cocks (I have never seen a
hen), and a Mexican Siskin ( Chrysomitris inexicanus ) a delightful
little bird in everj^ way, whose rather thin but not unpleasant
little song is to be heard all day. There are also a hen Scarlet-
rose Finch ( Carpodacus erythrinus), an Alario, and various African
Sparrows. Of these the most interesting and the prettiest are two
Golden Sparrows {Passer luteus&apos;) whose one drawback is that they
will take their dust baths in a seed trough. Swainson's Sparrow
is a somewhat larger bird, prettily coloured, but so terribly shy
that one gets suspicious of his amiability. It is generally these
apparently nervous birds who commit murderous assaults in
dark corners. He is the only Sparrow I have that refuses insedt
food.
With the exception of Serinus flaviventris, I have, I believe,
all the Serins commonly imported, from the Serin Finch and the
Wild Canary (which ftying in the bird-room is indistinguishable
from the Cape Canary) to the Sulphureous Seed-eater. None of
these birds fight, save the cocks of the Grey Singing Finch pairs
with whom baldness seems to be a necessary preliminar)^ to
breeding--and they have bred several times with me. On the
other hand, the reputedly timid Pileated Finch (especially the
hen) I have found distinctly aggressive, while the Sycalis tribe
always behave themselves admirably. Saffron Finches seem to
frighten rather than hurt the smaller birds. My pair I have had
for years, and they have done no damage at all. There are also
Sycalis arvensis , and a hen of Sycalis -pelzelni, a bird which
puzzled me extreme^ until Mr. Abrahams came to the rescue
and ' spotted' it at once. The cock must be a handsome bird.
A pair of Citril Finches {Chrysomitris citrinella&apos;) may also
be mentioned, though thej^ should more properly be included
under the Siskins. They are seldom imported, but are neither
particularly ornamental nor interesting.
I have two pairs of Diuca Finches, which can be cordially
recommended as strong, adtive, good-natured and striking look-
ing birds. Their song, however, is as much a myth as that of

<bodyText confidence="0.998194139534884" page_id="32635169"  page_num="124" year="" vol="">
the Cuba Finch. It is rather like that of the Chingolo Song-
sparrow--noisy, but not remarkably pleasant. They have the
funniest love dance I ever saw in a small bird.
As to Buntings, I have several Red-backed Buntings
(.Emberiza nitila), Brown-headed Buntings ( E . luteola) Ortolans,
and, of course, Nonpareils and Indigos--also the rare little Seven-
streaked Bunting (.Fringillaria semptemshiald) from N.E. Africa.
As to the so-called ' natural antipathy' of Nonpareils and Indigos,
I must confess myself sceptical. Having kept several pairs of
each species together for a considerable time I have found no
trace of it apparent--on the contrary they usually perch upon
the same tree.
To run rapidly through my Weaving Finches, of the
Whydahs, the smaller species only are possible in a bird-room.
But I have the Broken-collared Whydah, which the Frencli
dealers call the ' Veuve de Madagascar.' The bird is obviously
different in many respedts from the ordinary Paradise Whydah
when in colour, but the English authorities do not appear to
distinguish it. One or two Rufous-backed Mannikins and Dwarf
Finches, and several pairs of Pied Grass Finches are all that are
worth mentioning among the Spermestes.
The African Fire Finches (Lagonosticta) are heart-break-
ing birds. The two ordinary species (A. senegala and A. minima)
are difficult enough to keep in health--at any rate the cocks are.
But with the exception of the Brown-headed Fire Finch (A.
brunneiceps ), and the Masked Fire Finch (A. larvata and A.
vinacea), I have never been able to keep any other species for
more than a couple of months. The survivor of a pair invariably
follows his or her partner in a couple of days. In most cases
the mischief is done before they arrive. Eavender Finches have
in comparison the constitutions of giants. I had a Grey-tailed
Eavender Finch (A. incana ) sent me lately with some of the
ordinary species, but it died the second day.
Of Red-headed Finches (Amadina erythroccphala) I have
only cocks. The constant egg-binding of the hens, and the
difficulty of replacing them, has led me to substitute hen Cut-
throats which please the cocks equally well. The egg-binding
continues, but the expense is less.
My experience of Diamond Sparrows is that they are
harmless--nay, positively benevolent in disposition. My pairs
sit together all day in a large open nesting-box, buttressed up
all round by rows of Waxbills, who evidently have a great
respect and affection for them. Another wickedly maligned bird

125
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.995872" page_id="32635170"  page_num="125" year="" vol="">
is the Aurora Finch. This is my favourite bird and I always
keep four or five pairs at least. Confiding, good-natured, and
never ill when once acclimatized, I know no species that nests
so readity, so successfully, and with such unfailing regularity.
The pairs generally use cocoa-nuts or nesting-boxes, placed
side by side, and they are absolutely fearless. I have known a
ben continue sitting while the top of the nesting box was being
scraped. And these are birds that we have been told are unsuit-
able for a bird-room ! The Crimson-faced Waxbill (. Pytelia melba)
is far other in disposition. I should call it spiteful, were
it not so lazy that it only snaps at every bird that comes near it,
and never takes the trouble to chase smaller Waxbills. The
French dealers consider this the most delicate of the imported
African Waxbills, but I have had several cocks, and have not
found them particularly so. It certainly is a remarkably pretty
bird, and it is a pity that the hen is so seldom seen, as if a high
temperature was kept up, it might be induced to breed. It is
half insectivorous.
It is unnecessary to more than mention a number of such
ornamental finches as Double Banded and Cherry Finches and
Sydney Waxbills, save to say that not even the Zebra Finch has
bred with me. Probably the bird-room is too crowded for fussy
or nervous birds to go to nest successfully.
A hen Combasou laid eggs several times last summer.
Unfortunately she was very much weakened, and has since died
in moult.
The only Mannikins worth mentioning are the Javan
Maia Finch (Munia ferruginosa), five varieties of the Spice bird,
a pair of Pectoral Finches, and the Scaly-throated Sharp-tailed
Finch (Urolo 7 icha squamicollis). A small herd of Sharp-tailed,
Striated and Bengalese Mannikins do nothing but crowd, a
dozen at a time, into a nest-box ' made for two.' They are all
more or less unsatisfactory birds when kept in any number. The
way in which a collection of Bengalese will pile themselves on
the top of one unfortunate egg is most aggravating.
Several pairs of the Ruficauda bring me to the true Grass
Finches (. Poephila ). Of these I have all the species mentioned in
the Museum Catalogue--Parson Finches, Dong-tailed Grass
Finches (P. acuticauda), Masked Finches (P. per sonata), White-
eared Finches (P. leucotis), and Goulds. There seems to be
some confusion between the Masked and White-eared Pinches,
the former being exhibited under the latter name, and single
specimens of each being sold as pairs. The absence of any

white on the face is quite sufficient to distinguish P. personata.
It is curious that several pairs of P. acuticaiida should have lately
reached England from France, considering the keenness with
which French dealers look out for this bird. A Marseilles dealer
told me that it was the most expensive to buy on board ship of
all the foreign finches. It certainly is more ornamental and
better tempered than the Parson Finch.
Of the Erythriirci I have six pairs of Pin-tailed Nonpareils,
two or three Parrot Finches, and four Three-coloured Parrot
Finches (E. trichroa). The latter are always in fine condition,
so, as a rule, are the Pin-tailed Nonpareils, but I should be
ashamed to say how many Parrot Finches I have lost. Many of
the Pin-tailed Nonpareils have been in the bird-room for two
years and over. Except a couple of pairs of Dufresue's Waxbills,
nothing I have is worth mentioning in this class save, perhaps,
a hybrid between the Grey Waxbill, and the Orange-cheeked
Waxbill. There are five pairs of Cordon Bleus, not one of
which has died during two years and a half. Mr. Abrahams has
succeeded in getting me a pair of Violet-eared, but they have
not arrived yet.
Other birds include four pairs of that ridiculous creature
the Frontal Grosbeak ( Sporopipes frontalis). Half Weavers and
half Sparrows, they belie their lineage by being of a peaceful
disposition ; and they sing like Mannikins ! Each pair appears
inseparable. Eating, drinking and as nearly as possible flying
together, they look like Siamese twins. A row of them gradually
elongating their necks simultaneously is an absurd sight.
There is also a Streaky-headed Grosbeak ( Poliospiza
gularis ) and two cocks of that delightful little bird the White-
backed Eark ( Pyrrhulauda leucotis ), about the size of a Linnet.
Also a pair of the nearly allied White - crowned Lark ( P .
verticalis). Those last-named four birds are somewhat comba-
tive, which, under the circumstances, is hardly to be wondered
at.
I may also mention two hybrids between the Serin and
Green Singing Finches.
I have also a flight cage of Weavers, some Black-tailed
Hawfinches, and a pair of Shamas, which I consider worth all
the other birds put together. But that is another story.

Sycalis flaveola, Linn.
By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
Abundant from Southern Brazil westward to Venezuela,
the range of this finch extends over nearly the whole of South
America. In Argentina, however, it appears to be replaced by
Pelzeln's Saffron-finch f Sycalis pelzelni) which agrees perfectly
with it in habits and song and, as I have proved, breeds freely
with it without hesitation, the resulting young being barely, if
at all, different from the common type, but resembling their
father--the true Saffron-finch.
Because the eggs of the Saffron-finch are very like those
of our Tree-sparrow, it has been supposed by some writers that
it must be nearly related to Passer ; but this is by no means the
case. At one time I believed, as Gmelin, Buffon and Eatham
did, that it was a Bunting, for its nest is somewhat characteristic
of Emberiza , being a firm cup, formed chiefly of hay and with
very little lining, but (unlike that of Emberiza&apos;) set in the middle
of a mass of rubbish of all kinds: its violent courtship is also
somewhat Bunting-like.
As a matter of fadt the Saffron-finch is actually the Canary
of Brazil; and, as Dr. Russ observed, is called by dealers
'Brazilian Canary-bird'--' Canario der Brasilianer ' and 'Kanarie
van Brazilie.' It is indeed nearly related to the genus Serinus to
which the common Canary belongs.
In its native country the Saffron-finch builds its nest in
holes in walls or trees and in suitable nests of other birds, from
which it often expels the owners ; but, in confinement, it likes
nothing so well as a box of the cigar-box pattern half filled with
hay, upon the top of which it constructs its nest.
The courtship of this species is, not unlike that of our
Chaffinch, very violent : indeed if the hen persistently refuses
her husband's advances (as she always does at first) he does his
best to kill her, holding her down and viciously tearing feathers
and skin from her crown. After I had kept a pair together in a
large flight-cage for two years and had bred many birds from
them, the hen bird (in 1896) concluded that she had done enough
in the way of bringing up families and flew at the male bird
whenever he approached her. At length he lost his temper and,
unless I had removed her, would undoubtedly have murdered

her : her head was covered with blood, the skin of the crown
torn off and both eyes closed and swollen. She remained quite
blind for a fortnight, but managed to find her way to food, water,
and even to a high perch ; and so tough are these birds that, in
less than three weeks, she was in perfedt health though bald-
headed ; she however died about a week later.
Not only is the Saffron-finch vicious in its courtship, but
it is spiteful towards smaller associates in an aviary, and ever-
lastingly disputing with and chasing members of its own species ;
yes even its own children as soon as they are strong on the wing.
It is therefore not to be recommended for amiability. Its song
is lively but ear-piercing and gritty, chiefly consisting of those
alluring sounds produced in mischief by school boys upon their
slates : the song is extremely rapid however, and to a person
with delicate nerves is most distracting. I do not mind it myself,
not being troubled with the affedtion known as ' teeth on edge.'
My Saffron-finches breed when they please and I do not
trouble about them, hast year their eggs were broken a good
deal, and probably the newly-hatched young eaten, by Manyar
Weavers ; but they brought up a nest of four or five : a second
brood was going on well, but the Weavers interfered, so that
only one bird left the nest about the first Sunday in the present
year.
It has been said of the Chaffinch, and of a few other birds
which furiously fight with their wives for supremacy, that they
pair in the air: they however do nothing of the kind, the earth
or a branch being used for the purpose ; but before the female
has learned that the male is her lord, the two birds (whether
they be Chaffinches or Saffron-finches) grip with claw and tear
with beak, until their wings become locked and they fall
helplessly to the ground, the shock usually serving to sober
them for a time ; but no sooner have they rested than they are
at it again hammer and tongs.
When rearing their young, my birds feed largely upon
soft food, a saucer of which stands in the aviary for the benefit
of a Liothrix. They eat their fill and then fly straight to the
nest-box to disgorge.
Sycalis fiaveola cannot be greatly recommended as an aviary
bird, although it undoubtedly keeps the place alive. It has some
pretensions to beauty and its eggs are rather prettily marked ;
but its song is not melodious, and although it will breed freely
the young are not readily saleable even at about half the usual
market price. Gaudiness of plumage, beauty of voice, or rarity

Acanihis cannabina, Einn.
By J. H. Verrare.
This bird, which is variously known as the Brown Einnet,
Common Einnet, Grey Einnet, Red Einnet, Whin Einnet,
Einnet Finch, Red-headed Einnet, Rose Einnet, Yellow Einnet,
Eint-white, Eittle Einnet, and Song Einnet, presents at times a
different appearance according to sex, age, and season. Pied,
white, and cinnamon varieties are also occasionally seen.
Its usual colour is brown, and it is as a Brown Einnet that
it always appears as a cage-bird, for, notwithstanding that when
caught it may have a brilliant red head and breast (the usual
summer plumage of the adult male), yet after the first moult in
captivity it will become a plain brown bird.
As a songster the Einnet is unsurpassed among seed-
eating birds. Its song is very sweet, cheerful, and melodious,
and never loud or shrieking.
The Einnet is always a healthy bird in captivity, requiring
no special food or attention, and contented and happy whether
in a small or large cage. It needs only to be supplied with a
mixture of canary and rape seed; ripe groundsel and plantain,
of which it is very fond, may be given occasionally. When a
caged Einnet dies it is usually either from apoplexy or old age.
They have been known to live for eighteen years in a cage.
The Einnet moults very easily, but is better kept warm
during moulting, and the cage should be partially darkened.
Green food is not required at this time--in fadt the bird is
better without it.
Einnets are best caught young in August or at the
beginning of September, before they have acquired the red
feathers on the breast. They then soon become tame, and some
of them will sing within a fortnight of being caught. The
purchaser of an early caught Einnet had better trust to the
honesty of the seller as to the sex, as the difference between the
sexes is then very trifling.
Einnets do not all sing alike--and an exceptionally good
singer, tame and liome-moulted, may be worth as much as
twenty shillings--but they never have a disagreeable note. And
they sing for ten months in the year.

CORRESPONDENCE.
THE UVvEAN PARRAKEET.
Sir, --Did any members of the Avicultural Society have any of the
recently-imported Nytnphicus uvceensis ? If so, have they been successful in
keeping them alive, and how have they fed them ?
I had seven--two on Feb. 17, and five on the 18th. One was an old
one, and six were young. One of the young ones was ill when it arrived,
and died in a day or two. Then one of the first pair fell ill and died, and
was quickly followed by the old one. The Prosector of the Zoo dissected
the young one ; Sir Everett Millais the old one. The organs were healthy,
but the lower bowel of the old one was congested. The four remaining
ones seemed healthy, but I soon saw one was failing: it died, and I have
not had the report on that. Then the three remaining ones began to eat
less, and the strongest fell ill. It died, and dissection revealed that the
liver was out of order.
Two are still alive, but they have ceased to feed well, and I daresay
will follow the others.
I am persuaded it is a food difficulty. I was told they had been
brought over on paddy, hemp, canary, and monkey nuts. I have tried
bananas and grapes: they were not approved of. I have given millet,
hemp, canary, boiled rice, boiled Indian corn, bread and milk, sponge cake,
pea nuts, and chilies; everything is eaten eagerly at first: the ones that
were the first to succumb eating seed till almost the very last. But
these later ones refuse food--though one of them likes to have bits of bread
and milk given it occasionally.
I asked Mr. Bartlett to advise me ; but he said they had bought two
at the Zoo, and both were looking ill. He could not find anything that
would do. Does anyone know what they eat in New Caledonia ?*
I have always thought them attractive birds, and wished to breed
them; but I do not appear to be likely to attain my desire.
F. G. Dutton.
7&apos;he following reply was sent to the Hon. and Rev. F. G. Dutton :--
I have not had my Uvaean Parrakeet long, so cannot be sure of its
proper treatment; I will briefly relate my little experiences.
I obtained a pair on February 12--but the male (which was sick when
I received it) died in a few days. The female is strong and clever on the
wing, runs actively about, has become fairly (comparatively) tight in
plumage, and seems pretty well established. She is as tame as a kitten ;
flies on to our heads, arms, anywhere, and calls out to me if she hears my
voice in the house.
For standard food she has canary, hemp, crumbled biscuit (dry), and
date or fig cut into small pieces; she has also had millet and oats, but took
them only occasionally. Now and then she is treated to a sound banana
{not peeled), and sometimes she will attack half an orange. The great
difficulty with her has been to relieve her great craving for grit, and to
get her digestive arrangements into order without having a block or

stoppage of any kind. With wheatmeal biscuit, the hardest bits of toast-
crust, etc., she seems to have got into a fairly healthy state, and ought to
do now. Sometimes I have given fluid magnesia in the drinking-water,
and sometimes sulphate of iron.
She is in the dining-room, and at breakfast her cage-door is opened,
and she at once makes for the bread--I never let her have crumb, only the
hard crust. Soft things like butter and marmalade she does not like. I
encourage her to drink fairly hot water out of the slop-basin : she takes a
good deal and I think it is good for her. She likes to go for the plants in
the window (when I am attending to her cage--never at meals), but only
attacks some creepers (I forget the name)--but out of regard for the plants
I take her away, literally by force,--so possibly a taste of green food might
be beneficial. R. Phituipps.
Sir,--I add a post-script to the above letters. I have come to the
conclusion that Horned Parrakeets are seed-eaters, but that these arrived
with impaired digestions. Had I treated them as you would treat a person
recovering from starvation, I might have saved them. They ought to have
been kept chiefly on sop, and allowed to have seed only very gradually.
My bird is still alive, but it gets neither better nor worse. It is
lively, though not tight in plumage, and the tail is not reproduced. I think
some benefit has resulted from my administering dialysed iron in the water.
Mr. Phillipps thinks he has distinguished the sexes. I did not find
myself successful in so doing. The first two sent me as a pair, and which
I thought myself were a pair, proved to be two cocks. Of the other four
young ones, one which was much smaller than the others and looked very
feminine, was a male; of two others, larger than the rest which I con-
sidered two males, one was male and the other female.

LOGS AND NEST-BOXES FOR PARRAKEETS.

Sir, --When I first commenced breeding Parrakeets, I experienced
some difficulty in procuring the above in the various sizes required, and
well adapted for the purpose. I venture, therefore, to send you the
enclosed sketches and notes, hoping they will be of use to members of
the Society who may be experiencing the same difficulty.
In my own aviary I generally put logs and boxes, but so far have
had more young reared in the boxes than in the logs, although the latter
\0x25A0were made to order and are of an unusually large size. The boxes, as
described, I frequently make myself, and as a box of about the required
size can generally be got from the grocer for a few pence, and the wooden
bowl for about the same amount, the cost of the box complete is but a
trifle. No exact dimensions can be given, nor are they necessary, for I find
as regards the box, a Parrakeet is not particular to an inch either way.
The following sizes are about what is required, but if any difference,
rather larger than smaller.

The hole by which the birds enter the box must, of course, be cut
according to the size of the Parrakeets the box is intended for--about
inches is sufficient for Budgerigars and about 3 inches for Crimson-wings--
the other sizes in proportion.
Such boxes can also be made to order by any carpenter or any dealer

enough to launch out into the world, and they gain strength by the exercise.

THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE REPORTS ON THE
CRYSTAL PALACE SHOW OF 1897.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99802975" page_id="32635178"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
Sir, --It is a somewhat ungracious task, especially on the part of an
exhibitor, to criticize the critics, but I venture to offer, in all sincerity, the
following remarks upon the articles in the March number of the Avicultural
Magazine referring to the Crystal Palace Show.
I think I cannot do better than begin by noticing Mr. Bonliote's
"protest against distinctive marks upon the cages, such as instructions for
feeding." I do not think for a moment that Mr. Bonhote is
referring particularly to me, but as every one of my cages had a label,
" Please do not feed," I trust I may be excused in explaining that these
labels were affixed after the judging.
Those who saw the sticky mess which did duty for " food " at the
show, and which is very justly condemned by Mr. Marshall as " simply
disgraceful," will admit that it was a very necessary precaution to instruct
the attendants not to give it to one's birds. A Starling might have
managed to exist for a day or two upon it, but to give it to delicate
insectivorous or fruit-eating birds was simply an outrage. I know my own
birds would have starved rather than eat such a mixture. Hence my
"distinctive labels," "Please do not feed."
I shall not occupy your space by going, in detail, through the -
differences of opinion between your contributors and the judges, as they
represent, of course, only one opinion against another, but I should, neverthe-
less, like to endorse Mr. Bonhote's mention of the Lesser Redpolls as having
been unjustly overlooked. Our judges do not seem to know that the Lesser
Redpoll is a true resident British bird, while the Mealy Redpoll should
really be in the migratory class. This question, together with the proper
classification of the Bramble-finch, and sundry matters of the same sort,
will form a subject for the consideration of the British Bird and Mule Club,
after they have settled the question now engaging their attention, namety,

<bodyText confidence="0.999148631578948" page_id="32635178"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
No. 1643, referred to by Mr. Bonhote as "afine Ortolan Bunting, a
thorough migratory bird," is catalogued as a Woodlark. I have 110 note in
my catalogue to this number, so I cannot say whether Mr. Bonhote or the
catalogue is correct, but would Mr. Bonhote admit an Ortolan Bunting
as a British bird, migratory or otherwise ? For myself, I think they are not
found sufficiently often in England to justify their inclusion among our
birds at all. I have one myself which I have never shown, thinking it
would not be recognized in the British classes.
Mr. Bonhote, I think, is rather unduly severe upon 1113- Swallow. He
sa}&apos;s it " has been a Swallow." I can tell him that it is still very much a
Swallow ; and if he saw it swallow mealworms he would admit it justified
its name. The bird is in perfect health, and so tame that it will feed from
one's fingers, and I have every hope of successfully moulting him, and of
showing him next year as a cage-moulted Swallow. No one expects to see,
in February, in perfect condition, a Swallow caught the previous Summer.
The Talking Starling specially mentioned by Mr. Marshall, is the
bird which was the subject of an article in the Avicultural Magazine of June,
1S95. He says two or three sentences ver}&amp;quot; distinctly, and I am sorry he did
not make himself "understanded of " Mr. Marshall. Nevertheless, "Jacob"

could not expect to be higher than third, considering that Mrs. Hobbs'
famous "Victor" was only second.
I quite agree that a Raven is not a cage-bird at all, and should never
be admitted into competition as such.
I must ask the privilege of replying to Dr. Butler's remarks upon the
Weaver and Whydah class (No. 105). Dr. Butler, referring to my Giant
Wliydali, says, " being a young bird, it has not yet attained its full
colouring." This bird won 1st at the Crystal Palace in 1895, and was then
full} 7 matured -- he cannot, therefore, be a young bird. My experience is
that the "colouring"---by which I presume Dr. Butler means the shoulder
markings -- deteriorates with age, not improves. The Crimson - banded
Whydah I have had since 1894, and he was in full plumage when I bought
him. He can scarcely be less than four years old, and his colouring gets
paler with each moult.
Further, my other Whydahs do not conform to Dr. Butler's statement
that most Whydahs are in February losing their summer dress. My
Paradise and Pin-tail Whydahs were just coming into colour at the date of
the Palace Show, and are now nearly in full plumage.
Everyone will agree with Dr. Butler that "foreign" Bullfinches and
Goldfinches have no business amongst the tropical birds. Moreover,
wherever they are, they should be judged by the British bird judge, and
not by a foreign specialist.
The query by Mr. Seth-Smith, " where are the pretty little Red-sided
Tits ? " brings home to one the memory of lost opportunities. These birds
came over in considerable numbers in 1895, and could have been bought for
nominal prices. I bought two pairs, and I think my pair at the Crystal
Palace last year was the only pair exhibited at any show. One of my four
died, and the other three were improving daily, until one unlucky morning
when the door of the aviary was left unfastened, and they escaped,
together with some thirty other foreigners, not one of which I was able
to re-capture. I should be glad to pay several times the 1895 price for
some more Red-sided Tits, but I have not been able to find any since losing
my own. They are most interesting birds in an aviary, and after they have
got over their first troubles are not at all difficult to keep, always providing
the door is not left open.
Classes 112 and 114 were worth a day's journey to see. Such a
collection of beautiful rarities was surely never before got together, and
fully proved that among the foreign bird owners there are plenty who will
exhibit their acquisitions for our edification and instruction if reasonable
classification and prize-money be offered.
Referring back to " distinctive marks ; " while I am sure it would be
the last wish of Mr. Humplirys to show his birds in "distinctive" cages,
yet I must take exception to Mr. Seth-Smith's appreciation of the " very
roomy cage" in which Mr. Russell Humphry&apos;s Garrulous Honey-eaters
were shown. I did not measure the cage in question, but it approached
nearer to the dimensions of a compartment of a railway carriage than to a
reasonable show cage, and in close competition would in some minds give
the impression that the cage unduly drew the attention of the judge. I
wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not agree with the too
frequently expressed opinions that judges are influenced by "distinctive"
marks, but at the same time, I would deprecate the showing of birds in

cages which could possibly give rise to such insinuations. A show cage is
not necessarily a cage in which a bird can be permanently kept, and I
certainly think it should be as unobtrusive as possible. I am thoroughly
in accord with the principle of showing one's birds to the best advantage,
but this principle can be overdone.*
The Pectoral Rail shown in this class is distinctly not a cage-bird.
I have already occupied so much space that I will refrain from
commenting on the criticisms on the Parrot classes.

Sir, -- I have often read that the young of various foreign Doves can
be reared with very little trouble by placing the eggs under Barbary Doves
and allowing the latter to hatch them and rear the young. It is said that
they do not discover the fraud, but bring up the nestlings as though they
were their own. A popular writer on aviculture mentions a case in which
no less than seventeen young Crested Doves were brought up in one year
by Barbary Doves. Perhaps my experience of two pairs of the latter
species, which I kept for a short time in order to try them as foster-parents
for young Vinaceous Doves, may be of interest, and perhaps act as a
warning to some members who "go in for " the ColumbidcB.
My old pair of Vinaceous Turtle-doves have reared a number of
3&apos;ouug in their time, and it would have been far better if I had let them
bring up all their own young last year; but I was tempted to try the
above experiment, with the following unfortunate results.
A friend having two pairs of Barbary Doves to dispose of, I purchased
them, and gave each pair a separate place, in which they very soon went
to nest. One pair laid on precisely the same date as the Vinaceous
Doves, so I took their eggs away and substituted the eggs of the latter,
which were duly hatched. Everything seemed to go well with them until
they had got well fledged, when the Barbarys apparently discovered
that a trick had been played upon them, and forthwith] discontinued to
feed the youngsters, which consequently died.
The next pair of eggs laid by the hen Vinaceous Dove were given to
the other pair of Barbarys, but with precisely the same result.
I don't know whether the Collared birds had reared young of their
own before coming into my possession, if not it is just possible that they
would have treated their own youngsters the same ; but this is highly
improbable, and as both pairs behaved in the same way, it seems probable
that they discovered that the little mites were impostors. I believe
Barbary Doves have often brought up the young of the Australian Crested
Pigeon (Ocyphaps lophotes) and, if I remember aright, Mr. Housden told
me that he had successfully reared a very interesting hybrid between a
Cambayan Turtle-dove (71 senegalensis) and a domestic Pigeon, by placing
the egg under a Barbary Dove, and my failure to rear Vinaceous Doves by
this means is the more unaccountable, as the latter species is very closely
* Exhibitors have often been found fault with for showing their birds in too small
cages--it seems hard that they should now be complained of for showing them in too large
ones.-- Ed.

allied to T. risorius, and only a shade smaller: whereas, the Crested Doves
(or Pigeons) are very distantly related.
This question is of interest to a very few members, and I must
apologise for having taken up valuable space with it, but a member
recently suggested rearing Parrakeets in this way, and it will be as well
to consider whether Barbary Doves may be depended upon to bring up
other Doves before trying the experiment with so widely distinct a race as
the Psittacidce.

Sir, --The February number of the Magazine contains a note by
Mr. Catleugh on the above subject, in which he apparently claims to be
the only successful breeder of Green Singing Finches. Possibly this may
be literally true, but I have had an interesting experience in this con-
nection which I will relate.
When I first stocked our aviary--which readers will remember is a
garden one without any artificial heat--I bought two Green and two Grey
Singing Finches, hoping that each two would prove a pair. -No nesting
took place the first summer, and in the following winter one of each two
died. The survivors happened to be cock (Green) and hen (Grey). In the
early Spring these two became very friendly, and in due course a nest was
built, eggs were laid and young hatched, and by about the middle of April
two young ones left the nest--fine, strong young birds. Each year the
same pair has produced the same result. Their nesting period is always
very early, the young are always two in number and always grey, though
lighter than the mother, and the young cocks have the streak over the eyes
very plainly marked ; they are fine singers, but apt to be quarrelsome in
the breeding season. So far, I have not seen any disposition on the part of
the young ones themselves to breed.
The nest is a very poor loosely-constructed structure -- possibly due to
the fact that it is built so early in the year, before building material is
supplied--and is always placed in a bunch of gorse, quite close to the front
wire of the aviary, so that the bird can be clearly seen sitting, and in fact
the whole domestic life of the family is open to public observation. The
first year, the first nest was poked out by some miscreant with his walking
stick; the second year it was so slight that I had to put an old Hedge
Sparrows' nest under it, and this quite swallowed it up, but the hen went
on steadily with her incubation. This year there was one egg laid on the
23rd March. The birds are perfectly hardy, and iii the keenest winter
night will sleep on a curled scroll of iron-work which forms a bracket to
support a roof-joist. I have sometimes taken away the bunch of gorse with
which we ornament the bracket, hoping its removal would lead to the bird
seeking a more sheltered position inside the house-place, but she would
not budge, aud so the gorse has been replaced to afford such protection as
it may.
I can recommend these birds as being well worth keeping, for they
require no special food--millet and canary seed with a little of Abrahams'
soft food and plenty of fresh chickweed answering all their needs.

MY KINGFISHERS.
By Charges T. Rothera.
The bird which, more than any other, I pride myself on
being able to keep successfully, is the Kingfisher. When first I
introduced one into our pool aviary, I was told on all hands that
the attempt to keep the bird in confinement was foredoomed to
failure ; that it was of so wild and retiring a nature that it
would never settle down or take its food, and that it was cruel to
try. I lost two or three, generally within a day or two or a week
at most, and began to think my advisers must be right. But one
day I was watching matters generally, when my man came up
with a can of live fish and proceeded to empty it on to the
shallow margin of the pool. While he was so engaged, the
Kingfisher darted down on to the edge of the can and grabbed a
fish, striking the man's hand as it made its swoop. I at once
concluded that it would feed when it had the chance, and that
the death of its predecessors must have been due to some
inability to get the fish out of the pool although a considerable
number had been put in, and that they would not resort to the
food pan from which the Waders obtained their supplies and
help themselves to raw meat or chopped worms.
I accordingly pondered the subjedt over, and concluded
that the fish soon became aware of the presence of their natural
enemy above them and sought places of shelter, of which the
pool furnished unlimited provision in the rough stone work of
the margin and island and the groups of water plants, and thus
the birds could not obtain a sufficient supply of food.
I therefore constructed an open pan with perforated sides,
about 18 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep, and floated it with
corks so that it held about four inches of water. Into this a few
live fish are thrown two or three times a day and the difficulty
is at an end. I kept a pair of birds through the whole of the

very severe weather of January and February, 1895, though we
were reduced to very great extremities once, by inability to
obtain live fish, and the birds' reluctance to eat anything else,
even dead sprats being carried about and only eaten at last in
desperation.
Eventually, rats found their way into the aviary, and both
my Kingfishers fell victims to their greedy ferocity.
It was a considerable time before I could replace them,
but ultimately I obtained a fine cock bird which soon made
himself at home, and so much so, that he will not brook the
presence of a companion, and has killed off three in rapid
succession. As I have mentioned in a previous communication,
this propensity is one of the greatest difficulties the aviculturist
has to contend with.
But it is not the only one. Among the birds that I
obtained after the rats had been disposed of were two or three
various Gulls and a pair of Tesser Bitterns--most interesting but
retiring birds, these latter. They all evinced a marked preference
for live minnow over raw beef, and there was soon a race among
them which could secure the bowl first. The poor Kingfisher
had hardly a look in, for if he got a fish he had to carry it away
and kill it before he could swallow it; the others just sailed
around the pan or sat on its edge and gorged themselves so long
as there was a fish left--110 wonder that the fecundity of fish has
to be so remarkable !
The Gulls being pinioned and only able to swim were soon
circumvented, but the Bitterns were quite a different kettle of fish.
They flew on to the edge of the pan, and being extraordinarily
light for their apparent size, could balance themselves there
without oversetting it. The addition of a sloping coronet of net
wire did not trouble them--they stood upon it with their big
spreading feet, and stretching out a telescopic neck from between
their high shoulders, reached out the fish without difficulty.
Finally, it was found necessary to cut a wing, which completely
cowed the birds and rendered them more retiring in their ways
than ever. I never saw birds so spoilt by the operation.
The Kingfisher itself is an interesting bird, altogether
beyond the beauty of its plumage. We have no other bird in the
aviary that attracts so much attention from the general public.
It is, however, extremely dirty in its habits, and in that respedt an
undesirable inmate ; but this renders it a suitable companion
at least for Gulls. It is a difficult bird to cater for, and eats
voraciously, diving into the bowl and fetching out two or three fish

as long as the little finger, in quick succession. One evening,
when watching the bird, I saw it suddenly fly upwards towards
the roof as if it were bent on breaking its neck against the wire,
but before reaching it, it as suddenly turned and darted with the
rapidity of lightning headfirst into the pool, returning to the
surface direCtly with a fish, which it carried to its favourite bough
to dispose of. It had, in this action, exactly the appearance of a
rocketing Pheasant or Grouse, that flies for some distance after
being heavily hit, and I take it that the bird has an instinctive
knowledge of the momentum that is necessary to carry it deep
enough into the water to enable it to reach the fish it goes for.
And this is very remarkable, for b3^ the laws of optics the fish
appears to be about one fourth nearer the surface than it actually
is ; but I cannot account for the upward flight before the dive in
any other way.
The Kingfisher apparently invariably washes itself after
taking a meal. It plunges two or three times in rapid succession
into the pool--generally within range of the splash made by a
light dripping cascade--and then sits and preens its feathers. I
imagine that the process of killing the fish by beating its head
against a bough or stone causes the feathers of the bird to be
splashed with slimy moisture from the fish, and so renders
ablution desirable or even necessaiy.

By the Rev. Thos. B. Gibson, A.M.
Perhaps no one ever began aviary-keeping for such a
reason as I did, sometime in the spring of 1889. Of course, as a
boy, I had the usual amount of successes and perhaps more than
the usual amount of failures, with bird-pets ; but these attempts
exercised no great influence upon me, and when I did start an
aviary, it came about unintentionally, in this way.
A Rosy-breasted Cockatoo had been sent to me, as a
present; but it was not long before its noise, and the necessity of
daily renewing its perches, drove me to the plan of constructing
an aviary round a tree in the garden, for its future residence.
Probably I should have taken the bird inside when the
hard weather came, but in October I was seized with a severe
attack of typhoid fever and, consequently, the Cockatoo had to
take his chance, though the winter was a severe one. Being well
looked after by a man about the place, he not only survived, but
improved in appearance. Since that time neither he nor any of
my birds has been taken inside, no matter what the weather

may be, though the aviary is totally unheated, and yet they are
infinitely superior in health and feather to birds of the same
kind carefully attended to in heated aviaries.
My aviary was easily made, thus:--I planted eight posts
around the tree, and nailed short pieces in a sloping position
from these posts to the tree. This cap I roofed in with wood,
and then covered the wood with tarred felt. Next I nailed wire
netting, narrow in mesh, all round the posts down to the ground,
except between two of the posts, where I left an opening, about
three feet high, in which I afterwards placed a door, made also of
netting attached to a frame. Then, as additional security, as
well as for shelter, I boarded over the netting at the base and
top for about nine inches. No other protection has ever been
given to my birds, and as there are very many kinds in the
aviary I can exercise no particular control over their food, each
being free to indulge his fancy. There is always sufficient food
placed fresh in the aviary, together with clean water at least
once a day. Hemp, canary seed, millet, rape, wheat and maize
are the only seeds used ; nothing else is given except a basinful
of bread soaked in milk, fresh every morning, with occasional
treats of groundsel, duckweed, plantain and water-cress. I
have never troubled to soak the bread in water, or to squeeze out
the alum. I notice that bread soaked in milk is preferred by all
birds--for all eat it when fresh--to bread soaked in water.
With regard to bathing, some birds are inordinately fond of
it, and all enjoy it whilst the water is clean. Starlings would bathe
twenty times a day if you gave them fresh baths so often ; and
the same may be said of Bramble-finches and Missel-Thrushes,
though Song-thrushes and Fieldfares are not so persistent.
Bullfinches and Chaffinches too are fond of bathing, as are also
most of the Bunting family, except the Common or Corn
Bunting; but I have never seen Sparrows or Quails bathe,
though both kinds delight in the sand heap as a substitute.
I purchased two Quails, both cocks, for I have never been
able to obtain a hen, and though one killed itself against the
wire the first night, the other still survives. This bird has, more
than once, slipped out whilst the door was open ; but it never
seems to care about going away, and waits quietly outside till I
catch it. It often gives the well-known Ouail-call, but it has
another kind of call, like the crowing of a cock, that I have
never heard described by any observer.* My Californian Quails
are beautiful but rather wild.

Of the Crow family I have three kinds--the Starling,
Jackdaw, and Jay. There are about a dozen Starlings in my
aviary ; though I would not keep so manjr were it not through
fear of losing one I have had for five years, not being able to
distinguish my favourite from the others except by his voice,
which is superior to anything I had ever imagined in a Starling--
for he imitates every bird in the aviarjq and chuckles over his
imitations when he has finished. This bird I obtained from a
nest, having taken him while unfledged, and placed him in a
cage which I then hung over the entrance to the nest. The old
birds attended to him for about a month, when I placed him in
the aviary. The others were only admitted to save their lives
in a hard winter.
It is very singular that my Starlings have never bred in
the aviary, though some of them have been almost reared in it.
My one Jackdaw was also reared by its mother in my aviary.
My Jay was a purchase from England *: he is not much of a
mimic, but is a beautiful bird, and quicker in his movements
than any other with which I am acquainted. I feared that the
smaller birds would have no chance of breeding in the same
aviary with him, and so built another aviary in a sunnier spot,
which has been quite successful. In building this, I took advantage
of the angle between two walls, so that there was perfect shelter
from N. winds, and the wire netting was only on the S. side.
I also boarded more than half the flooring of the aviary in a
sloping manner, so that the birds have always got dry footing to
rest on below as well as on the perches. I also placed a number
of boxes, cocoa-nuts, etc., in suitable positions for nesting, but
here, as in the other ayfary, my birds greatly preferred their own
to my arrangements. Not many, however, constructed nests or
laid eggs, except a pair of Bullfinches and a pair of Budgerigars,
these latter being indefatigable in that way.
Of the Warbler family, I have only kept four, and one of
these, a Stonechat, only lived with me for a few days. A Wheatear,
however, lived for about two months, and I had an opportunity of
watching the peculiar movements of its tail and the spreading out
of its wings whilst it sang. The Robin I possess is so wild, that
after two years residence with me, whenever I go inside, it creeps
under the boarding and remains in hiding till I have left. I pur-
chased a pair of Hedge Sparrows or Hedge Accentors, but the
hen died in less than a week. The survivor has astonished me with
the beauty of its song: after a hfime it became quite tame, and

would allow me to stroke it down, scarcely moving away when I
placed my face close to it. The peculiar shuffling of its wings
seems to be involuntary.
Of Doves I have several kinds--the common Ring-dove,
the Turtle-dove, the Stock-dove, the White Japanese Dove, and
the Egyptian Dove, the latter being like the common Ring-dove
but suffused with a rosy hue all over the body. East year
the Stock-doves brought out one young Dove, as did also the
Ring-doves, but both young birds have died. This year the
former have reared a beautiful pair of young ones. In the early
summer, one of the most singular spectacles possible to imagine
was to be seen in the aviary : for, in a very capacious nest on a
tree branch, there were six Doves' eggs, and on this nest, seated
in harmony, a Turtle, a Japanese, and common Ring-dove,
though outy one nestling survived.
Very lately I obtained a Magpie, which, with the Jay, I
had to move from the larger aviary, as, on the very first night of
its residence, it killed two Thrushes and a Sparrow.
As in the case of the Starling, it is fear of losing a mag-
nificent songster which prevents me from releasing or giving away
one of my four Blackbirds. And a like cause, in part, operates
with me as regards Thrushes, of which I have eleven--nine being
Song-thrushes (mostly caught in the cold weather), the others
being the Missel-thrush and a Fieldfare. I have, too, a very fine
Ring Ouzel, but being a late purchase I cannot say much about
its habits, except that it is very tame, having been brought up
by hand. The Song-thrushes have always built nests and laid
eggs, but the hatching has been intermittent, and no young birds
have been reared. The Missel-thrush has surprised me by the
delicacy of its throat-notes, for though the five or six notes of
its usual song are shrill enough, it loves to come beside me
(either when inside or outside the aviary) and to give utterance
to the softest of tones, deep down in its throat, as if it were
whispering a song, while all the while it turns its head to look
into my eyes, as if noting the effedt.
Of the Fieldfare I cannot say much, as it was only
captured lately. It is, however, a beautiful bird, and though its
voice, as far as I know, is unmusical, its elegant shape and
bluish-grey colour, together with its peculiarly tipped beak,,
make it an ornament to the aviary.
In this my first aviary, there are several Sparrows, who
are the very wildest of its denizens. One is rather a rarity,

having two white feathers in each wing. Of the Larks I have
had several ; but only one ever distinguished himself as a
songster, and he died during a hard winter. All tny Larks, after
a short time in the aviary, are perfectly well able to perch. Of
Titmice, I have only kept the Great or Ox-eye Titmouse and
the smaller Blnecap. I did not greatly care for the former, as
it more than once broke the eggs of a Canary that had paired
with a Siskin. I never heard it sing, and it usually was in a
state of chattering wrath either with me or some denizen of the
aviary. It was interesting, though, to watch the manner in
which it held a grain of hempseed in its claw to peck at, always
flying with a single grain to a particular spot. The Blue Bonnet
is a more satisfactory bird and quite as amusing : he loves any-
thing in the way of fat, and appears fond of water ; but has not
yet nested with me. The Common Linnet is very easily kept in
captivity, and is not liable to diseases. The song is very sweet,
and it continues the music until very late in the evening. The
Twite I have found very hard to keep, and I cannot recommend
this species as being so satisfactory as either the Linnet or
Redpoll. Of this latter species I have had four, for about five
years, and I am able to disprove a statement in regard to its
colour, which maintains that the captive bird having lost the red
colour never recovers it in captivity. I once had a large Mealy
Redpoll, but it was hanged through being entangled in a piece
of twine. None of these birds ever began to build a nest, nor
have I noticed any inclination to pair, though I always keep my
birds in pairs when possible.
The Greenfinch is quite hard}^ but not easily made quite
tame. It and the Bullfinch are very fond of a branch in bud.
This latter is a prime favourite with me, and my pair can hardly
be tamer. They have built a nest, but the young died. The
nest was loosely made, some of the hairs having been obtained
from my beard. The hen, but not the cock, can pipe a few bars
of " Pop goes the weasel."
My Hawfinches are very healthy but uninteresting, and
the voice coming from such a beak is ludicrous.
The Crossbills are my favourite birds ; and one, an
incessant songster, is very tame and affectionate. I prefer it to
anything, almost everything, else I have got.

By A. G. Butler, Ph. D., etc.
As there are some birds which are naturally of a quarrel-
some disposition, although individuals may occur which are
exceptionally pacific ; as also there are birds which rarely or
never dispute, or which confine their differences to members of
their own species ; so also there are birds which are of a trustful
and docile nature, appreciative of kindness and always ready to
make friends with their recognized keeper.
Among our British birds, when caught wild and turned
into an aviary, I have found most soft-billed birds more or less
easy to tame after their first moult; but there are some species
which become confiding long before that -- the Robin and
Stonechat and the female of the Grey Wagtail having taken
mealworms from my fingers in less than a week after they came
into my possession. The Blue-tit is a very trustful little bird,
and soon learns to know its owner and take liberties with him ;
but of all the Finches I have only found the Siskin really
friendly in a short time ; one pair having flown down to my
hand three days after I purchased them.
When kept in cages many birds appear to be tame long
before they really are so. A birdcatcher once brought me a fine
Goldfinch, in one of those diabolical cages about the size of a
match-box; he had kept it thus confined for a year or two and
prided himself upon its tameness ; for, however terrified the poor
bird might be when he poked his finger at it, there was no way of
escape; so that it simply crouched without fluttering. The
man told me he was hard up and offered me the bird for three
shillings, and, pitying the poor captive, I bought it and turned
it into a large flight cage : never before or since have I owned
so wild a Goldfinch !
At the same time, when a bird is fresh caught, too much
liberty at first often retards the taming process : I have tamed
Blackbirds in three or four days by keeping them in a cage where
they were compelled always to face me when feeding, and where
they had no room to knock themselves to pieces ; then, finding
them docile, I gave them greater liberty: 3^et all Blackbirds will
not thus be tamed, but remain more or less wild until after the
autumn moult.
Among foreign birds, the Blue Robin, so-called, and the
Pekin Nightingale so mis-called, are the quickest to recognise
their owners ; whilst, among the Finches, the American Non-

pareil, the Bengalee, the Green Cardinal, and the Red-crested
Finch are among the tamest, home-reared Cut-throats are,
however, perhaps the most confiding of all foreign finches
which I have had.
Some Doves, but more especially the common Barbary
Dove, become a perfedt nuisance from their friendliness, settling
upon your head diredtly you enter the aviary where they are, and
returning as fast as you lift them off; but others never seem to
become really tame ; although, after the lapse of time, they
show less fear than at first.
The tiny,Chinese Ouails, which at first are very nervous,
and fly against the roof at the risk of broken necks when you
enter their domains, gradually learn to moderate their timidity
and merely trot out of your way ; also, when you are once out-
side the wirework, they will run like chicken to eat any dainty--
such as a cockroach--which you throw in for them.
To be a pleasure to their owners, birds should be tame ;
half the charm of my lovely specimen of the Pileated Jay con-
sists in the fact that he will take food from my fingers, and will
sing and dance to me. On the other hand, birds which never
get tame, like some of the Cardinals when in large aviaries, or
the Cowbirds and Troupials, are a constant source of irritation:
however beautiful a bird may be, if it rattles about in extreme
terror, and imagines you are going to murder it whenever you
approach its aviary, you feel that you can never make a friend of
it--and resolve, when you part with it or it dies, never to have
anotner of its species.
REVIEW.
Animals at Work and Play , by C. J. Cornish (Seeley &amp;* Co ., LtdJ
Mr. Cornish's books are always delightful, and this is no
exception to the rule. We cannot notice half the good things
about birds to be found in it, and would recommend our readers
to get the book themselves.
Mr. Cornish appears not to know the difference between
Budgerigars and Rove-birds, and seems half inclined to credit
the old fable that they die of grief after the loss of their mate.
And they are not "delicate birds," as he says they are.
The chapter on " The Soaring of Birds," though it con-
tains nothing new, is well worth reading. And the same may be
said of that on " Birds Rost in Storms."
"The writer was informed that some years ago, at a hawking part}&amp;quot;

on Salisbury Plain, a falcon was flown at a carrion-crow, which it struck
after a long flight, and the two birds came down like a parachute to the
ground. The party galloped up, and were about to dismount to take up
the falcon, when the mate of the crow suddenly descended from a great
height, with such velocity that the wings made a whizzing sound like that
of a falling stone, and dashed 011 to the falcon. The force of the blow
struck the hawk from its quarry, which was uninjured bv the grapple in
the air; and both crows flew off unhurt into a copse near."
We cannot quite understand Mr. Cornish's statement
that birds swallow grit as a medicine. Grit in the stomach
is necessary to the proper digestion of seeds, for birds cannot
masticate, having no teeth. We understand a medicine to be
something taken to cure an unhealthy condition, and the word
is inappropriate to a thing taken regularly, when the bird is in
good health, to enable it to assimilate its food.
The chapters on migration are chiefly noticeable for the
very interesting account of the late Mr. Seebohm's discoveries
in the valleys of the Petcliora and the Yenisei. There, in
Siberia, within the Arctic circle, he found the long sought
breeding place of the Grey Plover and some other species, and
revealed a perfect paradise of birds where literally millions of
the feathered race go every spring to rear their young and feed
upon the immense store of the previous year's berries, strangely
preserved through the winter by the snow.
"The Animal View of Captivity" contains some very
sound observations, and we wish it could be read by all those
who talk hysterically about the cruelty of keeping birds in
captivity.
" What makes the happiness of wild animals ? The question is not very
easily answered. The abstract idea of liberty certainly does not enter into
it in the case of the greater number.Within certain limits they
are free to choose their life, and presumably they choose that which pleases
them best. In nearly every case this is one of pure routine. It consists in
the daily repetition of a very limited series of actions, the greater number
of which seem to give them satisfaction rather than pleasure, but make up
in the aggregate the sum of animal happiness.It may be
doubted whether, if the food supply were plentiful and constant, animals
or birds would ever care to move beyond the circle in which they can find
enough for their daily wants. ... It may be doubted if a Zoo sparrow
has ever visited Hyde Park, or whether, if the caged birds were given their
liberty, they would leave the Gardens."
Of all the chapters in the book we most enjoy that entitled
" Homes for Wild Birds," and will conclude with a quotation
from it.
" Most birds that build in holes can be easily attracted by anything
like a box with a hole in the side. Woodpeckers, nuthatches and wrynecks
nearly always prefer to hollow out a hole for themselves; and a few dead

branches, or even dead trees left in the garden, will nearly always attract
one or the other. The wrynecks alwaj-s like a dead willow better than any
other tree. If there is a pond, waterhens are sure to know of it, for they
are great travellers, especially at night; and a pair are almost certain to
take possession of it if there are one or two bushes on the bank with boughs
just touching the water, so that they may form a basis for the floating
nest. But the birds most wanted in a garden are all those warblers which
come to us during the spring and summer. They are the most useful, for
they are exclusively insect-eaters, and the most charming, for, except the
chiff-chaff, they all sing sweetly. They can be won over with ease, for they
come to us on purpose to nest; and every cock-bird that arrives selects
some pleasant spot where his mate, when he has won her by out-singing
his rivals, can build her nest. The redstart, the most beautiful of them all,
will nest in the boxes; the black-cap and garden-warbler, the best songsters
after the nightingale, are very fond of bramble bushes, and a few long
runners planted in a corner of a shrubbery will soon find a tenant. The
nightingales are harder to entice, for they insist on thicker covert, if
possible in the neighbourhood of oak trees, with the dead leaves of which
the nest is always finished ; but they may be invited by keeping a piece of
coppice or cliimp of shrubs cut low, and so forcing them to grow close and
bushy. It is by no means necessary that the spot shall be a retired one, for
small birds during the nesting season are almost indifferent to man. The
writer knew of a nightingale which nested in a window-box, and has found
many nests within a few feet of a path. Only one precaution need be
observed--the birds must not be frequently disturbed, nor the eggs
handled."

In the "Small-Talk" for February, aviculturists were warned against
feeding Alario Finches on millet, and last month, in Mr. Fillmer's article on
the species, this warning was repeated. It must not, however, be imagined
that millet-seed is in itself injurious to these birds, but merely that having
acquired a taste for it they frequently eat it in preference to more
nourishing seeds. Dr. Butler possesses a male Alario Finch which has
lived in one of his aviaries for nearly nine years, and has always had access
to an unlimited supply of millet; so that it does not invariably bring about
their untimely death. Nevertheless, we believe that Dr. Butler's bird is
the exception which proves the rule, and that the experience of most
aviculturists who have kept Alario Finches with Waxbills and other millet
eating birds is that they seldom live for more than a }&apos;ear or two.
The Chinese Quail is a bird which ought to become popular. The
male is decidedly pretty, and thej 7 are most inoffensive little creatures, and
apparently very hardy. Living, as they do, entirely on the floor of the
aviary, they are almost unnoticed by the other occupants, and thus while
they increase the population of the aviary they do not make it more
crowded. They speedily become very tame.
The late Mr. Erskine Allon was to have contributed an article on the

with considerable success. The Honorary Secretary would be glad to hear
from any member willing to write on this bird.
Our readers will doubtless have observed that the Magazine, which
contained twenty pages each mouth for the first six numbers of the current
volume, has last month and this month fallen back again to its old size of
sixteen pages. The reason for this is that while copy comes in to the
Editor fairly abundantly in the winter, during the summer mouths there
is a difficulty in obtaining articles. Will the members kindly 7 bear in mind
that anything which they write for the Magazine will be specially valued if
sent in during the next few months?
The recent large increase in the membership of the Society is very
gratifying, and reflects great credit upon the members who secured the new
recruits. Their success will doubtless spur them on to fresh exertions. It
is believed that the coloured plates are much appreciated and have been
the inducement to many to join the Society. We regret, however, that the
Secretary reports an unusually large number of resignations.
With regard to the article by the late Mr. AII011 which appeared last
month, and his observations upon the character and disposition of various
species, it would be well to bear in mind that he kept some hundreds of
birds flying loose together in one room, and that their behaviour under such
conditions would be likefy to differ considerably from what it would be
in a less crowded aviary. We are not for a moment suggesting that Mr.
Allon's bird-room was over-crowded in such a way as to be injurious to the
health of the birds, but it certainfy must have been over-crowded to an
extent sufficient to modify the habits of its inmates. This fadt does not
detract from the value of his observations, but it helps to explain why he
frecpiently differs from other observers.
Many of the County 7 Councils throughout the country have availed
themselves of the powers given to them by 7 the Wild Birds Protection Acts,
1894 and 1896, and the effect of their initiative is that over a large part
of England all the warblers and many other harmless insectivorous species
may not be taken, even by 7 the owners or occupiers of the land. It is
somewhat a misfortune that the law on the subject should vary-&apos; in different
counties, and a still greater misfortune that it should be so very 7 involved
and difficult to understand and remember -- but it seems to be the duty of
aviculturists to make themselves masters of it as it exists in the counties
in which they reside, and to do their best to help in its enforcement.
We would not suggest that our members should turn themselves into a
vigilance committee or act as informers, but they r might do much good
by keeping an eve on bird catchers, bird dealers and others, and if they
find them infringing the law, give them a friendly warning " not to do
it again " unless they 7 wish to be reported to the police.
As an instance of what has been done it may be useful to take one
district. The East Sussex County Council have passed a resolution, which
will doubtless be carried into effect by 7 an order of the Secretary of State,

BREEDING OF GREEN SINGING FINCHES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96420975" page_id="32635194"  page_num="149" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I n the first paragraph of a letter from Mr. Charles L. Rothera
in the May Number, re " Breeding of Green Singing Finches," he writes
that in my article to the Avicultural Magazine of February last I " apparently
claim to be the only successful breeder of these birds."
As I know but very few of our members, it would have been most
conceited on my part to lay claim to that honour, not knowing what the
remaining ninety-eight per cent, of members had done.
Considering that these birds bred as readily with me as Zebra Finches
did, I did not imagine that the occurrence of their successful nesting was
at all rare, until Iliad a letter from our Secretary, in which he said. "I
want an article on the Green Singing Finch for the Fringillinae series, and
as you seem to be the only member who has bred the species, I want you to
write it." I naturally concluded from this, that the circumstance of their
breeding was a little out of the common, and I commenced my remarks by
giving almost word for word this part of the letter that I had received.
W. T. Cateeugh.
I am not aware of any of our members besides Mr. Catleugh
having successfully reared the Green Singing Finch in captivity. If this
assumption is wrong, I should be very glad to hear from the other breeders.

THE TUI.
Sir, -- I was interested in Mr. Wiener's letter about the Tui. When
residing in New Zealand some years ago, I bought a pair from a native, and
kept them for some months. They were easily tamed and used to fly about
the room. They were amusing mimics of sounds and movements. The
hen escaped through an open window one day, and I never saw her
again. The cock I had for some time after, but he escaped at last, and
when he found himself in a fuchsia tree opposite my windows, he became
so happy that he declined to return at any price. I fed them entirely upon
boiled potatoes mashed up finely with plenty of sugar, and they were
perfectly healthy.
T. B. Whytehead.
GOULDIAN FINCHES.
Sir, -- I think, perhaps, my experience with a pair of the above may
be of interest to some of our members. I have but the two--a red-faced
cock and black-faced lieu. The former has been an inmate of my cages
for about two years, the latter eight months. To begin with, they are in a
cage very much over-crowded, and in the ever-varying temperature of a
kitchen, with windows North Polewards only&apos;. The inmates of their cage
include such restless creatures as Weavers. Yet, I have not only kept them
in perfect health under the conditions stated, but bred them -- with what
success you shall hear.
From 4th November, 1S96, to 3rd March, 1S97, twenty eggs were laid
as follows : -- 4th to 7th November, 4 eggs ; 7th to 10th December, 4 eggs ;
4th to 6th January, 3 eggs; iSth to 21st January, 3 eggs; 25th to 31st
January, 3 eggs; 22nd to 23rd February, 2 eggs; 3rd March, 1 egg.
During the above periods the hen never drooped a wing, or shewed any
signs of egg-binding.
The whole of the second clutch hatched-out, two dead and two alive.
On the morning of 24th December, a little dead body was found immediately
under the Gouldians nest. On Christmas morning this was repeated. Not
finding one 011 Boxing Day, my curiosity was too intense to put off having
a look into the nest. With the aid of artificial light and a little straining,
I discovered a little living body 7 and one egg. O11 the 28th, the young -- for
the other hatched-out alive, on the 27th I presume -- were making them-
selves heard when being fed. To mv utter dismay the parents were pairing
again on the following day (29th) so I felt sure the young would be deserted
or thrown from the nest. My^ fear happily proved groundless, and the mites
continued to make themselves heard, and the dutiful parents to feed
admirably. The 4th January saw one egg deposited beside the young, and
two more added in as many days, completed clutch three. These eggs I
witnessed beingpushed from the nest on the 16th, and two days later, clutch
four was commenced, and consisted of the same number. But the feeding
of the young was never neglected by either parent. It would be interesting
to learn whether other members have had the experience of seeing this
Finch lay and rear their young at the same time. Some will put it down
to over-stimulation, but they could not have had a more simple diet -- con-
sisting as it did of white millet and blue maw soaked, millet in the ear,
and egg food made of stale sponge cake and yolk of hard-boiled egg.
I had the pleasure of seeing a young Gouldian leave the nest on 21st
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.99611828" page_id="32635196"  page_num="151" year="" vol="">
January, an example followed by its little companion the next day (26 days'
old). The wings only were feathered, the bodies being quite bare, and
would not impress the most ardent bird-lover with their beauty. Canaries
leaving the nest at such a season, and similarly clad, would have little
chance of surviving. Simultaneously with the young leaving the nest did
the throwing-out of clutch four commence. This was pleasing, as the
parents would thus be able to devote their whole time to the young, who,
by this time, would not stay in the warm nest, most of their time being spent
in flying after one or other of the parents, beseeching to be fed. The
mother was more often applied to. The 5th February saw the young
feeding themselves (41 days old); three days later, through a vexatious
accident, one got drowned. All went well with the sole survivor, until 3rd
March, when it was apparent that all was not right. At first a pair of
Pintail Nonpareils, which came into 1113&apos; possession on 24th February, were
blamed for its indisposition. They having, just previously, taken a "ticket "
at the Palace, were not subjected to the term of quarantine imposed upon
all strangers whose past history is unknown to me. My suspicion was
much strengthened by the male Pintail dropping dead on 7th March,
followed, I much regret to write, by my young Gouldiau on the 8th, being
then 72 days old. Up to the 3rd, I never felt the least anxiety on its account,
being always sprightly, and in the best of health. I never doubted being
able to preserve it.
Mr. J. E. Dewar, of this City, to whom I gave its little bod}&apos;, certified
the cause of death as inflammation of the lungs, evidently caused by a
chill, and this is quite possible for it often bathed in cold water, and I 111a}&apos;
be wrong in blaming the Nonpareils.*
The male bird is presently moulting, but both are in the best of
health, and show no signs of being the very delicate subjects they are
so generally reputed to be. The}&apos; are my first favourites, and the last I
would part with of all my collection, which is at present somewhat
numerous.
Could any of our members tell me whether by preventing birds
nesting during our Winter (their Summer) would they nest during our
Summer (their Winter). If so, this would be a huge stride towards success.
Alfred Edward Nicholson.
THE VIOLET-EARED WAXBILL; FOOD FOR MYNAHS.
Sir,--A s they have been very scarce in England, I think some
account of my Violet-eared Waxbills may be of interest. I had had one
pair, and one or two odd birds, but for the last few years this kind have
been very difficult to obtain even here in Madeira ; last Autumn, however,
I was fortunate enough to get from one of the passing steamers, four
pairs, all very beautiful birds in splendid condition. I put each pair into
a separate good-sized cage, giving them a roomy nest basket. Early in
February they began to build, and worked very hard. One of the hens
laid four eggs, but made not the slightest pretence at sitting ; after ten days
she laid four more eggs, but took no notice of these either. Another hen
laid two eggs, then she and the male bird took turns at sitting, and relieved
*We really cannot see what ground Mr. Nicholson ever had for supposing the vonng
Gouldian died of an infectious complaint, caught from the Nonpareils. The yonng bird
must have been sickly from the beginning, or it would not have left the nest naked.--E d.

each other with the greatest regularity through the day--in the evening,
however, they both retired to a perch at some distance from the nest and
spent the night there.
I then let these two pairs of birds loose in a large out-door aviary
where they are busy building, but I fear will show no inclination to sit. I
have still two pairs in the house (one of the hens has laid three eggs) and
am carefully watching their movements, but fear the result will be much
the same. I should be very glad if any readers of the Magazine would
kindly tell me if they have had similar experience, or if they could suggest
anything which would be likely to induce the birds to sit. The Violet-
eared Waxbills are, in my opinion, the most beautiful of all the smaller
birds, and they become so perfectly tame in a few weeks that they are a
constant delight to their owners ; mine will all come and take small
mealworms, ants' eggs, or little sprays of feathery grass for building, from
my hand, and those which I have let loose in the aviary are just as tame
there as they were in cages, the} 7 fly to me the moment I enter. They are,
above all, most contented happy little birds; the hens sing a sweet soft
little song as well as the males; one of my hens has wonderful imitative
powers, and soon picked up the song of the Avadavats, and the clear call
note of the Cordon-bleu, so that we have named her " the little mocking
bird," and she is a great pet.
To go to another subject, if I may take up so much space! I should
be very grateful for advice as to the treatment of a Mynah--mine will not
eat meat, either cooked or uncooked, or mealworms, or insects of any kind,
neither does he care for fruit; he likes yolk of egg and bread and milk, and
will eat a little potato, but it seems to me such a big strong bird should
have something more sustaining.* L. C. Reid. (Madeira).
DOVEvS AND JACKDAWS.
Sir,--I recently put up a hollow log in a large ash tree in my garden
in the hope of attracting owls. In this I was not successful ; but a pair of
Jackdaws commenced a nest in it. I noticed that the material taken in by
the Jackdaws had gone, and the daws themselves appeared to have left the
neighbourhood. The opportunity appeared to be a suitable one for stopping
up a hole at the otherwise solid end of the log; which permitted the wind
to blow through it. On going up to it I could see some fibrous building
material, of a much finer nature than is selected by daws. While peering
in at the hole (which was only about three inches by two inches, I was
startled by a Pigeon flying out at the open end. A pair (no doubt Stock
Doves) have been about, and often in the tree for some time past. It
would appear that the Stock Doves must have destroyed the foundation of
the daws nest and driven them away.
Can any of our members corroborate or otherwise explain the
occurence ? Chas. Louis Hett.
* I have kept several species of Mynah ; they will feed on insectivorous and soft
food of almost any and every kind. But perhaps a Hill Mynah is referred to. I have had
the Larger and Smaller Hill Mynahs : they should be fed on cooked vegetables, fruit, egg,
raisins and slops generally. In this country they seem to require a little meat, but it should
not be forced upon them ; probably in a hot climate they are better without it.
As regards the Waxbills. When birds lay but do not sit, it is usually because their
house is too small or too much exposed. Put them into a large place, provide them with
suitable private nesting arrangements, do not disturb them, and they will probably sit all
right.--R.P.

Most of our readers will be familiar with the story of the
cockney who, on paying a visit in the country, was given a
freshly laid egg for breakfast, with the triumphant remark from
his hostess that he didn't get such eggs as that in Tondon.
" Haw," answered the cockney, "but it hasn't the flavour that
our London eggs have." There is no accounting for tastes, and
use is second nature, as the following story will further show.
Here in London, many are the noises that disturb our
slumbers; what with the barking of dogs, the caterwauling of
cats, and the crowing of cocks, we need a little acclimatising
before we can enjoy a good night's rest. Around this neighbour-
hood, moreover, we have other helpful influences to accustom us
to any and every row, such as the racing of early milk carts, the
whistling of locomotives, and the much louder, screechier steam
whistles at various works which, in the early morning, make life
a burden to all but the heaviest sleepers.
I, in my time, have lent a helping hand in acclimatising
my neighbours, esteeming the same to be a praiseworthy action ;
and virtue would have been its own reward if my neighbours
had only been a little more appreciative. Common Mynahs can
make a noise ; Hill Mynahs can make many noises. Piping
Crows have useful voices in this connection; four of these
musical creatures, Black- and White-backed, have enlivened my
garden, and welcomed the rising sun with the most joyous
cries--not always melodious, three of them doing their duty
manfully--the other womanfully. The labours of one of the
former is still gratefully borne in mind by those around. On
the other side of the garden wall was, and is, a Bantam that crowed
lustily and shrilly; one of the White-backs, a splendid fellow,
thought he could do one better, and would go up to that wall

and yell, and yell, and yell, until that wall ought to have tumbled
down--but it didn't, it still remains in fact. In addition to these
there have been Choughs and Crows, Hawks and Pies, Jay-
Thrushes and Laughing - Thrushes, Bell - birds and Barbets,
Parrots and Parrakeets, and countless others, all and several
rising early and doing their little best, led by a grand old Raven,
who habitually commenced before dawn. Then there have been
the birds who ofttimes turn night into day. Few sounds are
more wearisome than the ceaseless bleat of the Godwits; and
Curlews, Plovers, Oyster Catchers, and the like, all have their
little whistles and voices ; and when I say that I have had six
different species of Owls in my garden here, I think I have said
enough. Oh! the priceless value of the precious birds that I
have parted with because of the want of an avicultural education
amongst my neighbours !
Now, a few doors from this house there has been living
these nineteen years, and still lives, a stalwart, broad-backed
dame, who has kept our otherwise quiet street bountifully
supplied with comely lads and lasses, these again carrying on
the business, on their own account--perambulators and babies
still being common objects of their door-step. Evidently she is
fairly well acclimatised. The noises of the boys, babies, steam-
whistles, cats, dogs, cocks, etc., are, she says, natural noises, and
she and her husband do not hear them. My birds, she declares,
are her delight. She still has a lively remembrance of the Piping
Crow above referred to. If she has pleasanter recollections of
any one set of birds more than another it is of the Owls. She
tells me she used to say to her spouse, " There are Mr. Phillipps'
Owls screeching again ; it is going to rain." * Such an one as
this one might have supposed would have been equal to any
noise; but no : the down-trodden worm has turned at last; the
broad back has at length been broken ; and the straw that did
the mischief was--
The other evening this lady called and asked to see me.
The following account of the interview is very feeble : I find
myself quite unequal to the task of adequately reproducing the
scene.--"Well, Mr. Phillipps, how long is this to go on ? " I
meekly begged to be informed to what she might refer. "To that
horrible screeching noise made by that bird in your garden ;
night and day it never stops." "Noise! noisy bird in my

supposed to foretell rain ; but I never before heard that the cry of an}&apos; of

no ; it is screaming all day and all night ; we never have a
moment's peace ; it's perfectly dreadful; it's quite unbearable."
"I realty don't understand; besides, all my talking birds are
shut up every night in the house, so that they may not disturb
the neighbours in the mornings." "Oh! but there is some

of course, but that great thing which screams and whistles all
night long." Over and over again, but with lessening assurance,
she declared that she didn't mean the Nightingale, that it wasn't
a Nightingale, but some big screeching thing; Polly couldn't
sleep, and Betsy cried, and her husband was worn out, etc., etc.
There are few things that give my wife and myself greater
pleasure than this Nightingale. He is six years old, and has
been in song since January ; but, singularly enough, although
singing all day, he had not commenced to sing at night until
three nights previously. I had obtained a wife for him, and they
seemed bent on nesting ; our bed-room overlooks the aviary ;
and the notes of this bird (although not perfect, for it w 7 as hand-
reared), in the midst of the bricks and mortar, are to country-bred
persons like ourselves an exquisite delight. I enlarged upon
the privilege she enjoyed of sleeping (without extra charge)
within sound of the song of a Nightingale, of the heartless
cruelty it would be to disturb such innocent birds while nesting,
hinted at the absurdity of objecting to the song of a Nightingale,
the theme of numberless poets, and suggested that wdieu she told
her husband and Betsy and Polly and all the rest of them that it
was realty a Nightingale, they would one and all declare that its
notes were of the sweetest, and said that if she would bring them
round in the daj^-time they should have the pleasure of feeding
the bird out of their hands. She evidently thought that it would
not sound well if it got abroad that they had objected to the song
of a Nightingale, and beat as dignified a retreat as circumstances
would permit.
Far different is the story of the * Trentham Nightingale.
Two years ago, for the first time on record, a pair took up their
abode in a clump in the park; and the miners and pottery-hands
came in the evenings in their hundreds (I am told thousands)

from miles away, and passed the nights in the park, some lying
on newspapers and the rest on the bare ground (it happened to
be beautiful weather), for the special purpose of hearing the
Nightingale sing. Clearly, they are more civilized in the
Potteries than we are here in London. The Duke had the clump
fenced round, and did all he could to prevent the birds from
being disturbed ; but they have not since returned to Trentham.

MY AVIARY AND ITS INMATES.

By W. T. Page.
I cannot lay claim to much experience in aviculture--
though off and on for some years I have kept, in cages,
miscellaneous collections--more as an amusement than for
observation and study.
In September, 1895, I put up a small garden aviary, 15ft.
long, 2oPt. wide, 6ft. high, part open and part covered in--with a
small shelter shed at one end in addition, which the majority of
the birds scarcely ever use.
Its inmates consist of Chaffinches, Greenfinches,
Buntings, Canaries, Redpolls, Bramble Finches, Hedge Accen-
tors, Sparrows, Grey Java Sparrows, Ribbon Finches, Black-
faced Weavers, thirty-five in all, and they have lived together
in complete harmony. As regards food, I give one hopper of
mixed seeds as bought, and one each of canary and white
millet--with a liberal daily supply of sunflower seed and ants'
eggs on the ground, grit in tins, green food ad lib., grass in
flower, and mixed garden weeds--all stale green food being
removed daily--this gives variety and also insedt food, so
essential in keeping Finches and Buntings in health--and I
have proved one fa&amp;lt;#t, not generally accepted by ornithologists--
viz., that the above-named British birds will greedily eat the
gooseberry grubs and mature moths f Abraxas grossulariataJ as
many as you choose to give them. In detail--
Sparrows I have found very interesting, though wild and
noisy ; their quiet beauty requires to be studied under aviary life
to be appreciated--so viewed, a mature male is really a handsome
bird. I am convinced, from the preparation tlieyr made, they
would have bred with me this year, but owing to their being so
demonstrative at pairing time (though they did not fight,) I gave
them their liberty, as I was more anxious to breed the foreigners.
Hedge Accentors. I kept one pair for nine months, when

they wasted away during the moult--they seldom showed
themselves, hiding away when anyone was about. I consider
them unsuited to aviary life, and as uninteresting under such
conditions as it is possible for birds to be, and have certainly no
desire to possess others.
Greenfinches have not bred with me--though quite a
number of eggs were laid--but with so much company I do
not think open nest builders likely to succeed, they pull one
another's nests to pieces so, almost as soon as built. I have
found them quite inoffensive and pleasing occupants of my
aviary.
Chaffinches are charming, both as regards song, hardiness,
and vivacity. I have six or seven ; their colours, if not brilliant,
are so beautifully blended one with the other as to make the
effedt altogether pleasing ; and with their sprightliness under all
conditions, I should not care to be without them--they are
singing grandly now.
Bullfinches have not bred with me--my cock died suddenly
and without any apparent cause when they were preparing to
build, and when I procured another it was too late in the season;
they have now just commenced building, and I am hoping for
success this time--these, with their bright colours and affedtion
one for the other, if not gifted with a natural song, are charming
inmates of my aviary ; they enjoy a branch of willow, poplar, or
fruit tree for green food.
Java Sparrows, procured last July, did not breed, but
were full of life and activity, keeping themselves in beautiful
trim under all conditions ; they built this year and then went
into moult, but are now building again ; these are difficult to sex,
but thanks to the kind courteous information of Dr. A. G.
Butler, it is now comparatively easy. He showed me by living
specimens the details given in his article in the Magazine awhile
ago.
Ribbon Finches, obtained in July, nested in August,
and hatched out three young early in September, when the cock
died, being apparently quite healthy, and in the midst of the
above-named company. The hen successfully brought them up,
feeding them while in the nest exclusively on dried ants' eggs;
after they flew (and I watched closely) I never observed her
give them anything but millet, and fine strong young ones they
were, one cock and two hens, and I have them now, in the very
pink of condition. These birds have not been quarrelsome at
all, in fadt quite inoffensive.

Black-faced Weavers, procured when out of colour, proved
two cocks, so they have been simply ornamental. The}&apos;- are
interesting for the nests they build and the total dissimilarity of
summer and winter plumage. This change seems to be brought
about by the bursting of colour glands, which &apos;much resemble
pin feathers. They also at the same time moult the primaries.
They have been successfully wintered outdoors. They bathed in
frosty weather, not simply a splashing, but actually going into
the water and getting so soaked that the}&apos; - could scarcely fly up
to the perches, and they were none the worse, in fact at the
present time they are among the healthiest inmates of my aviary
--one just in colour and the other nearly so . . . and yet
one authority on foreign birds declared it would be cruel to
make the attempt and impossible of success--so much for
theories and theorists.
Bramble Finches, Redpolls and Buntings. I have only cocks
--these give variety to my collection, and are quite harmless--
the Bramble Finch is a beauty, he has moulted twice in the
aviary, and at the present is in splendid condition and feather.
One fadt concerning my Yellow Bunting may be of interest, I
found him boldly attacking a mouse, flying at it, bouncing upon
it with beak and feet, nor did he desist till he had driven his
enemy through the wires.
All the above have been kept in the space aforenamed,
and I have had only six deaths from the time I began
getting them together, up to the present (twenty months) . .
this speaks for itself as to the treatment given--and I am certain
they are happy from the way they sing: birds do not sing when
out of sorts. They are sometimes too noisy when you are in
close proximity to the aviary--heard from the house about ioo
feet away, it is delightful practically all day long, but they are
well looked after and fed as near to nature as possible. I have
just added a pair of Green Singing Finches to my collection--
these are beautiful birds and very sweet singers---I have them in a
small portable aviary, also outside. I shall add to my feathered
friends some of the rarer kinds, as I am able to increase my
accommodation . . . My experience up to present has only
given me appetite for more. There is one nuisance about outside
aviaries in London, and that is the cats--you can't be out all day ;
and there they sit, watching, hoping and longing. How I
should like to see them taxed and muzzled--then I am certain
we should, even in London, have many of our feathered
songsters freely nesting in our gardens.

"STURNUS TRISTIS" v. LOCUSTS.
By H. C. Martin.
That handsome Starling, variously known to English
dealers as the Brown Mynah, Mud Mynah and Common Mynah,
became known to me under somewhat unusual circumstances ;
and although my acquaintance with the species is only quite
casual, and I cannot claim to have properly studied it, I think
the reasons which led me to keep this bird for a time will be of
some interest to the members of the Avicultural Society.
The autumn of 1896 and the first months of the present
year in the Argentine and Uruguay were remarkable for the over-
whelming invasion of locusts which overspread these countries ;
and although this destructive and disgusting plague, of which
we here in England can scarcely form an idea, appears more or
less regularly every year in the River Plate, this time it has
been nothing less than a calamity to very many engaged in the
pastoral and agricultural industries, for so vast and widespread
a visitation has never occurred before as far back as can be
remembered. Crops devoured, gardens and orchards devastated,
pastures ruined for the time being, and cattle starving, even rail-
way trains delayed, was everywhere the tale, and the papers were
full of pars, about the dreaded "langostas," reporting the move-
ments of the "mangas" or swarms on flight, where they were
going, whence they came, what should be done against them,
etc., almost as though a real army were invading the land, and
suggesting endless ways of keeping the enemy in check.
A large firm owning very extensive " estancias " or stock
farms, comprising many leagues of "camp" in Uruguay,
requested me to obtain, as an experiment, a number of a certain
bird, known to the French as " le martin triste " and which,
according to the papers, had been introduced with much success
into Mauritius, Algeria and other French colonies to combat the
locust plague. I at first thought that the Rosy Pastor was the
bird, but wishing to make quite sure which was the species in
question, I wrote to the Director of the "Jardin d'Acclimatation"
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.637262142857143" page_id="32635204"  page_num="159" year="" vol="">
at Paris, who kindly replied :
" E'oiseau connu sous le 110111 de Martin - triste,
' Acridotheres tristis ,' est bien celui qui a ete introduit en Algerie
et k Madagascar pour la destruction des sauterelles ; " adding
that :
" C'est &amp; Maurice que les resultats les meilleurs ont etd

Having then satisfied myself as to the bird's identity and
appearance I accordingly commenced a search for this "sad
locust devourer," and at length, after a good deal of trouble, for
he does not appear to be a stock article with the dealers, found
just two hanging up in the rain outside a filthy east-end bird-
shop, and looking very sad indeed, poor things, in a cramped and
dirty cage, with hardly a drop of water and a diet of dirty boiled
potato and bread. The purchase was soon negotiated and I was
able to study my new friends. Fine powerful-looking birds they
were, in spite of their bad condition, a trifle superior in size to a
black-bird, and of a cinnamon brown ground colour deepening to
glossy black on the head, tail, and flight feathers, and fading to
dirty white on the belly, the undercoverts of both wings and
tail being also white. The patch of white on the wing, formed
by the flights having each an inch or so of this colour at the
base and noticeable only when the wing is open, and the sharp,
strong, orange coloured bill and thick yellow legs, together with
the little patch of bare yellow skin behind the eye, are striking
features in the bird's appearance, and when one sees their busi-
ness like walk and sharp searching glance, their relationship to
our English bird becomes very apparent. There was a pair in
fine condition, but not shown to advantage, at the last Crystal
Palace Bird Show.
Given a roomy cage and suitable food, the birds soon
picked up and were not slow to bathe and get their plumage into
better trim, and then it was not easy to understand why
Ivinuaeus called them " tristis " for more comical, lively fellows
one could hardly find. It was soon evident that the} 7 were a pair, for
the male would jump up beside his companion, puff out his
feathers, and stand up and bow in a most amusing fashion,
uttering meanwhile a curious guttural cry, mingled with a clear
whistle, and finishing up with a kind of purr to which the other
would respond with a contented chuckle. They were an
interesting couple and very tame indeed, but their stay with me
lasted only a few days, when with one more of their kind, all
that could be had at the time, they were taken out to Montevideo
by a gentleman travelling to the Plate, and duly liberated. I
found them very nice birds, but, owing to their tremendous
appetites, rather a nuisance to feed and clean when one has not
suitable indoor accommodation. With plenty of room I should
think a pair would make very interesting pets, as they appear
docile and hardy, and, from what I can gather, easily taught to
whistle and even speak.
As for feeding I found that little came amiss to them; potato,
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.982569590909091" page_id="32635206"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
i6i
bread, egg, fruit, worms and insects of anjr kind were all eaten,
more or less eagerly, but the greatest treat seemed to be meat,
raw or cooked, and particularly poultry. A chicken-bone hung
up in the cage was a source of constant enjoyment and was not
abandoned until it had been absolutely picked clean. This
greediness for a flesh diet may have been consequent upon the
previous poor living the birds had had to put up with, as I see in
last month's Magazine that a correspondent could not get his
" Mynah " (what species ?) to eat meat.
The birds seemed very fond of bathing and drank a great
deal of water.
Eventually, I was able to obtain a fair number of the
birds which were duly shipped, but only a few survived. They
have since been observed from time to time and appear to
be prospering, but the locust plague having disappeared for the
time being, partly through favourable weather and the fadt that
locusts are " out of season" so to speak, partly through the
attacks of a parasitic worm, (no doubt the larva of an ichneumon
fly,) the further introduction of " Stumus tristis " has been
given up, particularly as it is a very difficult matter to get the
birds intelligently looked after while at sea, which is perhaps the
greatest bar to their importation, and no doubt why one has to
pay from io/- to #1 for a bird which can be bought in Calcutta
for as little as 4d.
It remains to be seen whether the few individuals success-
fully received will increase their kind, as newly introduced species
sometimes do with rapidity, and become eventually a boon to
the country, but on the other hand it is a question whether we
can interfere with the dispensations of Providence in these
matters without calling down upon us a worse trouble (as witness
the experiments with the mongoose, sparrow, rabbit, etc.) and
half-a-dozen specimens of "Stumus tristis" multiplied by " x"
might eventually tire of locusts as a diet and find more congenial
sustenance in the fruit gardens, as the Rosy Pastor is said to have
done in Bourbon, where it was finally necessary to shoot him
without mercy.
The locust plague itself, it has been said, is largely due
to the land having been turned into pastures or cultivated, the
visitation never having attained such dimensions in the earlier
days of the country, and it is interesting here to remark that just
now River Plate " estancieros " have to contend with another
manifestation of nature's resentment against the disturbance of
her balance of power in the shape of a plague of "ticks,"
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998378525" page_id="32635207"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
which are so numerous that numbers of fine cattle succumb to
their exhausting attacks, while even horses are covered with
them--a rare occurrence. Would not a Starling be of some
use here also ?
It seems strange that there should be no native bird which
is an efficient natural enemy of the above two terrible inserts.
For the locusts I suggested trying the common Starling,
but he was considered too small to tackle them, though, in my
own opinion, the chief good would be done by the destruction of
the ova while in the soil, and of the non-flying larval locusts or
" saltonas," which, by the way, are the most dreaded for their
destructive powers, and a Starling of some sort is certainly the
bird needed for this. But perhaps it is as well that our speckled
friend has not found his way out there, for he should make a
sturdy colonist and would very likely oust a good many native
species.
In conclusion, I would remark that I was struck to
find what a curious likeness there is between the various kinds
of Indian Starlings. In the course of my search for " tristis ,"
I came across four distiuCt species which, to a casual observer,
seemed almost identical, and no doubt all would have been more
or less stiitable for the purpose. One, I think, was the Crested
Mynah ; another, the small Hill Mynah, and a third was precisely
like " tristis,&apos;&apos;&apos; but entirely dull black and lacking the bare skin
behind the eye ; the most noticeable point was that all had the
white patch on the wing and the white bar across the end of the
tail.
A FEW NOTES ON SOME NATURAL FOODS.
By C. S. Simpson.
The various dried seeds, prepared foods, and other things
which are sold for the feeding of our tame birds, are so cheap
and, in some respects, so good that we are in some danger of
losing sight of the fact that many foods which are to be had for
the mere trouble of collecting, are more nearly like the natural
foods which birds obtain in their wild state, and are, in that
respect, better than any artificial food can possibly be. There
are not very many of us who are altogether beyond the reach of
fields, or at any rate of a garden, and I am convinced that
almost everyone of us might with benefit make more use of
these natural foods than we do. I have not anything very novel
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.701698666666667">
to bring forward on this subject, but wish rather to remind our
aviculturists of the value of these foods.
1. Fresh Grass Seed. Most of us, I suppose, from time to
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9625425" page_id="32635208"  page_num="163" year="" vol="">
time, give our small finches a little of the common grass when
full of seed. This is probably the best of all foods for Waxbills
and Grass-Finches. They prefer it to any other seed, except
perhaps spray millet, and so long as it can be obtained, I would
advocate its use, not only occasionally, but as their principal
food. Cordon-bleus and other small birds which are delicate
when newly imported thrive wonderfully on this and (if they can
be obtained) fresh ants' eggs. My Gouldian Finches throve as
long as they had a good supply of this freshly gathered seed,
and I attribute ni} T little success in keeping them through the
winter, as much to the substitution of dried for fresh seed, as to
the influence of cold. Of course, in a town it is not always easy
to procure even so simple a matter as grass, but probably
most aviculturists could get a boy to colledt it at the cost of the
canary and millet seed saved.
2. Berries. The common red berries known as haws are
eagerly eaten by many parrots : nothing gives them greater
pleasure than to pull to pieces a bough of hawthorn, picking off
and eating the red berries. The Waxwing is ver}^ fond of them,
and bolts them whole. Elderberries are a favourite food of
Blackcaps. These are the only berries I have used much.
Possibly others would be equally useful.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7038215">
3. Chicktveed , when ripe and full of seed, is liked by
finches, though they prefer the grass-seed. I need only mention
groundsel, dandelion, and watercress.
4. Earwigs. These unattractive insedts abound, and are an
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.929769384615385" page_id="32635208"  page_num="163" year="" vol="">
unmitigated nuisance in most town gardens. Insectivorous birds
eat them greedily, and they seem to be perfectly wholesome.
Last summer, in a small garden, with very little trouble I
collected so many earwigs that I was able to save the cost of
several thousand mealworms, and this during the time of the
year when mealworms were scarce. The simplest plan of taking
earwigs is to place pieces of hollow cane among dahlias or rose
trees : earwigs and other insects colledt in these snug retreats
and may be blown out into a bottle.
5. Cockroaches. I need hardly mention these as most
aviculturists know their value. Birds will readily help them-
selves out of a " Demon" trap. For birds caged separately the
insedts may be picked out with a small pair of forceps.

6. Clothes&apos; Moths. I recollect some time ago reading
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990849279069767" page_id="32635209"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
some notes by an ardent aviculturist who advised the culti-
vation of the larvae of the common clothes' moth, and their use
as a food for ornamental finches. I have never ventured on the
experiment, but the plan will doubtless be found an excellent
one by those who do not object to an abundant supply of clothes'
moths in their dwellings. I believe the birds are very fond of
them.
7. Fresh Ants&apos; Eggs. I have elsewhere, on more than one
occasion, described a method of collecting these, and therefore
need only insist here on their great value for Waxbills,
Grassfinclies, and the more delicate insectivorous birds. The
difficulty of collecting them, however, places them beyond the
reach of most aviculturists.
8. Aphides, spiders, caterpillars, and flies are useful,
but cannot generally be collected so easily as earwigs and
cockroaches.
Perhaps I should apologise for taking up space in
the Magazine with these rather elementary notes, but in
aviculture, as in other matters, there is some danger of falling
into a routine, and this, I think, generally takes the form
of depending too much on the shop foods and uegledting the
more natural foods.
THE LINNET.
In a tower above the gateway of the old Cathedral close
Is a little leaded window of a chamber of repose,
And, outside it, hangs in sunshine and the gently passing air,
In its wooden cage, a linnet, with a song without compare:
Sweet is all its simple singing, and as sweet as if 'twere free,
And you know not what the value of its singing is to me,
In the Minster, in the lofty choir where the light but filters dim,
I hear the mighty organ and the deep and solemn hymn ;
I hear the fresh young voices, as in rapture, clearly rise
With the basses and the tenors in the splendid harmonies ;
And I love the choired singing, but my heart will ever be
With the little simple linnet that is singing there for me !
For he wakes in me sweet memories of the happy times of old,
And the greenery of the summer trees, and the fields of harvest gold,
And the peace of all the grazing herds, and the sheep-bell's soothing
charm,
And the dear old moss-roofed cottage by the orchard at the Farm ;
So you know now why the little linnet, singing there for me,
Dearer than the Minster's choiring to my heart will ever be !

CORRESPONDENCE.
A CHEAP FOOD FOR INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS.
Sir, --I shall be obliged if you could let me know if the dried insects
mentioned by Dr. Butler, on page 79 of the Magazine, are to be obtained in
England and where ? W. Oakey.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Oakey.
I have not heard of any dealer having imported the Indian dried
insects mentioned by me on page 79 of the Magazine; but Mr. Frank Finn,
of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, would be able to tell you definitely
whether any proposal has been made to arrange for the importation of
these insects. Now that ants' cocoons are so difficult to obtain at a
reasonable rate, they would undoubtedly be a great boon to us all.

Sir, --Perhaps some of our numerous members might be able to
identify, from the following somewhat imperfect description, a bird that
has been in my possession some months, and which I have been unable, so
far, to name.
Colour, bright gloss}&apos; black showing bluish reflection in the sun ;
around eyes, small ill-defined ring of white; both upper and lower mandible
black ; upper mandible covering lower, when beak is closed, on one side;
lower mandible covering upper on reverse side, so that action of beak
becomes exactly like a pair of scissors; culmen, high and fiat; iris, light
brown; legs, black; total length, 13m. ; tail, 7m.; tarsus, 5m.
He came from a well-known Loudon dealer, who told me that he
had never seen a similar one before. Whether the beak, which is
extraordinary, is natural, or is a deformity, I am unable to determine.
Thanking you in anticipation. RussERE Humphrys.
THE TUI.
Sir, --Mr. Whytehead writes that he kept some of these most
interesting birds for some months in New Zealand, feeding them entirely
on boiled potatoes mashed up finely with plenty of sugar.
This is a very interesting and for amateurs most valuable confirmation
of what I had heard from dealers and could scarcely credit.
Mr. Whytehead found his birds thriving on this diet in captivity.
That there was no mistake about this is proved by the fact that he kept
them for some mouths and that they then had energy enough left to escape,
and though quite tame, declined to return, which I should have expected
a weak and sickly bird to do.
I wish Mr. Whytehead had been good enough to say whether the
boiled potatoes were the dry mealy kind or the watery Dutch sort, whether
he used powdered lump sugar or moist sugar and in what proximate
proportion.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.996266163265306" page_id="32635211"  page_num="166" year="" vol="">
It does seem a puzzle to guess what a bird may feed on in the wild
state, who will only thrive on boiled potatoes in captivity.
If I had Tuis again, I should try one on a diet of meal)&apos; potatoes
mashed with plenty of moist sugar, and another on mashed mealy potatoes
mixed with condensed milk.
What may be sufficient nourishment in New Zealand may just be a
trifle deficient in our English climate.
It is hoped that this pretty and interesting bird may be seen in future
more often in the hands of amateurs, and reward their care by endurance
and robust health.
Communications, such as Mr. Whvtehead's, of practical experience in
keeping birds which are reputed delicate, will earn the thanks of all lovers
of foreign cage birds. AUG. F. WEINER.
PARROT FINCHES.
Sir, --These beautiful birds have been mentioned in several of the
recent numbers of the Magazine, and as I was unable to procure a pair until
last year, I have been much interested in the correspondence concerning
them. I have, at present, four specimens -- two an undoubted pair (now
nesting) -- the other two, much younger, are supposed to be a pair, and I
think tlie) r are.
1 fully concur with all that has been said regarding the difficulty in
distinguishing the sexes. In my undoubted pair, they are as near alike in
plumage " as two peas in a pod if there is any difference, the hen is the
brighter and better looking bird of the two. In the other pair, not yet in
adult feather, the one supposed to be the cock has more red on its head
and throat than the presumed hen, but as neither are yet adult, and the
supposed cock may be the older of the two, the extra amount of red mark-
ing it has cannot be taken as an infallible distinction of its sex. But a
marked difference -- a difference I have not seen mentioned in any notes
regarding the sexes--exists in both my pairs, i.e., the legs and feet of both
the hens (the undoubted and the supposed) are much lighter in colour than
those of the cocks. I noticed this in the first (adult) pair I received, and as
it occurs again in the second pair, I am inclined to think it may be a
distinctive mark, and should like to know if the same peculiarity has been
observed by anybody else possessing undoubted pairs. I do not think size
can always be depended upon as a distinction of sex, for a friend of mine
here has also a pair--they had eggs in January or early in February, this
year -- and the cock bird is the smaller of the two ; anyway, I have heard a
dozen times his pretty little note, as my male bird sings, while the other,
beyond the usual chirp, remains mute, precisely as my hen does--the
larger bird is, therefore, in all probability, the one that laid the eggs--
the hen.
A few notes as to how my adult pair have conducted themselves
since their arrival--early in October last--may interest our readers. Not
having had any experience with the species prior to then, and doubting as
to their being able to stand the winter in an outdoor aviary, I lodged them
in a small box-cage, fitted up with a box and rush nest sheltered by a small
branch, and in this cage they passed the winter, in the dining-room. A
little nesting material was also put in the cage. Towards the end of

November they commenced building in the rush nest and laid two eggs ;
they incubated them very little, and they were eventually thrown out on
the bottom of the cage and broken. A second nest followed in January and
met with the same fate. The}' are shy and restless birds in a cage, very quick
in their movements and easily disturbed, darting about when approached,
and I attribute the non-success in these two instances to the dining-room
not being private and quiet enough for them. The hen showed signs of
wanting to nest again last month, and as the weather was not very cold, I
turned them into my outdoor aviary of mixed birds. They soon began
nesting operations and are now sitting ; I have seen three eggs in the nest
(in a cocoa-nut husk) and fancy another has been laid since. The young
should hatch in a few days--if I am fortunate enough to get any--and I
shall take a peep as soon as I can without being seen by the parents.
I take the Parrot Finch to be one of the best of rare finches to nest
in captivity ; a bird anxious to live, and does his best to do so--quite a relief
after the apathetic and discouraging Gould. He is a frugal liver, feeding on
canary seed, white and spray millet, and greenfood--chickweed and above
all, flowering grass, given in abundance, roots as well, as soon as it can be
gathered by the road-side. I generally throw twenty or thirty fresh roots
into my aviary daily, and take away those of the previous da}- ; all the
birds, Parrakeets included, are very soon down among them.
The hen Parrot Finch, I have noticed, builds the nest, sitting in the
rush basket or husk, taking in the material as fast as her mate brings it to
her, and shapes a snug domed nest.
As regards ants' eggs, mealworms and such food, I have neverseen 1113^
Parrot Finches touch them, although the former are in the aviary all day;
but they eat a little hemp, and I don't think a few grains a day per bird
hurt them. A. Savage. I Rouen).
Sir, --I can now supplement my notes on Parrot Finches. The
nest to which I above referred has produced two young: they left the
nest last Saturday, June 12th, and are now beginning to feed them-
selves. They are mostly green in colour, dingy on the breast and vent,
very little red at the base of the tail, and a tinge of rather indistinct
yellow on the throat. The legs and beak are yellow or amber, and the
beak has a dark streak towards the point. They appear strong and lively,
and seem to be doing their best to live, continually crying for food,
following their parents and trying to feed themselves. I still hold this
finch, more than ever, as one of the best of rare or expensive birds to keep
in the aviary, and can thoroughly recommend him. Mine have nested in
an aviary with some thirty mixed birds, from Parrakeets down to Waxbills,
without any fuss or trouble. I said in my previous notes that they did not
eat ants' eggs or mealworms ; they did not until the young were hatched, but
then they partook of them freely,* also milk-sop ; it is as well, I think,
therefore, to supply all, especially when they have young.
I have at present three young Many-coloured Parrakeets in the nest,
about a fortnight old, and all doing well, so far.
A. Savage. (Rouen).
* B3&apos; " freely," I allude to the ants' eggs. They have about half-a-dozen meal-
worms a-day.

Sir, --I should be very much obliged if you would kindly let me
know what is the best food for an Orange Troupial, also a Blackcap. I am
now giving them both : egg mixed with powdered biscuit, ants' eggs, meal-
worms, currants, banana, and oranges. But I should be glad to know of a
food that would nourish and yet not fatten , as most foods do, I think.
Mr. Abrahams recommends his food, but as the staple ingredient
appears to be pea-meal it does not recommend itself to me.*
If you will give me some advice I shall be very grateful. Also how
many mealworms per diem would you give ?
Mary Appeeford.
The following replies were sent to Mrs. Appleford :--
Doubtless Brazilian Hangnest. It is an insectivorous bird, and
specially keen after caterpillars, and also takes fruit. Mine used to fly
loose in aviary and help themselves to anything they liked ; nothing was
provided specially for them. Give insectivorous food, insects if obtainable,
or a few mealworms, milk sop, and occasionally a little fruit; also fig, dates,
raisins, etc., now and then. It is a very cute bird ; and will help itself to
the best it can get, and will not starve itself to please anybody.
Reginald Phileipps.
The food for Blackcaps is hard-boiled egg and ants' eggs in equal parts,
and a little scraped raw beef, also mealworms and any insects that can be
got. They do best in a fair-sized cage, and require water for bathing, care
being taken that they do not take cold after it.
J. Lewis Bonhote.
THE SCARLET IBIS.
Sir, --I should be glad of any hints on the management of the
Scarlet Ibis. I have just bought one, and he seems to do well on Spratts'
food, worms, green food, &amp;c.
Will these birds stand our winter in an unheated aviary ? Are they
good tempered, and do they make any loud noise ?
Mine is quite young, and is huffy pink on the body with some brown
feathers on the head, neck, and breast. How long will he be before he
gets his scarlet feathers ? How can j'ou tell the sexes ? He seems a nice
docile bird but a voracious feeder and inclined to be messy.
A. A. Thom.
* I believe there is not a particle of pea-meal in Abrahams' Food. I don't know
what the basis is, but have always believed it to be coarsely ground Indian corn.
Nevertheless, pea-meal is very wholesome.--A. G. B.

THE BLUE-WINGED GREEN HONEYSUCKER.
By Russell Humphrys.
The Blue-winged Green Honeysucker or Bulbul (Chloropsis
hardwickii ),* is an inhabitant of the S.E. Himalayas, from Nepal
to Bootan, spreading south to the hill ranges of Assam, Sylhet
and Ci&apos;akan. As will be seen from the illustration this bird is of
most gorgeous plumage, the prevailing colour being a bright,
metallic green, the forehead and crown is yellowish green, the
throat deep purple with a stripe of bright blue from the beak to
the side of the neck, the breast and abdomen are of a rich orange
hue, the tail and flights of the wings being deep blue. The legs
and feet are slate colour, the beak stout and curved. Total
length about seven inches. Contrary to many brightly plum aged
species, these birds are gifted with vocal abilities of a very high
order. As inmates of a bird-room they are perfection, although,
a separate cage is a sine qua non owing to their somewhat bellicose
disposition.
The male represented in the illustration has been in my
possession some twelve months, and whether I was unusually
lucky in obtaining an abnormally healthy bird, or whether it is a
characteristic of the species, I am unable to say, but of all the
birds that have at one time or another occupied my aviaries,
none have given less trouble than the Honeysucker. By no
means susceptible to cold, easy to cater for, and of a confiding
though timid disposition, this bird is, par excellence, an interesting
study for aviculturists.
These birds should be kept in roomy cages, provided with
several perches of different sizes, and a large tin for bathing
should always be available. Am I correCt in stating that some
little time ago Mr. Fulljames, in one of his interesting and highly
instructive articles in a contemporary, said that his example
of this species never bathed? Mine, on the contrary, has never

missed his bath from the day he was bought, and all through the
recent winter, in spite of the room being occasionally at 40* or
thereabouts, has thoroughly drenched himself daily. I cannot
help thinking that it is owing to this propensity that he keeps
himself in such excellent trim. These birds moult towards the
end of June, and are in full feather by the end of September.
Being soft feathered, great care should be exercised in moving
them about, as the first time that my bird was handled, a handful
of feathers was left wdien he was released. He occupies one of
the lightest corners of the bird-room, as, in common with the
majority of brilliant coloured species, he would no doubt rapidly
become dingy and fade if kept in a sombre light.
His diet consists of potatoes, well boiled, passed through
a sieve and mixed with yolk of egg and a few ants' eggs, with a
fresh banana daily, (the latter item is essential as these birds are
almost entirely frugivorous), twice or three times a week a few
well scalded kitchen currants are added, of the latter they are
especially fond. For some considerable time after the bird
arrived a piece of orange used to form an important item of the
daily fare, but latterly it has been omitted as experience has
proved it to be unnecessary if not actually injurious. Meal-
worms he will not touch, but is exceedingly dexterous in catching
unwary blue-bottles and flies that stray near the bars of his
cage.
This individual bird is perhaps the most accomplished
mimic that has ever inhabited my bird-room. The flnte-like
notes of the Blackbird, the melodious song of the Thrush, the
plantive carol of the Robin, or the guttural chirp of the House
Sparrow are repeated with equal facility and accuracy. I well
remember one morning in the early summer of last year,
hearing, as I imagined, a Blackbird in a great state of alarm in
the immediate vicinity of the bird-room ; thoughts of stray cats
flashed across my mind and hurrying, gun in hand, to the aviary
(I hope members of the Avicultural Society who are proud
possessors of priceless long-haired "kitties" will forgive me)
eagerly sought the assumed, unwelcome intruder, but neither
cat nor Blackbird was to be seen ; a few^ seconds afterwards the
mystery was explained ; the frightened Blackbird was the Blue-
winged Honeysucker who was apparently amusing himself by
practising his extraordinary power of mimicry at my expense !
Since his return from the recent Palace Show the song of
the Canary is occupying his undivided attention.
Very few of these beautiful birds come into the market,

and they are consequently a somewhat expensive luxury when
procurable, but those who have been fortunate enough to secure
a specimen of Chloropsis hardwickii will, I have no doubt, agree
that as inmates of a bird-room they are all that could be desired.

(Geopelia cuneataj.
By O. Ernest Cressweee.
The "Diamond Dove," as it is now almost exclusively
called by importers, is a Dove of many names. I find it called
also the " Speckled Ground Dove," and the " Graceful Ground
Dove," and occasionally, and not inaptly, by those who have
knowm it in its wild state, the " Red-eyed Dove." It is certainly
one of the smallest and most elegant of the vast Columbine tribe.
I can never quite make up my mind which is the most attractive,
this or the tiny "Harlequin" Cape Dove (CEna capensis). To
whichever the palm of beauty and elegance may be given, the
Diamond Dove has the advantage of being by far the hardier
bird. The first description of it which I can recoiled! to have
read, and which filled me with the desire, for many years
unsatisfied, to possess a pair, was that of Sturt, one of the
earlier Australian explorers. He wrote, " All that we read or
imagine of the softness and innocence of the Dove is realized
in this beautiful and delicate little bird. It is very small, and
has a general purple plumage approaching to lilac. It has a
bright red skin round the eyes, the iris being also red, and its
wings are speckled over with delicate white spots. This sweet
bird is common on the Murray and Darling, and was met with
in various parts of the interior, but I do not think it migrates to
the North-West. Two remained with us at the Depot, in lat.
39 0 40&apos;, long. 140*, during a great part of the winter, and on one
occasion roosted on my tent ropes near a fire. The note of this
Dove is exceedingly plaintive, and is softer, but much resembles,
the coo of the Turtle Dove." I may here say, in passing, that I
have gained a good deal of bird-lore from the books of earlier
travellers, especially from those who give notes of the night
temperatures of hot countries, which are frequently far lower
than is generally imagined. The modern traveller, unless a
professed naturalist, is generally in by far too great a hurry to
observe or to record such commonplace fadts.
Gould says of this Dove, " Its natural food being the seeds
of grasses and leguminous plants, it is observed more frequently

oy the ground than among trees. I sometimes met with it in
small flocks, but more often in pairs or singly. It runs over the
ground with a short bobbing motion of the tail, and while
feeding is so remarkably tame as almost to admit of its being
taken up by the hand ; and if forced to take wing, it merely flies
to the nearest trees, and there remains motionless among the
branches until it again descends to the ground. I not un-
frequently observed it close to the open doors of the huts of the
stock-keepers of the interior, who, from its being so continually
before them, regard it with little interest. The nest is a frail
but beautiful structure formed of the stalks of a few flowering
grasses, crossed and interwoven after the manner of the other
Pigeons. It utters a rather singular note which at times very
much resembles the distant crowing of a cock. The eggs are
white and two in number, eleven-sixteenths of an inch long by
seven-sixteenths broad. The sexes, although bearing a general
resemblance to each other, may be readily distinguished by the
smaller size of the female, by the browner hue of her wing
feathers, and by the spotting of their upper surface not being so
numerous or so regular as in the male."
These descriptions are no doubt accurate ones of the
habits of the Diamond Dove in its native wilds. I will supple-
ment them with my own experience of the Dove in captivity.
Its appearance is best shown by the illustration. The head and
breast are French grey or lavender ; the tint of the back and
wings is very peculiar, as if an olivaceous wash were put over
the under lilac colour and were then studded w T ith little diamonds.
The back and wings of the hen are of a decidedly darker hue
than those of the cock, almost umber, and the diamond-like
marks are fewer and fainter. The under-parts and under-side
of the tail of both sexes are of a beautiful pearl-gre3U Certainly
the beauty of Doves is seen from below as well as from above,
for the under-tints of their tails are almost universally soft and
lovely. The little flesh-coloured feet of the Diamond Dove are
also peculiarly pretty.
Diamond Doves have bred in captivit)&apos;. I have not ui} r self
been fortunate enough to rear any, but rather from having too
many Doves in my aviaries than from the difficulty of inducing
them to breed. For the small Doves I find very shallow baskets,
either securely fixed in bushes or on wooden brackets, are the
best nesting-places; and for nesting-stuff I give the withered
green of bulbs or of rock-plants. It is usually soft and pliant,
and Nature provides it just when the Doves should nest. They

like to make their rough little nests themselves, often on strange
and dangerous ledges, and I find it useless to give them the
elaborate nests of other birds. If once they go to nest they
almost invariably sit well, hatch out their eggs and duly
feed their young for about twelve days ; then they go to nest
again, the young are neglected, become weak in the legs, and
die just before they should feed themselves.
Of the hardihood of this Dove I have had some personal
experience. It is curious how the naturalists of fifty years and
even twenty-five years ago thought that every bird which comes
from an ordinarily hot climate must necessarily require similar
heat at all times of the year to thrive. Dixon wrote, about 1850,
of this Diamond Dove, "One elegant little Dove found by the
same explorers in the same heated deserts, can hardly be got
through a British winter in a snug cage in a warm room." I
kept a cock through three bitter winters in an unheated outdoor
aviary ; though I must confess that his hen died on a day of
memorable cold. I regretted the experiment, though this little
cock always looked the pidture of health and happiness; now all
my small Doves go out of doors in May, and in October migrate
back to large cages in a fairly cool bird-room. Many little
Doves, which for years have borne the cold well, show signs of
feeling it in old age and should be treated according^.
I feed them all chiefly on canary seed with a little white
millet, and hemp occasionally in winter. The flight of the
Diamond Dove is most elegant and rapid, and I must warn
aviculturists that they have a wonderful knack of darting out
over one's head as one enters the aviary. They have, however,
strong homing instindts, and I have hardly ever failed eventually
to recover an escaped Dove.
Within the last few days I procured a fresh pair of
Diamond Doves. They had been kept for some time in a cage, and
when they arrived at midday, were stiff, and, when I put them
into an aviary, could not fly up ; in two hours they had regained
the use of their wings, and by 6 p.m., as I went carelessly into
the aviary, the cock darted over my head like an arrow into some
tall willows far below. It was doubtless his first flight since the
days of his liberty in Australia, so I gave him up for lost, and
was really too busy to watch him. Still he stayed about; was
seen the next day on a sunny bank among dry grass, and within
forty-eight hours from his escape, returned close to the aviary in
which he had not been six hours, and almost at once went into a
cage brought for him ! . Of course, when the land or houses of

others are near there is danger, but where all the surroundings
are one's own I find it best to take little notice of escaped Doves ;
after two days they are sure to be hungry--then I have doors of
empty aviaries all left open and seed put down, and the result, as
I have already said, is almost invariably the same : the truant
comes back, and is delighted to live in luxury again.
Certainly the Diamond Dove is a charming and fascinating
pet, and one which, from its not having frequently reared its
young in captivity, leaves much scope for the skill of the bird
charmer. Its price in these days is very moderate, compared
with a few years ago.

DIFFICULTIES.
By Reginald Phieeipps.
My garden aviary can be divided into two parts, or used as
one, as may be desired ; the part next to the house is bare--thanks
to the Parrakeets, but the other is thickly planted with small trees
and shrubs. In this latter I commonly place a few pairs of little
birds, in addition to the larger species, which are my favourites.
Amongst the little ones there were last summer a pair of
imported Zebra Finches, who, like so many of the Australians,
did not commence building until the autumn. The first nest,
built amongst some Virginia creeper which was rapidly losing its
foliage, was interesting, inasmuch as it was perfectly open,
without covering or back ; it was seen by a well-known writer on
birds, who spontaneously remarked that every nest of the Zebra
Finch he had ever seen had been covered ; and so we are always
told--but how many of these nests have been built in a natural
bush ! Long before the nest was completed, the bad boy of the
family, the Satin Bower-bird, himself an irrepressible carrier of
twigs and straws, had noticed the labours of the Zebra Finches,
watched the nest, and carried off the eggs as soon as deposited.
After a pause and a consultation, a second nest was commenced,
this time in a pollard holly off which every bough had been
lopped, on the top of the stump, and protected by a fairly thick
growth of young shoots, about a foot long, above and around the
nest. This nest, as originally constructed, was quite open ; and,
notwithstanding the leaves, the brilliant little eggs were only
too conspicuous; but the Bower-bird never went near this
nest: the many prickly leaves and the absence of perching
accommodation kept him at a distance. Nevertheless, the eggs

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998916909090909" page_id="32635224"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
did disappear ; and the parents were much disconcerted. They
evidently knew who the culprit was, and considered how best to
frustrate his plans. Suddenly they set to work to build a canopy
over the nest and for a few days quite separate from it and
unattached, but eventually connected with the nest proper.
Again an egg was laid; and I found it thickly covered over
with feathers, and invisible. When we were youngsters, we
were all keen after birds' eggs; not a nest could escape our
sharp, well-trained eyes, and the birds had a poor time of it;
and I well remember finding a Long-tailed Tits' nest in which
the first egg laid was most carefully concealed in a similar way,
and doubtless for a similar reason. As with that nest so with
this, when the second egg was laid no attempt was made to hide
either. On the laying of the first egg, the larger birds had been
shut out from the inner aviary; they were now re-admitted ;
but the covering sufficed to hide the eggs from the unknown
thief; and by the time the fourth egg appeared the nest had
become an ordinary domed affair, shaped like that of a Willow Wren.
However, occasionally I noticed the sitting female creep like a
mouse on to the roof, and stealthily strengthen and repair the
same. At the time I thought she was trying to keep out the
pelting rain; but one day in November I heard the wild excited
cries of the S truth idea f Struthidea cinereaJ, and, rushing out,
found that these two birds, regardless of holly pricks, had
pounced on to the top of the nest, and, frantically tearing at the
structure, were endeavouring to force their way in : they were
too mad to notice the entrance to the nest. I drove them away,
and was surprised to find the tiny mother still on : she had kept
her ground regardless of the uproar and the proximity of her
dangerous foes, who would have torn her to pieces if they could
have caught her. Her bravery and devotion so touched me that
I shut off the large birds, and left her to enjoy a well-earned
peace. Three out of the four eggs were hatched ; but before
the young were twelve days old an exceptionally heavy and
lengthy gale with torrents of rain killed them. Another nest
was then built on the top of the first, and an egg was laid on
December 24th ; but the wet and south-westerly gales were too
much for the birds, who deserted the nest on New Year's Day.
A new nest, however, was immediately commenced among some
Virginia creeper stems facing N.E., and completely sheltered
from the then prevailing winds ; but, after the first egg had been
laid, observing that the female had had enough of the cold and
wet, and fearing egg-binding, I took her and her husband off to
a large cage in the house, 6ft. long by 2ft. by 2ft. While in this

cage, neither bird betrayed the very smallest inclination to nest;
their hearts were evidently in their old home in the wet, cold,
raw garden.
About the middle of February, wanting their cage, I
returned them to the garden ; they flew straight to their last
nest, and immediately set to work to put it in order. This one
had been built with a dome from the beginning, and differed
considerably from the one in the holly tree, being shaped like
that of the Common Wren, especially as regards the aperture.
Notwithstanding the leafless season, it was admirably concealed ;
the Struthidea and other birds never found it, excepting only
the Bower-bird, who was removed. The young were hatched ;
but on March 17th I found them all dead--the consequence of
the incessant cold and wet. Once more the poor birds paused in
order to reconsider the situation. They had outwitted the Bower-
bird, diddled the Struthidea, and outmanoeuvred the south-west
wind; but the ceaseless, pitiless rain had been too much for them.
What was to be the next move ?
Now, although there were many husks and boxes of
various kinds scattered about their aviary, and one in the cage
they had occupied when in the house, not one of these had they
ever entered or visited : even as sleeping-places, all these had
been ignored ; the natural trees and bushes alone had had
attractions for them. But things were not as the}&apos;- had been in
Australia; the seasons, somehow, were all topsy-turvy; and
other arrangements would have to be made. Nothing would
now satisfy the Zebra Finches but an abode in some artificial
structure, and under the shelter of the house if possible,
notwithstanding that, at that time, they were cut off from the
house excepting from sunrise until such time as I let the
majority of the birds out of the bird-room, i.e., until S.30 a.111. or
later, according to the weather. Morning after morning they
collected a quantity of nesting-material on a little sheltered
ledge at the entrance to a barrel fixed against the side of the
house, and day after day it was scattered to the winds by the
Bower-bird. After a while, I confined them altogether to their
own aviary, and there they went house-hunting, but here also
now only in sheltered artificial structures ; most of the nesting-
places were given up one after the other because they seemed to
be too well known, or coo near to the favourite perches of the
old Chinese Blue Pie, who just then had to be placed with
them. Eventually, they fixed on a spot in the very roof of
the aviary, where, indeed, there was a shelter but little more, so

their efforts to build a nest upon nothing did not come to much.
Here, with much difficult}', I managed to fix up an old travelling
cage, of which they immediately took possession : and here,
with a box full of young, we will leave them, sheltered from the
rain, in a place quite inaccessible to the larger birds, but
somewhat exposed to the winds ; and here, if they will learn one
lesson more, that the best time for nesting is during our summer,
they may securely rear young to their hearts' content.
I do not wish to lead our younger aviculturists astray,
so will add that, although I did inspect these nests from time to
time, I did so with my " brains; " and also that, if the birds had
been of value, I should not have inspected the nests at all.
Birds generally are not like Canaries and Barbary Doves ; for the
most part they like to believe that you are wholly unconscious
of the existence of their nests. Zebra Finches, moreover, are
notorious for the promptness with which they often desert their
nests if inspected ; but my little lieu, indeed most of my birds,
regard me as their friend and protector, as a convenient and
comfortable resting-place, and my hat and my ears as particular
delicacies provided specially for their benefit and edification.
SAND GROUSE.
By E. G. B. Meade-Waitdo.
The Sand Grouse family form a group of birds of
singular beauty, and one which, with proper management
and accommodation, thrive exceedingly in confinement. It might
be supposed that birds which live either on burning deserts or
in such inhospitable regions as the Pamirs or Gobi deserts,
subject to the greatest extremes of heat and cold, would not
lend themselves to the comparative confinement and immense
change of surroundings of an aviary in this climate. Never-
theless, they not only live for years and maintain the most
perfect health, going through their curious seasonal changes of
plumage regularly, but they will nest and successfully rear their
young. Sand Grouse become most exceedingly tame in an
aviary, and some individuals of the Black-breasted Sand Grouse
(Petrocles arenarius) are among the only birds I have had who
had no objection of any kind to being picked up ; standing still
when approached and allowing themselves to be taken up
without a struggle ; the same birds would chase my small
children and peck their heels !
Sand Grouse inhabit the desert regions of Africa, also

<bodyText confidence="0.999121255813953" page_id="32635227"  page_num="178" year="" vol="">
suitable regions in Asia. Two species inhabit the inhospitable
plateaux of the Pamirs and Gobi desert, and one species Madagascar.
It is the Sand Grouse of the Gobi desert that has sporadically
visited this country and Western Europe, notably in the years
1863 and 1888, in large numbers, and is known as Pallas' Sand
Grouse (Syrraptes paradoxus J.
Two species of Sand Grouse are European and inhabit
principally the suitable parts of Southern Spain, but are very local
in their distribution. These are the Sand Grouse I fancy to be most
suitable for aviaries in this country, and they are certainly amongst
the most beautiful of their kind. Anything more beautiful than the
male of the Greater Pin-tailed Sand Grouse (Petrocles alchataj
in his full breeding-dress of sage-green and cream colour with
vivid contrasts of black and white and chestnut, put together
with the greatest contrast, is difficult to imagine. Whilst his
female, in her dress of bright sand colour with delicate peucillings
of black and slate-blue, is hardly less beautiful. It is to this
species that I especially wish to refer.
Except during the periods of laying, sitting, and whilst
the young are small, Sand Grouse are very quiet birds, and, as
far as I can see, never interfere with any other inhabitant of their
aviary. In fadt, it is necessary to see that nothing molests them.
They do not require a large aviary, and the description of
one that I find very suitable may be of use to those who
might contemplate keeping these beautiful birds. Mine
are in compartments 20ft. long by 8ft. wide ; six feet of
one end is roofed in with a double span roof, and is
boarded on three sides, the fourth side, that with the southern
aspect, opening into the outer compartment, is open to the
eves, which are 8ft. from the ground. The outer compart-
ment is of short turf, with a thoroughly drained gravel path
round it: it is on this path that the Sand Grouse spend most of
their time in wet weather, but in fine weather much time is
spent basking on the turf. The floor of the covered-in portion
should be the groiaid : this will become hard and dry from being
roofed over, and will be much resorted to for feeding, dusting,
etc., in wet weather, but almost never for roosting in, for how-
ever inclement the weather may be, they will invariably pass the
night in the most exposed place they can find, and no weather
seems to inconvenience them much, except perhaps continued
cold wet. They will never try to avoid the hottest rays of the
sun, and I have seen them dusting comfortably in 25 degrees of
frost.

To prevent them from injuring themselves, it is advisable to
cut the feathers of their wings; and a good wa}^ to do this is to
leave the first and second primary in each wing perfedt, cut half
the third so as to make a support for the first and second, and cut
the remaining seven primaries in each wing : this means
there is no disfigurement whatever and the birds do not turn
over in their attempts to fly, they can fly a little but do not
dash with sufficient force to injure themselves.
The height of the outer compartment of the aviaries
.should be not less than 8ft., and the same to the eaves of the inner.
There should be no high ledges, for Sand Grouse are very
awkward at getting over anything: and the turf should be only
raised a little above the gravel path. The turf will require
renewing once a year. The outer compartments should be
boarded about one foot high all round, as a shelter from winds
and to prevent birds from running up and down in one place.
Of course other birds that are not antagonistic may be
kept with the Sand Grouse during the breeding-season : a pair
of small waders (I have Pratincoles in with mine), and a pair or
two of any small passerine bird.
A great variety of food is eaten: of seeds the favourites
are hemp, maw, spray millet, and rape. Green food is as
necessary as seed, and they live largely on it. The favourites
are sorrel, hops, clover, shepherd's purse, chickweed, dandelion ;
and they eat short turf like a goose. Rock salt should be always
before them, and a plentiful supply of crushed egg-shell and
sharp grit.
The nesting-season commences in May, but breeding
pairs should be separated in April. Three eggs form the full
clutch, and are laid with the interval of a day between each.
Both sexes incubate, the female sitting by day, and the brightly-
plumaged male by night; the eggs are never left at all. The
young are hatched on the twenty-fourth day, and are most
beautiful little creatures, extremely advanced even on the day of
their birth, dusting and foraging for themselves ; they feed on
the half-ripe seeds of various plants, that of chickweed and
shepherd's purse being the favourites : also mawseed. They are
covered with chocolate and cream-coloured down of a very
curious texture, each tuft on the back resembling a small Ostrich
feather. At ten days old these independent little birds refuse
to be brooded by their parents, and seek out a place among the
stones to roost by themselves.
I have elsewhere described the curious way in which these
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998511159090909" page_id="32635229"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
birds are watered by their parents, but there may be some who
have not read it. The cock, as soon as the young are hatched,
developes the following curious habit: He rubs the feathers of
his breast up and down on the hard ground until they are all
awry ; he then soaks himself in his drinking-water, goes to the
young, calls them, and they suck the water from his breast.
The reason of this is obvious : Sand Grouse, although they live
and breed on comparatively waterless deserts, cannot exist
without water, and traverse immense distances morning and
evening to drink, being able to do this by means of their unrivalled
power of flight. The young, hatched far out on waterless plains,
would certainly perish for want of water were it not for this
extraordinary habit in the males. Rubbing the feathers doubt-
less makes them saturate more freely, and not dry too soon
on the voyage from the drinking-place to where his family is
located.
After the breeding-season, I let all my birds run together
by allowing them to pass from one aviary to another, and their
play then is very amusing: running after one another in play,
and " butting " with their shoulders. Their actions also when
dusting are very curious, as they roll on to their backs and dust
with their shoulders, keeping both feet np. The tiny newly-
hatched young of an hour or two old will do this. The gravel
path that surrounds the turf lawn in their aviary should be of a
kind of gravel that binds well, for if the hole they scratch silts
up, they will have nothing to do with it.
I could write much more on these birds, but fear to
trespass further.
CORRESPONDENCE.
THE TUI, AND OTHER POLUEN-EATING BIRDS.
Sir,-- There have been several letters in the Avicultural Magazine
during the past few months regarding the treatment of these delightful
birds. Most of the writers have laid stress upon the reputed delicacy of
Tuis, and especially upon their liability to lay on fat and to become subject
to fits. At the same time we have been advised to feed on condensed milk,
mashed potatoes, sweet biscuit powder, sugar in plenty, and other articles
of diet which certainly would not be allowed in the case of a human
subject under anti-fat treatment.
My object in writing is to note that apparently Tuis can be kept in
the best possible condition, as regards health and plumage, upon a diet
which certainly seems to be less likely, than some of the foods lately
prescribed, to induce the accumulation of fat, which is so much to be
avoided if possible. At the same time, I wish to be careful to state that
the birds under notice have only been in my possession for four mouths.

My Tuis, a male and female, were part of a consignment which reached one
of the London dealers earl} r this spring, and were advertised in the
Avicultural Magazine. When they reached me they were, though stained
and shabby, in good health and vigorous ; and so I am glad to say they
remain up to now.
They are fed on stale bread-crumb about two parts, Abraham's
mixture one part, moistened slightly with a little grated carrot. A little
preserved yolk of egg is added, and a dash of Carl Capelle's food and ant's
eggs ; the last two not quite regularly, but several times a week. The
whole of this, the preparation of which only occupies a few minutes, is
thoroughly mixed, and pounded up in a mortar, and, of course, enough
only is prepared to carry the birds through the 24 hours. No mealworms
are given, and no extras of any kind, except that each bird has daitya piece
of banana or ripe orange, which is given to them while their cages are
being cleaned out--though such a thing is not wanted now ; when the
birds were strange to me the gift of these dainties had a great effect in
taming them. I only give them enough fruit in this way to occupy them
for a few minutes, during which time it is amusing to see the clever way in
which they use their long tongues.
In other ways too I think this amount of fruit has a wholesome effect
upon birds which are being kept upon a diet which, as compared with what
they get in a wild state, is of dr}4 and what a school-boy would call a
"stodgy," character.
My birds under this treatment have moulted clean out, and have a
lovely sheen upon their feathers, and they always seem in the highest
spirits. They are in motion the whole day long, and, as long as the room
is lighted, singing and calling to each other and running through their
marvellously varied repertoire of musical sounds, to the delight of all who
hear them.
Each of my birds has a large cage with ample space for exercise, and
frequent opportunities, which are seldom declined, of bathing. I am
looking forward, now that the summer seems reall}- to have come, to
enlarging my pets into a garden aviary, in the hope that they may be
tempted to go to nest when their natural breeding-season approaches. If
I should meet with an} r success I will ask you to admit a further letter on
the subject.* -- W. H. ST. OuinTin.
Sir, --Replying to the enquiries of Mr. Wiener, I was in the habit of
giving my Tuis about a large egg-cup full of food twice a day. The quality
of the potatoes did not matter so long as they were sound. I used moist sugar
(about a teaspoonful), and the potato was pounded with the sugar and a
small quantity of hot water into a perfect paste. The birds lost no strength
in confinement, and although they slept in a cage, for hours in the day they
flew about the room, and if called would perch on my hand and imitate my
voice and movements. Naturally, of course, they are pollen-eating birds,
and I presume that the potato and sugar mixture is as near an approach to
pollen as can be made.
At the present time I have a beautiful specimen of the Blue Mountain
Lor} - , which one of my sons brought from Sydney four 3&apos;ears ago. He also
is a flower-sucking bird, but I have not tried him with potato and sugar.
* A solitary female, which I had for over three years, " nested " every season, usually
in a small basket hung up in the bird-room ; she was broody for some weeks every year.
I find it difficult to believe that a diet of potatoes, etc., can be good for a Tui ;
anyway, a Tui will get on remarkably well without potatoes.--R. P.

He is fed on canary seed and lettuce leaves, but each morning lie has about
an egg-cup full of boiled bread and milk or crushed oats and milk, with lots
of sugar, and he is absolutely healthy. He loves to be let out of his cage
and fly about the room, and will lie down on the table to be tickled. Baths
are most essential for all these birds. Tuis love to splash, and my Lory will
get into his bath and scream until I bring a watering can and drench hill}.
I have seen flocks of them in New South Wales bathing under a little
mountain torrent, and they will get right under the spray and shriek with
enjoyment. If the}&apos; do not get plenty of water in confinement they have
rather an unpleasant smell, which can scarcely be detected if they are
supplied with daily baths.
Reverting to the Tui, which is now much scarcer than formerly in
New Zealand--it was always believed that its reduction in numbers was
largely due to the English honey bee. Dead Tuis were picked up under
the blossoming forest trees, audit was asserted that when the birds were
hovering round the blossoms and inserting their tongues for the pollen
they were often stung by bees and so died.
I can give my Lory no greater treat than a few sprays of mignonette,
clover, or other rich flower, and it is amusing to watch him licking out the
pollen. T. B. Whytehead.

THE TREATMENT OF TANAGERS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998968931034483" page_id="32635231"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- In my ' Foreign Finches in Captivity,' commenting upon Dr.
Russ' adverse criticism of these lovely birds, I expressed the opinion that
the greediness and consequent dirt of which he and others complain as
being natural to Tauagers were merely the result of unnatural confinement
in cages far too small for these naturally active birds.
From time to time during about five years my eyes used to be
gladdened by the sight of an extremely lively example of the Scarlet
Tauager in Mr. Housdeu's collection, which was kept in a cage of respect-
able dimensions, but I often wished for an opportunity of testing the
supposed delicacy of Tauagers for myself and was only deterred therefrom
by the high prices asked for these reputed bad-livers.
However, early in June my opportunity came, a fairly perfect Superb
Tanager was offered to me at a by no means prohibitive price ; its crown
and chin were indeed bare of feathers, but otherwise there was nothing to
complain of : the bird was wild as a hawk, as a recently imported Tauager
ought to be.
I put my bird into one of my largest flight-cages, gave it a saucer
containing a mixture of Abrahams' food, preserved yolk, ants' cocoons and
crumbled stale bread, a small piece of banana and half an orange ; also a
pan of clean water. This is its daily supply, but it never eats more than a
third of the fruit and just tastes the soft food. I have also offered both
mealworms and cockroaches, the former it simply ignores, of the latter it
very rarely eats one.
Up to the time of writing this account my Tauager is lively, chirps
freely, bathes at least once a day and has recovered the feathers on its head.
It is less nervous, only becoming excited when I change its food or water.
I have tried my bird with ripe strawberries of which it will eat about
a third of one in a day in addition to its regular diet ; but, as observed by
travellers, the favourite fruit of this species is undoubtedly the orange.

The result of my limited experience of Tanagers certainly confirms
my original opinion that the greed, filthiness and delicacy of Tanagers are
due to the mistaken notion that they ought to be kept in cramped little
cages surrounded by a variety of food in large quantities ; no opportunity
being given to the unhappy captive even to wash itself, however sticky and
grimy it may feel. Would not similar treatment soon convert the healthiest
and most vigorous bird into a hopeless invalid ? I think so.

Sir, --As I have given some attention to this point of late, I was very
much interested in Mr. Savage's remarks. I have two Parrot Finches
which I think I may call an undoubted pair, though they have not bred
with me. The legs and the feet of the hen are decidedly lighter in colour
than those of the cock.
The difficulty of distinguishing the sexes by simple inspection, as for
instance when judging at a Show, has been well illustrated by my birds.
They were exhibited at the Palace by Mr. Osbaldeston, to whom at that
time they belonged, and Dr. Butler, whose skill and experience are
indisputable, in critizing my awards called them "an undoubted pair--
though the cock was less brilliant in colour, and the hen had not by any
means attained her full colouring." I afterwards purchased the birds and
they have certainly turned out an "undoubted pair," only Dr. Butler had
sexed each bird w r rongly.
The bird which had not attained its full colouring, moulted in April
and became very much more brilliant, deeper and richer in colour than its
mate, the red colouring of the head extends further in every direction and
the legs are decidedly darker in colour. The lieu bird (which Dr. Butler
sexed as the cock) is a trifle larger, duller and paler in colour, has a less
extent of red colouring, and lighter coloured legs and feet. This bird, like
Mr. Savage's, "remains mute" while the cock has a " prett}^ little note."
The sexual differences, therefore, between my birds corroborate Mr.
Savage's observations in almost every detail. C. S. Simpson.

WAXBIDDS IN A MADEIRAN AVIARY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996690625" page_id="32635232"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
Sir,--P erhaps some of your readers would be interested to hear a
little more about the inhabitants of my aviaries.
Unfortunately, I cannot yet claim to have been successful in breeding
the Violet-eared Waxbills. One of the two pairs that I let loose in the
aviary, as mentioned in my last letter, built at once and the hen laid two
eggs. They deserted that nest and began another ; this time they
worked very hard, and so completely covered in the nest that it was
impossible to see how many eggs were laid. The two birds sat steadily and
I was quite hopeful about them ; in about fifteen days, however, I noticed
them both flying about, and that they never went near the nest, which I
then took out and examined. I found one dead young one, evidently
several days old, and I am afraid the reason this (and also the former nest)
was deserted was that it was disturbed by other birds.
My aviaries are, unfortunately, much too crowded--I have sixty-four
different kinds of birds, about two hundred and twenty in all--but we are
putting up two good-sized new ones, and I hope soon to be able to spare
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.997351765957447" page_id="32635233"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
one of the smaller ones in which to place a pair of Violet-ears entirely by
themselves.
I am very sorry to have to tell j'ou that I have since lost the male bird
of the pair I have been speaking of: he was found dead on the floor of the
aviary one morning, though he had seemed quite well the eveningbefore; and
was very plump and in lovely plumage. This was a great grief to my little
niece, a child of six, who is often in the aviary with me. It is a pretty
sight to see these little birds on her shoulders and hat trying to get some of
her golden hair for their nests. She cried very bitterly over this sad loss,
and I felt very much inclined to do the same.
Since the introduction of the Violet-ears, such is the force of
example, many of the birds which were very timid and shy have become
qnite tame--the Crimson-wing, Pheasant-finches and several other kinds
which used to be rather wild now come quite confidingly to take small
mealworms, etc., from my hand.
Of my smaller birds, those which have bred most successfully are, I
think, the Orange-cheeked Waxbills.* The first time they chose a somewhat
curious place for their nest. In one corner of the aviary there is always a
little heap of fine hay thrown down, or rather propped against the wall,
so that the birds may take it for building--in this the Orange-cheeks
formed their nest, only about three inches from the ground. I did not
think it at all likely they would remain undisturbed, but, in due course,
they successfully brought out four lovely chicks. Since then, however,
they have chosen higher and more secure nesting-places.
Another bird, which I think is seldom seen in England and which is
a great favourite of mine, is the Red-faced Finch.t This bird also becomes
exceedingly tame and sings a particularly sweet warbling song. Un-
fortunately, I have never been able to get any hens, indeed, I have never
seen one; I have three splendid males--one of these is in a cage in the
house. I say in a cage, but I should mention that the door of the cage is
seldom shut, and that the bird flies about everywhere and never seems to
think of going out although the windows and doors are generally wide open.
He will alwaj's return to his cage when told to do so, and if I close the door
he at once begins to sing as if asking to be let out again.
I have another little bird which seems to me to be uncommon. I
believe it is a Partridge- or Quail-finch, J but I can find nothing about them
in any of the newer books. Mr. Gedney briefly refers to them in his, and I
think this bird of mine must be one of these. It was sent to me from the
West Coast of Africa, in a cage with a lot of Waxbills, and seems to have
got there by chance. It is quite a small bird, about the size of an Avadavat,
but more robust in shape -- verj&apos; small head and short tail; prevailing
colours, black, white, and grey, with a distinct bright cliesnut shade
tinging the very speckled breast. It is very like a little Partridge, and
behaves like one, running about on the floor of the aviary all day, very
seldom flying at all. It is a gentle happy little bird, continually repeating
a few comical notes which can hardly be called a song, I am sorry that so
far I have never been able to get any more of these birds.

SQUATTING GRASS-FINCHES ; OR, SOUR GRAPES.

A member complains that we do not send accounts of our
nesting experiences to the Magazine. I have had a nesting
experience in my garden which I do not understand, and shall
be obliged if this or any other member of the community will
explain the matter. The point which exercises my mind is
this : Have I found out something new, entitling me to any
number of gold medals, or have I found a -- Mare's Nest?
In the latter case I should not advance a claim for the medal,
for the nest has been found before ;--though never before, I am
satisfied, has it been so eloquently described as it will have been
described when I shall have finished this paper.
On May 4th last, I obtained four Grass-finches, two, I
think a pair, of the rare and graceful Tong-tailed species,
Poephila acuticaudci, the other two, of uncertain sex, of the
possibly more rare but certainty less graceful Masked species,
P. personcita.
These four birds I placed in a 4ft. long aviary-cage in my
dining-room, and looked for them to nest, but the} 7 did not nest.
I then took to leaving the door of their cage occasionally open
in order that they might fly about ; but again I was disappointed
--they did not fly about. In the bow - window there is a
large, I think I may say a very large, Blue Gum tree ; I have
indeed read in books that larger are known to grow in Australia,
but then writers must speak big in books or no one would buy
them. Any way, during the spring, numbers of little Finches
had been disporting themselves in this tree ; and I naturally
expedted that these Grass-finches would go and do likewise--
but they didn't ; they would do nothing but squat, and would
squat any where and every where but in the Blue Gum. At first
they squatted on the window-sills ; when I drove them from

the window-sills, then they squatted on the flower-pots ; when
I drove them from the flower-pots, then they squatted on the
floor ; when I drove them from the floor, then they squatted
on the pictures hung up against the walls. The Masked
Grass - finches were the worst ; I never saw such creatures
in my life ; side by side they squatted until it became
monotonous ; and, fearing that they might take root and
become fixtures, I eventually turned them out into the
garden. Here they still squatted, usually on the ground, always
side by side, on a gentle declivity, in the sun when possible.
Then there came a time when they became excited, and dashed
about, and finally disappeared in a dense and impenetrable jungle
at the end of the garden ; and visions of baby Masks and gold
medals dangled before my eyes. Sometimes for days and days
I would not see them, and then only when creeping about on
the ground feeding ; but weeks and weeks have passed, and no
baby Masks have appeared ; and if you were to ask me what
I now think I should find if I were to invade the pathless depths
of the jungle, I should answer that I think I should just find
those two birds squatting.
Of the Tong-tailed Grass-finches I had many hopes ; but,
objecting to their squatting on the window-sills, I shut them up
entirely. Feeble signs of nesting appeared occasionally, but
nothing came of it, and it ended in my turning them likewise
out into the garden. Now these birds had never been in the
garden before, yet no sooner were they let loose than they flew
straight to the nearest tree, and commenced building forthwith.
They did not make any attempt to explore their new domain ;
and, although very strong birds, I doubt if they have even yet
visited the jungle, or been to the end of the garden, which is
only a few yards long. The lime tree to which they flew had
been cut hard back during the winter (by the Parrakeets), and
had thrown out a fairly thick head of young branches. In this
they built a Magpie-like nest, about the size of a Rugby football,
entirely of straw externally, but lined with finer straw and dried
grass. Of what possible use a lattice-work dome of straw could
have been I cannot imagine ; but perhaps it was for ornament,
not for use. After the completion of the nest, there was a quiet
pause ; then the birds practically disappeared ; and once more
grand visions of gold medals galore danced before my eyes.
Now, I hope the readers of this Magazine will not think
that I am poking fun at them when I say that I am a good-
natured man. About this time it so happened that a friend of
mine had a pair of Nonpareils which he wanted to get rid of ;

and, taking advantage of my lamentable good-nature, he made a
present of them to me. Being as it were visitors, I felt con-
strained to treat them to my best, and so loosed them into the
aviary where the Finches were. They were weak from long
caging, and it was late in the season for them, nevertheless they
resolved upon going to nest. They took a fancy to the Tong-
tails' nest in the lime tree, and, not caring to face the owners at
the entrance, coolly set to work to pull it to pieces from the
rear. After a few days, the Tong-tails deserted the nest ; and I
doubted not but that the Nonpareils had stolen the eggs. The
female Nonpareil had built her nest within a foot of the path,
and close to the entrance door, and was sitting on three eggs.
I approached the nest with set teeth, and with the unchange-
able determination of catching her on her nest and transferring
her and her belongings to other quarters ; she took no notice of
me as usual beyond looking up into my face ; but this she did
with a look so full of trust and confidence that I had not the
heart to disturb her, and beat an ignominious retreat.
Once more the Tong-tails set to work on their nest in the
lime tree, and quickly repaired it ; and once more they settled
down, and soon disappeared from public view. But the Non-
pareils could not tear themselves away from this nest, once
more was the nest deserted, and once more I judged that the
eggs had been stolen. Then I examined the Nonpareils' eggs,
and, finding them clear, quietty enticed the owners into an
adjoining aviary. The Tong-tails had now commenced a third
nest in some thick Virginia Creeper, so thick that I could not
see more of the nest than the ends of a stray straw here and
there. As in the former cases, the birds commenced by carrying
up a quantity of long straw, and finished with finer material ;
and here the birds settled down ; while I settled down to prepare
an application for the gold medal. Nevertheless, brazen it out
as I would, there was one little rift in the lute which produced
a tiny note of discord and uneasiness in the inner recesses of my
heart. What in the world did the old birds mean by occasionally
returning to their old nest in the lime tree ! ! !
All went liapp3^ as a marriage bell until Sunday, August
Stli. Until that day the storms had spared m3 7 aviar3 7 ; but now
came the rain. I went to Church as usual ; but as the rain
came thundering down on the roof, I fear I thought more of the
nests than of the sermon ;--but trul3 T the sermon was very prosy;
it is an indisputable fact that clergymen do sometimes preach
prosy sermons, and this was one of them. On returning home,
I found what I had feared, the two birds on a perch preening
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.990113125" page_id="32635237"  page_num="188" year="" vol="">
their feathers in a disconsolate way : the young doubtless had
been drowned. After waiting a few hours, and finding that the
parents shewed no inclination to return to their nest, I resolved
to inspect it. Quietly and cautiously I approached, so as not to
disturb other birds nesting around, and at last reached the spot,
the nest being on a level with my face. Carefully I pushed
aside the luxuriant creeper, and found--well, not exactly what I
had expected to find. Instead of a nice little tight little nest
with a concave receptacle for eggs and } r oung, I found an oblong
convex lump of fine grass, surrounded by a lot of straw, but
with a substantial back, which served presumably as a screen
from the wind. I turned to the old nest in the lime tree ; it was-
of a precisely similar character. Then the horrible truth flashed
upon me : they were Squatting Places for the old birds, not
nests at all.
The birds have since gone back to their squatting place
in the Virginia Creeper, and are still squatting awa}*- as happy
as squatters.
I cannot understand why the members are so anxious to
get hold of that gold medal ! I know, if it were offered to me, I
just wouldn't take it.
THE HALF-MASKED WEAVER.
Hyph a n torn is vitellinus, Ificht.
By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
This beautiful Weaver-bird inhabits N.-Eastern to N.-
Western Africa almost to the equator, and is allied to the better
known Abyssinian Weaver, from which, however, it can at once
be distinguished by the colouring of the head ; the black mask
being confined to the front and sides of the face and bordered at
the back by a diffused edging of chestnut, which covers the
front of the crown. The prevailing colour of the bird is bright
golden yellow, the feathers of the wings and tail being black
with yellow edges.
According to Von Heuglin it appears in flocks in the
neighbourhood of the White and the Blue Niles towards the end
of May or in June, being still in winter plumage, and separates
into small companies. Soon after its arrival the change into
summer plumage commences, and then it begins its courtship
among the acacias and thorn-trees growing in damp places near
the banks of a stream, by the rain-water pools, upon islands and
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999405047619048" page_id="32635238"  page_num="189" year="" vol="">
in fields of dense-growing maize. The nest is carefully and
.substantially built of green grass-stems and is suspended at a
good height from a slender overhanging branch ; it is purse-
shaped and tapering at the upper part, so that it moves with
the least breath of air ; moreover, these nests are so numerous
that one shades the other throughout a great part of the day.
Many nests are unoccupied, and are supposed to be used
b3 r the males to roost in by night or in bad weather ; but it is
more probable that the weaving instinct, which is strong in
these birds, impels them to construct many more nests than they
require.
Von Heuglin believes that the males only build, but
Antinori declares that both sexes are engaged in the work of
*construction. Probably, as is the case with the species of the
genus Ploceits, the males build the greater part of the nest,
the females only assisting at the finish.
The entrance to the nest is in front, directed somewhat
downwards and sometimes with a small tubular extension. The
eggs appear to vary in number from three to seven, five being
the most usual number according to Von Heuglin. In captivity
the number is either three or four, the colouring being whitish,
lemon yellow, bluish, or bright green, spotted (chiefly towards
the larger end) with scattered dark green markings, more
numerous rusty brown spotting, or rust-brownisli and greyish
spots most densely massed at the larger extremity.
Although not b} r any means abundantly imported as a
cage-bird, this Weaver has been bred without the least difficulty
in German bird-rooms, building with either fresh grass or hay :
incubation lasts twelve days.
I purchased a male example of the Half-masked Weaver
about two years ago and turned it into an aviary with my Java
Sparrows and a Liothrix : it is no trouble, being always in mag-
nificent health, and since I purchased it has never yet assumed
its winter plumage--a peculiarity which seems not uncommon
with the species of Hyphcintornis when kept in aviaries : for
food it has canary, millet, oats, and soft food, but no insects to
my knowledge, though it may perhaps sometimes capture a stray
cockroach.
The song is industriously persevered in throughout the
breeding-season, but it is rather comical than pretty, usualty
commencing with a few shrill excited chirps, followed by a
sustained rattling castanet note, like winding up an old kitchen-
</bodyText>

clock and interspersed with squeaks, squirt-like hissings and a
few clear notes.
I have not found this Weaver particularly aggressive,
whilst it is undoubtedly a hardy and usually long-lived bird *
bright, attractive, and amusing. It is a little smaller than its
Abyssinian relative.
THE FOOD OF THE BLACKCAP.
By E. G. B. Meade-Waedo.
In countries where the Blackcap is the most frequent cage
bird, and where nearly every other peasant's cottage has one or
two hanging up on the wall, the food given is almost entirely
fruit. These birds live for years and years in the most perfect
health, if not plumage, and sing to perfection.
They are kept in fair sized cages, made of nothing but
split cane. The bottom is of the same material, but in hot
weather (or rather when the sun is on them, for it is always hot)
a large leaf or two are placed on the roof of the cage. The
principal food used is ripe figs, these are squashed on to the out-
side of the bars and the birds pick what they want from inside;
oranges are also given, and bananas, custard apples, and all kinds
of fresh fruit, also dried figs which are moistened with water
before being plastered on. No animal food is ever given, but
I have seen the birds watching the fruit when it begins to
ferment, and catching quantities of flies and moths which are
attracted by the juice. I knew several of these caged examples
for five years: they were always thriving and almost always in
song, and their owners told me that they had had them for years
before I saw them, and I have no reason to disbelieve it.
These birds are out of doors day and night, all the
year round. I have kept many myself and found them quite
hardy. They breed freely in a large aviary, rearing the young,,
first upon caterpillars, etc., afterwards upon fruit. The sexes
must be separated, except when breeding, or the powerful
females will drive the males to death. This separation of the
sexes is observable in a wild state, the females wintering quite
apart from the males, and usually at a far higher elevation above
the sea level. To show on what unnatural food a bird will live
and thrive I must quote a Blackcap, (one of the curious variety
known as Heineken's Blackcap in which the ashen-grey of the
body in the ordinary form is replaced by olive brown, and the
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999514315789474" page_id="32635240"  page_num="191" year="" vol="">
black cap by a black head and neck). I got this bird from a
man who kept it in a room with a number of Canaries ; it had
nothing but canary seed to eat, and occasionally a little lettuce;
it bolted the canary seed whole, and was in perfedt health. I
bought it from him and kept it for three years when it escaped.
It wintered out in England in an open aviary and always used
to eat a lot of canary seed. This curious variety is peculiar to
the Island of Madeira and to the interior of the great crater on
the Island of " Ea Palma," Canaries. It is popularly supposed
by the peasants to be the product of the fifth egg of a Blackcap l
No hen of this variety has been seen.
The Blackcaps which winter in England live principally
on the fruit of the cotoneaster, and in the extremely severe
weather of Januaiy and February of 1895, one lived 011 the
myrtle-berries on my house until the tree was suddenly cleared
by the starving Missel Thrushes. The first arrivals of this bird
in March have often severe weather to contend with. They live
on ivy-berries. Prom this I infer that fruit in some form must
always largely enter into the dietary of the Blackcap.

VICARAGE, 1897.
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
Month after month I have opened the Magazine in the
hope of seeing a record of breeding operations in some aviary
or other ; but so far in vain.
Before commencing an account of my 1897 operations, I
may say in passing that birds and trees are still compatible, in
fact the latter never looked better, and as there are some 150
birds among them they have had a fair trial.
Then again, it may interest members to know that
mealworms have not proved " too stimulating." May be the
stomachs of my young birds are specially made for digesting
such unwholesome morsels !
And once more, Popes and Virginian Nightingales are not
the murderous wretches they are often said to be.
I may say in passing, that in one of my garden aviaries
I have had all the present season, Virginians, Popes, Green
Cardinals, Blue Robins, and Brown-headed Starlings, and no
murders have been committed, and yet there have been lots of
chances in the form of helpless young birds in all directions.
Now for the breeding-record of this year, so far.

The Blue Robins were, I think, the first to begin opera-
tions. They laid and hatched in a cigar-box, very early in
the season, when snow was on the ground. The young all
hatched out and did well for a few days, when, for some reason
or other, the old ones deserted them. The next time they built
in a bigger box close by; there were four eggs, and three
hatched out; they all flew and are now as big as their parents.
(August 2nd). By the way, I often wonder how Blue Robins
manage to hatch their eggs: as half the time the hen is gadding
about ; they must do well on a modicum of heat.
As soon as this lot was off their hands the}?- nested again,
and I did not discover the nest till they hatched out. They laid
four eggs again, one clear, and they are just on the point of
flying. (They flew to-day, August 2nd). The old birds carry out
the excreta, just as Starlings do, and they don't seem to much
relish the job, by the way they clean their beaks afterwards.
I sold all my young Blue Robins last year down south,
and I often wonder how they have fared in their new home.
My next success was with Green Cardinals. These are a
splendid pair and quite tame. The hen does not mind my going
to her nest a bit. They commenced breeding very early in the
season, and built their nest in a big elder bush. It is very like
the nest of the Blackbird. The first time she laid three eggs, the
colour of a Thrush only with purple spots on the larger end in
place of black. One egg was unfertile, the other two hatched out.
The youngsters grew rather slowly and did not leave the nest
for about three weeks. One day on going to the nest, as I
thought it time they flew, I found to my dismay, the nest empty.
I concluded that the nest had been taken by some boys, as they are
always taking nests in the garden. I w?as bitterly disappointed,
as }?ou may imagine, but what was my delight, on going into the
aviary a few days after, to see the young Cardinals sitting as still
as death on some dense elder, not even winking an eyelid.
The young beggars had really flown : and the parents had
hidden them so skilfully that though I searched the aviary from
end to end, I failed to find them. The youngsters are a sort of
greyish colour, with a very small crest and no dark beard:
rather like a very pale hen bird. They are fed a long time by the
parents after leaving the nest. You can hear them being fed,
as they make a sort of plaintive cry, which sounds like si-si-si.
Am I entitled to the medal for rearing Green Cardinals ?*
No, the Green Cardinal was reared by Dr. Butler in 1895, and by others before him.--E d.

As soon as this lot was off her hands, the hen laid again--
three eggs, and hatched two, one clear. Then she nested again,
four eggs: but they all proved clear. Nothing daunted, she
has gone to nest again, and is sitting hard on three eggs. I
call this a record performance. Green Cardinals eat as much
grass as an old hen. The cock always sings just before laying
begins, but not after. He has, like me, not much of a singing
voice. They are excellent parents, but the hen is rather greedy.
My Zebra-finches have done very well this season. I
really don't know how many young there are exactly, they are
getting to be almost innumerable. I note, in passing, that my
Zebras are probably a degenerate lot, as they never think of
laying seven eggs. Three or four are nearer the average, and
three more often than four. Roughly, I should say that I have
had about forty, so far, and lots of birds now sitting.
I have had three or four nests of Silverbills, about five in
each, and I saw a pair nesting this morning.
I had a beautiful pair of Virginians in this aviary, and
they would have built; but the hen got a tumour on her throat
and I had to kill her. I have another good hen, so I quite hope
to rear some next season, if all goes well.
My cock Virginian is in splendid feather and as red as
possible in colour--a perfedt blaze of scarlet. They are very shjq
nervous birds, not at all like the Green Cardinals.
The Popes have not attempted to build, but have behaved
admirably in the midst of many temptations in the shape of
juicy and helpless young birds.
The Starlings have not built. The cock has a quaint song
of a few bars, and is a dab, as the boj^s say, at catching insedts.
He quarters the ground like a true Starling.
My Cordon Bleus built in a little box and have laid, and
are now sitting hard.
The Ribbon Finches are also now sitting: they are quiet
inoffensive birds.
The Green Avadavats have all built and laid and sat ; but
no young.
The Golden-breasted Waxbills have also laid and sat--no
result.
The Pekin Robins built a lovely nest in a box-tree, but
never laid any eggs.
My Diamond Sparrows have built a huge nest, literally

as big as a Sparrow-hawk's, made of twigs. I can't see if they
have eggs, as it is too high up.
I have a splendid pair of Pin-tailed Nonpareils and a cock:
Fire-finch in perfect health.
My Bengalese have nested as usual, I have a lot of them
now flying about. They are grand fliers.
My King and Queen went to nest about April, in a big.
log. They were very noisy at pairing time, especially in the
evening. The hen laid eggs about the size of a pigeon's, but
much rounder. She sat a bit, but the moult came on and this
threw her off.
My Rosellas laid seven eggs, and would have hatched all
right ; but a heavy thunder-storm came on and the nest got wet,
and the eggs were addled. Only the hen sits, the cock simply
keeps guard outside.
My Redrumps laid very early in the season ; sharp frosts
about; but the hen suffered nothing. They hatched out three
youngsters, and all was going well when a storm came and
drowned them. They were fourteen days old, and beginning to
feather. Better luck next time !
The Turquoisines have not, so far, done anything, though
in perfect health and condition.
REVIEW.
Waxbills, Grass-finches, and Mannikins, by Horatio R. Fillmer.
(Betts of Sons, LimitedJ
This unpretending work contains a vast amouut of
practical information and advice, within a small space and for
a small price. It differs from other handbooks of the same sort,
in that its scope is limited to the three groups mentioned in
the title, and it systematically describes the general appearance,
and treatment in captivity, of every species in these groups
which is at all common in confinement. The author has, very
wisely as we think, confined himself in an avicultural work, to
aviculture : the reader will find no fearful and wonderful theories
on classification or scientific nomenclature, for the classification
and scientific names accepted by ornithologists are adopted
without criticism or comment. This is as it should be. The
information which the book contains is presented in a somewhat
condensed form ; the author has evidently been at pains to

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994986558139535" page_id="32635244"  page_num="195" year="" vol="">
eliminate all "padding," to limit the size of the book, and to give
as much as possible within those limits : probably some readers
might have preferred a more gossipy style, but the book
doubtless would have lost in usefulness, even if it had gained
somewhat in attractiveness.
One chapter is devoted to " Cages and Aviaries," and a
second to "Food and General Management;" the remaining
three chapters deal respectively with Waxbills, Grass-finches, and
Mannikins. The instruction given in the first two chapters is
thoroughly sound and practical: it is evident that Mr. Fillmer
writes from an acquaintance of no recent date with his subject,
and the budding aviculturist may rest assured that he will not go
wrong if he closely follows the advice here given on the general
arrangement of a bird-room, the construction of the aviaries,
and the methods of heating. We do not, however, share Mr.
Fillmer's dislike of the oil-stove, which, in some cases, may be
the best heating apparatus available.
In treating of each species, a short description of the
plumage and general appearance is given, with the sexual
differences : these descriptions are necessarily brief, but are
sufficient to enable the beginner to identify all the more common
species, and are, in almost every case, very accurate. We, feel
bound, however, to take exception to the delicate tints of the
Rufous-tailed Grass-finch being summed up as " red and brown,"
which gives, as w T e think, a wrong impression of the bird. Mr.
Fillmer places this species among the Waxbills on account of its
resemblance to the Crimson-finch, but its song is almost exactly
like that of the Gouldian - finches : we do not agree with the
statement that it is " nearly as quarrelsome as the Crimson-
finch."
Like most aviculturists who have kept the species, the
author is much enamoured of the Parrot-finch : he remarks that
his bird appeared to moult twice a year, which corresponds with
our own observations. The legs of the Parrot-finch, by-the-bye,
are not black but brown, in some cases light brown.
The best account in the book, as we think, is that of the
Parson Finch. We quite agree with the author's opinion that it
is difficult to distinguish the sexes by the plumage with any
degree of certainty. Some very useful and practical hints on
the breeding of this species in confinement are given.
Mr. Fillmer considers that the Bengalese is a variety of
the Striated Finch, an opinion which we believe will be generally
shared by those who have closely observed the two birds.

The little book is got up in a very attractive form : the
paper and print are all that can be desired ; it will be found a
careful and trustworthy guide to the neophyte in aviculture, and
a necessary addition to every avicultural library.

CORRESPONDENCE.
THE BLUE AND FAWN WAX BILL.
Sir,--S ix j^ears ago there came into my possession (as I thought) a
pair of Cordon Bleus. The cock died three daj^s after, but I flattered
myself that I had, in the hen, a champion bird, for it was extra large, and
had more blue colouring than usual.
A short time after this, I paid a visit to the Zoological Society's
Gardens, and was surprised to see in the Parrot house a cage containing
what looked like four very fine hen Cordon Bleus, and I remarked to the
keeper what a nice sample tliej^ were, but that I had a hen quite as large.
To my surprise, he said they were quite new (I have quite forgotten the
Latin name) that he had been there many j&apos;ears, and the Society had never
had any in their possession before.
Not knowing how to designate mine, I call it the Blue and Fawn
Waxbill.* It lived peaceabl}' with my Cordons until last year, when they
began to nest : then the two cock Cordons nearly killed it. They would
get the little fellow at the bottom of the cage and unmercifully fight it.
One morning after one of these scrimmages, I caught the poor thing and
caged it separately, but it was a most wretched-looking object, very puffy,
several feathers gone, and wings drooping. Happening to have the rose
trees swarming with aphides, I fed the invalid with some of the finest from
the point of a camel's-hair brush ; and he knew what was prepared for him
directly I tapped the tin of insects, and would come to the side of the cage
to be fed. For quite a week he moped on the perch, then the turn came,
and he began to eat mealworms cut up very small: this was put on to a
mixture of crumbled sponge cake and preserved yolk of egg.
I do not recollect seeing any mention made of this bird in the
Avicultural Magazine. As it has lived with me nearly as long as some
Cordon Bleus, perhaps some members might like to give it a trial. The
new introduction is strong and healthy, and has not lost his neck-plumage
like some of the Waxbill tribe do. The staple food is white, Indian, and
spray millet, and he is a regular Oliver Twist for rose grubs and aphides --
constantly " asking for more."

A NEW METHOD OF DISTINGUISHING SEX.
Sir, --Being interested in the articles in the Magazine referring to
the distinction of sexes in birds, and knowing how difficult it is to distinguish
some of them, I should like to bring to your notice a method of which I
have just heard, and seen tested.
It is as follows :--Take a piece of thread i6in. or iSin. long, and with
it thread a needle, and take hold of the ends of the thread between the
thumb and finger and let the point of the needle hang over a silver coin,
say a half-crown piece ; let the point of the needle be about one-eighth of
an inch from the coin, then take hold of the bird, pigeon, cat, or other
animal or bird with the other hand, and if the animal is a male the needle
will swing across the coin ; but if a female it will go round the coin.*

A RARE FOREIGN FINCH.
Sir,-- Most aviculturists are familiar with the name, if not with the
living reality, of the Chingolo Song-Sparrow (Zonotrichia pileata) ; but
probably few, if any, have seen the allied Grey-headed Song-Sparrow
(Z. canicapilla) in the flesh.
On June 25th a specimen of this rare Patagonian bird was brought to
me by Captain Carvosso, a gentleman who, from time to time, has collected
many interesting things during his journeys to and from Australia. This
bird had flown on board when the ship was a hundred miles to the south of
Cape Horn, and he brought it to me to see whether I could tell him where
it came from and what it was. I recognized it, at a glance, as a Song-
Sparrow nearly allied to Z. pileata ; but its unstriped crown and pale amber
coloured irides struck me at once as very distinct features.
Capt. Carvosso kindly gave me this bird, so that I might have an
opportunity of studying it in captivity, but with the proviso that, at its
death, it should be added to the National Collection if the authorities cared
to accept it. Unhappily, this pretty bird was out of condition although in
tolerably perfect plumage. I took it home and turned it into a flight-cage
four feet in length, but it would swallow nothing but grit at first (of which
it was probably in need), it was far too tame to please me, flew heavily, and
only swallowed a few grains of canary-seed before going to roost. I tried
to tempt it with mealworms and cockroaches, and when it erected its crest
and hopped after one of the latter insects I hoped I might pull it round,
but it turned away again and flew heavily up to a perch.
In the morning I found this interesting bird dead, and took it with
me to the Museum where it will be preserved.

this obscure subject has been little studied of late years.--E d.

CHEAP FOODS FOR INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS.

Sir, --In the February number of the Avicultural Magazine , Dr. Butler
writes of an Indian insedtivorous food for birds, that might prove cheaper
than the ordinary ants' cocoons and dried flies, as sold.
Having been in South Africa for some years, it struck me, on reading
Dr. Butler's letter, that there was a possibility of collecting and drying the
undeveloped locust, in that stage called by Colonials " hoppers."
As the Locust Bird feeds entirely on the developed insedt, I should
think it very possible that many of the larger insectivorous-feeding birds
would take the insect in the smaller or hopper" stage. Possibly some of
our members of the Avicultural Society have tried them.
Having written to a friend of mine at the Cape who takes interest in
these matters, asking him to send me some on their next appearance--
which has been unpleasantly frequent of late, -- I hope to be able to let you
know, later on, how my birds take to them. Instead of collecting these
pests in handfuls, they might be gathered in sacks : and to turn a plague
into a commercial industry would be a pleasing anomally.

CAPTIVITY.
Sir, --I do not know if this lovely Parrakeet has been bred in an}&apos;
aviary in England, but in several instances it has been, successfully, in
France. I have succeeded in breeding it myself this season, and a few
notes may interest our readers.
A pair was offered for sale last autumn in the neighbourhood of
Bordeaux, and, being desirous of trying my luck with these beautiful birds,
I purchased them at a good figure. The gentleman wrote me :--"If you
wish to be successful in breeding with them, put them in an aviary alone
and give plenty of green food." The latter they have had, but as I could
not lodge them alone they have been, since their arrival, in an aviary with
at least thirty small birds, from Waxbills up to Saffron Finches and Pekin
Robins. They wintered in an outdoor aviary, as most of my birds do, but
the aviary has a glass door that can be shut when the weather is very cold
or damp. I ought to say though, perhaps, that a small oil-stove was burned
in the aviary for about a couple of hours in the mornings of about a dozen
of the worse days during the winter, not on account of the Parrakeets, but
principally for the small Waxbills, which seemed to feel the winter and
looked most uncomfortable. The Many-coloureds, being in the same aviary,
had their share of the warmth too; but had they been alone I should not
have put in the stove, the winter not being a very severe one.
Things went on exceedingly well, and towards the beginning of May
the hen began visiting the nest-boxes, and looked like nesting. The
cock was most attentive, and fed her continually. A box was eventually
chosen and four white eggs laid, not very large. One of the eggs was
broken during incubation ; I patched it over with thin gum paper, but it

*came to nothing; the other three all hatched and produced two hens and a
*cock. The two hens I still have in splendid health and plumage, but the
young cock died. I attribute the loss to his having been accidentally shut
\0x25A0out one chilly night while very young, when he caught cold, and death
ensued. They left the nest at a very tender age, before they could walk
properly, and days before they could fly. I put them back a time or two,
hut the)&apos;- were out again soon after and appeared determined to stop out!
They were reared without any fuss or extras: the food being spray millet,
canary seed, white millet, and a little hemp mixed; they had, also, a liberal
supply of groundsel, cliickweed, and flowering grass, roots with it. A
saucer of soft food, for the Finches, is always in the aviary -- ants' eggs, a
prepared food (bought), and bread-crumbs, mixed, a little boiling milk
being poured over the whole, just sufficient to moisten it--and this the
parents were very fond of picking over while feeding their young, more on
account, I fancy, of the bread and milk than the ants' eggs. I only
obtained one nest, rather late, as will be seen--young hatched in June--
and the parents are now moulting; but if they could be induced to com-
mence a little earlier, two nests might be obtained during the year. They
belong to the same genus-- Psefihotus --as Redrumps, and from a pair of the
latter I had three nests last year and three again this.
As regards the character and disposition of the Many-coloureds, with
me they have done little harm to the small birds lodged with them--but
the aviary is large ; in close quarters, as far as my observations go, I do not
think they would be " inoffensive creatures towards small birds," as
one writer calls them, especially when the breeding-season conies round.
In my aviary they seemed very bitter towards a male Saffron-finch, and the
cock Many-coloured nearly strangled him one day ; yet, strange to say, the
pair of Saffrons had nest after nest in a box not eighteen inches away from
the Parrakeets. Neighbours do quarrel sometimes ! So far, I have had no
more troublewith Many-coloureds than with Redrumps; butmy success may
be attributed to possessing a healthy robust pair--there are " Multicolor et
Multicolor, comme il y a fagot et fagot," as the French say. But a good
pair, well accommodated, ought to breed with anybody.
Many-coloureds are rather larger than Redrumps, and, as everybody
knows, the male bird has a most gorgeous plumage. The lieu is much of
the hen Redrump plumage, but can be readily distinguished from her by
three red patches--one on the head and one on each shoulder. Young hens
have the patch on the head as soon as they leave the nest, but those on the
shoulders come later : my two young hens have little or no red yet. Young
cocks, on leaving the nest, are feathered like the parent bird, the colours
being less vivid. The parents are most attentive to their young, and feed
them for several weeks after they leave the nest.
I would strongly recommend anybody who attempts breeding these
Parrakeets to give a liberal supply of fresh groundsel daily , and plenty of
flowering grass, roots included, as soon as it can be got in the spring, and
continue it fresh daily as long as it lasts ; they are extremly fond of it, and
groundsel.
My two young hens seem very fond of each other: they preen one
another frequently. They are not exactly alike as regards plumage, one
is rather lighter than the other ; after the first moult they will probably
both be like the mother.

Many-colon reds take " forty winks " at different times during tlie day ;
but they can be lively enough when inclined to be, and are especially so in
the evening as the twilight approaches.
before closing, let me add a few words about ray Parrot Finches. I
lost one of the first two young they had, the other--a male, now singing--
is coming into adult plumage. I had a second nest last month--four hatched
from four eggs; two died very 3&apos;Oung,and the other two left the nest on the
8 th instant. The parents are building again.
I was glad to see Dr. Simpson's remarks in last month's Magazine,
and that his observations as regards the marks of distinction of sex
corroborate mine. A peculiar thing in young Parrot Finches is that they
are hatched with four bluish pearl-like spots, two on each side of the beak,
at the base ; these spots disappear as they get older, but they have them
till they are some six weeks old or more.

ALARIO FINCHES.
The pair of birds of this species which last year reared two young
have this year hatched three nests, containing altogether seven } 7 oung, but
only two have been reared, and one of these is very weakly. The first nest
contained only one young bird, which died when a few days old, and was
thrown out of the nest. There were three young in the second nest, all of
which lived for about three weeks, when one of them died. The third nest
also contained three, all of which died when quite young. The hen is half
inclined to nest again--but I shall not permit this. The young are fed on
nothing but hempseed and green food--doubtless if the old birds would
feed them on egg food they would have a much better chance of rearing
them.

We have to congratulate the members of the Society on the
large increase in their numbers during the past year, and hope
that they will be thereby stimulated to greater zeal in calling the
attention of any friends who are interested in aviculture to the
advantage of membership in a Society of such rapidty growing
importance and usefulness.
During the past year sixty-three new members have been
elected, and the total number on the roll is now two hundred and
sixty-one.
We believe that this accession of new members has been
largely due to the attraction of the illustrations which have
this year appeared in the Magazine--and that, therefore,
although the cost of the plates has been heavy, it was money
well spent. In spite of the fadt that the balance in hand at the
beginning of the year has practically vanished, we propose to
continue the same policy ; and, as was notified in the leaflet
issued with the September Magazine, it is intended that at least
four plates from drawings by Mr. Frohawk shall be issued
with next year's Magazine. It has been found necessary,
liowever, to raise the extra charge for the hand-coloured plates
somewhat considerably.
The competitions for prize articles were not very success-
ful, and only one prize (out of the three offered) was actually
awarded. It is not proposed to offer any prizes for competition
next year.

No claims have been received for the medals offered to
members who should succeed in breeding some species not
previously bred in this country ; but, as it is believed that several
members have come very near to winning one of these medals,
the offer is renewed for next 3 T ear upon the same conditions as
before.
We have to lament the death of several members during
the past year, that of Mr. Erskine Alton being an especially
severe loss to the Society.
Arrangements have been made for Messrs. Betts &amp; Sons,
Limited, of 2, Gray's Inn Place, Gray's Inn, W.C., to undertake
the publication and distribution of the Magazine, which will in
future be posted to the members by that firm, and to them all
orders for extra copies should be addressed.
The thanks of the members are due to all, whether officers
or not, who in various ways have helped in the work of the
Society, and especially to the members of the Executive Com-
mittee, whose load of work and responsibility is always a heavy
one.

By O. Ernest Cressweel.
Our Secretary has informed me that during these summer
months "copy" is always short ; this must be my apology for
relating the doings of the inhabitants of some of my aviaries,
which are, I fancy, of interest to but a limited number of the
members of our Society.
Through the summer my Doves have been intent, as never
before, on raising descendants to represent them in times to
come. Pairs, which for years had never really nested, though
eggs were casually dropped about, have systematically and
seriously made their nests and reared offspring. I cannot
entirely account for this : in some cases it is, I think, due to the
fadt that I have learnt by experience just the tempting places in
which to hang up nesting-baskets ; in one aviary I attribute it to
the growth of China rose-bushes and honeysuckle, which now
almost conceal the nests ; in other cases I cannot pretend to
explain the change. A short account of the species which I
have this year succeeded in rearing may possibly be of interest.
1. Early in June, through the great kindness of a corres-
pondent in Barbadoes, whom I do not personally know, a large
crate arrived, containing seven Wood Doves, as they are
commonly called in their native land ; ten had been dispatched,
three of which had apparently succumbed to the voyage. All
were in good health, though one masterful spirit (as I soon
learnt) had plucked several bare 011 the head and shoulders.
This Wood Dove is the Columba auriia of Shaw's Zoology. It is
about the size of the Barbary Turtle, but is shorter in tail and
longer in legs, and is decidedly a ground Dove, and runs fast.
The general colour of the head, back, and wings, is sienna-
brown, changing into vinaceous pink on the breast; on each
side of the neck are brilliant violaceous patches which almost
meet on the back ; there are black and white spots on the wings
and on the ends of the tail-feathers, and, on the sides of the head,
two dark horizontal lines, like the Zenaida tribe. Temminck's
beautiful illustration of his Cohtmba aurita, or Martinique Dove,
in most points fairly represents this Dove. In the Natural
History Department of the British Museum I was lately cour-
teously allowed to overlook many skins ; the nearest approach
to my new importations, that I could find, was the S. American
Zenaida aurita, but its general colour was rather ashen than rich

brown. It is possible that the colour fades after death, or that
there is a local difference in birds of the same species.
One hen soon laid on the floor of the large cage into
which I put them on arrival, and I reared a pretty adtive young
one under a pair of Barbary Turtles. It was a fascinating little
creature, and, to my great regret, fell a vidtim to a marauding
cat. I have this year, for the first time, lost several favourites in
the same way. These grimalkins take up their quarters in my
woods, and at night, apparently, climb the aviaries and terrify
the inmates till they fall exhausted on the ground, and then
drag them, or limbs of them, through the wire netting. To any
aviculturist, plagued in the same way, I give the hint, that when
the netting besides being of small mesh, is also of very strong
gauge, and where it does not run to the ground, but the lower
part of the flight is boarded, then no such mishaps have taken
place. To return to the Doves--I have nowhere seen any either
in English or Continental collections. Their coo is very peculiar,
and musically mournful, utterly unlike that of any other Dove

phcips lophotesJ, which during five years never nested at all,
though the hen continually dropped eggs about, have this 3 T ear,
between the middle of March and the middle of August, nested
five times in the same basket. This change I attribute to the
growth of shrubs and climbers in the aviary. I had always
supplied divers nest-boxes and baskets on shelves or tied to pegs
in the inner house, such as I have elsewhere seen these Doves
nesting in, but all to no purpose. East March I one day heard
the hen making a peculiar noise in a thick bush of French
honeysuckle; I took the hint, fetched a little basket and tied it in
the bush to the external wire netting. In an hour she was in it, the
next day laid her first egg, and has since ever stuck to it and reared
several young ones. These Doves sit about nineteen days, and
the precocity of the 3 r oung is wonderful ; one flew from the nest
to a high perch on its thirteenth day. In the earlier days of the
importation of these Doves, they persisted at Knowsley in
breeding in the winter, and indeed, my own, some 3^ears ago,
began to lay early in February ; but b&amp;gt; T degrees they seem
inclined to conform to our English seasons.
3. Then I have a pair of Bronze - necked (Geopelia
humeralisJ now sitting. I have had the cock over six years,
several of which he spent with his original mate in a commodious
aviary ; he made nests and sat on them, but she never laid. I

found that he prevented others from nesting, and even destroyed
their nests and eggs, so he had to be removed. Last May I
procured a fresh mate for him, but was for some weeks com-
pelled to cage them. I lately turned them alone into a new small
aviary, bare of shrubs, but with a few natural perches and a
basket tied up ; within ten days the hen laid, and they are
sitting well.
4. The nesting which has given me most satisfaction is that
of a little pair of the Zenaida maculata. It is a rare Dove, indeed
I have never seen any others ; and I fancy the smallest of that
large tribe. I bought them in 1892 of Mr. Abrahams. They are
somewhat larger than the well-known Zebra Dove (Geopelia
striata), with rather hooked beaks. Their plumage is dull, save
for bright green and violet patches on the sides of the neck ; but
their movements are very agile and graceful. They have lived
out of doors in a large aviary, and I never, before this year, saw
any signs of nesting, though the hen may have dropped eggs.
Last winter she looked chilly and poorly, so I transferred her to
the large cage in a bird-house, in which a lot of tender little
Doves winter ; she soon got perfectly well, and in May was
restored to her mate. He showed signs of extraordinary delight,
and before long, to my great surprise, I found them sitting on a
pair of very round eggs, which were soon cracked by the inter-
ference of some troublesome hybrid Doves. The Zauaidas soon
laid again, and this time I transferred their eggs to a pair of
Barbary Turtles ; they hatched one, but apparently they did not
like its diminutive size and neglected it. A third time the
Zenaidas sat, now in a very secure place ; they are the most
devoted of parents, drive Doves twice their own size from the
neighbourhood of their nest, and have a pair of young nearly
ready to leave the nest.
5. Lastly, my Zebra Doves (Geopelia striata) have often
nested and often raised young to the age of sixteen to twenty
days, when they have gone to nest again. The young jump
from the nest before they can fly, and, whether from the parents'
neglect or from the dampness of our climate, I cannot say, go
weak in the legs and dwindle away. I expected a similar fate for
a pair this year ; as usual, they tumbled down and crawled about
lamely; one died, but the other gradually gained strength. It
was lifted to a ledge every night, and the great heat came on in
the nick of time. By degrees wing-power came, and now at the
age of towards six weeks it flies with the wonderful strength
and agility of the parents, and takes good care of itself.

REVIEW.
British Birds, their Nests and Eggs, Vol. II., by A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
The second volume of this popular work on British birds
contains the Orioles, Shrikes, Flycatchers, Swallows, Finches,
Buntings, Starlings, Crows and Larks, and is the pen of Dr.
Butler. It abounds (as did the former volume) with interesting
anecdotes of the writer's experiences ; and if in some cases it
should, with more or less truth, be said that such anecdotes
' point to no moral,' yet no one will deny that they ' adorn the
tale ' and render full of interest what would otherwise tend to
be a dry accumulation of fads. For the more serious parts,
quotations are freely and judiciously borrowed from many well-
known writers, so that the reader is able to find the opinions of
many of the leading scientists placed side by side, and to draw
therefrom his own conclusions.
The illustrations by Mr. Frohawk are excellent and give
remarkably good likenesses of the birds, the positions being
life-like and the detail good. The coloured plates of the eggs
enable one to grasp the general appearance of the egg, but the
colouring is in some cases rather wide of the mark.
While writing of the Great Grey Shrike, Dr. Butler gives
a quotation from Herr Gatke relating the predatory habits of
this species ; but in a thickly populated country such as England,
remarks tending to cause the destruction of any species are far
better unwritten.
In treating of the Swallows, we are regaled with stories of
the author's attempts to keep these species in confinement; and
it is greatly to be hoped that the publication of these failures
will prevent aviculturists from attempting to keep these most
delightful of birds in a cage.
In the article on the Linnet, some novel and interesting
remarks are to be found with reference to the difference in shape
in wing and tail in the sexes. These remarks will not be quite
new to the members of the Avicultural Society, as they have
been already favoured with a paper on the subject from Dr.
Butler in the Magazine, and let us hope that he will find time
to continue his investigations, and to let us know whether the
points mentioned with reference to this species hold good in
other species as well. We are glad to notice that the Doctor has
given up handrearing Linnets ; the handrearing of such birds is,
in our opinion, a practice much to be deprecated : although in

some cases the birds may undoubtedly be tamer, thej r have
rarely the stamina of a wild-caught bird, and but few live to
reach maturity.
The House Sparrow is most properly condemned ; it is
undoubted^ too abundant in this country at the present time,
and, being of a very pugnacious disposition, plays no small part
in driving away many rarer and more beautiful birds, eg., the
Goldfinch, Linnet, etc. If only the 'killing' instinct of the
average British boy could be directed against it, we have no
hesitation in saying that the country would be distinctly the
gainer, both agriculturally and ornithologically. Dr. Butler's
experience of the Tree Sparrow does not coincide with ours ;
with us it has always been a most delightful and sprightly bird,
breeding freely in confinement, though never becoming very
tame.
The following sentence relating to the obnoxious habits of
any particular species, is worthy of serious consideration :--If
man would let nature alone he would find the balance perfedt,
but he interferes everywhere and makes a mess of it.' The
whole of nature is, as it were, a large living being, in which
each unit has its appointed place in Nature's economy, and not
one of these units can be interfered with without the effects
being felt far and wide.
The author's remarks on the Jay leave little to be desired,
although, perhaps, he has hardly said as much about them as of
many other birds. Dr. Butler wonders at the scarcity of its
nests ; but it is owing, we believe, to that apparent scarcity that
it is not much rarer. The fact is that this bird, usually so noisy,
becomes, during the nesting-season, absolutely quiet unless the
nest is actually touched ; and it is owing to the absence of the
usual cries that keepers imagine that Jays do not nest in their
woods, greatly, we are glad to say, to the benefit of the Jay.
We give below a quotation from the article on the Magpie,
which is interesting as illustrating a change of habits similar to
that of the sheep-eating Parrots of Australia, and worthy of
further investigation.
" Although fond of woodland and forest, the Magpie is not stribtly
confined to them, for it often wanders through well-timbered valleys or
even over moorland; whilst in pastures it may not unfrequently be
observed upon the backs of feeding cattle, searching for ticks and maggots.
Referring to this habit, Lord Lilford observes : --' I am assured by an ex-
perienced tenant-farmer in our neighbourhood that he considers this
remedy worse than the desease, as the Magpies, in the search for maggots,

acquire a taste for beef, and cause hideous sores which are difficult to
treat."
Another interesting p issage is also found with reference
to the power of vision in a J ickdaw ; these anecdotes with their
lessons form one of the greatest charms of the book. In this
case we cannot quite agree with the author ; but that is not to
the point, and, were it not for want of space, would like to quote
the passage. What we wish to point out is, that these little
stories, apart from being interesting to the casual reader, compel
him, in spite of himself, to question their accuracy and to
experiment on his own account, adding a fiesh interest to his
private study of birds and, let us hope, not without profit to
ornithologists in general.
The question of the Hooded and Black Crows being
distindt species or not, is well and clearly discussed and worthy
of attention. There are also some interesting and at the same
time astounding notes on the migration of the Hooded Crow.
Throughout the two articles on these birds nothing but invectives
is hurled at them. That they do a certain amount of damage
cannot be denied, but we strongly deny that the damage is as
great as is frequently supposed. To cite one instance : we have
found a nest of young Hoodies in a wood in Norway which was
at the same time filled with Bramblings, Fieldfares, Redpolls,
etc., yet few, if any, of these nests were without their full
complement of eggs or young. The balance of nature is so
adjusted that it requires no help from man ; it is only where man
wishes to rear great numbers of Pheasants, or to beautify his
woods by lopping the trees, that Crows and Hawks get their
food, so to speak, thrown at them, and are then blamed for
trying to re-establish the balance which man has upset.
In the article on the Rook there is a pretty quotation in
defence of the Crow, looked at from the sentimental point of
view. This is another side of the question, which will, we trust,
serve to soften the vindidtiveuess of the preceding articles. No
mention is made with regard to the loss of feathers round the
base of the bill ; as several interesting discussions have been
held on the subject, some notice ought to have been taken. The
question of the Rooks' service, or reverse, to farmers, is neatly
summed up in the following words : --
" In England the Rook is a useful bird as long as it cau obtain a
sufficient quantity of insects and their larvae to support it and its offspring;
but when, owing to protracted drought, it cannot obtain these, it becomes
somewhat mischievous after the fashion of its congeners."

In the article on the Wood Dark, Dr. Butler tells a good
story of how he was taken in by a birdcatcher ; it is evident that
he rather enjoyed it, and his good temper over it is instilled into
the narrative.
At the end of the volume is an addendum containing
notices of species, two of which --Proregulus viridanus and
Phylloscopus proregulus --are genuine stragglers for the first time
to our shores. Another example of Emberiza melanocephala is
mentioned, and also an example of Phyrrhula major. We
cannot agree with Dr. Butler when he doubts the possibility of
distinguishing P. major from P. europcza ; but the foreigner
being so extensively kept as a cage-bird can never be recognised
as British, however frequently it may occur.

<bodyText confidence="0.980592470588235" page_id="32635258"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I n the Spring of last year, a consignment of Polytelis barrabandi
reached this country, and as most of them seem to have lived but a short
time, perhaps it may be useful to some members to know how I have
treated mine, which are now about as fine a pair of birds as one could wish
to see.
I obtained what I thought to be a true pair on the 23rd of April last
year, and turned them into a large cage, supplying them with boiled maize,
hemp- and canary-seed.
The cock, although in very rough plumage, looked healthy and
inclined to live ; but the "hen," which turned out to be a youthful member
of the sterner sex, looked decidedly seedy from the first, and soon died.
Its skin, which I still have, is interesting, as it shows the red feathers 011
the thighs and the rose-colour of the underside of the tail, both of which
are characteristic of the adult female; as well as a few yellow feathers on
the face and red on the upper breast, indications of the adult male plumage :
showing that the plumage of the immature male is identical with that of
the adult female.

From an advertisement inserted in the Avicultuial Magazine I soon
obtained another good hen, although somewhat rough in plumage. During
the Winter months the pair were kept in a small indoor aviary, together
with several small birds, and I found them to be quite amiable towards the
latter. They soon came into grand plumage and grew tails to the length of
nine or ten inches.
At the beginning of May in the present year they were transferred to
a garden aviary, and although there were some cold nights about that time,
they did not seem to feel any inconvenience from the low temperature.
Log nests w?ere provided, but the Barrabands appeared to take no notice of
them and did not attempt to breed.
I feed them on hemp- and canarv-seed and boiled maize fresh daily ;
in addition they get groundsel and plaintain, of which they are exceedingly
fond. I never noticed them to touch any of the soft food provided for the
other occupants of the aviary : they do not care much for the fruit and will
not touch insedts.
My experience of this exceedingly beautiful Parrakeet is that when
once acclimatised it is perfectly hardy, and does not require and, in fadt,
will not touch many of the messes which some writers assert to be
indispensible to its existence in captivity.
In my pair, the hen is slightly the larger of the two.

SiR,--Mr. Phillipps' experience with Poephila acuticauda and P.
personata, as related in the September number, is curious. I have had
both these species this year, and find them both as active and lively as
other finches. The masked Finch is the quieter of the two, and quite
resembles, in its habits, its very near relation the White-eared Finch
(P. leucotis ) ; they? both build nests in a desultory? way r , but have never got so
far as laying eggs with me ; possibly they T are neither pairs.
The Long-tailed Finch seems simply the tropical representative of
the Parson Finch, their manners and customs are identical.
My birds have built several nests, always viciously driving other birds
away from the scene of their operations. I cannot say I expected any?
result in the way of young, as the old birds never appeared to sit; and I was
as much surprised as delighted when I found three healthy? youngsters on a
bough in the aviary this morning.
The nest is built in a basket made of fine wicker-work in the shape
of an egg with a small opening in the centre ; hay seems the only material
employed, but I have not y?et examined the nest carefully? ; the basket is
close to the roof and quite unconcealed. The y?oung birds exactly? resemble
their parents but are generally paler in colour, though the black patch on
the throat is quite distinct, and they? have black beaks.
The parents feed their y?oung from the crop.
I should add that I keep these birds in an indoor aviary ; coming
from a much warmer climate, they? are not likely to be as hardy? as the
Parson Finch. R. A. Todd.

I have a bird obtained from a dealer, which was said to be a Wild
Canary from the Canary Islands, but it seems to be identical with another
bird bought by me as a Citril Finch. I have also a pair of birds sold to me
as St. Helena Canaries, which are quite different from the above. Could you
advise me as to the best way of obtaining a cock bird of the true Wild
Canary ? as I am very anxious to hear its song.

The follosvmg reply was sent to Mr. Harrison :--

<listItem confidence="0.998655666666667">
(1) The St. Helena Canary is the Yellow-vented Serin ( Serinus
flaviventris ) usually known as the St. Helena Seed-eater.
(2) The Wild Canary is not found in St. Helena, but in Madeira, the
Canary Islands, and the Azores ; it is very common in Madeira.
(3) The song and call-note of Serinus canaria resemble those of the
untrained domesticated bird : by " untrained" I mean all excepting Hartz-
mouiitaiu Rollers : the notes, however, are not quite so strong as those of
the typical Norwich Canary.

distinguished by the form of the beak and its more fidgety behaviour ; but
of these matters I cannot speak positively, as I have not kept the species ;
it is however decidedly^ larger, the Citril being four and four-fifths inches
in total length and the Canary just over four and a half inches. The
former is also much greener in colouring 011 the back, with the shaft-
streaks 011 the feathers less black, and the greater wing-coverts are tipped
with y^ellow, (forming a bar across the wing) whereas in the Canary these
feathers have whitish tips : the sides of the body below are moreover
streaked with black in the Canary.
Unless you know of somebody likely to visit Madeira, I am afraid I
cannot inform you where you can get living examples of the Wild
Canary. A. G. BUTLER.
GREEN CARDINALS.
Sir,--- After reading the highly-interesting article of the Rev. C. D.
Farrar in the July number of the Avicultural Magazine , and of his extra-
ordinary success in breeding not only the Green Cardinals but also a great
number of other birds, the fact of my having been fortunate enough
to have bred two young Green Cardinals in my bird-room will hardly bear
recording.

Like many other owners, I have had eggs from various kinds of
foreign birds, but although some Red-headed Finches sat and hatched
young ones, still they did not rear them.
The most extraordinary thing about my pair of Green Cardinals is that
the hen made a nest in a mustard tinwliich stood on the mantelpiece of the
room in which they are kept. The hen did not mind m3 7 securing the tin
with some heavy pieces of wood, and finally hatched out two young ones
after sitting exactly a fortnight; another fortnight saw them sufficiently
large to get out of the nest, and great was the excitement of the parent
birds when the first one left the parental abode.
As food I gave insects, a few mealworms finely minced, eggs, and--
for the last fortnight--the}&apos; have taken to eating canary and millet seed.
After the}&apos; left the nest the cock bird did most of the feeding, the hen bird
taking little notice of them. She has not attempted to nest again.
My bird-room is of considerable height, but not very large nor yet
very suitable, as it only gets the sun for three or four hours. I have had
the parents for nearly two years, but this is their first attempt in bringing
up a family, though I believe the lien laid two or three eggs last year. So
did a Virginian Cardinal, but she escaped at the beginning of the spring ;
but I imagine their shyness would prevent their being successful breeders.
Some years ago a friend of mine had eggs from a Virginian cock
and a Green Cardinal lien, but somehow they were all broken ; but it would
be worthy an attempt, provided a very quiet place could be given, and a
liberal supply of mealworms.
Might I appeal to the Rev. C. D. Farrar to give a description of his
aviary ? I am sure it would be a most interesting paper to a very great
number of subscribers and readers.
Before closing my rather lengthy epistle, I would ask any of the
readers if they have known a case of Sliamas breeding and rearing young
ones in confinement.* F. Moerscheer.

Sir, -- I have recently received a number of Cardinals from Uruguay,
some of the Red-crested species and some of the Black-crested, and am
anxious to know whether I can safely winter them in an outdoor aviary, not
having room for them indoors. This aviary is rather open, and being near
the trees and bushes is apt to be dampish in foggy or rainy weather, which,
in the case of Canaries, I have found more harmful than cold. The
Cardinals were carefully brought over and are in very fine colour,
particularly the Red-crested ones, but seem very wild. Will they have
time to get sufficiently seasoned to stand our muggy climate ?
H. C. Martin.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Martin :
If your aviary is protected against the northerly and easterly
winds I do not think you need be afraid of wintering your Cardinals out of
doors ; they are far more likely to suffer from fog than from cold : it
would certainly have been much better if the birds could have been turned
out in the spring. A. G. BuTRER.
