REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1924
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989850583333334" page_id="56200417"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
In reviewing the past year which completes the thirtieth anniversary
of the Avicultural Society, we are glad to report that we have had a
good year. The membership has steadily increased, though we have
suffered a good many losses through death.
We are very glad to see that Americans are fast becoming keen
aviculturists, and heartily welcome them as members. We would
like to suggest to them that articles on their aviaries and methods
of keeping birds would be much appreciated, and would, we feel sure,
be of great interest to members of the Avicultural Society.
The high price of paper, printing, and postage is still a great handicap
to the production of a good Magazine with the funds at our disposal,
but we hope in the future that this will be considerably better.
It would greatly facilitate the workings of the Society and lessen
the anxieties of the Treasurer if members would remember that all
subscriptions are due on 1st January, 1925, and would kindly pay up
without having to be further reminded.
We would like to tender our hearty thanks to all those who have
contributed to the well-being of the Society during the year : the
authors, the donors to the Illustration and General Funds, and those
who have presented coloured plates. Also we would like to thank
Mr. T. H. Newman for preparing the index for the present volume,
and Miss Chawner for her excellent translations of several French
articles.
(Signed for the Council) E. Maud Knobel,

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before it
is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and he of value as a &amp;apos;permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2 |inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."

What are known as Fancy Pheasants, or in other words, Pheasants
kept solely for their beauty, are well known to Aviculturists, but very
few bird lovers have actually kept them. Before I kept the birds I
used to admire them in other people's aviaries, but after keeping them
myself I have come to the conclusion that they are far more interesting
and beautiful than I could have imagined. The practical hints in
this article may be of some benefit to those who may at some future
date desire to o wn some of the fancy breeds of Pheasants. The breeds
within the reach of the average fancier are the Golden, the Amherst,
the Silver, and the Swinhoe. Other beautiful breeds such as Monauls,
Firebacks, Argus and Peacock Pheasants are still expensive and difficult
to get. A written description of any of these birds is not necessary to
the readers of this Magazine, although outside the rank of Aviculturists
very few people seem to know anything about them. Black and white
photographs of a Golden Pheasant are useless as a means of conveying
their beauty. I do not know any subject that so completely shows
up the inefficiency of photography as a Golden Cock Pheasant. I
used to wonder why so few people kept the Golden Pheasant,
seeing that he is one of the most beautiful birds known, one of the
hardiest, and a very economical feeder. One reason is that many
persons are under the impression that bright-coloured birds are of

tropical origin and therefore difficult to keep, expensive to buy, and
not suitable for an amateur. The Golden Pheasant is also the victim
of bad artists. Take, for instance, the illustration in Cassell's Book
of Birds. This book contains some very good drawings of other birds,
but the one of the Golden Pheasant is atrocious. I saw a coloured
plate of a Golden Pheasant published by a popular poultry paper
that would have been a good representation of a Cock Robin with a
long tail. In order to show the extraordinary lack of intimate know-
ledge of birds that is prevalent I can quote the case of a poultry keeper
who had a Golden Pheasant cock given to him, and thinking it was a
delicate bird, kept it in the attic, and then he wondered why it died.
The Pheasants I have had most experience with are the Golden and the
Amherst, and it is with these two particular breeds I intend to deal,
although the instructions regarding buying, feeding, and housing apply
also to other breeds. In ni} r own opinion the Golden and the Amherst
are the most beautiful of the Pheasants, even if not the most wonderful.
I think the latter distinction is claimed by the Argus. Outside the
Pheasants I cannot think of any bird that can compare with them
in combined colour and shape. The Amherst Pheasant cock in full
plumage has all other birds beaten in point of beauty and form, general
style and balance. I should certainly recommend the Golden Pheasant
as the ideal bird where there is only one breed kept and where the
accommodation is limited. When you have kept these birds a few
years you will find that much of the information you have gained from
books regarding Pheasants requires considerable revision. You also
acquire a thirst for more knowledge on them, only to find that what you
want to know cannot be found in any book. For instance, it is generally
understood that only one adult cock should be kept in an aviary where
there are hen Pheasants. I know now a case where there are four adult
cocks and hens living peaceably together in the same aviary. I remember
also reading that any number of cocks could be kept together if there were
no hens. The first time I tried this, one cock killed the other, although
I have had several together since without mishap. The rules laid
down in books may be sound, but the more experience I get the more
I find that individual cases vary considerably. It does not require
much actual space for an aviary suitable for a pair of Golden Pheasants.

Four to six yards long and two to three yards wide will be sufficient.
The aviary, however, must not be built in a too small, enclosed yard
or garden where there is no outlook, or where there is no free circulation
of air. Pheasants can stand rain, wind, and cold, but not close con-
finement and foul air. Where there is enough space and a desire to
breed, I should recommend an aviary about eight to ten yards long
and three yards wide, and have one Gulden cock and three to five hens.
An aviary can be built against a garden wall, where space is a con-
sideration. About six or seven feet high will be sufficient, have one
half roofed over, and the other half all wire netting. The end of the
roofed part must be boarded, and also about four or five feet on the
front. This will do for shelter and always ensure some dry earth
all the year round for dusting purposes. Divide the aviary into two
parts where the covered part ends, make a small sliding door, connecting
both parts, that can be worked from outside the aviary. An aviary
built like this answers many purposes. It enables the birds to be
fastened in one part whilst the other is cleaned out, and it is also handy
if required to catch a particular bird without disturbing the others.
During the early part of the year the birds can be kept in the covered
part, and this will give the open part a chance of growing fresh grass,
and the earth becoming thoroughly refreshed. When the laying season
commences the Pheasants can be allowed the run of the whole aviary,
and the clean soil, will make the fertility of the eggs highly probable.
It will improve the look of the aviary if two or three shrubs are planted
in the open part. These will come in useful to enable the birds to
shelter from the .sun on hot days.
The Pheasants I have kept all seem to like the rain and evade direct
sun rays. Under the covered part of the aviary have plenty of dry
earth, ground mortar or sand, with an occasional bucketful of burnt
wood ashes thrown in. Where it is not desired to rear any young ones,
four to six cocks can be kept in an aviary this size, but my experience
is that there is an element of danger during the breeding season of the
cocks killing one another should they happen to see any poultry
outside the aviary. This may not be a general rule, but since I have
had a case like this I am giving it for what it is worth. Where there
is plenty of space for an aviary, one can be built of larch poles, wire

netting all over, but boarded up from the ground about two feet all
round. The aviary can be ornamented by extra pieces of small poles.
An aviary like this is very easy to construct and always looks well.
One or two small shelters can be placed inside. An aviary built this
style should be on the large side and not less than eight to ten feet
high. It could be divided up the middle with boards a yard high,
and the rest wire netting, and two pens of Pheasants kept, say Golden
and Amherst, or Silver and Swinhoe.
The aviary being ready, the next business will be to secure some
reliable occupants. I certainly recommend the Golden for those
who have not previously kept Pheasants. They are small, hardy,
strikingly beautiful, they are easy to sell or buy, and extra hens can
generally be procured. The Amherst is not recommended in the
first instance, as it is a more difficult bird to handle. The Silver
Pheasant is much tamer than the Golden, but being a large bird,
requires plenty of room. In handling Pheasants make sure and get
a clean hold round the body over the wings, as it is not safe to catch
by leg or wings as with poultry, and if caught by the tail it will in
most cases come clean out. Pheasants are generally caught by means
of basket traps or nets, but I have never troubled to get these appliances.
Should I want a particular bird, I go quietly into the aviary and
manoeuvre the bird into a corner and grab it with both hands. This
is not easy at first, but in time one gets the knack and it seems no trouble.
Unless, however, one is constantly changing birds there is no need to
catch them. English bred birds will be practically free from disease
after the first winter. Where possible, procure the birds young from
gentlemen who breed a few as a hobby. There are many bred by
amateurs in England and Scotland, also France. You may get the
birds cheaper from foreign dealers, but in most cases you will get
imperfect birds. Perhaps they will have scaly legs, deformed toes,
stiff joints, bad plumage, or a chronic cough. There is also the risk
of birds catching pneumonia when travelling across the sea, especially
in the winter and early spring. Even wFen the birds are guaranteed
perfect you may get landed with some old ones that may be useless
for breeding purposes. You can generally tell an old bird by its slow er
movements, stouter appearance, and fuller plumage, but no matter

what age, they are always described as two years old, in the same way
that an aged horse is generally described as about nine years old. I
have no objection to birds three years old if I am certain of their age,
as the hens lay more eggs at this period of life. However, there need
be no doubt about their age if they are bought before twelve months
old, as the cocks have not attained their full plumage, and the hens
can be told by their inferior size and sprightliness.
When having birds sent from a distance, always stipulate that they
must be sent in draught-proof baskets or boxes of sufficient size.
Open-w&amp;apos;ork baskets are death traps. Where a basket is used, canvas
should be sewn round the inside. There is a peculiarity connected
with the Golden Pheasant cocks which makes them interesting in
another sense than that of beauty alone, and it is the fact that one
seldom finds two alike. They seem to vary considerably in depth of
colouring. For instance, the colour of the crest varies from light straw
to a deeper yellow shade. The yellow on the back and the green
saddle feathers also vary in shade. It would be interesting to know
the exact shades in the wild bird. I have a Golden cock at present
which I have selected out of several that have passed through my
hands, which has a crest the exact shade of polished gold. It is not
orange like the crest of those containing Amherst blood. Now, in the
case of Amherst cocks I have had, there seems very little variation,
and I should have difficulty in telling one from another. There is also
the Golden Pheasant with a dark face and deeper plumage, but which is
not found in the wild state.
It would be difficult to imagine a bird more suitable for the aviary
than the Golden Pheasant. Its gorgeous colouring, sprightly actions, and
its being neither too tame nor too wild, make it the ideal aviary bird.
In addition to this I should say that in proportion to its size it eats less
and makes less dirt than any other bird, no matter of what species.
These points also apply to the Amherst with the exception that this
bird is slightly bigger and not quite as tame. However, after a few
months' experience of the Goldens, a desire to obtain a pair of Amhersts
is the natural outcome. The difficulty with this breed is in obtaining
absolutely pure-bred hens. Unscrupulous dealers will palm off Golden-
Amherst hybrid hens for pure Amhersts. There is no difficulty in

telling the pure Amherst from the pure Golden hen, as they are bigger
and have a hatter head, longer beak, and heavier tail. Also, there is
the bare skin round the eye. A Golden-Amherst hybrid hen I had was
like a big Golden Pheasant with a very small patch of bare skin round
the eye. I should certainly recommend buying the Amhersts before
twelve months old. In buying adults you may get an egg-eater or a
cock that bullies or even kills the hens. This, however, must not
be taken as a general rule, but they seem more vicious in these respects
than the Goldens.
In buying either Golden or Amherst Pheasants it is a good idea
to buy the hens and cocks from different people if possible, so as not
to get too closely related birds. It is surprising how few people
consider this question at all. I heard from a man who told me none of
his Golden Pheasant eggs was fertile. I asked him if the birds were
related, and he said, yes, but did not think it mattered. I exchanged
him a cock, and the result was that next season all the eggs were
fertile. Judging by my own birds, I should say the Amherst is even
hardier than the Golden. They seem quite indifferent to cold and wet,
and will sleep outside on gusty, cold, and wet nights. During the
present season, which was extraordinarily cold in the North of England,
my Golden Pheasant hens laid very badly, but the Amherst hens laid
as usual, and continued laying up to the middle of October. The
Amherst cock has a special stunt which I have not seen mentioned
in any book on Pheasants. It generally occurs in the spring before the
breeding season. Quite suddenly the cock commences to rush from
one end of the aviary to the other end, switching his tail, opening and
closing the wings, and turning round at the ends at full speed, the
flashing of the various colours, red, green, blue, yellow, and white,
producing a wonderful effect. Every Amherst cock I have had has
gone through the same performance at various times. I have never
seen a Golden cock do this particular trick. This display has nothing
in common with the display in front of the hens during the breeding
season.
On account of the Amherst's extra long and beautiful tail, it requires
plenty of room in the aviary, and narrow places, and perches fixed too
near the ground or sides, must be avoided. It is marvellous how the

tails of these birds resume their natural shape and neatness in a few
hours the first dry day after they have been dragged in the wet grass
for days together. When buying an Amherst cock always insist
on its being sent in a very large basket or box, and no other bird in the
same box. If these instructions are disregarded, you must expect
the bird to arrive with the greater part of its tail in the bottom of
the basket.
The display of the Amherst cock during the breeding season is
one of the most extraordinary sights in nature, its collar and tail
being twice the size of its Golden brother. Another point in. favour
of keeping Pheasants is the small amount of attention they require.
A very small amount of wheat, maize, or barley, some short grass,
dandelion, or lettuce, will keep them in perfect condition for nine months
of the year. During the breeding season they can be given some
hempseed, and an occasional feed of biscuit meal, which can be bought
specially prepared for Pheasants. Never give Pheasants more food
than they will eat up immediately. Pine flint grit and a regular
supply of clean water in clean vessels is very necessary to keep them
in perfect condition. Where it is intended to breed a few Pheasants
it is desirable to have the cocks and hens at least two years old. They
will breed at one year of age, but hens do not lay many eggs during
the first season, and if the cock is also a young one, the fertility of
the eggs cannot always be relied upon. I find one cock with three or
four hens gives good results with the Goldens, and one cock to two or
three hens with the Amhersts. The most important thing in breeding
is to have the birds on fresh turf or soil during the laying season. A
good idea is to sprinkle lime on the ground a few weeks before the birds
are turned into the pen. A few bantam pot eggs spread about the
aviary will prevent the birds from pecking the real eggs on arrival.
I have had very little trouble with egg-eaters among Pheasants. I
certainly have cured poultry egg-eaters by putting the hen in a small
pen and giving egg shells every day until the bird got tired of eating
them. The time of the appearance of the first eggs will vary con-
siderably according to position. I bought some Golden Pheasant
chickens this year from a gentleman on the south coast who guaranteed
they were hatched in March. This seems extraordinarily early.

Where I live, in an unsheltered position in the North of England, it is
generally the beginning of May before they commence to lay. Always
remove the eggs as soon as they are laid. A Pheasant hen about
to lay is the antithesis of a poultry hen. Instead of going on to a nest,
she wanders about in a haphazard way, and very often drops the egg
in the middle of the pen. I have known them lay in the watering
trough. It seems to be an exception rather than the general rule
for them to lay in a particular place. In rearing Golden or Amherst
Pheasants on a small scale, it is best to hatch small broods under
bantam hens, preferably the game type. Next season I intend to
try Partridge Wyandotte bantams. I think it is an advantage to
have the hens as near the colour of a Golden Pheasant hen as possible,
as the Pheasant chicks are a long time before they take notice of their
foster-mothers, especially if they are white, or other shades far removed
from that of a Pheasant hen. It is most important that the hens
should be absolutely free from parasites and scaly legs. Always make
the nest on earth, not in a box with a wooden floor. Books state that
Pheasants hatch in 23 or 24 days. The last lot of Amhersts I hatched
were all out of the shell in 22 days. I think the most important
point in hatching Pheasant chicks is to leave them absolutely alone
for two days after they are due to hatch. I find they hatch out better
than chickens if left alone. Sometimes it takes them two days to
get out of the shell after they have chipped. On several occasions
people have written me to say that chicks could not get out of shell.
The trouble has been that they were constantly looking at them and
disturbing the hen. Another point is that in looking to see if chicks
are out you cause the hen to crush those that may be out of shell.
The ideal place for rearing the chicks is on a short cut lawn, where the
pen can be moved at least once a day. Have a pen at least one yard
by two yards. Do not put hay or straw in the coop, but dry earth,
which can be replaced every day. Let the hen, if a small one, run
in the pen with the chicks, and she will eat up all the food lying about.
This may seem extravagant, but it is worth the slight extra expense as
it will prevent the young Pheasants from eating stale food. In damp
weather the chicks will require no water, as they will drink from the
blades of grass. The hen can be fastened in the coop a short time every

day and given water and corn. For the first few weeks the chicks must
be fed every two hours with small quantities of finely chopped hard-
boiled egg. which can be varied with small feeds of Gilbertson &amp; Page's
British meal and milk custard. When ten days old they can be given
a little canary seed and crushed hempseed. Also start giving them
chopped lettuce and spring onions. Gradually get them on to a corn
diet, but keep on with the meal. Don't forget fine flint grit. When
three or four weeks old they are practically out of danger arid will
be hardier than chickens. It is not advisable to let them loose in
a garden during the first few weeks as they may get into crevices
or moss and get lost. They would be all right in a high-walled garden
for a few hours a day, say when one to two months old, where
they would get plenty of insects and small worms, but they must be
taken into the aviary as soon as they show any inclination to fly.
There is a very interesting side-line connected with breeding Golden
and Amherst Pheasants, and that is the production of hybrids. I
have seen at least four distinct hybrids between these birds, all almost
equally as beautiful as the pure-breds. It would be a wonderful
sight to see a dozen hybrid cocks, all different, in one aviary. Seeing
that Jungle Fowl, from which domestic poultry is descended, lays no
more eggs in the wild state than a Pheasant, I have wondered why
Pheasants could not be evolved by selection to lay eggs say until the
end of the year. Cases are known of Pheasants laying seventy eggs in
a season, which is more than some prize-bred bantams lay in a year.
I have two Amherst hens that laid well into October in a small aviary,
and I do not know of any scientific reason why these birds in a large
aviary, with suitable food, and with special facilities to induce them
to scratch for corn, like poultry, should not go on laying another month
or two. A Golden or Amherst hen that could lay 100 eggs in a season
would be a real utility bird, as well as ornamental, and the eggs would
be produced at less cost than the same number laid by poultry. There
may be minor points in connexion with these birds that I have unin-
tentionally omitted, but if these remarks induce others to try these
birds I shall be more than gratified. Interesting as the Pheasants
are from an aesthetic point of view, they are even more fascinating
from a scientific outlook. There is extraordinary scope for further

investigations in the way of discovering new species and sub-species,
new hybrids, etc. It may be excessive imagination on my part to
suggest that there may be undiscovered Pheasants, but it is only eleven
years since the splendid Mikado Pheasant was seen in captivity for the
first time, and amongst mammals we have only known of the Okapi
a little longer.. To my mind the discovery of the Amherst Pheasant
was one of the most interesting and fascinating events ever recorded.
Did any Naturalist ever conjecture that so close a relation to the
Golden Pheasant could possibly exist, and that it could be even more
beautiful than the most beautiful bird known ? Seeing there are nearly
one dozen varieties of the Kaleege Pheasants, is there any reason
why there should not be other varieties of the Thaumalea group which
may equal in beauty the two members already known ? In the
true Pheasants and also the Peafowl. Albinos are well known. I
have not yet heard of a white Golden or Amherst Pheasant. It would
be interesting to know the reason.
In conclusion, I should like to advise all members of the Avicultural
Society, even those not particularly interested in Pheasants, to make
a point of seeing the four volumes of Beebe's Monograph of the
Pheasants. It is one of the finest works of art on birds ever published,
the photographs and coloured plates being very high class. It is a
pity this book is not published in a smaller and cheaper edition, so that
every public library could have a copy. Owing to the adaptability
of the Golden, Amherst, Silver, and a few other Pheasants to aviary
conditions, it does not seem likely that these birds may become extinct,
but other breeds, which in their way are nearly as beautif ul, are in serious
danger of extermination. It is beyond a joke to know that some of
the rare species of Pheasants, which are almost unprocurable here,
are being shot and used as common articles of diet in their native
countries. I hope before long a concerted effort will be made to
preserve these rare birds, by finding suitable places near civilization
where they can be protected, bred, and saved for posterity.

AN ANSWER TO CAPT. G. RATTIGAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982325818181818" page_id="56200371"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I am more inclined to thank Capt. Rattigan for his plain-
spoken criticism of my article on Waxbills, published not long ago in
the Avicultural Magazine, than to regret it; for it gives me an
opportunity of writing more thoroughly on a subject which greatly
interests me, namely, the acclimatization of the different species of
Waxbills. It is necessary for the progress of Aviculture in France and
England that every one of us should clearly explain the results of his
individual experience, and in this I quite agree with Capt. Rattigan.
My first Waxbill aviary was built in 1901, and I have never since
been without some species of this family.
Will Capt. Rattigan allow me to ask him if his acquaintance with
these little birds has been as long ?
For my own part I can assure him that of the species I reviewed
in my article (three or four excepted) I have possessed and observed
more than two or three individuals ! But I quite agree with
Capt. Rattigan that it is often unsafe to generalize too quickly.
1. The principal reason of our disagreement may arise from the
fact that neither Capt. Rattigan nor I have defined the meaning of
the words " aviary " and " hardy ".
It is obvious that when I say that any Waxbill is hardy, the word
is only relatively true : I mean hardy in comparison with other birds
of the same group, and on the distinct understanding that they are well
looked after. I cannot compare the hardiness of a Waxbill with that
of birds of quite different genera--a Peacock for instance, or u Thrush.
Capt. Rattigan, however, seems to set little store by this distinction,
and states that all birds which cannot be wintered in a wilderness
aviary are delicate ! Now, what is a wilderness aviary ? A large
pen naturally planted, but almost completely deprived of any other
shelter. I do not object to this kind of aviary; I think on the contrary
that it might be exceedingly difficult to breed certain species of birds
elsewhere ; but I am also of an opinion that such an aviary is not at all
suitable for the Estrildince (Waxbills), and for two reasons :--
(a) You cannot see these little mites well, and consequent!} 7 you

are unable to observe their habits accurately ; besides which, they can
breed very successfully in a smaller place.
(b) In a wilderness aviary they have practically no shelter against
the wind, the rain, and the cold.
In my former notes on Waxbills I could not enter with any detail
into the question of aviaries, as I did not wish to make my article
too long, M. Delacour having already written on the subject; but
in my opinion the most suitable aviary for Waxbills is one of medium
size, not too high ; the outer pen sheltered from the north and easterly
winds ; a dry and well-lighted house attached to it, with large windows
and a glass door. In this the birds must be shut up from November
to May.
Should this shelter be lighted morning and evening during the
shorter days of the year ? I think so, but I do not say that it is
absolutely necessary, but I do say that artificial lighting will diminish
the number of casualties during the winter months, and this I could
easily prove from my note-books.
It is not necessary to live in a foggy country to need artificial
light in the shelters of certain aviaries. In the long run the light saves
money. Winter nights are too long for small birds, and as soon as
their shelter is lighted in the evening, they immediately resort to the
food-trays. Too long a fast is often the cause of death.
With reference to the heating of an aviary, I do not think
it indispensable for most of the Waxbills ; anyhow not in the part of
France where I am living ; some species, however, and all the birds
which are not in perfect condition when the bad weather sets in, must
be placed in a heated room. For the others, a good shelter, such as
I have described, will suffice : and it is such a shelter that I mean by
" cold glass aviary I have never said or written that a greenhouse
is the ideal place for keeping birds, and Capt. Rattigan is quite correct
when he states that " a more unsuitable situation cannot readily be
imagined for birds
The question of the aviary being settled, I suppose that
Capt. Rattigan will quite agree with me as to the degrees of hardiness
of the different Waxbills.
2. I have stated briefly--too briefly, but I had not space in which

to write more fully--that the Firefinch, Cordon-bleu, Dufresne's and
Black-cheeked Waxbills were as hardy as the other species of the
same family, when acclimatized.
This is the exact truth in respect of the first two species, which I
always keep in the cold shelter of their aviary during the winter.
With regard to the other two species, I think that it is advisable to
give them some artificial heat, from which we must not infer that they
are not hardy, for if kept in a good aviary they will live a long time.
Untimely deaths are almost always caused by exposure to draughts
and w&amp;apos;et.
I find that the Violet-eared Waxbill is hardier than the Cordon-bleu,
and such is the experience of Lord Tavistock, who wrote to me on
the 18th March, 1922 : " My Violet-eared Waxbills were still doing well
when I left home on the 14th. I have taken them in from 18th February
to 1st March, because the hen seemed to have been slightly injured.
She is quite well now, and with the exception of this short period, the
birds have been left at liberty all the winter ." Here is, I think, an
evident proof of the hardiness of this Waxbill!
As to Dufresne's Waxbill, a slight error has crept into my translation,
my article having been originally written in French, and published
in UOiseau. I had written: " This species seemed to me ready to
breed in an aviary " ; but the translation is " not difficult to breed in
captivity " ; which expressed more than I intended. Thereupon
Capt. Rattigan asserts that this species has never been bred in captivity,
" neither in this country (England), nor even on the Continent."
But is he quite certain of it ? Twice in 1914, and later (in 1918,
I believe), I all but reared young from Dufresne's Waxbills. Un-
fortunately, the first time the hen died egg-bound, and on the second
occasion the hen died &amp;apos;when her young were feathered and ready to
leave the nest.
A German aviculturist, Herr Horst Wagner, was also very near
success in 1914 ; but this species has bred at least once in Germany.
Will Capt. Rattigan convince himself of this by continuing researches
in the German periodicals ? He will find in Die Gefiederte Welt , 1910,
p. 367, that Herr Bannier bred this Waxbill successfully.
I could have asserted the fact more boldly, and I have proof for
all I have written, how T ever incredulous Capt. Rattigan may be.

As to the two species of Quail Finches, I believe we are in agreement
that they are easy to breed ; but I would go further and say that in
my opinion they are amongst the easiest to breed in captivity.
Capt. Rattigan will perhaps ask why in this case their breeding habits
are so seldom recorded in avicultural publications. I think it is
because these species (one of them at any rate) have only been imported
in any large numbers comparatively lately; but it is a long time since
they were bred by German aviculturists; for, if I am not mistaken,
both species of Quail Finches were bred in Germany for the first time
about 1880 (cf. Neunzig-VogelzucMbuch, p. 136).

I have been asked by one of its keenest promoters to remind members
of the Avicultural Society of the National Challenge Show' to be held
at the Crystal Palace on 8th, 9th, and 11th February, 1924, and to ask
for support in the way of entries for the Foreign section. There are to
be tw'enty classes and all prize money is fully guaranteed. Exhibits
will receive every care from an experienced attendant. Many
aviculturists feel a very natural desire to avoid the expense, risk, and
worry of sending their best birds to a show. It is, how T ever, well to
remember that shows are most useful as a means of gaining fresh
recruits for aviculture, while hundreds of people who have no chance
of keeping rare birds derive an immense amount of pleasure from seeing
the beautiful exhibits of more fortunate persons. If one makes sure that
one's birds are properly packed, avoids sending very small or delicate
species long journeys by rail unattended, and is careful that an exhibit
is reasonably steady, the danger of illness or loss is very small indeed.

THE TYPICAL FINCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984881909090909" page_id="56200375"  page_num="15" year="" vol="">
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
The only character by which the true Finches are distinguished
from the Weaving-finches is that their tenth primary is shorter than
its coverts ; not a very convincing distinction when one knows how
greatly this little feather varies in different species; yet, for lack of
any record of a more definite structural character by which to separate
these two large groups, it is convenient to accept it. 1
Of the family Fringillidce , the subfamily Fringillinoe , with the
Chaffinches as the most typical, is regarded as representative;
but the late Dr. R. B. Sharpe observes (Catalogue of Birds , vol. xii,
Introduction) : " The line of demarcation between the families
Fringillidce and Tanagridce seems to be an extremely arbitrary one,"
and the late Dr. Sclater, in his Introduction to vol. xi, admits that
the latter are very close to the Fringillidce , whilst Professor Ridgeway
transfers certain genera as being ten-primaried to that family. In any
case, I don't see how the mere dentirostral character of the so-called
maxilla or upper mandible distinguishes the Tanagers from the Chaf-
finches, in which the maxilla terminates in a small but perceptible
tooth.
If ill-defined modifications in the outline of the beak are regarded
as sufficient for the separation of families, why is the extraordinary
modification in the beak of the Crossbills regarded as of no importance ?
In a paper which I published in the Avicultural Magazine (N.S.,
Vol. VI), I argued that the method of nidification in species, being
presumably of earlier origin than slight modifications of external
characters, ought to be taken into account when deciding the relation-
ship of genera and species, and I pointed out that the typical species
of Passer , a genus placed in the Fringillince, in its nesting habits nearly
approached the typical Weaver-birds; P. arcuatus (according to
Stark) not only forming a domed nest with a long entrance tube,
1 In the old days it used to be asserted that the bastard primary was non-
existent in certain families (an error due to the fact that it had not been sought
for), and they were distinguished as 9 and 10-Oscines*

but building in communities, the nests being crowded together in
masses after the manner of the Social Weaver-bird. Our Tree-sparrow
is exceptional, building an open nest in hollow branches or holes in
banks : it is, moreover, a slighter and more sprightly species than
the type of the genus and its allies, with sexes nearly alike and some-
what reminding one of the Song-sparrows of the New World ; this
fact seems to have struck a Chingoio Song-sparrow in one of my
aviaries, for it paired up with a Tree-sparrow, unfortunately without
result.
Now, although the habits of birds should be borne in mind when
a classification is being decided upon, too much stress should not be
put upon it, because it is always liable to modification to suit the
taste or convenience of the species. Thus I have in my collection the
nest of a House-sparrow, somewhat resembling that of a Duck and
taken from the forking branches of a large hawthorn, the eggs therein
being unusually large and aberrant in coloration ; moreover, most
aviculturists will have noticed how birds will sometimes adapt them-
selves to conditions differing wholly from those obtainable in a wild
state when they are kept in cage or aviary.
Wherefore, since no classification wholly satisfactory to all ornitho-
logists has hitherto been agreed upon, one must fall back upon the
admittedly unsatisfactory classification published in the Museum
Catalogue of Birds.
The Fringillince, then, are birds which, for the most part, build
open saucer- or cup-shaped nests, though some build domed receptacles
for their eggs. At first they feed their young from the crop, but later
upon insects, spiders, and centipedes, some species probably also giving
them small worms. The adult birds not only feed upon these articles
of diet, but upon green food, berries, or fruit, and especially on seed.
They vary exceedingly in their dispositions, some being vfild, vicious,
and difficult to tame, whereas others are gentle, confiding, and speedily
contented in partial captivity.
Being largely seed-eaters the typical Finches are easy to cater for,
but judgment should be exercised in the selection of seeds suitable
to the various species, canary, the various millets, oats, hemp, German
rape, thistle, and teazel being most frequently required.

These birds naturally feed more freely upon insects than many
other Finches, and begin to give their young undigested food before
they leave the nest. They can be kept for some time upon seed alone--\0x25A0
canary, oats, millet, German rape, and hemp--but they do better
when they have plenty of insects, spiders, etc., and green food. When
on the ground they usually walk or run ; their song is loud and rapid,
generally terminating in a double note ; their note of defiance is a sharp
chick more or less often repeated, with a slight w-sound before the k.
In the Brambling, however, a harsh grating note like that of the Green-
finch is substituted.
Our European Chaffinch and Brambling are, of course, well known
to us all, and perhaps the only fact not generally observed is that the
young of the Chaffinch when being fed in the nest wag their heads from
side to side, so that if hand-reared it is almost impossible to feed
them without smearing their faces with the food. Whether this is also
true of the Brambling I cannot say, as I have never had nestlings
of that species.
Blue Chaffinch (Fringilla teydea)
This is the largest and the most aggressive species of its genus.
Its prevailing colours in the male are slate-blue above, but the coverts
are tipped with wffiite tips to the coverts, a wffiite speculum at base of
primaries, and the centre of abdomen and under tail-coverts wffiite ;
in the female the blue is replaced by olive-brown.
Living specimens of this rare bird were imported by Mr. Meade-
Waldo and also, I understand, by Mr. Scott B. Wilson. It inhabits
a pine-forest in the island of Teneriffe.

The late Mr. Abrahams imported some of these birds from Madeira
about 1895, and kindly gave me a pair; They struck me as being more
confiding than our European species and less excitable. The song
was louder and the note of defiance was repeated four or five times
whereas our bird is generally contented with two utterances.
The Canarian Chaffinch, which has been imported from time to

these birds consists of canary, German rape, hemp, thistle, teasel,
dandelion, and maw-seed ; also flowering and seeding heads of all
forms of thistle, groundsel and dandelion, and aphides whenever
obtainable.
European Goldfinch (Carduelis elegans)
This bird is too well known to need description ; it varies greatly
in size and I have had examples caught in Kent barely, if at all, smaller
than the Siberian form (C. major). The female is a little smaller than
the male, less alert, its beak is perhaps slightly less straight, the crimson
blaze on the face rather narrower, the white on cheeks and under parts
more suffused with brown, the rump distinctly browner, wing browner,
the yellow band across the wing narrower and primrose yellow instead
of narcissus-yellow in adult birds. If turned out into a good-sized
aviary the day they are caught I have found these birds quite indifferent
to my presence therein, whereas purchased cage-specimens have been
very wild for some time afterwards. There is no difficulty in breeding
the species in captivity.
Eastern Goldfinch (Carduelis caniceps)
Differs from the European bird in the absence of black from the
head, white from the nape, the restricted crimson blaze, more pointed
beak and white-bordered inner secondaries. In all its habits it appears
to closely resemble C. elegans. Habitat: Himalaya.
I am satisfied that the Greenfinches ought to be placed in the
Fringillince, not only because they approach the Goldfinches in the
colouring of their wings and the strong-billed Serins (S. albigidaris
and S. sulphuratus) in the character of their beaks, but because they
cross freely with the typical Finches, the resulting hybrids are perfectly
intermediate in colouring and in some instances apparently fertile. 1
I feel certain that when the whole of the known species of the family
Fringillidce have been studied anatomically the subfamily Coccothrau-
stince will have to be considerably restricted.
1 Their songs, apart from the terminal note of defiance, which approaches
that of the Brambling, are very like that of a vigorous Norwich Canary ; the
eggs also (apart from their slightly superior size) are very similar.

This familiar little bird is one of the most confiding of the Finches,
and can be enticed on to one's hand with a little maw-seed three or
four days after it has been captured ; at least that is my experience,
but most birds soon become tame with me. The nest of the common
Siskin, like that of the Goldfinch, is a beautiful compact and softly
lined little cup, the eggs small, five or six in number, usually pale
bluish-green, speckled, spotted and sometimes streaked with dark
brown, and with lilacine grey shell-markings ; more often than not
the nest is built high up on a branch of a fir or beech tree, but there
are said to be exceptions to this rule.
American Siskin (Chrysomitris tristis)
This and the other species of imported Siskins are described in
my Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary , and are generally well
known by aviculturists, so that it appears to me unnecessary to
re-describe them in the present article. The American Siskin, or*
" Goldfinch ", as it is often called, constructs a somewhat similar
nest to that of our bird in trees or bushes, some being situated high
up in the forks of branches, but others not more than three feet above
the ground ; the eggs vary from three to five, and are of the same type
as those of our bird. The favourite food consists of the seeds of thistles
and other composite flowers, but in winter they feed chiefly on seeds
of the sycamore and such seeds of weeds as are left exposed above the
snow. They usually only rear one brood in the year. As is the case
with most cage-birds, this Siskin is less frequently imported than
formerly owing to the law for the protection of wild birds. I have not
heard the song, but it is said to somewhat resemble that of the Canary.
Yarrell's Siskin (Chrysomitris yarrellii)
A Brazilian bird not often imported, but which has been exhibited
at the London Zoological Gardens and has from time to time found its
way into the collections of various aviculturists (my own among
others). It is a fine songster, but practically nothing has been recorded
as to its wild life.
The following species from the New World have also been imported---
the Arkansas Siskin ( C. psaltria ), Colombian Siskin (C. colombiance),

Yellow-bellied Siskin ( C . xanthogastra) , Yellow-rumped Siskin ( C.
uropggialis), Black Siskin (C. atrata), Black-chinned Siskin (C. harbata),
Black-headed Siskin (C. icterina), an excellent songster of which I
imported a specimen from the Argentine in 1893 ; unhappily it appears
to be a delicate bird, and mine, like other imported examples, did not
long survive. Then there is the strangely coloured Hooded Siskin
( C . cucullata), the&amp;apos; prevailing colours of the male being scarlet and
black, and the Pine Siskin ( C . pinus ), a sombrely coloured species,
but said to have a soft melodious song. The Totta Siskin (C. totta),
from. South Africa, is also rather dull-coloured, but has been far more
frequently imported than the American species, though its song is
certainly inferior. Messrs. Stark and Sclater evidently considered
it more nearly related to the Serins than the Siskins. The Indian
species (C. spinoides) was declared by Hume not to be a Siskin at all:
he says that its note resembles that of a Greenfinch, but it does not
belong to the same genus and he adopts for it the generic name
HypacantMs.
Serin-finches or Canaries
These birds are known to be good songsters, but they differ con-
siderably from each other in the merit of their performances. They
are easy to keep, canary, millet, oats, German rape and a little hemp,
with chickweed, groundsel, and, when breeding, a little soft insectivorous
or egg-food being all that they need. They naturally build a softly
lined open nest in a bush, shrub, or fruit tree ; but in captivity will
take advantage of a prepared Hartz-cage or a shallow square box
hung upon the wire or wall of an aviary, or less frequently in an ordinary
breeding-cage. By nature they are less confiding than the Siskins,
though when hand-reared, like many other birds, they are perfectly
tame and companionable.
European Serin (Serinus hortulanus)
This bird, which is believed to be merely a sub-specific form of
the wild Canary, ranges eastwards into Asia Minor, Palestine and
Egypt. It can be freely crossed (and produces fertile offspring) wfith
the domesticated Canary. A hen of this cross was given to me in 1896.
The prevailing colour of the upper parts in the male Serin-finch is

olive brown, with black centres to the feathers, and of the under
parts bright yellow heavily streaked with black, more so than in other
well-known Canaries. Its song is said to approach that of the European
Siskin.
The imported African Canaries are too well known to aviculturists
to need a full description ; moreover, most of them are illustrated'
in my Foreign Finches in Captivity.
Green Singing-finch (Serinus butyraceus)
Shelley (Birds of Africa, vol. iii, p. 193) identifies the S. icterus
of my Foreign Finches with the Linnean species; S. barbatus,
which the late J. Abrahams thought distinct, he rightly places as a
synonym of the same. This bird is more boisterous and quarrelsome
than some of its relatives ; it is by no means difficult to get it to build
a nest and lay, but I was never successful in breeding it, the creamy
eggs, spotted with buff, speedily disappearing from the nest. I believe
the cock bird devoured them. Shelley describes the eggs as pale bluish,
sparingly spotted with pale reddish-brown, after the manner of most
Canaries, Siskins, Goldfinches, Linnets, etc., but Ross' description
corresponds with mine. The song is loud, bright, but short, and far
inferior to that of some of its allies. According to Shelley Hartlaub's
Seed-eater has been confounded with this species, so that it has probably
been imported under the name of Green Singing-finch. It is a common
West African bird and very closely related to the above.
Saint Helena Seed-eater (S. flaviventris)
I see no reason for adopting Shelley's name of Marshall's Canary
for this bird. It has probably been introduced (as that author suggests)
from South Africa, and has subsequently been slightly modified ;
moreover, similar examples occur freely in South Africa. It is the most
striking species of the genus, in my opinion, and has a delightful and
powerful song somewhat resembling that of our Skylark. It is said
to breed freely with the domesticated Canary, but when I placed the
two together in a flight-cage, as also in an aviary, it showed such
animosity towards the hen that I had to remove her. The female of
the St. Helena Seed-eater differs considerably from the male, being
mostly greyish-white where the male is yellow, brownish on crown

and back, and heavily streaked with black both above and below.
In its wild state it is said to nest in hedgerows.
Sulphur-coloured Seed-eater (S. sulphuratus)
A more clumsily formed relative of the preceding, common in South
Africa and northward in East Africa to Masai-land. It has a powerful
beak, but I found it quite peaceable when associated with other birds ;
nevertheless, one must not judge the character of a species by an
individual. My bird sang very little, and its song was insignificant,
but both Stark and Russ speak highly of its performance. In its
wild state this Serin generally builds its nest in a low bush ; as with
most Canaries the eggs are much of the usual character, white or
bluish-white, with or without a few black spots or irregular markings
at the larger end, according to Stark, but it is probable that these
markings vary in colour, as in other species, to reddish-brown with
purplish or lilacine shell-spots.
Cape Canary (S. canicollis)
Another thick-set bird, mostly bright yellow&amp;apos;, but with the upper
surface greyish-green. It has a pleasing song, which Russ likened to
that of a Lark, but to me it more nearly resembled that of a Roller-
canary. My example was not quarrelsome. In Africa it nests in
low bushes, and &amp;apos;taws three or four bluish-white eggs spotted at the
larger end with purplish or reddish-brown.
White-throated Seed-eater ( S. albigularis)
The heaviest and least attractive of all the Canaries, but said to
have a pleasing song, its prevailing colour is brown, the rump and
upper tail-coverts olive-yellow, and the throat and centre of under-
parts white. My bird, being a hen, never sang a note. In South
Africa it builds in a bush and lays three or four bluish-white eggs,
either spotless or with one or two purplish-black spots or hair-streaks
at the larger end. It has a very powerful beak and can bite severely.
Yellow-rumped Serin (S. angolensis)
A delightful little bird which unhappily I never possessed. It
differs chiefly from the well-known Grey Singing-finch of North-Eastern
and Equatorial Africa in its yellow instead of w r hite rump, yellow-

tinted primaries and axillaries and brownish forehead. Its song
has been stated to excel that of its grey relative, though that seems
hardly conceivable. The wild life has been imperfectly studied,
but the eggs laid in captivity are said to be bluish-white, three in
number, either unspotted or more or less spotted with brown.
Grey Singing-finch (S. leuco&amp;apos;pygius )
This tiny Serin was always my favourite, not only because of its
charming Lark-like song, repeated at short intervals from morning
to night, but because of its untiring activity, graceful flight, and
pleasing quiet colouring. Two or three cocks in the same aviary
seem thoroughly to enjoy sparring, and sing the whole time, doing
but little or no injury to one another and being on excellent terms
shortly afterwards. The eggs of this bird are creamy or pearly white,
sometimes with a few small black spots at the larger end, though
Von Heuglin describes them as greenish-grey, spotted at the larger
end with brownish-red and dusky brown.
Himalayan Seed-eater (S. pusillus )
The prevalent colour of this bird above is blackish-brown with
yellow borders to the feathers, the upper tail-coverts with ashy whitish
borders, the forehead orange-red, breast -and sides of body bright
yellow, the former spotted, the latter streaked with black ; the female
duller and paler. This bird inhabits the Caucasus and North Persia
to Turkestan, wintering in Asia Minor as far as the Lebanon and in
the North-Western Himalayas. Apparently this bird nests in the
branches of trees ; its eggs are described variously as stone-white
with small red-brown spots on the larger&amp;apos; end and delicate bluish-
white, with a zone of blackish spots and reddish-brown specks and
streaks round the larger end. In its habits the species would seem
to approach nearer to the Siskins and Goldfinches than to the African
Serins. The nests of all these birds are similar in type ; but, as every-
one who has ever collected nests and eggs must be well aware, the
individual nests of every species vary considerably in accordance
with the materials available when they are constructed, so that little
can be gained by describing them in detail.

Although my birds have often been written about, there may still
be something of interest to tell of, but truly in order to thoroughly
appreciate them, one has to see them in their surroundings, for it is not
only the birds themselves which are attractive, but also their environ-
ment and the different moments and hours in which one sees them in
their different seasons. I might say that it is not only a matter of seeing,
but also of hearing, for at night as I lie in bed there come in at the open
windows the calls of Flamingos, Bar-headed and Bernicle Geese, and of
many species of Duck, for the moat and one of the ponds is within a
stone's throw. A pair of Stanley Cranes are there of a night, for they
always make a point of standing in the shallower water, as if they feel
there may still be African beasts of prey about; whilst further off,
especially if a stray dog or fox is near, the trumpeting calls of the
Australian, White-necked, and Manchurian Cranes ring out in the
darkness, each pair of birds keeping to its own particular meadow,
the Australians (Native Companion) not infrequently accompanying
the cows into the yard at milking time. For several years they and the
other two species have had two clutches of eggs, but no young, and I
have quite a large collection of the eggs of all three kinds. The Ducks
are the flowers of winter, for when all is faded in the garden and the
leaves have fallen, they are in full plumage--Summer Duck, Mandarins,
European Widgeon and Chiloe, Pochard, Tufted, Scaup, Yellow-bills,

Spot-bills, Gargeney and Cinnamon Teal, White-faced and Red-billed
Tree Duck, etc. ; and these last two species are extraordinarily tame,
collecting round a gardener when he is digging, handicapping his work
by walking over his feet, and assembling round his spade ; indeed, if
they can, they will walk into the house, and some of the Red-billed
lose their tempers when they have to be literally pushed out; then they
will turn and peck one's hands, tweaking one's flesh with the tips of
their bills almost painfully. But, as I have said, their beauty is enhanced
by their surroundings ; first the general view of the ancient stone and
half-timbered walls of the house, roofed in stone tiles, from which spring
the Elizabethan red-brick chimneys, and at one point a stone one of the
fourteenth century, the chimney of the banqueting hall. The old house,
with its latticed windows, surrounded by its moat and the two ponds
fed by springs, whose water in turn supplies the moat. The house,
settled down in its little valley, sheltered to the north, west, and south-
east by the wooded hills, so characteristic of many parts of Hereford-
shire, and when the moon, towards eventide, rises up from behind them
one stands by the ponds edged with vast plants of Gunnera manicata to
watch the Ducks, at times numbering about ninety, feeding in the clear
shallow water, where the Flamingos also come to squabble and grunt
and twist their long necks at one another, instead of peaceably feeding
on the grain thrown into the water. Every winter three or four wild
Teal come, and finding how undisturbed they are, will swim about
amongst the other Ducks, within a few yards, indeed almost feet, of
one ; and two Herons have lost their timidity to such an extent that
they will sit on the stone wall outside the kitchen windows, between
which and the wall there is but a narrow paved walk, and literally look
in at the cook ! I have often seen one of them on the lawn when I have
gone out to give the Pekingese dogs an airing, and that Heron has merely
walked to the other end ; or else flapped quietly to the edge of the moat,
or into an orchard close by. Such is the behaviour of wild birds, when
they discover that they are unmolested. The ponds and moat teem with
rudd, and the Herons can take as many as they like, and welcome !
The Kingfishers come for them also.
In an orchard one apple-tree is styled " Cockatoo Castle ", for there
are assembled some dozen Australian Rosy Cockatoos, whose dining-

parlour, in the form of a roomy shelter on legs, can be walked into from
the branches of the tree which push against it. It is open only on the tree
side, and the grain is always dry--sunflower seed, wheat, and oats. The
Cockatoos clamber down and walk in the orchard, picking at grass stems
and so on, but they know their own particular tree, and when their
clipped wing-feathers are moulted I have every hope that they will
remain. Lord Tavistock says they won't. Monsieur Delacour has some
full-winged ones at Cleres in Normandy, and very jolly they look. At
first they were very wild--mine--but they know me now, and I never
pass by " Cockatoo Castle " without calling out to them, or without
receiving an answering hale. Sometimes, picking up the " crumbs "
which fall from their table are wild Turkeys, white Peafowl, and a pair
of Demoiselle Cranes, besides Barbary Doves, whose own home is in
an aviary close by, into which they go in and out through a small
aperture, in the window of the roosting-house, after the manner of
domestic Pigeons, and that aviary is also occupied by a pair of Monauls.
The inmates of the larger aviaries have often been mentioned,
but birds come and go, and very often go when one does not want
them to, so that there are fresh ones to write of, such as a magnificent
pair of Victoria Crowned Pigeons, a Javanese Jungle Cock, a pair
of Satin Bower Birds, the male not yet in colour ; a brood of Queen
Alexandra Parrakeets of 1923, and a pair of Red Jungle Fowl given
to me by Monsieur Delacour. My seven Trumpeters are hard to
beat in fascination, and impossible to compete with, except for the
Tree-ducks, in tameness. I dare hardly write to boast that we
are seven ", for fear that death will overtake some of them, especially
as Wordsworth composed that charming and pathetic poem after one
of his visits to Brinsop Court, wdiere he often stayed with his brother-
in-law and sister (the Hutchinsons), who lived there in his day. And
if my Trumpeters die, where is my boasting, unlike other peoples' ?
I have three species: three grey-backed, three dusky, and one
green-backed. For nine months of the year, or at any rate eight,
they can be out, and roost high up in a big acacia. They are chiefly
fed upon a good pheasant-meal, but they love cheese and fruits and
various titbits, and pick up worms, etc., in the summer-time.
If they can follow me across the paved walk under the pergola which

divides the larger pond from the moat, they will; but the doors of the
house have to be rudely closed against them, or else they would be
found in the Oak parlour, or the Queen Anne parlour, or the Words-
worth parlour, jumping amongst the china or on one's writing-table.
Undefeatable birds ! They rush to one, curtseying at one's feet with
outspread wings, and then comes that astonishing chorus, each one
taking up the refrain in quick turn, commencing with harsh clattering
notes and ending in the deep-down ventriloquial booming. The
green-backed species draws out his notes in a longer, more melancholy
sound, as if he were mourning or had a very bad pain in the abdominal
region. A rather smaller bird than the other two species, with the
same black velvety head and sombre under parts, but the upper parts
are deep, very deep green, and on the shoulders there are flashes of
metallic blue, and the grey-backed have lovely fore-necks with peacock
blue on them, and all have pale green legs and feet. They are great
bathers. I keep them in during the worst of winter days, where there
is a heated radiator, and how they do beg to be let out.
Amazing birds ! If I have to catch a Yokohama Bantam or a White
Peafowl, or even a Pekingese dog, they join in the chase, and literally
enabled me on one occasion to lay hands on a White Peacock, who
had to be " sacked " owing to his nasty temper, which he gave vent
to by jumping on the stone wall which surrounds the aviary yard,
and spurring at everyone's head, ladies included. Drive him off ?
You couldn't. So I said, " Very well, my friend, you must go, in
spite of your gorgeous white lace train," and I began the chase. The
Peacock, discerning that I was in earnest, jumped over the wall and
away across the orchard ; and over the wall came the Trumpeters,
rushed after him, headed him off, so that at last whichever way he
turned, the Trumpeters were there, booming and pecking for all they
were worth, until finally the Peacock took refuge in a clump of bamboos,
where he squatted hoping he was concealed, and amidst the triumphant
shouts of the Trumpeters, I laid my hands on him ! It was they
who really caught him. A pity the scene could not have been
cinematographed !
On moonlight nights in summer I hear them booming when at
roost. A weird sound.

They look so innocent, but their means of defence and attack
is not only a quick rush and a very sharp pecking, but also a most
distracting opening and "shutting of their wings in the face of their
opponent, just as if one were to quickly open and shut an umbrella
at anyone's face. They even dismayed and routed a most pugilistic
and sturdy Ho-ki (Eared Pheasant) by this means. He fought for
a time, leaping above a Trumpeter and trying to strike him with his
spurs, but those wings were too much for him, and he finally decamped,
looking extremely puzzled and mortified. " A bird half my size from
the New World to defeat an ancient Chinese like me ! Oh, vile one ! "
I could not write down the language that I think he used. He too
had finally to go, for he spurred at all and every human who entered
his domain, besides murdering a tame Golden Pheasant which had
always kept to one part of the garden for some seven years. Horrible
bird ! and his stupid wife wandered off to nest in the woods and was
finally seen no more. How could the red fox resist when she entered
his domain ? And that was the end of my Ho-kis, for I gave away some
that had been reared the year before.
I have Regent Birds: one of the beautiful Bower Birds of
Australia, which species Mr. Reginald Phillips. bred years ago in a
small back-yard in West Kensington : they say that the male takes
at least three years before he assumes his gorgeous black and orange
colouring. Mine are in immature plumage. In the house, I hesitate
to say how many cage-birds I have, each in a separate cage ; let us say
eighteen, and the rest!
Two Nightingales, a Shamah, an Orange-headed Ground-thrush,
a Rose-breasted Grosbeak, two species of Robin-chats (African),
some Roller Canaries, a Hooded Siskin Canary Mule, a Red Cardinal,
some Red-capped Parrots (Pionopsittacus pileatus), a Yinaceous
Amazon, really the property of the lady of the Court, and last, but by
no means least, a Grey Parrot, who is human. In the morning he
always says : " Hullo, my darling, how are you ? " If a Blue Yucatan
Jay comes into the house, which it always does if it can, and the Parrot
sees me chasing it out, he at once says : " Now, go on, go on." If
the Pekingese bark too much, he says, " Now, now, now," mentioning
different dogs by their names, and when dinner is finished and he is

By J. Delacour
Monsieur Delacour, in a letter to Mr. Astley on the 23rd of November
of last year, gives an interesting account of what he saw in India on
his way to collect in Indo-China. He wrote : " I have just left Calcutta
and shall arrive at Rangoon on Monday. I greatly enjoyed my visit
to Darjeeling, with its wonderful scenery and cool climate.
Unfortunately, at this time of the year one sees very few birds there :
only Pekin Robins ( Leiothrix ), Black-headed Sibias, Niltavas, which
latter are common, Yuhinas and several Tits, as well as, of course, the
ubiquitous Vultures, Kites, and Mynahs. The Director of the little
local museum, Mr. C. Inglis, has been thirty-four years in India, and
is a keen ornithologist. He has a good collection of skins of Game
Birds. It is he who collected the Pink-headed Ducks, and he says
that they are still numerous in some spots.
" On the Bengal plain, which is very similar to that of South
India, one sees quite a lot of birds along the railway line : Halcyons
and Kingfishers, Drongos, Tree Pies, Common and Pied Mynahs,
different Doves, Rollers, Bee-eaters, Shrikes, Bulbuls, and quantities
of Waders, Herons, etc.
" I spent two very busy days with Mr. David Ezra, who gave me
a great reception. His garden is crowded with birds. In the centre
is a lawn where he keeps antelopes and giant tortoises, as well as deer,
etc. ; and there too the different Cranes and Peafowl are allowed to
exercise twice a day, which are otherwise kept in small paddocks or
aviaries. His collection includes, besides the antelopes, a beautiful
pair of Flying Squirrels, Diana, Long-nosed and Golden Rhesus

An interesting pamphlet has been received from Major S. S. Flower,
Director of the Cairo Zoological Gardens, dealing with the above subject,
the actual title being " List of birds of prey 1898-1923, with notes on
their longevity ". It can be obtained from the Government Publications
Office, Ministry of Finance, Dawawin P.O., Cairo.
The list does not, except in certain cases, reveal a striking measure
of success from an avicultural point of view, for birds of prey are
naturally long-lived and the average period for which many species
managed to survive is distinctly short. It is only, however, by the careful
collection of data such as Captain Flower has provided and by
recording failure as well as the reverse, that it becomes possible to

estimate the fitness or otherwise of different species for exhibition in
public collections and the difficulties likely to be encountered in their
management.
One real triumph in bird-keeping is recorded in the list--an Osprey
still alive after ten years in captivity. Few birds have such a hopelessly
bad record in confinement as this beautiful Hawk and it would seem
that only hand-reared birds ever survive more than a few weeks, or
even days. Speaking generally, the birds of prey which seem to have
done best are the carrion feeders--Kites and Vultures, and it is probable
that this is the case in Zoological Gardens elsewhere. The circumstance
rather suggests that in some cases better results would be achieved with
the smaller Hawks, Falcons and Owls, as well as with the more delicate
Eagles, if the birds were fed more carefully. Freshly-killed mice,
sparrows, pigeons, rabbits and guinea-pigs, as well as cockroaches
and mealworms, can always be obtained with a little additional trouble
and expense, yet how often does one see a lump of butcher's meat
(generally covered with sand) or a fowl's head of uncertain age provided
for the repast of a bird of prey accustomed to touch nothing but game
of its own killing ! That bad feeding, rather than lack of exercise, is
responsible for the early demise, in public collections, of the smaller
Owls at any rate, is indicated by the much greater measure of success
achieved with these birds by certain private avicnlturists whose accom-
modation may be far from ample. By means of a varied diet of freshly-
killed small birds, mice and mealworms--the latter being most
essential--the &amp;apos; Editor has kept a Pearl-spotted Owlet (Glaucidium
perlatum ) alive for the past five years. This little bird was adult when
caught, and arrived with its upper mandible so badly damaged that it
soon fell off and has never grown again. In spite of this handicap,
however, he has managed to survive, though occasionally needing hot-
room treatment for colds caught during the moult. He is kept in a
cage about 3 feet square, and is let out daily for an hour or two's
exercise in a room.
The following extracts will give some idea of the information to be

HOW SETTLEMENT AND OTHER FACTORS

By A. S. Le Souef, C.M.Z.S., Taronga Park, Sydney.
Australia, with its immense spaces, varying climate and seasons,
has a noticeable ebb and flow of bird life. One can only get a fair idea
as to how our avian life is faring by extended observations in one district.
Specially valuable in this respect is the work of Mr. Isaac Batey (The
Emu, vol. vii, p. 2), and the interesting paper by Mr. Neil McGilp (The
Emu, vol. xxii, pp. 237, 274).
A point that may be stressed is the immense difference made in

A. S. Le Souef --
bird life by the season. Under favourable conditions, the rule is, in
many species, for large clutches and two or three hatchings in the year.
In dry times, not only may no birds be reared, but many of the adults
may perish.
It can be stated with confidence that in an average year many more
birds are hatched than can survive. Every adult pair rears from one
to nine or more young, yet at the beginning of the following season the
average numbers are about the same, natural mortality being 100 per
cent per annum, the chief governing factors being food supply and
natural enemies.
Observations of the Blue Wren or Superb Wren-warbler (Malurus
cyaneus) in Taronga Park, Sydney, extending over several years, are
interesting in this respect. In an area of 40 acres of open bush, flower
gardens, lawns, etc., we have four families of this species, each containing
about six birds, or twenty-four in all. Each family group averages two
clutches a season, bringing off six young birds, a total increase of
twenty-four for the whole park. As the park faces the harbour, and
every suitable living area in the vicinity is already occupied, the
Wrens have no room for expansion, the area is " Malurus replete
The average numbers do not vary from year to year, and as there are
practically no natural enemies, food supply is apparently the limiting
factor.
There has been a very decided disturbance of bird life in our settled
districts, some species being seriously reduced in numbers. Only
by a study of the causes of this disturbance can we hope to
deal intelligently with the matter.
In attempting to define these causes, no hard and fast rules can be
laid down, as some species may be affected by a variety of factors.
The main points may be stated to be in order of importance :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978959428571429" page_id="56200430"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
(1) Settlement, disturbance of natural conditions.
(2) Introduction of the fox, cat, rabbit, starling, etc.
(3) Laying poison for rabbits ; poisoning species that are destructive
to crops or stock.
(4) Trapping for the market.
(5) Shooting of game birds.
Settlement has its effect in two ways. First, the clearing of the

forests and scrub lands deprives certain species of their environment;
secondly, disturbance of the pastures by stock and rabbits drives away
birds that are dependent on the seeds of grasses and herbs, or are of
a nervous and retiring disposition.
The felling of timber and scrub is, however, not all loss as far as
bird life is concerned, for the clearing of the land opens up the way for
its occupation by types which live in the open. The net result may not
be very great, but the change in species is decided. Other things being
even, it is wonderful how quickly the Magpie (Gymnorhina) , Grallina,
Pipit ( Anthus ), and Larks, occupy the vacant area. The Superb Wren-
Warbler and the Yellow-tailed Thornhill follow up the scrub-loving
Acanthiza and Sericornis.
The principal birds affected by these disturbing factors appear to
</bodyText>

be the--
Mallee Fowl ( Leipoa ocellata), Black-breasted Quail ( Turnix

Southern Stone-Curlew (Burhinus magnirostris), *Scarlet-shouldered or

harrabandi ), and Smoker or Regent Parrot ( P . anthopeplus) .
In the main, those species that range beyond the settled areas
are yet quite in their normal numbers, while the few that are confined
in their habitat (marked with an asterisk) are scarce.
The Mallee Fowl, although enjoying a wide range, appears to be
nowhere numerous, and to have disappeared from some of its haunts.
This species is the victim of the fox, which has spread over its entire
habitat with the exception of North-West Australia.
The Black-breasted Quail apparently never has been very numerous,
and seems to have quickly disappeared before settlement.
The Bronzewing, Flock, Squatter, and Wonga Pigeons are affected
by settlement, not only in the altered environment, but from the fact
that they are " game birds " to the average man and boy whenever

met with, and they seldom get a chance to establish themselves in
" man's sphere However, the first three mentioned have an immense
range over the continent in districts where they should be safe for
generations to come. The Wonga Pigeon has found an unexpected
haven in the prickly pear area.
The Nutmeg Pigeon (Myristicivora hicolor), that nests on islands off
the Queensland Coast, being isolated and easily procured, will need
special watching. It has been reported that these birds, as well as
" Australian Noddy " eggs, are being sold in San Francisco. It would
be extraordinary if they were not exploited for food purposes by the
trepang fishers operating along the Barrier Beef. " Wonga Pigeon "
appears on the bill of fare on the Union liners trading to America. The
birds are not Wongas, but might easily be the Nutmeg Pigeon.
The Southern Stone-Curlew is another species that the fox finds no
difficulty in getting. The habit of the bird in advertising its presence
at night by its plaintive call helps Beynard to locate him.
The Bustard labours under a heavy handicap in being called a Plain
Turkey. The fact that it is protected seldom has any effect if there is
a chance of putting it on the table. Being a ground bird, doubtless, a
good many are taken by foxes. Both the Stone-Curlew and the Bustard
are now comparatively rare in eastern and southern Australia, where
they were once so numerous. They both, fortunately, have a wide range,
and are common in some parts of the continent.
It is when we come to the Parrots that we find the most striking
evidence of the effects of opening up the country on our birds. Several
species have become so scarce that it looks as if we were going to lose
them altogether.
The habit of the Scarlet-shouldered Parrot in nesting in an anthill,
a position very exposed to enemies, has evidently been the cause of its
being driven away by settlement. Other members of the genus, notably
the Eed-backed Parrot (Psephotus hcematonotus), the Blue-bonnet
(P. hcematogaster), and the Many-coloured (P. varius) that nest in trees,
are numerous throughout the pastoral and agricultural districts of their
range.
The members of this genus are usually able to hold their own well
in mixed company. Some are even too aggressive to be kept safely with

other birds, while we read of a female Bed-backed Parrot turning out
a Starling from its home and taking possession itself (Avicultural
Magazine, Ser. IV, VI, No. 3, p. 72).
The Grass Parrots of the genus Neophema , on the other hand, are
extremely shy, quiet, and retiring in captivity, and I believe that,
owing to their sensitive disposition, they are quite unable to stand any
change in their environment. At any rate, this seems to be the case with
the Chestnut-shouldered and the Scarlet-chested Grass Parrots.
The Chestnut-shouldered Parrot, better known perhaps as the
Turquoise, was last reported by Dr. Boberts, from Stanthorpe.
Mr. G. A. Heumann states that he saw two specimens at Ooldea in
January last, while two were reported to have been secured and taken
to England by a representative of the Zoological Society of London.
The Smoker (Black-tailed) and the Green Leek (Barraband) Parrots
seem to have become scarce to what they once were. The former must
be affected a good deal by the clearing of its natural habitat, the Mallee,
and to a slight extent perhaps that, being found in a dry district, it is
easily caught by trappers. Barraband's Parrot is reported to have
suffered severely when rabbit poisoning was carried out extensively in
the Eiverina. Since this method of killing the rabbit in that district
has been discontinued it seems to be coming back. I saw a fair number
on the Murrumbidgee, near Carathool, recently.
The Ground Parrot and the Night Parrot must be affected by their
environment. Disturbance by stock and rabbits, as well as frequent
bush fires, have reduced, the latter at any rate, to vanishing point.
Summary
The future well-being of our birds depends to some extent on the
economic progress of the country. Settlement is going on at an ever-
increasing rate, and the consequent clearing of the land leads to a
corresponding change in bird life.
The Union has already suggested " That farmers be urged to
establish suitable breeding areas for insectivorous birds on all their
properties ". To this might be added a recommendation not to plant
exotic trees. Australian birds have specialized to live in Australian
trees. It can be noted that Starlings, Sparrows, Goldfinches, etc., collect

40 How Settlement and other Factors are affecting Native Birds
where pines, oaks, and elms, boxthorn and briars give them the shelter
that they are used to.
In view of the progressive clearing of the country, the value of
adequate reserves is apparent. Most States have plenty of these, but,
being mostly unpatrolled, they are not of material value.
The timber reserves, under control of the Forestry Departments
of the various States, are splendid natural ranges for our arboreal birds.
It is to be hoped that the Union will be able to get them officially
recognized as such, and the birds therein brought under the control
of the rangers.
We must recognize that farmers may find it necessary from time
to time to destroy some birds that are destructive to crops or stock.
In the Riverina, the Australian Crane has learnt to follow up the drills
and take sprouting corn, and many have been shot or poisoned in
consequence. Bare-eyed Cockatoos, Galahs, and Magpies suffer from
the same reason. King Parrots sometimes attack maize crops, while
some Parrots ( Platyceridce ) and Lorikeets, as well as Satin Bower-birds
and certain Honey-eaters, take fruit. This factor again helps to reduce
bird life in the settled districts, but, fortunately, it appears to be very
local, and to make comparatively little difference to the species
concerned.
The continued spread of the fox may be serious to two or three
species, but in the main the balance of life should adjust itself, as it has
in other parts of the world, where this animal has lived for ages con-
temporary with large bird faunas.
Exploiting birds for market purposes has now been stopped, and the
operations of sportsmen regarding game birds are fairly well under
the control of the State Authorities.
It only remains for the value and beauty of bird life to be recognized
by the people generally, especially the man on the land, to make them
safe for posterity.

All lovers of wild bird-life will regret to learn of the proposed sale
of the Fame Islands, off the west coast of Northumberland, which are
so well known as the breeding haunt of countless sea-birds ; and
feeling assured that members of the Avicultural Society will be
interested in the matter, we gladly give publicity to an appeal issued by
Sir George Noble for funds in support of a scheme for the purchase of
the islands to be handed over as a bird-sanctuary to the care of the
National Trust. The present owner, Lord Armstrong, and the
Rev. Charles Fenwick Thorp, have ever been friends to ornithology,
and since circumstances have compelled them to be anxious to get rid
of their holding, there is a danger, and an imminent one, of the islands
falling into the hands of some person or persons indifferent to bird-
life, who may grant holiday trippers free access to the islands throughout
the spring and summer months, and offer no obstacle to their
interference with the breeding birds, some twenty species, including the
Eider Duck, four different species of Terns, many other different
kinds of Sea-birds, and the Rock Pipit. Up to the present time the
interests of these birds have been guarded by a small association, which
has sent out watchers to the islands during the breeding season, and the
preservation of the bird-life has been due to the loyal devotion of these
few persons. During the past few years the difficulties of the watchers
have been considerably increased by the added facilities for reaching
the islands afforded by motor-boats ; and i t t is felt that unless the
islands can be secured for the Trust they will be lost for ever to the
ornithologist.
Those wTlo are interested in the project are requested to apply for
further information to Mr. Collingwood F. Thorp, of Belvedere,
Alnwick, the honorary secretary to the Watchers' Association mentioned
above, who will gladly receive subscriptions, however small, for the
purchase of the islands for the estimable object named.

to retain the generic name Alario for it. It bears a vague resemblance
to the Three-coloured Mannikin, especially on the upper surface ;
on the under surface only the centre and two lateral streaks on the
breast are black, and the centre of abdomen and vent are not black
but more or less stained with sienna brown ; the white of the under
surface is also less pure and stained with grey and brownish ; the beak,
of course, is considerably smaller and greyish horn-colour instead
of bluish-white. The Alario Finch has a soft, pleasing little flute-like
song, but it is very imitative, and I found that when associated with
domesticated Canaries or Linnets, it speedily substituted their songs
for its owm, which I regretted.

These birds undoubtedly are nearly related to the Siskins and
Serins. They are confiding if hand-reared, so long only as they are not
associated in an aviary with other small birds, whereas under similar
conditions Siskins which have been caught wild rapidly become tame.
They vary greatly in disposition, their nests are cup-shaped, softly lined,
and, as with all their allies, very variable in material; the eggs also
are of a similar character and colouring.
Common Linnet (Acanthis cannabina)
The sexes of this abundant and well-known bird are readily
distinguished at all seasons by a comparison of the white outer borders
to the primaries ; these are much wider in the male than the female ;
the outline of the wing also differs, 1 and in the breeding season the
wild male bird has the frontal region, throat, and breast crimson,
a colour wanting in the female and more or less completely disappearing
1 These differences are illustrated in British Birds with their Nests and Eggs ,

alter the first moult in captivity. This and the other European
Linnets are too familiar to need description : the nest of A. cannahina
is quite common in country hedges throughout the greater part of
Great Britain, and indeed of Europe, also in North-West Africa, the
Canaries, Madeira, and eastward to Turkestan. I have not found
it a quarrelsome bird, and it is easily bred.
Twite (Acanthis flavirostris)
Frequents the mountainous districts of Scotland, Ireland, England,
and Wales, also among the islands and along the coasts of Norway,
rarely in Sweden. On migration it seldom travels far south in Europe.
Apart from other characters the black-centred feathers of the upper
surface and sides, the rose-red rump of the male when in breeding
plumage and ochre-yellow beak readily distinguish the Twite from the
Common Linnet. In disposition, I found it greedy, selfish, and
quarrelsome. It has been bred in captivity.
Lesser Redpoll (Acanthis rufescens)
An inhabitant of Western Europe, commonest in Great Britain
in the north of England and Ireland, and in birch-plantations in
Scotland ; it does, however, breed in the southern counties of England,
and I found several of its neat softly lined nests in Kent. Apart from
its inferior size, the male in breeding plumage has the front of the
crown satiny-crimson and the rump suffused with rose-red, so that
it is at once distinguishable from the Common Linnet. In disposition
it is fidgety, inquisitive, and mischievous; consequently rather a nuisance
if associated with other Finches in an aviarv, as it frequently pulls
their nests to pieces.
Mealy Redpoll (Acanthis linaria)
This is merely a northern race of the preceding, occurring in North
Europe across Siberia to North America, but wintering more to the
south; it visits Shetland, the east coast of Scotland, and the north of
England during the winter; it occurs more rarely on the west side; in
the eastern counties it has been met with in the spring, and even in
the summer. In Ireland it has been taken in Kildare and Achill
Island, co. Mayo.

Charming birds in their wild plumage, but unfortunately, as with
our Linnets, the rose-red of the plumage disappears after the first moult
in captivity, being replaced by dull yellow : their nests and eggs are
very much of the Linnet type, the usual number of eggs being five,
sometimes four, and even six. In disposition they are confiding,
and provided that one could secure a pair, I should expect them to
be easy to breed. As suitable food I recommend millet, canary,
oats, and rice in the husk, green food, caterpillars, and blight.
Scarlet Rose-finch (Carpodacus erijthrinus)
Its prevailing colour is crimson in the male and brown in the
female. It is a well-known species, occurring in Northern Europe
and Siberia to Kamtschatka, occasionally in Western Europe ;
wintering chiefly in India and Burma. It nests chiefly in bushes or
creeping plants. Its song is weak and said to be intermediate between
those of our Goldfinch and Redpoll; the call-note is very like that of
a Canary. An example which a sister brought home for me from
India never sang, but often uttered its call-note; it died the winter
after I received it.
Sepoy Finch (Carpodacus sipahi)
The prevailing colour of the male is bright scarlet, and of the
female dark brown. It inhabits the Central and Eastern Himalayas,
occurring in forest or scrub, and is said to have a loud whistling note.
A rarely imported bird.
Purple Rose-finch (Carpodacus purpureus)
Vinous and rose-red are the prevalent colours of the male, various
shades of brown with v&amp;apos;hitish edges to many of the feathers, of the
female. It inhabits Eastern North America from the Atlantic coast
to the plains, breeding from the Middle States northward. It is said
to build in low trees ; its song is loud and varied. I had a single
example sent to me from Ontario in 1896, but it had been knocked
about on the journey and did not live long.
Blood-stained Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus)
Altogether a more sombrely-coloured bird than the three preceding
species ; the male mostly of various shades of brown, the margins of

face, cheeks, throat, lower back and rump crimson ; the female has no
crimson in the plumage. It is a bright songster, but is much disliked
by gardeners on account of the mischief which it does in destroying
seeds, young plants, buds and fruit; in its nesting habits it is said to
resemble the House Sparrow, building in all kinds of holes and crevices,
in roofs, barns, haystacks, or nests of other birds. I think most of the
imported examples of this species have found their way to our London
Zoological Gardens. Some are imported into France every year.

only is the character of the beak very aberrant, but the feet and claws,
being adapted to the climbing habits of these birds, are unusually
strong ; their methods of locomotion, both upon trees and on the
ground, are very Parrot-like, and they are equally destructive, tearing
woodwork to splinters; so that, if kept in a cage, the latter must
necessarily be constructed of metal. In some respects, of course, they
approach the Fringilline birds, the rose colouring of the male changing
to chrome yellow after the first moult in captivity, thus reminding
one of the Rose-finches and Pine Grosbeak, the nest also being some-
what like that of a Bullfinch in character, and the eggs resembling
one of the many varieties of the Common Linnet, but a trifle larger.
However, the true affinities of these and other Finch-like birds can only
be satisfactorily established by a study of their anatomy.
The Two-barred Crossbill (Loxia bifasciata)
Excepting for its banded wings and white-tipped coverts, this
species much resembles the Common Crossbill, which is familiar to
most bird students. It inhabits the coniferous forests of Northern
Russia and Siberia to the Pacific during the summer, but wandering
in autumn and winter over a great part of Europe, including Great
Britain. In a state of freedom it feeds chiefly upon seeds of conifers,

but in captivity is said to be fond of apple; as with L. curviroslra the
song is trivial, though said to be a trifle better than that of the Common
Crossbill.
The Common Crossbill (Loxia curviroslra)
I found this a most uninteresting cage-bird, its only note being
a constant " chip, chip, chip " ; it proved confiding enough it is true,
taking sunflower seeds from my fingers, but my pair did so much
damage to their cage that I was obliged to transfer them to a metal
one, from which they let themselves out by undoing the fastening of
the door, and when I wired up the latter, they then speedily died,
although their organs were perfectly healthy.

Unlike the smaller Bullfinches, the male of this large species does
not retain its rosy colouring after the first moult in captivity, the latter
changing to yellow as in the Rose-finches. It inhabits North Europe
and America.
When newly imported, this is a beautiful bird, the male being
largely rosy-vinaceous and the female coppery bronze, slightly olivaceous
on the back and more golden on the rump. It is very trustful, my birds
taking sunflower seeds from my fingers without hesitation; they were
about the tamest birds I ever owned, but unfortunately did not survive
the first winter in an outdoor aviary. The nest and eggs are of the
usual Bullfinch character, the former (in freedom) being usually built
upon a thick branch of spruce-fir or birch close to the trunk : it has
been bred in captivity by Mi*. St. Quintin. The food consists of seeds
of conifers, or in captivity sunflower seed, berries, buds, insects in all
stages, spiders, centipedes, and earthworms.
European Bullfinch (Pyrrhula emopcea)
This beautiful bird is too well known to need description. It
is much disliked by fruit-growers on account of the mischief which
it does in destroying fruit-buds : attempts have been made by well-
meaning persons to defend the bird by the assertion that it only
destroyed buds containing larvae, but observation proves that all
buds are taken without distinction, and when eaten none of them

contain grabs ; indeed, they could not do so, because the eggs which
hatch out into larvae are deposited later.
Red-headed Bullfinch (Pyrrhula erythrouphala)
Apparently a rather slimmer bird than the European species ;
it has a well-defined forked tail, the upper part of the head orange-
red instead of black in the male, but suffused with yellow in the female.
Specimens of this Himalayan bird were sent by Mr. David Ezra
to his brother in 1914, a pair finding their way into the collection of
Mr. H. D. Astley, who published an account of them, accompanied
by a coloured plate, in the Avicultural Magazine, 3rd Ser., Vol. VI,
pp. 169-71. Four examples also were presented to our Zoological
Gardens by Mr. Alfred Ezra in August, 1914. The song is said to be
more rapid and chattering than that of P. europcea, and the call-note
softer and more tinkling. To my mind the wild song of the European
bird is a poor performance vaguely reminding one of a jew's-harp ;
moreover, I never found that caught birds lived long even when they
nested with me, though hand-reared birds are known to attain to
a good age.
Grey-breasted Bullfinch (Pyrrhula griseiventris)
This rather sombre species occurs in Japan, the island of Askold,
Pekin, the valley of the Ussuri, and an island in the bay of Okhotsk :
it differs from the European species in the grey colour of its breast,
flanks, and abdomen, sometimes with a rosy tinge ; the female differs
from our bird in the chocolate in place of dove-brown colouring of
the upper parts, breast, and front of abdomen. Three examples
were exhibited in the London Zoological Gardens in 1903.
The following, though it is called a Bullfinch, is probably more
nearly related to the Rock-Sparrows.
Desert Finch (Erythrospiza githaginea)
The upper parts, cheeks, throat, and flanks are mostly ashy-brown,
with narrow rosy edges to the feathers ; primary coverts with minute
white tips; rump, upper tail-coverts, and most of under surface
rose-coloured; beak coral red, feet orange, iris brown. The winter
plumage is more sandy in tint and the beak paler. This is a rock-
r equenting little bird, which nests in a crevice in rock or wall, or

under a grass-tuft or small plant on a hill-side ; the nest is a neat
structure of fine bents, lined with hair or wool; the eggs, four to six
in number, are elongate ovals, pale blue or sea-green, lightly spotted
with dark purple, or spotted and streaked at the larger end with dark
lake and reddish-brown (according to Whitaker); the song is insigni-
ficant, often chattering, or chirping, mingled with sounds reminding
one of a toy trumpet; the call-note is said to be metallic.
This little bird ranges from the south of the Mediterranean eastwards
through Persia and Baluchistan into Western India. It feeds chiefly
on seeds of grasses and weeds, in its wild state, but also insects in all
stages. In 1897 Mr. Meade-Waldo reared four nests, three of six
apd one of four, from a single pair ; the young were fed entirely upon
seed of canary, spray-millet, and shepherd's purse disgorged from
the crop.
Rock-Sparrows
These little birds come very near to the true Sparrows in their
general sombre colouring, often untidy nests, characteristically coloured
eggs and usually chirping notes. They are rather aggressive and not
especially attractive birds, and consequently do not appeal greatly
either to dealers or aviculturists. It has been asserted that the widely
distributed European species (Petronia petronia) is a noteworthy
songster, but Whitaker says that its note is a harsh and monotonous
chirp. It hardly seems worth while to describe these birds in detail;
they are included in vol. i of my Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary ,
pp. 98-100. They feed upon seeds, birds, and insects. An illustration
of the egg of P. albigularis laid in one of my cages was published in
the Avicultural Magazine, 3rd Ser., Vol. V, Fig. 1.

of the breeding season is sufficient to stir up strife in some birds, as
I found was the case each year with my cock Scarlet Tanagers.
Yellow Sparrow ( Passer luteus)
A North-east African bird, having the head, neck, rump, and
under surface bright yellow ; rest of body above chestnut; lesser wing-
coverts dull yellow; rest of wing brownish-black, tips of the median
and greater coverts and edges of primaries huffish; secondaries with
broad chestnut borders ; tail brown with paler borders ; beak horn-
coloured; feet pale brown ; hides brown. Female with the yellow
and chestnut parts replaced above by pale brown ; under surface buff,
suffused with brown on sides of head, neck, and body. It was bred
by Mrs. Howard Williams in 1904.
Golden Sparrow (Passer euchlorus)
Bright yellow with paler wing-coverts, flight and tail-feathers dark
brown with pale borders; beak and feet pale brown, irides brown.
Female pale brown, the mantle with a few dark markings, sides of
head buff, browner on ear-coverts; under surface buff, more yellow
on throat. This is a gregarious species which nests in thorny trees
near water, constructing a thick nest of thorny twigs : it inhabits
Arabia and Eastern Abyssinia. The Golden Sparrow r has been in
possession of the London Zoological Gardens and various private
bird-owners : it is illustrated in Shelley's Birds of Africa &amp;gt; vol. iii,

Although evidently nearly related to the preceding, one cannot call
it a Yellow Sparrow : it is perhaps a little abnormal in the fact that
male and female are very similar : it is too well knowm to need descrip-
tion. I found it of little interest as an aviary bird ; perhaps a trifle
better than a House Sparrow.
Grey-headed Sparrow (Passer diffusus)
Above rufous-brown, lower back and rump, lesser and median
coverts chestnut, inner median coverts tipped with white ; greater
coverts brown with reddish outer edges ; flights dark brown with
reddish edges ; upper tail-coverts and tail-feathers brown with paler
edges ; head, neck, and under surface dark grey, paler on throat and
abdomen ; under tail-coverts dull brown with whitish edges : beak black,
feet reddish-brown ; irides chocolate. Female paler, abdomen and
under tail-coverts whiter. This bird is generally distributed over
Africa : in its habits and the character of its very variable eggs it closely
approaches our House Sparrow, but is said to have even a harsher note.
It is imported from time to time in small numbers, and I purchased a
female in 1895, but I cannot recommend any of the typical Sparrows
as aviary birds.

buff. An abundant South African bird, extending eastward to the
Transvaal, and westwards to Benguela. This Sparrow is said to do
much good by destroying immense numbers of caterpillars in the
' breeding season ; later, like our House Sparrow, he is destructive to
grain and fruit: the nest is built in holes and crevices, is an untidy
collection of sticks, straws, feathers, etc., but when in a tree or bush
it is flask-shaped with long entrance-tube, after the fashion of the
larger Weaver-birds, and often, like them, uniting in vast communities.
Mr. Seth-Smith bred this species in 1901, and published an illustrated
account of his experience in the Avicultural Magazine, 1st Ser.,
Vol. VII, pp. 165-7 : the eggs, like those of the House Sparrow,
vary a good deal, though they are said to be usually pale greenish
blue, thickly blotched and mottled with various shades of brown and

There can be no doubt, judging both by their habits and the character
of their eggs, that Hudson was correct in calling these birds Sparrows :
their colouring is perhaps more attractive, and their song, though
scarcely musical, is certainly an improvement on that of any species
of Passer known to me.
Common Saffron-einch (Sycalis flaveola)
This hardy bird is too generally known to need description; it
inhabits South Brazil to New Grenada and Venezuela : it is figured in
my Foreign Finches in Captivity , and fully described (pp. 20-6).
It is a tempestuous bird, rather rough and sometimes spiteful in its
wooing, but easy to breed both in cage and aviary : canary-seed, with
various millets and green food, suit this and allied species perfectly,
and when breeding soft food should be given.
Pelzeln's Saffron-finch (Sycalis pelzelni)
A similar, but rather smaller bird, with under parts yellow, streaked
with blackish on the flanks. It inhabits Brazil, Paraguay, and the
Argentine Bepublic, and hybridizes freely with the commoner species,
the young being fertile : in my birdroom they soon reverted to the
flaveola type, from which S. pelzelni probably originated. Their treat-
ment in captivity is of course identical.

A distinctly smaller bird, but varying somewhat both in size and
colouring, it has consequently been broken up into sub-species, the
value of which I consider very doubtful excepting perhaps in the case
of S . luteiventris, which has white on the outer tail-coverts. The
typical form is pale olive-green, with the mantle and upper back
broadly streaked with blackish brown ; lesser wing-coverts greenish-
yellow ; remaining wing-feathers dark brown with pale borders ; tail
feathers similar ; a bright yellow eyebrow stripe ; throat and upper
breast dull ashy huffish ; lower breast and abdomen bright yellow ;
beak and feet horn colour; irides brown. The female browner;
the upper parts less yellow and the yellow of the under surface paler. 1
It inhabits Brazil, the Argentine Republic, Bolivia, and Chili to S. Peru.
Not only is S. arvensis considerably smaller than S. flaveola, but
it is more graceful in form and in its flight, which is butterfly-like,
after the manner of the Grey Singing-finch ; it is very abundant and
gregarious, frequenting the fields after harvest in immense flocks :
its song is superior to that of its larger relatives, and is said to be uttered
when it leaves the summit of a bush upon which it has been sitting. It
nests on or near the ground, building a deep and well-formed structure
and laying five elongated white or bluish-white eggs thickly spotted
with brown. One of my birds built a nest in a receptacle formed
from a cigar-box, but it did not lay, the hen being apparently in feeble
health, as it died shortly afterwards. Although the song of this bird
is not bad, though scroopy, its ordinary notes are somewhat more
typical of the true Sparrows.
I have arranged the typical Finches, so far as seems to me possible,
in natural sequence. There is, however, a considerable gap between
the Chaffinches and Goldfinches, and the Crossbills, both in structure
and habits, appear to be a little out of place.
1 Some examples of the female more closely resemble the male ; indeed,
a female which I possessed was brighter and larger than one of my males.

The past year has been one of the worst I ever remember for
breeding results, and these notes are mainly a record of failures
and tragedies of one sort and another. The fine warm days during
the early part of May tempted many birds to start nesting, which
was rudely interrupted by the bitter weather which lasted until the
end of the month, with only very occasional warm days, until the end
of June. When the hot weather of July eventually came, it was then
too late for many birds to start again. My pair of Bheas, as usual,
hatched off a fine brood of young ones, and these did all right for the
first six weeks, but eventually died off, one by one, in spite of every
precaution. For the past three years I have not been able to success-
fully bring to maturity any young Bheas, and I am rather at a loss
to know the reason ; certainly the parent birds are getting rather old,
but the young ones when first hatched always look as strong and
healthy as anyone could wish to see. I have tried moving them on
to fresh ground, although the paddock where they live is a very large
enclosure, but they invariably sicken when about two months old,
and appear to lose all strength and inclination for food, and gradually
weaken till they die.
A pair of Crested Jays, which were in an aviary by themselves,
made a nest of small sticks on the lid of a hamper fixed up amongst

some Scotch fir boughs at the back of their shelter ; this was about
the middle of May. The nest w&amp;apos;as quite complete and ready for eggs,
when the hen was picked up dead one morning after a bitterly cold
night; this.was.a great disappointment. I had another pair of this
species in the Waders' aviary. These made no attempt to breed;
all they did was to eat a large number of Californian Quails' eggs as
fast as they were laid. This fine Jay is not so shy as many of the
genus are ; they love to sit out on a conspicuous bough or post,
constantly dipping their tails up and down, and as they utter their
low but very clear and not unmusical note they bend their head and
body downwards toward the ground. As soon as they see me coming
with the mealworms they fly to the wire-netting of their enclosure,
but if a stranger comes near they at once dive into the bushes planted
in the aviary, and then will not reappear again for some time. All Jays
want large or good-sized aviaries to show off their grace and beauty
properly, then no birds are more attractive ; but they cannot be kept
with birds smaller than themselves.
One of a fine pair of Occipital Blue Pies was seen carrying bits of
stick about in July, but nothing came of it. These Pies are very
carnivorous, and they generally have a mouse apiece every day.
Occasionally they bury these and then forget about them, or, perhaps,
will disinter them several days later. In one adjoining aviary, amongst
a mixed lot of Finches, are some Budgerigars. These began to dwindle
in an odd way, and it was not until some of their feathers were found
in the Pies' aviary that we realized that the latter caugh t the Budgerigars
when clinging to the wire partition wdiich divides the two cages and,
dragging them through the mesh, devoured them wholesale. They
are very pugnacious, and I should be sorry to put any bird, except
something very large, in with them. I find Toucans will seize and eat
small birds, too, if kept in an adjoining aviary, dragging them through
the wire-netting. Close at hand a pair of Jay Thrushes have dis-
appointed me as regards breeding for several years. I got them in 1920,
and no birds have done better. The male bird constantly feeds the hen,
and the latter I have seen carrying bits of hay in her beak. They are
most attractive, and have a curious habit of opening and shutting
their beaks very rapidly with quite a loud snapping noise when excited ;

when mealworms are thrown to them they invariably catch them in the
air as they fall; they are always searching in the ground for worms and
insects, and make quite large holes in the soil; they share a good-sized
aviary with a very old Rufous Tinnamon, a Ypecaha Rail, and a
beautiful little South American Black Rail, one of a pair given me by
Monsieur Delacour several years ago. This bird is almost identical with
the Black Rail of East Africa (Limnocorax niger), which is very common
on Lake Naivasha and in swamps in British East Africa.
Another great disappointment caused by the weather was the for-
saking of their nest by a pair of Military Starlings. The nest was a more
or less domed affair, built on the ground, amongst and completely
hidden by the long grass growing in the flight of their aviary, which is
rather a small one. The nest had no shelter beyond the grass, and a
heavy deluge of rain on the night of 24th May completely swamped it;
the pair of old birds are now in winter quarters with some Orange-
headed Marsh Birds, and if they get through the winter, I shall put the
Starlings into the same aviary again in the late spring, and hope for
better results. But my greatest tragedy of last year has yet to be related.
I was in Mr. Chapman's establishment in the Tottenham Court Road
one day last August, and he had just received a consignment of South
American birds, wdiich included some Trumpeters in quite good order.
I at once secured a pair, and more delightful birds I have never
possessed. Considering their long journey, they were in wonderfully
healthy condition, and after a few days cleaned themselves and
improved greatly. From the very first they were absolutely fearless
and absurdly tame, following me about everywhere. They had com
plete liberty in the garden, and roosted at night on the topmost branch
of an apple-tree, though if the weather looked at all threatening we
always took them in ; they did not appear to mind a little rain, but
if it came on too heavily, of their own accord they would shelter under
some thick laurel bushes. When called, or if they saw me, or anyone
else for that matter, they would race across the lawn at a most
tremendous pace, with wings fully spread out and head lowered ; they
would every now and then sway or bend completely sideways, or indulge
in a regular dance before reaching me, when they would at once walk
sedately along as close as they could to me.. Visitors having tea out of

doors would suddenly feel the piece of cake they were holding gently
but firmly snatched from their fingers by the Trumpeters, who would
invariably come round to the Loggia at 5 o'clock. They would spend
hours, standing on one leg, gazing at and pecking at their own
reflections in the glass of the long French windows which open on
to the verandah. For seven short weeks these beautiful birds gave
endless pleasure to us and our visitors, and then in one fatal twenty-
four hours they both succumbed to poison, caused by picking up
laburnum seeds underneath a tree in the garden. In giving birds com-
plete or semi-complete liberty, one does run the risk of such a disaster, I
suppose, but Trumpeters kept in aviaries, or even large enclosures, would
lose more than half their charm, and my birds were the picture of health
till this sad ending. Birds seem to have little sense of avoiding eating
what is harmful for them, and if I ever get any more Trumpeters, I shall
certainly cut down all the laburnum-trees in the garden before I let
them loose. Bather a curious accident befel one of a pair of Orange-
headed Caiques ; they were kept by themselves in a small aviary
facing west. They would always sit out in the full sun, which one day
in August was exceedingly fierce. While I was actually watching them,
one of them appeared to have a sort of fit and fell off the perch in the
top of the aviary to the ground, perhaps 10 feet. He fell very heavily,
and was absolutely stunned for some minutes. However, he recovered,
but for quite two months afterwards his legs and feet were completely
paralysed, and he was incapable of using them at all; in fact, he is not
really right yet. I suppose the heat of the sun had given him some sort
of stroke. The large Hawks become very apathetic to their natural
food after some years in captivity. A full-grown live rat was put into
the Jackal Buzzard's aviary one day. The Hawk paid not the slightest
attention to it, although he had had no food for twenty-four hours, and
must have been very hungry. I am a great believer in occasionally
starving the larger Raptores. I am certain they are all the better for it,
or, at any rate, to vary considerably the times of feeding and
also the amount which is given ; it prevents them becoming lethargic
and dull. On another occasion last summer, a brood of half-grown
wild Moorhens for some strange reason elected to force their way, one
after another, through the rather large mesh of the wire-netting over

tlie Kara Kara's aviary. Once in they could not find their way out
again, and here they spent the day, quite unmolested by the
Kara Kara, who appeared to be rather frightened of them than other-
wise. In adjoining aviaries are a very fine pair of Long-tailed Glossy
Starlings, and a pair of Common Glossy Starlings (Lamprocolius
chalybeus). The former, which came from tropical West Africa, appear
to be perfectly hardy, and sit outside in all weathers, although they
have a heated shelter to go into if they wish. The latter, which came
from the hinterland of Abyssinia and East Africa, appear to be
extremely delicate, and acutely feel the slightest cold. In the aviary
with the Long-tails, amongst a mixed collection of oddments, are a
pair of Californian Quails, which have taken complete possession of an
empty nesting log, fixed high up in the roof, and have driven away the
Kosellas who have always used it, and if the former occupiers even
go near it now the cock Quail gets very excited, and goes for them, till
the Rosellas beat an ignominious retreat. To finish the list of tragedies
here during the past summer, I find it impossible to have birds and dogs
loose together; something always eventually happens, however well
trained the dog may be. A terrier killed a hen Ruddy Sheldrake and
a beautiful male Baikal Teal, also a tame Silver Pheasant, while a
rat which mysteriously got into the Waders' aviary did awful havoc,
and in one night killed three Ruffs, a Black-tailed Godwit, and no less
than five Red-headed Cardinals ! Truly aviculture is made up of
disasters and disappointments.

By Casey A. Wood
Three years ago, when I first visited Dominica, I found and
examined a skin of Amazona imperialis in the Museum at Roseau, and
made inquiries as to the possibility of seeing a live specimen of that rare
and noble bird, the largest of its genus. So far as I could discover, no
caged or wild " ciceroo ", &amp;quot; ciceru ", or " cicerou "--for so the natives
indifferently call him--had been seen for over ten years. Hence I
came away in sorrow, fearing that the lovely bird had gone the way
of another Dominican Parrot-- Ara guadaloupensis --and of so many
other West Indian forms.

Casey A. Wood--My Quest of the Imperial Parrot
Kuhl was the first, over a century ago, to describe this beautiful
bird. He named it Psittacus havanensis. Ten years later Vigors
described ( Proc. Zool. Soc., p. 80, 1836), as Psittacus augustus,
the first specimen brought alive to the London Zoo. He noted the
distinguishing colour of the Parrot, and especially the brilliant glossy
purple sheen of the head, nape, and breast. Thirty years afterwards
P. L. Slater, under the caption " Remarks on a Rare Parrot ", drew
attention (Proc. Zool. Soc., p. 437, 1865) to a gift by Mr. P. N. Bernard
of a living specimen of the same species, under the name Chrysotis
augusta, from Dominica. The donor stated that this Parrot was very
rare in Dominica, being seldom seen, and that only one or two were
caught during the year ; its abode was in the very centre and most
mountainous part of the island. He was well acquainted with all the
West Indian Islands, and had been several times in Dominica;
but it was only the previous year that he had seen one of these Parrots
for the first time. The Governor was the sole inhabitant who had one
domesticated ; and although Mr. Bernard offered a large price to the
native sportsmen, it was twelve months ere they succeeded in taking
the young one then in the Zoo.
A. G. Verrill, in his " Fauna of the Island of Dominica " (Trans.
Conn. Acad. Arts and Sc., viii, 1892, p. 327), gives a very good account
of this bird, at that time bearing the specific title Amazona augusta
(Vig.). He remarks that it was not so rare 1 at that period as the
other (remaining) Dominican Parrot, A. bouqueti, found in the same
locality and of the same habits, but smaller, not arrayed in as gorgeous
dress, and by no means so finished an orator. The most fruitful source
of both these Parrots was the windward side and the interior of the
island, where they are found at considerable elevations. The larger
1 An indication of the comparative rarity of the two birds is given by the
collections in the Natural History Branch of the British Museum. In 1922
I found there six skins, in good condition, of A. bouqueti and only two of
imperialis. Two more of the latter were in the cases, one without a head and
the other in poor condition. Another indication of the rarity of caged Imperial
Parrots, in the United States at least, forms part of a letter recently received
from Dr. Theodore Palmer, of Washington, who has governmental supervision of
all birds imported into that country. He informs me that, with the exception of
those noted in this paper, no Imperial Parrot has been entered on his records for
the past two decades.

of the birds inhabits the thickest and most impenetrable -forests, where
the mountain palms and gommier-trees grow, the seeds and fruit of
which/ together with the young shoots of the former, make a large part
of its diet. Both birds, adds Mr. Verrill, are much hunted for food
during the time the Game Law is off, being then occasionally for sale
in the market at Roseau. Consequently, though common in the
particular localities in which they live, they are exceedingly shy and
difficult to procure. Even when within gunshot it is hard to distinguish
their green and purple plumage among the dense foliage of the high
trees. They are generally found in small flocks or in pairs, and are not
infrequently seen flying overhead, but at a distance. The author
quotes Mr. Ober as observing that their call-notes are chiefly heard,
and only for a short time, in the early morning and towards evening,
or when disturbed by gunfire. Their calls are a shrill whistle, a sharp
scream, and a crescendo of yells. In captivity they make fairly good
talkers. According to the natives the nest is generally built in a hole
at the top of a dead palm, but it is very rarely found. One old Carib,
who had spent his life in the woods, said he had never found but one.
Verrill and two other collectors assiduously hunted the island and took
many birds, but they were unable to shoot more than two Imperial
Parrots, although they saw several others flying overhead.

THE BEAUTY OF PHEASANTS

In the January Magazine Mr. Beever, in his interesting article
upon keeping Pheasants, regards the Golden and the Amherst as
the most beautiful. There are certainly some species which cannot
possibly claim that distinction, the Ho-ki or Brown Eared-pheasant,
for instance, which although very fine and large, is bulky in build,
and gives one the impression of an irate old gentleman v/ho finds his
own particular dinner-table at his club occupied by a stranger. The
Ho-ki's crimson face and bristling white moustaches greatly encourage
the resemblance. But when it comes to beauty, can a^^thing outvie
the Tragopans, and can any wonder in nature be more marvellous ?

The Golden Pheasant is undoubtedly most gorgeous, most brilliant,
and yet has he not piled on the colours almost too lavishly ? the effect
is somewhat bizarre, a little unrestful, much as I delight in colour.
But the Tragopans--the Satyr, for instance--with the deliciously
restrained but yet glowing beauty of the rich Venetian red, and the
wonder of the graduated spots of white which spangle it, the rather
large dark brown eye, the small aristocratic beak, and the quiet
demeanour of the walk, assemble points of beauty which are hard to
beat. And the display ! that finely delicate wattle rolled up and
concealed beneath the chin, seeing the light of day for only at most
three weeks in the year, suddenly shaken down as some conjurer
might shake a roll of gorgeous Oriental silk from a hand which a moment
before seemed empty ; that wattle spread over the fore-neck, the
colours as vivid, as brilliant as in the most gorgeous enamels; only
skin of the most delicate texture, and yet glowing with turquoise blue
and soft rich rose, whilst on either side of the velvety-black head there
spring (another conjuring trick) two fleshy horns of emerald-turquoise.
No ! if it were held that the Golden Pheasant is the most gorgeous
I should agree, but not the most beautiful. Beautiful, yes. It is
difficult to bestow the superlative upon one species where there are
many which merit it. Beauty is not necessarily extreme brilliancy
of a mixture of colours, just as a day of flaring sunshine in summer
is not really more beautiful than one of half-mist in October, when
the autumnal tints of the trees only give you an indistinct glimmer
of their beauty. Neither, if you come to think of it, is the Golden
Pheasant more gorgeous than the Monaul, although we give the palm
to the former for a far more graceful contour; but the metallic lustre
of the Monaul's neck and back is marvellous, so that I have seen, at
a distance of at least a hundred yards, what appeared to be a large
sapphire glinting and sparkling in the sunshine, which was a patch,
a small patch, of burnished feathers on the side of the bird's neck.
And emeralds glitter on his coronet. And the " eyes " on the tails of
the Peacock Pheasants (Polyplectron), of metallic greens and violets,
are quite sufficient to thrill one with joy at such beauty. If the
" common " Pheasant was seen for the first time as a newly dis-
covered species, would one not exclaim at such rich but more restrained

loveliness, supposing one had always seen Golden Pheasants as the
birds of the coverts, lying in rows after a big shoot, or hanging in

More I dare not venture on, yet this love of beauty in birds,
although not practical aviculture, seems to me as lawfully included in
the study of them in freedom and captivity.

The Dulwich and Peckham Cage Bird Society is to be congratulated
on the success of their effort to re-establish the cage-bird exhibitions
at the Crystal Palace. Their show, held from 8th to 11th February,
was a great success,&amp;apos; and brought back pleasant memories of many
such exhibitions held in the past. So far as foreign birds were con-
cerned one has seen larger shows, but there were many very interesting
birds present and several that the present writer at least has not
previously seen on the show bench.
Starting at the beginning, one was first struck by the Lories.
Mrs. Dalton-Burgess took a first prize with a beautiful White-rumped
Lory (Eos fuscata), a species one only sees in captivity after a special
collecting expedition has been to New Guinea. The same exhibitor
took the second prize with a very good pair of Scaly-breasted Lorikeets
(Psittev. teles chlorolepidotus), a species not often seen nowadays, and
third with a Purple-capped Lory.
The most interesting birds in the next class (Lovebirds, Brotogerys,
etc.) were two pairs of Abyssinian Lovebirds (Agapornis taranta), the
first prize winners, shown by Mr. Frostick, being an especially fine
pair. This is a very fine species, which has become suddenly common
since Mr. Chapman's recent consignment of Abyssinian animals arrived.
Those I have seen have all been full-Avinged, and so there should be
a medal claimed by some one this year for breeding the species.
In the class for the Short-tailed Parrots the Marquess of
Tavistock took the first prize with a fine Guilding's Amazon, the Parrot
of St. Vincent, which must be almost, if not quite, extinct in the wild
state. Possibly this specimen is the last of its race. Mrs. Dalton-
Burgess sent a very good Red-topped Amazon (C. rhodocorytha ) and
Mrs. Field a fine Yellow-nape (C. auripalliata ).

Foreign Birds at the Crystal Palace
Mrs. Dalton-Burgess again won first prize in the class for White
Cockatoos with a very nice Citron Crest, a species inhabiting the island
of Sumba, and which is very seldom imported.
The next class was for " All other species of Cockatoos, Macaws,
Eclectus, Mueller's, Everett's, and all other species of Short-tailed
Parrots ", and here a Lear's Macaw (Am lean) exhibited by Mr. C. T.
Maxwell took the first prize, the second going to Lord Tavistock for
a Great-billed Parrot (Tanygnathus megalorhynchus), and the third to
a Spix Macaw (A. spixi) exhibited by Mrs. Dalton-Burgess.
In the class for Conures and the commoner Parrakeets Mr. L. W.
Hawkins sent a nice Sun Conure (C. solstitialis), Mr. Frostick a Golden
Headed ( C . aureus), and a specimen of some species of Pyrrhum, but
I am not certain which it was.
There were thirteen exhibits in the class for Kings, Crimson-wings,
and Broad-tails, the most interesting perhaps being Messrs. Illingworth's
Port Lincolns, Mrs. Dalton-Burgess's Yellow-naped, and Mr. Frostick's
Barnard's. It is not often one sees these three species of Barnardius
shown side by side.
The " All other Species " class contained only four entries, but all
of great interest. First was Mrs Dalton-Burgess's Queen Alexandra
(Spathopterus alexandrce) . According to the catalogue there should
have been a pair, but I saw only one, and that looking none too well.
The second prize winner was by far the rarest of the four, a specimen
of the small King Parrot which inhabits Sula Island (Aprosmictus
sulaensis), exhibited by Lord Tavistock. It is probably the only specimen
ever imported, although the species from Amboina, of which one
specimen was once imported, is almost identical. The third prize
was also awarded to Lord Tavistock for a very good Many-coloured,
and the fourth to Mr. Hawkins for a Hooded Parrakeet (Psephotus
dissimilis).
The class for Hybrids and colour varieties contained some wonderful
specimens. Lord Tavistock sent a very perfect Lutino Ring-necked
Parrakeet, a most lovely bird, for which he was awarded first prize,
and he secured also fourth prize for a Lutino or Semi-lutino Plum-head,
in which the pink colouring of the head, combined with the yellow
of the body, formed a beautiful combination. Mrs. Dalton-Burgess

secured second prize with a pair of what she calls Royal Blue
Budgerigars. They are of a rich violet-blue colour and form another
very curious and interesting variation of this popular species. This
subject of colour variation in the Budgerigar is not yet fully under-
stood. We know that the yellow variety lacks the black pigment
and the blue birds show the absence of the yellow pigment, but why
should the blue be of different shades ? and what is the meaning of these
violet birds that Mrs. Dalton-Burgess has brought to light ? In the
Indian Ringneck we have seen the yellow variety in which the black
pigment has been eliminated. I hear now of a sky-blue Ringneck !
But to return to the show.
Mrs. Dalton-Burgess exhibited the only foreign Hybrid in the show--
a cross between a Redrump and a Blue-bonnet. It is a remarkably
handsome bird clearly showing its mixed parentage.
The class for Quails and -Doves produced only three entries.
Captain G. E. Rattigan secured first with a nice pair of Painted Quails
and second with a pair of Plumed Ground-doves. The latter are
considerably the rarer of the two species, and the more difficult to
show.
Amongst the commoner Waxbills, Mannikins, and Grassfinches
there was nothing of outstanding interest, although the classes were
well supported. There were a number of Gouldians, mostly in fine
condition, and Mr. Frostick's first-prize Violet-eared Waxbills were
a beautiful pair. In the " All other species " class were two pairs of
Red-crested Finches (Coryphospingus cristalus ), two Lazuli or Blue-
headed Buntings ( Cyanospiza amcena), a Rock Bunting (Fringillaria
tahapisi), two Red-collared Whydahs (Coliuspasser ardens), a Queen
Whydah, a pair of Textor Weavers (Textor alector), a pair of
the somewhat rare Pink-winged Rose-finches (Rhodospiza obsoleta ),
and a beautiful Rainbow Bunting (Cyanospiza leclancheri) . The last,
shown by Mr. Frostick, obtained a first prize.
In the class for Tanagers, Sunbirds, Sugar-birds, and Green Bulbuls

and fourth to Mr. Frostick's Superb Tanager ( Calliste fastuosa ).
Other interesting birds were a nice Blue Sugar-bird (Dacnis cayana)
and an equally good Scarlet Tanager.
The class for "All other species of Fruit-eating and Insectivorous
birds not larger than a Blue-cheeked Barbet " was one of the most
interesting in the show, though on account of the misleading wording
of the schedule some good birds shown here were wrong-classed.
Mr. C. T. Maxwell took the first prize and a special for an Abyssinian
Barbet (Tachyphonus margaritatus), while his equally rare Red-fronted
Barbet obtained a third prize. Mrs. Dalton-Burgess secured second
prize with a beautiful Rufous-bellied Niltava (Niltava sundara ).
Mrs. Dalton-Burgess sent a beautiful pair of the rare Superb Spreo
(Spreo superha), a species recently imported for the first time from
Abyssinia, and a pair of the almost equally rare Amethyst Starlings
(Pholidauges verreauxi), but both of these entries were disqualified
as they should have been in the next class, which was for " All species
of Crows, Pies, Jays, Troupials, Mynahs, Starlings, and Babblers
In this a single Superb Spreo exhibited by Mr. Frostick secured first
and special prizes, the second going to an Orange-headed Troupial
(Agelceus longipes) exhibited by Mr. F. C. Levett, and the third to a
pair of rare Beechy's Jays ( Cissolopha heecheyi) belonging to Mrs. Dalton-
Burgess.
The last class, which was for " All other species ", contained only
an Australian Noisy Pitta (Pitta strepitans), an extremely rare bird,
though the Zoo had two thirty years ago ; and a Green Toucanet
(.Aulacorhamphus sulcafus), both belonging to Mrs. Dalton-Burgess.

Of the incessant traffic and commerce of the birds maintained
unnoticed around us and over our heads, here is an instance--one of
a dozen strange ones that might be recorded every day. A single
spark of observation reminds us how we live--as the Greek comedian
knew--in the presence of these tireless, watchful, clever people.
Sandbeck Park in Yorkshire, and its attendant woods, are inhabited
out of nesting season by endless multitudes of Books. As evening
approaches, the sky is streaked with millions of these daily-breaders
re-seeking their garden city.
I believe these very Rooks build at Nostell Priory. But this
Park of Sandbeck is their quarter of flats --a residential neighbourhood,
nurseries apart.
You see, of course, the same thing wherever there are broad woods.
The Rooks are trooping back, to a roost which is not quite home--for

there is no nest---in just the same way to-night at Wilton, in great
masses, separate multitude after multitude, now towards the end of
January flying in pairs. Near Sandbeck there are busy coal mines,
their pit-mouths harmonizing wonderfully to my mind with the old
England of the woods. It is Ivanhoe's country,.and close to Robin
Hood's ; and it is strange to pass through a budding copse plumb into
the presence of modern machinery. The Rooks pass over all: over wood
and road, over park and pit. One of their roosting places outside the
Park is High Wood, above Roche Abbey. In High Wood, Pheasants
are reared ; and the keepers report that the Pheasants have great
comfort and benefit from the fact that the ground is always covered
by a quantity of small stones, grit, broken brick, and other digestive
condiments of bird diet. The Pheasants quickly pick up the precious
sharp stuff, but there is always a fresh supply. Mingled with the
grits are numbers of those indiarubber rings that come off the stoppers
of gingerbeer bottles. Now, all these useful and amusing objects
are dropped by the Rooks as they pass. Business takes them day by
day to the yards round the pitheads, and, nearing home at night, they
drop their bits of brick, and the rings, they perhaps took for w&amp;apos;orms,
to the benefit of their brilliant country neighbours, the Pheasants. The
notion that after so long a time the Rooks are still deceived by the rings
seems to me a little thin. Birds are ever so much cleverer than people
suppose wdio have no individual birds amongst their intimates. I
incline to suppose that the Rooks pick up the gingerbeer bottle-stopper
rings for fun, in the hope, always disappointed, that the Pheasants
will think they are worms. Anyhow, it's jolly that this little traffic
is going on, and has been going on for years unnoticed, till the Head
Keeper decided to find out how his Pheasant ground was kept supplied
with sharps.

of Tanagers, " Calliste 55 included, eat a fair quantity of seed, and
I have but little doubt that a close study of these birds in a wild state
would reveal the fact that wild seeds form an important part of their
natural menu. However this may be, I am certainly of the opinion
that seed should always be supplied in captivity to Tanagers that will
eat it. My Superb and Copper-headed Tanagers eat both millet and
.canary, but are especially keen on teazel seed and certain varieties
of wild seeds, of which they consume considerable quantities with
apparently very beneficial results, for my birds are always in perfect
condition and never experience the least difficulty in coming through
the moult. This fact is not really so very surprising when we consider
how nearly allied the Tanagers are to the Finch-like seed-eating birds.
Mr. Sich's opening statement under the heading " Notes " is that
" he has found Dufresne's Waxbill as hardy as any other species, and
more inclined to nest ". But how he arrives at this conclusion I am
at a loss to understand. In his very next sentence he informs us that
" only having two pairs, the first soon died Why ? He continues :
" I replaced them." Presumably this means that he bought two fresh
pairs, and as die makes no further mention of the second pair of fresh
arrivals, it would appear fair to conclude that he lost these as well.
In any case, however, he soon lost his third (or fourth !) hen. That
is to say, of this species which he terms hardy he has lost, on his own
admission, either five out of six or seven out of eight within the space
of a year or perhaps less ! It would appear, therefore, that the evidence
he brings forward in support of his theory as to the hardiness of this
species is of a somewhat negative value. The only fact he adduces,
so far as one can see, in support of this claim is the fact that the hen
went to nest when rather bare of feathers. This, however, proves
nothing at all, for almost any Waxbill might act in a similar manner,
providing the bird was in an otherwise healthy condition. Mr. Sich's
opinion as to their being more inclined to nest than any other species
is merely an opinion based apparently upon the behaviour of one
particular hen, and has no relation at all to actual facts. As I recently
pointed out when challenging a similar statement made by another
contributor, I can find no published record of the successful breeding

of this species either in this country or on the Continent, and proof
to the contrary, though invited, is still not forthcoming. On the
other hand, numbers of other Waxbills breed freely in our aviaries
every season. I myself, for example, breed fair quantities of Cordon
Bleus, Avadavats, and Gold-breasted Waxbills every season (these
being the only common species of Waxbill I have kept recently).
Furthermore, I cannot see that Mr. Sich is in a position to judge the
hardiness or otherwise of any species, when one considers the fact
that, as he writes, " My aviaries are only fit for summer use," and he
keeps the birds indoors, in cages apparently, from October till the end
of May. On these lines there is little difficulty in keeping any species,
even the most delicate. For example, I keep my Tanagers, " Calliste,"
Sun- and Sugar-birds, Violet-eared Waxbills, etc., in just this manner,
and they all do well. None of the foregoing receive either artificial
heat or light during the winter, but they are all regularly covered over
at night, and I am satisfied that their lives would be neither long nor
happy if they were not. Mr. Sich finds it impossible to believe that
a Waxbill can stand sixteen hours' fasting, nevertheless it is a simple
matter to prove that it can easily do so, and a consideration of the
following facts should modify such disbelief. No aviculturist of any
experience will, I think, venture to dispute the fact that it is possible
to keep a seed-eating bird for a longer period without food than an
insectivorous bird of the same size, but to anyone expressing a doubt
as to the correctness of this hypothesis, I would merely say, let him
experiment with the two classes of birds himself. Let him compare,
for instance, the powers of endurance of, say, the Common Wren with
the tiniest and most delicate Waxbill he can procure, a Dufresne's,
for example. The Wren would barely survive a couple of hours, but
the Waxbill would probably survive the day. Anyway, let him try
for himself, but I would ask him not to carry the experiment too far
out of consideration for the unfortunate Wren. Now let us compare
the lot of a caged Waxbill with that of some small insectivorous species,
such, for instance, as a Long-tailed Tit or a Gold-crest. The Waxbill,
with easily procurable food ever before it, is not forced to waste valuable
time in the search for it. It can and does make a hearty meal just
before dusk, and after eating as much as it can hold, it proceeds to

cram its crop to its utmost holding capacity, thus forming a reserve
supply for the night. A Gold-crest, on the contrary, has to hunt
feverishly throughout the short winter's day for what must of necessity
be a bare and precarious livelihood. Far from being able to gorge itself
to repletion just before dark, it must frequently happen that it goes
hungry to roost, and even then cannot count with any certainty, or
even probability, on getting a meal till long after the day has dawned
on the following morning. Yet, in spite of this, the species continues
to survive in sufficient numbers to be extremely common in many
localities. How, then, can it be seriously contended that a seed-eater
such as a Waxbill, going to roost with a full stomach and a full crop,
cannot endure a fast of even sixteen hours, whilst an equally tiny
soft bill can easily endure one of still greater length on a com-
paratively empty stomach ? No, Mr. Sich must look for some other
cause to account for the death of his birds. No bird has ever died
through being covered up cosily at night, but there is no doubt that
scores have done so owing to lack of such covering to keep off the
draughts and chill, especially of the early hours of the morning. All
small wild birds seek a cosy shelter during the night, even in summer,
and few caged birds, indeed, would of their own choice select as a
roosting-place the bare perches of an open cage.
G. E. Sattigan.
[May it not be that the habitat of a bird counts for something
in the matter of ability to survive long periods without food ? For
untold generations Nature has been forcing the Gold-crest to evolve
a power to survive the long winter nights, but no such pressure has been
put upon Waxbills by their environment. That a Waxbill can go
sixteen hours without food cannot be doubted, but that it is able to
do so without injury when not in the finest possible condition is open
to doubt. Have we any proof, either, that a wild Gold-crest often
goes to roost with a nearly empty stomach and survives ? Insect
food may be less scarce in winter than appears to the human eye.
The Editor had a Dufresne's Waxbill which laid an astonishing
number of eggs, but on the whole he has found the species
delicate.-- Ed.]

In reply to Mrs. Currey's query as to the habits of rooks
out of the breeding season, especially why they only pay occasional
visits to their rookeries, it may be taken as a general rule that all
the rooks of a district (and it may be a very large one) resort to one
main rookery for roosting purposes, and only roost in their general
breeding places during the breeding season. The roosting-place need
not necessarily be a very large rookery, but is probably a very old
one, and contains numbers of suitable roosting trees. The number
of rooks resorting to these great centres is often astonishing. The
birds come in from great distances in calm, clear weather, often at an
immense elevation, many arriving after nightfall; indeed, these great
roosts are never quiet. With a gale blowing, the greater number of
birds will come in against the wind, very slowly fighting their way,
and taking advantage of every shelter, such as avenues of trees,
inequalities of the ground, etc. On arriving at last, they will mostly
settle on the ground and form a black carpet of some acres in extent.

THE GROSBEAKS

<bodyText confidence="0.9898012" page_id="56200471"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
Dr. Sharpe divides the family of Fringillidse into three sub-families :
Coccothraustes, Fringilla, and Emberiza. It is of the first group
that we are about to speak. Professor Ridgway 1 justly criticizes
this classification, and does not hesitate to say that these groups, and
especially the first one, are artificial. It is certain, for instance, that
the Spermophilae, Blue Grosbeaks, or the Cardinals have only a very
distant relationship to the Chinese and Japanese Grosbeaks (Eujphona)
and to other so-called Grosbeaks. It is evident that this fact did not
escape Sharpe's notice, because he wrote " one must accept these
divisions rather because they are convenient for us than that they
are based on well-established structural differences". The birds
that Sharpe includes in the sub-family of Coccothraustes are found in
all parts of the world except Australasia. Their size varies from
that of a Thrush to that of a small Waxbill. They are almost all
stout in build, with roundish and rather large heads, a very large
beak, sometimes greater in depth than width, sometimes rounded ;
strong legs, and the feet armed with fairly long nails. Their wings
are more or less short,and the distribution of the feathers (remiges)
differ according to the species. The tail is rounded in some, whilst
in others it is cut at a right angle, and is. generally fairly short. The
colouring of the females is not the same as that of the males, which
latter is in some cases very brilliant. Some species have the head
adorned with a crest.
In their ways also these birds differ considerably one from the
other. They are frequenters of trees and bushes, and feed on seeds,
buds, and also fruits, berries, etc. They rear their young partly on
insects, which latter they are glad themselves to devour when the
opportunity occurs. Their nests are never built at any great height
from the ground, and are nearly all cup-shaped. Some groups,
however, Phonipara for instance, cover in their nests, after the manner

of the Weavers. A large number of species have shown themselves
capable of bearing captivity in Europe, and are more or less adaptable
to our climate. Certain hardy species can be kept in an outdoor
aviary throughout the year, provided there are shelters from winds
and rain. Other species are more delicate, and require protection
from winter storms and frosts in a dry and well-lighted shelter, not
necessarily heated.
A great variety is necessary in their food; millet, canary, hemp
(which latter should be given discreetly), wheat, and at times oats,
are what they prefer. The larger species are fond of sunflower seed.
Many of them should have various fruits and berries, besides
insectile mixture and bread and milk. Live insects are greatly
welcomed by the majority. Some of these birds, such as the Blue
Grosbeaks (Guiraca), the Cardinals, certain of the Spermophilw ,
etc., are appreciated for their songs. We will select those that are
most worthy of being kept in cages as songsters.
Many species of the genus Coccothraustes that have been imported
into Europe have already bred in captivity. The rearing of the
young does not offer as a rule much difficulty if the birds have plenty
of space in a large aviary well planted with bushes and undergrowth.
They construct their own nests, and almost all decline to make use
of any artificial nesting-places which may be put at their disposal.
The birds of this group are fairly sociable with other birds of their
own size and strength. Amongst smaller companions the larger
species behave in various ways. As a rule it is perhaps advisable
not to put species with them which are much weaker, for accidents
may come about, especially at nesting-time. On the other hand,
I might here cite a case of sociability of which I was a witness. In
an aviary somewhat exposed to the cold, I had a male Bed Virginian
Cardinal, several native birds, and two Grey Waxbills; during the
hard weather, when it was freezing, the Waxbills snuggled at night
close to the Bed Cardinal, who accepted these bed-fellows with a good
grace !

The European Grosbeak, or Hawfinch ( Coccothraustes coccothrausles).
--Chestnut head, neck ashy-grey ; throat black ; lower back, rump
and upper tail-coverts, cinnamon brown; wings black, glossed with
steel-blue at the ends of the inner primaries and outer secondaries,
all of which have what are styled quadrate " ends ; a large white
spot on the primaries ; under parts and sides, ashy-grey washed with
vinaceous brown. Feet, greyish-brown; beak, bluish in summer,
fleshy-white in winter with a black tip. The female is paler and
smaller. This bird has no particular attraction. It is hardy, and
will live a long time in an aviary, where, however, it is seldom seen.
The species has not yet been bred in captivity. Sub-species have
been discovered in Japan (C. c. japonicus), North Africa ((7. c. buvryi ),
and in India ( C. c. humei). I believe that they have not been imported.
The Black-tailed Grosbeak ( Eophona melanura) is of a stronger
build than the preceding species, but resembles it in many respects.
The black on the head is less in area ; points of the wings, black ;
the upper part of the body is ashy-grey, the lower parts are paler ;
the beak is pale yellow. The female is brown underneath, and the
black parts of the plumage are less brilliant. She is smaller than
her mate. This species very rarely arrives in Europe, where it has
been known as an aviary bird for some time. Some males were
imported in 1914. It seems to be hardy, but has not yet been bred
in captivity. Habitat: the mountainous parts of Japan.
The Black and Yellow Grosbeak ( Mycerobas melanoxanthus). --
General colour above, slaty black ; the feathers black in the centre
with slaty-grey margins; throat, breast, upper tail-coverts black ;
wdngs and tail black, edged with pale yellow&amp;apos;; under parts bright
yellow. Female, smaller; black above with yellow&amp;apos; spots; yellow
beneath; the centre of the belly is black. I have never seen this
bird alive. A few examples have at long intervals been seen in the
collections of Zoological Gardens, notably in that of the Zoological
Society of London. Miss Hawke had a young one, hatched in her
aviary, successfully reared by a pair of Hedge Accentors in 1914.
Habitat: throughout the Himalayas to Manipur and Western China.
The Bose-breasted Grosbeak ( Zamelodia ludoviciana).- --Head,
neck, shoulders and back, black; rump pure white; tail-coverts

white, spotted with black ; wings black with white markings ; under
wing-coverts rose-coloured ; sometimes it is also rose at the bend of
the wing; throat black ; throat and chest with a large patch of
beautiful rose-colour, extending in a line down the centre of the breast;
the rest of the under parts white. In the winter plumage, all the
black is mottled with brown and the rose-colour on the breast is much
paler and in part disappears. The female is quite different: general
colour above, ochreous brown streaked with black centres ; rump
and upper tail-coverts uniform ashy-brown ; crown of head blackish-
brown on the sides, with a whitish streak ; a broad white streak above
the ear-coverts ; under surface of body, whitish-buff ; chest, with
broad triangular spots of blackish-brown; flanks, streaked with
blackish-brown. The young males resemble the female, but it is
easy to distinguish their sex by the fact of the under wing-coverts
being rose-coloured, where the females' are pale yellow. This lovely
bird is a delicious songster, which makes itself heard everywhere ;
especially in the spring-time ; indeed, in my opinion, it is the finest
singer of all the Grosbeaks. Formerly it was imported fairly frequently,
but one does not often see it in the European bird-markets since its
exportation was forbidden by the Government of the United States.
The few that do arrive come from Mexico and Central America, where
they are winter migrants. The Rose-breasted Grosbeak breeds readily
in an aviary, where it has the reputation of living peaceably with weaker
companions ; but personally I have had occasion at times to complain
of it. Habitat: Canada and Eastern United States to plains of
Missouri River; Texas; throughout Central America to Colombia
and Ecuador; Cozumel; Cuba; Jamaica.
The Black-headed Grosbeak (Z. melanocephala). --Slightly larger
than the preceding species, the male has the head, the part under the
beak, and the tail, black; the back and wings black with white
markings; neck and all the under parts, orange-buff ; the centre
of the belly is yellow ; under tail-coverts white. The female resembles
that of the Kose-breasted Grosbeak, but the colouring is paler and the
under part of the neck is isabelline-brown. This Grosbeak is neither
as interesting nor as handsome in an aviary as the Rose-breasted ;
it has, however, a rather agreeable song, but it is not sustained. I have

bred in captivity by Mr. Teschemaker in 1912. Habitat: High

magnificent cadmium yellow ; beak, grey-blue ; feet, and legs, grey.
Female : olive green, with grey on the back ; stripes of blackish-
brown on the rump and back; wings and tail, grey marked with white;
sides of the head and under body, pale yellow. These birds are rarely
imported, especially the females, which is disappointing, as this species
would probably nest quite readily in an aviary, where it shows a quiet
disposition, although I am referring to unmated males. It is hardy.
Habitat: South and west of Mexico.
The Venezuelan Yellow Grosbeak (P. chrysogaster ).--Resembles
the preceding species, but the yellow is lemon-coloured; the back,
shoulders, and tail-coverts are black, the latter spotted with white.
In the female those parts of the plumage are olivaceous, which in the
male are yellow, except the face and breast, which are pale
yellow, the upper parts being grey and brown. In spite of these
birds being highly esteemed by the Venezuelans, one seldom sees
them in Europe, especially the females. Mr. Brook bred this species
in his aviaries in Scotland in 1917.
The Yellow-bellied Grosbeak (P. aureiventris). --The greater part
of the body is black, sometimes spotted on the back ; breast black ;
belly brilliant yellow; under tail-coverts white ; the bend of the
wing is yellow, and wings and tail are marked with white; the top
of the thigh is black; beak lead-grey. The female and the young
males are brown underneath, with certain traces of yellow in
the plumage, the head and neck being nearly black; cheeks,
greyish-brown; a yellow line encircles the cheek; the chin and
the lower surface of the body are yellow with traces of black,
especially on the breast. This handsome bird is imported more
frequently than the preceding species, and is very quiet and decorative in
an aviary. It readily eats Indian corn, prepared as for Parrots. The
species has not yet been bred in captivity. It does not seem

to feel the cold, and can live throughout the year out of doors.
Habitat: South Brazil, Bolivia, and Upper Paraguay.
Central and North America possess two species of Grosbeaks,
having a strong likeness to our's as regards general characteristics,
but differing in the beaks being straighter and either greyish-blue or
yellow. They form the following genus :--
The Evening Grosbeak ( Hesperiphona vespertina). --Forehead and
eyebrows, yellow ; head, black ; upper body, brown ; lower back
and rump, dull golden yellow ; the brown of the under parts is washed
with yellow ; wings and tail black. In size this bird is slightly larger
than the European Grosbeak (Hawfinch). It has been very rarely
imported. Habitat: Western North America east to Lake Superior.
Abeille's Grosbeak ( H . abeillei)r --Head and neck black ; upper
tail-covert black spotted with yellow ; the rest of the upper surface
of the body, olive brown ; sides of the neck and lower surface, yellow ;
thighs black ; beak yellow; size that of the Common Hawfinch.
The female is duller ; the parts which in the male are yellow being
olive yellow in his mate. This species was imported for the first time
by Eockelmann in 1914. It seems to be hardy. Habitat: Central
America and Guatemala.
Under the name of Blue Grosbeaks we place these three following
birds, which belong to two different but closely connected genera.
They are excellent aviary birds and extremely decorative.

MY QUEST OF THE IMPERIAL PARROT

By Casey A. Wood
(Continued from p. 59)
Dr. C. W. Richmond (Auk, vol. xvi, 1899, p. 186) discovered that
Psittacus augustus of Vigors is preoccupied by P. augustus, Shaw,
M.us. Lever., lix, 1792, pi. 2, necessitating a new name for the former.
He accordingly suggested its present appropriate title, a name that
had for several years stood in Dr. Richmond's MSS.
A. H. Clark (Auk, xxii, 1905, p. 342), in his instructive paper on
the Parrots of the West Indies, tabulates the colour differences between
the extinct Guadeloupe Parrot and Amazona imjperialis (Richm.),
which it closely resembles. However, he erroneously stars A. bouqueti
among the extinct Dominican species.
Coming to more recent times, William Beebe gives an interesting
account ( Zool. Soc. Bull., May, 1912, p. 868) of the addition of a live
Imperial Parrot to the New York Zoological Society's Gardens in Bronx
Park. Pive years later the same naturalist acquired another living
specimen. Of the latter acquisition he says (Zool. Soc. Bull., Jan.,
1918): " We were able to secure a second specimen, a male in full
plumage, and bring it safely to the Zoological Park. To this the
way was paved by correspondence with the Hon. A. M. Mahaffy,
Administrator of Dominica . . . through whose kindness I was able
to arrange for a pair of birds [male and female] to be ready when
I passed on my way north. In this interval the female escaped, so
that I was able to obtain only a single bird. It was exceedingly tame,

at once adapted itself to life on shipboard, and is now in good health
and on exhibition in the Park." ".
On my own return to Dominica in 1922 I again searched for a
" cicerou ", and interviewed a great many owners of Parrots, especially
in the houses of natives, who are very fond of caged birds. My plan
was a simple one ; when I looked up an owner of a Parrot and found
he had not the bird I was seeking, he was always able to pass me on
to another friend or neighbour who possibly had one or knew somebody
else who had. In this quest I was most effectively helped by my
friend, Mr. A. W. Green, the owner of Canefield, one of the largest
estates on the island. Indeed, he drove me about in his motor, and,
as he was well known by all the people of the island, I ascribe my
ultimate success entirely to his assistance.
For several hours we followed false scents, two of them to end in
discovering a bouqueti and one fine Cartagena " Green ", but generally
we found the family pets to be Blue-fronted Amazons. The chief
reason of this misinformation was undoubtedly due to the fact that
very few Dominicans had ever seen an imperialis. When we were
about to give up this avian ignis fatuus we heard of a family that had
recently acquired a new and large Parrot from the mountains.
Mr. Green knew the people, and soon we drew up in front of the
house--in front a shop, behind a patio ; upstairs, living apartments.
I went in and told the evident mistress of the establishment that I had
been told she had an island Parrot, and if agreeable to her I would like
to see him. But she evidently was not interested in my quest. "We
have one, but it is not for sale." I explained that I only wanted to see,
not to buy, her bird. After some further hesitation and words with
some other inmates of the house, she disappeared into the patio and
returned with a rather large cage and--bah--only a bouqueti. He
was a good specimen of that smaller island Parrot, and, under other
circumstances, I should have been much interested in him. My
evident disappointment seemed to impress her, and she said, "You
wait, I have another." Suiting action to the word, she passed out
of the rear door, followed by her household, leaving me " center front ".
By this time the neighbours had arrived (by the stage door) and I
heard the mingled sounds of many voices consulting in the patio.

Very shortly to these noises were added " lower animal '' conversation--
the loud cackling and complaints of outraged hens, the barking of a dog,
and the insistent cries of an errant rooster. This animal uproar
increased rather than diminished until I could stand it no longer,
and, lifting the bar to the shop counter, pushed open the door to the
yard and saw one of the strangest sights it has been my privilege to
look upon.
The enclosure was about 25 feet square, and served not only the
usual purposes of a tropical patio but also that of a chicken ranch on
a small scale. Two sides of the court were occupied by large hen
coops, in and out of which ran (it seemed to me) several dozen chickens
in all stages of growth, loudly cackling in all keys. Interspersed with
these were the outraged mother hens and the protesting chanticleer
I had heard during the waiting period of my visit. The dog was not
now taking part in the concert; he had been violently ejected in the
early stage of the performance. The space unoccupied by gallinaceous
animals was filled by the Madam, her household, and the neighbours,
each one gesticulating and giving advice, orders, and directions in tones
that could be heard a block away. The attention of the human
contingent seemed to be directed towards a large converted packing-
case, occupying one corner of the yard, in front of which stood a half-
grown maiden armed with a mutilated broom and another woman
bearing a banana in one hand and a lath in the other. Ranged behind
these in serried ranks were others bobbing about and adding diligently
to the general confusion. Several pieces of fruit, seeds, etc., decorated
the top of the coop. Evidently there was some animal, well out of
sight, behind that coop, and he was being alternately coaxed and coerced
into leaving his refuge and coming out into the open air. A sort of
frenzy seized me ; I was overcome by the futility, the cruelty, the
absurdity of it all. I yelled--no use employing the conversational
voice in that Hades of rumpus and noise--to the Madame : " Tell
these people to get out, to stay out, and to keep quiet." Not a polite
act on the part of a stranger having no status whatever in the household,
but it was effective. Away ran the banana girl, the broomstick woman,
and the gesticulating neighbours until there remained only the mistress
and her son. As soon as the cock and the hens and the chickens and

the rest of the " people " had quieted down, I walked over to the
packing case and whispered to the bird I could not see. (If you wish
to gain merit in the eyes and ears of a strange Parrot put your hands
behind your back, keep them there, and whisper to him.) Ecce
miraculum ! In a few minutes there slowly came into view the most
lovely head and neck it is possible to imagine--glossy plum-coloured,
the eyes yellowish but bright and intelligent, the nuchal feathers
slightly ruffled. This apparition was succeeded by a brilliant green
body as large as a Leadbeater Cockatoo; and a magnificent
Amazona imperialis climbed on to the top of the improvised hen-
coop. He shook himself and gazed calmly about for a few moments,
like Horatio on the bridge. I took advantage of this interlude to
admire his carriage, to note his beautiful plumage, and to observe the
markings on his tail feathers and retrices. He looked as if he wore
an iridescent, puce-coloured hood, pierced for his brilliant yellow eyes ;
but it might be more correct to say that his head, neck, and under
parts were of a dark purplish blue that varied in shade as he moved ;
upper parts, parrot green ; primaries, deep brown ; speculum, crimson ;
orbital ring and cere, blue-grey. I shall not soon forget that wonderful
colour scheme. But he, disdainfully ignoring my presence, climbed
down the front bars of the packing case, waddled across the patio,
up the slats of another coop, and settled himself in a corner of the wall,
which I afterwards found to be his favourite roosting place. During
this excursion Mr. Chanticleer chose the opportunity to cross his line
of march. The Parrot made one dab at him, extracted a few feathers,
and then passed unconcernedly and majestically on--and I think that
rooster was the most astonished animal, human or avian, in the whole
courtyard.
While the great Parrot preened his feathers I noticed that he had
been " winged", and then it transpired that the son of the house had
some time before been hunting near the summit of one of the high
mountains in the interior and shot the Parrot, fortunately only dis-
abling him. The boy told me he intended to use him as a decoy and
try to get some more in a trap.
Several months after I told this story to a well-known aviarist
in England who makes a speciality of rare Parrots, but had never

James B. Housden--Birds on a Western Banch, New Mexico 81
possessed an Amazona imperialis. At his urgent request I wrote
Mr. Green to inquire upon what terms the Ciceroo could be acquired.
The answer was that no money would buy him, and that in any event
the Madame did not like " white folks " and would probably not give
up her pet to any of the detested race.
I am glad to close this paper with a report from Dominica of
17th December, 1923. My friend, Mr. Green, wrote me on that date
as follows : " I have been offered a " cicerou " Parrot which, as I am
soon coming north, I thought I might bring up to you ; but when
I saw the bird I knew that I ought not to buy it for you, as it was far
too old and shaky, and its wounded wing was unpleasant to look at."
So we may conclude that for the past hundred years the Imperial
Parrot has held its own, never becoming numerous, but living in
limited numbers on the romantic and charming island that alone
has sheltered it, at any rate, during historic times. It has survived
mainly because it has been constantly protected from man by the
remoteness and inaccessibility of its native haunts--the densely
wooded slopes and lofty peaks of its home in wild Dominica.
On the rarity of these Parrots.
Mr. Lee S. Crandall, Curator of Birds, New York Zoological Park,
very kindly wrote me on 12 th December, 1923 : "I am sorry to say
that we have no specimen of Amazona imjperialis at present. We
have had three specimens altogether, received as follows : one on
19th February, 1912, and one 29th October, 1917, both through
Mr. Beebe. We secured another direct from Dominica on 15th October,
1920. For some reason we do not have much success with them, and
none has lived very long. I have had no recent news of the species ;
the last I had was that, while the bird was undoubtedly becoming rare,
it still exists in the interior of the island.
I have heard of none offered for sale since the last one we secured,
and do not believe there is one in captivity in this country."

of the Rio Grande River ; the great event of the day seemed to be the
arrival of the Californian express. The train runs down the middle
of the street, and all the inhabitants, including a large number of
cowboys, seemed to turn out to see the train.
Next morning at sunrise, after a good night's rest at the only hotel
at the depot, so different to the jolting of the Pullman car, we started.
My nephew had come 80 miles in an automobile to meet me. We
struck the plains for the ranch. For the first 20 miles the track was
quite straight; the sun became intensely hot, still a very interesting
journey : Marmots, several kinds of beautiful Hawks, flocks of Meadow-
larks with their bright yellow breasts, and many new birds.
We went several miles out of our way to visit the " City of Rocks
We could see it miles away, and when we reached the rocks it was
a very remarkable sight: hundreds of immense blocks of stone, the
size of a church and smaller, all shapes and sizes. Eagles, Turkey
Buzzards, and other birds of prey we saw sailing about. I found
a nest of the Mexican Dove with two young ones hidden behind a large
stone.
We passed some swampy ground, and here found some beautifully
marked Rails. We rode through large cattle ranches, and at one of
these we saw a real " Wild West show ", a round-up of half-wild
cattle. It was most interesting. A large number of cowboys riding
beautiful horses were driving into the central station some hundreds
of dark brown and white long-horned cattle of all ages. To the writer
it was a most interesting sight, and we were the only spectators. While
watching, and amidst all the noise, I was interested in seeing for the
first time a pair of the strange birds, the Road Runners (Geococeyx
californianus), a bird the size of a small Turkey, hunting for lizards and
small snakes ; these seemed quite tame and came close to our car.
We passed through canyons and across immense prairies until
we came to the Great Divide, where U.S.A. is parted east and west: we
had been on the East (Atlantic), now we were on the West (Pacific)
side of the continent. We still continued to ascend : it was a most
extraordinary ride up a mountain-side in the Rockies. We went
around curves, along narrow paths, with immense precipices on the
one side and walls of rock on the other, till one felt quite nervous;

over some very rough roads, till we reached an altitude ranging between
eight and nine thousand feet. On this side I saw the beautiful Staller's
Jay and other new birds. We finally reached the ranch about midday.
The ranch has twenty square miles enclosed with a wire fence,
and the forest extends hundreds of miles outside this fence. In these
vast forests lovely flowers and strange trees are found (juniper, cherry,
pinyon, cotton-wood, immense pines, real patriarchs of the forest,
and many cactus-trees) ; in a number of dead pine-trees many bright
and beautiful Woodpeckers had made their homes. Very little rain
had fallen for nearly two years. Although no grass was to be seen,
all the trees and scrub everywhere looked very green : all the water
came from the many natural springs. Besides some cattle, large herds
(bunches) of Angora goats fed on the scrub. Some parts of it were
quite open for many miles, at others it was dense undergrowth and
forest. Certainly, the writer found these forests had a fascination
of their own.
The beautiful Nuttall's Woodpecker, with its mottled-red head,
Bed-bellied, American Three-toed, Bed-headed, and the Ivory-billed
Woodpeckers are found here. I found several trees with many holes
drilled in the thick, corky bark, these holes each containing an acorn.
I brought some photos of these trees home, with their sides covered
with holes.
On the ranch I met H., the head cowboy, one of the most courteous
men I met in U.S.A. Although he told me he had been a cow-puncher
all his life, he was quite a naturalist. He helped me in many ways
in the study of bird life the month I stayed on the ranch.
He showed me how by climbing a mountain-peak we could look
over a precipice and see the nest of a pair of White-headed Eagles on
the top of a large pine-tree in the valley below. At another time he
climbed a large tree, with the help of a hatchet enlarged the hole of
a rare Woodpecker, brought the young ones down for me to examine,
and then climbed the tree and put them back again; and also found
a number of rare nests in the cactus-trees.
It was strange to find a great number of birds building for protection
in the cactus-trees, which looked like coral with hundreds of sharp
spines. It was a most difficult task to examine these nests. The

first nest I found near the ranch house, with young in a cactus-tree,
was the Long-billed Butcher-bird (the same as I had found in Texas).
The beautiful little Lazuli Bunting (Cyanospiza amoena) is fairly plentiful
all through Mexico to the Gulf, also in California ; the local name here
is the Blue Linnet. In Colorado and Arizona it is known as the
Lazuli Painted Finch. The male is very conspicuous because of its
brightly coloured plumage and its lively song, uttered from the upper
branches of a bush or tree. The female does not possess the bright
colours of her mate : her plumage is brownish above and whitish
beneath.
A Western writer says of this beautiful little Bunting:--" If it
is a question of beauty of colouring no other bird may hope to surpass,
to human eyes, this little bit of heaven's blue, with his soft, tawny
breast and clear white underparts." Some months ago a number
of these birds were advertised " as the first importation " ; male
birds in very fine plumage were on sale at Chapman's, Tottenham
Court Hoad, and Gamage's, Holborn. I hope other new birds may be
imported. I found many new birds on the ranch and through Mexico
which I have never yet seen in our bird markets.
I was introduced to a gentleman in Silver City (the nearest mining
town to the ranch, a return journey about 50 miles through the
mountains), and this gentleman had a collection of several hundreds
of Mexican bird skins. He had collected all these in the Burro (Mule)
Mountains, lying between the city and the ranch ; it certainly was
the best private collection I saw on my journey ; many beautiful birds
quite new to the writer.

CURIOUS BEHAVIOUR OF GREY PLOVER

Sir, --During the recent cold spell my Grey Plover acted in the
most extraordinary manner. It has been in a large aviary for eighteen
months, and during that time has been extremely wild, rarely suffering
me to approach it within twenty-five yards without taking flight.
One day last week, during a bitterly cold north-easter, whilst I was
feeding the other birds, I noticed it running towards me ; when it

was within about fifteen yards it crouched upon the ground, with
its wings spread out and shaking violently, with its tail erected over
its back, like a Peacock's in display. On my approaching it to see
what was the matter, it ran off very swiftly, keeping its body close to
the ground, much in the same way I have seen a Partridge do when
disturbed at its nest, and uttering at the same time a low whistle.
On every occasion that I entered the aviary for nearly a week this
performance was repeated. When the bird squatted between two
clumps of grass a very curious effect was produced, as its tail was the
only part of the bird visible, and this loomed up like a white fan.
The weather was intensely cold at the time, so one would think that
this display can hardly have been a sexual one. I have kept Grey
Plovers for years now, and have never seen anything like this before.

Parrot, which is not only a wonderfully swift, easy flight, but is unique,
as far as my own experience goes, in the fact that it is absolutely
noiseless. I know of no other bird that can rise from the perch, fly
round the aviary at full speed, and alight again, without making
the slightest sound. It would be interesting to know if the above fact
has been recorded by any naturalist, and if there are any other birds
endowed with such a perfect stroke.

[The flight of the King Parrakeet is very noiseless considering
the bird's size and weight. Specimens in the Editor's aviaries make
a just perceptible sound with their wings, but no more. The flight
of the King Parrakeet at complete liberty is sweeping and graceful,
but the Crimson-wing shows much greater buoyancy, and Barraband's
Parrakeet and the Rock Peplar far greater speed. --Ed.]

COLOUR OF FALKLAND ISLAND GEESE (CHIEFLY WHEN
YOUNG) ; ALSO THEIR FOOD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99733194117647" page_id="56200488"  page_num="86" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Some of the birds watched by me when observing foreign species
in past years were Geese, and therefore a letter reprinted in the Field
of 15th October, 1921 (already mentioned in the Avicultural
Magazine, 1922, p. 45, lines 6-7, when writing of Carrion Hawks),
interested me because there was also reference to some Geese.
As these were in the Falkland Islands, they seemed to me to be of the
genus Chloephaga, of which two species occur there and on the neigh-
bouring mainland of South America in which the sexes when adult
differ in colour of plumage, they being the Upland ( C . magellanica) and
Kelp ( C . antarctica). Are there any others ? At the present moment I
have no copy of the Field by me, but, according to an extract written
in notebook at the time, the writer stated : " Old males are snow-white,
and females and young (italics mine) dark-coloured with undulating
lines on under parts." This seemed to imply that young males could
not be diagnosed from young females by their coloration when a few
months old; and the question therefore arose in my mind at the time
of reading it, " What species does the writer refer to ? "
As adult males of the Upland have white on head, neck, and breast,
with some black cross-bars, females reddish-brown with some darker
cross-bars, the brief description in the Field might be intended for them.
But as the writer's remarks did not seem to me to apply to young
males, it occurred to me it would be as well to keep the subject in mind
and refer to it later when opportunity arose, having no notes on the young
at the time of reading. During the summer of 1923, when looking round
the London Gardens, I found two Uplands, said to have been hatched
on 9th June, and when seen by me on 25 th July they looked different,
one having a whitish hue on head, neck, etc. This bird seemed un-
doubtedly a male and therefore contradicted what was implied in the
quotation above given, and this whitish hue was easily seen on 8th
August at 20 yards distant--that was at the age of two calendar months.
That being so, the quotation does not agree with Upland young males.
Does it agree with the Kelp, both when adult and ivhen young ?
Several years ago, somewhere about 1903, there were two Geese
labelled Kelp in the London Gardens, of which the male had white on it

with darker cross-bars, and the female was brown (see also Royal
Natural History , vol. iv, p. 333), according to an entry in my notebook--*
from which it seems possible the quotation in the Field may have been
intended for this species. But what are young Kelp Geese like ? Do
the sexes differ in colour in early months, as pointed out in the case of
the Upland % If so, it would seem that the writer in the Field never got
hold of a young male of either species, but only females--that is, if they
were of the Chloephaga genus. Or did he mistake a Buddy-headed
Goose (C. ruhidiceps) for a " supposed young male " Upland ? Perhaps
the Editor or some other member will enlighten me as to what these
Geese referred to in the quotation probably were.
Another statement was that the food was " exclusively (italics mine)
brown algae found on stones and rocks of the shore That may have
been so in a few shot and dissected. But as all the Chloephaga species seen,
in addition to the three above, the Black-banded Goose (C. inornata) of
Argentina, and the Andean ( C. melanoptera), see Avicultural Magazine,
1921, p. 47, have eaten grass plentifully, there is every reason to suppose
the Geese mentioned in the quotation also did so as a species, whatever
that species may have been. Certainly the large Upland Goose eats
clover and corn in Patagonia.
Frederick D. Welch.
[The Goose referred to is the Kelp ( Chloephaga hyhrida vel
antarctica). In this species the adult male is pure white, while the
female is a blackish bird with white markings. Owing to the lack
of immature skins at South Kensington and the failure of the collectors
to record the sex of any of the young birds obtained, it is difficult
to be positive about the colouring of immature males. It would
appear, however, that young ganders have a considerable amount
of brown in their first plumage, though they are never quite so dark
as the females. If this is really so, the immature plumage of the young
male Kelp Goose recalls that of the better known C. magellanica
and C. inornata , the Black-banded. In these two, as pointed out
by Dr. Welch, the males are easily distinguishable from their sisters
directly the down is shed, but at the same time they are not nearly
so white as adult birds. It is probable that the food of the Kelp Goose
is somewhat different to that of its relatives.-- Ed.]

WAXBXLLS, ETC.
Sir, --In writing my slight criticism of M. Decoux's article I had
no idea of entering upon an extended controversy with this gentleman.
It is, however, obviously impossible for me to allow a passage from
my letter to be not only inaccurately misquoted, but the whole meaning
of it completely altered in order apparently to try and explain away,
or justify, a statement I consider myself perfectly justified in
challenging. The passage I refer to concerns some remarks upon
Dufresne's Waxbill, and commences : " Thereupon Capt. Rattigan
asserts that this species has never been bred in captivity . . . neither
in this country (England), nor even on the Continent." The following
is a verbatim extract from my letter, and I will leave it to unprejudiced
critics to judge whether I did in fact " assert " any such thing and
whether the above is in any sense a fair quotation :--" I note with
surprise that Dufresne's Waxbill is stated to be . . . not difficult to
breed in captivity. . . . But who has ever bred it and where has it
been bred ? . . . A diligent search at all events has failed to reveal--
[Italics please, Mr. Printer !]-- any published record of its having been
bred either in this country or even on the Continent, so one may be pardoned
for doubting whether this statement is even approximately correct ." It
is, I think, fairly clear from the foregoing that 1 do not assert it has
never been bred in captivity, " neither in this country nor the Continent ,"
but merely state that I can find no published record of its having
done so, and that therefore I cannot suppose the statement that it
is not difficult to breed in captivity can be even approximately accurate.
Now, even if M. Decoux can prove that this Herr Baumer actually
did breed this Waxbill in 1910, which, however, he has certainly not
done as yet, it does not in the least alter the truth of my statement.
My letter appeared in October, 1923, so that it has taken M. Decoux
three months to record this solitary instance, at present unsubstantiated,
of some unknown German having succeeded in breeding this " not
difficult to breed species". A pitiable record surely for a species
which has been imported in considerable quantities during, at any rate,
the last four years ! I cannot, of course, be held responsible for the
mistakes of M. Decoux's translator, but surely he might himself have
made the necessary correction! Although I have consulted the

following authorities, I have searched in vain for a single instance
of the successful rearing of a Dufresne's Waxbill:--Dr. Butler;
Mr. Wesley Page, Species which have Reared Young in Captivity ,
published 1914; Dr. Hopkinson, Records of Birds which have been Bred
in Captivity ; Bird Notes , 1918, 1919, 1920, a most carefully compiled
and up-to-date list of all birds bred in captivity, Dr. W. T. Green;
the Avicultural Magazine from the first number to the present year,
a period of 31 years inclusive; Bird Notes in like manner from birth,
comprising a period of 22 years; German authorities , Dr. Buss and
Herr Wiener; French, UOiseau and M. Henri Moreau. Let us by all
means raise our hats to Herr Baumer, if his record can be proved,
but even so it must be taken as the proverbial exception that proves
the rule. " Near to success " and " actual success " are very different
things, and it is idle for M. Decoux to pretend otherwise. I, for
instance, and some others have been " near to success " with Violet-
eared Waxbills, yet so far as is known the first aviary-bred Violet-ear
has still to be raised. M. Decoux asks whether my acquaintance
with Waxbills is as long as his own, which, I gather from his letter,
commenced in 1901. Personally, I must confess that a test of this
nature, to borrow an expression from the dwellers upon the other side
of the " herring-pond ", " cuts no ice with me Some people will
learn in a year what others may not discover in ten. Keen and
intelligent observation, coupled with the capacity for making correct
deduction from facts observed, is wdiat counts. Moreover, anyone
who does not personally attend to all the requirements of his charges
can never learn very much about them. However, since he makes
rather a point of this question, I can assure M. Decoux that I can
beat his record fairly comfortably. I acquired my first bird, a Gold-
finch, in 1892, when I was barely ten years of age. Four years later,
in 1896, I became possessed of my first foreign birds, mostly Weavers,
Saffron Finches, Mannikins, etc., and the following year I added
to this collection at least four species of Waxbills. I may add that
I took these birds back to Harrow with me in 1897 and 1898. Followed
a blank of two years, when in the summer of 1900 I built my first
outdoor aviary. Since that time to the present, save for a break
during the war, I have never been without Waxbills. As regards

the meaning of the word " hardy " as applied to foreign birds, it
is true that I did not specially define the word, but in this country,
at any rate, I think that by the term " hardy species " we would mean
a species which could be left with safety in an unheated outdoor open
wire-netting-enclosed aviary, with of course a snug shelter attached,
throughout the year, and it is surely clear from my remarks that
I took this definition for granted in my previous letter. Whatever
M. Decoux may believe to the contrary I have proved by long
experience, both to my own satisfaction and to the satisfaction of
many others, that not only Waxbills, but Tanagers, Sugar- and Sun-
birds, etc., will live in perfect health and condition throughout the
winter caged in rooms entirely devoid of either artificial light or heat,
once they have been properly acclimatized, and will give, as I have
stated in another article, far better breeding results than birds which
have been kept coddled in warm aviaries during the cold season. All
that I have found necessary in the case of the more delicate species
is to cover up their cages during the night, in order to avoid draughts,
etc. I may mention that Mr. Wesley Page, who has had probably
as much experience as any living aviculturist in the keeping of foreign
birds, is in complete agreement with the opinion expressed above.
At the same time, it is only fair to add that my experience only relates
to such weather conditions as prevail in the south and south-westerly
portions of England. But whilst it is true that all species of which I
have had any experience may be kept with safety caged in an unheated
room throughout the winter under the conditions already described,
there are certain species which, in my opinion, it would be decidedly
unsafe to keep throughout the year in an outdoor aviary exposed to
the weather, even when such an aviary is provided with that sine
qua non , a good and snugly built shelter for the birds to roost
in. Birds such as these I would term " delicate ", whereas those that
could be so kept I would term " hardy ", and I believe that it is in
this sense that those terms are usually employed in this country.
M. Decoux presumably introduces Peacocks, which are otherwise
as foreign to this discussion as poultry, in order the more emphatically
to emphasize the fact that in his opinion size has considerable relation
to " hardiness ". This is, however, by no means the case, and just

a couple of instances taken at random will easily demonstrate the
fallacy of such a contention : (1) Rufus-backed Mannikins are much
u hardier " than Green Cardinals ; (2) Gold-breasted Waxbills than
Violet Tanagers. It is difficult to see on what grounds M. Decoux
finds it impossible to compare birds of different species from the point
of view of " hardiness It seems to me, on the contrary, that it
would be quite a simple matter to draw up a list of birds of entirely
different species and habits which might be kept with reasonable
safety under precisely similar conditions, in the type of garden aviary
described above for example, and it would be equally easy to draw
up another list of birds which would not be likely to do well under such
conditions. So wherein lies the difficulty of such comparisons ?
As regards the expression " cold glass aviary " used by M. Decoux,
I really do not see how I could be expected to know that in using
this term he really meant something entirely different, and under the
circumstances it must be admitted, I think, that I was quite justified
in drawing the conclusion I did. Now, whilst Lord Tavistock's
experiment in partially wintering a pair of Violet-eared Waxbills
is of great interest, it most certainly cannot be taken as " an evident
proof of the ' hardiness ' of this Waxbill ". In this connexion one may
perhaps be permitted to quote the admission M. Decoux makes at the
commencement of his letter, viz. : " But I quite agree with Capt.
Rattigan that it is often unsafe to generalize too quickly." Yet here
he is quite ready to conclude from the fact that a single pair has
managed to survive a portion of the winter at liberty, that the whole
species may be quite definitely classed as " hardy Moreover, on
referring to my diary, I find that the winter of 1921-2 was an
exceptionally mild one, in these parts at any rate, and I have a note
to the effect that numbers of people were bathing in the sea at Torquay
up till the 3rd November. In spite of this, however, I would not
expect a pair of Violet-ears which had roughed it in this manner to
survive the experiment for very long, for it seems probable that their
constitutions must have suffered a severe strain. It would be of
interest, therefore, if Lord Tavistock would kindly inform us whether
this pair of Waxbills still exists. In any case, it is well to bear in mind
the fact that "one Swallow does not make a summer". If these

Waxbills are really as hardy as M. Decoux would have us believe,
may I ask him to explain what has become of the very large consign-
ments imported by the late J. D. Hamlyn during 1921 and 1922 ?
I doubt whether half a dozen have been exhibited during the last
two show seasons, and not a single Dufresne's Waxbill, stated to be
" as hardy as the others These are not merely statements, but
facts quite easy of proof. Yet Dufresne's Waxbill has been extremely
common on the market for the last few years, and it is not very long
since I must have seen about a couple of hundred at Gamage's alone,
and all in seemingly first-rate condition. Yet none have been
exhibited, none appear to have been bred, and none advertised by
private persons for sale for as long as I can remember. I think we
may conclude, therefore, that the vast majority are dead. I doubt
whether any single aviculturist has two pairs in his possession at the
present time. Finally, with reference to M. Decoux's remarks upon
Quail Finches. Until we have some more evidence to go upon, to
describe them as he does " as amongst the easiest to breed in captivity "
is a statement of such manifest absurdity that it hardly merits con-
tradiction. Considerable quantities of these birds were imported
by Hamlyn in 1919, 1920, 1921, and 1922 (for confirmation of
this statement see advertisements in Cage Birds for these years,
or confirmation could doubtless be obtained from Mrs. Hamlyn),
and dozens of pairs must have been distributed throughout the country,
so it is surely curious that no further record of the successful breeding
of this species has been recorded ! Moreover, Mr. Reginald Phillips,
who was certainly one of the cleverest of modern aviculturists and has
recorded some quite extraordinary breeding successes, met with
considerable difficulty and many failures and disappointments before
finally succeeding in breeding this species. Some people have found
Gouldians absurdly easy to breed, whilst others, and, upon his own
admission in a letter to me, M. Decoux included, have found things
quite otherwise. The same thing applies to Parrot Finches and many
other species. Some are lucky with one, but have no luck with another,
but it is only birds which breed freely with the majority that can be
correctly termed " easy to breed ". M. Decoux happens to have met
with some success with this species, so he instantly labels them

" amongst the easiest to breed But, except for a few vague indefinite
statements such as : " It is a long time since they [Quail Finches]
were bred by German aviculturists, for if I am not mistaken Quail
Finches were bred in Germany for the first time about 1880.' *
Personally, I fancy he is mistaken, but if M. Decoux can prove the
contrary let him produce definite evidence of this fact, for vague state-
ments like the foregoing are of no value whatever. Anyway, it is
curious that Russ, so far as I can discover, makes no mention of this
fact. Mr. R. Phillips, too, writes of his birds as " pioneer aviary-bred
Quail Finches ", 1910, and in Dr. Hopkinson's list Phillips alone is
given as having bred them. It would be of some interest to know
exactly how many Quail Finches M. Decoux has actually raised to
maturity himself, but I can state upon his own admission to me that
up till at all events the season of 1923 he had never bred the common
species of Quail Finch at all. G. E. Rattigan.
[The pair of Violet-eared Waxbills, referred to as having wintered
at liberty, had disappeared by the middle of May, but it is not known
whether they died, strayed, or were killed by vermin. As a Waxbill
that dies in the garden is, strange to&amp;apos; say, usually found, it is probable
that they met with a violent end. This pair were only imported in
late July: the hen arrived with a broken leg and the cock was in
immature plumage. The Editor has found Violet-ears hardier than
many Waxbills in their ability to stand chilly nights when newly
imported and to recover from the effects of the voyage. He believes
that the majority die from wrong feeding, for they cannot live all the
winter on dry seed.-- Ed.]

The Chestnut-shouldered Blue Grosbeak ( Guiraca ccerulea) is brilliant
cobalt; forehead chin and lores black; the greater wing-feathers
black, edged with blue; the medium wing-coverts deep bay or chestnut;
eye brown ; beak black, clear greyish blue beneath ; size somewhat
smaller than that of the Green Cardinal. Adult male in winter
ochreous brown, entirely concealing the blue plumage, excepting
on the lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts, where the blue is
apparent. The female is smaller, olive-brown above, washed with
rufous and grey on the rump and upper tail-coverts ; the feathers
of the back and shoulders are deeper in colour in the centre ; under
surface brown. A fair number of these birds were imported into
Europe between 1911 and 1914. The females have always been
rare. I have had several in poor condition ; one of them having
moulted, built a nest in an aviary, but died from an accident before
laying. The males are teasing and even wicked towards vreaker
companions ; they chase them incessantly, and pull out their feathers.
In a big aviary inhabited by large birds, this Grosbeak is very handsome
and lives a long time. Habitat: southern portions of United States
from Atlantic to Pacific throughout Mexico, and Central America to
Nicaragua and Costa Rica: also Cuba.
The Brazilian Blue Grosbeak (Cyanocopsa cyanea) is a bright deep
blue, forehead and area round the beak, black ; the lesser wing-coverts
cobalt blue; the top of the head and the ear region are the same
brilliant blue ; breast, darker blue, merging into black on the belly;
greater wing-feathers black edged with blue; beak black. There
are several varieties of this species which differ chiefly in their size.
The female is ochreish-brown; under surface ochreish-buff. The
species is imported fairly often, but seldom in great numbers, and the
females are rarer than the males; the latter have an agreeable
song, recalling that of the Robin Redbreast. It has nested several
times with me and other aviculturists and the young are easily reared.

It is gentle in an aviary. Total length, 6 inches. Habitat: Brazil,
Amazonia, Guiana, Venezuela, and Ecuador.
The Lazuline Grosbeak ( G. parellina) is only five inches in length.
Male: general colour above, deep indigo blue; rump, forehead,
cheeks, and lesser wing-coverts, deep cobalt blue ; lores, wings and tail,
black ; the greater wing-feathers are edged with brown ; beak black.
Female : general colour, earthy-brown. This bird is rarely imported.
Monsieur Delacour has a male in his collection. The species was bred
some twenty years ago in the aviary of the Abbe Charruaud,
near Bordeaux. Habitat: Mexico and Northern Yucatan, with
Islands of Meco and Mugeres.
The Bufous-chinned Grosbeak (Loxigilla noctis). --Male : entirely
black except for a small spot of dull brick-red over the eyes and the
throat, which is bright brick-red ; total length, five inches. Female :
above, olivaceous-brown, slightly tinged with reddish on the forehead
and upper tail-coverts. Under parts ashy-brown and grey. This
species is seldom imported, but was included in the collection of
M. Chiapella. M. Delacour also imported seven or eight of these
birds from Martinique. It is hardy and inoffensive in an aviary,
but has not yet been bred. Habitat: Lesser Antilles.
The Cardinals derive their name from their prevailing colour,
which recalls that of the robes of the princes of the Homan Church.
There are some twenty species, spread over the United States, Mexico,
Central America, and the north of South America. The most
frequently imported species is :
The Bed Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis). --General colour above,
deep scarlet vermilion, or deep rosy-red, with indications of ash-colour
to the edges of the feathers. The larger wing-feathers are of a duller
red, edged with bright rose. A distinct frontal line, lores, fore-part of
eyelid, feathers at gape and base of cheeks, as well as the chin and
upper throat, black; under parts, rich vermilion, more rosy on the
flanks; head, strongly crested, deep vermilion; beak, coral red.
Female : general colour above, dull ochreous-brown; wing-coverts and
quills, dull vermilion; under parts, ochreous-buff, washed with
vermilion ; crest, dull red with ochreous tips ; bill, coral red. The
Bed Cardinal is one of the most beautiful of birds, and as a rule in

a large aviary is not aggressive towards the other inmates. It is very
hardy and resists damp and cold well. The species has often been
bred. The young are fed principally upon live insects. Habitat:
Eastern United States; north to New Jersey and the Ohio valley;
west to the plains. It is abundant in Texas (Louisiana).
There are some ten local races further to the south, some of which
have been imported.
C. c. floridanus (Ridgway), which is somewhat smaller and darker. t
Florida.
C. c. superbus (Ridgway) is of a more robust form than the type,
and has a crest of fiery red. Northern Mexico.
C. c. igneus resembles the former, but is smaller, and the red is
deeper. The beak is shorter and thicker. Habitat: Southern
California.
The Phoenix Cardinal ( C . phceniceus) forms the link between the
Red Cardinal (C. cardinalis) and the Rose Cardinal (Pynhuloxia
sinuata), and should be placed in a separate genus. It is distinctly
distinguished by the strong curve of the beak, which is deeper than
it is broad. Male: general colour above, deep vermilion, rather
lighter towards the rump and upper tail-coverts. The crest is long
and upright and curves slightly forwards at the extremity ; it is
vermilion with dusky tips. A narrow black line round the beak
and the chin black ; head and under parts rich scarlet-vermilion ;
lesser wing-coverts scarlet; greater wing-feathers dusky grey-brown
with scarlet edges ; tail deep vermilion, somewhat dusky towards
the end; bill grey. The female is ochreous-brown, washed with
ash-colour ; crown of head and back of neck dull ashy ; the crest-
feathers dark vermilion with dusky tips ; a black spot, hardly visible,
beneath the beak ; greater wing-feathers edged with red. I have
possessed some ten of these birds at various times. They are hardy and
gentle with their companions in captivity. Unfortunately, they are
very rarely imported, especially the females. The pair which I have
now made a nest in 1922 and again in 1923, but they were destroyed
and no young ones were reared. The Phoenix Cardinal generally
arrives in very poor condition, and care has to be bestowed upon it
during the period of acclimatization. My female was purchased

in December, 1915, and my male in 1920. Habitat: Venezuela,
Trinidad, Colombia.
The Eose Cardinal (Pyrrhuloxia sinuata) is of a stronger build
than the preceding. Male: above, ash-grey washed with rose;
tail-coverts brighter; crest more bushy but shorter than that of the
Eed Cardinal, carmine mixed with black ; cheeks bright carmine ;
head and neck ash-grey washed with rose ; under parts clear carmine,
mixed with pale grey on the belly ; thighs carmine.; the sides of the
breast and the flanks pale grey, washed with rose ; greater wing-
feathers reddish-brown; wing-coverts carmine; beak orange-
yellow. Female : greyish above with an ochreous tint; crest duller
than in the male ; head and neck ashy-grey ; rose on the breast;
beak lighter. This species is still rarer than the preceding. Imported
in 1895, it figured in the collection of the Berlin Zoological Gardens.
According to a German aviculturist, this bird becomes very tame,
and is very gentle amongst smaller species ( Die Gcfiederte Welt, 1896,
p. 343). This bird seems to be rarely seen in its native country.
Beebe writes on the subject:--" Once and once only, did I see the
Arizona Pyrrhuloxia in Mexico. My sudden but fortunate descent
into the ditch alarmed a pair of birds which flew up and gave me
a full view of their beauties--Cardinal-like in action and crest, but
a delicate light grey in colour. The female bird had just a suggestion
of rose upon throat and breast, but her mate, perching with half-
open wings, glowed with the pure warm colour from forehead, breast,
under wings, and flanks. After a minute both birds disappeared,
and evaded all further search " (Two Bird Lovers in Mexico,
pp. 47-8). Habitat: Southern Border of United States from the
Eio Grande westward and southward into Mexico.

of all Fringillidce. Taken collectively, the Emberizince are more
insectivorous than the Fringillince ; many of them also are fairly
good songsters ; they build open, cup-shaped nests, and generally
lay from four to six eggs. The chief character which has been indicated
for distinguishing the Buntings is in the form of the beak, the cutting-
edges of the mandibles not being conterminous, leaving a more or less
defined gap in the outline of the closed beak, the angle at chin well-
defined. The presence of the afore-mentioned gap does not appear
to me to be a constant character ; it certainly varies. A good many
European species of Emberizce have, from time to time, found their
way into Zoological Gardens and private collections, but I think it
will be sufficient to confine my remarks upon the genus principally
to those species which are most frequently to be met with and con-
sequently are best known to our members.
Typical Buntings ( Emberiza , etc.)
Canary-seed, millet, oats, and hemp, with insects in all stages,
spiders, and centipedes suit these birds well as food. When breeding
in captivity insects are a necessity and soft food should be provided,
but I have not found any of the Buntings eager for green food.
Black-headed Bunting (. Emberiza melanocejihala)
The prevalent colour of the male above is cinnamon-brown, with
a conspicuous black cap on the head ; wings and tail brown, the wing-
coverts with whitey brown margins and the inner secondaries with
broad pale borders ; outermost tail-feathers with a narrow white edge
to inner web ; a streak at side of neck and under-surface bright yellow ;
beak, leaden grey ; feet, pale brown ; irides, hazel. The female is
much duller, above sandy brown with darker streaks ; rump, slightly
yellower ; wing-coverts and quills edged with buffish-white ; breast

and flanks, more sandy and more or less streaked ; abdomen and under
tail-coverts washed with yellow. This bird inhabits Southern Europe
from Asia Minor and Greece westwards to Southern Germany and
France and eastwards to North-Western and Central India ; from
time to time specimens have wandered to England, and it has been
exhibited at bird shows in this country. It nests in bushes and creepers
or on the ground, and, as with other species of its genus, is abundant
and its nest easily found ; the latter is loosely formed of the seed-
bearing heads of small flowering plants, and lined with dry grass,
bents, and hair ; the eggs, four to six in number, are pale greenish-
blue, spotted with brown and with grey shell-spots generally most
abundant at the larger end.
Reed-bunting (Emberiza schceniclus)
This beautiful but common species is too well known to need
description : how it ever came to be confounded with the preceding
species is incomprehensible, the only point in which they agree being
the black cap of the male ; of course, the black centre of throat and
breast and streaked white under-surface distinguish our common
reed-bird at a glance. It is a marsh-frequenting bird, building its
nest in a moist mossy depression in the ground, either more or less
concealed by grass tussocks or near the roots of reeds ; the materials
used are fine and coarse grasses or withered leaves of reeds or flags,
the lining being composed of fine grass and sometimes horsehair or
the feathery tops of reeds. The eggs number from four to six in various
stone tints from brownish-lavender to olivaceous buff, blotched, spotted,
speckled, and often boldly streaked with purplish black and with
lavender-grey shell-spots ; they have the opaque appearance of eggs
of the Chaffinch. As an aviary bird I found the Reed-Bunting by no
means aggressive, but very silent and shy, skulking in the bushes,
though apparently not scared by one's presence in the aviary : I never
heard any of those which I possessed utter a single note.
Grey-headed Bunting (Emberiza fucala)
This Bunting occurs in Japan, Eastern Siberia, and North China,
wintering in South China, Burma, and the plains of India ; in the
North-West Himalayas it is resident. The general colour of the male

head and neck, slate-grey ; upper tail-coverts, pale brown with blackish
centres, feathers of wings and tail dark brown with broad fawn-coloured
borders ; outer tail-feathers partly white on inner web ; lores, eyelid,
and a narrow, ill-defined superciliary line white ; ear-coverts, chestnut
with a small white spot on hinder margin ; a larger white spot on the
side of neck ; throat, white ; a narrow black moustachial streak
joining a black gorget across lower throat; the latter followed by
a broad greyish-white belt and a broadish red-brown band across the
chest; abdomen, whitish, the flanks washed with ochreous; beak,
reddish-brown, lower mandible flesh-tinted at base. Female rather
smaller, duller, and with less-defined markings, throat buff, the black
gorget and chestnut band broken up. It frequents both hilly country
and plains, nesting frequently at the root of a dense tuft of grass or
stunted bush, or concealed in the herbage at the foot of a wall, more
rarely in a bush at some little distance above the ground. The nest is
a strongly built shallow cup of dried grass lined with finer grass and hair.
The eggs are said somewhat to resemble one figured by Bree of the
Black-headed Bunting, to be white tinged with greenish-grey, specked
and freckled nearly all over with pale reddish or purplish-brown, but
, especially at the larger end, where the markings form an irregular
mottled cap or zone.
I have not been able to discover any notes on the song of this
species ; it has been exhibited at the London Zoological Gardens.

BIRD LIFE ON THE LAKE OF GENEVA

Winter, after her prolonged stay this year, seems at last inclined
to take her departure, for a very noticeable sign is the gradual
disappearance of the birds from the Lake ; I say gradual, for each
day sees fewer and fewer. One does not notice them congregate and go
away in flocks : it may be that they fly off in the dusk, in small
companies, and go we cannot tell where to their various breeding
haunts, but we know that we shall not see them again in any numbers
until towards the end of August and September, when they will come
back accompanied by their full, but not quite maturely, fledged
offspring.
Living, as I do, on the shore of the Lake, towards the Villeneuve
end, watching the seasons come and go, and with them the movements
of our feathered visitors, a bird-lover like myself has a great opportunity
of observing them, and can spend with the help of binoculars many
happy intervals during the day.
The pretty little Black-headed Gulls (Lams ridibundus), locally
called Mouettes, have been aptly described as looking like a fleet
of paper boats, as they ride up and down on the wavelets on a sunny
day ; I fancy I have sometimes seen rather bigger Gulls amongst
them with a longer stretch of wing; I may be wrong, but it is rather
difficult to judge, for I have noticed that atmosphere makes a great
difference to one's sight and sense of proportion. When the air is
clear, and the mountains, sky, and water seem blended and almost

floating in the wonderful blue ether, and the horizon-line melts into the
sky, these little Gulls look so tiny, flying about or poised on the smooth
surface of the water ; but when they are wheeling about against a
background of ragged mist and indigo-tinted mountains, their white
breasts gleaming as they turn and dip, rise and fall, on outstretched
black-tipped wings, now battling against the wind, now turning to be
borne along at a racing speed, they appear quite large and formidable
birds.
I look through the glasses at groups of animated black balls, which
suddenly disappear and reappear, as though they were playing some
game ! They are the Poules d'eau, or Coots, which come to the Lake
in quantities and stay all the winter and most part of the summer.
Their compact bodies are closely covered with small rough feathers of
a rusty black, and when flying the wings show just a thin edge of white ;
their long beaks of yellowish-white start'from a horny-looking substance
on the forehead, and their feet are partially webbed. I take them to
be Fulica atm.
Of the Ducks there seem to be only two species about here, the
ordinary Wild Duck (of which occasionally a few fly over in groups
of only two or three couple at a time), and the small Divers, the very
prettiest little things imaginable. The colouring of the drakes is
black and white, white predominating ; their black heads have a small
tuft at the back. The females are brown, like the ordinary Wild Duck.
These little things are most fascinating, and swim about closely
packed together, often four or five abreast, the drakes leading, and
the ducks obediently following their lords and masters !
About three or four winters ago a few of the beautiful Greebe made
their appearance (Podiceps cristatus), and ever since then they regularly
arrive now in quantities. They look very formidable, with their
sword-like beaks and long necks, especially when they rear their heads
and spread out their fan-like " ears ", but they are really quite peace-
able, and Gulls, Ducks, Coots, Swans, and themselves swim about
together quite amicably over the same fishing-ground.
The fact that all these birds are absolutely wild has a great charm
for me : they are free to come and go as they like, and are mercifully
safe from guns, for no birds are allowed to be shot, at least at this end

of the Lake. They are wonderfully tame, and all but the Greebes
will feed quite close to the shore : the Gulls, in winter, will sometimes
take bread from your hand ! They really seem to understand that
their usual enemy, man, is powerless to hurt them.
The next arrivals are the big brown Kites (Milvus vulgaris), which
make their appearance when nearly all the winter visitors have gone ;
then they come sailing over the woods and rocks for their daily fishing
in the Lake, sometimes in pairs, and often in numbers of six or seven
at a time. They too are fairly bold, and give one an opportunity
of seeing the beautiful markings of brown and grey on their plumage,
and now and then one can also catch a glimpse of their large bright
eyes, as they make their graceful evolutions in the sunshine.
Once, and only once, at some distance away, I saw five Storks,
but evidently they were not coming to pay us a visit, for they flew
away in the direction of France and were soon lost to sight.
A PURCHASE IN SANTA CRUZ
By Hubert Astley
Many years ago the first Red Siskin, of Venezuela and Trinidad,
that I ever saw came into my possession at Santa Cruz, when I visited
Tenerife [let no reader say " Tenerife " should have two/'s : it should
not, as the Spaniards spell it], and of that particular Siskin is it not
written in a back volume of the Magazine ? I kept it in England
for a while, and then it was no more. Now, at Giiimar, in Tenerife,
I had made the acquaintance of, and finally friends with, two English
ladies : sisters ; who had for reasons of health sojourned there during
several years ; and let no one picture to themselves a couple of rather
bony and middle-aged women : they were young and attractive,
and had won the hearts of all the natives with whom they came in
contact, so that there were sighs and tears when they finally embarked
for England.
I had written to tell them of the decease of my lovely Red Siskin
(I did not trouble them with Chrysomitris cucullatus; had I done so,
they would have been none the wiser !), and just as they had reached
Santa Cruz, and were awaiting the immediate arrival of the steamer,
the younger sister announced her intention of inquiring in the market

for another Siskin to bring to me. About to relinquish her search,
after a hundred inquiries and drawing blank, someone informed her
that a butcher possessed one. In Spain and Italy one only has to
tell one person of one's search for anything in particular for a crowd
to gather quickly, crammed with curiosity and suggestions and a general
atmosphere of minding your business in place of their own, so that
by the time the English senorita arrived at the butcher's shop she
was surrounded by Spaniards of various ages and callings, who con-
sidered that for their own affairs " Manana " would suffice.
The report was a true one. At the back of the butcher's stall
hung a cage in which a lovely Hooded Siskin was hopping about.
Then began the preliminaries to the purchase. The English senorita
was unknown to the butcher, but she was English, and therefore sure
to have a purse crammed down and running over with good Spanish
dollars. At first--" No," he did not wish to sell his " cardenal "
(as these Siskins are called over there), it was not for sale, he kept
it as a pet. And the senorita was persistent, she must have it, she
wanted it most particularly, so that finally the butcher--influenced
perhaps in part by beauty and blue-grey Irish eyes and one fascinating
dimple--said : " Well! the senorita can have the bird, without the
cage, for twenty dollars." But she knew her Spanish, both people
and language, very intimately; so that finally, with momentary
additions to the crowd, the butcher said : " Very well, to please the
senorita, twelve dollars, but not a peseta less." And still the senorita
shook her head, and still the argument continued.
Of a sudden, coming down the arcades, a tall dignified figure was
seen approaching, a native woman, with her head swathed in a black
kerchief, on the top of which was perched, rather over her nose, a small
black felt hat with narrow brim and flat crown. " Ah," quoth the
butcher, " here is a great friend of mine, Frasquilla. 1 Will the
senorita abide by her judgment ? I will ask her : the senorita shall
have the cardenal for the price Frasquilla decides on."
Unfortunately for the butcher, he was totally unaware that
Frasquilla, whose trade was a carrier's, was a very old and devoted

friend of the English senorita. She had acted as carrier for years,
bringing goods from Santa Cruz to Giiimar.
Frasquilla heard the butcher's tale of the bargaining. She stood
in her Spanish dignity, listening, but made no sign that she knew the
senorita.
" Twelve dollars," said the butcher, "for a bird worth twenty
at the least, is not that a fair price, Frasquilla ? " Frasquilla con-
sidered for a moment, whilst a deep silence fell amongst the crowd.
Then she pointed a finger at the bird and delivered judgment: "You
will sell that bird to the senorita for jive dollars, and the cage
thrown in."
The butcher nearly fell backwards, and the crowd set up a roar
of derisive laughter, whilst Frasquilla proceeded to greet joyfully
her beloved senorita. The curtain fell upon this little comedy as the
senorita departed for the steamer with Frasquilla accompanying
her, carrying the cage !
A CRAZY MOTHER-SHAMA
By S. C. Law
The conduct of a nesting female Shama in my aviary has struck
me as unusual. A male and a female Shama were the inmates of
adjacent aviaries. They were kept separate because in the non-breeding
season the male cannot tolerate the company of the female, and takes
the law into his hands to keep her out of his presence. Fully aware
of this, the hen also gives him a wide berth. But in March last, as
I noticed a change in the attitude of my above two birds, which appeared
to court each other's company, I brought them together. The hen
showed no fear of the male ; on the contrary, she flew boldly to him,
and in a few days seemed to be the master. The cock evidently
became hen-pecked. There was variety in his coquettish displays.
One of these attitudes was, when the female was on the ground, to
drop suddenly down before her with a low whistle. Then he stretched
out his head and gradually bent it till his chin and bill rested on the
ground, while the hinder parts went up, the tail being held straight in
the air. The hen would remain perfectly still as if graciously accepting

the homage. At times she showed her restlessness by beginning to
pull down the nests of other birds breeding in the aviary. To afford
her a suitable nesting-site I put up a long piece of very fat bamboo
with a hole above each joint. The male Shama took possession of
the bamboo, and, after inspecting all the holes, fixed upon one just above
the lowest as the most suitable for their purpose. The hen did not
take any notice of it. The cock tried his best to draw her attention
to it. He would continually fly to the bamboo and, returning to her
side, fly back again. This clear suggestion for the inspection of the site
was either unintelligible to her or ignored by her at first. She was,
however, induced at last to go to the hole, but she preferred the lower-
most cavity, for soon after she began to carry nest materials, which
consisted of fine coco-nut fibres. I used to hold these out to her, and
she fearlessly took them away from my hand. If I gave her a rough
fibre she always smoothed and cleaned it by beating it on the ground.
She would take away four or five pieces at a time, and after arranging
them in the hole she would invariably come back with a piece of fibre
in her mouth.
The nest was begun on the 25th March and completed on the 30th.
She laid the first egg on the 31st and went on laying one egg every day
till the 4th, making a clutch of five eggs. I removed one for my
egg-collection box, leaving her four eggs to hatch. The male took
no part in the incubation, but whenever the hen came out to feed he
flew up to the perch in front of the nest as if to mount guard.
On the 14th April the first young hatched out, two others on the
next day, and the last one on the 16th. The same day she behaved
like an unnatural mother. She was noticed to come out of the nest
with a young one in her bill. This she beat to death. She brought out
two others also and left them on the floor. With the fourth she flew
up to a perch and killed it by dropping it to the ground. The two
abandoned chicks were restored to their nest. For the next three days
the hen behaved in quite a motherly way and looked after the chicks.
She used to hunt around the aviary for insects for the young, because
at this time she totally discarded her usual diet of egg-food. The
male was noticed at times to carry food to her in the nest. I thought
that there would be no more tragedy and the two young birds would

grow up. But on the 19th the hen again killed a chick by dropping
it from a height. The fourth young was found dead in the nest after
another couple of days, and the mother made no attempt to remove
the carcase.
From the 22nd April the hen began to carry nest-materials again.
This time the birds selected another piece of similar bamboo. But
strangely enough, she carried materials to three different holes in the
bamboo, in none of which she completed a nest. On the 27th I found
two eggs in two different holes and another lying broken on the floor.
I placed the two eggs together, but the next day they were deliberately
thrown out and destroyed by the hen.
I was naturally very much annoyed. I had been looking forward
to raising at least one brood of young Shamas from the pair. I saw no
reason why the hen should behave so unnaturally after taking all the
trouble of nest-building. Even after the above two abortive attempts
the hen still seemed to possess a strong inclination to nest. I decided
to give her another chance before removing her from the aviary.
Unfortunately, however, the eggs of the third clutch were destroyed
one by one every day as they were laid. This time I never saw a whole
egg, but every morning I used to find the contents of a broken egg on
the floor underneath the nest. I have since locked the female up in
a cage, as I mean to give another female Shama I possess a chance to
pair up with the male and raise a brood if she can.

Sir, --Captain Rattigan finds fault with some of my statements.
Perhaps they need some explanation. I must own that my experience
of Dufresne's is very limited. Experience differs : I write mine.
I ought to have said that I have found Dufresne's Waxbill quite
as hardy as any other species of Waxbill. I expected that that would be
understood. One cannot compare the hardiness of a barn-door fowl
with a Hummingbird's.
Only having had two pairs in all, not three or four pairs, how many
pairs has Captain Rattigan lost ? There is nothing in losing a pair of

newly imported birds. Even the hardy Java Sparrow has been known
to die after importation. My second pair belonged to the same con-
signment, and were bought about a week after the first pair on
29th September, 1921. The hen died about the middle of May, 1923.
Having been placed in a rather exposed aviary early in that month,
she started laying and then it turned cold and dull and she died of
egg-binding. Any full-plumaged bird might have done that, even
a Ribbon Finch, which I think is a hardy bird in the ordinary sense
of the word. Having laid two clutches of eggs and started incubation
in each case, it was not the bird's fault that she did not sit the full
time, and, laying again almost as soon as it was put out of doors, all within
twelve months, I think I am justified in saying that it is more inclined
to nest with me than other Waxbills, as the behaviour of one bird,
even, gives some indication of the habits of a species. At various times,
and in much more suitable aviaries and localities, since 1902 I have
kept many of nearly all the other Waxbills which are freely imported,
but besides a few odd eggs and one or two dead young, I have only
once bred Avadavats and Goldbreasts, and nearly succeeded with
St. Helena (frightened off the young by a cat).
I can say nothing about rearing Dufresne's, and did not.
How many of us freely breed Waxbills in our aviaries every season ?
Many do not get a chance to breed because they are crowded out
by larger birds, so one reads in reports. But where they are given
a chance ?
Dufresne's seem to be very seldom imported, or I should not have
given my experience with only two pairs to go on, and one dying so
soon. I sold my cock last autumn, despairing of ever getting another
hen. I saw a few this year, but they seemed all hens and not in the
best of condition, and one cannot judge from a newly imported, out-of-
condition specimen. And that has nothing to do with the hardiness
of a bird : we must find a suitable food before that. I believe Gouldians
and Pintailed Nonpariels would be hardy if we could feed them
correctly ; I fancy that their digestions are ruined before we get them.
How long would a cow live on dog biscuits ? As to my aviaries only
being fit for summer use does not alter my contention at all. Firstly,
because my birds, being all treated alike, I can compare them with each

other. Secondly, because a properly constructed aviary contains
a dry sheltered shed, generally heated as well, for winter use, where
the birds can take more exercise than in a cage, and that is a great
assistance in keeping them in health. As I observed, I failed to keep
them properly in a cage 36 by 16 by 15 inches ; they did not moult
correctly.
Since I have given my birds a light to feed by and left off the
cover at night I have never found a dead bird in the morning that
was quite healthy the night before. The dead birds had their crops
quite empty. I examined them, and the larger birds were very
exhausted, but they recovered soon after they had fed. They all
flocked down to the seed vessels as soon as the cover was off, showing
that they were very hungry. Another thing about covering them up
is that birds must have fresh air. Under a cover they have to breathe
their own effete breath half the night unless the cage is very large.
All last summer my Gouldians and Green Singing Finches slept out
in exposed places in preference to going into the shelter, proving that
birds do not always seek a cosy shelter at night. Why should there
be more draught at night than day ? The windows are shut and the
fire is out.
Having cured a complaint by a change of treatment, one thinks
one must have found the cause, otherwise they are treated exactly
the same way as before.
In my own mind, I believe that mere cold does not affect birds
very much, provided they have plenty of food and exercise. Damp
cold they cannot stand ; I do not refer to water birds.
I apologize to those who have waded through all the above, but
in trying to be brief before it seems that I have missed my point.

mind the interesting remarks by C. H. Donald, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U., about
piratical birds of prey, in the Magazine, 1922, pages 142 to 144.
One of the Peregrines knocked down a Sparrow near the front bars,
and having killed it, took the prey and flew to a perch close to where the
other Peregrine was sitting quietly--both Falcons facing me and
other spectators.
The Falcon which had killed the prey held it, just previous to
beginning to make a meal of it, in the toes of its left leg, that was the
leg nearer to the other Falcon. But before the former could begin, the
latter suddenly stretched out its right leg and got firm hold with its
toes round the head and neck of the prey and then both Falcons started
to screech at each other, as each tried to pull away the prey from the
other, a tug-of-war which lasted about thirty seconds until the
neck gave!
Now the behaviour of the two Falcons became different, the thief
at once swallowing the stolen head and neck at one mouthful
(obviously pleased, as it sat there quietly afterwards, with its successful
pilfering !), while the Falcon which had lost part of the meal it had killed
flew away at once with the remaining body, wings, etc., into the farthest
corner, still screeching wildly in anger at the thief, and evidently not
intending to run any further risk of losing more !
As our member, Mr. Donald, has had much experience of pirate
Falcons and other diurnal birds of prey, I should like to ask two
questions about the doings of the large Saker Falcon (Falco sacer) in
North India.
Firstly, as the Saker attains a length of about 24 inches in the
female, this seems to suggest, when looking at a live bird, that it might
be able successfully to thieve prey from a small Eagle, such as Bonelli's,
about 26 inches long, or from a part-grown Eagle. Has Mr. Donald had
any experience of this in the Punjab ? Secondly, is the Saker (in
his experience) particularly hostile towards Kites ?
Frederick D. Welch, M.B.C.S.
[Birds of prey are practically full-grown before they begin to kill for
themselves, so a Saker would be unlikely to rob a " part-grown " Eagle
which would be a nestling still under the care of its parents.-- Ed.]

Sir, --Referring to Mr. Nicholson's query in your July issue, as
a small boy I succeeded in obtaining a young Kestrel in the down,
and successfully reared it by catching Sparrows and cutting up the
flesh into small pieces. I did not do this long, however, as one day
I put the dead Sparrow in the cage in order to see what would happen,
and to my amazement the Kestrel at once stripped off the feathers
and tore the flesh in a way which seemed almost incredible for so young
a bird. However, for the future I did not do more than supply it with
the Sparrows, and it thrived and was quite healthy with me for some
years.

A PRACTICAL HANDBOOK OF BRITISH BIRDS 1
The authors of A Practical Handbook of British Birds are to be
congratulated on the completion of their task, and with the appearance
of Part xviii a very up-to-date work on the avifauna of the British
Isles is available. As we remarked when reviewing one of the earlier
parts in this journal, one of the good features of the book is the fact
that it is not the work of any one author alone but of several, each
of which has been chosen because of his or her special knowledge
of some branch of the subject.
The science of ornithology has advanced greatly within recent years,
especially in the direction of the geographical distribution of species
and the lines of demarcation of the various geographical races, with
the result that many of the birds which occur as resident species in
our islands can be readily distinguished from the Continental birds and
must be regarded as geographical races or sub-species. Hence, names
that we have known all our lives have had to be changed and the
adoption of the trinomial system in nomenclature has become
imperative, for it is the only satisfactory system by which the various
races of a species can be named so as to indicate their relation to the
type species. Linnaeus named his species from Continental specimens,
and so the Continental forms must bear the original names, and, if ours
differ, they must be regarded as sub-species and carry sub-specific
titles or third names. Thus, while we have always considered that
our British Coal Tit should be called Pams ater, we find that this name
was bestowed by Linnaeus upon a Continental specimen, and it is
found that the Continental birds are not identical with ours, so ours
must be regarded as a sub-species of the Continental form, and hence
the name of Parus ater britannicus has been applied to it, while the

Irish birds, which are found to be again distinct, are known as Pams
ater hibernicus.
The question as to which of several authors' names should be
adopted for a species has been settled by the strict adherence to the
rule of priority, dating back to the tenth edition of Linnaeus ; and so
strictly has this rule been adhered to that further changes, some of
them very unfortunate ones, have been made in the names of birds,
and one fails to recognize old friends by their new titles. Thus it
has been found that the name of Turdus musicus , which we have
all fondly imagined belonged for all time to the Song-thrush, was
given (doubtless in error) by Linnaeus to the Eedwing in this particular
edition of his work, and the latter must for evermore take on the
name, while the Song-thrush has to get used to the new name of
Turdus &amp;apos;philomelus clarJcei !
There are thirty coloured and monochrome plates in the book,
and these are of great value, as, instead of being merely pretty pictures
of birds, they illustrate the various characters by which species,
nestlings, or various phases of plumage may be distinguished. The
down plumage of nestling birds has hitherto been much neglected
in books, and the plates in the work under notice are not only very
attractive pictures but of great value to those who are interested
in the young stages of birds. There are also 350 text-figures from the
skilful pen of Mrs. Hartert, and these are all of much value in calling
attention to important features. Thus, one shows three heads of
Puffins, illustrating the change in the bill from the juvenile to the
highly decorated stage of the breeding bird, while another shows
the difference in the wing-bars in the Stock- and Rock-doves, and so on.
The whole work runs to over 1,500 pages of text, and the last
part contains additions and corrections, bringing it completely up
to date.
There is no doubt that this Practical Handbook will for long rank
as a standard work on the subject of British birds, and it reflects very
great credit upon Mr. Witherby and his co-authors, who have spared
no pains in probing every source from which accurate knowledge could
be gained. We most heartily commend this work to students of
British birds. D. S-S.

(Continued from p. 97.)
The Black-headed Grosbeak (Orizoborus torridus). This is a fairly
small bird, with a thick and very short bill. The head, neck, tail,
and wings are black, the latter relieved by a small white spot. The
rest of the body is a bright chestnut. The female is of a darker brown
shade on the back and lighter underneath. It is not frequently
imported, but is a favourite cage-bird amongst the inhabitants of
Guiana. Habitat: Brazil, Guiana, Venezuela, and Ecuador.
The Black Grosbeak (0. crassirostris) much resembles the preceding,
but is entirely black ; the flight feathers have brown or white edges.
The female is brown. This bird is even more rarely imported than
0. torridus , and is of little interest as a cage-bird. Habitat: Guiana,
Venezuela, and Colombia.
The Orizobori in many ways resemble Spermophila or Sporophila.
These, we are told by Russ, are merely small Grosbeaks of quiet and
gentle ways. Many of them have quite a pleasant song, and although
as a rule their plumage is not brilliant they ought to be more popular
amongst aviculturists, for they are hardy and peaceable in an aviary.
Few species have, up to now, bred in captivity, probably because they
have not been given the chance. The few Sporophilse which have
nested in Europe have reared their young without difficulty on a diet
of seed and a few insects. They are, therefore, in many respects
desirable aviary birds, and there are about sixty different species.
The following have been imported into Europe. They are sold in
France under the name of " Little American Bullfinch ".
The Bluish Finch (Sporophila coerulescens) is of a dark slate-grey
colour, shading to black on the back and neck ; ears, black ; cheeks,
white ; chin, black. The throat, which is greyish-white, is separated
from the abdomen, which is of the same colour, by a black band which
crosses the chest. The beak is yellow. The female is greyish-brown
above and whitish below; beak, blackish. Habitat: Brazil and
Paraguay.
Sporophila ornata resembles the preceding, but the cheeks are

black and it has a white line between these and the throat, which
is black ; also, a white spot on the primaries. Habitat: Bahia.
These last two species are called Brazilian Bullfinches by bird
dealers. Although both are often imported, they do not appear
have nested in captivity. They are good songsters.
The White-throated Finch (S. albigularis) . The back is a dark,
slaty-grey ; the crown and sides of head, black ; a narrow white line
runs from the beak to the eye. The throat, sides of neck, abdomen,
and anal regions, white ; a black band runs across the chest, and the
beak is yellow. The female is a greyish brown above and white below ;
the beak is black. They have nested several times in captivity, and
have even reared young in a cage. It has a pleasant song. Habitat:
Eastern Brazil.
The Lined Finch (S. lineola). The upper surface is glossy greenish
black with a white band across the rump. A broad white line starts
at the back and spreads over the upper surface of the head. The
orbital region and throat are black ; the remainder of the under
surface pure white but washed with grey on the flanks ; beak, black.
The female is greyish olive, the upper darker than the under surface.
This is a very pretty bird, but seldom imported. Habitat: Guiana,
Venezuela, and Eastern Brazil.
The Ocellated or Black-headed Lined Finch ( 8 . ocellata) resembles
the preceding, but has an ill-defined broken white streak running
backwards from the beak instead of the white patch on the forehead.
The upper part of the neck and the sides are spotted with black ;
beak, black. Female, olive brown. Very rarely imported. Habitat:
Guiana, Venezuela, and Columbia.
The Guttural Finch (S. gutturalis). Upper surface of body, olive
green ; flights and tail-feathers brown edged with olive green ; the
head, neck, and throat, black; remainder of upper surface, pale
yellow. Female, olive brown. Hybrids have been reared in Germany
between this and the White-throated Finch. Habitat: Brazil, Guiana,
Venezuela, and Columbia.
The Chestnut-breasted Finch ( S . castaneiventris) . Of a bluish*
grey colour, wings and tail black, but each feather has a grey-blue
edge ; chest and throat, chestnut. There is a white spot at the base

of the mandibles ; beak and feet, brown. Female, brown ; breast,
pale ochre. Very rarely imported, but has been exhibited at the
London Zoological Gardens. Habitat: Guiana, Columbia, and Peru.
Dwarf Finch (S. minuta). This is one of the prettiest of the whole
genus. Cheeks, lower surface, and rump, cinnamon brown ; head,
neck, and the rest of the upper surface, grey-brown and olive grey.
There is a small white patch at the base of the beak ; flights and tail-
feathers dark brown with lighter edges ; iris, brown ; beak, black.
Female, light olive and yellowish olive on under surface. This bird
is seldom imported, but has been exhibited by the London Zoological
Society. Habitat: Panama, Columbia, and Ecuador.
Plumbeous Finch (S. &amp;apos;plumbed). Ashy grey, slightly paler on the
rump ; a small white spot on each cheek ; lores, black ; neck and breast,
ashy grey ; centre of abdomen, under wing-coverts, and axillaries,
white ; wings and tail-feathers, black, edged with grey ; lower eyelids,
white ; beak and legs, grey. Female, a uniform light brown ; paler,
almost whitish on the vent. It is a fairly good songster, and in Brazil
is frequently kept caged as a song bird. A friend kindly brought
me back one from Brazil, and it lived for years in a cage. It is said
to have been bred in Germany.
The Grey Grosbeak ( S . grisea) resembles the preceding, but has
not the white cheek spots. Female, brown. It is seldom imported,
but has a pleasant song suggestive of the Lark. Has been frequently
bred in Germany, amongst others, by Dr. Buss and Dr. Jantzan at
Hamburg. Habitat: Venezuela.
The Half-white Finch (S. hypoleuca) resembles the preceding, but
is rather larger and has a red beak. Is caged for its song in its native
country, but Buss describes this as monotonous. Habitat: Brazil.
The Collared Finch (8. eucullata). Upper surface, black ; shoulders
and lower back, grey, washed with ochreous, which becomes pure
ochreous in a belt across the rump ; cheeks, black ; throat and feathers
at the base of beak, creamy white ; a broad black band crosses the
chest. The rest of the lower surface is light brown ; tail and wings,
black; axillaries, white. Female, brown, a lighter brown on the
lower surface ; wings, dull grey-brown. It has been bred in Germany,
and has a soft and very pleasant song. Habitat: North Brazil and
Guiana.

White-breasted Finch (S. collaris) resembles the preceding, but
the lower surface, sides of neck, and rump are white. It is smaller
than S. cucullata, and very rarely imported. Habitat, South-East
Brazil.
Reddish Finch (S. nigro-aurantia) is cinnamon coloured, but the
wings, tail, and crown are black, with a white axillary patch on the
wing. Female, brown, ochreous on the lower surface. It is the
smallest, and one of the prettiest of the Spermophilae.
Marsh Finch (S. palustris). Crown, nape, and upper part of the
back, grey blue with longitudinal darker stripes. The remainder
of the upper part of the body is a brilliant reddish brown ; lower
lids, cheeks, and throat, white. The remainder of lower surface
is bright reddish brown ; wings, tail, and beak, black. Female, olive
brown, the back somewhat spotted, lower surface light brown. It
was imported for the first time in 1912, and is always rather rare.
Habitat: Argentina.
Euler's Finch (S. superciliaris). The upper surface is olive-grey ;
under surface, greyish-white with broad white bands across the fore-
head and throat; about as large as a canary. Female, uniform olive
grey. It is not an interesting species, but has reared young in the
aviaries of Dr. Russ. Its song is disagreeable and it is seldom
imported. Habitat: Brazil.
Tobago Finch ( S . americana). Rump, ashy-grey spotted with
black ; the rest of the upper surface of the body is shining black with
a small white eyebrow spot ; cheeks, chin, throat, breast, and centre
of abdomen are white ; sides of breast, blackish ; flanks, grey ; flight
feathers, black-edged with grey; beak, leaden grey. There are
two white wing stripes. Female, olive brown. It was exhibited
in Berlin in 1913. Habitat: South of Tobago, Guiana, and North
Brazil.
Spectacled Finch ( S . ophthalmica) resembles the preceding, but the
thighs are white instead of black, and the beak is back. Very rare,
imported for the first time in 1912. Habitat: Ecuador.
Black-banded Finch ( S . torqueold). Rump, cinnamon ; head and
upper surface of back, black ; a black band crosses the upper chest.
Below this band the breast is cinnamon, merging into white. The
sides of neck are white ; wings and tail, black ; beak, grey. Female,

light olive and under surface yellowish. It has once been imported
in 1895. Habitat: South-West Jamaica.
Dr. A. G. Butler has suggested creating a subspecies--the Phoni-
parinse--for the birds belonging to the genuses Melopyrrha and
Euclheia (or Phonipara), because these birds build spherical nests,
a fact which suggests a relation with the Ploceidse.
Black Seed Pinch (Melopyrrha nigra). Jet-black, with a white
patch on the wing, axillaries and under wing-coverts are also white ;
beak, black ; legs, dark brown. The sexes are difficult to distinguish,
but in adult birds the female is probably a little less brilliantly coloured.
According to Mr. Teschemaker, who has studied the species, the
secondaries are almost entirely white in the male but not so in the
female. If this observation is correct, it should be easy to sex these
birds. It was bred for the first time by Mr. Shore-Bailey in 1914, and
the species appeared to him to be hardy and prolific. Habitat: Cuba.
The Cuban Finch (Phonipara canora). The male is no larger than
a Waxbill, the upper surface of the body being black, with a velvety
black mask which is surrounded by a broad golden half-collar. The
chest is black, merging to grey on the flanks and under surface. Female
resembles the male, but the face is dark brown instead of black ; the
collar being narrower and straw-coloured; chest, grey-black. She
is distinctly smaller than her mate. This was formerly a rare species.
Not more than one pair should inhabit the same aviary.
The Olive Finch (Phonipara olivacea). Upper surface, olive ;
a blackish frontal line passes above the eye ; lores, eyebrow, stripe, and
eyelid, orange ; feathers in front of and below eye and cheeks, blackish ;
upper throat, orange ; lower throat, blackish ; wing and tail-feathers,
dusky olive. Female resembles the male, but her colours are fainter.
It is frequently imported, but was formerly rare on the market. This
is not by any means always a peaceful species, but it is easily bred
and prolific. I was the first to rear this species in France, and wrote
an account of this success in the Revue Frangaise d'Ornithologie in 1913.
Habitat: Cuba, Jamaica, and Haiti.
The Catalogue of Birds , vol. xii, mentions two subspecies--P.
o. intermedia and P. o. pusilla. They differ from P. olivacea by the
extent of the black on the chest, P. pusilla having the stronger markings.

Both subspecies have the yellow bib. P. pusilla comes from Mexico,
Central America, Panama, and Columbia. The other is found in the
Antilles.
The last example of this genus--the Dusky Finch ( Phonipara
bicolor) --differs from the others by the absence of black on the mask
and throat. It is found in the Antilles, Venezuela, and Columbia.
There is a subspecies with a lighter plumage found in Jamaica, but many
writers refuse to differentiate them from the type. This last is less
handsome than the Cuba or Olive Finch ; in an aviary their behaviour
is the same. P. pusilla has reared young in the aviary of that excellent
ornithologist, the late Mr. Reginald Phillips.
The Jacarini Finch ( Volatinia jacarini). A brilliant black bird
with bluish reflections, which are most marked on the head and neck.
A few odd grey feathers appear in the plumage, especially in autumn.
When in flight, the snow-white scapular feathers become obvious.
Female, upper surface earth brown, slightly ashy in the rump ; wings,
darkish brown. Males are imported each year, but females are seldom
seen. This bird is gentle and timid in the aviary, but it is easily bred.
The nuptial dance of the male is particularly amusing : the wings
and tail quiver as he pirouettes in front of his mate. This bird is
reminiscent of the Combassou. Habitat: Central America.
There is a subspecies, V. j. splendens, which has also been imported.
It comes from Guiana and Ecuador. The male differs from the type
in that the axillaries are black instead of white. A pair of these
Jacarinis nested this year in one of my aviaries, but did not rear their
young.

Yellow-browed Bunting (Emberiza elegans)
Said to be a favourite cage-bird of the Japs on account of its song
and doubtless, also, of its charming colouring. The male has the upper
back chestnut streaked with black and with huffish-white borders ;
lower back and upper tail-coverts ash-grey, the latter tinged with
chestnut; median and greater coverts blackish, tipped with buff and
whitish, forming two wing bars ; flights, dull brown with greyer
borders; greater coverts and secondaries, pale rufous externally;
tail, blackish, central feathers ashy, the rest with the exception of
the outermost feathers with ashy-brown edges, the last mentioned
white with a black marking at base of inner web and a dusky marking
near tip of outer web ; penultimate feather with a long white patch
on inner web ; crown and nape, black with a pale yellow dividing
stripe beginning above the eye and bounding the back of the head ;
in front it extends above the lores and across the forehead as a narrow
white band ; base of forehead and sides of head black with a white
band above the ear-coverts ; back and sides of neck ash-grey dotted
with black ; base of chin crossed by a narrow black line ; throat,
bright yellow separated by a white band from a black gorget; rest
of body below white, streaked at the sides with rust-reddish, more
broadly and with black central streaks on the flanks ; flights below,
dusky, ashy-whitish along inner web ; beak black ; feet, flesh-coloured ;
irides, brown. The female smaller and duller ; the ashy chestnut
streaked and bordered like the upper back ; crown, chestnut with
black bases to the feathers ; ear-coverts, darker ; yellow stripe on head
less defined, more orange and duller; body below dull white, the
black gorget ill-defined.
This pretty bird breeds at Ichang and Sechuen, is probably resident
in Japan, visits Manchuria and the valley of the Amur in summer,
and is a common winter visitor in China, where it frequents hillsides,
bamboo clumps, and rough scrub around farm-clearings ; its nesting-
habits are probably similar to those of other species of the genus.

Nyassaland and what used to be known as German East Africa. It
is a confiding species which, when disturbed, flies only a short distance
before settling again ; it feeds chiefly on the ground in open bush
country, perching occasionally on bushes and rocks to sing its
insignificant monotonous song ; it wanders about in small companies
of ten to a dozen individuals ; builds a nest of dry grass lined with
finer grass and hair, and lays four or five eggs, white, thickly scrawled
over with hair-like lines of dark purplish-brown. The nest is placed
in a low bush at the foot of a rock or on a ledge at the roots of herbage.
This handsome species was presented to the London Zoological Gardens
by Captain Horsbrugh in 1906. The male has the upper surface
chestnut in front and ash grey behind, with white edges to the upper
tail-coverts and ash-grey lesser wing-coverts, white middle coverts
with black bases ; black greater coverts edged with grey and tipped with
white ; flights, black edged with white excepting the inner secondaries,
which have chestnut edges; tail-feathers, black with grey edges,
the four outer ones tipped with white and the outermost one with
white web and a black spot; head, black, a central stripe on the crown;
the lores, a superciliary stripe, another below the eye crossing the
ear-coverts, the chin and a patch on the side of the neck white ;
axillaries, inner margins of flights and under tail-coverts white ; rest
of under-surface yellow, more orange on the chest, sides and thighs
grey, the flanks white. In the female the chestnut of the upper surface
is darker and streaked with black.
Yellow-breasted Bunting (Emberiza aureola)
An inhabitant of North and South Europe and Siberia, Yezzo,
and North China, wintering in Burma and the Malay Peninsula. Being
a commonly imported cage-bird, it is unnecessary to describe it in
detail; the prevailing colour of the upper parts is maroon, and of the
lower parts yellow, the upper throat black, excepting in the winter
a dark maroon collar behind the lower throat; the sides of breast
with chestnut to brown streaks, the vent and under tail-coverts
white. Female above, brown streaked with black, with the eyebrow

and under parts fulvous yellow, fading to white behind ; sides pale
brownish with blackish streaks.
In spring and summer this Bunting frequents plains, reed-beds,
and the marshy banks of rivers in considerable numbers, it nests in
low bushes or heads of stumps near (sometimes on) the ground ; the
character and number of eggs is probably much as in allied species.
Dr. Hartert speaks of a nest containing five eggs, but he fails to describe
them. In the autumn this species frequents corn and paddy fields
in considerable numbers. Its song is monotonous and short, but
is said to be melodious.
Buddy Bunting (Emberiza rutila)
This species, which inhabits Eastern Siberia, North China, and
perhaps Japan, winters in South China, Cochin-China, Indo-Burma,
and South-Eastern Himalayas. The male is largely deep-chestnut
above and sulphur-yellow below ; the sides, olive-greenish streaked
with blackish ; the wings and tail, mostly dark brown ; the female
mostly brown above streaked with black; wing-coverts, blacker,
yellowish-white towards tips; upper tail-coverts, paler with ashy
margins ; flights and tail-feathers, dark brown with pale borders,
those of secondaries reddish ; lores, orbital ring, and eyebrow, bufhsh ;
under-surface, mostly pale yellow, more ochreous on cheeks and throat;
a few dusky streaks on the breast; sides, ashy-olive broadly streaked
with blackish-brown. Bather common in the Southern Shan States
and in Chinkiang, where Mr. J. D. D. La Touche met with great
numbers on the hills ; it is said to have a single loud call-note. It
is occasionally imported, and has been exhibited at the London
Zoological Gardens.
Masked Bunting ( Emberiza per sonata)
Mostly rusty brown streaked with black above and yellow below;
feathers of mantle with paler markings ; feathers of lower back and
rump, olive-brown, more dusky in the centre ; median and greater
coverts, dull reddish with pale olive-brown edges and white tips ;
rest of wing, dusky brown with pale edges to the feathers ; upper
tail-coverts and tail-feathers, edged with buff, the former and the
central tail-feathers pale brown, the others blackish, the outermost

a row of stripes separating the moustachial stripe from the throat,
black ; throat, sulphur-yellow, finely streaked with dusky, fading to
clear yellow-brownish with dusky streaks at the sides ; " beak, brownish-
grey ; lower mandible with the base reddish ; feet, reddish-brown ;

the head and neck less green, the sides of crown rufescent; lores and
superciliary stripe, dull yellow ; ear-coverts, brown with yellow shaft-
lines ; less white on the tail; throat and chest washed with olive
and with triangular dusky spots; breast and abdomen, brighter
yellow, the flanks browner and streaked with black. This Bunting
inhabits Japan and China. As usual it nests on the ground or in
a grass tussock, using dry grass as material and fine roots and hair
as lining. Seebohm says that the eggs resemble richly marked examples
of those of the Ortolan. It is said to breed abundantly on Fuji-yama ;
it has been imported by Jamrach, and therefore probably by other
dealers.
Bonaparte's Bunting (Emberiza ciopsis)
Prevailing colour above bright chestnut and below cinnamon ;
upper back, streaked with black ; forehead and nape, somewhat ashy ;
lesser wing-coverts, slate-grey ; median and greater coverts, chestnut,
with the base black and the tips fulvous ; flights dusky brown with
pale edges, but the secondaries and central tail-feathers with bright
chestnut edges; remaining tail-feathers blackish, with the outer
fringes brown ; penultimate feathers with white edges and a large
white patch near end of inner web ; outermost feather, mostly white ;
sides of head, black with a broad superciliary white stripe from base
of beak to nape and a second broad white stripe below the eye ; sides of
neck bluish-grey, whitish behind the ear-coverts; throat, Xvhite;

coverts and axillaries, white ; flights below, dusky; beak, bluish
horn-colour; feet, brownish flesh-colour; irides, dark hazel. The
female is paler and browner, with broader streaks on mantle and
back ; centre of crown, ashy ; ear-coverts, chestnut; cheek stripe,
duller black ; throat, whitish and under parts paler. The commonest
of Japanese Buntings, breeding abundantly on Fuji-yama ; nesting
on or near the ground, the structure being formed of dry grass and
leaves and lined with fine rootlets ; the eggs are said to resemble
those of E. cia and cioides, scrawled over the larger end with fine hair-
like streaks. This species is occasionally imported and was to be seen
in the London Zoological Gardens in 1891.
White-crowned Bunting ( Emberiza leucocephala)
An inhabitant of Siberia, wintering in the North-West Himalayas,
occurring in Peking and occasionally in Europe and Japan. In its
habits it is said to nearly resemble the Yellow Bunting, the nest being
formed usually of coarse dead weeds, lined with fine grass and horse-
hair, and containing from four to six eggs of the usual character ;
the nest is placed in the open at the edge of a wood or thicket in a little
hollow in the earth under a shrub, the trunk of a tree, on fallen branches,
or under a piece of bark or dead grass among bushes. The male sings
to the incubating hen from a dry branch, the song being a little harsher
than that of our common species.
The upper parts of this bird are reddish-brown, with dark brown
shaft-streaks ; the top of the head white in the male, but greyish in
the female ; rump and upper tail-coverts cinnamon-rufous with pale
brownish edges ; wing- and tail-feathers, dusky brown with yellowish
edges, the two outermost tail-feathers with a white patch on the
inner web ; a moustachial line, the chin, and throat, dark rufous,
the feathers with pale edges; ear-coverts, pale brown; a white
triangular patch on the middle of the throat; breast and sides of
abdomen, rufous with pale edges to the feathers ; centre of abdomen,
vent, and lower tail-coverts, white, slightly streaked. This Bunting,
which on the Continent is known as the " Pine Bunting ", has been
freely imported as a cage-bird by dealers trading in Siberian and
Russian birds.

The members of the genus Mimus, although not brightly coloured,
are all attractive and graceful in their movements and forms. They are
all for the most part about the size of a European Thrush, but more
slender, have longish tails and vary in colouring from ash-grey to
ash-brown and blue-grey, with white bands on the wings, white on the
outer tail-feathers, and on the lower under parts, and whitish eye-stripes.
The legs are rather long and slender and the tails are swung from one
side to another, not infrequently, too, with a circular movement. The
wings are sometimes opened and closed in a butterfly manner. Mocking-
birds walk and run, but do not hop on the ground, and sometimes give
the appearance of very large Water-wagtails. They are difficult birds
to identify unless one is very well-up in all the species, of which there
are some seventeen in number, known to ornithology. I have certainly
possessed four species, which I believe to have been Mimus polyglottus,
M. triurus , M. saturninus, and M. gilvus.
The American Mocking-bird (M. polyglottus) is found in North
America up to 40 degrees North latitude, ranging into Mexico and
Central America in winter. It is the most commonly imported species
and, like the others, will thrive on a good insectile mixture, with fruits
in addition, and mealworms, etc. Mocking-birds are great bathers, and
if kept in a cage, it should be a roomy one of cane or wooden bars.
They are often shy at first, but in time become very tame.
The American Mocking-bird measures 10 inches in total length,

and nearly all are about 9 or 10 inches, except the Long-tailed, which
is 11*5.
The Jamaica Mocking-bird (M. orpheus) is smaller than the North
American species and is dark ashy-brown with blackish feathers on
wings and tail, a double band of white across the wings, and the cheeks
are pure white as well as the whole under surface, slightly washed with
ashy-brown. Total length, 9 inches. This bird is also found in Porto
Rico and San Domingo.
The White-banded Mocking-bird (M . triurus) is found in Pata-
gonia, Chili, and Bolivia. It is useless, except for scientific purposes,
to describe in detail the plumage of the Mocking-birds, but this species
is distinguished from others by being more rusty-brown in colour and
in having a broad white wing-patch running down the whole length of
the median feathers, and very conspicuous when the bird is flying, as
are the eight white outer tail-feathers.
The late W. H. Hudson in his work Birds of La Plata, writes in
ecstacies of the song of this species, and seems to be rather carried away
with regard to its superiority, " convinced that no other feathered
songster on the globe could compare with it," adding, " and in this
belief I was confirmed when, shortly after hearing it, I visited England,
and found of how much less account than this Patagonian bird,
which no poet has ever praised, were the sweetest of the famed melo-
dists of the Old World." I confess I think this is going too far, for
although the White-banded Mocking-bird is a very fluent songster,
unless the individual bird that I have kept is an inferior singer, his
song to my mind cannot compare in richness of tone to the Black-
bird's (Merula merula), or to the exquisite sweetness and rush of
melody of the Nightingale's.
The Mocking-bird's notes are hurried, and some are slightly grating,
recalling those of the Sedge-warbler, but I have not heard the bird
sing in his native woods as Mr. Hudson did. But the notes of the
Mocking-birds, although very charming and joyous, are uttered with a
continuous and rapid flow and are not divided into distinct and
beautiful stanzas ; at least, that is my experience.
The Graceful Mocking-bird (M . gilvus) is larger than some of the
other species. Total length 10&amp;apos;5 inches. I believe I have had this bird,

but unless one can examine a series of skins, it is difficult to determine
the exact species amongst some of them. The females in the Mocking-
birds have narrower heads and are generally slighter in form, but one
must have the two sexes together to distinguish them. M. gilvus is
more silvery in tone than some of the other species. It is found in
Central America, Yucatan, and Guatemala. It occurs in Colombia,
Venezuela, and Guiana, also inhabiting the islands of Trinidad, Tobago,
S. Vincent, Granada, and Santa Lucia.
The Blue-grey Mocking-bird (M. lividus). A native of Eastern
Brazil. I do not know whether it has ever been imported to Europe.
The general colour above is bluish-ash colour, with a broad eyebrow of
ashy-white. The whitish under parts have broad longitudinal blackish
streaks on the flanks. Length, nearly 10 inches.
M. saturninus, also an inhabitant of Brazil, is of a more rusty-brown
colour above and creamy buff on the throat, deepening to fulvous
below. Total length, 10 inches.
I deem it almost useless to attempt to describe any more of the
Mocking-birds (or Mocking-thrushes, as they are also called), but I may
add that the Long-tailed Mocking-bird (total length 11*5 inches) is
found from Ecuador to Peru.
The Paraguayan (M. modulator) inhabits Bolivia and Southern
Brazil, and there are others which I believe have never been imported.
It would be interesting to know whether any one species is normally
superior in song to all the rest, but I should suppose that the whole
genus ranks as the finest singing one of the New World, with the
exception of some of the Thrushes.
The Thrashers (Harporhynchus) are composed of some eleven
species, and are allied to the Mocking-birds. H. rufus is found in the
eastern province of North America up to Lake Winnipeg.
The size of a Mocking-bird, and of a bright rufous colour above ;
buff beneath, with triangular spots of brown, giving a thrush-like
appearance, but the spots run in lines, and the wing-coverts are tipped
with buff, forming two narrow bars. The bill is slightly curved and
the eye is yellow. The Brown Thrasher is timid and does not show
itself as does the American " Robin " (Turdus migratorius) and the
Cat-bird. It's song is loud and rich, and the bird sits on the top of a

tree to deliver it. The notes resemble those of the Mocking-bird, but
are inferior in beauty. Personally I do not particularly covet a
Thrasher as a cage or aviary bird.
Of the ten or eleven species, the largest proportion are found in the
south-western United States. They are, of course, insectivorous and
fructivorous.
The Blue Mocking-thrush (Melanotis ccerulescens) is another
species which is allied to the Mocking-birds, and classed under Timeliidce .
This one has a superficial likeness to the Blue Rock-thrush of Europe.
The general colour is slaty-blue ; the lores, feathers below the eye and
at the base of the bill being black. Total length, 11 inches.
It inhabits Mexico in the temperate region and is also found in the
Tres Marias Islands. I have kept this species, but never discovered
that it is anything of a songster. It is sometimes imported.
There is another, M. hypoleucus, in Guatemala, where it inhabits
the highlands from 3,000 to 7,000 feet above the sea. It must be a
handsomer bird than M. ccerulescens, for as well as being dark slaty-blue
above, the cheeks and under surface are pure white ; the flanks, thighs,
and under tail-coverts, slaty-blue. It is a rather smaller bird than
M. ccerulescens. It is known as the White-breasted Mocking-thrush.
The Black-headed Mocking-thrush (Donacobius atricapillus)
is another ally, confined to South America, where it is extensively
spread over Brazil, and is found in Guiana, Bolivia, Colombia, etc.
Total length, 8*2 inches. General colour above, dark chocolate-
brown ; lower back, reddish-brown. A large white patch on the wing.
Tail, black with broad white ends ; head and face, black ; under
surface, ochre-buff. Eyes, bright yellow.
The American Cat-bird ( Galeoscoptes carolinensis) is allied to
the Mocking-birds, and is distributed over North America in summer
as far as Lake Winnipeg ; in winter it goes to Central America, and
also to the Bahamas and Cuba.
Total length, 8*25 inches. General colour, dark, slaty-grey;
crown of head, black ; under tail-coverts, chestnut.
The Cat-bird is a great favourite in North America, and often takes
up its abode under the very windows of a farm-house, seeming to
prefer the vicinity of human habitations, and frequently nesting in

the shrubberies of city gardens. At the same time it does not come
into the open too much. It is called the Cat-bird on account of the
cat-like " meows " which are interspersed amongst its other notes,
and which detract from an otherwise sweet voice. The bird in captivity
should be fed like a Mocking-bird or Thrush, and is fond of fruits ;
but it is rarely imported now. It is a graceful bird.
West Inman Mocking-thrushes (Margarops). There are six
species of the genus, all of which are confined to the West Indian
Islands. They are all brownish, with mottled or spotted breasts.

Cirl Bunting (Emberiza cirlus)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.995170190476191" page_id="56200531"  page_num="129" year="" vol="">
A beautiful and fairly common bird in England, though said to be
rare in Belgium and Holland ; it is resident in Central and Southern
Europe, but in Southern Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor retires to the
mountains to breed. The olive black-streaked head with the two
broad yellow streaks above and below the eye and the yellow belt
across back of throat are sufficient to distinguish this species at a glance
from the far more abundant Yellow Bunting. I first took the eggs
of the Cirl Bunting in Kent in June, 1877, previous to which date
I believe it was not recorded as breeding in that county. The nesting
habits are similar to those of the Yellow Bunting, the nest roughly
formed externally of dead grass, bents, and vegetable fibre, compact
internally, and lined with fine fibre and black horsehair ; sometimes
it has been stated that a little moss is added, though I have not seen
this material in nests found by myself. The eggs number from four
to five, rarely the latter I think, are a trifle wider, and considerably
less varied than those of E. citrinella, being usually white streaked,
spotted, and dotted (especially towards the larger end) with purplish-
black ; the streaky markings often terminate in round blots, and
now and again some of them are chocolate, the shell-spots are lilacine-
grey, small, and often indistinct.
The song of the Cirl Bunting resembles that of the Yellow Bunting,

excepting for the absence of the terminal double note. In an aviary
it is not aggressive, though said rarely to sing and to be greedy. I
had one for about a year, and then it died from no discoverable cause.
Yellow Bunting (Emberiza citrinella)
This beautiful but common species is too generally known to need
description ; it varies a good deal as regards the amount of yellow
upon the head, those of North-West Kent being far more heavily
streaked than those from North Kent according to my experience.
The " Yellow Ammer ", as it is frequently called, is generally distributed
throughout the greater part of Europe ; it builds a loosely formed
nest of coarse straws, dead grasses, a few twigs, and sometimes dead
leaves, lined with fine grasses and horsehair; the eggs, from four
to five in number, vary both in shape, ground-tint, and markings
to an enormous extent, though the majority show the fine, irregular,
and often tangled lines of purplish-black which have earned for the
bird the popular name of " Scribbling-lark " ; unmarked white eggs
are rare, but I have come upon them twice, and my brother found a
sienna-reddish example which he gave to me.
The nest is usually placed low down in a hedge, or among short
scrub, in holes in the sides of banks or gravel-pits, but occasionally
4, 5, or exceptionally 7 feet above the ground. The species affects
open country, and the males may be seen here and there upon
the topmost twigs of hedges uttering their bright but monotonous
little song with its terminal double note throughout the breeding-
season ; this begins about the middle of April and certainly sometimes
continues to the end of August, for I have found the nest with fresh
eggs on the 12th of the latter month, so that doubtless at least three
broods may be reared in a year.
As an aviary bird I did not find the Yellow Bunting aggressive,
and I have no doubt that I could have bred it without trouble if its
nest had not been appropriated by a Hedge-Accentor.
Bed-headed Bunting (Emberiza luteola)
The trivial name is a bad one, as the crown is golden-sienna
indistinctly spotted with dusky grey, a broad dust-greyish streak
from above the eye to the back of the crown ; the lores, cheeks,

and ear-coverts, dark nut-brown, the chin, throat, and breast nut-
brown ; the fringes of the feathers ashy, excepting at the sides, where
they are more or less yellow; the mantle and back, yellowish-olive
with brownish streaks ; rump, yellower and without streaks ; primaries,
grey, narrowly fringed in front with yellowish ; coverts and secondaries,
black with broad pale brownish borders ; rectrices, smoky grey with
narrow paler edges ; abdomen and under tail-coverts, bright yellow,
some of the feathers with pale ashy fringes.
A specimen of this species was sent to me in the flesh for identifica-
tion in November, 1905, so that the above description probably
represents the winter plumage of the male ; it was said to have been
caught near Dover in 1900, so that it had been clearly for some years
in captivity ; it has frequently been imported ; as an accidental
straggler to our shores it is of interest. Other rare wanderers to Great
Britain are the Chinese race of Brandt's Siberian Bunting, the Bustic
Bunting, and the Little Bunting, but whether or not they have been
kept in cage or aviary I cannot be certain, though I think I have seen
the last-mentioned at a bird show. 1
Ortolan Bunting (Emberiza hortulana)
A summer migrant to Northern Europe and westwards through
Turkestan and Persia to Palestine and Asia Minor, chiefly passing
through the two last mentioned on migration, as is the case in Greece
and Italy, but a regular summer visitor to more Southern Europe ;
a few breed in North-West Africa, but most go southwards in the
autumn, probably wintering in West Africa ; others pass through
Egypt on migration and winter in Abyssinia ; a few also winter in
North-West India. A good many examples have been seen, captured
or shot in England and Scotland and one in Ireland, but it is quite
possible that some at least of these have been imported for food and
have escaped from poulterers' shops. Being rather an attractive
bird, with its noticeable yellow moustachial streak, chin, and throat,
it has also been sold as a cage-bird, though its song is monotonous,
and I found it aggressive and by no means a safe companion in an
aviary with smaller and weaker birds.

In its wild state the Ortolan nests in a slight hollow in the ground
amongst herbage, under bushes, or in the open fields, constructing
the usual Bunting nest and laying from four to six pretty eggs varying
in tint from pale lilac to rosy salmon, spotted and streaked chiefly
at the larger end with purplish-black, also with violet-greyish shell-
markings.
Lapland Bunting ( Calcarius lapponicus)
An inhabitant of the greater part of the circumpolar regions,
breeding only at considerable altitudes in Norway, but common in
Lapland and abundant in North Siberia ; in Asia it migrates southwards
to about 30* N. lat. in China ; it is rare in South Russia and North
Italy, accidental in Central Europe, but commoner farther north ;
in the autumn it occurs regularly on Heligoland ; it breeds in the far
north of America, wintering in South Carolina, Kansas, and Carolina.
It visits Great Britain on migration. This handsome bird is by no
means so freely imported as it deserves to be, since it is not
only charming in colouring, but confiding and said to have a melodious
though plaintive song. Its head, including the throat and breast,
are velvety-black ; a broad white superciliary stripe which encircles
the back of the ear-coverts, expanding as it reaches the black of the
throat; a broad chestnut belt across back of neck ; remainder of
upper surface blackish, the feathers bordered with tawny or with
creamy whitish ; but the primaries and tail-feathers dark brown with
narrow ashy margins, the two outer pairs of tail-feathers with dull
white elongated patches on the inner webs ; abdomen, white with
black streaks on the flanks ; beak, yellow tipped with black; feet,
blackish-brown ; iris, hazel. The female is paler without the defined
chestnut collar ; the feathers of the crown with chestnut margins ;
a whitish stripe down centre of head; ear-coverts, brown, partly
edged with blackish ; a black line running below the cheeks to the
upper throat, where the feathers are also black though partly concealed
by broad whitish borders ; cheeks and remainder of under-surface
creamy white.
Although the Lapland Bunting has been seen in Yorkshire as late
as the 11th May, it is not likely ever to have bred in this country in
a wild state.

Snow-bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis)
This bird is familiar enough, though it breeds chiefly beyond the
limit of forest growth in the Arctic regions or at higher regions further
south ; in the Faroe Islands and Shetlands it nests little above the
sea-level. In winter it migrates to Central Europe, South Russia,
Turkestan, North China, Japan, and North America as far south as
Georgia ; it is a rare winter visitor to Italy, and has been recorded as
visiting the Azores, Morocco, and Malta. It is chiefly a winter visitor
to Great Britain, but a few pairs remain to breed in Scotland.
Excepting after the autumn moult, when the feathers of the upper
surface, breast, and flanks are bordered with dull chestnut, and the
beak becomes orange-ochreous tipped with blackish, the male has
the mantle scapulars, inner secondaries, and distal half of primaries,
four central tail-feathers, and greater part of next pair black with
white borders ; outer tail-feathers, mostly white ; centre of lower
back and rump, black with white edges to the feathers ; remainder
of plumage, white ; beak and feet leaden black ; iris, dark hazel.
The female has all the black parts of the plumage greyer, with pale
edges to the feathers ; the head and neck mottled with blackish.
The nest is bulky, formed of twigs, dry grass, rootlets, and a little
moss, and lined with down, hair, and many feathers ; the eggs number
from four to eight, usually six to seven, and vary greatly both in size
and colouring, being either creamy, greyish, or greenish-white, spotted
and blotched with chocolate and sometimes streaked with blackish ;
the shell-markings are pale reddish-brown and lavender ; as usual
with these birds the markings are generally collected towards the
larger end.
The song is said to resemble that of the Lapland Bunting, and its
note of defiance is similar to that which terminates the songs of the
Brambling and Greenfinch. As a cage-bird it is said to be dull and
stupid, but in an aviary it would probably prove more interesting.
Rock Bunting (Fringillaria tahapisi)
Inhabits the Cape, northward to Nyassaland and the Victoria
Nyanza into Equatorial Africa and westward to Benguela and Gaboon.
This is a rarely imported bird, but nevertheless has been exhibited

at the Crystal Palace bird-show and probably elsewhere. On the upper
surface the prevailing colour is cinnamon-reddish with black centres
to the feathers, the tail-feathers blackish with huffish edges ; the
head black, interrupted on each side by about half a dozen white
stripes, the lowest separating the ear-coverts from the black of the
throat; prevailing colour of the under-surface pale reddish-brown ;
beak, brown, the lower mandible paler ; feet and irides, brown. The
female differs in its red-brown crown ; the stripes crossing the sides
of the face less distinct; the feathers of the throat with ashy-grey
tips.
Stark observes that he generally met with this Bunting on broken
hill-sides strewn with rocks and partly overgrown with low bushes ;
its habits are similar to those of the species of Emberiza, as it sings
from the top of a rock or low bush, builds its nest near to the ground
in a small bush, feeds upon seeds and insects ; it lays three greenish-
white eggs, spotted and blotched, often as a cap over the larger end,
with reddish-brown. The song is stated to be somewhat like that
of the Cape Bunting. Has bred in captivity.
Cape Bunting (Fringillaria capensis)
An inhabitant of the Cape Colony, ranging to the Transvaal and
Damaraland ; perhaps also to Angola. It frequents similar localities
to those occupied by the preceding species, has similar habits, is con-
fiding, sings its insignificant song--" zizi, zizi, zi "--from the top
of a rock, opening and shutting its wings at the same time ; it builds
a deep but flimsy cup-shaped nest of dry grass and rootlets scantily
lined with hair in a low bush near the ground or by the side of a rock,
and lays three or four greenish-white eggs, thickly spotted and
blotched with reddish-brown and yellow, often forming a cap over
the larger end.
The prevailing colour of this Bunting above is brown, broadly
streaked with black, excepting on the rump and upper tail-coverts ;
the latter have grey edges ; the lesser and median coverts are chestnut,
the latter with blackish centres ; greater coverts blackish with the
outer borders chestnut; flights, blackish, the primaries with greyish-
white edges ; secondaries, edged with chestnut; tail-feathers, blackish

with ashy edges, excepting the outermost, which has whitish edges
and a pale spot near the tip of the inner web ; head somewhat greyish
with a central grey streak ; a long clearly defined white superciliary
streak followed by a black streak above the lores and enclosing the
eye and joining a second black streak, which passes behind the ear-
coverts over the cheeks, the two being separated by a second white
streak from the gape over the lower part of the ear-coverts ; prevailing
colour of under parts white, the back of throat, breast, and sides
ashy, flanks with dusky streaks ; thighs, brown; flights below,
dusky ; axillaries and under wing-coverts, yellowish ; upper mandible
dull fleshy-brown, lower mandible paler ; feet, fleshy-brown ; irides,
dark brown. The female is larger, but with the wings and tail
shorter, as in many other birds; the white streaks on the face
less defined, otherwise similar to the male.
House Bunting ( Fringillaria saharce)
This confiding little bird in its nesting-habits much resembles
our House-sparrow, building a flimsy shallow nest generally in a hole
or crevice in a wall; it is composed of fine fibres and dry grasses,
lightly lined with horse and goat-hair, and occasionally with a little
wool (according to J. L. S. Whitaker) ; nidification commences before
the end of March, and the eggs, which usually number three or four,
resemble diminutive examples of those of the House-sparrow ; it also
feeds upon any scraps picked up in and about houses in addition to
seeds and insects. The song is said to be low and twittering, but at
times uttered more brightly and then distinctly pleasing. The late
Lord Lilford gave two specimens to the London Zoological Hardens
in 1892.
The prevailing colour of the male is cinnamon, dull on back and
rump, the former faintly striped with dark brown ; lesser coverts
bright cinnamon, rest of wing and tail-feathers dark brown with
cinnamon borders ; head, nape, throat, and front of breast, bluish-grey
striped with black ; under-surface, pale ; beak with brown upper
mandible, lower mandible yellow ; feet, pale yellowish-brown ; irides,
blackish-brown. Female duller and with the head and nape pale
sandy-brown. Inhabits South Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco.

Lark Bunting (Chondestes grammica)
A prettily marked bird and very abundant in tbe United States
from the eastern edge of the prairies to the Pacific States and southwards
to Mexico and Guatemala. Above it is pale ashy-brown, the mantle,
upper back, and scapulars with black centres to the feathers ; upper
tail-coverts faintly streaked with dusky, lesser wing-coverts with
ashy edges ; median coverts, blackish tipped with white, the inner
ones somewhat reddish ; greater coverts blackish, with brown edges
and white tips ; flights, blackish-brown with paler edges, those of the
secondaries reddish ; primaries marked with pale cinnamon at base of
outer web ; central tail-feathers, brown with paler edges ; the rest,
black, increasingly tipped with white ; the outermost feather white
along the outer web ; a broad, whitish central streak on the crown,
passing into ashy-brown on the nape, and bordered on each side by
a chestnut band streaked with black at the sides of the crown ; lores,
a broad superciliary streak, and the centre of eyelid whitish, a black
streak from the beak through the eye to the ear-coverts, and a second
encircling the ear-coverts and extending into the white cheeks ; a
broken black streak from below the cheeks bounding the sides of the
throat; under parts, white, a few black spots on the front of the neck ;
sides flanks, and thighs, under wing-coverts, and axillaries, ashy-
brown ; flights below, dusky with ashy inner edges ; beak, horn-
brown, bluish below ; feet, fleshy-whitish ; irides, brown. Female,
similar to the male, but with shorter wings and tail. It builds on the
ground, its nest being chiefly constructed of grass ; the eggs are white
with brown spots and hair-lines towards the larger end; the bird
frequents sparsely wooded districts.
White-shouldered Lark-bunting (Calamospiza bicolor)
A species acquired by the London Zoological Gardens in 1901 ;
it seems to be somewhat abnormal as a Bunting, inasmuch as it is
said to be one of the sweetest songsters of the prairie, and, although
it builds its nest in the grass, the eggs are described as of a beautiful
blue colour, sometimes with a few red spots. The male is sooty-black ;
a white belt including the outermost row of lesser wing-coverts and
the median coverts ; outer margins of flights and tail-feathers, white ;

sparsely spotted and streaked on breast and sides with black ; orbital
region, a faint streak above it and a crescent at back of ear-coverts,
whitish ; centre of throat almost unmarked, but a mottled black
streak at the sides separates it from the whitish crescentic streak.
Inhabits the interior plains of North America, large flocks collecting
together and spending most of their time on the ground.
Song-sparrows (Zonotrichia)
Why these and other New World Buntings are called Sparrows
is a puzzle, but it is more comprehensible than the application of that
title to the Australian Ploceid Diamond-finch.

<bodyText confidence="0.97632515" page_id="56200539"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
An inhabitant of Patagonia, and nearly related to the Chingolo
Song-sparrow ; it has not been frequently imported, but I had an
example brought to me in June, 1907, which unfortunately died during
the night following. It is said to build its nest in stone walls and under
roofs of houses, and its call-note is likened to that of our Yellow-
hammer. In addition to its superior size it may readily be distinguished
from Z. pileata by its unstriped crown and pale amber irides.
Chingolo Song-sparrow (Zonotrichia pileata)
A common and widely distributed species, its range extending
from Mexico to Panama and throughout South America to South
Brazil, Bolivia, and Chili. The male has the crown, nape, and cheeks
ash-grey longitudinally streaked with black, superciliary area rather
whiter ; sides and back of neck, liver-reddish ; back and wings, reddish-
brown, boldly streaked with black ; lower back and tail, smoky-

Aviculture
This pretty Bunting is most abundant in cultivated districts
inhabited by man, building its nest as a general rule in a depression
in the ground under a thistle or a tuft of grass ; it is almost entirely
constructed of horsehair, according to Hudson ; occasionally it builds
in a bush or on a stump several feet above the ground ; four or five
eggs are laid, of a pale blue colour, thickly spotted with dull lemon ; but
eggs deposited in captivity were white or cream-coloured, and the
nests were built well above the earth.
The song uttered from some slight elevation is short and of no
great merit. In the breeding-season this species is very pugnacious,
but both the bird and its habits must be familiar to most aviculturists.
White-eyebrowed Song-sparrow ( Zonotrichia leucophrys)
Ashy-brown above, more ashy on neck and mantle ; back and
mantle similar, but with chestnut centres to the feathers and ashy
margins ; lesser wing-coverts, ashy ; median and greater coverts,
blackish edged externally with pale brown and with white terminal
spot, the innermost greater coverts reddish externally ; lower back
and rump, brown, as also the upper tail-coverts and tail-feathers,
but with ashy edges, the outermost tail-feather paler and fringed
towards the tip with whitish ; crown with a broad central white streak
bounded on each side by a broad strip of black, united across the fore-
head ; a broad, superciliary white stripe extending to the nape and
bounded below by a narrow black stripe from above the lores and
behind the eye ; cheeks, ear-coverts, and sides of neck, ashy-grey,
as also the under-surface, but the chin and centre of abdomen whitish ;
flanks, brownish ; under tail-coverts, huffish ; thighs at back, dusky ;
beak, reddish-orange ; feet, pale brown ; irides, reddish-brown. The
female usually has " a narrower and greyer stripe on the crown, the
occipital portion and the supra-auricular stripe distinctly grey ",
according to Ridgway.
Inhabits North America, especially eastern, and rather northerly ;
west to the Rocky Mountains, north to Greenland, south to Cape
St. Lucas ; winters in Mexico (Sharpe). J. G. Cooper states that
it breeds abundantly in Labrador and the shores of Hudson's Bay.

grasses and lined with softer materials ; the eggs, four or five in number,
white, sparsely sprinkled with dark spots at the larger end.
More often seen in Zoological Gardens than in private collections,
but in 1904 Mr. Seth-Smith produced hybrids between this species
and Z. pileata. The song is loud, but short and melancholy.
White-throated Song-sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis)
Another North American species which occasionally wanders into
Europe. It breeds freely in the British provinces, and singly in North-
West Massachusetts. As usual, the nest is constructed of grass and
with a soft lining of hair, feathers, or wool; the eggs are probably
similar to those of allied species. It has been freely imported in the
past, but in all probability will be chiefly met with in Zoological Gardens
in the future.
The chestnut colouring of a considerable part of the upper surface
and the white cheeks and throat should be sufficient to distinguish
this bird from other imported Song-sparrows.
The following North American species are so unlikely to find their
way into private collections nowadays, owing to the stringent protective
laws now enforced in the United States, that it is of no use to do more
than mention their names, viz. :--The American Snow-bird (Junco
hiemalis), the Oregon Snow-bird ( Junco or eg onus), of which I had
a male example in the flesh sent to me for identification in 1902 (Snow-
birds sometimes found their way to our bird shows in those days),
the Chipping Sparrow ( Spizella socialis), Vesper Sparrow ( Pooecetes
gramineus), Sandwich Bunting (Passercuius sandwichensis) ; Manimbe
Seaside Sparrow (Ammodromus manimbe), Melodious Sparrow (Melo-
spizafasciata), Fox Sparrow (Passerella iliaca), Mexican Spotted Ground-
finch (Pipilo maculatus), and Black-throated Bunting (Spiza americana).
If any of our friends wish for information respecting the above
species they will find them fully described in vol. i of my Foreign
Birds for Gage and Aviary, pp. 125-30.

VARIATIONS OF HUNTING BY KESTRELS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990680933333334" page_id="56200542"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Frederick D. Welch, M.R.C.S.
In the Avicultural Magazine, 1923, p. 36,1 wrote, when recording
the case of a Kestrel attacking a Woodpigeon, these words in my
concluding remarks : " Kestrels do not ... by any means follow the
hover and drop method on all and every occasion when their prey
is birds, as sometimes happens." Perhaps it may interest people
who keep these birds to mention some cases which have come under
my notice here in Kent since 1911 which differed from the usual
" hover and drop " when hunting mice and such rodents.
The facts were noted down at the time of their occurrence in my
notebook in each case. Firstly, one day in June, 1914, 1 a Kestrel
flew down a Song Thrush after a pursuit of about 40 yards,
the chase being carried out at a level of about 4 to 5 feet from the
ground the whole way.
It clutched the Thrush by one foot round the throat (as proved
later) when flying at rapid pace ; and being unable to stop owing to
the speed it was going at, the Kestrel dashed into some wire netting
round a fowl run.
Presumably it partly stunned itself because it climbed with difficulty
up the netting, after coming into collision with it, and sat on the top
for some minutes holding the Thrush, which was apparently quite dead,
as shown by its complete stillness.
As it sat there, the Kestrel's toes could be seen gripping its prey
round the throat, the scene occurring during broad sunshine.
I approached within 15 feet of it before it completely recovered from
the shock of the collision and flew off to a tree to eat its prey.
This, it will be seen, was very different to the usual " hover and
drop " when hunting mammals.
Secondly, on 4th June, 1921, a Kestrel had been sitting for several
minutes on top of an upright wooden post which, with others, had been

driven into the ground and had wire netting nailed to it. Above it
were about thirteen to fifteen House Martins circling in flight, more
or less in a group, hunting after gnats and such pests. After eyeing them
for a few minutes, the Kestrel rose in flight and made straight for its
intended prey--which were above it, not below, as in hovering. But
the Martins flew so quickly and kept thwarting and baffling the pursuer
(by flying between it and the one of their companions which it was
at the moment chasing) that the Kestrel finally gave up the pursuit
after attempting, without success, to catch Martins.
This series of pursuits, high up in the air and made in different
directions, first after one Martin, then after another, then after a third
and so on, was a different sort of chase to the pursuit of the Thrush
afore described ; and also to the usual hunting of mice by hovering
(which it took to after leaving the Martins).
I may add that a Kestrel when in chase as described in the first case
can get up a much faster pace than most people would think possible
when watching the bird hovering or in ordinary flight; in the second
case, it failed (so it seemed to me) because it did not concentrate its
attack on one Martin and keep on after it, but kept changing from
one bird to others over a period of several minutes.
As regards the downward drop, one variation of it is that a Kestrel,
instead of completing the descent in one continuous course as is
most frequent, stays for a while when about half-way towards
its intended prey and remains hovering for several seconds--perhaps
as many as thirty--before it drops. This stop half-way would
seem to be used when the bird of prey cannot at the moment
locate the exact position of its victim owing to the grass being rather
long where it is hunting at the time.
In addition to the above two descents there is a third, which is
much more spectacular to watch, this being a slanting dash at a pace
which is much faster than either of the above drops.
It is performed like this. After hovering in the typical way, the
Kestrel (without any previous descent) suddenly lowers its head and
neck, at the same moment raising its tail and rump and at once comes
a rapid dash in which its course of descent makes an angle of about
45 degrees with the ground level, or perhaps less.

Date of Publication and Need for " Copy "
This slanting dash seems to be made when a mammal first tries
to conceal its presence in vegetation by hiding just under where
the Kestrel is, and then later tries to make a sudden rush to a hole
not many yards distant and so reach a safe place. In support of
this opinion, I may add that on one occasion, when seen by me quite
close, the Kestrel caught a small mammal when the latter was at a
rapid run. This slanting dash is, according to my experiences, used
by Kestrels much less frequently than the downward drop right
below where it hovers.
Personally, I doubt if it is ever used in hawking birds like Sparrows
and Greenfinches, which are its usual avine victims here, because in
all cases which have been seen at close quarters by me, the Kestrel, if
missing the bird at the end of a downward drop, always followed it up
and flew it down much like the first case mentioned in this article--
that is, if it attempted at all to pursue the bird further. Kestrels,
however, make frequent failures in attempting to drop on to small
birds --Cerchneis tinnunculus is by no means so skilful a hunter as the
Hobby Falcon (Falco subbuteo) according to my experience.

and up-to-date handbook. No attempt is made to describe plumage,
but a brief account is given of habits and distribution. The Portu-
guese names are mentioned as well as the English and the scientific.
The book is enlivened by one or two amusing little anecdotes and con-
tains a few photographs of the country and of the nesting haunts of
birds. In the chapter on migration, there is an interesting note of a

Correspondence
northern flight observed among migrating Turtle Doves in September.
Our only criticism is that on pages 104 and 132 the writer is guilty of
referring to the Black Redstart by the slipshod abbreviation " Black-
start ", which is singularly inappropriate considering the colour of the
bird's " start ", i.e. tail.
The Bird as a Diver --J. M. Dewar--is a decidedly original contribu-
tion to existing literature on ornithology. Had we been asked to write
a book of more than 160 pages on the diving of birds, we must confess
that we should have found the task a very difficult one. But the writer
has accomplished it, not by mere verbosity and " padding ", but by
the use of a surprising amount of scientific data, the result of accurate
observation, and much research conducted in a manner worthy of
The Ibis itself. It is indeed regrettable that owing to the limitations
of our powers of intercourse with the humbler forms of life the
information contained in the book cannot be made accessible to the birds

CAPT. RAT TIG AN'S ANSWER TO M. DECOUX
Sir, --I regret that in the April Magazine jive and a half pages of
valuable space, a larger portion of which might be devoted to that
object for which the Magazine exists, should be filled with a merely
argumentative discourse ; and, largely through inuendos, not always
courteous at that. Monsieur Decoux's letter showed a straightforward
wish to give facts as to the breeding and keeping of Waxbills, and a
clear explanation of what he meant by a cold glass house, etc.--I
know that no one in France or in England devotes more careful personal
and constant attention to his birds, and certainly no one is more
courteous and unready to blow his own trumpet. I cannot help reading
Capt. Rattigan as, " He who is convinced against his will, is of the same
opinion still." In any case, do we want pages of antagonistic and to me
utterly unnecessary argument written with uplifted hackles ? No

AEE CEETAIN SPECIES OF AUSTEALIAN PAEEAKEETS

Sir, --Culled from the 1924 April issue of The Emu, let me quote what
Mr. Edwin Ashby, M.B.O.U., etc., holds with regard to the idea that
such lovely species of the Neophemae such as Turquoisines, Scarlet-
breasted, etc., are not near extinction. After speaking of the Eock
Pebbler [Black-tailed Parrot] as still fairly numerous in the Loxton
district, South Australia, and ranging from there to the interior of
Western Australia, with an extension of many hundreds of miles
northwards in that state, he tells of how as one of a deputation that
waited on the Minister for Customs, re the export of native birds,
he wished " to emphasize the need of being careful not to mislead
either the public or the Government by statements unsupported by
sufficient data ". Mr. Ashby writes in The Emu as follows :---
" While during the last ten or twenty years statements have been
made to the effect that the Scarlet-chested, Turquoise, and Paradise
Parrots were probably approaching extinction, I have consistently
stated that, in my opinion, there was little ground for that conclusion,
for I believed that these birds had (for reasons to be discussed later--
viz. the march of humankind with cats, poison, bush-fires, etc.) left
the localities where observers had previously known them, and gone

what we call ' back That is, they had disappeared into the great
unpeopled spaces of this sparsely populated continent (Australia).
" Eecent records have somewhat endorsed this view. The trouble
is that workers in ornithology are limited in numbers, and the wide
unpeopled spaces of this continent are so vast that species that have
been driven back from the peopled districts are lost like a needle in a
haystack."
The data supplied in Part I of Mr. Ashby's paper respecting the
Orange-breasted Grass Parrakeet (Neophema chrysogaster) illustrates
this fact.
" Here a little Grass-parrot, evidently still numbering thousands,
was completely lost for thirty-three years, and again within a week
or so of the last observations, was as completely lost as before."
In the same issue of The Emu there is a very interesting note upon
the Queen Alexandra Parrakeet (Polytelis alexandrce). (N.B.--It is
referred to as the " Princess Parrot ". Why this abbreviation ?
Gould named it the Princess of Wales Parrot, and when that princess
became Queen, the species took her name once more, showing which
Princess of Wales it was called after.--H. D. A.)
Mr. F. Lawson Whitlock, R.A.O.U. (Western Australia), made a
journey in search of the Night Ground Parrot in 1923 in Central
Australia. At Oodnadatta, Miss Kunoth had a pair of Queen Alexandra
Parrakeets in an aviary, which had bred that season. In the wild state
Mr. Robert Buck, of Henbury, told Mr. Ashby that about ten years ago
this species bred near the Mission Station in hundreds, and that at one
time he had nearly fifty young in hand, some of those which could
not fly being placed at daybreak outside their cage, when the wild
parents came and fed them.
Mr. Buck said that he considered another visitation was about
due. Now supposing an explorer had seen those hundreds of this
beautiful species ten years ago, and had then returned to find none
there, he certainly would not have been justified in concluding that
the species has dwindled in numbers.
I confess that I am inclined to follow Mr. Ashby's opinion that the
Turquoisines and other species that are now so excessively rare, have
retreated ; and that whilst the needle is being looked for on the outside

FLESH-FOOD EATEN BY ROOKS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999148344827587" page_id="56200551"  page_num="147" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Arising out of the different statements made by Mr. E. 0. B.
Meade-Waldo on p. 74 and by Capt. Rattigan on pp. 243, 244 of the
Avicultural Magazine for 1923 on the subject as to whether the
Chough will eat flesh, some observations of my own about Rooks
eating flesh for food, when in wild state, may be of interest to
some members, because some people hold the opinion--clearly an
erroneous one, as shown hereafter--that Rooks never eat anything
except wireworms, various grubs and such like, besides vegetarian
food of various sorts such as seed potatoes, corn, etc.
Mr. Meade-Waldo, however, in his article on the Crow tribe states
that, " All are omnivorous but some are far more carnivorous than
others," when referring to true Crows of the genus Corvus, so he is
presumably of the opinion that Rooks will eat flesh, although not
actually stated to do so in that article.
As to my own experiences of Rooks, during the winter of 1921-2
I was reducing the numbers of Blackbirds here because they were
too numerous by far and doing great damage to fruit in summer;
and on several occasions got up early to have some shots at them
before daylight came on.
On one occasion I saw a bird on some pasture land and in the
indistinct atmosphere of early morn mistook it for a Blackbird and
fired, killing it outright.
But on going to remove the body I found, to my disgust, it was
a Song Thrush, a bird I never interfere with, because of their pleasant
voice and the good they do in killing snails, and therefore left it.
So the Thrush's body lay there ; and next morning several Rooks
began to peck about over the pasture land.
About midday one of them found the body and at once began
to caw, which noise brought five others quickly to the spot; and after

standing round the Thrush's body in a circle and cawing for about
a minute, they all six pulled the body to pieces and ate it, including
the bones, only leaving a few wing and tail quill feathers on the ground.
The proceeding clearly showed that Rooks will not hesitate to devour
a dead body.
As to living creatures killed by Rooks, when staying at Slinfold,
Sussex, in the spring of 1911, Rooks used often to come and kill young
chicks at a poultry farm, tearing open the body with their beaks and
take portions away to feed their young on. Several Rooks were shot
doing so, and seen later by me. They occasionally carried away a fowl's
egg--as they have also been seen to do in this village in Kent.

<bodyText confidence="0.993209428571429" page_id="56200553"  page_num="149" year="" vol="">
A rarely imported bird, inhabiting Brazil, Guiana, and Colombia,
the habits of which seem to be little known ; but two examples were
presented to the London Zoological Society in 1906, and it is quite
possible that others may be brought home from time to time. The
upper surface of the male is olive-yellowish with black-brown centres
to the feathers ; the margins of the inner secondaries somewhat ashy ;
rectrices blackish edged with olive-yellow, the two outer feathers
with a white patch at end of inner web ; crown, dull yellow ; orbital
region, yellow; ear-coverts, more olivaceous; cheeks and under-
surface, bright yellow, the lower throat, sides, flanks, under wing-
coverts, and axillaries, greenish-yellow ; flights below, dusky, with
ashy inner edges. The female is browner and has the whole upper
surface streaked with black; rump, paler and more olivaceous ;
wing-feathers with ashy borders ; sides of head, brown ; under-surface,
sulphur-yellow ; the throat whiter, the chest and flanks browner and
streaked with blackish.
Gay's Finch ( Phrygilus gayii)

the sides of ravines or abrupt hollows, covered with thick bush of
a seed-bearing nature, not on open stretches, but they are often
numerous in partially cleared localities where coppice has replaced

timber previously cut down or burnt. (See A. A. Lane in the Ibis,
1897, pp. 16, 17.) They are frequently kept in aviaries in their own
country, and therefore should be readily obtainable in Europe. On
the other hand, R. Crawshay says (Birds of Tierra Del Fuego, pp. 52-3):
" My first acquaintance with Gay's Finch was in the forest country
to the south of Useless Bay. A male pecking vigorously at a raw
sheep's head . . . The following morning I saw the female with her
head in a beef bone within a few yards of me, but could not bring myself
to kill her. In its first state of nature this handsome Finch inhabits
forest depths and outskirts. I have never seen it in open country.
It possesses an individuality entirely its own. It is friendly to man,
and frequents human habitations, where it subsists largely--if not
wholly--on refuse." Further on, however, he observes : " In the
stomachs of the male and female shot in the forest I found in one case
grass seeds and gravel, in the other gravel only." He describes the
song as " Cha-che-chi ; Cha-che-chi; che-chiP Neither Lane nor
Crawshay appear to have found the nest; it would, therefore, be an
interesting species to breed ; it has been exhibited at the London
Zoological Gardens. The head of the male is slate-grey, paler on
chin and throat; the back, orange-sienna, becoming yellower on the
rump ; upper tail-coverts (see Sharpe, " clear slate-grey ") ; median
and greater wing-coverts, slate-grey, other wing- and tail-feathers,
blackish with slate-grey outer margins ; under-surface, bright yellow,
slightly olivaceous below the throat; thighs, slate-grey ; under wing-
coverts white and axillaries pale yellow, both ashy at base ; flights
below, dusky with whitish inner edges ; under tail-coverts, white,
but the longer ones centred with slate-grey ; beak, lead-coloured ;
feet, dark brown ; irides, red. The female is paler, and according
to Crawshay's illustration has the throat whitish at the sides and
yellowish in the middle, with dark slate-coloured centres to the feathers,
the remaining feathers of the under-surface of the body with diffused
dusky greyish centres. Gay's Finch undoubtedly feeds upon grubs
as well as seeds and refuse. (See Proc. Zool. Soc., 1878, p. 432.)
Orchard Finch (Phrygilus fruticeti)

with pale grey edges ; median coverts, with the terminal half of the
outer web, white ; greater coverts tipped with white ; eyelids, white ;
forehead, lores, chin, throat, and breast, black ; centre of abdomen
and under tail-coverts, white, the latter slightly huffish; beak,
yellowish flesh-colour, feet browner ; irides, dark hazel. In the female
the head, neck, and back are dull grey, suffused with brownish and
streaked with dark brown ; scapulars, similar but edged with rufous ;
rump and upper tail-coverts paler than the back ; lesser wing-coverts,
grey ; median coverts, dark brown with the terminal half of outer
webs white ; greater coverts dusky, with buffish-grey edges and dull
white tips to outer webs ; flights, dull brown, the edges slightly ashy ;
tail, blackish-brown, the two central and outer feathers paler ; tips
and base of outer webs of the first four feathers whitish ; superciliary
stripe, lores, cheeks, chin, and throat whitish, with black bases to the
feathers ; ear-coverts, reddish ; malar stripe, breast, sides, and flanks,
dusky greyish-brown, finely streaked with brown ; the flanks and
under tail-coverts with huffish suffusion ; centre of breast and abdomen,
white ; beak, brown, paler on lower mandible ; feet, brownish flesh-
coloured ; irides, brown.
This species inhabits the Andes of Chili and Patagonia, ranging to
Peru and Bolivia. Hudson describes it as tuneful, graceful, and
buoyant in its movements. He says that when approached it utters
a series of low ticking sounds, and at intervals a peculiar long squealing
note ; its song is said to be agreeable, and is uttered while gliding
slowly downwards from an upward flight of ten or twenty yards :
it usually perches on a twig near the ground. Durnford found the
nest in the centre of a thick bush about a foot above the ground ;
it was neatly formed of the flowering tops of grasses, wool, and feathers,
and contained two pale-green eggs, thickly spotted and streaked with
dull chocolate. Seeds and doubtless insects, spiders, etc., form the food
of this Bunting.
Like many other Argentine birds the Orchard Finch is imported
from time to time, and is said to bear the journey well and do excellently
in captivity, so that there is something satisfactory about it in spite
of its sombre colouring : it has been exhibited at the London Zoological
Gardens.

Alaudine Finch (Phrygilus alaudinus)
This is another grey bird, the central feathers of its tail brown,
the beak yellowish-brown, the feet pale chrome-yellow, the irides dark
brown ; the female has the secondaries broadly bordered with buff
and pale reddish-brown ; tail, edged and tipped with silvery grey ;
cheeks, sides of neck, and breast pale buff, with narrow black streaks ;
lores, chin, and throat, paler ; rest of body below, white. I do not
think it necessary to describe it more fully. It inhabits the Andes of
Chili and Peru to Ecuador.
The Alaudine Finch is essentially a ground bird, frequenting corn-
and lucerne-fields, building its nest on the ground of coarse grass
lined with finer grass, in which it deposits four or five whitish eggs,
with brown markings, probably both in the form of spots and scribbled
lines, as they have been likened to eggs of our Yellow Bunting. It
has an undulating flight, which, apparently, is not long sustained.
The food, as usual, consists of seed and grubs ; it is imported from
time to time, and has appeared at the London Zoological Gardens.
Diuca Finch ( Diuca diuca)
Also grey, darker at sides of head ; wing- and tail-feathers, blackish
with grey edges ; outer tail-feathers with white tips ; chin, throat, and
middle of abdomen, white; the lower flanks and vent, rufescent ;
beak, leaden grey ; irides, hazel. The female is duller and browner.
It inhabits Chili and Western Argentina.
This Bunting frequents inhabited and cultivated districts, where
large flocks may be seen upon the ground feeding upon seeds of grasses ;
they also eat berries, and doubtless insects, spiders, etc. It builds
its large nest of roots, fibre, feathers, hair, etc., in trees or bushes
from three to eight feet from the ground, and lays from three to five
eggs of a greenish-white colour, spotted, splashed, and sometimes
scrawled over with brown or grey. According to A. A. Lane, incubation
lasts two and a half weeks or more, which seems an extraordinary
time when one considers that many Buntings hatch out in thirteen
days. As usual the nestlings are fed chiefly upon insect-food, at first
from the crop.

rather cowardly birds, but not spiteful; but Mr. Reginald Phillips
stated that he did not find the male to be a coward, but abominably
quarrelsome and vindictive. This Bunting was also bred in the London
Zoological Gardens in 1887.
The Nonpareil Group (Cyanospiza)
On account of their beautiful colouring, these birds are much
admired, and when imported find a ready sale.
The American Nonpareil (Cyanospiza ciris)
This beautiful bird, which looks somewhat like a small glorified
Chaffinch, with its crown, cheeks, and shoulders brigh t blue, its golden-
green back grading into orange on the rump and rufous or yellow
tail-coverts shading into green, and its bronzy wing-feathers and scarlet
under-surface, hardly needs a close description. The female, however,
differs in having the head green, the scarlet parts replaced by yellow,
and altogether it is rather duller. In captivity the scarlet of the male
is apt to gradually change to yellow, but by experiment I convinced
myself that if kept in a large sunny aviary and abundantly supplied
with insect food, this might be prevented, since one of my birds, after
losing all the scarlet from its plumage, so far recovered as to be con-
siderably suffused with red at the time of its death. It inhabits the
Southern States of North America, Cuba, the Bahamas, Cozumel,
neighbouring islands, and Central America to Panama.
This Nonpareil frequents small thickets and the cock bird, as is
the manner of Buntings, sings from the upper branches of a shrub or
bush ; it nests in orange-hedges, the lower branches of trees, brambles,
etc. The nest is formed of dry grass, caterpillar-silk, rootlets, and
hair ; the eggs are said to be pearly white, with blotches and spots
of purplish- and reddish-brown ; but the Rev. C. D. Farrar described
eggs laid in his aviary as sea-green, heavily blotched at the large end
with sienna-brown. I found the Nonpareil very confiding, readily
taking insects from my fingers, yet although I had at least two hens
at different times I never succeeded in breeding it. It is rather inclined
to be quarrelsome with other species of its genus.

Rainbow Bunting (Cyanospiza leclancheri)
A native of Western Mexico and exceedingly beautiful. General
colour above, cobalt-blue washed with dull green on mantle and upper
back ; lesser median coverts, bright blue ; greater wing-coverts, dusky,
but externally blue tinged with greenish ; other wing-feathers, blackish,
becoming greenish-blue externally, the primaries edged with whitish
towards the tips and the inner secondaries with yellowish at the tips ;
tail, pale greenish-blue, the feathers dusky internally ; crown, greenish-
yellow ; ear-coverts and sides of neck, cobalt-blue like the nape ;
cheeks and under-surface, golden-yellow, becoming bright orange on the
throat and breast; under wing-coverts, yellowish white ; edge of wing
and adjoining coverts, blue ; upper mandible, clear bluish (Mrs. Miller) ;
feet, brownish ; iris, brown (Sharpe). The female is much duller, olive-
greenish above, but rather brighter on the rump and with blue upper
tail-coverts and tail; head paler than the back ; lores and orbital ring,
yellow ; ear-coverts, dull blue ; sides of neck and nape, greenish-

grey ; cheeks and under-surface, yellow, rather deeper in tint on fore-
neck and chest.
Messrs. Sclater &amp; Salvin (Proc. Zool. Soc., 1870, p. 551) say that
" the female does not differ materially from the male, except that
the coloration of the plumage is of a less brilliant hue ".
Mr. C. W. Beebe, in his Two Bird-lovers in Mexico , observes :--
" These little Finches flitted through the underbrush in pairs, searching

for insects and seeds among the leaves or mounting to the top of a small
bush and giving voice to their joy in a little ditty, the attempt at which
was most to be admired, for the twittering ended in promise."
Mrs. R. L. Miller obtained a specimen of this bird in 1909, and our
Zoological Gardens received another three years later. Then in
1914 Miss Chawner wrote to the Avicultural Magazine about the
hardiness of a pair in her possession ; she describes them as " very
skulking, always preferring the thickest bush to sit in ". She adds :
" Both birds are usually lethargic in the daytime, but become lively
just before dusk."

to Mr. Beebe, is " common only along the edges of the barranca streams
and on the Colima trail, in company with flocks of Black-headed

J. C. Cooper says that in California " during the summer, there
is scarcely a thicket or grove in the more open portions of the State
uninhabited by one or more pairs of this beautiful species He
describes it as singing in all weathers, like other Buntings, from the
top of a bush or tree. The nest, of fibrous roots, strips of bark, and
grass, with a lining of vegetable down and hairs, is firmly fixed in the
forked branches of a bush three or four feet above the ground, and
contains four or five bluish-white eggs.
Although formerly a common cage-bird in the Western States of
North America, I am afraid that the present restrictive laws will render
its importation into Europe a rare occurrence.
Indigo Bunting (Cyanosjpiza cyanea)
This lovely blue species used to be frequently imported, and is
so well known that it seems hardly necessary to describe it; roughly
speaking, the upper surface behind the head is peacock-green, grading
into shining cobalt on the lower back and upper tail-coverts, the
inner secondaries partly brown internally; the outer secondaries
black-centred, but with broad outer and narrow inner rufous brown
borders, the flights blackish with greenish outer edges ; the tail blackish,
partly suffused with green on the borders of the feathers ; head all
round brilliant ultramarine, grading into smalt blue on breast and
abdomen, and into peacock-green at the sides ; lores, black ; wing-
and tail-feathers below, leaden-grey; beak, brownish-black, bluish
beneath ; legs, blackish ; irides, brown. There is not a particle of
indigo in the colouring of this bird, so that its popular name is absurd.
The female, immature birds, and the male in winter are brown, washed
on the shoulders, edges of larger feathers, and rump, with blue ; below,
whitish indistinctly streaked with dull buff. At various times I have
had three males, which died during the change from winter to summer
plumage, the colouring being perfectly intermediate in the feathers
themselves ; so that, apart from the fact that no moulted feathers
could be discovered, I was satisfied that the nuptial dress was not
acquired, as has been asserted, by shedding the winter feathers. I
left the most convincing example of this transitional colouring in the
hands of the late Sir William Flower, hoping that he would deposit

it in the National Collection, but unfortunately he appears to have
failed to do so.
A native of the Eastern United States, this bird ranges southwards
to Guatemala, Panama, etc. It is a confiding species, and I found
it quite peaceable towards birds smaller and weaker than itself ; its
song is of no great merit, but is not unmelodious. In its wild state
it is said to build in bushes, the nest being formed of coarse grass and
sedges, with a thick lining of hair ; the eggs are bluish or greenish-white,
sometimes with a sprinkling of red-brown spots at the larger end.
It has been crossed with the domesticated Canary, and the resulting
hybrids were green, as might have been expected ; I tried to produce
these hybrids, but failed, for, although they paired, the male bird
constantly pulled out the nest.
The Crested Black Bunting (Melophus melanicterus) is a bluish-
black bird with the wings and tail mostly cinnamon ; in the female
the bluish-black is replaced by dusky brown, with dark centres to the
feathers ; the lores and orbital region, whitish ; cheeks and under-
surface, dull ashy ; chin, yellowish-white ; under tail-coverts, rufescent,
the feathers black-centred. It inhabits India, South China, Upper
Burma, and Tenasserim, but appears to be rarely imported as a cage-
bird, though it was exhibited at the London Zoological Gardens as
long ago as 1873. It is, therefore, hardly worth while to say more
about it here* but I have published a full account in Foreign Birds for
Cage and Aviary, vol. i, pp. 119-20.

A rarely imported Argentine bird of considerable beauty, not
uncommon in its wild state ; it builds its nest in thickets of low scrub
in open country, and lays three or four white eggs dotted with brown.
I received three examples in 1893, and found them fairly confiding
and quite peaceable when associated with the commoner Pileated
Finch ; they hop about shuffling their wings, and frequently uttering
their little call --we two --from morning to night, and raising their
brilliant carmine crest whenever at all excited. The male is lake-
brown above, more crimson on the rump and upper tail-coverts ;

the crown black on the forehead and at the sides, the centre occupied
by a bright, satiny-carmine crest; eyelids, whitish ; the wings, dusky,
slightly olivaceous on the secondaries ; the tail, blackish, brownish
externally ; the under-surface, vinous lake, paler on throat and whitish
on base of cheeks and chin ; beak and feet, pale slate-grey ; upper
mandible, darker; irides, sepia-brown. The female is altogether
duller ; the greater part of the upper surface, including the crest, brown,
but the rump, upper tail-coverts, and under-surface, pale vinous,
shading into pale brownish on sides of head and neck and into whitish
on lores and chin. It inhabits the Argentine, Paraguay, Brazil,
Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.
Pileated Finch ( Coryphospingus pileatus)
Chiefly differs from the preceding species in the slate-grey colouring
of the upper surface, slightly brownish ear-coverts ; pearly-greyish
under surface, fading on chin, throat, centre of body below to almost
pure white ; under tail-coverts, white ; the crown, with its brilliant
carmine crest, is similar to that of C. cri status. The female is altogether
browner than the male and her crest is brown.
A native of Brazil to Venezuela and Colombia : its wild life doubtless
closely resembles that of C. cristatus. I have had four examples of
the species and found them charming.
The Cardinal Buntings ( Gubernatrix and Paroaria)
These have been so freely imported, and consequently are so
thoroughly well known, that it would be a work of supererogation to
describe them in detail. The so-called Green Cardinal (Gubernatrix
cristata) --the brilliant yellow of the under-surface in the male arresting
the eye rather than the green of its upper parts--is a delightful bird
and doubtless quite easy to breed providing that sufficient living
insect-food can be secured for feeding the young both in the nest
and for a fortnight after they leave it; this is where I failed, three
out of four young being thrown out of the nest by their parents and
the fourth (which would not help itself to soft food after it flew) died
shortly after it left the nest for lack of enough insects and spiders.
The Grey Cardinals--Yellow-billed (Paroaria capitata), Bed-headed
(P. larvata), and Bed-crested (P. cucullata) --are all familiar friends,

the first-mentioned being the least common and at one time a rarity-
in the bird-market. I imported a male in 1893, at which time the
late Mr. Abrahams told me that its market value was #3 ; but some
years later (1903) a dozen or more were brought over, and I purchased
four young specimens in various stages of development between the
juvenile and adult plumage ; by watching these carefully from day to
day I conclusively proved that the Brown-throated Cardinal (P.
cervicalis) was only an immature stage of P. capitata, the colouring of
the throat, beak, and feet gradually changing as the birds grew older ;
the slaty tinting of the upper mandible and of the tarsi entirely dis-
appearing in fully adult examples, but lasting slightly longer in some
individuals than in others.
From their readiness to build and the fact that I occasionally found
broken eggs on the ground, as also the fact that one Red-headed pair
produced fertile eggs before they died, I should judge that all these
birds might be readily bred in a large well-planted outdoor aviary ;
their songs are much alike, loud but very scroopy ; you can imitate
the sound by screwing round the lid on a round wooden box ; they
lay three or four white eggs, speckled, mottled, and streaked, especially
at the large end, with greyish or brownish-olive. They are all South
American birds and common in their native haunts.
I have little doubt that Dr. Sharpe was correct in his supposition
that the Virginian Cardinal and its near allies would prove when
dissected to be Buntings with Coccothraustine beaks ; however, that
remains to be seen.

Avicultural fever is the most insidious disease, and it seems to me
that the only institutions which might cure me are the bankruptcy
court or the workhouse. And matters have not been improved lately
by the purchase of seventeen volumes of the Avicultural Magazine.
What birds they kept in pre-war days ! Reading of them fairly
makes one's mouth water. My three aviaries ought to be twenty-three
for my needs and for the individual needs of all the birds I should
like to keep. Probably they could be subdivided into smaller compart-

ments with fewer birds in each, but I do like to see large flights naturally
and attractively laid out as small gardens, bringing the birds into the
garden landscape.
By the autumn it is true they look rather forlorn with worn turf and
shrubs stripped of leaves, but it is quite easy in the country to grow
on a fresh supply of evergreens and tall grasses in the reserve garden
and to lime the ground and lay fresh meadow turf each year.
The houses--except the Budgerigars' Aviary, which I do not include
here--are all warmed to a comfortable temperature. Possibly the
birds would live without heat, but I don't propose to ask them to.
A good many of us survived a winter or two of damp dug-outs and
wet trenches, but I for one found it a less comfortable existence than
warm rooms and a hot-water bottle, and I like to think my birds
are comfortable and happy.
Two aviaries are intended for breeding, and the third contains
odd birds that I either cannot get husbands or wives for, or wish to
have as single specimens for their interest and beauty.
Chief among the latter are a Long-tailed Boiler from South Africa.
A glorious medley of blues and mauves, he arrived in September,
and has been rather a responsibility through his long moult, which
is happily now almost completed. After some weeks of a rich diet
of mealworms and minced raw beef he seemed sluggish and droopy,
but I have since learnt that he must be made to cast pellets, and in
this we have now succeeded by rolling the meat in ants' eggs and
dried flies and chopped green food. I have never seen him drink,
so we give chopped grapes to supply moisture if he cares to eat them.
Boilers, like Bee-eaters, apparently capture all their food on the wing,
and we find that he will often eat morsels thrown to him--never by
any chance missing a catch--when he is too lazy to come down to the
table to feed. It would be interesting to hear how some others
imported at the same time are getting on.
My Black-necked Grackle (Graculipica nigricollis) I have written
of elsewhere. He talks almost the whole day now, drawing in his
breath in the most amusing way in the middle of a sentence. The
voice is the voice of my aviary girl exactly, but no one can tell what
he says.

A White Bell Bird is in perfect condition after his moult, but has
stopped calling since the cold weather came. It was very amusing
to see him jump right round on his branch when he wanted to make
an extra loud noise. It would be very interesting to try to breed
Bell Birds if one could only get both sexes. He and a Senegal Touracou
recently acquired threaten to cost a small fortune between them in
bananas. What a lovely creature this Touracou is, with his slim green
and purple body slipping through the branches, showing just an
occasional flash of scarlet when the wings are spread!
A young Bed-billed Toucan, caged off in an inner flight, is improving
weekly now in the condition of his black coat and white shirt, and is
absurdly tame and lovable. I find a number of people who came to
see the birds have never seen a Toucan, and some even confuse it with
a Pelican !
A Bengal Pitta (Pitta hrachyura) imported last May with a broken
leg is now as fit as possible, and very tame and attractive with his
white bobbing tail, but not altogether amiable. He has finally banished
from the floor a pair of Plumed Ground Doves (Lophophaps leucogaster)
which persecuted some Painted Quail, and the Doves now have to
live on some boards running the length of the aviary over the hot
water pipes. Here they march up and down like Guards' officers on
Wellington Barracks parade ground--the male is a fine little fellow*
bowing and cooing to you with his tail erect and spread whenever
you go near, but the female has always looked a bit humpy. Altogether
most attractive birds, but scarce in these days, and, I regret to add,
proportionately expensive.
Other odd birds are a Black-headed Sibia, Silver-eared Mesia,
Bed-breasted Marsh Bird, two Golden-fronted Fruitsuckers, said to
be a pair but, I fear, both males, and a Golden-eyed Babbler, which
so far from babbling never utters a sound, so I conclude is a female.
A very handsome Hangnest, canary yellow with black throat and back
and wings, I do not know the right name for : it is said to be a local
form of the common Icterus icterus, but its beak to me looks shorter
and not so sharp.
Of breeding pairs, besides the usual run of small Finches, which
no longer thrill me as they used to, one aviary contains Violet Tanagers,

the rarer Yellow Tanager (Calliste flava), a very pretty bird of old gold
and green--also Superb Fruit Pigeons (Ptilopus superbus), very
beautiful but sluggish in habit and I fear too fat, Diamond and Talpacoti
Doves, and some tiny Doves which I believe are either Picui or Pygmy,
but I am not sure which; they are grey with blue spots on the wing,
and the male's call is a short and musical " whup, whup ", rather
like a farm hand calling the cows home.
I lately bought some Tataupa Tinamous (Crypturus tataupa), two
males and a female, but one male got killed through an accident, so
unless these notes bring forth another male Tataupa from some member
who has one to spare we shall not be able to watch the interesting
polyandrous habits of this bird, already described by Mr. Seth-Smith
in this Magazine. It is a species which seems by no means common
nowadays, and it is more attractive than the larger Tinamous.
In the other aviary are pairs of Blue Tanagers, Virginian Cardinals,
Crimson-crowned Weavers, and Giant Whydahs, a young male which
did not come into colour last year and, I hope, two females :
anyhow, they have no orange wing-patches. I long to breed them, and
have provided patches of pampas grass and woodrush to tempt them.
A pair of Red-eared Bulbuls (Otocompsa jocosa) are great favourites
of mine. They seem to be the most amiable of Bulbuls, but the far-
famed song of the family appears to be mythical, and whenever I rush
up to London to buy Bulbuls I am always met by the wise restraining
advice of my good friend Mr. Bailey at the Zoo, " Nothing in 'em."
Perhaps, if we could get the Persian form of the White-eared Bulbul
which Dr. Butler tells us of in his book, we might give Bulbul concerts,
but meanwhile the Shamas--of which there are two males here--
have the monopoly of drawing large audiences, and they are such
engaging birds into the bargain that it is difficult to persuade the
family not to kill them with a surfeit of mealworms.
A pair of the very rare White-breasted Ground Doves (Phlogcenas
jobiensis) from Jobi Island, New Guinea, have come splendidly through
their moult, and are now perfect in shimmering bronzy purple with
white throats. The rather long pink legs of this bird makes it one
of the smartest and most attractive Pigeons I have seen. My pair
play a good deal round a nesting-basket, each time they alight on it

making a noise like a small claxon horn. Whether I am right in calling
them Ground Doves I don't know ; they never come to the ground
except to feed.
The collection is about completed with my Lilac-crowned Fruit
Pigeons (Ptilopus coronulatus), which presented us with a young one
last year--the first reared in captivity--and the old birds again look
like nesting. They are much more active birds than the larger Superb
Fruit Pigeons, and take advantage of every opportunity of a flight
out of doors.
Last year's bird is now in full adult plumage and a male, and
has only just been separated from his parents.
In conclusion, I must crave the indulgence of those members who,
being far more experienced in aviculture than myself, may find these
notes elementary and boring, but we are all exhorted to write somethin
for the Magazine, and this must be my excuse.

With the exception of the large and long-legged bird from Africa,
in the region of the White Nile River, which is known as the Shoebill
because of its large, broad beak, concave on side view, there do not seem
to the present writer to be any birds in the Heron tribe which are as
curious in appearance as the New World birds known as Boatbills,
the peculiarity of which also lies mostly in the beak.
In July, 1920, there arrived in the London Zoological Gardens five
young birds belonging to the Northern species of Boatbill, occurring
in Mexico and known as Canchroma zeledoni, there being also an adult
bird of the same species in the Gardens.
As already stated in the Avicultural Magazine for 1923, the
American Boatbills, whether of this or of the Brazilian species,
are dull-coloured birds, having nothing bright about their plumage;
but even though wanting in gaudy colours it seemed to the present
writer that any time to spare would be well spent in observing

the immature birds above mentioned, because alterations which
occur as birds grow older are interesting to watch--as also are
the actions of the young.
It may be not out of place to impress here on those people of
sentimental (or nonsensical!) views, who object to keeping any
live creature in captivity under good conditions, that changes of
plumage can be studied in live birds and much useful information
gained thereby in various genera and species ; besides, such information
is food, so to speak, for the human brain and it is always desirable
to acquire useful knowledge. Therefore, it is quite the proper thing that
such birds should be kept for observation by intelligent men and women.
The young birds of the Northern species were all healthy when seen
by the present writer a few weeks after arrival (at which time they would
be in bulk of body rather more than half of an adult bird), their good
health being shown by their appetites, their activity in movement, and
by the state of their plumage. As to appetites, these five immature Boat-
bills used to gulp so much of the dead fish which had been cut up into bits
into their mouths that the soft parts of their throats used to bulge out
conspicuously during the act of swallowing such food. This they did
without any discomfort when watched by me on so many occasions
that there seemed no doubt that these aberrant birds of the Heron tribe
could, when feeding in wild state, easily swallow any fish, frogs, or other
aquatic creature which they could get into the back part of their mouths.
In some birds, such as certain of the Kingfishers, which feed mostly, if
not completely on fish, individuals are at times found dead which seem
to have been choked by a fish getting firmly impacted in the throat,
the bird being unable to swallow such a large piece of food; this
has occurred in the British small species. 1 But as the throats of Boat-
bills were clearly capable of being severely stretched, as witnessed in
these above mentioned, there was nothing whatever about them to
suggest that individuals ever die through being choked by an impacted
fish or other aquatic creature.
After a meal all five Boatbills used to stand in a circle round
the edge of the small pond in their aviary, their heads all pointing

mentioned in the Field, 7th January, 1922.

towards the water, and remained in that position digesting their food
for several minutes ; and as these birds stood so, all quite quiet, their
reflections in the water made a pretty picture and one far better to
look at than dead birds mounted in a museum, however well stuffed
the latter may be.
As to activity in movements, on the ground they ran after one
another when any quarrel arose between two of them at a rather
slow pace, and gave me the impression that Boatbills, whether immature
or adult, could not run so fast in proportion to their size and length
of legs as the American White Egrets (Herodias egretta) and were,
when on the ground, less active in movement than most of the more
typical members of the Heron tribe, allowance being made, of
course, for difference in size when estimating activity. In flight
they seemed to me to be capable of going at about the same pace for
a short distance as the Ruff (Machetes pugnax) of Holland ; and when
these birds flew, they carried their legs hanging down, when seen by
me, not out behind.
As to voice, the only call I ever heard uttered by these birds
was a low grunting noise when they were excited just before their food
was brought, or during the scrambles which usually occurred between
the attempts of each one to get as much fish as possible. This noise
seemed undoubtedly a voice of pleasure, but being mostly nocturnal in
habits, Boatbills, whether of this or of the Brazilian species, C. cochlearia,
are presumably more inclined to call during the hours of darkness,
and therefore it would be of interest to know whether any member can
give information about loud cries made by Boatbills during the night.
These immature birds used to sleep in different positions, sometimes
on the ground standing on both legs, and sometimes standing on the
perch, or on the bough of a tree (in the Waders' aviary), which they can
easily grasp because the long front toes are unwebbed. Occasionally
they would roost on a perch standing on one leg only, the other leg drawn
and tucked up under them, similar to Ducks or Geese.
In colour of plumage they were rather dark, dull brown, nothing
gaudy about them, and they had no signs whatever of the plumes which
in later life hang from the crown of the head and fall down the back of
the neck. As they grew they became more of a lavender-grey colour on

the back, wings, and on the short tail, and the feathers on the crown
of the head darkened into bluish black, and cheeks, throat and breast
became of paler brown, as also did the brow.
By the 9th August, 1921, they had grown almost as large as the adult
bird mentioned at the beginning of this article, and the comparison in my
notebook reads : " In the adult the cheeks, throat and breast are paler
than in immatures, also the brow ; the bluish black on the crown is not
so deep in hue in immatures as in adults ; and the blackish grey along-
side of the breast anterior to the wings when folded, is beginning to
show in the immatures."
By 5th December, this blackish grey had increased and they were
much like adults, 23 inches long or thereabouts, with bluish black
plumes down the neck ; beak bluish black above, broad as in the
adult and about 2 5 inches long, as measured along the convex upper
surface of the upper mandible, iris dark and large, legs dull pinkish.
The Northern Boatbill looks its best, in my opinion, when in shallow
water, either standing still or walking slowly. In that position these
birds would make a nice photograph.

You may be interested to receive a few notes for the Avicultural
Magazine about my Abyssinian Weavers. As far as I can remember,
these four birds came to me about September, 1923. They were turned
into a small aviary, with log nests, tree branches, etc. They did not
look too strong, so I never showed them. Last May (1924) I found
one egg in a log nest, marked brown and very like a Cardinal's, but
larger. The hen sat well, but by some mischance the egg fell out and
was broken. I saw the male feeding the hen again, so I supplied
hay, wondering if they would make one of their own nests. All the
birds were busy carrying material to different places, but no Weavers'
nest was weaved. I only once saw a bird weaving, and then very
poorly as compared with the other little Weavers. The hen lined the
log nest again, and laid three eggs. She sat well for 14 days, and on
8th and 9th June, 1924, babies have arrived out of two eggs. They
are large chicks. She feeds herself and feeds them : either she has

Another hen has taken to another log. I cannot say if I have two
pairs, but rather think three hens and one male, but they all agree,
and each takes to a nesting place built by itself at night. I have seen
all try to sing, and in plumage I cannot see any marked difference
in the sexes.
I am only anxious about rearing the young, as I suppose they will
feed largely on live food. I can only try all sorts of food. Can you
or any member tell me if these Weavers have been bred before ? If
not, I shall hope for a breeding medal. I may be mistaken, but I
rather thought mine were the first importation, although several got
into the market later.
The Superb Starlings are building also; they are very busy
carrying and simply fill up baskets with hay until one cannot see the
hen as she sits. I do not know if there are eggs yet. The male is
singing well. Here, again, one cannot see the difference in the sexes--\0x25A0
at least, I cannot.
Has anyone a certain male Spix Macaw for sale ? My hen has
laid, and can offer a comfortable home to any good tempered husband.
She is most anxious to meet one, and meanwhile she can only worry
other Parrots and get them to comb her hair. At present her temper
is far from what it should be, but married bliss will alter this. Letters
only, please ; the flat is ready ! The egg was larger than a Parrot's.
Has anyone had a Spix lay before ?
In the next flat is the grand Eclectus. After being beaten at a show
she decided to take to herself a husband. " Mr. John " was a very
quiet lodger, living near. At last eyes were cast at each other, and
more than extra interest taken in each other. Mr. John began to
talk and laugh and entertain the lady across the way. At last an
understanding was arrived at, and a nice flat with bedroom was taken.
Mrs. Jummie arrived first to get things in order. Mr. John arrived,
quiet and fearful, but all eyes for the lovely one. It came bit by bit.
On the same perch ! Then a comb ! Then a kiss ! Then feeding!
and now a watchful, attentive husband always at the door of the
barrel, never inside. News may arrive later!
Scaley Lories lay, but do not sit well so far.

Blue Budgies are breeding freely; also Powder Blues as freely

Aviaries are started now of more Powder Blues, and there is a

Last spring, when I was staying with my friend Monsieur Jean
Delacour, at his charming place at Cleres, he received six of these lovely
birds, which were absolutely new to this country. I purchased two of
them and presented them to the London Zoo, where they were very much
admired and did splendidly. Mr. Chapman, of the Tottenham Court
Road, had a large consignment of these birds last March, and on my
return from India I purchased four, hoping to get one breeding pair
among them. I found them very difficult to sex, but took the birds
with the smaller heads and rather shorter bills for hens. About the
20th May I turned all four out in my aviary, which consists of a sheltered
room opening on to a large outdoor flight. I put up a lot of faggots
for the birds in the outside flight, as the newly planted shrubs did not
afford much cover for nesting. Indoors, I put up several nesting boxes
of different sizes. The four birds at once started carrying nesting material
into a large box with a big opening at the top, which was indoors. They
carried leaves, bits of string, wisps of hay and feathers, and all four birds
helped in the construction of the nest. After getting on amicably for
some days, I found three of the birds attacking the fourth unmercifully,
and had I not interfered he would certainly have been killed. As it
was, the poor bird was lying on his back, scarcely able to move. I
picked him up, and sprinkled some cold water on him, and he soon
revived, and is now as well as ever, but in a different aviary. The three

remaining birds kept going in and out of the nest box, so I looked in
one day, and was delighted to find three eggs. The birds hardly ever
seemed to be on the nest, and whenever I went to the aviary, which
was several times a day, I found all three birds in the outside flight.
Finding the birds so uninterested in the eggs, I thought I would throw
the eggs out, and let them start afresh, but on looking into the nest, I
found, to my delight, three young birds. All three birds fed the young
ones, and worked hard at it all day. I was lucky to be able to give them
a lot of fresh ants' eggs, which I got from my garden, and besides these
they were given gentles, earthworms, hard-boiled eggs, tiny pieces of
meat, and some insectivorous food. As mealworms were unobtainable
in the market, I managed to give them a few every day from some I had
in a breeding tin. The three birds were absolutely tame, and did not
mind my standing a couple of feet away from the nest and watching the
feeding operations. They would first kill the mealworms, and then
take between eight and ten at a time in their beaks, and feed the young,
and then come out for some more. I cannot say whether they fed the
young ones on anything else besides the few mealworms and the fresh
ants' eggs, of which I gave them an unlimited supply. When the young
were a fortnight old I noticed an offensive smell in the aviary, and on
looking into the nest I found one decomposed young Starling. I quickly
threw it out and was afraid the two others would die too in that awful
atmosphere. I was half expecting the Starlings to forsake their young
after my interference, but I was relieved to find that they did not mind
at all, and started feeding them the moment I removed the steps.
The two young birds left the nest exactly twenty-four days (4th July)
after they were hatched, and are as healthy and as strong as possible.
In colour they are the same as the adults, with the exception that the
bluish tinge on the back is black in the young, and the white of the
breast rather faint. They are almost as large as their parents. These birds
have been most spiteful to all the other birds in the aviary, and the
poor Dwarf Turtle Doves and the Tigrine Doves have been badly treated.
I still do not know the sexes of the birds, but think that there are two
cocks and one hen, and I am also curious to discover the sex of the fourth
bird, and the reason why he was so badly treated. I hope I am the first
to breed this beautiful Starling, especially as I brought the first pair to

Since the publication of volume xxiv of the Catalogue of Birds
in 1896, no collection has been made of the published references to
the birds of the Natural Order Charadriiformes, which includes the
Bustards, Snipe, Plover, and Wading Birds, and a catalogue of the
literature dealing with this order was much needed, as in fact it is
with many other orders, by the student of Ornithology. The com-
pilation of such a work involves endless patience and hard work,
and Dr. George Low is much to be congratulated on the completion
of a strenuous task in a most satisfactory manner. In his Literature
of the Charadriiformes from 1894 to 1924, he gives us a most complete
book of reference to everything that has been published within those
dates upon the subject, and to those who wish to study this group
of birds this book will prove invaluable.

The June number of British Birds contains a quaint account of
the Ruff, written in 1588. A certain Sir Henry Luse attempted to
keep three in his hall, but as he only " cast them corne to eat " it is
not surprising to learn that " they refused to taste of any meat and
so at length died There is a record of the occurrence of a Stork
in Essex last March, as well as notes on the appearance of other
interesting birds.

Sir, --If of interest to Miss Hutchinson, I may say that a pretty
and less common sight than others is that of Gulls perched on a tree.
In February, 1917, about twenty Common Gulls were feeding during
hard weather in a ploughed field near Fawkham, Kent, and
suddenly all rose in flight and perched on a tree with spreading branches,
remaining so for about a minute and a half--presumably scared when
on ground by the appearance of a fox or stoat. The Black-headed
Gull will, I believe, perch on a tree, but I cannot remember seeing
this myself.

Sir, --In the April and June issues of the Magazine of this year, tw&amp;apos;o
photographs were reproduced which were taken by Mr. Lienau in his
aviaries in Australia, all showing Honey-eaters and Flower-peckers
(Mistletoe Birds) feeding from the hand of their owner.
In one of the photographs, where five birds are seen, a Spinebill Honey-
eater is hovering in the right-hand corner (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris),
a White-naped Honey-eater in the right background (Melithrejptus
lunulatus), and in front of that bird is a Sanguineous Honey-eater
(Myzomela sanguinolenta ) drinking from the spoon, on the handle
of which is a Flower-pecker (Mistletoe Bird), whilst at the back again,
partly concealed by the spoon, is a Golden-tufted Honey-eater
(presumably Ptilotis auricomis). In photograph No. 2 (June), the two
birds eating persimmon on Mr. Lienau's hand are both Flower-peckers
(Dicceum hirundinaceum) . The Australian Honey-eaters are members
of a very large family ( Meliphagidce ), comprising nearly 80 species,
nearly all of which' are classed under the sub-family Meliphaginoe.
Several species have at times been imported to Europe, but they do
not seem to be long-lived in captivity.
Many, indeed most, are extremely pretty, with black and yellow
plumage, slender curved bills, and graceful movements. They are,
as can be seen from Mr. Lienau's photographs, which he most kindly
sent, capable of becoming very tame and confiding. Many Honey-

eaters are quite small birds, whilst others are as large as a Song Thrush.
In captivity they need a mixture such as is given to Sun-birds, and also
fruit, etc. Perhaps Mr. Lienau would give us a full account of his
mode of keeping them.
The Mistletoe Bird (Flower-pecker) is found all over Australia,
a tiny individual of 3- |inches. It has been kept in the Bird House
of the London Zoological Gardens. Mr. A. J. Campbell in his Nests
and Eggs of Australian Birds , describes it as a " shapely little creature,
in lustrous blue-black coat, strikingly relieved with a scarlet throat,
breast, and under tail-coverts ", the female being distinguished
by a buffy-brown throat and breast.
The nest somewhat resembles that of the European Long-tailed Tit.

The enclosed cutting from the Bee Journal has been sent by
Mr. Thomasset:--
An entirely new trouble developed in our apiary this winter,
and its full effect has only been ascertained since the hives have had
their spring overhaul. Attention during the winter was first drawn
to a number of hives that had their entrances attacked, chips and
splinters of wood laying around, and the cause was first ascribed to
rats. Metal guards were tacked over each entrance as a precaution,
with satisfactory results.- Some time later a new development was
noticed, as a large number of hives were found to have holes made
right through the sides of the hives, varying from a half-inch to three
inches in diameter. It was then discovered that several large Green
Woodpeckers were hard at work drilling holes (these hives were single-
walled Langstroth, though several W.B.C.'s also received attention),
and inserting their long tongues, which measure four or five inches in
length, were busily helping themselves. The slots cut in the sides
of the hives for finger-hold were selected as the first point of attack,
the wood being much thinner at this spot, the birds cleverly discovering

this weak point. Two of them were promptly shot, but three others
became so wary that some weeks elapsed before they were finally
disposed of. The number of holes, upon count, was about 250,
distributed over 100 hives. The effect of the tapping and drilling
of the Woodpeckers was firstly to frighten and disturb the bees, causing
them to ball their queen, as numbers of the hives were found to be
queenless ; also an excessive amount of stores were consumed, causing
a good deal of dysentery, weakening the hives, the whole result being
disastrous.
It would be interesting to know whether any other bee-keepers
have had any similar trouble. Unfortunately, none of the Wood-
peckers' crops were opened to ascertain whether it was the bees or
the honey that formed the attraction, though probably it was the
bees, these birds being insectivorous.

Sir, --When you obtain a pair of Macaws you expect them to " stay
put ", do you not ?
Three years ago, in Venezuela, I obtained a true pair of Blue and
Yellow, and at Trinidad picked up an odd Red. The male Blue (Kimla)
protected his shyer mate (Kate) from the Red's (Koko's) advances
until, scared by a shot, he fell from the observation tower, and we
feared his death. But no, after a time he recovered, and is alive
to-day, but paralytic in the legs. Kate at once mated up with Koko,
and no longer would she sit on your hand.
Two years later I obtained another Blue and Yellow and a Military,
who became pals, and an odd Green. This Green (Kiki) was and is
afraid, shy, and no fighter. She and crippled Kimla wintered together
in peace. She was the only one that would agree with him.

This spring, when I put them all out, I noticed that Kiki, for all her
retiring disposition, got on famously with the red bully, Koko. Hoping
to shunt her off on his roost and put some spunk in her, I entered
Kiki one night into the same compartment as Kate and Koko. In
a little while there was a terrible racket. Hushing out I encountered
a cloud of dust, and there was Kate in the middle of it, on the floor,
Koko, abetted by Kiki, was on the roost above looking over his fallen
wife. Kate now comes to one's hand and has taken up, after two
years, with her old pal and husband, the crippled Kimla.
Do Macaws believe in divorce ? I'll say they do.

By Dr. A. G. Butler
These birds are related to the Finches and Pipits, more nearly
resembling the latter than the former, but differing in having the
tarsi scaled at the back as well as at the front. With the exception
of the Shore Larks ( Otocorys ), they are not strikingly coloured, the
upper surface varying from sandy to greyish-brown with dark brown
centres to the feathers, the under-surface of the body paler, often white
in the centre, and with the sides more or less spotted or streaked with
blackish or brown.
Male larks are pugnacious birds, so that it is not safe to keep two
cock-birds in the same aviary ; in this respect they resemble their
relatives, the Pipits. They belong to a rather small family, of which,
I believe, less than a score have been imported as cage and aviary
birds, preference being naturally given to the best songsters. As
cage-birds Larks are very confiding, and they have the merit of singing
quite as well in captivity as when free. They are also easy to cater
for : their natural food consists of spiders, centipedes, insects in all
stages, seeds of weeds, and green food ; they therefore do well on any
good insectivorous food, living insects, or spiders when available,
a clovery turf or a little chickweed, and a teaspoonful of canary seed
daily.
The sexes are distinguished by the superior size of the male, with
broader chest and longer anterior primaries, the hinder claw is said
to be longer in this sex. I have not noted any sexual difference in the

outline of the bill, such as occurs in many Finches, but the generic
distinctions in the outline of this feature are quite remarkable.
Although all Larks are able to perch upon the branches of trees (I have
seen our Skylark roosting on a branch, though it more frequently
settles upon a wall, post, rail, or clipped hedge), these birds spend much
of their time upon the ground, upon which they run to and fro seeking
for food ; they do not wash, but cleanse their plumage by squatting
down and scattering dust or sand through their feathers. As a rule
they are vigorous fliers, the males soaring a good deal during the
breeding-season and capable of travelling enormous distances on
migration.
Although Larks may roost on trees in the day-time they pass
their nights upon the ground ; they build their nests in small depressions
at the roots of grass-tussocks or under small bushes. They are flimsy
structures, as a rule composed of dried glass and lined with finer grass,
horsehair, or thread ; but sometimes more compact nests of dry grass
and plant stems, lined wdth finer materials, are constructed.
The species of Melanocorypha are handsome, thick-billed birds
and good songsters : M. calandra, the so-called " Calandra Lark ",
inhabits Southern and Central Europe, the Mediterranean through
Persia to Central Asia and the Altai district, southwards to Northern
Afghanistan. In its habits it nearly resembles the European Skylark.
It is much prized as a cage-bird in Southern Europe, and at one time
many examples were imported into England, some of which quite
possibly may have escaped, and, being subsequently shot or captured,
they would naturally be included in the British list. M. calandra
lays four or five eggs similar to those of the Skylark, but larger.
The White-winged Lark (M. sibirica), a native of South-Eastern
Russia, whose range extends eastward through Central Asia to the
Jenesci, winters in Turkey and Italy ; it- has also occurred from time
to time in Great Britain, but whether it has been kept as a cage-bird
I cannot say. The allied Mongolian Lark (M. mongolica) certainly
has been, and about the year 1891 the late Mr. Abrahams gave me
a beautiful specimen which sang an exceedingly varied song, possibly
partly acquired by imitating the notes of other birds ; this song always
concluded with an exact reproduction of the mew of a cat, which would

be repeated if one mimicked the sound. The Mongolian Lark inhabits
Eastern Siberia to Northern China and Kokonoor. In its habits it
is not unlike our Skylark, soaring towards the sky in song, though
it also sings when flying near the ground or from a low elevation ;
the flight is rapid and undulating ; its eggs are said to be of a dirty
yellowish-white colour, spotted and lined with grey or pale brown.
A favourite Chinese cage-bird, this species is kept in a wicker cage
with a central wooden pedestal from which it sings ; the cage is too
confined for so large a bird, therefore I had a larger one constructed.
The Black Lark (Melanocoryjpha yeltoniensis) is an inhabitant of
Central Asia, ranging into S. Russia and sometimes further west-
ward : its occurrence on our coasts in a flock in January, 1907,
synchronized with the importation of a number of specimens which
were exposed for sale at Leadenhall Market, and may consequently
have escaped when near to our shores : doubtless many of the supposed
immigrants to this country have escaped from captivity. In the
neighbourhood of the docks, where bird-dealers are to be found, one
sometimes sees small tropical Finches among Sparrows in the road.
This bird first appeared at the London Zoological Gardens in 1876.
Our late member, Mr. Reginald Phillipps, purchased a pair in February,
1898, and in 1899 he succeeded in breeding the species ; he describes
the nest as deep with steep coffee-cup sides and the eggs as pale grey-
white, blotched all over with pale or grey-brown, more crowded on
the larger end, some eggs with darker and more decidedly brown
spots than others : I have no doubt that this is the natural colouring
for the eggs.
The Woodlark (Alauda arborea) is doubtless familiar to all our
members ; it is easily distinguished from the Skylark by its smaller
size, shorter tail, and broad buffish-white superciliary stripe. It
inhabits Southern Scandinavia, Russia below about 60* N. Lat., as
far east as the Ural Mountains, is common in North Germany, occurs
southwards in Central France down to the Mediterranean, the Black
and Caspian Seas. In winter it visits North Africa and Palestine.
In Great Britain it is local and not very common, occurring more
frequently in suitable localities in the southern counties of England
and Wales than in those farther north, in Scotland or Ireland. It

A viculture
chiefly affects sandy or chalky soil dotted with small woods, copses,
or plantations : as with other Larks, it nests in a depression in the
ground under a grass-tussock or small bush, building rather more
compactly than the Skylark, couch, or other grass, moss, with a lining
of finer grass and a little hair, or wholly of bents, the finer ones being
used for the lining. Four or five eggs are deposited, huffish or greenish-
white spotted with reddish-brown or brownish-lilac with greyer shell-
spots. The Woodlark is a charming songster, but my experience
is that it does not sing half so melodiously in captivity as when free.
The wild bird sings when soaring high up in wide circles, and I noted
that when it returned to the earth it did not drop after the manner of
the Skylark, but descended in a wide spiral.
The Skylark (Alauda arvensis) is common throughout Europe in
the summer, it breeds sparingly in Africa to the south as far as the slopes
of the Atlas Mountains ; in the east in Russia, Siberia, at high elevations
in Japan, the valley of the Amur, South-East Mongolia, Turkestan,
and Persia. It winters in China, North-West India, Afghanistan,
Persia, Asia Minor, Palestine, and Egypt, has been met with in Madeira,
and is said to have occurred in Greenland. It has been introduced
into the United States, New Zealand, and Australia. In Great Britain
it is abundant and, excepting in the extreme north, resident.
Being so widely distributed this species has naturally evolved
numerous climatic varieties, all of which have received distinctive
names, although they are linked together by many intergrades. As
a cage-bird it is altogether charming, singing equally well in captivity
as in freedom. I have had many examples, both hand-reared and
captured, and I noted that hand-reared birds, 1 unlike many other
species, sang the wild song instinctively. The nest and eggs are
too generally known to need description.
The Crested Lark (Galerita cristata) is a resident in Central and
Southern Europe, its range extending in Russia and Sweden up to
60* N. Lat. In North Africa it extends southward on the west coast
to Senegambia and the Niger and from Abyssinia eastwards through
1 I have known a hand-reared hen to sing as well as a cock bird, its crest
being erected during the performance.

Arabia and India to North China. From time to time specimens
have strayed to Great Britain.
The greyish-brown character of the plumage, with the less defined
dark centres to the feathers and the far more pronounced crest, will
alone serve to distinguish this species from the Skylark. It is a con-
fiding species, frequenting roads in order to peck in horse or mule
manure, or to scatter dust through its plumage ; also it may be seen
on the seashore running within a yard of the water. Various opinions
have been expressed regarding the merit of its song ; the general view
of it seems to be that it is rather a poor performance though melodious,
yet Jordon tells us that it is much esteemed by the Hindoos on account
of its song. When free the bird sings on the ground, from a bush, or
when soaring. This is not a gregarious bird, though very common ;
it is generally seen singly, in pairs, or family parties ; it nests in a
depression in the ground in or under a grass tussock or a clod of earth,
on a bank, wall, or the ridge of a low, thatched shed, dry grass and roots
being used : finer grass and hair are employed in lining the structure.
Four or five greyish or yellowish-white or greenish-grey eggs are
deposited, distinctly mottled or spotted with brown and violaceous
grey or " greyish yellow " and neutral tint.
The Short-toed Lark (Calandrella brachydactyla) inhabits Southern
Europe in summer, is resident in Spain, Portugal, the Canaries, and
North-West Africa. In winter it occurs in North-East Africa and
southwards to Abyssinia. Eastwards it breeds in Persia, Turkestan,
and North-West India. It is a rare straggler to Great Britain, and
one caught near Portsmouth was exhibited at the Crystal Palace in
1890.
The Clot-bey Lark (Rhamphocoryx clot-bey) is a sandy buff bird
with greyer nape, dark brown primaries, and white-tipped blackish
secondaries ; the central tail-feathers are reddish buff with brown
tips, remaining feathers white with broad blackish tips decreasing
in extent outwardly ; crown, indistinctly streaked with grey ; lores
and an ill-defined stripe over the eye, blackish ; ear-coverts and sides
of neck black, the former white in the centre ; chin, middle of throat,
and breast white, the last-mentioned densely spotted with black
which passes into a broad central stripe on the front of abdomen ;

lower abdomen and under tail-coverts white ; sides and flanks, vinous
buff; bill, bluish ; feet, white ; irides, dark brown. Female smaller,
paler, and with less black under-surface. An inhabitant of the deserts
of Libya and Algeria. According to Whitaker, this Lark not only
differs in appearance but in some of its habits from most other Larks,
frequenting as a rule rocky hillocks and broken undulating country
covered with a scanty scrub vegetation often hardly sufficient to
afford it shelter. In the spring it is usually seen in pairs, but in autumn
and winter in small flocks. The nest is placed in a depression in the
ground under a tussock of Halfa-grass or some other herbage, and is
surrounded by small stones ; it is firmly built of grasses and plant
stems and lined with finer materials ; three eggs are deposited of a
delicate apricot tint covered with rust red and rosy-violet markings.
The Bar-tailed Lark (Mirafra apiata) is a native of the Cape of
Good Hope : it is characterized by the dark brown upper surface
indistinctly barred with rufous and black, pale fawn eyebrow-stripe,
rufous ear-coverts, bright fawn under surface, the throat and chest
speckled with black. The female smaller than the male. It occurs
in open country and ground studded with bushes. According to
Layard it has a habit of rising from 15 to 30 feet in the air
perpendicularly, making a sharp cracking sound with its wings as it
rises, uttering a long shrill " phew " and then falling as abruptly to the
earth. Nidification doubtless is of the usual character ; the eggs
are said to be greyish yellow (whatever colour that may be), evenly
spotted with violet or rufous brown. It was bred in the Zoological
Gardens at Hamburg.
The Madras Bush Lark (Mirafra affinis) is an inhabitant of Ceylon
and Southern India ; its prevailing colour above is dark brown with
pale rufescent margins to the feathers, but less so on the lower back
and rump ; tail with the four central feathers pale brown, the others
much darker, but the two outermost with yellowish white on outer
webs ; superciliary stripe, buff-whitish ; ear-coverts, pale rufous with
dusky tips; under-surface huffish-white, the breast marked with
large oval brown spots ; bill and feet fleshy, varied with brown ;
iris, reddish- or yellowish-brown ; the female is, as usual, smaller and
with shorter wings.

This species frequents gardens and open ground more or less studded
with trees and bushes, open spots in the jungle, and the vicinity of
tanks, salt-water estuaries, and lagoons ; the male, during the breeding-
season, perches on the topmost branches of trees, from which it descends
singing its pleasing little song ; it does not soar after the manner of
our Skylark, but takes short upward flights, singing as it ascends
and descends after the manner of a Pipit. The nest is a loose structure
of grass and rootlets placed in a depression in the ground under a bush
or concealed under a tussock of grass or rushes ; the eggs number
from two to four, and are greenish-grey or greenish-white, spotted
all over with pale and dark brown spots and stains. This is not a
gregarious bird and is generally seen in pairs only.
The Thick-billed Lark (Calendula crassirostris) is a South African
species ; the prevailing colour of its plumage above is dark brown
with buff borders to the feathers, the lower back and rump greyer and
more uniform, the former with a few dark brown shaft-streaks ; wing-
coverts coloured more or less like the upper back ; flights, brown,
edged and tipped with buflish-white, the secondaries somewhat greyish ;
upper tail-coverts greyish-browm suffused with buffish, the longest
feathers with dark brown shaft-streaks ; tail-feathers dark brown
with grey edges, the two outermost feathers edged and tipped with
buffish ; head paler than the back with narrower shaft-streaks, nape
more fulvous ; margin of crown, lores, orbital feathers, and cheeks
buffish-white, the last-mentioned dotted with blackish ; ear-coverts,
dark brown streaked with buff ; under-surface dull yellowish-white
streaked and spotted with blackish, the flanks greyish-brown. Female
smaller and with shorter wings.
The Thick-billed Lark frequents flat or undulated grassy ground
sparsely dotted with bushes, rocky ground, and sometimes ploughed
fields ; as usual, it nests in a depression scratched in the soil under
a grass tuft; the nest is formed of dry grass and horsehair, and contains
four or five pale creamy eggs, more or less spotted and mottled with
various shades of purplish-brown and grey. The species is not
gregarious, and is usually seen in pairs. It was exhibited at the
London Zoological Gardens as long ago as 1867.

buff on the upper surface ; upper tail-coverts more cinnamon ; wing-
feathers, excepting the two outer primaries, edged with reddish-buff ;
tail brown, the feathers edged externally with reddish-buff, the two
outermost feathers with their outer webs of this colour ; sides of head,
excepting the ear-coverts, upper neck, and throat, white ; body below
otherwise sandy-buff, paler on abdomen ; lower throat with a few
brownish spots, bill and feet, dull flesh coloured. Female slightly
smaller. Eanges from Palestine to Egypt, Nubia, and Abyssinia.
It frequents caravan tracks in the desert and the neighbourhood of
cultivated land, feeding like other Larks on seeds of weeds, cereals,
and insects, and is usually seen in pairs. Its song is insignificant. As
usual, it builds its nest in a depression in the ground under the shelter
of a grass tussock or stone, and lays four ashy cream-coloured eggs
marked with brown and indistinctly with purplish-grey. A rarely
imported cage-bird.
The White-headed Bullfinch Lark (Pyrrhulauda verticalis) is a native
of South Africa, ranging on the east to the Transvaal and on the west
to the Congo. The male is ashy-grey mottled with brown above ;
the wing-feathers, brown edged with grey ; the central tail-feathers,
pale brown edged with white ; the others, dark brown edged with
grey like the flights, excepting the outermost feather which is white
with a brown patch at base of inner web ; crown, black with white
spot; ear-coverts and nape, white, bordered behind by a black collar
round the neck ; lores, front of cheeks, and under-surface, blackish-
brown ; bill, horn-coloured ; feet, dark flesh coloured ; irides, dark
brown ; female with huffish eyebrow and lores ; under-surface, white
tinged with rufous.
According to Andersson (vide Shelley's Birds of Africa, vol. iii, p. 84):
" This species is pretty commonly diffused over Damara and Great
Namaqualand, especially in the latter country, and I generally observed
it abundant in the rainy season at Otjimbinque during my residence
there. It congregates in large flocks, and is always foun^ on the
ground, unless disturbed, when it flies but a short distance before it
again alights, scattering widely amongst the grass in search of its food,
which consists almost entirely of seeds. Its flight is undulating, and
occasionally an individual may be seen to soar above the rest, descending

again very abruptly ; it may sometimes be heard to utter a shrill,
chirping cry." Sir Andrew Smith gives a somewhat similar account
of the species. In the breeding-season the flocks break up into pairs ;
they build their nests of dry grass and sometimes a few horsehairs in
a slight hollow in the earth at the side of a tuft of grass and lay two
or three pale, cream-coloured or dull white eggs, rather densely spotted
all over with two shades of pale umber brown.
This Lark was exhibited in the London Zoological Gardens as long
ago as 1873.
White-cheeked Bullfinch Lark (Pyrrhulauda leucotis). --Another
South African species, which ranges to Damaraland on the west and over
the eastern half of tropical Africa. The male has the upper back
cinnamon with buff edges to some of the feathers ; lower back and
upper tail-coverts, buff with slightly ashy centres to the feathers ;
median and greater coverts, cinnamon with broad buffy edges ; flights
dusky brown with rufous edges, broadest on inner secondaries ; tail-
feathers, blackish-brown ; the centre ones with pale rufous inner edges,
the outer ones dusky whitish on outer webs and towards the tips ;
head and neck, black ; ear-coverts and a band across nape, white ;
under-surface, black ; a patch of white and chestnut at sides of lower
throat; flanks and thighs, whitish ; bill, ashy white ; feet, ashy ;
irides, hazel. The female has no black on the head ; her ear-coverts
are streaked with buff and her under-surface is buff mottled with
black down throat and centre of breast.
This Lark is said to be very similar in its habits to the preceding,
but occurs more often among dwarf bushes, whereas P. verticalis keeps
fco more open country. It feeds chiefly upon grass-seed, and, according
to Boyd-Alexander, " frequents flat portions of stony ground. In
the breeding-season the male sings on the wing, rising vertically up
from the ground, and descending to earth again with hardly a beat of
the wings. The call-note, uttered on the ground, is a ventriloquial
pipe." Blanford met with the species in the sandy deserts between
the forests in the Gazelle Biver district, usually in parties of three to
six on the barren soil, but never far from water. Witherby found
a nest above Khartoum in a small scooped-out hollow in the caked
mud amongst very short, burnt-up grass near the river : it was sheltered

by a large lump of mud and with a compact and neatly arranged
layer of particles of mud round the cup. It contained one egg of which,
apparently, he failed to take a description. The species has been
exhibited at various Zoological Gardens.
The Shore Larks, with which I propose to conclude my account of
this little family, are the most attractively coloured of all and distinctive
in their possession of two erectile horn-like tufts at the sides of the
crown ; for this reason, perhaps, they have not infrequently been
exhibited at bird shows : their food is similar to that of other Larks,
so that the same treatment should be meted out to them in captivity.
The European Shore Lark (Otocorys alpestris) breeds within the
Arctic Circle and passes through the greater part of Europe on migration;
it appears in the British Islands in autumn and winter, and sometimes
even in early spring. The general colouring of the upper surface is
vinaceous brown, the wing-coverts tipped with white ; flights, smoky
brown, the first primary white externally, the others with ashy margins ;
back, greyish-brown, the feathers black-centred ; two central tail-
feathers similarly coloured, but the remainder black, the outer feather
with the outer web white-margined ; the forehead, a stripe partly
encircling the eye and ear-coverts, extending over the sides of the
neck and joining a gular patch, creamy white ; front of crown, an
erectile tuft on each side of the crown, the lores, cheeks, and a belt
across lower throat and breast, black ; ear-coverts, creamy tipped with
brown ; under parts beyond breast-belt, creamy white, vinous on
hind-breast, flanks, and thighs, the flanks streaked with brown ; bill
and feet, black ; irides, dark brown. The female is smaller, duller,
with less black and no erectile tufts on the head, but with dark centres
to all the feathers of the upper parts.
This species inhabits the dry sandy plains and rocky hills of the
tundras during the summer, only approaching the rivers to drink.
Its food and manner of nesting are the same as in other Larks, the nest
being formed, in a slight depression in the ground or among stones,
of dead grasses, bents, etc., and lined with willow down and reindeer
hair ; the eggs number from four to five, and resemble those of the
common Skylark, excepting in their more olive tint. The song is
short but melodious, and is uttered sometimes on the ground, but more

frequently when soaring, when its brevity is atoned for by repetition.
It has often been kept in captivity and exhibited at bird shows, as
previously stated.
The White-bellied Shore Lark (Otocorys chrysoloema) is a geographical
representative of the European species, differing in its inferior size,
generally more ruddy colour, and yellow throat. The female is smaller
than the male and has shorter wings. It occurs on the tablelands
of Mexico, extending northwards to southern New Mexico and Arizona
and westwards across Southern California to the coast. In the autumn
it becomes gregarious, and frequents bare plains or prairies, sometimes
in considerable numbers. In its food and nidification it resembles
other Larks, the nest being found in a depression in the ground, of
grass, sometimes lined with hair and containing two to four (sometimes
five) eggs of a bluish-white colour nearly covered with darker spots.
The song is said to be sweet and varied, and uttered by the male while
soaring to a great height and flying in an irregular circle.
The Algerian Shore Lark (Otocorys bilopha) inhabits Algeria and
Arabia and is said to occur in the south of Spain. Its upper surface
is bright sandy rufous with a vinous tinge, some of the dorsal feathers
with darker shaft-streaks ; inner webs of primaries blackish-brown,
the outer web of the outermost feather white, the others reddish ;
tail-feathers black, excepting the central feathers, which are reddish
and the outermost pair, which have white outer webs ; forehead and
eyebrow, white ; a broad black band across the front of the crown
sometimes with a white band behind it; long black ear-tufts above
the ear-coverts extended to the sides of the nape ; a black patch on
the sides of the face extending down the centre of the cheeks ; hinder
ear-coverts, sides of neck, remainder of cheeks and throat, white,
but a broad black crescentic band on lower throat; rest of under-
surface white, with the sides of breast vinous sandy and the sides of
body and thighs vinaceous ; bill, dusky horn-colour ; under mandible
and feet, paler. Like the other Shore Larks this is chiefly a ground-
bird, frequenting mostly rocky plateaux and stony plains dotted with
dwarf shrubs and low-growing plants at the roots of which, during the
breeding-season, it places its nest; this is neatly constructed of plant
stems and grasses, lined with a little wool and pieces of linen and

surrounded by small stones ; two to three creamy or pinky-white
sometimes bluish- or greenish-white eggs are laid, spotted with brick-
brown and with violet shell-spots ; some eggs have a clouded or marbled
appearance. After the breeding-season this species is gregarious
and less confiding. The song is described by Dodson as " rather bright
and pleasant though disconnected ". When soaring the bird flies in
curves, as I have seen our Wood Lark do, and probably in the same
manner as 0. chrysoloema. Five examples of this species were obtained
by the London Zoological Society in 1889.
I have not given a separate account of 0. alpestris, which occurs
in the northern portions of the Old and New Worlds and breeds within
the Arctic Circle, since Dr. Sharpe regarded it as only subspecifically
distinct from 0. chrysoloema , and it is not well-known as a cage-bird

While wandering through Mexican wilds no man has had a more
genial and kindly companion than the writer had : my nephew took
me in his automobile over 500 miles, and was a great help to me in
the study of bird life in my Mexican rambles. Our journeys were
often through charming scenery and one can only give a mere outline
of the wonderful bird life found there.
We had quite a number of Stellars' Jays (local name, Long-crested
Jay) near the ranch house. I have watched these beautifully marked
birds stealing maize from the fowls' run or fighting with the pigs for
food ; in the fall they come in large flocks and become rather a nuisance.
Both the Arizona Green Jay and Clark's Nutcracker are found here,
birds with beautiful plumage.
The Saw-whet Owl is often heard at midnight uttering its shrill
rasping noise. I sat up till quite late one night watching for this pretty
little Owl from my bedroom window. A full moon in a lovely southern
sky, as light as day. I could hear the call, sometimes near and then

further away. Next morning, when I told my friends, they were amused
when I told them I had not seen the little Owl: they informed me
what I heard, although like the call of the Saw-whet Owl, was from
a large male frog ; this I afterwards found correct. I found a nest
of the Blue-grey Gnat-catcher built in the middle of a cactus-tree :
it was almost completed, a very beautiful nest. I went again a few
days afterwards hoping to find eggs, when I found quite a tragedy
had taken place. The little bird had found a piece of cotton at the
Mexican herder's camp close by. It had woven one end into the
nest, and the other end was entangled around its foot, and I found
its little dried body hanging from the nest.
The American Robin (which is really a Thrush, Turdus migratorius) :
I found a nest near the house, with only one young one. I presume
the others had been taken by wild cats. I wanted to bring the nest
home, so made a new nest. My naturalist cowboy climbed the tree,
and when he came to the nest the young one fluttered out. I caught
it, it began to scream, and the old ones who had been watching us began
to scream also and darted at my head, pecking my cap. I found it
necessary to protect my face with my other hand. We put the young
one into its new nest, and it soon afterwards disappeared in some
trees further away. The first pair of Robins I saw was at Staten
Island, New York, at the end of March ; this nest with young was in
May. I saw a number of Robins building in a tree near Niagara Falls,
Canada, in July.
A number of Kill-deer Plovers (with their plaintive cry, " kildee ")
with American Golden Plovers and Clapper Rails frequented our
small lake near the house ; also the pretty Spotted Sandpiper, locally
known as Sand-lark, Sand-snipe, and Peet-weet.
American Warblers include more than one hundred species, Some
of the most beautiful are the Hooded Warbler, black and yellow and
brightly coloured head; Western Yellow-throat; Golden Swamp
Warbler ; Orange-crowned ; Myrtle ; Nashville ; Golden-winged and
Black-throated Blue Warbler. Many beautiful Orioles I found on
the ranch, and quite a number of the twenty-five species of American
Woodpeckers.
Many other beautiful birds are to be found, including the Western

Blue Grosbeak, Bed-breasted Sap-sucker, Mexican Mot-mot, Cat-
bird, Tufted Titmouse, Yellow-beaded Busk Tit, Logger-head Shrike,
Black-headed Grosbeak and the Black-billed Cuckoo, locally called
the Rain Dove.
That strange bird, the Road Runner, I met with on the western
slopes of the Rocky Mountains. I usually saw several pairs of these
birds on the road to Silver City, searching for small snakes and lizards,
usually in company with the pretty cotton-tail rabbit. In the stomach
of one of these birds was found a garter snake fully 20 inches
long. The local names in New Mexico are Road Runner, Lizard Bird,
and Snake-killer. The nestlings, when disturbed, make a clicking
noise with their bills. When taken young they are readily tamed,
soon becoming attached to their captor, showing a great deal of sagacity,
and making amusing and interesting pets.
While staying at the ranch we made a trip to the Gila River
(pronounced Caly River). We went in search of the Gila River
Monster (Heloderma suspectum) , a large, poisonous, and curious lizard
about 2 feet long, the body covered with wart-like skin brightly
coloured in orange and black. The Gila is a wide river : we found it
partly dried up with many sandbanks. We were unsuccessful in
finding this lizard, but found a very pretty black and white skunk on
the banks of the river. Many birds with bright plumage are found
here. It was very delightful camping on the banks of the river under
some very large trees overhanging the river, on which a number of
Orioles (the Audubon Oriole)--a bird yellow, orange, and black--
had built their nests high up in the branches over the water. The
Mexicans capture these birds and offer them for sale, and many others.
No alligators are found near here ; in Southern Mexico some very
large ones are found. I have a photo of one killed there that measured
18 feet in length.
Many migratory birds from the middle-west and other States
pass the winter in Mexico, Panama, and South Columbia ; others in
the West Indies. One of the most wonderful instances of bird migration
is that of the tiny Flame-breasted Humming Bird ( Selsaphorus rufus).
This diminutive bird, scarcely 2 inches long, flies twice a year the
long distance of 3,000 miles.

The Yellow Warbler (local name, Mexican Canary) is very numerous
in Mexico, also in the parched valleys of Arizona and California.
Another very striking looking bird when seen in flocks, with bright
red breast, is the De Filippi's Meadow-starling, found in the south.
Some twenty years ago I had three dozen males of this Starling ; since
then I have scarcely seen this bird in the market, until a few weeks
since I saw a cage of very fine birds at Chapman's.
In the south are found some very beautiful and interesting birds
seldom if ever imported : four species of the family of the Ampelidse
or Chatterer, most showy and beautiful birds ; the Golden-winged
Manakin (Pipra chrysoptera), a very pretty bird, its plumage being
brightly mottled with black, yellow, and orange ; still further south is
found the largest and most showy of all the Manakins, the Cock of
the Bock (Rupicola aurantia) ; another, a singular and beautiful bird
with a remarkable crest, is the King Tody (Muscivora regia).
The Olive-backed Thrush (often called the Swamp Robin) is found
in great numbers in the Rocky Mountains, especially during migration,
its winter home being the Gulf States, Cuba, and Central America.
One bird I was very anxious to meet with in its native haunts,
the Quesal, the native name of the Resplendent Trogon (Pharomacrus
mocrimo). Of the five Trogons found in Central and South America
and in the West Indies, this bird is the most notable for the brilliancy
and softness of its plumage. There are few birds which will excite
more admiration than does the Resplendent Trogon with its golden
green plumage and long tail-feathers. On my long journey I only
met with one white man who had ever seen this bird alive. He was
butterfly collecting on one of the mountain ranges in Costa Rica.
Being very tired, and a very hot day, he sat down and fell asleep.
After some time he was awakened by the cry of a bird--" whe-oo,
whe-oo "--a short distance away. He said, " I saw the most lovely
bird in creation feeding on the red berries of a tree." He watched
it for some time--a splendid male. Its tail it occasionally jerked
open and closed again and now and then slightly raised, causing the
long tail-coverts to vibrate gracefully ; as soon as he began to move
it darted away and was seen no more. I have some stuffed specimens,
but a live bird I did not see. I found this Trogon nested in the cavity

I found only one species of Curassow in Mexico, the Globose Curassow
(Crax globicera). This is the only species met with in America north
of Panama.
The Mexican Wild Turkey ( Meleagris gallo-pavo) is found in the
forest outside the ranch ; the Black-beard is the local name. My
quest for this bird was not a success, the writer having the unique
experience of getting lost in the mountains while searching for Wild
Turkeys, the only mishap on my journey.
We paid a visit to a Prospectors' Camp. We had some difficulty
in reaching the camp, as there was no road we had to " blaze a new
trail ". After a long ride in the car we got into a canyon, and finally
reached our destination after a rough journey. It was a most lovely
spot " where every prospect pleases ", a beautiful valley surrounded
by hills and mountains. On our way we almost ran into a flock of
Turkey Buzzards feasting on the body of a dead animal.
The elder of the two men at the camp was one of the pioneers of
the country, and entertained the writer with stories of the fights with
the Bed men in those early days, the younger man prepared an excellent
dinner. It was certainly a novelty to the writer to dine in a log shack
with the table covered with a snow-white tablecloth.
Many beautiful birds I found in this romantic spot. My host
understood all about the birds in the neighbourhood, and pointed
out on one of the distant peaks the nest of the White-tailed Eagle.
These birds had been there several years, were never disturbed, and
went out every morning " on a foray ". I saw them return later in the
day. He also informed me some time before an half-grown black bear
had passed up the valley. On that day our trip altogether was a
very enjoyable one, and the trouble of our journey more than
justified the result.

bird was so fine and the longer I had her the more deep in colour
became the crimson. The first point I learnt of value was this : these
birds can be kept alive and in perfect plumage and health for years
on bread and milk. The General was hard to feed because she cared
for few things : fruit she liked fairly well, but she ate daily as much
bread and milk as possible, and woe to us if her dish was empty ! She
really seemed to enjoy it greatly, as she took it with such quickness
and delight. The food was made with condensed milk. She would
also eat and enjoy nicely beaten-up raw eggs ; once she was poorly,
and she took nothing but raw egg and brandy for a week, and this,
I believe, saved her. No seed did she care for.
Another point of interest is this : I never saw the Parrot take any-
thing up in her claws, as do all other species. I wonder if the Marquess
of Tavistock ever noted this while he had her. [We have never
observed a Grass Parrakeet (Neophema) or a Bourke use a foot for
holding food, but Parrots that do not do so are very few.-- Ed.] Is this
Vulture-headed type of bird a true Parrot ? Very little seems to be
known of them, and eating no seed and not using the claws seems
to me funny and not true to type. Even&amp;apos;the Lories at once use the
claws and Love-birds also. " The General " became very loving,
and could be handled by those she was fond of. She had strong likes
and dislikes. No vice, but no liking for the male sex, at whom she
always showed resentment by her loud call. I believe her to have
been a highly nervous bird : the call was one of fear, and she regarded
most folk in this way. It took me months to overcome this fear in
her. On arrival she was in a sad state, and I did not take her out of
her travelling-box, but allowed her to come out of her own free will.
This took three days, and was only accomplished by placing food
by her and leaving her alone. For months I was almost in despair
of ever getting her quiet, and yet at the end she followed me about
when loose and died in my arms after taking from a spoon all her
food. I really thought I should save her.
She could not stand cold at all, though I have heard that the other
specimen, I believe in America, is out of doors. I wonder if it is
still alive ?
Parrots are very human : they require to have every confidence

in one. I never hurry them but let them come to one and get to know
that one loves them. I have an Eclectus hen it took me a year to handle;
now she is perfect. It is only fear, I believe, not really vice in them.
Nature has given this to them to defend themselves, and why
not ? We look very big creatures to them ; and possibly we should
feel the same if put out by wild animals, and try and defend ourselves!
Don't lose your temper if a Parrot nips you and try and not let
him do it again. A quiet manner and voice and gentle talking to
them wins them after a while. These glorious birds have a wonderful
memory, and never forget unkindness, and I believe they do not forget
people.
M. Dalton-Burgess, F.Z.S.
[The Editor is much obliged to Mrs. Dalton-Burgess for these
notes on her Pesquet's Parrot, which died some months ago. This
remarkable bird was for some time in his possession before it went
to Bristol. Being totally unlike any other Parrot in appearance and
habits, it was a most difficult matter to discover a perfectly suitable
food. Perhaps one of our American members could let us know how
the bird which is, or was, in captivity in America, has been fed and with
what results, and an Indian member may be able to collect similar
information with regard to the bird in India referred to in Monsieur
Delacour's interesting letter which appeared in the February number.
It is in the collection of Mr. Kumar Gitendro Mullick, of Calcutta.
We are pleased to hear that Mrs. Dalton-Burgess has recently acquired
a new pair of Pesquets, and wish her an even greater measure of success
with them than with her first. She finds that the sexes are distinguish-
able by a little red on the head of the male, which, in the female, is
lacking.]

Nearly a year ago, when the series of special articles for the

consented to undertake the special article on Parrots. He now finds
himself with very little time and not enough personal experience
to deal properly with this enormous and varied family of birds. In

order that the article may be worthy of the Magazine and not prove
very uneven in interest and value, he therefore appeals to all members
not to abstain from sending him any notes of avicultural interest they
may be able to write on any Parrots not included in the following
list. In this way he hopes to collect an interesting store of information
from which he can draw when dealing with species of which he has little
or no experience. Notes on the habits of different species in a wild
state are not needed, neither are elaborate descriptions of plumage,
though plumage notes which show differences of sex and differences
between nearly related species are valuable. Food, treatment, housing,
breeding, ability to stand cold, disposition, attitude to other birds,
and special diseases are among the most important points to be
considered.

The July number of British Birds contains a note of two hen Pied
Wagtails, paired to the same cock and sharing the same nest. The
Pied Wagtail, as anyone will&amp;apos;know who has tried to keep these birds
in captivity, is excessively spiteful towards its own kind when breeding,
the hens being as bad, or worse, than the cocks. The incident is a
striking illustration of a fact that avicultural experience is constantly
bringing to light, the occasional extraordinary departure in tempera-

ment by one or two individual birds from the usual characteristics
of their race. An equally remarkable instance of harmonious joint
nesting by two birds, belonging to species normally very pugnacious,
occurred many years ago in the aviary of one of our members, two
hen Broadtailed Parrakeets sharing the same nest.
There is also an interesting letter by Mr. J. M. Dewar pointing
out that Aristotle was aware of the very strange breeding habits
of certain species of Red-legged Partridges, among which two sittings
of eggs are laid by the hen who incubates the second lot while her mate
incubates the first, the parents afterwards bringing up the two broods
separately. This peculiar conduct was recently observed by
Mr. Portal, who had a single tame pair of Cretan Chukor and it is at
present doubtful whether, as some believe, the cock " Frenchman "
has the same habit, or whether he imitates the Indian Chukor in
avoiding all family duties and only rejoining the covey when the
latter are nearly, or quite, full grown.

Sir, --In May, 1923, my Swan hatched nine cygnets and she reared
eight, one of which I gave to a neighbour, and this one nested and laid
eggs in April this year, before being a year old !
This nest was destroyed by an otter or some animal, but she laid
again, and was sitting when last I heard. Her mate is an old bird.
Is it not very unusual for a brown cygnet to nest ?
Alfred Thom.
[It is not very extraordinary for a mute Swan to lay nine or ten
eggs in place of the normal five or six, but for a cygnet to lay even one
sitting of eggs, let alone two, when a year old, is most unusual, and we
have never heard of a similar instance. Domestication would seem
to be rendering the Swan, like other birds, more prolific than it is
when living in a really wild state.-- Ed.]

When, at the end of the eighteenth century, Steganopleura guttata
was imported into Europe for the first time, the dealers sold it under
the name which the colonists had given it, " Diamond Sparrow,"
translated into French as " Diamant ". This name had been bestowed
because of the little white spots which ornament the flanks. Later the
French dealers applied this title to all the little Weaving Finches which
are natives of Australia and. the islands of the Pacific, although most of
them have not got the white spots in their plumage to which the
Diamond Sparrow owes its name.
These birds have certain structural features and habits, which,
in our opinion, are sufficient to set them apart from those which we
have examined previously. Natives, for the most part, of the
temperate regions of Australia, nearly all have shown themselves very
ready to become acclimatized in Europe and they deserve to be
reckoned among the best of aviary birds.
The Grassfinches feed on seeds and frequent tall grass and low
bushes, where they build their spherical nests. They live in little flocks,
young and old joining together after the nesting season and they visit
the neighbouring streams at regular hours in order to drink. It is there
that the bird-catchers spread their nets in order to take them. All the
Grassfinches are hardy, and when they have become used to our climate
most of them can pass the winter in an unheated aviary. They need
the same care in captivity as we have shown to be necessary for Waxbills.
When they reach Europe they take longer to acclimatize than the

African Waxbills. It is wise not to pnt them into the aviary before the
end of the winter following their arrival. Some hardy kinds, however,
become acclimatized more quickly.
These birds have almost all bred in aviaries and some have even
shown themselves extremely prolific. They are easier to breed than
Waxbills because many of them rear their young on the millet, canary-
seed, soaked bread and insectile mixture which form the diet of the
adults.
We will divide these birds into two groups : first those which seem
to approach more closely to the African Waxbills in their characteristics
and habits, but which differ from them, however, in their larger size,
heavier build, stronger beaks and in the very different attitudes assumed
by the males in their nuptial dance. The second group come nearer to
the Nuns, and include all the Grassfinches, which, by their thick beaks
and massive and less elegant forms, recall these latter birds. In an aviary
they show themselves, on the whole, more sociable than the Nuns,
readier to breed and less exclusively seed-eating during the nesting
season.

The Crimson Finch (Neochmia phaeton) has the top of the head
brown ; the same colour of a more fawn tint and washed with red is
found on the wings and back ; tail very long, red above, black beneath.
Beak bright red ; the cheeks and all the lower part of the body scarlet,
flecked with little white spots on the sides. The female is brown with
the cheeks, beak and tail red ; breast and flanks grey. Without being
rare, it is not often imported. It is fairly delicate on arrival, the females
especially so. It then needs plenty of animal food. It attacks weaker
birds during the nesting season. It should have artificial heat in winter.
It is a moderately free breeder.
Habitat .--North Australia.
The Bufous-tailed Finch (Bathilda ruficauda) has the upper part of
the body yellowish olive-green ; under tail-coverts dark red, spotted
with pale red ; tail rufous-red ; the forehead, cheeks, and throat are

The Painted Finch (Emblema picta) is reddish-brown above ; rump,
upper tail-coverts, forehead, cheeks, throat and top of the breast
scarlet; sides of the body dark greyish-brown and covered with white
spots ; area round the vent yellowish ; tail brownish-black. Beak red
and black. The female has no red on the cheeks and throat; the breast
alone is tinged with red ; the lower part of the body is browner. Very
rare, this bird is fairly hardy and nests readily in captivity,
where it is extremely decorative. It must be wintered with artificial
heat. It is timid and peaceable in the aviary.
Habitat. --Western Australia, New South Wales, Central Australia.
The Cherry Finch ( Aidemosyne modesta) has the upper part of the
body brown, spotted with white on the wing-coverts ; under part of the
body white, regularly barred with brown ; there is a black spot on the
throat; top of the head cherry red. Beak black. The female has
no black on the throat and no red on the head. This bird, once common,
is now hardly ever imported ; it is an excellent breeder, and moderately
hardy but liable to take a chill during wet weather.
Habitat. --Queensland, Central Australia.
Bichenow's Finch ( Stictoptera bichenowi) has the top of the head,
nape, sides of the neck and back ash-grey, very finely barred with a

The Masked Grassfinch ( Poephila personata) is bright chestnut above,
lighter underneath and on the head ; beak yellow, surrounded by a
black mask ; the lower part of the belly and area round the vent white ;
tail black and pointed ; beginning on a level with the thighs, a broad,
black mark forms a girdle with a break in the middle of the belly.
Female similar. Timid and gentle in an aviary, it breeds well.

species ; but the whole of the plumage is lighter ; tail very long, with the
two median rectrices prolonged in a thread-like fashion. Beak yellow.
Habitat. --Western part of Northern Australia.
There is a variety of this species (P. hechi) which has the beak red.
Habitat. --Eastern part of Northern Australia.
These two birds are both good breeders in an aviary. They are a
little less hardy than the Parson Finch, but are also less quarrelsome.
They dislike damp.

the head and the forehead scarlet edged with black; throat black ;
a turquoise-blue band, broader at the nape, surrounds the black of the
head ; back and wings brilliant grass-green ; rump light blue ; breast
violet ; upper part of the belly orange ; the rest is of a paler yellow,
and the region round the vent is white ; tail black ; the two median
feathers, prolonged into thread-like points, exceed the others in length.
Beak white, red at the tip. The female is like the male, but her colours
have a washed-out look and lack brilliance. The blue band is wanting
on the nape.
Black-headed Gouldian Finch (P. gouldice) is like the last-mentioned
species, but the top of the head and the forehead are black instead of

The Yellow-headed Gouldian Finch (P. armitiand) has the top
of the head and the forehead pale orange.
The Gouldian Finches are very delicate on arrival; after a moult
in captivity they become hardy. They are less sensitive to the cold than
to the wet. They often desert their young after they have been hatched,

lower surface, which is of a very light brown.
This splendid bird is usually difficult to acclimatize through lack of
a food suited to its needs. On its arrival in Europe it must be fed on
paddy rice which has been allowed to swell by soaking in cold water,
and it must be gradually accustomed to oats and white millet soaked in
cold water and well dried, which should form its food in captivity. It
is then hardy, but is unable to stand the cold, so it must be wintered
in a heated indoor aviary. There is a variety of this species which
has the belly bright yellow. It has bred several times in captivity in
Germany.
Habitat. --Java, Borneo, and Sumatra.
The Parrot Finch (E. psittacea ) has the forehead, cheeks and throat,
rump and tail scarlet. The rest of the body is parrot-green, duller on the
belly and on the breast. The female is like the male.
A very rare aviary bird nowadays, it is an excellent breeder, and
suffers less from the cold than from the damp, and must be shut in
the shelter of the aviary in winter.
Habitat. --New Caledonia.
The Three-coloured Parrot Finch (E. trichroa) is like the last-
mentioned species, but the forehead and cheeks are blue and the throat
green. Size a little larger than that of the common Parrot Finch. The
female resembles the male, but is smaller.
A hardy bird, it has several times been bred in an aviary, but it
seems to me less prolific than the last-mentioned species.
Habitat. --Caroline Islands, New Guinea, the Moluccas.
Peale's Parrot Finch (E. peali) resembles the common Parrot Finch,
but has the top of the throat black passing into blue at the top of the
breast. In its habits it is exactly like the last-mentioned species, and
has nested in an aviary.
Habitat. --The Fiji Islands.

THRUSHES

Both for aviaries and cages, members of tbe family of Thrushes are
very attractive ; and when I speak of " Thrushes " I confine them to the
true Thrushes (Turdus), the Ouzels ( Merula ), and the ground Thrushes
(Geocichla), for under the great clan of Turdidse, Robins, Robin-chats,
etc., could lay claim to relationship, with their spotted plumage when
immature, so that the favourite Robin-redbreast is a diminutive
" Thrush ", and the Nightingale also, and others. But I may as well
include in this article the Rock Thrushes ( Monticola , etc.), in addition
to those four " families " which I have mentioned.
There are six species of Thrushes in the British Isles and France,
three of which are more or less residents throughout the year, the
Song Thrush, the Mistle Thrush, and the Blackbird. Two are winter
visitors from Scandinavia, the Fieldfare and the Redwing, and one is
a summer visitor, wintering in Africa, the Ring, or Mountain, Ouzel,
a bird which is never found except in the hills where springs rise amongst
the boulders, and gorse, bracken, and heather reign. The species does
not seek out the gardens of men, but rather shuns them, so that to see
the Ring Ouzel one has to climb in the solitudes of Dartmoor and
Exmoor, the hills and mountains of Wales, of Cumberland, or of
Yorkshire and Westmorland. Yet the Ring Ouzel is a very near cousin
of the familiar Black Ouzel, the ubiquitous Blackbird, so that there&amp;apos;
seems no reason for its aloofness, although I envy this bird's life ; the
spring and summer amidst the glory of the northern hills ; the winter
in the warmth of Africa. Perpetual brightness ; whilst the Blackbird
begs for food at our doors and outside our windows when the snow
covers the ground and the bitter winds have frozen the waters. I wish
he was known as the Black Ouzel; " Blackbird " is neither so happy nor
so euphonious. A Rook, a Carrion Crow, and a Raven might be
dubbed a Blackbird. I am not sure, seeing that the Ring Ouzel is also
known as the Mountain Ouzel, that the Blackbird might not have been
styled the Garden Ouzel, just as the Dipper is the Water Ouzel, for the
Blackbird is so essentially a bird of our gardens, and is to me perhaps the

most beautiful songster that we have, not in execution and brilliancy and
variation as with the Nightingale, but in quality of tone and richness
of sound. But aviculturists will say, " Enough of all this, let us hear of
cages and aviaries, and of the keeping of Thrushes therein," yet there
are those who can be styled aviculturists, who have a special care for
and love of the birds at liberty, and therefore my thoughts and my
pen stray to them in that state of life to which it has pleased Nature to
call them, before I embark upon the other to which the aviculturist, in
the stricter sense, has.
But we all delight in the wild birds, and in taming without restricting
them to certain limits.
Thrushes in Cages
Like all insectivorous birds, which have softer feathers than Finches
and the like, Thrushes should have cages of wooden or cane bars,
perhaps cages that are liberal in length rather than in height, so that a
bird can enjoy a good jump or hop, with at least three perches. The
cages may be boarded at the two ends, roof, and the back, or may be
of open bars ; it depends upon the inmate. A tame Song Thrush will
accommodate himself, but my experience of Ground Thrushes, such as
the Orange-headed (Geocichla citrina), of India, is that he is fond of
shelter, and apt at moments to be scared and to leap upwards, so that
I have kept this species, at any rate, until an individual becomes really
tame, in a cage with a waxed linen ceiling, so to speak, beneath the
wooden roof, the linen stretched tightly upon a light frame of wood,
which can be drawn out of a groove, so as to destroy red mite in the event
of an incursion from such curses !
But I feel sure about the length of the cage being more important
than breadth and height, not that I mean it to have no height, for it
should be high enough for the bird to have one perch decidedly above
the level of the others ; the central one. English cage-makers--why,
I know not--have not the gift of making cages of wooden bars strongly
yet light, as the French can, and for that matter, the Italians. The
English are, by nature, stolid and solid, and the temperament appears
in their cages, which are very good and very enduring, but not light to
carry. I myself have excellent Thrush-cages of French manufacture

which are as light as the feathers of the birds that inhabit them ; and
are, for all that, strong. I like these all-wooden cages of open bars ;
white, unvarnished wood ; for they can be put into a big bath of
scalding water and out they come, clean and free of parasites. You
judge the size for yourself if you have ordinary reasoning, and you have
the cage in proportion to the size and activity of the bird whose house it
is to be, for a bird must have, or should have, freedom in captivity,
just as a cottage should have one large room where you can freely swing
a cat!
Neither am I satisfied with a roomy cage, because I feel that a bird
is not either, so that I usually let my caged birds out for a fly in some
room, and find that with kindness--it is all done by that--they look
upon their flight in the room as we should a walk, and their cage as we
do our house, so that they always come home for lunch or tea ! Which
brings me to their food.
Food
For Thrushes it is needless to say that they must have an insectile
mixture, and I prefer the best quality, obtained from a professional
manufacturer or mixer of the same ; not necessarily a mere dealer in
birds, but rather, and preferably, from someone who has made
insectivorous birds and their food a special study. Putting the portion
of mixture into a bowl, one can add grated apple and boiled carrot to
moisten it, and perhaps a little scraped raw heart; not water. Finely
chopped lettuce also, mixing it thoroughly so that all the powdery
portion of the food is powdery no longer, and then it can be ladled with
a spoon into the food vessel, which has been scalded every morning.
No unjust and foolish economies, pouring new wine into old bottles,
in the shape of adding to-day's food to yesterday's when there is some
of the latter ; and when the weather is hot, it is advisable either to mix
twice a day, or else to give a small portion in the morning and cover over
the afternoon meal with a damp cloth in a cool larder. Fruits, such as
strawberries, Japanese wine-berries (and these are excellent), etc., can
be cut up ; they help to moisten the insectile food and are welcome
additions. And a few mealworms as a treat, but it is better to under-
feed than the reverse. I lost a beautiful Mistle Thrush through gross

obesity ; if, therefore, an individual bird eats too much, its food should
be removed for an hour or two during the day.
All the Thrushes delight in bathing, and it is advisable when the
bath is affixed to the open door to remove the sand-drawer and cover
the bottom of the cage with paper until the bath is finished, for the bird
will hop in and out several times, soiling its feet and the perches with
wet sand. The bath can be of some light metal, with glass sides and
top ; if it is of open wire there is too much exterior splashing.
In Aviaries Thrushes are best in single pairs if it is intended to breed
with them, for they are very bullying, especially perhaps the North
American migratory Thrush (T. migratorius ). If there are no females,
males can be kept in limited numbers, but the aviary must have shrubs
where they can shelter and take refuge from any particularly masterful
bird. This also applies to a pair, since at certain seasons of the year the
male will bully his mate, or vice versa. An aviary for themselves should
certainly have some grass, where they can find earthworms. The
members of the family are for the most part very hardy when once
acclimatized, for even the Indian Thrushes are used to high altitudes
in a wild state.
As to their nesting in an aviary, they often choose a box or basket
hung up in the roosting-house, rather than make a nest in a bush, and
as one well knows, Blackbirds will build in sheds on some ledge in a
wild state. Fine twigs, dead leaves, moss and coarse withered grass
can be placed in a basket for materials, and a box with moistened earth
or cowdung ; not that I think the latter is really necessary, although to
Song Thrushes it may be an encouragement!
Good supplies of earthworms can be thrown in, many of which will
burrow under the turf to be devoured later on in the natural manner,
which is the best.
Species
It would be impossible and endless to mention all the species of the
family, since of Turdus there are some eighty known to ornithologists,
Merula nearly seventy, and Geocichla (" Ground Thrushes ") at least
fifty, making up two hundred in all, not to mention three species of
Mimocichla, represented by the red-legged Thrushes of Cuba and
South America. The great Thrush family is to be found everywhere,

from Canada to the Falkland Islands, from Siberia, through China and
India, in the islands of the Southern Seas, in Europe, Africa, Australia,
and America. A large majority of them are migratory, including our
own Song Thrushes and Blackbirds, and all have good power of flight.
The Song Thrush (T. musicus ).--If one saw a good specimen for
the first time at a dealer's as a rare importation from some far-off
country, and heard it sing, surely one would take off one's hat and pay
one's money. Song Thrushes become very tame in captivity, and their
charming cheery song will echo through the house when the days are
dark and cold. Neither is there anything more beautiful than the nest
with its eggs of turquoise blue, speckled with black.
The Blackbird (Merula merula ).--A bird which needs careful
cleanliness in a cage ; the sand being passed through a sieve every
morning, although this should be done with all cages. Very apt to
spoil the pure natural beauty of its song, I prefer it at liberty in the
garden, for a Blackbird that whistles " Coming through the Rye ", or
some other hackneyed tune, has no charm for me ; I can do it myself
quite as well, if not better.
The Mistle Thrush (T. viscivorus ).--A bird which is not often
caged, but one which can make a charming pet. I reared one from the
nest, christened him " Speckles ", and allowed him to fly from his
house, which hung nearly all the year through in an open loggia, every
day. Although his own kith and kin were about, and his own birthplace
close at hand, he became entirely attached to humans. Sometimes he
would fly into some yew-trees close by, but almost always came
into the house through doors or open windows, and would be
found upstairs and downstairs and in my lady's chamber. He was apt
to be tiresome, swooping at people's heads from the top of a cupboard
or picture when they were unaware of his presence. After he had been
out for some time, I used to whistle or call " Speckles ", and down he
came.
I would say " Now, Speckles, it's time you went home", hold his
cage before him, into which he hopped, immediately turning round
to fiercely peck my fingers, as much as to say, " I'm quite capable of
coming home without your interference ! " Oh ! a most intelligent and
attractive bird.

He was a case of over-eating, and, after my absence from home
for a month, I found him on my return positively gasping from fat.
It ended in two days in his having convulsions, the heart being strained,
and to my deep regret he died. So much character had he that guests on
their return for another visit would always say " How is Speckles ? "
And such a handsome bird. I should have liked those who say it is
cruel to keep birds in cages to have seen 4 4 Speckles As to song, the
Mistle Thrush does not shine at near quarters in a cage, for there is little
variation and the tone is shrill; but when in a wild state the bird sits
at the top of a high tree and pours out his wild notes, in February and
March, it is worth listening to, although it lacks the mellow tones of
the Blackbird, as also the variety ; but the voice has a cousinly
resemblance, and is mistaken for it by those who have not closely
studied the two.
The Bing Ouzel ( M . torquata ).--A handsome bird for the aviary,
and one that will become very tame in a cage, but its song, although
after the style of the Blackbird's, is not as good.
The Fieldfare (T. pilaris ).-- I have always wanted to obtain hand-
reared fieldfares from Norway, where they nest in colonies, for it is an
exceedingly handsome bird with a pleasing song. Wild caught birds
do not become tame in cages, as far as I know, and the same applies
to the Bedwing (T. iliacus ). The flocks of these two species are a familiar
sight in England from October to March.
American " Bobin " (T. migratorius). -- A very handsome Thrush,
reminding one of the Blackbird in form and demeanour. It resorts to
gardens and orchards in the United States, just as the Blackbird does
in Europe. The early settlers from England called it " Bobin ", on
account of its russet breast. The species has been liberated in England
and bred in a wild state. In an aviary a pair is not to be trusted, for
they will slaughter young birds of other species in the nest. The song
is cheery, but certainly not equal to the Blackbirds in quality.
The species nests very readily in captivity, and the eggs, of a pure,
unspotted turquoise blue-green of a brilliant hue, are very pretty.
Wood Thrush (T. mustelinus ).--A very charming little Thrush
inhabiting the United States, which has been occasionally imported to
England, in very limited numbers by the permission of the authorities

of the New York Zoological Park. Somewhat smaller than the Song
Thrush, the upper parts of foxy-brown, the under parts white with
clear black spots on the breast. The song of this bird does not at all
resemble that of the Song Thrush, and is a far-sounding melodious
" Eolie ". It is a summer visitor of New England, etc. ; I have not
found this species robust in an aviary. In a wild state it frequents damp
undergrowth in the forests. Wood Thrushes become very tame in
captivity, and are very attractive.
Hermit Thrush (T. solitarius or Pallasi). -- There is more than one
species or race of what may be called Hermit Thrushes, such as
T. ustulatus , T. swainsoni, and T. auduboni. They are all miniature
Thrushes, and most graceful. The Hermit Thrushes that I have had
most kindly presented to me by the authorities of the New York
Zoological Park have been, I believe, specimens of T. solitarius ; in
general colouring very much resembling our Song Thrush, but the spots
on the breast are less numerous and softer, whilst the tail has a russet
tint like that of the Nightingale.
I know of no member of the Thrush family which is so dainty in
contour and demeanour.
The Hermit Thrushes are summer visitois to many parts of the
United States, British Columbia, etc. Dr. Elliott Cones, in the Birds of
the Colorado Valley , writes : " The weird associations of the spot where
the Hermit triumphs, the mystery inseparable from the voice of an
unseen musician, conspire to heighten the effect of the sweet, silvery,
bell-like notes, which, beginning soft, low, and tinkling, rise higher and
higher, to end abruptly with a clear ringing intonation."
The Hermit Thrush has a habit of raising its tail and then slowly
lowering it to its usual position ; this movement often follows the act
of perching. I used to hear my Hermit Thrushes singing, at some
considerable distance, a most unmistakable carol ; very clear and
tinkling.
They cannot stand much damp cold, and are better in a warm shelter
during the winter.
A pair to themselves in a small aviary with plenty of sheltering
shrubs might very possibly nest.
If I had my choice, and was limited to six species of insectivorous

birds, Hermit Thrushes would be one of them. They are thorough little
aristocrats. (Cf. Avicultural Magazine, Yol. VII, April, 1909,
p. 177, etc.)
N.B.--The coloured plate is not satisfactory of either the Hermit
Thrush, or the " Veery
Wilson's Thrush (T. fuscescens). --Usually known in the United
States as the " Veery " and " Tawny Thrush ". It resembles a good-
sized Nightingale, but it is the colour of that bird's russet tail on the
whole of the upper parts, and the upper breast is pale buff with light
dusky spots, the under parts being snow-white. It is common in New
England as a spring migrant and summer resident, resorting to forests
where the timber fringes small streams amongst broken ravines over-
grown with shrubs ; but always near water. It's charming song has
been described as ta-weel-ah--ta-weel-ah--twil-ah--twil-ah, accom-
panied by a fine trill.
This bird should be treated as is the Nightingale in captivity. It is
a very beautiful little Thrush, but hardly ever imported.
Dusky Thrush (T. leucomelas). --This is one of several species of
South American Thrushes, which have longitudinal stripes on the chin
and no spots on the breast. The general colour of the Dusky Thrush
is olive brown, darker above, paler below.
The late W. H. Hudson writes enthusiastically of its singing. " The
strains are poured forth in a continuous stream, with all the hurry and
freedom of the Skylark's song ; but though so rapidly uttered every
note is distinct and clear, and the voice singularly sweet and far-
reaching."
I have one of these Thrushes, but have not yet heard his song ;
indeed, I cannot be sure of its sex.
T. rufiventer, the Rufous-bellied Thrush, is the same style of bird,
but has not, I believe, so good a voice. It has been imported of late, as
has also perhaps the Russet-bellied Thrush ( T. fumigatus), but these
two species are not easy to distinguish apart from one another, and
especially when in a bird-shop on first arrival, with soiled feathers.
Africa also produces species of Thrushes with striped throats and
tawny or russet breasts, after the manner of the American " Robin "
(T. migmtorius). The Kurrichaine Thrush (T. libonyanus) is one.

None of these unspotted Thrushes can hold a candle to our own Song
Thrush or to the Hermit and Wood Thrush of North America. To my
mind they have much more the style of the Blackbird, but not its
beautiful song.
White's Thrush (Geocichla varia). --A large, handsome bird, the
size of a Mistle Thrush, the whole plumage covered with dark
lunulated spots on a tawny ground. A native of China, Japan, Siberia,
etc., which has occurred several times in England as stray individuals,
.and also on the continent of Europe. I received a pair some years ago,
but their feet were in such a miserable condition that they did not
survive to moult out into good plumage.
Orange-headed Ground Thrush ( Geocichla citrina). --A most
desirable bird with handsome plumage and a fine song of ringing
melodious notes. This species is more frequently imported from India
than any other of the so-called Ground Thrushes, and has bred in
English aviaries. Mr. Teschemaker and Dr. Amsler have been successful.
The head and under parts are orange-chestnut, the rest of the upper
parts greyish-blue in the male, and greenish-grey in the female, whose
*orange of the head and breast are not nearly so bright as in the male.
The median wing-coverts have white tips forming a bar of white on the
shoulders. This beautiful Thrush is perfectly hardy in an outdoor
.aviary, and can become very tame. There is an island race in Andaman,
whose orange area of colour is more intense ; and another in Java
(G. andamanensis and G. rubecula).
There are several very handsome species of Geocichla which are
inhabitants of some of the South Sea Islands, notably the Celebean
Ground Thrush (G. erythronota) , an exceedingly handsome bird with
orange upper parts and a fine distribution of black and white on wings
and under parts. In Java is found Kuhl's Geocichla (G. interpres),
another very handsome bird which one greatly desires, and about which
*one comes to the conclusion that " want " must be one's master !
Mexican Ground Thrush ( Geocichla pinicola). --A rather handsome
Ground Thrush with blackish-brown upper parts and white geocichline
marks on wings and tail. I possessed a pair of these birds, but did not
find them particularly interesting. It inhabits the pine woods of
Mexico at a height up to over 8,000 feet above the sea.

Siberian Ground Thrush (G . sibirica). --A very handsome bird of a
warm slaty-grey with white eyebrows, a band of white down the belly,
and spots of the same colour on under tail-coverts and lateral tail
feathers. One was killed in England near Guildford in 1860. It winters
in Java, Sumatra, etc. Mr. H. Leybourne Popham, writing on birds seen
in the Valley of the Yenesi near the Arctic Circle, observes : " This
handsome Thrush was often to be seen perched on the top of a tree,
whistling a few rich notes."
It would certainly be a desirable aviary bird. The female is brown,
with ochreous breast thickly spotted with lumulated markings.
There is a Japanese race, the male of which is of a darker slate-grey,
and has no white on the belly. This species nests on Fuji-Yama at a
height of 5,000 feet. It can be obtained dead in the Yokohama market,
so that it might possibly be secured alive by Japanese.
The South African Ground Thrush (G. litsitsipura) .---There are
Ground Thrushes which are coloured after the style of the Song Thrush
(T. musicus), as for instance is this species, but the tail is shorter and
the beak longer. Upper parts ashy-brown ; under parts sandy white,
thickly spotted with black fan-shaped markings. Dr. Amsler possessed
three of these birds.
White-throated Ground Thrush (G. cyanonota ) (cf. Avicultural
Magazine, N.S., Vol. II, April, 1904, p. 179, etc.).--This bears a close
resemblance to the Orange-headed Ground Thrush (G . citrina), but has
black and white geocichline marks on the cheeks. These so-called
Ground Thrushes do not, as a matter of fact, frequent the ground any
more than the other true Thrushes do, and are not like the Pittas, which
live almost entirely there. The White-throated Geocichla has a very
sweet song after the style of his orange-headed cousin.
Chinese Ouzel ( Merula mandarina) .--An enlarged edition of
the Blackbird ( Merula merula) and a favourite cage-bird with the
Chinese.
The Grey-winged Ouzel ( Merula houlhoul). --A well-known aviary
bird. A " Blackbird " with a pale grey patch on wing-coverts and
secondaries. It inhabits the Himalayas, and is a good songster.
White-collared Ouzel ( Merula albicincta). --Another Ouzel of
the Himalayas. Black, with a broad white collar extending round the

coloured. The song is mellow.
There are several species of Ouzels in South America, many of them
bearing a strong likeness to the " Blackbird ", but usually having yellow
legs and feet as well as bills.
The Kandavu Ouzel has a chestnut head and neck.
Another very handsome Himalayan species is the Grey-headed
Chestnut Ouzel (M. castanea), which is said to be a fine songster.
It is found in Cashmere in the summer.
Gould's Chestnut Ouzel is extremely handsome. General
colouring : head and neck, wings and tail dark brown ; body rich
chestnut. The song is like the Blackbird's, but not so mellow.
Black-throated Ouzel (Merula atrigularis). --A summer visitor
to Siberia and the mountains of Central Asia. It has been obtained in
the British Isles. The male is a handsome bird with dark-grey upper
parts, a black throat and gorget, and whitish under parts.
Cuban Grey Thrush ( Mimocichla rubripes ).--A handsome bird,
but not much of a songster. General colour above, dark slaty-grey ;
white chin ; black throat; chestnut belly. The tail is black with outer
feathers broadly tipped with white. Legs and feet orange.
A grey Mimocichla is found in the Bahamas, and another of the
same colour with a striped throat in San Domingo.

Blue Bock Thrush (Monticola cyanus) .--No bird makes a more
intimate and charming cage-bird. The general colour of the male is
slaty-blue, the head having a silvery blue tint.
The Bock Thrushes are allied rather to the Chats than to the
Turdidae, but as they are termed " Thrushes ", I am including them
in this article.
The Blue Bock Thrush is abundant in Italy and Southern Europe,
as well as Palestine, etc., and is a favourite cage-bird with the Italians.
Its song is not entirely melodious, but when heard in the mountains
when all else is soundless, except perhaps for the trickle of a rill near
by, the notes of this bird add a charm to the beauty of its haunts.
They often nest in inaccessible spots in the face of a precipice, but

also sometimes in the roofs of houses, where there is some small
hollow or niche. I have seen male birds on the roofs, singing ;
reminding me of the fact that the Passera solitaries, as the Italians call
it, is the Sparrow on the housetop of the psalmist. One individual
that I kept, lived for thirteen years and said " Pretty boy " most
distinctly. These birds become very pugnacious when tame, and are
extremely intelligent. The female is not nearly so pure a blue-grey as
her mate, but is browner in tint.
Pied Rock Thrush (M. saxatilis ).--This is also a bird inhabiting
the continent of Europe as a summer resident. I have seen it in the
mountains of Auvergne and above the Italian lakes. It is always found
on high rocky ground, looking like a large Redstart, and having a similar
rapid vibration of its rufous tail.
I have reared broods, which is not difficult to do, and such birds
become extremely tame. They have a double moult, unlike the true
Thrushes. The Italians call this bird " Codirossone ", which means the
"Large Red-tail", or, as we should say in England, Redstart. It is slightly
smaller than a Song Thrush. The species keeps to the rocks and boulders,
not trees.
A very delightful cage-bird, with a pleasing song. Pleasing, but not
superior.
Chestnut-breasted Blue Rock Thrush (M. erythrogastra)
(cf. Avicultural Magazine, Yol. IV, July, 1913, p. 253, etc.).--A
bird of the Himalayas, and is found about Dar j eeling and on the Khasia
Hills. I acquired a pair in 1912.
The male is very handsome ; the upper parts a fine blue with
blackish-blue throat; the under parts rich chestnut. The female is
quite different, being ochreous brown above, and fawn underneath, each
feather laced with a darked tint.
The Blue-headed Rock Thrush (M . cinchloryncha). -- The finest
of all the Rock Thrushes, as far as my experience goes. The male has a
cobalt-blue head and throat with a black stripe across the eyes and over
the ears. Back, black with dusty lacing to each feather ; breast, under
parts, and upper tail-coverts rich chestnut; shoulders, blue ; wings,
black with blue edging to the coverts and secondaries, and a con-
spicuous white patch upon the latter ; tail, black with blue edgings.

218 Captain H. S. Stokes--The Lilac-crowned Fruit Pigeon
The female is sandy brown, with dark lacings on the under parts, the
ground of which is pale fawn. This Bock Thrush is rather smaller and of
a more graceful form than is the Pied Bock Thrush of Europe, and is a
native of different parts of the Himalayas. A decided acquisition to the
aviculturist. (Cf. Avicultukal Magazine, Vol. IV, October, 1913.
p. 349.)
There are other Bock Thrushes in Asia and Africa, but, as far as I
know, no other species except the four I have recorded have been
imported, unless it be an African one.

By Captain H. S. Stokes
I have again succeeded in rearing a young Lilac-crown. The cock
of my original pair unfortunately died last October of exposure to rain,
but the Zoo kindly gave me another one. However, he did not turn out
very well, refusing to do his share of the sitting thrice this spring, and
at the third effort, after the hen had sat for eighteen days the egg was
clear. So I removed this cock and replaced him with my last year's
aviary-bred one. They set to work at once and sat very steadily, and the
young bird left the nest when ten days old, one day sooner than last
year. Although no bigger than a Mannikin it flew at once quite strongly,
and has grown rapidly since. I have constantly noticed that incubation
of the solitary egg does not begin seriously till three or four days after
the hen lays, and therefore it behoves one not to have any birds in the
same aviary which jump in and out of boxes and baskets or like pulling
hay about. The first two eggs of this season were both cracked by some
tiresome giant Whydahs and Superb Tanagers jumping on them before
the hen Pigeon was ready to sit. Are we coming to the end of Mr. Le
Soeuf's importation of this charming bird, I wonder ? Odd cocks
from private aviaries appear on the market now and then and this
seems rather suggestive. Of other breeding this year there has been
none up to date, except for Talpacoti Doves and Budgerigars. The
weather was cold almost continuously up to mid-June, and there have
been several sad losses in the aviaries. Both my hen Superb Fruit

Pigeons are dead, and with them the hope of breeding a second species
of Fruit Pigeon, though they are dull, uninteresting birds, rarely
moving except to feed, when they stuff themselves to excess. Cayenne
Crakes (Creciseus cayennensis) most charming little birds of red and
brown, with ruby eyes, have built a nest like a football in a bush 3 feet
from the ground, and both sit in it all day, but never an egg. As they
are a first importation, I shall hope for better luck next year, as they
are almost certainly a true pair. Apart from Budgerigars, green and
blue, I put up thirteen pairs of birds for breeding in the spring,
distributed in three aviaries, and though I suppose it is a terrible
heresy to say this in the avicultural world, it has rather bored me to
devote all this valuable space to a few married couples that don't even
produce the thrill of rearing babies !
Two more aviaries, one devoted to smallish birds of Weaver size,
and the other entirely to odd specimens up to the size of a Touracou,
have given me far more pleasure. Such an aviary as the latter, con-
taining among other things Bobins, Spreos, Tanagers, a Pitta, Grackle,
Touracou, Bell Bird, Boiler and Sun Bittern, is always a joy to look at,
and an added delight to sit in when nearly all the birds are tame and
friendly and will come to the hand for mealworms or cherries, and the
goodwill and lack of fighting without the presence of the weaker sex
is really wonderful! Many birds have come here and gone again
after a trial; I do like birds with personality as well as beauty, and
find soft-bills far more engaging in this respect than seed-eaters.
Becent additions include a Bacquet-tailed Drongo (Dissemurus
paradiseus), most amusing and clever, a pair of tame Dusky Parrots,
and a White-backed Trumpeter. All the Trumpeters seem absurdly
tame, and mine spends all the working hours with the gardeners, and
when there is no one to garden with is usually to be found sitting by the
kitchen fire with the cook ! Warned by a fellow-member's sad
experience last year of poisoned Trumpeters, I have put wire netting
round all the seeding laburnum-trees, so as to keep mine out of
harm's way.

not long ago that he should draw attention to the merits of the weekly
paper Cage Birds , published at 54 Fetter Lane, London, E.C. 4. Cage
Birds is well known to most members of the Society, but there may be
a few who have not yet come across it. It has many merits, being an
excellent medium for the purchase or sale of birds, Nearly every
number contains at least one article which is decidedly readable and
often of great avicultural interest and merit. The post mortem reports
are very well done, while the lively personal criticism indulged in by
some of the correspondents on Canary breeding, provide a spice of
human interest and humour which may be lacking in the pages of our
more sedate Magazine !

Turnix blanfordi. A young one seen in a cage. K. H. Jones.
Birds near Wei Hai Wei. 1911, 685. A live female obtained in
1915 ; the following March, although alone, she started laying. On
31st March another female was obtained and put with it, and two
male Coturnix japonica. All lived in harmony till 16th July, when
one of the Japanese Quails was found killed, probably by the other.
The new Turnix began to lay in June (three eggs found 21st June)
and five more up to 6th July, all under-sized eggs ; on the 17th
a much larger one, on the 20th and 21st two more miniatures. On
the 23rd she had to be removed, badly pecked by the other Turnix.
When the Japanese Quail was left alone with the latter, it made
violent love and attempted to pair, but without any encourage-
ment from the hen. Nothing came of it. " I fed these Quail on
Kaoliang and small millet, and gave, besides, bread and milk and
insects when in season." J. D. D. La Touche. Birds of N.E.
Chihli. 1921, 10.

I have no record about any Spreo and feel confident that Mr. Ezra's
hope that his success is the first is justified, at any rate for Great Britain
and probably for the world, as until quite recently I believe that the
small importation Mr. Ezra mentions was the only one.
As regards the Abyssinian Weaver (Mrs. Dalton-Burgess) ; if this is
H. cucullatus abyssinicus (Gm.), I have no record of this species having
been bred, but Neunzig, in his fifth edition of Russ, records (p. 434) the
breeding of a hybrid, of which the female parent was H. abyssinicus.
The commonly imported H. c. cucullatus (Muller), which I have
also occasionally heard called an Abyssinian Weaver, has, of course,
been bred fairly frequently (first by Russ) both here and abroad.

Sir, -- I was much interested in reading whilst on holiday the
account of the nesting of Abyssinian Weavers in Mr. Burgess's aviaries
at Clifton, but is Mrs. Burgess certain that the birds are Weavers ? I am
inclined to think myself that they must be some species of Sparrow.
I have kept the common Abyssinian Weaver for years. The male
Hypanthornis abyssinicus, is a very much brighter bird than its mate,
and is heavily marked with black on the head and back, and could not
be mistaken for any of the other African Weavers. The hens have no
black about them whatever. These birds are indefatigable builders,
and I cannot think for one moment that they would give up this habit
and nest in a log. They nested here several years ago, but the young
were not fully reared. The eggs were long, oval, white with red specks.
The eggs, however, vary very much ; some I have from Northern
Uganda are pale blue, with brown spots, but none of the eggs in the
least resembles the eggs of any of the Cardinals. Another of the
Abyssinian Weavers that were imported about the same time,
September, 1923, was the White-eyebrowed Weaver, Ploceipasser
mahali. This bird is also a most industrious Weaver, and I do not think
that it would be likely to nest in a hole in a log. The sexes here are
alike ; their eggs I have not seen. It would be interesting if Mrs. Burgess,
would furnish a full description of these birds and of the young ones, if
she succeeds in rearing them.

WARBLERS, ROBINS, ETC.
By Hubert Astley
To Mr. Galloway's article on some of the European Warblers I may
add other species, most of which are known to aviculturists who keep
insectivorous birds ; although amongst those selected there are rarities,
desirable and beautiful, which seldom find their way to the European
markets. In Africa, several charming species of Robin-chats (Cossypha)
are yet to be imported, and of the genus Cittocincla , of which the well-
known Indian Shamah is a member, there are other species to be found
in Sumatra, the island of Labuan, Palawan, and the Phillipines.
Many of these Bush-chats, Robin-chats, Redstarts, Robins, and
others, have a great attraction and are easily tamed ; all will eat some
good insectile mixture, with an addition of fruits and insects.
Let me mention a few.
The Great Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus turdoides) is very occasion-
ally to be obtained in England as a captive bird, but it breeds in Central
and Southern Europe, and winters in South Africa. It is also known
as the Reed Thrush. A species which would do well in an aviary where
there could be a thick growth of bamboos and reeds, with a pool of
water. Its song is melodious and varied, but has the harsher notes of
the family mingled amongst the sweeter ones.
The Indian Great Reed Warbler (A. stentoreus) is also a resident in
Egypt and Persia. It breeds in Cashmere, Nepal, and other localities
in the Himalayas, and in Ceylon. The colouring is much the same as
in the European species, the upper parts olive-brown with a slight
shade of rufous ; under parts, pale rufous brown.

Cetti's Bush Warbler ( Cettia cetti) represents a small group which
have melodious voices, but poor powers of song. Five of the species
are found in the Himalayas, and four in China and Japan. Cetti's is
resident on both shores of the Mediterranean. Upper parts, rich russet-
brown, with greyish-white eye-stripe ; lower parts white, shading into
ash-grey on the sides. The wings are rounded.
The Tailor Bird (Sutoria sutoria), so called from its interesting
mode of building its nest in the cup of two leaves sewn together to
form a purse. It occurs throughout India and Ceylon, breeding in the
plains, and to an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet. A small bird, 5 inches
in length. General colour above, bright olive-green ; the crown of the
head, pale brick-red ; eyebrow, sides of face, and under surfaces of
body, yellowish-white.
The Blue Wren ( Malurus cyaneus). This is selected as a species of
a most fascinating genus, which has occasionally, though rarely, been
imported from Australia, and was successfully bred by the late Mr.
Reginald Phillipps in a small backyard in West Kensington (London).
There are several species, all extremely beautiful and dainty. Blue
and black ; blue and white ; blue and chestnut, etc. Tiny birds, with
longish tails cocked upwards. They are delicate, and require plenty of
live insect food, fresh ants' cocoons, etc., but with careful attention, as
Mr. Phillipps proved, they will thrive. The Blue Wrens are as beautiful
in their movements, form, and colour as any birds on earth.
American Blue Robin, or Blue Bird ( Sialia sialis). Owing to the
strict and righteous protection of this lovely bird in the United States,
it is very difficult now to procure the Blue Bird in England, or France,
etc. Years ago one could see cages full of them in London bird-shops,
but now only by a special permit from the authorities in N. America
can they be imported. It is a wise precaution, much as aviculturists
in Europe long to possess so lovely and charming a bird, for when one
writes of " years ago ", one also recalls cages full of Turquoisine
Parrakeets and other lovely species of the genus Neophema, as well
as Paradise Parrakeets, and now they are almost done for in their own
country.
The Blue Birds are hardy, and with a good roosting-house can winter
out of doors without artificial heat. They breed readily in covered

nesting-boxes, but, especially when they have young, they require,
in addition to a refined insectile mixture, live food : grasshoppers,
mealworms, and such like.
There is nothing more lovely than a male Blue Bird, his upper parts
of pure cobalt, his breast the tint of red earth, and when he is courting,
opening and closing his wings, and uttering his low sweet song, he is a
very joyous sight.
Blue Birds should not be kept in an aviary with larger insectivorous
birds, Thrushes, etc., for they may be bullied, and when they have young
the live food would be taken from them to a great extent. Their call
note is melodious, although there is a sadness in the tone.
This bird is rather larger than the Robin Redbreast, of a stouter
build and shorter in the legs ; indeed, the Blue Bird is not " at home "
on the ground.
Chat-robins (Myrmecocichla) . This genus comprises a small group
of birds which connect the Chats with the Robins, and must not be
confused with the genus Cossypha (Robin-chats).
Chat-robins inhabit rocky and open ground. Five species are found
in South Africa, two in Abyssinia, one of which goes to Palestine, and
one in N.W. India.
M. melanura (Temminch's Chat-robin) breeds in Palestine, and is
said not to be migratory.
Canon Tristram found it at Engedi, etc.
White-capped Redstart (Chimarrhornis leucocepkala) . An ex-
tremely handsome bird, inhabiting the entire Himalayan range from
Gilgit, occurring throughout Western China to Kansu ; and also as
far south as the second defile of the Irawady River.
This bird is larger than the European Redstart, and male and female
are alike.
General colour, blue-black. Crown of head and nape pure white.
Sides of face, neck, etc., and chest, blue-black ; breast and under parts,
rich chestnut, as well as the rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail; the
latter is tipped with a broad black band.
I have had this fine Redstart, but did not find it very robust, yet it
should be hardy enough. It is very Chat-like in demeanour.
The Indian Redstart (Ruticilla rufiventris) winters in India, etc., and

breeds in North China and Mongolia, etc. It is very nearly allied to
the European species, and much like it, but the under parts are a
uniform chestnut, and richer in colour, not becoming paler on the
under tail-coverts.
Blue-headed &amp;apos;Redstart ( Ruticilla coerulocephala) breeds in the pine
districts of N.E. Turkestan, Afghanistan, and the range of the Hima-
layas.
A very pretty bird. Roughly described, the male has a blue-grey
head and nape, with black round the eyes and on chin and ear-coverts.
Body black, with white on the wings. Belly and under tail-coverts,
white.
The Corean Robin (Erithacus komadori ), called also the Loo-choo
Robin. A very charming and lovely species, and most rarely imported.
The male has the general colour of the upper parts, orange-chestnut;
forehead, lores, chin, throat, cheeks, breast, and flanks, black ; the
feathers of the flanks margined with white ; under parts, white.
This bird has a very sweet Robin-like song, and in captivity
becomes very tame.
I first saw one years ago when I was judging foreign birds in the
Horticultural Hall in London, and after I had finished my work, on
gaining access to the catalogue, found the lovely little bird was priced
at #5 ; upon which I rushed to the Secretary's office and secured it,
much to the disgust of its owner, Mr. Alfred Ezra, who at that
time I had not the great pleasure of ranking amongst my friends, as I
have ever since ; whilst he, as a beginner in aviculture, was unaware
that such a rarity would be seized upon by a greedy fellow-aviculturist--
and I supposed that he wished to sell it ! Such an opportunity will
not occur again !
The Japanese Robin (Erithacus akahige). A true Robin, and not to
be confused with the so-called " Japanese Robin ", which is not a true
Robin at all, but rather allied to the Tits ( Liothrix luteus).
E. akahige strongly resembles the European Robin Redbreast, but
is altogether more orange-russet, including the tail. The lower breast
is slate-grey, very dark where it joins the bright chestnut of the upper
breast. An extremely pretty bird. The species breeds on the high
mountains of Japan, and is said to be resident on the islands. It is
also found in N.E. China.

The song has a family likeness to that of the Redbreast, and the size,
demeanour, and general style are similar. I possessed a beautiful male
bird, which used to come out of his cage and fly about the room, perching
here and there, and singing his sweet song.
The Indian Blue Robin ( Erithacus brunneus). This species breeds
on the Himalayas from Cashmere to Sikkim, and on the Neilgherry
hills, wintering in the plains of India and in Ceylon.
Male, general colour of upper parts, dull dark blue. Forehead,
cheeks, and ear-coverts, black. Eye-stripe, white. Wings and tail,
brown. Under parts, orange-chestnut, shading into white on the belly.
The species has also been placed with the Redstarts as Ruticilla cyanea.
The Siberian Blue Robin (Erithacus cyaneus) breeds in Eastern
Siberia from Lake Baikal to the Amoor ; and winters in North India,
China, etc. A lovely bird, which one desires. General colour of upper
parts, dull dark blue ; brighter on the forehead and crown.
At the base of the bill, on the cheeks and ear-coverts, black, shading
into dark blue on the sides of the neck. Wings and tail, brown, suffused
with dark blue. Under parts, pure white.
The Indian Ruby-throated Robin (Erithacus, or Calliope pectoralis)
breeds in the pine-districts of Turkestan and throughout the Himalayas
from Cashmere to Assam.
General colour of upper parts, uniform dark slate-grey. Lores,
black; eye-stripe, white. Chin and upper throat, glossy scarlet.
Cheeks, lower throat, and upper breast, dull black. Belly and under
tail-coverts, white.
The female is earthy-brown and greyish-white. A species much
to be desired, as is also the Siberian race ! These two are also known as
Ruby-throated Warblers.
The Eastern Nightingale (Daulias philomela) breeds in Eastern
Europe, extending into South Sweden and Central Russia. The
colouring is less russet than in the well-known Nightingale of
Western Europe and England, and the bird is somewhat larger. Its
song differs, and is not as superior and liquid in rendering. It is
perhaps better known to aviculturists as the " Sprosser ".
The Blue-throated Warbler (Cyanecula suecica), also classed as
Erithacus (cf. Catalogue of the Birds in the British Museum).

The Blue and Kuby-throated Warblers seem to the outward eye to
approach the Pipits and Wagtails in their demeanour, having longish
slender legs, and walking actively on the ground. The Blue-throat
breeds in Central Europe, passing through Southern Europe on migra-
tion, and wintering in Palestine and North Africa.
Upper parts, brown ; eye-stripe, white or buff ; chin, cheeks, throat,
and upper breast, metallic cobalt-blue, with a pure white spot in the
centre of the lower throat. The blue is banded with black and chestnut.
Under parts, whitish.
There is another species, which has a chestnut spot instead of a
white one. The latter breeds within the Arctic Circle.
They have a sweet song, and are very attractive and graceful.
Thamnobia cambiensis. A Robin-like bird from Central India,
northwards throughout the plains, and the Lower Himalayas.
I think this bird has been called the " Indian Brown Robin ", but
there seems no settled name in English. Male, general colour above,
earthy-brown ; a large white wing-patch. Upper tail-coverts, glossy
blue-black. Sides of face, ear-coverts, and under surface, glossy blue-
black ; lower abdomen, bright chestnut. A very active bird, and
inclined to be shy ; but certainly attractive.
There is another species (T. fulicata) from Central and Southern
India and Ceylon, which has the upper parts glossy blue-black instead
of brown.
Indian Dhayal-bird (Copsychus saularis). A well-known favourite,
with the appearance of a miniature Magpie, and usually misnamed
" Dial Bird ". Its range extends all over India and Ceylon eastwards
to Assam, and to Pegu.
C. musicus is Indo-Malayan, and differs slightly in the extent of the
white on the tail, etc. Dhayal-birds are invariably tame, and although
their song is not as melodious as the Shamah's, it is very sweet and
varied.
The female is dark grey where the male is glossy purplish black.
There is also a Javanese Dhayal-bird ( C . amcenus) which is black
below as well as above, with grey flanks.
The Indian Shamah (Gittocincla macrura). As many aviculturists
know from experience, this bird is as near perfection for a caged pet

as any bird can be. The one fault I find in its colouring is the pale
flesh-colour of its legs and feet. I always want to dye them black, or
even scarlet ! As it is, they look anaemic. But the Shamah is anything
but that, and will live in captivity for 11 or 12 years, singing beautifully
all through his life ; and if he has a mate in an aviary he will breed
and help to rear a brood. It is hardly necessary to describe his colouring.
The female has a much shorter tail, and is olive-brown tinged with grey
where the male is glossy purplish-black ; and in place of his rich chestnut
under parts she has pale rufous-fawn.
The Shamah inhabits Southern and Central India ; Sub-Himalayan
region westwards from the Ganges to Assam, through the Burmese
countries to Siam ; Cochin China and Hainan, down to Java.
This bird merits the title of " mocking bird more than others.
I have had several species of the Mimidse (Mocking Birds) and have
never heard any of them mimic as does the Shamah, who, owing to this
gift, often spoils his natural song by introducing the vulgar chirruping
of sparrows and other unmelodious sounds ; and this species has also
a habit, at any rate in some individual birds, of repeating some tire-
some mimicry over and over again, ad nauseum ; but when a male
Shamah in perfect feathering throws up his long tail and bursts into
song, giving out his own rich notes, nothing is more admirable.
White-capped Bobin-chat ( Cossypha albicapilla) . This species is a
native of Senegambia and perhaps of Senegal. Slaty-brown above ;
lower back and upper tail-coverts, bright orange. Entire crown of head
and nape, white with narrow brown margins to the feathers. Cheeks
and sides of neck, dull brown. Under surface, bright orange, as is also
the tail, except for the two central brown feathers.
This bird has also been included as a Cittocincla.
The Cape Eobin-chat ( Cossypha caffra). A species of South Africa,
from the Cape Colony to the Transvaal, which has been imported not
infrequently.
It has a certain resemblance to a Eedstart in colouring, but is longer
in the tail. A sweet songster, which becomes tame in captivity.
Inclined to be pugnacious in a mixed collection, and is very agile on
the wing. As a cage bird a solitary male is an attractive pet, and one
in my possession flies about my sitting-room taking his bath, and he is
a great bather, on the floor.

The Two-coloured Robin-chat (Cossypha bicolor) inhabits South
Africa from the Knysna to Natal and the Transvaal, ranging to the
Zambesi and Central Damaraland. It has been called the " Noisy
Robin-chat ", from one of its titles, C. vociferans ; why, I do not under-
stand. But if it comes to that, does one understand half of the strings
of trinomial appellations which are fastened to bird-skins in museums ?
But it is difficult to give this bird a concise and distinguishing name in
English, for there are several species of Robin-chats which are orange
on the under parts as is this one, so that I have merely translated its
Latin name, although it is not strictly only two-coloured, for its black
face, slaty-grey head and back, and orange under parts at once strike
the eye ; the tail being orange with central black feathers. It is not
in the least " noisy " or " vociferous The call note is a soft rattle
not unlike the " P-r-r-r " of a Nightingale, and the song is extremely
sweet in tone. It is a species which becomes exceedingly tame in
captivity, and lives well. There are some sixteen species of the genus,
all African and, I should suppose, all desirable.
Yon Heuglin's Robin-chat (N.E. Africa to the East Coast of the
Zambesi) is said to be a fine songster.
C. imerina is found on arid plains in Madagascar. Some of the
Robin-chats are about the size of an Indian Shamah, others are smaller.
C. cyanocampter (Gold Coast) has upper surface olive-brown shading
in orange, and bright rufous orange above the tail. Head, nape, and
face, jet black. A white eye-stripe. Shoulder patch of verditer-blue.
Under surface, bright orange, as is also the tail, except for the two
central dark brown feathers.
This must be a lovely bird, to judge by its skin, and skins never give
one anything like a full idea of a bird's beauty, for to an aviculturist
it is a lifeless flattened-out bunch of feathers, with shape, movement,
and eyes gone.
Townsend's Solitaire ( Myiadectes townsendi). The subfamily of
Myiadectes has been placed as having an affinity to the Mocking
Thrushes, but they bear a resemblance to the Flycatchers in their short
broadened bills and bristles.
Their range is from the Pacific Provinces of the United States, and
throughout the whole of Central America into the Andes of Venezuela,

Colombia, and Peru. I have possessed a Townsend's Solitaire, and found
it delicate but attractive.
Total length of the male, 8 inches.
General colour, ashy-grey. Round the eyes a ring of white, and
the greater wing-coverts are tipped with white. The legs are short.
The Solitaires have beautiful voices, very penetrating and sweet
in tone, with the timbre of a flute or " piccolo ".
Some species are found on some of the islands of the West Indies,
San Domingo, St. Vincent, Jamaica, Martinique, etc., where their
beautiful notes are heard in the forests.
The Jamaica Solitaire might possibly be obtained. It is undoubtedly
an attractive genus, but, at the same time, I should say that they are
birds which would be sluggish in a cage. The one I had was certainly
so, and they need wing-exercise.

It was in the early spring of 1922, that gossip was rife in one of my
aviaries. The birds were beginning to imitate the humans. A gay
bachelor, a Barraband Parrakeet (Polytelis barrabandi), had taken up
with a hen Queen Alexandra (P. alexandrce) who had a lawful husband.
What the birds' Daily Mail had to say I do not know, for I never had
the opportunity of seeing it, but I can imagine the meretricious photo-
graphs and the headings as conspicuous as if half London had been
destroyed. At any rate, the male Queen Alexandra was routed by the
Barraband and ignored by his mate. The result was two young
hybrids, one of which was found dead in the nest when well feathered
and too decayed for museum purposes. The other, whose portrait
now appears, painted by Mr. Gronvold from life, survived. For the
first year, this bird was almost uniformly green, with one or two red
feathers on the under parts, the tone of the green inclining more to
that of a Barraband than a Queen Alexandra ; and then the trans-
formation commenced, until by the autumn of 1923 this hybrid
appeared as in the painting.
Now, for the benefit of those who are not acquainted with the

colouring of the Queen Alexandra Parrakeet, let me point out that in
that species there is no red whatever. The throat is delicate rose colour,
the forehead forget-me-not blue, and the under parts pale greenish
dove-grey.
As to the Barraband (the male parent), the forehead, chin, and
throat are bright yellow, with a narrow band of scarlet across the
throat, the rest of the plumage being rich green ; but the female Barra-
band, like the Queen Alexandra in both sexes, has pink in the underside
of the outer tail-feathers, as the hybrid has. Whence then this astonish-
ing flow of scarlet on the under parts of the hybrid, and scarlet also on
the forehead ?
On the throat, there is a slight, a very slight, veiling of the rose-
colour from the female parent, but the scarlet is underneath. The
throat cannot be described as pink. The wings show a strong inclina-
tion to take after the Queen Alexandra in colour, but the lighter green
on the shoulders is not nearly so brilliant in the hybrid, neither is there
any sign of the spatulated feather which the male Queen Alexandra
grows in the third primary (flight) feathers. Unfortunately, the
Barraband, the male parent, died, and I fancy he was by no means
young, so that I was unable to have another brood raised.
As to the large area of scarlet on the breast and under parts of the
hybrid, does it mean that it has reverted to the colouring, or part
colouring, of some remote ancestor ?
Only the rather speckled appearance of the breast reveals the cross
in blood, but there are moments in certain attitudes when in profile the
bird's breast looks almost purely scarlet ; and then it might be a pure
species.
The voice is that of the Queen Alexandra ; at any rate, the tone
resembles the mother's rather than the father's.
Both parents are Australian, and both are quite evidently species of
the same genus (Polytelis), in spite of later nomenclature whose authors
delight in changes and the bestowal of fresh titles.

It may interest readers, and stimulate them to do the same, if I
give a short account of some additions to my collection.
I was presented with a pair of lovely Woodpeckers, acquired from
a fellow-member (the Hon. Mrs. Charles Winn), which are evidently
Melanerpes flavifrons from S. Brazil and Paraguay. Eight inches in
length.
The back and tail, black with white stripes down the centre of the
former. Male : forehead, chin, and throat, golden yellow; a broad
black stripe behind the eye ; crown and nape, crimson.
Under parts, whitish fulvous, the flanks barred with black, and a
crimson patch on the breast and abdomen. The female lacks the red
on the head, which is deep blue-black.
Unfortunately the crimsons and yellows have very much faded, but
in spite of that these birds are extremely attractive. I have them in an
open wire cage, with logs, and it is amusing to see them bobbing behind
these and peeping round the corner.
Has this species been represented in the London Zoological
Gardens ?
I purchased two species of Cuban Ground Doves ( Geotrygon caniceps),
which might be called the Mauve Ground Dove ; is extremely handsome.
These Ground Doves have an especial attraction in having longer legs
than the more arboreal species, so that they walk gracefully, occasion-
ally halting with a little bob-curtsey.
The Mauve Ground Dove, if I may so name it, is the size of a Turtle
Dove, but stouter in contour. The head is well rounded. The colouring,
sketchily described, is as follows : forehead, greyish-white, gradually
merging into a darker grey ; neck, back, and breast, metallic mauve-
violet, with dark blue and purple reflections on the rump. Sides, flanks,
and under tail-coverts, cinnamon. Bill, pale horn colour, with basal
part dark carmine ; eyes, red.
The whole effect of the bird is a beautiful mauve-violet, with a head
of delicate grey.
Geotrygon chrysa might be perhaps named the Moustached Ground

Dove, on account of tlie whitish band below the eyes from the base of
the bill.
The general coloration is reddish-cinnamon above, with lovely
emerald on the head and neck, and metallic-violet on the back, overlay-
ing the foundation of red-cinnamon. Throat and breast, pale vinaceous
with a greyish tinge. This Dove inhabits Cuba, the Bahamas, and
Florida Keys, and is slightly smaller than G. caniceps. A very lovely
species.
Mr. Alfred Ezra most kindly gave me a Grey Ouzel (Merula unicolor).
Habitat, India. The whole of the plumage is grey, rather on the light
side ; the beak and legs, yellow. This Ouzel is a good size smaller
than the European Blackbird, and is said to sing sweetly.
Last, and by no means least, Monsieur Delacour very kindly pre-
sented me with three males and two females of the lovely species of
Crested Wood Partridge (Rollulus roulroul) which he brought from
Singapore on his way home from Indo-China.
Sir William Ingram bred the species many years ago in the South of
France.
The size of a Californian Quail, the male is deep glossy blue-black,
with a crest, after the style of a Crowned Crane, of rich reddish-chestnut;
forehead white ; beak, skin round eyes, legs and feet bright red. The
female lacks the crest and is deep sage green, with chestnut wings.
These birds are fed on a good quality of Pheasant meal, with
boiled rice, and fruit of any kind, with the addition of ants' eggs and
mealworms. They cannot stand cold damp.
They have a pretty, soft whistling note, and an attractive habit
of putting out one foot and withdrawing it sharply in order to scratch
up any food. Monsieur Delacour was also good enough to bring me
a pair of Tree Partridges from Indo-China, which is a new subspecies
(Tropicoperdix) discovered by him. The coloration is a rich mottled
reddish-brown, the legs and feet being yellow. Not every day does an
aviculturist have the pride of possessing an unnamed species !
I also acquired two Lesson's Amazon Parrots (Amazona lilacina)
through the kindness of Miss Knobel, who wrote to tell me of their
arrival at Gamage's. Indeed, there were three of them. This species is
extremely rare, and is represented in the British Museum (Natural

History) by one skin. I bad one a few years ago, but it died through
having received an injury to the head before I received it, and I think
I sent the skin to the Museum in Leicester.
My present pair is immature.
This species is green for the general part, like most of the
genus, but has a red forehead, which colour extends in a narrower line
over the eyes. The crown of the head is mauve with black margins
to the feathers, and the cheeks are bright greenish-yellow. It is not
so large a bird as the Yinaceous and Diademed Amazons, which also
have the red forehead. Has any member acquired the third that
I did not purchase ?
The species is evidently inclined to be gentle and tame, for my
couple behave in much the same confiding manner as did the one I lost.

The Editor of the Avicultural Magazine is requiring copy and he
hopes that anyone having something of interest to say about birds and
their keeping will do their duty to the Society by giving their experience
for the benefit of others.
Now I feel a little nervous at putting my experiences on paper, for
in the first instance I'm not a literateur, hence my writing will be crude,
and in the second instance I'm only a novice in the keeping of birds,
my experience only extending o /er a period of nine or ten years, and
only the last two in keeping foreign ones ; so that it looks rather like
presumption on my part coming forward to say anything, and as if
I should rather be sitting at the feet of Gamaliel, in the form of some
one of our more learned members.
Being a great lover of birds, beasts, and fishes, the desire for more
intimate acquaintance with at least the former and the fact that my
eldest son in pre-war days kept a few Budgerigars, these being left in
my charge when he made the supreme sacrifice, were the reasons for
extending the aviary and keeping other species.
I soon found it was not wise to keep Budgerigars and small birds,
either foreign or otherwise, together. I had one old hen whom we

christened Cleopatra owing to her ability to attract young cocks at
the expense of any young hen in the aviary and her way of dealing with
refractory husbands (she killed three) ; she was, however, an excellent
mother, but owing to her murderous propensities she had to be disposed
of. Then, owing to the mischievous habits of the others, and their
bickerings, the few British birds I had with them never seemed to
thrive, and as then I did not feel like making another and separate
aviary, I let the Budgerigars go and have never kept any since.
In 1914 the first large outdoor aviary (old aviary on plan) was
commenced on paper, a description of which, with the aid of a plan,
will enable anyone with a taste for joinery and construction to do as
I have done with the help of my younger sons.
You will notice that the aspect is south, backed by the house, and
more or less shut in by trees about 20 feet high : but even with this
favourable spot we suffer from the high westerly winds so prevalent on
the Lancashire coast (we are only 2 miles from the sea). So, though
it does not get the sun all day, the new aviary for foreign birds was
erected to leeward of the old one occupied by British birds. This
situation has a further advantage, in that a garden water-tap was in
close proximity, so a supply of good water is always obtainable, in my
opinion a sine qua non in bird-keeping.
Now as regards construction. Having experienced some trouble
with timber supports for the wire netting (rotting between wind and
water at ground-level, regardless of the use of creosote or solignum),
galvanized iron tube of 1 inch bore was used, this being cut and screwed
in suitable lengths by the makers, so that when put together the
structure took 6 ft. widths of \ in. 19 gauge wire netting, which could
be laced together and so make a neat job and no gaps. A coat of dark
grey paint over all finished the j ob. The shelter and feeding house of the
old aviary needs little description, the photographs will supply this.
It is sufficient to say that it is constructed of J in. weather-boards,
rabbeted. The windows open outwards, one is hung from the top and
is used for ventilation only and when open, covered with a frame of
wire netting, the other is the door of access for cleaning and feeding,
and to prevent birds coming in and escaping there is a small glass door
hung at the top and held open by a cord operated from outside, and, of

course, let down when the birds are to be kept out. As I feed only in
this house, I have no trouble with vermin, in the shape of mice, as
there is no seed scattered around on the ground. Then I find this
arrangement very useful when I wish to capture any bird ; by a simple
arrangement of strings I can close this trap-door when I see the bird
I require is inside feeding, and capture it with a hand-net, through this
same door from inside the aviary, and so there is no fear of escapes.
The wooden cupboard underneath is for the oil-stove used when the
temperature falls below freezing point and on damp and foggy days.
The bottom of the shelter being covered with sand and air-ducts passing
up through this and the floor, the place is kept dry and warm and
thorough ventilation is secured by openings under the ridge of the roof
at each end, the trap-door being open enough for birds to pass in
and out freely.

After one or two experiments in keeping foreign birds in the old
aviary, I came to the conclusion that up here, at any rate, it was
necessary to have much more warmth and comfort for them than was
to be obtained in this position, although I have in good health three
Javas, two Saffron Finches, three B.W. Mannikins, and a Zebra that
have all stood 10 degrees of frost in this aviary. Nevertheless, I thought
it was not playing the game with them, and as I wanted to keep others
of a more delicate nature, the foreign bird-house was constructed.
This, as can be seen from the photograph, is a much more
substantial structure, and was built by the local carpenter at a cost of
#45. It is placed on 6 inches of granolithic concrete, and built of 1 inch
weather-boards, roofed with match-boards and asbestos tiles, and lined
with asbestos sheets, leaving a cavity of 2J inches between outside and
inside. This is to conserve warmth in winter and cool in summer.
The lights are rough plate-glass, except the two windows facing the dark-
room which are sheet-glass, so that the birds can be watched from the
dark-room (which, by the way, is used for many other purposes besides
photography). The interior is divided, 3 ft. 6 in. being partitioned off
at the door end for shelves for cages, seed, and other utensils and
necessaries in connexion with bird-keeping. The floor is covered with
fine gravel and sand, except the hollow depressions, ljin. deep, occupied
by the bath and its water channels. While mentioning water and
baths, it might be as well to say that deep-sided receptacles for baths
are both dangerous and disliked by small birds, so my baths are made
to slope from 0 to 2 inches, which I find is as deep as even a Blackbird
requires. Then, if running water can be managed, another point is
gained. It is most instructive to see my Bullfinches go for the running
water while I'm cleaning the bath out, because I turn it on smartly
while doing so, and all come and bathe in the clear running stream as
soon as I'm out of the way. A jolly sight on a warm day to see Bull-
finches, Goldfinches, Chaffinches, Bramblefinches, Redpolls, Linnets,
Siskins, and Canaries all splashing, or, having splashed, preening them-
selves in the sun.
Returning to the Foreign Bird-house, as this is built for wintering
birds the problem of temperature had to be considered. I have a theory,
I don't know how right it may be, that a change of temperature is

good for animal life, and so it is not necessary to keep a bird-house at
a regular temperature, in fact, it is harmful; and that a temperature
of not less than 45 degrees Fahr. for an hour or two at night does no
foreign Finch any harm, so long as it does get a warm up during the
twenty-four hours, and they can have reasonable exercise by flight. So
when cold weather comes on us, as it usually does, the first fortnight of
November, I start the Eippingill oil stove at dusk and get the
temperature up to between 55 degrees and 65 degrees ; then about
8.30 a.m. it is turned out and if the temperature falls no harm seems
to come. Ventilation must be complete, and is supplied by holes close
up to the ridge of the roof, covered with perforated zinc. Feeding is
always done in the house ; hence most of the birds are tame and used
to me being close to them, and so can be watched with ease and greater
interest. The feeding table being on the partition and about 3 feet from
the floor. About the first week in May the window to flight is opened,
and all the inhabitants of the Foreign Bird-house are allowed free access
to the large flight, 18 ft. by 12 ft. by 9 ft. ; in which are allowed to grow
weeds, grass, and any shrub the birds will let alone. Berberis, prunus,
iris, monkshood, and several other plants seem to get on all right there,
and do the birds no harm. I was a bit doubtful about Aconite, but I
see no ill effects. I find that gorse is very much liked by the small
Finches, and so thick bushes are cut and packed in the corners--a
prickly job, but evidently a joyful one to our little friends, for they are
in it and on it in no time after fresh gorse has been put in, as is done
once or twice during the summer, as the old gets withered and dirty.
Now as to the inhabitants of these aviaries. The reader must
remember I'm a novice at bird-keeping, and so my collection is a very
modest one of birds (I have gathered from books) that are reasonably
hardy.

Whydahs, Orange Bishops, and Orange-cheeked Waxbills. Forty-one
birds in all.
The feeding is varied, as much greenstuff, weeds from the garden,
as I can find time to collect. Soft food, Spratts' Lark-food, wdth their
cod-liver oil food, and Capporus egg-bread, a cupful when mixed with
boiling water each morning is divided between the two aviaries. Seeds :
canary, white millet, sundowner, hemp, linseed, niger, teazle, and maw,
in dwindling proportions from canary, the staple food, down to maw,
a pinch, every other day. They each have a hopper of canary to go at
as they like, and giving them fresh every other day only makes them
clean up pretty thoroughly. Live food is supplied when I can get it,
not much trouble in summer, but they go without in winter.

A comfortable rustic bench in the shade of a luxuriant weeping-
mulberry is placed in front of our aviary, and it is here much time is
spent watching the antics of its occupants. Lest I give too great an
impression, I hasten to add that the aviary is 8 by 8 by 7 feet high,
and is placed on the south side of the house where it has abundant sun-
shine throughout the day ,with necessary shade provided by surrounding
trees and bushes. It extends part way into the basement, forming
an inside cage 3 by 4 by 3 feet high. It is here that the food is
placed : automatic seed containers and food for the soft-billed birds.
This consists mainly of banana, over which is sprinkled Mocking-bird
food, occasionally mixed with grated carrot, chopped hard-boiled egg
and bread and ant eggs. Other fruits are placed in a separate dish,
and once a week a small container of honey is added to the menu.
Practically all of the soft-billed birds enjoy a sip of it.
A trumpet vine and wistaria grow in the aviary against the house,
but they are protected with wire netting as the Parrakeets had started
to strip the bark. There is also a currant-bush and some grass and
weeds, and a naturalistic cement pool with fresh running water. Some

branches are placed so that the birds have ample room for flight. The
entrance is through a glass-covered vestibule.
On one side is a section where a Yellow-backed Cacique (Cacicus
persicus) is installed. He is the largest bird in the collection, and
owing to his natural disposition must be kept separate. Years ago,
when reading Waterton's Wanderings in South America, his description
of the bird aroused a desire to possess one, and after several months of
waiting, one was secured, and most interesting it has proved to be,
though somewhat noisy. He is a handsome bird, about the size of a
Hill Mynah, and is glossy black with the hinder part of the body yellow,
as is a large spot on each wing and the basal half of the tail. His eyes
are of a bright blue, and his bill sulphur-yellow. His vocal gymnastics
are astounding, varying from a finely drawn out silvery whistle, to a
loud explosive squawk, with numerous moans, shrieks, and imitative
sounds, from the yelping of a puppy to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow.
My collection consists of, beside the Cacique, from one to four each
of the following: Green-rumped Parrotlets, Japanese Robins, Indigo
Birds, Canaries, Yellow-winged Sugar Bird, Brazilian Scarlet Tanager,
Black Tanager, Violet Tanager, Blue Tanager, Red Siskin, Paradise
Wbydah, Hermit Thrush, Baltimore Oriole, Red-vented Black Bulbul,
and a Gold-fronted Green Bulbul. The latter is known as that in the
trade here, but I notice that over there you call them Fruit-suckers,
which is certainly more fitting. Among others that I have had are the
Java Nonpareils, Silver-beak Tanager (Ramjphocelus dimidiatus),
Ceylon Hanging Parrots, Shell Paroquets, Bee-Bee Paroquets, Gold
Finch, Zebra Finch, Strawberry Finch, Gouldian Finches, Waxwing,
Queen Whydah, and Black-capped Bulbul.
Perhaps the most attractive bird we have, combining friendliness,
beauty and song, is the Green Bulbul. From the time of his arrival
he has been enchantingly tame, and is most generous with his mellow
notes of great variety. As a flycatcher he is expert, and frequently
hangs inverted from his perch to secure some titbit. The Black Bulbul
is a handsome bird, with his expressive crest, but his song does not
amount to much--a two-toned whistle is the best that he can do. He
is friendly with the Japanese Robins, and often sits close to them while
they go over his plumage. I have had the Robins for five years, two

males and a female, and they certainly are the most active of all.
They seem to delight in plaguing the little Red Siskin, a peevish little
beauty who resents the approach of any bird with chattering and
lowering and fluttering his wings. The Robins ignore his unfriendli-
ness, and hop all about and over him. His song is ambitious, but of no
particular quality, and is delivered like that of the beautiful Indigo,
a better singer, with much gusto. The latter is beautiful in both
summer and winter coat--the former shades of brilliant blue, later
changing to rich brown with a little blue on rump. The female is
plain brown in colour.
The sleek Hermit Thrush, which early in the season delighted us
with his silvery, liquid caroling, is silent now. He has a habit of stamping
his foot and raising his tail.
With so many birds one can hardly expect any to breed ; therefore,
it was with surprise that I found my female Green-rumped Parrotlet
with five eggs. Though there were several inviting receptacles placed
for nests, she chose a dark corner behind a log in the inside cage, and
laid her eggs on the bare sand. Four hatched, and all were feathered
when the parents deserted them, with the exception of the oldest,
who owed his life to his persistence in demanding food. The remaining
three died from starvation probably.
Of the four Tanagers in the aviary, the Blood-red Scarlet is, of course,
the most attractive. His plumage is like plush, with a wonderful sheen.
Unfortunately, he does not get over his wildness, and will not remain
quiet long enough for one to study his beauty. The glossy Black
Tanager is a nice bird, with a much better disposition than his chestnut-
coloured mate, who had to be disposed of because of her bad temper
and nagging ways. It is just recently that the Black Tanager has begun
to sing, and I have had him over a year. His song is sweet and pleasant
to hear.
It took the Paradise Whydah iust one month (July) to change from
his Sparrow-like coat to his regal nuptial robes. The long tail is not yet
fully developed, but at that he is two months ahead of time, as last
year the change took place during September. Does this mean an early
winter ? One of the Sugar-birds was in immature plumage when it
arrived in May, and blue feathers here and there promised the blue

beauty to come, but suddenly it began to moult, and now it has assumed
its winter dress, so evidently it requires a year to change.
All of our birds are not in the aviary, however. A little Song Sparrow
has its nest in a hedge not 10 feet away, and a House Wren, an incessant
singer, has a second brood in one of the little houses that are about,
this one in a paradise-tree near the house. When the mulberry is
covered with its ripe fruit, Robins, Cat Birds, Red-headed Woodpeckers,
and Flickers (Golden-winged Woodpeckers) come to feed--sometimes
all four species will be there at once. All of these birds nest close by,
and so do a colony of Purple Martins in a nearby Martin house. These
are attractive birds, and we are always glad to welcome them in the
Spring. The American Goldfinch and Yellow Warbler (both known
locally as Wild Canaries) are here all summer. A Yellow-billed Cuckoo
has its nest in the dogwood shrubs. It is a flimsy structure, and from
beneath one can see the four blue eggs. His note is a croaking cuk-cuk-
cuk-cuk-cuk-cwk-cwk, the middle syllables uttered rapidly. At one time
I saw one nearly choke on a huge green caterpillar.
Being near the river, there are many birds which ordinarily would
not be seen in so congested a neighbourhood, such as the Belted King-
fisher, whose rattle is heard all summer long, and the Gulls and Terns--
the former staying with us all winter. A little Screech Owl took up its
abode in the Woodpecker-house one winter, and reappeared the follow-
ing fall to take possession, but a Grey Squirrel--a wanderer probably
from the woods 2 miles away--came and ousted him, then found the
house unsuitable, and made his home under the eaves of a neighbour's
house. The Owl did not come back.

The following extract is taken from a most interesting letter by
Dr. Casey Wood :--
The Parrots of Fiji are renowned among ornithologists, and they
have often been described in the literature of natural history, even
if they are not quite as popular among colonial planters because of
their love of such forbidden fruit as bananas, coco-nuts, and pawpaws.
Surely, however, something can be forgiven such lovely creatures.

Perhaps the most elaborately decorated of them all is the Yellow-
breasted Parrot (Pyrrhulopsis personatus), 22 inches in length. He is
probably much rarer than he was twenty years ago.
The writer was unable to locate a single caged specimen among
the hundreds of pet Parrots to be found on the various islands, although
he inserted a request in the Fiji Times and Herald asking owners of the
Yellowbreast to allow him to see their pets. In several instances he
discovered that this fine bird had been caught and tamed, but had died
after a caged or confined life varying from five to fifteen years. Their
places were not filled because no young Parrots were on the market.
It is quite different with the Crimson-breasted species from Kandavu,
a large island happily free of the mongoose and but little cultivated
by whites. Here the beautiful Pyrrhulopsis splendens, although un-
protected by law (on account of his fruit-eating propensities), easily
holds his own in spite of the large numbers captured and sold by the
natives to tourists and others.
Although not as elaborately decorated as the Yellowbreast, P.
splendens, it is a very attractive species, whose length is 18 to 20 inches,
with the head and all the upper surface crimson, across the nape
a wide, deep blue band ; back, rump, upper tail-coverts and wings
bright green ; primaries and their coverts, as well as the outer secondary
feathers, bine ; lastly, as a striking contrast, the eyes are deep orange.
It is a question whether this species was not at one time confined to
Kandavu, and whether the individuals found on Yiti Levu, for example,
were not introduced from the former island. Be that as it may, wild
examples are rare outside Kandavu. This one of the four Pyrrhulopses
is the favourite cage-bird in the Colony, not only because of the
abundant supply of young birds but because of their talking powers,
their display of affection and intelligence, and because they practically
never scream nor make other disagreeable noises when in captivity.
Although their rather shrill monotone is a common sound in the
Kandavan forest, they seem to abandon loud notes when in captivity.
They are fair talkers and whistlers, but in exhibiting these
accomplishments do not make themselves a nuisance to the neighbour-
hood, as do some of the other large Parrots. Some years ago the
Samoans were in the habit of making excursions to Fiji to shoot

" Kakas " and other birds of bright plumage, that they might weave
the feathers into their mats. It is also said that they were not averse
to trapping or buying live birds that they might pluck regular crops
of feathers from the unfortunate Parrots. This cruel practice continued
until the arrival in the Colony, as Governor, of that sympathetic
and well-known naturalist, Sir Everard im Thurn, who put an end to
the scandal. The large Fijian Parrots build their nests in hollow trees,
and generally 20 or 30 feet from the ground. The writer discovered
one nest in a decayed stump less than five feet high. The central hole
was eight inches across, and the next was a very primitive affair,
consisting only of the debris that had accumulated in the bottom of
the excavation. There were three nearly round, dirty-brown eggs
which, when cleansed, became uniformly white. They measured
one and three-sixteenths by one and three-eighths inches.
The other species of this interesting genus are peculiar to (or the
types hail from) Taviuni, Yanua, Levu, and Koro respectively. They
differ from the Kandavan variety mainly in the amount of blue on the
nape of the neck, it being entirely absent in the first-mentioned, and
seen only as an inconspicuous streak in the other two.
In about one per cent of the long-tailed Fijian Parrots, cases of
what is called heterochrosis occur ; that is, the red, green, and blue
feathers in the birds' plumage to a greater or less extent change to
yellow and white. Although this colour alteration is abnormal, it
frequently is seen in perfectly healthy subjects of great intelligence
and vivacity. Moreover, the alternations often result in colour
combinations far surpassing in attractiveness the plumage tints of the
normal Parrot.
The chief glory, however, of Fiji's avifauna is her wild Fruit Pigeons
and Doves, several of which are found only on the islands of the Group.
Limited space forbids more than a passing mention of two of the larger
Pigeons--the Nutmeg Pigeon (Globicera pacifica), so called from
its favourite diet, with an iridescent, wine-coloured plumage, and
a remarkable stomach lined with homy spines to grind off and pulpify
the arillus or " mace " from the wild nutmegs on which he subsists ;
and the equally beautiful Chili Pigeon, or " Euve ", that flourishes
on red-hot capsicums.

Of the wonderfully feathered little Fruit Doves much has been
written ; indeed, it is quite impossible to describe their gorgeous
colouring ; they must be seen to be appreciated. Male and female
are quite differently feathered in all the species, the male Golden Dove
(Chrysoena luteovirens) having an olive-yellow cap fringed with yellowish
colour, the remainder of the body being mostly clothed in a covering of
lovely, separated, glossy, lanceolated, golden feathers. He has a yellow-
green tail, while the female is greenish throughout--indeed goes under
the popular name of the Green Dove. Then there is the Crimson-
capped Dove ( Ptilinojpus jperousei) that looks white as it flies, but is
really a remarkable study in dark purple, bronze-green, and white,
the first and last colours predominating.
This beautiful Dove sports a crimson cape over his shoulders,
and the white feathers of his breast are split at their ends, the resulting
points being tipped with red. The female is less elaborately adorned,
but is yet extremely attractive. Still more wonderful in its truly
flamboyant attire is the far-famed, though rare, Flame-coloured or
Orange Dove ( Chrysoena victor) whose flight through the forest has
been aptly likened to " the passage of a rocket on a dark night ",
The male bird has a velvety, olive-coloured cap with a bright yellow
border, the rest of the body-covering, both above and below, being
composed of closely applied, hair-like feathers of a brilliant, glossy
orange-red; " flame-coloured " describes it more accurately. The
entire plumage of the female is rich green, yellowish-green on the head
and throat. The writer has never seen a more impressive study
in feathered monochrome than is presented by this beautiful little
Dove. Finally, one of the most attractive of these Columbidse is the
Fijian Ground Dove (Phlogoenas stairi ), intermediate in size and
perhaps beauty between the smaller Doves and the larger Pigeons.
The general coloration of this species is dark brown with bronze and
purple reflections. He has a genuine " coo " as his call note, and is
still to be found in those localities that are free of the mongoose. In
Yiti Levu some individuals still survive. They have learned to avoid
ground-feeding as much as possible, and to build on the small branches
of high trees to which the enemy cannot climb. A noticeable character
of some of these Fijian Columbidae is their " barking " notes. In

BREEDING OF THE AUSTRALIAN CRANE
{GRUS AUSTRALASIANA)

<bodyText confidence="0.999219888888889" page_id="56200675"  page_num="251" year="" vol="">
For some fifteen years I have had a pair of Australian Cranes, known
as Native Companions, which have had eggs every season for the last
seven years. In former days at Benham Park, near Newbury, another
pair had its yearly clutch, and in 1901 mv accounts appeared in the
Field and Country Life, in which I wrote that the eggs were fertile
on more than one occasion, but that Jackdaws always managed to fly
off with them. I found the broken shells with every evidence of the
fertility of the contents in veins adhering to the skin.
My present birds have been deprived of their two eggs, for that is
the complement with Cranes, time after time, from the same cause,
and nothing could be done as far as their hatching the eggs themselves
was concerned, for they live in a meadow of eleven acres, and would not
suffer confinement in a covered enclosure, or, at any rate, would not
rest in one after enjoying such liberty.
The hen has laid as many as three clutches in the spring and summer,
but has a tiresome habit of walking away from her nest when anyone
passed through the meadow, and the Jackdaws were on the look out !
The first clutch this year (1924) was taken as usual, but on some past
occasions she managed to sit out her time, and then the eggs were
unfertile, so that I had begun to give up all hopes of any young Cranes.
Then she laid again almost directly, sitting in the long grass intended
for hay. The time came for cutting, and instructions were given for a
fair-sized piece of grass to be left round the nest. The Cranes became
nsed to the cutting machine, and she would only stand up when it
came rather near, both birds trumpeting loudly. At the end of May,
before the grass was all cut, it was thought that the usual tale of
waste of time was to be told, when on the last day of that month, the

birds were seen together away from the nest with a baby Crane between
them. The other egg proved to be unfertile.
The birds were most solicitous, and if anyone approached, the female
stretched her wings over the little one, whilst the male marched up and
down nearer to the intruder, tearing up grass ; or if they were on ground
where the hay was cut, snatching mouthfuls of it, which were tossed in
the air as if he wanted to hide the baby. The little Crane looked at
first rather like a Gosling, and was a dull grey with yellowish down on
the head, the legs and bill short. When I threw Pheasant meal to the
parents, the female picked up tiny morsels, and did so very cleverly,
considering the size of her long bill, the baby pecking them from her,
and uttering low piping squeaks.
When it rained very hard, she held out one wing as an umbrella,
under which the baby stood. A charming sight. The young bird
after the first fortnight grew rapidly, legs and bill lengthening at the
same time, and by the end of August at a distance it looked almost the
same size as the parents, but the flight feathers were not strong enough
for use ; not that it could fly, for it was pinioned when quite small,
which meant a two minutes' operation of removing a small projection
of gristle !
The parent birds, like all my Cranes, live out entirely with no
shelter of any kind, and whilst in spring&amp;apos; and summer they very largely
find their food in the shape of worms, beetles, mice, etc., in winter
they have a regular supply, twice a day, of broken dog-biscuit and
maize.
The Australian Crane has bred in the park of Woburn Abbey, but
otherwise I fancy I am correct in saying that the species has not reared
young anywhere else in captivity, at any rate not in Europe. At Woburn
the parents on two occasions attacked their young, and one was rescued
from a murderous onslaught. This happened with the first brood. In
the case of the second, the birds were not so unnatural, perhaps because
the mating season was over.
This summer has been very favourable for the rearing of my young
Crane, as the ground being so moist has produced plenty of worms,
so that it was hardly necessary to feed with meal.
When only a few days old, the baby crane liked to stand knee-deep

THE BREEDING OF THE PIGMY DOVE
(CHAMMPELIA MINUTA)
By Herbert Bright
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9837584" page_id="56200677"  page_num="253" year="" vol="">
I have often wanted to have some of the small Pigmy Doves men-
tioned in Dr. Butler's book, but until recently have never seen them
offered for sale, though I have had small Doves sent to me which were
called Pigmy Doves, but which proved to be something different.
Consequently I was very pleased to receive three pairs of the real little
Pigmy Doves from Mr. Chapman. They were healthy, but had plucked
each other a good deal, and one or two were almost bare of feathers.
I found them rather given to the habit of plucking each other in a very
spiteful way. As soon as I could, I took them out of the large cage
they were in, and gave them entire liberty in my large aviary, where
there are a number of all sorts of Doves. They appear to be quite as
hardy as any of the other Doves. I added two more pairs, and believe
they are all still there. All are in perfect condition, in spite of the fact
that I often see them picking and chasing each other about, but no harm
seems to come of it. I think three pairs have nested and reared young,
but as the young are very tiny, helpless little things when they leave
the nest, although fully fledged, they have disappeared with two
exceptions. I picked up one of the earlier ones which I had seen flying
and feeding itself on the floor of the bird-house. Possibly a cold night
had killed it following a cold wet day. I have now one or two which
are fully reared, and have been flying about, feeding themselves, and
sleeping in the bird-house for a couple of weeks, so may fairly lay claim
to have bred them successfully at last. The first pair laid in a basket

remaining pair hatched and reared two young ones which left the nest,
but after a day or so, I saw no more of them. The pair whose nest
had been destroyed had built again, and had selected the upper side of
a coco-nut husk which was hanging from the roof of the aviary--a most
unsafe looking site for a nest, and I never imagined anything would
come of it. However, two young were safely reared ; of these, one
disappeared shortly after leaving the nest. The other I saw about for
some days, and saw it feeding itself, but later saw no more of it, though
my bird man reported having seen it. Both these pairs nested again
in the same places, and both hatched two young. In one nest I found
two dead young, fed and partly fledged, but quite cold ; in the other nest,
on the husk, two young were fully reared, and I have seen the young a
good many times flying about and feeding themselves, and sleeping in
the bird-house at night. I think there is also another rather younger
bird about, so I feel quite satisfied now that I really have one or two
young ones about fully reared, and, as I understand they have not been
previously bred, may put in a claim for a medal. The nest is a more
substantial one than many of the small Doves construct, composed
of small twigs and coarse grass, and forms a neat, round nest. When
built on a previous nest, it makes quite a big pile. I have seen another
nest out of doors, with young ones in, very well hidden against one of
the aviary posts, but do not know what has taken place there yet, as I
have not been to look. From my experience they seem to be free
breeders, and rear their young well, but need dry warm days when
the young leave the nest, which makes it somewhat a matter of luck if
the young are fully reared or die from exposure. They will stand
a certain amount of it, as I saw two young ones perching through the
whole of one soaking wet day on the low~er branches of a hollv-tree.
They eventually found shelter in a small shelter-shed, and the following
day were in the large bird-house, where they have several times been
since.
[If there is no earlier record of the successful breeding of this
Dove, Mr. Bright is entitled to a medal.-- Ed.]

THE BREEDING OF THE OLIVACEOUS THRUSH
(TURDUS OLIVACEUS )

<bodyText confidence="0.9990083125" page_id="56200683"  page_num="255" year="" vol="">
The Olivaceous Thrush is one of the commonest of the African
Thrushes, and it occasionally finds its way into the bird market
here. It is a handsome bird, about the same size as our Blackbird.
Colour above olivaceous, below buff. Both sexes are alike. I have
had three of four of these birds for some years now, but this is the first
year that any of them have shown signs of nesting. Towards the end
of April a pair in one of my larger aviaries, that I had always considered
to be two males, as both birds sang and were always quarrelling, com-
menced to carry building material, and a few days later I found a very
well-constructed nest in a laurel-bush. This was built exactly like a
Blackbird's, with a mud shell and a lining of fine grass. On 3rd May
two eggs were laid ; these were green, heavily blotched all over with
reddish-brown, and were about the size, and very similar in colour to,
some clutches of Ring Ouzels that I have had in my aviaries. On the
17th both eggs were hatched. The young were covered with long
yellow down. On the 22nd their eyes were open and the feather areas
were beginning to show. Both parents fed them well, the food taken
being bread and milk and crushed Melox. As they grew older we
provided earthworms, which the old Thrushes broke up for them in the
same way as do our English Thrushes. By the end of the month they
were quite big birds, and nearly fully feathered. My photo shows them
in the nest at this stage. On 2nd June they both left the nest. One
was drowned by the very heavy rain we had at that time, but the other
throve wonderfully, and is now bigger than either of its parents. In
colour it is brown above, throat white, breast and flanks pale buff
splashed all over with brown. In this immature plumage it looks very
much like an adult English Thrush, but is larger. In another aviary
my Kurrichane Thrushes--a closely allied cousin from East Africa--
have done nothing, although the cock has been singing splendidly,
and I believe them to be a true pair. An Olivaceous Thrush in another
aviary has been singing lustily all the Spring, but although the Dusky
Thrush with him is, I believe, a hen, she has made no response to his

In the summer of 1921, our member, Dr. Hopkinson, brought back
a number of these birds from the Gambia. They were out of colour
and apparently young birds, as the pair I secured did not come into
breeding plumage the next season. Last year the doctor brought back
another nice lot. and of these I secured two pairs. After wintering
them indoors, I turned them into two of my aviaries. A single pair
in one, and the other two pairs in another. I was practically certain
that the single pair was properly sexed, as one was a one-eyed bird
caught in the Gambia at a different season to the others. Early in
June this year, one bird in each aviary began to put on the breeding
plumage, and they w T ere very soon in full nuptial display, and busy
with nest building. Unfortunately, I lost the one-eyed hen, so that pair
were thrown out of commission. In the other aviary things went better,
as I saw one of the out-of-colour birds carrying nesting material, and
guessed that it must be a hen. The nest, which was built by the cock
and lined by the hen, was of the usual Whydah type, with a hole
on one side, and was constructed in a spruce, being well concealed and
sheltered from the rain by the leaves of nettle and convolvulus growing
through the tree. The hen laid two eggs, green heavily marked with
reddish brown spots ; these were larger and more richly marked than
those of the Yellow-backed Whydah from Uganda. The incubation
period was thirteen days. The one young one hatched was naked,
without noticeable down. It was fed in the early stages, by the mother
alone, upon wdiat insects she could catch. Afterwards bread and milk
and seed were used as well. In spite of the bad w T eather, the little bird
grew well, and when I went for my holiday on 1st August the feather
areas were already showing. On my return, a fortnight later, it had

left the nest and was strong on the wing. At the time of writing it is
independent of its parents. I should judge from its size that it is a
male.
It is at present exactly like its mother, except that it wants the yellow
patch upon the shoulders. Several years ago I bred two hybrids from
a hen East African P. macrura. In one case the father was P. ardens,
and in the other Urobrachya axillaris. The hybrid from. P. ardens ,
when it came into colour, could not have been distiuguished from my
present males P. macrura , except for a slightly more slender body.

The following account of the breeding of the Lesser Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo has been received through the kindness of Mr. Seth-Smith :--
" It may perhaps interest you to hear of my success in breeding
Cacatua sulphurea. My birds had previously, as I believe I informed
you, hatched two young, but they failed to keep them alive beyond a
couple of days. On the present occasion, three eggs were laid, one of
which was clear, and two young were hatched eight weeks ago. Incuba-
tion lasted at least 24 days. Owing to the inaccessibility of the nesting-
box, and the ferocity of the parent birds, I have had to be content with
very rare inspections of the progress of rearing, but I managed to get a
sight of the youngsters when about 8 weeks old, and found that they
were very bulky, had well-developed crests, but no feathers otherwise,
and only a little nestling down. The beaks were white, or rather a light
horn colour. The floor of the nest was clean. I fancy that the youngsters
will not leave the nest for at least another 6 weeks. The nest is in a
very large and heavy tool chest slung vertically by a single hook, and
rocks in the wind. The entrance is at least 18 inches above the floor
of the nest. I give the parents a large number of peapods, which seem
to suit them, likewise sultanas and green wheat in the ear, which is
relished.
" As regards incubation, the cock bird sat mostly during the day,

and he has taken quite as large a share as the hen in this respect, as
well as in the feeding. It will be of interest to see whether the young
are of opposite sex as in Pigeons, and whether the astonishing difference
manifested by the sexes in the colour of the iris will be apparent when
they first leave the nest."

obtained, but died in about a fortnight. " The young bird for
some months preferred food taken away from the old bird to that
provided for itself. It would scream violently and attempted to
snatch away a half-plucked sparrow from its parent, which would
endeavour to protect her property by folding her wings over it,
but after a short tussle the young bird always obtained possession
of her prey. They spent most of the day and all the night in a box
in their cage. To this box they would retire directly after a meal
and lie down. Before the box was put into the cage they used
to lie on the bottom after a meal, as well as at night, at which time
they were very hard to rouse . . . These birds had a strong and
very unpleasant ' garlicky ' smell. They were sent home to the
Zoo . . . where they soon died. An illustration of them appeared
in the Field (xci, p. 141, 1898)." La Touche and Bickett.

and " if spoken to it invariably turns its head slightly and replies
by a rapidly repeated slight clapping of the bill accompanied by
a rapid blinking of the nictitating membrane, the eyelid remaining
half-closed all the time. It will sometimes keep up a long friendly
conversation in this way, if one continues to reply, never, however,
opening its eyes or rousing itself in the least ... It will usually
hold up its food in one claw and eat somewhat after the manner of
a Parrot ... It is very tame and greatly enjoys having its head
scratched . . . standing quietly with its beak on the table while
the operation is in progress, and uttering a contented little chirrup,
very different from its usual wearisome hiss. It is particularly
fond of bathing, completely submerging its face and shaking its
head vigorously from side to side, splashing the water in all directions
and incidentally sprinkling its plumage. When five months old it
still differed from the adult "... in plumage. Swynnerton,

an interesting American book, Propagation of Wild Birds , by Herbert
K. Job, published by Doubleday, Page and Co., Garden City, New York.
It contains much useful information on the management of Waterfowl
and gallinaceous birds, as well as practical hints on the trapping of
vermin. It is illustrated by numerous photographs.
Wildfowl of the World, by Frank Finn, recalls Miss Pose Hubbard's
Ornamental Waterfowl, which most people interested in Ducks and Geese
have probably read. The book contains a description of practically
all the Ducks, Geese, and Swans known to science, and is therefore very
useful, although there is in it very little information about the birds
from an avicultural standpoint.

By M. Legendre
The Accentors are a group of birds which have always been difficult
to classify. On account of their doubtful characteristics they were
at one time placed among the Larks, and later among the Warblers,
with which they have certainly many points in common : modern
nomenclature has to our mind correctly placed them next the Monticolce.
They are small, round-headed birds, with pointed beaks, slightly
furrowed above the nostrils ; they have dark plumage, alike in both sexes.
They are insectivorous and also seed-eaters. There are twenty-seven
species of Accentors among the Palearctic fauna. Asia is the
home of the greater number, and only two species are found in England
and in France : the Alpine Accentor ( Prunella collaris) and the Spotted
Accentor or Hedge-sparrow ( Prunella modularis).
The Alpine Accentor, Alpine Warbler, or Rock Lark, is best known
by its common name of " Pegot ". The Abbe Yincelot, in his curious
book entitled The Names of Birds explained by their Habits , derives
Pegot from " pee ", an expression which in Haute-Gascogne signifies
stupid, dull; or else from an old French word, " pege," meaning pitchy,
blackish. Bailly says in his Ornithology of the Savoy that the fowlers
of Chambery call this Accentor " Mauriennais " because it is very
abundant during summer in the Savoyard Alps. Others call it by this
name because, when it leaves the mountains for the valleys at the

approach of winter, it is the precursor, according to them, of numerous
Mauriennais who emigrate at this time.
The sexes are alike, except that the female is rather paler ; the head,
neck, back, and breast are greyish, with brown markings on the back ;
throat white, speckled with brown ; belly and sides reddish, mixed
with white and grey ; wings and tail blackish brown, a double row
of white spots on the wings ; length, 18 centimetres.
The Alpine Accentor is found throughout the mountains of Central
and Southern Europe : it is common in the Alps and the Pyrenees.
As it inhabits lofty places, the advent of snow drives it little by little
down to the valleys, where it may be seen among the houses. For
reasons which are unknown to us, certain birds sometimes, contrary
to their usual custom, wander far afield. Specimens of this Accentor
are recorded from the neighbourhood of Marseilles (J. l'Hermitte),
from Gard (Crespon), Aveyron (Dr. Dalmas), Charente (Beltremieux),
Anjou (Yincelot), Sarthe (Gentil), Indre (Rollinat), Haute-Loire
(Moussier), Loire-Inferieure and Calvados (H. Gadeau de Kerville).
Degland has recorded its capture in the Fiord, and two specimens were
obtained from Belgium in a garden in Anvers during the severe winter
of 1835. It has also been taken in the South of England.
I will describe the habits of the Alpine Accentor in a few lines.
During the summer it inhabits mountainous regions, just below the
eternal snow line, living at an altitude of from 3 to 4,000 metres ;
together with about ten other kinds of birds, such as the Golden Eagle,
the Ptarmigan, the Greek Partridge, the Wall Creeper, occasionally the
Wheatear, the Dipper by the watercourses, and the Yellow-billed Chough.
While hopping among the rocks, inspecting every pebble, the Accentor
warbles its joyous song ; sometimes it descends to the valley for part
of the day, for it flies swiftly and easily in the manner of the Redwing.
It is not timid, but seems indifferent to the presence of man and it
can be seen hopping about among tourists or shepherds, undisturbed
by their movements. In the same way it may be seen in the Pyrenees,
in the Cirque de Garvarni, regardless of the multitude of excursionists
perpetually arriving or departing. Agile and graceful, it seeks its
food, which is composed largely of insects, but it also eats berries and
various grass seeds, of which last it is very fond. Towards evening

it returns swiftly to the mountain tops, where it passes the night
and when morning comes it greets the sunrise with its joyous and
lively song.
In May, the Accentor prepares to nest and pairs may be seen running
together among the boulders and fluttering round the rocks. At this
time of year, the male bird, perched on a low pine branch or on the roof
of some little stone cottage, sings with great fervour to delight his mate.
They go to nest in a hollow beneath a rock or under the eaves of a hut.
Both birds work at building a very large nest, like that of a Bock
Thrush. It is a deep cup composed of grasses and wood fibres mingled
with moss. The interior is lined with feathers, hair, and down. The
clutch consists of 4 to 5 uniformly pale blue eggs, measuring 0-022 by
0-015 centimetres.
Both male and female incubate. The young are fed on worms,
small smooth caterpillars, and soft-skinned insects. Later they are
also given seeds of Alpine plants, which their parents crush before
administering to their brood.
Incubation lasts fifteen days and the young leave the nest before they
can fly at all; they keep to the neighbourhood of their nest, and at
the least sign of danger creep into and hide in the smallest fissure.
When the young birds gape it is curious to note the intense red purple
colouring of the mucous membrane and pharynx, a colouring which
fades by degrees as the birds grow. Our colleague and friend,
Dr. Gromier, who was the first to draw our attention to this peculiarity,
says, concerning a brood which he captured under stones poised above
the little green lake of Plau de 1'Aiguille (Chamonix): " Was it intended
to guide the parents when feeding their young in this dark hole, or to
frighten away intruders, as the nestlings open their beaks wide when
alarmed % Perhaps both."
The young remain with their parents for some time, and run about
the rocks and small bushes, during which time they learn to find their
own food, though still occasionally fed by the old birds.
The family separates in July, and the old birds go to nest again.
By this time the season is advanced and the temperature higher.
Accordingly, the Accentor builds its second nest in the same locality,
but higher up, nearer the snow. The second clutch is always smaller,

three to four eggs : then rearing recommences and finishes in August.
This second family breaks up in September.
Autumn arrives, the birds have moulted and now possess warm
thick plumage which comes down their legs like sleeves. They wander
about in little companies of three or four, or even singly ; they find
belated insects among the rocks or in fissures. They turn seed-eaters
in winter, and when deep snow drives them from the heights they
gradually descend into the valleys. In hard frost or storm they
visit houses. When food is scarce they venture on to the roads and
into gardens and yards. They eat anything, even leaves of wild thyme.
They are confiding birds, living as they do in solitudes and remote
places. They can be approached very closely, and fall easy victims
to any snare set for them. Unfortunately, their winter diet gives them
a special flavour which is much appreciated by gourmets, consequently
they are the prey of numerous shooters in the valleys of Haute-Provence.
The Alpine Accentor soon becomes reconciled to captivity, and can
be kept for several years in a cage. Its song recalls that of the Crested
Lark, but is superior. It is composed of very varied phrases, and its
flutelike notes are full and clear. In captivity it is fed on insectivorous
food and mixed seeds, crushed hemp, maw seed, etc., grass seeds, are
considered a delicacy.
It is very easy to rear young birds from the nest. This remarkable
bird is lively and active when taking food, but as soon as it is satisfied
it becomes quiet and even lazy, and remains motionless for a long time
on its perch. It is always said to be very gentle and to live in perfect
harmony with other birds. But what may be true of it when at
liberty is not so when caged. It is a bird which loves solitude and
quiet, and in a cage or even a small aviary it frequently quarrels with
its companions. It has always given me trouble in this respect,
especially an old cock, an excellent songster, of which I was fond,
which was determined to live alone. He first declared war against
a phlegmatic Bohemian Waxwing, the most peaceful of birds, and
flew at him with angry cries. When the Waxwing was removed
he attacked a pair of Wrynecks, but they defended themselves by
assuming their snake-like attitudes, the usual tactics of this species.
The Wryneck flattened itself against the ground and, lengthening its

neck and tongue almost indefinitely, spread out its tail and began
its comical gestures, puffing out its throat, throwing back its head,
erecting its crest, and uttering weird hisses. These contortions
discomfited the Accentor, which ran round its enemy but dared not
come too near the snake-like bird. Dr. Gromier had two Accentors
which pounced on the backs of his Golden Orioles and pecked their
skulls like birds of prey.
If two cocks are put together they fight furiously. For this reason
this bird should either be caged by himself or be kept in a large aviary
where he can avoid his fellow-captives. There he can sit solitary
on a secluded perch and perhaps dream of the snowy peaks where he
was born.
In the Corsican mountains this species is replaced by Prunella
collaris tschusii (Schiebel). Though this bird does not differ greatly
from our Accentor, it approximates more nearly to the Balkan form
Accentor subalpinus (Brehm).
The Hedge Accentor or Sparrow ( Prunella modularis L.) is much
smaller and common throughout Britain, France, and the greater
part of Europe. It breeds as far north as Norway and even Finland.
It migrates twice in the year, but many individuals stay all the year
round, and are met with everywhere and at all seasons.
It has been given many names, " Spotted-songster," " Winter-
warbler," " Bush-hunter." In England it is called Hedge-sparrow,
but it does not deserve the title of Winter Nightingale, by which it
goes in parts of Germany.
In some French provinces it is called Straw-scratcher, Greenling,
Turnip-biter, in Savoy ; Redling, Browny, Bush-feeder, in Normandy ;
Russet, in Morhiban.
This bird, about 15 centimetres in length, resembles a Warbler which
has donned Sparrow's livery. The head and neck are ashy-grey,
the cheeks have a reddish mark, the belly is dirty white, wings and
tail brown, edged rust colour. The female is slightly smaller than
the male. '
The Hedge Accentor is a gay, lively bird, which may be seen
hopping through bushes by the side of roads and gardens. It is also
met with on high roads, examining their borders, heaps of wood, and

ditches, creeping or running so quickly and quietly that it is sometimes
taken for a mouse.
Bold and confiding, it allows itself to be closely approached, and it is
also easily snared. It feeds on insects and seeds, but in winter is as
omnivorous as the common Sparrow. Its song is very simple, but it
delights us when most other singing birds have left.
In mountainous regions it nests in May, either the beginning or end
of the month, according to the altitude; but it breeds much earlier in
the plains. I found a nest containing a full clutch on the 25th of March,
1919, in Normandy. The nest is rather large, a deep thick cup, and is
composed of moss, twigs, and hair. It is built low down in a thick
bush, a heap of faggots, or a small tree. The four to five eggs are
pretty greenish blue, rather lighter than those of Redstart, which
they otherwise resemble. The egg measures 0-019 by 0-014 centimetres.
In captivity this bird should be fed on the same food as the Alpine
Accentor--insectivorous mixture and mixed seeds. Almost as soon
as caught it becomes reconciled to captivity, and grows very tame.
It is easily bred in an aviary, and even a solitary female will sometimes
produce eggs. I had one which laid regularly every year in her seed-
vessel. Fanciers have made use of its readiness to breed, and have
succeeded in pairing hen Accentors with Robins.
A sub-species of Hedge-sparrow was discovered in France in 1919
by the American ornithologist Harper --Prunella modularis mablotti
(Harper). It is found in the eastern Pyrenees (several specimens
have been taken in Ariege). It is rather larger than the type, and
usually much lighter in colouring. The exact abode and range of
this species would repay investigation.
Prunella montanella (Pall) is a species inhabiting Western Asia. It
is very widely dispersed, and is found over wide areas. It has been
met with in Hungary and Italy, and it might well be found in the
Eastern Pyrenees also.

By H. D. Astley
It must be some six years ago, I fear I did not keep any note of the
date, that I received from the late J. D. Hamlyn a long travelling-
cage, divided into compartments, which contained Indian birds sent on
approval. Out of one of these compartments there fluttered and
scrambled and climbed on to my shoulders a Woodpecker, evidently
an immature bird, clamouring with open mouth to be fed, and without
a moment's hesitation I said to myself, " I shall keep you at any rate."
His colouring was duller than it is now, as faithfully depicted by
Mr. Gronvold. The upper parts were of a duller green, the crown
less varied with reddish brown, the nuchal crest not so pure a golden
yellow, the under parts more smoky grey. The bird is a male, for the
female has the cheeks, chin, and upper throat rufous. This Wood-
pecker is about the size of the European green species. Total length,
13 inches.
It is found in the Himalayas as far west as Masuri, extending into
Assam and Cachar, etc.
Dr. Jerdon found it throughout the great range of mountains,
from Assam to Burmah, and observed it at Darjeeling, chiefly in the
zone from 2,000 to 6,000 feet.
It is resident.
In captivity this Woodpecker is very hardy, and mine, which is
in a large wire cage with decayed logs, lives almost entirely in a loggia
open to the garden, except when the weather in winter is very severe.
Mine is a bird with much character ; but the one thing that really
frightens him is a handful of flowers or branches carried near him.
I have held up a bouquet of sweet peas or roses, etc., to him to try
to convince him that all is well, but it is useless; he is quite terrified.
If, however, a stranger puts up a hand to his cage, he will sidle down
a log and investigate with his long worm-like tongue, especially if
there is a ring or a wrist-watch, when he quivers the tip of the tongue
rapidly all over the object. Sometimes he is pugnacious, and will

drive at one's hand with dagger thrusts, and can hurt with that beak
which digs holes in the trunks.
In the spring-time he drills his call for a mate, and I have watched
him do so when standing by his cage. The movement of the head
and beak is extraordinarily rapid, and the accompanying sound can
only be imitated wdth one's tongue at the back of the upper teeth--
Br-r-r-r !
It is a sound which carries a long way, as one knows from the
Lesser Spotted Woodpecker in England, a very much smaller bird.
The Yellow-naped Woodpecker has a loud vocal cry which rather
closely resembles a Jackdaw's " chah ", but it is clearer and more
resounding.
When I first had this particular bird, he delighted in coming on
to my arm and up on to one of my shoulders, but having so many
birds I was unable to keep this up, and he has gradually ceased to
find my person so attractive. To me it was sometimes trying, for he
would tickle not only my neck and down behind my collar with his
long tongue, but would also explore the inside of one's ear !
Owing to this tameness, I lost him once for five days. Bishop
Trollope (in Corea) was my guest, as well as the late Vicar of Llandovery,
Mr. Edmondes-Owen (he it was who acted as especial guardian of the
last remaining Kites in Wales), and I brought the Woodpecker into
the room to show to them, not noticing that one of the windows was
slightly open at the top, after I had shut down two others. The
Bishop put up a hand towards the bird, which suddenly took fright,
and before we knew where we were it had, quite by chance I believe,
flown straight out of the window through an open space of not more
than 8 inches.
There was great distress on the Bishop's part, who blamed himself
for the mishap, but I, really believing what I said, assured him that
I should soon recover the bird, as he was so tame and attached to me.
That was on a Saturday. He was once seen on the Sunday in an
apple orchard half a mile away.
On the Monday, the Vicar of Llandovery, on leaving, turned to
me at the front door, saying : "You will recover the Woodpecker :
I do not guess it, I know it." But although I trusted in Celtic clair-

voyance, I shook my head when Wednesday came and no sign of the
lost one. And then on the Thursday I was told a boy wanted to see
me, having found a strange bird at the foot of an apple tree about
two miles away. In the basket was my Woodpecker, apparently
at his last gasp, but I dropped some brandy down his throat and placed
the basket almost in the kitchen oven, and in an hour he was better.
The boy had quite by chance caught sight of a bunch of green feathers
lumped up close to the base of the tree trunk on the ground : the bird
had not been seen to move.
Although there are Green Woodpeckers, Greater Spotted and
Lesser Spotted, in the orchards and woods all round, my bird seems
to have been incapable of finding his wild food, and would undoubtedly
have been dead by the evening of the day that he was brought back.
I never saw any bird nearer death. Last year he again got out, his
cage door having been left open by an oversight, but that time, having
learnt by experience, he remained in the close vicinity of the house,
although he did not show himself until he was ravenously hungry,
when he flew down on to a stone wall by the aviaries on seeing my
steward, and finally came to him, hopped up an arm, and perched on
a shoulder.
His pleasure, when his cage was brought and he entered it, was
most unmistakable. He uttered little cries expressive of joy (for I
know all his different vocal tones), hammering at one of his logs, and
gladly taking mealworms from one's fingers. I wish the Duchess of
Portland, etc., could have been there to see !

If anyone were to ask me, " What is the best time in the breeding
season ? " I should reply that it is unquestionably at the very beginning,
before you have bred anything at all, and I should not be surprised
if more&amp;apos; than one aviculturalist were, on reflection, inclined to agree
with me ! How nice it is to go round one's collection in early spring
and admire one's breeding (?) pairs of the ensuing summer ! How well
and promising they look ! Each of them, surely, are about to become

the parents of large and healthy families, which they will rear to
maturity. There is nothing to hinder you from giving free play
to your imagination and indulging in the pleasing pastime of counting
your chickens before they are hatched. And then the breeding season
materializes, and hens get egg-bound and pairs won't agree, or display
weird and unexpected phases of mental deficiency in the conduct
of their domestic affairs. And some birds drop into early moult and
others have clear eggs and others lose their young, or have young
so weakly and deformed that they are not worth keeping. And so,
when autumn comes, out of the thirty or forty youngsters you were
counting on, you get a modest three or four and, since hope springs
eternal in the human breast, you settle down for the winter saying
to yourself, " Better luck next time ! "
After such a gloomy preface, readers of this article may expect me
to go on to describe a series of almost complete failures and disasters.
Well! it's not quite as bad as that, though to be sure very few young
birds are yet actually finding for themselves and there has been a fair
dose of the usual disappointments.
This season has been the first trial of the value, for breeding purposes,
of my new movable aviaries : it has not been a really fair trial, as
the birds were being constantly disturbed by workmen right up to
the middle of May, and a good many pairs had not been in long enough
to get thoroughly settled down. On the whole, the movable aviaries
have justified themselves : the bad winter and late, cold spring caused
a certain amount of trouble in the way of illness, as was only to be
expected, but there has been a great and encouraging drop in the
mortality from diseases not due to chill, and a satisfactory improvement
in the fertility of the eggs, while very few pairs of birds failed to go
to nest without any reasonable excuse at all.
The lutino-bred Bingnecks were the first to start. I had five
flying together in a fairly large aviary, four being two years old and
one three years old. As they were all still without rings, I was rather
uncertain about their sex, but judging by their behaviour later, I have
little doubt that there were two pairs and an odd female. Although
they have never known freedom, they are the wildest and most unsteady
birds in my whole collection. In February one of them took to a nest-

box and laid two eggs. I did not try and separate the pairs, partly
because it was very difficult to tell one bird from another and partly
because I seemed to remember reading of wild Ringnecks in India
breeding in colonies in old trees and in the roofs of houses. Also the
birds seemed to agree quite well, and I did not think there was much
chance of fertile eggs, for aviary-bred cock Ringnecks are apt to be
uncertain breeders even when fully adult. The nesting bird sat
steadily, but when I looked in the box after four weeks, nothing had
hatched. I took the eggs away and broke them, and was rather
surprised to find that one contained a well-developed chick, dead in
the shell. Some weeks later another of the Ringnecks took to a box
and laid two eggs, one of which in due course hatched, and I began
to have hopes of producing the beautiful golden bird which I had
been trying for for many seasons. Alas ! On looking again a few
days later I found the baby dead, its bitten beak and wings showing
that it had been murdered by the unmated hen or by one of the other
pair. Moral: whatever Ringnecks may do in a wild state, in con-
finement it is not safe to depart from the good old rule--one pair,
one aviary !
The next birds to nest were the Alexandrines. I have a beautiful
lutino hen, kindly given me by Mr. Ezra, but although she does her
best to oblige, persistent ill-luck has attended my efforts to breed from
her. The first year she had a nice-looking and attentive mate, but
her eggs were clear. The second year I was away from home, and the
man who was looking after the birds never gave her a nest-box until
she had started to moult. The third year I obtained a new cock :
he fell violently in love with a hen Great-billed Parrakeet at liberty
and entirely ignored the hen Alexandrine ; result, more clear eggs.
The fourth year the hen had another mate, the finest of the lot, but
she was upset by being moved to a new aviary and did not nest. This
year, in January, the cock Alexandrine bit his way out of the aviary.
As he stayed about well, and other cocks had proved good birds at
liberty, I did not trouble to recapture him, as I could easily have done,.
A few days later he vanished. Some friends about three miles away
saw him in their garden, but he did not stay long. Some time later
reports reached me of his appearance near Bosham, and later still

he was seen fairly regularly in the vicinity of Chichester. He seemed
to live in various places on the outskirts of the town, hut frequently
he would fly round and round the Cathedral, being apparently
interested in architecture. Goodness knows what he lived on, as
a Palseornis Parrakeet is not normally a bud-eater, as some Platycerci
eventually become when they have been kept a long time at liberty.
After a time, the wanderer was reported to come almost daily to
a certain gentleman's garden, and I got permission to send over a trap
feeding tray, with the hen in a cage to act as a decoy. He came down
and fed on the tray the same evening and I counted him as good as
caught, for once a strayed Parrakeet has been located and has come
to food, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred you have him safe and
sure. Next day I sent over the aviary attendant to effect the capture,
never doubting that he would be successful and would bring the bird
home before evening. But strange to say, he was never seen again
in that garden ; there was a last rumour of his appearance at Selsea
some time later, and then all news of him ceased ! So once again
I was left in the lurch with the breeding season fast approaching.
All efforts to obtain an acclimatized cock Alexandrine being fruitless,
I was obliged to ask for the loan of the Greatbill's admirer whom I
had given away to a friend the year before. When he arrived the hen
was delighted, and proceeded to feed him, an attention which he
accepted, but without enthusiasm. The hen Greatbill had died some
months previously, so there was no further risk of complications
from that quarter, but what must the idiotic brute of a cock do but
fall in love with the deceased lady's husband ! So while the hen
Alexandrine was preparing her nest, the cock and the Greatbill con-
ducted their unnatural courtship through the wire-netting, and once
more the eggs were infertile. Afterwards, by way of adding insult to in-
jury, the cock Alexandrine began to make advances to the hen and take
an interest in the nest, but it was too late and she had begun to moult.
The two lutino Ringnecks nested about the same time as
the Alexandrine. The first hen is now a very old bird and she
and her green mate have been several years in my collection.
Although a glorious colour, she is not very well shaped, and flies
rather stiffly and I think she must have been kept in a small

cage for many years before she left India. She is just the sort of bird
one would expect to get egg-bound, but although she nests each year in
March, she does not fall ill. Some time ago she narrowly escaped
a violent death, entirely, it must be admitted, through her own fault.
Like many ladies of her species it was her custom when not in breeding
condition to bully her husband in the most shrewish fashion. Generally,
the cocks put up with it very meekly, but the hen&amp;apos;s second mate
happened to be an exception. He stood it for a time, but at length
he rebelled, and he would certainly have killed her had she not been
rescued in a badly mangled state. For some years past she has been
living with another male, and although he gives way to her, she treats
him with considerably more restraint than she showed to his pre-
decessors : apparently she has not forgotten that the worm may
turn ! Towards other birds she is still pretty aggressive and she
particularly hates the tame cock Eock Peplar who flies about loose.
If he comes near her aviary she flings herself against the wire, forgetting
all fear of me in her anxiety to have his blood, and further expressing
her dislike and contempt by mimicking his call, a thing she does at
no other time. It really sounds like a piece of avian sarcasm !
This year she only laid two eggs, but both hatched and the young
birds, green as usual, have now been out of the nest some time.
The second lutino hen is a younger and finer bird and won first
prize at the last Crystal Palace show. She has, however, hardly the
depth of colour of the first and is what Canary breeders would call
a " buff ". Her first mate died last year, and I got another cock late
in the autumn to replace him. As he was not in very good condition
I thought it might be advisable to tone him up by a few weeks' complete
liberty. The experiment, however, was not a success, as after staying
a few weeks, he disappeared, either straying, or being killed by an Owl.
It looked as though I should be faced with the same kind of disappoint-
ment as I had with the Alexandrine, as the nearest approach to a
breeding cock Eingneck I could secure was a rather small and scrubby-
looking individual with some missing toes, who was said to have been
allowed a certain amount of flying exercise in a shed. However,
he proved better than his looks. The hen laid four eggs not many
weeks after his arrival, and hatched three. One chick was a tiny

and weakly little fellow and only lived three days, though his mother
did her best for him and fed him as carefully as his bigger brothers
or sisters. The two strong chicks were successfully reared and are
also green.
My Malabars were a disappointment, and I do not think that
the hen is a very robust bird, though she wintered successfully
out of doors after a brief illness in the autumn. They showed con-
siderable interest in the nest-boxes, as they did last year, and the cock
fed the hen at the entrance of the nest and did his best to persuade
or compel her to undertake domestic duties. But she would not
settle down to business and is now, no doubt, moulting. I have
since obtained a breeding hen, and if all goes well I should have better
luck with this pretty Palseornis next spring.
Stanleys were another failure. The original cock had become
barren from age, and I replaced him by a handsome-looking bird who,
however, I am now inclined to think, must have been sold to the dealer
by his previous owner because he was of no use for breeding. Anyhow,
the hen's four eggs were all clear ; when I removed them she nested
again immediately, and laid two more, but when she had been sitting
a fortnight she got a slight chill and as I was catching her to put her
in the hospital, she unluckily flew hard against the handle of the net,
and inflicted injuries from which she died. The second lot of eggs
were infertile like the first. I shall try to obtain a younger hen,
and hope that a winter at liberty may put the cock into better condition.
There is no risk of his straying, as a Broadtail, unlike a Palaeornis,
will never forsake a captive mate unless he does not know where she is.
A pair of Pennants at one time looked like nesting, but they were very
much disturbed by workmen all the spring and the hen came to me
with the reputation of being a shy breeder. They are very fine birds
and the cock was a great ornament to my garden while at liberty the
previous winter.
I have two Barnards, one of which belongs to the race with no
yellow on the breast. For a while I had faint hopes that they might
turn out to be a pair, though I was pretty sure they were both hens,
which proved to be the case. It need hardly be said that they were
madly keen to nest. Unmated birds generally are !

My aviary Brown's are likewise both females : I have a male ah
liberty, it is true, but he is too old to breed. I was patiently trying to
wean the hens of the inveterate fondness of their species for an April
moult and October nesting and I seemed to be meeting with some success;
moreover, through the kindness of a member, I obtained the loan
of a fine cock. Unhappily, soon after his arrival, a bitter gale from
the east, accompanied by hard frost, proved too much for the hens,,
and I had to take them in with slight chills. They soon recovered,,
but, from being caged in a warm room, they fell intoAnoult just when
I was hoping they would come into breeding condition.
Yellow-bellied Parrakeets are new arrivals, and are hardly likely
to nest this season and the same applies to many-colours*
The domestic affairs of the Crimson-wings always pursue a stormy
and eventful course. I started the year with three--my old cock
and hen and a young hen imported the previous autumn. The cock
bred with the old hen in 1922, but he never&amp;apos; disguised the fact that
she bored him stiff. Last year he made a love match with another
hen, that is to say, after giving her a violent thrashing when they
were first introduced, he lived on quite good terms with her until
after their child had left the nest, assisting in the care of his offspring
and even feeding the mother when she was sitting. It is true that he
later began to bully her so badly that he had to be turned loose, but
then who can stand the ways of any female for an unlimited period ?
Not long afterwards his wife died rather suddenly of heart trouble,
a circumstance which caused him no regret, as his time was fully
occupied in courting two hen Kings. His original mate had paired
with a Queen Alexandra, but though young were hatched they were
unfortunately not reared. Towards the end of the winter T witnessed-
an amusing scene in which the cock Crimson-wing was concerned.
Lovely bird as he is, it must be confessed that his character is more
conspicuous for vice than virtue. He is a wife-beater, a flirt, and a
bully, always engaged in fighting his neighbours or making love to
their wives, yet he has (or had, for I fear he is deteriorating steadily
in morals) one principle that he lives up to--he will not hurt a young
bird of his own or an allied species. Last February he was very sorely
tried : he was, as usual, occupied in making advances to a King,

regardless of the fact that she was already married, when an immature
cock Barraband, bred the previous summer and newly released, settled
on the top of the aviary close to him and within a foot or two of
the object of his affections. I expected him to fall upon the unlucky
intruder, as he did upon adult cock Barrabands when they came any-
where near him, but to my surprise he refrained from doing so, though
obviously torn by conflicting emotions. He was filled with rage at
the unwelcome presence of the wretched interloper and yet something
held him back from injuring an obvious youngster. The result was
that he walked round and round the Barraband, his beak open, his
eyes glittering with rage and jealousy, pouring forth torrents of the
most shocking abuse, but never actually touching him until he flew
away quietly of his own accord. Few of us, I suppose, are wholly
bad, and I have always had a little respect for the Crimson-wing
since that day ! I do not suggest that a bird has an abstract idea
of right and wrong, but no one could have seen him and failed to realize
that when assailed simultaneously by conflicting impulses he chose to
obey one which was by no means easy or pleasant to yield to ! That
he was merely afraid to attack a stranger is not a possible explanation
of his conduct, as it is his invariable custom to assault all strange
Parrots at sight, regardless of their size and appearance, and the
Barraband was smaller than he and by no means alarming in looks,
and he is well acquainted with the species and despises them as
adversaries.
By the beginning of April both hen Crimson-wings were in breeding
condition, and called continually to the cock. Very occasionally,
when he had a few moments to spare, he would visit their aviaries and
try and bite them through the wire, apostrophizing them, meanwhile,
with selections of his choicest Billingsgate. This delicate attention
seemed to gratify them extremely, for hen Crimson-wings, like certain
ladies of the human race, would rather be cursed and beaten than
ignored. About the 15th of the month I caught the cock and put him
with the younger hen, much to his disgust, while the old hen I put with
the Queen Alexandra. For nearly a month the Crimson-wing chased
and bullied his companion incessantly until I began to despair of
their ever settling down, but one morning I was surprised and relieved

to find them sitting amicably side by side and by the behaviour of the
hen I judged that she was about to lay. A few days later, however,
she unfortunately got ill, and although she recovered again I thought
it wise to try the other hen with the cock, especially as I found that
the Queen Alexandra would be needed as a mate for a female of his
own species. I was not very sure how the Crimson-wing would like
a change of wives, so to distract his thoughts I caught him and caged
him for a few days. He showed no particular anxiety and regret
at the loss of the first hen, but clearly had no intention of foregoing
the ceremony of licking the second into shape, as I half hoped he might,
as she was ready to go to nest at once. He harried her and bullied her
incessantly, scarcely allowing her to feed in peace or visit the nest-log.
However, in due course she laid and began to sit, without, however,
any improvement in the cock's behaviour. The moment she came
off to feed he was after her, driving her about, so that it was a wonder
she did not die of starvation. Finally, I lost all patience with him
and armed myself with a pair of scissors and a catching-net, determined
to put some check on his behaviour. Having secured him, I cut some
inches off the flight feathers at the tip of one wing, so that he could
still fly, but with far less ease than the hen. I then released him in a
decidedly chastened frame of mind, and he sulked at the far end of the
aviary. Meanwhile the hen, who had come off her nest during the
disturbance, enjoyed the first square meal she had had for weeks,
and afterwards had a glorious bath. My hopes of the eggs being
fertile were practically nil, as I had never seen the pair on anything
approaching friendly terms, though the aviary attendant told me that
he had once noticed them sitting on the same perch. When the
Queen Alexandra's nest came to grief, I decided to look at the eggs,
and, if they were infertile, try for a second nest of hybrids if the hen
Crimson-wing could be induced to lay again while in the company
of her more peaceful alien husband of the previous year. With some
difficulty I managed to reach one of the three eggs at the bottom of
the deep natural log, and to my surprise it was of that peculiar dead-
white colour that denotes the presence of a chick. I at once replaced
it, and the hen soon went back, for Parrakeets are sensible creatures
and do not often desert unless subjected to a quite unreasonable

amount of disturbance. In the end two of the eggs hatched, but
even then there was no improvement in the cock's behaviour, and as
he hindered the feeding of the young rather than assisted in it, my
aviary attendant turned him loose. The young birds were reared by
the mother.
I have already made some reference to the Queen Alexandras.
I have three : a very fine tame cock who wintered out of doors, a less
good aviary-bred bird who is rather fond of getting chills, and a small
hen imported the previous summer. The tamest bird, " Cocky," as
he calls himself, is very amusing, being devoted to men but having
little use for women. On the approach, of a male friend he clambers
down the wire, full of excitement, and begins to display and show off
his talking accomplishments. " Come on ! Kiss me ! Ah, kiss me !
Kiss little Cocky boy ! " Then he whistles the first bar of " Tom,
Tom, the piper's son."
The second cock is also tame, though not quite so demonstrative
as Cocky. He is the bird who has been referred to as the former
mate of the Crimson-wing. The hen is a lively, sociable little person.
Soon after she arrived she fell violently in love with the tame Hock
Peplar, and threw herself literally and metaphorically at his head
on every possible occasion. Indeed, she very nearly ended her career
through her infatuation, for one day when she was still wing-stiff and
clumsy in her flight, she caught sight of him going past and flung
herself against the wire with such violence as to do herself considerable
damage. The Kock Peplar has never been particularly fond of female
society since the death of his first wife, and though he will flirt with
a hen occasionally, he quickly grows tired of her and entirely ignores
her when she is ready to nest. It is, however, a sad fact, not unknown
to ladies of questionable modesty and good taste, that if you press your
suit upon a semi-reluctant gentleman with sufficient ardour, you are
likely, in the end, to awaken the desired response. So it was with
the Queen Alexandra. After she had persistently let the Kock Peplar
know on every possible occasion that she adored him, he really became
quite fond of her, and I think they would certainly have mated if I
had not rather heartlessly made other plans for her matrimonial
future. At the end of April I shut the Kock Peplar up in a

distant aviary and introduced the hen to &amp;apos; Cocky. Cocky, as &amp;apos; I
rather feared, did not care for her a bit and would not tolerate her at
the same end of the aviary. Like many pet birds, he had given his
whole heart to the human race and regarded his own kind, of either
sex, with nothing but jealousy and contempt.
(To be continued.)
A CONSIGNMENT OF EASTERN BIRDS
By J. Delacour
When time allows, I will write for the members of the Avicultural
Society a few notes on my last collecting-trip in Annam and some
other parts of Indo-China ; but these will be more the notes of a field
naturalist than of an aviculturist, as my main object was to gather
specimens of skins and to watch birds&amp;quot; habits in their natural
surroundings. Nevertheless, I brought back a good many live birds,
and perhaps a few words about them will be of more immediate
interest to our fellow members.
I left Quang Fri (Annam) with a large collection on the 17th May,
going by rail to Fourane, where I took the boat, for Saigou.
On board I found a few birds and mammals from Tonking, sent by
the authorities of the city of Hanoi. At Saigou I took many Waders
and other birds, presented by Dr. Cogusey, Governor of Cochin-China,
and transhipped the whole consignment to the S.S. Paul Lecat, a large
and beautiful steamer,&amp;apos; where every convenience was afforded me.
At Singapore, through the courtesy of Messrs. C. Baden Kloss and
F. N. Chasen, of the Raffle's Museum, a very nice lot of birds was
awaiting me, and the collection was completed by a few birds bought at
Colombo.
During the crossing, the sea was not too good, owing to the monsoon,
but the ship never moved and no accident happened to the' birds.
The only serious losses were those of the Lories, which could not stand
the fresh wind, and of many Reinhardt Pheasants, all ill with
diphtheria before I left Annam.
On 19th June, I arrived at Marseilles with heaps of cages and crates,
and, owing to the efficiency of the Museum Agents, all the animals and

birds were in the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, on the 21st. Many
stayed there, as they were intended to, and the others found their way
to Cleres one day later.
I shall now give a list of the birds landed, with a few words of
explanation, leaving out Bears, Monkeys, Tiger Cats, Civets, Squirrels,
Deer, and Porcupines, which all are now in the Paris Museum Zoo in
the best of health. Let me only mention that a baby Porcupine was
born on the journey somewhere on the sea between Colombo and
Djibouti, and has not suffered any ill effects.
Of Partridges, I brought over three species, and one species only lived
a few days ; it was a pair of Rhizothera magnirostris , a fine large bird
with a great bill like a Monaul's, which I obtained at Singapore. The
others were twenty Roulrouls, the most beautiful of all Partridges. I got
some fifty of them at Singapore, many of them being in a hopeless
condition. They are difficult to import, as they soil their feathers
dreadfully ; they feed mostly on banana and soft food. All those that
arrived did very well. I have kept four pairs, and gave the others to
Mme. Lecallier, Mr. H. D. Astley, and Mr. A. Ezra. The specimens of a
very pretty new Tree Partridge (Tropicoperdix) from Annam are the
third species. Six I have kept are doing very well, but, of the pairs
that I gave them, Mr. Astley and Mr. Ezra have lost one bird each.
They have no brilliant colour, but are, to my mind, extremely graceful
and pretty, with their bright yellow legs and yellow and red beaks.
As might be expected from a country such as Annam, which is very
rich in Pheasants, my collection of these birds was an important one,
although the importation of live Reinhardtius, the wonderful Argus
Pheasant of Annam, was an entire failure. Over seventy of these
beautiful birds were collected, and did well in aviaries for months, when
an outbreak of diphtheric roup slowly killed all of them. I embarked
about forty, eleven of which were still alive and landed at the end of
June ; but, in spite of all care, they died one after the other. I hope to
be more lucky next year.
The disappointment with the Reinhardtius was compensated for by
better luck with the very rare Edward's Pheasant ( Hierophasis edwardsi)
of Annam, which was only known before my expedition by four skins

birds ; lour pairs and one extra cock are in the best of health at
Geres, while the other odd cocks, with Swinhoe's Pheasant wives,
are in the collections of Mme. Lecallier, Professor Ghigi, and the
London and Paris Museum Zoos ; the males are all shining blue, with
a short pure white crest and crimson legs.
A greater success still is the importation of one pair of a new species
allied to the above, which I have just found in Annam, on the north
of the Edward's Pheasant range. It is a larger bird of the same general
blue colour, but with a black crest and a longer and more curved tail.
The female is lighter in colour and larger than the Edward's hen.
I also brought three pairs and four odd cocks of Bel's Pheasant,
which looks much like a dark silver. They are not the first imported,
like the above species, as one cock lived for some years in Paris. - I
have kept the pairs and presented cocks to the Paris and London Zoos
and to Mme. Lecallier. : -
Of other Pheasants, I had twenty Crestless, one Noble and fifteen
Siamese Eirebacks, two Chinquis and two Germain's Polyplectrons,
five Bankhiva and one Javan Junglefowl and two Specifer Peafowls.
From Calcutta, Mr. David Ezra had sent me in the spring Argus,
Polyplectron, and Kaleege Pheasants.
Pigeons were also numerous, and have been divided between the
Paris Museum. Mme. Lecallier, and myself : six Tier on curvirostris,
eight Osmotreron vernans, four&amp;apos; 0. bicincta , four Museadivora amea
(all Fruit Pigeons), ten Tigrine, ten Dwarf, one Oriental Turtle, and
sixteen Green-winged Doves.
The Waders consisted of five Black-headed Ibises, one Tantalus,
two Episcopal Storks, two Greater and two Lesser Egrets, one Inter-
mediate Egret ( Meso&amp;apos;phoyx ), two Eastern Purple Herons (Pyrrherodias
maxillensis ), one Bacchus Bittern (Ardeola bacchus ), and seven
Edward's Porphyries, all presented to the Paris Museum ; there were
also one Eastern Plover (Ckaradrinus fulvus), one Striated Kail ( Hypo -
twnidia striata), one pair of Eastern Sams Cranes (Antigone sharped),
and one pair of Black-necked Cranes (Grus nigricollis) which I kept.
Both species of Cranes are most interesting; the Eastern Saras
have been very seldom imported, while the Black-necked, had never
been seen in Europe before. It is a migratory bird, breeding in Thibet

Foreign Bird Show at Torquay
and wintering in Tonking, where I found it; it is very pale grey, almost
white, with black head and neck and quills. It looks like a miniature
Manchurian, but a little darker. The Eastern Sarus is abundant in
Lower Cochin-China and Cambodia; it is a resident species. It
resembles the Indian Sarus, but is decidedly darker, especially on the
neck and wings.
As birds of prey, I only brought a young Spilornis chula and a pair
of Fish Owls (Ketupa ceylonensis) of the size of Eagle Owls. Both species
are, I think, in European collections, and are good additions to the
Paris Zoo.
Another curious bird which attracts public attention is a
White-bellied Booby (Sula sida). It was caught by a deck steward
on the sea between Saigou and Singapore. I was very doubtful
whether I could succeed in getting it to live. I put it in a cage and
crammed it with fish and meat; to my astonishment, it thrived, but
never fed by itself during the sea journey. However, it got very tame
in Paris ; it fed at once on fish and meat, and is in perfect health.
Of the Parrot tribe, I brought the following ; 28 Hanging Parrakeets
(Loriculus vernalis, galgulus, indicus), two Black-capped and two Purple-
capped Lories, and one Shining Lory; one pair of Wallace's Lories
(Eos), and one pair of Moluccan Cockatoos ; a Long-tailed Parrakeet.
(Palceornis longicauda) did not survive long in our cool climate.
I did not bother much about small birds, as I had already as many
birds as could be looked after ; I just brought some seven Chinese Jay
Thrushes ( Dryonastes chinensis, lugeus, and perspicillatus), five Chinese
Bulbuls ( Molpastes chrysshoroides), one Chinese Starling ( Sturnia
sinensis), and four little Barbets from Ceylon, one Thereiceryx zeylonicus
and three Cyanops flavifrons. Dryonastes lugeus is a rare species which
never came over before.

A USEFUL ORNITHOLOGICAL LIBRARY
The following has been received from Mr. Beever, of Kirkheaton,
Huddersfield :--
In the Reference Library in Piccadilly, Manchester, there is a
wonderful collection of Bird Books. I was amazed at the variety
and quality of these books with coloured plates, better than anything
I see in to-day's books. I am certain if people only knew what they
could see here they would get a pleasant surprise. They also have The
Ibis, bound, for thirty or forty years back, and books in German and
French. The Curator was only too pleased to show me large volumes
that were not on the shelves.

employment as a fighting bird, that being the purpose for which
it is commonly kept. Two individuals are made hungry, and then
their jealousy is excited by offering food to one only, which of
course provokes a fight. The sport is carried on in the winter,
after which the birds are released, with the exception of such as

1916 is so tame that it will allow itself to be handled without any
fear. On being taken notice of it will puff out its feathers, chattering
continuously and elevating its tail above its back, and will eventually
sidle up to the hand introduced into its cage ; and on being taken
up it will stay there as if hypnotized, making no effort to escape
and remaining absolutely quiescent. I have, while the bird was.
in that condition, cut its claws and beak without its moving. When
deposited thus in any place it will keep in the same position for
some time before moving away. This bird has a great variety
of musical calls . . . During the summer I have heard it repeat
a low warbling song, which I found it would repeat if I excited it

continually uttered some of the musical calls of the adult. I fed
them on bread and milk, green-bean paste, and chopped raw beef.
I fed the adults on the same kind of food with grain of all kinds
added. Insects of any kind are also much appreciated. The birds,
when given grain scatter it at once on the floor of the cage, where
they prefer to pick at it rather than take it from the grain-cups."&amp;apos;

Sir, --In the Avicultural Magazine for 1921 there is an article on
" Ornithology and Aviculture ", by Mr. E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, in
the opening words of which, on p. 34, that experienced writer states :
" The sciences of ornithology and aviculture are intimately connected.
Each has much to learn from the other." It may, therefore, be of use
to some one or other of the younger members of the Society to mention
feeding habits observed in the wild state in two small species, even
though such facts may be well known to gentlemen of much experience,.

more especially as variety of food is of importance in keeping birds
in good health.
On 8th August, 1923, when walking between this village and
\0x25A0Gravesend, I noticed a small bird about 30 yards away, flying and
carrying something white in its beak ; and as this object looked too
large to be a fowl's feather which had been picked up in a poultry yard
and was being taken to line a nest with, I followed up the small bird
to try and find out what it was carrying. Tracking it to some nettles
and undergrowth at the roadside, I found the bird was a male White-
throat and the white object it was carrying was a large garden.white
butterfly.
The female joined it, and the pair were obviously going to feed their
young with it, because the cries of the brood, excited at the prospect
of a meal, could easily be heard by me.
While, on the one . hand, some small moths are at times given to
young birds by their parents, and appear to be swallowed whole,
wings and all (for instance, by Nightingale, Willow Warbler, Garden
Warbler, Black-cap, Great Tit, and Chaffinch), the question which
arose in my mind as I watched the above-described scene was, " What
is going to be done with the wings of this butterfly ? "
They were obviously too large for the nestlings to eat; but would
the parent birds pull such organs of flight to pieces and eat the remains
themselves, after feeding the young on antennae, legs, etc. ?
However, after waiting some minutes during which both parents
waited in a suspicious way and refused to proceed with the feeding
of the young, I thought it advisable to walk on so as not to attract
the attention of some farm workers to the exact whereabouts of the nest
and therefore this question was not settled there and then.
In any case, it showed that such birds use such insects to feed their
young on ; and therefore other birds in the same order, whether
British or foreign, would probably appreciate such fare as common
species of butterflies when rearing their young. The other species of
bird referred to was the Marsh Tit, a pair of which often picked, up
grains of maize during the spring of 1922, and repeated the perform-
ances in 1923, holding them in their toes, and then picking out some
of the softer parts which they ate. This they did.each day..

In September, 1923, they also pulled off ripening seeds of gaillardia
flowers growing in the garden, and ate parts of them on numerous
occasions.
While, on the one hand, it is known that Tits of different species
will, when insect food is scarce, eat some sorts of grain and seeds, on
the other hand the numerous visits of the Marsh Tits seemed to suggest
that the species has a special liking for both maize and gaillardia--the
more so&amp;apos; because they chose such food during months of the year,
April and September, when their usual insect food ought not to be
scarce.
Up to the time of writing I have not found, during twelve years'
observation here, any of the other species (whether Blue, Great, or
Long-tailed--all of which visit the garden regularly) make a special
choice of the vegetarian food above mentioned.
Frederick D. Welch, M.R.C.S.
[Butterflies, including the garden white, are, as a rule, distasteful
to birds, though individual birds will occasionally take an odd one, as
observed by Dr. Welch. The Great, Blue, Cole, and Marsh Tits eat
vegetable food freely except during the few weeks of the actual
breeding season. Robins will also eat dry canary seed right through
the summer if they get the chance.-- Ed.]

the time we received it next morning the young were dead. I anxiously
watched the old birds taking the meal-worms up to the nest--both
had their beaks filled with them--but after a while the cock came out
with them still in his mouth, and then the hen tried, with the same
result, so I saw I had lost my young ones. The old birds at once nested
again, and this time brought out two fine young birds, which must
have left the nest about the same time as Mr. Ezra's. When they were
fully reared I wrote our Honorary Secretary, Miss Knobel, and learned
from her that she had received some days earlier from Mr. Ezra the
account published in the Avicultural Magazine. My birds laid
again, but did not sit very closely and eventually deserted the nest
before any young were hatched.

A TAME STARLING
Sir, --I venture to ask if a characteristic I have observed in Starlings
of Southern Spain is regional or universal in that species. I mean
the habit of the male bird to change the colour of its bill in summer
from black to bright yellow.
(In the British race of the Starling, this colour change is also
observable-- Ed.)
The friendship which I formed with one of these birds was of so
intimate a. kind that perhaps a few details may be of interest. In
a very short time I taught the Starling to perch on my wrist; and,
having it in this position, when there were flies about I used to hoist
it up to hawk them on the window-panes. This simple little attention--
for which I was disposed to claim no particular credit--aroused in the
heart of the Starling a passionate devotion. On being let out of its
cage, it rushed immediately to my shoulder, where it would remain
with its body pressed against my neck and its head tucked behind
my ear, until hunger obliged it to go and feed, after which it would at
once return to its post behind my ear. When I went to lie down it
would remain on guard, perched on my uppermost ear ; and if during
our fly-hawking expeditions, or at any other time it found itself in a
suitable position, it would gently open my lips with its bill, and give
my front teeth an affectionate little peck. But more wonderful.

perhaps, was the dexterity with which it caressed the edges of my
open eyelids !--a touch lighter than that of swan's down.
When nearing its end, the poor bird seemed to realize that we must
soon be separated. Its post behind my ear no longer satisfied it.
Braving the tobacco smoke--fancy a Starling indifferent to smoke !--
it pressed its little body against my cheek ; and I was heartless enough
to go on smoking with the Starling's bill actually nestling under my
moustache. After a few days of this, I heard a little flutter in the
night, and my friend was no more. Infandum dolorem !

PROLIFIC BLUE BUDGERIGARS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999342875" page_id="56200736"  page_num="306" year="" vol="">
Sir, --On 2nd April I introduced a hen Blue Budgerigar to a Blue
nock ; by 14th April she was sitting on five eggs, and hatched and
reared three young. Before this family were fully fledged she had
chosen another husk, and, sitting on seven eggs, five hatched and were
fully reared. Before the second nest were fully fledged the hen went
back to nest No. 1, laid eight eggs, hatched and fully reared seven
young, and to-day, 18th September, she has laid two eggs towards her
fourth nest.
I have, however, decided to take the husks away and rest her until
another season, as I think hatching and rearing fifteen young is very
.satisfactory.
All the young are exceptionally strong large birds. They were
bred in a flight 8 by 5 by 9 feet built over an open window facing
north-east, and during our wretched summer have had some very
severe weather to contend with.
From observation I find this particular pair fed their young almost
*exclusively on seeding grass (given ad. lib.), tender lettuce, oats, and
groats, and during the period of incubation I seldom saw the hen out
of the husk, the cock feeding her as she sat.
As this pair are the only pure Blues I have, I am desirous of
introducing new blood next season to mate with my youngsters, and
*should any member wish to avail themselves of this hardy and prolific
strain of Blues, I will be pleased to exchange sex for sex as soon
.as I can define what they are. W. R. H. Bearby.

1. Honey Eaters
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99452625" page_id="56200737"  page_num="307" year="" vol="">
Honey Eaters are generally provided with a rather long and bent
beak, and a tube-like tongue, which can be protruded and which is
adapted for sucking nectar from flowers and for the catching of small
insects which lie hidden in them. However, Honey Eaters are the
least differentiated of Honey Suckers, and resemble more closely certain
insectivorous birds ; their food consists partly of insects and berries.
Honey Eaters are purely Australasian birds. They are found in all
the Archipelagos, including the Hawaiian Islands, and a number of
species are found in Australia, New Guinea, and New Zealand. Their
size varies from that of a Missel Thrush to that of a Lark; their tail
and wings are medium sized. The plumage of these birds is rather
dull, but they are of graceful shape, and a number have brilliant
ornaments on the head and neck.
In captivity it is quite easy to keep them in cages or aviaries; they
are fed on insectivorous mixture, fruit, bread and milk, and a little
Mellin's Food, milk, and honey sop. According to the degree in which
the different species naturally partake of a diet of honey, more or less
of this last-named food is given.
Many Honey Eaters are not particularly interesting in captivity.
Their plumage, often dull, does not make them much sought after by

aviculturists. Some, however, of them are very beautiful, with mottled
plumage and attractive ways. A score of these species have been
imported, and we will give a rapid account of them.
Philemon. These birds are the size of a Blackbird, with a strong,
long, and curved beak, and long and strong claws. Their plumage is
dull, brown and grey predominating. The following species have been
imported.
Philemon corniculatus, from Northern Australia. A very ugly
bird, brown, mottled with white. The head and neck are entirely bare.
P. moluccensis, also brown, but the bare parts are restricted to the
area round the eyes and to the back of the neck.
P. cockerelli , from New Britain, brown on the back, light grey
underneath, with the neck almost white ; the top of the head and the
face chestnut. Bare round the eyes.
Entomyza cyanotis, from Australia, is the same size, with the sides
of the head bare and blue-green ; the feathers on the head are black
with a white line on the cheeks and the nape. The top part of the body
is olive brown, underneath white.
Acanthogenys carunculata is remarkable for the excrescences at
the back of the beak. Pretty plumage, mottled with brown and grey,
yellow underneath.
A. rufigularis is browm above, white, striped with dark brown
underneath, with the chin, throat, and breast red. These two pretty
species are Australian ; the beak is rather small, and the tail graduated.
One of the best known Honey Eaters in captivity is Myzantha
garrula. This is a bird with a rather short, slightly curved beak, which
reminds one of a Thrush ; only the skin behind the eyes is bare and
reddish, as are also the claws and beak. The top of the head and the
upper part of the throat is black, the face pale grey ; the rest of the
plumage is a pale grey-brown, the under parts lighter with a slight
yellow tinge. This species inhabits South Australia, and its substitute
in the West is M. obscura, which is very little different.
Manorhina melanophrys , closely related to the above, has also been
imported.
Prosthemadera novce-zelandice is a beautiful bird with a slender
beak ; plumage black with bronzy shadings. The wings are marked

with white near the shoulders, but the peculiarity of this species consists
of two little white tufts of feathers situated under the throat in the
front of the neck.
Anthornis melanura inhabits New Zealand, as does the preceding one.
It is greenish-yellow with black wings and tail, and some long yellow
feathers on the sides of the breast.
Meliphaga phrygia, from Southern Australia, is mottled pale yellow
and black ; the cheeks are provided with yellowish-white excrescences.
The Ptilotis constitute the most important species of the family.
They are, for the most part, a little smaller than the preceding birds.
Their plumage is not bright, varying from olive, yellow, white, and
brown, but many of the species are beautifully marked. The sides of
the head are usually bare, and have excrescences. They are found all
over Australasia.
All the Ptilotis are so much alike that I consider it useless to give a
description of each of the species that have been imported. These are,
as far as I know, P. fusca, P. auricomis, P. leucotis, P. flavicollis ,
P. chrysotis, and perhaps some others.
There have also been imported two species of the genus Melithreptes.
These are much smaller birds than any of the preceding, with rather
short beaks and come from Australia. M. validirostris is brown,
tinted with olive and white, with the top and sides of the head and the
chin black, cheeks and nape white ; bare round the eyes, skin white,
tinged with green. M. atricapillus has an entirely black head.

<bodyText confidence="0.9983439" page_id="56200739"  page_num="309" year="" vol="">
The Sunbirds also belong to the large group of Honey-sucking
Birds. They are especially distinguished by their pointed beaks,
nearly always long, slender, and curved ; tongue long and easily
projected, with a bifid tube at the tip. Beak and tongue are well
adapted to their diet; they capture the very small insects which they
find in flowers and they also suck nectar. They thus resemble Humming
Birds ( Trocliilidce) in habits, and one can say that they represent in the
Old World these American birds from which at the same time they are
very widely separated by their anatomical and morphological
characteristics, although their plumage is similarly ornamented with

the richest metallic sheen. Sunbirds take their food sitting, after
the fashion of the Tits, while Humming Birds feed on the wing.
Their wings are medium sized and their legs long.
Sunbirds are small in size, the males differing generally from the
females, wdiich are duller. The males of many species have an
eclipse plumage, losing during the winter their beautiful breeding
plumage to take on that of the female.
These birds inhabit Africa, the south of Asia, and Australasia.
They do not migrate. They frequently live in gardens and build very
pretty covered woven nests, purse-shaped, in which they lay two or
three white eggs.
Sunbirds have only been known as cage birds during the past
twenty years, and it is due to our member, Mr. Alfred Ezra, that we
have learnt how to keep them in captivity as easily as any other birds.
It was he, in fact, who found the kind of food most suitable to them.
This diet is extremely simple and consists of a mixture of equal parts
of condensed milk, honey, and Mellin's Food, the whole diluted with
ten times the quantity of boiling water. Freshly boiled milk may
be substituted for the condensed milk, and many other similar foods for
Mellin's Food. The only precaution to be taken is that the food must
be kept fresh ; it must be carefully watched and renewed directly it
shows the least sign of becoming sour. This diet is sufficient for Sun-
birds, and they can be kept on it for many years, adding occasionally
some sweet and juicy fruits, small insects, and spiders ; the soft parts
of mealworms are liked by some.
Sunbirds are more successfully kept in a cage than an aviary,
although it is sometimes advisable to put them into a flight during the
four summer months. But this is often inconvenient, as their fighting
instincts makes it unwise to put several together or to put them in with
other birds ; moreover, they catch quantities of small insects and when
they are brought back into cages and are thus deprived of this food they
often pine.
I have tried many times to pair them in aviaries, both indoor and out,
and I have always failed. The male fights the female or vice versa,
and when they are put with other birds they often worry them. Yet
one species, Ginnyris asiatica, has bred in the Zoological Gardens in

London, but they could not bring up the young ones. Another pair
of the same species laid whilst with Mr. Brook in 1913, but the eggs
were unfertile.
Alone in a cage they live well and long ; they should have thin
perches and the small jar containing their food should be hung up within
easy reach. A piece of paper, which must be changed every day,
should be placed on the bottom of their cage, otherwise their food
become mixed with sand which soils their feet and plumage. Their
perches become sticky very soon with their sugary droppings, and should
be washed very frequently. In winter they should be put in a warm
place, but many are able to stand quite a low temperature (40*).
There are few birds that can be better recommended for cage life
than Sunbirds ; they are lively, tame, and sing quite nicely; their
ways are charming, their plumage sparkling, and they are easy to feed ;
their food is made quickly and easily. Unfortunately, they are not
imported frequently. In fact, their transport is difficult on account of
their liquid nourishment. It is to be hoped that more will arrive in the
future.
The number of species which have been imported is still rather
restricted, but doubtless the number will increase later. For instance,
species common in Western Africa, such as Hedydipnajplatura, Nectarinia,
Pulchella , Cinnyris splendidus, C. senegalensis, etc., which have already
been kept in captivity in their own country by Dr. Millet-Horsin, will,
without doubt, reach us before long. For the moment we will give a
description only of those which have been kept in European collections.
Nearly all have been first obtained by Mr. A. Ezra, the late Marquis de
Segur, and afterwards by the Hon. Mrs. A. Bourke and myself.
The Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa) is one of the best known,
biggest, and the most beautiful of the family. Its size is almost that
of the Siskin. The colour of the male is metallic green, shining and
silky, coppery above, with two large tufts of yellow feathers on the
flanks. The tail is lengthened by two long feathers. The beak is very
long and curved. The eclipse plumage of the male, and that of the
female, is grey, shading to light olive, lighter underneath, with eyebrows
. and a band running from the beak to the cheeks yellowish.
This species lives in the east of South Africa; it has often been

imported, and lives well in a cage, where it becomes very tame. When
my birds were destroyed during the War, at Villers-Bretonneux, I had
had a Malachite nearly seven years, and it still was in perfect condition.
The South African Wedge-tailed Sunbird (Anthobaphes violacea)
also inhabits South Africa. It is a magnificent bird, very much smaller
in size then the preceding, and with a rather shorter beak ; the tail is
long and graduated ; the upper parts, head, and neck are metallic green ;
breast, violet, with two yellow tufts on the sides, and all the rest
of the under parts orange yellow. The males in eclipse plumage and
the females are olive green.
This Sunbird lives in the mountains ; to my knowledge, only one
male has been imported, and I kept him for four years. He was very
tame and sang sweetly. He was very fond of crushed mealworms.
The Nepalese Sunbird (Aethopyga nipalensis) which belonged to
Mr. Ezra is a charming little bird with a long thin tail. The lower part
of the back and the under parts of the body are bright yellow, the head,
the nape, neck and tail, blue-green, darker on the sides of the head ;
upper back and shoulders reddish purple ; wings and middle of the back
olive brown. The female is greyish yellow.
This species inhabits the Western Himalayas, and its substitute
towards the East is AE. horsfieldi, which Mr. Ezra has also kept. This
bird differs only to the preceding by the absence of the copper red
shade on the back and shoulders, which is replaced by brown.
The Black-breasted Sunbird (AE. saturata) is another species, rare
in captivity, which I have possessed. It is a charming, very small
bird, with a long graduated tail; the rump, the top of the head, the nape,
and two bands running from the beak to the sides of the breast are
metallic blue ; the wings and the breast are black ; the upper back is
brownish purple, the lower back is black, marked with bright yellow ;
under part, black, tinged with olive. The female is olive green, greyish
above.
This pretty species inhabits the Himalayas and Assam. It lives
well in a cage once it is acclimatized, and is remarkable for its liveliness ;
it warbles quite nicely.
The Bed Sunbird (AE. sehericc) has been fairly often imported.
It is one of these lovely species which inhabit the Far East, but whose

beautiful scarlet hues turn to dull yellow in captivity. It is the same
shape and size as the preceding, and also inhabits the Himalayas. The
top of the head is metallic green, the nape of the neck dull green ;
a band of steel blue runs from the beak to the sides of the neck ; the
rest of the head, the breast, and the upper part of the back are bright
scarlet, the lower part of the back is golden and the tail green. The
female is olive colour, with the throat shaded with red.
The Yellow-breasted Sunbird (Chalcostetha jpectoralis) has been
exhibited in the Zoological Gardens in Berlin. Found in Indo-Malaya,
this pretty species has the top of the head greenish, cheeks, nape, and
upper back as well as the wings, blackish ; throat coppery red, divided
from the cheeks by a blue band ; under parts yellow ; the lower back
and the rump greenish ; two yellow tufts on the flanks. The female &amp;apos;s
grey above, pale yellow underneath.
The Amethyst-rumped Sunbird (Cinnyris zeylonica) was the most
common species in captivity before the War ; it has not been seen since.
It is reddish brown above, yellow underneath, with the top of the head
green, the throat and the rump metallic violet. The female and the
male in eclipse are grey above, yellow underneath, with the throat of a
greyish white ; wings and tail have chestnut markings. This species
is found in India and in Ceylon.
Loten's Sunbird (C. lotenia) inhabits the same regions, and was
in the possession of Mr. A. Ezra, and of the Berlin Zoological Gardens.
Upper parts metallic blue ; throat and breast purple violet; two
orange tufts on the sides ; lower breast and wings black. The female is
grey above, dull yellow underneath, with a black tail tipped with pale
yellow.
The Purple Sunbird (C. asialica) was another fairly well known
cage-bird before the War, but it is very scarce since. The male is
entirely black, shaded with blue and metallic green, with yellow orange
pectoral tufts. In winter they are, like the female, greyish yellow, but
some black is often retained on the wings, throat, and tail. This is the
species, coming from India, which nested in London and in Scotland.
The South African Sunbird (C. mariquensis) was imported by the
Marquis de Segur. Its upper parts are bronze green, the breast is

and abdomen, black. The female is grey, with whitish stripes above
and below the eye ; the under part lighter, spotted with dark grey.
The Bifasciated Sunbird ( C . bifasciatus) does not differ from the
preceding, except that it is smaller in size and has not the coppery
iridescence on the head, back, and throat. It inhabits West Africa ;
I obtained a good many in 1920, and they are charming birds.
The White-breasted Sunbird ( C . leucogaster) has been imported
by the Marquis de Segur ; it inhabits South Africa, and is green, shading
to blue above, with the tail dark blue ; wings grey, and breast violet,
separated from the white under part by a black band ; yellow pectoral
tufts. The female is grey above, yellowish underneath.
The Greater Double-collared Sunbird (C. afer ) is, with the following
one, the most frequently imported of the species. It is rather large
(nearly the size of the Malachite), shining green above, with dark grey
wings and tail, abdomen lighter grey ; rump blue ; lower part of the
breast bright red separated from the green by a narrow blue band.
The red turns to orange in captivity. The female is grey-yellowish
underneath, and the males take on this plumage during part of the
year. It inhabits South Africa.
The Lesser Double-collared Sunbird (C. chalyhceus) exactly
resembles the preceding, and inhabits the same country. It is very
similar except that it is much smaller, and its breast is not so red. It
is the commonest Sunbird in captivity.
The Scarlet-chested Sunbird (C. gutturalis) is another beautiful
bird from South and East Africa. A living specimen was shown in the
Zoological Gardens, London, recently. It is the same size as the C. afer,
and is velvety black, the head and the top of the throat brilliant green,
the lower part of the throat and the breast bright red ; each feather is
steel blue at the base, with a spot of metallic violet in the fold of the
wing ; the beak is very long and curved. The female is grey above,
yellow spotted with dark grey underneath.
The Amethyst Sunbird (C. amethystina) is also often seen in
captivity. It inhabits the west of South Africa.
It resembles the preceding by its intense velvety blackness, with
the top of the head metallic green ; the throat purple amethyst, and
the fold of the wing violet. The male in eclipse plumage and the female

are grey above, pale yellow spotted with black underneath, with a
blackish throat.
The Collared Sunbird (Anthepfes colleens ) is a lovely little bird,
with rather a short bill, which has been exhibited at the London Zoo.
Both sexes are bright green above and yellow underneath, the male
differing in having a green throat and a blue pectoral belt. It is found
in South Africa.
The Great Spider-hunter (AracJinolhera magna), from India and
Indo-China, has also been imported. It is a bird the size of a Goldfinch,
with a strong, long, curved beak, a garb of yellowish olive, streaked with
black. _____
FLOWER-PECKERS
By J. Delacour
Close to the family of Honey Suckers and Sunbirds, we must place
that of the Dicoeidse. It is composed of small birds which recall the Sun-
birds, but the beak is very much shorter and less pointed; in addition,
they make their nests in the shape of a cup, not a purse ; generally
red predominates in their plumage, which has no metallic reflections.
The Dicoeidce are chiefly encountered in Australasia and in Asia ;
a few are found in Africa. Few of the species amongst these birds have
been brought alive to Europe. They live in captivity as easily as the
Sunbirds, and require the same care and food. With their beauty,
it is astonishing that more are not imported.
Dicceum cruentatum, which is found in India and Indo-China, also
in the Sundra Islands, is a very small bird with a pointed beak and a
short tail. It is bright red on top, with the shoulders and coverings of
the wings steel blue. Bound the eyes, the cheeks, the sides of the neck
and the throat are black ; the middle of the throat and the under part
of the body are cream coloured. The female is olive coloured above,
shaded with fawn, with the tail black and the rump red.
Equally imported are the D. erythrorhynchum from India, and the
D. ignicolle from the Aru Islands.
Pardalotus punctatus, which inhabits Australia, is a little bird with a
short beak, thick and hooked, which resembles in a way the Mannikins
and the Euphones. It is brown, spotted with light fawn on top ;

the tail coverts are red. The tail and the wings are black with
large white specks. The top of the head black spotted with white ;
face grey striped with black, brows white, throat golden yellow.
The under parts of the body are pale fawn.
Zosterops, or White Eyes, were, at one time much more common in
aviaries than at the present time. Although related to the Sun-
birds, they resemble in appearance certain Warblers. They are
small birds with a thin straight beak of medium length. The
predominating colour is always olive green and yellow, with the under
part of the body whitish or fawn. Most of the species have a small
circle of white feathers round the eyes. All are alike, and there are
nearly one hundred. These birds are found in the hot and temperate
regions of Asia, Africa, and Australasia.
The Zosterops are both fly-catchers and honey-eaters. Also in
captivity they should be given the mixture of insects, bread and
milk, and Sunbirds' food. A mixture of the yoke of an egg hard
boiled, ants' eggs, and biscuits, in addition to a little honey, agrees with
them very well. They are a success in an aviary ; they can be left in
the open air during the summer, and many have bred in France and
England, but they must be kept in a cage until they are quite
acclimatized; the nest is a bag very well made ; the eggs are white.
Whilst rearing the young, live insects are necessary.
Zosterops palpebrosa is the most beautiful species, and the best
known. It was one of these which bred in captivity. It is the size of
a Wren, olive on top, pale yellow underneath ; sides grey, with a
bright yellow throat.
Z. capensis is also frequently imported. It is distinguished from
the preceding by its superior size, and its general colouring is much
less vivid.
Z. virens is another species from South Africa, bigger and more
brilliantly coloured. This species has bred several times in England
whilst in captivity.
A certain number of other species, very little different, except that
some among them have the under parts russet, are also imported. They
are: Z. japonica , erythropleura, annulosa, flava, lateralis, and
jacksoni.

The only thing to do was to put the hen with the other male, and
he received her very well and they were soon on the best of terms
and inspecting a nest-box. Some days later, however, the hen, instead
of going into the aviary shelter, spent the night in a very exposed part
of the flight, and I had to take her into hospital next morning with
a very nasty attack of enteritis. I expected it to put her back in
her nesting for some weeks, but she made a surprisingly quick recovery,
being again in a breeding condition the following evening and going on
with her nesting directly she was returned to the aviary. She soon
appeared to be sitting, but just when I was congratulating myself
on a valuable nest, one morning, to my disgust, I found her looking
far from well. The symptoms were not the ordinary ones of egg-
binding, and I feared tuberculosis or an inflammation of the crop.
The nest contained four eggs which I entrusted to the care of foster
parents. Next morning, to my surprise, I found an egg on the floor
of the cage, and the hen decidedly better. As a general rule, when
a bird is taken in egg-bound it lays the egg that was troubling it and
then no more unless you are rash enough to return, it at once to the
aviary. To my surprise, however, the Queen Alexandra laid a second
egg two days later, and then a third, and some weeks afterwards
a fourth. We then put her back in the aviary without a nest-box,
but her erratic laying seems to have injured her health, for she did
not do well, and again had to be caged in the warm hospital. Two
eggs were given to a nesting Barraband's Parrakeet, another two
to a second bird of the same species, and a third couple to a Bock Peplar.
One Barraband hatched one egg, but she proved a bad or unlucky
mother, and lost three out of four of her own young, and the young
Alexandra when about half-grown. The other eggs were clear.
I had three pairs of Barrabands from which eggs might have been
expected.
The first pair consisted of a tame hen imported in 1921 and an old
cock who has been some fifteen years in my possession. He was

infertile each year as long as he lived in a fixed aviary, but his value
as a breeding bird has improved since he has enjoyed many months of
complete freedom and been given one of the new movable aviaries for
his summer home. Last year he and his mate reared a son, the young
bird who figures in the Crimson-wing incident. In the autumn the
hen contracted a rather bad chill and had to be taken indoors for the
winter. Her mate could hear but not see her, and as he is a most
devoted husband it made him anxious and restless. He is, however,
far too sensible an old fellow willingly to leave his home, but one morning
a very dense sea fog suddenly came down and about 12 o'clock the same
day I received a telephone message from a friend on the further side
of Hayling Island, describing a Parrakeet in his garden which I at once
recognized as the Barraband. Evidently the unfamiliar phenomenon
of the fog had confused him, and not knowing where to find either
home or mate he had let his matchless wing-power carry him over
a tidal branch of the sea and over the island beyond until he came to
the open Channel, which he wisely decided not to attempt to cross.
I hurriedly provided myself with a trap feeding-tray, covered up the
hen's cage with a rug, put both in the motor and repaired with all
haste to the place where the cock was reported, for strayed Barrabands
are an awkward proposition to tackle since their powers of flight are
enormous, and an hour's travelling may put them beyond all hope of
recovery. On arriving at our destination I strained my ears, and
presently heard a Barraband's call, distant but unmistakable. I
left the hen in a safe place to act as decoy and made my way in the
direction from which the sound came, narrowly escaping being bitten
by a Chow dog, who regarded my appearance with the marked dis-
approval that his race frequently exhibit to strangers. At length
I located the object of my search in the top of a tree growing by
a narrow lane. After that, all was plain sailing. I fetched the hen
and put her cage in the middle of the road, and she heard him directly
and called to him, and in a very few moments he dropped down from
branch to branch and finally settled gracefully on the top of her cage
and began to display to her and tell her how delighted he was to find
her in such an unexpected place. He made no attempt to fly away
when I set the trap feeding-tray a few feet away, and before long he

was underneath it. A sharp pull of the line, and he was secure, but
even then not a bit frightened, and when I put the two doors together
he walked into the hen's cage without a flutter, and all the way home
talked to her contentedly under the rug as if motoring about the
country were a daily experience for him. I did not care to run any
further risks of the same kind with him, so he spent the winter with
his mate in an indoor aviary. In March I let him out again, as the
danger of fogs was past, and he needed flying exercise to get him into
condition. No untoward incident occurred, and he went into the
breeding aviary in April in good health and spirits. After sitting for a
considerable time on nothing, as she did the year before, the hen laid five
eggs, four of which hatched and the young birds are now being reared.
The second pair of Barrabands consisted of an imported hen and
a cock I had bred in 1915. They nested last year, but the eggs were
infertile, as I made the mistake of shutting up the cock too early
and he went back rather in condition. I believe they would have
nested again this year, but unfortunately I obliged them to
share an aviary with another pair imported the previous year.
Barrabands are about the only large Parrakeets of which several
can be kept together all the year round and I had bred them under
such conditions without trouble. The hen of the second pair was,
however, a rather bad-tempered bird, and when the other female,
who was her master, appropriated the nest-box she had used the year
before, she turned sulky and would not take to any of the others
at her disposal. Seeing that things were hanging fire I moved her
and her mate to an empty aviary, but she was not going to be appeased,
and dropped into an early moult to teach me not to treat her so
inconsiderately another time ! The third hen laid five eggs and
hatched four and a Queen Alexandra, but as I have already said,
she was not fortunate with her young. She and her mate were imported
the previous summer, and he has not yet been at liberty, so the
percentage of fertile eggs was distinctly good for a species where poor
hatching results are the rule. The surviving bird is a fine young hen.
Of all my birds the Rock Peplars behaved in the most erratic fashion.
Whatever may be said for and against the new aviaries, they appear to
suit Rock Peplars down to the ground, and my seven birds came

through, the bad winter without a day's illness, and have laid nineteen
eggs between them. The very modest success achieved after so
promising a beginning has been due entirely to the fact that every pair
contained a bird in some way deficient in ordinary common sense.
The cock of the first pair was a lovely specimen I had received from
an aviculturalist in France, and he was in every way a model of good
behaviour. His wife, however, whom he allowed to rule him, was
a fresh-air fiend with modern ideas on sanitation. She scorned both
the nest-boxes provided for her, including one of the grandfather
clock type which satisfies the most captious hens and laid her eggs
immediately below the seed dish on a heap of wet husks. The site
she had chosen did not, however, entirely satisfy her, and she would
only sit at night, spending part of the day making excavations and
covering the unfortunate eggs with debris. Finally, coming to the
conclusion that this Brush-turkey regime was not likely to be pro-
ductive of good results, I rescued the five eggs and divided them between
the two other hens which were nesting in boxes. I also placed a bit
of wire netting over the ill-chosen site. The cock did his best to
persuade his mate to take to the nest-boxes, but she would have none
of them, and laid four more eggs on the grass, close to where the first
nest had been. This time, having no seed husks to bother her, she
sat steadily enough and hatched three young. After a few days she
decided that the place was getting dirty and the children must be
moved, and she hauled them off to a fresh spot. Her intentions were
no doubt excellent and quite in accordance with the most modern
ideas on hygiene, but unfortunately Nature had not provided her with
the means of carrying little soft fledgelings from one place to another.
Her method was to drag them along by the beak and in doing so she
damaged the upper mandibles of two of them. After that my aviary
attendant placed his services at the mother's disposal, and moved her
children for her as often as seemed necessary, and so far this arrange-
ment is working harmoniously.
The hen Bock Peplar of the second pair is tame, but cross, and enjoys
nothing so much as taking a nip out of one's finger when one is putting
fresh food and water in the aviary. She has an inordinate passion
for cold baths, and to see her flopping about in the water dish on a bitter

winter day is enough to make one shiver. Unlike the first hen, she
took to an ordinary nest-box readily enough, but seemed very reluctant
to sit properly, and gave me an anxious time, as she has three eggs
belonging to the first hen as well as five of her own. However, at the
very last moment, she settled down, and for about ten days all went
well. One morning, however, she came off and had a tremendous
bath : I did not think anything of it at the time, imagining that she
would return to her eggs as soon as she was dry, but at midday she was
still off and had just had another bath. Afternoon came, and she still
showed no inclination to return to her duties, though her mate was very
worried and tried to drive her home. Tn the evening 1 looked into the
nest. What a sight! Instead of a nice dry bed of decayed wood
fragments, the whole bottom was three inches deep in the coldest
and clammiest mud, in which the unfortunate eggs were embedded
like plums in a pudding ! The wretched hen, instead of waiting until
she was more or less dry, like any sensible bird would do, had gone back
to her eggs soaking, and had turned the whole bottom of the nest into
mud : then, finding things uncomfortable, she had deserted ! The
eggs were all spoiled, and several were fertile, and the hen did not nest
again.
In the case of the third pair, the cock proved to be the offending
party. He and his mate occupied the next aviary to the first pair
and, judging by his behaviour, it would seem that he had observed
the idiosyncrasies of his neighbour's wife with little favour, and was
determined to have no nonsense of that kind in Ms establishment.
He had no use for these modern females who bossed their husbands
and neglected their houses, and had their heads full of new-fangled
ideas ! A woman's place was in the home, attending to her children
and obeying her husband. So he proceeded to take his w T ife firmly
in hand. Formerly, like the other cock, he had been in the habit of
giving way to his mate, but now he made it plain to her that he was the
master. As soon as the nest-box w^as put up he drove her into it,
and made her stay there. As long as she did so, he fed her most regularly
and was satisfied, but woe betide her if she left it! This was all very
well up to a certain point, but in the course of Nature a prospective
father has other duties besides keeping his wife at home and supplying

her with food, and of this important fact the Rock Peplar seemed
entirely unaware. The result was that all four eggs laid by the hen
were clear, and the only thing hatched was one of the deserted eggs
of hen No. 1. The cock was immensely delighted with his foster child,
and redoubled his efforts to keep his wife at home, obviously fearing
that the precious infant might catch cold if she left it even for a
moment! Disappointed as I am with the poor results achieved after
so promising a start, I cannot help smiling when I think of the different
causes of the Rock Peplar's failure. Birds are, at times, unbelievably
human in their follies and weaknesses !
The last pairs whose doings remain to be recorded are the Kings.
Having lost my old female last summer, I obtained a new one from
Damages in the autumn, a fine big hen, very tame and steady and with
almost as much " butterfly marking " in her wings as a cock. Her
mate was given his liberty soon after her arrival, and stayed well until
one unlucky day when the hen discovered a hole in the wire-netting
of her aviary and made her escape through it. Pairs of Kings are not
the best of stayers at liberty, but the hen was so tame and quiet and
she, her mate, and the Crimson-wing made such a magnificent trio
flying about together, that I did not hurry to recapture her. The result
was that after a few days she strayed to some woods about six miles
away, taking the cock with her. I sent a trap feeding-tray to a place
they were reported to visit fairly often, and not long afterwards the
hen was caught and returned to me with a badly damaged leg, probably
through some idiot throwing a stone at her. I heard occasional
reports of the cock for some time afterwards, but I could never properly
locate him, and in the end he was lost. I managed to obtain two more
cocks, both, adult, and these stayed in the most exemplary way all the
winter, after they had been given their liberty. In March the same
bitter easterly gale that upset the Brown's also proved too much for the
hen King, and I had to take her indoors. The cocks I caught up soon
afterwards, fearing they might wander when they had no female to
keep them about. In April I turned the hen King into an aviary with
the larger cock. She at once began to examine nest-boxes, but after
a week or two I was disgusted to find large feathers lying about, showing
all too plainly that the caging had induced an early moult. I abandoned

all hopes of breeding Kings this year, but to my great surprise in a little
while the feathers stopped falling, interest in the nest revived, and the
hen began to invite the cock to feed her by a call and actions very
similar to those of hen Polyteline Parrakeets shortly about to lay.
In due course five eggs appeared, and all proved fertile ; one chick died
in hatching, the rest are doing well.
The second cock I attempted to pair with a Sulu Island hen, but he
never seemed very interested in her, and when she came into breeding
condition she turned so spiteful with him that I had to separate them.
My belief is that he took her to be a cock by reason of her plumage,
and that his mistake outraged the feelings of the unhappy lady to such
an extent as to transform her from a peaceful and rather timid bird,
into a perfect virago !
[All the young birds mentioned have been successfully reared with
the exception of three of the young Kings. Blue-winged Grass
Parrakeets laid fertile eggs, but they had not settled down in their
new quarters and refused to use the nest-boxes, so no young were
hatched. Fire Finches, Orange-cheeked Waxbills, Bicheno's Finches,
Zebra Finches and Budgerigars reared young at liberty in the
garden. --Ed.]

very tame. This bird, which I had put in a cage containing Buntings,
Finches, etc., when it saw me coming into the room would cling
to the wires in expectation of the coming food, and on my opening
the cage would fly on to my hand and take food while perched on
it. It spent a great deal of its time perched close against some of
the other birds, holding out its head and neck to have its feathers
preened by them." Some, however, pecked it, so it was removed,
but " when it found itself alone, it became shy and remained so.
I fed this bird on green-bean paste, chopped raw beef, and bread
and milk, also on hard-boiled egg. It was very fond of caterpillars
and ate certain kinds of small green grasshoppers, but would not
touch the brown grasshoppers that other birds prefer to the green
ones. It was sent to London in 1919, but unfortunately did not
reach the Zoo . . . In the summer of 1918 ... it moulted
badly ... I suspected that there was something wrong with the
sand furnished--this was a very fine river-sand. I substituted
coarser hill-stream sand, which caused an almost immediate change".

Z. japonica. " In a cage at Osaka I saw a beautiful variety . . . the
distribution of the normal colours was faintly visible, being indicated
on the upper parts by a pale yellowish tint." C. Ingram. Ornith.

FLOWER-PECKERS
Dic^eum cruentatum. " A few examples . . . are occasionally on
sale, but these birds, though they will eat bananas greedily, are
not easy to keep. This is a great pity, as they are not only very
pretty, but quite the tamest of any small birds I know." Finn,
loc. cit. 436.
SUNBIRDS 1
Arachnechthra asiatica and A. zeylonica. " Both may be
occasionally seen at the dealers' establishments, but can hardly be
expected to thrive. Nevertheless, I have known the latter kept
by Europeans for many months, and I deposited one of the former
safely in the London Zoo ... in 1897, although it was in poor
condition and did not live long. Mr. Rutledge informs me, however,
that this species is kept in some places, so that certain natives must
understand how to treat it." Finn, loc. cit.
Nectarinia pulchella. *" In October, 1904, I was successful in
keeping one of these . . . alive for ten days, at the end of which time
it escaped in perfect health. I placed it in a cage about a yard
square and fed it as follows : At night I used to put a saucer of
honey thinned with water close to my candles. This soon became
full of midges and other tiny insects. In the morning I used to
pick a bunch of Canna-flowers, doctor them liberally with the
mixture and place them in the cage. The bird fed freely at these
from the first and became very tame, sometimes settling on the
flowers when they were still in my hand." A. L. Butler. Ornith.
of the Egyptian Sudan. 1905, 303.

AMALGAMATION OF THE AVICULTURAL
SOCIETY AND THE FOREIGN BIRD CLUB
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9865464375" page_id="56200764"  page_num="328" year="" vol="">
It is with great pleasure that we are able to announce that arrange-
ments have been made by which the Avicultural Society and the
Foreign Bird Club will, at the commencement of the New Year, unite
and become one Society, and from January the first all members of
the Foreign Bird Club will automatically become members of the
Avicultural Society without the payment of an entrance fee.
When the Foreign Bird Club was formed it was the intention of
its founders that it should mainly deal with the exhibition side of
bird-keeping, and that it would not be in any way a competitor of
the older Avicultural Society; but, as years have passed, its journal
has become very much like the Avicultural Magazine, and it has
occurred to many members of both these Societies that there is not
room for two such journals as the Avicultural Magazine and Bird
Notes if run on similar lines, and that it would be very much better
to have one strong, rather than two weak, Societies.
After considerable correspondence and much discussion by the

two Councils, a joint meeting of the Councils was held and an amicable
settlement was arrived at.
It was agreed :--
(1) That amalgamation was very desirable.
(2) That before amalgamation should take place the Foreign Bird
Club should defray all its liabilities with the exception of a sum not
exceeding #25, which would be paid by the Avicultural Society after
amalgamation was completed, and that the Avicultural Society would
not be responsible for any outstanding debts incurred by the Foreign
Bird Club.
(3) That the name Avicultural Society" and " Avicultural
Magazine " should be retained.
(4) That the President, Editor, and Hon. Secretary and Treasurer
of the Avicultural Society should continue in office.
(5) That the President and Vice-Presidents of the Foreign Bird

(6) That the new Council of the Avicultural Society should consist
of eighteen members, ten of whom should be present members or
nominated members of the Avicultural Society and eight present
members of the Foreign Bird Club.
(7) That the rules of the Avicultural Society should remain as at
present except for such slight alterations as might be involved by the
Amalgamation.
(8) That the amalgamation shall date from 1st January, 1925.
In a letter from the Hon. Secretary of the Foreign Bird Club to
the Hon. Secretary of the Avicultural Society he writes : "It gives
me very great pleasure in informing you that there is no obstacle in
the way of amalgamation now, as we can come to you free of debt."

A NOTE ON AMAZON PARROTS
Sirs, -- One is getting used to seeing big consignments of things
come over now-a-days, but I don't remember ever before seeing so
many Blue-fronted Amazon Parrots as I did in Chapman's this week
(3rd November), when he received some 573 odd. One really wonders
if every home in England has a Parrot, or where they all go to. Certain
it is that they steadily disappear from the shop. I was glad to see
that these were a particularly hardy looking lot, having been brought
over on hard seed and water--no soft sloppy messes, which play havoc
with the strongest digestion. Many of these birds were very beautiful,
being peculiarly marked with a great deal of yellow in the plumage,
and they looked healthy, nice birds.

For many years Mr. Galloway has been known to aviculturists,
and has helped them with his practical advice as to the feeding and

the nest, such as Nightingales, Grasshopper-warblers, and other
Sylvidse, as well as Long-tailed Titmice and Golden-crested Wrens.
At one time he had a tame Nightjar, and kept a Swallow for some years.
His intense joy in watching wild birds and in making pets of some
of them was unconquerable. His articles on insectivorous birds, which
he wrote by special request, will no doubt be read with an extra interest.
He passed away at Caversham at the end of October.

<bodyText confidence="0.986826384615384" page_id="56200766"  page_num="330" year="" vol="">
We cannot close the volume for 1924 without referring to the sad
loss the Society sustained by the death on the 26th July last of
Mr. Ogilvie-Grant, which took place at his house, Farley Hill Cottage,
near Reading.
Mr. Ogilvie-Grant was for several years a member of the Avicultural
Society, and served on our Council, and although he was not in the
strict sense an aviculturist, he took a very great interest in aviculture
and rendered help on many occasions to aviculturists who had occasion
to consult him at the Natural History Museum.
Born in March, 1863, Ogilvie-Grant was the second son of the
Hon. George H. E. Ogilvie-Grant of Grant, and was grandson of the
sixth Earl of Seafield. From an early age he took the keenest interest-
in zoology, and in 1882 joined the staff of the British Museum before
the transference of the Natural History section to South Kensington.
He was for years assistant to Dr. Bowdler Sharpe in the Bird Room,
and after Dr. Sharpe&amp;apos;s death in 1909 took charge of the Bird Collection.
He was an excellent field-naturalist, and not only made several
collecting trips himself to out-of-the-way parts of the world, but was
a most successful organizer of expeditions on behalf of the National
Collection. He was author of three volumes of the Catalogue of Birds
in the British Museum, A Handbook to the Game Birds, a most valuable
book to aviculturists, and numerous other works and papers on birds.
Ogilvie-Grant was one of the best of men, a true naturalist and
sportsman, and those of us who knew him will mourn the loss of a very
true friend.

Mr. E. J. Brook, of Hoddara Castle, Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire,
a well-known aviculturist, who at one time owned the finest private
collection of living foreign birds in the world, died on 17th July last
at Hoddam Castle.
On two occasions he commissioned Mr. Walter Goodfellow to
collect living birds for him in New Guinea, with the result that his
splendidly equipped aviaries at Hoddam contained the most wonderful
collection of Paradise Birds and other rare forms, many of which had
never before been seen in captivity. In 1914 Goodfellow went to
Ecuador for Mr. Brook, returning with a unique collection of Tanagers.
During these expeditions numerous skins were obtained, which
Mr. Brook generously presented to the British Museum.
Unfortunately Mr. Brook was never fond of writing, and the
valuable observations which he doubtless made on his wonderful
living collection were never published. He was one of the most kindly
and generous of men, and is much missed by those who were fortunate
enough to know him.
