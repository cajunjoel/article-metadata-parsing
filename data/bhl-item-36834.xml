keen and intelligent ornithologists it could not well be otherwise.
Space forbids ns from noticing this number in detail. It is
lavishly illustrated with photographs showing both the localities-
visited and many nests and yonng birds, and one cannot fail to
be a little envious of Australian ornithologists in having so many
interesting species, nesting within comparatively easy reach of
their large commercial centres. The haunts of the Bine Wren
and of the Crimson Finch will perhaps appeal most to avicul-
tnrists. Those interested in the habits and life histories of
Australian birds might do worse than subscribe to a journal so-
full of excellent articles and illustrations.

MULE AND HYBRID BIRDS*

Last month we had the pleasure of noticing a book by Mr.
Silver on the practical management of British Birds in captivity,
and the book now before ns follows practically the same lines in
dealing with the much more intricate subject of mule and hybrid&amp;apos;
breeding. To the beginner, as well as to the experienced fancier
who wishes to take up this branch of the subject, this book will
prove a reliable and exhaustive vadc viecum, and if the hints given
are carefully carried out, success should be as nearly assured as
it is possible to make it. Mr. Manneringhas very wisely devoted
his space entirely to the practical side of the matter, the hybrids
themselves are not described, though those most frequently seen
on the show bench are figured in the coloured and other plates.
In the case of a book full of good things, it becomes
difficult to mention any special points, but those members who
will remember the discussion which raged some years back on
Cages versus Aviaries will be interested to note that for most
crosses Mr. Mannering advocates the former as giving the
greatest probability of success.
Those who are more interested in hybrids from the scien-
tific side will find much food for thought in many of the author's
notes. The breeding of light mules from sib-bred canaries still
awaits a scientific interpretation, and the details and difficulties
of sib-breeding, as given by a practical breeder, are well worth
a study.

Lastly, a list is given at the end of the book of the known
Hybrids that have been obtained. Although this list does not
claim to be complete (and we notice several omissions) yet it
forms a good basis on which a list may be formed, and being one
of the first attempts to make a complete list is most valuable for
reference.
Practical books, written by practical men, always contain
useful information, and we heartily recommend it to all our
readers, whether they breed hybrids or not, as it abounds in
information valuable to all avicnltnrists.

In spite of the diminution of many of the most beautiful
birds in the world, the demand for the feathers still continues
with unabated force. We do not for one moment believe that
ladies wilfully aid in this destruction, but rather that from the
dictates of fashion and from ignorance of the real state of affairs
they continue to adorn themselves with some of the most beauti-
ful of Nature's creations. In so doing they are exterminating
Nature's works of art, and once destroyed these are gone beyond
a possible hope of ever again existing. Were these facts more
widely realized we feel sure that the trade in these plumes would
cease to exist, and the little pamphlet before 11s, which has just
been published by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
not only puts the case and the results very clearly, but at the same
time gives an answer to the feather traders, who are opposing
tooth and nail an anti-plnmage Bill now before Parliament.
The destruction done by collectors for the plume trade
becomes especially dangerous to the existence of the species
they hunt, because they are usually slaughtered during the nest-
ing season, when the plumes of all birds are at their best, and also
because at such times birds are tamer and many species collect
in large breeding colonies, thus reducing the labour of gettin g the
plumes to a minimum. The enormous destruction that is thus
brought about is almost inconceivable, but the fact remains that
in many parts of its range the Egret has ceased to exist, that on
some of the islands of New Guinea no full-plumaged Paradise

FOR 1910- 1 9 11 .
In the Repoit of the Council for 1909-1910 two important
changes in the administration of the Society were announced,
namely, the acceptance of the Editorship of the Magazine by
Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote and the appointment of Messrs. West.
Newman &amp; Co. as its publishers. The success Mr. Bonhote
has achieved as Editor must be apparent to all readers of the
Magazine ; and the Council desires to take the opportunity,
afforded by the close of the year, of expressing its appreciation
of the benefit the Society has derived from the business-like
methods of the new publishers.
The grateful thanks of the Council are again due to all
those members who have kindly helped to keep the Magazine
up to its high standard by generous donations to the Society's
funds ; and also to those who have so willingly responded to the
Editor's appeal for articles and notes for publication. This
appeal they wish to support by inviting contributions of articles,
not only from those members who have in the past helped the
Society in that way, but also from those who have hitherto
refrained from writing their observations upon birds in captivity.
They also venture again to draw the attention of members
to the need of adding to the membership of the Society, so that
the Magazine may be still further improved, especially by an
increase in the number of its coloured plates and text figures.
Finally, the thanks of the Council are due to Dr. A. G.
Butler for kindly undertaking the Editorship of the present
number of the Magazine during Mr. Bonhote's absence.
Signed for the Council,

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee, to
anj T Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young and furnish such
evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require. The Medal
will be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough
to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bond fide property of the
breeder. An evasion of this rule, in an}' form whatever, will not only dis-
qualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right
to issue it in silver in very special cases), and measures 2\ inches in
diameter. It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest
containing eggs, and the words "The Avicultural Society--founded 1S94."
O11 the reverse is the following inscription : "Awarded to ( name of donee)
for rearing the young of ( name of species ), a species not previously bred in
captivity in the United Kingdom."

SOME NOTES ON A FEW EGYPTIAN DESERT
BIRDS.
By Lady Wm. Cecil (Baroness Amherst of Hackney).
"And as I gaze, these narrow walls expand;
Before my dreaming eye
Stretches the desert, with its sifting sand,
Its unimpeded sky ! "
Longfellow.
What a vision is conjured up by these few lines! The
</figure>

Desert! vast, measureless, silent; glowing golden in the glare
of burning sun, or changing through every hue of rainbow tint
to silver-white, and purple-black in the magic of moonlight.
Always mysterious, always lonely, a world of dreams, a wonder-
land of thought. To the traveller, perhaps, a world of terror, of
sand storm, thirst and death ! Yet here those who look for it
may discover life that is of the deepest interest; the geologist
and the naturalist might here spend years in research, and the
ornithologist find a "happy hunting ground" wherein to exercise
his pet hobby.
The bird-life in the desert is a study well worthy of
attention. How the birds live, how they find food, build their
nests, and rear their young in a land where all is sand and rock,
and rock and sand ; the herbage consisting mainly of thorny
bushes and dry hard grass and prickly scrub. After a little rain,
which falls every two or three years, for a few short weeks the
desert ' blossoms,' perhaps hardly ' as the rose,' but still wee
flowers and green things are brought forth, and many exquisite
little blooms, such as a tiny mignonette and miniature Bugloss
gladden the aching eyes of the tired traveller, as he trudges

Lady Wm. Cecil,
across some secluded valley or wind-swept plain. Even minute
Irises are found in the Nile valley some distance beyond the
limit of irrigation.
But this transformation is only passing; soon the sun
scorches the delicate growths, and withered stalks alone show
where flowers have been.
Among the rocks, he who seeks may find the Brown -
necked Raven ( Corvus umbrinus), the nests of these birds are, as
a rule, built in the clefts of the jagged desert hills, or in holes
high up in some sun-baked precipice. I saw several pairs of
Brown-necked Ravens hovering and flying evidently about their
nests, near the summit of the cliffs between Bir Inglaise and the
Red Sea. These cliffs rise abruptly in an almost perpendicular
wall direct from the desert, and are of a more or less chalky
formation, quite distinct from the granite and sand-stone and
crumbling umber-coloured rocks further west, and the limestone
mountains north, south and east.
The rarer Abyssinian Raven (Corvus affinis&amp;apos;) is also a native
of the desert. This variety, too. has a brown neck, and the
nostrils are fringed with stiff upstanding bristles, which gives
the bird a very ferocious look ; its legs are short, and conse-
quently its appearance is somewhat stumpy. We saw a pair of
these birds on the western side of the Nile, in the Lybian desert,
in February, and another pair at EsSid, perhaps some fifty miles
away in the Eastern desert, a month later.
The Ravens find a plentiful supply of food in the desert,
for they prey upon carrion, and probably also on small living
animals, such as desert mice, jerboas, and young snakes. They
are said also to eat locusts.
The Raven's gruesome feast is shared by the Vultures.
The variety commonest in the desert is the Griffon Vulture ( Gyps
fulvus ) ; a soft white down covers its head and throat, and a frill
of whitish feathers decorates the back of its neck ; it is rather
smaller than its fellow in the desert, the Sociable Vulture
(Otogyps auiicularis), whose neck is skinny, though a little dark
fluff covers the top of its head. Another vulture that may be
seen here occasionally is the Bearded Vulture ( Gypaetus ossifra-
gus ) : this bird is well-named for it has a beard of feathers at

least an inch in length, its head is feathered, and it has long
feathers on its neck.
It is a strange sight to see in the lonely desert one of these
raven and vulture orgies! A party of wandering Arabs or
travelling merchants, with their strings of laden camels may be
seen slowly tramping over the hot dazzling sand, following the
narrow paths, like sheep-tracks on the Downs, worn smooth and
hard by the 'pad-pad' of camels' feet, which for thousands of
years have passed and re-passed the same way. One of the
patient 'ships of the desert' is faint and weary with the weight
of his load and long years of toil. In vain his driver encourages
him with weird noises and snatches of strange song, such as
camels love ; the poor creature at last falls, to rise no more. His
load is taken off, and, with much grumbling and grunting, is
dispersed among the other beasts of burden, and the caravan
passes on. He is left alone in the desert to die ! the last straggler
of the company is scarcely out of sight before his weary limbs
are stretched in death.
All this time, far overhead a tiny speck may have been
seen hovering and wheeling in the pale blue sky; it is the
vulture's 'watchman.' The moment the last breath is drawn,
as if in answer to some given signal, from every side flock the
vultures, more and more they come streaming in,seemingly from
nowhere, and in crowds they pounce upon the still warm carcase,
and soon nothing is seen but a great mass of flapping wings and
straining necks, and cruel, blood-smeared beaks and claws! In
an incredibly short time the white bones alone are left to add one
more land-mark to the 'desert route.' The vultures sit near by
complaisant and fat, too gorged to fly, or even move more than a
few yards from the scene of their horrid banquet. The Ravens,
who have done their best to obtain a share, linger to get what
pickings they can, till they too are satisfied, and then flop
heavily back to their homes in the rocks.
Kites, Buzzards, Hawks and Harriers of several varieties
may be found in the desert, but, as a rule, they frequent that
portion of it which is nearest the cultivated land, and find their
food to a great extent on the river banks. We did not meet with
many, more than a days march into the wilderness.

Lady Wm. Cecil,
The Short-toed Eagle ( Circaetus gal liens) and the Saker
Falcon ( Fa/co sacer) I think range the furthest. The Eagle we
saw in the desert behind Korosko, also at Dendereh, and in the
desert round the Fayuni, as well as much further from the Nile.
The Saker falcon, at El Kab and south-west of Abou Simbel,
and many miles into the desert beyond the Alabaster quarries
near Aswan. The parasitic Kite ( Milvus aegyptius ) which is met
with everywhere in the Nile Valley, we noted building among
the ruins of Meroe.
At Gebel Es Silseleh we found the Egyptian Eagle Owl
(.Bubo ascalaphus) ; not quite so large as the European Eagle Owl,
it is, nevertheless, a very fine bird, with larger, more indistinct
spots on its buff and white plumage. When angry or alarmed it
puffs itself out into an enormous ball of fluff and feathers, spreads
its wings downwards, like a turkey cock, lowers its head, and
snaps its beak and hisses in a very fierce manner.
A few other owls inhabit the desert. For instance, the
pretty little Scops Owl {Scops gin) builds among the rocks, and
in rock-hewn tombs, far from the river. We disturbed a little
family party of Scops, in the tombs in the hills behind El Kab;
and in the more distant tombs in the desert, east of Tel El
Amarna, were two or three pairs.
I suppose the handsomest of desert birds is the Houbara
Bustard ( Houbara undulata) but we sought him in vain. They
are said to have become, of late years, exceedingly rare, but still
are now and again to be sighted on the desert side of the Fayuni,
or between the Nile and the oasis of El Kargeh.
A real lover of the open desert is the Cream-coloured
Courser {Cursorius gallicus). This bird truly earns its apellation,
for it runs 'like the wind ! ' It seems to prefer to use its white
legs instead of its wings, though I have once or twice seen it fly.
In November, one year, we noticed a Courser between Waddv
Haifa and the Second Cataract, and in February, two years later,
saw three of these birds in almost the same place. They are said
to cower in the sand to hide themselves like partridges when
pursued, but I have never seen them do this. Those we frightened
ran away, and in an extraordinarily short time were lost sight of,
reappearing again at some distance, flying further into the desert.

Some Notes on a few Egyptian Desert Birds.
Near Bueb we came across another rather rare bird, the
Egyptian Goatsucker ( Caprbnulgus aegyptidus), a pair of them
were sitting on the sand among some low scrub. I thought
there might be a uest near, as it was late in March and the birds
had paired, but I could not find it.
The Egyptian Swift ( Cypselus murinus) builds in the desert,
and circles round and round above the arid sand, far from the
river. Its colouring is soft pale buff with white on throat and
darkish underneath, and dark on its wings.
Swifts and Swallows seem to be continually eating flies,
yet the ' plague of flies' in Egypt is no whit diminished.
Another inhabitant of the desert world is the Pale Crag-
martin ( Cotile obsoleta). It builds among rocks, under the
sheltering eaves of some overhanging ledge. Its nest is also
occasionally found in rock-hewn tombs, such as those at El
Bersheh or Beni Hassan. We also found it among the ruined
pyramids of Meroe. This Martin is of a soft pale brownish
colour, with deeper shades on head, wings and tail, and on the
latter a few white spots. The underneath parts almost white.
I have often watched them flying in wide circles catching insects
on the wing, as others of their kind do ; I have also watched them
sitting on the ground moving about and making little darts, as if
hunting for, and catching, creeping insects, though I tried hard
I never actually saw them seize anything. It would be interest-
ing to know if this way of foraging is resorted to by the swallow
tribe, and if so, for what reason?
The Desert Chat, or Desert Wheatear ( Saxicola deserti ) is
found all the year round in Egypt and Nubia, and. the Northern
Soudan. Though frequenting the river and canal banks, it also
ranges far from the Nile cultivation and is to be seen at some
isolated oasis or desert well. Its feathers are prettily marked in
browns of various shades, and black and white, it has a black
beak and legs.
Two or three other Chats are distinctly desert birds. The
White-Rumped Chat ( Saxicola leucopygci) is conspicuous among
them. These Chats are generally found in rocky places, and far
into the desert. Sometimes their flight is peculiar, and has
earned for them the name of 'Tumblers.' They rise quickly,

Lady Wm. Cecil,
take a short flight upwards, and turn, and alight again ; this they
repeat four or five times in the space of a few minutes, for no
apparent reason.
We found them at Kasr El Benat, and two pair in the
Waddy Haiuinamat. The plumage of both sexes is the same, and
very distinct. The head usually being black, the rump white,
and the rest of the body and wings and tail black and white.
They may at times be mistaken for the much-rarer Hooded Chat
{Saxicola moiiacha). The male bird only of this variety is black
and white, the white top of the head and back of the neck, have
the effect of a little hood, The female is light brown, with dark
brown wings, and light and dark brown tail. The throat and
breast almost white and a distinct white eyebrow.
The very old birds of the former (W. leucopyga) sometimes
have white heads, and we saw one at Waddy Sabua with a black
and white speckled head. At the oasis of El Gaeta, two days'
journey from the Nile, a little flock of N. monacha, six or seven
in number, were wonderfully tame, hopping and running among
our men and camels quite fearlessly.
A Chat, called by Shelley the " Mourning Chat," is
found in the desert, both in Upper and Lower Egypt. It is a
dainty little bird, pale sandy brown, white on head and face and
yellowish buff breast, with dark brown and black back, a white
tail with dark brown tip and centre.* We saw several in the
desert, but never so far from cultivation as the other Chats
mentioned above. One or two were sighted, between Wasta and
the Fayum, and also at Hawara.
At some distance from Fawakhieh, towards the Red Sea, I
saw two specimens of another Chat, with a distinctly black throat
and a good deal of chestnut colouring about it, with dark brown
and a dark-brown and white tail. I did not known the birds, but
think they must have been either the Black-throated Chat (A.
melanoleuca) or Tristram's Chat (S. moesta). They showed a good
deal of white when flying. I followed the two birds (a pair?) for
some distance, but it was so terribly hot (a broiling mid-day sun
in the desert is not conducive to undue exertion) that I was
obliged to return to the shade and leave my curiosity unsatisfied.
This does not agree with the typical specimens of S. lugens.-- Ed.

Some Notes on a feiv Egyptian Desert Birds.
The Desert Lark (Ammo manes deserti ) is a cheery, friendly
little bird, and those near our camp became very tame, even
venturing into the tents in search of crumbs and scraps, dex-
terously evading the long arms of our pet monkey, who always
hoped, but never managed, to catch one. They took 'dust baths*
in the golden sand, and in the early morning sang their small
twittering song, as they flew from rock to rock. The plumage of
the Desert Lark is sand-coloured, with pale-brown wings and
tail, with flesh-coloured beak and light yellowish-brown legs, so
that it matches its surroundings in a wonderful way.
Another Desert Lark (. A.fraterculus ) known as Tristram's
Desert Lark, is much the same as the former, but it has a spotted
throat. They both came to the camp, and seem to be about
equally distirbuted between Luxor and the Second Cataract.
The large Bifasciated Lark (Alaemon alaudipes) is met with
now and then in various parts of the country, always 'far from
the madding crowd ' and cultivation. We saw it only after some
hours' journey into the desert. Other travellers have also noted
the solitary habits of this bird. Some distance, perhaps three or
four miles from the Der Simutn, opposite Aswan, I once stalked
one of these birds for some way, and got quite near it, but the
moment it caught sight of me it ran on very fast, then 'doubled*
very cleverly behind some rocks, and, after a few minutes, rose
suddenly and flew away, only a few yards above the ground, so
that I soon lost sight of it in the dazzling distance of sand that
quivered in the heat. This lark has a spotted throat, and very
dark-brown and white wings.
I think it is permissible to place the Crested Lark (Galerida
cristata) among desert birds, for they are always found in Egypt
on the edge of the desert and in waste places. In the dreary
Arab graveyards, and on the outskirts of the fellaheen villages,
between the river and the sand, also many miles from any
cultivation. They are knowing-looking little fellows with their
odd pointed crests and bright eyes! The brown and buff of
their colouring varies very much, and appears to take the tone
of the locality which they inhabit. Those living in rocky dis-
trict, such as Gebel Es Silsileh, or further south among the
granite rocks of Aswan, were darker than those in the open

Lady Wm. Cecil,
plains where the sand is paler. Some observers found these
birds in Upper Egypt lighter in colour than those in Lower
Egpyt. Those I have taken note of appear to vary more with
the soil than with the latitude.
Among the smaller birds found in the desert is the Desert
Bullfinch or Trumpeting Finch (. Eiythrospiza githdginea). Its
colouring is very distinct, the pale mottled brown plumage being
shaded with rich pink, which in the breeding season deepens
to a crimson rose-colour. Trumpeters are generally met with in
small flocks, often a long distance from the Nile. They invade
the plains of Thebes, and other grain-growing districts when the
corn is ripe, and at other times the desert is their home. In the
stretches of sand in the valleys near the Tombs of the Kings, I
have seen them in large numbers. Also between Aswan and
Shellal near the ancient wall, (the date of which, by the way, has
never yet been determined) we met several flocks, constantly, and
also many miles further into the desert. They build in low
bushes and in stunted sont trees, and in the Spring time, their
distinct, clear note may continually be heard.
The Tawny Pipit ( Anthus campestris ) is another ''child of
the desert." So like their habitation are they, that, although
they are larger than larks, they are extremely difficult to see,
unless they are moving. They became very friendly with us,
and came constantly to visit our camp, like the Desert Larks.
The Rock Thrush ( Monticola saxatilis ) with the coat of
tender shades of grey and brown and deep rufous, is a beautiful
bird. All the winter it may be found, but in Egypt and Nubia it
is not common. We found it at Illalium and at Gebelain, at
Kalabsheh, and among the rocks at Gerf Husein. The Blue
Rock Thrush ( Monticola cyanea) is perhaps the most fascinating
of desert birds. It is less shy than the Rock Thrush, and a pair
of them came almost daily to our "diggings" at the Goubat El
Hawa. They became marvellously tame. Each afternoon they
sang to us as we worked, perched on a black rock set in the
sand of burnished gold, the slanting sunbeams bringing out in
its full beauty the dark indigo, and bright sapphire of their sleek
plumage. And what a voice the handsome little gentleman had

Some Notes on a fezv Egyptian Desert Birds. 31
What sweet trills and clear liquid notes were poured from that
small vibrating throat, and what a joy to hear him sing.
Far away from the haunts of men, in the wild desert
" Waddys," where the dry camelthorn, and withered Haifa grass
flourish, and trailing plants of Colocinth shake off hard seed-balls
to roll about on the smooth sand, where the only water visible is
the phantom lake of some fast-vanishing mirage, and the only
shade is thrown by barren rocks ; such a place is the home of
the Desert Partridge (Ammoperdix cholmleyi ); the plumage of
this bird blends exactly with this background, sandy fawn,
brown, dark grey and black, with a little white on its head
behind the eyes, warm red-brown and dull orange-brown, every
colour in fact of a desert picture. We found this bird in several
places, but the greatest number at Waddy Kammamat at El-Sid
and Svala. In all three places they were running about, hiding
from intrusive visitors behind rocks or big stones or under the
thorny scrub. We got almost within arm-length of some by
slowly stalking them with the greatest precaution; keeping
hidden and silent, we watched them for some time unseen. They
seldom fly, unless greatly alarmed, but run from rock to rock,
keeping cover as much as possible, like the most perfectly
trained "scout."
When they do take wing, it is only for a short flight, to
some other and safer hiding place. It seems almost a mystery
how these birds feed in this inhospitable place, but there must be
a good supply of grubs and seeds, which are invisible to the
humani eye, for the Partridges we saw were very plump. Water,
too, must be within range ; not the deep wells on the desert
route, but quiet little water holes hidden away in the heart of the
grim mountains, and known only to the beasts and birds of the
desert. That there are such delicious places, cool pools fringed
with ferns is well known, though only seen now and then by
some enterprising explorer and the thirsty desert beasts who hold
the secret fast. The Singed Sand Grouse (Peterocles exzistiLz) also
ranges from the river, and flocks of these birds may be seen in
many parts of the desert. They fly for miles over the " weary
waste" to seek water, and may now and then be discovered on
the river banks in numl&amp;gt;ers. They travel very swiftly from far

Lady Wm. Cecil,
away, drink their fill, and as swiftly return whence they came.
The early dawn is the time they are generally seen on the Nile
banks.
A curious instance of the instinct of the Sand Grouse fly-
ing direct to water, was witnessed by a party of travellers in the
desert in 1864.
The weather was frightfully hot, as it was in the month of
July, the water in the goat-skins had gone bad, and on reaching
the halting place, where they expected to replenish the supply,
they found the well dry! They were suffering terribly from
thirst, but were obliged to continue this journey, as they feared
the attack of a hostile tribe, so they dare not retrace their
steps.
Towards evening one of the party, a keen sportsman, and
observer of bird-life, noticed a pack of Sand Grouse making for
some distant hill. " Those Grouse are flying towards water," he
exclaimed ; but the Arab Chief, by whom they were accompanied,
shook his head doubtfully. "True," he replied, "there are
springs in those mountains, but alas ! Khawjeh, at this time of
year, they will be dry!" The traveller however, insisted 011
following the birds, and found to his great joy, and the relief of
all, that the intelligence of these little feathered guides was
proved, for after a long, weary ride they discovered, in a hollow
of the rocky hills, a beautiful, clear spring of deliciously cold,
fresh, water.
Some years ago a pack of Sand Grouse (Syrrhaptes para-
doxus) spent the winter in Norfolk, and we timed their flight
from their chosen haunt to the lake, where they came to drink
every morning ; they covered the distance of two and a half
miles in about a minute and a half
We once, for some time, had a pet Sand Grouse in a cage
which it shared with a tame Cuckoo. This bird often uttered
its quaint call of " Gutta, gutta" (hence its Arab name) when
seated at the bottom of its cage; thus in captivity, at least, it
refuted the theory, that the bird only calls when on the wing. It
was amusing to hear the "Gutta gutta" while its companion
flew from perch to perch calling " Cuckoo cuckoo," a very quaint
duet!

Some Notes on a few Egyptian Desert Birds. 33
Another variety of Sand Grouse is the Senegal Sand
Grouse (Ptetocles senegallus&amp;apos;) ; it is a much rarer bird, but now and
again those who search for it, may find it! or a lucky chance
may lead the seeker to its feeding ground. But it is far from the
Nile, and by unfrequented paths, that the searcher must travel.
The Senegal is much the same size as the Singed Sand Grouse,
but it is distinctly lighter in colour and it has not the black
" waist belt " that looks so smart across the breast of the Singed
variety.
Rarer still is the Coronetted Sand Grouse (Pteroclus coro-
natus). It is found in Nubia and the Northern Sudan ; and in
colouring imitates the ground on which it nestles and cowers, so
exactly, that it is almost invisible till it moves its head and
shows the black on chin and neck, which is its distinguishing
feature. It is rather a smaller bird than either of the other Sand
Grouse.
This list of birds might be very greatly added to if those
were included which inhabit the river banks, where the desert
conies down nearly to the water's edge, and the line of cultivation
is narrowed to a strip of beans and lupins, tamarisk bushes,
sont trees and Palms. But these birds can scarcely be classed as
purely desert birds, as they more constantly feed on the mud
banks and in the cultivated patches, and roost and build in the
fringe of trees.
I hope that a sufficient number of true desert birds have
been mentioned to show that the solemn silent desert-world, is
not the "pays mort" that it is proverbially understood to be, and
that a weary wanderer may be cheered by the sweet chirping and
songs of many " feathered choristers," and that the man of
science, to whom the study of bird-life is an absorbing occupation
will find in the wilderness much material for observation and
research.

By Dr. A. Gunther, M.A., F.R.S.,
Hon. M. Avic. Society.
All Aviculturists will have studied with interest our
Editor's long list of birds, of which he was able to indicate from
his own experience the ages to which they have lived in confine-
ment (Avicultural Magazine, igio, p.p. 259, 299). I accept, with
pleasure, his invitation to contribute some of my records, aud
hope that other aviculturists will do the same.
Considering the great variety of factors, by which the limit
of life of captive birds is determined, generalisation from isolated
experience is not of great value, and the more numerous the
observers are who would contribute to the enquiry initiated by
Mr. Bonhote, the nearer and sooner we should arrive at the truth.
Thus, although my experiences as regards the Wryneck uni-
formly point to this species being unsuitable for confinement,
other aviculturists may have followed a different treatment with
very different results. I have kept many birds, but only a small
number at the same time, having made it a rule to attend to them
myself. Only of the most interesting did I keep more or less
complete records, and of them I offer on the present occasion
the following selection.
Nightjar (Caprimulgus europaus).
Once only I had the opportunity of rearing this bird from
a nestling. It was a historic specimen, being one of the two
nestlings figured by Gould in his " Birds of Great Britain " ; it
was barely a week old when Gould gave it to me. I had no
difficulty in rearing it, having a sufficient supply of moths,
beetles and mealworms, to which, after a week or two, I added
small pieces of raw beef. Being absent from home during
the day, I could feed it only in the course of the evening, giving
it one meal in the morning. But this was quite sufficient, and the
youngster grew into a very handsome (male) bird. He was never
confined in a cage, but was allowed full liberty to roam about in
my study, where he eventually selected the top of a bookcase

as his perch during the day. When insects became scarce. I
gave him a mixture of Spratt's dog-biscuits (ground fine), yellow
of egg (raw), dried ant's eggs, mealworms and raw beef, which
could easily be rolled into balls ; he would swallow two or three
in succession several times of an evening ; at other times he
refused food. He never learned to take up food by himself, but
greedily took it from the hand. With the disappearance of day-
light he became very lively, using his wings sparingly, running
with a sliding motion over the carpet and a sofa, stopping fre-
quently to scratch the ground and uttering a low purring sound.
He never showed any signs of shyness or timidity, but one day,
about Christmas, he was startled by the sudden and noisy
entrance of a person into the room, and flew out of the open
window which had been left without a wire guard. I saw him
alight in a neighbouring field, but never found or saw him
again.
These scanty notes will show at least that the Nightjar can
be kept in good health ; if taken young and not confined to a
cage, and that by its interesting habits, so different from those
of our other birds, it will amply repay the trouble which its keep
*entails. I must add, besides, that Mr. Galloway, of Caversham,
has kept one for a considerably longer time, and that, according
to an account in a foreign periodical, a German avicnlturist has
reared two young birds, which, in the year following, have nested
on the floor of the room in which they had been brought up.
Carrion Crow (Corvus corone).
Taken from the nest when nearly fully-fledged ; kept in a
small enclosure, but most of the time allowed free run in the
garden ; at first the wing-feathers of one side were shortened,
but after a year or two the bird, which proved to have been a
female, had full power of flight, of which she made occasional
use, absenting herself for two or three days. She was perfectly
domesticated and very fond of being petted by those she knew.
She lived with me 9 years and 8 months, and was found dead one
morning in her roosting place. A P. M. examination revealed
nothing but an inflamed condition of the skin of the throat, with
several punctures, like the pricks of a needle, for which I could
not find an explanation.

Dr. A. Gunther,
Nutcracker (Nticifraga caryocaiactcs).
My two birds were obtained from a dealer, and of uncertain
age. I bad them some months when both showed symptoms of
gapes, but they survived nearly to the end of the second year.
I knew that their aviary had been infested by some young
Pheasants which had died from gapes, but as the place had been
thoroughly cleaned out, disinfected and replanted, and, besides,
had been inhabited for three or four successive seasons by Wag-
tails, Nightingales and Bluethroats, none ol which showed any
signs of disease, I considered the aviary to be in a safe and sanitary
condition. The Nutcrackers were succeeded in the occupation
of the same aviary by Quails, Japanese Tits and Shrikes, all of
which escaped infection. Of course it is possible that the Nut-
crackers were infested already when I bought them, although I
did not observe any suspicious symptoms. The question then
arises, whether only certain species of birds are liable to be
attacked by the worm ( Sclerostovia syngavius ), while others enjoy
imm unity.
Black-necked Grackle (Gracupica nigricollis).
This is an inhabitant of Burma, and some parts of
Southern China. It is very rarely brought to the Loudon
market; I see that the Zoological Society has had only three
specimens. Mine was bought by the late Lord Lilford about
1895, and given to me by Lady Lilford shortly after her husband's
death (1896). It certainly was not less than three years old when
bought of a dealer, perhaps several years older, possessing ils
full plumage, strong beak and feet, and having all those character-
istics, specific or individual, which make it such a highly valued
domestic pet, fully developed. He (it is a male bird) has, there-
fore, reached the respectable age of about iS years, enjoying good
health, but for a crippled foot caused by an attack of gout some
four years ago; a calamity which has not disturbed his equa-
nimity or temper even for a single day.
This species is quite equal in intelligence to the Mynahs,
with which it has much in common, but seems to be inferior
to them as a linguist; my bird never learned a word, although
he has many distinct varieties of expression. But he surpasses
the Mynahs in amiability, evincing great affection for some

members of the family, while children and dolls are objects of
jealous hatred, and furiously attacked.
Red-backed Shrike (.Lanins collurio).
A pair were bought as nestlings in July, 1903, and are
still with me in perfect health ; the}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are therefore at this date
7 years and 4 months old. These birds nested altogether six
times, rearing our of their broods ; their nesting in 1904 and
1905 has been described in the Aviculturcil Magazine .
They again reared their young in the two following years.
In 1908 they were not allowed to nest; but in 1909 they produced
again three young which were killed by cold and heavy rain-
storms before they were fully fledged. This year, which has been
fatal to so many broods of birds, they commenced their nesting
operations as late as the middle of June, and left the nest un-
finished without even laying an egg. I am afraid both birds are
now getting too old for reproduction, although they do not show
an outward sign of failing health.
The hen bird went through some adventures ; she escaped
from her aviary at Kew late in the autumn of 1907. I am in-
formed by Mr. W. Frost, the ornithological collector, that she
was caught by a Hammersmith bird-catcher on Barnes Common,
and was rescued by him. Mr. Frost kindly restored her to me
in the following summer. Her conduct on returning to her old
home, as well as a scar at the base of the upper mandible were
sufficient evidence as to her identity.
Robin (Erithaczis nubecula).
Male rescued from a cat, lived for 4 years in the common
Warblers' cage.
Blue-throat (Cyanecula suecica).
An imported bird, lived for 3 years in an outdoor aviary.
Nightingale (Daulias luscinia).
A nestling reached an age of 3 years and 4 months in a
double-sized Warblers' cage ; it was a male, but its song was very
imperfect.

Dr. A. Gunthek,
Yellow Wagtail ( Motacilla /Java, subsp. ?)
A female, imported from Russia; after having been kept
in an outdoor aviary for two years, was transferred to the
Zoological Gardens.
Tui (.Prosthemadcra n. Zelandicc).
When Tuis were brought to England more frequently
than they are at present, I obtained several, only to share the
common experience of aviculturists, viz., to lose them a few
months after they had been settled in their new home. The
birds became inordinately fat, lost much of their sprightliness,
and while seemingly still enjoying perfect health, fell into a fit
of convulsions and died. I had kept mine in a roomy, high
cage, allowed them almost daily exercise in a room, and fed them
on Abraham's (the chief importer of Tuis) Insect-food with the
addition of raw soft fruit. Thinking the cause of the disorder
must be overfeeding, I finally reduced the quantity of food to
one-half, adding a small quantity of cooked fruit (in the form of
strawberry, or grape, jam). Under this regime my last two Tuis
survived two and four years ; and if I should ever again be for-
tunate enough to possess a specimen, I should place it in a
covered out-door aviary. It would be impossible to give even a
vague estimate as to the age to which this species may live in
captivity in Europe, all the birds which I have seen having been
evidently adult when they were caught. Much as aviculturists
of the present day may regret its absence from the English
collections of living birds, it was a very commendable measure
on the part of the New Zealand Government to protect a type
of such great faunistic interest throughout the colony and to
prohibit its export to foreign parts.
Hoopoe {Upupa epops).
Old birds rarely survive the first year of their captivity
and retain their natural timidity and shyness, while young birds
taken from the nest, not only get reconciled to captivity, but, if
properly treated, become charming pets, which are never happier
than when in company of those who attend to them. Having
given elsewhere {Field, 1900, Jan.) an account of the habits of
this species in captivity, I have only to add here that of the

many individuals I have kept females seemed to be longer-lived
than males; one female attained to an age of four years and seven
months, and I believe she would have survived an unusually cold
winter if I had been more careful about the \0x25A0 night-temperature
of the room in which she was kept.
Wryneck (Jynx torquilld).
This bird was for many years one of my favorites, but,
unfortunately, also the one with which I have had no success
in keeping for any time. The nestlings take at first, greedily,
artificial food mixed with insects, but when they have once
learned to take food by themselves, they become more dainty in
their appetite. They continue to thrive while fresh ants and
ants' eggs are obtainable, but after that, not even a liberal supply
of mealworms and dried ants' eggs will save them from becoming
anaemic, and dying before the middle of winter.
Thick-Knee (Oedicnemus crepitans&amp;apos;).
I kept this bird once only. It came to me as a nestling in
down, a singular creature with a most violent temper. It would
hiss and peck at the hand offering a piece of meat or worm, and
then tear away the morsel and swallow it. However, it grew
rapidly, and after a month or two was strong enough to escape
from its aviary into a small garden. I had given up all hope of
seeing it again, when it was discovered crouching in the well-
known Thick-Knee fashion in the middle of the lawn. How it
escaped the cats, then and afterwards, has always been a mystery
to me. I pinioned the bird, and when it had recovered, allowed
it the free run of the garden. There it lived, foraging for itself
and partly fed with scraps of meat and soaked biscuit, for a
whole year, until it was killed in its second winter by a deep fall
of snow, having reached an age of i year and 7 months.
Gradually it had lost much of its shyness. It jealously guarded
the dish in which it received its food against Sparrows and
Blackbirds, and in the second summer of its life was sometimes
seen amusing itself by aimlessly running about and practising
the Bustard-like attitudes, by which the male Thick-Knee woos
the hen. (cf. Bonhote, Avicultural Magazine , 1906, p. 10S).

Stork (Ciconia alba).
I add tliis species to this list, because a pair have been
under my constant observation, living in Kew Gardens, close to
my house, for the last ten years. They nested and reared their
young for the first time in 1902 (see Field , 1902, Aug.) and have
continued to do so annually, losing their brood in three years.
I counted the other day seven birds, the two old and five
survivors of the last three successful broods; others had been
given or flown away. The old birds are pinioned, but have the

HYPHANTORN 1 S CUCULLATUS and

In the November number of the Avicultural Magazine for
last year (p. 33) I described the nesting of a pair of Spotted-backed
Weavers ( Hyphantornis spilonotus ) and the hatching of one
young bird, which, however, was unfortunately not reared.
The old birds remained outside all the winter, the cock
assuming his full colour early in the year--I think in March.
No effort at nesting was made by the birds and the cock seemed
quite disinclined to build before June. Early in the month he
died, and I spent some time endeavouring to replace him, but
without success. Finally, about the 1 Stli of June, I took a cock
Rufous-necked Weaver (//. cucullaius ) from the Zoological
Gardens, and placed him with the old hen in a garden aviary
some twenty feet square with indoor shelter.
The birds appeared to pair within a day of the introduction
of the cock, who immediately started to weave nests. None of
these were approved of by the hen, until a nest was commenced
atrd finished in the top of a thorn tree some eight feet high.
This nest was also attached to the wire-netting of the roof, and
was within a few inches of the site of last year's nest, which had
been cut dowtr for preservation.

H. sbilonotus) was composed of grass stems, and was finished in
a few days, and was lined by the hen with feathers, cow-hair, and
privet leaves. Incubation commenced on the 24th of June upon
three eggs, all of which were pure white, and large for the size
of the bird. The eggs of this species appear to vary consider-
ably, being frequently spotted. These eggs should have been
hatched in fourteen days, and on the 8th of July live ant pupae
were supplied, and for a week the hen bird behaved exactly as
if she had young. I was suspicious, however, as I had found no
egg shells, and on the 15th of July examined the nest to find that
she was still sitting.
The eggs were taken away and were, of course, useless.
On being blown only one appeared to have been fertile. I am
inclined to attribute this non-success to the vile weather ex-
perienced at the time and the very exposed situation of the nest.
For days together torrential rain had soaked it and the nights
were extremely cold.
The cock while incubation was proceeding had, as seems
customary, built many additional nests, none of them of the
complete pattern, but thinner and smaller than the one in use.
One nest, however, was built inside the house, about six feet
from the floor, on a dead branch of Cupressus, and the hen, when
her first nest had been taken down, took possession of the indoor
nest and commenced to line it. A great quantity of feathers was
used, so many in fact that they protruded from the under side of
the nest. Whether or not she chose this nest after her ex-
perience of an English summer I am unable to say, but it was
certainly a wise move. Two eggs were laid, and she commenced
to sit on the 20th July, that is five days after she had abandoned
her first nest.
I have never seen the cock enter the nest or feed the hen
or the young birds. O11 the 3rd of August I discovered an egg-
shell under the nest, which spoke of a clean hatch, and the
supply of insect food was commenced. I think most members
of the Society know what this means, especially when dealing
with birds which will not touch any known kind of soft food.
Live ant pupae were supplied many times daily, most of which
disappeared down the throat of the cock who certainly did not

Mr. Wm, R. Fasey,
transfer them to his offspring. This fact, combined with his
unwelcome efforts to persuade the hen to occupy new nests, and
also the belief that the young bird hatched last year was killed
by the cock H. spilonotus induced me to confine the offender, and
he was placed in a large cage where he could see the hen without
annoying her, and without doubling the necessary supply of live
food.
I am personally averse to supplying mealworms to the
young of birds of this size in any quantity, and it is astonishing
to see the amount of ant pupae which go to the feeding of one
young Weaver. Small worms, caterpillars, and flies were also
supplied. On the iotli of August the young bird could be heard
squeaking in the nest, the call resembling that of the young
Sparrow. I left home on the 17th of August, a lady neighbour
kindly consenting to look after my birds. She supplied insect
food many times daily. However, when the young bird was
almost fully fledged it appears to have fallen out of the nest, and
to have been unable to get off the floor where it was killed in the
night by mice. The specimen was sent on to me and, though
disfigured, was very healthy. The general colour on the back,
head, wings and tail being a dusky olive, with the breast lemon-
yellow, the centre a brighter yellow, beak and legs horn colour.
From the bright streak of yellow down the breast I believe
the bird to have been a male, and had it lived it would have been
interesting to note the full colour when adopted, since the males
of H. spilonotus and H. cucullatus differ considerably.
Since then the hen has laid three more eggs and incubated
the full time, but none have proved fertile.
SOME EXPERIENCES WITH PARRAKEETS, ETC.
By Wm. R. Fasey.
One sometimes reads of a mixed collection of birds being
kept in an aviary with expectations of young birds being reared.
I am afraid " expectation " is generally as far as it goes, especially
when Parrakeets are concerned ; at least that is my experience.
I would not like to say success cannot sometimes be obtained,
but the results will be far from encouraging. I have had young
birds such as Rosellas, Cockatiels, Budgerigars, Love Birds, etc.,.

leave the nest to be invariably killed by some spiteful member of
the collection, although in an aviary 30 feet long and 15 feet wide.
Parrakeets require an aviary for an individual pair to get
the best breeding results ; and most of them will readily bring
off a brood of youngsters if given an aviary large enough to keep
them in fit condition and good health. The aviary, I think,
should not be less than about fifteen feet long and six or seven
wide, with a grass flight.
Budgerigars, Cockatiels and Love-birds will go on repro-
ducing at an alarming rate.
Rosellas will generally rear two broods, most others one.
Blue Bonnets and Browns seem to require something I
have been unable to discover vet ; after eight years of perseverance
with several different pairs I am still unsuccessful, although at
the same time and with similar conditions, others and more rare
species readily nest.
A mixed collection of Parrakeets in a large aviary is of
course a delightful and amusing sight, and one I would not like
to be without. You will see them continually on the move; woe
betide the unwary individual who sleeps when some other
member swoops down.
A mixed collection must, however, be carefully selected to
avoid bloodshed. Blue Bonnets for instance are regular butchers.
I had many deaths before I found out these were the culprits.
I remember a-year ago a pair getting into the next aviary to a
pair of Browns, and in less than half-an-hour they had killed the
cock and scalped the hen, which I just saved from death ; the
Blue Bonnets had scarcely disturbed a feather.
The following will be found to agree : King Parrots, Red-
wings, Rock Peplars, Barraband, Pennants or Rosellas (but not
both), Many Colours or Redrumps (not both) if Pennants are the
choice, but Rosellas do not like them ; a pair of Connies are
pretty but noisy: Blossom-heads, Cockatiels, Budgerigars, Love-
birds, and I have a number of Giant Whydahs which add much
to the interest and beauty of the aviary.
The Grass Parrakeets are too rare to include, although
I have had them in a mixed collection and found them inoffensive
birds when left unmolested. But they do a bit of fighting on
their own account without, however, serious consequences.

Bird Notes from the Zoological Garde?is.
When, I wonder, are Turquoisines coining over? I have
one, and perhaps the only one in Europe ; at least I would like
to know where there are any others.
Pileated I have not yet tried in a mixed collection, but I
propose turning out four youngsters of this year's produce ; if
they do agree they will make delightful additions.
Barnards, Pennants, Mealy Rosellas, Rosellas, Browns and
Many Colours fight like turks together and must be separated.
One of these days I will try if the hens are excluded, as Pheasants
are kept, if it will stop the bloodshed.
Mice were troublesome until I concreted the floor and
nailed sheet zinc one and half feet up the sides of the aviary.
I now put the seed on the floor, and when they drop down they
cannot get back, so if they have not already pined away and
died which is generally the case I quickly despatch them. I
now very rarely see one.

Some interesting birds have been received during the last
month, foremost amongst which are two specimens, apparently
a true pair, of the South African Giant Bustard, locally known
as the Gom Paauw (Otis kori ). This is not only the largest
bustard in Africa, but the largest of all the family, and one that
is very rarely brought home. These birds arrived together with
a Stanley Crane and a rare Harrier Eagle (Circaetus pectoralis),
all of which were presented by Dr. Peringuey to His Majesty the
King, who has deposited them in the Gardens, and they are to
form part of the South African collection which it is intended to
exhibit next summer.
Major Harington has presented a White-winged Wood
Duck (Asa?cor?iis scutulatus), from Burmah. This is an extremely
rare species, and the present example is the first ever received
by the Society. It is a large duck, of a blackish-brown colour,
with white upper wing-coverts and a white head minutely speckled
with black.
A very fine pair of Japanese White-necked Cranes have
been received by exchange, also a pair of Monaul Pheasants, a

By Dr. A. G. Butler.
I have been asked to write something for our Magazine,
but my birds are growing old and have done nothing worthy ot
record for the past two years, so that it is difficult for me to
think of a subject worth writing about.
King Solomon, who was the Linnaeus of his day, tells us
that "he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow," and
there is no doubt whatever that this statement is true as regards
Natural History, for the study of that science becomes more
complex and difficult every day.
When I first took up Entomology, and especially the study
of Butterflies, nothing whatever was known about seasonal
phases, so that all forms which exhibited constant differences
were confidently described as distinct species ; when it was
discovered that the summer and winter phases of Butterflies
frequently bore little resemblance to each other, the number of
recognized species had to be considerably reduced.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
As with Butterflies, so is it with Birds; difference of
plumage, even when it is not sexual, is by no means always
indicative of specific distinctness : in some cases it merely stands
for youth, as in the case of Calcenas gouldice of Gray with its
greenish-black tail, which proved to be merely the young form
of the common Nicobar pigeon : of course this is by no means
an isolated instance. Then again there may be difference of
structural outline without appreciable difference of plumage due
to the same cause, as I have pointed out in the case of the
Bluebird I bred, which, after it had attained its adult male
colouring, still possessed the broad bill characteristic of a
young bird.
The seasonal plumages of Birds have doubtless been re-
sponsible for considerable additions to ornithological synonymy :
it is impossible for this to have been avoided, until the life-
history of the species had been studied either in its native
haunts or in suitable aviaries; therefore, for the cabinet orni-
thologist to decry the work of the aviculturist who is helping
him to the truth, almost makes one wonder whether, where his
own species are liable to go to the wall, he really desires light
on the subject.
Apart from seasonal changes of plumage, we find also
changes in the colouring of the soft parts ; and, where these are
very marked, the summer and winter types are very liable to be
regarded as distinct species. The soft parts also become modified
in colour with age, as I proved in the case of Paroaria capitata,
the young of which had the eulmen of the beak and front of the
tarsi slate-grey, which colouring gradually disappeared as the
adult plumage developed, though some examples retain it longer
than others.
To complicate the study of birds yet more, we not only
find sexual differences, juvenile differences, and seasonal differ-
ences, both in the plumage and the soft parts, but we meet
constantly with slight local modifications which the modern
cabinet-worker now regards as subspecies, and dignifies with a
place in the nomenclature. Unfortunately the students of bird
skins are not all agreed as to the rank of these localized forms,
as witness the article by Mr. P. R. I y owe, in " The Ibis" for 1908

on the local representatives of Chamcepelia passerina which are
all regarded as distinct species.
Although I consider the binomial system, as applied to all
constantly differing forms of life, far more simple than the
modern trinomial system ; it cannot be denied that the latter, if
judiciously applied, may express relationships more accurately
than the former ; but as it often is applied, it entirely misre-
presents the relationships of such forms as originally had a
common origin ; giving to the offspring of great antiquity the
same rank as to that of yesterday.
For birds which only differ markedly in the colouring of
the soft parts (and a study of the field-notes published by various
collectors show that these are sufficiently numerous to be worth
consideration) I should consider subspecific rank amply sufficient;
but before naming these, it would be as well for the technical
worker to assure himself that such differences were constant to
locality, and not due to either youth or season.
Now it is obvious that unless a collector resides for at least
one year in the native birth-place of a species, he cannot
satisfactorily decide to wliat extent its changes of colouring,
either of plumage or soft parts, are permanent, whether they are
sexual, juvenile, or local ; but if he brings back living examples
and either hands them over to the Superintendent of a Zoo-
logical Gardens or to the owner of suitable aviaries, these
questions can be satisfactorily settled at home, and thus the
describer of species and subspecies can be safeguarded.
In Nature the more one knows, the more one discovers of
the unknown ; and therefore each seeker after knowledge should
recognize with gratitude every little mite of assistance given to
him by his fellow-workers, and not assume an attitude of superior
wisdom because he, sitting at a desk with a large library at hand, is
intelligent enough to describe in detail the skins which lie before
him, and indicate in what respects they differ from their nearest
allies; nor if he be a student of bird-life, and privileged there-
fore to understand the real creatures as the exclusively museum-
naturalist can never hope to do, must he regard with contempt
the sometimes tedious and often perplexing labours of the
systematise since without him it would be impossible for either

Editorial Notes.
the field-naturalist or the aviarist to speak or write intelligibly
about birds.
A truly great Naturalist always deplores his own ignorance
and never loses an opportunity of expressing his indebtedness
to all those who have in any way assisted him ; such a man was
Charles Darwin, and it would indeed be well if all ornithologists
whether they be systematists or aviculturists would follow his
example both of humility and gratitude : mutual help is the
very spirit of civilization and progress, but it is much to be
feared that, as a rule, there is more envy, hatred, malice and all
uncharitableness among students of Nature than among almost
any other seekers after truth; it is all very childish and
mischievous.
EDITORIAL NOTES.
We hear from Mr. Astley that his Hooded Siskins ( Chry-
somitiis cucullatus ) have nested this year in a small breeding cage
and hatched two young ones, which, owing to being disturbed,
they only reared for a week.
Mr. Rathborne writes asking us if we can identify a bird,
recently imported from the West Indies, probably from Trinidad.
The gentleman who brought them home calls them ' Cissas.'
Mr. Rathborne writes: "They are insectivorous and quite as
large as a Lark. Snow white breasts, black caps and long
straight tails like the Swallow tribe. Can any member suggest
what they are?&amp;apos; 4 &amp;apos;
We were told the other day that for the last two or three
years a foreign aviculturist has succeeded in breeding the Wall-
creeper. Considering that this species is very difficult to keep
in captivity, the keeping and successful breeding of these birds
is a feat of which the owner may be justly proud.
In the current number of the Revue Frangaise d&amp;apos; Ornithologie
appears a short article by a M. Maillard on alterations produced
in captivity on the colours of birds. After dealing shortly with
the different kinds of moult, he points out that colours due to
A subsequent letter seems to point to the bird as Milvulus tyrranus, which we have never
before heard of in captivity.

structure are hardly altered, but the colours chiefly affected are
the pure pigment colours, especially reds and yellows. He
suggests that this alteration is not so much due to lack of suitable
food as to lack of light. When we remember that birds from
damp and dull climates tend to become duller and darker, and
that those species of tropical birds such as Sunbirds, Humming
Birds, Kingfishers, that spend their life in brilliant sunshine,
are the brightest of all birds, there may be something to be said
for M. Maillard's suggestion.
We have received a Prospectus and a specimen plate of a
new work on Australian Birds, by Mr. G. M. Matthews, a well-
known member of the B.O.U. This work promises to be the
most complete account of the birds which has been issued since
Gould's famous book, and will be lavishly illustrated with hand-
coloured plates. It will be issued in parts at two guineas each,
and it will be completed in about thirty parts. Part I. containing
some of the Ratite Birds (Emus and Cassowary's) will appear
this month.
Capt. Flower has just issued a reprint, brought up-to-date,
of his List of the Zoological Gardens of the World. In England
we notice the addition of two new Gardens since last year : one
at Halifax in Yorkshire, under the management of Mr. A. R.
McKill, and the other in the Edgbaston Gardens at Birmingham.
A paper on the subject was published by Capt. Flower in
the Zoologist , for May, 1909, p. 161.
While on the subject of Gardens, we may note that pro-
posals to open Zoological parks in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and
Liverpool are being actively considered at the present time.

second and concluding portion. Part I. dealt with some four
hundred species of the smaller foreign cage-birds, and the present
volume adds some six hundred more species, comprising the
larger birds, such as Parrots, Doves, Birds of Paradise, Wood-
peckers, Starlings and Crows. The author appears to have in-
cluded nearly every species imported up to the end of 1908, and
he believes the Doves to be complete up to the end of 1909.
We have been through the work carefully and have little
but praise to bestow upon it. The species appear in the strict
order of affinity in which they have been placed by systematic
ornithologists, and the account of each is as complete as possible,
both as regards its treatment in captivity and its wild life.
This work appeared first in the pages of Canary and Cage
Bird Life , a weekly journal, hence its production has been slow,
and some of the information is not quite up-to-date. For in-
stance, on reading the account of the Rock Parrakeet ( Ncophema
petrophila&amp;apos;) one is led to infer that the only pair definitely known
to have been imported were those mentioned by Russ as having
been purchased from Abrahams and sent to the Continent;
whereas in the spring of 1907 two pairs were imported by Messrs.
Payne and Wallace, who again obtained quite a number the
following year.
No mention is made of the rare parrots imported by Mr.
Goodfellow in the spring of 190S, namely Aprosmictus chloropterus ,
Charmosyna stellce, Charmosynopsis pulchella , Idypocharmosyna
placens and Cyclopsitta diophihalma. Moreover, the pair of so-
called Golden-shouldered Parrakeets obtained by Mrs. Johnstone
in 1902 (p. 230) have since been proved to have belonged to
another species, the Hooded Parrakeet (. Psepholus cucnllatus) of
North, to which all of the recently-imported " Golden-shoulders"
are referable.
Regarding the food for Lories and Lorikeets in captivity,
the author mentions milk-sop as being recommended by those
who have kept these birds, and, while admitting that he himself
has had no experience with Lories in captivity, expresses a doubt
that "so utterly unnatural a food as milk-sop can be good for any
Parrot." Nevertheless we have abundant evidence that Lories
and Lorikeets fed on milk-sop, especially when given with a

certain proportion of barley-water as recommended by Mr. Brook,
very rarely have any ailment whatever, and live to a considerable
age.
An Index to scientific names is printed at the end of the
volume, but it is a pity that the specific as well as the generic
names are not indexed in alphabetical order. Moreover, the
omission of an index to the popular names is, in our opinion, a
fault that should be remedied in a future edition.
With these few comments we commend the book to our
readers with the assurance that it will be found a very valuable
addition to their libraries. The author's task has been no light
one, and he is to be heartily congratulated on having produced
the most complete general work on foreign birds from the
avicultural standpoint that has yet been produced. D.S-S.
The July number of the Emu , the organ of the Australian
Ornithologists' Union, has come to hand, and contains as usual
many articles of interest on Australian birds. Mr. Iredale gives
a most interesting account of the birds of the Kermadec Islands
off the N.E. of New Zealand, illustrated by several photographs,
and Dr. W. McGillivray describes a six weeks bird excursion in
the Region of the Barrier Range. Notes on the habits and food
of the Helmeted Honeyeater (Plilotis cassidix ) should be of use
and interest to aviculturists, and the many other shorter articles
and notes deal exclusively with Australian Birds.
The water birds of Point Pinos, California, have been
effectively dealt with in a paper by Mr. R. H. Beck, in the Pro-
ceedings of the California Academy of Sciences. Ninety-four
species are dealt with, though the notes merely refer to their
occurrence and the time of year, and are not, therefore, of special
interest to our members. Under the heading water birds are
included Grebes, Divers, Gulls, Terns, Petrels and Waders.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE SEX OF THE BLACK-CHEEKED LOVEBIRD.
Sir,-- In 190S, and again in 1909 at page 149, I wrote to the effect that
the iris of the male of this species is of a lighter colour than is that of the
female. Mr. Astley, in October, 190S, also states that the colour of the eye
of the male differs from that of the female.

Correspondence.
Last autumn, my flock had increased in number to twenty-two, and
many were sent away. On trying to sex them, I found that the eyes were
of several different shades, and that I was unable to sex the majority of
them by the colour of the eye.
1 have to-day (September 24) been catching up some of my Lovebirds.
For quite a time they have often been sitting together in couples, doubtless
in pairs ; with great care I succeeded in cutting three couples off, couple bv
couple, from the others and caging each couple by itself. In each of these
three cases, one bird had a light and the other a dark eye. I think, conse-
quently, I am justified at any rate in saying that this difference in the colour
of the iris very probably is a true sexual difference, notwithstanding Mr.
Temple's opinion as expressed last March at page 165. Most or all of these
six birds, by the way, are grandchildren of the original specimens. As
regards the confusion of last year, I can only suggest--as assuredly takes
place occasionally, however rarely, with individuals actually bred in this
country--that the birds were thrown out of gear by the transfer of the
species from one part of the world to another.
There is one point I have not settled. To-day I did my utmost not
to disturb the old birds but to catch only the young ones. Whether, there-
fore, the old females still retain the brown-red irides I referred to last
February (p. 133) I do not know.
Perhaps it is worth mentioning that these grandchildren of this year
are for the most part better coloured than were their parents at the same
age. Reginald Phieeipps.

Sir,-- Mr. Tescliemaker in his article on the Sulphury Seedeater, in
the August number of the Avicilltural Magazine , appears to doubt the
correctness of Dr. Butler's description of the female of this species.
I can assure him it is quite correct, as in E. Pondoland, where I have
spent many years, this bird is common.
From Mr. Teschemaker's description of his female bird, I rather
suspect that he has been crossing two species, the female being, most likely,
the White-throated Seedeater {Serious albigularis), which species answers
the description well. The latter species is a common bird in the South and
South-Western Cape Colony. C. G. DaviKS.
p.S.--The birds being of different species may account for the
difficulty in breeding them.--C. G. D.

ROSS' TOURACOU.
Musophaga rosso?.
By L. M. Seth-Smith.
This beautiful Touracou is by no means uncommon in
Uganda wherever patches of forest are found, and it spends most
of its time in the forest, coming out to feed on its favourite fruit
trees when they are bearing.
It has the habit--common, I think, with most Touracous--
of rapidly running up branches and taking hops from branch to
branch and thus is soon lost sight of among the thick trees. When
flying, the red on its wings is very conspicuous, but this colour-
ing is quite covered by its dark blue coverts when at rest. It is
usually seen in pairs, and I never remember seeing it in flocks,
like one sees the large blue Touracou (Corythocola cristata). This
latter bird is frequently seen in companies of ten or more, flying
across some open space in the forest, one after another, at short
intervals.
About July 6th, this year, I called to see a friend, living
some twenty-five miles from Kampala, the native capital ot
Uganda, who kept a few birds, and among them a lovely pair
of M. rosso?. He had just received orders to move, and as he
was unable to take these birds with him, and I was shortly re-
turning to England, he kindly gave them to me. The birds had
been reared from the nest which, I was-informed, had been built
in a comparatively low tree outside the forest. I have never
found their nests, but had imagined that they were placed in the
depths of the forest at the top of inaccessible trees. No natives
whom I have asked have ever been able to tell me anything

about their nesting habits ; in fact, the Baganda take no interest
in natural history unless it be connected with food. The majority
know nothing about birds, and can only tell one the names of a
few of the commonest. Their information has at all times to be
received guardedly, as the names they give often turn out to be
entirely wrong, and some would I believe make up a name
rather than disappoint you, as they think, by not giving a name
at all.
The Baganda are also very bad climbers, which, I think,
strikes one as curious, the general idea being that any nigger
can climb like a monkey, but the reason is probably to be found
in the fact that all their food is easily obtainable without the
necessity of climbing.
To return to the Touracous. They were rather wild for a
day or two in a cage as they had been accustomed to a small
flight aviary, but they very soon settled down and were greatly
admired on board ship on the way home.
Their food consisted almost entirely of fruit, but a little
meat was also given, as I was told that there had been at one
time several small birds including Vidua principalis in the aviary
with them, but that these had gradually disappeared except the
male principalis , and the Touracous were supposed to be the
culprits. I cannot vouch for this and I do not know whether
my friend had actually witnessed it, but they quite appreciated
the meat which I gave them. The fruits given to them at
different times included bananas, mangos, grapes, peaches,
oranges, plums and apples; nothing seemed to come amiss,
although they probably preferred mangos and grapes. Before I
received them, boiled sweet potatoes had been their main food
with occasionally a ripe banana ; sweet potatoes seem to be an
excellent food for almost any animal, and one's 'boys' will re-
commend them even for carnivorous animals, but as I pointed
out above the natives are not naturalists.
The crest of these Touracous appears to be of just the
same tint as that of the red wing feathers, and it would be
interesting to know whether the colouring matter of the crest
feathers is soluble like that of the wing, one would imagine not,
unless the bird puts its head under its wing in a rain storm.

Otocompsa jocosa.
By Maurice Amseer, M.B., F.Z.S.
I feel sure that Napoleon of aviculturists Mr. Teschemaker
will not resent my supplementing his notes on the breeding of
the Red-Whiskered Bulbul.
I obtained two birds--probably from the same importation
as Mr. Teschemaker's--in 1909; they were much alike, but one
was longer and slimmer than the other and, moreover, much more
noisy. I labelled this bird a cock, the shorter and plumper bird I
thought was a female and marked with a ring.
It is owing to this precaution that I am able to publish
what I hope are a few unknown facts about the species. During
the whole of 1909 the birds spent their time together with a few
Cardinals and made no attempt at breeding; they spent the
winter out of doors without heat, and appeared to be as hardy
as Sparrows.
On the first of May this year I saw the cock trying to
build on a small feeding shelf, and as the aviary they were in
was at that time very crowded, I removed the Bulbuls to another
smaller enclosure, about 7ft. square ; here all attempts at nesting
ceased. On May iotli I transferred them to an aviary, 18ft. by
6ft., where they at once began to persecute a pair of Virginian
Cardinals, which I had to remove. On May 20th the cock
began building again, this time in a covered travelling cage
which I had fixed in a Poplar tree. Fibrous roots were the only
material employed at first, but on the 23rd the hen took matters
in hand, lined the nest with hair and laid her first egg on the
25th; she started sitting on three eggs, but laid a fourth 011 the
28th. At first things looked rather hopeless, as she came off at
the slightest alarm ; as time went on she became steadier, but
would never stay on when anyone passed the aviary.
On June 7th there was a heavy thunderstorm, and the hen
bird was off the nest most of the day. She behaved better on the
following day and hatched out her first and only chick on the
-9th of June. One egg had disappeared, one turned out to be

clear, and the fourth contained a dead chick. While the young
bird was in the nest he was fed entirely by the hen on gentles
and mealworms. On June 22nd I noticed the old birds were
frantically excited, and on looking round found the youngster
sitting at the top of his native tree about ten feet off the ground.
I feel certain that he had left the nest too soon, but he never
returned to it and roosted each night in the open. He seemed
to have an enormous appetite, and clamoured for food from dawn
till dark, his wants being now attended to by the male bird also,
in fact it was owing to the latter that I was able to withdraw my
supply of insects, for he seemed to think it was high time the
youngster was weaned from his extravagant and selfish diet.
He, therefore, appropriated the mealworms for his own con-
sumption, and occasionally fed with gentles, but preferred "soft
food " and banana.
On July 4th the young bird could feed and the parents
were repairing their old nest. On the 8th the hen was sitting
on four eggs, and although she was still very uncertain and
seldom sat for more than an hour on end, three chicks were
hatched out on the 18th. Now began a series of catastrophies.
In the course of the next few days all three young birds were
thrown out and appeared to have empty crops. I was inclined
to place the blame for this on the original young bird, who was
still being fed by the parents, I, therefore, caught him up and
disposed of him to a fellow aviculturist.
On July 31st the hen was again sitting on three eggs, which
all hatched out on August nth and 12th. I then decided to
leave the feeding door of the aviary open, and allow the parents
to forage for insects in the garden ; this I did for a few days,
but the cock bird refused to leave the aviary, the hen only going
in and out several times a day. She seemed, however, to prefer
the usual supply of mealworms, etc., and as she was rather
inclined to stay out longer than I liked I finally gave up the
experiment and shut her in again. While it lasted, however, it
was an interesting experience, but not one I should like to try
with a valuable bird.
Again I was doomed to disappointment, for by August the
20th the last of the chicks, who was well quilled, was thrown out

of the nest. I then went for my holiday and returned on Sept.
14th. when my man informed me that the hen had laid a clutch
of four eggs during the last few days of August, started to sit on
the 28th, and hatched out on Sept. 10th. When I looked in the
nest I found one young bird three or four days old, and another
dead on the grass close by. The following morning, as I expected,
the last of the four was also dead and flattened out by the hen's
kind attempts at resuscitation. I have no doubt that nesting
operations would have commenced again, but I caught up both
birds and have since parted with them.
My result was, therefore, one young Bulbul reared from
fifteen eggs, of which eleven hatched out. The usual clutch
appears to be four, and the incubation periods were fourteen days
for the first and last nests and ten days for the second and third.
I believe that if I had supplied live ants' eggs and more meal-
worms, instead of a diet consisting almost entirely of gentles, I
should have been more successful. Anyhow, I have verified
Mr. Teschemaker's statement that our whiskered friend is a
persevering individual.

I send a few notes to accompany some excellent photo-
graphs which my friend Mr. F. Barber-Starkey has taken of a few
of my birds, and I hope they may be of some interest to your
readers.
The Tittle Bustard.
Though none of the Bustard family are adapted to aviary
life, and are apt to become dull, lethargic, and, I suspect, dys-
peptic, unless they have plenty of room for exercise and range
for natural food, the Tittle Bustard being so much smaller than
the other species which have been tried in confinement, is less
exacting, and can easily be accommodated anywhere on a light
soil, where a dry sunny run can be found, with shelter from wind,
and a shed with a floor of sand, or peatmoss, for cold nights and
bad weather.
Except where much persecuted, I believe all Bustards

Mr. W. H. St. Quintin,
prefer open undulating country, with scattered bushes for shelter
to a completely bleak surface. At any rate, the Little Bustard
must have small bushes and tufts of coarse grass to nestle up to,
if he is to be made really comfortable.
The females, and the males too, except when in nuptial
dress, are &amp;apos;extraordinarily inconspicuous in dry, coarse grass, as
they bask in the sun. A few square yards of ashes and sand,
protected by a roof, but open to sun and air, are much appreciated
for dusting purposes, for, of course, these birds do not wash.
In the plumage of the first year, the sexes of living birds
of this species are not easily distinguished. But, after the first
moult, in the second autumn, the vermiculations on the feathers
of the upper parts, especially of the shoulders, are much finer in
the male, the corresponding feathers of the female being marked
with broader lines, and henceforth the sexes are easily distin-
guishable at all seasons. In the spring, the male assumes a
striking nuptial dress, the neck and breast being decorated with
black, white, and lavender grey bands, as shown in Mr. Starkey's
photograph which accompanies these notes. The breeding dress
was assumed by my young males at the end of their second year,
but the females did not lay till they were a year older.
Originally (four years ago) I had three pairs, but I am
sorry to say that I have lost two of the males, in spite of great
care taken with them. I think the damp of early autumn was
the cause of death in each case.
The birds under notice came from South Russia, but I
have had them from Spain also, but, unfortunately, always males.
In winter, and in exceptionally bad weather at other times, the
birds are confined a good deal in sunny, dry, sheds, on a floor of
peatmoss. In spring and early autumn they are out during most
days, and from April till September they are outside night and
day.
They are no doubt all the better for as much fresh air and
liberty as possible, but all Bustards are miserable in wet weather,
and are apt to mope and stand against some sheltering fence or
bush, and are then better under cover.
When in health the)&amp;apos; are, like the larger Bustards, full of
frolic, and this has nothing to do with any nuptial display, but is

merely due to exuberance of spirits. When they are in this
mood, they 'set' towards a companion or a human visitor,
crouching to the ground, with tail erect and wings spread wide,
then springing aside they pose again, and then suddenly resume
their ordinary attitudes as if nothing had excited them.
Little Bustards are generally peaceable enough, except just
at the breeding season, but they are nervous, and the move-
ments of a mouse or even of a companion at night, will cause them
to spring up suddenly, with great violence, to a height of five or
six feet. I lost a female in this way, which broke her neck
against the roof of the shed, and now I have divided the latter
into several compartments, one for each bird, and have had no
more accidents.
The display of the male is striking and peculiar. Even
before his nuptial dress is quite complete his neck feathers begin
to stand out, and he runs about with head held high and eyes
blazing with excitement. He selects some favourite spot, and
spends most of his time thereon, at intervals trampling with his
feet, as it were marking time, and bleating like a miniature goat,
then tossing his head with a resounding 'click,' which can be
heard much further than the bleat, and finally leaping in the air a
yard or more high, he displays the white portions of his plumage,
while his wings make a peculiar whistle, all these movements no
doubt deliberately calculated to attract attention. This per-
formance is probably partly a challenge to rival males, but also
certainly a true display. If a female approaches, he leaves his
stand and rushes off in pursuit. While he behaves quite gently
to the mate of his choice, he joins her in hunting off any other
females with considerable violence. Whether the Great Bustard
may rightly be called polygamous or not is disputed, but the Little
Bustard undoubtedly pairs. In the breeding season the females
fold their tails like a fowl (hen), and are quarrelsome amongst
themselves.
I have so far been unlucky that, both this last summer and
in 1909, when my Little Bustards went to nest, the weather was
so exceptionally unfavourable at hatching time. The hens made
scratcliings amongst bunches of coarse grass, and my largest clutch
consisted of three eggs. The birds sit very close, and are quite

Mr. W. H. St. Quintin,
concealed by the overhanging blades of grass. During the past
summer, a bird that was sitting steadily was washed off her nest by
a specially severe storm, and the eggs got chilled and the chicks
perished in the shells. Last year several eggs were dropped in
the enclosure, and were put under Silky-game hens. Young
were hatched, but we could do nothing with them. They would
not pick up food of any kind, nor take it when offered them ;
one was kept alive for a week by being crammed, and then died.
In a favourable season I think the birds might be bred, but the
young, if hatched, must be left to the parents who, no doubt, like
the Cranes and Rails, pick up food and hold it to the young to
take from their bills. Indeed, last year, I saw the female, whose
eggs had been spoiled by the rain, running about some weeks
afterwards with food in her bill, make a curious clucking noise
as if to call up her offspring, which alas ! were not forthcoming.
Little Bustards are nearly omnivorous, and will eat almost
anything of animal or vegetable nature that one is likely to offer
them--boiled vegetables, cooked meat and bread are greedily
devoured, but the staple food of all my Bustards is good freshly-
ground barley-meal, scalded with a little Spratts' Poultry meal
and crissel, and mixed into a crumbly mass, which can be fed to
the birds outside in pellets or balls, and in their pans when they
are shut into the sheds. This they get thrice a day, with three
or four times a week some sheep's heart at one of the meals.
I am in favour of birds of this class having meals, rather than
that the allowance of food should be left by them throughout
the day. It is more easy to attend to the wants of a bird that
wants favouring, and it makes the birds pleased to see one, and
therefore, tamer. If there are Rooks or Sparrows about it also
prevents much waste. In addition to all this, my birds have
plenty of opportunities of grazing, which they take advantage
of, and at the seasons when grass is not growing, or when they
are in the sheds, they have cabbage or lettuce. I always have
found Little Bustards hearty feeders, which all aviculturists
know is a great point in their favour in captivity.
Besides the Great and Little Bustards, the only species of
this family that I kept is the Oriental Houbaras (//. macgullnii )
two of which I have kept for several years. Unfortunately they

are, as I believe, both females. I have not found them difficult
to manage, they generally run with the Little Bustards, and live
as they do. They are particularly fond of cooked vegetables,
celery, all 'greens,' seakale and peas; also they greedily swallow
mice, after beating them against the ground. No doubt, in a
wild state, locusts and small lizards would be important articles
of their diet.
My birds are rather sluggish, and spend much of their time
in fine weather basking in the sun. But, of course, in captivity
they are spared the necessity of searching for food. It is a pretty
sight to see the Houbaras, Little Bustards and Australian Tliick-
uees--eight birds in all--run to the shed when shutting up time
comes in the evening, each bird turning into its proper com-
partment, and in this way giving very little trouble and showing
considerable intelligence.
#
The Australian Thicknee.
A bigger bird in every way than the European species, and
proportionately longer on the leg, it has a general resemblance in
plumage to our bird, with the same beautiful prominent eye, but
has not the handsome yellow cere of the Norfolk Plover. I
have found that they bear a considerable amount of cold, but
they must be protected as much as possible from exposure to
rain or damp ground, which last they never frequent in the wild
state. Like the Bustards, they revel in sunshine, and spend
much time basking; but, unlike the Bustards and like their other
allies the Plovers, they are fond of bathing. A look at a Thick-
nees' eye will lead anybody to guess that the bird is largely
nocturnal, which is the case. At sunset, when left out all night,
my birds range all over their enclosure, every now and then
stooping to pick up some wandering insect, and, like the Cranes,
they give a good deal of attention to the high wire fence which
separates the different enclosures, and for the same purpose. If
they hear a Dor-beetle strike the wires, which frequently happens
on a summer's evening, they hurry up, and the clumsy insect
before he can recover the use of his wings is seized and, after a
few vigorous blows on the ground, is swallowed. The plaintive
wailing whistle reminds one of the cry of our bird, which may
be heard at best on parts of Salisbury Plain and in its other

haunts. Sometimes one bird calls alone, but, frequently, after
two or three notes, the other chimes in, and a melancholy duet
follows, which often surprises strangers, for my birds are ex-
tremely tame, and being under no necessity of concealing their
whereabouts, often whistle at all times of the day. My Thicknees
have not laid, but they are good friends and there are differences
in plumage, and I have hopes that they are a pair, and if we ever
have a genial summer again, they should go to nest.
Mr, Starkey's third photograph shows a drake Common
Scoter, which I did not keep long. It had evidently been caught
some time when it reached me, was light in flesh and had been
kept from water till its plumage had lost all its water-shedding
qualities. This is a great mistake on the part of the Dutch
netters and the cause of the loss of many an interesting bird,
for without the greatest care such a bird, when it finds water
before it, soaks itself again and again, and if the weather be at
all cold, often contracts pneumonia or other lung trouble.
I have not found Scoters nearly so easy to acclimatize as
some sea ducks, such as Eiders, Scaup, and Golden Eyes for in-
stance ; but I once had two Scoters sent to me late in the spring,
which, as they were light in condition, I turned out on to a large
pond to take their chance, unpinioned, but with flight feathers
shortened. These birds got through the summer and, after
moulting out, escaped. Scoters will eat pieces of fish, bread and
barley, and Spratts' meal scalded. No doubt mussels or cockles,
if obtainable, would be desirable additions.
I do not know if it is the experience of other aviculturists
that the sea-ducks, strange as it may seem, are more sensitive to
cold than the fresh water species, even than those from South
America or Southern Europe, but I have found this so and in a
good many cases. At this moment I have a Scaup drake who
always looks unhappy on a frosty morning, when Marbled Ducks,
Brazilian Teal and Nyroca, for instance, show no symptoms of
feeling chilled. I reared eight fine young Eiders this summer
on a small field pond with high sheltering banks. When the
time came for moving them to their permanent quarters on a
large open piece of water, it happened to be a particularly cold
unpleasant day (in September). For several days all the young

Eiders looked tucked up and miserable, and one died of
pneumonia. O11 the other hand, though I cannot speak from
experience of other young sea-ducks, young Eiders must be
carefully protected from the direct rays of a scorching sun, or
they will certainly succumb to what appears to be heat apoplexy
and that quickly. We are now after sad experience, always ready,,
if a day threatens to be hot, to thrust into the ground plenty of
leafy boughs to make a shady shelter, which the Eider ducklings
quickly take advantage of.
I should like here to call the attention of those who keep
ducks to the necessity of keeping them supplied with grit and
coarse sand. My eyes were first opened to the fact that ducks,
even of tender age, require this aid to digestion, when I was staying
with a friend who was at the time rearing large quantities of
so-called wild ducks. The ducklings visited the heaps of cinders
that were left, as the cooking stoves which prepare their maize
meal were shifted about; and it was noticed how quickly this not
very promising substitute for grit and sand was consumed. I now
supply flint and quartz grit to my ducks, as well as land-birds,
and I find the best way, and the most economical, to give it is in
large bowls or weighted wooden boxes sunk beneath the surface
of the water. In some soils this, of course, is not necessary, but
where the ponds are muddy and the surrounding ground deficient
in gravel or sand, I am sure it is of great advantage and tends to
keep the birds in health.

Those who write about birds and pose as our teachers
and masters have, as far as I know of their productions, always
given us to understand that this is a rare species ; so it came as
a shock to many of us last February when it was announced that
some sixty pairs had reached the Port of Eon don. The explana-
tion given to me was that, hitherto, they had been accounted rare
because people had not gone far enough to meet with them, but

Mr. R. Phiixipps,
that, if one penetrated deep enough into the interior of the con-
tinent (Australia), they would be found to be common enough.
Be this as it may, one point strikes the ordinary man--that, how-
ever common it may or may not be, our would-be teachers have
not yet settled among themselves whether the species is to be
permitted to have any sexual difference in plumage or not.
Volume XIII. of the British Museum Catalogue of Birds
gives, amongst other details:-- Adult ?nale --"Lores, a narrow
eyebrow, feathers below the eye, and fore part of cheeks scarlet ;
throat and under surface of body black, the chin and upper
throat with scarlet-tipped feathers; centre of fore-neck and chest
also scarlet; sides of the breast and abdomen black, spotted with
white." Adult female --" Similar to the male, but with only the
lores and the feathers above the eye scarlet; no red on the
cheeks or throat; the latter, as well as the fore-neck, black,
spotted with white ; the whole of the under surface browner
below and more plentifully spotted with white; only a tinge of
scarlet on the breast." " The males differ from each other in the
amount of scarlet, which sometimes extends over the whole of
the throat and down the entire breast."
This volume was published in 1890, and allows the male to
wear a more brilliantly-coloured waistcoat and necktie and more
paint on his cheek than his mate; but eleven years later this
privilege was cancelled, and--of all men--by no less favoured a
person than the man on the spot. In 1901 there appeared
Campbell's Nests aud Eggs of Australian Birds which, while
dealiug primarily with the nests and eggs, often gives additional
particulars of interest and importance. At page 4S2, Mr. G. A.
Keartland, the ornithological collector of the Horn Expedition
(1894) is quoted without comment as follows :--"Although there
is no sexual difference in plumage, they vary with age. The
scarlet patch, so conspicuous on the breast of adults, is almost or
entirely absent on the young ones, and the rich black on the
under parts of the mature birds is also replaced by a smoky black
on the young." Here we have the positive statement--" there is
no sexual difference in plumage."
Up to as recently as last April, it would seem that the wise
ones of the earth were still in uncertainty and content to remain

so, for some sixty pairs of living birds had been, as it were, flit-
ting far and wide about the country--north and south and east
and west--during some two months, and the ordinary man had
inspected their plumage and formed his own conclusions. In that
month, in a weekly Bird paper, there appeared an article on the
Painted Finch which included both of the above references, and
that without remark, contradictory though they be.
The statement that the plumage of the young (" they vary
with age") differs from that of the adult may be accepted with-
out question ; but the assertion that " there is no sexual difference
in plumage " seems to be contradicted by the living specimens
that are with us, whose feathers sav that the writer of the account
of the species in the British Museum Catalogue which appeared
twenty years ago differentiated the sexes with commendable
accuracy.
Even if we suppose that the majority of the Painted Finches
now in this country were fledgelings when caught, still it must
be borne in mind that, for this class of bird, a rather long time
must have elapsed since that event took place. I was told that
the catcher had had them caged some two years by the time he
had finished his wandering expedition after various species and
they were all on board ship. This sounds a long time--let us
reduce it to six months, but even that will make the youngest well
over a year old. In several aviaries they nested this spring, then
moulted, and since have been nesting again and still are nesting.
If these are not evidences of maturity, where are we to draw the
line between the young bird and the adult ? Of these birds from
Australia I have three females, and, of these three, only one
(presumably a much older example) has any scarlet about the
face and fully comes up to the description of the adult female in
the B.M. Catalogue, whereas the other two have no scarlet on the
lores and only a speck on the breast. All three have laid eggs
and at least one has had young, so may, I should suppose, be
classed as adults; at any rate they must be accepted as being as
old as the males. But the males have their catalogued allowance
of scarlet, much more than the old female can boast of, and the
sexual difference in plumage is plain enough for any one to
see. Has any body experienced difficulty in sexing his Painted

Finches? Possibly quite old females may become more like the
males, but at present the sexes can be distinguished at a glance.
I may add, however, that "age" seems to have made two of my
females less red generally but considerably more black on the
under parts.
I have heard it stated, with all the assurance of one who
knows all or nothing about it, that it is the habit of the Painted
Finch to roost on the ground at night. When circumstances are
not favourable or to its liking, the Painted Finch does go to the
ground a good deal; nevertheless I am satisfied that it will not
pass the night on the ground unless there be something wrong.
Usually it is a symptom of weakness or sickness. This spring,
before my Painted Finches were turned into the aviary, their
favourite roosting place was on and towards the tip of a long
slender twig of a dead thorn bush in a pot in the birdroom, some
2--3 feet off the floor. Where they roost now I do not know, but
there are no reasons for supposing that they roost on the ground.
The call-notes of this species are a kind of querulous
chur, chick and chuck-, but they vary considerably, while main-
taining such a family resemblance as to be always recognisable.
A few of the notes are not very unlike one or two of those of the
Quail-Finch, but there is no need to mistake them. The song of
the male is inaudible in the garden, though possibly not so in a
quiet room ; it is usually introduced by three, less commonly
four, of its chuck notes. When singing on a perch, the male
holds his head up and turns it from side to side, after the manner
of Gouldians ; but, when singing on the ground, he extends the
head over the back of his mate, and moves it from side to side as
if waving a flag. Owing to the noisy calling of nestling Cuba
Finches, I am unable to say if I heard the young of this species
while in the nest; the squeak of the fledgeling is a very squeaky
squeak.
Notwithstanding an occasional squabble amongst them-
selves, the Painted Finch seems to live on friendly terms with
other inmates of the aviary. On one occasion I noticed a fledge-
ling Cuba cuddling up, side by side, with an adult male Painted
Finch, on a high perch in the sun. The effect of the combina-
tion or, rather, non-combination of colours was curiously uu-

happy. The friendliness of the elder bird towards the tiny
stranger, who had its own fussy little parents not many yards
away, was, however, pleasing to behold.
Although, perhaps, not exactly gregarious, these finches
are sociably inclined ; and, if their home be large enough, it is
probable that several together will succeed better than will one
solitary pair.
I have found these birds tame and confiding but not
familiar in the aviary, sometimes unsteady in a cage ; but I read
that they are timid in the wild state. The latter I can readily
believe, for, in my reserved aviary, although they freely come to
the feeding-ground in the front, they stay but a short time and
then fly rapidly back to the hidden recesses of the interior. The
fledgeling was most aggravating in this respect, just coming for-
ward, taking a peck or two, and then darting off and disappearing.
One might suppose, from its name, that the Painted Finch
is a beautiful species. Certainly a fine male, in a favourable
position, is a brilliant fellow ; but neither in elegance of figure
nor delicacy of colouring is he to be compared with a good male
Violet-eared Waxbill.

A PLEA FOR CAGE BIRDS.
By Mrs. Stanley Flower.
I have been asked to write some of my experiences in
bird-keeping, but as I am at present away from both my birds
and notes it is rather difficult to be accurate, so that I feel it
best to confine myself to expressing in print what I have so
often felt on seeing birds in captivity, and that is their want of
occupation.
Of course, I do not refer to birds in large aviaries, where
shrubs, branches, grass and ponds are allowed ; but the average
small cage contains nothing whatever to provide occupation for
its little inhabitant. The perches are fixed and uninteresting,
the food is placed on one side, the water on the other, and there
is no other distraction whatever except an occasional bath or
perhaps a bit of sugar to peck at! When we remember the

A Plea for Cage Birds.
busy life of the majority of birds--especially small birds--when
in a wild state, we cannot help realising that such a life of forced
inactivity, so contrary to their natural habits, must of necessity
be prejudicial to their health and happiness. After many years
experience in the keeping of birds I have found that a cage on
the following lines will, if furnished as I shall suggest, not only
provide a happy and healthy home for its occupant, but also add
immensely to the interest its owner will have, in watching the
habits and manners of the bird. The plan I find best is as
follows :--For perches I provide the branch of some leafy tree,
or even a fir-tree bough, and the birds come at once to one of
nature's own perches. Here they find plenty of occupation in
pulling off the leaves, pecking at the bark, looking for insects,
etc., chirping and singing in a way which shows that they are
happy in being busy.
Another great joy to the songsters is a handful of green
stuff thrown on to the floor of the cage, and with it some stones
and sand, etc. The turning over of this is a continual joy to
any birds, and I am of the opinion that the exercise they get in
this way adds materially to their longevity. In the hot dry air
of Egypt I find that it is not necessary to clear away this green
stuff every morning, and I usually add more to the pile every
day till it forms a little heap, and the amount of time my birds
spend in turning over and playing with this rubbish heap
speaks well for their appreciation of it.
The rest of the furniture consists in a shallow bowl of
water, and another bowl of seed, on the cage floor. Naturally a
good deal of the seed gets scattered over the rubbish heap as the
birds feed, but the finding of it again as they pull about among
the green stuff adds but greater zest to their exercise.
In a cage of this description I have kept the following
birds with success :--
Paradise Whydah bird ( Vidua faiadisea) nearly nine years,
and still living.
Amaduvade Finch (Spotaeginlhus amandava&amp;apos;) seven years
and five months.
Black-headed Chestnut Finch (Munia atricapilla) nine and
a half years. Still alive.

Of course I am not touching on breeding cages or their
care, but I feel very strongly that if only people would take a
little more time and care over the furnishing of the ordinary cage,
they would be more than repaid by the increased health and
happiness of the birds in their possession.

During the past month some interesting additions to the
collection have been made, of which the following are especially
worth mentioning: --
From the Zoological Society of New York have been
received a collection consisting of four Clapper Rails ( Rallus
lojigirostris), three Blue-winged Teal ( Qtierquedjila discors ), four
Green-winged Teal ( Nettium carolinensis ), two Bahama Tree-
ducks ( De?idroceygna arboreal), two Green-tailed Towliees ( Oreos -
piza chlorurd), one Albert Towliee (Papilo alberti ), two Canyon
Towliees ( P. mesoleucus), four White-crowned Sparrows (. Zono-
trichia leucophrys ) and three Gambel's Sparrows (Z. gambeli).
This is a particularly interesting collection as all except the last
two species and the Bahama Tree-ducks appear to be new to the
collection.
The Carolina, or Green-winged Teal very closely resembles
our Teal, but the male differs from the European bird in possess-
ing a distinct white bar on each side of the breast. In the Blue-
winged Teal, the male is a particularly handsome bird with pale
blue upper wing coverts, and a large crescent-shaped patch of
white in front of the eye.
The Towliees, of which the three species received are all
new to the collection, belong to a group of bunting-like birds of
which there are some twenty species in the North American list.
Besides the two species of Teal above mentioned we have
received by purchase two pairs of the beautiful Cinnamon or
Raffles Teal ( Querquedula cyanoptera). The male is a bright
chestnut red all over, with brilliant blue upper wing coverts,
which are only visible when the wings are extended.

Five specimens of Jackson's, or the Drooping - tailed
Whydak ( Drepanoplectis jacksoni ), two Crimson-ringed Whydahs
(.Penthetria laticauda), and two White-cheeked Colies ( Colins
leucotis ) have been presented to the Society bj r Mrs. G. Style.
The two species of Whydahs are both new to the collection ;
they are both said to be common around Nairobi, but at present
the birds imported from East Africa are few and far between.
A Black-throated Hangnest ( Icterus gularis ), a Banded
Tinamou ( Crypturus noctivagus&amp;apos;), a Ground Hornbill ( Bucorax

that are worthy of special mention.

REVIEWS.
THE HOME EIFE OF THE SPOONBILL. *
The fascinating pursuit of bird-photography is responsible
for the production of this beautiful little book. The title is
perhaps somewhat misleading, as it deals not only with Spoon-
bills but also in equal detail with the Home Life of the Stork,
Common Heron and Purple Heron. The plates, which form
the chief feature of the book, are extremely good, and being
the actual photos, suitably mounted on tinted card, there has
been no loss of detail in reproduction, and they form some of
the best illustrations we have seen. The text, which is by com-
parison a minor portion of the book, is very readable, the author
is undoubtedly a keen observer and, apart from the added interest
given to the pictures, his story abounds in many little facts
which, if we mistake not, are new to most of us.

The method by which the young are fed by their parents
is a case in point, and one which should be of especial interest
to aviculturists, since it is by a knowledge of such details that
success in breeding captive birds may be more easily attained.
The care with which a Heron erected a gorse screen to shelter
her from the camera, the readiness with which young Purple
Herons find their way back to their own nest, the failure of old
or young Herons to recognize their own young. These and many
similar notes bring the birds to our minds as living and reasoning
beings, and, apart from fostering a love and appreciation of birds
in general, should give the book a permanent value to the more
scientific ornithologist. Like Oliver Twist, we should like more,
and hope that sufficient encouragement will be given to this work
to justif)^ Mr. Beetham in giving us the Home Life of some other
families.
A NATURALIST IN AUSTRALIA. *
Readers of the Avicultural Magazine will already have read
many of these notes, which are a reprint of the articles with
which the author has already favoured us. Mr. Seth-Smith has,
however, added many other notes of considerable interest on the
mammals which he came across, as well as several plates w&amp;apos;hicli
did not appear in the Magazine. The book gives a very vivid
and pleasing description of the commoner birds and mammals to
be met with, and those that catch the newcomer's eye on a first
visit. The fascination of being for the first time in a country
where the whole fauna is strange, and of seeing birds that have
previously only been known in captivity, in their native haunts,
is not given to all of us. In the perusal of this book, however,
we are able to realise even in a faint degree the pleasure of such
an experience, and to comprehend a little of the spirit which has
driven so many to explore and collect in distant lands.

This is the fifth (interim) annual Report of the Migration
Committee and is drawn lip on a similar plan to the previously
published volumes. Careful notes on the weather each da} 7 with
the species migrating are given in parallel columns. The
arrival of our commoner summer migrants is recorded by a map,
a short account of the different waves and a detailed chronologi-
cal table of the observations sent in. The rarer spring migrants
and the autumn movements are dwelt with in long chronological
tables which, in the case of some of the commoner species,
runs to six or more closely printed pages. It is somewhat
ungracious to criticize a task which has been carried out as a
labour of love by keen ornithologists and which has to be spread
with unflagging zeal over a considerable number of years before
any real or tangible results can be attained, yet we can but feel
that this report, which contains no less than 347 pages, would
have gained in interest and usefulness had a more sufficient
record and digest of the observations been published rather than
the complete list of observations.
The fullness of the records are however ample testimony
to the painstaking and hard work of the Committee and form of
themselves a most valuable addition to Migration literature.
We understand that an appeal is being made for further funds
in order to carry on this investigation. We need not emphasize
the usefulness of this work, which is also being carried on in
other countries. Germany has a well-endowed ornithological
station, in Hungary the ornithological bureau is a government
department, in England pure science has to be carried on from
scientific enthusiasm by those who are busily engaged in other
professions.
This Committee does not want money for nothing, it only
asks those interested to buy the Report for 6/- and we can
confidently ask our readers to do so, not only will they receive
good value for their money but also know that they are helping

so much.
THE WEATHER*
This is a small pamphlet dealing in a very concise and
popular manner with weather instruments and how to use them.
Although hitherto very little work has been done in observing
the behaviour of animals in correlation with the climatic con-
ditions to which they are exposed, we are convinced that a wide
field of experimental study might be carried on on these lines.
For instance we had at the beginning of this season no less
than ten litters of rodents (of 3 species) born within four days.
The animals had been paired two months previously and had
been kept out of doors and all fed on similar food ; the only
variable element was the climate and had a careful note of the
temperature and humidity been kept we should probably have
had some clue to work on.
Aviculturists, therefore, who can afford the time might
well take up weather observing in relation to the behaviour of
their captives.

Sir, --The Field of Oct. 1st contains an able and moderate statement
by Mr. F. C. Selous on the need that England should join the international
combination to protect Quail, if these are to be saved from extermination.
Many such appeals to our supposed national love of fair play have been
made in the past, but England remains the chief marplot to the scheme
which most other countries have long ago put in force, namely, to jointly
respect the breeding season of these little migrant game birds, which, in-
cidentally, are highly useful to agriculture.
I write to suggest that we aviculturists, who love birds well enough
to include them among our penates, should set an example, and make a
beginning to check, at least during the spring and summer, the present
abuse of Quail, with its attendant cruelty aud enormous waste.

Sir,-- I regret that in the introductory remarks in my Notes on this
subject (supra p. 34) I have inadvertently&amp;apos; omitted to refer to Dr. A. G.
Butler's important paper, in which he gives a long list of the ages of birds
kept by himself (Avicult. Mag., I. 1910, p. 181), and which, in fact, was the
first devoted to this enquiry. A. Gunther.
THE SULPHURY SEEDEATER.
Sir, --Since reading Mr. Davies' letter in the November number of
the Magazine, I have had an opportunity of inspecting the series of skins
of this Seedeater in the Natural History Museum and I have come to the
conclusion that the female mentioned in my notes is, as Mr. Davies suggests,
a female 6\ albignlaiis, though a somewhat abnormal specimen.
I will not review the evidence which I relied on further than to say&amp;apos;
that it included three odd coincidences : one, that I compared this bird care-
fully&amp;apos; with a skin, in a private collection, labelled S. sulpliuratus ? ; two,
that it was imported with, paired with and had identical call-notes with a
male Sulphury', and, three, that the member from whom I obtained the
other female had a similar experience.
I will, therefore, only&amp;apos; say that I am exceedingly sorry for the error
and that I beg to tender a sincere apology both to the Society and to Dr.
Butler. I have already&amp;apos; written privately&amp;apos; to the latter and am glad to know
that I have been forgiven. I may add that I have always found Dr. Butler's
descriptions of plumage and other data most accurate and they have been
of the greatest possible assistance to me. Had the description of the
female of N. sulphuratus to which I referred been original, I should not have
doubted its accuracy for a single moment, but Dr. Butler expressly tells us
that he has not (or had not at that time) ever possessed a female of this
species.
I must also thank Mr. Davies for his kind assistance in clearing the
matter up. I am not sorry to have this opportunity of withdrawing (by

them, that the occurrence was not really worth describing. When the
young only qualify for the Society's medal by the narrow margin of one

The London Cage-bird Association held their 22nd Annual
Cage-bird Show, at the Royal Horticultural Hall, Westminster,
from November the 25th to 28th.
As this is written just as the Magazine is going to press,
and only a small space therein is available, it will only be possible
to mention here, the more important of the exhibits, and I shall
not attempt to criticise the judging.
The foreign birds made an extremely fine show, amongst
them being some of great rarity, and a good many that had
never before been seen on the show-bench.
Perhaps the most startling exhibit of the show was the
trio of Blue Budgerigars shown in the first of the Foreign
classes. In one's early days of bird-keeping one heard of a Blue
Budgerigar, but for my own part I never expected that I should
ever see one, and probably the majority of us regarded it as a
myth. However here were no less than three specimens, barred
across the back like ordinary Budgerigars, but the green of the
common bird was replaced by sky-blue, and the yellow of the
face had given place to white. In short the yellow in the bird's
coloration had been entirely eliminated, leaving the blue pigment
perfectly pure. These most interesting birds were shown by Mr.
Pauwels, who had sent them, with many other rare birds from
his aviaries in Belgium.
I11 the class for the larger Parrakeets and Lories, Mr.
Pauwels showed a good Uvsean Parrakeet, a nice pair of Red-
naped Lorikeets, a Black-capped Lory and a pair of Blue-winged
Grass Parrakeets. Mr. C. T. Maxwell, a rare Mitchell's Lorikeet,

a poor specimen of the Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet, and a good
pair of Brown's Parrakeets.
In the rarer Waxbill class, a beautiful pair of Red-faced or
Melba Finches were conspicuous.
Amongst the Grassfinches and Weavers, Mr. Maxwell's
Red-rumped Weaver ( Dinemellia ditiemelli ) was quite the most
interesting and rare exhibit ; the same gentleman's Painted
Finches, and Miss M. Bousfield's Tri-coloured Parrot-finches
being also noteworthy.
Mrs. Leslie Miller's Rainbow Bunting ( Cyanospiza leclan-
cheti ) was quite the finest thing in the class for "Grosbeaks, true
Finches and Buntings," it is a wonderfully beautiful bird.
The Tanagers made a fine class that must have been
difficult to judge ; very rare and beautiful specimens had to be
content with mere commendation cards. The rarest bird in the
class was certainly Mr. Maxwell's " Black-throated Chatterer."
Mrs. Leslie Miller showed a remarkably good pair of Festive
Tanagers; four exhibitors showed specimens of the Rufous-
throated Tanager ; Mr. A Sutcliffe sent two very rare birds in his
Yellow - bellied, and his Desmaresti's, or Chestnut - headed
Tanager, while Mr. Maxwell's splendid trio, a Black-backed, a
Blue and Black, and a Black-throated, made up a grand lot of
this gaily-dressed family.
Amongst the Sugar-birds and their allies, Mr. Maxwell
certainly had the rarest bird, in his Purple Sunbird. It was out
of colour, and without careful comparison it would not be easy
to identify the species, but a Sunbird of any species is a unique
cage-bird. There were no less than four " Banana Quits"
(Certhiola ), three apparently belonging to the Jamaica form (C
flaveola) and one being apparently C. luteola. They are pretty
and very rare as cage-birds. Two of them belonged to Mr.
Sutcliffe, one to Mr. Maxwell, and one to Mr. Townsend. Mr.
Maxwell had also a fine pair of Black-headed (( C.hlo?ophanes
spiza), a Yellow-winged, and a splendid Purple Sugar-bird. A
Yellow-winged Sugar-bird belonging to Mr. Townsend was
absolutely perfect, and perhaps the most brilliant gem in the
Show, while this exhibitor's rare Jerdon's Green Bulbul was well
worth notice.

The last class but one was reserved for all species not com-
prised elsewhere, smaller than a King Bird of Paradise. Here
Mr. Maxwell's Great-billed Flycatcher and Mr. Ezra' Temminck's
Robin ( Erithacus komadoti) were great rarieties, the latter being
a very striking exhibit.
The last class, for the larger birds not provided for else-
where, contained what to the general public certainly proved the
most attractive bird in the Show, namely a Greater Bird of
Paradise, beautifully shown by Mr. Patiwels. It was a fine
specimen in full plumage, and probably the first of its species to
be seen on the show-bench, although of course the species is well
known from the specimens in the Zoological Gardens.
A second Paradise Bird was Mr. Maxwell's Violet Manu-
code, though this attracted little attention. The latter exhibitor's
Crested Wood-Partridge ( Rollulus roulrojil) and Cuban Trogon
were also noteworthy, as were also Mr. Pauwel's Cuban Wood-
pecker, and Spot-billed Toucauette.
PRACTICAL BIRD KEEPING.
A NEW DEPARTURE.
The Editor.
We have much pleasure in announcing that, thanks to the
co-operation of some of our leading members, we hope to start a
new departure in the January number of this Magazine.
It has been felt for some time by a good many of our
readers that the interest of those members, who are as yet
amateurs in the art of bird-keeping, were not given sufficient
consideration, and also that practical advice and information
on the every-day management of birds might, with advantage to
all our members, play a more important part in the Magazine.
We have, of late, been so fortunate in securing articles of
such high value that the Avicultural Magazine now receives
recognition amongst Scientific Journals, and this is a position
which no efforts will be spared to maintain.
There is no question but that aviculture, if conducted
properly, can be, and is, of enormous importance as an aid to

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998530921052631" page_id="9404046"  page_num="78" year="" vol="">
scientific knowledge. Scientists are realising more and more
that, if research work on certain problems is to be carried out
with any degree of thoroughness, the study of living things
must play a very important part in their investigations. The
living things most ordinarily used for study are, of course, plants
and insects, these being the easiest to keep and work at, but
there are many important problems which require other material,
both for original and corroborative work, and it is here that birds
and bird-keeping can play such an important part.
In a minor degree, the very study of the art of how to
keep different species alive and healthy is of distinct value, as
this information will save many a disappointment and much loss
of valuable time and money to the scientist who decides to keep
birds for scientific ends ; but there is much more open to the
keeper of birds, even if his scientific knowledge is negative or
scanty. He can at least make accurate notes on the lives of his
birds, on their moult, their breeding habits, date and length of
incubation, mode of feeding young, length of life, etc., not to
mention the hundred and one little habits peculiar to both
species and individuals.
These notes may seem to be of little value by themselves,
but if they are all recorded in a common journal they then
become of untold service to the academic scientists who find in
them corroboration or otherwise of some natural law.
It is strange that the term " scientific " should prove so
alarming to the ordinary lay mind, and not only alarming, but,
in some instances, undesirable. I am sometimes amused at the
zest with which some members, who forward me copy, hasten to
say " Not in the least scientific." They are often right, but, at
the same time, why should they not be scientific? In this case,
what does it amount to ? Simply to accurate records of accurate
facts, if possible with some understanding on the part of the
writer of what these facts point to. But this latter is not
essential, though, when there, it is apt to make the whole
difference to the interest and business of bird-keeping; when
there to any extent, and when added to it there is a certain
amount of scientific knowledge, then you get your scientific
aviculturist--a man or woman greatly to be envied of all men,

for in their pursuit they have a source of unending fascination
and absorbing interest.
This is neither the time or place in which to go into the
natural problems, the elucidation of which are so absorbing.
I merely wish to point out how we can make scientific use of the
results of our experience as aviculturalists if w T e so desire, and
any records with this object in view will always be most gladly
welcomed by the Editor.
We also intend to keep our columns open for all possible
notes and observations of birds in their wild state, this with the
primary object of assisting our members the better to keep birds
in captivity by a knowledge of their natural habits, and secondly,
of thereby adding to ornithological knowledge generally.
On the other hand, we most certainly do not wish to ignore
or under-rate what was one of the primary objects in the founding
of the Avicultural Society, i.e. mutual help and advice from all its
members on the keeping and breeding of birds. We wish the
Magazine to be a permanent record of all experiences of interest
and value gained by our members, and we also wish it to be a
Journal through which advice and information can be freely
obtained from our more experienced aviculturalists by those mem-
bers who are as yet unskilled in the difficult art of bird-keeping.
Those amongst us, who have kept birds for years, do not always
realise the hundred and one little difficulties which beset the be-
ginner, and are apt to forget that all the little "tricks" and " tips"
which are now to us a matter of course, can only be learned by
our fellow-members through sad and heart-breaking experiences,
unless we make use of the pages of the Journal to lay before
them in detail the results we have attained. To this end, there-
fore, it has been decided to set apart a certain portion of the
Magazine each month, where, under the headin g of Practical Bird
Keepmg , matters relating to the absolute business of the keeping
of birds will be dealt with. We are arranging to have one article
each month by experienced authorities on the subject, in which the
best methods of keeping the commoner species will be discussed.
This, we hope, will be of infinite assistance to the member with
but a few birds to care for, as well as of interest and value to the
more experienced aviculturalist.

Dr. A. G. Butler--whose writings are so well-known and
whose knowledge is so exceptional--has kindly consented to
write the first of these articles, when he will deal with Foreign
Finches, and those of our members who have already enjoyed
his wise advice and benefited by his practical knowledge, will
realise how much we are to be congratulated in securing his
co-operation.
Under the heading of Practical Bird Keeping we shall also
open a column for Correspondence, and hope our members will
take every advantage of it, not only to ask any questions which
they want answered, but to criticise and add to any points of
agreement or disagreement in the previous articles ; to send in
their own experience on some moot question, and to raise any
problem which may present itself.
In addition to these two features, we hope to persuade our
members to combine to provide matter for a third, where, under
the heading of "Notes" they will send in periodically and with-
out a personal request, notes relating to their own birds and
aviaries. Most, if not all our members, must have a few such
notes which they could contribute, not enough perhaps to form
an article in themselves, but sufficiently interesting to be worth
recording. It is more difficult than members perhaps realise,
for the Editor to know which, ont of the four hundred members
of the Society, are in a position to send in such information, and
it would be of very great assistance to the whole Society if such
members would voluntarily and without waiting for a personal
suggestion contribute the result of their own experiences.
The first number of the Magazine containing this new
development will appear in January, 1911. The Editor will be
glad to receive any correspondence, notes, or suggestions for
publication in this number up to December 16th, 1910.

By Mrs. Gregory.
For the last eight years I have kept Pheasants--Gold,
Silver, Amherst, Swinhoe, and Reeves! It is of the latter
species I have most to say. Called the " long tail " on account
of its length, this appendage in my bird measures exactly four
feet (that is to say, the longest of its feathers does), and it is
most difficult to keep in good order. When rain conies the
feathers look draggled and shabby, and soon break off. The
bird twists and turns as he walks, and, not having the arch in
the tail that the Amherst has, the hard gravel wears it all away.
So to preserve his tail I determined to let him go free. These
Reeves have the habit of suddenly flying up when they are
frightened, and often injure or kill themselves against the wire.
I lost my last one from this cause. In the morning his run was
brushed out by a new man, who left a broom standing up against
the door. The bird rushed down and saw it, dashed up to the
roof, struck his head--and fell dead ! They are certainly less
intelligent and more timid than either Gold or Silver Pheasants.
I determined to gain the confidence of my bird inside the aviary
before I risked letting him out. So I gave him a few monkey
nuts, now and then, as a treat, and when he got tame enough to
come and take them from my hand I caught him as gently as I
could (they hate a net and are very nervous when held), cut the
feathers of one wing, and waited till next day for him to recover.
Then I opened the door and let him loose in the garden. At
first he kept out of sight under shrubs and bushes, but now I
have the pleasure of seeing him on the lawn close to the house,

in company with three Golden cocks, two Silver hens, and three
Amhersts, one of which I have had over seven years.
All my pheasants have their names, and most know them,
and will come running up when I call, and take bread from my
hand. When I am taming a new one I never look at its eyes
until it has lost all fear of me and does not mind my doing so.
I had one Gold cock that would fly up and take mealworms off
my shoulder ! The Pheasants are not afraid of the Cranes, and
it is a pretty sight to see them all together. The ' Demoiselles'
step on the long tails and, being very light, fly over the Pheasants'
heads when they all try to rush for the same piece of bread
thrown--generally the pheasant gets it!
In the spring I cannot have them all loose, they would
fight and kill each other. Each bird has to be separated by wire
divisions in the run until the moulting time begins. I learnt this
after I had two or three of my favourites "done to death."
For rearing young pheasants much space is required.
They are difficult to bring up unless the pheasant hen hatches them
out and looks after them herself. One of my Silver hens is an
excellent mother. Each spring she makes her nest in the garden
under the shelter of a large Pampas on the lawn. The day after
the chicks are hatched out, she takes them off to a more secluded
part and does not bring them back to the aviaries until they are
six or seven weeks old. I hardly trouble to put food (as they get
all they require in the garden); only once a day some fine bread-
crumbs and hard-boiled egg, which the Sparrows get most of.
But I always have a load of manure put down, and on it they will
scratch about for hours at a time finding insects and tiny red
worms. This last spring my Amherst hen made a nest inside the
wire run and hatched out five young ones I did not know that
the cock bird should at once be taken away, and he killed two
of them and pecked the others so that they had to be destroyed.
But if they had lived, I do not think I could have brought them
up, as the hen was not tame enough to let loose. Before dusk I
call all my pheasants up and drive them into their respective runs,
except the two Silver hens, who roost in the topmost boughs of
an old apple-tree.

liave had a very dear and interesting Jay, which was given to me
for a home. He had been kept in a cage, in a hot kitchen, and
naturally was in poor condition. I gradually got him used to
his new and spacious quarters, giving him his old cage inside
the run at first, but I do not think, after he had the courage to
once hop out, he ever entered it again. Jays are very active
birds, and ought to have a large place to fly in. I cut a large
round hole in the side of the wire, and 'Jack' soon learnt to fly
into the adjoining run. Here the boughs of an old Arbutus tree
made excellent perches, and he delighted to fly from one aviary
to the other, being equally friendly with the inmates of both. I
fed my Jay on ' Cecto,' mixed fresh daily with hard-boiled egg
and biscuit, and moistened with boiling water; also acorns, fruit
and plenty of insects, but I never gave him any meat at all. He
grew a fine big bird with perfect plumage, and has never ailed a
day. He would look up to my window and call for me the first
thing in the morning, for my aviaries are all within sight of my
windows, which I have found an excellent plan. Having the
inmates constantly in sight has saved many a life from fights or
bullying birds, or greedy ones who will not let others eat. I do
not think birds can be looked at too often by their owners.
My Jay became so very tame that I got into the habit of
leaving the door open when I went in or out. This I did once
too often, and a fortnight ago he flew out, right into my arms. I
put him back, but unfortunately went away. When I came back
he was out again and flying among the trees, calling to me
continually. Gradually he got further and further away, and I
saw him no more. Being told a few days afterwards that he had
been seen in a wood, where there are a few oak trees and many
firs, not far away, I went there and called 'Jack.' He flew to-
wards me at once, calling loudly in answer to his name. But I
fear I shall not get him back now that he has tasted liberty!
My only hope is that when the hard frosts come, food becoming
scarce, and the acorns no more, he will return to the care of his
mistress, and to the society of his old friends the Pheasants.

UGANDA.
By L. M. Seth-Smith.
I have been asked to write a few notes on the birds met
with in Uganda, and so intend jotting down a few facts which
have, from time to time, come under my notice, and which may
possibly interest onr members. I do not pretend that the obser-
vations are being noted now for the first time, but I think that
corroboration of other observers has its uses.
One sees it stated sometimes that Sunbirds do not hover,
and, although this statement has been contradicted by others, I
would like to repeat that they do fiequently hover for a second
or two whilst catching minute insects on the wing, and some-
times at flowers.
Whether dates of nesting are of any scientific value or not
I cannot say, as some bird or another seems to be nesting at
almost all seasons; however, I will jot down dates of a few as I
come to them.
The Kilimanjaro Bronze Sunbird (Ncciarhiia kilimensis )
was seen building near Kampala on the 17th of September,
1905; the nest was almost oveihanging the roadway, and was
right at the end of, and hanging from, a long branch, about ten
feet from the ground. It was of oval shape with a hole in the
side and lined with thistle-down or something similar.
When in Toro, some years later, I saw a nest very much
like it, but much smaller, and, on reaching it, I found there was
no entrance to it at all, and could not understand it, until I broke
it open to find that it was not a bird's nest, but a nest of cocoons
of some moth (species of Bombyx ).
I11 early January the grass becomes sufficiently dry to
burn well and, at this period, one sees fires all over the country,
which the natives light so as to get good succulent grass as
soon as the first shower conies on. As soon as a grass fire is
started birds immediately congregate. Swallows and Kites are
most numerous and, at times, they appear to almost dash through
the flames to catch some insect prize driven out by the smoke,
and while the charred remains of grass are still hot, birds come

down poking about among the ashes for dainty morsels. O11
January 2nd, 1906, I particularly noticed the Blue-headed Wagtail
(.Motacilla flava) in numbers, where a fire had an hour or so
before been raging; these birds were evidently on migration.
Another sure attraction is a white ants' nest at the time the
ants are flying. They always commence their flight about sun-
set, and are the signal for all kinds of insectivorous birds to
congregate ; Swallows fly backwards and forwards, Drongos and
Flycatchers of several species choose points of vantage from
which to swoop out and back again, a Shrike flies out, catches
an insect and, probably, continues its flight to another bush near
by, while higher up Hobbies take their toll ; but now it is getting
dusk, and Nightjars come to join the feast, and so on, until it is
too dark to see, and one has to get back to camp.
One of the prettiest sights in bird-life is the courting of
the Pintailed Whydali {Vidua principalis&amp;apos;). While in the mood
he is most energetic, and as soon as he sees one of his many
wives he flies towards her and hovers within a foot or so of her
with rapidly moving wings, the only movement of the body being
a slight up and down motion, the long flowing tail lagging a bit
behind each movement, at the same time he is trilling out his
love song. After a while she appears to get bored by his be-
haviour and flies off, at which he begins over again before another
wife ; she soon flies off and he, getting tired, flutters away with
an undulating flight singing all the while, to rest on a branch
or grass near by.
It is quite amusing to watch a colony of Weaver Birds
{ Hyphantor?iis abyssinicus&amp;apos;) building; the noise is almost un-
bearable when close by. The cock bird does most of the build-
ing, flying off perhaps two hundred yards to fetch grass. Why
he goes so far I cannot say, as there always seems to be plenty of
good grass much nearer, and time appears to be a very important
matter with him. He pecks off a piece of green grass, some six
or eight inches long, and flies back to the nest with it streaming
behind him, and immediately begins weaving it in, all the while
clinging on to the nest, sometimes in very uncomfortable positions,
and flapping his wings rapidly while almost bursting with his
chattering song. The hen meanwhile squats in the nest directing

Mr. L. M. Seth-Smith,
operations, sometimes giving a hand at the weaving, but she
never, I think, deigns to fetcli the grass. At times, when a
builder has gone off to fetch more grass a neighbour will make a
dart at the nest, seize a piece of grass and carry it off for his own
use. But they live very happily on the whole, and are always
welcome, preferring to remain near human habitations. The
Black Weaver Bird ( Melanopterys nigerrima) frequently occupies
the same tree as its commoner relative (//. abyssinicus).
On April io, 1905 ,1 found at Entebbe a nest of the Paradise
Flycatcher ( Terpsiphone cristata). It was placed about 25 feet
from the ground on an almost bare, small branch. The nest was
very small and cup-shaped, not unlike a Chaffinch's, the outside
being composed of lichen and moss, woven together with spiders'
webs, the inside being lined with fibre about the thickness of
horse hair. It contained two partially-incubated eggs, which
were large for the size of the nest, and I should think this
number, or possibly three, probably represents the full clutch-
We get several British birds in the migrating season, but
my notes of these are very meagre.
On the 29th of February, 1908, I saw a lot of our English
Swallows ( Hirundo rustica ), among them being some immature
birds with dull brown crowns and the throat only just beginning
to get a tinge of rufous, and without the long tail-feathers. While
on the subject of Swallows, I should like to mention a nest I
found at Nimule on the 19th of February, 1906, of that beautiful
large Brown Swallow ( Hirundo senegalensis). It was placed under
an overhanging ledge attached to a river sand-bank, and was
composed of mud outside and lined first with goats' hair, above
which was a soft lining of feathers. Unlike our Swallow's nests,
it was bottle-shaped, with the neck pointing outwards and curved
downwards, not unlike a Weaver-bird's nest, but made of mud
instead of grass. There were two fully-fledged young in the
nest.
Cuckoos also appear in their season, but I cannot say
whether their note is the well-known call which is so popular in
England, although I have been told by a good observer that he
had heard on one occasion a number of Cuckoos calling with a
note exactly similar to that of Cuculus canorus ; other Cuckoos

have been mistaken. The only dates I have of having identified
this bird are the 2nd of April, 1908, and the 10th of April, 1909,.
at Mubende and Kampala respectively.
The Willow Wren (. Phylloscopus trochilus ), again, is not an
uncommon bird in the migrating season, although the only times
I have been certain of its identification have been at Entebbe on
the 3rd of April, 1905, at Butiaba on the 17th March, 1907, and at
Mubende on the 20th of March, 1908.
I have not often been in a locality where Bee-eaters nest,
but have a record of finding a colony of that lovely red-breasted
species (Melittophagus frenatus) hard at work at Nimule on the
17th of February, 1906. The holes--some 60 in number--were
in the sandbanks of a stream, and some were not more than six
inches from the top of the bank ; they averaged about three feet
in length, and there was no lining of any sort to the nest cavity,
which was strewn with wings and indigestible parts of beetles.
In each of the two nests, which I was able to examine, I found
three young birds, varying so much in size that I came to the
conclusion that the bird must commence sitting on the first egg
she laid, like Parrakeets. A few days later, at Gondokoro, in
March, 1906, there was a colony of the brilliant pink Bee-eater
(Merops nubicus ) nesting.
Colies, or Mouse-birds, among the most attractive birds
to a stranger, not on account of their plumage which is very dull,
but their curious flight is at once noticeable, as they fly from
bush to bush, usually in small companies, one after another at
short intervals, a few beats of the wing being followed by a long
aeroplaning scoop, looking like miniature pheasants with their
long tails streaming behind. When disturbed they fly from a
bush with a great fluster. They are great fruit-eaters, and can
always be found when pawpaws and guavas are ripe. O11 the
1st of May, 1905, at Entebbe, I found a nest of Shelley's Coly
(&amp;apos;Colins affinis&amp;apos;) in the middle of a thick clump of low bushes,
about four or five feet from the ground. The nest was composed
of a few small twigs outside with a thick lining of fine grass and
fibrous roots. Two young and a bad egg were found in the nest.
Honey guides are not uncommon throughout the protectorate

Mr. L. M. Seth-Smith,
and one frequently hears them calling, sometimes becoming very
persistent in their endeavours to attract attention. I have tried
to follow them, but have never yet found a bees'-nest through
their means. On one occasion, my men were cutting a line
through forest when they came to a tree with a strong bees'-nest
in it; after some hesitation and many stings (I personally kept
in the background) grass and leaves were brought up, a smoky
fire lighted below and the tree was cut down by some spirits
more plucky than the majority. The next day, when passing the
spot, I saw a good many bees going in and out, but the hole had
been enlarged and the honey extracted, and probably the bees
were more infuriated than ever. While watching, to my great
surprise, a Honey Guide ( Indicator variegatus) flew out of the
hole. It had been right in among the angry bees, and one would
think not a welcome intruder. I can only surmise that its skin,
which is almost as tough as leather, is able to withstand the bees'
stings, though how it protects its eyes and more vulnerable parts
I cannot say.
The nest of the Hammer-headed Stork ( Scopus umbretta)
is well-known to most of our readers, either from books or from
the nest, out of which a young bird was (last season) reared in
the Zoological Gardens. I have only once come across this nest
in Uganda, placed in the fork of a tree some thirty feet from the
ground. The nest had been taken possession of by a pair of
Kestrels ( Cerchneis cirdesiacus&amp;apos;) which had a fine brood of three
young ones in March of this year. One of these young birds
found its way later to the Zoological Gardens, being the first of
its species received there, but, unfortunately, it did not survive
more than a few weeks.
The stately Crested Crane (Balcaiica pavonina) is common
in parts of Uganda, and is to be seen round about most of the
Government stations. It makes a lovely pet, and quite an orna-
ment to one's garden. I brought one up from quite a chick when
last in Uganda, and it used to go about with my chickens. Later
on, when full grown, it still stayed about and, although others of
its species were frequently close at hand, it never seemed to have
any inclination to join them, but every night slept on the roof
of my bungalow, sometimes, on a brilliant moonlight night,

taking a midnight flight, where to I cannot say, returning with a
clatter on the iron roof a few minutes later. Although, as I
pointed out above, au ornament to one's garden, he was a bad
gardener, treading down my choicest flowers as he stamped about
to drive out any insects which might be taking refuge among the
foliage. These birds nest in swamps, beating down the long
grass and making a platform of it just clear of the water. On
the 6th of October, 1906, I found a nest in just such a position at
Masindi, containing two large eggs of a dirty greenish-white
blotched all over with brown. The water in the swamp was not
more than six inches deep.
Marabou Storks make nice pets when they become tame.
I cannot call them handsome, but they are certainly entertaining.
One I had was a wonderful catch, and if a piece of meat was
thrown to him in any direction, and as hard as possible, as long
as it was within his reach he would catch it nine times out
of ten. One favourite game he had was to pick up a piece of
stick or rag and throw it up in the air, dancing round it with
outstretched wings and catching it again. When in the mood
he would play like this for a long time. Although he was near
my house all day long he would always fly off in the evening and
roost on the highest tree he could find about lialf-a-mile away.
One day he never returned and, probably, went off with a
mate.
On January 2nd, 1905, I was walking through some long
grass at Entebbe when my boy, who was following me, noticed a
nest on the ground : it was oval in shape, composed of grass with
a hole in the side, and was built right on the ground among
the grass stems. I waited to see the bird return, and before
long was able to identify it as Heuglin's Pale Waxbill (Estrilda
paludicola). I should have thought the ground would have been
the worst possible site for a nest as snakes must be their worst
enemies.
While walking through a thicket at Masindi 011 December
27th, 1905, I heard a young bird chirping but could see no signs
of it until I traced the sound to what looked like a bunch of
dried grass which had been caught amongst some hanging
creepers. The ' bunch' turned out to be a nest of Emin's Bush

Warbler (. Eminia lepida ), though I did not discover this until I
had waited for some three hours to catch sight of the parent
birds, which remained in a dense bush only a few yards away
calling repeatedly to each other. The nest was a very untidy
structure, composed of grass and lined with thistle-down and
was only partially domed. There was only one young bird in
the nest and it was of similar plumage to the adults.
One of the finest songsters I have come across in the
Uganda protectorate is (Cichladusa guttata), a bird very similar
to, only smaller than, a Thrush to the casual observer, but only
a distant relation according to the systematist. A nest of this
species was found at Gondokoro on April 21st, 1906, in a thick
clump of bush about four feet from the ground. It was com-
posed of mud outside and lined with grass, and contained two
nearly-fledged young similar in plumage to the adults.
The Yellow-billed Kite (Milvus aegyptius) is a very common
bird and a useful scavenger throughout Uganda, albeit a terror
for young chickens. A nest of this species was observed on the
13th of February, 1906, at Nimule, in the fork of a tree some 25
feet from the ground. It contained two eggs of a yellowish-white
colour, thickly blotched with red-brown.
Now I ask, are dates of the nesting of birds in the tropics
of any value ? I happen to have looked up one of the birds
mentioned above, viz., Eminia lepida , and see that Mr. Woosman,
during his expedition to Ruwenzori, found this bird nesting at
the beginning of May, and again at the end of July, both nests
containing young birds, while I find it on Dec. 27th, also with
young in the nest. I am inclined to think they nest whenever
they are ready. The same difficulty is seen in trees, some species
at least of which have no proper seasons, for you may see two
trees of the same species, side by side, one just budding and the
other just shedding its leaves.

(Concluded from page 67).
The nesting seasons of this species in this country seem
much the same as those of many foreign finches. This year,
they nested in the spring, then moulted, then nested again. They
go to nest freely and sit well, both birds assisting; and it is not
quite clear why there has been so little success ; I cau only sug-
gest that the weather has been too cold for them. The nests
here have been large substantial domed structures of hay and
lined with feathers.
The first nest to which I need refer was built in a box some
7--8 feet from the ground, and was so concealed by trees that I
have little to say about it. It was occupied for some two months,
but nothing came of it. Now, in mid-October, a female is again
sitting in this box.
While this was going on my second pair, who would not
settle down in the general aviary, was admitted and, before long,
had built a nest in a dead Thuja borealis , just about two feet from
the ground. On August 30, moved by a strong impulse in a
moment of weakness, I examined the nest, and found that it
contained two or three eggs (I thought three, but may have been
mistaken) and one nestling quite recently hatched. About this
time it was very wet and cold. On September n, I again
examined the nest and found two eggs and one backward nest-
ling, backward that is if it was the same I had seen before; but
it is not impossible that the first had died and that this one had
been hatched later. In either case I feel satisfied that the very
cold weather had much to do with the general unsatisfactory
state of Painted-Finch affairs.
Towards the end of August a third pair--an old female
and a new male--had been loosed into the aviary; and on this
second visit I found that these two birds had also built in the
dead thuja, a little above and actually touching the first nest.
One point of etiquette had been observed, however; the aperture

Mr. R. Philupps,
to the new nest faced in a different direction, so that the occupiers
would not come into collision when approaching or departing
from their respective habitations.
The first of these two nests looked towards the aviary
door, and from time to time I would turn the binocular upon it.
When the male was in the nest, his red face was conspicuous, but
when it was the female that was at home I had to approach
nearer and had difficulty in making her out, for the sexual
difference in plumage between the two birds was marked.
On the 2ist, the nest looked dilapidated and deserted, so
again I approached it, and found that the roof had been torn to
rags, although the solid and substantial structure itself was
practically uninjured ; whether the wreck had been caused by the
rather high winds of the two preceding days or by a big battle I
do not know, but on the following day I found a female that had
been injured. The inside of the nest, viewed from above, seemed
very large, and was not too scrupulously clean. Quite lost in the
cavity was a little brown figure, braced tightly up, aud crouching
in just the same manner as the young Blue-breasted Waxbills I
wrote about last year (p. 346). It was quite fully feathered. It
had left the nest by the following morning, when I noticed it
squatting with its parents on a sunny bank.
Not a day passed but I hunted up the fledgeling with my
binocular. It was quite at home on the wing, and seemed well,
but it felt the cold terribly ; it worshipped the sun, and followed
its rays about from place to place--when there were any to follow.
Early in October it disappeared, and I did not immediately find
the body--I did not want to disturb the second nest in the thuja,
aud a Quail-Finch was sitting close by; however, on the 7th, I
extended my search to the tree, and found the body just below
the nest in which it had been hatched. The feathers on the
under parts and about the head were ruined ; but from my notes
taken before its death, supplemented by what I could make out
from the remnants of the plumage, I may give the following as
a tentative description of the fledgeling Painted Finch :--
General aspect above brown, tinged with what in the dis-
tance had seemed to be chocolate, but which had appeared pink
when seen in the nest and now also on the dead body; the

shades were darker about the crown, lighter about the cheeks,
and inclined to red about the centre of the back. Upper tail-
coverts (and lower back ?) brown-black boldly tipped with bright
scarlet; tail above brown-black, each feather strongly but
irregularly stained--almost veined--with red about the centre
but not extending to the edges ; under surface of tail dull black.
Wings above brown, with some of the coverts washed with pink ;
under aspect of half-open wing light, with entire centre pale pink ;
this latter effect (not observable in an adult female I examined)
was produced by the inner webs of the primaries and secondaries
being in part pink ; in the centre of the wing this colour extend-
ed upwards and downwards nearly but not quite to the tip and
base of the feather, but became more and more restricted, up-
wards and downwards, on each feather as either extremity of the
wing was approached, the first two or three primaries and the
innermost secondaries being scarcely touched. The breast, when
viewed during life, had what looked like an ill-defined smudge of
sooty black right down the centre ; after death this seemed to be
more definitely black, and in the centre were a very few black
feathers unmistakably if but slightly tipped with bright red.
No spots were visible : daily, on some days two or three times, I
looked for the spots which are so conspicuous on the adults but
failed to detect them ; none could be traced on the dead body,
but this was but negative evidence, the plumage being in such a
bad condition. The rather thick but comparatively short beak
was black, with a sharply cut dirty-white patch on each side of
the lower mandible towards the base; feet and claws darkish but
not black : eyes, no trace-- but probably dark as they could not
be seen during life, and in the nest they had not attracted
attention.
I take it that this fledgeling was a male, and think it pro-
bable that the patch at the base of the lower mandible ( Adult
male " . . . . under mandible scarlet, with a triangular patch of
livid blue at the base." Br. Phis. Cat. XIII., p. 296), and possibly
also the scarlet tipped feathers on the breast, may be sexual
distinctions which are observable at an early age.

Supplementary. --An adult female I have examined since
writing the foregoing had, in addition to the narrow eyebrow, a
broader line of scarlet below, running forward and expanding
into the scarlet lores. The under parts, including the under
aspect of the tail, were rich black, with the spots for the female as
given in the B. M. Catalogue ; but, with the exception of quite a
few scarlet-tipped feathers in the centre of the breast, there was
not a trace of red anywhere, differing materially from the males in
this respect. The upper aspect of the tail-feathers was rather
brown-black than black; and the red markings weie confined to
a faint edging of the outer webs--thus differing curiously from
the fledgeling. This bird, although a female, had a small tri-
angular patch of white or whitish at the base of the lower
mandible, a mark not mentioned in books. It seemed to be
smaller, of a different shape, and more black underneath than in
the fledgeling ; doubtless I am mistaken--but I especially noted
that I could not make out the patch on the latter to be triangular
as I considered it ought to be.
The bill of the fledgeling was not long and slender as in
the adult. What useful put pose in the economy of the species
does the very long bill serve? That the Painted Finches should
prefer spray millet to any other food I am able to offer does not
help us much ; but I think the way in which, like the Regent
Bird, they pluck off and swallow the tops of blades of growing
grass is unusual among finches. Probably the wild birds have a
partiality for some particular food. The parents here fed the
young bird--as far as they went--on such small insects as they
were able to obtain.
The eggs, so far as I know them, are small for the size of
the bird ; I compared one with a Cuba Finch's, and found the
latter to be almost the larger; they are, of course, white.
The alarm-call is a rapid running repetition of the cuck
note.

Rats in hordes and field mice have invaded the sea-board
all this year. From everywhere the same lamentation. Dozens
were trapped and scores poisoned on these premises, bnt exclude
them from the aviaries we could not. Hence I found, on return-
ing in October, that most of my small fowl lived only in memory,
and even such as large as a Redwing, Blue Thrush, an historic
Song Thrush, a pair of perfect Rock Thrushes, a Greater Spotted
Woodpecker and a Water Rail had succumbed to the foul rodent,
and the survivors had been caged indoors. Some veiled notice
to be prepared for grief had come in the gardener's letters. The
Italian has not the English domestic's exultant pessimism, he
tells you what he thinks will please; so that Giacomo's written
assurance that tutto va diseretamente bene" implied a boding
reservation.
By chance I brought out a stronger than usual contingent
of Northern birds from England. And these are always my
favourites. They help to bend the exile to his fate in this
country where inveterate persecution makes it difficult to observe
any feathered creature. The breath of grey skies and subdued
harmonies these homely birds bring, is grateful and inspiriting
in the sun-tyranny of the South ; and a chamber knowledge of
our wild creatures complements our outdoor knowledge of them,
and helps complete it.
Although Italy yields a wider supply than England, the
rarer sorts are not easier to come by alive. The native birds
are kept (and very badly kept) mostly by the poorer people for
use as decoys. As cagelings, Rock Thrush and Blue Thrush are
fully appreciated, but they must be hand-reared to thrive and
become tame. Both command a relatively high price, from
twelve to twenty lire, whereas I have secured a Bluethroat for
eight and a Chough with cage for ten.
My last Nightingale recently hopped his final twig, but
long he so ruled me that one summer I took him with me 011

January to mid-May, we had no sooner reached Aix for a stay of
some weeks, than he allowed himself to be swept into enthusiastic
rivalry with a wild Nightingale in the hotel garden. Probably,
the latter was deep in domestic affairs, and Phil's voice sounded
that of an interloper. Anyway, the two trilled at each other day
and night without stopping, until Phil drooped wings and eyelids
with fatigue. I drooped too. But, though out-classed, he refused
to be out-sung. One tio tio tio tix from the garden revived him
to torrents of melody. The hotel visitors also grew heavy with
watching, and complained of the loud songs before sunrise,
though they knew not the cause. I tried to evade my respon-
sibilities by quartering him at night in bath rooms and unin-
habited places. I tried smothering his cage with rugs, engulf-
ing him in cupboards, and whacking it with a stick each time
he sought to utter. At length, after a night of strife, one dawn
I grew desperate and, taking him from his cage, I tied him
up in a handkerchief. That interrupted his song but not my
vigil, for the Furies took the place of Melpomene, and remorse
racked me worse than Phil. Finally, a padded cell, the telephone
box, brought relief to all. I have heard of captive Nightingales
in the same room singing each other, or themselves, to death.
Except for the nimiety of his fire in spring, Phil was one
of the pleasantest companions Fate has vouchsafed me. My
parlour stood open to his roaming, but he was always glad to
return to his cage, and roosted there--or in someone else's. He
took interest in all that went on, and if left too long unnoticed,
came to see why. Unlike most feathered boarders, he enjoyed
visitors, and would hospitably hop on to them, even if they wore
big hats. And his friendliness did not wane as it so often does
with the tamest birds whilst the sap was rising in the trees,
(especially a Wryneck and a Chough, which knew not fear but
became distant and wilful in spring). If he was not always, as
M. Rostand describes " un son qui berce," I have forgiven him
his vibrating poems, and now strongly feel that " 11 faut, dans la
foret, toujours un rossignol."

and Nightingale in syllables which hold good to this day. We

centuries ago. Yet a bird's song, one might think, would be
easy and apt to change compared with the type of the bird.
What an earnest that gives of the aeons that went to the
development of the species.
My last Bluethroat escaped after eight months of mutual
good understanding. His buzzing song, which has caused the
unknowing to look about for a bee in difficulties, was the least
of his merits. Other Warblers board with me: Whitethroat,
Sedge Warbler and Willow Wren (an all the year singer) and all
are engaging and intelligent. But the Blackcap, perhaps the
finest songster of them all, lacks the grace and port of the others.
Two Hedge Accentors, most inobtrusive of all Passerines, I also
boast; one hailing from the Zoological Gardens, where he was
continually being caught in a duck trap, and liberated, until one
day I carried him off in a paper bag.
A poor flier in the open, there is no quicker or more active
dodger than A. modularis, and if anyone doubts it, let him try
and take a caged one in his hand. Its retiring ways are in
contrast to the Robin's pompous self-importance and its neatness
and cheery song render it a pleasant room fellow. In an aviary
it keeps out of sight. For a slenderbill it is singularly fond of
oats and seeds. The Chats are too Warbler-like to have escaped
my attention ; the Stonecliat does not draw me, but the Wheatear
is very stylish, and still more so are the S. European Black-eared
variety and the Desert Chat. How many persons are familiar
with the song of the Common Wheatear, or even of the Spotted
Flycatcher (A/usciccpa grisola ) which nests against our very
houses ?
Olives are much liked of all the Thrushes. A Ring Ouzel
and Song Thrush from England took to them at sight, and Rock
Thrushes seem to reserve a special squeak for the hammering of
them. We have been told a good deal lately about the latter,
Monlicola saxatilis --by the way, why " pied" ? it is no more pied
than a Water Ouzel or a Wheatear, not so much so as a Martin--
and it needs close observation to appreciate its pronounced varia-
tions of colour and markings, according to season and age. The
hens vary less and some sing fairly well. I have only two Rock
Thrushes now : one, an old confidential friend, who accompanied

me into Inverness-shire three years ago, where he misliked the
hyperborean conditions. He invariably ducked at the many
Gulls (A. ridibundus) that sailed close past the windows, and
felt the July cold so much that he sat on the fender, and uplifted
each wing in turn towards the fire, to warm his flanks. His
present autumn splendour baffles all description, for, on the fore
body, each light feather has a darker tip, and each dark feather a
lighter rim, and many have two crescent bars of differing shades.
The Italian name Codirossone (Rig Redstart) is good descrip-
tion of its general appearance and quivering tail-plav. One of the
German names, Steinrotel, endorses this. They are charming
chamber birds, wayward, and a trifle tempersome, like all the
Thrushes, and sing the year round. When feeling comfortable
and well, they let their feathers hang very loose until they swell
into round balls of puff. My old stager always snatches tit bits
with a scold, and bolts them quite angrily, but only from those
persons he knows. He keeps his pecks for them, too, so possibly
they are a sign of affection. Last year he somehow cut two toes
whilst at large in my room. They would have healed, had he
allowed them, but he was so enraged by the pain and weakened
grip that he was continually pecking at them, until they came
off. One of my hens was fearlessness embodied, and allowed
herself to be picked up anywheie, but she eventually became so
crippled from what seemed a rheumatic affection of the legs,
that I had her killed ; and rats ate an irreplaceable pair, which
I had turned into an aviary in hopes of increase. At Stresa, last
spring, I repeatedly observed a pair hunting earthworms, which
they carried off a long way, to the boulders on a steep hillside.
Here they are not rare in the mountains in summer, but we have
none by the coast.
The Blue Rock-Thrush {Monticola saxaiilis ) is pretty com-
mon, and I have seen its nest in old walls. A beautiful hen of
mine nested in an aviary and laid four Starling-like eggs, but
did not sit. Her mate, my war-thrush, has tyrannized this house-
hold for five years, and is a known character hereabouts for the
murderous onslaughts he makes on every human male who
enters into his aviary or room. His conduct is uniformly con-
sistent. Civil to me as the governor, the first sound of any

other man's voice starts him off on a loud and very musical war-
chant, kept up whilst the intrusion lasts. As soon as the intruder
is within reach, he flies headlong upon him and belabours him;
but he never molests women and, if several are present, he even
refrains from fleshing his bill until they have left. He evidently
thinks it bad taste to brawl before ladies, but he makes up time
when they are gone. He takes pride in making hay on my
writing-table, scattering pens and small things wide around ;
and makes a point of breaking up cigarettes, in this respects
emulating an African Grey Parrot, which has borne with me
for twenty-three years. The smell of tobacco seems to attract
both. Solitary Thrush is a fitting name, and it is not hard to
believe that any other bird trespassing on this one's sphere of
action would have a poor time. I have never seen this species
bathe. It is more insectivorous than most of the thrushes, and
rarely eats fruit or olives.
Meadow and Tree Pipits I am never without ; pleasant
fellows both, with their soft song, enquiring expression and
contented, busy ways. They are great ventriloquists, especially
the former, and combine the run of a Wagtail with the waddle
of a Lark. Grey Wagtails are common in winter. A Pied Wag-
tail with a shot-broken wing, was being led about on a string by
some children and brought to me, and on the fourth day took
mealworms from the hand. It lived some years in an outdoor
aviary until killed by rats. Larks, too, I cannot withstand--Sky,
Wood, Short-toed and Calandra. The former are errant here in
winter. The Calandra, a loud singer, is less robust than its size
suggests, and likes soft foods, despite his heavy bill. They are
all somewhat shy and with other birds generally peaceable, but
an old Skylark killed a Button Quail. A tame Skylark, big-
eyed and puffy-cheeked, is as great an acquisition as a good
steady Linnet. If only the hand-reared birds were good singers,
or the good singers more steady. Serin Finches (F. serimis&amp;apos;)
are common in Central Europe, and migrate here in autumn;
stupid little birds in captivity--their high-pitched song suggests
a convivial bat. Redpolls we never see here, and none of those
I have brought have survived a summer* No one knows the

Lesser Redpoll until lie lias heard the sundown concert of a flood
of them in a wintry larch plantation.
Citril Finches (F. citrinella ) have appeared this autumn
for the first time in eight years, and I find them pleasing in the
bird-room ; tame as Siskins, rather like tiny Greenfinches, but
with a Linnet-like softness of expression and a deep call-note for
so small a bird. We are strong in Sparrows, with House, Cisal-
pine. Tree and Rock. The two former are much the commonest,
and have become through persecution so wary that they always
keep in little groups, and are seldom shot or snared. At a
distance the Cisalpine is not easy to distinguish from the House-
Sparrow. The Tree-Sparrow is not seldom caught with Siskins
and Mountain Finches, and is more vagrant than the House-
Sparrow, for the latter never roams with other birds here. The
Rock-Sparrow (P. petronia&amp;apos;) occurs during its winter wanderings.
Its pale plumage recalls the ground birds, and the curious
sulphur-coloured ace of diamonds on its breast is, at times, quite
hidden. Hawfinches, Chaffinches and Mountain Finches are
more plentiful in winter, and the latter materially help to fill
the coat-pockets of the local sportsmen.
The S. European Buntings are many in kinds, but one in
character, and nearly all I have kept were dull, fiuttersome and
stupid. Meadow and Cirl Buntings are common ; in an aviary
they will flap for years against the same window-pane, when a
tew feet off there is exit to the outer world. One Ortolan I had
became tame and had a pleasant little song. In point of intelli-
gence I should place the whole family at the bottom of the
Passerines. Nor is the Golden Oriole more commendable--hard
to please in the matter of food, and most time a spell-bound
dreamer, with feet singularly small for so large a fowl. I have a
young male now, in immature green and grey, rather like a
Grey Woodpecker, that scorns even mealworms. Figs and bread
pulped with boiled milk suits it better than mixed insect food.
Tits, of course, are indispensable. There is nothing stupid
about them, indeed the Great Tit has almost corvine perceptions.
The Crested Tit I found rather less restless than its congeners.
The seeds of the stone pine, Pignoli, are much liked by the whole
group, and Robins and Rock-Thrushes bolt them whole like pills.

Bird Notes from the Zoological Gardens. ioi
Lately a pair of Bearded Reedlings have come to me in silkiest
feather. They have a foreign look, and the incessant chirp and
cuddling, leap-frog ways of some of the small African finches.
Their black legs and straw irides, and the cock's blue head and
black moustache and vent are in striking contrast with their
general hue. They make my Coal and Blue Tits look shabby little
ragamuffins. Coal Tits bathe until too wet to reach their perch,
but the Reedlings splutter whilst the water lasts. My Greater
Spotted Woodpecker spent a year in an all-wire cage chipping
pieces of wood lent him for the purpose. He gave a bell-like
monosyllablic cry. Afterwards, in an aviary with some Thrushes,
he had a big olive tree to shuffle round, and made the most of
his opportunities to hammer its hard surface for some years, and
added a loud squall to his previous note. He came to hand for
mealworms rather timidly, but, once there, remained and con-
sumed the tit-bit, instead of snatching it and hurrying off, which
was nice-mannered. He had a very painful bill, when handled,
which made his death by rats the more surprising. The Water-
Rail referred to strode about an aviary manifestly contented with
any soft food and a liberal supply of fresh water. He was always
in perfect feather during his two years with me, and flicked
his tail and flapped about in the bushes very like a Moorhen.
His reddish bill was noticeably translucent in strong sunlight.
Identical in habits, with him are a pair of African Bine Coots;
except that the male shed nearly all his flight-feathers* in one
night last May, and that he never fails to give a loud squeak if a
fire-arm is discharged near him.

tively few. Our Waterfowl collection has been enriched by the
acquisition of a male Orinoco Goose ( Chenalopex jubatus ), making
a pair with the one we already possess. These beautiful South
American Geese are closely allied to the Egyptian Goose, but,
at the present time, are extremely rare in Europe. They are not
hardy, and have to be kept from frost. The present specimen
is from Mr. Blaauw&amp;apos;s unrivalled collection of Waterfowl. Two
females of the American Wigeon ( Mareca americana ) and a Scaup
{.Fuligula marila) have also been acquired.
The Black-footed Penguins in the Sea-lion enclosure
appear to nest at almost any time of year, but so far as my
experience of them goes, they rarely hatch successfully during
the summer months, but do so during our winter. We have
now two fine young birds in one nest, and one in another nest
(mentioned last month), and a third is being built by another
pair. The parents of the above-mentioned twins are also the
parents of a young bird hatched about this time last year, and,
in addition to feeding the present family, the cock bird still feeds
the young bird of last year.
A fine pair of North American Wild Turkeys have been
presented by Sir Edmund Eoder, and a fine specimen of the
Pileated Parrakeet received by exchange.
Three specimens of the Bearded Long-tailed Partridge
(.Dcndrorlyx barbatus ), and six Montezuma Quails ( Cyrtonyx
montezumez) from Mexico have been acquired.

By Dr. A. G. Butler.
The Editor has suggested that I should contribute a paper
upon this subject for the benefit of beginners in aviculture, and
although I do not profess to know more about these birds than
many others of our members, the fact that I am the author of
''Foreign Finches in Captivity" probably induced him to select
me for the task.
Finches are not my favourite birds, although they are
tolerably easy to provide for; they are neither so easily tamed as
a general rule, so intelligent, or so long-lived as so-called "Soft-
billed birds " still they are very beautiful and many of them are
easy to breed in captivity. They are all seed-eaters, but most of
them eat a certain amount of living insect-food, especially when
breeding; many of them feed also upon the green seeds of
grasses, buds, small fruits and berries, and the leaves of weeds,
but especially chickweed and groundsel.
The Finches, as is well known, belong to two large
families -- Fringillidce and Ploceidcc ; the former having the
bastard-primary shorter than its coverts, the latter with it lon-
ger. The Fringillidce are related to the Larks and in a lesser
degree to the New World Starlings. The Ploceidce in my opinion
form a link between the true finches ( Fringillidce ) and the New
World Starling (Jcteridce).
The most insectivorous of the finches amongst the Frin-
gillidce, are the Buntings, some of the Grosbeaks, the Chaffinch
group and the various forms of Sparrows; the Weavers and
Whydahs amongst the Ploceidce; but during the winter months

all these birds thrive without insect-food With these general
remarks respecting food we may for the present leave that subject
and pass on to the housing of finches.
Undoubtedly, like most other birds, these also do best
when kept in spacious aviaries having both an indoor and out-
door compartment; the indoor portion should be fitted up with
natural branches the walls being partly decorated with nesting
receptacles of various kinds--old straw-hats with a round hole
near the edge of the crown and tacked to the wall through the
rim so as to leave the hole at the highest point, cigar nest-boxes,
converted travelling Hartz-cages, ordinary square Canary nest-
boxes, wicker-cages with the door removed, large Weaver-birds'
nests, or any other appliance suitable for finches to build in.
If delicate birds are kept, this inner compartment should
be provided with hot-water pipes and sliding panels to shut it off
from the outer flight during the winter months, the birds being
all driven inside in the autumn and allowed egress again only
with the coming of warm weather ; but it is better for beginners
not to attempt to keep any but hardy birds, passing on to the
more tender species when they have gained experience. If the
outer compartment or flight is sufficiently large, it is better for it
to be as wild and natural as possible, bushes, trees and creepers
being grown all over it with the exception of a central more or
less winding path for the convenience of the owner. In such an
aviary many finches will nest in the shrubbery without difficulty
and often without the owner's knowledge provided that soft food
containing egg, dried ants' cocoons, etc., with chickweed, are
supplied daily, the parents finding sufficient small insects, cater-
pillars and spiders amongst the grass and bushes around them.
I have found it far more difficult to breed finches in cages
than in aviaries, although some aviculturists have had the opposite
experience; but there are a few common species which can
generally be depended upon to reproduce their kind under either
condition, such as the Saffron-finch, Java Sparrow, Ribbon-finch,
Zebra-finch, Bengalee and Sharp-tailed finch ; the Grey and
Green Singing-finches will also build and hatch their young in
cages and have been known to rear them : I see no reason why
all the Serins should not be bred in cages although I have not

myself been successful with them. Our British Goldfinch will
breed both in cage and aviary ; I have myself bred it in the
latter enclosure and have bred mules between it and a Canary in
a large cage.
This brings me to another point with regard to the indoor
culture of finches and indeed of all birds in close confinement;
none of them should be permanently kept in cages which are
too small for them to use their wings as freely as their legs, or to
indulge in a bath whenever they are inclined to do so. Nothing
is more conducive to the health of a bird than plenty of natural
exercise, and cleanliness combined with fresh air.
The small stuffy cages formerly in use with seed and water
hung outside and no exercise beyond a monotonous pendulum-
like hop from upper to lower perch were most injurious to the
health of their inmates, and more especially when their cages were
hung up in a close gas-heated room and were not frequently
cleaned out. I have found a cage about three feet long, eighteen
inches high and eighteen inches from front to back, open only in
front and with a central sliding door, none too large for a pair of
small finches, if one has any wish to breed from them. There
should be a metal tray sliding in from the front, a nest box in the
centre upon the back wall close to the roof of the cage, a perch
from front to back high up near each end and a pan of water on
one side of the door, a pan of seed on the other. When breed-
ing a small pan of soft food should be added and green food
stuck through the wires near one of the perches. Hygienic
fountains are cleaner than open pans, but the birds cannot wash
in them and if both are supplied the birds, like human babies,
will always drink from their bath.
Some aviculturists have been successful in breeding the
commoner Waxbills in cages, but with me they never attempted
to build excepting iti a good-sized aviary and even then I never
succeeded in getting them to hatch their eggs. The same is true
of most of the Mannikins, though they are more ready to build
and sit than the Waxbills but are so nervous that with the least
alarm they spring up from the nest, kicking their eggs right and
left in their excitement.
According to the late Dr. Karl Russ the Waxbills require
living ants' cocoons when feeding their young, but in a large

well-grown shrubby outdoor aviary I suspect they get a sufficient
quantity of tiny insects to meet the requirements of their progeny.
The Cardinals will build in an indoor aviary and also lay,
though they do not always do so in the nests they have constructed,
but often smash their eggs by dropping them from a branch on
to the floor ; in an outdoor aviary, however, they succeed far
better, only they require abundant living insect food from the
day that the young break the shell until about a fortnight after
they leave the nest, and the quantity which each youngster eats
in a day is generally so considerable that the supply fails and the
young are thrown out of the nest, perhaps one alone being
retained by its parents.
Finches always feed their young at first from the crop,
but the more insectivorous kinds begin to feed with crushed or
broken up insects when the young are only a few days old,
though even then they sometimes give them the food in a partly
digested condition : the young thus get triturated seeds, green
food and insects combined in a moist and easily assimulated
form: some of the larger finches also give broken-up earth-
worms, a repulsive looking article of food which I have seen the
Pine Grosbeak devour greedily.
I must now say a few words respecting the seeds which I
have found most suitable for the commoner kinds of finches.
For the more typical Buntings, Chaffinches and Sparrows a mix-
ture of Canary, white millet, German rape, hemp, oats and per-
haps a pinch of linseed occasionally serves admirably ; but for
the Cardinals I have found canary, oats and hemp most suitable
with a little apple or other fruit when they will accept it; some-
times they will not touch fruit.
The Serins and our English Einnet with its allies do well
upon canary, white millet and a little German rape or, when
moulting, a pinch of hemp: they all delight in green food, for
which the Buntings as a rule do not care much ; they are also,
perhaps, the least insectivorous of the true finches, though the}&amp;apos;
will accept small green caterpillars or green fly : Goldfinches and
Siskins, but especially the latter are eager for this kind of food
and need a more liberal seed-diet; thistle, teazle, and hemp, with
an occasional pinch of maw-seed being much appreciated by them.

Practical Bird Keeping. -- I. The Culture of Finches. 107
The Grosbeaks, witli a few exceptions, care little for green
food, but the larger forms require a generous seed-diet; sun-
flower, beech-mast, hemp, millet, canary and German rape
forming a good general mixture ; berries are also eaten by some
of them ; but the smaller forms, of which the White-throated
finch may be considered typical, do well upon white millet and a
little canary seed. Waxbills, in addition to the last-mentioned
seeds like spray-millet and grass-seed in the ear, both in the
milky and ripe stage. The Grass-finches should be treated like
Waxbills although some of them never touch green food and
merely nse the grass-stems with their seed-panicles to build
with. The Mannikins also with the exception of the Java
Sparrow which likes oats or paddy rice in addition to millet and
canary, should be similarly treated.
The Weavers and Whydahs eat oats and hemp as well as
millet and canary and, as previously stated they are eager for
insects, their larvae, and spiders. The Long-tailed Whydah will
eat cockroaches at any time as also will the Grenadier and
other large Weavers. I have never seen one of these birds
eating green food.
For nesting materials hay is the principal thing, to which
may be added feathers, fir-needles, cow-hair, coarse cocoa-fibre,
and moss with white wadding; but many of the finches use hay
alone in the construction of their nests. Do not forget to supply
nesting birds with abundance of cuttle-bone, crushed up egg-
shells or old mortar, to lessen the chance of egg-binding; and
remember at this period to supply a pan of soft-food daily with
plenty of living insect-food when necessary.
It is better, even in the case of birds coming from the
Antipodes, not to encourage them to breed during our winter
although in a heated aviary, for the young then produced are liable
to be affected by sudden falls in the temperature characteristic
of our very depressing climate and grow up weakly when they
survive at all. My Gouldian Finches would not attempt to nest
earlier than July and I had no young earlier than September, so
that there was barely time for more than one nest in the season,
but Zebra-finches will breed all the year round if provided with
nesting-materials.

Sir, --If I may venture to comment on Mrs. Stanley Flower's article
in this month's Magazine, I would warn inexperienced bird keepers to be
very careful li&amp;apos;hat green stuff they give their birds, especially the tiny
foreigners. Many years ago, in my quite early days of keeping these small
friends, I threw a handful of green stuff on the bird room floor and the
next morning, to my sorrow, picked up the dead body of my treasured
Cordon Bleu ! I took the dead bird to a naturalist who concluded it died
of inflammation caused by eating Groundsel.
For man}&amp;apos; years I have contented myself with giving only g&amp;gt;ass when
in flower as recommended by Dr. Butler.
I found natural perches as advised by Mrs. Flower a great delight to
my birds, and always use them in my bird-room. E-E.W.

Sir, --Having kept several species of Sugar Birds the following notes
may be of interest to your readers.
In all I have had three Yellow-wings, one Green and one Purple.
The three first succumbed, at various periods, to pneumonia ; the Green
must, I think, have died from old age as the bird was in good condition.
The Purple is still with me, after a year, and the curious thing is that
he is continually in moult; not a clean moult but a good amount of small
feathers come off and green ones take their place, changing again about
three months later to the purple colour. He is kept in a wooden box cage
with wire front, this has a sliding door, which is put in at night, with per-
forated zinc air holes across the top so that he never gets a draught. His
food consists of sponge cake moistened with hot water and then squeezed
nearly dry, honey, Mellin's food and condensed milk made with boiling
water. He is very fond of fruit which consists of grapes and oranges cut open
and from which he sucks the juice. He likes mealworms but above all revels
in gentles of which he will eat any quantity. The gentles, however, are
never digested but pass through the bird's intestines and are often alive
after voiding. I have therefore stopped giving them, as food that is not
digested cannot be good. Of course Tanagers and .Sugar birds seem alike
in the way food passes through them so quickly.
The Purple Sugar Bird takes baths continually and keeps himself in
spotless condition.
Hoping these notes may be of some use.
Edith Warren Vernon.

interesting account of the breeding of Pmicola enucleator. Unless
my search through our Magazine to date has been too hurried, I
can find no instance of the successful breeding of Crossbills, and
having been requested by our Editor to contribute some notes,
I intend to deal here with an experience relating to this, enjoyed
last year by a friend of mine at Tunbridge Wells.
I11 a pigeon-house aviary were confined five examples of
Loxia curvirostra, three males and two females, in company with
Goldfinches, Greenfinches, Siskins, Redpolls, at least one Chaf-
finch, a Bramblefinch and some Reed-buntings. The enclosure,
which was boarded in top and bottom and one end, with the
exception of perches and a bundle of fir twigs pushed tightly
together up one corner, was bare and did not approach natural
surroundings in the least. Nevertheless, after a time he dis-
covered that the Crossbills were breeding, and, if my memory
serves me correctly, the young were a good size before he became
aware of the fact.
Whilst staying in Tunbridge Wells I paid a visit to Mr.
Reed and closely questioned him regarding his pets. He assured
me that the young were fed entirely from the crop, and that he
supplied the parents with seed, fir cones, and branches covered
with green aphides, which they freely devoured. The change in
the shape of the young birds' bills occurred at an early age. *
* Tlie tips of their bills overlapped almost directly 011 leaving the nest; at any rate
fourteen days after this character was fully matured.

Mr. Allen Silver,
This, however, was not the only pleasure in store, because he
informed me that for some weeks he had been allowing the birds
their entire liberty, and that they seldom stayed away long and
always returned to the aviary, or alighted on liis hands when
called down from the fir trees. One youngster stayed out all
night, but this was found "sidling" along a clothes line early
next morning, and came to call at once. To my delight he then
opened his aviary door and spread his arms, offering the birds
seed, and not only did the young speckled Crossbills come out
but the old birds and Siskins as well, and on performing the
same practice the birds alighted on the hands and arms of both
myself and another friend who was with me. After a while some
of them flew off into space, calling Yep ! Yep ! Yip ! Yip! and I
quite thought they had gone for ever. Mr. Reed said this was
nothing unusual, and that if they&amp;apos;- did not return shortly they
would before night, and, before leaving, I noticed an old red male
and several young had come back, and were busily engaged with
fir cones on a tree overhanging the pit in which the aviary stands,
and the tamest bird of the flock was the old male that had been
wild. Writing to me, Mr. Reed says he has continued the
practice every few days since, and that he has still all the birds ;
moreover, that, whilst on his holidays abroad, the aviary door was
left open by mistake and the other birds escaped, as well as the
Crossbills, and that all returned with the exception of a Redpoll,
which, probably, got lost; as these birds in winter can generally
be taught to " home" to a decoy if not frightened. The house
in which Mr. Reed lives is situated on a hill, from which one
commands a full view of the surrounding countryside, and if
these Crossbills and other birds had the option of roaming the
whole county of Kent, and in spite of it, returned to a small
pigeon-house aviary, when they could have rejoined their com-
panions and enjoyed the sweets of liberty (as our friends put it
who have never kept birds); it is a fine demonstration of the
fact that small birds are incapable of deep reflection, and that
their mental powers are not sufficiently complex to deal with the
question as to whether they were in prison or not. The owner
of these birds is fortunate in not being troubled b)&amp;apos; cats, guns, or
many children, although close at hand are houses leading to the

on the Breeding of the Crossbill.
town. In the district, earlier in the season, I saw numbers of
wild Crossbills. Mr. Reed has homed other birds successfully,
especially Siskins, but fears losing birds, principally owing to the
instinctive impulses connected with migration and the season of
love; otherwise, providing birds are not frightened and have
become accustomed to a reasonable sized enclosure, he sees no
great difficulty in getting them to return. He, however, can
never trust a Hawfinch, which is not to be wondered at, con-
sidering no British finch takes longer to understand tliata human
being in the vicinity does not necessarily mean danger.
On leaving Mr. Reed, I especially asked him to inform me
of the colour change in the males, both old and young, of these
Crossbills, which have been fed principally upon seed, and have,
with the exception of a few days now and again, been allowed
entire liberty. He replied later : " The young Crossbills have
now all moulted, most of them (the males) have assumed yellow
plumage mixed with red, but one is a beautiful carmine tint with
a few yellow feathers under the bill." This was on or about
September 13th. On October 6th, I learned that both old and
young males were pale yellow in colour, and the young carmine
cock was splashed here and there with a few old gold feathers.
The difficulties concerned with the preservation of rose
tints and pinky flushes in many birds are thus brought to mind.
At the present time I have under observation a Two-barred
Crossbill (A. bifasciata), which was caught in Mary port Docks
in 1908, and was then in a yellowish garb; in 1910 it moulted
(although kept indoors in a bird-room) a beautiful geranium pink.
In 1895, Mr. E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, writing on the Trumpeter
Bullfinch ( Erythrospiza githaginea ) in Vol. 2, O.S., speaks of a
male of this species in his possession since 1888, which was then
nearly as ricli-coloured as a wild bird, although usually the rose-
pink of the male is lost or becomes very dingy in captivity. We
know also that the geranium red of the Scarlet or Sepoy Finch
(Haematospiza sipahi) becomes orange yellow or this tone suffused
with red blotches.
Mr. St. Ouintin's male Pine Grosbeaks retain their colour,
but usually this is lost in captivity. Mr. H. Wormald, in Vol. 7,

Mr. Allen Silver,
of the Lesser Redpoll ( Acanthis rufescens) which assumed red
heads and pink breasts. Of this I have known several instances.
Last year, a correspondent writing to me through the queries of
"Canary and Cage Bird Life," informed me of a similar occurrence
with some young birds he had in his possession.
A friend in this district possesses a Redpoll, moulted in a
cage, showing a pink "flush" ; another was exhibited early last
year, and I have in my mind two other instances at least. Con-
cerning the Twite ( A. flavirostris ) I have never known the pinky
rump retained after a moult, neither have I met with a properly
cage-moulted example of the Linnet (A. cannabina&amp;apos;) showing a
red crown or a crimson-pink breast, except in one instance
that I met with last year. This bird had a large awkwardly
shaped red patch rather low down on the side of the breast. If
taken before the moult in nestling dress, before a feather has
been shed, or hand-reared, one may safely conclude they never
attain these ornaments. If caught in winter plumage, before the
colour is conspicuous, or even in the case of partly-moulted
young males of the year caught in October, their brilliant
plumage will come to the fore by the next Spring in a greater or
lesser degree, and, after the next moult, although never again a
conspicuous feature, the rusty areas on the feathers that should be
reddish are clearly discernible for some time. In cage-moulted
"caught" nestlings, hand-reared birds, and birds that have been
moulted several seasons in captivity, practically no trace of this
band of colour can be seen on turning up the breast feathers.
On the other hand, when A. cannabina is crossed with Serinus
canaria (dom. var.) the male offspring have the crown and breast
ornament (although pale in colour) distinctly visible and, when
treated with colour-food, will exhibit in the Spring this character
to a marked degree, in some specimens the areas become almost
red. A Rosy Pastor ( Sturnus roseus ) I had some years ago, directly
after the moult, had quite a nice pink tinge, and was almost free
from blemish ; this, however, did not improve as the Spring came
round, and every other example I have seen has invariably
moulted a dirty blotched creamy tint. In the cases of a Red-
backed Shrike (male) and a Lesser Whitethroat I have known
the slight suffusion of pink to occur on the breast after the

moult and to be lost the next season. Unless I am mistaken,
both the Scarlet Ibis and Flamingos lose, to an extent, the depth
of tone relating to their pinky hues ; but I can obtain no in-
formation concerning the moulting in captivity of a Roseate
Tern. The beautiful rose tints in birds of this kind have always
captivated me; but I cannot convince myself, owing to numerous
contradictions that its presence or absence entirely depends upon
food. The red crimson and rose feathers of such birds as
Weavers, Cardinals, Tanagers, Goldfinches, Gouldian Finches
lose nothing when they are properly moulted in captivity. In
the case of Pyrrhula enropcea it is true that the colouring of the
breast feathers seems less stable ; on the other hand, a discreetly
fed and naturally rich-toned bird will retain its beauty for years.
Zoonerythrin seems to be the colour pigment affecting red
feathers in birds, and I am inclined to think it exists in its most
unstable form in the case of those species that have pinky or
rosy tones in their plumage. This change, which occurs usually
after a moult, in no way disturbs the general health of the
creature, or lessens its powers of propagation, and the only
partial explanation that suggests itself to me is that these altered
conditions are not conducive to the normal distribution of pig-
ment in the course of new feather-building. Although the
superstructures may be altered but little, a disturbance is set up
in the formation of these highly unstable materials. New colour
pigments may be built up, or a natural pigment may disappear
and its place may be taken by an abnormal one. Possibly, with
such birds as the Linnet and the Scarlet Rose Finch (Carpodacus
erythrinus) a condition arises in which an abnormal amount of
Zoomelanin is formed,which, fused with the natural Zoonerythrin,
forms a brown or rusty area instead of a crimson one. I11 the
case of Crossbills, Sepoy Finches, and " brassy"-looking Redpolls
Zoonerythrin seems to disappear, and possibly Zooxanthiu is
formed, or a green compound, due perhaps to mixtures of yellow
and greyish-brown pigments. White birds, such as Snow Bunt-
ings, seem to develop a much more stable form of pigment in
captivity, and Lapland Buntings usually reach quite a ripe age
before their black becomes well developed.
Allowing for seasonal changes of plumage and wear and

the matter in more capable hands, who perhaps might be in a

alimentary canals of an apparently healthy wild and tame bird.
P.S.--Whilst sending this off the owner of the Crossbills
writes to say that four of the aviary-bred young birds seem to
have lost their instinctive tendency to migrate or roam. They
do not care to leave the trees in the garden, and when flocks of
wild Crossbills are about do not mix with them.

By J. Lewis Bonhote, M.A.
Although by no means rare in suitable localities in Scot-
land and occasionally found in England in considerable numbers,
especially after an irruption from the Continent, such as the one
that took place in the autumn of 1909, this bird has had but
little written about it in the pages of our Magazine, well-known
as it must be to many of our members.
Shortly before receiving Mr. Silver's valuable contribution
on this species, Dr. Gunther kindly sent me an old cutting from
the Inverness Courier , relating to the breeding and rearing of
Crossbills in the aviaries of a Mr. Hugh Rose. As this forms,
so far as I am aware, the first authentic instance of the success-
ful nesting of these birds in confinement, I give the extract in
full.
Hoi.mk Ross,
I7-5-S7-
Dkak Mr. Lochabkr, --You will no doubt remember my commu-
nicating to you last year the rare find of the nest of the Crossbill, which
you were good enough to mention in the Courier. I had the luck to catch
the two old parent birds in a trap cage by putting the young birds in the
decoy half of the cage, and they (the old birds) reared their young ones
(two in number) in the cage in which I put them ; and, with the exception
of one young bird, which unfortunately got out of the cage (through
eating the door away) and killed itself against the window, I now have
the two old birds and their young one, which I have taken great care of,
and have had them over a year; aud as they are extremely tame I thought
I would try an experience with them, and that was to see if they would

breed ill confinement; so I separated the voting bird (a lien) from the two
old birds and put them in a secluded room, though not entirely isolating
the last year's young bird from the old birds, as she might have pined at
such a critical period as that of the breeding season. I allowed the male
and female to remain in the same cage, though not a very large one, as it
might have unsettled them had I shifted them into a larger cage, and
placed an elder branch with a crotch on it in the cage, putting a kind of
barricade of smaller twigs to make a lodgment for the nest should they
have such a thing.
I then procured the necessaries for the making of the nest, and, as
they showed signs of nidification, I continued to do so, and fancy ! I have
now got the female sitting on four eggs, since Tuesday, April 26th, in the
cage. I think you will admit that I have achieved an unprecedented feat
in the annals of natural history this time.
The old birds are so tame that I can stand beside the cage while the
female is sitting 011 the nest, and the male will eat out of my hand and
then feed the female as she sits on the nest.
The securing the material for the nest was tolerably easy, though
rather laborious in one way, as a very great deal of stuff was required;
for instance, you might get a whole handful of different stuff, and pro-
bably the Crossbill would not take any as it did not suit her. She would
look at each shred and reject it, but I overcame these difficulties, as I
gave her any amount of material to choose from ; of course it is exactly
the reverse in their wild state, the)&amp;apos; get what they require to a nicety.
Before despatching this letter to you I thought it more desirable to wait
till I could give you the result of the eggs--whether they were barren or
not. Well, I am very glad to be able to tell you that after the female sat
twelve days two young birds were hatched. She (the old bird) began to
sit on April 26th, and the young birds were hatched on Sunday, May 8th.
A third young bird was hatched the following day May 9th. The young
birds are beginning to get their feathers and were a week old yesterday
and are thriving well.
It may be interesting for you to know the size of the cage which
they (the young birds) were bred in. The dimensions are as follows, viz. :
Length, 2 feet; breadth, 13 inches; height, 15! inches. The material
which I gave the Crossbills to make their nest with was inner decayed
bark of the lime tree, thin fibre roots, alder and larch twigs, wool, hair,
and fine grass.
I shall be very glad to hear from you on the subject, and whether

but a reference to the original record shows that, though a nest
was constructed and five eggs laid, they were never incubated.
Considering how well this species adapts itself to confinement,
and how frequently it is to be found in bird-dealers' shops, this
absence of records and notes on its habits in confinement is
rather curious.
Its habits in a cage are very parrot-like, as it is essentially
a climber, continually hanging in all manner of curious attitudes,
and pulling to pieces any branches or woodwork with which it
can come in contact.
The curious crossed-shape of the bill is a device, specially
adapted to enable it to extract the seeds from the fir cones, which
form its principal food, and, except on migration, it is usually
found in small parties in the neighbourhood of Scotch Firs.
In habits it is a wandering bird, and every now and again
large numbers visit this country from the Continent. One of
these rushes occurred in the late summer of 1909. Towards the
end of June small parties of these birds made their appearance
in the Orkneys, Shetlands and Western Hebrides, and, a few
days later, had been noticed in various places along the east coast
as far south as Hampshire. At this time they were found in
many unaccustomed situations, and had in consequence to feed
on a variety of unusual food, such as grass seeds, daisy centres,
sea pinks, and so forth. In a few weeks, however, they had
passed on and were only found in the neighbourhood of Fir trees,
where they were able to get their usual food, though in a strange
country. Here they remained and (differing from our regular
migrants) they proceeded when the season approached to breed
and rear their young; records of their nesting being furnished
from a number of English counties. Few, however, settled in
Wales or the west of the country, and Irish records were very
isolated. The last chapter of this story is still unwritten ;
gradually and almost imperceptibly their numbers are decreas-
ing, whether owing to departures at the end of last summer or
from natural enemies cannot be ascertained, but, although a few
are still with us, another year will probably see the last of them,
and we shall have to wait for another irruption before it again
becomes a common bird with us.

The study of migration is luckily being more seriously
undertaken at the present time than has hitherto been the case,
and we may hope that when the details of this irruption, which
included a large part of the Continent as well as England, have
been carefully worked out, we may be a step nearer to fathoming
the origin and cause of the migratory instinct.
The different plumages of the male, female and young are
well shown in the plate, but much yet remains to be discovered.
According to Layard, writing many years ago, the males first
assume a greenish yellow dress, and, subsequently, the better
known red livery. When working at the subject a few years back
I came, from a careful study of skins, to the same conclusion
as Layard, viz., that normally the first winter plumage is greenish
yellow, and that they frequently breed while in this plumage in
their first year. At the same time (I quote from my notes) ' there
is no doubt that they become red to a certain extent during their
first year.' Very old birds lose the red aud become golden
yellow. Unfortunately these birds always become yellow in
confinement so that we are unable to test the matter in this
direction. The female is always of a dull green, and the young
are greenish with darker stripes on the breast and back.
Great differences are shown in the thickness and depth of
the bill, those with the larger bills being known as Parrot Cross-
bills, these may quite possibly represent a distinct race, but the
matter is still a debateable one. The Scotch Crossbill has re-
cently been differentiated from the Continental birds by Dr.
Hartert, and it apparently shows certain definite minor differ-
ences ; but, in view of these irruptions occurring from time to
time, it is difficult to understand how the differences can have
arisen or remained pure, and it would have been interesting and
instructive if the matter of the cross-breeding of the races had
been investigated last year, which we fear was not done.
We trust that these notes may attract the attention of some
of our readers to this most delightful bird, and that they may be
tempted to try and fill in some of the uncertainties which still
exist in regard to its habits, plumage and movements.

Seeing Mr. Holden's interesting article in the November
number of the Avicultural Magazine, I thought that perhaps it
might be of interest to some of your readers if I also gave my
experiences on the nest of Spotted-backed Weavers (Hyphantornis
spilonotus).
This year (1910), unfortunately, I have been cpiite un-
successful in my attempts to breed them, but in 1909 I was
successful enough up to a point, though I never succeeded in
actually rearing any to maturity.
Taking my experiences of 1909 first. My birds paired off
about the end of March, but although the cock built several
unfinished nests, he invariably pulled them down again when he
had reached a certain stage in their construction. The hen during
this period (from, roughly, the end of March till the second week
in June) took no part whatever in the construction of the nests,
but merely perched on a twig beneath the cock, apparently
taking a kind of languid interest in his proceedings. At the end
of the period named, however, I noticed the hen for the first time
carrying a leaf to a nest that had a more finished and workman-
like appearance than any I have hitherto seen. The cock bird,
too, seemed even more excited than usual, and was working away
at the outside of the nest as if his very life depended on his
getting it finished as quickly as possible. I went in and had a
look at the nest, which was suspended from the wires at the
highest part of the aviary, and discovered that it was being lined
by the hen with bay leaves and feathers. She seemed, by the way,
to have a marked preference for the tail feathers of some un-
fortunate Budgerigars that were in the aviary, and had pulled the
tails out of practically all of them. However, I quickly supplied
her with some loose feathers and this saved the remainder.
The hen continued to line the nest for a day or two weav-
ing the leaves and feathers into the interior ot the nest with
extraordinary skill, while the cock confined himself strictly to
strengthening the outside, (though it was the latter that also
constructed the kind of bar stretching across the interior at the

junction between the neck and the body of the nest). She then
laid the first egg, and another on the following day, after which
she commenced to sit, and, I think, hatched out one young one on
12th or 13th day after incubation commenced. The other egg
disappeared, leaving no trace of what had become of it ; and
this, curiously enough, happened to each of subsequent clutches,
one egg invariably disappearing.
During incubation the cock used to hang practically all
day long suspended from the bottom of the nest, uttering its
terrible apology for a song and flapping its wings much after the
style of a clockwork butterfly. From time to time he would
enter the nest, but only for a few seconds, and not, as far as I
could see, with any idea of feeding the hen, but merely, I imagine,
to try and find out what was keeping her shut up for so long a
time.
On the second day, after the hatching of the young, the
cock began to get more fussy and restless, continually popping in
and out of the nest, and evidently endeavouring to persuade the
hen to desert it fora new one he had commenced to build. About
the fifth or sixth day after the hatching out of the young he must
have evidently got to the end of his patience, for, on going into
the aviary in the morning, I found every vestige of the nest had
been pulled down and the young bird w&amp;apos;as lying dead amongst the
ruins. I know now who was the real culprit, but, at the time, I
suspected another cock of the same species, who was also in the
aviary, and had him removed.
After this the cock built another nest, which was lined as
before by the hen, who laid the usual two eggs, and again hatched
out one young bird, but within a week after this the nest was
again destroyed and the young one killed. This time I sus-
pected a Glossy Hanguest to be the miscreant, for I discovered
him pulling down a few remaining remnants of the nest, and so
he also was removed.
The third time when the eggs were laid--"two again,"--
I removed one and placed it under a Canary ; a third egg was
then laid, which I also placed under the Canary. After this no
more eggs were laid, but the hen commenced to sit 011 the single

egg I had left and, I think, hatched out a young one on the 13th
day.
I was in two minds as to the advisability of removing the
cock, but finally, to my sorrow, allowed it to remain, partly
because it seemed on its best behaviour. I noticed it for the first
time taking food up to the nest, and also because I was afraid
that in trying to catch it I might disturb the lieu and cause
her to desert.
All went well till the 15th day, after the hatching of the
young when the nest was again thrown down and the partly-
fledged youngster dead on the floor. No further attempt at
breeding was made after this, and unfortunately, the cock escaped
whilst being transferred to another aviary.
Last year I hoped to achieve complete success, but, un-
happily, my hopes have been totally unrealised. About the
middle of March I removed two other Weavers of different
species that were in the aviary, and the hen soon afterwards
appeared to pair off with the remaining Spotted-backed cock.
This bird, however, has proved an absolute failure, as, although it
has started several nests, it seems quite incapable of being able to
finish one, and spends most of its time fussing round and showing
off to the hen. Whether it is too excitable or too unskilled I do
not know, but the fact remains that it seems quite incapable of
getting beyond a certain very elementary stage in the construction
of a nest.
In the end it gave up even this pretence at building, and
contented itself with smothering the whole of the top of the
aviary with bits of grass and hay woven together in lines from
one side to the other. All the eggs laid last year were of a
greeny-blue colour, very narrow and elongated, and the young
were born quite naked, without the least suggestion of down of
any kind. Incubation lasts, I think, thirteen days, but 011 this
point I am not quite sure.
I hope these notes may be of interest to some of our
members though I fear they are very much lacking in important
details.

THE BROM-VOGEL.
Bucorax cafer.
By W. L. Sclater, M.A.
During the years in which I had charge of the Museum at
Cape Town I was able to secure and keep a certain number of
birds and animals alive; though I must say that the opportunities
for getting hold of live animals were very infrequent. This
was perhaps due to the position of Cape Town, standing as it
does, in the extreme south-west corner of the Colony, and on a
peninsula separated almost completely from the main mass of
the land.
Still, from time to time, I did have live animals and birds
given to me. We had round the Museum a large open space or
compound and it was possible to house some of them on this
ground, while others I used to keep out in the suburbs in my
own garden.
Of all the birds which I had from time to time in my
possession, by far the most interesting and unusual was the
South African Ground Hornbill (Bucorax cafer). The particular
individual which I had, was given to me by Colonel Bowker, a
well-known naturalist, who was associated with my predecessor at
Cape Town--Mr. Roland Trimen--in his great work on South
African Butterflies.
I paid a visit to Col. Bowker, a short time before he died,
at his house near Durban in Natal, and there I first saw " Brom."
He was more like a pet dog than a captive bird. He lived about
the house following his master when he went for a walk, and
squatting by the side of his chair when he was at work or
reading. I was much struck with the bird, and after my return
to Cape Town, to my great delight, Col. Bowker sent him round
to me as a present.
The genus Bucorax is con fir. ed to Africa and contains two
species. One of these is found throughout western and north-
eastern Africa and is known as Bucorax abyssinic 7 is. It is
distinguished by having on its bill a considerable casque abruptly
truncated and open in front, while the great wattle of bare skin
in front of the neck is blue.

Mr. W. L. Sc later,
The South African species has much less of a casque. It
is rounded off above and gradually slopes down on to the bill
instead of being truncated and open in front. It also has the
wattle and bare skin round the eye, bright vermilion red in the
male ; while in the female, the middle portion of the wattle is
blue and the surrounding portion and skinround the eye is red.
As the whole of the plumage, except the white primaries,
is jet black, as are also the beak and legs ; and as it is as big
as a full-size Turkey, often weighing 9 or 10 lbs., it is sufficiently
striking in appearance.
Another character which gives the Brom-Vogel an almost
human touch, is a row of long black bristles along the edge of
the upper and lower eyelids.
The bird sent me by Col, Bowker was, as I have already
remarked, most thoroughly domesticated. It always preferred
company, and liked to come and squat down by one's side, resting
on the whole length of its tarsus and partially withdrawing its
head and beak between its wings. It lived chiefly in the garden
and was most useful there, spending its time searching for
worms and snails of which it was very fond. One day " Brom."
caught a large snake and this caused great excitement. He
marched up and down the lawn, dragging the snake after him
and puffing out his wattle and "broming" loudly. At last he
began to swallow it, head first, but alas ! the snake was a long
one, about four feet, and it was too much for him, but still he
marched up and down trailing half the snake behind him, till
at last out of pity for his distress, I had to cut the snake in two
and keep the tail half for another day's meal.
"Brom " was not at all particular in his diet, hew as in fact
omnivorous. In addition to what he picked up in the garden, he
was given kitchen scraps, and if a mouse or rat was caught it
was a great treat for him. He would commence at once digging
at it with his long bill until he had broken all its bones, and then
he would swallow it down. Once or twice he got into the fowl
run with disastrous results to the young chickens.
In the summer time, when we had tea out in the garden, he
always appeared as soon as tea was laid out and was fed on bread

and butter and cakes. These lie skillfully caught when thrown
to him. He would also, if no one else was by, carry off the food
from the table, as well as the spoons which he delighted to hide
away like a Jackdaw.
Unlike other Hornbills, the Brom-vogel walks and does not
hop. He can get over the ground at a good pace and I often had
a good deal of difficulty in catching him if he strayed away, as
he was sometimes apt to do. When Unshed in a wild state, they
fly, though not for very far, and I had to keep one of " Brom's"
wings cut or he would have escaped altogether. At night they
roost in trees and my bird was always anxious to do so, but I
usually shut him up in a shed for safety sake.
The call is a kind of "boom-boom" constantly repeated
until it becomes quite wearisome. Though pronounced low it
can be heard at a great distance. When "booming" the red
pouch was usually observed to be distended, but this was not
invariably the case.
I kept my bird about two years, if I remember rightly;
foolishly enough I allowed him to roost in a tree in the garden
for several nights during the rainy season, and, unfortunately, he
caught a chill and succumbed.
Our knowledge of the nesting habits of the Ground
Hornbill is still very imperfect and uncertain. Some observers
say that it builds a nest in the flat crown of a tree when the
trunk has decayed away; others say that it nests in a hole in a
tree trunk, but it would certainly have to be a very large hole.
There was an egg in the South African Museum taken
by Col. Bowker at Old Morley, a Mission Station in Tembuland,
Cape Colony. It was an elongate oval and dirty white and
measured 2 95 by rSo.
The bird is known as "Turkey Buzzard " by the English
Colonists and "Brom-Vogel" among the Dutch, and is spiead
all over the eastern half of Cape Colony, Natal and the lower
districts of the Transvaal and Rhodesia, extending as far north
as Angola, Nigeria and German East Africa. Both it and the
Abyssinian species can often be seen in the Zoological Gardens.

Coturnix coturnix.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
Most people are familiar enough with the subject of this
paper, from seeing it, either alive or dead in the poulterers' shops.
Many again, know it perhaps too well, when roasted and served
on toast!
Some years ago, at certain seasons of the year, generally in
the Spring, there might be seen in almost every large poulterer's
shop large flat boxes with canvas tops and a row of wooden
bars in front, between which appeared numerous small heads,
stretched out to obtain the millet seed and water which was
placed in long troughs attached to the front of these boxes.
Live Quails were packed in these boxes with just enough room
to enable them to move about sufficiently to get to the cage
front for food and water.
It is extraordinary that these little birds managed to exist
under such conditions, even for the short time which usually
elapsed between their capture and execution for the table, but,
unlike the majority of birds which would certainly pine and die
under similar treatment, Ouails appear to feed well and to fatten.
For some years past it has been illegal for a poulterer to
expose for sale live Quail, and, consequently, these birds are not
now seen except when dead. Nevertheless, there are probably
plenty of live Quails behind the scenes, and hardly a public
dinner is served in which these little birds do not form an item
in the menu during the time when they are in season.
Whence come these birds in such numbers? Let us look
into the life history of the Common Quail, and its presence on
the table of the gourmand will be explained.
The distribution of Common Quail is very wide. It occurs
over nearly the whole of Africa and most of Asia. In the Spring
a general northward migration takes place, the birds suddenly
appear in vast numbers along the coasts of the Mediterranean,
the majority passing on to their nesting homes in Kurope.
Occasionally considerable numbers visit Great Britain, but since
the rough land which this species loves has been broken up for

cultivation, the Quail has become less numerous as a breeding
species here than it was formerly. Nevertheless, a certain num-
ber annually visit us, and the call-note of the male, which has
been described as sounding like " wet-your-lips," may not in-
frequently be heard on quiet evenings in the Spring in our
Southern and Eastern Counties.
Of skulking habits and small size, it is easily hidden by
quite a small tuft of grass, and it is rarely seen until perhaps a
few are shot in September. But, as a rule, the majority of Quail
have commenced their southward migration before much shoot-
ing commences. It is chiefly on the northward Spring migration,
when they are travelling with all speed to their nesting-homes,
that Quails are caught in vast numbers all along the coasts of
the Mediterranean. Long nets are employed, and either the first
few live birds caught are put in small cages behind the nets to
act as decoys, or else Quail calls are used to attract the passing
birds. The Quails are caught in hundreds, hurriedly packed into
the boxes before-mentioned and despatched to the large European
towns. As many as 160,000 are said to have been captured in
one season in the island of Capri alone.
But the Quail has not only the net to fear, for both along
the coasts and on the islands of the Mediterranean every man
who possesses a gun brings it out when the Quail arrive, and
constant shooting is indulged in so long as these birds are in
evidence.
In spite of all these dangers to contend with, however, the
Quail is still a very common species, though probably not nearly
so numerous as in the days of the exodus of the Israelites.
The food of the Quail consists of the seeds of many kinds
of weeds and small insects of all sorts.
The nest consists merely of a few bits of hay or small
sticks drawn together into a hollow scratched out under some
thick tuft of grass. The clutch varies from six to ten or even
twelve, the eggs being about an inch in length, of a creamy
white colour, blotched and speckled, especially at the larger end
with umbre-brown. Incubation lasts for about twenty-one days,
the young following the mother from the nest a few hours after
hatching. The male bird appears to take no further notice of

away in search of another mate.
Two resident forms of the Common Quail occur, one, C.
coturnix capensis, in South Africa, Madagascar, the Canaries, and
the Cape Verde Islands ; and the other, C. coturnix japonicus , in
Japan and China. With both of these races the Common Quail
interbreeds whenever they meet.
There are only four other species belonging to this genus,
all of which appear to be migratory to a greater or less extent.
These are C. novce-zealandice , now said to be extinct; C. pecloralis
of Australia ; C. delegorguei of Central and South Africa; and
C. coromandelica of India.
In this Journal for November, 1906. appeared some notes
on the genus Coturnix, with a coloured plate illustrating the
heads of different forms, and some remarks on their treatment
in captivity ; and to this readers interested in the subject are

By Mrs. E. Warren Vernon.
For some time past I have kept a pair of Rheas, and have
allowed them a considerable amount of liberty, permitting them
to wander at will in an orchard of over an acre, near the house,
and to live as much as possible in unrestrained conditions. At
the same time I have succeeded in establishing personal relations
with them both, and have, therefore, been able to make close
observations of their habits, as they show no signs of fear in my
presence. The accompanying photo shows them coming through
the orchard towards me, in response to my call of "Abraham"
and "Sarah," for they know their names perfectly and invariably
answer with alacrity.
It was a great delight to me when I discovered, in the
spring of this year, that my Rheas had thoughts of breeding.
The cock bird commenced booming in the early part of the
summer, and continued doing so until June 6th, on which date
the first egg was laid.
The place chosen was in the orchard amongst the elm
suckers. A large space was scratched on the bare earth, and here

the first egg was deposited, and every other day another egg was
added to the last until nine eggs were laid. When this was
accomplished, "Sarah" seemed to have absolutely no further
interest in them. She ignored their existence entirely while
they remained eggs, but when the chicks appeared her negative
attitude changed to one of positive dislike, and she became so
spiteful and untrustworthy that I was obliged to keep her wired
off from her young ones in case of accidents.
From the first, therefore, the whole duty of incubation fell
upon " Abraham," and he sat splendidly, never leaving the nest
until the sun came full on it, when he left it for a time, always
returning, however, the moment any shadow fell upon the eggs.
It is curious that, though there was a difference of eighteen days
between the laying of the first and last eggs of the clutch, yet all
the birds were hatched out within two days of each other. In-
cubation lasted forty-two days, from the 24th of June until the
5th of August.
The photo of the young was taken when they were five
days old. They were able to run about almost at once, and were
very strong and active. They caught many flies for themselves
in the grass, but I provided them with plenty of food in the
shape of biscuit and meal ; as they grew older I gave them
crushed Spratt's biscuits, and they did remarkably well on this.
They were very intelligent and, when only a few days old,
realized that my appearance generally coincided with the appear-
ance of food, and would come running towards me the moment
they caught sight of me. I found they had a great liking for
broken bits of toast or stale bread, but they never cared for soft
food of any kind, and I have not observed any of them attempt
to eat it.
Abraham was the most devoted parent possible, and it was
difficult to realise that it was the father-bird who so magnificently
carried out the duties we usually call maternal. He brooded
them at night, and never relaxed his vigilance and care by day.
When he wished to call them to him, he did it by snapping his
beak. I saw him one day in the rain with his wings lifted up as
if they were umbrellas, and under them the young ones were
cuddled up safe and dry.

Bird Notes from the Zoological Gardens.
In spite of his devotion, however, the parting with his off-
spring did not seem to be a very bitter one, for, when I removed
them from his charge, he seemed a little perturbed for just a few
minutes and then went off contentedly with Sarah, and forgot, I
presume, all about the children he had reared with such care.
It was extraordinarily interesting to watch Abraham and
his charges, for, apart from the pleasure of observing the habits
of the young, the fact that such a reversal of ordinarily maternal
and paternal duties was taking place, added a constant interest
and amusement to the proceeding.
The young Rheas had no shelter so long as the weather
was fairly fine. When they got about a month old they were
brought into a very large yard, where there was grass growing
and hovels all round, and at night a partition of hurdles was put
up in one corner, and they were driven under with Abraham,
who soon got to know his sleeping quarters. They were turned
into the orchard by day.

There is little to record in the way of arrivals for the
past month. A Naked-throated Bell Bird, and a pair each of
Mantchurian Crossoptilons, Cabot's Tragopans, Brazilian, Blue-
winged and Versicolor Teal being the most important. A very
interesting bird, the Nacunda Goatsucker (Podager nacunda) was
received from a sailor who captured it at sea off the coast of
Brazil, and is the first of its kind to reach the gardens. It was
apparently injured on arrival but lived for nearly three weeks.
The word Nacunda , according to Azara, is the Indian
nickname for a person with a very large mouth.
This Nightjar is found throughout the whole of South
America, where it is gregarious. It is said never to perch on
trees, being an inhabitant of the open pampas.
Cereopsis Geese, hailing as they do from Australia, have a
habit of choosing our winter for nesting. Our pair which
successfully reared a young bird in 1909, are now busy in building
a nest and we hope they may be successful in rearing a brood.

<bodyText confidence="0.999551896551724" page_id="9404107"  page_num="129" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I think the following occurrence is rather unusual and so am
sending a brief account of it on to you.
Some time ago I procured some minnows and other small frogs for a
Kingfisher I had, but which unfortunately drowned itself, I fancy, through
hitting it's head on the bottom of the tank which contained the fish.
I should feel very much obliged if some member who has kept these
birds would inform me whether the tank containing the fish should be
deep or very shallow.
When the Kingfisher met its fate I had still a number of these fish
left, which I kept in a fair-sized glass aquarium in a storeroom attached to
my aviaries.
One day, whilst I was in this store room, I noticed a Sliaina which I
possess, and which often follows me into it on the lookout for titbits, sitting
on the edge of the aquarium eyeing the fish with evident interest.
I did not take much notice of him at the time, but soon afterwards
was very surprised to see him fly off to a shelf with a fish in his beak and
then proceed to quickly despatch it with a few blows on the head, after
which he devoured it piecemeal with relish. After this I supplied him with
two or three fish every morning as long as the supply lasted, sometimes in
a shallow and sometimes in a deep receptacle, and it was most interesting
to observe the extraordinary skill with which he secured the fish with equal
ease from the one or the other.
I11 the case of a shallow vessel being used, he would either chase the
fish until he came up with it, when he never failed to secure it at the first
attempt, or else he would jump boldly into the water and secure the fish as
it dashed past him. In the case of a deep vessel being used, he would sit
quite motionless at the edge until an unwary fish approached the surface,
when he was on it like a flash and seldom failed to secure it, often plunging
his head well under the water in the effort.

130 Practical Bird-Keeping. -- II. The British Warblers.
Some of the other inmates of the aviary, notably several species of
Yellow Weavers and a pair of Cuban Bine Thrushes, probably stimulated by
the example of the Shania, soon began to try their skill at the game, but
were very amateurish at the business and moreover only attempted to secure
the fish when placed in a shallow receptacle, and even then had consider-
able difficulty in effecting a capture.
In view of the above it would be interesting to know whether the
Shania ever attempts to catch fish in its wild state, as from the extraordin-
ary dexterity displayed by my own bird, I should fancy it does !

of our members who keep Sliamas will try their pets with fish, in order to
ascertain whether this habit is an individual one or common to all Sliamas.

undoubtedly the treatment of the Sylviinae in captivity presents
special difficulties of no mean order, and there is considerable
divergence of opinion as to the most suitable methods of feeding

our excellent Editor any small assistance that I was in a position
to offer, I felt that I must not fail him the very first time I was
called upon.
I shall make no excuse for endeavouring to point out the
principles involved in the various methods of treatment, which
we shall have to discuss, because I have always most fully
realized the truth and importance of our Editor's recent remark
that it is those aviculturists and those alone who take a theoretical
interest in birds that derive the maximum of enjoyment and
the minimum of disappointment from their hobby. With these
preliminary remarks I will turn at once to my subject and

I have attempted to classify the above species in the first
place according to their diet (i.e. diet additional to insects). Be
it noted that the "Fruit-eaters" will also consume berries but
the " Berry-eaters" will not, as far as my experience goes, also
consume (wall) fruit, though the Chiff-chaff and the Willow-Wren
will, in captivity, eat a little banana.
Secondly, I have endeavoured to classify them according
to the shape of their tails. There is a lot in tails--almost as
much, in fact, as in beaks. The square, or nearly square, tail
connotes a species that does not depart much from the ordinary
types of Passerine birds; it is not highly specialized; it is
generally seen perching in fairly open situations and is not re-
markably skilful in capturing insects. The slightly-rounded tail

connotes a species which generally haunts fairly thick covert,
into which it slips like magic when disturbed ; it is seldom seen
at any considerable height above the ground.
The more rounded tail connotes a species which has been
to some extent modified by environment; a species which spends
a large portion of its life in threading its way through dense
reed-beds and sedge tangles. A still more rounded tail is that
of the Grasshopper Warbler, a bird which I have watched for
hours creeping through the thickest undergrowth like a mouse.
We obtain a good idea of this type of tail if we imagine that the
undergrowth closing behind the passage of the bird has in the
course of long ages gradually worn away the tips of the outer
rectrices. (I do not say that the tail has actually been modified in
this way, though this is conceivable). This type of tail (though
carried to a greater extreme) is exemplified by the Bearded Tit,
which passes its life in slipping through the stems of the sedge
and which will perform the remarkable feat of flitting through a
reed bed without striking the reeds. This introduces us to
another use of this type of tail, namely, that of instantly altering
the line of flight by powerful leverage. Lastly, we come to the
forked tail, which connotes a bird which is constantly making
rapid darts into the air in pursuit of insects. Every one must
have noticed the little "leaf-inspectors" ( Phylloscopi ), such as
the Chiff-chaff and Willow Wren, eking out a scanty subsistence
during the cold days of early spring by catching gnats. This
type of tail, carried to a further stage of development, is found
in the Swallow-like birds.
Now, inasmuch as the more highly specialized species are
always least amenable to domestication, we should expect to find
that the Square-tailed Warblers will do better in a state of cap-
tivity than the round- or forked-tailed species, and it is, I think,
some confirmation of the above suggestions, that the order of
precedence of the species in the above list might almost be
accepted as indicating their degree of suitability for cage-life.
There are some exceptions, of course; for instance, the Great
Reed Warbler is probably a much hardier bird than the Icterine,
or Melodious, Warbler, which is not surprising seeing that it is
a much larger bird. An old marshman who, long years ago,

came across a pair in a reed-bed near Hickling in East Anglia,
described them to me as being "as big as Mavishes " (thrushes).
Mr. Galloway tells me that he considers the Chiff-chaff hardier,
easier to " meat-off" and less susceptible to cold than the Reed
and Sedge Warblers, and this is to some extent confirmed by the
fact that it occasionally winters in our Southern counties: never-
theless, the only Chiff-chaff I ever owned was an exceedingly
delicate and chilly little bird, and others have had the same
experience.
I think that I have said enough to show that, when one
receives a new Warbler, it is well worth while, with a view to
estimating its habits and requirements, to have a look at its tail--
always supposing that it possesses a tail on arrival, which is by
no means always the case.
As some of the above Warblers are not well known in this
country I have also classified them by their comparative sizes
(length in inches).
Lastly, I have added the names by which these species are
known in Germany. The common species can generally be
procured in this country, and we are so fortunate as to have in
our member Mr. Galloway an expert who can frequently assist
us in this matter; but some of the rarer Warblers are not likely
to be obtained elsewhere than in Germany. In the German bird-
market most of those mentioned in our list can be obtained with-
out any great difficulty in September and May, despite the recent
Protection Act.
Cages.
Speaking generally the Warblers are better housed in
aviaries than in cages: they require a large amount of exercise
to keep them in health and their tail-feathers are so fragile that
they are easily broken. For these reasons, the Thrushes and
the Nightingale and short-tailed species, such as the Whinchat,
make better cage-birds than the Warblers.
If, however, it is desired to cage them, the cage should be
a large one--let us say 3ft. long. It should have a canvas top to
prevent injury to the head : if birds are alarmed at night it will
be found that they always fly upwards, possibly because the
inherited experience of their race has taught them that their

nocturnal enemies are mostly four-footed. In a large cage one
usually sees a large number of perches but this appears to me to
be quite a wrong principle. We shall only require two perches
and those should be set as far apart as possible and should be
twigs of varying diameter, thus preventing any tendency to
cramp. The object of setting our perches as far apart as possible
is to compel our Warblers to fly from perch to perch (instead of
jumping) thus exercising their wing-muscles. Except in a
position where it is impossible to avoid draughts the ends (sides)
of the cage should not be of wood. With a cage of this type it
is quite easy to make a single bird take regular exercise. All
that is necessary is to lightly tap one end of the cage, thus
inducing the bird to flv to the opposite perch; then to tap the
other end of the cage, thus driving it back to its original position.
After a little practice it will be found that the bird can be made
to take really hard exercise in this way and this can be continued
until it shows signs of distress by opening its beak. Contrary to
what might be supposed this system of exercising will not make
a bird wild. I once had a Sprosser, which I used to frequently
exercise in this way, and yet it became so familiar that I
succeeded in training it to sing to command and several of my
friends can testify that it would do this even in an out-door
aviary and in the presence of strangers.
Wire netting does not look so well for cages as wiring but
it is infinitely preferable because in this way only can mice be
excluded. I think we can go so far as to say that any cage to
which mice have access, no matter what its cost or how artistic
its appearance, is a bad cage. The netting I recommend is of
three-eighths of an inch mesh and can be obtained at Gamage's
to order, but only in lengths of 50 yards.
Aviaries.
A mere glance at the names of the species in oui list will
convince 11s that one type of aviary cannot possibly suit the
requirements of all ; and, moreover, the same design would not
suit all pockets or all tastes, so in the matter of aviaries it will
be better merely to suggest what should be avoided and what
should be aimed at in designing a summer aviary for small insec-
tivorous birds.

Practical Bird Keeping. -- II. The British Warblers. *35
In the first place, we must have shelter from cold winds,
which is best secured by a palisading of tongued and grooved
boards, at least seven feet high, extending the entire length of
the aviary on the North and East sides. Our aviary, however,
must not be built against a wall, or a hedge, or under trees, any
one of which conditions will render it absolutely impossible to pre-
vent the ingress of mice, rats and weasels. My original aviaries
are in a small walled garden and, I regret to say, I followed the
conventional design and built against the walls, the inevitable
consequence being that I have been continually pestered with
vermin and I look upon these aviaries now as chiefly useful for
winter housing. My breeding aviary has now been up almost
two years ; it has been absolutely free from vermin and has given
better results in every way. The space between the palisading
and the aviary I use partly for a service passage but chiefly for
observation purposes ; I have planted it with fruit trees, which
bear well, and had a pair of Redstarts in it last year, which
flourished exceedingly and almost fed themselves on insects.
If an aviary is to be built in a walled garden, there should be a
space at least 6ft. wide between its sides and the walls of the
garden.
The South and West sides of the above-mentioned aviary
are boarded to the height of 3ft.; where the boards enter the
ground they are protected by a length of small meshed wire
netting 2ft. wide, half of which width is nailed to the skirting
and half is buried in a horizontal position under the soil.
The size of netting most suitable for a Warbler's aviary is
five-eights of an inch: if three-quarters of an inch mesh is used,
Wrens and Blue-Tits will find their way in and carry off a
quantity of live insect food.
The size and shape of a breeding aviary are, I think,
immaterial ; if it is mouse-proof, sunny, sheltered and not over-
crowded one may reasonably hope for good results, but it is
really waste of time trying to work with a mouse-ridden aviary
because any breeding results will be merely flukes.
We now come to the subject of winter aviaries and we
shall have a choice of three courses which we may briefly
describe as (1) no heat, (2) heat or (3) some heat. So far as my

experience goes all the Warblers, except the hardy little Black-
cap, and I may add the majority of the smaller insectivorous
species are-better for a little heat in the winter. Only the other
day I found a very fine Yellow Wagtail in a cold aviary in a badly
collapsed condition after a night of hard frost. It was so weak
that it was only with the greatest difficulty it could swallow a
mealworm and it would undoubtedly not have survived another
night in the open. I caught it and placed it in a heated aviary
and in two days time it had perfectly recovered.
If we decide to heat our winter aviary we still have to
consider whether our Warblers shall be confined solely in the
heated portion, or whether they shall be allowed access to the
outer flight. Some years since I determined to give the former
system a good trial and I accordingly built a small house
measuring 12ft. long by 8ft. wide by 7ft. high, the sides being
entirely of glass and the roof having two glazed lights, each 3oins.
by 24ins. of double glass with an air space between to avoid loss
of heat. One side is planted with large clumps of Bamboo and
Eucalyptus; on the other side is a large quarantine cage, a small
division for invalids and an apparatus for rearing Quails. The
foundations are of brick and are mouse-proof and the large
ventilating windows (each qfeet long) are screened with mouse-
proof netting. The pipe-area is large and the temperature
averages 65*. Last winter I quartered all my Warblers here and
the result was most promising. Every sunny morning there was
a continuous chorus of song, the Lesser Whitethroats contribu-
ting the tenor parts, the Greater Whitethroats the baritone and
the Garden Warblers, whose song closely resembles the Black-
birds', the bass. To enter this little aviary on a bleak, chilly
morning was to pass in a single moment from mid-winter to
mid-summer. All the Warblers moulted successfully and, when
I turned them out in May, they were in the pink of condition.
Then came the disappointment! The weather was cold, espec-
ially at night. The first day or so all went well. After that
there was no more singing and I saw clearly that something was
wrong : they seemed to be getting light-headed, flying aimlessly
about and striking the netting or hanging head downwards from
the roof of the aviary. I caught up two or three and replaced

them in the warm aviary where they recovered, but the rest
died. The fact was I had turned them into liot-house flowers
and at the first breath of our chilly May weather they simply
withered away.
Nevertheless, for wintering delicate foreigners and for
singing birds I find this little house invaluable and I think it
quite likely that, if these Warblers had been cooled off gradually,
they would have turned out much better.
On the whole, I think the best system for small migrants
is that which I have described as " some-heat," although this
practically means that most of my birds spend much of the day
in the heated house and roost at night in a bush in the open. I
hang up brushwood close to the roof in the house and let them
take their choice. Some roost in and some roost out: probably
every bird knows what suits its constitution best. At all events
after an extensive trial I find the system answers well.
One word as to management. One constantly sees advice
given to beginners to keep insectivorous birds in separate aviaries.
I regard this advice as quite mistaken. It seems to me that the
more soft-bills are mixed up with hard-bills and distributed
amongst the different aviaries the better : by this method we get
less fighting and whatever food supplies the aviaries afford in the
form of live insects is fully taken advantage of.
Feeding.
There is probably no subject 011 which aviculturists differ
more than that of the feeding of insectivorous birds. This alone
shows that we have not yet devised a good system of feeding,
because, if there were such a system, everyone would adopt it.
As a matter of fact I do not believe that more can be done with
insectivorous birds to-day than was done a couple of centuries
ago. In the first avicultural article I ever wrote (I think it
appeared in the Zoologist in 1SS7) I showed that the Swallow
was successfully kept in a cage through a whole winter more
than one hundred years ago, and I gave instances of the suc-
cessful domestication of the Marlin and Swift. Yet when, years
later, a Swallow appeared on the show-bench, everyone thought
it a marvel ! Until some genius introduces us to a wholesome,
nutritious insect, which can be propagated cheaply and in quati-

tities at any time of the year, the feeding of Warblers must
remain as it is at present, a compromise between a natural and
an artificial diet.
Nevertheless, the system which I shall venture to put
before you is an attempt to render the feeding, of insectivorous
birds more simple, more economical and more natural. I aim at
feeding the Warblers entirely 011 live insect food but, inasmuch
as this is not always practicable, it is absolutely necessary to
have some kind of stock-food as a stand by. The very best I
know of is Mr. Galloway's "Life" food, which, I believe, is
chiefly composed of dried flies and ant-cocoons and " gram "
(known in India as satoo or satin&amp;apos;). I use a good deal of " Life"
and I should use more if I were wealthier, but a family of some
forty Softbills is not fed for nothing. I, therefore, substitute for
general use ordinary sponge-cakes, as sold at twenty-five a shill-
ing. They are fairly nutritious, require 110 preparation, and
cannot by any possibility become stale or sour. I do not crumble
or damp them. There is alleged to be some egg in sponge-cakes,
with regard to which I can only say " credat Judceus Apella,&quot; but
at all events I do not use egg in any other form. Freshly-boiled
yolk of egg is, however, undoubtedly nutritious and we must also
accept the fact, strange as it may appear, that some aviculturists
can use even stale egg with success. For instance, our member
Mr. Tinniswood Miller recently recommended (in Bird Notes&amp;apos;) a
soft-food mixture which included "the yokes of two hard-boiled
eggs rubbed in,.made up fresh every week&quot; (my italics),
and Mr. Miller, as we all know, is most successful with his birds.
The only practicable and inexpensive form of live insect
food which I at present know of is gentles, These are somewhat
indigestible and most unpalateable ; hence our Warblers will
not eat many at a time, and we can, therefore, afford to keep
some always before them. Instead of gorging on live-food my
Warblers take a few from time to time as they feel inclined,
which is, of course, exactly what they would do in a state of
nature. I will ask you to carefully compare this system with the
conventional one of making the bulk of the food supplied arti-
ficial and giving a little live insect food as a luxury.
In the matter of obtaining gentles in the winter I think

the best course will be to give you the address of Mr. F. Fishburn,
Silsdeu, Keighley, who can supply at reasonable rates throughout
the year. I produce my own gentles in an Incubator which,
however, is exceedingly imperfect (being probably the first of
its kind) and is so difficult to manage that I cannot recommend
it.
The above system of feeding will be found adequate for all
the Warblers in our list, except the little " Fork-tails," and for
these I have found Mr. Galloway's system ("Life," crumbled
York cheese and chopped mealworms) fairly successful. It is
important to remember that all insectivorous birds should be fed
on as dry food as practicable, one advantage of which is that the
crop, which has a tendency to become slimy, is kept in good
order. I have known a Blackcap fed successfully on a perfectly
dry mixture of Quaker Oats and small seeds, and this is the more
remarkable because there is some evidence that insectivorous
birds cannot digest seeds unless crushed. I have, however, seen
a Black Redstart eating Canary seed, and on several occasions
have noticed insectivorous birds feeding their young on small
seeds, so the latter may perform some useful function even if not
fully digested.
P.S.--I have omitted to say that ripe fruit should always
form part of the diet.

and lately I found some correspondence written by you in Vol. V. with
many more details in it.

(1) Is it any use buying newly-caught Waders in the Spring?
(2) The aviary is 4S feet by 29 feet, boarded up all round to 21 inches ;
north side protected by two rows of various evergreen shrubs; west side,
privet; the same on the eastside. It is rather damp and on clay; the pond
was dug out about three feet below the general level, in order that a small
stream might run through it. The banks are very stiff clay, would that be
better sanded over?

in the Magazine. H. L. SiCH.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Sich :--
Sir, --In reply to your queries re Waders.
(1) Waders caught on the Spring migration, viz., in April, adapt
themselves quite well to confinement. If their wings have been cut, the
stumps of the feathers should be extracted, a few at a time, as soon as they
have settled down, i.e. in two or three weeks, in order that they 111a}&amp;apos; regain
the power of flight as soon as possible.
(2) The clay in the aviary should be well covered over, as otherwise it
clogs on the birds' feet. I would suggest, firstly a layer of rough gravel
and then a good layer of sand.
(3) The covered-in part is quite large enough, but as you are on a clay
and, therefore, damp soil, it would be a good plan to have part of the floor
of the shelter raised a few inches from the ground and boarded. I should
also add a few clumps of tall grass or rushes in different parts of the aviary
and keep the rest of the grass short.
(4) Your selection of birds should do very well, but I would suggest
a few more Knots to make sure of getting a pair, and you could also do
with several more Ruffs. Reeves are more difficult to procure, so get a
good stock of them if you get an opportunity.

THE ANDEAN GOOSE.
Bernicla melanopteia.
By F. E. Blaauw.
The accompanying photo is that of a pair of rare geese
which I got a few weeks ago. They are known as the Andean
Goose (Bernicla melanoplera ) and come from the Chilian Lakes in
the Andes. I had one specimen of this rare species previously
about eighteen years ago and since its death this is the first time
that I have come across the species.
The birds are about the size of the Upland Goose (Bernicla
magellanica ) but shorter in stature.
They are white all over except for the wings and wing
coverts, which are black with a beautiful metallic gloss of green
and purple. The transition from the dark colour to the white is
not abrupt but black or brownish black spots are to be seen on
the scapulars, those feathers nearest the dark portion showing
more brown than those further away as may be seen on reference
to the photo. The legs and feet are scarlet and the bill pink or
flesh-coloured with a black nail.
The sex of the birds is at present rather a puzzle to me
Both birds puff themselves up in a remarkable way lifting their
wings at the same time, they also have a peculiar little song,
during the utterance of which they are continually gazing
skywards.
At first I was inclined to believe that they were both males,
but I am now somewhat doubtful as there is a slight difference
in their voices and they are also very affectionate--preen each
others feathers and are constantly about together. Next spring
will, I hope, clear up my doubts on this subject.

THE ACCLIMATIZATION OF THE GREATER

By Sir William Ingram, Bart.
At considerable expense I have sent expeditions to the
Am Islands, New Guinea, for the purpose of collecting that
magnificent Bird of Paradise, the apoda. It was from the fear
of its becoming extinct that I endeavoured to secure a large
number of live specimens and preserve the breed by turning
them loose on the Island of Little Tobago in the West Indies,
and I purchased the island with the object of forming a sanctuary
for them.
Little Tobago is about 400 acres in extent, thickly covered
with tropical jungle and very tall trees. The climate is as nearly
as possible the same as that in the Aru Islands, and as there are
no snakes or vermin on the Island it is an ideal spot for the
experiment of creating a stock of apodas. These lovely birds
used at one time to be fairly plentiful in the Aru Islands. Some
years ago over 3000 male full-plumaged skins were imported to
Europe every year, but that number has gradually fallen off, until
at the present time little more than two or three hundred skins
are collected. Mr. Goodfellow,* who has been at the head of the
recent British Expedition to Dutch New Guinea, reports having
seen specimens of the apoda on the mainland; this may be a
variety of the Aru Island apoda . and it is certainly satisfactory
to learn that this species exists elsewhere. Mr. Stalker, the well-
known naturalist, who unfortunately lost his life while employed
011 the British Dutch New Guinea Expedition, was engaged by
me to collect my live birds. He received most valuable assist-
ance from Mr. Frost, and they were fortunate enough to send
home over fifty-six live specimens of the apoda ; some of these
were retained in England, a few died on the journey, but forty-
eight were set free on the Island of Little Tobago. O11 the
journey home from the Aru Islands, Mr. Frost was lucky enough
to come across a most intelligent Swiss sailor, who was employed

on the ship in which the birds were shipped, and who gave him
much assistance in attending to them on the voyage. This man
I engaged to remain as caretaker 011 the Island, and it is his
report on the condition of the birds that I am now sending,
thinking it may be interesting to aviculturists. With respect to
the sex of the birds no reliance can be placed on the discrimina-
tion of Herold as, from my knowledge derived from keeping
these birds in confinement for several years; it is impossible to
determine the sex until the birds are two years at least in age.
One bird I have, although to all appearance full-grown, I first of
all took to be a hen as it showed no signs of male plumage until
after the second moult, and now, after four years in my possession,
it has no side plumes visible, although under the wings there are
what might be termed small short chocolate-coloured plumes
about four inches long ; however, the bird has the head fully
marked with the yellow colouring of the male, is resplendent
with the emerald green throat, and it has also two long wires.
Perhaps these Paradise birds do not get their full adult long side
plumes until they are six or seven years old, or very likely even
older than that.
The age at which these birds begin to nest is quite un-
known, but I ought soon to learn from the reports of my care-
taker Herold ; the uncertainty, however, is whether amongst
the forty-eight birds turned out on the Island there are any
females at all. Out of the large number of specimens of the
Paradise birds of different species I have been able to import
alive into England very few have eventually proved to be hens,
although, when first imported, many of them had the sombre
plumage of the females. Nearly all the apodas that were set free
in Little Tobago had no trace of male plumage, and yet, I expect
most of them may turn out to be cock birds. Recently, Mr.
Pauwels, the Belgian aviculturist, has received from the Aru
islands a consignment of live birds, and I have obtained from
him two apodas , small chocolate birds ; these certainly look like
being females, and they will be sent out to join their compatriots
in the West Indies.

The following is Herold's report, which gives the result of
the experiment up to the present time.

Sir William Ingram,
" The apodas were set at large at the end of September,
1909, with the exception of a few weaker specimens, which were
set free later on. There were in all forty-eight birds.
At first they did not leave the place where the tents were
pitched, but kept roaming about the neighbouring trees, the
tents and their old cages. I captured them again and brought
them to a place which had been planted with pawpaw trees,
where I let them loose again. There they stopped and seemed
to get on very well, feeding on pawpaws, insects, etc., etc. About
the end of December, 1909, they took to other parts of the
Island, chiefly to those places where the biggest and highest
trees grow. At present they are all over the Island and liable to
be seen or heard anywhere.
Feeding.
At first the apodas fed as stated above, chiefly on pawpaws,
insects and bananas, brought to the place they frequented ; but
they left off feeding on pawpaws and took to the same food the
Orioles or Cornbirds feed on, viz., the berries of the wild cherry
tree, the grapes of palms, wild plums, and other wild fruit of the
trees the Island abounds with. A great part of their food also
consists of insects, and I have watched them pilfering the nests
of smaller birds, eating their eggs and young ones. I have put
water on different places of the Island for the birds to drink, and
keep the receptacles for the same constantly filled, but the apodas
seldom come there to drink now. I have watched them drink-
ing the water collected in the hollow parts of trees, big leaves,
etc. With the exception of two or three months in the year, we
have rain enough here, which enables the birds to find water for
themselves. I have planted bananas, but I do not think the
apodas will take to that fruit very well, as I have never seen any
of the birds feeding on the bananas that already grow on the
Island.
Losses.
One day. at the beginning of December last, I found two
male apodas fighting, and as they were entangled with each other
I separated them. One bird died immediately as the other one's
claws had lacerated its bowels. The remaining bird I took to
the camp, bandaged it up and kept it in confinement ; after four

on Birds of Paradise in the West Indies. 145
clays it got quite well again, so I set it free. While brushing the
woods to make roads I found the carcases of two male apodas.
They must have been dead about two or three mouths, and it is
my opinion that they were two weaker specimens which suc-
cumbed to the boisterous weather we had here at the end of last
year. Some time after the birds were set free a male apoda came
into my tent in a weak condition. I took it up, put it in a cage
and gave it food and water. As it would not eat anything I gave
it a dose of castor oil, but it died over night. I cannot say what
was the cause of its death, there were no marks to indicate that
it had been fighting. These are all the losses I know of, I do
not think there are any more. I cannot keep account of the
birds respecting their number as the Island is very large and
covered with dense forest and thick bush. There are plenty of
hawks on Tittle Tobago, and, although I am destroying them as
fast as I can, there are always fresh ones coming over from the
larger Island, Tobago ; but I do not think they annoy the apodas ,
as I have never seen any attacked by hawks yet, nor found
remains of one killed by a bird of prey. There are plenty of
wild pigeons and fowl here the hawks feed on, and I should not
like to have all the wild fowl shot, as Mr. Frost suggested at
first.
There was no water on Tittle Tobago when I arrived, only
pools collected by rain, which dried up with the exception of one
place where a little pool of water could be found in the hollow
of a rock the whole year through. I cut the side of the said
hollow rock and placed a pipe there, leading the water into a
tub. I also covered the hollow with leaves and branches. In
consequence I have running water the whole year, not much, but
sufficient for my own and the birds' wants. The water is fresh
aud wholesome.
The roads that were cut at the beginning of this year
enable me to keep good control over the Island. Nobody is
allowed to visit Tittle Tobago, and, with the exception of some
neighbouring gentlemen planters and a couple of higher Govern-
ment officials who came and stayed an hour or so, nobody has
been here. I am planting cocoa-nut trees, and, with the ex-
ception of a small patch of land which had been cultivated in

former years and where I grow a few vegetables for my own use,
the Island is kept in its virgin state.
The apodas have been growing a deal and are very strong on
the wing, healthy and lively, but very shy. There is no change
of plumage yet nor signs of mating, building nests, dancing, etc.,
etc., but at the least appearance of any change I shall report
immediately.
It is my firm belief that, if the birds are not molested in
any way and care taken to have water when need arises, they
will breed in time and prosper well. There is no fear of the
birds leaving Little Tobago, as they never take long flights, but
keep mostly hid in the foliage of the highest trees.
There is nothing else important enough to report. If I
am in need or want of anything respecting the birds or myself
Mr. H. H. Tucker, a planter on the mainland, is always kindly
disposed to help immediately in every way."
Robert Herold.
Mr. Herold has since sent monthly reports, but nothing
new or interesting, except that he has noticed some of the apodas
have begun to dance and that all the birds are in a healthy
condition.
[As a general rule the acclimatisation and importation of natural
species into parts of the world other than that to which they rightly belong
cannot be too strongly deprecated. Instances of the harmful effects of such
importations like the rabbits in Australia, Sparrows in America and Mon-
geese into Jamaica are numerous and well known. Sir Wm. Ingram's
experiment stands on quite a different footing. Little Tobago is a wild aud
uninhabited Island standing by itself in the ocean, it has no commercial
industries to upset, nor has it any special indigenous native fauna to lose.
The large Birds of Paradise are being terribly harassed in their native
country, and it is by no means improbable that unless legislation intervenes
their total extermination will only be a matter of a few years. Under these
circumstances Sir William's public spirited action in attempting to preserve
for posterity one of the most beautiful of living creatures is much to be
commended. Apart from this, there is another and scientific aspect to the
question--our knowledge of the evolution of geographic races and the
time taken for them to evolve is practically nil. It is extremely unlikely
that if these birds thrive and increase they will in course of years remain
exactly similar to what they now are. Differences of tint and possibly of
structure are sooner or later almost bound to occur. In this case we have
full details of the time aud circumstances under which these birds were

By R. Cosgrave.
{By kind permission of the Lady Lii.ford.)
I have been asked to write a short account of our birds at
Lilford, and I think that I cannot do better than tell you some-
thing about our Cranes, of which we have at the present time
some thirty examples, namely : two Sarus ( Grus antigone ), four
White-necked ( Grus leucauchen), two Mantclmrian (Grus viri-
dirostns ), three Demoiselle ( Grus virgo), two Stanley (Te?apteryx
paradisea), two West African Crowned (Grus pavonina&amp;apos;), two Cape
Crowned (Grus chrysoplargus ), two Hooded (Grus monachus), two
Canadian (Grus canadensis ), one Wattled (Grus carunciilata), three
Siberian (Grus leucogeranus ), two Common ( Grus communis&amp;apos;), one
American White (Grus americana ), one Australian Native Com-
panion (Grus austialasiana), one Hybrid + male Canadensis and
female Viridirostris.
The White-necked Cranes breed regularly with us each
season, invariably rearing two young. Only two eggs are laid ;
these are placed on the bare ground in the centre of the com-
partment, surrounded by a few bents of grass and any rubbish
that may be handy. The first egg is laid two clear days in
advance of the second, and the male begins to incubate the first
egg at once, so that it hatches two days before the other.
About four hours after hatching the young begins to take food,
and it is a most interesting sight to see it put out its head and
neck from under the mother's wing to take a tiny insect from
the bill of the father, who now becomes most industrious in pro-
viding for his family wants. When one day old the first young
one leaves the nest, and is immediately taken charge of by the

male, who finds all food, and broods it in the most careful and
affect ionate manner.
When the second bird is strong enough to leave the nest,
the mother takes charge of it, and both parents work hard from
dawn until about eight p.m. searching every inch of ground for
grubs and insects of all kinds. It is a very pretty sight to watch
all this labour going on ; as a rule each parent takes charge of
one young with the idea, doubtless, to avoid overfeeding one of
them more than the other. About ten days old, the young begin
to take artificial food ; we give them a mixture of soaked stale
bread, scalded poultry meal, and the best English barley meal, this
is mixed into a crumbly mess, and, in addition, they have sheep's
heart or rabbit's flesh finely minced. They take this freely and
grow strong ; at first they are fed four times daily, which is later
reduced to two meals, morning and evening. When first hatched,
the young are funny-looking little creatures ; their absurd long,
thick legs and little body look like a boy on stilts.
During the first nine months they retain the same colour,
a uniform rufous, darker on wings and back ; then comes a slight
change until, by the time they are twelve months old, they show
a dash of white feathers on the nape and also some dull slatv
feathers on the breast and sides. They remain in this condition
until the moult sets in about August, and if the birds are healthy
and well-cared for they then change into the adult plumage,
though it is not quite perfect till after the second moult.
A young pair of these birds started house-keeping on their
own account in 1907, and it is worthy to note that, in their nest-
ing operations, they are not easily satisfied like their parents
with a few handfuls round the eggs, but must have a good heap,
about half-a-barrow full or more, and we have known them not
to deposit their eggs for ten days after the nest was completed.
On two occasions we have been successful in rearing young
Canadians (Grus canadejisis). Unfortunately, the female and one
young were killed by a female Siberian Crane, and we have only
the two males left ; we found these cpiite as easy to rear as the
White-necks, and the parents equally as painstaking in their
devotion to the young.
Only on one occasion has the Sarus Crane nested with us ;

they successfully hatched off both eggs, but the young, I am
sorry to say, died of gapes at three weeks old. This loss we
attributed to stale ground, and removed the birds to a tresh and
more roomy place where, we hope, they will nest this year and
be successful in rearing young.
The Canadian and Mantchurian Cranes have bred together
on two occasions. We have only kept one. It is a fine bird, but
could not be called very handsome ; he is a mixture of white
and dark grey, and possesses all the characteristics of the father
(the Canadian) but is slightly larger. Here, again, we found that
the parents did their very best in providing insect-life, especially
the Canadian, and the young were reared quite easily. Old age
and rheumatism ended the long life of the Mantchurian last
summer.
We find that the Crowned Cranes ( Gins chrysoplargus and
Gtus pavonina) differ in many respects from all the other mem-
bers of the family. In the first place, they never want to make
friends, particularly Pavonina. They go to a considerable height
to perch at night, and will sometimes go up during the day if a
suitable place is provided in their compartment. They are large
feeders of young grass, and will eat very little grain if a plentiful
supply of bread and other soft food is at hand. Cast summer
pavonina made a nest of grass sticks and other things found
handy in the run, but nothing more happened ; as this was their
first attempt at nest-making we hope that they will go one better
this year and give us some eggs at least.
The Siberian Cranes make a large nest every season of
flags and their roots, just far enough from the pond to be above
high-water mark ; during the process the male stands knee-deep
in water, pulling up the flags vigorously, and passes each mouth-
ful on to the female who is within reach, and she in like manner
puts them on, or as near as she can, to the nest, without leaving
her place, until a good heap is ashore, then both birds walk up
to the nest and put it in order; if there is not enough to finish
they then go off again and repeat the process until the nest is
completed. Two eggs are laid, and, as is the case with the
White-necked species, the male incubates until the laying of the
second egg. It is to be regretted that these birds never succeed

in hatching young with us, and the eggs have always been clear.
My view of this is that our climate does not suit them. I find
that, during our summer months, they are in very poor health,
and appear altogether out of sorts, and suffer much from the
heat. On the approach of Autumn they begin to pick up again,
and by December they are looking well ; they are most happy
when we get snow and frosts, and take a great delight in skipping
about on the ice and sleeping thereon while it lasts. They are
by far the most aquatic of all the family when it suits their
purpose ; they take the water like a duck, and if any young ducks
should happen to be on the pond they never rest until they are
all swallowed.
These Cranes are clever fishermen. I have seen them
stand in the water up to their feathers for an hour or more at a
time, in that well-known motionless attitude of the Common
Heron ; and, although they are not such experts as the Heron,
they rarely miss a chance if an eel or other small fish comes
within their reach. Should the first shot be missed, it is wonder-
ful to see the lightning-like stabs with which they follow up the
chase in shallow water. When a fish is secured it is at once
brought ashore and receives heavy blows from their powerful
bill; when killed it is, if small enough, swallowed whole, other-
wise it is broken up.
I am sorry to say that their temper is not a very sweet one,
the male in particular is prone to fight all other Cranes, and, with
his companion, generally comes off victorious.
I hope these notes will be of interest to the readers of our
magazine; although rather long I feel that a great deal more
could be said of this most interesting and fascinating family.

On the occasion of this annual exhibition of prize winning

exceptional sliow, the former numbering 41 and the latter 24.
Linnets were short in number and the quality below the average,
only 18 birds competing. Chaffinches were good, twenty-three
excellent birds toeing the line. Mealy and Lesser Redpolls
competed together, a large number of the former being shewn
owing to the " glut" of specimens that have been obtainable this
season. There were thirty birds in the class, cage-moulted
" Lessers " deservedly taking premier honors, the "Mealy"
examples not having experienced a moult in captivity.
Fourteen Twites made a pretty show and the eighteen
Siskins were an attractive feature. Bramblefinches were shorter
in numbers than usual, but the regular spangling fine polish and
immaculate condition of the leading bird was alone worth a visit.
Hawfinches of varying merit made up a fine class of seventeen,
and eighteen Yellow Buntings formed a strong class. The class
for any other species of Bunting contained six Corn Buntings,
one Cirl Bunting, one Lapland Bunting, four Snow Buntings,
three Reed Buntings, one Meadow Bunting and one Black-
headed Bunting. The class for Hen Finches and Buntings
numbered fifteen ; Hawfinches, Chaffinches, Greenfinches, Twites,
Linnets, Siskins, Redpolls and Buntings, etc., of the gentler sex
competing for places.
The Pied, Albino and Rare Feathered Section contained
birds of considerable interest. Among these we notice a " silver "
Starling, a greyish white bird showing distinctly defined light
silver spangles ; a white Thrush, three white and two prettily
pied Blackbirds, two white Goldfinches, a pied Sparrow, a pied
Linnet, an exceptionally brilliant Redpoll with two large white
areas on cheeks, a black Hawfinch, two black Bullfinches, a
cinnamon Lark, a cinnamon Chaffinch, a cinnamon Sparrow and
two cinnamon Greenfinches. The exhibition alive, tame and in
perfect condition of such freaks of nature are of great interest,
much more so than the preservation of them in cabinets. The
institution of such class at shows has saved from the gun many
a curious example of a native bird.
The Insectivorous and Soft Feeding Birds attracted many
visitors. Blackbirds numbered 9, Thrushes 14, Starlings 9, and
the class for Nightingales and Blackcap Warblers numbering

thirteen birds. I heard one of the former singing freely whilst
judging a class near. Skylarks, although of high merit, were
small in number, which was a disappointing feature considering
the great age to which these birds live in confinement, and the
fact that they have been easily bred and are one of the easiest
birds in the world to retain alive and in song in captivity. The
production of a tip-top show bird in perfect feather, however,
requires considerable care.
The Small Resident Insectivorous and Seed-eating Section
contained ten birds, a Nuthatch, two Goldcrests, three Tree
Creepers, a Grey Wagtail, a Lesser Spotted Woodpecker and a
Redstart, the last named, although a delightful bird, was " wrong-
classed" owing to it not being a resident. The winner in this
class, a bird never yet beaten, was a delightful example of the
Dartford Warbler, claimed at the catalogue price of ^12 10s., and
exhibited by Mr. John Frostick of Balham, an original member
of this Society. Those who do not know the delightfully capti-
vating antics of this hardy little Warbler lost a "sight" in
missing this. To exhibit for the benefit of the general public, a
live specimen in perfect health and condition and remarkably
tame, of a little known bird, is, to say the least, conferring
a boon on the community.
Ten birds competed in the class for Small Migratory
Insectivorous and Seed-eating Birds. Among these we noticed
two LesserWhitethroats, two yellow Wagtails, someWheatears and
an excellent example of the Crested Lark in perfect condition.
Large Soft Feeders were also an interesting feature, the
class containing two Redwings, two Missel Thrushes, three Wax-
wings and a Great Grey Shrike. Extra classes this year were
added for Novices, and were well filled. Among the hybrid
sections were a large number of the Canary-Bullfinch cross and
among other Bullfinch crosses we noticed those with the Green-
finch, Redpoll, Goldfinch, Linnet, and a bird exhibited as a Chaff-
finch-Bullfinch. This was wrong classed, and, from obtainable
evidence and appearance of the specimen, we agree with the
verdict. The bird differed only from a normal Bullfinch in having
a brownish crown and white lesser wing coverts. The former
seems merely an inability to have produced black feathers on the

head, and if a bird exhibits abnormal plumage in one part of the
plumage, it is just as likely to do so in another. Crosses between
two other British Birds numbered seventeen, they include hybrids
of the following kinds:--Goldfinch-Siskin, ditto-Redpoll, ditto-
Greenfinch, Siskin-Greenfinch, Linnet-Greenfinch, Redpoll-
Greenfinch, Bramble-Chaffinch. Beautifully variegated, evenly-
marked and perfectly clear (i.e. free from dark feathers) hybrids
between the Canary and other Finches were to be seen. A
remarkable feature being clear birds from Goldfinch, Linnet and
Greenfinch with the Canary. Large classes of brilliantly&amp;apos;&amp;apos; coloured
Dark {i.e. birds with no light feathers in their plumage) were also
to be seen.
The immaculate condition, tameness and healthy appear-
ance ot first-rate examples of birds exhibited alive in such a
manner, that the public can get a good grasp of their appearance,
is a hobby which bears good fruit and is also of value to the
scientist.
Colour-feeding is not now practised to that extent in which
birds are entirely disfigured, it being more the custom now to
use it in such a way that lost yellows are regained ; moreover
birds are in no way harmed constitutionally by the sweet, so-
called tasteless peppers now in use. Curiously enough, Bramble
Finches show a marked partiality for this kind of food, and one
example, a great prize-winner (still hale and hearty, that has
travelled all over the British Isles) is no less than twelve years
old, as far as we know, and was not a chicken when captured.
Mr. Dewar of Scotland, Mr. Swaysland of Brighton, Mr. Weston
of London, and myself, were selected to adjudicate upon the
birds competing in our respective classes.
II. FOREIGN BIRDS.
By D. Seth-Smith.
In the Bird Show held by the " London and Provincial
Ornithological Society," from February 3rd to 7th, foreign birds
were not so well represented as at the recent show at the Horti-
cultural Hall (see page 75). The space in the centre transept
opposite the organ was curtained off and specially warmed for
the occasion, but in spite of this the place was very draughty and

the show too long for delicate birds, and it is hardly to be won-
dered at that many owners of rarities hesitate before submitting
them to the ordeal of a Palace Show. There were several very
rare exhibits, foremost amongst which was a fine team of birds
sent by Mons. Pauwels from Belgium, while Messrs. Maxwell
and Townsend were also in the front rank.
In the first of the foreign classes, that devoted to Budgeri-
gars, Lovebirds and Hanging Parrots, M. Pauwels easily won the
first place with his pair of Blue Budgerigars. It is not often that
a variety or freak is more beautiful than the normal bird from
which it is derived, but in this case I think most people will
agree that the delicate blue, set off by the white of the face,
renders this variety more strikingly beautiful than the normal
green, lovely as this bird is. Mr. Townsend's Blue-crowned
Hanging Parrot, which came second, was a very perfect specimen,
while the pair of Ceylonese Hanging Parrots sent by Mr. Maxwell,
although uncommon cage-birds at the present time, were not in
show condition.
The class for the larger Parrakeets was headed by a very
perfect male Black-hooded Parrakeet ( Psephotus cucullatus ), sent
by M. Pauwels; the second prize going to the same exhibitor's
fine pair of Bourke's Parrakeets; third came Mr. Maxwell's pair of
Browns. The Queen Alexandra Parrakeet sent by Mr. Maxwell,
although a decidedly rare bird, was old and out of condition.
Mr. O'Neill sent a nice pair of Ceram Lories.
The class for other Parrots was again headed by M. Pauwels
with a good Hawk-headed Parrot. The Rev. G. H. Raynor's
Meyer's Parrot was awarded second place, though it was not
nearly such a rare exhibit as his Everett's Thick-billed Parrot
which was placed third. M. Pauwels sent a so-called "Pigmy
Parrot," which unfortunately escaped before the show, and was
not re-captured. This bird was not, however, a true Pigmy
Parrot (. Nasiterna ) but a species of Cyclopsillacus. No specimen
of any species of true Pigmy Parrot has ever been seen in
Europe so far as I am aware.
Amongst the common Waxbills, Grassfinclres, &amp;c., there
was nothing to call for special mention ; though in the class for
the rarer species there were a few interesting exhibits. The first

prize went to a very fine Melba Finch sent by Mr. F\ Howe,
while M. Pauwels secured second place with a pair of Painted
Finches (&amp;apos;Etnblema piclai), the third prize going to a very fine
Red-lieaded Gouldian Finch belonging to Mr. Maxwell, while a
fourth was awarded to Mr. H. Botting for a nice pair of the
uncommon Rufous-backed Mannikins. A fine cock Violet-eared
Waxbill was sent by Mr. J. M. Walsh. One of the most interest-
ing birds in this class was the Red-rumped Weaver (Dinemellia
dinemelli) shown by Mr. Maxwell which failed to secure a prize,
though its rarity should, in my opinion, have stood for a good
deal. I saw several of these in Germany lately, but Mr. Maxwell's
bird is almost unique here.
The class for Grosbeaks, true Finches and Buntings con-
tained a pair of Blue Grosbeaks and three Nonpareil Buntings
only.
The Tanager class is always an interesting and showy one,
and was no exception to the rule on this occasion.
The rarest exhibit was, undoubtedly, the cock Pretre's
Tanager shown by Mr. Maxwell, which took fourth prize. The
same exhibitor showing also a fine Black-backed and a Rufous-
throated Tanager. The first prize went to an All-green or Neck-
laced Tanager shown by Messrs. Pitchford and Stocker. Mr.
Walsh sent a good Maroon and a Black, while Mr. S. Beaty
showed a Tricolor and a Black-backed, and Mr. R. J. Watts a
Rufous-tliroated.
The class for Sugar-birds, Honey-eaters, Bulbuls and Sun-
birds was headed by a most perfect male specimen of a Purple
Sunbird, which reflected the greatest credit upon Mr. Maxwell,
its owner. It was perfectly steady and sang merrily during the
show. Needless to say that, besides the first prize, it carried off
several specials.
Second came a Banana Quit, belonging to Mr. Townsend,
the only one in the show (there were four at the Horticultural
Hall Show). Third, a Purple Sugar-bird (Mr. Arthur Morris),
and, fourth, a most perfect Yellow-winged Sugar-bird belonging
to Mr. Townsend. There are few birds more exquisitely beautiful
than this. Mr. Maxwell sent, beside the Sunbird, a Purple and a
Black-headed Sugar-bird.

The class or classes at the end of the list, in which are
placed birds belonging to species not comprised elsewhere, are
always particularly interesting, and, as a rule, contain the rarest
exhibits in the show. In this show there were two classes for
such, the first for birds smaller, and the second for those larger
than a King Bird of Paradise.
In the former of these two classes a Levaillant's Barbet
was shown, but being larger than a King Bird of Paradise had to
be wrong-classed. It was one of the rarest birds in the show ;
this specimen and the one at the Zoological Gardens being
probably the only examples of this species ever imported.
The first prize in the class went to an Indian Great-billed
Flycatcher shown by Mr. Maxwell, a rare and pretty bird, well
shown. A White-eyebrowed Wood Swallow, belonging to Mr.
Walsh, came second, and a rare Mexican Hangnest, belonging to
Mr. O'Neill, third, while Mr. Walsh's fine pair of Black-headed
Sibias came fourth.
Besides the prize-winners there was a nice Blue-winged
Siva (Mr. Maxwell), a Black-throated Hangnest (Mr. Townsend),
and several birds of less importance.
The class for birds larger than a King Bird of Paradise
contained perhaps the best bird in the whole collection, namely,
a fine Cock-of-the-Rock. This was one of those collected by Mr.
Frost for Sir William Ingram. With others, it was deposited for
a time at the Zoological Gardens, where its companions remain.
It passed into the hands of AI. Pauwels, who exhibited it in
faultless condition and, thanks to the art of colour-feeding, in its
natural deep orange hue. Of course it took the first prize as well
as several specials, and well it deserved all it got. The second
prize-winner was a good Ariel Toucan belonging to Mr. S.
Watson, while Mr. Maxwell took third with a nice Crested Wood
Partridge, and Mr. Cusliny fourth with a Purple Glossy Starling,
the latter exhibitor showing besides an Indian Pitta.

By Miss Innis Dorien Smith.
In May, 1908, my brother brought me back a pair of
Paradise Ducks (New Zealand Sheldrakes) from that country.
I still have them well and flourishing. Of course the first year
they made no attempt to nest, but the following spring I had
them in an enclosed wire run (they were pinioned) on the edge of
a fresh water pool, in which I had put some branches and one
day under these branches I discovered the duck was sitting on
two eggs.
I was afraid she would not be able to rear the young ones
herself, as the place was by no means safe from rats, so I took
the eggs and put them under a hen, but sad to relate only one
duckling appeared and that was promptly squashed by the hen !
Last year they made no attempt at nesting although they
were put in the same enclosure. I was obliged to keep them in
as when they first came they had a strange habit of wandering
right away, and one morning at 5 a.m., paid a call on the keeper's
house in the village, a mile away at the other end of the island ;
and they were also found another day down on the beach and
going towards the sea where they were caught and brought safely
back, and for fear they might stray right away, I had to put them
in the wire enclosure for the rest of the spring. Each year I
have had to do the same, as every spring they wander to another
part of the island.
At the beginning of last December I think they made
another attempt at nesting, although the nest was never actually
found, but the male disappeared across the pool for two or three
days, and although they called to each other they never attempted
to meet. I think he realized his wife would be furious with him
for having left the nest and he was quite right, as when he did
attempt to return he was driven off and violently attacked by
his furious wife who would not allow him near the place ! This
went on for some time, but he became gradually braver and
thought he must "face the music"; and now, although she is
perpetually turning round and chasing him, he walks about two
or three yards behind her at a respectful distance, runs away a

Paradise Ducks.
few yards when she attacks him and then back he comes again.
I hope by degrees they will become reconciled and make another
nest this spring.
They are the most talkative birds I have ever heard, and as
soon as anyone appears they begin to chatter and continue to call
ont when anyone is about, and lay their necks on the ground
and run along after one.
They are extraordinarily tame and the female lies down
quite quietly to be stroked and looks as if she had been
mesmerized.
It is very funny to watch the way the duck runs after the
boy who feeds them and the other birds; she never stops to eat
herself when he is there, but rushes about after him at every
turn, calling out all the time.
They are rather pugnacious, too, and keep all the other
ducks and geese, such as Sheldrakes, Carolina Ducks, White-
fronted Bernicle, Chinese and Magellan gesse, in great order.
When the Paradise ducks first arrived, a Demoiselle Crane
took complete charge of them and kept all the other birds from
interfering and wandered after them wherever they went, and
was very much perturbed when they swam out on the water
farther than she could wade, but as soon as they took to
wandering she had to give up her occupation as nurse.
The male and female differ considerably in size, the duck
being a good deal smaller. The male has a black head and neck,
with dark grey pencilled body, becoming browner towards the
tail. White, green and chestnut bars on the wings and primary
feathers black. The female has a white head and neck and
chestnut brown body, the same white, green and chestnut bars
on the wings and grey pencilling on the back, but not as distinct
as the male bird.
They are much like the Australian Sheldrake without
the chestnut baud underneath.
I think anyone would find them most entertaining birds
to add to their collection.

The most important arrivals for the past month consist of
a fine King Penguin, a Jabiru Stork and a Black-necked Swan,
presented by the Director of the Buenos Ayres Zoological Gar-
dens. It is some years since the King Penguin was represented
in the Gardens. The last were kept in a small enclosure with a
pond near the old Sea Dions' pool, which has long since been
demolished to make room for the Elands' Paddock. The present
specimen will be kept with the Black-footed Penguins, and have
the run of the Sea Lions' enclosure, providing it agrees with the
present occupants.
A small collection, consisting of eleven Night Herons, two
Rufous Pigeons and a pair of Montezuma Quails have been re-
ceived from the Washington Gardens. It is hoped to establish a
nesting colony of Night Herons in the Great Aviary, but at
present most of the new arrivals are in the brown plumage of the
first year, and they will not breed until two years old. Never-
theless, we have a few adult birds which, we hope, may breed
*this spring.
A very rare and pretty finch from Southern South America
has just been received. This is Aldunati's Finch (Phrygihis
\0x25A0aldunatii), the prevailing colour being greenish yellow, the head
and wings grey. In general appearance it is not unlike a
Greenfinch with a grey head.
The Waterfowl enclosures on the site of the Western
Paddock have been completed and stocked. The footpath which
ipasses the Western Aviary has been carried straight through the
paddock, leaving a space of some sixty-five feet deep on the right,
and a large triangular space on the left. The space 011 the right
of the new footpath has been divided into eleven paddocks for
geese. Each paddock is separated from the next by a hedge,
protected 011 either side by wire-netting, so that the geese can-
not see their neighbours. Where breeding pairs of geese are
separated by wire-netting only, they spend most of their time
in running backwards and forwards in their endeavour to fight
with one another. The idea of division hedges originated with
Mr. Blaauw, and, when visiting him in 1909, I was so impressed

with the excellence of the plan that I have wanted to adopt it
in Regent's Park ever since.
The space to the left of the new pathway has been formed
into an enclosure for ducks and Flamingoes. A pond with two
islands has been made, and a shed built for new arrivals or birds
unable to stand severe frost, and the whole has been surrounded
by a rat-proof fence. The ducks here are all foreign, and com-
prise several rare species of Teal, such as Querquedula cyayioptera,
Q. discors, Nettium castaneuni, N. carolinensis and N. formosum.
So many of the ducks and Teal prefer to nest off the ground, that
I have adopted the plan of fixing nest-boxes some four or five
feet above the ground against the side of trees or on stumps let
into the ground, with sloping logs leading to the nests. Last
year, of six boxes so placed, five were taken possession of, and
from eggs laid in these boxes, we reared Andaman and Chestnut-
breasted Teal and Maned Geese. We always line the boxes with
turf and dead leaves.
In years gone by the Black-necked Swan bred freely in the
Three-island pond enclosure, and we hope that the species will
breed there again this year. It could never be kept there while
the place was occupied by Flamingoes, as the male Swan is
inclined to be very spiteful towards any large birds, though
taking little notice of the smaller ducks. The Flamingoes have
now been moved to the new pond, from which they can be run
into a warm shed in specially cold weather. Frost does not kill
Flamingoes, but they are apt to get frost-bitten legs and feet.
The collection of Pheasants is gradually being improved,
and all the available accommodation for these birds will be fully
occupied this spring. A valuable addition to the pheasantries
is a cock Bornean Fireback (Lophura ignita), presented by the
Duke of Bedford.

oologists. The part under notice commences with the Fly-
catchers, but is chiefly concerned with the great family of the
Warblers. The order and nomenclature is brought very strictly
up to date, but as, in many cases, the more familiar latin names
are also added, risks of confusion are eliminated. The Breeding
Range of each species, Distribution in England and on the Con-
tinent, Nest, Eggs, Breeding season and measurements are all
carefully and clearly given under separate headings as well as a
short synonymy and the vernacular names in different countries.
This part contains ten plates, covering many species not included
in the text of this particular part; the) 7 are carefully done and
the colouring in most examples accurate. The text itself leaves
nothing to be desired, and as a vade mecum to working oologists
it is bound to prove an invaluable mine of information.
THE COUNCIL MEETING.
By the courtesy of Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, a Meeting of the
Council of the Avicultural Society was held in the Zoological
Society's new offices, Regent's Park, on Feb. 17th, when the fol-
lowing members were present:--The Duchess of Bedford, Miss
Alderson, Mr. H. D. Astley, Mr. Newman, Mr. Willford, Mr. D.
Seth-Smith, the Hon. Business Secretary, and the Editor and
Treasurer. A considerable amount of routine business was trans-
acted ; and in connection with the discussion as to the award of
medals for priority in breeding and rearing, it was decided that
claimants for medals must be reminded that the fullest possible
details must be submitted and that the report must be sent to the
Editor within the specified time, that is to say, not later than
eight weeks after the young have left the nest. It was also
decided that the date of the winter meeting, which according to
the rule must be held some time in January, be extended to
February, so that for the convenience of country members it
may be possible in the future to hold the meeting on one of the
days of the Crystal Palace Bird Show. It was also proposed that,
if possible, a friendly and informal meeting of the members of
the Society shall be held in the Zoological Gardens after the

OBITUARY.
It is with much regret that we have to chronicle the death
of Prof. C. O. Whitman, of Chicago, one of our members.
Although not so well known in this country, except to those
whose studies lead them to read his scientific work, he was well
known in America as a pioneer in developing modern methods
of experimental research in Zoology. His efforts were chiefly

devoted to the study of embryology, heredity, hybridisation, and
the habits of animals, and some of his most curious and notable
results were obtained from the crossing of different species of
Doves. Born in 1842, he studied and took his degree at Bowdoiu
College in 1868, after travelling and studying at various Univer-
sities abroad, he held several educational posts, and was, at the
time of his death, head of the Department of Zoology at the
University of Chicago, a post to which he was appointed in
1892.
PRACTICAL BIRD-KEEPING.
III. FOREIGN DOVES.
By Miss Rosie Alderson.
The keeping of foreign doves and pigeons has never been
a very popular branch of aviculture, though many more people
keep them than in former years; and yet they are birds that have
many advantages, being long-lived, hardy (with a few exceptions)
and very adaptable to confinement. In many cases they will
rear young whilst in captivity, and a nesting bird is, to my think-
ing, a contented bird ; it shows that the old life of liberty is to
some extent only a memory and not a regret.
Though I have kept, and still have, many other kinds of
birds, yet I have gone in chiefly for keeping doves, and, at one
time and another, have had more than 40 varieties.
The Fruit Pigeons are so seldom to be had, and so rarely
kept, that there seems little to say about them. They vary very
much in size, and are often most beautiful in their colouring,
many of them being green, with perhaps a touch of purple or
yellow. They need boiled maize as their staple food, prepared
freshly every day, for it soon turns sour, and this is rather a
drawback to keeping them, as any bird-food that has to be
cooked is a certain amount of trouble.
In giving a list of such doves and pigeons in each family
that axe generally kept, I have thought it well to add some very
brief notes on the colouring of the plumage for the purpose of
identification. Setting, therefore, the Fruit Pigeons aside, as

<bodyText confidence="0.997088117647059" page_id="9404150"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
The Triangular Spotted Pigeon ( Coltanba guinea).
A large bird, slate grey in colour, with a reddish neck of
bifid feathers, the wings are dotted with triangular white spots.
This pigeon's coo is a strange kind of barking noise, sounding
almost unnatural in a bird. The eye is red, surrounded with
bare red skin.
The Spot-Winged (or Spotted) Pigeon ( Columba maczilosa).
A large, but beautifully-shaped bird ; the general colour
being pearl and ashy grey, the wings covered with whitish spots.
The eye is also grey, and the " bloom " on the neck and shoulders
of a well-conditioned bird is very lovely. I look on this pigeon
as almost the most beautiful of any of the larger varieties I have
known,
The White Crowned Pigeon ( Columba leucocephala).
A handsome dark slate bird, with a whitish cap on the
head and a sheen of colour, like the scales of a mackerel, on the
neck.
All the above birds are too large to keep in a small aviary
with other occupants, though they might do well if given an
aviary entirely to one pair of birds. I have found all these
pigeons hardy and all good-tempered to others of their own kind.
We now come to the Turtle Doves and their allies ( Peris -
tetidcs ), beginning with the sub-family Zenaidince.
Martinican or Aurita Dove. (. Ze?iaida aurita).
A plump, well-shaped dove ; the general colour being rich
chestnut fading into purplish-pink on the breast. There are a
few black and white spots on the wings, and the neck has very
beautiful purple and gold reflections. The eye is full and dark.
The Aurita is a very handsome dove and easy to breed, but its
great drawback is its aggressive ways to others of its kind, and
being a very bold bird it soon becomes master of the situation.
It is very common in Jamaica.
The White-winged Zenaida Dove ( Melopelia leucoptcra).
This bird is about the same size as the Aurita, but rather

more slender, and it has somewhat the same tyrannical dis-
position. Its colour is a soft drab, with a broad white band
running down the wing. The eye is bright orange surrounded
by a beautiful patch of bare sky-blue skin. The neck is metallic
with purple and brass sheen.
We now come to the sub-family of the Turtle ( Turlurinee ),
beginning with the familiar
Barbary Turtle Dove {Turtur risorius&amp;apos;).
This dove is too well-known to need much description, and
yet in spite of its being so common--a pair can be bought for
two shillings--it is always beautiful in its coat of cream with
black collar and bright red eyes. These birds have become so
domesticated, like the Canary, that no one would think of them
at the present day in the light of an imported foreign bird. They
breed almost too easily in captivity, using any site or material ;
they are very long-lived, and can be very readily tamed. I have
kept some for years as foster parents for hatching rarer doves
eggs, but I never found them a great success in this way ; they
seem to find out they are being imposed upon and their interest
in the strange young when hatched is generally short-lived. A
pure white variety is known as the Java Dove.
The Madagascar Turtle Doye (Tmtnr picturatus&amp;apos;).
This is a rare dove, and has not so far been kept by many
aviculturists. It is grey on the head and face with a checked
hinder neck, while its body is maroon and brown. In shape it is
strong and sturdy, though not a large bird.
Half-Collared Turtle Dove (Turtur semitorquatus).
A fine large bird, vinous colour (in varying shades) all
over. The tip of the head and forehead whitish grey. It has a
black hind collar with a narrow grey edge ; the eyes are red.
Damara Turtle Dove (Turtur damarensis).
Very like the Barbary Turtle, but much greyer and smaller
and with dark eyes instead of red. It is a common bird in its
own land, but seldom imported to this country.
The Dwarf or Ruddy Turtle Dove (Tiirhir humilis).
A beautiful little dove, very small compared to any
previously described, trim and graceful in shape. The sexes are

very distinct in colour, the cock being of a ruddy colour with
black wing quills and a clear ash-grey head and broad hind
black collar, while the hen is dun grey except for a collar of
black. The eyes of both are very dark and full. The young
birds resemble the female till they are quite a large size when
the ruddy feathers will be seen coming gradually. The Ruddy
Turtle nests readily, but the young are often forsaken just before
they can do for themselves.
The Necklaced Dove ( Turtur iigrinus).
A very lovely dove, slender in build and with a long tail.
The general colour is brown, with light huffish spots on the
wings. The breast is vinous, the head pinkish grej r , and the
eyes reddish orange. A very broad black and white checked
collar round the back of the neck. This dove seems very seldom
imported now, though, at one time, some years ago, it was very
easy to procure it. It nests freely, and is one of the most beau-
tiful of the dove family. The Necklace conies from Burma, but
a very similar dove known as the Spotted Turtle Dove (Turtur
suratensis&amp;apos;) comes from India, and is really the handsomer of the
two, for the eye is larger and a rich rubv-red, and the wing spots
are much brighter and more distinct. My cock Spotted Turtle
and my hen Necklace brought up many young ones; one year I
reared seven birds.
The Senegal Turtle Dove (Turtur senegalensis&amp;apos;).
This is a very favourite little dove ; in colour reddish and
grey. It has a black-checked collar running round the front and
sides of the neck, differing in this respect from most doves, for
the collar is usually behind. The Senegal Dove readily breeds
in captivity and is a very pretty and bright little bird, though, to
my thinking, not so attractive in colouring as the Ruddy Turtle.
We now come to the aberrant Turtle Doves (sub family
Geopeliince).
The Bar-Shouldered Dove ( Geopelia humeralis ).
This is one of the handsomest and, at the same time, one
of the most quarrelsome of all the members of the dove family.
It is not a very large bird, but is long and slender in shape, with
rather a small head in proportion to its size. The colouring is

chiefly grey and brown with bars of black across the wings, and
a fine deep hind collar of cinnamon and black. The breast is a
delicate pinkish shade, the head grey and the eye yellow, while
the bare skin round is blue-grey. The two hens I have had
were both smaller and duller and not so striking-looking as the
cock bird.
The Peaceful Dove (Geopelia tranquil Id).
This is another barred dove, but much smaller in size than
the Bar-shouldered; its length being only about nine inches.
The general colour is grey crossed with narrow black lines, the
iris is bright ash-grey.
The Zebra Dove (Geopelia striata).
There is little difference between this dove and the Peace-
ful Dove, but in the latter the black bars entirely cross the breast,
which is not so in the Zebra, also the last-named lias a brown
iris. It is much the more amiable bird of the two.
The Diamond Dove (Geopelia cuneata).
This tiny little dove is deservedly a favourite. It is very
small, slender in shape and with a long graceful tail. It varies
in colour, some specimens being drab, and others a clear ash-
grey. The wings are dotted over with tiny white spots as if the
bird had been out in a snowstorm. The colour of the eye and
surrounding skin also differs ; in some birds being bright ruby
red, in others, greenish-yellow.
The Scaly Dove (Scardafella squamosa).
This is another small slender dove ; in colour pale brownish
with darker barring of brown. It is not often imported and
specimens vary very much, some seeming almost black and
others quite light brown, the bars in the latter case showing,
of course, most conspicuously.
We now come to what Dr. Butler terms the Metal-
SPOTTED Doves (sub-family Peristerince). The first is :--
The Picui or Steel-barred Dove (Columbula picui).
This is a very tiny little dove. I have kept many speci-
mens and found it vary very much in colour, from grey to almost
black. The hens are much browner than the cocks; the most
usual colour for the latter being a soft grey. High up in the

shoulder is a bar of steel-blue feathers right across the wing.
The eyes are very lovely, the iris purple surrounded with a pale
straw-coloured outer ring.
The Passerine Dove ( Chamoepelia passerina).
This is an even smaller dove than the Picui, and is found
in many parts of the world. It varies very much in the ground-
colour of the bird ; some are almost vinous, others brown, and
again I have had one bird almost black. In all, however, the
ground-colour is dotted with a darker shade, giving the bird an
almost scaled appearance. There are steel-blue dots on the
wings, the eyes are purple, the beak orange (or in some birds
yellow) with a dark-brown tip. The Passerine is very much of a
ground dove and can run at a great pace.
The Cinnamon or Talpacoti Dove
(&amp;apos;Chamoepelia talpacoti).
A small reddish-brown dove with steel-blue marks on the
wings and a grey head. It is rather larger in size than the
Passerine.
The next in order are the Bronze-winged Pigeons (sub-
family Phabince).
The Harlequin or Cape Dove ( Ena capensis).
This pretty little dove is sometimes called the Masked
Dove. In shape it is long and slender, greyish and black in
colour with a black mask (in the cock bird) over the face and
throat. The bird's flight is very weak and hovering, and with
its long tail-feathers it looks like some large swallow-tailed
butterfly poised in the air, but it is seldom this dove flies about,
for most of the day it sits quite still on its perch unless disturbed.
The Tambourine Dove ( Tympanistria tympanistria).
This dove is also small, but totally different in shape to
the Harlequin, being round and chubby. It is a most beautiful
little bird, rich chocolate brown in colour with dark metallic
spots on the wings, the forehead, cheeks and breast being pure
white, the contrast between this and the dark-brown is very
marked. The hen has no metallic spots, and is lighter-brown
in colour, and greyish where the cock is pure white.

The Australian Green-winged Dove
(Cha/cophaps chrysochlora).
This is a very handsome bird and is always admired in an
aviary. The cock is rich maroon with bright "bottle green"
wings and back. The shoulder butts are pure white, the beak
bright red. The hen is browner in tint, and has no white, or
only very little, on the shoulder.
The Indian Green-winged Dove (Chalcophaps indica).
This dove is very similar to the one previously described,
but, to my mind, it is the handsomer of the two, as it has a white
forehead (shading into lead colour on the crown) and a white
eyebrow streak which gives it a very distinctive appearance. In
the hen the forehead is greyer.
The Bronze-wing Pigeon ( Phaps chalcoptera).
A fine large bird, but with rather short legs in proportion
to its size. It is mottled like a pheasant and, as its name implies,
has beautiful metallic reflections in the wings. In my cock these
reflections are emerald and fire-red, in the hen sage-green and
gold, but individual specimens vary. The forehead in the cock
is buff, in the hen white. The Bronze-wing nests readily, but it
is too large a bird for a very small aviary.
The Brush Bronze-wing Pigeon ( Phaps elegans).
A much smaller bird than the former and much more
rounded in shape, but equally beautiful. The colouring is not
mottled but rich maroon brown and grey, with bright metallic
feathers in the wing. The hen is duller in colour, and has not
so buff a forehead as the cock.
The Partridge Bronze-wing Pigeon.
(Geophaps script a).
This is a very pretty little dove. I11 shape it is rather like
the ordinary Bronze-wing, and mottled with brown and white in
something the same way. It has very decided white-face mark-
ings, and the reflection in the wing is green. The nest is made
in a hollow in the earth, two eggs being laid therein. It is a
bird that seldom flies about, but spends most of its time on the
ground. It is very quiet and never interferes with any other
inmate of the aviary.

170 Practical Bird-Keeping. -- III. Pigeojis and Doves.
The Plumed Ground Dove (Lophophaps plumipera).
This is a very tiny little dove, with a long upright crest
on the head. It is very active and, like the Partridge Bronze-
wing, nests on the ground, and can run at a great rate. The
general colour is bright cinnamon, with darker markings, and
black and white face colouring, a grey and black band cross the
breast. A touch of brightness is given by the bare red skin
round the eye. A very similar dove in shape and colour is the
White-bellied Ground Dove (.Lophophaps leucogaster), the chief
difference being that it has a white band--as well as the black
and grey one--across the breast
The Australian Crested Pigeon (Ocyphaps lophotes ).
A very handsome bird, but rather a tyrant 111 the aviary.
It is a fair size and well proportioned. In colour it is chiefly
grey, barred over with black, with purple, green and white
metallic feathers in the wings. The breast is pinkish-grey, and
a black upright crest surmounts the head. The Crested Dove is
very hardy and breeds well in captivity. Some birds are darker
than others and, as a rule, the darker the bird the richer the
metallic colours, but I look on the light birds as being far the
prettier of the two shades.
We now come to the Ground Doves and Pigeons (sub-
family Geotrygonince).
The Rufous Dove (.Leptoptila rcichenbachi).
The upper parts of this dove are olive brown, the breast
soft rufous, while the forehead is whitish, shading into grey on
the top of the head. There is a purple sheen on the neck and
shoulders. I11 shape it is stoutly built, with rather long legs.
The Rufous is a very good-tempered dove and nests readily in
captivity.
The White-fronted or Violet Dove.
(.Leptoptila jamaicensis&amp;apos;).
This is one of the most beautiful of all the dove family.
It is about the same size as the Rufous Dove ; the back is olive
brown, the neck very metallic in lights of gold, green and purple,
the forehead white, shading into grey on the top of the head ;
the face, throat and breast pure white, with a patch of purple pink

on each side of the upper breast, the shoulder butts white. This
dove does well in captivity, but it is not often that young ones
are reared. It seems to feel the cold, but not to such an extent
but that it can winter out of doors if protection is given.
The Red Ground or Red Mountain Dove.
(Geotrygon montana .)
This dove is getting increasingly rare. It is small in size
and the sexes differ in colour, the cock being rufous red shading
to buff on the under parts, whilst in the hen the red is replaced
by olive brown. It is a timid bird and seems to have no idea
of standing up for its own rights. A hen I had was fond of
fruit, grapes and tomato, as well as seed.
Bleeding Heart Pigeon (Phlogcenas luzonica ).
This is a very striking looking bird. It is a fair size,
sturdy in shape, with long legs. The upper parts are a beautiful
blue-grey with darker bars, alternating with lighter ones across
the wings, making four bars in all. The forehead, throat, and
breast are pure white, and in the centre of the latter part is an
irregular shaped patch of blood-ied feathers. The back of the
neck and shoulders has a lovely sheen of dark opal green, the
eye is soft purple. This pigeon is fairly easy to keep, but I find
it needs warmth and a dry floor in winter, as it spends much of
its time on the ground, and if exposed to a wet and cold surface
its feet may become diseased. It will often nest, but it is very
seldom the eggs are hatched or any young reared.
The Wonga-Wonga Pigeon (Lcucosarcia picata).
A very large bird, slate-grey, black and white in colour.
It is very handsome, with lead-grey breast patches and white
chest, covered at the side of the body with triangular white spots.
It is too large and heavy a bird to keep in a small aviary, though
those I had were of a peaceful disposition.
The Nicobar Pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica).
This strangely-shaped bird belongs to the family of
Hackled Pigeons (sub-family Caloenadince). It is a large heavy
bird, its prevailing colour metallic green and bronze. The neck
feathers are hackled, giving the bird a most curious look, almost
as if it had got wet through and had never properly dried. I

Sir, --In reply to this interesting communication, I may say there is
no doubt that fish in some form would form an excellent addition to the
menu of insectivorous and partially insectivorous species, especially fresh
water fish ; and in a state of nature I opine that there are many more of
our own indigenous species that so indulge than is generally supposed. I
never tried my Sliamas with living fish, but I well recall the fact that our
esteemed member, Mr. E. W. Harper, when in Georgetown, British Guiana,
fed his Tanagers on fresh water shrimps and found them very keen on such
diet. I am of the opinion that the Dhyal and Water Robins (Redstarts)
would be equally keen on either minute fish or shrimps from fresh water.

Columba huconota.
By T. H. Nkwman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The genus Columba may be said to be remarkable for
containing many notable examples of the most conspicuously
and curiously marked birds in the whole of the splendid order
Columba , but probably no bird exists anywhere with more quaint
and artificial looking markings than the subject of these notes;
surely no freak of the most persevering fancier has surpassed
this bird in the violent contrasts and abrupt divisions of its
markings and colours. If seen where one would expect to find
domestic pigeons one might very well pass it for some variety
of the " German Toy " class.
Though well known, and a bird when once seen is not
likely to be easily forgotten, I append the following brief des-
cription, taken from an adult female specimen :--Entire head
dark slate grey, contrasting strongly with the white of the neck
and under parts, which become light ashy-grey on the under
tail-coverts; upper surface brownish-grey, becoming purer grey
on the wing-coverts ; the wings are crossed by three dusky bands ;
the primaries, which are remarkably long, are grey ; lighter
towards their bases ; under surface of wings ashy ; lower back
white, conspicuous in flight, but nearly concealed when at rest;
rump and upper tail-coverts slaty-black; tail slaty-black with a
most remarkable whitish band, on the central feathers it is rather
more dusky than on the others and occupies about the central
part of the feathers, on the lateral ones it gradually approaches
nearer the tip, coming quite to the end of the outermost feathers,

Mr. T. H. Newman,
which have also some white on the base of the outer webs, the
effect of this band is that of a Swallow-tailed mark when the tail
is closed, but when it is spread in flight, it looks like a straight
white band drawn across the tail, becoming narrower at the ends.
A few brownish marks on the white of the hind-neck enhance
the " tame-bird " look of the Pigeon by assimilating a slightly
mis-marked appearance. Iris, rather narrow, bright yellow;
bare skin round the eye grey, same shade as the feathers of
the head ; bill dark slaty-grey, cere powdered with white ; feet
bright light red, with which the dark slaty-black claws contrast
sharply.
The sexes are very similar, the male being a trifle larger,
and his colours seem brighter and purer, the back is rather less
diffused with brown and the breast appears a purer white. It is
essentially a bird of rocky heights, being found at elevations,
varying according to season, up to 14.000 feet; its habitat extends
from Ferghana in the Russian Empire to Yarkand, Cashmere,
through the Himalayas to Thibet.
Notes on its habits seem rather meagre, but I have come
across the following:--Jerdon, "Birds of India," hi. p 472,
writes:--"This remarkably coloured Pigeon is found in the
Himalayas, . . . and is stated to frequent rocky heights and
sequestered valleys, from 10,000 feet to the snow level, in large
parties. It feeds in the fields, returning to the rocks to roost, and
is said to be shy and wary." Hume in " Lahore to Yarkand,"
commenting on the above, observes :--" During the summer this
species is, doubtless, as Dr. Jerdon remarks, chiefly found at
heights of from 10,000 to 14,000 feet, far in the interior of the
Himalayas; but during the winter it descends to the lower
ranges, is common about Simla, Massuri, Murree, &amp;c., and the
valleys below them, at elevations of from 3.500 to 7,000 feet, and
occasionally stragglers are killed quite at the foot of the Hills."
A. L. Adams, P.Z.S. 1858, p. 497, remarks that it "Inhabits the
high and rocky ranges north of Cashmere near the confines of
snow; seen frequently associating with the Indian Blue Rock-
pigeon (C. intermedia). . . . Flight strong and rapid." Again
in P.Z.S. 1S59, p. 187, he writes: " Gregarious : common in certain
sequestered mountain-valleys on the northern Cashmere ranges.

. . . Feeding in fields in the Wurdwan Valley ; it was met with
in Ledakh on one occasion." Lieut. W. W. Cordeaux, Ibis, 1S88,
p. 219, says that on April 25th at Zogila Pass, Cashmere, " Flocks
of the Snow Pigeon were feeding on the patches of vegetation
from which the snow had melted." While Davidson writes in
Ibis , 1898, p. 38, "This beautiful Pigeon was very common in the
beginning of May on the Sonamurg plateau (Cashmere), and
occasionally among the cultivation along the Sind River as far
down as Kulan. It was then in small flocks. During June we
saw it occasionally at Sonamurg, singly or in very small flocks.
It seemed generally to fly to and from a ridge of rocks not far
from the nullah joining the Sind River close to the village of
Sonamurg." Blandford, "Fauna of British India," Birds, IV.
p. 32, observes: "This Pigeon, in summer at all events, is
usually to be seen in flocks about rocky hill sides. I found it
irregularly distributed in Upper Sikkim, common in places,
rare in others at the same elevation. I never heard its call,
nor apparently has any other observer, and its unification
appears not to have been noticed, except that Lieut. Cordeaux
says that he found it breeding among inaccessible crags in the
Ai Nullah, Cashmere, in August." I conclude my quotations
with two that deal with the bird in captivity. Scully, Stray
Feathers, VIII. p. 340, remarks: "This Pigeon is found in the
upper northern regions of Nepal, but never occurs in the Nepal
Valley. I kept a specimen in confinement for several months ;
it was very tame and not at all active. It never attempted to
perch, but remained on the ground, generally in a corner of the
room. When approached by Pheasants or other birds kept with
it in the aviary it uttered the purring coo common to all pigeons,
and used to strike at the birds with its wing when they came too
near." Lastly, our member Mr. Finn, writing on the Cage-Birds
of Calcutta, Ibis, 1901, p. 443, makes the following observations:
" Before leaving the Pigeons, I ought to record the curious fact
that the Alpine Columba leuconota, which Mr. Rutledge sometimes
obtains, bears the heat perfectly well, and even shows a desire to
breed. As its note has apparently not been recorded, I may
mention that it is not a coo, but a repeated croak, not unlike a
hiccough, and, much as the bird resembles the domestic Pigeon,

176 Mr. T. H. Newman,
I have never seen it.sweep the ground with its tail when courting,
l)iit rather raise it."
The bird was originally described in 1831 by N. A. Vigors,
the first Secretary of the Zoological Gardens, in the first volume
of the " Proceedings," and forty-five years later the first two
examples were exhibited in the Gardens, where a few specimens
have been fairly frequently represented since.
My experience of the species dates from the 4th of August
1908, when I received two birds, and a third on the 20th of the
the same month ; these three birds were kept together. On
March 25th, 1909, two of them seemed to have mated, and on
April 5th I found the first egg, which must have been laid the
previous day, as a second appeared on the 6th ; these eggs were
unfertile. Another was laid on April 20th, and on the 30th I
discovered them sitting on three eggs, all of which proved
unfertile; 17th of July another egg, and on the 24th the nest
contained four eggs. Of course these two birds were both liens,
as well as the third one, yet they had behaved just as a true pair
would have done, being always together unless taking turns in
sitting on the eggs.
A real pair were obtained 011 Jan. 6tli, 1909, and a sixth
example--which proved to be a cock--on July 22nd, 1909; this
last bird mated with one of the original liens early in 1910, and
it is to this pair that most of the following notes will refer.
I have already called attention to the extreme length of
wing in this elegant bird : the tip seems to come to within about
an inch of the end of the tail, this length of the wings results in
extreme lightness and buoyancy of flight, accompanied by a
noticeable whistling sound ; from their marking, grey above and
white beneath, and mode of flight, the " Gull " Pigeon would not
be an unappropriate name for the bird. I have fastened up some
flat boards, which are much appreciated as resting-places, but
much time is spent on rather broad perches, though the birds
will often alight 011 quite small branches, they can perch quite
readily, much better than a domestic Pigeon. I think they
always spend the night in the inner house roosting on the top of
faggots ; not very much time is passed on the ground, in fact I
think they may be said only to go there to feed. They are not

quarrelsome birds, but will defend their domain from intruders ;
one pair carries on constant warfare with a pair of South African
Triangular Spotted Pigeons (C. phesonota) which live across the
way, and have quite ousted a pair of Half-collared Doves (Turtur
semitorqualus ) which formerly nested in the place which they
have chosen, so much so that the poor Half-collareds did not
attempt to nest last year at all, though formerly they were hardly
ever without eggs or young. The other pair are hard put to it
to hold their own against an aggressive pair of White-crowned
Pigeons, who want the whole of their inner house (about 10 feet
square) for their exclusive use.
I will now describe the notes and gestures, which are by no
means the least interesting feature of this curious bird ; the usual
note, which has been well described by Mr. Finn above, is a sort
of hiccough; this note is uttered when the bird is fighting, or
when it wishes to drive another from the food. When the cock
wishes to pay his addresses to the hen, if they are on the ground,
he runs after her and utters a note like kuck-kuck-kuck rapidly
repeated many times, the head bobbing at each kuck , this is
generally followed by the hiccough note several times repeated ;
at each the head is bobbed down while the hinder part of the
body is jerked upwards so that the tail will point almost straight
up, but is not spread as one might have imagined in order to
display its markings ; this action is quite ludicrous to watch, and
reminds one for all the world of some child's mechanical toy.
If he is very excited he may give a little hop after the hen now
and then, during which the tail is certainly spread and depressed
a little, this is very like the action of a hen domestic Pigeon when
the cock is playing up to her. The note used by the male when
sitting in the nest, in order to attract his mate, seems to be a
sort of combination of the two usual notes--hiccough hiccough,
kuck-kuck -hiccough.
It is to be regretted that the nidification of this Pigeon
does not seem to have been described ; perhaps Dteut. Cordeaux
never actually saw the nests, but it undoubtedly nests among
rocks, very likely like our Rock and Stock Doves, but whether in
deep caverns like the former, or shallower depressions like the
latter, it is impossible to say. For a roclc-building species, I was

surprised what very substantial nests my birds built; the pair that
afterwards hatched young, placed a number of small branches in
a corner of the inner house of their aviary on the top of a heap
of faggots, some eight or nine feet from the ground ; this place
seemed to suit them as they always sat well, the birds became
tamer as nest succeeded nest ; at first the sitting bird would slip
off the nest when anyone entered, but after a time the old bird
would allow itself to be touched when sitting, only puffing out
its feathers and gently striking with its wing.
I have thirteen eggs, laid by at least three different females,
they are pure white and glossy and vary in shape to a remarkable
degree, from a prolonged pointed oval to a very round form, with
one end scarcely more pointed than the other, in size they about
equal those of our Stock Dove; in addition I have also an
abnormally small egg, perfectly formed, but which is scarcely as
large as that of a Turtle-dove.
The first egg of my breeding pair was laid on the 4th of
March, 1910, the second on the 6th, a young one was hatched on
the 25th; duration of incubation nineteen days; the egg was
chipped on the 24th ; this bird lived to be about five weeks old,
and is the bird described in the early stages below; the other
egg was addled. O11 May 14th I found a fresh egg, another being
laid the following day, these hatched on June 1st; incubation
seventeen days; these birds lived respectively for four weeks and
five weeks and three days. O11 June 30th the old birds had two
more eggs which hatched on July 18th ; eighteen, or perhaps
nineteen, days incubation ; these birds died when nearly five and
seven weeks old. The fourth and last set of eggs were laid on
August 19th and 21st, and two more young--making seven
altogether--were hatched on the 8th of September ; eighteen
days incubation. One young died when four weeks old, the
other was fully reared and lived until December 13th, being
over three months old at the time of its death,

Although I published an article on this subject in the
April number of our Magazine for last year, I think it is of
importance to continue the record, in order that whenever a
complete paper on the longevity of captive birds is prepared
at a later date, the full period for which the various species have
been kept in health may be known.
In my former paper I mentioned various species in my
collection which were still living when I wrote it; some of these
have since died, but others are still living and likely to continue
alive, so far as I can see, and each extra year passed in cage or
aviary is of importance in a record of this nature.
Grey-winged Blackbird: still in good health, nearly
nine years.
My Sharia is still living, having been over seven years in
my possession.
South African Mountain Chat. Presented April 1908:
the female is still living after nearly three years.
Chinese Bulbul purchased June 1S99 and still in good
health : eleven yeais and nine months in my possession. I
somehow confounded its probable age with the time I had owned
it in my previous note.
Archbishop Tanager. Presented end of 1903 and still
in vigorous health : over seven years.
Scarlet Tanager : Two males purchased in 1S97, both
living and well : fourteen years.
Ciiingolo Song - Sparrow. One sent to me by Mr.
Teschemaker in 1907 still living: over three years.
Tropical Seed-finch. One presented in November 1907
still living: over three years
Fire-red Finch. One presented in November 1907 still
living : over three years.
Black-headed Lined Finch. Presented November 1907,
died June 4th, 1910. As it was singing the day before, it was
probably killed by the Tropical Seed-finch : two and a half
years.

Long-tailed Whydah. Received in exchange April
1907, when it was certainly not a young bird : it died while

the one recorded in my previous paper.
Grenadier Weaver. Presented September 1906, still in

I have been looking up the date when my English Jay
was given to me ; it was then a blue-eved nestling. I find that I
received it about June 1898 and it is still in magnificent condition,
having only once been temporarily indisposed. I now very
rarely give this bird raw meat, though, when I catch one, I
give it a mouse: over twelve and a half years.

they get all that my other insectivorous birds leave unsoiled. On
the other hand my English Jay will not touch orange, though he
is fond of banana and grapes : most fruit-eaters delight in grapes.
I am told that some Shamas will eat fruit; my bird will not look
at it, and on one occasion when I put a small sweet-water grape
into his cage, which he apparently mistook for a coiled up green
caterpillar, and so pecked it, he was so disgusted that he con-
tinued jerking his bill sideways for quite a long time in the
effort to get rid of the objectionable taste.

TWO UNCOMMON BIRDS.
THE WHITE-CRESTED TURACO &amp; MAROON ORIOLE.

<bodyText confidence="0.992391625" page_id="9404170"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
By H. WlLLFORD.
It may be of interest to some of our members to have a
few notes on the two species I am about to describe, and I am
able to show photographs of both, taken from life in my bird
studio.
The White-Crested Turaco is an exquisitely beautiful
species belonging to the family Musophagidcz, which consists of
six genera, comprising about two dozen species. They are
natives of Africa, the present species (71 corythaix) ranging over
South Africa where it is locally called the Lory. The Alusopha-
gidcB are also known as Plaintain eaters. Their feet are.semi-
zygodactylous, the outer toe being reversible and the claws
strong.
The Plaintain eaters are mostly to be seen on the tops of
high trees, though they are also to be seen amid the tangled
creepers below, flitting from shrub to shrub if disturbed, and
alighting with crest erect and upturned tail.
In a state of nature their food, we are told, consists of
bananas, tamarinds, papaw&amp;apos;-apples and other wild fruits and
berries, which are varied with insects, worms, caterpillars and
even small birds.
The nest is a mere flat structure of sticks in some tall
tree ; the clutch usually consisting of three greenish or bluish-
white eggs.

Our fellow member, Mr. H. D. Astley, possessed this
species, ana in 190S one chick was hatched out but unfortunately
not reared (see Vol. V T L, New Series p. 297).
One may often observe on these birds, when descending
from a high perch or rising up to the same again, the beautiful
carmine of the under wing coverts and flights, and also for a
brief spell at the moment of alighting, their regal garb is then
noticed in all its beauty.
The body colouring is green, with bronze shades on the
wing ; lower throat, shoulders and breast beautiful pea-green ;
iris of the eye dark red, eye lids red ; beak yellow, short and
curved.
This species is indeed exquisite with its beautiful soft
blends of green relieved by a reddish crest reaching down the
neck, and lightly&amp;apos;&amp;apos; tipped on top with white, also the greyish
white face, and the carmine red of the under wing coverts and
flights.
My birds, four in number, came over in pairs; the first
pair having been with me now about three months. It was
entirely due to Miss Ivens, another member of our Society, that
I was fortunate enough to secure them. They seem very hard}',
thriving on a mixture of ordinary soft food with plenty of small
pieces of banana and apple with occasional other fruits, though
oranges I have been warned against as being too acid. Previous
to their coming into my possession they were fed largely on
Peros, a Portugese fruit, half pear, half apple, these I am unable
to get, but find they like bananas and grapes better.
At present, my birds are in a large cage till the Spring,
when I hope to turn them out with an idea of their breeding.
The Maroon Oriole (Oriolus trailli).
The family Oriolidcc are ail beautiful and striking birds,
very pugnacious, in particular with each other, and not to be
trusted with birds smaller than themselves.
They are bold and fearless, but do not readily become
steady in a cage, though there is a good deal of individualism in
this respect; and so far the Maroons are the most confiding of
any I have kept.
The Maroon Oriole has but seldom been imported, and it

is very probable that my three birds, consisting of an adult male
and female and immature male, are the only living representatives
of this species in Great Britain at the present time.
The adult male has a black head and throat, bluish beak,
maroon back and breast, black wings and dirty salmon pink tail.
The hen is similar and of the same size, but has the back
brownish black, breast striated black, grey and white, and tail of
a warm brown. The young cock is exactly like the hen, except
for the eye, and here one finds a point by which to sex immature
birds; the young cock, like the adult cock, has a light yellow
iris, whereas the hen's is of a dark-brown, almost black.
They are easy to keep and thrive on a diet of fruit, mostly
bananas and soft food--both males have a harsh song, very loud
and oft repeated, but I have only heard them in the spring. They
have been with me now for over twelve months and last summer
the young male was seen carrying twigs about but no nest was
built; this year, however, they may go further, at least I hope so.
The nest is a suspended bag or pocket, constructed ot
bark, grass, leaves, moss, hair and fibre, the rim being woven
over the fork, formed by two branching twigs.
THE LESSER SPOTTED WOODPECKER.
Notes on the Rearing by Hand
from the Age of Five Days.
By P. F. M. Galloway.
This little Woodpecker is a handsome bird and a very
interesting one in captivity.
It is some five or six years ago since I first found the nest
of this species. The site chosen was a projecting limb of a dead
apple tree, at the end ot a paddock, close to a small wood and
the nest was not more than fifteen feet from the ground ; the top
portion of the limb had been blown off at some period by the
wind, and within a few inches of the top of the stump a hole
had been beautifully bored, about the size round of a penny
and about seven inches in depth.
The hole faced a footpath frequented by children and I
felt sure the nest would be interfered with by them sooner or

later, and as I was anxious to obtain a male of this species,
I kept a very keen eye on it.
I noticed the hen bird fly to the hole and watched her in,
I waited a quarter of an hour and as she did not come out, I
concluded she was incubating and made a note to that effect in
my pocket book, so that I should know when the young would
be feathering.
On the day I considered them large enough to rear by
hand I went to the tree, but when some distance from it, was
surprised to hear such a noise going on in the hole, I naturally
thought that I had been deceived and that she had been sitting
a few days longer than I had reckoned and in consequence the
young would be larger than I had expected them to be.
With a small keyhole saw I took out a piece of the wood,
in shape like a half circle so that in case the young were not old
enough to take, the piece could be replaced just where it had
been taken from and could be fixed firmly in its place by a
small nail each side, and the difference in the size of the hole
would be only the width of the teeth of the saw.
On getting the young out (five in number) I was astonished
to find them quite naked and evidently only five days old,
probably less, for their eyes were barely open, thus proving
that instead of sitting on eggs when I saw her go in, she was
only commencing to lay her clutch. I at once put them back
and replaced the portion of wood cut out and retired some
distance from the spot to watch the hen feed and go on to brood
them. She arrived at the hole within a couple of minutes with
food and made several attempts to go in but would not, the cock
did the same, they would both go oft and return in a short time,
but refused to go into the hole. This more than astonished me,
for the Green and Greater Spotted Woodpeckers will take not the
slightest notice of the nesting hole being made larger or even
being altered in shape, as I have examined young at different
ages of both species, replaced them in the hole and they have all
been reared successfully by the parents and have flown.
I waited a full hour, but the birds did not feed, neither did
the hen go on to the nest to brood them and I knew that the
young, being so small, they would be getting quite cold, so there

was nothing to be done but take them and rear by hand. When
I took them out they were almost stone cold and could only just
move, I kept them in my warm hands and before I reached
home they were getting lively from the warmth. At that time I
had a small Hearson's Incubator at work, so I placed them in
the warm drying box at the top of the Incubator, and this having
a glass lid I was thereby able to see at a glance how they were
going on, and within half-an-hour their necks were all stretched
out and their mouths open for food. I fed them every twenty to
thirty minutes, from 5 a.111. to dusk, on live insect food, con-
sisting of daddy long legs, wood lice, earwigs and smooth green
caterpillars found on Oak and Beech trees, also found on the
leaves of Hazelnut bushes. Knowing where to find this food in
plenty, I had no trouble and the birds thrived, grew quickly and
feathered well. When fifteen days old I added to their diet the
larvae of the cockchaffer, selecting the smaller ones, also meal-
worms ; at three weeks old, I began to give them small pieces of
my own soft food "Life" and gradually substituted live fresh
ants' eggs for the caterpillars, etc.
No water was given until they were being fed partly on
soft food and then only a drop occasionallv.
Nestlings do not require water and it is never carried
to them by the old birds, the caterpillars and other insects given
by the parent birds contain quite sufficient moisture ; even in the
case of Hardbills, the parents carry no water to the young, the
various seeds being fed to the young somewhat in a pappy state
from the crop of the old birds, and not until the young begin to
feed themselves is water really required. The five grew into
very fine birds and they proved to be two cocks and three hens,
the former had very rich scarlet caps on their heads and the
black and white plumage was also very rich, in fact the) 7 w&amp;apos;ere
almost as bright in plumage as the adults and exceedingly tame.
I kept them for some time together in a large cage fitted
up with bark from an oak tree.
After some weeks, I took the three hens and released them
in the same neighbourhood as I had taken them from and quite
close to the same spot.
I walked down to see if I could see anything of them a

couple of days afterwards and found that they had shifted from
the side of the wood to some large Elm and Poplar trees at the
bottom of the field close to a brook, here they were busy running
up the smaller limbs hammering and pecking.
I did not see the third hen, but as the two were all right, I
had no reason to doubt but what the other was also.
A few days before releasing the birds, I fed them princi-
pally on caterpillars, earwigs and such insects as the birds would
be able to find when at large, this should always be done before
giving birds their freedom, especially the insectivorous species.
It is a great mistake to turn a bird loose after being fed for
a long time in captivity on a soft food, mealworms and gentles,
etc., it cannot find these foods when given its liberty, and being
thoroughly used to this diet, it naturally looks for it and I am
convinced, many, if allowed their liberty, would soon get thick
and starve, especially hand-reared birds.
The two males which I kept, soon made holes through
their cages, so much so that they looked as if they had been
riddled with large bullets, and the new cages I had to have lined
with zinc.
The Lesser Spotted Woodpecker is far rarer than the
Greater Spotted or Green ar.d its habits are somewhat different.
The nesting hole of the two latter species is invariably bored
into the main trunk of the tree, whilst that of the former species
is almost always bored into a limb projecting up from the trunk
and this often in a dead limb, only a few feet in circumference.
The favourite tree chosen is generally a tall Poplar or Elm,
occasionally an Oak or Apple tree.
They seldom alight upon the main trunk like the other
Woodpeckers, but prefer to run up and search over all the
smaller dead boughs and twigs for their food. This bird likes to
keep to himself and I have never seen more than one at a time,
except in the spring of the year, when they have paired.
If the weather in early March should be sunny and fine
the cock of this species will commence his call of Ke, Ke, Ke,
repeated several times in succession, something like the note of
the Wryneck, but pitched in a much higher key. This bird (the
cock) also makes a loud jarring noise at this season of the year,

Zoo Notes.
the sound resembling a thick stick being drawn rapidly along
some wooden railings, sometimes this jarring may be heard
pitched in a high key and the next minute in a deep or lower
tone, this is not a note from the bird's throat, but is produced by
the bird's beak being hammered against the dead, but tough,
hard limb of the tree at a tremendous pace, so fast, that the head
of the bird can scarcely be seen to move. It may be heard at a
very great distance, on a calm day. The reason of the rattling
being heard in different tones is caused by the bird moving from
a thick to a thinner branch, the thick wood causing the lower
tone, when rapidly hammered, and the thin the higher pitched
sound.
When courting, the male bird sometimes in flying a short
distance to another tree, will alter its bounding or undulating
flight and fly straight and limply flap its wings, similar to the
flight of a large Bat or Butterfly. These birds wander about the
country, far from their breeding-ground, in winter, but return to
it as early as the middle of February.
ZOO. NOTES.
By The Curator.
A pair of Siamese Firebaek Pheasants (. Lophura diardi )
has been purchased, together with a female of the rare Bornean
species L. ignita, the latter making a pair with the male pre-
sented by the Duke of Bedford as mentioned last month.
The collection of Birds of Prey has been enriched by the
acquisition of a Jackal Buzzard ( Buteo jacal) from South Africa,
and a Red-backed Buzzard (B. erytluonotus ) from South America.
A Chestnut-breasted Teal ( Nettium castaneuvi) is the first
to lay eggs in the new enclosure at the west end of the Gardens.
She selected a nest box about four feet from the ground and laid
four eggs, but as the weather was very cold the eggs were taken
and are now in an incubator. These Australian Teal besides
being very rare are some of the most desirable of the smaller
Waterfowl, being excellent breeders, hardy and beautiful.

This is the second and revised edition of a German work
which has been translated for the benefit of English brid lovers. It
may be said to deal chiefly with the active side of Bird Protection.
To protect birds efficiently in a continent like Europe, which is
almost entirely dominated by man and his works, it is not
sufficient merely to pass laws and prevent undue destruction
of bird-life. Many species owe their diminution not so much
to their direct destruction by man as to the destruction of their
homes, such as woods, old ruins, draining of marshes, and the
general higher state of cultivation, which must inevitably follow
the advance of civilisation. Count Berlepsch, an eminent
German ornithologist, has, after many years experimenting,
discovered the best and most efficient way by which artificial
homes, either in the form of nest boxes or by the planting and
cultivation of special shrubs and trees, can be made to replace
the natural homes that have been unavoidably destroyed. By
these means many species of birds can be induced to settle and
nest and their numbers thereby greatly increased. The results
of Count Berlepsch's work are given in this little book, which
is copiously illustrated to show the different forms of nest-boxes,
feeding troughs, etc., etc., and also to show the most suitable
situations and methods in which they should be fixed. To all
bird-lovers who have a garden, however small, this book should
especially appeal, as by following its directions they will pro-
bably be able to induce many species to make their home with
them. We might mention that specimens of the Berlepsch nest-
boxes are 011 view and on sale at the offices of the Royal Society

Reviews.
Almost the entire part is given up to the Reed Warbler,
the account of this species occupying no less than sixty-one
pages. Certainly never before has this species, if any other,
been treated so thoroughly.
The life history of any species forms a subject of the
utmost interest and fascination to the individual who knows how
to observe and has the facilities for doing so. The Warblers
being amongst the shyest of birds present the greatest difficulties
to those who would unravel problems of their life history ; and
a species such as the Reed Warbler, whose haunts are the swamps
and reed-beds of the Broad-lands and similar localities, is perhaps
one of the birds whose habits are least known of our wild birds.
Mr. Eliot Howard therefore deserves the thanks and congratula-
tions of ornithologists and naturalists generally for the extra-
ordinary success he has attained in the difficult task he has set
himself to accomplish.
In the Midland Counties the forerunners of this species
arrive during the first week in May, the males appearing first
and occupying their several territories, these territories being
carefully guarded and every other male of the same species
fiercely driven away. When the females arrive nest-building
commences at once. Males and females however continue to
arrive and pair so long as suitable and sufficient territory remains.
This question of territory is an important one, much more
so, Mr. Howard believes, than has been generally supposed, in
fact he attributes the constant battles which take place amongst
the males of so many species more to the acquisition of territory
than to the securing of females ; which throws an entirely new
light upon the problem.
This and numerous other problems connected with the life
history of these birds are discussed at length by the author and
some of his conclusions if proved to be correct will add con-
siderably to our knowledge not only of Warblers but of other
species.
This part contains five coloured and five photogravure
plates by H. Gronvold, all of which show the birds in character-
istic attitudes. D.S-S.

The numbers of British Birds under review are of varied
and general interest. Mr. Mullens gives a detailed and historical
account of the Tradescant Museum. Messrs. C. J. and H. G.
Alexander continue their observations on the Song Period of
Birds, and it will doubtless come as a surprise to many to find that
a number of our native birds are in song during a large portion
of the year. Messrs. Witherby and Hartert describe the Irish Jay
as a new race and without offering an opinion as to the validity or
otherwise of their diagnosis, we think it a pity that original
descriptions should be published in a popular magazine. For
the rest there are a large number of short notes, dealing, for the
most part, with the occurrences of rare birds, or of continental
races of our commoner species in various counties, and the
recovery of marked birds is also referred to in each part.

Our member, Mr. Allen Silver, has given us a most
exhaustive and complete account of the best methods for keep-
ing our native birds. Although primarily written for exhibitors,
the directions given are wide and comprehensive, and the book
will be found equally useful both for those whose only available
space is a cage in a living room or for others, who can afford an
aviary in their gardens.
The book is divided under monthly headings, and in due
season we are told how to catch and meat off adult birds, or how
to hand-rear nestlings. The best kind of aviaries and different
sorts of food are all dealt with in detail, as well as the more
technical points of preparing birds for exhibition. To those
interested in British Birds, whether they be novices or old hands,
this book should prove invaluable and the birds themselves,
could they but speak, would we feel sure thank the author for
putting their special needs in captivity before the public. Hav-
ing made a special study of British Birds for many years, we can

THE LAW RELATING TO CAGE BIRDS.
Sir,--I n consequence&amp;apos;of a recent judicial interpretation of the Acts
relating to wild birds in the County of London, the possesion, purchase and
sale of such creatures is in danger of prohibition in the said County.
This Bye-Law was intended to protect birds inhabiting the County
of Loudon, not to prevent citizens possessing or selling lawfully caught
birds obtained in other districts. Such a state of affairs imposed upon
the community would practically annihilate the several branches of avicul-
ture largely practised to-day, and the consequent benefits and pleasure
derived therefrom.
On account of this interpretation of the law, the National British
Bird and Hybrid Club (a Society that has done much to instruct, encourage
and perfect bird-fanciers in the art of bird-keeping, showing, etc.) has
formulated and set in circulation a petition to the Home Secretary in order
that a proper understanding may be arrived at. Bird-keeping is a pastime
that is enjoyed by all sections of the public, and the lot of domesticated
birds has vastly improved. Just as members of this Society derive enter-
tainment and knowledge from the keeping and breeding of exotic species,
so do those less fortunate enjoy the pleasure of keeping, as hybridizing
agents, exhibition specimens, pets or song birds, the various common

British species that are the favourite cage birds to-day, and it is only reason-
able that they should object to interference with the possession or traffic of
legally acquired property.
The species that are in chief demand are without exception still
extremely common throughout the greater part of Europe and are, more-
over, a moving quantity. The toll taken of their numbers for purposes of
caging is insignificant compared w&amp;apos;ith the manner in which their presence
or absence depends upon the suitability of existing conditions or the manner
in which thousands of the birds we protect are slaughtered for food and
other purposes when they leave our shores.
I therefore appeal to members of this Society to, where possible, sup-
port this petition with their signatures should it come their way, in order
that their less fortunate brethren may be allowed to continue the progress
of this very legitimate form of indulgence. It may not be long before we
shall find ourselves in a similar plight, owing to an inability to acquire
foreign birds, and in spite of the short-comings that may exist (which by
business-like methods can be set right) it would be a pity after the good
work that has been done to find that the keeping of birds was confined
practically to public bodies who (owing to almost unsurmountable diffi-
culties) are not always the most perfect exponents of the art of keeping,
breeding or retaining in good health perfect examples of once wild birds.

THE HOOPOE IN CHESHIRE.
Mr. Witlierby informs us that a Hoopoe frequented some private
grounds in the neighbourhood of Macclesfield from December 20th to
January 28th last.
Although this species is an occasional spring visitor to this country,
chiefly in the southern and eastern counties, the occurrence of this individ-
ual so far north in mid-winter points to its being in all probability an
escaped bird. Should any of our readers have lost such a bird, or know of
any importations a short time previous to the first-mentioned date, we
should be glad if they would let us know in order that the record may be
corrected. Ed.

Feeding.
I give my large doves a staple diet of wheat, dari, hemp,
white millet, and a little rice. They have also a good supply of
pea nuts (or monkey nuts) shelled and cut into pieces, and I look
on this last item as being very important in keeping the birds in
good condition and glossy plumage, the oil in the nut contribut-

lug to this end. I know of only one firm that supplies the nut
in this form (and also a "soft food," price Sd. per lb., that I shall
mention later on), namely, Messrs. Armitage, Seed Merchants,
Castle Gate, Nottingham, and the price is about 4/- per stone,
the size of the piece of nut can be regulated as desired.
Doves are also fond of ground sweet biscuit, this I cut up
myself in a Spratt's cutter, but I look on the biscuit more as a
luxury than a necessity ; still a change and variation of diet is
good for all birds, and helps to keep them happy and healthy.
Some doves are fond of fruit as well as seed. My Black-
bearded Doves like red currants, the Bronzewings wineberries
(not quite ripe), the Bleeding Hearts grape stones, and I have
already told you how the Red Mountain Dove liked cut up
grapes and tomato.
I also find that "soft food" is much appreciated by some
birds. My Bleeding Hearts, for instance, have it daily, and it
keeps them in perfect condition. I have no doubt many of the
others would enjoy it too, but to give it to all my doves regularly
would mean a large addition to the cost of my food bill. I have
used this particular " soft food" for years, it is mixed with an
equal quantity of dry ground biscuit and moistened ; the birds
all seem to do well on it (if given in addition to the seed diet)
including my cock Barraband Parrakeet and many other birds
besides the doves. Of course, the very tiny doves must have
smail seeds given besides those larger seeds already mentioned.
Another thing to remember is to have a good supply of
ground egg-shell, the shells being well dried over the kitchen
range before they are crushed. Especially put plenty of grit
on the floor during the nesting season, and you should have
no soft-shelled eggs.
When nesting, give the old birds plenty of food, especially
of any seed they seem to like. Remember they have not only to
feed their young ones from the crop, but to keep up their own
strength under the strain of nesting. A young bird well fed
will stay contentedly in the nest, and between eating and sleeping
should grow well ; but if not sufficiently nourished it will be
restless and probably wriggle out of the nest in its helpless
efforts to satisfy its needs.

Housing.
Most doves are hardy and can stand our winters if some
protection in the shape of cover is given. Of course the severity
of the winter varies in different parts of the country. Here in
Nottinghamshire we get our share of cold (up to 28 degrees of
frost sometimes) though not very far north.
As a rule, doves do not seem to care much for heat, and in
my largest aviary they prefer roosting under the glass roofed
part of the flights to going in the shelters, where they would get
some heat from the stove in the passage that runs along the back
of the aviary. As it is, this fire is of little or no benefit to them,,
but it is a necessity on other accounts, namely, keeping the
stored food-stuffs from damp, and giving heat to some parrots
and squirrels who live in cages in the passage, also it is very
useful to have heat in case of sickness.
If you have room, therefore, give your birds as long a
flight as possible, with plenty of cover under a sheltered roof, for I
do not think it advisable to encourage the birds to roost in cover
that has only wire netting above it, for it must mean that on a
wet night the birds are often sleeping wet through. I put plenty
of bare perches in my open part, but, though the birds use them
in the daytime, at night they nearly all go into the cover under
the glass roofed part of the flight, and looking in from the front
of the aviary you would almost think it empty.
The best cover to use is Scotch Fir branches fastened with
nails and wire to the aviary walls. It makes the aviary look very
pretty, and can easily be renewed when necessary; further, the
branches being off the floor it gives more ground room, and the
mice cannot so easily climb up it. I find the Scotch is the only
fir that keeps its "needles" well ; if this cannot be had pea-sticks
can be used, laid crossways, but nothing is so nice as the fir.
My doves much enjoy a broad wooden shelf running along
the front of the inside of the aviary, about half-way up from the
ground. They spend most of the day on it, basking in the
sun in summer, or enjoying, with uplifted wings, a shower of
rain. A good wetting like this does them good in the daytime,
and is quite a different thing to birds roosting wet through.
A bath is a necessity, for doves are very fond of bathing.

It should be large and shallow, with a waste pipe let into the
ground. I use earthenware cottage sinks, and make a flight of
two or three steps down into the bath by cementing in some flat
tiles.
Half my flight, that portion under the glass roof, is floored
with cement; the other half, directly under the wire netting, is
of crushed ashes over earth, with wire sunk underneath.
It is a good plan to have a draw curtain, with rings on a
wire, across the front of the aviary. It keeps out the cold at
night and prevents cats frightening the birds. In the daytime it
can be tied back, but in very bad days in winter I keep it drawn.
In cold weather I also have a piece of canvas stretched and
nailed down over the wire top, and in summer this is shifted up
to the glass-roofed part to act as a shade, for the glass gets very
hot and trying to any nesting-bird sitting underneath it. Of
course, in a very large wire-roofed flight it would be next to
impossible to cover it with canvas, but my flights are, unfortu-
nately, only small
I have to bring in a few of the doves in winter into a
closed-heated aviary, even with the protections from cold I have
described. The Bleeding Heart Pigeons have always to come in,
and, as a rule, you will find any of the tiny doves, such as Cape,
Passerine and Picui cannot stand the severe weather, they seem
to have far less stamina than the larger varieties. A cold bird
often ends in being a sick bird, and though I strongly advocate
fresh air, yet I think it cruel to force a bird to winter out when
its constitution cannot bear the strain.

Nesting.
Doves readily make nests and lay, but not so easily rear
their young. A good pair of parent birds, that are sober enough
not to start a second nest until the first is finished, are invaluable.
The aviary should be prepared for nesting by the middle of
February, all cleaning done, any fresh branches put up, and the
zinc nest pans tied in their places. These pans I have made at
our ironmongers, they cost 6d. to 9d. each, and are shaped some-
thing like a flower-pot saucer, but with a rounded bottom and a
more slanting edge. They can be made any size, will wash, and
are never worn out. Holes are punched at intervals round the

edge, through which to pass the string to tie them to the
branches. You need two nests to each pair of birds, as if you
put up one only the young ones may be turned out before the
proper time if the old birds desire to nest again. It may be
urged the second nest only tempts them to start afresh, but I
look on it as the lesser evil.
Plenty of dried heather should be scattered on the floor.
If you have none growing near you it can be bought by the
bundle from Mr. Fred Hiscock, Blashford, Hants. I get some
from him every year and know of no better or more cleanly
nesting material, and it may even be soaked and washed and
used a second time. I also put a small handful in each nest to
start the birds. The heather should be broken into lengths
about five inches long, and after the birds have picked up what
they want from the floor, and the eggs are laid, the remaining
heather should be taken away or they may still go on piling it on
the top of the eggs.
Sometimes the birds will not care for your site of a nest,
but will choose their own, squatting --not perching--in the par-
ticular branch. When you notice this it is as well to put a nest
pan up in the exact spot, when the birds will probably start at
once; doves are very peculiar in their little ways and cannot be
forced.
I make it a rule always to fasten up my nest pans in the
cover under the glass roof or shelter--not in the open flight, for
it is most essential that whilst the young are in the nest, and
especially when too large to be brooded continually--they are
kept dry. Be sure and put a thick bed of hay or straw under the
nest when the young are hatched, so as to make their first descent
easier or to soften their fall should they tumble out prematurely.
Sometimes you may find a partly-fledged dove on the floor, with
no broken limbs,--the hay has saved that --but in a state of
collapse and cold and limp, its legs stretched, and head dangling
down, perishing for want of its parents' warmth. It is always
worth while to hold the helpless little thing in your hand for say
half-an-hour or more. If there is just a spark of life left the live
warmth of your hand will bring it round more quickly than any-
thing. It is wonderful how far gone a bird may be and yet

recover. Do not hurry its recovery, let it at least be able to hold
its head up and to sit upright in your hand before you put it
back in the nest, and be sure and do this very gently, or the
second young one may jump out too, and do not attempt it while
the old bird is in the nest. Of course, you may just send it off,
but there is a great risk it might not come back, and in that case
you would probably lose both young ones.
It is useless, however, to attempt to restore a young bird
to the nest when it has got beyond the fledgling stage, and is
getting fully feathered, for it would only jump out again. If a
young bird should leave the nest just a day or two before it
naturally should do, it is better to leave it and not interfere.
When the young ones are out, take away all your hay bed,
save a small handful in one coiner for the young birds to nestle
in, (for a soft floor quickly makes weak legs), they should be
prevented from wandering into any part of the aviary where the
top is open netting or the floor damp. If you do not do this they
will be certain to squat where they should not, for their little
legs are soon tired, and the result will be an internal chill caused
by contact with the cold surface. The next stage will be that the
young one will become greatly relaxed, and will weaken and die,
for the parents will purposely neglect an unhealthy young bird.
It is not a bad plan to put lidless boxes (turned on one side) with
a snug bed of hay in, for the young ones to go into at night, as
they will probably not return to the nest after once leaving it,
indeed, as they are not yet at the flying stage it would be an
impossibility when once they are on the floor.
On the question of hand-rearing a deserted young bird, I
think there is much to learn, and all being well this summer I
hope to make some experiments. I used to think it a hopeless
task, but recently I have rather changed my mind from an
accidental discovery.
The most important point is to know zvhen to take the bird
in hand. If the weakness has got ahead there is a poor chance
of overtaking it, and whilst ever there seems a chance that the
parents are doing their duty one is reluctant to interfere.
Quite accidentally last year I learnt hozv to feed a young
dove. Doves, as you know, feed the young from the crop, the

young ones putting their beaks right inside that of the old bird
who pumps up the food from its crop. I never liked the idea of
feeding young birds from one's lips, so I used to try and hand-
feed with a blunted and shaped quill toothpick, opening the beak
and forcing the food down the throat. Often it was a failure.
Young doves are very obstinate and zvill die, if they want to,
despite all you can do. Last summer, I was hand-rearing a little
Barbary only a day or two old. Its rightful place had been taken
by a small Brush Bronzewing, who, being smaller than its foster-
brother, was getting too little food and doing badly, so I took the
Barbary's own young one away. It did wonderfully well, and
being very healthy wriggled about in my left hand as I fed it
with the toothpick, making it rather a work of patience, for it
lost as much food as it took. Suddenly it accidently pushed its
head between the base of the first and second finger of my left
hand, and the change in its attitude was instantaneous. It
thought my fingers round it zvas the enclosing parent&amp;apos;s beak, and
its mouth opened very wide and it took the food almost faster
than I could put it in. After that things went gaily, I had no
more trouble of forcing an obstinate little beak open with the
toothpick, but had only to put its beak between my fingers when
it would wriggle and squeak for food, opening the beak very wide
and standing on tip toe in its excitement.
During the intervals of feeding, the little dove was kept in
a pot placed on the hot pipes in the greenhouse. A handful of
hay was put in the pot, some flannel on the top of the bird, and
over this a piece of perforated zinc to prevent the young one
jumping out. It soon knew my step and voice, and would at
once start squeaking, even if it could not see me, when I catne to
feed it.
The young Brush Bronzewing dying I put the Barbary
back with its parents ; they seemed very pleased, and at once
went to feed it. And now comes the strange part, instead of
thrusting its beak into that of the old bird, the young one just
opened its beak and squeaked. The cock Barbary retired quite
puzzled, and evidently consulted with the hen, for in some way
she made the young one understand, and shortly after I saw it
being fed in the natural way. It may have been partly the heat.

but this young bird grew and throve most wonderfully under my
care, which was almost from the time of hatching. It was a
well-feathered bird when I put it back in the nest. As food for
hand-rearing a young bird I should give the following articles,
all moistened and made soft with water : Spratts' malt milk and
pepsinated puppy meal for the first day or two (both these articles
are in powder form, like flour, and can be mixed to any con-
sistency), then "soft food" in addition, mixed with biscuit, and,
later still, soaked small seeds.
Doves have the reputation of being quarrelsome and, in
some individual cases it is true, but this is the case witha:// kinds
of birds, their tempers vary just as much as human beings do,
I think the great secret in doves living happily together (where
more than one pair is kept) is to find out which birds will agree,
and having once found a peaceable combination, not to disturb
it. Some time ago I had four pairs of different doves all nesting
in one small aviary ; further, they carried their amiability so far
as to feed each others young ones. On the other hand, if there
is going to be trouble it will show itself at once, and it is better
to separate the birds straight away, for nothing will induce them
to be friendly if they have made up their minds to be the reverse.
I look on doves and pigeons as very pleasant birds to keep,
and their harmonious colouring grows on one very much. Their
different notes, too, are very interesting, for many birds have
varied coos to express their moods.
I have no space to touch on sickness, but with any sick
bird I think heat is most important, for an ailing bird so quickly
grows cold, and for this purpose a stove in the aviary is invalu-
able. In summer, a flat hot-water bottle in a box with a bed
of hay might be used, or I have sometimes thought a chicken
" foster-mother " would make a good " hospital cage."
This is only a bare outline as to the keeping of doves;
they are a family of birds long neglected, and there is still very
much to learn about them. There are hundred of kinds never
yet imported, for the dealers get very little encouragement, but
to anyone with enterprise and ample means at their disposal
there is a grand opening to bring some entirely new knowledge
to aviculture, of a very pleasant kind.

[We have received the following notes oil this bird, which forms our
frontispiece for this month, from Mr. C. T. Maxwell, whose success in keep-
ing these delicate birds is well-known. Ed.]
Sir, -- I am indeed pleased to bear that you contemplate
giving an illustration of my Purple Sun Bird in the Avicultural
Magazine. I have had the bird now about a year; it came into
my possession out of colour, and apparently a young one.
My method of feeding this and all the more delicate Sugar
Birds is to place as much Mellin's Food as can be heaped up on
a salt spoon into a cup, and then pour on to it about a quarter of
a pint of boiling water and well stir, then add a salt spoonful of
honey and a good tablespoonful of Nestle's milk, again well
stirring together. After first putting a little crumbled stale
sponge cake into each bird's food pot I fill it up with the above,
which is sufficient for about eight birds. For fruit my Sun Bird
likes nothing so well as Tangerine oranges, and I endeavour
to get these nearly all through the year.
I keep it in a cage, about two feet long, in which it seems
perfectly happy and contented, singing lustily--for it has an
extraordinarily loud song for its size--whenever the weather is
at all bright.
I know of hardly any desirable bird, if any, to equal it for
exquisite beauty and adaptability to cage life ; but of course it
needs great care, and I have found specimens most difficult to
obtain, if it were not so the charm of possession would diminish
infinitely. C. T. Maxwell.

MORE NOTES ON THE CROSSBILL.

The fact of Crossbills nesting in captivity in England is
deeply interesting. The Crossbill has always been a special
favourite of mine among pet birds, and one I brought several
years ago from Tyrol had a romantic story.
One autumn day, when driving in a wild part of the
mountains, we met some Roumanian gipsies. Under their cart
swung a little battered cage, and in it sat a Crossbill. VVe
stopped and bought the bird, and brought it home to England.
The delight of the little creature on being transferred from its
wretched prison (which we took care to have burnt at the next
inn we stopped at) to a new roomy cage, was quite touching,
and when he was given a bath, it amounted to ecstacy. He
" chipped " and whistled, and splashed in and ont as if he never
could have enough. One wing was broken--an old injury--but
otherwise he was quite healthy.
In his home in England he lived near a window looking
south-east, on a large branch of an apple tree, with a fir bough
on it. On the matting below was his little cage with his food
in it, and close by his bath a large flower-pot saucer, which I
prefer to any other kind, as birds can perch on the rim. He had
complete freedom, but never left his bough, except to climb
down sometimes fora trip in the garden, where he " chipped "
to the wild birds, and then hurried back again to his bough,
especially when the Ring-doves walked in and helped them-
selves to the food in his cage. Once he fetched me in from the
garden to fill his bath which was empty, and in order to make
me understand what he wanted he took hold of my dress in his
beak. His days were spent in climbing up and down his beloved
bough, and sitting among the fir needles, singing his sweet song,
expressive of all the sounds of his native forest--the chip of the
woodman's axe, the clink of falling stones and bits of rock, the
tinkle of the brook, and the whistle of the wind in the pines.
" Ziller," as we called him, used to hide in his fir bough if
visitors came, and would hiss at them if they were strangers.
He loved a game, and used to play with me on his branch a sort
of hide-and-seek, 'chipping ' and hissing with fun and excitement.

When the sun set, he concealed himself most wonderfully on his
branch, as he objected to being caught and put in his cage to
roost. Alas ! one morning, Ziller was found lying in his cage in
great suffering, and, in spite of every effort to relieve him, he
died in my hand. He had pecked the rubber tubing of the
window as he sat on his bough, and this obviously was the cause
of his death. We still miss our little mountain friend with his
clever ways and sweet music.
The pair I have now are full of character, and enjoy their
liberty to a great extent, for the bay-window in which their aviary
\0x25A0cage is, is open at the top all day and their cage-door is often open,
but they never fly away. Their cage is divided into an 'orchard'
and a 'fir-wood.' The orchard has fresh earth thickly strewn in
it, with moss and leaves and tufts of grass and their bath, and
apple and nut boughs to perch on and pick to pieces. The fir-
wood has sand and gravel, small pine logs and chips and fir
branches. I give them hemp, fir-seed, canary and buckwheat,
fir cones and the cores of apples, for even when the cones are
*empty they like playing with them and picking them to pieces,
always dropping them into their water--either to soften the
cones or add turpentine to their bath ? When our Christmas tree
was dismantled in December last it was placed near their cage
for them to enjoy, and all day they played in it, and roosted in it
.at night. We have seen them in their own native haunts--the
mountain forests of Germany and Austria--playing among the
great spruce firs, where clusters of their favourite cones hang
ready for them to work at and pick out the fir seeds.
In Tyrol, and other mountainous districts of Austria, the
country people keep them in little cages and feed them on hemp
only, believing firmly that the Kreuzschnabel, or Krummschnabel,
keeps off illness; any infection being carried off from human
beings to himself--a belief probably based upon the legend of
the Crossbill. I have often been told in Tyrol that there are
two kinds of Kreuzschnabel, the greenish bird which is red when
young, and retains the mystic ruddy spots upon its breast for
some time ; and the yellow Crossbill, a larger bird.
I get my fir-seed (Tannen- or Fichten-samen) from Ger-
many, as I cannot find any corn-dealer in England who sells it.

(Concluded from page 17S).
The record of another pair is much worse; these are the
birds received on Jan. 6th, 1909. They live in another compart-
ment and are chiefly remarkable for building a most substantial
and well put together nest among the open branches of some
brush wood ; it was entirely composed of small branches, was
several inches thick and was lined with smaller twigs, not in the
least the sort of nest I should have expected from such a rock-
loving bird. Later on, another nest, nearly as well made, was
built about two or three feet from the first one, after which first
one and then the other was used to lay in ; however, it may well
be that this unnatural site did not really suit the birds, as they
always deserted their eggs when they had been sitting about a
week. Four eggs were laid in 1909, and about a dozen last year,
the last two on the 18th and 20th of August; these eggs were
put under a pair of White-throated Pigeons (C. albigularis )
which hatched one young on September 7th ; incubation again
eighteen days, so that the period is evidently 17--19, average
eighteen days. This last young bird lived to be six weeks old.
Thus the net result of a year&amp;apos;s breeding from two pairs was eight
young hatched from about twenty eggs, all now dead. I have
the melancholy satisfaction of seeing an unique row of eight nice
skins ranging from four weeks to three months old, a series
rendered very complete by the presence of a beautiful skin of
one of the adult odd females, which died early last year.
I do not know if the damp, sunless summer had anything
to do with lack of vigour in the young birds; they all seemed to
be doing well until the time approached proper for them to leave
the nest, then they generally declined, and the old birds seemed
to lose interest in them and refused to feed them. I believe if
only they would have continued to look after them for a very few
days longer that, at least, several would have reached maturity;,
certainly the only one that did become fully independent was
reared during the sunny days of late September and early Octo-
ber ; it seemed a very strong bird, soon taking to driving even

the big White-throated Pigeons from the food pots when feeding,
and went on well, although it was plucked by a cock Crested
Pigeon on the head and wings rather badly soon after leaving
the nest; at first it used to give a squeak when pecking at
another bird, but it soon acquired the hiccough note of the
adults. I had not noticed anything wrong with it until I found
it one morning on its back dead.
The following notes will show how the young bird de-
velopes. March 26th, a young one hatched previous day was
covered with light yellow down ; bill dusky pink, with narrow
dark band near the tip; feet bright pink. When five days old
its eyes were well opened, feathers on wings, back and flanks
appearing, some downy ones on the latter part beginning to
burst their sheaths. April 4th, the young one was much grown,
feathers on wings, back and rump well developed, feathers on
crop, pale grey with buffy tinge, not white as in the adult; tail
just beginning to grow, but looks very short for the size of the
bird; primaries just beginning to expand; feathers on head
only just showing with yellow down on their ends ; bill blackish
with whitish tip; bare skin round eye and ear ashy grey; feet
dull grey with pinkish tinge ; iris dull brown ; general appear-
ance of a grey bird with conspicuous white lower back. When
a fortnight old it was much grown, one bar beginning to show
across the wing ; crop and breast pale ashy grey, former with
buffy tint ; feathers on head still in sheath, but ready to expand ;
tail still short, but beginning to show beyond its coverts ; when
touched it snaps its bill and pecks ; utters a shrill squeak when
being fed by its parents. At three weeks the young bird was
much bigger, two black bauds now on the wings, on the median
and greater wing-coverts ; head dark grey ; tail growing ; the
white band beginning to show on the outer feathers ; crop region
very buffy-looking. April 21st, nearly four weeks old, bird now
well fledged, all the tail feathers (except the two central ones)
show the white band ; the pale grey of the breast now extends
round the back of the neck ; head dark grey, thickly covered
with yellow down; iris very dark brown; bill brownish black,
yellowish horn at extreme tip; feet greyish pink ; claws, which
are very long, dark horn, almost black.

Mr. T. H. Newman,
Two skins of birds four weeks old differ rather in colour-
ation, the smaller specimen has the breast and crop ashy, with
the feathers strongly tinged with buff; abdomen lighter, more
ashy ; if the adult bird was not known it would be difficult to
imagine that it would then be white breasted ; the whitish bar
on the central tail-feathers has not yet appeared ; head, wing,
rump and breast, especially in the larger specimen, thickly
sprinkled with yellow down adhering to the ends of the feathers;
the tail is about three inches long.
Three individuals, about five weeks old, are now about
two-thirds grown, the under surface is pale grey diffused with
brownish buff; the wings have become long and pointed; one
specimen shows four distinct bars on the wings ; tail about four
inches long, all the feathers showing the light band ; yellow
down has mostly disappeared, thickest on the rump. At six
weeks the bird has practically attained its adult proportions, the
light band on the tail is now very noticeable; all the primaries,
except the outermost ones, are full grown ; a little down here
and there still remains on the upper surface ; the bird becomes
independent of its parents about this age. When seven weeks
old the first plumage is quite complete ; a few traces of down
still retained.
It will be well here to compare the young bird with the
adult. In size it appears nearly as large, but is slimmer in build ;
the upper surface is practically the same, being of exactly the
same brownish grey tint, not at all duller as might have been
expected ; in fact, if anything the grey is purer aud lighter,
especially at the edges of the wings; entire head same slaty
grey. The under surface is very different, when the feathers of
the crop and upper breast first appear they are of a brownish-buff
tint at their ends, light ashy at their bases with whitish shafts ;
as the bird grows older the breast becomes lighter and more
ashy; the flanks in both adult and young are pale ashy, slightly
tinged with buff. I should here like to call attention to the
enormous size of the claws of the young bird ; when four weeks
old they are fully as long as in the full-grown bird, aud at seven
weeks they look almost like the talons of a bird of prey, being
over three quarters of an inch long, strongly curved and hooked

at the tip, doubtless this is to enable the bird to get a firm footing
on the rocks, they soon get worn down ; the adult birds, even in
captivity, having much shorter and blunter claws.
I now come to the bird which died when it was a little
over three months old. The first quill and tail-feathers are still
retained, but nearly the whole of the smaller feathers seem to
have been renewed, many are still growing and so are perfectly
fresh moulted, this perhaps accounts for the brilliant colouring
of this bird ; the upper surface as well as the sides of the head
are a good shade darker than in the adult, being of a blackish-
grey colour, the chin is lighter and does not yet seem to have
been moulted, numerous pin feathers appearing here; the upper
surface of the body does not call for special remark, beyond the
fact that the three bars on the wings are very distinct and black ;
on the under surface all trace of the brownish buff of immaturity
has disappeared, but the crop, and to a lesser extent the abdomen,
is covered by feathers of a beautiful pure pinkish-buff; the breast
might be described as diffused with a pale rosy tint, I believe that
this is the normal colouration of this part when the feathers first
appear, but that they fade to almost pure white after a little while,
though my old birds have moulted twice since I have had them
I certainly have not remarked this rosy tint, but when the bird
is flying about it is not so conspicuous; I had not noticed it in
the young bird until I came to handle it. Although the breast
appears white in the old birds, the downy part at the bases of the
feathers is ashy-grey, and the central portion of the upper sur-
face of the shafts of these feathers is dark-greyish in colour.
The plumage of the breast is wonderfully thick and silky looking.
This brings me to the end of my notes on this most curious
and highly interesting bird, which is also known by the names of
White-backed, White-bellied, Blanched and Hooded Pigeon. It
is seldom imported, so cannot often be obtained ; it seems scarcely
credible, yet the importer of my birds told me that there was
little demand for them and that he would never go to the trouble
of obtaining more, so singularly apathetic are Bird-keepers when
they have the opportunity of acquiring something really worth
having.

Bucorax cafer.
By Miss Alice Hutchinson.
I was much interested in reading Mr. Sclater's article in
the February magazine on this somewhat uncanny-looking bird
of S. Africa, for to me he is quite an old friend.
He is not at all timid in his wild state, and I have often
seen couples of them walking about on the veldt, looking for tit
bits in the way of frogs, beetles, locusts, &amp;c., and not troubling
to fly off as we passed on horseback.
A pair built every year in the big gum trees not far from
our house, though the nest was never visible ; the trees were
large and of a great height, and as the limbs were often torn off
by the wind, or smashed by lightning, most likely they found
many convenient hollows for their nest, quite invisible to human
beings below.
Their curious booming note has earned for them, in Natal,
the name of Doom-doom, from the Kafir word dmna, meaning
thunder, and the natives have a great superstition that if a Doom-
doom is wantonly destroyed, a most terrible thunderstorm will
come and work havoc among their crops and cattle ; so, thanks to
this superstition, this large and interesting bird is left in peace.
He seems to be quite harmless, and is certainly not a
beauty, so there is no reason why he should be molested, and we
hope that the Kafirs will always keep up their superstition about
him, and not take a fancy to any part of his person with which to
adorn themselves. The pretty little cock ' isakabula ' (Whydah
bird) suffers from the vanity of the natives, for he is persecuted
for his beautiful bunch of tail-feathers, which are considered
a very high-class adornment as a head-dress on festive occasions.
I think the Colonists have a secret affection for the Brom-
Vogel, and rather like to hear them about among their trees, for
he does not seem to fall a victim to the too ready gun of most
of them, who, worse luck, learn to shoot from their childhood,
and evidently find a great pleasure (save the mark) in destroying
God's creatures.

By Grkgory M. Mathews, F.R.S.E.
In a collection of bird skins, eggs and nests sent to me
from North-West Australia, I find some interesting material.
The nest of the Pale Bush Lark ( Mirafra milligani ,
Mathews), was found out in an open plain and was placed between
two small bunches of grass. It was constructed of stems and
blades of old dead grass and lined with finer material of the
same kind. In shape it was hooded, with a large opening in the
side. Dimensions outside: 4J by 4 by 4 inches high. Inside:
2 by 2 by 2f inches high. Size of entrance : if wide by 2 inches
high.
The nest was built into a small neatly-made hole in the
ground.
Clutch, three. Stone-colour marked all over with irregular
spots of brown, with underlying ones of lilac. 2o mm - by 14.
Two of these eggs were hard set, the other clear. The
parents were also sent. Collected 011 January of this year.
This Bush Lark is found in the North-West of Australia
only.
The nest of the Black-tailed Thickhead ( Pachycephala
melamira, Gould), was placed six feet up in a Mangrove tree, in
a three-pronged fork. It was constructed of soft coarse rootlets
(one of which was twenty-four inches long) and lined with finer
ones. The outside of the nest was lightly covered with cobwebs
and was loosely attached to the tree with the same material.
Dimensions outside: 3J by 3S by 2J inches. Inside: 2 by 2 by
if inches deep.
Clutch, two. Whitish ground colour, with a ring round the
top end, of red spots and underlying ones of grey. 2i mm - by 16.
Collected Dec. 27th, 1910. The parents were also sent.
The nest of the White-bellied Thickhead {Pachycephala
lanoides, Gould), was placed six feet up in a white Mangrove, and
was built in a fork in the centre of a small tree growing out in
the open beach about ten yards from the Mangrove thicket. The
nest was conspicuous, and was built of twigs and rootlets and
lined with finer material. It was fastened to the tree with cob-
webs. Dimensions outside : 45 by 4f by 2J inches deep. Inside :

Clutch, two; brown olive spotted round the larger end
with deeper olive spots. 27 mm - by iS. One egg hard set, the
other clear. Collected 23rd Dec., 1910. The parents were also
sent.
A peculiarity of these two species of Thickheads is that so
often one finds one of the eggs hard set and the other clear.
The Grey Robin ( Poecilodryas cinereiceps , Hartert), is never
found away from the Mangroves. They are quiet birds, mostly
ground feeders, and are usually seen perched on a twig close to
the ground. They sit perfectly still, occasionally uttering a low
whistling note, which is repeated once.
Piezorhynchus nitidus, Gould, are found in the very densest
Mangrove scrub, and are usually seen creeping through the roots
within a few inches of the ground. They are not numerous.
The Dusky Fly-eater ( Gesygone terebrora. Hall), is purely
a bird of the Mangroves, and is very tame, and will come within
a foot or two of one; in fact, they have alighted on the barrel of
a gun. It is difficult to get far enough away from them to
shoot them, so that one can skin them afterwards.
It is very noticeable how the scrub birds, and those of the
Mangroves, keep to their own localities. Taken as a whole there
are few birds in the latter place.
With reference to the Long-tailed Grass Finch ( Po&amp;apos;ephila
acuticauda, Gould), there is absolutely no difference between the
colour of the bills of those from Wyndham and those from
Derby. It will be remembered that a sub-species was described
from captive birds and called P. hecki by Heinroth, and P.
aurantiirostris by North. These two latter names are only
synonyms of P. acuticauda.
The nest of the White-shafted Fantail ( Rhipidura
alisten Mathews), is wine-glass shaped (with a tail - piece)
composed of soft pieces of dried bark, plastered over the outside
with spiders' webs, and lined inside with horse-hair or soft bark.
Dimensions: outside, 2 inches to 2\ inches, by about 4J inches
(including the tail-piece). Inside, ij to ij inches by about one
inch deep.
Clutch, three. Very light buff, spotted all over, but more
thickly (forming a zone) round the larger end. i6 mm - by 12.

The nest of the Australian Raven ( Co/vus marianee,.
Mathews), is a large open one, composed of sticks, which get
finer as the egg cavity is leached. Situated in a forked tree.
The cavity is lined with fine material. Inside measurements:
8 inches by 5
Clutch, three to four. Long shaped ; pale green ground
colour, irregularly spotted, but more at the larger end, with spots
and smudges of dark-brown. 45"&quot;&quot; by 28.

Swinhoe's Pheasant (. Euplocamus szvinhoii ); 2 Woodhouse Jays
(.Aphelocome woodhousei ), and 3 Pigmy Ground Doves ( Chavioepelia
viinutd) from America, both of which species appear to be new
to the collection ; 1 Fraser's Eagle-Owl {Bubo poensis&amp;apos;) ; 2 Sharpe's
Wood-Owls ( Symium nuchale)\ 1 Beautiful Wood Hawk {Dryo-
triorchis speclabilis ), and 1 One-streaked Hawk ( Melierax ?no?io-
grammicus&amp;apos;) from West Africa ; a fine adult cock Monaul Pheasant
(.Lophophorus impeyanus) from the Himalayas ; a Red-bellied
Thrush ( Tardus rufivenlris) from Brazil, and three Mortier's
Waterhens ( Tribonyx mortieri ) from Tasmania.
We have several clutches of ducks eggs under hens, and
hope to rear a number of good kinds. At present we have
Chestnut-breasted, Chilian and Andaman Teal, Carolina Ducks
and Variegated Sheldrakes' eggs. I believe that the only really
satisfactory way of rearing the better kinds of ducks is to take
the eggs and trust them to reliable liens.

The Black-necked Swans, which nested too early in the
year, tailed to hatch, the eggs being doubtless chilled by the
excessively cold weather. These birds often go to nest in June
or July, when success is much more likely.
The Pheasants have commenced to lay, and it has been
extremely interesting to watch the wonderful and various
methods of display of the cocks of the different species. The
Horned Tragopan for instance walks round the hen with his
body flattened out so as to display as much as possible of his
wonderful plumage on the side nearest to her. Occasionally in
moments of great excitement he suddenly inflates the loose skin
of his throat forming an elongated bag of intense blue.
The male Peacock Pheasant again is a wonderful spectacle
when in full display, but as I understand Mr. Pocock is about to
give us a paper on the display of this species I will not attempt
to describe it here.
I hope we may be successful this year in breeding the
Hammer-head (Scopus umbietta). The pair that bred last year
have been bus}&amp;apos; all through the winter finishing off a nest com-
menced last autumn.
Nesting platforms have been fitted up in the Eastern Aviary
for Curassows and the pair of Cariamas, and I hope we may be
successful with some of these interesting birds.
In the Crescent Aviary Redrumps, Cockatiels and Bngeri-
gars are nesting.

Sir,-- With regard to Aviculture and the Protection of Birds, I cannot
see why the two should clash. I belong both to the " Avicultural Society,"
and the " Wild Birds' Protection Society," and it has always seemed to me
that the two could with advantage work together. The Aviculturist should
be as keen about the Protection of Birds, as the Wild Birds' Protectionist.
Exaggeration and going to extremes usually defeat the object in view,
and prevent useful work from being done.
Aviculture is a beautiful, interesting and useful branch of learning,
.giving pleasure and knowledge to very many, and enabling the bird to
become acquainted with and have confidence in his human friend. Very

few people are able to study the bird in its native haunt, and the only way
of learning about him is to keep him--not a prisoner, but a pet.
A pet bird should be given its own natural surroundings as far as
possible, and the owner should learn of the bird, and not expect the bird to
learn of him.
What a wretched sight to see a little Goldfinch or Redpoll doing
tricks, or to hear a piping Bullfinch go over the same song like a machine
wound up ! O11 the other hand, given their natural conditions as far as
possible, these same birds will exhibit far more interesting traits of their
own than any tricks that man can teach them.
The crying evil of bird-taking is the senseless indiscriminate way in
which the birds are caught, millions to adorn (?) fashionable hats of silly
women, and millions to fill the bird-dealers' shops.
If, in addition to the Anti-plumage bill, laws were enacted for the
restriction and proper surveillance of bird-catching--all over the British
Empire--the cause of aviculture would not suffer, while beautiful species
would not become rare or extinct. There could be licensed watchers and
catchers, one young bird to be taken out of a brood, and only so many
taken as are wanted. If the trappers are sufficiently keen to almost clear
a district of birds, the watchers can be equally keen to prevent this being
done. Bov-scouts would make excellent watchers.
Bird-dealing could be relegated to a few licensed dealers, thoroughly
understanding their business, to receive the birds 011 their arrival. It is
often a joy and solace to a poor person to keep a pet bird, and this should
be permissable, members of the Avicultural Society seeing to it that proper
conditions are fulfilled. As a wild bird's protectionist, I should be tempted
in my zeal for my beloved feathered friends, to push things to extremes, if
I did not reflect that untold myriads of beautiful birds perish yearly in
migration, becoming the prey of other birds, or dashed against lighthouses.
We have just read of the remarkable rush of millions of birds com-
ing to Ireland, terrified by atmospheric conditions, and the fearful waste of
bird life in consequence. Add to this the frequent congested flocks of
Larks and Crossbills arriving here, more than half probably perishing, not
to mention the countless numbers of birds that perish from cold in winter
all over the earth,--and the capture of a few hundred birds in the cause of
Science, with the prospect of a happy life before them with their human
friends, sinks into insignificance. Katharine Currev.

a young one was hatched and lived for a month, but waded into some soft
mud and was unable to extricate itself. They nested again twice but did
not hatch their eggs.
A second pair had two chicks both of which were drowned. They
nested again a second time, but with no result.
The White-necked Japanese Cranes reared one young one. The
Mantchuriau Cranes did the same.
A male Wliooper and female North American Swan (C. columbianus)
nested and hatched five cygnets. Two were killed by deer and the remain-
ing three survived. These hybrids are curious as neither species has
nested at Woburn before, and though both birds could have mated with
their own kind, they have persistently "walked out" together for at least
two years.
There were broods of Bahama Pintails, Fulvous Ducks, Brazilau
Teal, Chilian Teal, Chilian Pintails, Mandarin Ducks, Carolina Ducks and
American Wigeon, but I do not think that any arrived at maturity.
A pair of Rose-breasted Cockatoos made a hole in the ground in the
Abbey quadrangle in which they laid three eggs. Two young birds were
hatched, both of which survived. The old birds are full-winged and at
large, but come to the Abbey to feed.
The Orange Weavers, which are also at large in the garden, made
nests and laid eggs, but I am not aware that any were hatched. They are
very satisfactory birds to turn out as we see a flock of about twenty-four of
them, day after day on the same bushes.
Two pairs of Red-eared Bulbuls made four nests in the garden.
Sixteen Darwin's Rheas were hatched but only four were reared.
Both adults and young birds suffered very much from ticks which attached
themselves round the eyes. After the ticks came flies, which caused the
eyelids to swell so that the birds were blinded and could not feed. As the
cock bird was wild when in charge of the young, and as we have not been
successful in rearing them by&amp;apos; hand we were obliged to leave them out, and
onlv just saved the cock bv taking him in for treatment when the young
were old enough to look after themselves. M. Bkdfokd.

Written so long ago as 1862, this book is now in its twelfth
edition, so we must conclude that there is still some demand for
it amongst those for whose use it was designed. In his preface
the author expressly disclaims all idea of proposing it as a sub-
stitute for more comprehensive works, and suggests that it will
be found a pleasant companion for country walks and as a
preparation for the more serious study of ornithology. I11 the
present age of increased interest in all things appertaining to
Nature Study an elementary and popular handbook devoted to
the study of our country's Birds is certain!}&amp;apos; - welcome, if the
knowledge contained in it be sound. We can heartily recommend
the book as one which contains a reliable groundwork for young
Nature Students. Having been written so long ago, errors are
to be expected, but these are surprisingly few, and we have come
across none of serious moment, the arrangement and nomen-
clature are of course antiquated, but for the class of reader for
which this book is intended this is of minor importance.
The wood blocks, which illustrate almost every species,
being taken from drawings by Wolf, are of course accurate and
quite adequate to the subject matter. The coloured illustrations
on the other hand are, we think, a mistake. It is impossible to
produce really good coloured plates at the price at which the
book is sold, and bad ones are we consider worse than useless.
We should have certainly liked the present work better without
them. N. F. T.

in during the first seven years. The present Director however
commenced a detailed list of the stock directly he took charge in
189S, and this has been carefully kept up to date.
During the last twelve years 8,250 animals have been
registered at the Gardens, of which 4,010 were birds. The pro-
gress made is shown in a Table published of the number of
animals living in each year. I11 1898 the total was 270, and this
has gradually increased until in 1910 there were 1,464.
Captain Flower has introduced a most valuable feature
into his List, namely figures showing the maximum ascertained
length of life in the Gardens of an individual of each species.
In the case of some of the smaller birds, the length of life
has been probably longer than stated, for in a collection of
specimens of the same species it is not possible to recognise each
individual, and when one dies it is presumed to be the earliest
acquired. Thus no exaggeration of longivity can appear in the
records.
Turning to the records themselves we find that a Redstart
has lived 1 year 6 months and 6 days, and was still alive when
the Report was written ; a Red-throated Pipit r year, 6 months,
27 days, and still alive ; a Pintailed Whydah, 5 years, 10 months,
and still alive; while a Paradise Whydah was living when the
Report was compiled, which had been in the Gardens for 9 years,
2 months and 7 days. A common Avadavat lived for 7 years and
5 months; while a Java Sparrow lived for over 10 years, and a
Pintail Nonpareil for over 4 years, and so on.
There are several records of species having been bred in
the Gardens, such as the Yellow Sparrow (1), Grey-headed Love-
bird (8), Griffon Vulture (1), White Pelican (5), Buff-backed
Heron (many), White-faced Whistling Duck (16), Barred Dove
(27), Crowned Pigeon (3), Spotted Sand-grouse (2), Hey's
Partridge (41) and Green-backed Porphyrio (10).
That Captain Flower has done much for the Giza Gardens
is known not only to those who have been fortunate enough to
visit them, but to all who have followed their progress by their
publications, and now it is evident from the present Report, that
the Gardens and their live-stock reflect the greatest credit upon
their able Director and his assistant. D. S.-S.

THE EMU. *
Although not strictly an avicultural journal The Emu
contains abundant material of the greatest interest to those whose
acquaintance with the Australian avifauna is perforce confined
to caged specimens. Of late years many Australian species have
been imported alive into this country, so that birds from that
region are to be found in many private aviaries.
In the number for October, 1910, there is an extremely
interesting article by Mr. S. W. Jackson on the habits of the
Tooth-billed Bower Bird (Scenopczetes dcntirostris). Snails are
apparently its favourite food, and, from an examination of the
stomach contents, no less than four new species of Molluscs have
been described, apart from snails however, it also feeds on
insects, seeds and fruit, and should therefore adapt itself fairly
readily to captivity.
I11 common with other species of Bower Bird, the Tooth-
bill has * play-grounds ' to which he frequently resorts at certain
times of year, and which are decorated with many kinds of leaves.
Mr. Jackson studied its habits carefully and found that it only
used the leaves of certain trees, and although the leaves used were
of various sizes and shapes, yet they were obviously not picked
at random but carefully selected. The play-grounds are not used
during the breeding season, when, as Mr. Jackson remarks, it
has other and more important business to attend to.
Mr. Chandler communicates some notes on the Pardalotes,
with especial reference to their nesting habits and the plumage
of the young; and a most interesting illustration shows a flock of
Wild Lorikeets (Trichoglossus nova-ho Handies) coming down to
feed at a ' bird-table,' while their human provider ladles out a
syrup of milk and sugar on to a plate. These birds, which are
entirely wild-bred, have lost all fear, and settle on the arms, head
and shoulders of their benefactress.
The December number is a special part devoted to the
annual meeting and excursions in connection with it. We are
pleased to note that the A. O. U. is in a flourishing state both as

keen and intelligent ornithologists it could not well be otherwise.
Space forbids us from noticing this number in detail. It is
lavishly illustrated with photographs showing both the localities
visited and many nests and young birds, and one cannot fail to
be a little envious of Australian ornithologists in having so many
interesting species, nesting within comparatively easy reach of
their large commercial centres. The haunts of the Blue Wren
and of the Crimson Finch will perhaps appeal most to avicul-
turists. Those interested in the habits and life histories of
Australian birds might do worse than subscribe to a journal SO&amp;apos;

Last month we had the pleasure of noticing a book by Mr.
Silver on the practical management of Britisli Birds in captivity,
and the book now before us follows practically the same lines in
dealing with the much more intricate subject of mule and hybrid 1
breeding. To the beginner, as well as to the experienced fancier
who wishes to take up this branch of the subject, this book will
prove a reliable and exhaustive vade viecum, and if the hints given
are carefully carried out, success should be as nearly assured as
it is possible to make it. Mr. Manneringhas very wisely devoted
his space entirely to the practical side of the matter, the hybrids
themselves are not described, though those most frequently seen
on the show bench are figured in the coloured and other plates.
In the case of a book full of good things, it becomes
difficult to mention any special points, but those members who
will remember the discussion which raged some years back on
Cages versus Aviaries will be interested to note that for most
crosses Mr. Mannering advocates the former as giving the
greatest probability of success.
Those who are more interested in hybrids from the scien-
tific side will find much food for thought in many of the author's
notes. The breeding of light mules from sib-bred canaries still
awaits a scientific interpretation, and the details and difficulties
of sib-breeding, as given by a practical breeder, are well worth
a study.

Lastly, a list is given at the end of the book of the known
Hybrids that have been obtained. Although this list does not
claim to be complete (and we notice several omissions) yet it
forms a good basis on which a list may be formed, and being one
of the first attempts to make a complete list is most valuable for
reference.
Practical books, written by practical men, always contain
useful information, and we heartily recommend it to all our
readers, whether they breed hybrids or not, as it abounds in
information valuable to all aviculturists.

I11 spite of the diminution of many of the most beautiful
birds in the world, the demand for the feathers still continues
with unabated force. We do not for one moment believe that
ladies wilfully aid in this destruction, but rather that from the
dictates of fashion and from ignorance of the real state of affairs
they continue to adorn themselves with some of the most beauti-
ful of Nature's creations. In so doing they are exterminating
Nature's works of art, and once destroyed these are gone beyond
a possible hope of ever again existing. Were these facts more
widely realized we feel sure that the trade in these plumes would
cease to exist, and the little pamphlet before us, which has just
been published by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
not only puts the case and the results very clearly, but at the same
time gives an answer to the feather traders, who are opposing
tooth and nail an anti-plumage Bill now before Parliament.
The destruction done by collectors for the plume trade
becomes especially dangerous to the existence of the species
they hunt, because they are usually slaughtered during the nest-
ing season, when the plumes of all birds are at their best, and also
because at such times birds are tamer and many species collect
in large breeding colonies, thus reducing the labour of gettin g the
plumes to a minimum. The enormous destruction that is thus
brought about is almost inconceivable, but the fact remains that
in many parts of its range the Egret has ceased to exist, that on
some of the islands of New Guinea no full-plumaged Paradise

Bird escapes destruction, and that during the early part of one
season no less than 300,000 Albatrosses were slaughtered on one
small island, and the remainder only saved by the timely arrival
of a revenue cutter. No species in a state of nature can long
withstand such destruction, nor are we better than vandals to
countenance it. Although not, strictly speaking, an avicultural
subject, the wider the facts are known the better, and all lovers
of birds should read this pamphlet and learn the by no means
pleasant facts. -

PRACTICAL BIRD-KEEPING.
IV. PARRAKEETS.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
The keeping and breeding in captivity ot Parrakeets has
for long been a favourite hobby, for, taken as a whole these birds
are hardy, easy to keep and very showy.
I11 a popular article it is not possible to go very fully into
the habits and requirements of the various and very numerous
species of the smaller Parrots which are known as Parrakeets
or Paroquets, so I propose to divide this paper into two parts, the
first dealing with the kind of aviaries most suitable for these
birds, and the second with the birds themselves.
Aviakies for Parrakeets.
The best type of aviary, in the opinion of the present
writer, is that consisting of a well lighted covered shed or house,
opening into a large wire flight containing a drinking fountain
or large bath and a turf lawn. If many species of Parrakeets
are to be kept, a range of such aviaries should be erected with a
southern aspect, compartments being divided off for each pair of
the larger kinds.
Regarding the size of such aviaries. This of course must
be governed by the available space, but as a general rule the
covered portion should not be less than eight feet square and ten
feet high. If larger than this, so much the better.

Ptactical Bird-Keeping. -- IV. Parrakeets.
The wire flight should, if possible, cover a larger area than
the shed. A good rule being to make the area of the former
double that of the latter.
It is advisable that the flight should be less in height than
the shed, and the top of the opening from one to the other
should be as high up, or nearly so, as the top of the flight, most
birds, especially when new arrivals, objecting to dipping down
into a low opening.
The covered portion of an aviary should be substantially
built, preferably of brick, or double tongued boarding, and care
must be taken that no holes or chinks are left that would cause
a draught.
The roof should consist of tongued boarding, felt, and
tiles or corrugated iron, and should contain a large skylight made
to open for ventilation in hot weather, a wire-netting guard being
fixed on the inside.
A door or large window should be fixed to the opening
into the flight, so that the birds can be shut in altogether if
necessary. All windows should have a wire-netting guard on
the inside.
The floor of the shed should be of concrete, that of the
flight mostly of turf with a gravel path.
Such is, in outline, the plan of a very simple and useful
type of aviary, but this can be improved upon considerably if
thought desirable. For instance, in a range of such aviaries a
service passage running along the back with doors into each
compartment is most useful as it allows the attendant to visit
any one compartment without the necessity of going through
several other compartments to get to it.
It is most important that the aviary be made secure
against the ingress of such vermin as rats, stoats or weasels.
The inside or shed portion, if provided with a concrete floor will
be practically safe, but the outer flight, which has a natural floor
of earth is the most likely place for the enemy to attack. A
simple and effective method of making this secure is as follows.
A trench should be dug round the flight, eighteen inches wide
and eighteen inches deep, and the wire netting, which by the way
should be of five-eight or even half-inch mesh, should be carried
to the bottom of the trench and then turned outwards at right

angles to the width of the trench, and the soil filled in and
rammed. With this protection, providing there are no old drains
below the site, the aviary may be regarded as safe.
Warming.
Jf only the hardy species of Parrakeets are to be kept, and
these introduced during warm weather, it will be unnecessary to
provide artificial warmth during the winter months, providing
the aviary is in a sheltered position and has been properly con-
structed. As a rule, however, the amateur is not content to keep
only the hardy kinds, but wishes to keep those from such habitats
as the Northern parts of Australia or Tropical America, and this
being so it is necessary to provide artificial warmth during the
English winter. For newly-imported birds also, some slight
warmth is necessary until they become acclimatised, even though
they belong to species whichare quite indifferent to cold when once
established. It is, therefore, desirable that an efficient warming
plant be included in the specification of an aviary for Parrakeets.
If the aviary is divided into several compartments it would
be a good plan to be able to warm say half, that is, there would
be three of the inner portions warmed in an aviary of six com-
partments.
Regarding the type of apparatus most suitable. Hot-
water pipes, heated by a coke or anthracite boiler provide the
most economical and safest means of warming. A row of two
four-inch pipes, one the flow and the other the return pipe,
should be found quite sufficient. The boiler should be outside
the aviary, in a small shed at one end, where it can be stoked at
night without disturbing the inmates of the aviary. If possible
the pipes should run along the front of the building, just below
the doors into the flight, or the flow pipe may be carried above
the doorways and the return below them. The pipes should be
protected by a removable wire-netting guard.
There are many good boilers on the market. The present
writer used a "Horseshoe" boiler, which was quite successful,
but there are others equally good. One word of advice regard-
ing the boiler may be added, namely, that it is false economy
to have a very small boiler, as in order to properly warm the
pipes it is necessary to drive a small boiler so fiercely that it

requires constant stoking, and thus burns much more fuel than
a larger boiler which is allowed to burn gently.
Aviary Fittings.
A tray, about two inches in depth and from nine to twelve
inches in diameter forms a very useful receptacle for seed. It
should be supported upon a light iron framework hung from the
roof, where mice cannot reach it, and in such a way that it can
be lifted out for cleaning daily.
Nesting boxes are made in varying shapes and sizes. They
should be oblong in shape, with an entrance hole at one end near
the top, a short perch just below this hole, and a small door near
the end farthest from the entrance, for inspection and cleaning.
The bottom of the box should be so formed that there is a
saucer-shaped depression near the end, and a gentle slope down
to this from the entrance.
For such Parrakeets as Cockatiels, Rosellas, Redrumps, and
so forth, the dimensions of the box would be: length, i foot 6
inches; height and width 8 inches ; and the entrance 2j inches
in diameter. For larger birds, such as Kings, it should be some-
what larger, and rather smaller for such as the smaller Conures
and Lorikeets.
For Budgerigars I have found the most suitable box is one
eight inches in height by six inches in the other two dimensions,
with an entrance hole of ij inches in diameter, and the bottom
made slightly concave. But for these little Parrakeets several
nesting-boxes can be made in one as they are gregarious and
very sociable and do not object to their nesting-holes being only
a few inches apart.
Nest-boxes should always be fixed high up on the walls of
the covered portion of the aviary, preferably in a corner as far away
from the door as possible and somewhat hidden by brush-wood.
Perches should be freely supplied, and should consist
merely of strong branches of trees securely fixed to the walls or
roof. If perches or seed-tray are hung from the roof by a stout
wire, this should have a stick wired on to it to make it visible to
the birds, and so prevent them flying against it, as they might do
if the wire were practically invisible.
The floor of the shed should be covered with clean sharp

sand, and in one corner there should be a small heap of old lime-
mortar.
If a fountain, with proper supply and drainage, is provided
in the outer flight, no water will be necessary in the shed, unless
the birds are for any reason shut in, when of course water must
be supplied in a clean dish such as a glazed flower-pot saucer.

THE RESULT OF TRYING TO KEEP VARIOUS BIRDS IN AN
UNHEATED AVIARY DURING THE WINTER.

Sir,--R ecords of failures are often as instructive ill their way as
accounts of successes, and that is my excuse for sending what may seem
rather an unsatisfactory record of an experience in keeping several of my
birds in an ordinary out-of-door aviary during the winter.
The aviary was a good sized one, 17ft. by 4ft., with an average height
of 6 J ft. and boarded on every side except the east; I left the east side
unboarded to enable the birds to get what sun there was, as the south and
west sides were so over-shadowed by large firs and pines that they were
always in the shade. The east side, too, was fairly sheltered from winds,
but to make it as warm as possible I built a little hedge of furze up to about
3^ft. high. In this aviary I made a covered-in shelter, where I hoped my
birds would take refuge in the hardest weather, and then when I had also
boarded over most of the top, I hoped I had made it warm enough for the
birds I had decided to put in.
These weiea pair each of Masked Finches; Yellow-rumped Munias;
Bronze-winged Munias; Jungle Bush Quail; Hemipodes [Turnixpugnax) ;
Stubble or Australian Quail ; a cock Bengalese, and an odd hen Bush Quail.
I turned them in in November, just before leaving home for the
winter, and when I returned in the following April I found a sad record of
disaster.
Both Hemipodes had died and mysteriously disappeared, not a feather
of either having been found. The hen Jungle Bush Quails had both died
from egg-binding, the last one on April 18th ; this one had also lost every
toe of both feet. The cock Australian Quail had died crop-bound. Both
Bronze-winged Munias had died. The hen Masked Finch was dead and
the cock had lost a toe from either foot.
So of the fourteen birds turned out seven were dead in April. The
ones that came through: the cock Jungle Quail; the hen peciom/is; the
Yellow Munias, and the Bengalese; passed the winter in perfect health, in
spite of the fact that during the early part of February there was a heavy
snowstorm from the east which banked up inside the aviary, and that
there were several exceptionally hard fiosts during the winter.
The loss of toes was most certainly, I should say, caused by the frost,
and the cold was also accounted for egg-binding. The crop-binding I
cannot account for.
The Grass-finch probably died from egg-binding as,there was a nest
built in tne furze before I left in November. H. L. SlCH.

THE CINNAMON TEAL.
Querquedula cyanoptera.

During the summer of last year I had the great pleasure of
viewing the wonderful collection of Waterfowl at Woburn, and
amongst the smaller species of ducks the one that struck me
most was the very handsome and brilliantly-coloured Cinnamon
Teal. I had never before seen a living example of this species,
and promptly resolved that no stone should be left unturned to
secure specimens for the Zoological Gardens.
I was successful sooner than I anticipated, for, after writing
letters to both North and South America with a view to import-
ing specimens, I received an offer of examples of this and other
desirable species from Holland, and was able to secure two good
pairs. The Cinnamon Teal has a wide distribution in America,
occurring from California to the Straits of Magellan, and in the
Falkland Islands. It is rare in Eastern America.
Writing of this Teal in the Argentine, Mr. W. H. Hudson
remarks: "On the pampas it is common, and almost invariably
seen in pairs at all seasons. Many of the Teals are quarrelsome
in disposition ; but this species, I think, exceeds them all in
pugnacity, and when two pairs come together the males almost
invariably begin fighting.''
The two pairs now in the Zoological Gardens are kept on
separate ponds and appear to be perfectly peaceable with other
species. The male and female seem to be very affectionate and
are never more than a few yards apart. So far they have not
nested, but it is still early in the season and I imagine that they
are rather late breeders. I hope to be able to supplement these
notes later on with an account of the young birds. The nest is

(Cory). . .
A description of this lovely Teal is unnecessary in view of
Mr. Goodcliild's excellent plate which accompanys this paper.
It is about sixteen inches in length, and both sexes possess the
beautiful blue-grey wing-coverts, a character which they share
with the closely allied Blue-winged Teal (&lt; 9 . disco/s&amp;apos;) of North
America, and a few other ducks.
Ridgway describes the downy young as follows : "Above
dark olivaceous, varied by a spot of deep greenish buff on each
side of back (behind wings), and a spot of clear yellowish on
each side of rump, at base of tail ; top of head and hind neck
similar to back but darker; forehead, broad superciliary stripe,
sides of head and neck, and lower parts generally, deep buff
vellow, the sides of the head marked with a distinct narrow
stripe of dark brown."
In the "Zoological Society's Vertebrate List," Q. cyanoptera
is given the trivial name of " Blue-winged Teal," a title that
is now universally applied to Q. discors. Between 1884 and 1893
five specimens were received at the Gardens, but no young
appear to have been bred.

Before these lines appear, some of our members will have
had the privilege of seeing the series of water-colour studies,
some thirty in number, of British Birds, by George E. Lodge,
that is being exhibited at the Rembrandt Gallery in Vigo Street,
London, W.
To those who have received invitations but who have not
yet gone, I should give the advice " go," especially if they have
been to the Royal Academy to look at such pictures of birds as
are to be seen there, and wish, as a relief, to see works by an
artist who is also an observer.
Mr. Lodge is probably more an outdoor student, and less
a museum worker, than anyone I know, who professes to be a

bird-artist, and as might be supposed, liis work reflects Nature in
a less conventional or artificial way than that of many artists who
have received Academy or art school trainings, and especially is
he superior to those whose work is to provide scientific cabinet
Ornithologists with the transcripts that we know all too well in
orthodox works. Not that this is a personal or artistic virtue of
his, for the poor "scientific artist" (if such a being can be) as
the writer knows to his cost, has to " render unto Caesar," while
Mr. Lodge goes his own way and is his own master.
As he recently remarked to me " One gets tired of drawing
birds in profile, and eliminating the light and shade so as to
show the local colour all over."
That he goes his own wa\&amp;apos; in the matter of attitude is
shown by the remark made to me by an old pupil of Wolf's--
" You see a drawing of a bird by Lodge, in a peculiar attitude
and you think it is incorrect, but by and by, as you watch, you
see the bird in just the attitude Lodge has drawn it in." Such a
remark applies to the study of the Grouse crowing--the attitude
is one in which I have seen a cock Pheasant when giving his
violent cry or alarm call, although I have not had the opportunity
of seeing a Grouse in that exact position.
Mr. Lodge's early years were largely spent in engraving
drawings for such periodicals as the once charming "English
Illustrated Magazine" and such books as Lord Lilford's " Birds
of Northamptonshire," and from doing much black-and-white
work, his earlier studies were apt to be deficient in colour, but
the time has come when he has freed himself from the restraint
unconsciously exerted by the black-and-white work, and can
allow himself to indulge in colour freely and to place it on the
sound artistic basis of tone.
Some of us, who know Mr. Lodge's work principally by
the reproductions in black and white, or monochrone, will look
with pleasure at the soft and airy rendering of some of his skies
and water subjects, and especially will that be the case with the
subject of the Heron, flapping leisurely across a hazy sky, with
the sun just visible through the mists ; while an example of soft
rendering of the reflected clouds is found in one of the studies of
a Mallard. A charming water subject is that of a flock of Long-
tailed Ducks, seen as they might be on a winter's day, when the

sun is trying to break through the mist or slight fog of a
December's afternoon. This study is not a large one and the
birds themselves appear quite small in it. but to my eyes, the
charm of it is the ripple left by the receding birds, on the other-
wise smooth water. Another water subject, with the water in
movement amongst reed beds, shows a flock of Wild Duck
coming down, as we may suppose, on to a broad in Norfolk, with
a reed bed as real in appearance as need be wished. Still another
shows a pair of Wigeon, with the male bird rolling over on the
water scratching its head : the drawing of the duck is compar-
atively commonplace, but the pose and drawing of the drake
show a courage not often met with amongst bird artists.
That Mr. Lodge can draw the Passerine birds which are
most familiar to people who keep birds in captivity, is evinced
by the studies here shown and although the two, of Magpie and
Jay respectively, are not up to the general standard of these
works, the one of the Snow Bunting is one of the best, if not the
best, drawings of a Passerine bird I have ever seen. It has not
the peculiar interest of the painting of the Sedge Warblers at
Wicken Fen exhibited at his last London exhibition, which had
the distinction of being the best and most life-like study of Warb-
lers I have seen, but it is remarkably faithful and characteristic,,
and as I have kept Snow Buntings, I can speak with confidence.
The Wren and the Robin are both drawn with fidelity and
softness and the same might be said of the study of Goldfinches.
The one Passerine subject I did not like, was that of the Bearded
Tits, nor did I like the study of the Snipe in the stream amongst
the snow, which was rather harsh and unpleasant.
But though Grouse, Gulls, Ducks, Herons and Pheasants
may all be drawn well and faithfully, it is amongst the studies of
birds of prey that we find Mr. Lodge at his best. There are not
so many of them this year as hitherto; but the knowledge is
still shown as of yore and the two studies of Peregrines, the one
of a Merlin, another of an Iceland Falcon and last, but far from
least, the exceptionally good study of a Kite, are alone worth a
visit that few, if any, of our members would regret making.
To those who are thinking of visiting this fine collection I
may mention that it will be on view until June 30th.

Polypledron chinquis.
By R. I. Pocock, F.R.S.
In "The Descent of Man," pp. 396-400 of ed. 2, 1883, may
be found a longish account, illustrated by two woodcuts, of the
courtship-display of the males of the Peacock-pheasant and
Argus Pheasant. To this are added, by way of comparison and
contrast, brief allusions to the display of the Peacock and
Tragopan. On information supplied to him by the elder Bartlett,
Darwiu wrote of the Peacock-pheasant (. Polypledron ) as follows : --
" The tail and wing-feathers of this bird are ornamented with
beautiful ocelli, like those 011 the Peacock's train. Now when
the Peacock displays himself, he expands and erects his tail
transversely to his body, for he stands in front of the female,
and has to show off, at the same time, his rich bine throat and
breast. But the breast of the Polypledroit is obscurely coloured,
and the ocelli are not confined to the tail-feathers. Consequently
the Polypledron does not stand in front of the female ; but he
erects and expands his tail-feathers a little obliquely, lowering
the expanded wing on the same side, and raising that on the
opposite side.The male Tragopan Pheasant acts in
nearly the same manner, for he raises the feathers of the body,
though not the wing itself, on the side which is opposite to
[turned away from] the female, and which would otherwise be
concealed, so that nearly all the beautifully-spotted feathers are
exhibited at the same time." Then follows the description of
the display of the Argus Pheasant, which is referred to as " a
much more remarkable case " ; but possibly because the author
was not specially dealing with display from the comparative
point of view, he made no comparison between the method
employed by the Argus Pheasant and the method employed by
the other game-birds he mentioned ; and the impression remains
that the display of the Argus Pheasant is unique in its entire
want of resemblance to that of any other species of the group.
As will appear in the sequel, Darwin would probably have
written otherwise than he did on this subject if the information
he had received as to the display of the Peacock-pheasant had
been complete; for he would have been the first to appreciate

Mr. R. I. Pocock,
the interest of the fact that the display of the Argus Pheasant is
merely an exaggeration of the display of the Peacock-pheasant,
and that the display of the latter is joined by intermediate links
to that of ordinary Pheasants on the one hand, and of Peacocks
and Turkeys on the other.
Darwin, it will be noticed, contrasted the display of the
Peacock-pheasant with that of the Peacock, and likened it to that
of the Tragopan. He pointed out, however, that the Tragopan
differs from the Peacock-pheasant in not opening its wings; but
he made no allusion to the fact that the Peacock's wings are
partially spread in display. Thus the difference between these
two birds is not quite so great as might be inferred from the
contrast drawn between them. Judging nevertheless from his
account, the Peacock-pheasant in its manner of self-exhibition
falls into the same category of game-birds as the true Pheasants
which practise what T. W. Wood * called the ' lateral ' or ' one-
sided ' method--that is to say they present one side of the head,
body and tail to the hen, stretch the neck downwards or forwards,
raise the off shoulder and further side of the back and spread the
feathers of the tail in a vertical plane, to a greater or less extent,
in such a way as to convey the impression of attempting to show
at one moment the greatest possible expanse of colour compatible
with the attitude assumed. The wings, however, are kept closed
or the near one may be lowered to a small extent. More than
forty years ago, T. W. Wood described this method in the Com-
mon and Japanese Pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus and versicolor )
and in the Gold Pheasant {Chrysolophus pieties) ; there is a
coloured plate of it as exhibited by the Common Pheasant in
Mr. J. G. Millais's Natural History of British Game Birds, facing
p. 86; and one showing the very similar pose of the Amherst
Pheasant ( Chrysolophus amherstice) may be seen in Mr. Pycraft's
recent book "A History of Birds." I have myself watched it in
these species, as well as in other kinds of Phasianus, in Swinhoe's
Kalij {Gennceus swinhoii), and in the Satyr Tragopan ( Tragopait
or Ceriornis satyra). The phenomenon, indeed, must be familiar
to all who have kept pheasants of diverse sorts in captivity.
There are, as might be expected, detailed differences in the
" The Student," 1870, p. 115, cited by Darwin. I have not seen this periodical.

display both with respect to completeness and according to the
species or genus of the performer. The male of Chrysolophus,
for example, races round the female in circles and rattles his
tail-feathers when he conies to a standstill in front of her. I
have not seen this behaviour in the males of Phasia?ius or of
Tragopan which stalk in a stately manner in front of the hen.
Possibly, however, it has been mv misfortune to observe only
the partial display of these two genera. At all events I am not
in a position to affirm that their sedate strut does not lapse at
times into the headlong run of the Amherst and Gold. These
two pheasants never, I believe, spread the tail to any great extent.
Nor have I seen it widely spread in any species of the genera
above mentioned, with the exception of a Mongolian Pheasant
(. Ph. mongolicus&amp;apos;), which on one occasion was noticed to extend
the tail like a fan and twist it round vertically, presenting its
entire upper side to the hen. The Satyr Tragopan, moreover, has
another pose * which I have never seen assumed by any species
of the Silver, Gold or Common Pheasant types. Facing the hen
with the body slightly crouched, the tail on the ground and the
wings partially spread and flapping, he suddenly erects his head
and exposes and inflates the ultramarine and crimson tongue-
shaped gular wattle, or 'bib,' which, except during sexual excite-
ment, is concealed by the feathers of the throat. From the
comparative point of view, this pose, accompanied by inflated
wattles and partially-spread wings, is interestingly reminiscent
of the display of the Turkey; but deviation therefrom is shown
by the downward inclination of the back and the depression of
the tail. At the moment, however, I am not especially concerned
with the display of the Tragopans. It is sufficient for my present
purpose to reiterate that the 'lateral' method of self-exhibition
is in all essential characters the same in the species of Phasianus.

( Ceriornis ) that have come under my notice in the Gardens, f
* See T. W. Wood "Curiosities of Ornithology," pp. 16-18, with coloured plate.
Wood speaks of this as the 'characteristic' display, but I have only seen this bird show off
in the 'lateral ' manner above described. Mr. Angus Macdonald, the Society's Keeper of
Pheasants, however, tells me he has seen the exhibition of the wattles by the cock bird in
the Zoological Gardens.
t The observation of others confirming or modifying this conclusion or extending it
to other species, like Reeves and Elliott&amp;apos;s Pheasants and various kinds of Kalij Pheasants,
of which the Silver is the commonest type, would be both interesting and valuable.

Mr. R. I. Pocock,
Widely different and resembling in all important points that
of the Turkey, as I have already mentioned in this Magazine *
is the display of the Peacock ( Pavo ). In this bird, as in the
Turkey (. Meleagris ), the display is ' frontal,' that is to say the cock
faces the hen with the tail raised and spread fan-wise, the back
inclined more or less upwards, the head and neck withdrawn
against it and the wings partially spread and drooped, but not
strictly speaking exhibited, on each side.
Reverting once more to the Peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron
chinquis), it will be remembered that its method of display as
described to Darwin induced him to regard it as ' lateral,' or what
may be called pheasant-like. I myself, however, have never seen
this bird show off in exactly the manner depicted and described in
" The Descent of Man," except as a preliminary to what must be
regarded as full display. One interesting point I have to record
about the courtship of this species is that the display is made in
two widely different ways, each complete in itself, yet each, unlike
the two methods of the Tragopan, subservient to the exhibition
of the self-same ornamentation. One method is markedly
'lateral.' Nevertheless in the disposition of the wings it differs
widely from the lateral method described in this species by
Bartlett and represented, it is alleged, by T. W. Wood in the
drawing already mentioned, which was possibly taken from
Bartlett's mounted specimen referred to by Darwin. I say
'alleged ' because the drawing in question does not quite suggest
to me lateral display, but rather a preliminary to the frontal
display of this species, to be described later on. The perspective
of the drawing may, however, be inaccurate ; aud since it is
impossible now to settle this point, we must take Darwin's word
for it that the drawing was intended to coincide with the des-
cription. In this drawing both the wings are partially spread,
the one on the side nearest the hen being drooped towards the
ground, and the one on the opposite side raised above the level
of the uptilted back, their primaries being pointed towards the
tail and away from the direction in which the bird is looking. In
the lateral display of this species that has come under my notice
(fig. i), the wing on the side near the hen is scarcely opened at

well in front of the head, which is somewhat retracted and not
thrust forward like the head of ordinary pheasants. Nevertheless,
this display of the Peacock-pheasant recalls in a striking manner
the display of typical pheasants in the lateral presentation, the
folding of the near wing, the uplifting of the back and the circular
run with which the cock courses round the hen. The tail of the
Peacock-pheasant in this display is, like the off-wing, fully spread.

that the plane of its fan-like expanse is vertical, the external
tail-coverts of the off-side overlapping with their tips the back-
wardly inclined tips of the secondaries of the expanded wing.
Thus the fullest possible exhibition is made of the ocelli of the
tail and of one wing. The only other point to be noticed is that
the dusky crest on the crown of the head is turned forwards so
as to overhang the base of the beak in front. This indeed seems
to be its usual position during the entire period of courtship,
irrespective of display. I have never heard the cock make any

sound when showing off in this fashion ; but the display of the
second kind, in my experience far the commoner of the two, is
frequently heralded by a chirping sort of whistle which brings
the hen running to his side as if expecting food.
The attitude of this second and prevalent display is very
remarkable. The cock faces the hen, raises and spreads the tail
and wings, thus bringing the rows of ocelli into full view, and

at the same time tilts up the back until it is quite vertical and in
the same plane as the erect tail, tucks the head and neck back
and down between the bases of the wings and lowers the throat
to the ground so that the legs are entirely concealed from view
in front. In this position the bird looks, not like a bird at all,
but like an irregularly triangular speckly-brown shield adorned
with transversely arcuate bands of ocelliform studs (fig 2).
Thus this display of the Peacock-pheasant is essentially
' frontal ' and dorsal. Apart from certain minor features, like the

uprightness of the pose and the drooping of the forepart of the
body to the ground, it differs from the display of the Peacock and
Turkey merely in the uplifting of the wings so that their orna-
mentation is shown to the best advantage.
There can be no question that the two courtship-attitudes-
just described must be regarded as full display, but I am not sure
that the pose described by Darwin on Bartlett's authority can be
deemed otherwise than as partial. It does not, however, lose in
interest on that account; for if we may trust the accuracy of the
record--and I see no justifiable grounds for disputing it--it is
evident that in the raising and spreading of the two wings and
tail in the same plane, combined with their exhibition from the
lateral aspect, this display is to all intents and purposes inter-
mediate between the full lateral and full frontal methods shown
in Mr. Goodcliild's drawings.
Perhaps, however, the chief interest in the display of the
Peacock-pheasant lies in the circumstance that the habit of
elevating and exposing the upper side of the wings in the frontal
attitude associates this bird closely with the Argus Pheasant. I
am unable indeed to find any fundamental distinction between
the methods of self-exhibition practised by these two species.
The apparent difference depends merely upon a difference in the
size of the wings. Like the Peacock-pheasant the Argus faces
the hen and raises and expands the tail and wings. The wings,
however, are lifted higher and are thrust more forward. The
feathers, which are of extraordinary length, meet in the middle
line over the head in front and over the back behind, forming an
enormous subcircular lineally ocellated shield which conceals
the entire head, body and tail, with the exception of the ends of
the two long tail feathers.* Despite this difference, the attitude of
the Argus in display is in all important respects the same as the
attitude of the frontal display of the Peacock-pheasant; audit is
not difficult to trace, in imagination, the special features con-
tributing to the display of both from the features possessed by a
common ancestral type differing from the Turkey in its method
of self-exhibition only in lifting instead of depressing its spread
* In addition to the above-quoted figure in the 1883 edition of " The Descent of Man,"
there is a good illustration of the display of the Argus Pheasant on p. 430, Vol. IV. of the
Royal Natural History.

wings. Thus from the standpoint of display, the Peacock-
pheasant is highly instructive. He practices, with modifications,
the ' lateral' method characteristic of Pheasants, and the ' frontal'
method exhibited by the Peacock and Turkey, showing how the
one method may have passed into the other. He supplies iu
addition a connecting link between the two stages of ' frontal '
display manifested respectively by the Peacock or Turkey and
the Argus Pheasant.
There is one more point to be noticed. It may be inferred
from Darwin's above-quoted remarks about the Peacock that he
supposed the method of frontal display practised by this bird
was assumed to show off " his rich blue throat and breast," as
well as his erect and expanded tail ; the assumption of the
particular attitude, that is to say, was a habit acquired subse-
quently to the decoration of the areas in question. It may be so.
It must be remembered, however, that the Peacock's 'train' is
composed, not of the tail-feathers, but of the enormously elon-
gated tail-coverts which are uplifted and supported by the fan-
shaped tail spreading beneath them exactly as the tails of the
Argus, Peacock-pheasant and Turkey are spread. Hence it
appears to me probable that the wonderful ' train ' of the Peacock,
a very special development, was originally acquired in a less
perfect form by an ancestor of this bird that had already adopted
the frontal attitude in courtship. In other words the assumption
of the pose was antecedent to the growth of the ' train.' The
same opinion may be held about the coloration of the neck and
throat. That frontal display may be practised quite irrespective
of special coloration of the head and breast is proved by the case
of the Peacock-pheasant. This being so it must not be hastily
assumed that the brilliant blue pervading these parts in the
Peacock is related in a causal sense to the attitude of this bird
in display.
Those who describe the courtship of such birds as the
species constituting the subject-matter of this article usually
write as if unquestioningly accepting the proposition that the
cocks purposely pose in a particular manner to display their
decorated plumes, adopting the attitudes that make the most of
their beauty. My own opinion is that we shall be nearer the

truth if we invert the idea and say that the decorations are
developed on particular areas, because the cocks pose in a par-
ticular manner; the decorations, that is to say, are adapted to
the display. Or to put it tersely, the birds do not display because
they are decorated, but are decorated because they display.
One of the differences between these two opposed concep-
tions is this: the first and prevalent one involves, in the judgment
of many naturalists, purposive action and consciousness of his
own beauty on the part of the cock bird ; the second does not
necessarily imply anything of the kind, the actions of the birds
being interpretable as prompted by instinctive impulses, un-
accompanied by any consciousness of the display of beauty that
results therefrom.
There is, in my opinion, more to be said in favour of the
second view of the matter than will be acceptable to those who
prefer to measure the behaviour of birds by the human standard ;
and I do not flatter myself that the opinion that birds, in the
matter of display, are mere instinct-driven machines will com-
mend itself to the predilections of most of my readers.
THE OVEN BIRD.
Funarius rufus.
Part I.
By J. Lewis Bonhote, M.A.
This bird, which is a native of South America, has long
attracted the attention of ornithologists, as, apart from being very
w&amp;apos;idely distributed, it has a partiality for human dwellings near
which its curious and conspicuous nest is almost invariably
placed. By the kindness of Miss Dorrien Smith, who forwarded
the accompanying photograph to Mr. Astley, we are able to
show the nest in position in its native country. Personally. I
have had no acquaintance with the bird itself, but in the absence
of Mr. Astley abroad, I have looked the matter up and append a
few short notes on its habits when wild. It is a small rufous
bird rather smaller than our Song Thrush and, like that species,
procures most of its food, which consists of larvae, worms and
other insects, on the ground in open places. It apparently pairs

Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote,
for life and most ' estancias ' have a pair of these birds, which,
as it is noil-migratory, remain with them throughout the year.
According to Mr. Gibson, they have no particular song, and their
only cry is a succession of loud short notes accompanied by a
flapping of the wings. It is usually seen alone, but at intervals
during the day, whether in the breeding season or not, the pairs
meet together as though by appointment and indulge for a few
minutes in a duet, the female being as loud and vociferous a
\0x25A0singer as her mate.
The nest, which is almost unique among birds, and always
placed in a very conspicuous position, on a tree, roof of a house,
post, etc., without any attempt at concealment, has always
attracted much attention. It is a very solid mud structure,
weighing as much as eight or nine pounds, and takes months to
build. It is commenced soon after the moult in the late autumn,
and is built at intervals, whenever the weather is mild and wet
during the winter. Both sexes build. A piece of hair, straw or
small rootlet is taken to the edge of a puddle, covered with mud
and rolled into a small pellet, which is then conveyed to the
chosen site. After the foundation has been made, the walls are
built up, leaving the side facing the house or road open till the
last, and it has been suggested that this is so that the builder
may be able to see any approaching intruder. The open side is
then half walled-in, leaving the rest for the external opening,
which is almost invariably on the right hand side. The builders
then proceed to put in the centre or partition wall, which is
carried right to the back of the nest, leaving only an opening
just large enough for the entrance of the bird, which is thus
easily able to defend its home against intruders. The inner
compartment is lined with a few bents and, in due season,
four pear-shaped white eggs are laid. Incubation is carried on
by both sexes.
Only one brood is reared each season, and although so
\0x25A0solid is the nest that it can bear the weight of a man and last for
several seasons, yet it is never used more than once and a new
nest is re-commenced every winter.
Round so domestic a bird many tales and fables have
naturally arisen, one being that it is extremely pious and never

builds on Sunday. In confirmation of this Hudson tells a good
story, which was told him by an old ranch keeper.
It appears that one of a pair died in the nest, which was
just completed. The surviving bird, after waiting for a short
time, went away, and in a few days returned with another mate.
This pair promptly began nest-building, but their first task was
to hermetically seal up the door of the old nest, after which they
proceeded to build a new one on the top.

run swiftly on the ground. They perform a sort of goose step,
each foot is raised and poised for half a second, which gives them
an air of swagger.
Their call is very penetrating and shrill ; it reminds me of
something--is it of the Wryneck? if so, it is a more rapid utter-
ance. I had four of these birds, but all died before long, except
one, which I kept for over two years.
It was my ambition to see the curious oven nest of mud
built, but like other ambitious, it came to nought! Oven Birds
require artificial heat in cold weather, but my last bird, although
he had a warmed house to go into, used to often be out in the
outside run during the daytime in winter.
I had no time to attend very particularly to my birds, but
as I have said, I believe they need a supply of live insect food,
and plenty of space in which to run about, they are not cage
birds.

The collection has been enriched by the acquisition of a
pair of young Australian Bee-eaters (/Merops ornatus), the first
ever received of this elegant species ; in fact the only other Bee-
eater that has been represented in the collection is the European
species ( M . apiaster). Another species which has been added to
the list is the Three-coloured Parrot-finch (Erythrura trichroa ),
of which a pair has been acquired by exchange.
An extremely rare Owl from West Africa, which has only
once previously been exhibited, is Bouvier's Owl (Scotopelia
bouvieri), a young example of which, still retaining its nestling
down, has been received. It is closely related to (but considerably
smaller than) Pel&amp;apos;s Owl (S. peli ), a specimen of which has been
living in the collection for some time.
A very nice collection has been received as a present from
Mr. Hugo Pam at Caraccas, Venezuela, to whom the Zoological
Society is indebted for a number of rare birds. It consists of

Magpie Tanager (Cissopsis leveriana ), a Golden-crowned Hang-
nest (.Icterus auricap it Ins&amp;apos;), a Baltimore Hangnest (/. baltimore),
and four Black-cheeked Cardinals (Paroaria nigrigenis).
From Tasmania we have just received a number of the rare
Fire-tailed Finches (Zonceginthus bellus).
Tiie most interesting event during the month has been the
hatching of a young Stork in the large Gull's aviary. One of
the parent birds being pinioned, the nest was built on the ground
and consisted of a pile of sticks and rubbish some three feet in
height. Four eggs were laid, but one disappeared (probably the
Black-backed Gulls ate it) the three remaining ones being in-
cubated for twenty-eight days, when one hatched, the other two
proving unfertile. The chick was fed by the parents, who re-
gurgitated food from the crop, placing it in the nest where it
was greedily picked up by the nestling. In the process, how-
ever, it apparently picked up a quantity of the nest material with
the food, for it was found dead on the eleventh day, and a post
mortem examination revealed a quantity of dried grass in its
stomach.
So far we have six young ducks, namely three Andaman
Teal, two Summer Ducks and one New Zealand Sheldrake.

HECK'S LONG-TAILED GRASSFINCH.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99947768" page_id="9404238"  page_num="242" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I n the last number of the Avicultural Magazine , Mr. Mathews
appears to doubt the validity of Poephila hecki, Heinroth, and proposes
that the name shall be regarded as a synonym of P. acuticaucia.
There is however no doubt in my mind, and I think other aviculturists
will agree with me, that there are two distinct forms of the Long-tailed
Grassfinch, one with waxy yellow bill and the other, slightly smaller, with
bright orange-red bill. There was a large importation of the lat f er form in
1902 or thereabouts, and I think some had come over earlier than this,
while those that have arrived in this country since have mostly, if not all,
been of the typical yellow-billed form.
The difference in the two forms was first noticed by Dr. Heinroth of
Berlin (Otnith. Monatsb , Jahr. VIII., p. 22, 1900.), and he described the red-
billed form as Poephila hecki. Later Mr. North noticed the same difference
in Sydney, and not knowing that Heinroth had already described this form,
named it P. aurautiirostris (Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W., XXVII., p. 207. 1902);
while about the same time several of us in this country noticed how these
birds differed.
I have before me skins of both P. acuticauda and P. hecki , and although
the red bills of the latter have considerably faded, the difference in the two
forms is readily seen.
I maintain that after the testimony of two such good observers as
Heinroth and North, who examined the living birds, Mr. Mathews should
not sweep their opinions aside on the strength of there being no difference
in the dried skins when the point of difference is the colour of the bill,
which is known to fade after death. D. Seth-SmiTH.

I11 this instructive little book Mr. Bentley Beetkam tells
11s in a clear and concise manner the best ways of portraying
wild birds by means of the camera. As is well known, Mr.
Beetham is a most successful bird-photographer, and his previous
book "Home Rife of the Spoonbill " contains some of if not the
best photographs of wild birds we have ever seen. Such being
the case, the volume before us, though containing little that is
absolutely new to bird-photographers, will be welcomed by all
interested in this most fascinating pastime--we had almost
written sport, for such it undoubtedly is, as all those, who, like
the writer, have spent hours hidden within a few feet of some
of our shyest birds for the purpose of photographing them will
readily agree.
Mr. Beetham discusses at moderate length the necessary
apparatus and the different means of obtaining satisfactory pic-
tures. Each subject is treated of in a separate chapter ; thus we
have one on " Nest Photography"--Photographing young birds--
Photography by the stalking method and by the concealment
method, etc., etc. Under the treatment of the last named (p.
72) the author describes, though he does not recommend, the
" umbrella hide." In this we are not quite in agreement with
him, for the " umbrella " is easily and quickly put up, and can
be worked by the operator alone. The hide described by Mr.
Beetham seems rather clumsy and slow to put in position. The
quicker the operator can erect and enter his hide the better, in
our opinion. We also find from experience that a"hide,"pro-

concealed camera, strange though it may seem (p. 61).
Mr, Beetham has an abundance of patience, as can be seen
by a perusal of his interesting book, and this is a sine qua non
for the would-be successful bird - photographer. The photo-
graphic plates, illustrating the results obtainable by the different
methods described, are admirable, though not quite up to the
standard of those published in his earlier works.
The book is well and clearly printed, and is of a handy
size for use in the field. For the beginner it contains a mass of
information, and the practised bird-photographer will doubtless
find many useful ''tips" in this volume which we heartily re-
commend.
ORNAMENTAL WATERFOWL. *
Mr. Wormald has written a short, but very practicable,
pamphlet on the management of the different species of Wild
Fowl most often seen on ornamental waters.
Details of food, the best size for enclosures and the rearing
of the young are very fully given and should enable the most
inexperienced to keep these birds with success. Most people,
who make a speciality of any particular group of live stock, have
usually their own particular methods which they have learnt
from experience, and although Mr. Wormald's methods are in
the main those we should recommend, we cannot agree in keep-
ing young ducklings away from water as he suggests. In their
natural state ducklings take to the water within a few hours of
hatching and we have always had the best results from following
Nature in this respect; unless however they have free access to
water from the first, they must not be allowed a swim till at least
a month old, when the feathers are beginning to grow.
The sea ducks and diving ducks are dealt with by Mr.
St. Quintin, than whom we have no greater authority on such
matters. The book is illustrated by twenty-two black and white
plates by Mr. Wormald, which will assist the beginner in re-
cognising the various species.

We have received the Annual Report of the Royal Zoo-
logical Society of Ireland by which we are glad to note that the
past year has been in all respects quite up to the average.
During the year a fine new range of Eagle and Bird of Prey
aviaries has been constructed, and the illustration given shows
a fine large dome-shaped flight, apparently very similar in
structure and design to a portion of the recently-erected Bird
of Prey aviaries in the London Gardens.
The stock of birds is fairly representative, but of certain
large groups, such as the Waders and Gulls, only one or two
species are at present in the collection. These Gardens, how-
ever, are chiefly renowned for their Mammals, and especially the
large Carnivores, and as their finances are limited, the Council
is undoubtedly wise in keeping a small number well rather than
a large number indifferently. The total stock on January 1st
was 931, an increase of about 60 as compared with the previous
year. Full details are given of the deaths, arrivals and breeding
results of the year, and the report is illustrated with many photo-
graphs and drawings.
OBITUARY.
THE LATE MR. HENRY SCHERREN.
It is with great regret that we have to announce the death
of our member Mr. H. Scherren, which occurred on 25th April
after a long illness, at his house at Harringay.
Mr. Scherren commenced his journalistic career on the
Editorial staff at Messrs. Cassell &amp; Co., where he compiled the
Encyclopaedic Dictionary. Besides many contributions to the
Scientific Proceedings, Mr. Scherren wrote the history of the
Zoological Society of London, which was published in 1905, and
this was possibly his greatest piece of work, though several
other books of importance were written by him before that date.
Perhaps Mr. Scherren was best known to most of our
members for his notices of scientific meetings and Natural
history notes contributed to the Times , Standard and Field news-

papers, all of which notes were famed for their extreme accuracy.
In 1889, Mr. Scherren was elected a Fellow of the Zoological
Society of London and a member of the British Ornithologists'
Union and Club nine years later, while in 1902 he joined the
Avicultural Society ; and as an acknowledgment of his services
to Continental institutions, he was in 1908 elected a correspond-
ing member of the Royal Zoological Society of Amsterdam.
This was a well-earned distinction, for Scherren's careful and
most interesting accounts of Continental Zoological Institutions,
especially Zoological Gardens--published from time to time in
the columns of the Field --were of inestimable value.
Of his personal worth it is impossible to speak but in
terms of praise, his kindly and genial disposition endeared him
to all who knew him, and his death causes a gap that will not
be easily filled.
PRACTICAL BIRD-KEEPING.
IV. PARRAKEETS.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
(Concluded from page 224A
It is of course impossible in the space at my disposal to
deal with anything like all of the Parrakeets that the enthusiastic
student of these birds will have an opportunity of possessing,
providing he keeps touch with the dealers' importations and
private advertisements, so it will be best to deal briefly with the
most popular.
The Budgerigar ( Alelopsittacus undulatus) is the most
popular of all the Parrakeets, and it well deserves its fame, for it
possesses just those qualities which the aviculturist most desires,
namely, beauty, vivacity, hardiness and prolificacy. The only
quality it does not possess, and one which the more experienced
aviculturist looks for, is rarity. When the first of these little
Parrakeets were brought to this country, more than half-a-century
ago, they naturally commanded a very high price ; now, however,
about six shillings will secure a good pair.
In one of the compartments of the aviary described, about
half-a-dozen pairs of Budgerigars could be kept. For food they

require only canary seed, and no artificial warmth is necessary in
the winter. It is desirable to separate the sexes from October to
the beginning of April, as otherwise they will breed practically
the whole year round, and the hens will be liable to die of egg-
binding during the cold weather. Moreover, the nests get damp
in the winter and the young suffer.
It is advisable to supply two nest-boxes for each pair of
birds so that there may be a choice of sites and quarrelling
will be avoided.
The Budgerigar is almost too well known to need any
description. It is mostly bright green with black wavy cross-
bars over the back. A yellow face and blue tail. The cock has
a bright blue cere over the beak ; in the hen this is brown, while
in the immature bird it is dull bluish in both sexes.
There is a common variety of the Budgerigar, which has
been produced by selection, which is almost entirely yellow, the
dark pigment having disappeared from the plumage. Yellow
Budgerigars are now so common that the price is little higher
than that asked for the normal bird.
An extremely rare and beautiful variety is the Blue
Budgerigar. It was known some twenty-five or thirty years
ago, but completely disappeared until Mons. Pauwels, a well-
known Belgian aviculturist, exhibited a pair in Tondon in 1910.
In this variety the yellow pigment is absent, the bird being of a
most beautiful blue, with a pure white face and black bars over
the back.
The Cockatiee or Cockatoo Parrakeet (Calopsittacus
novce-hollanditz), of Australia, is another popular favourite, almost
as well-known as the Budgerigar, and equally hardy. It is about
the size of a Thrush but with a longer tail. The male is dark-
grey with a yellow face and crest, a white patch on the wing-
coverts and a brick-red patch on the cheeks. The hen is quite
different in colour, being brownish, with the underside of the
tail barred with yellow.
One pair of Cockatiels can be kept in the same compart-
ment as Budgerigars, with which they will agree, although they
would disagree with others of their own species or parrakeets of
about the same size. They are very free breeders, laying from

four to six white eggs to a clutch, and producing three or four
broods in a season. Both sexes share in incubation, the cock
sitting by day and the hen at night, and incubation is commenced
witli the first egg.
Canary, hemp and oats are the only seeds required,
although these, and, in fact, all parrakeets require green foot!.
The Broad-tailed Parrakeets ( Platycercus ), of Austra-
lia, are mostly quite hardy, brightly-coloured and very desirable
birds for an aviary. They require the same food as that recom-
mended for Cockatiels. Each pair should have a compartment
of an aviary to themselves, and if provided with suitable nesting
accommodation and left undisturbed, will probably breed. The
following species belonging to this group may be mentioned.
The Rosella (P. eximius ), Pennant's Parkakeet (P. el eg an s).
the Mealy Rosella (P. pallidiceps ), the Stanley Parrakeet
( P. icterotis), Brown's Parrakeet ( P. browni ).
The genus Psephotus contains some of the most beautiful
and desirable of the Australian Parrakeets. The best-known
being the Red-rump (P. heematonotus), a hardy and free-breeding
species. The Many-coloured Parrakeet (P. multicolor ) is
fairly hardy, and has been bred by several aviculturists. While
of the rarer species there are the very distinct Blue-bonnet, of
which there are two races (P. xanthorrhous and P. hcematorrhous),
the Beautiful (P. pulcherrimtis), the Golden - shouldered
( P. chrysopterygius) and the recently-described Hooded (P.
cucullatus ), the three last mentioned being extremely rare and
rather delicate.
There are many other desirable seed-eating Parrakeets in
Australia, such as the King ( Aprosmiclus cyanopygius) and
Crimson-wing (Ptistes erythropterus), the Alexandra ( Spat hop-
terns alexandrcs) and Barraband&amp;apos;s ( Polytelis barrabandi ), as well
as the beautiful Grass Parrakeets of the genus Neophema.
South Ameiica contains a large group of Parrakeets known
as Connies, most of which are comparatively hardy and easily
kept on a simple seed diet and green food. They are not so
popular as the Australian Parrakeets, nor, as a rule, are they
such free breeders.

The Patagonian Conure is a large bird of a dull greenish
colour relieved by yellow and blue. The Black-headed and Red-
headed Conures (C. nenday and C. rubrolarvatus ) are bright
green birds with characteristic markings on the head. The
Cactus and Brown-throated (C. cactorum and C. aeruginosas)
are smaller, tame and confiding little birds, which make charming
cage pets ; while several small and pretty species are contained
in the genus Pyrrhura , the best known being the White-eared
Conure ( P. leucotis).
To the same sub-family belong the Grey-breasted or
Quaker Parrakeet, a parrot distinguished from all others by
its habit of constructing a large domed nest of twigs ; the
Lineolated Parrakeet ( Bolborhynclms Ihicolatus), the Pas-
serine Parrakeet ( Psittacula passerina), and the Tovi and
other species of the genus Brotogerys.
A large number of species are contained in the genus
Palceornis, which is spread over a part of Africa, India, Burma,
the Malay Peninsula and adjacent islands. The best known
species are the Indian Ring-necked Parrakeet (P. iorquatus&amp;apos;),
the Alexandrine ( P. eupatrid), of which there are several races,
and the Banded Parrakeet ( P. fasciata). The first of these
has been bred in captivity on several occasions, but, as a rule,
these Parrakeets are kept merely as cage-birds, in which state
they sometimes make quite good talkers.
Confined entirely to the African Continent and Madagascar
is the small group of true Lovebirds ( Agapornis ), all of which
have short rounded tails. The chief peculiarity of the group is
that they make their nest by lining the hollow of a tree-trunk or
limb with some material such as dry grass or the soft green bark
of trees. The three well-known species are the Red-faced (A.
pullaria ) from West Africa, the Rosy-FACED ( A. roseicollis ) of
South Africa, and the Grey-headed ( A. cana ) from Madagascar;
while the recently-discovered Black-cheeked Lovebird (A .
nigrigenis ) from Rhodesia, is, at the moment, perhaps the com-
monest kind in captivity, being an extremely free - breeding
species.
There still remains to be mentioned the large family of
honey-eating Parrakeets which inhabit Australasia and are

known as the Lorikeets. They are a restless active group,
mostly clad in brilliant colours. Their natural food consists
of the sweet nectar and pollen of flowers, principally that of
the various species of Eucalyptus. But they also partake largely
of fruit, and are in consequence a great trial to colonial fruit-
growers. In captivity they are not, as a rule, difficult subjects.
They should be fed upon sweetened milk-sop, which is made by
pouring boiling milk upon plain biscuit and sweetening with
cane sugar. Ripe fruit in season is also essential. Some species
are fairly hard} 7 , but in the writer's opinion it is advisable to
allow them to have access to a warmed compartment in cold
weather.
Lorikeets are not very free breeders in captivity, but
several species have reared young. For a nest the ordinary
parrakeet nest-box as described above is all that they require.
Swainson's or the Blue-Mountain Lorikeet ( Tricho -
gloss?is nonce-hollandice) is the best-known species, and makes a
delightful aviary bird, brilliantly clad in green, red, blue and
yellow. It is a common species in the Eastern parts of Australia.
The Red - collared Lorikeet (T. rubiitorques) is the
north-western form of the last-mentioned, while the Ornate
Lorikeet (71 ornatus) comes from Celebes.
The closely-allied genus Psilleuteles, which is doubtfully
distinct from Trickogloss?is, contains birds which differ chiefly in
the absence of any red colouring in their plumage, being chiefly
green and yellow. The Scaly-breasted Lorikeet (T 3 . chloro-
lepidotes) inhabiting the South-east of Australia is a well-known
member of this genus. Another denizon of the same region,
but one rarely imported on account of its reputed delicacy when
first captured, is the Musky Lorikeet (Glossopsiilacus concinnus)
a charming bird that is not difficult to keep under proper treat-
ment.
In the foregoing very brief sketch of a most delightful
group of birds it has only been possible to mention the mere
names of a few of the species that can be kept in this country.
For a more complete account of these birds I would refer the
reader to my book entitled Parrakeets, which deals exhaustively
with the imported species.

WINTERING BIRDS IN OUTDOOR AVIARIES.

Mr. H. L. Sich asks us to say that the birds mentioned in his letter
in the last number of our magazine (p. 224) weie not turned out of doors for
the first time that year, nor were they newly-imported birds. They were
taken from one aviary, where they had spent the summer, and turned out
into the one which he described in his letter, and which had been especially
built for a winter aviary.
Sir, --Your readers may be interested in my experiences of an out-
door aviary. I have it in a corner with a very high wall on the north and
west side, and tall, thick shrubs growing against the aviary on the east.
There is a lean-to shelter against the north wall, in which there are plenty
of perches high up, also cocoa-nuts and boxes of all sizes and descriptions
hung on the walls in which hay is put, and the birds sleep or nest in them
as the}- please. I11 this bedroom I have a stove with patent fuel burning all
night in winter and on the coldest
days; it has a pipe through the
wall into the open to let out any
o, bad gas fumes. The door, which
r is against the west wall, has the top
on hinges and can be dropped
according to the weather, but there
is always about twelve inches that
cannot be closed; in summer of
course the door is kept wide open.
The outside flight is a good
size, and in it there are two Retin-
ospora shrubs growing, and tall
tree trunks with their branches
left on but cut short, and to the
top of these are fastened fresh
^ branches of Box, in which the birds
^ love to hop about, and the Weaver
? weaves his wonderful work. There
are also perches along and across
the top and a variety of boxes for
the birds to build in hung about;
ivy grows up the west wall, a hunt-
ing-ground for insects. The seed-
boxes hang inside the shelter and a
saucer of water also, but the larger
saucers for their baths are outside.

I have kept through several winters: an Indigo Finch, Cutthroats,
Diamond Finches, Pekin Robins, Weavers, Zebra Finches (who constantly
add to their numbers), Orange Breasts, Orange - cheeked Waxbills,
Avadavats, Firefiuclies, Diamond Doves, etc. My trouble is that the Pekin
Robins have each hatched three clutches of eggs these last two summers,
and will not or cannot rear them ; and the Diamond Finches build and lay
eggs for ever, but do not even hatch.
I enclose a rough plan of my aviary in case you care to make any
use of it. Adelaide Dawnay.
Sir,-- Seeing your appeal for accounts from members of the results
obtained from wintering birds out of doors, I send the following notes.
I have two small aviaries, each consisting of a glazed and boarded
shelter, a roofed flight and open flight. One aviary has the glazed shelter
heated with pipes, the other has no heat at all.
In the unheated aviary I have kept the following birds in perfect
health : -Barbary Doves (the cock aged 23 years this spring), a Barbarv
Partridge, Bullfinches, Green Glossy Starling, Pekin Robins, cock Indigo
Buntings, a cock St. Helena Seedeater and a cock Black-faced Yellow
Weaver. I am not sure to which species the last mentioned bird belongs.
When in colour he is bright golden yellow, beak and wings greenish yellow,
face, bill and throat jet black, forehead ruddy chestnut, irides scarlet.
Rather heavily built and about the size of a Greenfinch. There has not
been a death in this aviary for over two years.
The other aviary has the compartment where the birds sleep heated
during the winter, and is tenanted by a Hoopoe, a pair of Diamond Doves
and a very aged Orange Bishop. The Hoopoe has lived there two years.
A cock Red Gouldian Finch and a cock Hooded Siskin also wintered there
successfully.
These aviaries have tiled and felted roofs and are match-boarded
throughout, with tiled floors except in the flights, which are partly turfed
and partly sanded. They face South and West, and are sheltered by other
buildings from the North and East. That they are warm and snug is shown
by the fact that even in the unheated part water does not freeze when less
than 7 0 of frost is registered in the open. I do not find the birds care to
remain in the heated part during the day, unless snow be falling, they
generally remain in the open flight and only come in to feed and roost.
With the pipes on I can keep a minimum of 40 to 45 degrees.
E. F. Chawner.

By Mrs. Ella M.&amp;apos; Innes.
(Communicated b^ D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.)
In the Emu for October, 1910, appeared a photograph by
Mr. Cornwall of a number of wild Lorikeets (Trichoglossus novtz-
hollandice) coming to a table to be fed upon syrup by a lady who
had tamed them at her home in Mackay, Queensland. These
Lorikeets have always been great favourites of mine, and the
photograph-and short noth accompanying it interested me so
much that I wrote to Mrs. Innes, the tamer of the birds, and
asked her to be kind enough to supply me with fuller particulars.
I11 reply to my letter she most kindly sent me the excellent
photographs here reproduced, together with the following very
interesting letter.
Dear Sir,--Y our letter of 19th Nov. reached me just as I
was leaving home 011 a visit, so I laid it aside to answer when
I could give leisure to it.
I enclose one or two of my own photos of my birds. They
do not object to my camera in the very slightest, even at close
quarters. I believe my pets are unique in being so thoroughly
tamed, yet left in their free state. When we came to this
country (seventeen years ago), while clearing land for culti-
vation my husband got two young birds from a fallen tree.
One was a Blue Mountain Parrot and one a Green Leak or fish-
scale Parroquet. He brought them home to me, I reared them
and petted them so that we became very fond of them and they
of 11s. They were devoted to me. If I did not appear at the
breakfast table they very soon came round to my bedroom.

Mrs. Ella. M. Innes,
They kissed me and petted me. They nestled at my neck and
used to go to sleep there. Daintier and more affectionate little
pets one could not have. If I mourned they mourned with me ;
if I was inclined for fun they were as eager for a game as a
kitten. They never missed our meal hours, although free to
go where they wished. We often used to try and dodge them,
taking afternoon tea in different rooms, but they always found
out. It was very quaint to see the two looking for us. "Where
are you?" "where are you?" they would call, till at last we
were discovered. After three years one of them met with an
accident and died; the other lived just two weeks longer, it
literally died of a broken heart. It used to go about calling
"Where are you?" "Where are you, my sweet?" but no
answering call came. It scarcely left my shoulder during the
day, and at night it was so lonely in its cage that I was really
glad when it also died one morning in my hand. After that
I vowed I would never make such pets of any animal.
However, one day, a little bundle of fluff, and eyes and
beak was brought to me. and I, of course, took it and reared it
also. It was a jolly little fellow, and used to have great fun
with the cats and dogs. One big cat especially loved a game.
He would lie down on his back and the bird would take a
header into the soft fur, and the fun used to be very great as
they rolled over and over. The cat would play for a long
time with it. How often have I wished I had had a camera in
those days of fun and frolic. After I had this one a year,
mates came round, and my little fellow could not make up his
mind which he would have. He treated all alike, but at last
he decided, and then he hunted all the other little flirts most
unmercifully. To this favoured one he kept true year after
year. They were always together and brought many families
to my care. Now I have so many that I cannot say if he is
still true to his first love. We had some very wet weather
after he chose his mate, and every evening they had a few
words, rather heated at times, over the camp for the night.
Jenny wanted to go to the trees, but Joey preferred the comfort
of his snug cage. Very often his word was law 7 , and Jenny
very shyly dropped into the cage, which was never closed all

day but only during night, as a precaution against wild cats
and snakes.
My family has increased very rapidly ; uncles and aunts,
and every possible relative soon flocked to my table. Seeing
no fear in my own birds they soon got as tame ; the pictures
show how tame they are. None now sleep in the cage, all
sleep in the hollow trees around, but by daylight they clamour
for breakfast. They are fond of taking out my hair pins as
you will see by the photos.
When I went to town last week there was a girl 011 the
coach behind me. I noticed that she had a tin biscuit box on
her knee with holes cut in it. I asked her what she had, and
on hearing that it was a bird, I said I hoped it was not one of
my parrots. I gave my usual call and immediately the answer
came from the tin, and a little eye looked out at a hole. I put
my finger in and the little spongy tongue licked it all over.
The girl said she had got it feeding on a lantana bush with
others and it had allowed her to catch it. She would not give
it up and I had no legal right to it. She lives a mile-and-a-
lialf from my home. We live about twenty miles from Mackay,
and all the way, every time I spoke to the driver or to the
girl the little voice answered me from the tin. I have asked
some one in town to try and buy it back for me from the person
to whom the girl gave it. I hope I may get it, I cannot stand
my little free pets being caged.
This is all a ramble and may be of no interest to you, but
Mr. Cornwall seemed to think that from all he knew of you it
was a letter such as this that would interest. The photos, of
course, are rare. In one you will see the spongy tongue suck-
ing up the sweet liquid from the plate, and you will also notice
the tails sticking out of the cans, showing that the little
gourmands are greedily licking the bottom of the cans. They
are noisy little pets, but very beautiful. Their free life keeps
their plumage in good order. They are great believers in the
daily tub and there are great sceues of revelry in the spouting
round the roof.
I hope I may revisit England some day before long, and I
am sure that I shall want to get inside the Parroquets cage at

the Zoo, that is to say if I see any of my friends there. I have
been away some times for four or five months at a time, and
during that time my pets are not so well looked after, so they
almost stop coming, but I am not home more than two days
before the circular has been sent round the tree tops, and my
little friends wing their w 7 ay from all sides and swarm on me,
some times twenty or thirty hanging on me and squabbling
for the post of honour on my shoulder.
During the fine weather they do not trouble us beyond
coming for food, but in weather such as we are having now (rain
daily) they scarcely leave the verandah. As I write I counted
over seventy on the wire round the verandah. I had to stop
writing to give them food as they gave me no peace, over my
shoulders, drinking the ink, tearing the paper, etc.
If you should visit Australia again my birds will join me
in extending a welcome to our bush home. I am sorry that
the photographer spoilt one of the best negatives by taking the
shadow of my face ; it has made it ghoulish, but it is best of
the birds I am sending. Ella M. Innes.
A FIRST FLIGHT.
By Evelyn Trenow, F.Z.S.
The advent of our Summer visitor the Swallow, reminds
one that the first flight of the young birds is not often seen in its
initial stage, though most of us have seen them wheeling in the
air with nearly as much power as the old birds, but a few hours
after they have first stretched their wings.
I11 the ordinary way the youngsters make their first efforts
towards flying soon after daybreak ; this, in the breeding season,
means about three in the morning--an hour when most people are
in bed--and for that reason their essays are not often witnessed.
Most of us, however, on thinking over our experiences,
will recollect that the nest seen full of young birds overnight has
been empty the next morning, and the late occupants have been
found already following their parents in their skimming flight.
The opportunity I had of observing the first efforts of a
brood of four was due to an accident. One night, about mid-

night it was, a sound of breaking glass--suggesting burglars --
caused me to investigate, with the result that I found the floor of
a conservatory strewn with broken glass and pieces of dried mud.
A nest built under the eaves of the house had become detached
from the wall and had fallen through the glass roof of a con-
servatory ; but no young birds were to be found in the debris.
The first thing to do was to find the birds and, with the
aid of a lantern, I discovered them uninjured in one of the valleys
of the conservatory roof. No doubt they had fluttered when the
nest dropped from under them and had thus escaped damage.
The four youngsters, fledged and ready to fly, were placed
in a cage with the door shut on a window-sill below the site of
the nest, in the expectation that the old bird would feed them as
soon as day broke. The expectation was duly justified. Later
on the door of the cage was opened to facilitate feeding opera-
tions, which were somewhat difficult through the wire-front.
The old bird, however, soon discovered the open door, perched
for a moment in the doorway and then launched itself into the
air with outspread wings towards a fir-tree some thirty feet away.
Having demonstrated the ease of flight it returned to the cage
and persuaded the fledglings one by one to fly from the cage to
the tree, accompanying each on its journey until all were safely
perched in the tree. Within an hour these birds were all fully on
the wing and flying round as though they had never done any-
thing else in their lives.
Considering the inaccessible positions in which Swallows'
nests are generally placed, I have often wondered if the young
are always schoolmastered in their first flight.

I do not know if a few notes about the nesting of a Pied
hen Blackbird and black mate will have any interest for our
members, but send them to you on the chance.
I am sorry I kept no notes about it at the time, so am not
sure about dates. At the end of April, last year, I found my Pied
hen (of whom I sent a note to the Avicnltural Magazine about

Miss E. E. West,
two years ago *) flying about the bird-room with pieces of hav,
or anything she could find, and constantly going to the window
bars and calling and talking to the birds outside, so I concluded
she wanted a mate. I at once did my best to gratify her, by
going to a naturalist and bird dealer in our town of Bromley
and procuring a nice cock Blackbird. I brought the gentleman
home with me, and the next day I fixed up boughs in a
good-sized aviary (not a cage) where the two could be quite
to themselves and very private. I got an old Blackbird's nest
out of the garden and put in hay and stuff for the use of my two,
then put the hen in and let the cock loose in the other part of
the room. He at once joined the hen and they took to each
other and mated without any fuss.
The hen had begun egg-laying before I left home on the
ioth of May, and it was thought she had hatched a bird while I
was away, which was nearly three weeks, but this did not prove
to have been the case. However, they had another try, and on
the 18th of July I felt sure there was a young bird. I noted that
date, but fancy the young one was hatched on the 15th. The
parents were so attentive I had great hopes they might rear their
offspring; of course I did not know if there was one or more.
The gardener and I worked quite hard getting worms for them,
and put some in the room in a box with some mould every day,
and provided also a constant supply of fresh turf. I gave a lot of
mealworms and plenty of the soft food I always use for the
Blackbirds, viz., Neutratiue, ant eggs, and preserved yolk of egg.
The cock bird was a most devoted husband and father, he
never ate a mealworm himself, but carried them all to his wife
and little one. I do not know if he ate any of the garden worms,
but they always disappeared.
Things went on well for just a fortnight, and then disaster
put an end to my hopes. I went into the aviary early as usual
that morning and found a little bluish heap 011 the floor, which
proved to be my young bird. It was beginning to get the wing
feathers, which were quite blue, and it seemed a fine bird for its
age. I had a suspicion that the hen had pulled it out of the nest
and killed it, as it had certainly been knocked about. I had
noticed for some days that the hen had taken to eating the meal-

worms herself, instead of giving them to the young as she had
been doing, and wished I could take her away and let the cock
feed the baby or babies, but I have had no experience in breeding
these birds and did not know what was best to do. There was
only one baby. When I examined the nest later on I found
another egg but it was spoiled.
The Blackbirds had still another try at nesting, quite late
in the season, but I do not think there was even an egg laid. I
much wanted to see if the young would be all black or develope
white feathers like the mother.
As soon as the weather turned cold in November the hen
drove away the cock and would not let the poor thing feed or
have any peace, so I opened the door of the aviary and he was
very glad to fly into the other part of the room, quite away from
the hen, where I let him pass the winter, as it was warmer and
more cheerful for him. He is a fine bird with a brilliant yellow
beak, but has not got very tame. At the beginning of this
month (April) I let him fly into the room where the pied bird
is still living, but she would have nothing to do with him for
some time. Only about a week ago she tolerated him in her
aviary, and now they are again nesting in earnest. I think the
hen was busy this morning laying an egg, and poor Mr. cock is
again in close attendance, and never gets a mealworm for himself.
I have not much hope of rearing a bird even if one should be
hatched, as I suspect they require more insect food than it is
possible for me to give them, and that my hen will not have
sufficient patience to bring up a baby.
Perhaps some of our readers will give me some hints about
feeding and management of soft bills when nesting, they will be
thankfully received.
The cock sings sweetly to his wife, but it is not his full
song at present.
Since the above was written I have an unfortunate sequel
to record. On the 22nd May, I left the door of the aviary open
and the hen escaped. Although she remained in the garden for
three days I could not catch her and she has now quite dis-
appeared. In the nest was one young bird just hatched and five
eggs, one of them chipped !

As long ago as 1S55, Brelim separated the resident Egyptian
Hoopoe from the European race and called it Upupa major
(Brelim Vogelfang, p. 78, 1S55). Subsequent writers have en-
tirely overlooked this well-marked subspecies, although there
are several specimens in the British Museum collection.
Earl}&amp;apos;- in 1909, Mr. J. E. Bonliote and the present writer
obtained specimens of Hoopoes at Inclias in Lower Egypt, which
were at once recognised as being different from Upupa epops epops
by their longer and much deeper bills. A comparison of these
specimens with Brehm's type, now preserved in the Hon. W.
Rothschild's collection at Tring, showed them to be identical
with Upupa major (cf Bull, B.O.C., XXIII. p. 100, 1909).
Subsequent researches by the writer have proved that
Brehm's Hoopoe is resident in Lower Egypt, and also probably
in the Fayoum, though as regards the latter place further in-
vestigation is necessary as we have at present no absolute proof
that this race breeds there, though it is extremely probable that
it does so, seeing that Upupa major is the breeding form at Luxor,
where there is little doubt that it is resident.
There is no doubt, however, that Brehm's Hoopoe is the
breeding Hoopoe of the Nile delta, where it is resident and
resorts to the mud houses of the native villages for nidification.
On April 20th, 1910, I paid a visit to Inclias for the pur-
pose of obtaining young examples of this Hoopoe for the Giza
Zoological Gardens. Several nests were found containing newly-
hatched young, but none of them were old enough to take. The
nests were all in holes in the mud walls of houses, and in several
cases the adult females were brooding the young.
As we were too early, I made arrangements with a local
native to get me young birds of a suitable age for rearing, and a
short time afterwards I received from him two lots of young;
the first being two well-grown young birds, and later, a nest of
six youngsters, which were just feathering.
Of the first lot, one met with an accident which caused its

death a few days after its arrival ; all the others were reared to
maturity, though one, a sickly bird, died when full-grown.
Several months later, one of the remaining six birds was found
dead in the pond in the aviary and, up to the time of writing
(April 24th, 1911), the remainder are in perfect condition.

(Natural size).
When they first arrived, all the young Hoopoes refused
food, and I had to cram each one separately. After a few hours,
however, they readily took their food, and as they grew older
they left the open biscuit tin in which I kept them and literally
mobbed me every time I entered my house.
The food used was a preparation obtained from France,
and contained biscuit, locusts, "dried flies'' and ant cocoons
ground into a fine powder. This mixed into a thin cream with

Mrs. Katharine Currey,
water or milk proved the most suitable food and was taken
readily. When feeding the young I always called to them with
a certain whistle, and as they grew older they would follow me
about the house on hearing the whistle. On one occasion one of
the young birds flew out of the window, but returned the next
morning on hearing me feeding the others.
At the time of writing, the Hoopoes are enclosed in a
large aviary in company with Doves and Plovers, and up to the
present we have had no trouble with "split bills," which seems
to be a common failing with Hoopoes. The floor of the aviary is
for the most part loose rubble and sand, and the birds can probe
in this to the full extent of their bills without any difficulty.
From the time they were able to feed themselves our
Brehm's Hoopoes have taken practically nothing but fresh
chopped meat placed in a dish of water, and on this they seem
to thrive well.
A few days ago one of them started singing, if " Hoop
hoop" can be expressed as a song. They are provided with
nesting-boxes, but up to the present show no signs of using
them.
The characters by which the present form may be distin-
guished from the typical Upupa epops is as follows :--Brehm's
Hoopoe is easily recognisable from Upiipa epops epops in having
the bill much larger and stouter, especially at the base, and the
males are less brightly coloured than are the males of typical
Upupa epops. In both forms the males have always larger bills
and are more brightly coloured than the females.

For more than thirty years I have kept Ring Doves-- i.e.
the ordinary light brown Barbary or Laughing Dove--loose about
the garden, but now-a-days I find it more difficult to get the
pure-bred brown Dove than formerly, no doubt on account of
the inter-breeding with the white Java Dove. Barbary Doves are
now almost pearl-coloured, and they appear to me to be more
pugnacious. Everyone who keeps White Javas know how fierce
they are.

26;,
The gentle harmless Dove is a mythical bird. No birds
are fiercer in the breeding-season than the Doves. I used to
keep my Doves in a large flight aviary; I have kept Java,
Barbary, Common Turtle Doves, Bronzewings, Zebra Doves and
Cambayan Turtle Doves, the last-named, to my mind, the loveliest
of all ; but, like all birds, they are never so interesting as when
loose, as their characters do not develop as when they have to a
large extent to fend for themselves. The Cambayan Turtle
Doves have never left the garden, but many Ring Doves have
flown away, no doubt to other gardens with more attractive trees.
It is during the nesting-time when they fly off, pursued by their
rivals. I began keeping the Cambayan Turtle Doves in an
aviary, but, like all Turtle Doves, they were so restless and chafed
so at their captivity that I let them out. A Japanese gentleman
who was here and watched them flying about said they would
never leave their home, like the Ring Doves do. They abound
in Japan. And so it has proved. For years they have lived here,
every Spring nesting about in the trees, in ivy, or in an old yew-
hedge, and come ever}' morning and afternoon to be fed. Just
now they are in beautiful plumage, the golden sheen on their wings
is very brilliant, and the apricot colour of their necks very rich
and pure. They are quite friendly with the Ring Doves, and feed
out of the same wooden bowl. If they are annoyed, they make a
buzzing noise like a large blue-bottle, and their cooing sounds
absurdly patronizing and affected, accompanied by a succession
of such rapid little bows that you could not count them. The
cock is especially cruel to the hen in the Spring, preventing her
feeding, like the Ring Doves.
It is very pretty to watch a flight of Ring Doves in early
Summer chasing each other in play round and round the garden.
They love to get the wind under their wings. When they build
they collect little sticks in their beaks and fly to the nest-site,
where the mate waits to receive and adjust them to form the
very slender nest. The Barbarys and Javas come indoors and
assert their right to the house, flying up on to a wardrobe in
a bedroom to build there, and much resenting being turned out.
Their young perch on people's hats and on the dog's back, and
scramble on to the tea-table to get at the cake,--thoroughly

troublesome, but the Cambayans will not get quite tame. I
think, if it is possible--but of course one is apt to lose one's
birds--it is far more interesting to have pet-birds free than caged,
and to be able to watch their natural ways; and I find many
birds prefer to stay in or near their cage--provided it is made a
home to them and not a prison--to taking their liberty.
But for this they must be made very tame and have real
attachment to their owner. A Blue Thrush I had for some years
got out of his cage and flew across the garden into an orchard
and over to a little wood, then back again over the garden and
house to a grove beyond. Of course I gave him up for lost.
Next day he appeared at a bedroom window, and hopped in on
to a pin-cushion, where he stood bowing, as if to say " Here I am

again ! " He was overjoyed to see his cage and hurried back
into it.
I should imagine the Blue-bearded Cuban Dove (Slanuznas
cyanocephala ) to be one of the most beautiful of all doves, but
I have never seen it.

Lack of space (which of course is a polite euphemism for
limited means) compels me to keep my Cayenne Spur-winged
Plover (Vanellus cayennensis&amp;apos;) in a miserably small aviary,
measuring only about nine yards by two yards. Nevertheless in
this restricted space they have flourished and nested and seem
quite happy. The Cayenne Plover, apart from the interesting
spurs on the wings, quite suggests a coarsely made native Lapwing
with a fierce red eye. The plumage, however, is very beautiful.
The wing-spur, which varies in length considerably in
different birds, is usually only noticeable when the wings are
stretched and is said (and no doubt correctly) to be used for the
purpose of defence and attack. I have never seen a blow actually
struck with it.
Two of my birds arrived in the autumn of 1909 and a few
weeks later I got a third bird which had practically only one
wing--the other having been so badly damaged by accident that

it had to be taken off in a way that I am told would have killed
most birds. However, this bird survived and seemed none the
worse for the operation. Its arrival was welcomed by the other
two birds in a very striking manner. They both went up to the
stranger, placed themselves shoulder to shoulder one on each side
and the trio marched thus up and down, perhaps a dozen times,
all three birds shrieking loudly but with this difference, that the
winged bird gave out slow notes at intervals whereas the other
two birds gave out notes repeated as rapidly as possible.
They then settled down without further performance except
a good deal of chattering. This is I think, interesting in view of
what is stated (in Hudson's " Argentine Ornithology ") of their
antics in their native country.
These Plovers are very fierce, excitable birds, and when I
once put an Indian Yellow-wattled Tapwing in with them 1
think they would have killed it in half-an-liour if I had not gone
to the rescue.
They seem quite hardy--at any rate in a grass run on a
well-drained sandy soil with a shelter shed. I feed them on raw
chopped meat and boiled rice in the morning, and the same or
chopped shrimps and Victoria poultry food in the afternoon. If
allowed to do so, they would eat nothing but raw meat, but this
would not, I think, suit their health for long. They are very
vociferous at all times when anything strange comes near the run
and chatter loudly on moonlight nights. It is interesting to note
that Lapwings flying over are always greeted with loud cries and
clearly at once distinguished (even when flying at a great height)
from other birds.
On the nth March last, I noticed two of the Plover very
busy lining a small hole in the ground with bits of dried grass in
a way that suggested nesting operations. I also noticed them
rushing with outstretched wings and loud cries of auger to
attack a Martinique Rail with whom they had previously lived on
fairly friendly terms.
Between the nth and the 24th March the two birds were
intensely active with the nest, deepening the hole with their beaks,
pulling out all the grass, rearranging it, then pulling it all to
pieces and again deepening the hole, and so on. They evidently

thought they were very clever and usually approached the nest in
a crouching manner and with lowered crest. As a matter of fact
the net result was very poor as the nest was not large enough for
the eggs afterwards laid, and one on several occasions got pushed
out and I had to put it back. The eggs were blotched something
like a common Lapwing's in colour but more the shape of an
ordinary fowl's egg, and were not arranged in the nest with
points to the centre like the common Lapwings.
The first egg was laid on the 24th March and three more
on the 26th, 28th and 31st. Whether the winged bird or one of
the others laid the eggs I cannot say as they were both constantly
going on and off the nest. They both began to sit in turns on
1st April, the third bird apparently being little interested in the
nesting operation, but all along all three birds were on quite
friendly terms and there was no suggestion of jealousy.
The first week in April was truly arctic weather and it was
strange to see one of the Plover sitting on the eggs with the
ground all round covered with snow. As these birds are said
to nest in Argentina in the month of June if the weather is
favourable, I quite expected the severe frosts and blizzards we had
in early April would make my birds desert the nest, but to their
credit they did not. The only thing that really disturbed them
nesting was a wild Ring-necked cock Pheasant that would stand
amongst some fir trees just outside the run to watch proceed-
ings. This conduct, thoughtlessly repeated, caused all three
Plovers to rush violently about and set up deafening yells that
could be heard half-a-mile off.
Matters went on like this until utli April, the winged bird
and its mate sitting on the eggs and standing to guard the nest in
turn, and so far there appeared to be merely a friendly under-
standing with the third bird. On nth April, however, a striking
change occurred, the third bird began to assist at the nest,
occasionally sitting, standing on guard or joining with one of the
others in throwing bits of grass about near the nest. This third
ally seemed to be quite welcomed by the other two birds.
On 16th April hearing the three allies making a most awful
noise I went to see the cause and found they had removed one of
the eggs at least a yard from the nest. I placed it back again and

within half-an-hour found they had again removed it, this time
they had taken it into their drinking pan four yards distant and
left it broken in the water. The birds continued to sit on the other
three eggs until 28th April when I took the eggs away. The birds
during this period were apparently on the most friendly terms.
The eggs were all rotten and I suspect that the frosts of the first
week of the month would account for this. At the same time I
should not describe the allies as good sitters as they were
relieving one another every few minutes when sitting. One
curious thing I noticed a few days before I took away the eggs,
and that was the entire removal of the nest and eggs to a hollow
immediately adjoining the first nest. There was no mistake about
this as the position of the original nest was just outside the shelter
shed, whereas the substituted nest was just inside the shed. All
the lining of the original nest was removed and a good deal more
dried grass added to line the new one which was better made than
the original nest. I have not the least idea why the birds did this.
Iam inclined to think that the triple alliance consisted of two
cocks and one hen (the winged bird) but "all my mind is clouded
with a doubt." I think I am right in saying that somewhat
similar nesting arrangements of Spur-winged Plover have been
noticed by Mr. Hudson in Argentina, the hen sitting on the eggs
and the two cocks standing by the nest. I hope, on a future
occasion, to be able to report the successful nesting of some of
the allies.

present specimen was received from the West Coast of the South

Dr. Philip Bahr, a member of the Society, has spent some
months recently in the Fiji and Tonga Islands from which he
has brought a few very interesting birds. He has presented the
Zoological Society with a specimen of the Tabuan Parrakeet
(Pyrrhulopsis tabuensis ) and a Taviuni Parrakeet (P. taviuensis&amp;apos;),
the latter being new to the collection.
Besides these he has sent us three specimens of the rare
Fijian Parrot Finch, Erythrura pealei, which has never before
been imported. It is like the Parrot-fincli of New Caledonia
except that the throat is blue instead of red.
Several very nice birds have been received in the King's
Collection of which the following are the most noteworthy :--
Four of the Grey-necked Crowned Crane ( Balearica regulorum )
a species now seldom imported ; two young Black-necked
Crowned Cranes (Z?. pavonina ), two Stanley Cranes, four Secretary
Birds, two Eastern White Pelicans ( Pelccanus roseus), three Cape
Gannets {Sula capensis ), one Martial Hawk Eagle, three Jackal
Buzzards, four Spotted Eagle-Owls, one Grey Eagle-Owl, one
Ground Hornbill, one Yellow-billed Duck, two Red-billed Ducks,
one Scarce Duck ( Anas sparsd), probably the first ever imported,
and four Black-footed Penguins.
Mr. Frost, who has been collecting in India, has just
returned with a wonderful collection of birds, of which perhaps
the rarest are a pair of Hooded Cranes ( Grus monachus&amp;apos;) of which
species one example only, obtained in 1S76, has been previously
represented in the Gardens. It inhabits Eastern Siberia, China
and Japan. It is little larger than the Demoiselle Crane, gvey,
with a white neck and the forehead black and red, the latter
colour being produced by the red skin showing through the
black bristles.
With these came a pair of the Eastern race of the Common
Crane which was once thought to be distinct and named Grus
lilfordi; also a number of rare small birds which I must leave
until next month.
The most interesting event in the way of breeding results
is the hatching of a young Cariama in the Eastern aviary. We

birds promptly took possession of and laid two eggs. One got
broken, but the second hatched, and the young bird, which is
now about ten days old, is doing well.
Red-winged Starlings and Grey-winged Ouzels have young,
and we have chicks of Satyr Tragopans, Peacock Pheasants,
Sonnerats Jungle-fowls and several of the commoner Pheasants.
Of ducks we have some fifteen Carolinas, three Red-crested

Sir,--I do not know if the Red-vented Blue Bonnet Parrakeet has
nested and reared young in this country before, but in case it may not these
few notes may be of interest.
In the spring of 190S I obtained a pair which had been privately im-
ported; they were in perfect health and plumage, so I turned them out at
once into an unheated outdoor aviary, where they had a compartment con-
sisting of a small shed and rather long flight to themselves; they took very
kindly to their new surroundings, were not wild and never ailed in any way.
I11 the spring of 1909 they paired and scraped a hole in some saw-dust
there was in a large nesting-box, but did not lay, and in 1910 they did
much the same ; but early this spring, the winter having been very mild,
they began to take interest in an old stump of a tree I put 011 the ground
in their shed and which was hollow and had several holes in it. About
March 4th I missed the lien for a few days, but on the 17th she was out, so
I looked in and saw certainly one egg, though there may have been more.
After that she was seen off but once till April nth, when she came out for a
short time, and then did so daily, remaining out longer each day till the
end of the month, when she no longer remained in the nest during the day.
On May 14th the first young bird came out, it was quite full-feathered
and flew about well, but returned to the nest frequently; 011 the 19th, a
second came out, and it was also full-feathered and able to fly, and I then
looked in at the nest and saw one egg remaining, I suppose an unfertile one.
The young birds never made the least noise, and there was no evidence of
their being in the stump, except that the old ones consumed a larger
quantity of food than they could want for themselves.
These Parrakeets, though coming from a fairly hot part of Australia,
must be very hardy, as, during the end of March and fore part of April

when the lien was sitting, we had frequent snow-storms, and occasionally
sharp frosts about the time she was hatching. Their food has consisted of
canary seed, hemp and millet and a large quantity of English white oats,
and they have had plain cake daily (of which they seem very fond),
groundsel and shepherd's purse have also been given, but they did not seem
to care much about them. The young birds are just like the old ones,
except their tails are not so long, but they bow to one another and make
the same call and behave quite in the same way. Duncan Parker.
P.S.--Since the above was written the birds have again gone to nest
and are now (June 6tli) sitting.
[We believe this is the first instance of the nesting of this species in
Great Britain. If any members or correspondents know of a previous
instance we should be much obliged if they will kindly let us know.-- Ed.]

Sir, --In the last number I wrote a letter under the above heading
in which I pointed out my reason for disagreeing with my friend Mr.
Gregory Mathews in his assumption that Poephila hecki was synonymous
with P. acuticauda.
The last paragraph of my letter, however, is perhaps somewhat un-
fair to Mr. Mathews, and I hasten to apologise if this is so.
I said, in effect, that he had no right to sweep aside the testimony of
those who had seen the living birds, when he himself had only seen the
dried skins in which the colour of the bill had probably faded. This may
seem to imply that I accuse Mr. Mathews of looking only at the skins and
not at the labels.
Mr. Mathews has since pointed out to me that all of his skins are
labelled with full data, and that his collectors have instructions to observe
especially the colour of the bill and soft parts generally, and to carefully
note them.
Hence it is clear that all of Mr. Mathews' specimens belong to the
typical yellow-billed form, a fact which, however, does not in any way prove
that a distinct red-billed form does not exist; even though the habitat of
some of his birds is the same as that from which North, on the evidence of
a catcher only, believed P. hecki to originate.
So far we know that the red-billed P. hecki exists somewhere in
Northern Australia, but the exact locality still remains doubtful.

Finch." On November 5, I received an odd bird which, with only one pair
besides, had been exhibited at the L. &amp; P. O. Show at the Aquarium on the
preceding da}'. The same pair, and that alone, appeared at the Palace
three mouths later. And two months afterwards, in April, 1898, I purchased
three more of these birds from a dealer. Five out of the six that I had
secured lived with me for a considerable time, and gave me opportunities
of making many notes. All of them, and all that I had then seen, were
orange-billed birds: all that I had seen were the same as my own : there-
fore my six would seem to have been ordinary normal examples of Po&amp;apos;ephila
hecki, though not at that early day specialised and recognised as such.
Towards the close of the summer (1S9S), a good many more Long-
tailed Grassfiuches reached this country; and by September they were being
advertised at 25/-the pair. I did not see these birds ; but I have a suspicion
that til is was the first arrival of the yellow-billed form--but I may be
wrong here.
As with several other species, I found that my Long-tailed Grass-
fiuches, when transferred from a cage in a warm room to the open aviary,
lost the beautiful bloom from their plumage. Moreover, the colour of the
bill differed not only in different examples but, at certain seasons, in the
same individual, becoming (to quote my own notes) ''deep red," "red
orange," "deep orange red" when in breeding condition, but often fading
into a dull orange, and occasionally into quite a light shade. And so it
followed that when it was bruited abroad, or perhaps at first only whispered
with bated breath, that there were two forms of the Long-tailed Grassfincli,
I, who had never seen a " yellow-bill," judged that the world was wrong,
and that the differences were no more than what I have hinted at above.
Rut my vanity was doomed to receive a cruel shock. I think it must
have been on the 5th October, 1S9S, that the blow fell, on the occasion of
my paying a visit to the "First Great Specialist Show" at the Crystal
Palace, when there were several pairs (or so-called pairs) on view --but all so
different prom those in my oivn aviary! Some species respond to the arts
and crafts of the exhibitor in a marvellous way--and my Longtails were
nowhere by comparison with them. And in some cases a tail grown in the
warm will "run away" from one grown in the garden aviary--and, com-
pared with these exhibits, mine were but Short-tailed Grassfiuches. Their
bills, too, instead of being dull, or faded, or out-of-condition bills, were of a
bright, clear, almost aggressive yellow. And very reluctantly I was con-
strained to come to the conclusion, either (r) That there are, in truth, two
distinct forms of the Long-tailed Grassfincli, or (2) That certain exhibitors
at the Palace are uncommonly clever artificers. Reginald Phillipps.

Geocichla citrina.
Sir, --In May', my pair of Orange-headed Ground Thrushes built a
nest on the broad ledge of a nesting-box, fixed high up in the aviary under
the overhanging roof which partly covers in an outside wire flight.
The nest was about twelve feet up, and was composed of moss as a
foundation, very neatly put together, and lined with fine grass-stems.
There were three eggs, rather smaller than a Blackbird's ( 3 ferula) of a pale
blue, blotched with rufous, especially at the stouter ends, where the spots
were thickly laid on.
Three young hatched, and thrived for a week or ten days, when they
were found thrown out of the nest, and carried some distance from it.
I fancy they had died first, and were removed by the parent birds. They
were just beginning to feather, and pale buff-orange could be seen on the
breast at the tip of the quills.
I fancy these beautiful Thrushes have not nested in England, but I
may be mistaken ; at any rate, the death of the young ones was one of the
great disappointments through which a keen aviculturist has to go.
The parent birds had been well supplied with earth-worms, gentles
and cockroaches, and both seemed to be anxious for the welfare of their
progeny. No other bird was ever seen to go near the nest, and I do not
think that any mouse did either. Hubert I). AsTr.EY.

We have recently received a little pamphlet with the title
" The other Side of the Bars " issued by the Humanitarian Society
and accompanying it a short note asking for review or criticism.
This pamphlet, needless to say, gives but one aspect to the case
and that aspect painted in colours so lurid that we feel inclined
to doubt the authenticity of some of the statements, and are quite
certain that, even if true in isolated instances, which we do not
for one moment admit, they do not represent a fair and average
account of the majority of bird dealers' shops. Were we so
disposed we could under the same title " The other Side of the
Bars" draw a much happier and perfectly true picture of the
"miserable creatures" singing not "for relief" but from full
enjoyment of health and vigour. We could tell of caged birds

living in luxury and happiness to an age when under natural
conditions they would long have surrendered their life to the
stress of Nature, or again we could show the birds mating and
bringing up their broods in full ecstasy of health and happiness
and relieved from the ever present sense of danger and the
necessity of hunting early and late to feed ravenous nestlings.
Yet, as every bird-fancier knows, all this goes on " the other side
of the bars."
But the Humanitarian may reply--Few birds lead this
ideal existence compared with the thousands that suffer as we
have described. To that the reply is, that never having kept a
bird or mixed with those who have, they know nothing of the
happy and well-cared-for birds in private homes, whereas the
bird-shops are open to all.
There is, however, a very good proverb which says that
there is "no smoke without fire" and as bird-keepers we must
allow that the conditions of some bird shops do require alteration.
To attack bird caging because some bird shops are badly kept
seems to the writer illogical and equivalent to trying to prohibit
all paraffin lamps because some explode.
I am quite sure there is no bird-keeper who is not a bird
lover and therefore just as anxious to put down cruelty as the
most rabid Humanitarian, and the reason why bird-fanciers have
not taken in hand the so-called "cruelties" of the dealer is
probably because as practical men w r e know that such cruelties
are largely exaggerated.
It seems, however, that it is time that the foundation of
truth, on which such pamphlets have been based, should be
removed. It has recently been suggested at an informal meet-
ing of a few bird lovers that the registration and licensing of
bird dealers (which plan was also suggested by Mrs. Currey in
the Magazine for May, p. 213) would be a step in the right
direction--it would at all events sort out the respectable dealer
from those less reputable, and if members of the different fancier
societies only dealt with those dealers who kept their birds
properly, others would soon be starved out to the mutual benefit
of the fancier, the respectable dealer, and last, but by no means
least, of the birds themselves. Apart from actual overcrowding,

small cages and ill-ventilated rooms, the question of selling and
catching birds in the close time is one that calls for much
attention. The law, however, as it stands, if far from ideal, is at
all events sufficient and, once dealers were licensed, these and
many similar matters would adjust themselves. In the case of
game it was found necessary to license the dealer, and the result
has worked well ; the case of cage birds is very similar, and we
feel sure that if the licensing question was taken up we should
hear no more highly coloured tales of misery and pain on " The
other side of (some) bars."
As this is a question which concerns all of us whether our
birds be kept in cages or aviaries, we shall welcome the opinions
of members on the subject.

Our member Mr. Constable has kindly favoured us with
a report of the Uppingham School Natural Science Society.
Although the ornithological portion deals chiefly with observa-
tions on wild birds, we have much pleasure in referring to it here
as it is essentially well-arranged and a model of what such reports
should be. There is no better plan of helping the protection
of our native birds than by stimulating the observing and re-
cording of notes on the various species of birds which may be
commonly met with. Such observations are valuable, not only
from the interest and education they give to the observer, but by
their collection and publication they form a history of the birds
of the neighbourhood, which has its importance for the more
serious student.
We have just received the Bulletin of the Soci6t6 Nationale
d'Acclimatation de France. This number contains a continuation
by Dr. Loisel of some early Russian Zoological Gardens, the
earliest of which seems to have consisted of a large collection of
bears, kept by Ivan IV. about the middle of the 16th century,
which were chiefly used for bear baiting or for torturing his serfs.

Although not, properly speaking, cage birds, this Order
includes, to my way of thinking, some of the most fascinating
of birds. Probably from their use in the royal sport of Hawking
they were one of the earliest birds to be kept in confinement
(excepting, of course, fowls, pigeons and ducks, and possibly
the Brush Turkeys) and their extreme reluctance to breed in
confinement has probably been the most powerful factor in
preventing their domestication. In spite, however, of the many
centuries during which they have been kept by man, there
is perhaps no group of birds that, considering its very simple
needs, has been so misunderstood, and owing to this, but a
very small percentage of the individuals seen in Zoological
Gardens are in what one might consider really good trim. I
am not dealing in this article with Hawks used for hawking,
they naturally need a treatment to suit the purposes for which
they are required, and to any readers who may wish to keep
them for that purpose I may refer them to Mr. Harting's
valuable book on the " Practical Management of Hawks." * We
have, however, to consider the keeping of these birds in large
cages or aviaries in which much active exercise is impossible.
To keep a Hawk as kept by falconers on 'jesses ' tied to a perch
or block is, if it is not being used for hawking, cruel and unkind.

Diurnal birds of prey, which are for purposes of this article
included under the rough and inaccurate term Hawks, may be
divided into three main groups--Vultures, Kites and Hawks
proper. The former feed entirely on carrion, the Kites chiefly
on carrion, while the Hawks proper always catch and kill their
own prey. Of these three groups the latter are the most delicate,
and thus, if we treat the two hardier groups as we do the most
delicate we shall err, if indeed we err at all, on the safe side.
In our treatment of these birds, the first popular delusion
which must be dispelled is that these birds are hardy, and that
all they require is a cage with or without shelter, and a little food
daily. This is a very great mistake ; true they are not difficult
to keep, but unless properly kept, although they may not actually
die they will never look nice and always be out of condition.
In the first place, let us see how they live when wild, that
we may have some wrinkles as to their requirements in confine-
ment. Although having perforce to seek their prey in cold,
bleak and open situations, their actual home is either the gullies
of some steep and broken cliff or in the tall trees of some huge
forest, and, when not actually hunting for their pre)q they are
extremely sedentary birds. The capturing of their prey again
is no certainty, and many attempts have sometimes to be made
before success brings a well-earned meal. The meal, however,
being once procured is a good and substantial one and sufficient
to last the captor two or three days before the pangs of hunger
once more drive him to the chase. Further than this, in their
methods of feeding, bones, fur and feathers become swallowed
together with the more digestible portions of their food ; these,
by the action of the stomach, become collected into a pellet and
subsequently ejected, and it is not until some time after the
ejection of the pellet that they require another meal. Compare
this mode of life with the usual conditions under which these
birds are kept in confinement. A large open cage, exposed
alike to sun, wind and rain, without any shelter, so many ounces
of cold raw meat given daily whether required or not, opportu-
nities for casting pellets but seldom supplied, and, if supplied,
the next meal served punctually to the hour, regardless of
whether Nature demands the food or not. Is it to be wondered

at, therefore, that the birds of prey at most Zoological Gardens
become dull, listless and apathetic, often 'hanging' in their
moult and generally with broken wings and tail. Yet such are
the facts.
We have already pointed out that, in a wild state, Hawks
spend much of their time sitting in some fairly sheltered place
till the need of seeking a fresh meal puts them on the move, and
in captivity we must as far as possible try to imitate these con-
ditions. In the first place, the aviary must be in a sheltered
spot; it is quite useless to have an open flight with an elaborated
devised house, as but few Hawks will enter the shelter of their
own accord, and, moreover, being of a rather wild disposition
there is a great tendency for them to break their flights and tail,
and also to damage themselves if kept entirely in an open flight.
The ideal aviary is one which is only open in the front and
boarded at the sides, top and back. It should be provided with
two perches placed end on to the observer at a moderate height
from the ground and a fair distance apart, so that the bird must
use his wings to get from one to the other. If the aspect is in
any way open to cold or wet winds there should be a flap about
three feet wide hinged on to the front of the roof. In ordinary
weather this should be raised, but in cold and wet weather, or if
it be very hot, it can be lowered to serve as a shelter and retreat.
A further perch should be placed fairly high up against the
back as a roosting-perch, and should only be large enough to
accommodate one bird at a time. This perch must be arranged
sufficiently high up so that the bird when on it may have the
advantage of the shelter given by the flap when lowered. The
ground of the aviary should be covered with coarse sand and
gravel. In such an aviary almost any species--except some of the
smaller and more delicate species--may be kept in all weathers.
Now as to food. No bird of prey should be given more
than he can finish at a meal, and any food left untouched an
hour after feeding time should be removed. This, of course,
does not apply to freshly-caught or very wild individuals. Once
a day for six days a week is as often as they should be fed, and
the best time is about two o'clock in the afternoon. By this
method the bird will have his dinner, rest, and then retire to

roost; the pellet, if he is going to cast one, will be thrown early
in the morning, and the first part of the day, feeling hungry, he
will be somewhat restless and take a lot of exercise moving from
perch to perch. Many people are apt to think that because a
bird is restless he is unhappy; no greater fallacy was ever put
forward, for so-called restlessness is often his only method of
taking exercise, which is as essential for birds as for men. As
a rule, the only way to get a captive bird to exercise is for him
to have a healthy appetite, which is in turn further stimulated
by the exercise. The happy and contented individual that sits
preening himself all day on his perch almost invariably suffers
from liver and eventually dies from an accumulation of super-
abundant fat.
No birds, however, are so lethargic and ' livery' in captivity
as birds of prey, and hence it becomes essential if they are to be
kept not merely alive but in the ' pink of condition ' that details
in the structure of their aviaries and their diet should be care-
fully attended to. This brings us to the all-important question
of diet; if possible to obtain, nothing can excel fresh birds,
rabbits or rats, but in most cases such a diet cannot, apart from
expense, be easily procured, and so we are driven to butcher's
meat. O11 this, however, most species will live well, provided
they are given good, sound, lean meat, with as little fat as
possible. Although some people use 'lights' or 'liver' I have
very little faith in it, though it may be given for a change, but,
apart from their nutritive properties, this food is too soft, and
the bird loses the exercise gained by pulling to pieces good,
strong meat.
Another food extensively used by some is fowls' heads,
these are chiefly skin and bone, and as the bones are too large
and of the wrong shape for a Hawk up to the size of a Peregrine
this food is chiefly useful to give the bird a certain amount of
feather and a good deal of exercise. For five days in the week,
however, good lean meat is the best and most suitable food ; on
the sixth day the bird should be given some fur or feather--bird,
rabbit or rat--in order that it may cast a pellet. I11 default of
'natural fur' a good substitute may be made by cutting up tow
in lengths 01 about an inch and mixing it with the meat; this

plan is, I believe, followed in the Giza Zoological Gardens with
excellent results. Fowls' heads, in addition to the usual rations
are very useful here, but whatever ' fur ' be given the bird should
on this day have a gorge, that is to say be given double rations,
the remnants of which need not be removed till the next morn-
ing, O11 the day following the 'gorge' it should be fasted. By
this means almost any Hawk can be kept in the finest trim and
condition. The birds, however, will require watching during the
moult, which commences in the early part of the summer, and
then they will require rather more generous feeding, which has
to be continued well on into the autumn, long after the moult
has ceased ; by November, however, a return may be made to
the ordinary rations. The amount of food that should be given
at any meal can be easily judged by the actions of the bird. If
it has not all been eaten at one sitting too much has been given,
and if, on the other hand, he is ready for more when the surplus
food is being removed his dinner has erred on the 'short' side.
I am afraid that when written down all this may sound very
complicated, but it is not so in practice, it is quite easy to make
a rule not to feed the birds on Sunday and to give them larger
rations with chopped tow on Saturday, and that is all that is
essential. Of course, anyone who cannot take sufficient interest
to find out when his birds are in moult should not keep birds.
Next comes the question of water for bathing and drinking,
for the latter purpose water is not necessary, and I cannot
remember ever seeing a Hawk drink, though good observers
have stated that they do, but many species undoubtedly like a
bath at times, even though they are not great bathers. The best
bath is a large rectangular tray, about four inches deep, which
may be put in on fine bright days. Hawks properly kept are,
like most birds, very seldom ill ; if, however, they appear out-of-
sorts I have generally found that a day without food, followed by
a good meal off a freshly-killed warm bird or rat, and then giving
them for some days as much ' fur ' as possible soon brought them
back to health.
The species of Hawks, though numerous, are all so alike
in habits that the same treatment will do for all, especially the
larger kinds. There are, however, some delightful small species,

<bodyText confidence="0.998500236842105" page_id="9404278"  page_num="280" year="" vol="">
which are rather delicate and require a little more care. Firstly,
we have the Sparrow Hawk ; this species rarely does well or
lives long in confinement and is also extremely wild. It will
not live on butcher's meat, and does not care for rats and so
small birds are the only food on which it will do well. The
Merlin is * par excellence,' one of the tamest and most delightful
of our native Hawks. Young ones reared from the nest make
charming pets, but generally die during the winter ; however, if
given plenty of tender meat (birds and mice) and kept in an
indoor aviary where they can take plenty of exercise during the
bad weather they will do fairly well, but I have never found
them very long-lived.
The Hobby, Red-footed Falcon, American Sparrow
Hawk (in reality a Kestrel) and several other small species may
sometimes be procured. These must all be taken indoors during
the winter or a glass front fixed to the aviaries already described.
They should be given as many small birds and mice as possible,
and also beetles or other similar insects. When given butcher's
meat it should be cut up into small pieces.
Hawks do very much better if kept in separate aviaries,
as when several are kept together the strongest almost invariably
take the lion's share of the food ; but if several are kept together
the same number of pieces of meat must be given as there are
birds, no more and no less, for if they are keen on their food, as
they should be if in health, they will not settle down to feed till
all the food is gathered up and an extra piece leads to fighting
and quarrelling. Another reason against keeping several together
is that in autumn, when the birds get ravenous, the weaker are
almost certain to be partially starved and possibly killed outright,
though this is not very often the case.
Kites and Vultures have quite different habits and may
safely be kept together, as may also Owls, except in spring and
autumn, when they must be carefully watched.
Hawks are said to be extremely shy breeders in confine-
ment and, except for the Kestrel which has been known to nest
about three times, I can find no records of the successful breeding
of other species. Personally I do not think there would be much
difficulty in inducing these birds to nest, provided they were

given a suitable place and that a pair could be got to live together.
They should be introduced to each other in late autumn and kept
together during the winter, being turned out into their breeding
aviary early in spring. Few people, if any, have tried to breed
them, and captive Hawks are seldom in breeding condition.
The Black Kite has laid and hatched with me on several
occasions, both in a large barn and in a comparatively small
aviary, and Vultures have been known to nest not infrequently.
It is hardly necessary to add any special remarks 011 Kites
and Vultures, they are much hardier than Hawks and will live
peaceably together. Being by nature carrion-feeders they are
not nearly so particular as to their food, and it is not so important
to give them fur every week. On the other hand, they are much
more greed)&amp;apos; and lazy than a Hawk, and care must be taken not
to overfeed them; in other respects, if kept in the manner
described for Hawks they will thrive and in all probability breed.
II. OWLS.
Beyond the fact that the majority of Owls are raptorial
birds, they have no other claim to be considered in any article
dealing with Hawks. From their similarity of food, however,
they may be kept in confinement in a manner similar to the
diurnal birds of prey. They are not nearly so wild or so liable
to knock themselves about as Hawks, so that if necessary their
aviary may be wired at the top and sides, but we find that they
undoubtedly keep in better condition if their aviary be covered
in ; it is, however, unnecessary to have the front flap. They
must be provided with a closed-in box, having merely a large
hole by which they can enter, and the box should have the
bottom of one side hinged to facilitate cleaning out. Certain
species, such as the Eagle Owl, Short-eared Owl and several
others will not enter a box, and in these cases the front flap
should be used, but it may be permanently fixed down in order
to provide a dark retreat during the day. The feeding should be
precisely the same as for the Hawks, except that as they feed at
night it is advisable to feed them late in the afternoon and re-
move the surplus food, if any, in the morning.

<bodyText confidence="0.998423052631579" page_id="9404280"  page_num="282" year="" vol="">
Several Owls may safely be kept together, but as most
species breed readily in confinement they should be separated
into pairs in the spring, or fighting (and murder) is pretty sure
to take place. Birds of the same sex will live together without
much fighting at all times of the year, but should a pair mate
they will soon kill off any other inmates. The loss of birds in
this way does not necessarily mean that they kill each other by
fighting, it more often happens that the weaker are driven to one
corner of the aviary from which they dare not move, and become,
in consequence starved. In the autumn, Owls need a much larger
amount of food and, where several kinds are kept together,
unless they are very much overfed, the weaker will have a bad
chance, but it must be remembered that if overfed, as is usually the
case, they will never be in condition or come into breeding trim.
When breeding, they require no special attention, but when
the young are hatched they should, if possible, be given nothing
but mice, rats and other natural food.
Owls will do very well in an aviary with a total absence of
sun, but, on the other hand, many species do enjoy occasionally
a'bask'in the sun, though it is in no way essential to their
health ; the same remarks apply to a bath.
Comparatively few species of Owls are commonly kept;
the Eagle Owl is the largest and finest species usually met with
and nests very freely. The eggs are generally laid in March in
a depression scraped in the floor of the aviary, and incubation is
carried out by the lieu alone. The approach of the breeding
season is heralded by the almost continuous hooting, the male and
female answering each other continuously and with monotonous
frequency. Care must, of course, be taken when entering the
cage, or even if standing near it, as both birds are at this time
extremely savage. This may also be said of most species when
nesting, except the Barn Owl, which I have found extremely
docile, allowing itself to be lifted off her young or eggs without
a protest.
Probably the most delightful Owls to keep are the Scops,
they are small and quite inoffensive and may comfortably be kept
in a living room in an ordinary cage and allowed out periodically
to exercise their wings. For this and other small species the

food should be cut up into little bits as they are not very good at
tearing their prey to pieces, and I have found it best to cut open
Sparrows and mice. They are passionately fond of mealworms,
and when flying about a room will take them from the fingers
while hardly pausing in their flight, in fact, the Scops is one of
the most delightful bird-pets imaginable. Several of these small
Owls, however, are rather delicate and require a little artificial
heat in winter.
I am afraid I have already exceeded my legitimate space,
but I can heartily recommend any of the birds of prey as most
delightful pets ; with few exceptions ( e.g. the Harriers) they
will become exceedingly tame, and as they have only to be fed
once a day they are essentially birds which one can feed oneself
and thus get into personal touch with them in a manner not so
easy with smaller species, whose food is always at hand. How-
ever tame they get, it is always as well to remember that they
have sharp claws, and as when thoroughly tame they often
"strike' in play, it is best to wear thick gloves when handling
them.

WINTERING BIRDS IN OUTDOOR AVIARIES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990895625" page_id="9404281"  page_num="283" year="" vol="">
Sir, --You have asked members to write and say what birds have
wintered successfully in their garden aviaries.
My aviary consists of an open wired flight and a strong wooden house.
The windows face south and the door west ; during the winter this door
is closed, and the birds gain entrance to the flight by means of a small
square hole quite near the floor level, fitted with a sliding door, and put in
that position for the convenience of Quails which I kept some time ago.
The long side of the open flight faces south, the east is sheltered by
the bird-house, the north is boarded, and the west is sheltered by a hedge.
It sounds as if it were a very good position, but the soil is heavy and cold,
and as the garden slopes gradually down to the aviary, the mists and frost
seem much more severe there than in the upper part of the garden. The
house is without any heating arrangement, and this winter the water-pan
inside was thickly frozen during the hard frosts after Christmas.
Only a few birds spent the winter there. A pair of nesting Sibias
thinned them out sadly in the summer before I quite realised what was

The winter residents were :--
A Comoro Weaver, which has been out over a year and came into
gorgeous colour in April.
A Red-vented Bulbul, bought in 190S, now in fine condition, its head
and neck shining with quite a metallic sheen.
A very old pair of Masked Weavers, bought last autumn from a friend
who had had them for years ; the cock is now in fine colour.
An American Bunting bought last June.
A cock Blossom-head Parrakeet, bought last autumn from a friend,
but though accustomed to open-air life, he rarely left the bird-house. He
arrived rather shabby, but soon got into perfect condition.
A pair of English Thrushes, rescued from a cat at different times last
spring.
These are all the birds which spent last winter in the garden aviary,
though I have successfully wintered Grassfinches, a cock Gouldian, Orange
Cheeks, Lavender Finches, etc., in this same aviary some time ago, but I
rather think they were entirely shut in the bird house.
I can throw a light on the disappearance of the Quails of which your
correspondent complains, for the same thing happened to some of mine.
They were taken by rats, which will tunnel a long way and come up in the
run, and then I believe drag the poor things down. I once found a rat hole
under a little wooden box, turned upside down with a hole cut in the side,
in which my Quails used to sleep. I was hunting for missing ones and
picked up the box, only to find the hole, and to get there the rats must
have burrowed several feet as they could not have got into the run in any
other way.
I think that to winter birds successfully without heat in a garden
aviary it is necessary to have them out all the summer before.

The Red-capped Parrakeet--known also by the uneuphem-
istic name of Pileated Parrakeet -- is a most gorgeous bird,
differing from others of its family by the unusual shape of its
bill, which gives it the effect of panting, there being an open
space between the mandibles, the upper one of which is not
nearly so rounded as in other Parrakeets and the tip of the
lower one resting in a notch of the upper.
I cannot believe that the Red-capped Parrakeet is a true
Platycercus, although Gould has placed it in that family. Voice,
action, shape of head and bill, etc., are decidedly different.
In " Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds," Mr. Campbell
writes--" I enjoyed many opportunities of observing them in the
karri and jarrah forests, where they love to feed upon the kernel
of the native pear ( Xylomelum ) when the fruit opens under
the summer sun."
My magnificient pair which I still have, and which again
have, I believe, a family of young in a hollow log, were the first
to rear a brood (of four) and win our Society's medal, in June,
1909, but last year they failed to do so.

depict the male in a characteristic attitude, especially when the
female leaves her nest and settles near him, with the feathers of
the crown partly erected, by which means he displays in its full
beauty the magnificent cherry red of that part. At the same
moment he often droops the wings, puffing up the yellow feathers
of the lower back and upper tail coverts.
The young birds in their nestling plumage and after their
first moult lack the crimson crown, which in their case is dull
green, otherwise their colouring is a subdued edition of the
adult birds, the breast being a washed-out mauve, and the red on
the under tail-coverts much less brilliant. The yellow-green
cheeks too are very lacking in brightness.
Red-capped Parrakeets, when once acclimatized are ex-
tremely hardy, and will spend the winter in an open flight, so
long as they have good shelter to take refuge in when they feel
inclined. They are extremely active birds, constantly calling
in tones which are not exactly musical, and they are apt to be
quarrelsome, although mine have never actually damaged other
Parrakeets.
A Red-capped Parrakeet in full and perfect plumage is a
really splendid bird, and is certainly one of the most brilliant of
a brilliantly-coloured family. In size they may perhaps be
compared to the Mealy Rosella.
I reared, by hand, one young male which lived a year or a
little over, and when apparently in splendid condition and health,
died quite suddenly. This bird became very timid at the age of
three months and onwards, but before his death he evinced great
affection for my bird-keeper, feeding him and "displaying"
to him. At a year old, one or two cherry-red feathers began to
show on the crown of the head, and he was apparently about to
assume the brighter colours of the adult plumage. In time I
believe he would have become extremely tame, and his death was
very disappointing. He showed signs too of powers of mimicry.
I believe he had been frightened by something and had
knocked his head ; for an hour before I found him lying in the
cage as if he had had a convulsion, he appeared to be perfectly
well and happy.

By T. H. Newman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
It may be remembered that last summer ( Avic. Mag., I.
3rd series), I wrote some rough notes 011 the birds seen in
Algeria and Tunis in November and December 1909. Having
again gone over the same ground during March and April of this
year, the season, therefore, being three months more advanced,
it may be of sufficient interest to record what I saw this time,
though I fear I have even less to relate than before.
England was left on March 6tli. A number of Gulls were
noticed at Folkestone--mostly Herring--the greater number im-
mature ; there were also a good many Black-headed Gulls, most
of which had nearly completely assumed their dark hoods.
While crossing the Channel I saw two Cormorants half flying,
half swimming, in order to get out of the way of the boat;
further off a number of Guillemots or Razorbills were swimming
about and diving.
The next day, between Paris and Marseilles, a few Rooks
were observed and, of course, many Magpies, as many as seven
together at one place. A large brown Bird of Prey sitting on a
rail, and which afterwards flew round in a circle as the train
went by, appeared to be a Common Buzzard. O11 the morning
of the 8th I strolled round the Marseilles Zoo, which was looking
more neglected than ever. I did not notice anything of much
interest, but gave most attention to my favourite Doves, of which
I saw a pair of Blue-spotted Doves (Chalcopelia afra), some
Tambourine Doves had some very conspicuous dark purple spots
*on their wings ; there were also Half-collared, Barred, Common
Turtle and Barbary Doves, as well as some Turtle x Barbary
Hybrids. Great Tits were numerous in the tall trees in the
Gardens, and some Warblers were singing sweetly in the shrubs,
but were shy and kept out of sight. The Black headed Gulls at
Marseilles were not nearly so far advanced with their breeding
plumage as those at Folkestone. The afternoon and most of the
next day were spent at sea ; landed at Algiers about four in the
afternoon, the weather being dull and inclined to rain, for this
time Algiers was first visited ; while before, this place was left

Mr. T. H. Newman,
until last, so that now everything was seen in nearly the reverse
order. The Black-headed Gulls here had very black heads.
In the afternoon of the iotli, a long, beautiful drive was
taken along the Mustapha Hill, and back round by the Botanical
Gardens (Jardin d'Essai), noted chiefly for its wealth of Palms;
the flowers in the gardens were very beautiful, many houses
being covered with purple masses of Bougainvillea or orange-
yellow Bignonia, while lovely Roses were in profusion, Cinerarias
were the usual bedding plants, while the ground was carpeted
with Freesias, Violets, and a host of other flowers. Many birds
were about, the Jardin d'Essai was swarming with Blackcaps
(Silvia atricapilla ), which were very lively, singing and chasing
one another, and seemed in no way depressed by the rain which
was falling at the time; they were mostly cock birds, but I
noticed a good many hens, these would be more likely to hide,
so expect they were equally numerous to the cocks. March nth
was spent in an excursion to the Chiffa Gorge. A whole family
of Barbary Apes were sitting in the trees near or on the roofs of
the out-buildings of the little Inn at the head of the Gorge,
some were so tame that they would take food from the hand.
I saw a good many small birds, among them, I believe the
Yellow Bunting, a rather uncommon bird, a Kestrel was flying
about some rocks, I just caught sight of a Martin, which, from
the locality, was probably a Rock Martin. I was very anxious
to see something more of the Grey-rumped Rock Doves I had
seen here before, but I only saw a pair flying along the face of
the cliff, which did not give me time to make much examination ;
however, I received confirmation that Rock Doves with ashy or
bluish-coloured rumps do occur not unfrequently in this region.
Unfortunately it turned very wet when I was at the Gorge, so I
was able to see very little of the birds.
The next day was Sunday. In the afternoon I walked up
to the old Chasba above the town ; the tall Eucalyptus trees were
full of Serin Finches singing their cheerful little songs ; every
now and then a bird would give a little flight straight up into
the air and return to the same branch; theie were also some
brown birds among them, Linnets I think, a Blackcap was bath-
ing in a ditch, House Sparrows were numerous. A little later

on I saw some Mistle Thrushes under some trees, and in a garden
among Orange and Lemon trees I saw a Robin looking almost as
fearless as at home, while Blackcaps and Sparrows flew about the
trees. I went on again to the Jardin d'Essai, but only identified
more Blackcaps and Blackbirds; this was a lovely day. All the
Sparrows seen clearly in Algiers were certainly domeslicus. Left
early next morning and reached Bougie about the middle of the
afternoon in brilliant sunshine. I at once started for a walk in
the direction of Cape Carbon, a rocky promontory jutting out
into the sea ; I noticed many Serins, a Robin, heard and saw
Blackbirds, saw a bird, apparently a large Falcon, dip down
behind a rock ; in the direction of an old fort, over the sea,
were circling what appeared to be a pair of Ospreys ( Pandion
haliaetus ), but they were a good way off. Ultramarine Tils and
Algerian Chaffinches were numerous among the trees, and a
Barbary Partridge got up almost under my feet from amongst
some rocks overlooking the sea. Just as it was getting dusk I
came to the base of a great cliff, Barbary Partridges were calling
on the lower slopes; high up an Irby's Raven (jCorvus corax tingi-
tanus ) was heard, and presently I made it out silhouetted against
the sky as it sat 011 a rocky point, and looking no bigger than a
Starling, it began to soar round above the cliffs, and was joined
by three others ; then one flew into a small cave, and I thought
I heard the voices of young ones. A Falcon flew into a cleft of
the Rock ; the Falcon found inhabiting the cliffs of the Mediter-
ranean Region is frequently the Lesser Peregrine (Falco panic us),
so that birds seen here may well have belonged to that race. A
Kestrel made its appearance, uttering shrill cries whenever a
Raven flew near to where, doubtless, it had its nest ; all this was
so interesting that I could not tear myself away until it was
nearly dark. During a short walk next morning I only saw
House Sparrows, a pair of Linnets by a Prickly Pear hedge, a
Robin in a Fig tree by the road-side and a White Wagtail.
Left Bougie just after 9 a.m. for the two days' drive to
Setif; just after leaving the town saw two White Storks, as this
was just the time when these fine birds were arriving for the
summer, Martins, a Hawk, a large Bird of Prey in the distance,
perhaps a Black Kite. The road passes for some distance through

Mr. T. H. Newman,
vineyards which were still quite bare of leaves ; numerous flocks
of Goldfinches, Serins and Algerian Chaffinches were observed
among the vines. Lunch was taken at Cap Okras outside a little
inn overlooking the sea; a pair of large Birds of Prey were
circling round, they seemed to be the Desert Buzzard (Buteo
desertoruni), they finally settled in some trees. In the immediate
neighbourhood there were House Sparrows, Cirl Buntings,
Algerian Chaffinches and a small flock of White Wagtails. I
also came across an Algerian Coal Tit (Pams ledouci), a bright
coloured form, having the cheeks, nuchal spot and under-surface
lemon yellow. A pretty sight was afforded by a pair of (I think)
Willow-Wrens (Phylloscopus trochilus ) fluttering about a small
Apricot tree in full bloom. I very often saw little greenish
Warblers with more or less yellow superciliary stripes and under-
parts, but cannot be sure if they were Willow or Wood Wrens,
though I have noted that some seemed yellower below than
others, and these birds I have called Wood Wrens. Continuing
the drive through the magnificent Cliabet Pass, where Algerian
Chaffinches seemed to be the commonest bird. At one place a
party of Barbary Apes ran across the road just in front and
scrambled up the rocks. The next day I saw nothing very re-
markable ; House Sparrows had nests in trees by the side of the
road, a long distance from any house, while Blackbirds, Corn
Buntings, Larks and Goldfinches were very common, many Irby's
Ravens, at one spot a large flock soaring over a hill ; one gets so
used to seeing this bird that one thinks no more of them than
Rooks at home, this familiar bird being absent from North-West
Africa. Several White Storks, the first nest seen being in a tree
near a farm building.
On arrival at Setif, train was taken to Constantine, which
was reached by eight in the evening. The Arab portion of this
town is a very favourite nesting resort of the White Stork ; on
the afternoon of the next day (March 16th) I counted eighteen of
these birds, all within a small area, sitting on or near their nests
placed on corners or projections on the flat roofs of the houses.
It was au interesting sight to see so many of these birds together,
every now and then one would fly up to its mate sitting on its
nest, when both birds would throw their heads back and, with

bills pointing upwards, vigorously clap their mandibles together,
this noise can be heard quite a long distance off, I often heard it
when the birds themselves were out of sight. Just outside the
Gorge, which runs round the greater part of the town, I saw an
Egyptian Vulture ( Neophron percnopterus ) on the wing, and in the
Gorge itself six more, four sitting together on a ledge of rock ; I
believe they nest here as one was seen a few days earlier carrying
a stick just outside. Jackdaws were here in numbers, a peculiar
interest is attached to these birds, for many of them, apparently
about two-thirds of the entire number, are of a very distinct
brown shade, especially on the wings and tail, some were quite a
rich chocolate colour, matching exactly the dark-brown soil on
which they were walking. I thought these brown birds seemed
rather smaller than the others, they certainly had very little grey
on the back of the head, but at this early date I do not think they
could have been young birds ; I find these brown birds have been
noticed by several people who have lately visited this ravine.
Kestrels were, as usual, very numerous here, they are mostly
Lesser Kestrels (Falco naumannt), but I made out several of the
common species ( F . tinnunculus&amp;apos;) quite clearly. I11 a small tree,
at the end of the Gorge, several small Warblers were very busy ;
from their greyish upper surface, yellowish rump and whitish
under parts I took them for Bonelli's Warblers ( Phylloscopus
bonelli).
Next morning I took a lovely walk in the neighbourhood of
the town. The Sparrows seemed mostly to be typical domesticus ,
but one was rather chestnut 011 the crown, and had some black
spreading slightly along the sides of the breast, so seemed to
approach hispaniolensis. On some rough steep ground were flocks
of Goldfinches and many Corn Buntings ; by a bridge over the
river Rumel were a number of Swallows, they looked like young
birds as they had not much chestnut on the head and had rather
short tails ; with them was one House Martin and I think a Sand
Martin, but I could not see this bird quite plainly, so it may have
been a Rock Martin. A number of little greenish Warblers were
hopping about the bushes by the side of the water, frequently
darting over the surface to catch flies--they seemed to be Willow
Wrens. A little later I saw a pair, the cock of which had a very

yellow throat and breast, so they may have been Wood Wrens
(.Phylloscopus sibilatrix). A graceful little greyish bird with a
longish tail, which it raised above its back like a Dartford
Warbler, was hopping about at the base of a small bush, I took
it for a Marmora's Warbler ( Melizophilus sard us), an interesting
species said to be of very local distribution. I also saw several
Blackcaps, a couple of common Starlings, an Ultramarine Tit,
some Kestrels and a few Irby's Ravens ; turning across some
fields I met with some Barks, which appeared to be the Greater
Small-billed Crested Lark (Galerida tlieklce majo&amp;gt; ) which is a very
dark form found mostly in hilly country in the north. Birds
seem plentiful round Constantine, and I have no doubt would
well repay a few days spent in their study in the neighbourhood,
as interesting species might be met with. Unfortunately I had
to hurry on and left at midday ; as the El Kantara bridge over the
Gorge was crossed, on the way to the station, several Egyptian
Vultures could be seen flying in the distance, and just before
stepping into the train, a Stork was noticed soaring aloft, it
alighted on a tall chimney ; from the train many more were seen,
as many as eight together in a marshy field. Several nests were
seen built in trees, one quite low, on another tree were two close
together each with its attendant pair of birds; an Egyptian
Vulture on the ground, while many Kestrels and Larks were
also noted.
Batna was reached about six o'clock. I was awakened by
the chattering of Storks and found a pair had a nest on the top
of the cupola of the Church tower, just opposite my windows ;
several others were near, but they were not so numerous as at
Constantine. Most of the day was taken up by the long tedious
drive to and from Timgad. Many Larks were seen in the open
country, among them, I believe, the Calandra ( Melanocorypha
calandra ), a large species with a conspicuous black patch on each
side of the breast, a few Kestrels, many Irby's Ravens, a White
Wagtail. A pair of Storks had their nest on the top of the old
Roman arch at Markoura, near Lambessa, which is passed on the
way, At Timgad itself I only noticed a cock Black Redstart
(Ruticilla titys ) and a pair of Moussier's Redstarts ( Diplootoncs
vioussieri) flying about the deserted houses ; this lovely little bird
delights to resort to the neighbourhood of ruins during the

breeding season. The Sparrows here were certainly House, not
Tree, as I formerly thought they might be. A short walk next
morning round Batna only revealed Sparrows, Corn Buntings
and Ravens. I watched a Stork bring a big stick to its nest
where its mate was sitting, both birds then took some time to
arrange it comfortably. In the extensive forests near Batna such
interesting birds as the Algerian Black-headed Jay, the Algerian
forms of the Pied and Green Woodpeckers and Bonelli's Eagle
may be met with.
Batna was left about ten, and El Kantara reached at mid-
day. This is a delightful place, just on the edge of the desert ; a
great variety of birds may be met with, as, on the one hand,
there are the mountains, and on the other, the extensive Date
Palm groves. The Hon. Walter Rothschild and Dr. Hartert
were collecting here, I saw some of the birds they had got, in-
cluding a fine hen Bearded Vulture ( Gypaetus bar bains&amp;apos;) shot on
her nest the day I was there ; the nest contained an addled egg
and a newly-hatched young bird, an attempt was going to be
made to bring it up by hand. I could not help regretting the
death of the parent bird, and remembered the pleasure given me
by the sight of one of these noble birds on the wing at the ChifFa
Gorge on my first visit. I spent the next day (March 20th) in a
stiff climb up the mountains. On the way up I saw several pairs
of Black Chats (Saxicola leucura), the cocks sitting on the big
boulders pouring out their short, cheerful songs; I expect they
were nesting. On my former visit, at the beginning of Dec. 1909,
I saw these birds lower down, but now they all seemed to have
gone up the mountains to breed. A familiar little sandy-coloured
Lark was very common, they were mostly in pairs running about
among the stones 011 the hillside, they were probably the Algerian
Desert Lark (. Ammomanes deserti atgeneusis ). I climbed up to the
top of the mountain, which was fairly flat and covered with grass,
here I saw what I took for a Barbary Falcon ( Falco barbarus ), a
Kestrel, Ultramarine Tits, and the only Blue Rock Thrush
(Monticola cyanus ) I met with for certain, perched on the rocks
at the extreme summit. O11 my first visit this bird was quite
common below near the Palms. A Golden Eagle's nest contain-
ing eggs was found close to this spot about a week later, but I saw

Mr. C. Barnby Smith,
nothing of the birds. The next day was very hot, I spent most
of it wandering among the Palm Gardens. Flying about the
rocks in the Gorge I saw several Kestiels, I believe both the
Common and Lesser occur here. I found Serins everywhere
pouring out their energetic little twitterings. I heard a loud,
whistling note from among the Palms, very likely the voice of
the Blue Rock Thrush. I saw one or two birds which I think
were Thrushes, one Swallow, a White Wagtail, a flock of Gold-
finches, a Robin by some water among the Palms, also a few
Ultramarine Tits. At the Red Village, House Sparrows were
numerous, there were several House Buntings {Fringillarict
Sahara) on the outskirts, but at the smaller Black Village this
charming little bird was very common and tame, some of the
cock birds were singing away on the top of the mud walls, some
of their notes rather resembling those of a Canary ; at one place
I came across some cpiite away from the houses. Mr. Rothschild
told me that on a former visit he found a colony of Tree Creepers
right in the middle of the Palms, not at all the sort of place
where one would expect to find this species. I was glad to hear
that the Chough is still to be met with in the mountains. I
left El Kantara in the evening for Biska.

ANOTHER NESTING FAILURE :
THE RUFOUS-THROATED TREE PARTRIDGE.
By C. Barnby Smith.

Watching birds at their nests is of great interest to me and
I considered myself fortunate when, during the holidays last
Easter, I was able to place a hammock chair in the garden in
such a position that I could see the nests of (i) Cayenne Spur-
winged Plover, (2) Satyra Tragopan Pheasant, and (3) the Rufous-
throated Tree Partridge ( Arboricola rufigulatisj. It is of the
Partridge nest only that I am now writing notes.
As long ago as the end of last February, I noticed two of
these birds (then in a run with Tragopan Pheasants) very busy
pulling long pieces of grass about, and one feeding the other and

whistling at intervals, which they never do except in the spring.
I at once fetched my landing net and moved the Partridges into
a small run to themselves, the ground being covered with old
tussocks of grass and a small shelter shed (with sanded floor)
being provided at one end of the run, also several branches for
perches outside. I gave the birds for nesting purposes a lot of
dried grass both outside and inside the shed.
About 10th March nearly all the dried grass inside the shed
was moved from one corner to another and formed into a covered
nest, the bottom of the nest being a hollow scooped out in the
sand. Apparently this nest was not pleasing to the birds and
they were soon seen very busy pulling about the dried grass I
had provided outside the shed.
By the iSth March they had completed a second nest--a
curious domed structure. The back of the nest was a large tuft
of grass, the nest itself being a rather deep large hollow in the
ground lined with grass and covered all over (except the entrance
hole in the side opposite the tuft) with a large mass of dried grass.
On the 26th March I saw one of the birds go into the nest and
stay some considerable time, the other bird staying by the
entrance. The bird in the nest ultimately came out looking very
wretched with feathers all standing out. I guessed she was egg-
bound. She, the same day, afterwards laid an egg near the door
of the run, away from the nest. I picked this egg up in a spoon
and carefully placed it in the nest. The Partridges kept going in
and out of the nest at intervals but without laying any more eggs,,
until 2nd of April when I discovered a second egg. It was in-
teresting to note how careful the birds were during the nesting
period to put dried grass from time to time so as to nearly block
up the entrance at the side of the nest when not in use. The
result of this was excellent as when one of the birds had just
emerged from the nest the round hole would strike the eye but,
when partly blocked with grass, the nest was practically invisible.
From the 2nd to the 7th April the weather was simply awful--
frost and blizzards. On the 6th April the entrance to the nest
was covered with snow. On the following day, one of the birds
entered the nest and cleared out the grass in the entrance, which
was left open until the 10th, when it was again blocked. On the

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99026259375" page_id="9404296"  page_num="296" year="" vol="">
on the 13th a third egg was laid. On the 15th one of the three
eggs in the nest was brought outside by the birds and broken, and
on the same day I noticed a soft egg which had been laid some
distance from the nest. O11 the following day another egg was
laid in the nest and one bird began to sit. On the 23rd I found
another egg laid outside the nest and I began strongly to suspect,
what afterwards proved to be the fact, that both my birds were
liens.
A few days later the bird that had been laying outside
elongated the nest on the entrance side, bringing a good deal of
dried grass for the purpose, and soon afterwards joined the other
bird in sitting in the nest. Both birds continued to sit like
stones for some time and when I finally disturbed the nest I found
four eggs in it.
These eggs were white and measured 1.6 by 1.2 inches.
I was, of course, greatly disappointed that my birds were
not a true pair, as their nesting habits and the habits of the young
seem little known.
The Rufous-throated Tree Partridge comes from Mount
Mooleyit in Tenasserim, and should any member of the Avi-
cultural Society happen to be passing in that direction and be
able to bring back a cock, I will gladly let him have one of my
hens in the hope that successful nesting results may ensue.
In conclusion, I may mention that these Tree Partridges
are absolutely hardy (sleeping out in the open during the most
severe weather without suffering) and they are easily kept on
grain, without any insect food, although they much relish this
whenever they can get it.
They are very active and sprightly birds and scratch about
constantly with the greatest vigour, far more than any other Tree
Partridges I know. They seldom perch during the daytime but
always roost a good height from the ground.

SOME EXPERIENCES OF AN AVICULTURIST.
By Archibald Simpson,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9971552" page_id="9404297"  page_num="297" year="" vol="">
I fear I am unable to add anything to the sum of knowledge
already possessed by those who have made aviculture either a
scientific pursuit or a mere hobby, but it has been stated by more
than one writer on the subject that it is often possible to learn
something from the non-success of others, in which case the
present article may be justified as it certainly furnishes a most
unhappy record of failure.
I have kept foreign birds continuously for the past fifteen
years, but a limited purse has confined my experience to the
commoner varieties; indeed had the lovely corpses which have
passed through my hands represented the expensive sorts I
should now be a charge on the Parish funds. Nevertheless, I
have derived more real pleasure from this form of extravagance
than I could have got from a like expenditure in other directions*
and therefore I ought to be satisfied.
It has been a painful surprise that my efforts to induce
birds to bteed have not met with a larger reward, but the fact
must be chronicled that I have been singularly unlucky, as not-
withstanding my feathered friends have had suitable food, ample
accommodation and freedom from disturbing influences they
have rarely got beyond eggs.
I originally started with an indoor aviary, devoting a large
room to the purpose, which was fitted up in the most approved
fashion, the walls being covered with twiggy branches from dead
trees, washed river sand spread on.the floor to a depth of one inch
or so, provision being made for possible nesting by a plentiful
supply of cokeruut husks, boxes and small wicker cages, arranged
about the room at such spots as appeared to me to be most
seductive. Barge shallow earthenware dishes were filled with,
white and Indian millet and Canary seeds and a self-filling water
fountain, also lumps of rock salt and fine oyster shell grit com-
pleted the commissariat department. The room was lighted from
the top by a skylight which could be opened, and indeed was
only closed in winter, the aperture being covered with wire
netting to prevent the escape of even the smallest bird. The

Mr. Archibald Simpson,
floor area of the aviary was 12ft. by 9ft., and in due course the
room was tenanted by pairs of the following :--Cockatiels, Bud-
gerigars. Grey Singing Finches, Golden Breasted Waxbills,
Zebra, Double Banded and Fire Finches, Cordon Blens, Bronze-
winged Mannikins, Gonldians and Long-tailed Grass Finches,
with odd cocks of Orange, Napoleon and Yellow Weavers and
Paradise Whydahs, and the finest pair of Red Crested Cardinals
I have ever seen, which were obtained from a former lady member
of our Society in exchange for Canaries.
It was quite evident to me from the first that my bird-room
was too crowded to expect breeding to be the success I desired,
and after a time I found myself able to devote two rooms to the
purpose in hand, having in the meantime removed to a somewhat
larger house, and I therefore separated the Parrakeets and larger
birds from the others.
I ran these two aviaries for about four years, and was so
badly affected by bird-fever that I had no time for annual holidays,
always supposing that the state of my finances was such as would
have admitted of my taking them, which was far from being the
case, as the Railway Delivery Van was to be found at my door
two or three times per week, regularly throughout the year,
depositing small boxes which, on examination, were found to
contain specimens of birds in no particular corresponding with
the glowing advertisement which had been responsible for their
arrival. They sometimes lived sufficiently long to regard me as
their food purveyor, but very often "passed in their checks"
within a few hours.
I am afraid my friends regarded me as having had a bad
mental twist, and the partner of my joys and sorrows was at her
wits end to find a more sociable and less costly hobby for her
husband and, at the same time, one which did not involve such
nasty messes. I admit it must have been particularly distressing
to the orderly feminine mind to be constantly finding mealworms
on the drawing-room carpet, and maggots would sometimes take
excursions into the best bedroom, but it needed more than con-
siderations of this sort to lure me from the avian cult.
My note-book at this period contains some interesting
*details in regard to my purchases. I find that in order to secure

one pair of healthy Cordons I bought no fewer than twenty-eight
birds within four months, and then I had a "find." I saw an
advertisement of one of the dealers announcing "the arrival of
Cordon Bleus in finest condition and health," and I wrote re-
questing a true pair to be sent. In due course they arrived and
their appearance gave me the greatest satisfaction ; they were as
tightly-feathered as a Java Sparrow and in the pink of health,
but 1 noticed neither of the two had the crimson crescent check
mark of the cock Cordon and I wrote to the dealer pointing out
that he had sent me two hens. His reply was to the effect that
he was certain one of them was an immature cock, and I accepted
his statement. Within a fortnight these birds had built a nest
and four eggs were deposited. The nest was cleverly concealed
near the ceiling behind a few twigs nailed to the wall, but I was
able to see that one or other of the birds was constantly on the
nest. This went on for about three weeks, until at last I found
myself unable to resist a desire to investigate how matters were
progressing, and I therefore examined the nest without however
touching it; the eggs were there still and, of course, I was then
quite certain that they were clear. On breaking the eggs after-
wards I found that two or three, I am not sure which, contained
dead young, which at once settled the debateable point as to my
having a true pair, and the coloured illustration accompanying
the article by Mr. Phillipps in Vol. I., No. 4 (New Series) of the
Avicultural Magazine proved to me that I had been in possession
of the comparatively rare Blue-Breasted Waxbill. They never
again attempted to nest, although they lived with me for about
eighteen months, both subsequently dying from some kind of fit,
at least I suspect this to have been the cause as they were plump
and in good feather to the last.
My experience of these birds confirms in one or two
particulars the observations of Mr. Phillipps, in respect of the
difference in size and colouring between the Cordon Bleus and
Blue-Breasts. It must be remembered that, at the time, I did
not know that my birds were not Cordons, and I constantly
remarked how much brighter and bigger they were than others
I had at the same time, but I am ashamed to say that I did not
detect the difference in the colouring of the bills of the two

varieties, but I did notice that the male Blue Breast had a larger
area of blue than the cock Cordon, and also that there was a
very marked difference in the extent of the brown underparts of
the hen Blue Breast, the corresponding area in the hen Cordon
being much smaller.
To return to my notes. I have entries showing that out of
sixteen Fire Finches bought within six weeks only one lived
beyond a fortnight, the exception being a bird much deeper in
colouring and with a greater number of white spots on the sides
and was heavier in build than the others, but as I made no actual
measurements I cannot give comparative figures. I kept this
bird over two years and had innumerable mates for him, ail of
which died within a few weeks of my obtaining them. I believe
this bird was a Peter's Fire Finch from the description and
coloured plate furnished with a later number of the Magazine.
Lavender Finches also gave me trouble: I bought them in dozens
but could not get a single one to live beyond six or eight weeks,
a great disappointment to me as I regarded them with something
akin to affection, in much the same way as I do the timid little
Grey Singing Finch. Speaking of the latter recalls to my mind
the first occasion on which they bred in my indoor aviary. A
pair had a nest and had hatched out one young bird immediately
beneath the squatting place of a pair of Common Avadavats,
who, apparently resenting the propinquity of their neighbours,
raided their demesne and dislodged the nestling on the very
morning of its appearance. I found it on the floor quite cold
and to all appearances dead, but, to my astonishment, the warmth
of my hands revived it, and after repairing the nest, which had
been partly demolished by the combatants, I replaced the young
bird, at the same time destroying the roosting place of the
aggressors, and to my delight the Greys returned to their charge
and successfully reared the youngster. This at least taught me
not readily to abandon hope even when the odds appear against
one. I am never without several examples of this little Finch,
and have probably given more attention to it than to any other
species. I find they are fairly hardy after getting over the
" importation sickness," but they are very much disposed to eye
trouble which manifests itself in one or two ways. Sometimes

the locality of the eyelids swells to such an extent as to com-
pletely conceal the eye, and it remains in this condition for a
week or more, in spite of constant bathing of the parts with
Boracic acid dissolved in hot water and allowed to cool. At
other times a waxy exudence shows itself round the eye lid, but
if taken in time yields quickly to the same treatment.
With regard to the singing qualities of this bird there can
be no two opinions, when heard at its best it much resembles the
Skylark, but of course it has neither the volume or the variety
of notes of the latter, but it is none the less a charming songster.
I have found a very great difference in individuals, having
possessed some that were very free singers and others somewhat
shy. I have one at the present time which, although I have had
him for upwards of twelve months, has only sung three or four
times to my knowledge, but is incessantly calling to his mate.
He bred last year, but the young disappeared mysteriously from
the nest. I blamed mice.
I must not overlook the remark made somewhere by Dr.
Butler in regard to a statement made to him by the late Mr.
Joseph Abrahams who had said that when a Grey Singing Finch
was actually singing "he showed a white spot 011 the throat." I
seem to remember Dr. Butler saying he had looked in vain for
this white spot. I can only hope that so careful an observer as
the worthy Doctor has now found it, as it certainly is present in
most individuals, and shows to greater advantage in old cocks
whose plumage is generally darker on the surface. The action of
the throat parts the outer feathers, exposing the downy feathers
underneath which show up in the form of a small round patch.
This spot is quite distinct in two or three specimens I have at
the moment, although their plumage has undergone no change
due to age.
Golden-breasted Waxbills have always been great favourites
with me, and experience has led me to believe the cock bird
is shorter lived than the hen, as out of eight pairs I have not had
a single case where the former has outlived his partner purchased
at the same time. The most satisfactory pair I ever possessed
lived with me for about three years, and during that time I must
have had dozens of eggs laid in a small wicker cage in which

they had made a nest. I found them exceedingly nervous sitters,
bolting from the nest each time I entered the room. I never got
beyond eggs, although many of them were fertile, perhaps had
the room been a heated one I might have been more successful.
The colouring in the male bird is much brighter in the breeding
season than at other times, the change taking place without
apparent loss of feathers. I advise beginners never to buy newly
imported specimens during the winter months; they are almost
certain to die within a few weeks.

The most interesting recent event in the way of breeding
has been the hatching and rearing of a young Brazilian Cariama
(Cariama cristata) which has taken place in the Eastern Aviary,
as mentioned last month. The young bird was hatched on June
7th, in a nest some eight or ten feet from the ground. A plat-
form of sticks had been fixed up. and the pair of Cariamas
formed upon this a nest of twigs, straw and any rubbish they
could obtain. The two eggs, one of which got broken, were
about the size of those of a common fowl. From a distance
they appeared white, but, as a rule, the eggs of this species are
thinly spotted with reddish. Incubation lasted 28 or 30 days,
and the chick when hatched was covered with down of a huffish
brown colour. The parents were supplied with chopped butcher's
meat, chopped hard-boiled egg, mice, cut into small portions,
and cockroaches.
The food was taken to the nest in the parents' bill and
bolted whole by the young bird, which left the nest on July 6th,
when just a month old.
The photographs here reproduced, show the young bird
at this stage. It has since developed more distinct striping on
the back of the neck and mottling of brown on the wing
coverts.

of birds brought home by Mr. Frost and presented to the Zoo-

logical Society by Mr. K. J. Brook, and I promised to say more
about them this month.
The most interesting of these birds is a pair of Blood
Pheasants ( Ithagenes cruentus ) which are new to the collection.
This species inhabits the high regions of Nepal, Sikhim, and
Western Bhutan. It is very partridge-like in shape and size.
The back is grey, the underparts greenish, the crown reddish
buff, and the throat, underside of tail and some spots on the
breast blood-red. The female is much browner.
The Chestnut-bellied Nuthatch (, Sitta castaneiventris&amp;apos;) is
grey 011 the upper, and deep chestnut on the under surface.
The Yellow-cheeked Tit (Machlolophns xajit ho genes&amp;apos;) has the
back olive green, the cheeks and undersides bright yellow, and
a long tapering black crest.
The Pied Bush Chat ( Pratincola capuita) is black with
white tail-coverts and a white bar on the wing. The Ruby-
throat ( Calliope camtschatkensis) is a most beautiful and striking
bird, olive brown in colour with a brilliant scarlet spot on the
throat.
The Sikhim Siskin ( Chrysomitris tibetana) is chiefly olive
green and yellow in colour, and the Blue-throated Flycatcher
(Cyornis mbeculoides ) is much like a small Nyltava Flycatcher.
All of the above are new to the collection, and besides these
came several which, although not new, are very rare and de-
sirable. There is one Nyltava Flycatcher, a Spotted Wing, two
White-bellied Drongoes, a Verditer Flycatcher, a Hardwick's
and a Green Fruitsucker, a pair of Yellow-eyed Babblers, Ashy-
crowned Finch-larlcs, Silver-eared Mesias, and Orange-headed
and White-tliroated Ground Thrushes.
A few weeks ago a Roseate Cockatoo appeared in the
Gardens and spent most of its time in the Squirrel's and Marmot's
\0x25A0enclosure, where it caused much amusement amongst the visitors
by the quaint way in which it played with the Marmots. I could
see by its dark eye that it was a male, so, as we had a large num-
ber of the same kind in the parrot's aviary, I had a female caught
and placed in a cage in the enclosure. The two made friends at
once, so I opened the door of the cage and watched. Presently
.the bird at liberty flew down from a tree on to the cage, and the

bird inside walked out and climbed up beside its companion,
which promptly commenced to comb its crest with his beak.
Then they both flew away into a neighbouring tree, and were not
seen at all the next day, but the following day they returned to
the squirrels' enclosure to which they now resort daily.
Every evening the pair take long flights round the Garden
uttering their call note repeatedly and exhibiting a rare spectacle
of parrots entirely at large, which is extremely pleasing to watch.

Sir, --The following notes may be of inteiest to your readers. I have
a brood of three Pintailed Sandgrouse just hatched. The father is a son
of the old lien whose death I recoided some time ago, and he (the father) is
twelve years old.
Our pair of Hanging Parrots (Lori cuius gal gains) are nesting, the hen
is sitting in a hole in an old apple tree. .She is quite unapproachable, being
somewhere right down in the trunk ; she has been practically out of sight
for three weeks. Some bark from the tree and dried strips of Ancuba
leaves were taken in as nesting material. The male (who by the bye does
not get full adult plumage until he is two years old) is most solicitous,
he is much smaller than the female. I will report if there is any result. I
fancy this is the first attempt at nesting in this country of these little
parrots. E. G. B. Mkadk-Wai.do.
THE CUCKOO.
[We have received from Dr. Jones a copy of the following letter,
which appeared a short time ago in the Spectator.
To the Editor of the Spectator.
Sir, --Many are the legends about that chief bird of
augury, the Cuckoo, (the husbandman's time-keeper) and many
also are the flowers, which, appearing about this time, take its
name and share its prophetical character. These and the
lugubrious joy of the Wryneck (expressed in the minor key in
its " peep, peep, peep")--a bird usually called the Cuckoo's
mate, more appropriately its "servant," in that it follows its
"master" almost everywhere, and at a respectful distance,--
remind me that just a year ago (May 141I1) you peimitted me to
inform your readers that I had successfully reared a young
male Cuckoo and kept it through the previous winter. As then

stated, my Cuckoo was taken out of a Greenfinch's nest in out-
woods early in August 1909. and was kept (near the window of
a large warm room) in captivity until the onset of the cutting
east winds in the middle of February (last) 1911, when it died
somewhat suddenly, having passed nearly two winters, or more
exactly, a period of eighteen mouths in confinement.
Our Cuckoo completed moulting in January of its second
year, but it began to throw off its nesting feathers in the
previous October, appearing, alter moulting, in its mature
plumage, and almost a different bird--having changed from
brown to a blue-grey.
Its unique winter sojourn under observation has thrown
some light upon its life and habits, also upon the question of
migration. It knew its caretaker (a patient) well, and would
eat minced meat off his hand ; but it was ever timid and fearful
of strangers, fluttering against its cage if anyone unfamiliar
went too near. Although unamiable and often pugnacious, it
was fond of play.
It possessed the germ of its nature--which shows no
love of offspring--in that it never demonstrated affection: It
preferred as food the larvae of lepidopterous insects, but it ate
raw meat with relish, and always refused bread by itself. It
devoured crickets, beetles, flies, spiders, wasps' "eggs," moths
and mealworms.
It crushed beetles in its beak in a very original and
unusual way, turning them round and round until sufficiently
" masticated " when it suddenly swallowed them. It was always
fond of young mice and would peck at them in the cage until
they were insensible and would then devour them whole;
indeed it seemed to be a little hawk-like "after its kind."
Next to the larvae it seemed to enjoy skinned mice. It was
insectivorous as well as carnivorous.
It acquired its piquante vernal song in captivity and was
heard to "cuckoo" quite clearly (see my previous letter)
although at first doubtfully and indistinctly, probably learning
the sound by mimicry from the newly-returned elders of its
race, or possibly from its own parents.
Migration in birds is probably caused by a reaction to

food shortness, but it lias interested many as a miracle or some
unsolved mystery rather than an example of impel feet instinct
supplemented by intelligence. The food theory, however, does
not explain why the males leave in July, as they do, before the
females, unless the latter remain in the face of scarcity to
continue depositing their eggs; nor does it explain why the
males are the first to arrive. The rarity of the whole incident,
and the fact that I received many letters from readers of the
Spectator commenting upon my first letter, induces me to send
the complete account. Robert Jones, M.D.
[In the Zoologist, 1S44, p. 655, there is a note of a Cuckoo that had
been kept in confinement over a winter. The notes given of its food and
disposition agree closely with those given by Dr. Jones. Dr. Jones', how-
ever, began to moult in the October of its second year. The one recorded
in the Zoologist in May, when about twelve months old, and one we kept
commenced its moult in April. So far as we are aware these are the only
recorded instances of this species being kept through the winter in con-
finement. Many have at various times been on exhibition at the Zoological
Gardens, but 110 records of their moult or the age to which they lived are

We have received for notice in this journal the first part of
Volume III. of the second edition of Mr. North's well-known
work 011 the nests and eggs of Australian birds. I11 it the author
deals with the Family Cuculidce and the Sub-family Centropinw ;
the Family Lon&amp;apos;idce and part of the Family Cacatuidcc.
Although primarily concerned, as the title explains, with
the nests and eggs, this work also contains detailed descriptions
of the birds themselves, their distribution and habits.
The author deals exhaustively with his subject, supplying
notes from correspondents in all parts of Australia. The accounts
given of the birds that we are familiar with in captivity here, will
be read with great interest by avicnlturists.

to keep under proper treatment, Mr. North gives some interesting
particulars from which we quote the following:--"When living
at Dobroyde, Ashfield, in 1889, large flocks used to fly over from
February to the middle of April, fairly high in the air, resem-
bling in form a wave or the spray left on a long beach by a
receding wave. These flocks were about three hundred yards in
width, and three or four birds deep, and were travelling from the
south-west to the north-east, and were probably a quarter-of-a-
mile apart. They could be seen at almost any time of the day,
from early morning until nearly sunset. Numbers of these birds
were allured and caught by means of a captive call-bird in a cage
and a snare pole. The trap consists of a long pole about twenty
feet long, which is placed in a socket, and has at the top one or
two thin forked limbs, which fairly bristle with liorse-hair nooses.
A pulley is usually attached, so that the cage containing the call
or decoy bird can be lowered as required.It seems strange
that these birds, when once they alight on one of these poles,
repeatedly come back until they are eventually entangled in one
of the many horse-hair nooses with which the forked extremity
of the snare-pole is covered. These poles may be seen as one
passes through from Paramatta to Petersham, even from the
window of a railway carriage, and are usually erected in yards
and gardens, and attended to by school children or the average
boy. The number caught in a day varies; I met one boy who
informed me that he had caught one hundred and twenty.''
We can very strongly recommend Mr. North's book to all
who are interested in Australian birds. One of its best features
consists in the numerous field-notes from reliable sources.

in the early pait of the 19th Centuiy. Temmiiick, Provost and
Bonaparte all gave us fine illustrated volumes. But we have not
waited in vain : it has never before been the writer's privilege to
find in any book devoted to birds, such careful attention given
to all the little details which go to the making of success, every-
thing is carefully explained ; for example, not only are we told
that the birds like biscuits and pea nuts, but we learn the best
methods of preparing these articles and where to get them ;
attention is also called to the fact that many Doves are un-
doubtedly partly insectivorous; only a few years ago a new
species of Haplopelia was recorded in The Ibis as having a large
number of gnats in its gizzard.
The first chapter gives details of the author's aviaries,
which will be found of great value, as showing the sort of
enclosures best suited to the requirements of Doves and Pigeons.
The next two chapters give accounts of the arrangements for
nesting purposes, the best way of sending birds away, many
valuable hints are given as to the best treatment for sick birds,
and good methods for handling a bird, for everyone who has held
a Dove or Pigeon knows how hard it is not to pull out a handful
of feathers.
The bulk of the book is taken up by concise accounts of
some forty species, all of which have been kept by the author,
each account is conveniently arranged under headings : " Habitat,
Length, Colouring, Wild Life, Life in Captivity," so that any
particular point can be referred to without having to read through
the whole article.
On the last page but one, mention is made of a"Frau-
cisian " Dove, which would appear to be the rarely-imported
Chanicepelia cruziana, better known as the Garnet-banded Ground-
dove, while the so-called "Malayan Ring-doves" are evidently
the handsome and rare Double-ringed Turtle-dove {Turtur biior-
quaius).
The book is profusely illustrated, mostly by excellent
photographs taken by the author, most careful acknowledgment
being made when this is not the case. Perhaps the book would
have been improved in appearance and been more handy if it
had been 8vo. size, the one or two full-page illustrations of
aviaries would only have had to be very slightly reduced.

<bodyText confidence="0.9897494375" page_id="9404311"  page_num="309" year="" vol="">
The chief interest of this periodical is, as usual, a large
number of short notes recording the presence of rare species
within our islands.
Articles deal with the Crossbills as a British Bird, Positions
assumed in Flight, and the Migration of the White Stork, this
last being an account of the results of the ringing at Rossiten
referred to in our pages last Sept., Ser. 3, Vol. I., p. 336. The
longest and most important article is one by Messrs. N. F.Ticeliurst
and Jourdain on the "Distribution of the Nightingale in Great
Britain." These writers have gone into the matter at great length
and have accumulated notes from observers in the different coun-
ties ; as a result they show that the distribution of this species is in
the main defined by land over 1,oooft., which apparently it cannot
cross. That its distribution agrees roughly with the low lying
portion of England is an undoubted fact, though even on this
basis there seems no reason why it should not occur on the
Eastern border of Northumberland, the North coast of Devon or
Pembrokeshire, all of which lie in its line of migration with no
intervening high land, from these and other more complex
reasons we are inclined to doubt whether the conclusions drawn
are justified by the facts. If their conclusions were right, its
distribution in Europe should also agree roughly with the height
of the land although the actual limit of height might be different
in the various latitudes, and a few notes on this matter would
have made their theory more convincing.
In the writer's opinion the distribution of this bird at
present is merely defined by its numbers. If the country can for
example support two pairs to an acre and 250 pairs arrive they
will occupy 125 acres in an area represented roughly by a
segment of a circle with their point of entry as centre. In some

years we should expect to find their range extended when from
favourable conditions a larger number of birds arrived in the
country, and this would account for the scattered stragglers
occasionally found beyond the normal borders of its range. In
years of scarcity on the other hand the diminution in numbers
would naturally first occur towards the periphery of its distribu-
tion and these details are confirmed to our mind in the map
shown.
There is also another reason for taking this view. At
least three other species, the Red-backed Shrike, Wryneck and
Turtle Dove enter this country by a similar route to the Nightin-
gale, they are all of limited distribution in our islands and their
distribution is, at the same time, on precisely similar lines. The
Red-backed Shrike does not reach quite as far as the Nightingale,
the Wryneck rather further, while the Turtle Dove, whose range
is increasing yearly, reaches furthest of all. But there are also
species that are only known in England from scarce stragglers to
our South-Eastern coasts. The Tawny Pipit and Great Reed
Warbler, these probably arriving along similar lines, stop short
at the neighbouring shores of France. It cannot be argued that
they dare not cross the Channel since they cross the Mediterran-
ean and the coast on either shore is very similar. The cause of
this limitation may still be open to doubt but these cases must be
borne in mind before we decide that a i,oooft. will form an
insuparable barrier to a Nightingale. J. L. B.
OBITUARY.
On the 25th March, after an illness of only a few hours'
duration, our member Col. G. A. Momber died at San Remo,
Italy, where he had resided for the past nine years. Born in i860,
he served many years in the Militia and saw active service in
South Africa in 1900 with the Remounts. He was devoted to an
open-air life, to hunting and farming; throughout his life a
student and lover of birds, he became in later life a keen
aviculturist. By the English colony at San Remo he was highly

unflagging devotion with which he carried on the work of the
Field Club, the Sports Club and the Society for the Protection of
Animals. The delightful articles which he contributed to our
Magazine will be fresh in the recollection of our members.
Col. Momber was especially interested in European birds
and in measures for their protection, and, in collaboration with
Mr. H. A. Macpherson, wrote a Prize Essay on this subject. His
very last contribution to our Magazine was a plea for the better
protection of the Common Quail. Col. Momber was also a
collector of books and well read in Philosophy--in fact he was
an all round man--and his loss will be keenly felt by all those
who knew and estimated at their proper value his services to
aviculture and the cause of the preservation of the rapidly
vanishing European Fauna. W. E. T.

The Starlings of the World divide naturally into three
tolerably well-defined families--the NewWorld Starlings ( Icleridce )
which appear to be related on the one side to the larger Weaver-
birds and on the other to the Old World Starlings ; the Old World
Starlings ( Sturnidce ) with the exception of the true Grackles,
between which and the Ic ter idee they form an intermediate group,
and lastly the Grackles ( Eulabetidce ) which are nearer to the
Bower-birds and Crows in general appearance and outline.
In the first of these families the bill of the male is gener-
ally markedly longer than in the female, and the bastard primary,
though well-developed, is shorter than its coverts and is therefore
called a remicle. In the second family the difference in length
of bill in the sexes is much less marked and sometimes hardly
appreciable, but the bastard primary is longer than its coverts.
From the latter family the Eulabetidce (represented by Eulabes
only) are readily separable by the remarkable difference of width
in the bills of male and female, the heavy, far more Crow-like,
character of the bird, and its possession of both face-wattles and
neck-lappets : it is also a group of hopping birds.
I have thought it necessary to mention these points,
because the affinities of groups have some relation both to their
food and nidification : thus the Ideridce, which come nearest to the
Finches, are, as regards some of their members, seed-eaters to a
greater extent than either the Stuinidce or the Eulabetidce ; more-
over they contain species with finch-like beaks, and one species

--the Bobolink, which assumes a special nuptial plumage, after
the manner of Weavers of the genus Pyromelana. In their
nidification the let a idee are quite as varied as the Finches, both
with respect to the position and character of their nests; much
more so, indeed, than the Siurnidce , the majority of which breed
in holes: the Eulabetidce also build their nests in holes.
If one wishes to breed these birds, it is of course necessary
to acquaint oneself with their natural methods of nidification ;
and, as nearly every group of the Icteridce has its own method, it
will be necessary to consider each separately. So far few attempts
have been made to breed the New World Starlings in captivity,
owing probably to the difficulty of securing both sexes, so that
they offer a very promising field of enterprise to aviculturists.
The imported Icteridce are referable to five sub-families, the
first of which Agelcenince includes the Meadow Starlings and
Marsh Troupials, Maize-eaters, and Cow-birds, all of which can
be kept upon a seed-diet ; but the more slender-billed forms, for
which I have reinstated the generic name Agelasticus, do not live
long upon that food, but need to be treated like Bulbuls, Tanagers
and other fruit-eating insectivorous birds; they also differ from
the broader billed species in their more confiding nature, which
renders them suitable subjects for keeping in roomy cages,
whereas the Bobolink and other Meadow Starlings as well as the
Cowbirds require a moderate-sized aviary to render them happy.
The soft food which I supply to all my insectivorous birds
and which I have found more successful than any other in
keeping them in health for many years, consists of two parts
crumb of stale household bread, one part chicken-meal ground
in a coffee-mill, one part Trowel's "Improved Cekto " and one
part hard-boiled egg passed through a metal potato masher : I
mix the whole together in a bason and damp with water to a
crumbly consistency. All my Starlings receive a handful of this
mixture daily, together with a quarter of an orange or pear, about
an inch of banana and two or three grapes when obtainable;
strawberries or currants may also be given when they are in
season, and any insects, their larvae or pupae, as well as spiders,
which may come to hand.

finch-like Starlings for a considerable time upon seed alone, I do
not recommend it as an exclusive diet; I think that some at
least of those which I owned in past years would have lived
longer under occasional soft-food treatment: unfortunately some
of these had been brought home upon a seed-diet alone and I
consequently found them unwilling to touch soft food.
The Agelcenincz , with the exception of the Cowbirds, which
are parasitic, construct their nests, as a general rule, on or close
to the ground near water; or in reeds, rushes and other aquatic
plants over water ; one or two however place their nests in low
trees or bushes, or even on the leaf-sheaths of palms. Attempts
have been made to breed Cowbirds by turning them loose among
many other nesting birds, but they did not avail themselves of
the opportunity thus offered of securing foster-parents for their
young.
The StnrnellincB or typical Troupials do best in a moderate-
sized aviary: their natural food consists of seeds and insects and
therefore they are better suited to a seed diet in captivity than
any other Starlings excepting the more fincli-like members of the
preceding Subfamily. I kept De Filippi's Troupial chiefly upon
seed and cockroaches, as I did also the Bobolink, the Red-breasted
Marsli-Troupial, the Brown-headed Meadow-Starling and the
Silky Cowbird : I also attempted to keep the Yellow-shouldered
Marsh-Troupial 011 the same diet, because it did not take kindly
to soft food, but my later experience with the allied Flame-
shouldered species proved this to be a fatal mistake.
The Glossy Black Troupials or American Grackles ( Quis -
calincs) are powerful birds which build open cup-shaped nests
either in dense or shrubby trees, low bushes, reeds, matted grass-
tufts, or holes in trees or banks, usually near to or over water ;
mud is frequently used in the structure. The birds feed not
only upon seeds and fruits, but also upon eggs and young of
other birds, frogs, newts, fish, molluscs, crustaceans, spiders,
insects and worms, so that their diet in captivity should contain
a moderate amount of animal food, shredded raw beef being
*only given when no small dead birds or other vertebrates are
available.
The Cassiques ( Cassicince ) are again large birds, most of

which form pensile purse-like open net-work nests swung from
the brandies of tall trees or rarely large bushes overhanging
water; but the Black Cassique (Cassidix oryzivora ) is parasitic,
laying its eggs in the nests of other species ; the last-mentioned
bird feeds in its wild state upon seeds and insects, but the purse-
builders are all fruit and insect eaters and should be treated like
the typical Hangnests in captivity.
The Hangnests (. Icterince ) construct pensile long, openly
woven, purse-like nests which are suspended from the branches
of trees or bushes; their food consists of fruit, insects, spiders
and worms and in captivity soft food, fruit and an occasional
insect will keep them in perfect health and plumage, until even-
tually they die from sheer old age. These are the most confiding,
clever and attractive in every respect of all the New World
Starlings, and, provided that one could obtain both sexes, there
seems not the least reason why they should not be bred in an
outdoor aviary without difficulty. The sexes are easily distin-
guished, even where the plumage does not differ, owing to the
very marked difference in the length of the bills of male and
female.
It is dangerous to associate the species of Icletus with
other birds, as they have very strong and pointed bills and are
aggressive. When kept in a cage it is not safe to bring one's
face too close to the wirework ; for these birds, like all Starlings,
are attracted by anything bright and might stab one's eyes;
children should therefore be cautioned not to go too near.
The Old World Starlings hitherto imported belong to the
Subfamily Sturnince and, as already stated, mostly nest in holes,
in trees, rocks, or buildings; but the Glossy Starlings of the
genus Calornis construct pensile nests after the manner of the
Icterine species and lay spotted eggs like many of those birds (as
well as other Glossy Starlings) for which reason I regard them as
probably the nearest allies to the New World family.
The species of Calomis feed upon seeds, other vegetable
matter and probably insects ; the African Glossy Starlings also
feed upon fruits, berries, seeds, insects, and of course spiders.
In captivity, therefore, these birds should be treated like the
Icterine Starlings. The typical Starlings (Sint nits) and the Star-

ling-like Mynalis ( Poliopsar , Sturnopastor , Dilophus, Temenuchus,
Graculipica, Acridolheres and Sure ops) can be fed in the same
manner with the addition of earthworms; the species of Acrido-
theres will also eat small mice,* so that it is probable that, in
their wild state, they take toll of some of the smaller reptiles
and batrachians : they are very eager for locusts, grasshoppers,
crickets and cockroaches.
The typical Mynahs or Grackles (Eulabetided) are somewhat
delicate when first imported, or perhaps they are (more often
than not) supplied with too much shredded raw beef for their
good. They feed in their wild state chiefly upon fruits and
berries, though doubtless they also take insect-food, since in
captivity they accept it eageily. The so-called "Hill Mynahs"
should therefore be treated like the species of Icterus, but owing
to their great size and voracious appetites they naturally require
a much more liberal supply both of fruit and soft food.
Apart from the imitative powers of Eulabes I do not
consider them attractive as pets ; they are dull and clumsy in
their movements, dropping from branch to branch with a heavy
hop, even more carefully taken than that of a Satin Bower-bird or
a Crow, to both of which they bear some resemblance in outline.
In my opinion these birds should never be confined in cages ; a
small aviary with the companionship of a few other smaller
birds suits them well. I did not find Eulabes aggressive, it
struck me as too apathetic and lazy to exert itself sufficiently to
be objectionable to other birds, in which respect I should say it
was unlike the Boweibirds and Crows. I do not of course know
what it might do if associated with tiny finches; possibly it
might acquire a taste for feathered food in that case : one cannot
safely prophecy what might or might not happen.
Unless it is intended to breed them, all the smaller Old
World Starlings are better kept in roomy cages, just sufficiently
large to enable them to use their wings and bathe freely.
*My Crested Mynah was very fond of young&amp;apos; mice taken from nests which we discovered
on various occasions.

Distribution.
The Sprosser has a somewhat extensive range, as a breed-
ing species, bnt it cannot be described as an abundant species in
any part of its area. Its eastern limit may be roughly indicated
by an imaginary line drawn from the Caucasus to a point in
Finland a little north of Lake Ladoga. Its exact northern limit
is difficult to determine, but it is not included by Prof. Collett in
liis list of birds of Northern Scandinavia, even as an accidental
visitor, and we shall probably include most or all of its territory
if we carry our imaginary line westwards to Christiania and thence
almost due south to Berne. Its status in Italy is somewhat
doubtful ; Salvadori, Durazzo and Cara have claimed it, but its
occurrence as a nesting species has apparently not been proved.
We will, therefore, carry our imaginary line eastward and south-
ward to the head of the Adriatic and thence to Constantinople.
Bree ("Birds of Europe") includes Persia as a part of the range
of this species, but, seeing that he calls the Sprosser the " Eastern
Nightingale " and does not recognise D. golzii as distinct, he is
probably referring to the latter species.
Allied Species.
In Germany, Austria, Turkey and Southern Russia the
Sprosser comes into contact with a near relative--the Nightingale
of the West (D. Inscinia). In Germany they seem to have
divided up their territory fairly well, the Nightingale claiming
the Rhine lands in the west and the Sprosser the southern and

Mr. W. E. Teschemakek,
eastern districts, watered by the Elbe and the Oder ; bnt in the
other territory which they hold in common the two species seem
to be a good deal mixed up, and we may guess that warfare is
not unknown for, if we may judge by their behaviour in captivity,
they do not like one another and, as the Nightingale is the first
to arrive at its nesting haunts, it probably often has to do battle
for the site it has selected. The Sprosser has the merest trace of
a bastard-primary, as pointed out by Howard Saunders and many
years previously by Bree, which alone would serve to distinguish
it from its relative; it is also a longer bird (7 in. as against 6.50
in.) and a bulkier bird, and lastly, its upper breast is clouded
and, in some specimens, distinctly streaked with a darker shade.
Nevertheless, it has been stated--on one occasion the remark
was made to me personally by a most experienced aviculturist--
that the Sprosser is no larger than the Nightingale. I explain
this in two ways : in the first place a singing Sprosser is worth in
Germany 30/-, its relative only 20/-, and it is, therefore, quite
possible that the latter species has been frequently imported
under the name of the former; secondly, in the case of both
species there are the usual variations in point of size.* I can
testify to this because I once conveyed in the same small cage a
genuine, though remarkably small, Sprosser, caught in Russia,
and an abnormally large Nightingale, caught in the neighbour-
hood of London. Not only was the Nightingale as large as the
Sprosser, but he soon proved to the latter that he was the more
doughty warrior. Nevertheless, it would be no exaggeration to
say that an expert could generally tell the one from the other in
the dark---by the simple process of taking them in his hand.
I11 the wild tract of country where the mighty Volga makes
a sweeping bend towards its smaller rival, the Don, the Sprosser
meets another near relative--the Eastern Nightingale, D. golzii.
The Sprosser is undoubtedly a good species, but the claims of
D. golzii to this distinction are not by any means so obvious, f
D. philo?nela and D. luscinia, as we have seen, overlap as breeding
species, but D. golzii and D. luscinia do not. True, we are told

length was 7 inches, and wing measurement 4 5 inches.-- Ed.

Nightingale, and the Sprosser as a distinct species. -- E".

that D. golzii lias a longer tail, but the difference in length
cannot be great; at all events, in the two living specimens of
the latter species which I have had an opportunity of inspecting,
it did not catch the eye. The Sprosser itself has a decidedly
long tail (I have measured several and make it 2.7501. : Bree says
\0x25A0"301. to the vent") so, if D. golzii has a longer one, one would
think it would be a very distinctive feature.
It is probably the latter species which has earned for the
Persian Bulbul, through the medium of the poets, its fame as a
songster. I11 at least two countries the Nightingale is called
\0x25A0" Bulbul." One of these is Egypt, where our member Rady W.
Cecil tells us in her charming little book, "Bird Notes from the
Nile," that this name is applied by the Arabs to D. luscinia ; the
other is India. A correspondent, who is himself an expert in
the art of keeping Nightingales, wrote me some years since as
follows : " I have been 32 years in India where Nightingales are
brought from Persia or some northern part and are called ' Bulbul
basta' to distinguish them from the Indian Bulbuls." Writing
me again as to the meaning of the word ' basta,' he replied :--" I
have enquired from a Persian gentleman, who says that lie does
not know the word ' basta,' but that there is a word ' bastan,'
which means 'garden' and that ' Bulbul-e-bastan ' means the
* Garden-Nightingale.'" In some countries then the Nightingale
is called a Bulbul, but in Palestine, according to Evans, a Bulbul
(P. xanthopygus) is called a Nightingale.
Migration.
If anyone wants to gauge the extent of our knowledge (?)
of even the most familiar summer migrants he should tax the
resources of a good library and note what he can ascertain of the
area of their winter quarters, their migration routes and their
life in tropical countries. With regard to the present species
Dixon tells us that the Sprossers bred in Denmark and Scan-
dinavia pass through Central Europe and winter in N.E. Africa.
We may conjecture that the Russian contingent skirt the shores
of the Black Sea, pass through Asia Minor (where, however, no
Nightingales remain during the winter) and wing their way, with
the Scandinavian Sprossers and the eastern contingent of D.
luscinia , up the valley of the Nile. Lady W. Cecil tells us that

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
the Sprosser is more rarely seen in the Nile Valley than D.
luscinia, though it is sometimes seen on migration. It would,
however, be impossible to estimate the comparative rarity of the
species unless a large number were collected and other observers
have seen large numbers of Nightingales (many of which would
probably be Sprossers) in the Delta at the time of the spring
flight ,* No Nightingales remain in Egypt during the winter
months, and Witherby, who followed the course of the White
Nile southward from Khartoum for some distance, does not
record either species, though he seems to have come across many
of our summer migrants. They press on further south, following
the course of the great " river of mystery "--a mystery which was,
however, really solved some 2,400 years since, when Herodotus
rightly guessed that it had its origin in the melting snows of the
mountains of the far interior. Some Sprossers pass the winter
in Abyssinia and Somaliland, but others in accordance with the
well-known principle that species which summer furthest north
winter furthest south, wing their way to the country of the Masai,
to the Mountains of the Moon (specimens being obtained on
both Kilimanjaro and Kikuyu), to the Great Takes, to German
East Africa, and, passing the normal southern limit of D. luscinia ,
according to Hartert (Vog. pal.) even reach the Zambesi itself.
Kilimanjaro certainly sounds a very unlikely locality for a Night-
ingale, but it must be remembered that a large area of the base
of the great mountain is clothed with dense forest, swathed in
eternal mist and drenched by incessant rain, and therefore pre-
sumably affords a bountiful supply of the kind of insect diet
which this species chiefly depends on ; for the Sprosser is a
somewhat lethargic species and would soon starve if it had to
depend on winged insects only for its livelihood. It is essentially
a hunter of caterpillars, a turner of dead leaves and a devourer
of the larvae of beetles, nor have I ever seen it display more skill
or activity in foraging than that involved in hovering beneath a
spreading branch and picking caterpillars from the underside of
the leaves.
D. luscinia appears to have two main routes--one stream

of migrants making for the Straits of Gibraltar, N.W. Africa and
the Gold Coast, the other crossing the Mediterranean at points
considerably further east and heading for the Nile Valley. It is
the Sahara which really divides up these two contingents, a
region which all migrants give as wide a berth to now, when it is
a sea of sand, as they probably did in those remote days when it
was a vast expanse of salt water.
The Eastern Nightingale, according to Hartert, winters
in Southern Arabia, in parts of India {eg. Oudli) and in E, Africa.
Skxuai. Distinctions.
Except during the short period of the pairing season it is
always a difficult matter to determine the sex of a Nightingale.
The first lien Sprosser which I succeeded in obtaining was a
hand-reared bird and did not show any marked indications of
sex: I did not attempt to breed from it. In the following year a
German dealer, who has had many hundreds of Sprossers pass
through his hands, sent me a bird which he undoubtedly con-
sidered to be a female because he valued it at the not extravagant
figure of 5/-. This 'lien' is in my possession to-day, and sang so
freely in the spring that I was able to take some Phonograph
records from it! When I mentioned this fact to the dealer he
replied that next time he would make 110 mistake, and he was as
good as his word, for last May he sent me a Sprosser which I had
no difficulty in recognising as an undoubted female. It was
somewhat paler 011 the back, very much ligliteron the underparts
and had a finer head and beak, and what I can only describe as a
feminine air.
Song.
Of the three Nightingales I have 110 hesitation in saying
that D. luschiia is the finest songster from an artistic point of
view. Its tones are more varied and melodious, its expression
more facile and impassioned and lastly, but by no means leastly,
it has no discords. Many of the Nightingale's tours are re-
produced by the Sprosser with success, but there are others which
it does not attempt. The beautiful whistling tour (" tee-tee-tee ")
which D. luscinia generally selects as a prelude to its song and
which, when it is introduced as a finale , is sung with a rallentando
effect, is really exquisite, and might almost be described as

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker
all its own. Though I have heard many Sprossers, it was not
until this season that I ever knew one attempt it and the fact
that the Sprosser can sing it but does not, except in rare instances,
do so maj&amp;apos; be said to show&amp;apos; that it has not the artistic taste of D.
luscinia.
The song of the Sprosser is exceedingly powerful and
mellow but it introduces tours which one feels that no true artist
would select. Some of these appear to be borrow&amp;apos;ed from the
Sedge-Warbler and Greater Reed Warbler and, in this connection,
we may note that, at all events in Central Europe, the favourite
nesting site of this species is a scrub-covered island in a river or
a dense thicket on a river bank. Perhaps I should not say
"borrowed from" because it is a tempting theory that the notes
of birds were in the first instance a reproduction of the familiar
sounds of their environment and anyone who has heard a Stone-
chat "chatting" on rocky ground can hardly doubt that there is
a substratum of truth in the hypothesis. Be this as it may, I
think that I am on safe ground if I say that there is at all events
a harmony between the songs of the reed-haunting species and
the voices of the liver, marsh and mere--the lapping of the water,
the croaking of frogs and the rustling and rattling of the reeds
bent by the wind ; so possibly it is to these influences and not
to the Sedge-Warbler that the Sprosser is indebted for some of
its tours. The most characteristic phrase of the Sprosser's song
is called by the Germans the "Jacob" tour and sounds like the
word "tit-up" with the accent on the last syllable.
It is singular that, although the Sprossers song has more
volume than that of D. luscinia , it cannot be heard&amp;apos; at so great a
distance, on account of its lower pitch. I once had an opportu-
nity of testing the carrying power of the Nightingale's high tour
(" chip-chip-cliip ") and found that it could be heard on a still
evening at a distance of 750 yards and perhaps further. Never-
theless the notes of the Sprosser are exceedingly powerful, as
may be judged from the fact that during the past spring I heard
one in an out-door aviary on several occasions challenge and
fairly sing down a Thrush.
I have spoken of the Sprosser's song as though it were
something fixed and invariable but, as we all know, every in-

dividual songster has his own particular style and, vvhat is more,
each individual has as many songs as he has moods. Last May I
had the privilege of hearing the love-song of this species; it was
so completely different from the ordinary song, so low and sweet
and varied, that I should never have guessed it proceeded from a
Sprosser if I had not seen the bird singing. Alas, it only lasted
for the three days during which pairing was taking place.
I have not heard the song of the Eastern Nightingale and
therefore am not able to compare it, but I am told by one who
has heard it sing in captivity in India that its song is more
powerful than, but not so varied or melodious as, that of the
Western Nightingale ; it is, however, a very free singer and will
even deliver its song when being carried about in a cage by hand.
To sum the matter up in a few words, the further east we go the
more freely will Nightingales sing in captivity and the less
melodious will their song be.
Nesting.
It was on the nth of May that I received the lieu Sprosser ;
it had not been " meated off" and had evidently only been a few
days in captivity. It is rarely that I have the luck to secure a
"softbill" in so satisfactory a condition, unless I do my own
trapping. As a rule they reach me with digestions ruined by
some horrible "mixture" and are quite worthless for breeding
purposes. All that I knew about the nesting habits of this
species at that time was that, according to Bree, it preferred the
" neighbourhood of water and marshes." It so happened that I
had a shallow tank in the larger aviary which was not in use,
so I soon fitted up a corner for them by planting part of it with
bamboos and reeds. This sounds delightfully simple but I feel
damp even now when I recollect how we brought those bamboos
ten miles, and the clumps of reeds six miles by boat, filled the
tank with earth and planted the clumps which varied in weight
from half a hundredweight to a hundredweight each. I also
constructed a mound of earth and planted it with a kind of fine
grass which grows on the cliffs because our Nightingale likes to
nest on a bank and, if D. luscinia, why not D. philoinela ?
By the 19th, everything was ship-shape, and on that day I

Mrs. Katharine Currey,
in my possession more than a year. They seemed quite to&amp;apos;appre-
ciate their new quarters ; the female used to forage in the bamboo
jungle and bathe in the shallow pools, whilst the male, perched
in a quince tree, would fill the garden with the glory of his song.
It interested me to note that, whereas this Sprosser had previously
always sung in the early morning and never after midday, he
now sang a little in the morning, more in the late afternoon and
his very best in the evening, from 8 p.m. to io p.m.; in other
words, the very moment he found himself in a natural environ-
ment he reverted to first principles to the traditional habits of
his race. In some notes which I wrote on the habits of D.
luscmia some time since, I suggested that the reason that this
species sings a good deal at night is because it is liveliest at that
time, and that the reason that a caged Nightingale sings by day
is because it is impossible for it to find much occupation at night
in a stuffy cage in a dark room. The above observation seems to
confirm this theory. I also stated that I believed that the Night-
ingale did not sleep at all during the breeding season. This also
I have been able to some extent to confirm ; during this past
summer I have had a look at the Sprossers' aviary on many
occasions and at every hour of the night and early morning and
have invariably found them awake and active.

LAUGHING KINGFISHERS.
Dacelo gigas.
By Katharine Currey.
I have to mourn the loss of a pet of nearly twenty years,
the cock of a pair of Laughing Kingfishers 'Jack' having survived
'Jill,' his mate, a few years.
He obviously died of old age, for he looked very decrepit
for some mouths before his end. For all the years I had the
pair, they never had an hour's ill-health, and as they bathed
everyday, their plumage was most beautiful. Jack's head and
neck were of a creamy-white, and from the back view had the
appearance of a full-bottomed wig. His crest, a rich dark-brown,
was only raised when he was intent on watching something.

Jill's head and neck were ashy grey in colour, her crest dark
brown, and a ring of brown feathers extending from ear-covert
to ear-covert round the back of her head. Her wings were
beautifully marked with light blue feathers, his with iridescent
pink.
When I bought them, the poor birds were in a wretched
state, with broken beaks and no tails. Their beautiful brown
dog-like eyes, full of expression, induced me to buy them.
After arriving at their new home, they were almost be-
wildered at the sight of a clean bath, but having once splashed
into it, they bathed again and again as if it were impossible to
have enough. They managed to laugh, a hoarse cracked sound
at first, but after living in their country home for a year or two,
their laugh became the complete duet they sang together--
musical and in perfect harmony. They sang at dawn, noon and
sunset, and at other times as well. In spring and early summer
their laugh was so incessant and loud, in the early hours of the
morning, that they had to be shut into an inner cage till the
world was astir. Their habits were most fascinating to watch,
and their intelligence was great. They were very nervous and
shy of strangers, but quite tame and very gentle with their
owners. They bore the winter quite well, and broke the ice in
their bath to splash into it from a branch close by, on which
they sat intently watching the water, and raising and depressing
their crests. They bathed by turns, never together. After the
bath their toilet was a very pretty performance, as they shook
their soft crests and combed them with the shoulders of their
wings, bringing the wing over the back of the head.
Their home was a large wired-in enclosure under some
yews and an old walnut tree, sheltered from the north and north-
east by a high log palisading and the stable wall. They had all
the south sun, and some of the south-east and south-west sun-
shine as well. A wooden roosting-box of double thickness was
fixed high up against the wall, but they never used it, always
preferring to sleep in the open, sitting on a yew branch, one
laying its great bill across the other's back, the one pressing
close to the other. Sometimes they had games of hide-and-seek
among the logs and trees in their enclosure, chasing each other

with a sort of gurgling laugh. Once they gave signs of nesting,
but it came to nothing. I have been told they never breed in
England. Their native land is Australia, and a lady from Mel-
bourne who admired their fine condition very much, told me
they are quite hardy birds, living in the hills, where you can see
flocks of them and hear them laughing at sunset. They are
called the Settlers' clock, and are greatly valued for keeping
down the snakes and mice and troublesome reptiles, on which
they live. Raw meat they thrive on quite well, but must also
have fur or feathers, as they cast pellets.
One day I was brought out of the house by hearing them
chuckling as if they had caught a little bird, a sad event that
sometimes occurred when the aviary door was opened. I found
them playing at " French and English " with what looked like a
long strip of India-rubber, the ends of which they held tight in
their beaks. At first I thought that it was a snake, and wondered
how they could have caught it. On closer examination I found
it was the remains of an unfortunate frog. They sat pulling at
it for hours, and well into the night. Next morning it was gone,
and they were very subdued and silent.
Jill was found lying dead on the ground one morning
early, after being with us many years. She and her mate were
not young when they came, so I could not tell their age. Pre-
sumably they live to a high age. I had an autopsy of her made,
and the Naturalist who undertook this reported that he had never
seen so fat a bird. She had died of suffocation from over-eating.
The fact was she took all the food from her poor mate, who was
quite thin in consequence. What wonder that he seemed rather
relieved at her departure, and enjoyed his food more than he had
ever done before ! He laughed and sang merrily, but the song
always sounded disjointed, like a duet played on the piano by one
person.
I have had them extremely well set up in a glass case by
Messrs. Watkins and Doncaster, and though a stuffed bird is a
poor exchange for a living one, yet I like to look at the beautiful
plumage of my old friends, and recall the days when their joyous
laugh sounded over the garden.

Gouldians and Long-tailed Grass fin che.s : The former have
been a real trial to me. I have had perhaps a dozen pairs, most
of which died at periods varying from one day to a fortnight
from the time of my obtaining them. Here, again, I have an
exception in the case of one hen which lived about a year and
was ultimately killed by a rat.
Long-tails have done better, and some pairs (?) I have
kept quite a respectable time, in one or two cases, eighteen
months to three years. The sexing of this Grassfinch is one of
the difficulties of the uon-scientific aviarist. I know the white
tip to be found on the wings of some specimens is not an indica-
tion of the masculine gender, as I have undoubted hens with this
characteristic, and of this I am absolutely certain. Further, size
is no guarantee of sex as of the last pair I possessed, the cock
bird was a shade smaller than the lieu, the extended tail feathers
were shorter, but the black gorget was unquestionably larger in
this particular cock bird, and though it may need a fine eye to
discern a difference sometimes, I think the bib is the best index
of the sex, that is to say given a stock to choose from, those
with the biggest bibs would be certain to prove cocks.
Of Bicheno or Double Banded Finches I have only kept
two pairs, one hen living with me about five years. This bird
broke both legs on separate occasions, recovering rapidly under
careful treatment, the limb being set in improvised "spelks"
made from the soft pine wood of " Puck" matches and carefully
bound with knitting wool. There was 110 deformity in either
limb after recover)&quot;, although in the first accident the fracture
was at a point not more than half an inch from the body. The
bird was of course kept for about a month in a cage, from which
all perches had been removed and the bottom covered with hay
to a good depth, food and water being conveniently to hand so
that she had really not to move her position to obtain either.
My Zebra Finches never reared any young, though nest
after nest was built, each having a complement of eggs varying

from four to ten, and I found on one occasion no fewer than four
nests erected on the top of each other. I got the impression that
my food supply was too stimulating, so cut off soft food and ants'
cocoons, but this did not make much, if any, difference, they
continued nesting operations to the usual stage and commenced
again de ?iovo.
On entering one of my birdrooms one morning I was horri-
fied to find that the wire-netting guard covering the open window
had fallen down and most of the birds had escaped, indeed all
those I valued most had gone without exception, including two
Nonpariel Buntings, one Indigo Bunting, two Gouldians, four
Long-tail Grassfinches, two Paradise Wydalis in full colour, one
cock Rosella and a number of commoner birds. My feelings may
be better imagined than described, and a sympathetic friend, to
whom I related my trouble and who had never quite understood
my penchant for live stock, but who had 011 many oocasions
consented to listen to my recital of the charms of bird-keeping,
laconically observed, "Well, old chap, this will surely put the lid
on,'' from which I gathered he anticipated my interest in avicul-
ture would forthwith cease. He was mistaken. I may say that
I never recovered a single bird, but I had accounts brought to
me of strange birds being seen in different parts of the City,
which I recognised from the description as formerly my property.
Shortly afterwards I removed into the country, and my
mind was at once centred upon the construction of outdoor
aviaries. I had considerable difficulty in selecting a suitable
site owing to the number of large Beech and Sycamore trees
around the house, but eventually I decided to erect one at the
end of the house on the site of a small shrubbery and into which
I could obtain a view from a window which opened out on that
side from a room most frequently occupied. Although it would
face east, I rightly argued that it would get ample protection
from the winds from that direction, and was also fairly well
sheltered from the north. The accompanying ground plan will
explain the position of this aviary as constructed :--"A" is a
small stone-built outhouse, forming part of the permanent struc-
ture and has a flagged roof, the walls are quite i8in. thick. I
had several of the roof flags removed and a sheet of glass 3oiu.

Mr. Archibald Simpson,
by iSi 11. by #in. let into a frame and fixed in their stead, this
lighted the interior splendidly, and after the walls had been
whitewashed I regarded it as being almost perfection, but so as
to afford additional shelter I built up to it a wooden house " B,"
constructed of fin. tongued and grooved matchboarding, cover-
ing the roof wiili prepared felt; the total dimensions of the
structure, including the stone-built place, are 36ft. long, 15ft.
wide, with an average height of 7ft. " C " is the open flight, 21ft.
long. The height is 7 ft. 6 in. at the back, with a fall of one
foot to the front. I raised the ground level inside to the top
of the skirting board, which is seven inches wide, with fine
gravel, except a strip about five feet wide on two sides which
was turfed, but 011 which a blade of grass is now rarely seen.
The outside flight is of course covered with fine mesh galvanised
netting (half-inch) blacked with Wailes, Dove &amp; Co.'s bitumastic
solution (which I find spreads much better than Brunswick Black
and is innocuous and much cheaper). The wooden framework
was painted green, and when the whole was completed and ready
for occupation I felt quite satisfied I was now in a position to
compete with my fellow members who write the nice long
accounts of breeding successes, and annex the Society's medals
as a consequence.
In addition to my usual stock, I received from a Jamaica
friend one pair each of White Crowned Pigeons, White Bellied
and White Wing Doves, and subsequently purchased a pair of
Pennant Parrakeets and also introduced a trio of Gold Pheasants,
finally dispelling all doubts on the part of my family connections
as to my sanity by erecting two more aviaries, on the ground that
I had not yet sufficient room.
The last mentioned were constructed on the open-shed
principle, that is to say, the covered-in portion was not wholly
boarded but only on thiee sides and for a span of about three
feet from the top on the fourth, fronting to the wired-in portion.
They each measure 16 ft. by 8 ft., really being a 16 ft. square
aviary divided by half-inch mesh netting down the centre with a
door from one into the other, the outside portion of each being
10 ft. 6 in. long and 7 ft. 6 in. high, the covered portion being
10 feet high in front sloping to 8 feet. They face south, but are

much shaded on this side by a large greenhouse, rockeries and
trees, they nevertheless get a fair amount of sun, and in the
summer months I am satisfied that the screen may be regarded
as an advantage ; they are shown on the sketch plan marked
*&amp;apos; 2 ." In one of these I have a pen of three Gold Pheasants and
Budgerigars, and in the other four Amhersts, Pekin Robins,
Thrushes and Cardinals.
For a period of about three months the inmates of my
outside aviaries appeared to be doing well ; my White Crowned
Pigeons reared two nests of young, the first, a solitary bird, which
proved to be a cock, and then a nest of two, one of either sex.
The old cock bird had evidently been shot as he had one mutilated
wing, which prevented him rising from the floor, though he often
made attempts at flight; he was very wild and untractable, but
his partner was a pattern of tameness and would come to feed
from the hand at call, they were both furiously jealous of the
approach of any bird within two or three feet of the nest, which
was constructed on the top of a small rockery in one corner of
the flight. The White Bellies were constantly quarrelling with
each other and I could not sex them, though I think they were
both hens, as I found odd eggs in various parts of the aviary, but
110 attempt was made at the construction of a nest. I subse-
quently got a pair of common Barbary Doves, under which I
placed eggs of the White Bellies, but they never hatched. The
White Wings tolerated each other and that was their limit. A
pair of Zebra Doves also built and laid, but were so wild they
left the nest on the least noise and their eggs were always blanks,
very disappointing but nothing to the debacle shortly to come.
I found one of the White Wing Doves had something wrong with
its bill, and an examination showed this member to have become
quite soft and elastic, rendering the bird incapable of picking up
food. I was recommended lime water as a drink, and soft food
for a time, but this treatment proved useless and the bird died
about a week after my noticing its condition. There was plenty
of old mortar and cuttle fish bone in the place, so the lack of these
materials could not have been the cause. Should I again have a
bird in a like state I shall resort to heroic measures, and stiffen
both mandibles with fish glue, taking care not to cover the

nostrils, and continue the lime water treatment, which to be
effective must need a considerable time, and the artificial stiffen-
ing of the bill would at least enable the bird to continue on
ordinary seed instead of soft food, which some birds decline to
eat readily. I feel sure this experiment would prove successful.
Less than a week after, I lost its companion, I found it jammed
tightly between a large tree trunk and the wall of the house, a
position from which it had been unable to extricate itself. This
was the beginning of another long run of misfortunes, as I shortly
afterwards found the old cock White-crowned Pigeon with its
head eaten off, evidently by a rat or some member of the weasel
family. I made a thorough search through the aviary, and at
last discovered a rat had entered the place through the floor of
the stone-built inner house. I had the floor taken up and a thick
layer of cement and broken glass laid down and the flags re-
placed. Two days afterwards I found the earth thrown up in
the wooden shelter, the animal had tunnelled beneath the cement
and come out close to the seed vessels, from which he took toll
for some days, as he refused to enter traps, however carefully
they were laid. Eventually I got him by opening a dead bird
and inserting arsenic, laying the bait out of reach of any of the
birds, though I do not suppose they would have touched it, but
the greatest care ought always to be exercised when using poison.
I then dug down below the level of the cement and sank half-
inch netting to a depth of two feet the whole length of the old
building, feeling certain I had now a barrier against the invasion
of rodents, but shoitly afterwards found another White-crown
had been partly eaten, and though I made a most minute search
over the whole floor area of my large aviary I could find no signs
of a hole. Will it be believed, that almost every day for about
three weeks there was a fresh victim, notwithstanding traps,
poisoned birds, meal and lures of all descriptions. He took
every one of my remaining doves before sampling the others,
eating the head and breast portions only, and followed on by
destroying a Golden Plover and two Lapwings; several of the
smaller birds were found eaten on the nests, or rather the few
feathers and feet left there would seem to prove this to be the
case. I watched the place for hours together, but never once

caught a glimpse of him, though we often heard noises at night
which warranted our conclusions that he was about. Then by
accident I got a clue to his procedure. I had been examining the
ivy on the large rockery which abuts on the outside wall of the
stone-built house, and on which there is the stump of an old tree
rising to about two feet above the level of the roof and situated
about the same distance from it, when I saw the vermin crawl up
the trunk, spring across to the roof and run along the top to
where the glass had been fixed, he disappeared beneath the over-
lap of the flags and thus gained access from the top behind a
cross beam on the inner side. I determined to have him, so fixed
a length of wire netting flat across the top to prevent his escape
and made a search without success. He was inside for a week
before I again saw him, and then I discovered lie had been in the
habit of running up the inside wall and hiding in one of the nest
boxes. His requiem was sung by a handy dog and I have had
no further troubles from A/us decumanus.
I had again to re-stock the aviary, a process attended by
the usual high percentage of losses, but I do not intend to further
particularize, the recital would be a melancholy one. For the
present I am content to sit at the feet of those experts in Foreign
Bird-keeping, whose articles tell us in simple terms what to do
and what not to do, a veritable monument of Hope awaiting a
solution of the problem as to why, with all the care and attention
it is possible for an enthusiast to expend upon his subject, my
record is one which entitles me to " The Wooden Spoon " of
Aviculture should the Society ever deem it wisdom to award one.

My pair of these most beautiful Grosbeaks were turned
loose in a disused bedroom in the winter of this year, and in
May they showed signs of wishing to build a nest. They began
one in the branches of a dead spruce fir, which had been placed
so that the top of it touched the ceiling of the room, which kept
it firm. But the Grosbeaks did not succeed in building a sub-

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
stantial home for their future family, and in June the female,
after placing some scanty material in a Canary nesting-box of
wood with perforated zinc at the bottom, laid two or three eggs,
which were broken. Therefore I found a Blackbird's nest, which
I fixed securely into the artificial nesting-box, and the hen bird
at once took to it. As it was about nine feet up and close under
the ceiling I could not see what was going on, but in the middle
of June I found egg shells on the floor from which young birds
had evidently hatched. The shells were of a pale green blue
blotched and spotted with rufous umber, a broad belt of which
colour formed an unbroken ring round the stouter end.
Both the male and female took their regular turns in in-
cubating and (later on) in brooding the young, a fact which is
borne out by Mr. C. O. Tracey {Ornithologist and Oologist, Vol. X.
p. 37) where writing from Vermont he says [see " Foreign Birds
for Cage and Aviary," Part I., p. 141, Butler]:--"The sexes
"arrive together. The male is at once conspicuous, both by his
" beautiful plumage and melodious song. While essentially a
" forest bird--and one must see and hear him in his forest home
" to see his full beauty and hear him in his happiest song--they
" often come into the orchard and shade-trees about our homes.
"Along the lightly timbered river banks and roadsides they
"find their favourite breeding places, but these must be at 110
"great distance from the more heavily timbered forest. The
" forked top of a sapling is usually selected for a resting place.
" Sometimes, however, the horizontal branch of a large forest
" tree is chosen. The nest is a frail structure, made of fine dry
"twigs and a few grass or weed stalks. Sometimes only twigs
" are used, and these are nearly always hemlock. It is seldom
" less than eight or more than twenty feet from the ground. The
" full complement of eggs is usually four, sometimes but three.
" Dimensions vary from .1 by .75 to .90 by .70 of an inch : colour
" greenish-blue, spotted with different shades of brown.
" Both sexes incubate, the male performing his full share of
" this important duty. My records show that where I have made
"observations in thirty-four cases, the nests were occupied by
"males twenty-three times and females eleven."
I want to especially draw attention to these records of Mr.

Tracey's, because Dr. Butler mentions that Dr. Russ states that
when these Grosbeaks nested in his bird-room, the eggs were
incubated by the hen alone.
My male bird fully bore out Mr. Tracey's testimony of
their habits in a wild state, and I believe it was often on the
nest all night.
My pair of Rose-breasted Grosbeaks have proved them-
selves to be most harmless to other birds, for in the same room
where they nested (quite a small one too) there was the following
collection of mostly rarae aves : --
One pair of Hooded Parrakeets ( Psephotus cncullalus).
One pair of Blue Budgerigars.
Two pairs of Hooded Siskins ( Chryso/nilris cucullatns&amp;apos;).
One pair of Fire-tailed Finches ( Zonceghitluis bellus).
One pair of Parrot Finches ; and
One pair of Red-headed Gouldian Finches.
All of which often perched quite close to the Grosbeak's nest,
paying no attention to the sitting bird, and in turn being paid no
attention to.
One day towards the end of June, I found a dead young
Grosbeak, apparently about eight or nine days old, placed on the
sill of the window. It had evidently died in the nest and been
carefully taken out and deposited there, for there were no marks
of injury whatever, but the body itself was by no means fresh.
However, disappointed as I was, I was relieved to see the old
birds still taking their due turns in brooding, so that I felt
assured there was still one live nestling; which turned out to be
the case. Unfortunately, however, although it has since left the
nest, it is [up to the date of writing] a cripple, being apparently
rickety in the legs, but otherwise strong and healthy. I believe
it to be a male bird, for although resembling the female in mark-
ings, the general colour, especially on the wings and head is
much darker. I have put this youngster in a cage, as he is unable
to perch, but I have hopes that his legs will gain strength later
on, for they do not seem to be deformed.
For the benefit of those who are not acquainted with this
most lovely Grosbeak, let me say that the bird is much the same
size as a Red Cardinal, but it is tighter and neater in its plumage.

Nesting of the Rose-breasted Grosbeak.
The upper surface of the male is (in the breeding colour&amp;apos;) chiefly
black, but there are white spots at the tips of the secondaries,
etc. and upper tail coverts, and the inner webs of three outer-tail
feathers are white. When flying away he has a pied appearance.
The under surface is a very bright and pure white, a large patch
of cardinal rose-red on the fore-neck and centre of breast, this
colour running down into a point. The sides of the body and
thighs are rather greyer, flecked with black. The under wing-
coverts are rosy, the beak whitish ; feet grey-blue ; eyes dark
hazel-brown.
The contrast of black, white, and the beautiful rosy red is
very fine and equally conspicuous. The female is altogether
different, her general effect being ochre-brown, streaked and
spotted with a brown of a much darker tint, or black; her under
wing-coverts are orange-yellow.
Dr. Butler, in his work referred to already, says: " In the
"autumn the rose-red (of the male) disappears, to reappear at
"the approach of the breeding season," and he adds, " This fact,
" observed by Dr. Russ, has been questioned by scientists."
Why, I do not understand, for it is a well-known fact, or ought
to be, that the male Rose-breasted Grosbeak has a distinct winter
plumage. I have seen mine go through three bi-annual moults,
and his winter plumage is very dingy as compared with that of
the spring and summer.
In the autumn the Rosy-red on the breast all but dis-
appears, being obliterated by brown, the white of the under-parts
loses its brightness and is splashed with brown, as also is the
black of the upper parts; but, about March, the bright and
pure colours commence to reappear, each year becoming more
brilliant.
These birds seem to feel the damp and cold of the English
winter, and for that reason I removed mine from an outdoor
aviary and put them into the empty bedroom, where they have
done extremely well. The song of the male is difficult to describe
(what bird's song is not?) but it is gay and buoyant, although
disjointed. The quality of the notes is good however. They are
very quiet birds, not moving about so actively as the Cardinals,
and they are very tameable. They are summer migrants to

PORTUGAL.
By Miss Ivens.
I am sending a photograph of an interesting pair of birds,
for reproduction in our Magazine, if found acceptable. They
occasionally breed in this country, chiefly in the province of
Alemtejo, south of Estremadura, in which Lisbon is situated.
I am told they are rare and difficult to keep in captivity, unless
taken as fledgelings from the nest. If caught when adults they
are apt to refuse food and to pine away. Their Portugese name
is " Batarda," and they are also known as the European Ostrich.
Indeed the photograph shows a certain resemblance to that bird.
The colouring of their plumage, except in the purely white
parts, is a mottled combination of cinnamon-brown, black and
white intermixed with slight touches of yellow ; their size about
that of a large Turkey. Before concluding this description of
them (given to me by my bird-dealer, for I have not been for-
tunate enough to see the birds myself) I must call attention to
the singular liair-like appendages, "whiskers," so to say, that
adorn their faces.
With regard to other birds found in this country, many are
identical with those of Britain. Most of our familiar songsters,
both graminivorous and insectivorous, are even more common
here than with us. Hoopoes, Jays and Kingfishers likewise.
Among game-birds there is the wild duck, which breeds largely
in the marshes up the Tagus, some 22 miles above Lisbon, in
the district known as the " Ribatejo." They are plentiful in the
markets of this city. Snipe and Woodcock, Quails and Partridges

(the red-legged kind) also abound. The " Alemtejo " seems to
produce a larger kind of Partridge than those that inhabit the
rest of Portugal. At a bird-show recently held here I saw a pair
of them, and was much struck by their size and really fine
appearance.
Aviculture asascieuce is still in its infancy here in Lisbon.
Bird-shops are not wanting, and I must add they are clean and
singularly free from the unpleasant odour which makes a pro-
longed stay in such establishments in England, to say the least,
undesirable, and one can see that the birds are well kept and
attended to. The drier climate and greater amount of sunshine
probably contributes to this satisfactory state of things. But
when one seeks for the varied kinds of seeds for one's pets, so
easy to procure in England, one is doomed to disappointment.
Lisbon boasts of a population of about half-a-milion ; yet,
in a city of this size, it is impossible to obtain any of the ordinary
white French millet so common with us; I actually had to send
to Oporto for some, where it is sold. Spikes of the brown millet
are likewise conspicuous by their absence, Dari is simply un-
known. As to special mixtures for Doves, Finches, or other
birds, you are simply stared at as eccentric it you do but ask for
them.
I may include in the same vast catalogue of " necessaries"
that are "wanting": flint-grit, calcined oyster-shells, nesting
material, ants' eggs, soft-food mixtures and numberless other
articles which I cannot recall to mind at the moment, but that
I have to find substitutes for constantly.
The seeds that can be obtained aie the following: Wheat,
Indian corn (but never crushed), hemp, Canary seed, rice, and
the universal " Painco," that is the brown Indian millet, with
which all the smaller Doves, Parrakeets, or African Finches are
fed. Lastly, there is "Limpadura"--mill sweepings--which
contains tares and many other wild seeds that grow in the
wheat, barley or oat crops. Of this I give a certain quantity
to all my Doves, even the small ones, mixed with the richer
seeds. But I always have to sift it carefully fiist, as it is full of
such refuse as husks, small bits of straw, much dust, etc.
So the aviculturist here has to exercise some ingenuity to

keep his pets in good condition. As sand, I use that from the
sea-shore, of which there is an abundance on the banks of the
Tagus, close to Lisbon. I add to this cuttle-fish bone (not on sale
anywhere ) from the same source, old mortar and crushed raw
egg-shells. So the little foreign Doves I brought with me from
England still flourish under their changed conditions.
Of green foods, one can get most of our English weeds, in
favour with the birds, though in less abundance; then there is
lettuce and watercress to fall back upon when they are lacking.
So we manage to get on after all.
There is a singular absence of enterprise in this nation.
They prefer to go on in their time-honoured customs undisturbed,
and look upon any improvements or innovations only as an
additional and wholly unnecessary trouble. Indeed they tell me
that if they did get any of them on trial they would only remain
on their hands, as there is no demand for them.
On my first arrival here I had thought what a splendid
opening there is in this city for a really good English corn
chandler. But I think so no longer, seeing that, as I have shown,
they would find no customers. However, there are rare and
interesting species to be found in the bird-shops, notwithstanding
all these " limitations," so therewith we must be content.
I trust this very poor contribution to the Magazine, from
an old member, will prove of slight interest to others belonging
to our Society.

An interesting collection of birds has been received by
exchange from the Zoological Society of New York, amongst
which are three species new to the collection. These are the
Douglas Quail ( Lophortyx douglasi ) of which there are two pairs,
a species allied to the Californian Quail. It is an extremely
pretty bird of a mottled grey splashed with brick-red, and with a
reddish crest. A pair of Bendire Thrashers ( Toxostoma be?idirei),
brown thrush-like birds with curved bills ; also four Gila Wood-
peckers ( Centurns uropygialis ), very pretty greyish birds splashed
with yellow, the males having a crimson crown.

Bird Notes from the Zoological Gardens.
Besides these three which are new to us, there are in
the collection Meadow Starlings ( Sturnella magnet), Picazuro
and White-crowned Pigeons, Passerine Doves, Snow-birds ( Junco
hyemalis connectens ), Chipping Sparrows, Cayenne Rails and
Laughing Gulls.
The Duke of Bedford has presented a hen Bornean Fire-
back Pheasant (Lophura ignita ) of which species we already had
a pair, the male having also been given to the Society by His
Grace, so we now have a male and two females of one of the
finest of the Firebacks.
Another acquisition of more than ordinary importance is a
beautiful pair of Regent Birds from Mr. Reginald Phillipps.
Members of the Avicultural Society do not need to be
reminded of Mr. Phillipps' success with this most beautiful of
Bower Birds, and it is interesting to note that the male of this
pair was actually bred in Loudon, and is without doubt the only
Regent Bird that has ever been reared in captivity.
We have secured one pair of the recent importation of
Purple-rumped Sun Birds (Arachnechthra zeylonica ) a species
which is not entirely new to the collection as Mr. E. W. Harper
presented a pair several years ago.
Our collection of Birds of Paradise has been augmented
by the presentation by Mr. E. J. Brook of a male Lesser Superb
Bird (&amp;apos;Lephorhina minor), a species new to the Society's list. It
is about the size of a Missel Thrush with velvety black plumage,
its throat ornamented with a metallic shield like that on the Six-
plumed Bird, while from the nape grows a wonderful hood of
long greenish-black feathers which, spreading out over the back,
reach nearly to the end of the tail.
We have quite a flock of young Hey&amp;apos;s Partridges ( Ammo -
perdix heyi ) about twenty at present, and other eggs due to hatch
soon ; some eight or nine young Australian Rails, some young
Cape Sparrows, and in a few days we expect a brood of young
Martineta Tinamous.
The young Cariama of which I wrote last month is now
nearly as large as its parents, which are sitting again on two eggs,
the full clutch. It is interesting to note that these birds breed
twice in the season. D. S-S.

mention that a pair of Bichenos have nested successfully in a large cage in
our dining room and four fine young ones have left the nest and are flying

Aslrapia Stephanies.
Sir,--A hen Aslrapia stephanice has built a nest and laid an egg in
my aviary.
The egg is long and large, being larger than a Rook's egg I should
say, and more oval in shape.
The ground colour is buff and is heavily marked with brown and
purple blotches.
The nest is a rough, rather loose structure and is built in the inner
part of the aviary and placed on a natural branch where that is fastened to
the wall. It is composed of a few birch twigs and a quantity of thin
bamboo shoots and leaves.
Very little moss has been used and the nest is practically unlined.
Unfortunately this egg will be useless for reproduction as the male was in
full moult when the lieu came into breeding condition, they had to be
separated to save the life of the male bird, the lieu was so vicious.

Sir, --I have just had a very great disappointment ! There was one
beautiful young bird in a hollow log, hatched on or about the 25th of July,
and on the 9th of August I found it dead, nibbled by some Parrakeet;
perhaps one of its own species, jealous at not having succeeded as well as
the parents of the young bird. It was just beginning to feather, the bright
"sunny" green of the wing-coverts showing quite plainly, and it was a
finely-grown bird too.
All through the summer, the females have been desirous to breed, and
certainly four out of the five have laid eggs, and the two males have been
seen constantly to mate with more than one female ; so that I had every
reason for hoping. I can only console myself with the fact that I am the

first to breed these beautiful Parrakeets in Europe, in spite of the young not
being raised to maturity.
As I have tried now to attain this result for the past eight years, I
think that other aviculturists will sympathize with me in such a loss.
Except for the birds of its own species, there was only a pair of
Stanley Parrakeets (they may be the culprits !) in a large aviary&amp;apos;, in which
any quantity of hollow logs and nesting-boxes have been placed. I believe
that none of the other clutches of eggs have come to anything. One lieu
has laid a great many, but has proved a bad mother, breaking several,
and constantly fidgeting in and out of the nest.

Note and description of young by the Editor.
We have received and examined the young bird referred to above,
which was apparently in good health and condition and being well tended
by&amp;apos; its parents for its crop was full. Death was apparently due to bites,
bruises and ill treatment from some other inmate of the aviary. We are
sure our members will heartily sympathize with Mr. Astley and wish him
better luck in the future. We have never before had an opportunity&amp;apos; of
examining so young a Parrakeet and there are one or two points about the
development of this bird, which show differences from other Orders. The
down plumage is rather difficult to make out as the bird is in spirit, but
there seems to be a scanty covering of short whitish down on most of the
feather tracts, though the head itself is almost naked. At the base of the
neck on the back the quills can just be made out; this feather tract bifurcates
at the shoulders, the quills becoming longer and more developed as we go
backwards. This double tract only&amp;apos; continues for about half-au-inch behind
the shoulders when it comes to a sudden end and there is no further trace of
any&amp;apos; quills over the whole of the back. The head and front side of the neck
are entirely naked. Between the crop and the thighs on the underside are
two parallel rows of quills just breaking through the skin and a few isolated
quills may also be seen on the upper part of the thighs. On the scapulars
the quills are well developed aud just beginning to burst. The most forward
development however, has taken place on the wings, both the primary aud
secondary quills aud their coverts are well grown aud just bursting, while
in the secondary coverts the feathers are a quarter-of-a-inch long. This is a
point, which if it holds good for all Parrots may have considerable
significance when we remember that these coverts are the first to be
developed in Game Birds and Guillemots aud as far as we know&amp;apos; at present
(and our knowledge in these matters is very&amp;apos; deficient) in no other Orders.
Waders and Ducks of course go to the other extreme and grow their flight
feathers and coverts last, aud in the majority of Passerine birds these
feathers are grown paru passu with the rest of the plumage.
Plxcept in the Game Birds, however, we know of no young in which
the wing-coverts develop so much in advance of the rest of the body

plumage. The tail feathers have like the primaries just burst their sheaths
but their coverts both upper and under are only just through the skin. The
feet are well developed and very rough to the touch and there is a fair sized
callosity on the 'heel' comparable to that found in some species of Owls.

developed and the cere is very large and swollen. We are extremely obliged

VII. TANAGERS.
By S. M. Townsend.
To write an article on Tanagers! What a tremendous
task ! A bird lover with a ready pen could fill volumes, it is such
a vast subject, but mine is an unready pen and now when I wish
to start, I cannot think what to write about. Besides now that I
have kept Tanagers some years I am beginning to know how
much I still have to learn about them. It is strange that the
beginner, or the person who has never kept a Tanager, always
has more confidence ; I, for instance, started with a Superb and
Violet, and if I had parted with them at the end of a few months,
and never kept another Tanager, I should have been ready to
agree that they were quite hard} 7 .
Tanagers are most interesting birds to keep as? pets, as
they are beautiful to look at and, in the majority of cases, very
intelligent and full of character. In all the years I have kept
them, I think I have only had one that never learned to know me
or take kindly to cage life, and though I do not look upon them
as hardy birds I think with careful treatment they can be kept to
a ripe old age.
My experience of keeping them is only in cages, so I sup-
pose I ought not to criticise others, but it will take a great deal
to convince me that Calliste and some others can be kept out of
doors all the year round with impunity. Occasionally one hears
of a Superb wintering out of doors, but it is rare to hear of that
Superb having successfully moulted the following year, the
strain on its constitution having been too great.
Another difficulty I find in writing about Tanagers is the
wide difference in individual birds of the same species. Take for
instance the Violet. If you buy one one week and write out a
bill of fare for it, from what you have observed that it takes to
readily, it does not follow that the same bill of fare will do for all
Violets, the next one you get may be a bird of entirely different
tastes and absolutely decline to touch the provisions enjoyed by
the first. I think the best plan with a newly-bought Tanager is

to follow no rule, but to try different things in the way of food
and fruit, and you will soon see what it likes and what seems to
suit it the best.
While I am on the subject of buying I may say I have
found it the best plan not to go for the bird in the best condition,
with regard to feather. A bird just come over in a large consign-
ment, that has a bright eye and a fairly plump chest, though he
may not have a whole feather on him, is very often worth six
birds that are in apparently perfect plumage but have breastbones
like a knife edge. Again I would much rather be in time to buy
a Tanager in the dirty&amp;apos; state it arrives in, it is so much better to
get it like that, before anybody has had time to try and clean it
up for sale. I do not like my birds to be dry&amp;apos; cleaned.
Having bought the bird 1 get it home as quickly as
possible, put it in a cage by&amp;apos; itself, give it some slightly tepid
water, sometimes with a little port in it, if the bird seems run
down and a choice of fruit and some insectivorous food, and keep
it as quiet as possible, only&amp;apos; watching to see that it finds its way
to the water, etc. I keep it like this, away from all other birds,
for a fortnight or more, according to its condition ; when it has a
clean bill of health, I take it up in the birdroom and look round
for a suitable companion for it, this is a difficult task, as there is
always a great uncertainty&amp;apos; as to what birds will agree together,
but I think it is better to have two birds together, if you have a
large enough cage, it promotes exercise and stops over-feeding.
With two Tanagers in one cage, if one of them is over fond, say of
ants' cocoons, the other will probably prevent him from picking
them all out of the food at once, and he in his turn will perhaps
prevent the other from eating half an orange, or banana, at a
sitting, as some Tanagers seem to want to do. One of the
greatest things to guard against with Tanagers is their getting
too fat and it is sometimes very difficult to see this in time,
because sometimes a fat bird will hold himself so sleek and trim,
that he looks slimmer than a thin bird, who does the reverse; so
the great secret is to keep a careful eye on them and directly you
see anything wrong with the eye, or breathing, or any signs of
diarrhoea, or constipation, you must take steps at once and make
a radical change in the food, and perhaps give a dose of Epsom

salts, or any other simple remedy to meet the case. I have been
laughed at very much, by some medical men, for my attempts at
doctoring, but I have certainly had some remarkable cures.
Tanagers are such a large family that it is hard to say
where they begin or where they end. To the ordinary lay mind
it is difficult to trace any sign of Tanager in the Magpie Tanager,
whose beak is decidedly Shrike-like, but in captivity at any rate,
it does not live up to its appearance, either in habits or feeding,
though I have seen mine hold a grape skin with its feet and tear
it, but I am much more content to call it a Tanager, than I am to
accept the decision of many, that the once called Rufous-throated
Tanager is a Sugar-bird, I have watched mine very carefully,
but I cannot find any likeness to a Sugar-bird in him.
The way Tanagers are imported into this country makes it
almost impossible to say which are hardy, and one ought to be
very careful in making statements about individual birds, though
some people think a bird hardy if they keep it for six months.
Take for instance the White-capped Tanager. The Zoo had one
for many years and my own is still alive, now these birds are but
seldom imported, yet I know some have arrived, but we do not
hear of them living, still they may be, as there are many aviaries
-whose inmates are never heard of. The Magpie Tanager I bought
years ago was a single importation and was very healthy and
lived very well, but I have since seen others arrive and die off
very quickly.
Tanagers sometimes arrive with one, or sometimes both
eyes filmed over, very like a cataract, some think this is caused
by the birds knocking their heads coming over, but I think it is
because the birds are put into dirty cases and when they want to
clean their beaks, they rub them along the dirty perch and get
-some poisonous matter in the eye ; but at any rate the novice will
be wise to leave such birds severely alone, though some dealers
will assure you that the bird will soon lose that; but then
according to some of them a bird will recover from anything. I
Temember once finding a bird in a fresh consignment, that I had
been on the look out for for a very long time. I jumped at it and
put it in a small cage, but when it turned round, I saw one eye was
injured, it had very much the appearance of a film over it, but I

could see that the eye ball had been damaged by another bird,
I was assured that it would soon be allright, but I did not buy
it. However, it was sold, and about a fortnight after, the dealer
told me he had heard from the lady who had bought, it that the
bird could see, and the eye had almost recovered. Unfortunately
for the truth of his story I came across the buyer of the bird,
quite by accident, about eight months afterwards and was told
that the eye never changed in appearance and the bird had just
died.
I give my birds a simple insectivorous mixture made of
Spratt's Puppy Cakes ground to a meal and ants' cocoons scalded
with enough water to just damp the meal, and sometimes some
ground silkworms' cocoons, mixed with grated carrot and chopped
lettuce, when obtainable ; this of course is freshly made each
morning. I also give them plenty of ripe fruit, such as banana,
orange, tangerine, apple, pear, grapes, strawberries, cherries, etc.
So many of the smaller Tanagers live almost entirely upon fruit,
but I always try to encourage them to eat some of the insecti-
vorous food, and they most of them enjoy a mealworm or so
during the day, but I do not give them more than this, as in cage
life I think they can be overdone. Occasionally, about a tea-
spoonful of scalded bluebottles is mixed into the food, and
I find these are much appreciated, especially in the winter
months.
It is said that some Tanagers can be kept on seed alone,
such as the Black, but I do not believe it. I had a Black Tanager
for some years, to which I used to give a little Canary seed, but I
am sure it would not have survived long on that alone. I once
had a Black-necked Tanager that never would touch anything
but banana, and even that had to be exactly to its liking. If you
gave it a piece either not ripe enough or too ripe, it would go
without for hours, until it was changed.
All Tanagers are particularly fond of bathing, but some to
a more marked extent than others, some will lie in the bath and
literally soak, before splashing in the usual way, and come out so
wet, that they are totally&amp;apos;' unable to get to their top perches, and
others go in and make a great splashing and hop straight to the
top perch, having hardly wetted themselves at all. It is curious

Sir, --Call you advise me as to the feeding and housing, as to space
and water, sun and shade for a young Her ring Gull. At present it is in
rather a small uetted-in space on grass with a zinc tub for water with a few
stones and fed on a herring a day, worms and slugs! Is it not verv im-
portant the fish should be fresh ? Should sea shore grit be provided ? I
shall be most grateful for an answer. M. Drummond.
The following teply was sent to Miss Drummond.
These birds are extremely hardy and will do anywhere and on almost
anything. I presume it has its wing cut and could therefore, either be kept
in a netted enclosure or allowed to roam about the garden (if walled in).
I always fed mine on fish cuttings but they are not at all particular about it
being fresh; they will eat and thrive on scraps from the house and in fact
nothing conies amiss. They require a tub of water in which to bathe but it
need not be very large. The floor of their enclosure may be grass or rough
shingle but not sand as it clogs on the feet; grass alone is too damp in
winter. They do not require any overhead shelter but there should be some
bushes or large stones or something of the sort so that they may shelter
from stormy winds. J. I, Bonhote.

By Allen Silver.
The accompanying plate depicts an adult pair of hybrids
between (.Fringilla montifringilla) and (F. ccelebs), bred by Miss
Janette Reeves of Wateringbury Hall, Kent, and now the property
of our esteemed Editor; who requested me to supply notes re-
lative thereto. A description of the birds would, under the
circumstances, be supererogant, owing to the excellent handi-
work of the artist; it being only necessary for me to point out
that this pair is the result of a cross between the male Bramble-
finch and hen Chaffinch. In the nest feather, young birds
resemble in plumage, nestling Chaffinches, excepting that their
breast and cheek feathers are warmer in tone; a few smoky
marks are sometimes discernible on the nape and mantle ; the
wing when spread shows partly the combined characters of the
parents, and in addition to that fact that they are more sturdy
in build ; their movements and general demeanour favour the
Bramblefinch parentage. At this age, birds bred by crossing
with the sexes reversed (i.e. male Chaffinch X hen Bramblefinch)
are practically indistinguishable, as also are adult liens ; on the
other hand, adult males produced by crossing in this manner are
browner in tone and not generally so rich and distinct in colour
as when the male parent is a Bramblefinch.
It is common knowledge among those who keep in touch
with the work of hybrid breeders, that little certainty attends
their experiments; excepting perhaps in those cases when the
female parent is a Canary paired to a bird which readily fertilizes
her eggs. The rearing of hybrids between two British Finches

lias often been successfully accomplished by foster parents, in
the shape of Canaries, or in rarer instances by the parents them-
selves ; but in the case of Bramble-Chaffinch hybrids it seems
that not only are Canaries (however fed) useless for the purpose,
but that when placed under the care of Idnnets, Bullfinches,
Greenfinches and other birds that feed their young whilst in the
nest, largely upon regurgitated seed, the young hybrids always
die. Miss Reeves eventually discovered " friends in need " to
meet the case in the shape of Robins, Hedge-sparrows and
Greater Tits, which readily undertake the duties of hatching the
eggs and fostering the young hybrids until they are about eight
days old, after which they are hand-reared upon green cater-
pillars, aphides, etc. This lady, to whom lam much indebted for
many interesting details concerning her experiments, informed
me that the period of incubation is usually twelve days and that
she finds it better to use Bramblefinches as paternal parents, not
only because the resulting offspring are more beautiful, but
because male Bramblefinches are usually ready to fertilize eggs
by the time Chaffinch hens are laying the first or second batches ;
whereas by the time hen Bramblings are ready to lay, cock
Chaffinches have often commenced to moult or at least have lost
interest in domestic affairs. The method employed in obtaining
this cross, amounts to confining in a large garden aviary, twenty
or thirty hen Chaffinches paired accordingly; the eggs being
collected and the young reared in the manner described. Needless
to say many of these eggs are unfertile, and of those hatched, a
large percentage of the young, especially in the earlier experi-
ments, died, owing principally to the difficulty of obtaining foster
parents that could supply suitable food. Since 1907, Miss Reeves
has to my knowledge reared to maturity at least twenty hybrids of
this cross and is, as far as I am aware, the only individual who has
been able to accomplish such a feat* and I believe I am correct in
stating that the first Canary-Bullfinch hybrid was also bred by
this lady.
Among small cage birds, probably no greater profligate
exists than hens of the domesticated race of (,Serums canarius ) ;
although many of the reputed crosses between this bird and
Mr. John Howe, of Dundee, bred five B-C. hybrids some six years ago.

certain others belonging to the family Fringillidae have, upon
proper investigation, proved fallacious. In taking a retrospective
view of the situation and, at the same time, omitting all doubtful
instances, Serinus canarius (dom. var.) has produced hybrids
when paired to males of the following species : -- Serhius

I11 the foregoing, and in some other cases, hybrids can and
have been produced by reversing the position of the sexes ; but as
\0x25A0far as one can gather, males of Pyrrhula europcea have proved
useless as fertilizing agents. Whether any experiments have been
conducted in the direction of pairing a male of this kind to a hen
of P. griseiventris , I do not know. Such an attempt might prove
an exception to the rule; it is, however, sufficient to remark that
all Bullfinch crosses at present bred have been produced by
mating a hen of this species to a male of some congener.
The only authentic and successful unions that I am able to record
are as under :--

rementioned by Dr. Butler in his Notes on Hybrid Ploceidae.
Dr. Greene's correspondent " White Doe" may have been unused
to young birds and, probably, mistook the thick and clumsy
shortened head of a nestling for a sign of "Manuakin" parentage;
especially as no information is forthcoming as to the colour of
the birds' feathers. Concerning Saffron Finch hybrids, in Bird
Notes , Vol. 8 , f. 195, Mr. Willford, Ryde, I.W., mentions having
bred in his aviary birds believed to be the result of a cross
between Sycalis flaveola and Serinus flaviventris. Dr. Butler has
crossed A. flaveola and A. pelzelni , and in " P&amp;apos;oreigu Birds for
Cage and Aviary" remarks upon the hybrid males " being usually
indistinguishable from the sire of the Saffron Finch, but the
females more nearly approaching their mother." He was also
successful in obtaining a hybrid produced from the union of a
male Canary and hen Saffron Finch in 1898. Dr. Karl Russ, in
the translated version of Canary Birds, refers to Nonpareil and
Indigo Buntings as " adapted " for hybrid breeding with a
Canary.* In this country at any rate I cannot ascertain that such

ing offspring were necessarily mules.-- Ed. pro. tern.

Mr. Allen Silver,
a cross lias been bred. It is obvious that a list of Hybrid Frin-
gillidae cannot well be termed " complete," and in consequence
the writer would esteem any supplementary information regard-
ing " fringillid " hybrids not included here, and which have been
bred in cage or aviary. I might add, that although hybrid birds
have been bred between the Bearded Seedeater and Canary, I
have not included them in the Serin list owing to the fact that
that bird seems to be only a phase of Serinus icterus.
Although fertility is by no means uncommon among hybrid
birds belonging to other groups, it is singularly less frequent in
the case of " fringillid " hybrids. We know that Serinus hortu-
lanus when paired to S. cancirius (dom. var.) produces hybrids
perfectly fertile; but such crosses hardly can be termed hybrids,
i.e. if the late Dr. Sharpe and others are correct in regarding the
wild Canary as simply a large race of the common Serin. Dr.
Russ and others have found these " mongrels " freely fertile with
their progenitors and among themselves ; moreover, a Spanish
aviculturist who similarly experimented records in Cage Birds,
April 30th, 1910, the successful mating of a female " mongrel"
(Serin x Canary) containing |- ths Canary blood with a Greenfinch.
The bird died upon hatching; but such fertility in so-called
hybrids would lead one to agree with the correctness of Dr.
Sharpe's diagnosis.
The offspring resulting from crossing Sycalis flaveola x
6&amp;apos;. pelzelni are freely fertile (f. 103 Butler's Foreign Birds). It is,
however, an unsettled question in my mind whether the two
birds are sufficiently far apart for one to rank them as more than
distinct sub-species. Hybrids produced by crossing Chrysomitris
cucullata and a hen Canary (the Misla canatia~), however, are
usually regarded as prone to fertility. Miss Norman, in Vol. II.,
N.S., f. 282 records an instance, and in Bird Notes , Vol. III., Dr.
Hopkinson mentions having seen the offspring of a Hooded-
Siskin-Canary hybrid in the aviaries of Mrs. Reid, of Funchal,
Madeira, bred by crossing such a hybrid and a hen Canary.
Reputed instances of fertile Goldfinch-Canary, IJnnet-Canaty,
and Siskin-Canary mules, have from time to titire been recorded ;
but it is quite another matter to authenticate the cases. A cor-

1910, notified having bred from a four-year-old Linnet-Canary
mule paired to a hen Canary, five young birds. Later, a Mr. Reid
of the same district, together with other local fanciers, investigated
the matter, and agreed that no mistake had occurred. I think
nine young were bred that season, some being "dark," others
variegated, and two nearly white. Several of these birds were
sent down to London, and Mr. Geo. E. Weston (to whom I am
much indebted for particularly bringing the case under my notice)
a well-known judge of cage-birds, exhibited them before a body
of metropolitan fanciers : various opinions were naturally ex-
pressed as to their origin and incredulity ran rife. This gentle-
man assured me that the paternal parent was unquestionably a
Linnet-Canary mule (an opinion shared by an old hybrid expert,
Mr. Vale, of Clapham), and although I was, unfortunately, unable
to see this bird owing to the fact that it was at the time again
paired up with his former mate, Mr. Weston very kindly obtained
again from the North three of the reputed # Canary # Linnet
birds for me to examine. One, a white bird, strangely peculiar
in shape and appearance, had only a few grizzled feathers on its
mantle to relieve the otherwise sickly hue of its plumage. It
was evidently a hen ; but the other two birds, which were males,
upon examination, exhibited distinct, although faint (as one
would expect in a bird S Canary and # Linnet) cresentic bands
on their breast feathers; a significant fact, inasmuch as such
characters are unknown in the same feather tract of a pure green
Canary, but nearly always possessed by male Linnet mules and
by all normal male Linnets. This year, in Cage Birds, Sept. 2,
1911, Mr. Reid says that " it may interest readers to know that
the Mules from Mules bred by Mr. Murray (five birds previously
referred to in 1911) this year, are bred from the same cock Linnet
Mule and hen Canary that produced the youngsters I have pre-
viously written about, this year's birds being bred before I sent
the old pair on to a well-known muling expert who now has them
in his possession, of which more anon " ; therefore showing that
the pair are again fertile, which I understand has been effectually
confirmed by young having been produced since the pair has
been in the hands of another breeder.

Not being able to ascertain any accurate particulars of the birds
breeding, its parentage is open to doubt; nevertheless, although
it unquestionably shows Serin (Canary) parentage and looks fully
f Goldfinch it is interesting, and at least favourable, to allude to
the fact that it was mistaken in gaslight from a curious Gold-
finch.
The hybrid offspring of Ligurinus sinica aud L. chloris,
which I understand were bred at&amp;apos; the Zoo. some few years ago,
were found to be fertile. I am unable, however, just at the
present moment to vertify the particulars relating to the case.

( Concluded from page 2947.
The following day, March 22nd, near the liver bed which
mostly consists of big stones, I saw Sparrows, very many
Swallows, which I think were the commonest bird here, at any
rate, it was the one most often seen during the whole trip; Serins
in numbers, a small flock of little Barks were, as far as I could
make out, the Lesser Short-toed Lark (1 Calandrella minor), a small
sandy brown species, with the breast spotted and streaked with
dark markings. They were feeding by the road side among the
weeds growing 011 the rough ground near the river.
Some small birds kept hovering over some growing crops
near, uttering as they did so, a monotonous zig zig sort of note ;
they were shy and dived into cover when closely watched, so that
I was unable to see them clearly, but from their habits and notes
I have 110 doubt they were Fantail Warblers (Cisticola cisticola).
I often heard this bird elsewhere.
Later in the day, I saw a small flock of House Martins,
many Serins, and with them, Linnets, these last looked to me
smaller than our own birds and I should have been inclined to
have thought them Redpolls, but no such bird has, I believe, been
recorded from here. I watched a fine hen Pallid Harrier (Circus
vicerurus) flying over some growing corn, near a Palm Grove, and
also saw a couple of Ravens and I think a Wood Wren. Next day
at Old Biskra I saw Swallows, House Martins and a Senegal Dove

I passed a good many Larks, among them I think the Rufous-
headed Short-toed Lark (Calandrella brachydactyla itala ) and the
Pale Long-billed Crested Lark (Galerita ctistata arenicolci ). The
birds seemed to resemble closely the plate of this form in Mr.
Whitaker's " Birds of Tunisia ; " some of his finest specimens
were procured from this neighbourhood. About a dozen Senegal
Doves were feeding in the road, just outside the village, and a
couple of Scarabseus Beetles were trying to roll their ball up a
little incline.
Next morning I walked to some Palm Gardens near the
town where I saw a fine cock Redstart (Ruticilla Phoenicians), a
party of four or five Hoopoes (Upifa epops) were feeding on the
ground, these birds were always fascinating to watch, they look
pretty as they flit on banded wings among the trees, the crest is
generally raised, when they alight otherwise it is usually de-
pressed. There were, of course, other birds which I have already
mentioned. I noticed a couple of cock Wheatears (Saxicola
cenanthe) on the open plain, where there were many Desert Larks.
On some rocks I was very pleased to see a beautiful cock
Cream and Black Chat: in his book, Mr. Whitaker describes
four forms of these Cream and Black Chats, two Black-eared and
two Black-throated, an Eastern and Western form of each, but
Dr. Hartert has recently pointed out in Nov. Zool. XVII. p. 479
(1910) that there are really only two forms, an Eastern and
Western, each of which may, or may not, have the black throat.
The Western form is the most abundant in North-West Africa;
acording to Dr. Hartert, the proper name for this bird is Saxicola
hispanica hispanica. I believe the bird I saw belonged to this
race, general colour a beautiful creamy buff, darker on the back
than below, wings black, tail white with central feathers and a
terminal band on the rest black, lores and ear-coverts black ;
this particular bird seemed to have the chin black but this did
not extend very far down the throat, I watched him for some
time as he flew from stone to stone, every now and then uttering
a pleasing little song. O11 my way back I got a good view of a
Black Kite (Milvus migi&amp;apos;ans).
On the day after I drove to the Col de Sfa, a low rocky hill
a few miles from Biskra, a lovely view for many miles round can be

Mr. T. H. Newman,
had from the top. A pair of birds flying a good way off looked like
Egyptian Vultures, I think I saw a Black Kite and a pair of dark
looking Birds of Prey were perched on the very top of a rock,
but too far off to be sure what they were. A Black looking Chat
darted across below, I fancy it had a white crown and nape, so
most probably was a Wbite-rumped Chat (, Saxicola leucopyga ) t
which when adult, is a black bird with white crown, nape, rump
and tail-coverts, also the usual white Chat-markings on the tail.
Later in the day I saw a beautiful pale grey cock Pallid
Harrier in almost the same spot where I saw the hen bird three
days before. I came across what appeared to be a colony of quite
typically coloured Spanish Sparrows a little way outside the
town, the cocks had chestnut crowns, black stripes on the sides
of the breast and black and white markings on the wings ; Corn
Buntings were numerous, some little greenish Warblers which
from the amount of yellow, I think were Wood Wrens were busy
hunting for insects among the bushes. The Wryneck is a very
common bird here, the resident North-African bird has been
considered distinct from ours and has been named lynx mauret -
anica and Mr. Meade-Waldo has just called attention to the
difference in the notes of the two races. I caught sight of one
sitting on a Palm frond close to the trunk. Serins were in num-
bers ; a pair of Algerian Greenfinches in a small Olive tree, then
I saw a fine Woodchat Shrike (Lanins pomeranus) sitting motion-
less on the branch of a Mimosa tree. Woodchats are very
plentifully distributed throughout the country. I noticed a
couple of dull coloured Wagtails, greenish-grey above, eye-stripe
and entire under-surface including chin dull yellowish. I should
think they were immature birds, so cannot be sure of the species.
Common Redstarts were not uncommon, I saw one cock bird
and heard another. Last time I was here it was Moussier's
Redstart which was inhabiting the same spots, now this species
appeared absent. On the afternoon of the next day I visited the
Dunes de Sable, a district covered with curious low heaps of
soft sand, but saw nothing of much account as regards birds,
only the usual Swallows, a white Wagtail, a female Harrier was
flying over the Palm trees, I think it was a Pallid Harrier, it
showed very little white on the upper tail-coverts, a Hoopoe ; I
was just too early for the Bee-eaters, a few days later and plenty

of the beautiful little Blue-cheeked species might have been seen.
Several pairs of common Wheatears were by a small stieam, the
cocks frequently flying a short distance up in the air and down
again. A sandy-coloured bird on a sand heap may have been a
Desert Chat. The soft sand was everywhere maiked by the
curious herring-bone pattern of the tracts of Scorpions; an
Arab youth dug one out of a hole about two feet long with a
stick. The Scorpion was only a little over two inches long,
it was of a greenish-yellow colour.
March 27th was spent in the train. Storks were seen near
Batna ; at Kroubs there were numbers of Martins and Swallows,
the latter nesting in the waiting-room at the station. The
Sparrows seemed to be domesticus, with a dash of Spanish blood
as they had a good deal of black on the breast, but had not got
chestnut crowns. Hammam Meskontine was reached late in the
evening. At this charming place it was a great pleasure to meet
Mr. Meade-Waldo; he told me about the birds he had seen in
the neighbourhood and, as he made a lengthy stay, he could tell
us far more about them than I am able to do from my flying
visits. The day after my arrival was most glorious, being ex-
tremely bright and hot. I spent the morning by the hot spring
which runs through a charming luxuriant valley ; here I saw a
number of very brightly-coloured Algerian Greenfinches, they
seem much brighter than those I saw at Biskra. Swallows were
numerous, and I saw my first Alpine Swift ( Cypselus vielba ), a
fine mouse-grey coloured bird with a white undersurface crossed
by a mouse-grey pectoral band. Birds were very numerous, I
saw Hawfinches {Coccotlnaustes buvryi), the Algerian bird differs-
slightly in colour from ours, and has a rather smaller bill ; just
before, this had been the commonest bird here, swarming every-
where in thousands. Goldfinches and Greenfinches were in
flocks in the Olive trees which grow abundantly in the vicinity ;
Blackbirds and Thrushes, a Blackcap, a Hoopoe on the grass
near the stream, Corn Buntings on the ground, Ultramarine Tits
in the Palms, from which came the unmistakable note of the
Senegal Dove ; I was interested to find this bird so far North, as
it is much more common in the extensive Palm groves of the
South, but there were plenty of luxuriant Palms in this warm
valley to attract the Palm Doves. A pair of Tortoises were

Mr. T. H. Newman,
enjoying the hot sunshine and, later in the day, I saw three
others. In the afternoon I saw Algerian Chaffinches, some dark-
coloured Crested Larks, which I think were the Greater Small-
billed Crested Lark. In some bushes I came across a party of
three Dusky Bulbuls (Pycnonotus barba/us) : I was very pleased
to meet with this bird again, this was the only place where I had
seen it before, at a spot about a mile away from these present
birds. While I was watching them one flew on to the tall flower
spike of a large Asphodel--which is such a conspicuous plant
all over the country--and began to pluck and swallow one after
another about a dozen of the pinkish-white blossoms; this was
very likely for the honey they contained, as I found them very
sweet to the last. On my return I saw five or six of these birds
about the same place, I also saw a flock of Linnets on the ground.
Two Hoopoes were flying over the Olive trees ; a pair of Barbary
Partridges, which are very common here, flew whirring away.
Small birds were most numerous, every tree seemed to have a
flock, but they were all of the species I have already mentioned
as far as I could see.
I must not forget to mention, that I think I again saw the
Algerian Coal Titmouse at Hammam Meskontine; this bird is of
especial interest just at present as it is the form which seems to
some nearest to the recently described Irish Coal Titmouse (Panis
hibetnicies&amp;apos;), both birds having the cheeks, nucal spot, breast and
belly strongly washed with mustard yellow, but the Algerian bird
has the sides of the body and flanks greyish, these parts being
cinnamon in the Irish form.
During a short walk next morning I again saw plenty of
birds, including several species of Warblers and some Sparrows,
a couple of Starlings, whick I think belonged to the common
species, but as they were flying between me and the sun, I could
not make out their markings; but the finest sight was a magnifi-
cent Serpent Eagle (Circaetus gallicus ) which rose above the Olive
trees close to me with about a foot of Snake hanging from its
bill ; as it soared rapidly upwards the Snake gradually disappeared
down the Eagle's throat. Birds of Prey are numerous in this
neighbourhood ; Mr. Meade-Waldo told me he had seen ten
different species in one Gorge when riding through. With much
regret I left Hammam Meskontine a little before midday, arriving

at Bone about three in the afternoon. This is a prettily-situated
place with a fine bay, but the town itself is modern, mostly
European, and not of much interest. Hippo, with its memories
of St. Augustine, was visited the same afternoon. Storks were
common ; I heard Corn Buntings and, at dusk, a flock of Swifts
were flying high over the town, but the &quot;light was not good
enough to make them out clearly.
March 30th, took a short walk early by the harbour. A
few Black-headed Gulls, mostly immature, were flying about, but
some had the dark hoods of maturity ; a flock of Martins were
collecting mud at a puddle in the road, a few Swallows, Green-
finches and Warblers; the cock Sparrows had black stripes on
the breast with greenish-grey crowns. Some Storks were heard
early, and one seen to alight by its mate on its nest near the
station, over which several Alpine Swifts were wheeling.
Bone was left at n a.m. and Tebessa reached late in the
evening. The first pait of the journey is interesting, as the little
line passes through fine gorges and rocky country; for some
distance the course of a stream is followed, then the high plateau
country is traversed, coveied with a low Juniper forest: views of
rugged hills are obtained, and finally the level plain near Tebessa
is reached. Tebessa was a most important Roman town ; there
are many ruins, including a perfect little Temple of Minerva, an
interesting four-sided Gateway and, just outside, the magnificent
ruins of the largest Christian Basilica in Africa ; the town is still
surrounded by a high wall built of large stones. All this part of
the country was new to me. The morning after my arrival was
spent seeing the ruins. I noticed a Black Kite ; at the Basilica
were several Moussier's Redstarts and Sparrows, Swallows were
very numerous, they were nesting under the roof of the courtyard
of the little Hotel ; some lamps projected from the wall about six
feet up, each lamp had nearly always a Swallow sitting on the top,
they took not the slightest notice of passers-by, although they
were not above a couple of feet away. A few Irby's Ravens were
outside the town, also a number of Goldfinches in the trees, I also
saw Greenfinches ; Serins and Goldfinches were in cages. In the
afternoon I walked to the ruins of what is called Old Tebessa,
about a couple of miles from the present town ; they are not very
extensive. By a curious round structure, thought to have been a

Mr. T. H. Newman,
Roman bath, a pair of Moussier's Redstarts had their home, I
watched them for some time as they flew and hopped about the
loose stones lying about. A magnificent Arab gentleman, with
his three wives and families were also taking an afternoon stroll
round the ruins. A large dark Crested Rark was common in
pairs, a few Hoopoes were about, also some Wlieatears and acock
Algerian Chaffinch. On the way back, I saw two more pairs of
Moussier's Redstart flying about among the low bushes which
are scattered over the stony plain. All the Sparrows, even at
this out of the way place, seemed to be domesiicus.
I left early next morning, April ist, at a place called Clair-
fontaine, where rather a long stop was made. I noticed Sparrows
by the station, Serins in the Eucalyptus trees and a few Swallows
flyi ng round ; a fine pair of Egyptian Vultures were soaring over
the station, when first seen they were quite close so that an ex-
cellent view could be had of them ; they gradually went up almost
out of sight, but afterwards again returned. Rater in the day,
just as it was getting dark, I noticed a pair of white Storks sitting
on a low building and another pair on a haystack--these were
the last Storks seen.
I reached Tunis about 9.30 p.m. In the morning, 011 some
waste land near the harbour, I came across a flock of brightly-
coloured Wagtails, with bright yellow underparts; as most of
them had distinct white superciliary stripes and scarcely any
white on the chin, I think they were Blue-lieaded Wagtails
(Motacilla flava), but at least one bird among them had no white
eye stripe but a distinct white chin, which would seem to be the
Grey-headed Wagtail (A/, cinereocapilla). As several forms of
these Yellow-breasted Wagtails occur in Tunisia, there is no
reason why they should not mix during migration. There were
also a number of small light-brown Rarks, but they were very
wild ; I should think they were some sort of Short-toed Rark.
A very typical Spanish Sparrow was showing off just outside the
town. In the afternoon I walked to the borders of the inner
Rake of Sebka, es-Sedjoiemi, above the grassy slopes near the
water, what were probably Tunisian Sky-Rarks (A/auda arvensis
harterti ) were soaring aloft singing ; this is a paler and more
uifescent bird than ours and is the resident form in Northern
Tunisia. A small dark Crested Rark was plentiful, but wild, but

Corn Buntings were extraordinarily tame, sitting on the tops of
the low bushes within a few feet. An elegant Warbler, brownish
above, with conspicuous eye stripe and light underparts, was
possibly a Bonelli's Warbler. Flocks of Cormorants could be
seen from time to time flying over the water, and right in the
middle of the Fake, marching in single file, were a flock of
twenty-seven Flamingoes; I had them under observation for
quite half-an-hour, and could make out that they kept putting
their heads under water, every now and then one would flap its
wings, but I did not see any fly, they seemed to vary in size, but
they were a good way off. A pair of little Waders were running
actively about over the soft mud close to the water ; from their
dark legs and absence of a distinct band on the breast I took
them for Kentish Plovers (.AEgialitis alexandrina), a common
resident species. I also picked up several Duck feathers, but did
not see the birds themselves.
April the 4th and 5th were taken up by a visit to the most
interesting town of Kairouan. It is a sort of Arab Oxford or
Cambridge, as there are many Dervish Colleges or Zaouias, which
are very like ordinaiy Mosques: they contain many lovely
examples of exquisite tile and plaster Arabesque work. It is
considered a very sacred spot, the whole place is very Eastern-
looking and quaint. On the way there, from the train I got a
good look at a Southern Dittle Owl, which was sunning itself
by the side of the line--after glaring at the train it hardly con-
descended to fly a few yards away. I also saw a Hoopoe. From
the top of the big Minaret of the Great Mosque of Sidi Okba at
Kairouan, which is one of the finest Moorish buildings in exist-
ence, I watched a number of Swifts dashing about below and
up under the roof of the cloisters which surround the great
court-yard of the Mosque ; I have a note that some seemed a
rather pale mouse-colour, and I find that Mr. Whitaker says he
saw both Common (Cypselus opus&amp;apos;) and Pallid Swifts (C. vmrinus)
at this spot in the beginning of April, so I have no doubt I also
saw both species here. The Sparrows seemed to be Spanish. I
had hoped to find the Rufous Warbler here, as I had heard that
it had been seen a few weeks earlier. Some low mounds, covered
with a luxuiiant growth of an ice plant, just outside the walls,

were tlie favourite resort of Scorpions. Swallows, Corn Buntings
and a Hoopoe were also seen.
Returned to Tunis on the evening of the 5th. The next
day being my last in Africa I thought I would spend it in a visit
to the DjevelRessas or Read Mountain, a somewhat isolated peak
a few miles to the S.E. of Tunis, as I knew it to be the haunt of
Vultures and other birds. A light railway runs to Ravarie at the
foot of the mountain, the lower slopes are covered with Juniper
Scrub, among which small birds such as Goldfinches, Algerian
Chaffinches, Serins, Ultramarine Tits and Warblers were common.
After a somewhat stiff climb I reached the top, which somewhat
resembled a gigantic rock garden, as the spaces between the rocks
were bright with the varied hues of a multitude of beautiful
flowers, also a most wonderful view was obtained on all sides.
On one side, in the distance, Tunis could be seen with the sea
beyond, while on others, miles of open country or rocky heights
lay spread before one ; there was no lack of birds, though not so
many as I had hoped to see. Ravens flew round the higher
Doints, several Barbary Partridges were on the very top, as well as
a flock of Rinnets, Ultramarine Tits, a fine cock Moussier's Red-
start ; a Rock-dove dashed round at a tremendous pace, a female
Kestrel flew backwards and forwards below, a beautiful Serpent
Eagle, recognisable by its boldly banded undersurface, flew over
my head, while round a distant corner two large birds disappeared,
which I think were Griffon Vultures (Gyps fulvus)\ a colony of
these birds nested here for many years and may still do so. Not
a long list, but, nevertheless, I much enjoyed this excursion into
the country. I got back to Tunis about six in the evening. At
Tunis most of the Sparrows seemed to be Spanish. One morning
I think I saw some Sand Martins among a number of Swallows
and House Martins.
April 7th, at mid-day, Tunis was left behind. Several
Yellow-legged Herring Gulls and Black-headed, both adult and
young, but none with dark hoods, were flying about the harbour.
Just outside the Tunis canal I saw several Mediterranean Shear-
waters (Puffinus kuhli ) flying singly, low over the water. Thus
ended another five weeks visit to this interesting land, where
plenty of bright, hot sunshine was found, while frost and snow
were raging at home.

Sericulus melinus.
By Reginald Philupps.
At pages 51, 88, and 123 of Vol. IV. N.S., of our Magazine
may be found various notes on the Regent Bird, an exceptionally
handsome and interesting species, now probably extinct out of
Australia excepting only one pair, concerning which I propose
saying a few words.
In 1905, a young male was bred in my aviary ; and in July,
1910, I succeeded in obtaining a mate for him, one of the lot that
was brought to this country by Mr. Carrick in January, 1903.
This species, like other Bower Birds, constructs a regular
bower, a small affair by comparison with some others but very
interesting, and permanent if in a sheltered place. These bowers
are much more than mere ' play-grounds,' as it seems to be the
custom to call them uow-a-days. It is the spot where all the
Regent Birds of a district, of both sexes and all ages, congregate
together and where they become acquainted ; but at these General
or Courting Bowers the birds do not go beyond dancing, romp-
ing, and flirting.
As the nesting season draws near, the adult females with-
draw from the General Bower, scatter, and each makes a private
bower for herself, somewhat of the shape of a horse-shoe magnet
{ibid. pp. 61 and 62). I see that I called these 'love-parlours'
before, but probably the name 'Nuptial Bower' would be better.
In these Nuptial Bowers, each by herself, the females, who are
understood to out-number the males, use all their arts to attract
a male. For a while, the two birds are all in all to one another
in and around the Nuptial Bower, the female commences to
build, the Nuptial Bower--or what remains of it--is scattered to
the winds, the spot is deserted, and the male goes off after female
No. 2 in another Nuptial Bower elsewhere, leaving the first to
finish her nest by herself, lay two beautiful eggs, sit upon them
for 1S-19 days, hatch out two chicks with bills and legs of a
leaden-black colour, and whitish down with a leaden tinge,
rather irregularly distributed, and so developed on the top of the
head as almost to form a mop. When, as brancliers, they have
cast the down from the head, they adopt on the crown a brown-

black bar running across from behind each eye, with two horns
projecting forward--in the fledgeling male in the form of a
Turkish crescent, in the female pointing nearly straight forwards
towards the nostrils {ibid. pp. 126-7).
This year, my female built her first nest in the top of a
poplar, about 8ft. from the ground, and laid the usual two eggs.
The male, not having a second female to follow 011 with, and
having a little weakness for raiding other birds' nests, improved
the occasion by raiding his mate's--and stole the eggs. The
female touched up the nest, and was in course of laying a second
clutch when she was laid low by the unusually severe thunder-
storm, or series of storms, with fusillades of hail of remarkable
violence, which occurred on May 31. She was so seriously
affected that for a while her life was despaired of; of course the
eggs did not come to anything. On being discharged from the
hospital, she ruefully inspected the nest. Owing to the dry
weather, the foliage of the tree had not developed sufficiently to
form a shelter, and the storm had not spared it. Without wasting
time she set to work and builded another nest, about 9ft. from
the ground, on the top of some birch brooms which are fastened
against the house and protected from rain by a board. I care-
fully watched the Nuptial Bower, or rather the site--for on each
of the three occasions they returned to the same spot--and
immediately it was deserted, on the evening of June 29, caught
and shut up the male. I cannot be sure whether the first egg
was laid on July 1 or July 2. Incubation commenced on the
morning of July 2, the first nestling was hatched by the morning
of the 20th, and, by the 22nd (I was unable to watch on the 21st),
both were out of the shell. One died on the 26th, the other on
the 28th--it is suggestive that each seems to have died during a
thunder-storm.
In 1905, the breeding Regent Bird laid her eggs in a
basket which I had filled with hay ; she did not build a nest
(ibid. p. 65),
This year the mother Regent, who could not have seen a
Regent Bird's nest since she left Australia 8-9 years ago, insisted
upon building a perfectly orthodox nest of the species. Ignoring
all my elaborate preparations, with no little labour she constructed
two entirely original nests and a ' repair,' and all after a pattern

not to be found materially nearer than Australia, but very present
in her own inner self at the proper season--such are the wonders
of Nature !
The nests were a kind of hybrid between a Wood-Pigeon's
and that of an English Jay, adapted to the surroundings--a stout
structure of fairly thick sticks, lined with finer twigs and hay.
They had a definite cup, some five inches across by two and a
half deep. As regards the last, from my 'watch-tower' a few
feet away, which brought my eyes slightly above the level of the
nest, I could not see the eggs, nor the young when in repose
At first the female sat like a wild bird, and all that could be seen
of her was just the line of the crown and bill. Soon she relaxed,
and a little of the body might be seen ; and sometimes, when very
warm, she would half stand : two slight depressions in the nest
indicated where the feet were wont to rest. She was very incon-
spicuous and absolutely mute. When feeding the nestlings at
first, she could not be seen to carry food nor were there signs of
regurgitation ; she held her head down and seemed to allow a
semi-fluid to flow from her mouth into theirs, doubtless the
product of severe mastication. She swallowed the excreta. Tike
the female in 1905, she was a most devoted mother.
I obtained my first Regent Bird twenty years ago this
August; and since August, 1899, the species has been represented
here without a break ; but I have now parted with my old friends
--for the male was a sore robber. The two birds I have now
been writing about have gone to the Zoo., and their nest has
gone to the Natural History Museum.

By Hubert D. Astley, M.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Although, as I reported in a previous number of the
Magazine, my Orange-headed Ground Thrushes were unsuccess-
ful in rearing to maturity the three youngsters that they hatched
in June, I am able now to give a more favourable account, for
one young bird of the second brood has been successfully brought
up. The parent birds set to work immediately after the loss of
their first family to repair the old nest, which I find was firmly
plastered on to the shelf of a nesting box, and made after the
foundation of wet earth had been placed, of moss and fine bents,
forming inside a neat cup.
A good supply of ants' eggs, wasps' grubs and cockroaches
enabled the Thrushes to rear their young.
Whether the bird is a male or female I cannot yet tell. In
colour, the upper part of the head and shoulders is a dark cin-
namon brown, the wings, etc., a much deeper brown, the wing-
coverts having straw-coloured spots at the end of each feather,
forming two bars of that colour across each wing. The cheeks
are fawn-coloured with some darker colour intermixed, and the
throat and whole under surface is also fawn, with an indistinct
band of dusky brown across the breast.
It is quite easy to tell the adult male from the female;
for in the former, when in proper colour and condition, the
cinnamon-orange of the head and underparts is decidedly richer
and the grey of the back is much purer, for in the female the
back is greenish-grey, and the colour of the head certainly paler.
Iu my former notes, I described the eggs which I saw in
the nest before the first brood was hatched.
These Thrushes are fine songsters, but like other birds,
seem to vary in vocal powers amongst individuals.
I fancy that this is the first time that they have been bred
in England.

Ortyz cubcinensis. (Gould).
I have also bred this beautiful Ouail, or Coliu, which is,
I believe, distinct from the "Bobwliite" of North America.
In June the female constructed a nest in some long grass,
hollowing out a receptacle for her four creamy-white eggs, rather
smaller and rounder than those of the Californian Quail's, and
pulling a roof of grass over to conceal it.
I believe the hen bird would have laid more eggs, but
during the spell of chilly weather that we had at the time of the
Coronation, she died, and I had to put the eggs under a Bantam ;
the result of which is that I have two young ones now half
grown (14th of August).
When first hatched they were tiny balls of very dark-brown
fluff, but now the crown of their heads is cinnamon brown, the
underparts pale fawn, and the upper parts dull brown, each feather
on the back and wing-coverts having a straw-coloured quill with
the same tint former a small spot at the extremities.
Since they have been hatched some half-grown rats man-
aged to squeeze through the wire-meshing, out of which some
Parrot-finches had never escaped ! and killed not only the male
Cuban Colin, but also three Parrot Finches.
Can I, in the case of the young Cubans, again claim to be
the first in the British Isles in rearing them ?

Daulias philomela.
By W. E. Teschemaker, B.A.
(Concluded from page 3247.
The courtship of the male was a delightful thing to watch.
With drooping wings and tail spread fan-wise and carried erect
in Peacock fashion he would run up and down a ledge a few feet
from the ground, gazing solicitously downwards at the female on
the ground below and singing incessantly. Another distinctive
feature of the courtship of the male was quite new to me, and
may perhaps be peculiar to the Sprosser. He would make a
kind of dash at the female from a distance of a couple of feet
and, just before reaching her, would spring in the air, apparently
turning a complete somersault, and drop to the ground again on
the spot from which he started, repeating the performance several
times.
The female, however, did not require much courting.
Unlikely as it may appear, this insectivorous bird, reputedly
delicate, caught in Central Europe in early May and sent by rail
and steamer a distance of more than a thousand miles, commenced
a nest in Devonshire on the 25th, completed it on the following
day, and by the last day of the same month in which it was trapped,
had laid its full clutch of four eggs. Of course this is a very
unusual experience, but, whatever view we may take of it, it
tends to prove that a Nightingale may be trapped even in the
breeding season and despatched on a long and trying journey
with so little shock to its mental or bodily health that it is willing
and able to breed in captivity within a month of the date of its
loss of liberty, and furnishes a convincing answer, I think, to

on the Nesting of the Sptosser.
those who claim that there must be cruelty in caging wild birds.
I do not, however, wish to sail under a false flag so I take this
opportunity of also saying that I do not think that anything will
quite compensate a bird for the loss of its liberty--not the most
skilful treatment, the most generous diet or the most spacious
aviary in the land : we can, however, at least claim to make them
fairly comfortable.
To return to our Sprossers. The nest was constructed in
a little hollow in the side of the mound mentioned above, under a
projecting tuft of grass. The foundation was entirely composed
of the dead spathes which had fallen from the bamboos, lined
with fine grass, and was so deep that its contents could only be
seen from a point directly above it. It was entirely constructed
by the female. On the 27th, the little architect took a day's rest.
O11 the 28th, and following days, the four eggs were laid: incu-
bation commenced 011 the 29th and was completed in thirteen
days.
Eggs.
I quite expected that the eggs would be of the same dis-
tinctive shade as those laid by D. luscinia , but I was wrong.
Bree says: " It lays five or six eggs . . . very similar to those of
our well-known species. Count Mulile says the egg is generally
darkly spotted, which is not however mentioned by Temminek
and denied by Degland. All the specimens sent to me are deep
olive ; one lighter in colour." I can only say that this particular
clutch was very much lighter than any clutch that I have seen
of D. luscinia , and unspotted ; our Editor, however, to whom I
sent a portion of the shell of a hatched egg tells me that it is not
lighter than some eggs of D. luscinia in his collection.
Immature Peumage.
On the nth June two young birds hatched and were most
carefully brooded by the female and fed by both parents up to as
late as 8.15 p.m. They were covered with very dark down. The
male, who had taken no part in incubating the eggs, now showed
himself quite as attentive in the matter of feeding as the female.
The latter was an exceptional mother ; she refused to leave her
nest when I cut off a bough which overhung the latter and, when
on the 13th I was watering the shrubs with a hose, she evidently

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
observed that some of the fine spray was falling on the nest, and
at once returned to the latter though I was only a few yards
away. On the 14th, we had a night frost of sufficient severity to
blacken the potatoes.
By the 16th, the young seemed to have cast a good deal of
down and on the following day some small feathers were showing
on the wings which, as in the case of D. luscinia, were greyish ;
on other parts of the body they were bare. On the 18th, they
were showing some feathers on the dorsal tract, and on Coronation
Day the first young Sprosser left the nest.
The old birds showed great anxiety for its safety and upon
the smallest indication of danger continuously uttered a very
shrill, high-pitched whistle which might be rendered " tseet-
tseet." Their anxiety, however, seemed to me singularly un-
necessary, for the young Sprossers were adepts in the art of
taking cover. Their dark brown plumage, mottled with yellowish
spots, harmonised remarkably well with some bay shrubs in
which they generally perched and, if dislodged from this strong-
hold, one would hear a scuttling among the dead leaves and
would perhaps catch a fleeting glimpse of some brown shadows
streaking away in the direction of the bamboo jungle. When
asking for food they would utter a subdued " chik-chik," and
their parents would respond with a resonant " cur-r-r."
O11 the 26th, I succeeded in cornering one and examined it.
The wings and tail were a very dark brown, darker than the
immature plumage of D. luscinia and without any trace of red;
the yellowish spots were also more symmetrically arranged--the
lower back and flanks having almost the appearance of barring--
and the upper breast showing distinct striations.
On the 27th the adult male, who had ceased singing after
the j^oung left the nest, piped up again and both parents sunned
themselves lazily, evidently feeling that their anxieties were over
and success in sight. It is remarkable what heat the Sprosser
can stand ; the old birds could be seen sunning and apparently
enjoying themselves when the thermometer registered 120* Falir.
(in the sun) and other birds were gasping in the shade. Still, as
we have seen, many of them winter under or near the Equator.

--the young Sprossers came along very fast; their tails grew to
almost full length, and they began to wave them up and down in
the dignified manner of their parents. The curious undulatory
action of the tail is very characteristic of this species, but is
rather hard to describe. Some idea of it may be conveyed by
comparing the tail to a fan spread out and held horizontally, one
coiner being then slowly depressed and the rest following with a
wave-like motion.
The Moult.
By the iotli July they were moulting fast and losing the
buff spots. What a strange thing is this moult of young birds
which have only recently left the nest and whose constitutions
cannot have hardened sufficiently, one would think, to withstand
this heavy tax on their vitality! Can the protection (if any)
afforded by the nestling plumage be a sufficient compensation
for the strain on the system, or is Nature so devoted to her
traditional procedure, so tied down by " red-tape," that she
cannot permit an embryo to quit an egg-shell and develop into
a young Sprosser without passing it through certain stages of
development reminiscent of its ancestry? I vote for the latter
explanation, because I cannot bring myself to believe that a
young Sprosser is appreciably less conspicuous when ticked with
buff spots than in its autumn plumage.
By the 14th the young birds had shed a large area of the
immature plumage, and the adults had lost their tails and looked
very ragged.
On the 20th, I was shown a young Nightingale, which had
been trapped, and noticed that it was not nearly so forward as
the young Sprossers.
I caught the Sprossers in the first week of August and
brought them into the house. The adults could be distinguished
by their longer beaks and by the warmer colour of the tail and
rump ; in other respects it was very hard to distinguish them.
General Remarks.
The Sprosser is certainly a very easy species to breed,
which fact has been especially brought home to me by some
humiliating failures this season with fine broods of species, such
as Garden Warblers and Whitethroats, which one would have

thought would be quite as easy to rear. Further, there was no
sacrifice of bird-life iu obtaining a breeding pair; all the eggs
hatched ; all the young were reared and finer young birds it
would be hard to find.
I make it a rule to part with all species after breeding
them, so I hardened my heart and advertised the Sprossers with
other surplus birds at a very moderate price. The result amused
me. Some of the birds (which I should describe as most unin-
teresting) were sold by wire and could have been sold several
times over, but for the glorious song of the Sprosser--surely one
of the greatest achievements of Nature--there was practically
no demand.
In this country there is a demand for Fire-finches and for
Cordons Bleus, but no one wants Nightingales. It is useless to
criticize public opinion and equally useless to attempt to influence
it. They tell me, however, that there was once a man who really
did mould avicultural taste, and that the modern craze (suggestive
word this!) for keeping delicate foreign birds is largely due to
him. If this is correct, I wonder whether that aviculturist sleeps
quietly today or whether his disembodied spirit is compelled to
wander, haunting bird-shops and bird-shows and the ash-pits of
enthusiastic disciples, wringing spectral hands and ceaselessly
bewailing the havoc his example has wrought. For many of his
followers, however, there is this excuse that they probably know
not what they do. If they once realised that for every Cordon
Bleu or Fire-finch which pays a brief and chilly visit to this
country, nine other little lives have generally petered out
miserably somewhere between their aviaries and the Equator,
I feel sure they would take up some other branch of aviculture.
It is because I feel strongly on this subject that I venture
to suggest that in breeding European species, such as the above,
one has an interesting pursuit and at the same time the satisfac-
tion of feeling that there need be no waste of bird-life. Of course
it involves a great waste of time, but, if one chooses to waste one's
time, that is one's own affair: if we waste bird-life, other people
may reasonably claim to have something to say about the matter.

There is not very much to report this month in the way of
nesting as this is now over for the year.
Since my last notes five young Martineta or Crested Tina-
mous have been hatched and are being carefully reared by their
father. The eggs of this species are a beautiful grass green in
colour with the glossy surface common to the eggs of this group
of birds. The chicks are very hemipode-like in appearance.
A very fine specimen of the Yellow-naped Cassowary
(Casuarius unappendiculatus occipitalis ) from the island of Jobi,
has been deposited by the Hon. Walter Rothschild and forms a
very valuable addition to our seiies of these fine birds, while
another important addition is a Red-crested Touracou ( Turacus
eryihroloplms&amp;apos;) from West Africa deposited by Mr. E. J. Brook.
It is one of the most beautiful of a group in which the majority
are beautiful and the species has not been represented in the
Zoological Gardens since 1878.
Dr. Hopkinson has sent us from Gambia a pair of Broad-
Tailed Babblers {C?atetopus plalycercics), very rare and interesting
birds which appear to be entirely new to aviculture. D. S-S.

There are undoubtedly others who are more entitled to
write upon this subject than I am, by reason of their greater
experience and maturer knowledge, but I have been asked to do
so, and I therefore will do my best.
Parrots are, for the most part, when duly acclimatized,
extremely hardy, and thrive better iu fresh air and a not too
artificially heated atmosphere, than in ill-vented rooms or glass
houses.
This applies especially to the smaller Parrots and Parra-
keets. For example, I have had such birds as Red-capped
Parrakeets ( Porphyrocephalus spurius&amp;apos;), Cockateels, Stanleys, Port

Lincolns and Pennants passing the winter entirely out of doors,
with only shelters, and those unheated. The gloss and tightness
of their plumage, as well as their activity and sprightliness,
testify to their robust health.
I have had to break the ice in the bathing dishes for these
birds to take their baths, which they often do directly the fresh
water is poured in ; for Parrots delight in bathing, and the differ-
ence between a bird that has a bath and one that hasn't, is very
marked.
I wonder if the inmates of the host of cages in the Parrot
House at our London Zoological Gardens ever have a good
syringing. It would be a long task, but perhaps in the warm
weather it is done. Were I their keeper, I should make a point
of syringing half a dozen each day, putting them outside to do
so, and removing the seed and sand trays first of all, afterwards
sponging the cage dry before returning the food, etc.
I know a Jardine's Parrot, and on visiting it one day, I
suggested to the owner that the bird looked as if a bath would
improve its appearance. "lam so afraid of its catching cold,"
was the reply. I pointed out that it would on the contrary be
more inclined to prevent its doing so, especially as it is a very
tame bird and can be taken on the hand to flutter its wings and
so shake off any superabundance of water.
I called another day, and the bird looked fifty times better
in his plumage. Of course one must be sure that a parrot is in
good health, and if it has been used to ablutions of this sort, the
water (if it will not or cannot take its own bath) should be only
slightly sprinkled at first. But I have Parrots whose plumage
is so tight and so accustomed to a syringing, that one has to
spray with force before the feathers are apparently wetted : and
although individual birds do not always approve of a shower-
bath at the moment, they evince great pleasure directly it is
over, shaking themselves and preening their feathers and often
attempting another bath in their drinking water!
It is unnatural to keep a Parrot indoors all through the
year without a bath, when one thinks of the drenching tropical
rains through which they fly, and the daily baths in some
mountain stream or forest pool which they enjoy.

Practical Bird-Keeping .-- VIII. Parrots. 377
And in Australia, where Parrakeets are often far from
water through a great part of the day, there must be a certain
amount of dew-drenched grass through which they run and
scramble when seeking their breakfast. Parrots' feet too keep
in better condition if they are syringed.
Not long ago, I received a pair of Hooded Golden-
shouldered Parrakeets from the Continent. They are acclima-
tized birds, and it was delightful to see how, when I hooked a
roomy bath on to their cage, they lowered themselves into the
water and splashed and splashed. One felt the vibrations of their
pleasure very strongly. But newly-imported birds must not be
treated in this way, not at least until they are thoroughly strong
and decidedly healthy, by which time they have probably ceased
to be newly-imported!
As to the food of Parrots, taking first of all such families
as those of the Macaws, Cockatoos, Amazons, etc., some people
recommend boiled maize as a staple supply, but they usually do
well upon a good Parrot's mixture of various dry seeds, such as
sunflower, oats, maize, etc. Besides this, a little Marie or Albert
biscuit put in a mixture of three equal parts of boiled milk,
barley-water, and water, and pressed fairly dry, is good ; and this
in cold weather may be given warm in the morning. Fruit too
of every kind, of course. Bananas, apples, pears, oranges, grapes,
figs, etc. A piece of boiled potato occasionally, seems to be
appreciated, and also a bunch of chickweed or a lettuce leaf in
season. Some wood, somewhat decayed, is knawed to pieces
with much interest, and I sometimes put some coarse grit in the
seed-pan.
But these Macaws and Parrots should not have coffee or
tea or rich cake, as are offered them, and certainly not meat.
Parrots do not need to be feeding all day, for in a wild state I
believe they sit for hours during the heat of the day, snoozing
amongst the deep foliage of the trees, feeding chiefly in the
morning and towards evening.
The smaller Parrots and Parrakeets (I am not writing
about Lories, the Brush-tongued Parrakeets, for I prefer to leave
that task to someone who has had more experience than I have,
although I might say en passant that they need the mixture of

biscuit sop already mentioned, as well as soft fruits--the smaller
Parrots and Parrakeets, as I was about to say, will do well on
Canary and millet and other seeds, with some hemp seed added
in the winter, and even a very sparse addition of linseed, but they
also like fruit, especially apple in winter time, and strawberries
in summer, and what is almost most important, especially for the
Australian Parrakeets, an abundance of salad in the shape of
groundsel, chickweed, etc., etc., as well as flowering grasses, as
soon as there is no frost on the ground. I generally leave off
green food of this description by perhaps the middle of October
(although it depends upon the weather) and recommence it with
care in the middle of February. But it must then be of a fresh
growth, and not be sodden with rain, or frost-bitten. Chicory
leaves are beneficial in winter-time, if grown in a frame, but great
care must be taken at that season of the year.
From March to October, my Parrakeets usually have an
abundance of green food put fresh every day into the aviaries,
and a nice bunch into each cage. Where there are Budgerigars
and such like, a large bouquet of grasses, etc. can be wired
round a stout stick, which can be fixed in a flower pot. If the
bunches are wired round the stems, it enables the birds to pull
at what they want, as if it was actually growing, and at the same
time prevents the stuff from being scattered untidily about the
aviary. I believe my young Bourke's Parrakeets, etc. are fed
almost entirely upon half digested green food and grass seeds,
and they usually leave the nest in the pink of condition. After
all, it is their natural food, and consequently most necessary.
And Parrots need water to drink, care being taken that the
water vessels are well scrubbed out, and even scalded ; for one
sometimes sees them with a nasty slime at the bottom, which
must assist in generating microbes of some kind or another.
Parrots, like all birds, need wing exercise to keep them
healthy and robust, although one sees individuals living in cages
year in and year out, who are never able to stietch and flap their
wings : and Parrots are as swift and agile on the wing as any other
birds. I have an especially tame Queen Alexandra Parrakeet
(Spalhoplenis alexandrce , as it is dubbed !) which is kept in a cage,
but is let out at least twice a week for a fly in a large room. To

see that bird swoop round and round for two or three minutes at
a time, shrieking with joy and exuberance of spirits, is delightful.
If possible the larger Parrots and Cockatoos should be trained to
come on the hand, or at any rate on a stick, when they can be
waved up and down to make them flap their wings. They will
soon learn what they are intended to do, and look out for these
gymnastics.
I know a lover of Parrots, who always takes Macaws and
Amazons for walks in the garden. They are chained to perches,
and after removing them from the latter, he will put them on the
ground, holding their chains, and allowing them to walk in the
wet grass, or else sit on an old stone wall, where they sun them-
selves and chew mortar.
A Double-fronted Amazon which I have, loves to be taken
on a personally-conducted tour like this, and when he is put on
a railing and syringed, he brings his wings completely forward
in front, so that they actually meet, whilst he ducks his head
down on to his breast beneath his wings, as much as to say, " I
like it on my wings, but I cannot stand it in my eyes and mouth."
Certain species of Parrots must necessarily be kept in
artificial heat during the cold months of the year, but it is
astonishing what some, which one would think might be delicate,
can stand.
As for the nesting of Parrots in an aviary, the fewer there
are the better, and in some cases one pair only is advisable. If
the aviary is large enough, and they can be obtained, old hollow
limbs of trees put up upon cross beams are helpful towards
encouraging the birds to breed, but there are many ways of
making nesting-boxes.
Parrakeets like to get into semi-darkness to lay their eggs,
and if they can whittle the natural rotten wood within, all the
better. Whatever the hollow is, it must not be too spacious or
flattened where the eggs will be laid, or they may roll out beyond
the parent bird. It is best to put nesting boxes of various sizes
and shapes, for what one pair of birds may take a fancy to,
another may not.
All Parrots nest in hollow logs or banks, laying their eggs
in a depression on rotten and chipped wood, except perhaps the

log.
For Budgerigars cocoa-nut husks do well, but it is advisable
to either cleanse or destroy these after a while, for fear of red
mite, etc. within. In any case, the nesting-boxes must be roomy
enough for the young birds to keep in until their due time arrives
for flying, otherwise they may crawl out and fall down with
disastrous results, but the boxes must not be so deep that they
cannot get out at all.
Parrots and Parrakeets will often take a year or more, and
even three or four before they nest, so that if any aviculturists
have a pair of birds about whom they are beginning to feel dis-
heartened in this respect, let them be patient and they may be
finally rewarded.
PRACTICAL BIRD-KEEPING.--CORRESPONDENCE.
Sir, --I have just lost a pair of year-old Black-shouldered Peafowl,
evidently from lack of power to moult. Both were a mass of pin feathers
and very few had pushed through.
They were hatched here just a year ago, and had always been well
and strong. They have, however, never had free range, having been kept
in not large aviaries--about ioft. by 20ft.
What treatment would you have recommended for these birds ? We
have another brood now&amp;apos;, two months old, and we hope to learn how to
safely carry them through. J. E. Rothweiu,.
The following 1 eply was sent to Mr. Rothzvell :--
I think that there is no doubt that Mr. Rotliwell's Peafowd want a
more generous diet during the moult. He does not say how they have been
fed, but possibly on grain alone. I should advise an addition to their usual
allowance of grain (which ought to be varied, and not always the same),
some meal (barley for choice), scalded with a little Spratt's meal, as a good
addition to their grain, when moulting; also a little chopped up cooked
meat, boiled potato, raisins or other cheap fruit, earthworms.
I do not keep Peafowl, but I find it is a good thing to give such things
to the more delicate pheasants and Tragopans wdien they are moulting.
Of course the object is not to merely mature the moult--an easy operation;
but to help them to grow the best feathers possible.
W. H. ST. Quintin.
