The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not, in the opinion of the Council, be known to have been
previously bred in captivity in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member
wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the
Magazine within about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young, and
furnish such evidence of the facts as the Council may require. The Medal will
be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough to feed
themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents. The question of
awarding a Medal for the breeding of local races or sub-species of species that
have already been bred shall be at the discretion of the Council. No Medal can
be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Council reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures o.\ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [ name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."

By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
" The trading vessels continually bring away considerable numbers
in cages : but they are so tender that most of them die in their passage
to our colder climates. It has also been remarked that many of them
have dropped down dead through timidity at the firing of a vessel's
great guns."
So wrote the Rev. Thomas Smith in 1806.
It has certainly been our experience that when newly imported
the Red-faced is incomparably the least hardy and most timid of all
the lovebirds known to Aviculture. Newly imported birds are very
subject to cerebral haemorrhage, brought on by fright. In spite of
exercising every possible care we have, at various time, lost dozens.
The sudden opening of a door or window, the entry of a visitor to
the bird-room, even a quick movement has proved quite sufficient to
cause a fatality. We have often marvelled that any manage to reach
these shores alive.
The Red-faced, alone amongst the lovebirds, is invariably im-
ported with the flight-feathers of one wing cut : this is often done with
such carelessness that the wing itself is mutilated. It used to be
recommended that the stumps of the quills should be removed--one
or two at a time, repeating the operation about once a week until all
are removed. We would hesitate to follow such a recommendation.
The shock of handling alone would more than likely prove fatal to a
bird already very considerably debilitated by the rigours of trapping
and importation, coupled with injudicious treatment generally. In
the past we have had hundreds of Red-faced, all too many have been
short-lived, but survivors have invariably been allowed to moult the
stubs naturally. In addition, no attempt has ever been made to induce
a false moult.

Many aviculturists have had good pairs of adult birds in hard
condition. Why then do they not breed with them ? The main
trouble appears to be that the ordinary aviculturist has a somewhat
defeatest attitude towards this species. He knows that the majority
of the imported lovebirds are comparatively free-breeders and that
the Red-faced has a very bad reputation in this respect, having rarely
got much beyond the laying of eggs. He argues there must be some
very good reason : and instead of trying, let alone persevering, he
tries his luck with birds that are, by general consent, more likely to
prove breeders. He cannot be blamed, for, after all, most aviculturists
are limited as regards aviary space, and we all do like to breed birds !
I have been keeping this little parrakeet almost continuously for
nearly thirty-five years. During the past four years especially, the
effort to breed it has been both extensive and sustained, and it is the
events of this period that I propose to detail. Let me here say that
the many years, with their seemingly endless disappointments, have at
long-last proved rewarding in that we have now reared a single
young one.
In the early part of 1953 we constructed what we hoped would
prove an acceptable aviary, providing the very necessary seclusion :
being such timid birds it is absolutely essential that they should enjoy
a sense of security. It measures 24 ft. by 18 ft. by 7 ft. 6 in. high ; the
materials being J in. wire-netting and larch poles. Three sides are
totally enclosed and the fourth, the one with the gate, three-quarters
enclosed with sheets of asbestos. The roof is covered with asbestos
sheets to a width of 4 feet on the north side, and 2 feet on the three
others. The enclosure contains a shelter 8 ft. by 3 ft., raised 3 feet from
the ground, and seven or eight nut-bushes. At the outset four full-size
bales of peat-moss were mounted on staging in the centre of the aviary.
But this did not prove a success and, as will be seen later, we had
recourse to a method somewhat similar to that originated by Edward
Boosey and used by him in his experiments before the war.
The 18th May, 1953, dawned bright and clear, and with the weather
forecast " Fine, with long, sunny spells " we judged the time had
come to introduce our small flock. Ten specially selected pairs were
released and all proved to be strong fliers. They very quickly settled
down, but in the afternoon there was torrential rain, during which the
entire flock remained out ! Fortunately, and to our great surprise,
there were no ill-results. During the next few months there were
several deaths, and as bird-room birds moulted and became full-
winged they were added to the community to make good the losses.
From the first, great interest was shown in the bales of peat-moss
and soon several pairs were busily engaged excavating holes. But
unfortunately they were not content merely to excavate nesting sites,
they bored, and with such good purpose that they ran tunnels right

through the bales--they just didn't know when to stop ! No eggs
were laid which was, perhaps, just as well.
Came October with slight ground frosts and on the 7th we judged
the time had come to bring them in for the winter. The catching up
of birds in a largish aviary is at no time easy. I am not particularly
good with a net and so, albeit with many qualms, I entrusted the
operation to two well-known experts, who must of necessity remain
nameless. But put not your trust in experts ! These two could not
have been more inexpert and were quite incapable of appreciating
the delicacy of their task and, in spite of my explicit instructions and
frequent exhortations to exercise the greatest care, caught them up
regardless of everything and damn the consequences. The result was
very much worse than anything even I had foreseen. Twenty birds
were caught up and within a week half of our precious stock had died
from concussion, cerebral haemorrhage, and pneumonia consequent on
shock. As can be well-imagined it was a very distressing and dis-
couraging experience.
We still had a number of birds in various stages of moult, and during
the next few months we were able by various and devious means to
buy in a couple of dozen or so newly imported birds. Then started a
further series of losses, all the old causes, but by the end of April, 1954,
we had 31 good birds, including 10 from the previous year,
ready for turning out. In the meantime the bales of peat-moss had
been replaced by eight large grape barrels, approximately 34 inches
deep by 14 inches across the mouth, which had been filled with wet
peat-moss, rammed hard. Then on nth May, a glorious day with a
temperature of 82* F., we turned out the flock. Within an hour a very
fine male managed to hang itself in the fork of a bush, and next
morning a male and a female were picked up dead--fractured skulls.
Thenceforth nothing untoward happened.
The barrels proved very acceptable and provided both constant
amusement and outlets for unlimited energy. Several were more or
less seriously " occupied " and at one time we had high hopes, but
month followed month and no young ones made their appearance.
Towards the end of September there was very considerable activity
in the barrels, apparently a sort of autumn cleaning. Fourteen whole
eggs and many fragments were thrown out of the nests. None had
contained a chick, and we were, in fact, unable to determine whether
any had been fertile as all were quite dried up.
As some will remember the summer was not worthy of the name.
The weather having been so poor we considered our flock must have
been well and truly acclimatized to have withstood it. Had the
summer been the type our fathers are said to have enjoyed we would
have hesitated even to consider leaving them out, but having been so
bad we thought that by contrast the winter couldn't be so very much

worse ! This, coupled with the remembrance of the catching-up disaster
of the previous autumn, persuaded us to take a chance and leave them
out, only catching them up if it appeared that the weather really was
going to prove too much for them. We did, however, catch up two
females that were poor fliers and left out 26. In the past we have i
always been concerned when the temperature in the bird-room has
dropped below 40* F. But, and we consider this quite remarkable, all
26 came through the very variable and treacherous winter, with the
temperature on occasions as low as 21 0 F. Even on the very coldest
days, and with thick snow on the ground, they were all in the rudest
health and full of the joy of living. At night some occupied the nesting
barrels, but the majority hung suspended head down under the
sheltered parts of the roof.
In the early spring, 1955, the old barrels were replaced by others
prepared during the winter. This time a smaller barrel was used,
approximately 14 inches deep and 12 inches across the mouth. The
number was increased to a dozen and they were hung facing north
and west.
When we broke up the old nests we found that in general the burrows
extended on a slight incline to a depth of perhaps six or seven inches
and then opened up on one side into a nesting chamber about the
size of a largish orange. In no case did the burrows turn vertically
and then double back so that the nesting chamber was more or less
above the entrance hole--as has been stated on occasions. No nesting
material of any kind had been carried into any nest.
The task of excavating falls mainly to the females. The males show
great enthusiasm but are more of a hindrance than any real help.
They burrow into the peat with the greatest of ease and since we
have used the barrels we are not aware that any has got into diffi-
culties on account of an excavation caving in. When we used the bales
of peat we did have one fatality--a female that somehow became
wedged about nine inches along an open tunnel.
Early in 1955 a young male managed to crack its skull, and during
a warm spell the two poor flying females were restored to the aviary,
so that we started the season with a complement of 27.
The summer proved to be the best and certainly the warmest for
many years, and as week followed week of almost unbroken sunshine
our hopes rose. We felt there was a really good chance of success.
That they had wintered out proved they must be in first rate condition ;
this coupled with the glorious weather led us to believe that they
would now breed, if ever. About ten pairs burrowed, several appeared
to be serious in their intent. There was much mating, over twenty
eggs it later transpired, but no young. There is some variation in the
size of the eggs, 20-21 X 16-17 mm. ; 20 X 16 mm. being a fair
average.

On the 3rd December a "stranger" appeared in the aviary,
hanging on the netting, apparently unable to fend for itself. We
brought it into the house where it remained caged until the spring,
when it was returned to the enclosure. Several authorities examined
it and pronounced it to be a young one. We would like to think it was
a home-bred bird, but we haven't the faintest clue to its origin, so we
have recourse to the Scottish verdict " Not proven ". It has developed
into quite a nice little female but still retains a somewhat juvenile
appearance.
It is very remarkable, but in recent years both summers and winters
invariably establish or break records of one kind or another. A record-
breaking summer was naturally followed by a record-breaking winter :
days and nights of pitiless frost with the temperature on one occasion
down to 15 0 F. The flock was again left out and successfully withstood
this, the worst winter of the century. The losses were negligible : one
female was found dead egg-bound on 25th November, and one in
late December for no ascertainable cause.
We now come to the year 1956. We suffered an invasion of mice
during the previous year : only comparatively few got into the
lovebird enclosure and, as far as we know, none managed to climb
up to the barrels. We eventually entirely cleared the aviaries of these
pests and took all reasonable precautions to prevent a repetition of
the nuisance. In the spring sheets of galvanized iron were sunk in
the ground, leaving 18 inches above ground. The staging was
reconstructed and we are now confident it is virtually impossible for
any mouse to gain entrance to a barrel. The new lay-out enabled the
number of barrels to be increased to sixteen, eight facing north and
eight west.
It could hardly be expected that we should enjoy two successive
good summers. And so it came as no great surprise that the summer
of 1956 proved to be one of the worst for quite a few years : sunless,
cheerless, wet, with cold nights. There cannot have been more than
nine or ten real summer days during the whole period.
Matters went very much as in previous years, matings, excavatings,
and more matings. The weather was really so poor that no breeding
results could reasonably be expected.
It is said that one of the main attractions of Aviculture is its very
uncertainty. True or false it is definitely very uncertain ! During the
many years in which we have engaged in the " Amiable Art " we
have experienced many trials and tribulations, mixed, be it said,
with just a few joys and triumphs. We now enjoyed one of the rare
triumphs, really quite an unexpected one.
5th October, 1956. On this day a single young one emerged from a
barrel. It was well-grown and a good flier but very soft in condition
and altogether miserable looking. The female parent which had not

been seen for some weeks was in very poor condition and miserable
looking, too. Both of them did little except sit close against each other
with their beaks tucked into their shoulders. The male was invariably
in attendance, sitting on the other side and giving general support to
the young one. At frequent intervals the young one bestirred itself
and begged for food, with drooping wings slightly open and quivering,
at the same time " bleating " incessantly--a like performance never
witnessed by us with any other Agapornis species. Fortunately the
male was always willing to oblige, for the female most certainly
didn't appear as though she were capable of feeding herself, let alone
assisting with even a single young one. The temperature that night
dropped to near frost and we were far from hopeful of the survival of
either, especially as they did not retire to the barrel but roosted on the
top of it. However, survive they did. The next four or five days they
spent huddled together, two very dejected looking little creatures,
but as they were able to fly and day followed day we became less
pessimistic, more so as the nights had become markedly less cold.
Then after about a week there was a decided improvement in their
appearance. The male no longer remained in such close attendance,
but was always within easy reach and ever on the alert to drive off
any other bird that ventured too near his family. For the next month
it was quite usual to see all three sleeping close together. They were
not actually seen to re-enter the barrel but they may have done so as
one of their favourite perches was, and still is, on the peat retaining
board fastened to the front.
On leaving the nest the young one was, as already stated, in a very
soft condition. In colouring it is a washed-out replica of a female :
the green is dull, entirely lacking the beautiful, vivid sheen of an adult ;
the yellow-orange of the forehead, face, and throat is paler and less
extensive ; beak a pale brownish-orange ; rump bright blue but paler ;
under wing-coverts green, sparsely feathered ; tail as in an adult but
shorter and the colouring paler. The general impression is that when
it moults it will prove to be a female ; this is heightened by the fact
that there are no black feathers in the under wing-coverts.
Food. Our Red-faced colony lives almost entirely on soaked millet
sprays and soft, sweet apples. White millet, pannicum, and canary
seed are always available, but they are rarely, if ever, touched. It
should be mentioned, in passing, that to our great cost we have found
it most inadvisable to give soaked millet sprays to newly imported
birds. They gorge themselves and seem quite unable to assimilate it.
The sprays, apples, and cuttle-bone are hung on the netting and the
other seeds, water, and grit are supplied on a table. There is therefore
no necessity for them to descend to the ground and it is indeed quite
exceptional to see any do so. But very occasionally about half a dozen
may be surprised fossicking about, usually amongst the peat-moss that

has fallen during the course of excavation. We are quite unable
to account for the fact that these little parties always appear to be
composed of males only. The ground of the aviary is overgrown with
weeds of all kinds and there is also much sprouting seed, but none
ever seems of interest : certainly we have never seen a lovebird so
much as nibbling chickweed or anything else, so we do not think
green food in any form was used in the rearing of our young one.
A few details still need to be filled in. Only one young one left the
nest but it is extremely unlikely that the clutch consisted of only one
egg. We can only assume that, in conformity with several other
nests, the number was between four and six. We may perhaps
know more of this when the barrel is replenished with peat-moss. It is
the same with the incubation period, we surmise it to have been
20-21 days, but of this we have no confirmation.
During all this time there were Diamond Doves and Chinese
Painted Quail in the enclosure, but their breeding operations, and the
Quail were remarkably successful, in no way interfered with the
lovebirds and the lovebirds in turn appeared to be quite unaware of
their presence.
Any member specially interested in this species is very welcome to
come, preferably by appointment, and see our " breeding 55 colony.
And, please, no post cards enquiring whether we are certain our
Lovebirds are Red-faced and not Peach-faced. We really do know
the difference !
The sequel is very unfortunate. The night of 6th November had a
slight ground frost accompanied by light fog. The combination was
apparently just too much for the young one and in the morning it was
breathing heavily. We caught it up as a precautionary measure. Its
condition did not at first give rise to any great anxiety, but it deterio-
rated very rapidly and within a few hours it was dead. It died on
the thirty-fourth day after leaving the nest and was quite independent
of its parents.
The post-mortem examination carried out at the Zoo showed that
the cause of death was pneumonia, and confirmed that, as expected,
the young one was a female.
As described above, A. A. Prestwich has bred the Red-faced Love-
bird (Agapornis pull aria ). It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

By P. M. A. Harwood, M.R.C.V.S. (Darlington, Western Australia)
The Pileated Parrakeet, known in Australia as the Red-capped or
West Australian King Parrot, is a most interesting bird. A member
of the Bassian fauna of south-west Australia, the bird has no close
generic relatives. Generally speaking the Bassian fauna of the south-
west is represented by an identical or similar and related fauna in
the Bassian region of Eastern Australia, an indication of a previous
connection across the existing barren Eyrean region which now acts
as an effective barrier against eastwards and westwards migrations
(see Map i).
Map i. --Hatched areas show the Bassian Areas of S.W. and S.E. Australia.
The Pileated Parrakeet is a bird with a limited range in the south-
western corner of Western Australia. It is limited in distribution to
the Jarrah and Karri forest areas, the south-west coastal plain, and
has made some limited extensions into the white gum forests and
mallee areas and along the south coast (see Map 2.)

Genealogically, the bird is supposed by Serventy and Whittell (i)
to be a surviving prototype of the Broadtail Parrakeets (Platycercines),
which are represented in Western Australia by the Yellow-naped or
Twenty-eight Parrakeet ( Barnardius semitorquatus) , the Port Lincoln or
Bauer's Parrakeet (B. zonarius), and the Stanley Rosella ( Platycercus

P. M. A. HARWOOD-THE PILEATED PARRAKEET
The author feels that this is not the true relationship. It is true
that the bird shows several of the general characteristics of the
Platycercine Parrakeets, but these characteristics are also seen in the
small Broadtails (genus Psephotus and related genera which include
Red-rumped, Many-coloured, and Blue-bonnet Parrakeets).
More weight can, I feel, be given to the argument that the Pileated
is a bird which has followed a lone evolutionary development. That
this development has occurred from Broadtail stock is suggested on
morphological grounds, on the characteristic exhibition of a row of white
dots on the under surface of the flight feathers in immature plumage,
and on the striking resemblance of the calls of young Pileateds
to the very similar normal calls of the Platycercines generally.
As evidence against the bird being a progenitor of Broadtail stock,
two characteristics of the group as a whole are quite different in the
Pileated. The sexual display is quite unlike that of any other Broad-
tail and the calls of the mature birds are also strikingly dissimilar.
The beak shows a remarkable evolutionary development. The
peculiar elongation of the upper mandible is seen in only three other
Australia psittacines--the Slender-billed Corella, the race tenuirostris
of Baudin's Black Cockatoo (both these forms occur in south-west
Australia), and the rare Blue-cheeked Parrakeet of North Queensland
(Hallstrom (3)).
That the bird itself is in a process of evolutionary change is suggested
by the fact that, whereas some females exhibit a similar, though duller,
plumage to adult males, others never progress beyond the dull
juvenile plumage of the immature. This phenomenon may even be
seen in females from the same nest.
This description of the bird, given by the Duke of Bedford (3), is
so comprehensive that I can add little to it.
" Adult male. Cap dark crimson ; cheeks bright greenish-yellow ;
mantle and wings green ; under wing-coverts, outer edge of wing,
and portion of flight feathers blue. Rump yellow with a greenish
tinge. Central tail feathers green, darkening towards the tip. Outer tail
feathers blue and white. Breast purple. Vent and under tail-coverts
red. Bill bluish horn and peculiarly long and narrow. Total length
14^ inches. Size about that of a pigeon.
" Adult female. Very variable. Some hens, except for a few green
feathers on the cap and a duller shade on the cheeks, have the same
plumage as the male. Others, even sisters in the same nest as the
bright form, never acquire a plumage very different from the immature,
save that they are a little more purple on the breast.
" Immature. Head and upper parts a dull, dark green, slightly paler
on the cheeks ; bastard-wing, primary coverts, and outer edge of flight
feathers blue ; rump greenish-yellow. Middle tail feathers bronze-
green. A narrow bar of red across the forehead. Throat and foreneck

dusky grey with a slight reddish tinge on the breast. Abdomen
pale, purplish-blue. Lower flanks and thighs apple green, the feathers
margined with red. Under tail-coverts similar but paler and inclining
to yellow. Adult plumage is acquired with the first complete moult
when the bird is a little less than a year old."
Females can always be picked from males in full colour as in the
former the cap is always more maroon than crimson.
The species is subject to a certain amount of erythrism and some
birds show a red edging to the yellow feathers of the rump. There is
also a considerable variation in the amount of blue in the wings and
in the depth of purple in the breast of males. It is a remarkable
thing that such garish colours combine into a very effective camouflage.
Birds seen at a distance appear a uniform, inconspicuous greyish-green
and it is not easy to differentiate between immature and coloured
birds in the field.
The one conspicuous feature of the Pileated in flight is the yellow
rump and this feature is the one by which the bird can be quickly
differentiated in the bush. The flight of the Pileated is quite
characteristic and is composed of a series of undulatory glides inter-
spersed by ten to twelve rapid wing beats. It is a swift and agile bird.
The range of the Pileated has already been described. Within this
range, the bird has adapted itself well to changes in environment
caused by the advance of agriculture and, in spite of persecution by
man, is in no immediate danger of extinction.
In some areas the birds are " declared " as vermin on account of
the damage they inflict to orchards, and nowhere are they protected
by law. Even in King's Park, in the heart of Perth, it is not unusual
to see a few Pileated Parrakeets, and there can be few suburban
gardeners who have not had their almond trees raided at some time.
However, on account of the very effective camouflage, few people
recognize the birds and most of these depredations are blamed on
the " Twenty-eights ".
The Pileated is a tree lover and keeps to the forests and belts of
trees. The " parkland " type of clearing with the retention of trees
for shade and shelter have suited the birds, while they have been
quick to turn to their advantage the introduction of many new and
edible flora species.
The natural foods comprise the seeds of various eucalypts, chiefly
red gum, white gum, and jarrah ; the seeds of sheokes (Gasuarina
spp.), banksias, native pears, and various other native trees and shrubs
and grass seeds. Like most parrakeets, the nectar of flowering
eucalypts is also relished.
Introduced foods for which the birds show a liking are oats and
wheat, apples, pears and stone fruits, almonds, pine cones, and the
seeds of many of the introduced pasture plants.

P. M. A. HARWOOD-THE PILEATED PARRAKEET
The breeding season is approximately between October and
December, but birds on the coastal plain usually nest about a month
in advance of those on the Darling Range escarpment. The nest site is
a hollow in a tree seldom less than 40 feet from the ground. Red
gums, jarrahs, and white gums are selected as nest trees and the birds
show a preference for hollows which face east to north.
Green trees are almost invariably selected, but the type of nest
site shows considerable variation. There is usually a preference for
sites with a small entry hole and this often shows signs of chewing.
Some nests are at the level of the entry hole, others descend a
considerable amount. One nest was found where the eggs were laid
15 feet below the entry hole.
From five to seven eggs form the normal clutch and incubation
takes approximately twenty-four days. The female alone incubates,
being fed by the male. He usually flies to a near-by tree and calls
the female off the nest to be fed. She returns immediately to the
nest. Feeding times are usually 8 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. For about two
weeks before the young birds are ready to fly they can be heard
calling for food at these times. The call is a prolonged double whistle,
the second note being about three tones higher pitched than the first.
All the young birds normally leave the nest on the same day and
are fed by their parents for about another fortnight. During this
period they utter the double-whistle call almost incessantly and will
fly to any adult, even a stranger, demanding to be fed. Nesting
territories are rigidly guarded and both members of a pair act in
unison to repel an invader. Mated pairs fly together, but young
birds congregate into loosely integrated flocks when independent of
their parents. These flocks lack the close integration and discipline
of the flocks formed by young Rock Pebblers.
Towards the end of winter, birds congregate into large flocks of all
ages and both sexes, often around farms and other places where there is
a ready food supply. These flocks suddenly disperse with the advent
of spring when the birds again fly in individual pairs and start to
dispute over nesting sites.
Depending on seasonal conditions, these large winter flocks may
last for months or only a few weeks.
There are three basic call notes of the Pileated Parrakeet. The
first and most often heard call is a harsh grating cry frequently
reiterated and of short duration and usually uttered in flight. The
alarm call is a variation of this. The second call could be likened
to " Kililililik This call is usually uttered when the bird is
perching.
There is also the double-whistle call of the young bird, also
uttered by females wishing to be fed by their mates.
In addition, males when displaying often make a clicking noise,

apparently with the beak, and when a number of newly-trapped birds
are confined in an aviary they dispute roosting sites with a peculiar

Males exhibit a display quite unlike that of the Platycercine
Parrakeets. The feathers on the cap are erected and the tail is shaken
vertically, never horizontally. Hens out of the breeding season are
far more dominating than is usual with Broadtails. Both members
of the pair prospect for nesting-sites with much excitement, calling,
and tail-shaking, but under normal conditions the male never actually
enters the nest.
Males are assiduous in feeding females during courtship, with the
normal head-bobbing movements and regurgitation. Copulation takes
place on a fairly wide branch or limb with the female remaining
crouched through the pre-copulatory ceremony. Females will solicit
copulation by adopting this crouched posture and slightly vibrating
the wings.

Methods of Trapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.950049230769231" page_id="56318040"  page_num="13" year="" vol="">
The Pileated is a very intelligent and active bird and is far harder
to trap than most parrakeets. Basically there are three periods when
trapping is possible :--
(1) When young birds are not fully independent of their parents
they are much attracted by the calls of any mature birds.
(2) When the nesting-site selection is taking place, any strange
Pileated will be attacked by a pair which have selected their nesting
territory.
(3) During the period when winter flocks are formed food supplies
are usually short and the birds can be trapped on grain.
Like many parrakeets, Pileateds show a reluctance to leave an
injured companion ; in fact, the cries of an injured bird will attract
others.

14 D. M. WEST-NESTING OF PILEATED PARRAKEET IN CALIFORNIA
The Pileated Parrakeet as an Aviary Bird
By virtue of its brilliant and unusual coloration and active
disposition, the Pileated makes an attractive aviary bird. On the
negative side of the balance it must be stated that it is very wild
and seldom becomes even reasonably steady. Hand-reared birds are
very friendly and docile and make fairly talented talkers. Its wildness
is compensated somewhat by its agility and the birds rarely injure
themselves in aviaries once they have come to accept wire-netting as
an impassable barrier. For this reason, it is essential to cage newly-
trapped birds in small, roofed cages until they get used to netting,
otherwise head injuries are common and severe. It needs a fairly
large aviary to be seen to advantage.
The basic food is three parts sunflower, two parts oats, and one
part canary seed. Most pairs will consume a whole apple daily and
require a good deal of greenstuff.
The species nests quite readily in an aviary, being single-brooded.
When young are being reared an abundance of fruit, soft grass, green
peas, lettuce, soaked bread, and boiled maize are essential. Like most
Australian parrakeets, it is quite impossible to expect good results
where the young are to be reared on hard seed. Interference and
inspection of the nest is resented and hens even desert young if
interfered with. Males are quite tolerant of the presence of their
young, but breeding pairs can be very aggressive towards other birds.
Several hybrids have been produced. On record are hybrids with
the Mealy, Common, and Stanley Rosellas.

These striking birds, with their very unusual coloration, are not
favourites with some aviculturists. Their nervous disposition, and
long curved beak, accompanied by a rather bizarre colour scheme
have made them loved by some, disliked by some, and ignored by
many.

D. M. WEST-NESTING OF PILEATED PARRAKEET IN CALIFORNIA I 5
The pair which nested for me in 1955 and again in 1956 were
bred in 1952. The male was in complete colour in 1954, but at that
time the female did not have her red cap, though otherwise com-
pletely coloured. It would appear from this that the male colours
completely in two years, but that the female requires three years to
assume complete adult plumage. I have not seen a previous
reference to this fact, and possibly my experience is only an isolated
case.
Because of their rather nervous disposition this pair were kept in
a 26 ft. long aviary, which was about 3 feet wide and 8 feet high.
The feeding and watering was done at the front and this allowed
them to fly into the shelter while these operations were being carried
out. This arrangement was a good one since the pair were able to
observe the feeding process from a safe distance and learned that
there was nothing to fear, and this has helped to tame them down.
The hand-reared Pileated I have seen and owned were just
as tame and confiding as a Princess Alexandra--but not so their nest-
reared brothers and sisters !
In this flight there was also a pair of Turquoisines. From past
experience Pileated have been found to be very tractable and Bourke's
and other equally inoffensive species are quite happy when housed in
large aviaries with Pileated. Despite their rather formidable-appearing
beaks they are not aggressive with smaller birds and are not destructive
to any but the very softest woods--at least, in my experience.
This particular pair have been in this aviary since 1953. At first
the pair were nervous and flighty, and it took them a full year
to settle down. Gradually the pair became more quiet and acted
quite sensibly whenever I had to clean their aviary, etc.
During the 1954 season the pair became very active and indulged
in a great deal of extra flying and calling. The male appeared more
anxious to nest than the hen, but eventually nothing happened and
the pair fell into an early moult.
In 1955 the male began calling and displaying to the hen in March.
By the end of March both birds were flying about a great deal and
the male was occasionally seen to feed the hen. In April the male
began feeding the hen frequently and the pair were observed mating
on two different occasions in the morning.
It was at this point that events took a rather unexpected turn.
Instead of taking one of the two large boxes especially hung for them
at the rear of the aviary the hen chose the nest-box intended for the
pair of Turquoisines. This was not a large box, being about 12 inches
high, 8 inches deep, and 6 inches wide. To top it all off the hen did
not enter through the entrance hole but instead she entered through
the roof of the box ! This was accomplished quite easily since the
top of this box was split, and by doing a little pushing and nudging

she was able to separate the boards enough to enter. It had never
entered my head that the Pileated would choose this box--which was
hung in the front part of the aviary which the Pileated had always
avoided like the plague ! It might be added that the Turquoisines
were so put out by all this unseemly house hunting that they nested
in one of the large boxes provided for the Pileated.
The hen Pileated did all the house hunting herself, and the cock
never appeared interested in any of the boxes provided. At this time
it was considered unwise to take this small box down--because this
might put the pair off and they would not nest at all--so with my
fingers crossed they were allowed to proceed with their plans.
It was fully expected that the hen would sit like a feather, but she
very agreeably surprised me by sitting very tightly and never coming
off the nest except when absolutely necessary.
After incubation actually started the cock stopped calling and
became very quiet. This seems to be a rather general happening
and I have observed similar behaviour with other species. Doubtless
it is a safeguard to avoid calling attention to the sitting hen.
Babies were heard on the twenty-fourth day after incubation started.
The cock did not enter the nest-box, but he did feed the hen whenever
she would come off the nest. Sometimes he would fly to the top of
the nest and look in, and call to the hen, but the cock was never
observed actually to enter the box. Because of the small size of the
box, and the method of entrance, it was very nearly a physical
impossibility.
The diet while feeding the young was as follows : a dish of mixed
grains (millet, oats, canary, hemp) and a dish of sunflower was
provided, along with two large dessert apples each day, one orange,
and a fresh ear of corn, and all the poa annua and pyracantha berries
available.
For the first few days the young could be heard being fed, and
then from the fifth day on it became apparent that all was not well.
The hen would be off the nest a great deal, and neither bird appeared
interested in the soaked bread, etc., that most parents with a family
to feed appear anxious for. An inspection of the nest on the fifth day
revealed that there had been four eggs laid and that three of the eggs
had hatched, but that the young had been trampled to death--
doubtless by the fact that the hen had literally to jump down into
the nest from her mode of entrance.
The nest was taken down, and then completely scrubbed with a
strong wire brush, dipped into a disinfectant, and hung up again
after a few days. However, the parents did not appear interested in
the nest and there were no further attempts at nesting.
If this story has a moral it is doubtless centred around the absolute
necessity of having a decent-sized nest-box for birds of this size.

THE BREEDING OF THE CUBAN AMAZON
PARROT (.Amazona leucocephala)
By Edward Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)

<bodyText confidence="0.999411967741936" page_id="56318044"  page_num="17" year="" vol="">
We have two pairs of Cuban Amazon Parrots at the Keston Foreign
Bird Farm, one of which successfully reared two young ones during
the 1956 breeding season--so far as we know the first time the species
has ever been bred in captivity.
As they are among the more rarely imported Amazons, I give the
following very brief description for the benefit of those who may not
be familiar with their appearance. Bright darkish green with black
edges to the feathers, these being widest and most pronounced on the
neck and forepart of the body. Face white with a beautiful patch of
deep coral pink on the throat. A considerable amount of vinous
colour on the belly and of rich blue in the wings. Bill, whitish. It is
when the wings are partially opened and the shoulders thrust forward
in display that one can fully appreciate the great beauty of these
Amazons. They are perhaps a trifle smaller and slimmer than the
well-known Blue-front.
We have had the four adults for about four years, and they were
obviously young birds when they arrived, at which time they were
desperately wild, but they have gradually calmed down and are now
quite steady with people they know.
Pair number one were given a hang-up nest-box with natural bark
on the front round the entrance hole and soon started spending quite
long periods inside it. Then they seemed to lose interest, partly,
I think, because their aviary was not in a sufficiently secluded position.
Pair number two, however, were given a grandfather clock type
nest-box, also with natural bark on the front, and soon took to it,
the hen starting to sit about the middle of May.
By the end oi June the parents were eating much more than usual
and on one or two occasions I thought I heard young ones being fed
in the nest, so I was glad that I had already augmented their diet
with a daily allowance of such extras as a cube of stale bread previously
soaked in sweetened milk, as well as boiled potatoes and carrots and

plenty of seakale beet and apples. I also supplied flakes of boiled
white fish, of which our Blue-fronted Amazons were so fond when
rearing young, but it did not seem to appeal to the Cubans, so I
discontinued it.
A couple of weeks or so later I found myself in the dilemma which
must be familiar to those aviculturists who think as I do, that nesting
birds are much best left well alone. Although the Cubans were still
eating abnormally large quantities of food, there was a distinct
charnel house smell in the vicinity of their aviary and I had horrible
visions of one of the young ones dead in the nest and the survival of
the others possibly hinging upon the removal of its decaying corpse !
Incidentally, the origin of this stench was never discovered, but
I think it must have been something that had died in a rather dense
thicket close to the aviary. Nevertheless, at the time I felt sure it
must emanate from the Cubans 5 nest-box, so X decided to shut the
parents in the shelter and look in. A hurried glance in the rather
dimly-lit depths of the grandfather clock box disclosed two very
healthy-looking about half-grown young ones and I thought I caught
a glimpse of a third, but this proved later to be incorrect.
The two youngsters continued to flourish and when they were
within a week of fledging could be heard climbing about on the wire
ladder inside the box, and they periodically came up to the entrance
hole and looked out.
The first one to emerge came out on the last Sunday in August
and proved to be a most perfect specimen with not a feather out of
place and hardly distinguishable from its parents, except for the almost
complete lack of vinous colouring on the lower breast and abdomen
and the fact that, in the green areas of the plumage, the feathers
were much less heavily bordered with black than in the adults.
Then the most extraordinary and I should have said quite unheard-
of thing occurred : I thought I knew most of the strange and
unpredictable things that birds will do, but the parent Cubans
proceeded to spring a completely new one on me.
They seemed to be terribly excited at the emergence of their first-
born and kept on flying about the aviary, then settling one each side
of it and frantically preening its feathers, so I decided they needed
complete quiet and left them. That was in the morning and I did
not go near them until late afternoon of the same day, only to find
that they had denuded the young one of every single head feather,
giving it a vulturine appearance, but had mercifully left all the rest
of its plumage intact and untouched.
The second one came out the following day, just as perfect a
specimen as the first, and although the parents treated its appearance
rather more calmly they were unable to resist the temptation to pluck
its head--though only slightly this time--and the degrees of plucking

The two young Cuban Amazons, photographed a few days after fledging, are seen
between their parents. Both left the nest in perfect feather, but within a few hours had
had their heads plucked by their parents---the first to fledge (right-centre) coming off
worst, while the second (left-centre) had only a few feathers removed. Now (about five
weeks after being taken away from their parents) they have re-grown all their head
feathers and are again as perfect as when they first left the nest.

are clearly shown in the photograph which was taken about a week
after the young ones left the nest.
It is, alas, all too common among parrot-like birds to pluck their
young ones while still in the nest, and leave off once they are out
of it, but the Cubans 5 reversal of this process was totally unexpected
and particularly infuriating---seeing how perfect the young ones were
just a matter of a few hours before.
However, as I have said, the plucking fortunately did not include
any of the body feathers, and now that the young ones have been
away from their parents for just on five weeks they have re-grown all
their head feathers and are once more as perfect as they were when
they first left the nest, with the pink areas remarkably vivid for such
young birds.
They are extremely healthy and lively, and are just starting to

that the rearing in my Los Angeles aviaries of many rare doves
is nothing much to boast about. If I have not been more successful,
it is because I am not free from a terrible disease of most aviculturists:
I keep too many birds and they interfere with one another during the
mating season, which lasts the greater part of the year in a good
climate. To be really successful with doves, each pair of large size
should be kept alone in their own aviary, where also one pair of small
ones can be placed, as well as finches and little quails. I follow this
rule for the rarest species, but I have to associate many pairs in larger
flights. There are some good results, but also losses of eggs and young,
and some pairs do not find enough privacy to breed. The following

species of ground pigeons were reared : Bartlett (4), Bleeding-heart
(7)5 Mountain Witch (1), Chiriqui (4), Martinique (4), as well as
some Brush Bronze-wing, Green-winged, Blue Ground, Cape, and
silver Diamond Doves, and lots of Peruvians and Pigmies.
Twenty Gouldians and five Parson Finches were also reared, but
most other finches were little successful, due to overcrowding. Among
my new birds in Los Angeles are Fairy Bluebirds, Hooded Pittas, and
an Emerald Starling.
The breeding season at Cleres was handicapped by Mr. Fooks'
illness during the spring. However, Pheasants of the following species
were raised : Mikado, Elliot, Cheer, Horsfield, Swinhoe, Siamese
Fireback, Red and Sonnerat's Junglefowl, Green and Black-winged
Peafowl. Blue, Crowned and Stanley Cranes hatched, but were not
reared. Many waterfowl bred, the most interesting young being 5
Andean Geese, 10 Philippine and 5 Hawaiian Mallards. The latter
come from a pair which I had kept three years in Los Angeles without
good results. There were young of several species of doves, particularly
Brush Bronze-wings, and various parrakeets.
I spent the months of March, April, and June in South America,
first with an expedition of my Los Angeles County Museum to Brazil,
later on visiting Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, in
the company of Mr. and Mrs. Dillon Ripley, in the interests of the
International Committee for Bird Preservation. In the course of
this very interesting journey I had an opportunity to visit some
collections of live birds. The new Zoo in Rio de Janeiro has very
good aviaries of parrots and other large birds, both Brazilian and
exotic, and a number of small birds kept very successfully, in ones or
twos in separate cages. The large Buenos Aires Zoo, which had gone
down during the Peron regime, is now being renovated. The small
Zoo at Santiago contains many interesting Chilean species.
I saw some good private collections in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro,
where Dr. E. Beraut keeps in a planted verandah a beautiful collection
of Humming Birds, which he and his collectors obtain throughout
Brazil. But the visit that I made with him to his friend Mr. F. Ruschi,
at Santa Teresa, Espirito Santo (the state just north of Rio) will
remain in my memory as one of the greatest thrills that I ever had.
Mr. Ruschi is a dedicated Brazilian nature-lover. He has single-
handed organized remarkable wild life preserves in his native state,
which possesses one of the most magnificent fauna and flora on earth,
unfortunately terribly ravaged by man during the last two hundred
years. Mr. Ruschi knows birds as well as plants ; his property con-
tains museums, gardens, and aviaries of the greatest interest. In
particular he has built an enormous flight, 300 X 100 feet and
30 feet high, where hundreds of Humming Birds live and breed freely,
including the lovely little Coquette. I saw fifteen on a bush, all reared

by one original pair. There are about twenty local species in this
aviary, and one can also see several hundreds of wild Hummers in the
garden. Dozens of them are always buzzing as they drink sugar-water
from bottles hung around the verandah of the house, a delightful
sight. Furthermore, a beautiful large (ioo ft. long) house has been
built, with a passage for visitors along its front, to accommodate the
equatorial species from Amazonia which will not stand the cool
nights of Santa Teresa (altitude 3,000 feet).
Both Mr. Ruschi and Dr. Beraut now entirely feed their Hummers
on sugar- or honey-water and on quantities of fruit flies. Even the
difficult, mostly insectivorous, species of Phaetorui and Pygmornis do
perfectly well on such a diet.

Mr. Walther Langberg has given us an interesting account of the
breeding of the Painted Quail in Copenhagen but, as he does not give
the scientific name of the bird, he might be referring to Turnix varia ,
one of the Hemipodes, which in Australia is known as the " Painted
Quail ". However, from his description, Mr. Langberg's bird is
obviously Excalfactoria chinensis, a bird which I was one of the first to
breed in England some fifty years ago. Since those early days this
very attractive species seems to have been rarely imported until quite
recently, and now that it is with us again no doubt aviculturists will
be wanting to breed it, and my experience may be of some help.
Mr. Langberg writes : " Many hens are inclined to lay their eggs
all over the place, or to scatter them around after laying, before they
eventually decide to lay in the nest ; some hens, indeed, never seem
to settle down to serious nesting operations and continue to lay their
eggs broadcast." This is, I believe, the experience of many who have
kept these birds in the ordinary type of aviary with a sanded floor,
and perhaps very little grass in the flight.
My aviaries were constructed with fairly large outside flights, some
12 or 15 feet each way, the height being immaterial so far as quails
are concerned, and the grass was allowed to grow long. As soon as
the quails were allowed into the paddock in the spring they commenced
to form tunnels through the grass, and at the end of one such tunnel
the hen would make her nest, perfectly hidden from all prying eyes.
One could only guess where the nest was situated by watching the
hen appear and disappear into a tunnel and notice the movement of
the grass as she proceeded along it. It is advisable not to be too
inquisitive and not on any account to disturb the grass to examine

the nest, but patiently to wait until, on about the seventeenth or
eighteenth day after you first noticed her disappearance, she is seen
to appear with her brood of the smallest and loveliest chicks you can
imagine. You will have noticed her appearance from time to time
at the feeding place during incubation to satisfy you that all is
going well.
I made a small portable run, about 5 feet by 3 feet, of 9 in. boards
at the sides and wire netting top, into which I gently drove the hen
and her brood so that they could have special care and attention for
the first week or so of their lives. A piece of waterproof material was
placed over part of this for shelter and part of the top made to open
for feeding. When quite young there is no food so good as ants 5 eggs,
fresh and newly dug up. I used to take a large tin and a trowel and
collect a supply that would last for days and I gave a good supply
each day though, as Mr. Langberg says, the chicks very soon begin
to take small seeds as well as insectivorous soft food.
In any type of aviary, even in a cage, these little quails will lay
plenty of eggs--in fact far too many--but, in my experience, without
the chance of hiding her nest in the grass the hen is unlikely to sit ;
but given the conditions I have described, success is pretty certain,
barring such accidents as floods ! And my experience of these birds
was not confined to just one pair ; I have had several and all behaved
in the same way, including examples of the Australian race, E. lineata ,
a slightly smaller and darker race than the type. In Australia this is
known as the " King Quail ". Although newly imported, these bred
just as freely as the others when given the right conditions, and the
chicks were at first almost black. Two broods of four or five were
reared each season.
One difficulty with the non-perching quails when kept in outdoor
aviaries is that, although they are generally perfectly tame, they are
liable at times suddenly to panic, especially at night, and to fly up
like rockets from the ground, hitting the top of the aviary and being
either scalped or killed outright. Owls or cats are probably to blame,
but whatever the cause efforts must be made to prevent it either by
cutting the flight-feathers of one wing or, perhaps better still, pinioning.
In the wild state these birds rarely fly, only doing so to escape from
predators or to travel from one district to another, so it is no hardship
whatever if they are prevented from flying altogether, and it in no
way detracts from their appearance.

We are fortunate at the New Grounds in having representatives of
all species of this most interesting group of the Anatidae which link
the characteristics of swans, geese, and ducks. As in the former two,
they have reticulated epithelium on the tarsi, are long-necked, and
the plumage of both sexes is similar. Arborea in particular has been
noted to graze but they mostly feed as do ducks, and bicolor and
arcuata dive a great deal. There are at the time of writing examples
of the following eight forms :--

Of these, five species have bred at Slimbridge. Five species are kept
full-winged and seem to enjoy liberty a great deal ; they fly often
and quite high. Unfortunately, although the main flock have stayed
with us, odd pairs have strayed away. They have a predilection for
perching on chimneys, roofs, and gateposts and we have erected
perching posts especially for them.
From their behaviour in captivity one would have thought that, in
their natural habitat, arborea and arcuata were inveterate tree nesters.
Our birds invariably use the barrels and boxes provided for Carolinas.
But apparently this is not the case (Delacour, The Waterfowl of the
World , Vol. I). We have found that autumnalis likes to nest in much
denser cover than other members of the group, preferably under thick
bramble and brushwood. Nevertheless, although so difficult for us to
locate, the eggs suffer greatly from the attention of vermin, aided no
doubt by the fact that the female leaves the eggs uncovered during
the whole period of laying. The clutches are relatively large (from
nine to sixteen) and fecundity is a strong point : a pair of autumnalis
laid seventy-two eggs in one season. The eggs are invariably white
and the shells are of roughish texture--so that we have found it
difficult to distinguish those of the bantams used as substitutes. Both
sexes incubate and the nest is never left unattended once incubation
has begun. Perhaps for this reason there is no lining of the nest with
down.

It is noteworthy that four of the five species seem to have slightly
shorter incubation periods than those given by Delacour (shown here
in parenthesis).
Fertility and hatchability of the specimens at the New Grounds
are high compared with other groups. An interesting point has been
observed at hatching time ; a relatively high percentage of eggs have
the shell pipped near the " equator ", an observation that has not
been noted in other genera.
The day-old young of any species of whistling duck are particularly
attractive. The characteristic feature of their downy pattern is the
light band circumventing the occiput and dividing off the lower edge
of the dark cap to form the cross stroke of a " T " of which the
down stroke carries down the back of the neck.
By far the most striking is that of autumnalis which is clad in a
wasp-like contrast of vivid yellow and black. Viduata and arhorea
have similar patterns, but of considerably less brilliance. Bicolor and
arcuata are purplish-grey shading to an almost black cap, the latter
being distinguishable by a light supraorbital stripe.
It has been our experience that all birds of the genus are extremely
apprehensive if touched and from day-old duckling to adult when
handled they give vent to a high-pitched scream. Nevertheless, they
are, when fully grown, very tame and have an insatiable curiosity in
all things human.
The ducklings are particularly unhappy in cold, wet weather and
appear to thrive only if the temperature is moderate. They have an
idiosyncrasy that causes them a deal of discomfort in that (even when
they are supplied with a minimum of drinking water) they will carry
their mash to the water, immerse their bills, and, sucking water up
at the nail, eject it through the sides together with some of the mash.
Thus they contrive to cover themselves with a sticky mess and we
have lost a number of ducklings as a result of this condition. If given
enough water in which to bath and swim they do attempt to wash
off the paste, but we have found that it is necessary to supply artificial
heat in the form of infra-red lamps. The aforementioned state has
occurred in three of the five species reared at the New Grounds,
although it is not the inevitable sequence of events and many broods
have been reared without any duckling achieving this appearance of
emaciated dejection.

S. B. KENDALL-NOTES ON THE CITRON-CRESTED COCKATOO 25
The fragility of the young does not make for successful rearing if
left at large with the parent birds. Similarly, if caught up and separated
from them the babies do not thrive. But if one can manage to catch
the adults up as well and put them in an aviary there is an excellent
chance of their survival, a fact we have demonstrated on several
occasions.
The Southern Red-billed Whistling Ducks are by far the most
fascinating of the group ; they have an abiding interest in all our
activities--if able they will always attend the uncrating of newly
arrived birds. Another form of entertainment indulged in, a rather
troublesome one, is the enjoyment they derive from trundling the eggs
out of other ducks' nests.

S. B. Kendall (Chertsey, Surrey, England)
Readers may remember my account of the breeding of the
Citron-crested Cockatoos, whose picture appears in this number.
In the September-October issue of 1955 I described the events up
to the time when the young fledged. Although I disposed of the young
I still have the adult pair and they had at least partial breeding success
again in 1956. Since September, 1955, there were, however, a series
of mishaps from which some avicultural morals can be drawn and an
account of which may be of interest to those of our members who are
trying to breed the larger parrot-like species.
The first mishap concerned the adult male of the breeding pair.
On the 23rd of September, 1955, I began to think (perhaps wrongly)
that the young male was getting into trouble with his parents, which
I accordingly removed to the adjacent (smaller) flight. As, however, it
appeared that the young were eating very little during that day, I
reunited the family by putting all together in the smaller flight. Here
they remained until 5th October. On that evening I came home at
dusk to find the whole party sitting outside in the unprotected flight in
torrential rain. I entered the flight to try to move them into the shelter ;
a lot of very large birds panicked in a rather small and over-perched
flight and next morning the old male had a hipped wing. He seemed
to have damaged the terminal joint when flying hard between the
perches and has never fully recovered, although he can fly short distances
and is able to mate without any difficulty. The moral here (which, of
course, I knew as well as anyone) is not to enter aviaries at dusk unless
the birds are very accustomed to the position of the perches.
The second mishap occurred after I had finally separated adults and
young. Owing to the fact that the young hen seemed extremely slow

in. becoming self-supporting, I left the parents in the adjoining aviary,
separated in one place by a single layer of 2 in. chain-link netting.
Feeding through the wires gradually ceased and the young were due
to be sent to their new owner on 24th November. I left them, on that
morning, in perfect condition and appearance and arranged to come
home at lunch-time to put them in the travelling-boxes. I arrived to
find the aviary (so it appeared to my appalled eye) a welter of blood
with the baby hen savagely bitten on the foot. Fortunately a good and
rapid recovery took place and, by the report of the killing of a young
Citron-crest by the parents at Whipsnade, it seems that I was lucky to
have such limited damage. The moral is, of course, that if an
apparently happy family group is broken up, great care must be taken
to ensure that the breeding pair and the young are properly separated.
The old birds will treat the young as they would any other potential
enemy of the same species. E. N. T. Vane, who saw the arrangements
shortly before the accident occurred, will remember warning the owner
as to what might happen.
The third mishap is sufficiently near still to influence the course
of events this season. During the early spring of 1956 the
cockies were making desperate attempts to start nesting and their
hole-digging in the aviary floor assumed major proportions. On
7th April they were switched into the breeding aviary. On 7th May
both were in the barrel at night and I imagine that an egg was laid
at that time. On the morning of 10th May, the female was in distress
in the shelter, unable to fly and showing all the signs of egg-binding.
(How providential it is that egg-bound hens come out of the nesting-
boxes.) She was at once brought into the house and a heroic tem-
perature raised in the smallest bedroom with the aid of all available
domestic heating appliances. Shortly before six at night she laid an
egg on the floor of the parrot cage where she was confined. The egg
appeared thifi-shelled, although otherwise perfect, and was put aside
for measuring while the owner celebrated in the usual way.
Unfortunately, by the next morning it had dehydrated and collapsed,
so that accurate measurement was impossible. The hen Citron-crest
made a very rapid recovery and was returned to her aviary on the
evening of the following day. I had qualms about doing this, but was
influenced by the fact that the cock had remained guarding the first-
laid egg for the thirty-six hours during which the hen had been absent
from the flight and by the belief that there were no more eggs to be laid.
The pair has incubated steadily ever since and at the time of writing
(10th June, 1956) should have hatched. I am hopeful of the outcome
but not optimistic. I am not sure that there is any moral in this story.
As far as I am aware nobody knows why birds become egg-bound ;
the condition certainly seems to involve the temporary paralysis of
more than the oviduct itself and there is some sort of connection with

We are glad to report that our Bewick's Swans have nested, hatched,
and reared young at the New Grounds. It is understood that the species
bred at Woburn before 1914, but we know of no other record and
unfortunately we have no details of the first record.
The male of the pair at the Wildfowl Trust appeared on our marsh
in November, 1948. It was a bird of the year, and, having lived with
the wild geese for some days, ventured into our rushy pen. Eventually
he was induced to come and feed with our tame birds and by degrees
enticed into a trap. For eighteen months he lived with our Whistling
Swans and then we managed to obtain a wild-caught female from
Holland. Owing to shortage of space and the belief that these birds
were unlikely breeders, they were placed in a rather unattractive pen
measuring some 15 yards by 20 yards in size with a very small area
of water by accepted standards.
The pair showed no signs of breeding or even mating before 1956
but on 2nd June it was noticed that there were the rudiments of
a nest constructed of the rush growing in the pen. The following
day both birds were observed building, though they still remained as
shy and retiring as ever. The female was seen sitting and shaping the
nest on successive days and then to our delight on 6th June we found
the first egg. Three eggs formed the clutch and the average weight
was 265 gm. and dimensions were 118 mm. by 82 mm. The male
was never observed to take part in incubation and indeed, compared
with other swans, did not offer very great defence of his consort when
the nest was approached.
The first cygnet hatched on the twenty-ninth day and the second
in thirty days. The third egg was infertile.
The cygnets are enchanting little things of white down with a steel-
blue overall appearance, their bills and feet a delicate pink. Much
to their parents' apprehension they became quite tame and would
approach quite close when their food was brought. Their diet consists
of Spratts' Maxco reinforced with an extra 8 per cent protein and

every kind of pond and water weed obtainable--duckweed, water-
cress, water celery, horned, curly and Canadian pondweeds, horn-
wort, and grass. In spite of all efforts one soon fell behind and
eventually died when six weeks old. The remaining cygnet continued
to thrive and showed signs of feathering when eight weeks old. By
sixteen weeks the bird was fully feathered, the plumage being a dirty
white, considerably lighter than that reported for Whistling and
Trumpeters. The bill remained pink with the exception of the tip.
The legs have lost their flesh colour and are now blotched with grey.

SOUTH-EAST ASIA NOTES
By S. Dillon Ripley (Litchfield, Conn., U.S.A.)
My wife and I spent five months primarily in Indonesia in the
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99439475862069" page_id="56318059"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
summer and autumn of 1954. It was a trip made more vivid for me
by the fact that I had spent fourteen months collecting birds in New
Guinea and Sumatra in 1938 and 1939. An account of some of my
experiences .looking for live birds during those trips appeared in
the Avicultural Magazine in 1938 and 1940. Naturally to a
returning visitor the main mental preoccupation is with the changes
which exist on every hand, these and the aura of speed which hangs
over the world to-day, rendering every impression more fleeting,
making it so much harder to savour things, to drink in the
surroundings.
When I reached New Guinea in the autumn of 1937, we had been
ten months out from New York on a small schooner. We were more
or less attuned to the pace of our surroundings. Now one can fly
KLM to Djakarta or Biak in under three days from New York.
It takes days in Java, weeks in New Guinea to get over a transition
like that.
Our first stop in South-East Asia was Bangkok, where we spent
three days, primarily to rest up after the long flight from Europe.
I was very much pleased, however, to meet a distinguished Thai
doctor and naturalist, Dr. Boonsong Lekagul, who among his manifold
other interests, is developing the first contemporary Siamese Zoo.
We unfortunately did not get to the Zoo while we were in Bangkok,
but I understand it has made a good start with Gaur, deer of several
species, tiger, and other mammals. Apparently birds are not much
in evidence as yet. But there is promise for the future in Dr. Boonsong's
energy. The bird market in Bangkok is most disappointing, a few
miserable huts along a canal near Wireless Road. Mostly the dealers
sell poultry and domestic pigeons, but there were a few doves, some
jungle fowl, and munias and weaver birds. Fortunately for them

wild birds are often bought in Buddhist countries to be released for
merit, a welcome deliverance to such poorly kept creatures. A tame
Adjutant Stork kept at liberty by one of the shopkeepers provided the
single exotic note in the assemblage.
Our next stop was Djakarta, now a vast city suffering the intense
pangs of post-war overcrowding. Large suburban cities, such as the
new Kemajoram, are being hastily put up in the outskirts in an effort
to keep pace with the growing pains. The pre-war Zoo still exists in
a small park in a residential part of the city. The park is brightly
illuminated and has cinema, games of chance, tea shops, etc., so that
the atmosphere is rather carnival-like. We avoided it on a friend's
advice, but did visit the bird market, which is in the general produce
market area. Perhaps because it was raining, our general impression
was a poor one. Sloshing about over heaps of manure and rotting
Vegetation, staring up into the dank recesses of tiny huts at nests of
dirty cages packed to bursting with huddled, frightened, soiled little
birds, was an unhappy experience.
The variety was considerable, as bulbuls of several species, babblers,
barbets, starlings, mynahs, munias, and weaverbirds were there.
We saw several Green Javan Jungle Fowl also, but they were all
cocks, evidently trapped by the use of a caged captive female. One
of our friends who lived in Djakarta had been buying a number of
bulbuls, dyal thrushes, and other common cage birds, but the mortality
rate was high, I am afraid due to the conditions of trapping and
keeping the birds in the market.
We spent one or two days driving about in Java, and managed to
see a few local birds. It always seems strange to see Java Sparrows
flying about at liberty, as they do in the palace enclosure in Djogja-
karta. They look as if they must have just that moment escaped from
a cage. We saw hawks of several species. Brahminy Kites, Haliastur ,
and the Serpent Eagle, Spilornis, were very common all along the
coasts, and in the hills I saw a small falcon. Minivets were common
in the lower hills, as were bulbuls, coucals, or crow pheasants, the
Golden Oriole, shrikes, tits, the White-bellied Swiftlet, and the
Pink-headed Flowerpecker. Nearer the towns mynahs and crows
and an occasional drongo were almost the only bird life visible.
The human population is so great on Java and so constantly increasing
that it seems hard to imagine that birds of any sort can withstand
the hordes of children armed with catapults much longer !
The Zoo in Surabaja was a delight, still as good as ever. It must
be by far the best Zoo in South-East Asia, if not in all Asia. It
certainly is better than the Calcutta Zoo, and certainly better than
anything in Japan, although I am not up to date on what the last
few years have produced in that country.
The Surabaja Zoo has the best kept small birds that I have seen

anywhere in the tropics in a public garden. Such difficult species as
woodpeckers, the Golden-backed, pittas, barbets (three species),
forktails, laughing thrushes, babblers, among these Turdinus and
Kenopia , rainforest species, and hanging lorikeets, all were apparently
thriving in roomy, beautifully planted aviaries, with adequate
sheltered quarters in the rear, and fresh, clean pans of food and
water, always a problem in a hot climate. The present success of this
Zoo is a heritage from two clever Europeans, brothers, who had
worked for the Gardens for years, and now I understand have
emigrated to New Zealand. They had trained the keepers well, and
there was no visible slackening up of effort. Six magnificent Komodo
Giant Monitor Lizards or " Dragons " (two are now at the Bronx
Zoo in New York), two fine Sumatra tigers, orang-utans, and a
Sumatran elephant were notable parts of the menagerie.
Going east we voyaged into the Moluccas or Spice Islands, via
the port of Makassar, Celebes. This grotesque swastika-shaped
island has now been officially re-named Sulawesi. In Makassar I was
disturbed to hear that in 1953 some 200 or more skins of the Greater
Bird of Paradise, Paradisea apoda , from the Aru Islands, which are
also a part of the Republic of Indonesia, had been shipped out of
Makassar by a local Chinese trader. These skins are said to be bought
locally from crewmen from the coastal steamers coming from the
Aru Islands for about 40 Rupiahs each. This sum is equivalent to
anything from $1.50 to $3.30, depending on official or open market
rates of exchange. It was also reported that the skins could be sold
for approximately $10.40 each in Paris or West Germany.
The only pet birds here and farther east seem to be Cockatoos,
mostly Umbrella-fronted (C. alba), and an occasional Moluccan
(C. moluccensis ), which latter species if obtainable are very expensive,
and Eclectus Parrots, with occasional lories, crimson, or green-
winged. All these parrot-like birds are caught as young at the nest
and reared on gummy, boiled rice, coconut, and coconut milk, and
maize. They obviously survive, but there must be a considerable
mortality among the young. As these species are Moluccan in origin,
they are brought to Makassar and Java on the coastal steamers by
sailors.
In the Moluccas themselves we spent three months on Ternate,
Halmahera, Tidore, Batjan, and farther east on Misool. All these
islands are as beautiful and unspoiled as ever, their forests largely
uncut, except around towns like Ternate, life being much as it has
been for centuries. It is still possible to walk out of the town of
Labuha on Batjan, for example, where Alfred Russell Wallace stopped
to see the Sultan in the 1850's, and to reach jungle, real jungle on
foot, after a couple of hours. And it is still possible in this jungle
to see Wallace's Standard-wing Bird of Paradise, that curious and

ill-proportioned looking bird, which Wallace had first seen on the
day when he stood outside the Sultan's palace, and Ali his faithful
assistant ran up with one attached to his belt.
But alas, there is not a living soul on Batjan to-day who seems to
know or care about birds of any sort. During our five weeks on that
island we asked diligently after local hunters or woodsmen, only to
be told that all the principal ones were too old or had died off. No
one has ever heard of trapping birds except parrots or cockatoos
in their nest holes. No one could do a thing to help us. Perhaps it is
just as well that the inhabitants are as indifferent as they are. Certainly
nothing is likely to change in a hurry in the Moluccas. The basic
driving forces of man, hunger, love, fear, seem somehow in abeyance
here, at least the first and the last. Love, of course, triumphs, but for
some mysterious reason the population rate is not as staggering as
farther west on Java.
At least, though, there are the islands. When typical Western
impatience is about to get the best of one, when some delay or exhibi-
tion of human frailty or inertia is nearly overwhelming, it is usually
only necessary to lift one's eyes up towards the sky, to look out over
the majestic sweep of sea and sky and pointed volcanic-cone islands,
to be glad to be there. The vivid greens of the islands, the multi-
farious blues of the sky and the sea, and the incredible panoplied
clouds are all there, unchanging, always beautiful. Those sights
and the birds we saw, shy, glimpsed often with difficulty, made our
trip worthwhile. Much of the rest of travel in these exotic lands has
become so burdensome and wearying that I doubt that many would
wish to share such a voyage to-day. In many ways it seems better by
far to settle down in an armchair with Wallace or Forbes or Guillemard
or the others, and read of it all " far away and long ago

By J. J. Yealland
Arrivals during November and December, 1956, include two
species and two sub-species new to the Collection.
These are a Finsch's Conure (Aratinga jinschi) presented by Mr. A. A.
Prestwich ; two Kansu Babblers (Trochalopterum sukatschewi), and
three Fohkien Grey-headed Crow-Tits (Psittiparus gularis fokiensis)
presented by Dr. K. C. Searle, who also sent a Ruby-throated Warbler,
and four Persian Chukors given by Professor E. Boswell.
Finsch's Conure, first described by Salvin in the Ibis of 1871, is one
of the Central American Conures inhabiting southern Nicaragua and
western Panama. The Kansu Babbler was first described in 1891 by
Berezowski and Bianchi, being found by them in the Kansu Province
of north-western China. There is only one skin of this bird in the
British Museum. It appears to have had no English name, and the
Kansu Babbler seems preferable to Sukatschew's Babbler.
The Chukors are the race Alectoris graeca werae of western and south-
western Persia and the adjoining parts of Iraq.
The Crow-Tits or Parrot-bills (Paradoxornithidae) are comparatively
little known to aviculturists here, and only three species have
previously been kept in the Society's Collection. They range from
the Himalayas to Indo-China and China, living in reed beds,
bamboo and grass jungle. The food consists of insects and their larvae,
some seeds, and buds. The birds tear off the sheaths of reed or
bamboo stems to expose the insect life sheltering beneath ; they also
open the stems themselves, and it is here that we see the purpose of
the Crow-Tits' powerful bills. Lynes, writing of Heude's Crow-Tit,
says, " The rustling, crunching and tearing noises made by a party
of birds so engaged may frequently be heard before catching sight of
them."
Writing in the Avicultural Magazine (1928, p. 30), Mr. H. C.
Eustace says of Webb's Crow-Tit that it is " kept by the Chinese only
on account of its ability to be trained for fighting . . . Although when
trained they become very desperate fighters, the wild birds are very
peaceable and gentle, and are quite safe inmates for any mixed
aviary ". The Bearded Tit was once considered to belong to this Family.
Other arrivals are a Silver-eared Mesia, an Orange-cheeked
Waxbill and a Chestnut-breasted Finch, presented by Mrs. Y.
Channing ; a Green-cheeked Parrot by Mr. L. W. R. Jones ; a

there was one well-feathered baby with a delightful little crest.
Unfortunately, it died about a week later. Further bad luck has been
with the Plum-heads. Since I last wrote, in mildly optimistic mood,
I have lost the last year's young bird (hatched May, 1955). It was
as fat as could be and a very careful P.M. in my lab. showed absolutely
nothing. I need hardly say that it was a female : the ovaries were
becoming active. It had developed a grey-green head in the first
autumn (1955) moult and a dark-grey head in the autumn (1956)
moult. I had always believed it to be a hen by the look of its head.
As if this wasn't enough--this year's young bird (a lovely one when
it emerged) has gone wrong and is now in the house on a diet of
vitamins. I am going to bring a pair into a warm room this spring,
and to h- with all the experts. Plum-heads are like Kendall :
they like it warm."

Delagour, with illustrations by Peter Scott. Published by
Country Life, London, 1956. Price #6 6^. net.
This is the second volume of the three projected, which will cover
the waterfowl, swans, geese, and ducks of the world. This compre-
hensive work on a group of birds which have a very wide interest both
to general ornithologists and to the more specialized aviculturist, is
the result of a happy combination of two experts of world renown on
their subject--Jean Delacour and Peter Scott.
As stated in the introduction to the volume under review, the
first volume (reviewed in the Jan.-Feb. number 1955 of the Avicul-
tural Magazine) dealt with the more terrestrial members of the
family Anatidae. The second volume is confined to one tribe, the
Dabbling, Surface-feeding, or River Ducks, which include thirty-eight
species of the genus Anas , together with five abberant genera each
consisting of one species, which are tentatively placed with Anas as
their position in the general system of genera and species of Anatinae
are still not clearly understood. These are the Pink-headed Duck
of India (Rhodonessa) , Australian Pink-eared Duck (Malacorhynchus ),
the Blue Duck of New Zealand [Hymenolaimus) , the South American
Torrent Ducks (Merganetta) , and the Freckled Duck ( Stictonetta ) of
parts of Australia and Tasmania.
The number of colour plates has been increased from sixteen to
twenty-four in order that every member of the tribe and its duckling
may be shown in colour. There are twenty-nine distribution maps
and a full systematic list, and indices of scientific and English names.
This is a worthy successor of the first volume and everyone interested
in waterfowl will wish to possess it. P. B-S.

ZOOLOGICAL PHOTOGRAPHY IN PRACTICE. A contribution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997230906976744" page_id="56318069"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
to the technique and Art of Wild Animal Portraiture. By Hugh B.
Cott. Illustrated. Published by the Fountain Press, London,
1956. Price #2 12s. 6 d.
This is the first book to be devoted to a subject which has become
of great importance as an aid to scientific research, and also now
attracts an increasing number of animal photographers. Birds have
always remained favourite subjects and aviculturists who wish to make
photographic records of the inmates of their aviaries will find the
information crowded into these pages invaluable. The first chapter
is devoted to the choice and characteristics of cameras and for serious
bird photography the decided preference is for the larger, heavier, and
more old-fashioned type. The author then deals with various technical
aspects--apparatus and accessories, focussing, exposure, negatives,
development, and other details ; and the reader is given detailed
information, often in tabular form, of the advantages and disadvantages
of various equipments and methods. The artistic approach to zoological
photography raises a topic on which the author is an authority as he is
a rare combination of zoologist, naturalist, artist, and skilled
photographer. An elementary knowledge of the principles of picture
design and especially the importance of tone will help the photographer
to obtain a pleasing and effective picture which impresses the subject
on the mind much more effectively than a poor one. But for the full
use of a good photograph, a negative of good quality, critical sharpness,
and sufficient size is absolutely essential.
The chapter devoted to the scientific approach to zoological photo-
graphy stresses the value of the camera in recording zoological
information, though this by no means excludes the artistic approach.
The innate responses and social behaviour of birds, for example, can
be recorded much better by the camera than by lengthy descriptions.
The use of infra-red photographs opens an entirely new and little
explored world to the naturalist, especially in the field of camouflage,
and has made possible the photography of animals in complete
darkness.
The author has travelled extensively and draws from personal
experience in giving advice on the photography of animals under
widely different conditions such as tropical rain forests, desert, and
savannah. The latter part of the book consists of a series of plates
reproducing 68 of the author's photographs of zoological subjects,
illustrating various topics discussed in the text ; but although very
good examples of the photographer's skill they hardly do justice to the
originals. The book can be thoroughly recommended to all those
interested in a fascinating hobby of great scientific value.

Illustrated. Published by Cage Birds , London, 1956. Price gs. 6 d.
This book is based on a series of articles that appeared in Cage Birds.
The author, a well-known veterinarian and biochemist who was
formerly Milford Research Professor in the University of Wales,
describes in simple language, accompanied by a series of clear diagrams,
the essential features of the anatomy and development of birds. This
information is essential for a clear understanding of the real workings
of the bird's body in health and disease. The first chapter deals with
the general framework of the body--the skeleton and joints--and is
followed by an account of the surface anatomy. Successive chapters are
concerned with the leg, wing, digestive system, excretory system,
reproductive system, respiratory system, blood system, ductless glands,
nervous system including ear and eye, and the organs of voice pro-
duction. Finally there is a chapter on the development of the chick
before hatching.
Aviculturists will find the general principles described in this book
of great help in a further understanding of the many problems
associated with the health, behaviour, general activities, and feeding
of birds in captivity. It is a useful addition to avicultural literature.

PARROTS, COCKATOOS and MACAWS. By Edward J. Boosey.
Published by the Rockcliff Press Publishing Corporation.
London, 1956. Price 21^. net.
The appearance of a book dealing with parrots, cockatoos, and
macaws by such a well-known aviculturist will be welcomed by all
those interested in these most popular birds. While still a schoolboy
Mr. Boosey bred budgerigars and Red-Rump Parrakeets and he has
five times been awarded the Avicultural Society's medal for a first
breeding in captivity of various species including the African Grey,
the Blue-fronted Amazon, and the Varied Lorikeet. He speaks with
authority, therefore, in the chapters dealing with the feeding, care
and breeding, and common parrot illnesses and how to deal with them.
There is also an interesting chapter on parrot-keeping in the past,
including mention of a Grey Parrot belonging to Henry VIII, and
another which was the favourite of the Duchess of Lennox and
Richmond, a mistress of King Charles II. The stuffed body of this
parrot is supposed to be the oldest stuffed bird in the world and is
preserved in Westminster Abbey.
There are brief descriptions of each species and useful notes on the
characteristics of the more common ones, many of which have been
kept by the author. It is rather unfortunate, however, that more care

has not been given to the nomenclature of the group, for numerous
errors have crept into the text-- Kakaioe for Kakatoe ; Pyocephalus for
Poicephalus ; Loppochroa for Lophochroa ; Caliptorhynclus for Caliptorhynchus,
to mention only a few of the more obvious mistakes. Also the term
Chrysotis is retained although this has long been merged in the genus
Amazona.
The excellent bird photographs illustrating the text were specially
taken by the author's partner, Alec Brooksbank, and add considerably
to the interest of the book.

Rare Bird Records and " Escapes "
The number of birds which have been added to the British List has greatly increased
during recent years, no doubt in no small part due to the widespread interest in bird
watching and the large number of bird-watchers there are all over the country.
In the case of some species, however, there is always a doubt as to whether these are
genuine wild birds or escapes from zoos or private owners. With waterfowl this is
particularly the case and for this reason the Avicultural Society instituted its ringing
scheme for waterfowl, the rings issued being a light blue in order that they should be
as visible as possible in the field ; an additional advantage in the use of these rings
is the possibility of restoring the " lost " birds to their owners.
The Editors of British Birds in which records of rare birds are published are always
anxious to establish without doubt that the records are of truly wild specimens and
to this end the aid of aviculturists is earnestly sought. If anyone has lost a bird which
might be taken for a visitor to this country it would be of great assistance if he would
report this to the Hon. Secretary of the Society or to the Editor of the Avicultural
Magazine.
The most recent " record " confronting the Editors of British Birds at present, is a
Flamingo seen at Bartley Reservoir, near Birmingham, on 2nd December, 1956.
Inquiries from likely zoos have elicited that no bird has been lost from these collections.
It seems more than likely that this bird is an escape. Can readers of the Avicultural
Magazine help to solve this problem ?

ROSEATE x BARE-EYED COCKATOO HYBRID
By Karol Lukaszewicz (Director of the Zoo, Wroclaw, Poland)
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.998126833333334" page_id="56318078"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
The female Bare-eyed Cockatoo possessed by the Wroclaw Zoo
was quite an old bird when, in 1948, it returned from a temporary
post-war exile to our bird house. Its very clamorous call, uttered
especially frequently in the evening hours, and heard far away in the
park, made me suspect that it was a female. For a time it shared
the same aviary and company of a Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo,
then lived with many other parrots, but was much dreaded by them
because of its pugnacious character. Finally, it associated itself with
a red Macaw until, in 1953, the Zoo came into possession of a Roseate
Cockatoo, whose most outstanding quality consisted in a remarkable
" repertoire 55 of some fifty Polish words.
The two cockatoos became excellent friends from the very moment
they saw each other and as the Bare-eyed at the same time stopped
giving its evening concerts of cries, I thought it proper to give this
somewhat unusual couple an opportunity to nest. A trunk of an old
elm tree, 5 feet high with a diameter of some 12 inches, was placed
in one corner of the aviary. A circular hole measuring 4 inches was
made in the front of the bark-covered trunk and below this an oblong
fissure invited the birds to work it with their beaks so as to enlarge
the shallow cavity inside the trunk. Both cockatoos took great interest
in working at the trunk. Day after day the Roseate male left the
whole of the ground near the trunk covered with chips and splinters,
it worked so hard. Gradually the hole inside the trunk became
larger and larger and the birds managed to transform the narrow
fissure into a wide entrance to their nest situated a little below the
original circular opening.
By the beginning of 1955 it was evident that the friendship of the
two cockatoos was of the most serious nature. The best proof of it
was an egg laid on the last day of March. The Roseate male and
the Bare-eyed female were sitting and incubating most assiduously on

their nest and in the intervals did not stop working at the trunk.
After twenty-one days of incubation the keeper found, on the morning
of 18th May, that a young bird had hatched and was lying dead on
the sand on the ground of the aviary. A conspicuous feature of the
young was a well-developed bare area around the eyes.
Six months later, in December, 1955, the cockatoos mated again
several times during a week. Eggs, two in number, pure white and
the size of a larger pigeon egg, were laid on 6th and 8th January.
Incubation began once, the male relieving the female every three
hours by day and night, and lasted for thirty-two days. The young
ones hatched on 8th February and lived for twelve days. Their rate
of growth showed itself to be very good. At the time of death they
were covered with conspicuous quills. The explanation of this mishap
is not easy. Obviously the parents fed the young birds well and we
found no reason to interfere by taking them out of the nest. The
birds were absolutely unmolested and the keeper did not even dare
to enter the cage because of the agressiveness of both adult birds.
The post-mortem examination of the two young ones, which were
normally developed and weighed respectively 88.5 gr. and 118.0 gr.
did not reveal any pathological changes. The stomach and the
intestines, however, were copiously filled with sand, which was
probably brought with the food. The floor of the aviary was therefore
scrupulously cleared of sand and only a small box containing some
gravel was left in the aviary for the parents.
Almost immediately after the death of the young ones the parents
mated again and eggs were laid on 10th, 12th, and 17th March. The
laying of the last egg was somewhat belated and for three days the
female (the Bare-eyed) was evidently feeling sick ; it could not keep
perched normally across the branches but laid along them with its I
eyes shut and shivering, often with cowered wings--a typical picture
of what in German is called the Legenot. Two eggs disappeared in
an unaccountable way leaving no trace. Finally, on 5th April, 1956,
a young one hatched and was reared successfully up to the age of
twenty-one days, when suddenly the parents stopped feeding it. This
was noticed too late and the young one died from under-nourishment.
On 21 st and 25th May, 1956, again three eggs were laid. The
incubation was regular and lasted from twenty-five to thirty days.
The first young cockatoo hatched on 15th May and from the beginning
was obviously a stronger bird. The two others did not thrive and
died a few days after hatching, on 18th and 20th May. The survivor
was left with the parents for ten days, during which it was regularly
fed by them. On 26th May, however, as the parents were observed
to be neglecting their duties, the old cockatoos were moved to an
aviary some distance away and the young hybrid confided to the 1
care of a keeper, Mrs. Teresa Ungert.

The bird was fed by the keeper from her mouth every two hours
between 7.30 a.m. and 6.30 p.m. For the first three days it was given
a pap of hard-boiled yolk and toast in this way ; then chopped and
crushed sunflower seed and fresh strawberry juice were added.
Gradually this diet was amplified by cake, pulped mashed apple,
boiled rice with strawberry juice, pumpkin seed, lemon and red
currant juice, fresh cherries, and tomatoes.
The young cockatoo grew fast and fledged normally, the quills
appearing first on the wings and the crest after the eighth day. After
a month the feathers developed to such an extent as to show the
colours. The general colouring was that of the father : dove-grey
above, dirty rosy-yellow on cheeks and underparts, with pure white
primaries. The bare area round the eye, characteristic of the mother
(C. gymnopis ), was well developed but instead of the blue tinge of
C. gymnopis it was a pronounced yellow colour. From the age of four
weeks the young hybrid began to utter peeping sounds, when six weeks
old it began to preen its plumage. Unfortunately, on 13th August,
after a short period of sickness the young cockatoo died of pneumonia,
probably contracted during a stay of a few minutes outside the
house, when having its photograph taken.
The experiment of artificially rearing a cockatoo hybrid, despite
the final negative result, has thus proved successful. The hybrid lived
fifty-nine days and it is probable that, in spite of an undoubtedly
delicate constitution it might have been brought to complete maturity.
The anatomical examination, however, showed that the skeleton of
the young bird was rather weak, and therefore in future attempts
greater attention must be paid to the supply of mineral components.
The interbreeding of C. roseicapilla and C. gymnopis seems to indicate
that the two species are more closely related to each other than has
been assumed in the past.

By C. af Enehjelm (Helsingfors, Finland)
In 1951 I got two specimens of the Little Owl from Germany. The
birds were exactly similar in size so I had no idea as to the sex. In
winter they were kept in a well-lighted indoor aviary about 10x4 feet
and 8 feet high. They spent the summer in a compartment in our cages
for small birds of prey. This compartment is 20 X 5 feet and 8 feet
high with an adjoining open-fronted shelter 5X5 feet. The upper
part is boarded about 3 feet downwards from the roof, giving the birds
an undisturbed and well protected shelter. In the climate of Finland
we are simply forced to take most birds--even our native ones--
inside for the winter, among other reasons, in order to prevent the
soft food and meat from freezing as hard as a stone. The keeping of
birds and mammals in a climate like our's presents problems unknown
to avicultural and zoological colleagues living in milder latitudes. We
cannot release the birds into the outdoor aviaries too early in the spring,
as experience has shown that, even if kept in only slightly warmed
rooms, the birds are rather delicate if put outside in the early spring,
even though the same specimens may stand quite low temperatures in
late autumn without any ill effects.
In 1952 and 1953 the Little Owls made no attempt to nest, but early
in April, 1954, two white eggs were laid on the floor of the flight. On
2nd April, 1955, an egg was found on the floor of the flight. Without
very high hopes I constructed a nest of brick on the floor of the flight and
covered it with a piece of plywood kept in position with a brick.
Inside I made a nest of some hay and put the newly-laid egg in the
nest. Contrary to my expectations the nest was accepted and four more
eggs laid in it. As far as I could see incubation started about 8th April.
On 6th May I observed some egg-shells in front of the nest and on
removing the plywood cover saw some white, downy youngsters under
the female. I was not able to find out whether all the eggs had hatched
as I did not want to disturb the birds unnecessarily. Observation of
the birds was not easy as one of the parents, obviously the female,
immediately disappeared into the nest when the room was entered.
The old birds were not shy in a hysterical way, but were always on the
watch for every movement ; they had obviously been caught when
full grown. When I looked into the nest a fortnight later I saw that all
the eggs had hatched and the youngsters were obviously thriving well.
As far as I could see they were all the same size and I am under the
impression that incubation had started as soon as the eggs were laid or
possibly at least most of them. On 6th June I saw three youngsters
popping round on the floor when I entered the room, but they all
immediately disappeared into the nest. I entered the flight and j

removed the cover of the nest and all five youngsters came out and
went running round the aviary, trying to fly without success. About a
week later, however, they were all sitting on their perches, 6-7 feet
high, but for several days they rushed down to the nest whenever the
room was entered. After yet another week they remained on their
perches or flew from perch to perch and I removed the nest. The
family was then moved to the outside flight, the young having first
been ringed with aluminium parrakeet rings. They are all thriving
very well. When they left the nest the young were similar in colour to
their parents and are now quite indistinguishable, so I am glad I ringed
them in good time.
As to food, the owls have mainly been fed on white mice, rats, and
golden hamsters, very occasionally also with chickens, crows (the two
last named being cut into suitable pieces), and Budgerigar runners.
Fresh ants 5 eggs were scattered over the food. We breed a lot of
hamsters as food for our small owls and birds of prey and they obviously
seem to prefer them to other rodents. In my experience Little Owls are
considerably easier to keep than many other small species, for instance,
Tengmalm's and Passerine Owls. With exactly the same treatment the
Tengmalm's Owls are difficult to maintain for any length of time.
They seem to thrive quite well for some time but suddenly sit on the
ground and are usually dead within a day or two.
I have never seen the Little Owls bathing, even if suitable facilities
(at least in my opinion) are always at their disposal. But they seem to
enjoy sitting outside in the rain and getting their feathers wet.
As a summary : it seems that the eggs are laid at intervals of one
day and that incubation starts when the last or second last egg is laid.
Incubation obviously lasts about four weeks. The youngsters leave the
nest (in captivity, at least) when about a month old and can fly quite
well a week later. After the nestling down there does not seem to be
any intermediate colour in their first plumage, but the young
immediately attain the colour of the old birds, a fact I have also
observed when breeding Eagle-Owls.
I regret that my observations are not more exact, but as this is the
first time I have bred this species I would not take any risks as I was
anxious to get a complete success with the birds.
Additional note .--In the winter 1955-56 I unfortunately lost the old
hen and one youngster and no attempts to breed were made by the
remaining five birds in the spring of 1956.

By J. R. van Oosten (San Marino, California, U.S.A.)
My adventures with birds started when I was born, but it took me
until my fifteenth birthday to realize that fact. My father had always
kept a large cage of African finches in the house and these always used
to fascinate me. In 1941 we moved to California and, once settled
here, he built an aviary which housed common finches and parrakeets.
Right after the war years we built another aviary, smaller, which
would enable us to house our finches separately. Then in 1948 I came
across a copy of Aviculture and with that my adventures really began. In
the issue was an article written by Mr. A. H. Isenberg on the breeding
of some Alcippes. I promptly wrote him regarding softbills and where
it might be possible to obtain some. His answer put me in contact
with another grand gentleman, Mr. Ray Thomas, whom I met and
had a chance first-hand to see my first softbills. Through both these
men I learned how to keep and take care of these beautiful gems.
I owe a great deal to them, for had it not been for their advice and
assistance I might never have become interested in birds.
In the early months of 1949, while driving back to Los Angeles,
I stopped at a pet shop and purchased my first pair of softbills for
the sum of 25 dollars--a pair of White-cheeked Bulbuls. Since that
time one might say that I have become a " bird-nut ", for my love for
birds grows more with each passing day and at present being only
twenty-two I can look forward to many enjoyable years with birds.
Besides the two above aviaries we now have three large ones for
the various size softbills--large, medium, and small. The large-size
aviary houses Toucans, Magpies, Jays, etc., and is planted with various
bushes and small trees and includes an orange tree. It is 18 feet long,
15 feet wide, and 12 feet high with an added shelter on the outside,
enclosed except for two windows and the front. The aviary for
medium-sized softbills is 36 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 10 feet high
with an adjoining shelter 21 feet long, 9 feet wide, and 7 feet high.
The shelter is divided into two parts so that food may be placed in
two separate places in order to eliminate fights. This aviary contains
Jay-Thrushes, Jays, Thrushes, Barbets, Sibias, Starlings, Troupials,
etc., and is likewise planted with bushes, small trees, and one orange
tree. The last one is our " glass house " aviary for the small birds
such as Tanagers, Sugar Birds, Redstarts, Bulbuls, etc. The house is
24 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 8 feet high with an adjoining flight
15 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 9 feet high. Both the house and the
flight are planted with small bushes, vines, grasses, and a few small
trees. Also in this aviary we built a two-tiered running waterfall
which the birds seem to enjoy greatly as it draws many insects and
bacteria. All the perches and swings in the three aviaries are dead

tree branches, which I feel helps to simulate natural surroundings as
well as making the aviary look more artistic.
To-day one does not read very much about softbills so I decided to
write an article for the Magazine, giving some of my experiences
with the birds in my collection. It is further hoped that this may spur
on other collectors of softbills to write on their birds as they may have
witnessed things which would be of interest to other enthusiasts.
The most outstanding event in my collection thus far was my
fortunate success in raising two hybrid Mynahs this year. Housed in
the " glass house 53 were a beautiful pair of Grey-headed Mynahs
which have been here for three years. While away at college the
hen was lost and the cause of death not determined. In the same
enclosure were also two pairs and an extra hen Pagoda Mynah which
have been here for six years. Early this year the male Grey-headed
chose the odd female Pagoda as his mate. I had hopes that the two
might breed and sure enough they did two months later. As both these
birds are well known to aviculture I see no reason for going into
details of their respective descriptions. It might be worth mentioning,
however, that the females of both species are easy to sex. I have
found that the females are all a shade lighter than the males, and
this is especially noticeable if the birds are in the sun or upon close
inspection of three or more birds.
The pair settled down and by April had chosen a redwood stained
parrakeet nest-box as their nesting site. The only materials used in
building were twigs and a few feathers. The material was slanted
from the opening down to the back with the eggs being laid in one
corner. As I was unable to be home all the time no accurate record
was kept. However, four eggs were laid and four young hatched by
the middle of June. One youngster disappeared after four days and
I suspect that the male Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock was responsible.
Soon after, four days later, another baby was found dead in the nest.
The two remaining are now fully feathered and not dependent upon
their parents.
The youngsters were fed my formula egg-food mixture, soaked
currants, all sorts of fruit--apple, grapes, tomato, pear, banana--
milk sop, canned dog food, and Mockingbird food. The only live
food which was used was live fruit-flies which I propagate within the
aviary by filling half-way a 5-lb. lard can with fruit rinds. I find that
there is no odour and hundreds of live flies, which all the birds love,
are produced.
Both youngsters show very little colour beyond grey. The wings,
back, rump, and tail are a deep powder grey. Head, neck, chest,
belly, and vent are a very light powder grey, in which they resemble
their father. The bill, feet, and eyes are also the same as their father's.
There seem to be some black feathers coming on the crest of the

head, as in the Pagoda, but only the next moult will show for sure.
Beyond this they show none of the colour or other characteristics of
their mother. Their size is between the two, but this may change
when they reach maturity. Needless to say, sexing is not yet possible
although one seems a little brighter than the other. They have at
present all the antics of their father as they are always chirupping and
running around in a never-ending search for bugs. I will write further
on these two birds after they pass their first moult.
Another unique nesting took place in the " glass house " by a pair
of Pope Cardinals which each year for the last four years have main-
tained two nests at the same time. Both birds have been seen
entering the nests and at times neither one was seen, and upon my
entering the " glass house " each would come out of a nest. They
nested twice each year, during the spring and summer, and as yet
have never reared a young one. This is due to the lack of mealworms,
which are only fed during the winter months. They have never been
observed catching or eating fruit-flies so this no doubt is where the
trouble comes in. Unfortunately, I am not home so am unable to
feed the live food required ; however, I feel that both broods could
be reared if the live food were supplied. There are always four eggs
in each nest and four youngsters hatch.
About two years ago my male White-cheeked Bulbul died of old age.
The pair had been very devoted to each other, but as soon as the
male was gone the hen promptly killed my female White-eared Bulbul
and mated with the male. They had one nest each year, but the
youngsters just vanished into thin air. They built the nests in a
canary-type outside cage-nest. The nest was covered with palm leaves
on the sides and the top, leaving the front open. The nests were
constructed of dried grasses, twigs, and feathers, and lined with string
and cotton. Two eggs were always laid and the hen sat close at all
times ; she was fed by the male. This year no nest was built as the
hen is rather old and cannot fly very well although she is in perfect
condition. The White-eared male is a most devoted husband and sits
with her most of the day and preens her feathers. He also hawks
fruit-flies which he feeds her, as he seems to know that she is unable
to fly very well.
In the summer of 1954 while sitting in the aviary taking notes, all
of a sudden I found the cause of the disappearing Bulbul youngsters.
Hovering outside the nest like a Humming Bird the Scarlet Cock-of-the-
Rock reached in with his beak and took one of the young. He then
flew to a perch where he struck it a few times and then swallowed it
whole. Needless to say, the babies were not more than a few days
old. Had I not seen it then and again on other occasions I would
never have believed it. The guilty party was believed to be a male
Orange-headed Ground Thrush. Because of lack of space I was unable

to remove the bird and was therefore unable to raise any young.
These young could have proved to be a very interesting hybrid but
unfortunately I shall never know.
Also within this aviary are housed a pair of Button Quail, and
after two nests, young all reared, the babies began to disappear.
I feel certain that the same bird is responsible ; however, he never
bothers the White-eyes or Yuhinas which sleep near him at night.
Mrs. Erlanger some years ago had babies from Cocks-of-the-Rock
and she fed them baby mice. It is very possible that breeding these
lovely birds might be achieved by feeding some of the larger live
food, such as baby mice and rats.
Another attempted nesting took place this summer but met with
failure. The pair consisted of a male Orange-headed Ground Thrush
and a female White-throated Ground Thrush, both birds had been
imported from India in 1950. Up till two years ago I only suspected
the sex, but I could not be sure. The female Orange-headed had to
be placed in the medium-sized softbill aviary for fear that the male
would kill her. However, the White-throated was left in as he took
no notice of her. The male was much deeper in colour than the female
and was heard singing on a few occasions. This year there was no
doubt that they were a pair as one egg was laid and sat on for five
days before it was broken. During this time the male was never more
than 5 feet away from the nest and any bird coming too close was at once
chased off. I have found these birds to be very nervous and no doubt
this caused the failure because if anyone came to the aviary the
female would leave the nest. The nest was built 4 feet off the ground
in the right-hand front corner of the aviary in a small, but thick,
spruce tree. The tree was right behind the waterfall and could not
be seen from outside the aviary even though the nest was 2 feet from
the wire. The nest itself reminded one strongly of a dove's nest,
although it had a sort of a mud plaster holding the bottom together.
Upon closer inspection I noticed that twigs had been laid between
two branches, then some twigs placed in the opposite direction and
covered with mud. The nest was roughly lined with grass and a few
leaves. No further attempt was made by these birds, although both
were seen carrying twigs on several occasions.
I have found that both these birds are very friendly towards other
birds. At present there is an English Robin in with them and they
take no notice of him. Also a pair of White-capped Redstarts had
been kept in the same cage and not once had the Ground Thrushes
been seen chasing them or even paying them any heed. This also
holds true for a female Rainbow Bunting that always seems to get
the fruit-fly just at the moment the Orange-headed is reaching for it.
Also at one time a Shama Thrush had been in the same aviary with
the same good results. One day by accident my father turned loose

a male Kashmir Blue Thrush and the Ground Thrushes wasted no
time in trying to get a hold of him and do him in. He was taken

Next number I will relate an almost successful attempt by a pair of

birds which are housed in my collection. I will tell how my birds

BREEDING LOVEBIRDS IN CALIFORNIA

in England, I would like to write about the very good luck I have had

in breeding them. In December, 1955, I finished an aviary 20 feet long,
10 feet high, and 8 feet wide. By March, 1956, I had acquired four
pairs of Peach-faced, two pairs of Masked, and three pairs of Fischer's,
and put them all into this one big aviary. With plenty of nest-boxes
I had very little, if any, fighting, and have not bred a hybrid in the
aviary. On 1st September, 1956, I took the boxes down for a three-
month rest, and at that date had reared forty-one lovebirds, twenty-
four Peach-faced, four blue Masked, seven Masked, and six Fischer's.
I got a little impatient and put the nest-boxes in early, and to-day
(6th January, 1957) I have seven baby Fischer's flying along with
two blue Masked the Fischer's reared with their own. In the nest
I have three Masked, three blue Masked, and two Peach-faced two
weeks old. Also two nests of Peach-faced, five eggs in each box, all
fertile, due to hatch any day, also one other pair of blue Masked
due to hatch in about a week. The only trouble I have had is when
the young come out of the nest the Peach-faced like to bite the
youngsters' feet causing them much trouble but not injuring them.
The winter here in southern California has been very mild, many
days being in the 8o's and nights in the 50's, with only about two
rainy days in December and January so far. In this wonderful climate
the raising of these lovebirds is not rare or out of the ordinary, for
many of my friends have done as well and some better, and I take
none of the credit. The birds just love it here and will fill one's

By David M. West (Montebello, Calif., U.S.A.)
Last year one of the more interesting breeding successes was the
rearing of four young hybrid Brown's x Yellow Rosella (P. flaveolus ).
Last fall I finally despaired of obtaining proper mates for the male
Brown's and the female Yellow Rosella, so it was decided to put the
two birds together and attempt to produce some hybrids. From the
very first minute of introduction the two birds agreed, despite the
difference in size between the smaller Brown's Rosella and the larger
female Yellow Rosella. Formerly, when paired to a female Brown's,
the cock was quite given to driving his mate about, but he did not
continue this practice with the Yellow Rosella hen. Apparently
her greater size impressed him, and he made his advances to her
with the greatest of care.
During March the pair were frequently seen feeding and the
cock Brown's displayed to his mate almost every morning. Two large
nest-boxes were put up about the middle of March and the pair were
often seen visiting the boxes after this. By April it was apparent that
the hen was most seriously interested in the smaller of the two boxes,
and much of the sawdust and wood chips were being ejected by her.
In late April the pair were observed mating, and shortly after that
the hen disappeared into the box.
No investigation was made during incubation ; as the hen would
always tumble back into the box upon seeing anyone approaching.
The first opportunity to investigate the contents of the nest-box was
on 16th May, when the temperature was well over ioo degrees and
the hen was off the box. The nest was observed to contain four nice
youngsters that were probably just five or six days old, and very
closely intertwined.
During the period the young were in the box both parents fed
them, and the male was frequently observed to enter the box to do
his fair share. The usual grains, fruit, and extras in the form of greens
were given and both parents spent large amounts of time caring for the
growing family.
The first two youngsters left the nest when about five weeks old.

They were excellent fliers and very steady. The second two youngsters
left the nest two days later, and they too were steady and quite tame.
Before the second two left the nest the mother had laid again, and is
now incubating.
As this cross has not, apparently, been achieved before, a short
description of the youngsters may be of interest. They are best
described as almost completely resembling their mother--being quite
identical in coloration with her save for the fact that they have pale
orange under tail-coverts where the true Yellow Rosella has pale
yellow under tail-coverts. There are also a few pale orange feathers
on their breasts--but otherwise they are closely akin to young Yellow
Rosellas. This similarity to the mother is rather surprising, for I
had rather thought that they would resemble a combination of the
two parents which are quite different from each other. Still, crosses
between the widely different Pennant's X Barnard's result in young
that are so nearly pure Barnard's in appearance that only an expert
would be able to tell the difference.
Eventually I anticipate breeding the young male hybrids back to
their Yellow Rosella mother, and see if the resultant young are not
good enough to try and re-establish the Yellow Rosella in my collec-
tion for new imports are out of the question, and the Yellow Rosella
is very scarce in the U.S.A.

a kind of baksheesh, as my own life has become after being saved by
the drug " Cortisone ". Towards the end of a very long illness, my
kind friend Fred Logan (who came to my rescue when the person who
was looking after my collection suddenly disappeared, with the result
of the loss of nearly half the birds) set a quantity of pheasant eggs.
These all duly hatched, were reared, and most of them given to
friends. However, there were five eggs left over, we did not know of
what species they were or how old. Mr. Logan went to a good deal of
trouble, as it was then late in the season to get a broody bantam. At
that time I was well enough to do a few chores connected with the
birds and one was to see after the bantam hen.
The chicks from the first lot of eggs were now quite large. From their
earliest chickenhood, with the aid of the gardener, we moved their pens
to fresh ground every day . . . but, Oh ! . . . the damage the young
Crossoptilons did to my nice smooth lawns ! In fact they have not
recovered yet.

Crossoptilons, being mainly root feeders, dig for their living, and
how those chicks dug ! At the end of each day there were dozens of
holes in the sward into each of which one could put a tennis ball.
Every evening the bantam was taken off the eggs, but she was in
such a state of broodiness that she used to rush back on to them as soon
as she was lifted off. To stop this the grille in front of the coop was
placed back until she had finished feeding.
One day the housekeeper came to say that there was a long-distance
call on the telephone. Now the aviaries are at the bottom end of a small
orchard and quite a distance from the house. By the time I had heard
most of the " birdy " gossip from London the hen and the eggs had
been clean forgotten. Next day, about 6 p.m., the hen was seen sitting
disconsolately before the grille and the eggs stone cold after twenty-
four hours' exposure on a rather cold day and night. Not wanting
anyone to realize what a fool I had been, I decided to let the hen sit
out the allotted span and then throw the eggs away, saying they must
have been stale and had not germinated.
Ten days after the normal incubation period I thought it would be
better to smash one of the eggs to see if they really were bad. The egg
was flung with much force on to the hard gravel, but nothing happened.
The process was then repeated with much more vigour, this time the
shell cracked and blood poured out and a faint cheeping was heard ;
on picking up the damaged egg a tiny beak was seen apparently gasping
its last. Believing in the old adage " while there's life there's hope ",
the much-damaged egg was put back under the hen. The next day the
shell had disappeared and running about at lightning speed was a
beautiful little Grossoptilon chick. I believe the Chinese name
" Manchee " means the bird that can run faster than a horse. I can
guarantee that no one on foot could ever be able to overtake one of
these birds.
The next day another little chick was seen, but alas, just as the grille
was being lowered between the coop and the run it shot out from under
the hen into the run, the grille fell on the bird's neck and after a few
convulsive struggles the tiny body flopped over, became limp, and
appeared to breathe its last. Being in a hurry I left the body until later
in the day, but when I came to the birds again it wasn't there and the
next day two very lively chicks were seen running about the pen. They
flourished exceedingly, until they were too big for the run and were
then put with their older brothers and sisters, who chivvied them
around with their mock fights and kept them from the food dishes.
The two poor twins started to grow listless and mope, they became
dejected and ill so, having nowhere to put them, I set them free in the
orchard. At first they hung about the birdroom, looking for scraps of
food and odd mealworms which managed to get out of the breeding
box. In the course of time they grew much better, due to feeding on

all manner of things, grass in particular, and, to my sorrow, rare bulb
species which they dug out of the rockeries. Gradually the menu was
extended to include all manner of things, raspberries, alpine straw-
berries (Frais du bois ), insects ; they played havoc with the lettuce bed
in the kitchen garden, and all the time they dug everywhere, but meal-
worms proved the factor which rendered them tamer than domestic
poultry. Used properly, mealworms will tame almost any bird. The
larger of the two we called " Emma ", in remembrance of a female
given to me many years ago by Mr. Delacour, a bird of great character.
However, " Emma " turned out to be a male and his mate a female.
The latter was always shyer than her brother, in fact when first let out
she was very wild and, indeed, I often thought she would fly away,
in fact she once did, but we got her back again. It is useless to pinion
these birds when chicks, for besides their swiftness they are remarkable
for their jumping propensities, they can easily leap on to a 8 or 9 ft.
fence or shed. And it's next to impossible to catch a Crossoptilon when
once thoroughly frightened unless it is cornered, and it is never wise
to handle them, for no bird loses its feathers so quickly. When one of
these birds has lost its confidence in humans only complete incarcera-
tion will keep it from flying or running away.
For a long time after the male became so tame the female stayed in
the background. " Emma " always thought of me as another Cros-
soptilon and, in the manner of his species, he talked to me all the time
I was around. A better scientific name for the species would be
C. garrulax ! All the time these birds are together they hold long con-
versations with each other. Beebe mentions this in his study of the
birds in their native state. In time I learned quite a bit of their language
and what a rather loud, snake-like hiss, which is very seldom heard in
captivity, means, which is " I am not annoyed but I don't like what
you are doing ". The pair would go every day to their parents' aviary
and spend many hours conversing with them. " Emma " seems to have
a great aversion to the glass vessels which are used for the nectar-
feeding birds, these he will take up when they are being collected or
being washed and will deliberately break them one by one. Why he
does this I can never make out.
He would jump on to my knee if I was sitting down and let me handle
any part of him, but he usually hissed when I touched his tail, though
he did not move away. The tail of the Blue Crossoptilon is remarkable
in that it is composed of twenty-four feathers, which is more than that
of most other birds except the Bulwer's Pheasant. The central feathers
are from 18 to 24 inches long and the ends curve downwards, the
webs are very disintegrated and are like long fine hairs and in old
birds are 8 to 10 inches long and when used in the plumage trade are
known as " glycerined ostrich feathers ". The outer tail feathers are
normal, the lower half being white and the end half being iridescent

steel-blue. The outer and middle tail feathers gradually integrate one
with another, in a manner difficult to explain.
One unfortunate thing about the Grossoptilons is that they are very
prone to feather biting, not of their own plumage but that of their
mates. As they usually roost together, head to tail, they indulge in a
kind of feather-biting competition, which soon renders their nether
regions a very unsightly mess. I keep the hen separate from the cock,
except during the breeding season, this seems to be the only way of
keeping their plumage perfect.
On the whole the birds are very good tempered, except with other
species of pheasants, which they will immediately start to kill. Even if
one catches the victim in time the aggressors will continue their
attacks by jumping up and pecking it when one is carrying it out of the
aviary. With all other species I have found them perfectly safe, though
they will not stand any interference from any bird. One pair share an
aviary with a pair of Choughs and when these were first placed with
the Grossoptilons they commenced, in the usual crow-like way, to
tease and play jokes on their companions ; they very soon put the
Choughs in their place and woe betide them if they ever try any tricks
these days.
Strange to say, these two species are also companions in the high and
remote regions which is their native habitat, at from 10,000 to
16,000 feet. Amongst themselves they are very peaceful, except when
young they indulge in a great deal of mock fighting, perhaps more so
than any other pheasant, but when they have got rid of their youthful
inhibitions no bird could be less aggressive ; in a wild state they are
highly gregarious.
Feather biting is even worse in the Brown species and one rarely
sees one of these birds whose feathers are not completely ruined by this
unfortunate habit. Of course, if one has a big enough estate the best
thing is to have them loose, like domestic fowls ; they will stay around
the house, but are apt on occasions to wander, though if left alone they
always come back, but the sight of so strange a bird as a Grossoptilon
is sure to cause a hue and cry and the poor bird is so chivvied and
chased by both humans and dogs that it loses its sense of direction as
in the end it is chased further and further away from its home.
Another thing, with keeping the birds at liberty they are certainly
not a gardener's friend and, leaving rare bulbs, etc., aside, they are apt
to think that one's kitchen garden produce is grown solely for them and,
in the end, one has to resort to the local greengrocer for one's vegetables.
If one does not mind all this, one will have delightfully tame and
intelligent pets which are also feather perfect, and a feather perfect and
tame Grossoptilon is a very beautiful creature.
It seems a pity that these extremely interesting birds, which look like
meeting with extinction in the near future (in fact, the Brown species

is thought to have become almost extinct through killing and deforesta-
tion in its native haunts on the mountains of Shansi and Chihli, in
North-western China) are not more widely kept and bred, for no birds
are easier to rear than these. One wonders what will happen to the
genus Crossoptilon now that Tibet, Szechuan, Yunnan, Shansi,
Kokonor, and Kansu, the home of these birds, have been " liberated ",
as the Communists call their occupation, from the domination of
Buddhism, a gentle and enlightened religion which teaches the
sanctity of all life. One wonders too, what will happen to the other
splendid pheasants, of which we know so little, which inhabit those
lofty regions, the Chinese and Sclater's Monal's (I consider myself
very lucky to have seen living specimens of the former, one of the most
magnificent of pheasants, when in China in 1936, being one of the very
few Europeans to have done so. These birds were later shipped to
Europe but died en route), the Tragopans, the Koklass, and the uniquely
coloured Blood Pheasants (of which it seems less than ten individuals
have ever reached Europe and of which thirteen sub-species are known),
not to mention various other species.
After reading the late Hachisuka's recently published book on the
extinct birds of the Mascarene Islands, in which we read " no
other part of the world . . . contained such an extraordinary avi-
fauna . . . and nowhere was the destruction more rapid or complete "
one contemplates on the question, if Buddhists had discovered these
fair islands would we not have with us to-day all those many and
fantastic forms of avian life, which were so swiftly swept to oblivion
after the discovery and occupation by the Portuguese, Dutch, French,
and English, and which for untold aeons of time had known no enemies
until so-called Christian Man came on the scene. Forty-seven
species were exterminated, including a huge 6 ft. high, white and red
water-hen, the giant black Ground Parrots and, amongst others, the
very Dodo itself. There may have been other species, we shall never
know, for all we have to tell us of those exterminated are an odd stuffed
specimen or two, a few bones and skeletons, notes in ancient manu-
scripts, or mention in some aged tomes on travel written by those who
visited those far distant isles, the reading of which leaves the bird-
loving ornithologist sick at heart at the sadistic ways of mankind. Sad
to say, the same story is being enacted all over the world to-day, in
spite of the endeavours of those who try to preserve our great heritage.
To get back to Crossoptilons, when in California a few years ago
I saw hybrids between the White and Blue species. In shape they were
exactly like the Blue, which is different to that of the White. These
birds were most beautiful and attractive, being of a pale lavender blue.
I do not know if any of them are left as I understand that Mr. Gibson,
on whose ranch I saw them, has disposed of all his vast collection of
birds. As mentioned before, it is not known if the Brown Crossoptilon

still exists in its natural habitat, which was the western mountain
ranges of Shansi and Chilli, in China, most parts of which have become
practically desert regions with the continual deforestation and
subsequent erosion. It seems to have been introduced into Europe
nearly a hundred years ago and since then few wild specimens have
reached us. The breed is therefore very inbred, which accounts for the
low fertility of the eggs. To save this bird it seems that it will be
necessary to cross it with the Blue to ensure fresh and stronger blood
and then breed back again to the pure Brown. Though a free breeder
when it first arrived here, it is becoming very much rarer in captivity
owing to the cause mentioned above and everything should be done
to save the species while there is yet time.
As to the White Crossoptilons, very few Europeans have ever seen
these in their native haunts, as they live in probably the most inaccessible
and remote parts of the world and which, no doubt, will always remain
so owing to the difficulty of any transport ever reaching there. Their
habitat is in the high Eastern Himalayas, in that part of the world
where Tibet, Burma, and China meet. We are told they range from
10,000 to 16,000 feet and upwards. The existence of these birds has
been perpetuated by the influence of the kindly Buddhist monks, whose
lamastries are situated in those lofty and distant regions. I was
fortunate enough to see some of these wonderful birds whilst in
California, where a few were sent in 1936. Unfortunately they are not
prolific like their congenitors and very few are bred. These lovely
birds are snow-white, their immaculate plumage being set off by the
scarlet face and legs and the brilliant, iridescent, purple-blue tail
feathers. The story of how the first Blue Crossoptilons were procured
in 1929 and of how they were first carried in baskets by coolies, then on
the backs of donkeys, and finally by river boat during a journey of
over six months' duration from Kansu, in the far interior of China,
several thousand miles to Shanghai, is told by Herr Hampe and
quoted by Mr. Jean Delacour in his fine book The Pheasants of the World ,
and makes fascinating reading.

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
I thought the accompanying photograph of the brood of five young
Blue Ringneck Parrakeets bred here at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm
during the 1956 season might be of interest. They are the progeny
of the late Duke of Bedford's famous original breeding pair of these
birds, which came to Keston on his death and have since reared ten
young ones in all--one in 1954 ; four in 1955 ; and five in 1956.
Incidentally, their latest brood is, in my experience, just one more than
Ringnecks generally produce--their broods usually consisting of
threes and fours.
When one takes into consideration the fact that they had already
reared numerous young ones at Woburn before they came to us, it will
be seen that, in sharp and refreshing contrast to most rare and beautiful
colour " sports " they are a truly wonderful breeding pair, even judged
by normal standards. Nor is this the only respect in which they are
remarkable, for the attitude of the sexes one to the other is in their case
reversed. Usually, of course, with Ringnecks, it is the hen who " wears
the trousers " and is often very snappy and short-tempered with the
cock, except when she is actually in breeding condition.
With these two, however, the position is exactly the opposite, the
cock being at all times the master and lunging at his wife should she
attempt to sit too close to him, and I have even seen him do this during
the breeding season, though a few moments before he had been feeding
her as she put her head out of the nest-box. It may be remembered
that the late Duke referred to him as a bird of funny and uncertain
temper and thought he might eventually need careful watching with
his newly fledged family, although I must say I have always found him
entirely exemplary in this respect and a model parent in every way.
Altogether he adopts a typically mid-Victorian attitude towards his
wife, but in extenuation it must be said that the number of their
offspring is comparatively quite up to mid-Victorian standards, too !
I only wish the accompanying photograph could be in colour, and
for those who may never have seen a Blue Ringneck I would add that
they are extremely beautiful birds of a soft yet rich shade of powder
blue which, in the cock, is particularly vivid on the crown and fore-
head and which makes a lovely colour contrast to the coral red of
the bill.
While on the subject of Ringnecks, I think a short account of a very
unusual and colourful Ringneck " sport " we have might be of
interest, as it is the only one of its kind I have ever seen. It was
discovered in one of the London bird shops by our General Manager,

Mr, Cummings, and I would call it a pied Ringneck, as its appearance
is somewhat reminiscent of a green and yellow pied or harlequin
Budgerigar.
It is not an easy bird to describe but I hope the following may give,
anyway, a rough idea of its general appearance. It is a cock and is in
every other respect a normal green, except for the large areas of bright
yellow in its plumage and the fact that the two central tail feathers are
particularly blue, being only faintly tinged with green, while the outer
ones are mainly yellow. The usual black and pink neck-rings are
present, as is the area of bluish-mauve at the back of the head, but on
the head itself there is some yellow in the region of the forehead. The
mantle and the flight feathers are pure bright yellow, while the upper
breast is yellow of a rather paler shade merging into green on the lower
breast and belly.
It is a great pity that, with the Ringneck family, the breeding of
colour varieties is such a very long-winded process, but I suppose the
eventual hopes from this bird would be that, about a decade hence,
it might be the ancestor of evenly marked pieds and normal-eyed
yellows--as opposed to pink-eyed lutinos. I only wish the present state
of the world was stable enough to allow one to hope that such long-
term projects had a reasonable prospect of eventual fruition.
Unlike in the days of my youth--planning ahead seems, nowadays,
the essence of folly--nevertheless, I cheerfully go on doing it !

During the past spring and summer the weather can, with justifica-
tion, be blamed for considerable losses amongst our young birds.
Continuous rain and cold in June and July caused havoc, particularly
with the ducklings. One recalls two heart breaking weeks in June when
over a hundred babies were lost from chilling and allied troubles.
Nevertheless, it was a pleasant surprise when figures were assessed at
the end of the season to find that we had had our best breeding season
in the ten years that the Trust has been established. The figures are

sixteen that hatched fifteen were reared, and a further three were
reared from a pair under the care of Mr. Terry Jones, at Leckford.
Cuban Whistling Duck (. Dendrocygna arborea ), Wandering Whistling
Duck ( Dendrocygna arcuata arcuata ), Magpie Goose ( Anseranas semi -
palmata), Bewick's Swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii ), Lesser Scaup
(.Aythya qffinis ), Comb Duck ( Sarkidiornis melanotos) and the South
American Comb Duck ( Sarkidiornis melanotos carunclatus) , Common
Golden-eye (. Buecephala clangula clangula ), Goosander ( Mergus merganser
merganser ), were reared for the first time at Slimbridge, indeed, the last
seven kinds, we believe, for the first time in England.
Some notes on the Bewick's swans have already been given. Of the
rest, by far the most interesting is the breeding of the Magpie Goose.
We have in our collection a pair imported from Sydney in 1949 and an
old female which has been in this country since pre-war days. They are
kept in our Wood pen along with a pair of Black Swans, Whistling
Ducks, and Muscovys. There is a 4 ft. privet hedge bounding the
pen on one side and it was in this that in 1955 a male was found to be
making the rudiments of a nest. The activity was soon abandoned
and when a similar occurrence took place this year we were not unduly
elated. However, some days later the old female joined the male in
building a second nest on the ground, some two or three yards from the
original site, composed of twigs, straw, and nettles, very like that of a
swan in design. In the course of the next four weeks a further five
nests were built in the nettles at the back of the pen and during the
last week the female was seen to be getting very heavy. On 15th August
she was sitting on the latest nest. When approached she emitted a
high-pitched scream and the male came striding to her assistance. Both
birds stood on the nest with tails in the air, heads lowered, and wings
outspread and one could see the first roundish white egg had been laid.
During the next twelve days a further seven eggs were laid. They had
roughish shells and were dead white in colour. The average size being
73 X 5 ^ mm - and weight 115-3 gm. As the eggs were laid they were
replaced by dummies and when the clutch was completed two real
eggs were left in the nest for a few days after incubation commenced.
It was found that both birds shared in the sitting and that the eggs
were never left. The two eggs were removed and added to those that
had been placed under the broody bantam. For the rest of the incuba-
tion period, when the broodies were being fed and exercised, the eggs
were kept warm by use of a spare bantam. An incubation period of
around thirty-five days was expected and it was with some surprise
that we found the first egg chipped after twenty-seven days. Five
goslings hatched on the 28th day, the other three eggs being infertile.
The downy young are striking little things, quite unlike those of any
other of the Anatidae. The head and neck are a cinnamon red,
reminiscent of the male Red-crested Pochard. The body is a dark

grey above, with an absence of barring, and the under parts a pale
grey. The bill, yellow in colour, is large and powerful, the nail being
particularly prominent, and the lores are bare. The toes are very large
in proportion to the rest of the gosling and the yellow tarsus is very
sturdy. These babies were very aggressive to each other and had great
pecking matches as soon as they were able to stand. The diet con-
sisted of soaked biscuit-meal with a 25 per cent protein content,
plentiful supplies of duckweek, chopped plantain, grass, and lettuce.
They were given quantities of fresh-water shrimps and these they pre-
ferred to all else. When food was given to them they would emit a high-
pitched sibilant call, similar to that of passerine nestlings at the
approach of the parent bird. Feathering commenced at twenty-five
days and at the same time the bill began to turn black. The down was
lost completely at six weeks and the adolescent plumage was a black
head and neck, mantle, and upper parts, except for a white rump,
with the under parts and breast shaded from pale grey to white. The
eyes do not as yet give the impression of being so far round on to the
frontal aspect of the head as in the parent birds and one is not conscious
of their use of binocular vision as in the adults. The forehead is not yet
bare and the characteristic bump not yet developed.
A South American Comb Duck bred at New Grounds in 1955
but lost its brood within two days. In 1956 three South American Comb
Duck and one of the Old World race nested. In each case the eggs
were laid in little grape barrels that had been sited some two or three
feet above the ground in willow trees. The incubation period was
thirty-one days for both forms. The creamy white eggs had a thin,
shiny shell and the average size for twenty-five specimens was
57 X 37 mm. and average weight 44 gm.
The ducklings are obviously near relations of the Muscovy as
regards shape and dual colouring of the tarsus. The downy pattern
was cap, back of the neck, and upper parts of the body brown, the
wings and body being barred with yellow. There was a brown eye-
stripe and the throat, breast, and under parts were yellow.
The first hatching did not thrive at all and showed little inclination
to feed. They soon succumbed in the cold, wet weather. The use of
infra-red lamps had a very favourable effect on subsequent broods.
The ducklings showed great interest in life, ate well and, apart from one
or two weaklings, grew rapidly.

(Reprinted, by kind permission, from Stuekultur , March and April nos.,
1956. Translated by Paul Hansen.)
In December, 1951, I bought two Senegal Parrots, which later
turned out to be two cocks ; one died in September, 1953, but the
following day I was lucky enough to be able to buy a female. When
I placed it with the cock they immediately showed great interest,
and were very pleased with each other.
In the summer of 1954 the pair was placed in an outside aviary
with a nest-box, which seemed to interest them but, apparently on
account of too much disturbance from the other birds in the aviary,
they did not show any signs of breeding.
In spring, 1955, we tried again, this time indoors (in my bedroom,
which faces north), in a parrot cage measuring 44 cm. by 44 cm. with
a height of 60 cm., and with a nest-box measuring 25 cm. by 25 cm.
and 35 cm. in height placed outside on the cage, which was put
against a warm chimney. On the 17th March the first egg appeared
and, with a day between each, in all four were laid ; one of them,
however, was destroyed. On the 15th April the first sounds of young
were heard from the nest-box, and examination showed two
youngsters, but one died on the 20th April and the other on the 27th.
In the summer of 1955 I tried again in the garden aviary, also
without any results on account of disturbances. In October, 1955,
the birds again were placed indoors in the parrot cage with the nest-
box on the outside. The birds were mating and were apparently in
very fine condition. The first egg was laid on the 2nd January, 1956,
and three in all appeared.
During the whole period of incubation both the parents spent the
time in the nest, only one at the time coming out for feeding.
The 27th January sounds were heard from two youngsters ; one of
them, however, died on the 2nd February, though the other was
thriving very well.
As soon as the hen left the nest, which at first she only did in order
to relieve herself, the youngster kept up a continual noise until she
came back. During the first four weeks the cock was feeding both
the young and the hen. The young had quite white down.
As rearing food I used sprouted seed in a mixture of sunflower
seed, hemp, canary, white and golden millet, and dry seed in the
same mixture ; in addition, plenty of millet sprays, hard-boiled egg,
and apples. In the bottom of the nest-box was placed 3 cm. of damp
peat-moss.

When the youngster was five weeks old the feathers started to grow,
first on the head, afterwards on the wings and the tail, and lastly on
the body. The eyes were very dark, but at approximately ten weeks
the yellow rings started to show very faintly, but at the time of writing
(April, 1956) are not yet very colourful.
The first feathers were very dull in colour, but when the young
left the nest, at nine weeks old, it was fully feathered and the colours
most beautiful and clear like the colours of the parents. Before it
left the nest the parents had been calling for it for some time, enticing
it to take the great step out in the world, but it never went further
than looking out of the nest-hole, and here it was fed. It was very
early in the morning on the 30th March when it finally came out ;
at first it was very unsteady on the feet, but the unsteadiness very
soon left it altogether. Gradually the hen seemed less and less
interested in the young, leaving the cock to do all the feeding, at
which he was very good. Since ten weeks old it has been feeding for
itself, occasionally still begging a little from the cock.
The youngster, which is a little bigger than its parents, with a
comparatively smaller head and beak, looks very promising, is sound
and in fine condition, and starts every day with a good bath in the
bird-bath attached to the cage. I have had it in my hand a couple
of times ; it is very quiet and does not try to bite.

BREEDING THE CRIMSON-WINGED PARRAKEET
IN CALIFORNIA IN 1956

This lovely Australian psittacine has never been too easy to breed
here in California. The result is that they have always been scarce,
and the breeding records not too numerous.
In recent years the San Diego Zoo has had several successful
breedings, but in private collections the only recent result that comes
to mind is that of G. Rayson Brown's 1955 success with two young
reared.
My own two pairs have had a four-year record of every possible
vagary. They have laid every year, but sometimes they refused to
incubate, other times have laid from the perch, smashed the eggs,
deserted them, etc. It was, therefore, without much optimism that
I greeted the current breeding season.
This season (1956) both pairs appear to have turned over a new
leaf. To be sure both males continued driving and heckling their
mates, but every now and again they would stop long enough to
feed them ! The hens, apparently anxious to justify their long non-

productive sojourn in the collection, responded by beginning actual
nesting operations six weeks earlier than in any former year. By
2nd March both hens had disappeared from sight, and sat very
steadily until 24th March when young could be plainly heard. As
the nest-boxes were placed very high, and a small ladder would have
been needed to make an inspection, none was made. The usual
grandfather-clock nest was used, the bottom being filled with wood
chips and sawdust.
From the time the youngsters hatched until they emerged from the
nest, some five weeks later, the parents were perfect in every way and
gave me no worry whatsoever. Large amounts of food were consumed,
and during the first few weeks I was regularly carrying in three bucket-
fuls of poa annua to each pair daily. In addition, each pair were fed
canned corn that had been washed and rinsed in clear water before
being given to the parents. Of this they were terribly fond, and each
pair ate a small can of it daily. Both males fed their respective hens
assiduously, and after about two weeks the hens began to spend
longer periods away from the young. The males were only very
rarely seen actually to enter the box, and then rather hesitantly.
The first youngster appeared on about the thirty-fifth day and
looked smaller and duller than the mother. The others followed
within a few days, and were active and good flyers from the first.
Some of the youngsters have more red on the wing than others, but
this is apparently not a good or valid indication of sex. One of the
adult hens has much more red on the wing than the other hen.
The male parents have proved to be very tolerant of their off-
spring, and have not driven them about. This is in contrast to some
other species, as the Red-rump for example, which will sometimes
attack the youngsters if a second nest is planned.
The aviary of the first pair was 18 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 9 feet
high. The second pair were in an aviary about 24 feet long, 3 feet
wide, and 9 feet high. Both nest-boxes were hung under shelters,
and were filled with rough wood chips. In addition to the usual dry
seed mixture, seed was thrown on the dirt floors to sprout, and soft
food such as soaked bread, oats, etc., was also provided. Naturally,
large amounts of greens were provided, and fruit, such as orange,
apple, and fresh corn on the cob also provided, and relished.
I am very pleased to report this success, because Crimson-wings
are a little difficult to rear, and it has given me a great deal of pleasure
to be fortunate enough to rear some this year after four years of
negative results.
The first pair reared two, and the second pair reared two more.
Both pairs nested a second time--but one pair deserted their nest
during a heat wave in May. The other pair successfully reared
two more--thus making a total of six reared for the year.

HYLTON BLYTHE-A FEEDING METHOD FOR BREEDING FINCHES 65
A FEEDING METHOD FOR BREEDING FINCHES

By Hylton Blythe (Thorpe Bay, Essex, England)
For some years I have realized that breeding pairs of finches, both
British and foreign need more nutrition than is available in hard seed.
If necessary proteins and vitamins are absent in the spring diet the
eggs will be too poor in quality to sustain life until the chicks can be
fed by the parent birds, resulting in " dead in shell Then, if the
regurgitated food is lacking in essentials, chicks will fade out after a
few days.
In addition to the usual seeds and greenfood a soft food seems to be
the answer and after several years of unscientific experiments starting
from bread-and-milk, I evolved a food last year which proved very
successful.
This formula aims to provide a food which is hygenic and consistent
in quality and supplies high-class protein and the necessary vitamins
A.D.B. Bread rusk is used as being pure and free from mould and
consistent in quality. It is obtainable from the butchers quite cheaply.
Here is the formula :--
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.889684111111111">
1 lb. Bread Rusk.
2 oz. Skimmed Milk Powder.
1 oz. Wheat Germ (Bemax).
1 oz. Bran.
1 oz. Peanut Oil.
1 oz. Cod Liver Oil.
The C.L.O. is mixed with the peanut oil and added to the rusk, well
stirred in, and the other ingredients added. If feeding Softbills add
1 oz. powdered yeast and 2 oz. of good fish meal. Keep in an airtight
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.996252214285714" page_id="56318108"  page_num="65" year="" vol="">
tin and make sufficient for a week or two. Avoid strong smelling oil,
for it will be decomposed and useless, if not actually unhealthy.
This mixture only needs to be moistened with water and allowed to
stand for a few minutes before crumbling. In hot weather add more
water.
Through the years several friends have tried out my experimental
batches and this latest mixture was successfully used with British and
foreign finches. I also found that newly imported foreign finches
greatly benefited by this mixture, feeding in small quantities frequently
to prevent fouling and re-infection where there are large numbers of
birds.
I am sure this food is on the right lines and pass on this information
to breeders. I shall be pleased to have observations and suggestions
for further improvement.

The 46 classes allocated to foreign birds at the National Show
this year were the same number as at the 1956 event. With the
exception of the class "For all seedeaters larger than a Java Sparrow ",
which had no entry, the classes were well filled, and the total entry
was about 600.
Apart from the fact that there were a number of very rare exhibits,
some being shown for the first time in this country, the average quality
of all the birds staged was extremely high. The majority of the placings
for seed-eaters were made by Mrs. E. M. Schenck and Mr. W. A.
Upson, as were those in the classes for Starlings, Mynahs, Toucans,
and Quails. Mr. J. J. Yealland and myself placed the rest of the soft-
bills, also the seed-eater classes for Weavers, Whydahs, Gouldians,
Australian, etc., finches, and other seed-eaters not larger than a Java
Sparrow. Mr. Claude M. Payne made the awards in the sections for
parrot-like, abnormal coloured foreign, and hybrids with one or both
parents foreign.
Mr. R. C. J. Sawyer, with exhibits shown in his usual immaculate
style, won the Ezra Memorial Cup, National Rosette, and Award of
Merit for best foreign bird, Duke of Bedford Trophy and National
Rosettes for best large seed-eater and best insectivorous bird;
Mr. G. M. Baker winning the National Rosette for best lovebird.
" Cage Birds," with Mr. G. E. Weston as Show Manager and
Mr. F. W. Batchelor as Show Organizer, together with their many
helpers, must be complimented on their excellent organization of so
great and important an event as this Exhibition of Cage Birds.
A very fine pair of Gold-breasts belonging to Mrs. P. Henderson
won a large class (25 entries) for Red-eared, Orange-cheeked, and
Golden-breasted Waxbills, etc., followed by C. W. Smith's and
G. E. Whitmore's Fire-finches in 2nd and 3rd places.
St. Helenas and Lavenders were 1st and 2nd for H. Mitchell in
the next class of 18 entries, followed by Mrs. K. M. ScamelPs Cordon-

The two classes for Bengalese were well supported and the majority
of exhibits were of very good quality.
There were four classes for Zebra Finches with from 16 to 27 entries

A pair of Cormorants collected on Lambay Island during 1947,
nested in January on the " cliff" in the Southern Aviary. Two eggs
were laid and one chick, now about ten days old, has been seen.
The Cereopsis Geese that reared two goslings last year nested in
December, but none of the five fertile eggs was hatched. Another
clutch of two is now being incubated.
Birds new to the Collection are a pair of Chinese Crossbills (Loxia
curvirostra albiventris) and a pair of Yellow-bellied Titmice (Parus
venustulus) presented by Dr. K. C. Searle. The Crossbills much
resemble the Common Crossbill--a little smaller, perhaps, but not,
in the present plumage, appreciably whiter on the underparts. The
Titmice are one of the smallest and prettiest species with their glossy

hovering round the bottles containing fruit-fly pupae and catching
the flies as they came out and I doubt whether it would have lived
so long had it not been for the amount of flies that it ate. If only
spiders could be bred as easily as fruit-flies !

world authority on Humming Birds, had come over from Paris
specially to address the Club.
Professor Berlioz gave an absorbingly interesting life history of
various species, and briefly described the best means of keeping them
in captivity. A full account will appear in the next number of the
Magazine.
At the close the Professor received a great ovation. Question
time was unfortunately marred by a dance band in an adjoining

BIRDS OF SAURASHTRA, INDIA. ByR. S. Dharmakumarsinhji,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998657172413793" page_id="56318119"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
F.Z.S., M.B.O.U. Published by R. S. Dharmakumarsinhji at Dil
Bahar, Bhavnagar, Saurashtra, India. 1955. Priced i8j. 6 d.
The author is a well-known ornithologist who first started his interest
in birds while at his preparatory school in England. This book is the
result of more than fifteen years' study of the birds of Saurashtra, the
country lying on the west coast of India between the smaller projection
of Kutch and the straight line of the Gujerat coast. The author states
that most of Saurashtra is hilly, but that there is every variety of terrain,
including desolate salt plains, flat land growing wheat and millet,
open grass, and wooded hills. He adds that many of the birds found in
Saurashtra are also found in Kutch, Gujerat, and South Rajasthan,
so these areas have also been covered in the book and a special supple-
ment has been added of notes on birds so far not recorded in Saurashtra
but found in Kutch and Gujerat.
The first chapter is devoted to sections on migration, local migra-
tions, the study of migration, migration routes, how birds travel, cold
as a factor affecting migratory birds, rain as affecting migration and
breeding, and sudden influxes of birds. The author says that nowhere
does rain play such an important part in local movements of birds as in
India and refers to the hordes of birds he has seen appearing at the
time of the monsoon, which not only brings birds with it, but acts as a
breeding stimulus. Also in the first chapter are sections on bright
plumage and bird song, how to study birds in the field and, finally,
bird areas in Saurashtra. The author considers the Gir Forest and the
Girnar mountain as the best area for resident birds and points out that
though most people know the Gir Forest as the habitat of the Indian
lion, few know it as a bird sanctuary. He also stresses the importance
of the entire Saurashtra coastline and of the Bhal district as the main
migratory routes. In the second and third chapters, on a seaside scene

on a February morning and an April day in the Gir Forest, the author
makes his readers share his obvious pleasure and delight in the scene
by graphic descriptions of the surroundings and the birds.
There then follow full descriptions giving details, identification,
notes, distribution, nesting, and food of 357 species. The author is
a keen falconer and introduces an interesting innovation by trying to
convey, in his notes on the flights of trained falcons, how birds react to
attacks from birds of prey and how they escape. There are 33 colour
plates depicting 282 species by Somalal Shah, 40 black and white
plates from photographs by the author and others, a colour photo-
graph frontispiece by the author, and 16 maps showing distribution and
migration routes of various species. At the beginning of the book is a
detailed map of the area under review and at the end a map showing
the lakes of Saurashtra.

A POPULATION STUDY OF PENGUINS. By L. E. Richdale.
Oxford University Press, London, 1957. Price 42^. net.
The author has made an elaborate study of the Yellow-eyed Penguin,
Megadyptes antipodes , in southern New Zealand, extending over
eighteen years. An earlier monograph dealt with Sexual Behaviour in
Penguins , and the present work is concerned mainly with detailed
observations in various breeding areas within about twenty miles of
Dunedin. Four areas were worked thoroughly each season, and it is
considered that practically all the breeding birds were found each
season, and for some years nearly all resident non-breeding birds.
The data are presented in a series of tables dealing with first the
length of the pair-bond and such factors as divorce, separation, dis-
appearance and death leading to its dissolution. The incubation
period seems to vary not only among individuals but between seasons.
The chick period lasts on the average about 106 days. The amount
of food received by chicks was determined by weighing the chicks
four times a day. An average of 818 grammes of food per day was
given to two chicks in the last eighteen days of the guard stage, but
on one day the total reached 1,418 grammes. The young birds
wandered considerably during the first five years, but then they
became mature and rarely moved to a new breeding place. Out of
411 fledglings which entered the sea, 6 per cent returned to breed in
their place of hatching, 8 per cent to the same area, 9 per cent to
the nearest breeding area, and 7 per cent to a more distant area.

About 52 per cent are estimated to die, leaving a balance of 18 per
cent which may breed in areas to the south of Otago Peninsula.
Survival and mortality factors are given in detail, and the precise
composition of a penguin community. There is also a chapter on the
moulting season including comparisons with other species of penguins.
It was essential for these studies to have some system of marking,
and an aluminium band fixed on the tarsus was the method generally
adopted. The numbers were stamped on the band in four places, so
that whichever way the bird was standing the number could be seen
and read by the aid of a telescope. Footmarking involving the
punching of six holes in the web of each foot proved much more
satisfactory, and according to the author, without it the material for
this monograph would never have been obtained.
Whilst this is primarily a book for the specialist, the detailed study
of such an interesting bird will appeal to a much wider public.

FRENCH MOULT RESEARCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986043333333333" page_id="56318122"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
The National Council of Aviculture is sponsoring a three-year programme of
research into the cause of French Moult in Budgerigars, to be undertaken in the
Department of Agricultural Chemistry in the University of Reading. There is some
evidence that French Moult may, in certain cases, be associated with a quantitative
or qualitative deficiency in the crop-milk fed to the young chicks, and, as part of
this investigation, we are studying the structure, development, and possible endocrine
control of the glands responsible for the production of this secretion.
A condition similar to French Moult has also been observed in some species of
lovebirds and in Red-rumps, and there is good reason to believe that all parrot-like
birds feed their young on crop-milk for at least the first week after hatching. We are
interested, therefore, in studying the structure of the milk-secreting glands in other
psittacine birds as well as in Budgerigars, and if any members of the Avicultural
Society are unfortunate enough to lose any of their birds while incubating or while
feeding young, we should be very glad if they would send the carcases to us, with
the date on which the first egg was laid, the date of death, and whether or not young
had hatched.
It is not known whether the cock produces crop-milk as well as the hen, so birds
of both sexes would be equally welcome. It is important that they should be sent
as soon after death as possible, and if any substantial delay occurs, it would be very
desirable if they were preserved in 5 per cent formalin, or failing this, in 50 per cent
methylated spirits. A small cut should be made in the body wall of the thorax and
abdomen to allow the preservative to enter and, after soaking in the liquid for a few
hours, the bird may be removed and packed in damp paper in a polythene bag for
postage.
The bodies of any young parrot-like birds which die while in the nest would also
be of great value for chemical investigation of their crop-contents.
We are hoping that this investigation will make a real contribution to the knowledge
of the physiology and nutrition of psittacine birds, and any help which members

BREEDING THE BLACK-BREASTED PLOVER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965363166666667" page_id="56318122"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
After reading in the December number of our Magazine Mr. Gerrits very interesting
account of the breeding of the Australian Black-breasted Plover %onifer tricolor ,
I would like to supplement his remarks by saying that after keeping two or three pairs
in the Lilford aviaries for some years, we found them charming subjects to possess and
considerably less difficult to maintain in health than some of the rarer British waders.
Our examples did well when kept in a large pool aviary with other waders. They
partook of the usual waders' mixture and would also eat wheat. I have no reliable
history of the species available, but should imagine they may frequent dry upland
pasture. Mention may be made of this because when purchased I found them in a
London store (Messrs. Chapmans) in excellent condition, but supplied with no other
food except a dish of dry, small, brownish-yellow millet seed. Unsuitable as this
appeared to me they were partaking of it freely and I was assured later that it was
the only food that had accompanied them on the voyage.
As to the breeding of the Black-breasted Plover in confinement I may add that as the
spring approached, paired pairs were better removed to quieter quarters. Therefore our
most promising pair were summered in a small aviary the whole floor space of which
consisted of a well kept miniature lawn 12 feet by 14 feet. Here, as described by
Mr. Gerrits, they made a beautiful rubbing or nest in the short turf and for two seasons
around 1930 reared their young, I believe a two and a three. From memory these
birds were very noisy and demonstrative at the nest but never seemed really to mind
their aviary being entered for supplying food. When the young were newly hatched,
however, it was advisable to note the exact position of each squatting chick before
stepping inside.
My diary of 1930-31 states the young were quite easy to rear.

The Wedge-tailed or Orange-breasted Sunbird was originally
described in 1766 by Linnaeus when he named it Certhia violacea.
It is the only member of its genus and its distribution is confined to
the extreme south-west of Africa.
Stark (j Fauna of South Africa , Birds , vol. 1) says : " The Orange-
breasted Sunbird frequents open uncultivated country, rough hill-
sides, and the slopes and summits of mountain ranges, and especially
where various heaths and proteas abound. It has a considerable
vertical range, from sea-level to a height of 4,000 feet or more, and
being a hardy little bird, seemingly indifferent to cold and wet, it
is quite at home on the bleak and foggy mountains of the coast ranges
in Cape Colony."
Stark goes on to say : " These Sunbirds feed largely on the nectar of
various heaths, occasionally on that of proteas, also on small insects
that frequent these flowers, and on gnats and flies which they dart
upon, like Flycatchers, from a perch to which they constantly return.
Like the Long-tailed Cape Sugar Birds, they breed during the winter
rains, the nests near Cape Town being usually built in June and the
eggs laid in July. This coincides with the flowering season of certain
heaths and proteas on whose nectar they feed their young. On one
occasion I found a nearly completed nest at the end of March. The
nest, oval and domed, with a small side entrance near the top, is built
of small flexible twigs of heath, dry grass, and narrow downy leaves,
thickly lined with the soft white petals of a protea. It is not pendant
like the nests of other Sunbirds, but is attached by its sides to the stalks
in the centre of a thick bush of heath, a foot or eighteen inches off
the ground. The eggs, two in number, are white dotted all over, but
most thickly round the greatest diameter, with small spots and streaks

of greyish brown. They measure 0.65 X 0.48. On one occasion
I noticed a female remove the eggs from a nest from which I had
startled her, and place them under some thick undergrowth a few feet
away. She apparently carried them in her bill. A second brood is
frequently reared in September and October. From December to
March these Sunbirds are generally in small family parties of four or
six, the parents and their young, one of the band being nearly always
a male in full plumage, while one or two are young males showing
varying amounts of metallic plumage."
The flocking habit is interesting : this Sunbird certainly seems
less aggressive than many others. No doubt it would thrive--as indeed
do many of the more tropical ones--far better in an outdoor aviary
than in a cage and would need only a little warmth in the shelter
during winter. I once kept a pair in a large cage under quite cool
conditions and they did well, but then the following summer when
I was away, both escaped and were not heard of again.

BREEDING GOLDEN-MANTLED ROSELLAS
SINGE 1951
By Dieter Overlander (Honnef/Rhein, Germany)

When I write " Golden-mantled " I do not intend to say that my
Rosellas are pure Golden-mantled but they look like them. I believe
that in Germany many, or most, of the birds so called are hybrids,
or youngsters of hybrids, between cecilae and eximius. These " hybrids "
in many cases look like cecilae so far as the colour is concerned, but in
size they seem to favour the larger eximius. But this is only an idea
of mine and not proved.
I hope the reader will not be disappointed that this breeding-
account is not a story of splendid successes.
In 1951 I obtained my first pair of Rosellas, an old cock and a
young hen still in immature plumage. In the middle of April, 1952,
the cock drove the hen through the aviary, but as this aviary is 12 m.
in length he could not harm her. Then I realized that she was too
young and exchanged her for another belonging to my uncle. This
hen after being in the aviary for only eight days was fed by the cock,
and ten days later she laid her first egg. Unfortunately, this first
clutch, five eggs, was destroyed after two youngsters had hatched
because the log fell to the ground. The parents stopped breeding for
six weeks and then they had another clutch of three eggs, which all
hatched and were reared. But misfortune had not ceased as in winter
the old hen escaped. Some months later I was told that she had
been caught, fed on poultry food, and then escaped again.

Li 1953 I obtained another hen from a first nest of 1952. This hen,
though still in immature plumage, had four eggs in one nest, three of
which hatched and were reared. Two other young pairs, two birds
of which had been bred by myself, were doing nothing but feeding
occasionally and inspecting the nests. I suppose it is not so difficult
to breed from young hens as from young males.
In 1954 I had three pairs in full adult plumage and one young pair.
I hoped to realize good results. The old pair had six eggs all of which
hatched. The nestlings did well for a fortnight after emerging from
the shell, then the eldest fell ill. The down was wet and stuck to the
body. Every second or third day I found another dead young one.
I believe they all died from cold and wet weather.
The other pair had a clutch of seven eggs. When laying the fourth
the hen became egg-bound. She had left the nest and sat on the ground.
I took the bird indoors and tried to massage the egg out of the body.
I took her in my left hand and with three fingers of the right hand
I pressed the egg out. But there are two points which must be observed
You must not try to do things too quickly and must watch the bird
and feel or see when the hen herself is straining to get rid of the egg
and just at that moment you must help her. Then sometimes the egg
must be moistened, especially when it is visible. Naturally, this way
of curing is only possible when the bird is in good condition and when
the egg-binding is not caused pathologically. In this way I have
been successful three times. I suppose that the birds got egg-bound
because the temperature had fallen rapidly. I think, however, that
one can very often prevent it by feeding cod-liver oil. Thus in 1954 my
Rosellas had twenty-eight eggs and reared only two young.
I 955 was another poor season. When three young of my old pair
had died I took the remaining two and reared them by hand. They
were fed on milled sunflower seed, oats, and millet. Some greens and
carrots were added and the food was moistened and warmed. The
two youngsters did very well and turned out to be a pair. The male
escaped, when I did not think he was yet able to fly ; but the next
day he returned and I was able to catch him. He is still in my
possession, and when I enter his aviary he takes sunflower seeds from
my hand and sits on my shoulder. Two other young Rosellas I had
taken out of their nest some weeks later. These birds were fed for
some time on hulled millet, used for human consumption. Probably
some vitamins were missing in this food and, though I added greens
and carrots every day, the plumage developed very badly. They
could not fly till they were eight months old.
Last year (April, 1956) there were three pairs of Rosellas on eggs
and I hoped that we would have a good season. But I believe that
this hope is a characteristic feature of every bird-lover all over the
world.

HUMMING BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997753930232558" page_id="56318135"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
By Professor J. Berlioz (Paris, France)
(Address given to the British Aviculturists 5 Club, 13th March, 1957.)
Among the numerous groups of perching birds, the Humming
Birds, which constitute the family Trochilidae, are, with the Trogons,
certainly the best defined and most isolated of all, really showing
no connecting link with any other type. Nothing is known about their
ancestors and even their actual affinities remain quite obscure, although
they are most generally considered by modern systematicians to be
more or less closely allied to the Swifts.
The chief characters are as follows :--
Mostly of very diminutive size (the largest like a Swift, the smallest
like a bumble-bee).
Bill, very thin, elongated, tubular, pointed, either straight or
curved downwards or, sometimes, upwards.
Peculiar tongue, long, protractile, bitubular at the end, and attached
to a curious bony formation encircling the skull, not unlike that of the
Woodpeckers.
Extreme shortness of the wings and legs, more reduced than in
any other type of birds. The wings always have ten primaries, but
not more than five or six secondaries. The feet, also very short, always
have four toes, often with strong claws.
Brilliancy of the plumage, mostly composed of scale-like feathers ;
the tail always composed of ten rectrices, very seldom less. The
shiny appearance of the plumage is due to the physical structure of
the feathers, which produces various shades of iridescent colouring,
unrivalled by other birds, but always devoid of any pigment except
black or rufous. Males and females are sometimes alike, but generally
differ in various ways ; however, sometimes they are quite dissimilar
in pattern and colouring.
They are very active, often aggressive and pugnacious little birds,
fighting among themselves and even attacking much larger and
stronger birds, such as birds of prey and Tyrant-Flycatchers, utilizing
their wonderful power of flight and their very sharp acute bill. They
have but few natural enemies : however, it is said that the smaller
species, when hovering in front of flowers, may be caught and eaten
by aerial predators, such as the Bemtevi Tyrant and even fall victims
of the big American spiders.
Humming Birds are strictly confined to America, but here they are
to be found everywhere where there are flowers. Although much
more numerous in the tropical parts of America, some of them spread,
during the northern summer, as far north as Alaska and Labrador.
Similarly, in the southern hemisphere, one species at least is to be found
during the southern summer as far south as the Strait of Magellan.

The reason why the life of the Humming Birds seems so closely
connected with the existence of flowers is because in flowers they
find both food and drink. It has long been wrongly believed that their
food was essentially composed of the sweet secretions of the flowers ;
but it is now well known that animal food is much more necessary
to them and in fact they feed chiefly on very small insects which are
themselves attracted by the liquids inside the flowers. Humming
Birds are perfectly able, too, to catch the flying insects on the wing,
using their long protractile tongue for this purpose quite as cleverly
as in picking them out from the flowers.
Even in some countries where flowers are scarce, as is the case in
the Juan Fernandez Islands, Humming Birds remain almost strictly
insectivorous. In other very dry parts of the American Pacific Coast,
where there are only few soft insects, Humming Birds may in some
way become more or less frugivorous, feeding mostly on the juice
of damaged cactus fruits, when the latter have been attacked by ants
or other animals.
Considering the wide variation of food these birds may adopt
according to climatic conditions, it is less astonishing to find them so
widely spread everywhere in America, from the low tropical rain-
forests to the highest mountain ranges or in subdesert areas. Owing
to their perpetual need of food they are particularly numerous in
cultivated areas, where gardens and orchards provide all kinds of
flowers and insects nearly the whole year round. For the same reason,
the Humming Birds which nest in temperate countries are migratory
and several species every year make very long voyages, starting from
their breeding grounds in Canada and Alaska and reaching as far
south as Central America and Panama, where they spend the autumn
and winter months.
The peculiar structure of the wings affords the Humming Birds
a most peculiar and unique mode of flight ; it consists in an un-
interrupted sequence of very rapid wing-beats, the speed of which
may attain 50 or more per second for the smaller species. The name
" Humming Birds 55 is actually derived from this flight, which closely
resembles the flight of certain moths and produces similarly charac-
teristic sounds. Another peculiarity of their ability of flight is that they
are the only birds which are able to fly backwards, which they can
do at the same speed and quite as easily as in any other direction.
But, on the other hand, they cannot use their feet for any motion
at all when perching on a branch or sitting on the ground. They
will be seen remaining nearly motionless on the same twig for several
minutes, then they will suddenly fly away at an astonishing speed
and, after acrobatic flights in the air, come back to the same place,
just as flycatchers do.
Nearly all their food is obtained on the wing, both the small insects

captured in the air and the food sucked from the flowers. They
hover rapidly at the same place in front of the flower and push in the
long bill and protractile tongue to reach the nectar and insects inside.
However, on a few occasions, and especially in the case of certain
mountain species which are more sluggish in their habits, they perch
close to the flower, taking their food from the latter just as most of the
Passerine nectarivorous birds do.
Nesting habits : there is still much to be learned about their nesting
habits. Until quite recently it has been accepted as a strict rule that
Humming Birds are polygamous and that both sexes, except for the
short period of mating, live quite independently apart from each other,
even during migration. Their nests are generally most delicate,
though solid, cup-shaped structures, attached to twigs or various
other supports, and the building of which is done by the females alone.
They almost invariably lay two eggs, the latter being uniformly white
and comparatively large for the size of the bird. Females also under-
take alone the entire incubation and the rearing of the chicks. These
remain about twenty-four days in the nest, until their wings are
completely grown, as they are unable to move until they acquire the
same ability of flight as the parents.
However, some very recent observations made in Venezuela seem
to prove that, at least in a few cases, the male does not remain quite
so indifferent to the rearing of the young as is generally believed.
These observations concern a somewhat large and common species of
Humming Bird, Colibri coruscans. The observer (Dr. E. Schafer)
discovered a nest containing one young, newly hatched, and one
egg, to which obviously male and female came alternately both to
incubate the egg and to feed the young bird (although both sexes
of this species are more or less similar in appearance, the male had
an abnormal feather pattern which rendered him unmistakable).
It is impossible to ascertain whether the same habits are to be found
in all individuals of the same species or not. But it may be recalled
that there is a modern theory that among birds in which the two
sexes are similar in appearance, both parents generally assume the
same duties in the rearing of the young. And, on the other hand,
it is a well-known fact now that in many so-called " polygamous 55
birds, individual cases of monogamy may exceptionally occur.
Finally some words may be added concerning Humming Birds in
confinement. At least three conditions are necessary for their good
health and maintenance : space for flying ; insects as their funda-
mental food ; water and moisture for most species.
For more than half a century efforts have been made to keep
these beautiful tiny creatures in confinement. But after many failures
it was not until some thirty years ago that these efforts became really
successful. The long delay involved in bringing them from America

to Europe, the need of fresh food every day, the wrong idea that sweet
liquids constituted their normal diet, have been the chief causes of so
many failures, and, for the few specimens able to reach Europe at
that time, they generally died suddenly after a few weeks at most.
I remember in 1922 visiting one of the first attempts made in Paris
to maintain a small collection of living Humming Birds in Count de
Segur's aviary. Each bird was kept alone in a special cage, and several
times every day was given a few minutes of freedom in a very large
room.
In more recent times great improvement has been achieved both
in transportation and in giving the best conditions of life in con-
finement. There is no doubt that when still more has been learned
about their life in the wild, it will become still less difficult ; but
it is certainly rather unlikely that they will ever become real " pets "
for their owners.

By J- R. van Oosten (San Marino, California, U.S.A.)
(Continued from page 50)
During the month of January, 1956, I was very fortunate in being
able to purchase from Professor Carl Naether a beautiful pair of Black-
chinned Yuhinas in excellent condition. I already had one hen which
had been imported a few years ago from India. In the same ship-
ment I received a Golden-eyed Babbler and the two arrived as good
friends and have remained so. It was a funny sight to see the Yuhina
follow the Babbler, about twice her size, everywhere it went
Never having seen any of these Babblers I was unable to sex mine,
but I am sure that it is a male as it sings all the time. The new pair
of Yuhinas were liberated after four days in a holding cage to allow
the other birds in the aviary to get used to them. My greatest fear
was that the cock might kill the odd hen, but upon being released the
pair paid no heed to her. Therefore I left her in, a thing which I now
very much regret.
Sexing these little birds I find fairly easy as there is a difference of
colour on the breast of the hens. The colour throughout is uniform
in both the male and the female with only that one exception. These
breast feathers are almost a fawn grey, the male's being dark grey.
Also I found that the male is somewhat larger than the two hens. This
I noticed when I bought the pair, but with the three of them it is quite
unmistakable. Both sexes have a little song, but the male's lasts
longer and is uttered more often and is a little deeper in tone. One
of their characteristics is when they are apart they call to each other
in a short one-note call, which increases if something is found ; where-
upon the other one comes at once. They are extremely inquisitive
and spent the first few weeks exploring all the corners of the cc glass
house " and adjoining flight. They also spend a great deal of time
hawking fruit-flies, and with each fly caught one hears the snap
which most Flycatchers make. This sound also reminds one of the
snap which Manakins make. One day while visiting Mr. Isenberg
I heard his Black and White Manakin make the same snapping noise,
but I believe that Manakins make this noise when not hawking-
insects.
In March the pair was observed inspecting the nest-boxes and finally
they settled on a small finch nest-box which had a platform in front.
The materials they used were string, cotton, pieces of burlap, small
twigs, dog hair, with a lining of bird feathers, string, and dog hair.
Being drafted into the military service at the end of March I was
unable to keep any notes of what happened during the following two
months. Upon my return in June I at once noticed that my Yuhinas

now totalled five instead of three. No doubt the success can be once
again attributed to the fruit-flies as there was always an ample supply to
be had. I feel strongly that with cultures of these flies, two or three
to an aviary when young are in the nest, plus a few mealworms, and
where possible other live food, it would not be impossible to rear many
more of the baby softbills to maturity. The young were decidedly on
their own because when they begged their parents for food and none
was offered they flew to the feeding tray and proceeded to eat by
themselves. They ate soaked currants, egg food, apple, grapes, and
drank a little honey-water ; also they were able to hawk flies, so
they were definitely not dependent upon their parents.
I had noticed that since my leaving the male had become somewhat
more aggressive and that should have been the sign for me to remove
the three birds. However, as we often do, I left them in there and the
day before I left to go back to the Navy after a fourteen-day leave
I found three dead Yuhinas on the ground. The old hen was taken
to the taxidermist as were the two young, but I had all the insides
taken to a lab and as luck would have it the young were a male
and female. There is no doubt the male Yuhina killed the other three
but of this I cannot be sure. These graceful little birds are hard to come
by here in the States and the loss was very saddening. If I should lose
one of the pair, especially the hen, it would be a long time before
I could replace it. However, if the success is repeated next year the
young will be separated as soon as they are able to feed by themselves.
The young resembled the parents except for being lighter in colour
throughout the body and their crests were not yet as black. The bill
did not show the colour of the parents. When adult the lower mandible
has a spot of red at the joint where the bill meets the body, their feet
were also not as full of colour. Beyond this they resembled and
possessed all the funny and comical antics and habits which one
associates with this family.
Some other attempts were made but nothing came of them. This
was the first year that I was able to rear any young ones. Softbills are
very funny in this respect as sometimes they breed and other times they
do not even make an honest effort. One pair of Pagoda Mynahs built
a nest, but no eggs were laid and the nest was finally destroyed. A
pair of Red-eared Bulbuls and a pair of Yellow-winged Bulbuls were
seen carrying nesting materials but nothing came of it. All my White-
eyes--two pairs of Indian, one pair of Australian (obtained from
Mr. Isenberg), and a male Australian which mated with a female
Indian---have never shown the slightest interest in breeding or even
building a nest. Mr. Isenberg each year always rears a few and I believe
this may be due to the large clumps of dwarf bamboo which he has
in their aviary. The clump I have is not thick enough so this could
very possibly be the reason why they have not shown the least interest.

J. R. VAN OOSTEN-ADVENTURES WITH SOFTBILLS
The group of birds which fascinates me the most is the Tanager
family. I find these birds full of antics besides being extremely colourful.
I have at the present quite a few of these gems, but in all the time since
beginning with softbills I have run across very few females. These
birds should be easy to breed if one could find the hens. One pair
I obtained a few years ago from Mr. William Krebs were sitting
on a nest of two eggs, but as he did not want to bother with the young
he broke up the nest and I took the birds. Both were in excellent
condition, but after seven days the hen succumbed. For what reason
I was unable to find out as the death report showed no signs of anything
wrong. The pair were the lovely Golden-headed Tanager. The male
passed on about six months ago and I have not been able to find
another. At the same time I had one Yellow-headed Tanager which
looks the exact duplicate of the Golden-headed in body, size, and
distribution of the colours ; the only difference, of course, was that
they were not the same in colour, the former being gold on top and
the sides of the head with a metallic green body and black wings,
back, and tail. The latter's head is yellow, body a metallic sky-blue,
wings, back, and tail black. Another very interesting one is the
Blue-backed Tanager, which closely resembles and is related to
Desmarest's Tanager. The difference is that the rump and front of the
former is a metallic light royal blue instead of green, and the head
is brick-red instead of scarlet. The little yellow band which separates
the red of the head and the green of the back is not very noticeable
in the Blue-backed. Also from Mr. Krebs I obtained a female Blue-
crowned Chlorophonia , otherwise known as the Emerald Tanager. I had
for years been worried about these birds, as I lost over ten after each
had been in my collection for no more than two months. I finally
decided to cut down on the banana and orange and that did the trick.
By doing this I forced them to eat more egg food, which before they
only pecked as if there was nothing else left. Now with the hen,
I purchased from a dealer two young males which were coming into
their adult moult ; both did well and the three were together all the
time. After about two years I found both the males in the pond and
have no idea how they got there. Fortunately I still have the hen and
a male will not be hard to procure. Also I have had pairs of the Violet
Euphonia but was never able to keep them more than a year for the
same reason as the above birds. I also have had females of the Blue,
Copper-headed, Palm, Maroon, Blue-and-Black, Superb, and Pectoral
Euphonia. Three of these I still have left to-day. Last year I was very
lucky in importing eighteen of the beautiful Red-eared Tanagers
from Ecuador. I have eight left after losing two and selling eight.
Mr. Charles Cordier brought thirteen back with him some years ago
and one of these came to the San Diego Zoo. This is where I first saw
the bird and fell in love with it. This year my wish came true and not

only did I get some of these birds but amongst them were three hens.
If I were an artist I would make a plate for the Magazine, as their
beauty can only be appreciated if seen in life ; however, a description
will have to do. To begin with we will imagine that the bird is jet
black ; in size it is just a little bit smaller than the Mountain Tanager.
Just behind the eye is a small crescent-shaped spot of scarlet-red,
from which the bird derives its name ; in the female the shape of
this crescent is smaller and not as bright. Then from just below the
chest in a straight line across, through the belly and rump is the other
area of scarlet-red, which again is several shades lighter in the hens.
The bird also has a spot of blue at the first wing joint which shows
while sitting still, but much better when flying. It is the same metallic
light royal blue which the Mountain Tanager has on its wing ; also
upon close inspection it will be noted that this spot of blue in the hen
is not as large as that of the male. They were very nervous when they
first arrived, but now have settled down and three of them w T ill take
mealworms from the hand. In the same shipment I received another
Tanager which reminds one in size and shape of an Emerald Tanager
only bigger. The colour is a very deep and bright royal blue all over,
with the front, from the neck to the vent, canary yellow ; the wings
and tail have a greenish sheen to them when the bird is sitting in the
sun. I could find no description in Aviculture , Vol. I, to fit the bird,
so I am not able to name it. I sold the bird to Mr. Jerome Buteyn
and the last time I saw it it had fully feathered out and looked beautiful.
I hope in future to have as many of the Tanager family as I can as they
are very interesting and always full of life.
In the same shipment I received five other birds which I can
find no description of in either the back issues of this Magazine
or in Aviculture , Vol. I, or in any of the books which I have seen.
These birds arrived two days before I went back to the Navy and
unfortunately all I have left are the skins. I hope that as soon as I am
back in civilian life I will again be able to procure some more of these
birds.
The first bird was some type of giant Ant-Thrush or Ant-Pitta
which belongs to the New World. Few of these birds have ever been
imported because of the fact that they are hard to trap as well as hard
to see in the jungle. Mr. Cordier imported some a few years ago,
from, I believe, British Guiana, but these were smaller and, I remember,
they were called Helmeted Ant-Thrushes. The bird that I had
resembled in body that of a Pitta, only about three-quarters again
as large, with a little longer tail. The head was similar and the beak
was longer and musty black in colour, the feet were a dull flesh colour.
The eye was light brown with a black iris. The head above the eyes,
back, rump, and upper side of the tail was dark grey-blue ; the chin
to the sides of the neck and three-quarters of an inch below the chin

was a light rusty or copper brown. The rest of the bird--chest, belly,
vent, and underside of the tail--was the fawn colour of a fawn Zebra
Finch. The chest, belly, and vent were also dotted with black spots,
each spot being one-quarter of an inch in diameter and surrounded
by a ring an eighth of an inch wide, of the above-mentioned light
rusty or copper brown. Each dot was roughly half an inch away from
the next. The bird was quite tame, but when food was placed in the
cage it would pounce on it like a dog. It would eat nothing but
canned dog food, mealworms, cut up raw meat, some egg food, and
a few raisins.
The next two birds were the same and in size resembled a Magpie
Tanager, but with a more streamlined body. They looked like a
member of the Tanager family but I could not tell for sure. The beak
and feet were black and the eye was scarlet red with a black iris.
This was the most outstanding feature of the bird. The top of the head
was black with three red feathers which began at the crown and ran
back to the back of the head ; these the bird would raise a half an
inch, along with the black feathers, when it became excited in any
way. The rest of the plumage was a light blue-grey, more blue, which
became almost black on the wings and tail. The birds were not
nervous and they would eat anything put before them. They preferred
soaked currants, egg food, grapes, and milk sop to anything else.
I could not tell if they were young or not, but it seemed that there
should have been a few more red feathers on the head instead of just
the three. I should mention here that all five of these birds arrived in
perfect condition without so much as a spoiled feather.
The last two were members of the Cotinga family, a cock and a hen.
These birds are very rare and not easy to come by, not even in the
jungle. This was my saddest loss, for there will be one chance in a
hundred to replace them. The hen was an evergreen green with
yellow feathers dotted over the lower chest and belly, and her beak
and feet were a yellowish colour. In size she was a little larger than
a Mountain Tanager. About six months before I had seen the same
bird in a shipment which Mr. Ray Thomas received from Colombia
and which now is in Mr. Jean Delacour's collection in Los Angeles.
Upon looking through an old issue of the American Aviculture magazine
I saw a coloured picture of a pair of Swallow Tanagers and the hen
looked exactly like the two birds in every way. However, while visiting
Mr. Delacour one day, and seeing the bird, I was informed that
it was a hen Cotinga of some sort. The bird was in beautiful shape and
seemed to be quite happy in its new surroundings. With this in mind
the next bird which I shall describe could very well have been the male
of the species, for it had all the characteristics of the Cotinga family.
The size and shape of the body was very similar to that of a Naked-
throated Bell Bird, though it was not so large. The beak and feet were

orange, like that of the bill of a Toucan, and the eye was orangeish
with the black iris and a black eye cere. The whole head and neck
were jet black, the back, wings, and upper side of the tail were a dark
evergreen green, while the chest, belly, vent, rump, and under side
of the tail a green colour like the breast of a Blue-throated Barbet,
only a shade lighter. The belly, lower half of the chest, and vent
were dotted with black dots which were surrounded by a very small
ring of white. The dots were about half an inch apart and about three-
eighths of an inch in diameter. The ring was roughly a sixteenth of
an inch wide. Both birds were very quiet and were not easily disturbed
upon someone entering the room ; they only moved to eat, drink,
bathe, and preen themselves. They would take only egg food made
into small balls, a few mealworms, small pieces of cut-up apple, pear,
banana, and tomato, and catoniaster berries and grapes, which they
liked the best.
Another shipment came to me in November, 1955, which contained
three of the very rare and beautiful Apricot Cocks-of-the-Rock. These
birds are larger than the Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock, of which I have a
male, but look the same in all respects except that the scarlet is replaced
by a deep orange. Upon arrival two birds did not look to be in good
shape. I stayed up two nights following, hand-feeding them, but on the
third day one was lost. A week later one was sold after it looked
to be in good condition, but it died within two weeks. The death
report on both these birds showed that they had a disease in the
intestinal tract which they had had for some time. The last one
was liberated after two weeks in the " glass house ", after the Scarlet
had been transferred to the " medium size " aviary, and lived for
another six weeks before it died. The bird was in perfect condition
and seemed to be fine and healthy. As I was away at college I fear
that the bird was not fed correctly, which caused its death. The
death report stated that the lack of food had been the cause, and so,
had the bird been fed correctly, it would have lived.
I have found that importing birds is not as expensive as one might
think. I have also found that by shipping the birds in reinforced
aluminium transport cages one cuts the air freight cost by half;
this is where most of the money goes when importing birds. I also
have the transport cages made collapsible so that I can send them back
to the collector for the next shipment. Being able to import, one is
able to get some of the rarer birds plus the ones you can buy from
your dealer. Of course you are going to have losses, but if the food
and water vessels are hung properly and enough food is provided and
fixed so that it cannot spill on the bottom of the cage, you will eliminate
another cause of death. In this way I have cut my losses down fifty
per cent of what they used to be. I would also like to add that I have
imported the greater part of my collection as it would have been almost

impossible for me to purchase them here in the States. On the whole
the members in England and Europe can obtain foreign softbills
more easily than we can here in the States. No doubt the reason is
that more people are interested in softbills over there than here,
but I, like others, hope that some day people here will take more
of a fancy to them. One reason for this lack of interest may be that
it is imagined the cost of feeding this type of bird is an expensive
affair, but I think that the following might change some minds.
Much has been written by various members of the Society on the
feeding of softbills and therefore I would also like to throw my hat in
the ring. There are many ways of feeding and each person has his
or her own idea on what is the best. I have tried to feed my birds
in such a manner as to keep them in excellent condition and yet not
spend a fortune on them. At present the birds are being fed by our
German cook and I must say she does a better job than I do. As
has already been pointed out the only live food which is given are the
fruit-flies, but during the winter months this is supplemented with
mealworms. Also there are other insects which are available to them
in the green moss around the waterfall, off plants, and from the
ground. I might add that freshly cut grass is always given to them
and they seem to enjoy poring over it in search of all sorts of things.
The mainstay of their feeding is a ready prepared Mockingbird
food which I buy from a dealer. This is made of one-half Spratt's
Mockingbird food and one-half finely ground enriched dog meal ;
to this is added equal amounts of cod liver oil and wheat germ oil
to make it still fairly dry, but so that each ground is well soaked in
oil. Then ten pounds of dried flies are added to a hundred pounds
of mixture. To this I myself add one box of pablum and one of wheat
germ cereal to each ten pounds. This dries it up a bit more and adds
a few more desirable ingredients. This is fed to all the birds and is
also relished by doves, quail, cardinals, and Rainbow Buntings.
The next main item which I have found to be very good, and probably
most responsible for keeping my birds in good health and excellent
condition, is the egg food formula mixture which I have worked out.
It consists of the following :--

After thoroughly mixing all the above together, five grated hard-
boiled eggs are added and mixed thoroughly with the mixture. The
mixture will turn out crumbly in texture and will keep in glass jars
for a week if kept in the ice box. My birds prefer this mixture to any-
thing else I feed and nothing much else is touched until it is all gone.
I feed it in very generous amounts to all my birds. The last two items,
colour food and sea kelp, which contains iodine, are, I think, responsible
for keeping the reds, yellows, and oranges from fading during the
moult. This was especially noted in the Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock,
for after four moults his colour was the same as the day I got him.
Then, while away, my father ran out of both the above and the bird
moulted twice before I could obtain any more. Now that it is back
on the mixture the bird seems to be regaining some of the scarlet and is
redder now than he was last year at this time. The same thing held
true for a male Red-rumped Tanager which never lost any of the brilliant
red colour of his rump after five years in my collection.
Along with the two above items the following things are also fed.
Ajar of peanut butter, two jars each in the two larger aviaries, is kept
in front of them at all times, also a bowl of sunflower seed and raw
peanuts mixed together. Soaked currants and soaked raisins, for
the larger birds, are given fresh daily, as is fruit. The small birds receive
fresh honey-water daily and three times a week five drops of Zyma-
drops and ABCD drops are added. This gives the birds much of the
vitamins and minerals which they do not get otherwise. Twice a week
canned dog food, a brand with no gravy, is given to all the birds.
Milk sop is fed once a week during the hot months and twice a week
during the colder months of the year. It is made in the following

This is then heated until thoroughly mixed, and cooled before being
fed. Every other week they receive a bowl of cottage cheese, of which
they are extremely fond. Occasionally they are also given cooked peas
and diced beet and carrots.
During the various seasons of the year many wild berries are to be
had and a bowl is always kept full in all the aviaries. The rest of their
feeding consists of fruit. Being fortunate in having a little acreage
and a good climate we are able to grow some fruit trees which produce
enough for home consumption as well as for the birds. We have
fig, avacado, persimmon, apricot, orange, plum, peach, and nectarine
trees on the place. Apple, banana, and tomato is purchased the year
around, and pear, grapes, melon, and cantaloup are purchased when
in season. All the fruit is eaten by all the birds, but the inhabitants

of the " glass house " will not touch plums, peaches, nectarines,
melons, or cantaloup. Once a week we purchase two lug crates from
the market of apples, tomatoes, and bananas, and the other fruit
mentioned above when in season. This costs us seventy-five cents a
week. This fruit is not saleable to the public because it is somewhat
damaged but for the birds it is perfect and I have never lost one bird
because of bad fruit. The fruit is kept in a separate ice box in the
garage and stays perfectly good for a week.
This then is the extent of what I feed my birds. I have a little over
200 softbills and the cost of feeding them ranges from ten to fourteen
dollars a month, which I feel is very cheap.
I hope that this article will be of interest to the members and that
more will write on the adventures of their birds. The keeping of birds
is a greatly expanding hobby and pastime and the more interest the
more we can learn. As for myself, as each day passes I find out some-
thing new in the habits of the birds or how better I may take care
of them. It is up to each member to support the Magazine, for I am
sure that each one of us has learned much by reading its pages.

By R. E. B. Brown (Newcastle, N.S.W., Australia)
At the end of the war an absolute ban was imposed by the Veterinary
Authority on the importation of all birds into Australia, for fear of the
introduction of Fowl Pest, or Newcastle Disease. This is said to be
widespread in the world, but has never occurred in Australia. The
ban, coming when it did, at the end of the war, found our aviaries
much depleted with regard to foreign birds as, of course, none had
been imported during the war. Although I am of the opinion that
Australian birds are second to none, both in beauty and interest, it is
sad to be cut off from many old friends among the foreigners.
At the time I had three red Tanagers, a pair of Scarlet (Brazilian),
and a hen Maroon, so I thought I would try to breed a domestic race
of these birds. In this I have had some success. I have now bred
them to seven generations, and have four main kinds, pure Scarlet,
obvious hybrids, Maroon with a dash of Scarlet, and Scarlet with a
dash of Maroon. I have others showing various degrees of mixed
blood. The hybrids are very beautiful birds.
I first paired the Scarlets together, and next summer mated their
son to the hen Maroon. A point of interest is that I successfully
mated him before he came into colour ; he had white patches on his
beak, but was quite brown. The hybrids are fully fertile, and Maroon
is dominant over Scarlet. The Tanagers are all perfectly tame with
people they know, but it is surprising how they can distinguish
strangers.

These birds are kept in open garden aviaries with natural trees
growing in them, and no other shelter is necessary in this climate ;
I have never been able to persuade them to go to nest in anything but
a living natural tree. They will live in small aviaries, but will not
breed, and they do not look well in them, and tend to lose their
bright red colour. The smallest aviary I have ever successfully bred
them in is 18 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet high, with a privet tree
at one end and a shelter at the other. But they do much better in
larger aviaries ; the larger the better. My largest is 25 feet long,
15 feet wide, and 12 feet high. When breeding only one pair of
Tanagers can be kept in an aviary, but they do not interfere with
other birds.
My birds are fed on softbill mixture to which freshly grated hard-
boiled egg is added to the daily ration. Fruit is, of course, essential,
and I always provide banana, apple, pear, and orange, and paw-paw,
grapes, and mangoes, etc., in season. In a country where fruit is hard
to get, banana and one other fruit would be enough, but the birds
should always have green food, grit, and crushed egg shells. They
should also have insects daily. They like white ants themselves, but
will not feed the young on them.
I think I should describe the breeding of these closely related
species together, merely mentioning the differences. They both
build cup-shaped nests of grass, small twigs, teased rope, and cotton
wool. They often place broad leaves on the bottom of the nest. The
Scarlet builds a very strong nest, the Maroon a much weaker one.
I get over this by giving the hen Maroon some cotton wool, noting
where she puts this, and placing a wire gauze shape at the exact spot
where she wants to build. Nearly all hens will go ahead and build
in the wire shape.
The eggs of both species are blue with reddish-brown spots, the
Maroon eggs being smaller ; the Scarlet often lays three eggs, the
Maroon never more than two. Incubation for both is twelve days.
Whilst the young are in the nest live food only is given, and most of
the feeding is done by the hen. The young are coloured like the hens.
They always leave the nest on the twelfth day ; they cannot fly well
at this stage, but are able to hop about in the trees. As soon as they
leave the nest the parents start giving them banana and soft food
as well as the live food.
The live food given should be varied as much as possible, the
parents will not give the young white ants at all, but demand larger
insects. I have on one occasion reared a nest of Scarlets on mealworms
alone, but much better specimens are reared if a variety is given.
Some hens flatly refuse to feed two days running on the same insects,
but simply demand a variety. My old Maroon hen, now 19 years of
age and still breeding, does this. I use mealworms, casemoth grubs,

grasshoppers, mantins, crickets, spiders, and the large green grubs
found on privet trees, and sweet potato vines (the latter must be cut up). i
The green foods most relished are thistle buds and fresh lettuce.
The young are not independent of the parents until three weeks
after leaving the nest ; they must then be caught up or they will
interfere with the next clutch. The Scarlet Tanager cocks come into
full colour when 12 to 15 months old, and the Maroons 10 months
to two years.

BREEDING THE SUPERB PARROT IN
CALIFORNIA
(.Polytelis swainsonii)
By David West (Montebello, Calif, U.S.A.)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984899" page_id="56318149"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
The breeding of three young Superb Parrots in 1955 and three again
in 1956 in California has been something of an avicultural triumph.
Doubtless members in Europe will not feel this is a very accurate and
warranted statement, but it is now some fifteen years since this beautiful
species has been bred in the United States.
Probably I ought to say that the term " Superb " is not very
frequently used in describing Polytelis swainsonii and Barraband's is the
more commonly used name. But I have always felt that the appellation
" Superb 55 is wonderfully accurate for this species. The beauty of
plumage and elegant shape, accompanied by its winning ways, make
it a favourite.
The only other recorded breeding of the Barraband's or Superb
Parrakeet in the United States is the record by Mr. I. D. Putnam, in
San Diego about 1940. The late Mr. Putnam told me that three young
were reared from this breeding. One young from this breeding was a
tame male which Mr. Putnam kept for a pet ; later it passed into the
hands of Mrs. Hubbell, of San Diego, and was the father of the young
hybrid Barraband's x Rock Pebblers she raised a few years ago.
It is odd that this species has proved to be so difficult to breed here
in America. They are easily kept in good health and always appear to
be happy and contented, but somehow they just don't nest. However,
hybrids between male Superbs and female Crimson-wings were reared
on several occasions by the late Dr. Ralph Woods and they were
exceptionally beautiful birds. These hybrids all appeared to have been
sterile when mated back to parents or inter se.
My own pair did not nest in 1952, 1953, or 1954. In each of these
years the pair were obviously in breeding condition and matings and
feedings were observed, but they never settled down to an actual
nesting.
During 1955 and 1956 the male came into breeding condition slightly

ahead of the hen. Male Superbs display spasmodically throughout the
year and their display is not unamusing. Beginning in March, the male
began calling and displaying to a rather bored and uninterested female.
This process continued and late in March the female became more
receptive and interested. Very suddenly, in April, the female allowed
the male to feed her very frequently and invited pairing. Even so, she
had not visited either nest-box and did not seem to approve of either
the grandfather-clock nest or the smaller box. In late April, following
a period of about ten days where pairings took place several times a day,
the female entered the smaller of the two boxes provided and began
nesting. Incubation apparently began with the first egg and from that
time until the young were about two weeks old the hen was observed
only twice. She was a perfect prospective mother and did not leave
the nest when I entered the aviary to replace food, etc.
During the incubation period the male would visit the nest-box and
feed her. At this time the squeaking sound the hen would make when
she was being fed by the male could be heard. The nest-box chosen
was about 18 inches wide, 18 inches deep, and 18 inches tall--and so
it was sufficiently roomy to permit the male to enter and easily feed
the hen without the danger of scattering or breaking the eggs.
The sound of young being fed was heard on the twenty-second day
after incubation started. From about the third day following this the
male began to enter the nest and to (apparently) feed the young as
well as the hen. As Superbs are good-sized birds the male was observed
spending an unusual amount of time eating to provide the necessary
food for the family. Fruit, as apple and orange were appreciated, and
fresh corn on the cob was also devoured. Greens, as poa annua or
grass clippings, and the berries of the pyracantha were also given.
Soaked bread was given in the morning and again in the evening and
seed was scattered on the aviary floor where the earth's dampness
caused some of it to sprout.
The aviary the parents occupied was 17 feet long, 3 feet wide, and
8 feet tall. A shelter at one end was provided for inclement weather--
which we do have in California ! The nest-box was hung at the edge
of the shelter and faced north. Rough wood chips were used as nesting
material. A large stick was placed just below the entrance to the
nesting-box and the male seemed to enjoy sitting on this perch and
talking to his mate inside the nest every now and then. He would
occasionally fly to the box, look inside, and then fly away--satisfied
that all was well.
The youngsters prospered and the mother bird brooded them very
closely for the first two weeks. An observation of the nest revealed
that three of the four eggs had hatched and that the young were
developing nicely. About the end of the third week a second look
revealed that either the mother or the father were picking the feathers

on the back of the babies. Since the guilty parent was unknown and
the picking was not dangerous nothing was done other than to keep
hoping !
About the end of the fifth week the first two youngsters came out of
the nest. They were strong on the wing and quite steady, but looked
very unattractive because their backs were all feather-picked. The
third youngster left the nest three days later and from the very minute
she left the nest the mother began to pick her back so severely that the
youngster would bleed. Neither parent would try to feed the third
youngster once she had left the nest (for it was a young hen) and so this
baby was taken to a friend who very kindly offered to hand-feed it for
a few days until it was on its own.
Eventually all three of the young Barraband's or Superbs were
placed together in an aviary where they have done very well. At this
time (November) they appear to be two cocks and one hen--though
no definite red feathers have come in on the youngsters thought to be
cocks. The feathers on the back have grown in and one could not, at
this time, tell that they had ever been picked.
I should like to add that Mr. G. Rayson Brown was also successful
with this species during 1955 and 1956, rearing four youngsters in
1955 at about the same time my breeding took place and three
youngsters in 1956.
If anyone could throw any light on the reason why the female picked
the youngsters I should appreciate the information so that a recurrence
could be avoided. From past experiences with this type of thing I have
had females pick their youngsters one year and then skip two or three
years. It certainly is an interesting problem and probably not too akin
to the same problem in Budgerigars, because these larger birds do not
over-nest (would that some of them would !).
It is interesting to note that the Barraband's in my collection and
also Mr. Brown's have been old enough to nest for several years, but
not until this year did they attempt to do so. Now one can only hope
that other reluctant species will follow their lead.

By Erica Eisner (Oxford, England)
The Bengalese is well known as one of the hardiest and easiest to
breed of the weaver-finches ( Estrildinae ) commonly kept in captivity.
It is now also showing itself to be an excellent animal for laboratory
study. The most frequent type is a piebald of brown ( c chocolate ')
and white, and fawn and white birds are also common. Pure white
birds have been bred for a long time, but it seems to be more recently
only that 4 self-coloured 5 browns and fawns have been noted.
Judging by advertisements and the statement in a recent book
(Risdon, 1953) that 44 I have never seen or heard of a self-coloured
chocolate or self-coloured fawn ", these seem to be not yet well known.
The classification into piebalds and self-coloureds is in fact quite
arbitrary, for there is an unbroken gradation from birds with no
white feathers through piebalds of different degree to birds with no
coloured feathers. The ancestral bird was surely not a piebald or a
pure white, but a self-coloured bird ; this is not only obvious of
itself, but there is evidence for it. Taka-Tsukasa (1922) quotes a
description of the original Japanese stock, which apparently had no
plain white feathers.
Wild birds with an odd few white feathers are not rare, but it
would seem that natural selection keeps this tendency towards piedness
suppressed, so that the normal type is maintained. A reasonable
explanation for this is that birds showing clear patches of white
feathers are more conspicuous than normals, and therefore more
likely to be killed by predators. In captivity, a bird which had white
feathers would not only not be eliminated, but would probably be
cherished as a rarity and used for selective breeding. According to
Taka-Tsukasa, the white Java Sparrow was produced in Japan from
grey birds with white feathers in their wings. It seems most probable
that the Bengalese was developed similarly.
The genetics of variation in the amount of white shown has not
been worked out in the Bengalese, and as it undoubtedly depends
upon a multiplicity of genes it would probably be extremely difficult
to do so. Such is certainly the case in the mouse. Although that
animal has been the subject of a vast amount of genetical work, it is
only in recent years that much progress has been made in the analysis
of 4 spotting ', i.e. of the variation in the distribution of white areas.
Like that of all products of long-continued selective breeding, as
Griineberg (1952, p. 65) says, the genetics of spotting in the mouse
is very complex. There is little reason to hope that the Bengalese
provides an exception. On the average, the offspring of any pair of
these birds tend to be intermediate in piedness between their parents,

<bodyText confidence="0.999277466666667" page_id="56318153"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
but exceptions to this rule are frequent. I have no experience of pure
white birds, but self-coloureds can be obtained by careful selection
from pairings of birds having few white feathers.
In contrast to the complex problem of the genetics of piedness,
that of the alternative colours is simple. When a bird has coloured
feathers they are either brown or fawn, and these colours are mutually
exclusive. Indeed, it is not only the plumage which shows this, for
fawn-feathered birds have fawn pigment on beak and legs, and newly
hatched chicks which will later grow fawn feathers have fawn coloured
mouth markings and eye-balls, while future browns have the mouth
markings and eye-balls dark. Incidentally, the mouth markings
reflect also, though not so reliably, the future degree of piedness :
self-coloureds have the complete horseshoe pattern characteristic of
the Mannikin group of the Estrildines, but future piebalds have it
disrupted to a degree correlating roughly with the disruption of the
plumage pattern they will later show.
It is altogether evident that the genetic character of c fawn 5 is a
simple Mendelian recessive to that of ' brown '. Two fawn birds
mated together will invariably produce fawn offspring, and no browns.
Two brown birds which are known to have had no fawn birds in
their ancestry will likewise be true breeding, but brown birds can
carry the factor for fawn without its being evident except from the
results of breeding tests. A pure brown mated to a fawn will produce
only brown offspring. If these are then mated to each other, approxi-
mately one quarter of this second generation will be fawn ; if they
are mated to fawn birds about one-half of the offspring will be fawn.
If a pair of brown birds breed occasional fawn young, then they must
both carry the factor for fawn ; if only one of a pair of brown birds
has the fawn factor then that pair will never produce fawn offspring.
Again, it is most probable that some wild birds do carry such recessive
colour factors, but the chances are against their mating with another
bird which also carries it. If this were to happen, the unusual offspring
would probably have a smaller chance of survival than the normal type.
In captivity, however, such recessive characters rapidly become more
common by inbreeding and selection.
My aim in the foregoing genetical discussion has been to clear the
ground for a discussion of the ancestry of the Bengalese, which has
so far constituted a very vexed question. Some accounts (e.g. Risdon,
1953) sa Y that the breed originated in Japan, but more cautious
authorities say only that it has been bred for many years in Japan, or is
often bred in Japan (e.g. Neunzig, 1921). Taka-Tsukasa (1922) gives
the most informative account of the history of the Bengalese. He says
that according to an old Japanese book on cage birds, the original
stock was imported from China " about 200 years ago ". He does not
say whether these were wild birds or an already domesticated stock,

The bird on the left is a perfect self-coloured fawn, while two of the brown birds
may be classed as self-coloured, although they have a few white feathers--the
male of Plate (1) is one of these. Such a simple juvenile plumage is shown by
many mannikins ; the dark upper parts and light belly are differentiated at

but gives a description of the original species and says that the white
and fawn varieties appeared considerably later. It may therefore be
said that the Bengalese breed as we know it to-day originated in
Japan, but from non-Japanese ancestors. The latter part of this
statement is necessary also because no possible ancestral species occurs
wild in Japan.
What, then, was this ancestral stock ? It is quite obvious, and
generally recognized, that the Bengalese resembles the Striated and
Sharp-tailed Finches more than it does any other. However, it is
nowadays quite generally, at least in this country, supposed to be
some kind of hybrid of these types and possibly also the Silverbill ;
no evidence is ever given for this view.
Probably, the present acceptance of this hybrid theory stems from the
preference of Dr. Butler (1894) for it. In the first two decades of this
century, though, this view was frequently contested, and even Butler
himself (1907) decided against a hybrid origin. The Bengalese was
then usually thought to be a domesticated strain of the Sharp-tailed
Finch. For instance, the reviewer writing on p. 112 of the Avicultural
Magazine for 1902--3 says : " Domestication is also responsible for . . .
and white and pied forms (Bengalese) of the Sharp-tailed Finch. We
perfectly agree . . . that there is no reason for supposing the latter
birds to be hybrids." Recently, Steinbacher and Wolters (1956) have
written that it is certainly wrong to suppose that the Silverbill (p. 119)
is an ancestor of the Bengalese which they think is most probably
a domesticated Sharp tail (p. 142), but they do not discuss the matter.
I hope to give convincing evidence that this is the correct view.
Possibly the Silverbill was suggested as a part ancestor in order to
explain the occurrence of fawn individuals, for the Silverbill is fawn
though of rather a different shade. The knowledge that fawn colour
is a mutant inherited in a perfectly normal way makes such an explana-
tion altogether unnecessary, and there is no evidence supporting it.
Indeed, if their statement is well established, Steinbacher and Wolters
give the strongest possible evidence against the view that the Silverbill
is an ancestor of the Bengalese. They state (p. 152) that although the
Bengalese produces fertile hybrids with some Mannikins, hybrids
between the Bengalese and the Silverbill are sterile. However, especi-
ally as elsewhere (p. 119) they suggest that a hybrid between the
Sharp tail and the Silverbill can be fertile, this point should be checked.
The Striated and Sharp-tailed Finches are considered to be members
of the same species, Lonchura striata. (I use the generic name Lonchura
after the most recent revision, that of Delacour (1943), although the
names Munia and Uroloncha are more frequently applied.) The
suggestion that the Bengalese is a hybrid of the Striated and Sharp-
tailed Finches (and these do hybridize freely, according to Hopkinson,
1938) is both unnecessary and contradicted by the evidence. A

detailed account of the species is given by Stuart Baker (1926). There
are two sub-specific groups which are distinguished on various grounds,
the most obvious of which is the occurrence of # lace markings 5 or
squamations on the belly and rump feathers. The one group, native
to Ceylon and India, forms the Striated Finches ; the other, distri-
buted from Nepal and Bengal to Malaya and China, consists of the
Sharp-tailed Finches. My descriptions are based not only on those
given by Stuart Baker and others, but also on my own examination
of the collected skins in the British Museum of Natural History.
In all birds of the species the head, breast, back, wings, and tail are
brown, while the belly and rump are lighter. In the Striated Finches
the brown is very dark, tending to be almost black on the head and
breast ; the belly and rump are almost white and contrast markedly
with the dark regions, especially as they show no squamations. The
tail is not especially pointed, and is rather shorter relative to body
size than in the Sharp-tailed Finches. The Sharptails have much
less contrast between the dark and the light regions than do the
Striated Finches. The brown tends to be of less deep a colour, and of
a rather more reddish shade (this is not altogether clear in Stuart
Baker's description, but is stated clearly by Vaurie (1949) and I have
confirmed it). The appearance is further lightened because the
central shafts of the brown feathers are much more conspicuously
pale than in the Striated Finches, and because the edges of the breast
feathers are outlined in a lighter shade. This last character is not
shown by the Indian and Andaman Striated Finches but is shown by
the Nicobar race. This race does, however, agree in all the other
distinguishing characters, and also its limited distribution makes it
unlikely to be relevant to this argument. The ground colour of the
belly and rump is slightly darker in the Sharptails than in the Striated
Finch; specimens from different regions show squamations to a
varying extent, and where these markings are prominent they give a
grey effect. The tail, as the name implies, is very sharply pointed :
each feather individually is pointed and there is a marked gradation
in length towards the central, longest, feather.
How, then, does the Bengalese compare with these wild birds ?
The easiest comparison to make is between them and a self-coloured
brown Bengalese, and it is immediately obvious that this is quite
different from a Striated Finch, as from all other species, but resembles
some Sharp-tailed Finches greatly. The brown colour is not as dark
as that of the Striated Finches, but has the same tone as that of the
Sharptails ; the belly and rump do not contrast strongly, and bear
squamations. The tail is beautifully pointed. The shafts are prominent
on the brown feathers, and the breast feathers have light edges.
All these characters can also be seen on the brown and white piebalds,
though of course there is no such striking general impression of

similarity. As long as one remembers that the white feathers of the
piebald are superimposed upon the characteristic species plumage
pattern, it is obvious from examination of the feathers that the
Bengalese is a tame Sharp-tailed Finch, and does not have the charac-
teristics of a Striated Finch or any other species.
Unfortunately I have not been able to compare the Bengalese with
living Sharp-tailed Finches, as these are not freely on the market.
Dr. Desmond Morris (unpublished) has compared the behaviour of
the Bengalese with that of the Striated Finch, and with other species
of Mannikin, in detail. He found that the behaviour patterns of the
Bengalese were essentially the same as those of the Striated Finch,
while differing from those of the other species. It is especially note-
worthy that the Bengalese has no behaviour components characteristic
of the Silverbill, whose behaviour is very clearly distinct from that of
the Striated Finch. It is a pity that we do not know how far, if at all,
the behaviour of the Sharp-tailed Finch differs from that of the
Striated Finch ; one would expect that any difference which may
exist would be very slight. Mr. William Bain, vice-chairman of the
National Bengalese Fanciers' Association, wrote to me that " the
Sharp-tailed Mannikin closely resembles the Bengalese in shape, size
and mannerisms ".
I think there can be little doubt that the Bengalese is a domesticated
form of a Sharp-tailed Finch, i.e. that it is a member of the acuticauda
subgroup of Lonchura striata. This view has frequently been expressed
in the past, and I believe the evidence necessitates its acceptance in
place of the theory of hybrid origin. It is less easy to say from where
exactly the ancestral stock must have come. The most comprehensive
account of the L. s. acuticauda group, that of Stuart Baker (1926), is
rather unsatisfactory. This account recognizes three subspecies :
L. s. acuticauda itself from Nepal and Bengal, L. s. subsquamicollis from
Burma, Indo-China, Malaya and Sumatra, and L. s. squamicollis
from China. The distinction depends largely on two characters :
the nature of the light edges to the breast feathers, and the strength
of the markings on the belly feathers. However, as so often happens,
the natural populations do not fall clearly into separate groups, but
instead there seems to be a continuous change between one area and
another ; such continuous change can never be shown by the usual
type of classification.
The majority of the British Museum specimens from the Indian
end of the range are admittedly like Baker's L. s. acuticauda , which is
described as having breast feathers with rufous edges and only faint
squamations. Similarly, birds from peninsular Siam and Malaya
have strong squamations and conspicuous pale edges to the breast
feathers, in accordance with the description of L. s. subsquamicollis.
But birds from areas in between, such as Burma, are quite clearly

intermediate. Baker's description becomes much more seriously
inadequate for birds from regions eastwards of Indo-China, for it
does not suggest that there is a comparable trend of change across
China. The description of L. s. squamicollis applies well to birds from
the West China province of Szechuan. These have very heavily
marked belly feathers and very clearly defined broad pale edges to
the breast feathers, which are of a yet lighter brown than those of the
other sub-species. This characteristic type of breast feather is shown
by all specimens from China but birds from the east coast provinces,
especially Fukien in the south-east, again have less strong squamations.
The belly feathers of these birds are comparable to those of specimens
from lower Burma, but their brown feathers are distinctive in being
considerably paler. Birds from Formosa have even less clear squama-
tions, and also their brown feathers are of a slightly richer tone than
that of the Chinese mainland birds ; this has previously been pointed
out by La Touche (1925), and Oberholser (1926) has even created
a subspecies for the Formosan type of Sharp tail. The Formosan
specimens are in fact extremely similar to birds from Nepal, the only
reasonably apparent difference being in their having slightly more
conspicuous pale edges on the breast feathers.

The Bengalese clearly does not resemble the birds from the central
part of the Sharp-tailed Finch's range, for it never has such strong
squamations. The common name of e Bengalese Finch ' might be
considered as circumstantial evidence of origin from the Bengal area,
but this would be extremely unreliable. The name c Bengali ' was
originally applied to the Cordon-bleu from Africa and may have
been a corruption of Benguela. It was later used indiscriminately
in the bird trade for many of the weaver-finches, and was then
restricted to the Pied Mannikin as a result of Dr. Butler's influence
(Flower, 1906). It would be interesting to know what the Japanese
vernacular name for this bird signifies. It seems much more likely
that the ancestral stock came from South-East China and/or Formosa.
Taka-Tsukasa says that the original Japanese stock came from China
and that the feathers of the abdomen were " white with pale, dusky
streaks ". Amongst my own stock of Bengalese, comprising over a
hundred birds, the intensity of these streaks is rather variable, but
seems to be usually less strong than that of the Fukien specimens
while stronger than that of specimens from Formosa, to which that
province is nearest. Specimens from other parts of China, whether
from the Shanghai region further north along the coast or westwards,
all have too strong markings. As the breast feathers of the Bengalese
are clearly of the Chinese type, with conspicuous pale edges and of a
rather pale brown, I think it must be concluded that the ancestors of
the Bengalese most probably came from this South-East China region.
In summary, the Bengalese is a domesticated form of Sharp-tailed
Finch which was developed in Japan from stock probably originating
in South-East China or Formosa. There is no reason whatsoever to
suppose that it is a hybrid of the Sharp-tailed Finch with any other
bird.

A White-necked Picathartes has been received from Sierra Leone
as a present from Mr. J. I. Menzies who hand-reared the bird from a
nestling. He fed it on small frogs, lizards, mealworms, grasshoppers,
insectile food, and minced lean meat. It is now living with the one
collected by the first " Zoo Quest " in 1954, and is, of course, only the
second living specimen to be brought from Africa. Like the first
specimen, this young bird has several filoplumes on the top of the other-
wise bald head. The Grey-necked Picathartes brought by Mr. Webb
from British Cameroon during 1948 continues to thrive.
Other gifts are a Citril Finch from Mr. W. Schenck, two White-
throated and one Red-throated Humming Birds from Mr. Randau,
an Indian Broad-billed Roller and a Loo Choo, or Lidth's Jay from
Messrs. Brooke Bond and Co., a Fohkien Grey-headed Crow-Tit from
Mr. G. H. Newmark and a small number of various insectivorous
Indian birds, of which a Black-naped Oriole is the most noteworthy,
from Mr. C. E. Engledew.
A fine Masai Ostrich has been received in exchange from the
Bristol Zoo and a Pileated Kingfisher has been deposited.
The Cormorant hatched on about the 20th of February is now fully
grown and flying. A second nest has been built and probably contains
eggs. A Gannet's egg is being incubated in the same aviary.
Three Black-footed Penguins, five blue-bred green Masked Lovebirds,
and two Cockatiels have been bred. Four Swinhoe's Pheasant chicks
have been hatched and are being reared by the parents which success-
fully reared two last year. It is a pity that this handsome pheasant is

not more widely kept, for, like the Mikado, it is found only on Formosa
and may be in danger of extinction there.
Great Eagle-Owl, Spotted Eagle-Owl, Maned Goose, and Impeyan
Pheasant are the most noteworthy of the birds now incubating eggs.
The " Homing " Budgerigars are, of course, breeding, not all of them
in the boxes provided, for several pairs are nesting in the trees about
the Gardens and in Regent's Park.
The Reeves deposited by the Norfolk Naturalists' Trust last autumn
have now been sent to the Cley marshes.

Mrs. Rosemary Upton showed slides to illustrate " Some Shetland
Birds ". But let it not be supposed that this was just another talk on
the Islands' birds, illustrated by the inevitable series of slides of little
interest to anyone other than the photographer.
Mrs. Upton revisited the Shetlands in May-June, 1955, with the
express purpose of photographing the Whimbrel and its nest. In this
she succeeded admirably, and procured a fine series of photographs
of a pair of nesting birds and a complete record of the hatching of
four chicks. The time from when the first egg starred to that of the
last chick leaving the nest was 46 hours--no less than 32 of which
Mrs. Upton spent in observation. We were also shown excellent
pictures of the Great Skua and its nest, Arctic Skua, Dunlin, Red-
throated Diver, and others. Enjoyable though the pictures were, the

Frank A. Hartman, of the Ohio State University, writes : "I kept
a pair of Sparrow Hawks in a cage in the laboratory for more than
ten years. The female laid eggs and incubated them, but they never
hatched because apparently they were not fertile. These birds were
taken from the nest and kept in a flight-cage throughout life."

Mrs. Jean Warner, Ibadan, Western Nigeria, writes concerning
Red-faced Lovebirds : "You say the flight-feathers of imported birds
are invariably ruthlessly cut, but this is also true when one purchases
birds from itinerant Hausa traders. In some cases too, the banded
tail-feathers are extracted and used as a juju (native charm), and the
same applies to the red tail-feathers of the Grey Parrot."

G. A. Gjessing, Drammen, Norway, reports an interesting event.
In January his Rock Pebblers started to lay on the ground of the
flight. The egg was put in a box on the ground and three further
eggs were added to it. On the 10th February the first of three chicks
was hatched, and all three, possibly one male and two females, are
now fully independent. The temperature during this time was down
to 20 0 F. in the heated shelter and about o* F. outside.

edition revised and enlarged. Angus and Robertson, London,
1956. Price 25L net.
As the author states in the preface, this is not intended as a text-
book of Australian birds, but its purpose is to present a factual, gossipy
account of the " Believe-it-or-not " features of Australia's remarkable
bird life. The book is divided into two sections--Biographical and
General--and in the first part all the outstanding groups of Australian
birds have been dealt with. Aviculturists will find much of interest
concerning the habits in the wild of the birds they have known only
in captivity, and many will wish that the chapter " The Land of
Parrots " had been longer. Though admittedly a popular book, it
contains a wealth of information, and many problems are explained
in a clear and concise manner. To quote the titles of some of the
chapters in the second section--" Good neighbours--sometimes
(a study of the relations of birds and man in Australia) " ; " Queer
relations of birds and insects " ; " Carrying the baby in birdland "--
give some idea of the diversity of aspects of bird life the author deals
with. The final chapter, " To settle an argument," is devoted to

drawings by Shirley Bell. Published by the Oxford University
Press. London, 1956. Price 35^. net.
This small handbook contains descriptions and illustrations of just
over a hundred of the 650 or more birds native to Australia. As the j
author states in his introduction, the book is designed to help people
in the more closely settled parts of Australia to recognize birds they
may see at home in the garden or during a day's outing. In each
species the range and salient points of its appearance on a brief view
is given, and followed by more detailed description and an account,
in somewhat picturesque language, of habits, behaviour nest, etc.
The illustrations have been executed with the aim of giving an impres-
sion which will help in quick identification. Some are good but others
are out of drawing. Eleven species of the Parrot family have been
included, but the illustrations of some of these are not very happy.

Song of Violet-eared Waxbill
I feel I owe an apology to the charming little Violet-eared Waxbill for saying in
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.8370513125" page_id="56318167"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
my book, Foreign Bird Keeping, that it has nothing much in the way of a song. When
I wrote this I had not kept the species since before the war, and I still cannot remember
that the male of a pair in breeding condition we then had was much of a songster--
but it is a long time ago ; I should say about 1935.
Now, however, we have a pair that have just gone to nest, and the exquisite beauty
of the cock is quite matched by the beauty of his song.
When one thinks of small foreign seed-eating songsters one's thoughts naturally
turn to members of the Serin family and chiefly perhaps to the well-known Green
and Grey Singing Finches--both delightful songsters--particularly the latter.
Waxbills, on the other hand, are ,not remarkable for their song, so it is all the
more unexpected that the Violet-eared should have such a fine one. Its song, though
perhaps rather more varied, is remarkably like that of the Skylark, and if it had the
same astonishing volume in relation to the bird's size as is the case with the Grey
Singing Finch, I have little doubt that it would be acknowledged as one of the finest
songsters of all the small seed-eaters.

During jrd-gth September, 1956, eleven healthy Ostriches were
hatched at the Basel Zoo after an incubation period of 47-53 days.
The clutch of sixteen eggs was incubated by the parent birds them-
selves. Seven eggs were placed in an incubator after 38, and the
remaining eggs after 48, days of incubation, because of the cold and
rainy weather. Four eggs did not hatch. They proved to be infertile or
contained dead embryos. One Ostrich hatched under the parents was
found dead in the nest. The newly hatched chicks were placed in a
modified poultry house which serves mainly for raising birds. It has
a wooden floor, big windows to the south, and access to a lawn. The
floor was covered with sand and the room was heated by infra-red
lamps to a temperature of 25*-30* C. At the beginning the tempera-
ture was never allowed to fall below 20* C. The little birds soon
seemed to find places under the lamps where they felt comfortable.
They were left without food for about two days, then dishes were put
before them containing chopped fresh alfalfa, carrots, leaves of
dandelion and, at times, lettuce. In addition, they were given a
pelleted all-mash mixture designed for pullets, containing about
14 per cent of crude protein, Spratt's Weetmeet, some hard-boiled egg,
and crushed Ostrich-eggshell. From the beginning the green stuff,
especially alfalfa, was much liked but the pellets, too, were accepted
in increasing quantities and we feel that we owe much of our success
to this well-balanced diet. Water was offered about twice daily and the
birds took to it most of the time, but we do not think that it is essential.
At first the birds seemed quite avid for their own droppings but this
habit was soon lost. Anyone who has tried raising Ostriches knows how
much devotion and skill it takes to induce these birds to eat sufficient

quantities of food. When left alone they will walk about, peck now and
then at conspicuous objects, and finally die of starvation. In captivity !
someone has to take the place of a parent bird, not only during the first
days but for a number of weeks, and knock at the dish or the floor !
where the food is placed, or move the food in the dish or let it drop in
front of the birds, etc. It will pay to take this trouble. Of course, it is I
easier to raise a whole flock, but even so the mutual stimulation does
not seem to suffice. I often put this sentence in my notes : " Now it
seems that the birds will soon settle by themselves "--but invariably it
proved necessary or at least advantageous to keep them company. By |
touching the bellies it was possible to find out if they were duly filled.
It seems to be advisable to keep them company up to the age of about
three to four months.
Our birds developed nicely and never caused much worry. On sunny
days they were allowed to exercise freely in the open, which stimulated
their appetite and made them less excitable. Furthermore, plenty of
exercise seems desirable for sound development. On the lawn the birds
revealed their herbivorous nature by pulling out and eating grass,
denuding whole areas of growth down to the ground. Eating, sleeping,
and preening were performed at regular periods. Feeding was most
intensive during the two to three hours before sunset and stimulating
the birds during this time of the day is considered most effective. In
other words : the opportunity of obtaining full bellies in the evening
should not be missed.
One of the birds was lost at the age of about three weeks. It had not
eaten for about two days and the dissection revealed its intestines
heavily filled with small pebbles. We do not know, however, if this
was the actual cause of death.
When the birds were about two months of age the pellets could be
offered dry in a separate dish and a calculated dose of a calcium-
phosphorus-vitamin-D-preparation was given in addition. At that age
the daily allowance per bird was about i kg. of chopped vegetables
(mostly alfalfa) and about half a pound of pellets and Spratt's Weet-
meet. The daily exercise on the lawn was never discontinued, in spite
of the increasingly cooler weather and occasional fall of rain and snow.
Cold alone did not seem to hurt the birds when they were exposed, as
long as they kept moving. The birds obviously enjoyed these outings,
mostly indulging in lively dances. Room temperature often fell
below 20* C.
As the birds grew bigger enormous quantities of food were eaten.
In December cabbage was introduced in place of alfalfa, which was not
available any more, and the pellets were given as the only concentrate.
Consumption then amounted to about i kg. of concentrate and at least
twice that amount of vegetables per bird per day.
Dancing was often performed in the stable, too, which occasionally

caused skin lesions and bruises on the birds and broken windows in the
building. The windows consequently had to be screened by wire
netting. We did not worry about the birds' injuries at first, taking them
as a sign of health and vigour, but after a while it became necessary to
move the birds to larger quarters. In February the Antelope House
became the new home of the birds, which had almost attained the
height of a man. After a few days of excitement and decreased food
consumption the Ostriches settled down nicely. Soon the appetite
was regained and in March the daily consumption of each bird had
risen to 2 kg. of pellets and about 7 kg. of vegetables. They continue
to develop into splendid specimens, pleasing their keepers by their
tame and mannerly conduct.

ON THE DISPLAY AND BREEDING OF THE KING
BIRD OF PARADISE, CICINNURUS REGIUS REX
(SCOP.) IN CAPTIVITY

By Sten Bergman (Ronninge, per Stockholm, Sweden)
Reprinted by kind permission from NOVA GUINEA. New Ser., Vol. 7 ? Part 2,
20th November, 1956.
The King Bird of Paradise, Cicinnurus regius (Linnaeus), is certainly
one of the most magnificent birds of the world. The vermilion colouring
of the head and upper parts of the body, shimmering with every move-
ment, is of a supreme beauty. Even more remarkable are the adorn-
ments with which the male bird is furnished : the two superbly
sweeping tail wires, each tipped with a gleaming, spirally curved disc.
In addition, there are the brown, fan-like side-plumes bordered with
emerald green, which lie folded under each wing and can be spread
out at will.
Although the King Bird of Paradise was given its name by Linnaeus
in 1758, its life and habits in the tropical jungle are still very little
known. When Hartert, in 1910, wrote an article about those Birds of
Paradise whose eggs were at that time known (Novitates Zoologies, 17 :
484-490), he expressed his surprise that nobody had succeeded in
finding the nest of Cicinnurus , since in certain parts of its range in New
Guinea and on a few neighbouring islands the bird is not, after all,
so rare.
At the end of March, 1929, however, Wilfred Frost discovered the
first and, as far as I know, hitherto only known nest. This find revealed
the quite unexpected fact that the King Bird was a hole-breeder in
contrast to all other species of Birds of Paradise, which have open
nests. The nest found by Frost was built in a small tree, about 7 feet
from the ground. He describes the nest as follows : " The nest hole

was small, about i J inches in diameter, and approximately 18 inches
deep, but filled to within a few inches of the lip with palm fibre. The-
eggs, two in number, measuring 27*5 X 21 mm., were of a creamy
white, flushed with pink, typically marked and curiously resembling,
except for size, those of Paradisaa apodaP (.Avicultural Magazine (4), 8 :
33-5.193*-) _
The first live Birds of Paradise which came to Europe--two Para-
disaa minor --were brought home in 1862 by Alfred Russel Wallace
and placed in the London Zoo, where a number of different species
have since been kept, as in many other Zoological Gardens.
Up to the present, no Bird of Paradise has been bred in Europe,
although some instances of egg-laying have occurred. As far as I know,
the only species which has ever successfully bred in captivity before
1956 is " Empress of Germany's Bird of Paradise " ( Paradisaa apoda
augustcevictorice Cabanis), of which in 1942 one young was reared in
Prince Dharmakumarsinhji's aviarium in Bhavnagar, India oologica ,
New York, 28 : 139-144, 1943). In the Zoo of Surabaia, on Java,
a King Bird of Paradise, according to Frost, laid two eggs which were
hatched out, but the young died in the nest. The same female later
laid one more egg but failed to incubate it (. Avicultural Magazine (4), 8 :
33-5, 1930). This, as far as I know, is the only attempt made by a
King Bird to breed in captivity before 1956.
When returning to Sweden from two journeys to Dutch New Guinea,
in 1948-49 and 1952-53 for ornithological research, I was permitted
by the Dutch authorities to bring to Sweden a number of live Birds of
Paradise for the purpose of continuing my studies and observations on
these birds and, if possible, to make breeding experiments with them.
For my first permit I am much indebted to my colleague of the 1948-49
expedition, Dr. M. A. Lieftinck, then Director of the Zoological
Museum in Bogor, Java. For my second permit I have to thank
H.E. the Governor of Dutch New Guinea, Dr. J. van Baal, the former
resident of West New Guinea, Mr. L. L. A. Maurenbrecher, and
Professor Dr. L. F. de Beaufort.
Among my Birds of Paradise were some male King Birds, Cicinnurus
regius rex (Scopoli). I did not, however, succeed in bringing home
any female of this species, but through the courtesy of Director
S. van Reesema and Ir. F. J. Appelman, of the Rotterdam Zoo,
I was permitted to exchange one male Cicinnurus for a female of the
same species.
In October, 1955, this female was joined with a male that had just
changed its plumage and the pair was allotted a space of 17J m 3
in my house. The room was planted with a number of Monster a, Ficus ,
Bougainvillea , and other tropical plants. The floor was covered partly
with sand and partly with moss. The room had a constant temperature
of 25 0 C., regulated by thermostat, and the necessary moisture was

effected by squirting all plants and the moss with water every day.
Two sides of the room were lighted by two double windows on each
side and two electric tube lights were burning in the King Bird's room
for twelve hours a day--from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.--all the year round.
As nesting sites a vertical log and two nest-boxes were installed. All
the three nesting sites had different-sized entrance holes.
Shortly after the male bird had been let into the female's room, in
which she had spent over three months waiting for him to finish his
moult, he started his courting. He knew her well, since their rooms
had been separated only by wire mesh.
He began his courtship by raising his tail and tail wires forward until
they lay at right-angles to the length of the body. He then spread out
his wings so that they were slightly cupped, as shown in Plate 4.
Turning towards the female, he constantly vibrated his wings, which
were soon spread out to their full length.
Suddenly he changed his display completely. Instead of sitting on
the branch the next instant he was hanging upside-down with his feet
clinging to it. His wings were still fully expanded and vibrating. The
bill was open, so that the yellow-green gape was plainly visible.
After hanging in this manner for nearly ten seconds he closed his
wings and, still in a hanging position, swung his body from left to right
for a few seconds. He then released his hold, dropped a short distance,
and flew on to the branch.
Some days later, at 11 a.m., the male bird was singing. The song is
somewhat similar to the song of the skylark, although not so loud.
When the male bird sings, the discs of the tail wires are in constant
motion. Whilst he was singing the female flew over and sat on a
branch near to him.
He then expanded his wings and vibrated them. He moved closer
to her and sat on the same branch. Then he began displaying in the
usual manner, i.e. he expanded the fans and drew them up towards
his head, as shown in Plates 2 and 3. At the same time he puffed out
the white feathers of the underside, so as to become almost spherical,
sweeping his tail wires up over his back as illustrated by the photographs
just mentioned. His head was raised obliquely upwards and constantly
swayed slightly from side to side.
During this display the male sat with his back turned towards the
female. She moved nearer to him, so that she was at a distance of
approximately 5 cm. from him. While he was displaying she
occasionally picked at his feathers.
All through the winter the male was observed displaying for the
female almost every day and sometimes several times a day. The most
usual time for the display was in the morning hours between 8 and 1 o
and in the afternoons from 3 to 4. This applies to the winter months.
During the summer months the birds were not excluded from the

Swedish summer daylight, which during the lightest period, in June,
lasts for approximately twenty-one hours out of the twenty-four, in
the Stockholm area.
In their native country Birds of Paradise are used to approximately |
a twelve-hour day and a twelve-hour night. During the winter months ;
in Sweden, where, in the Stockholm area, there is only about six and a
half hours' daylight at the darkest period, the birds were, as already
mentioned, exposed to twelve hours of artificial light. I have never
noticed that they suffered any inconvenience from the long daylight in
summer. As a compensation, they took one or several naps during the 1
day. During the summer, also, the display-times have been assigned to
the same time as in the winter, but the variations in regard to the time
have been greater.
The most frequent way of display of the King Bird is illustrated on
Plates 2 and 3 ; in exceptional cases it continued for two minutes, but
usually it was considerably shorter. When the male is really in the
mood for display he repeats his performance many times and it may be
observed at any time of the day, or in the evening.
When the display has continued for a while in the normal manner,
with outspread fans and upbent tail wires, often the male will suddenly
turn round and continue the performance in the opposite direction.
Usually he alters his display after this complete turn, so that the fans
are drawn in under the wings and the bird, with wide-open beak,
sways his tail from side to side in the manner shown in Plate 1.
A departure from this attitude is that the fans remain expanded while
the tail wires are swayed from side to side. The body remains stationary
during this display.
Since 10th October, when male and female were placed together,
I have seen the inverted display many times during the course of the
winter and spring. Members of my family have also sometimes seen
this display on other occasions and, without doubt, the male often
performed his inverted display when he was not under observation.
The first part of the upside-down exhibit usually continues for five to
ten seconds and the second phase, when he hangs with closed wings
and sways from side to side, takes a similar amount of time. But on one
occasion he hung with closed wings, completely motionless, for almost
one minute. The various forms of display which I have observed agree
in all essentials with those described by Ingram for a bird kept in
captivity (The Ibis (9), 2 : 223-9, 1907).
During the course of the spring the female began to show increasing
interest in one of the nest-boxes, the one with the largest entrance hole
(diameter 8-5 cm.). In the middle of December, 1955, she had been
observed for the first time to sit in the entrance hole and look in and
a few days later she went inside. During the four following months she
made short, sporadic visits to the nest-box. In May, 1956, however, she

flew in almost every day, and sometimes she would stay in the nest-box
for half an hour to a few hours. I provided the nest-box with moss,
dried fern leaves, and very thin grass so as to imitate a kind of nest.
Moreover I put fern leaves and dried grass into the birdroom. The
female accepted this nest but completed it with the finest grass straws
she could find in the aviary.
In connection with her growing interest in the nest, the male became
more ardent in his courtship. On the 24th May the male chased the
female from branch to branch. She moved slowly out of his way. Now
and then she stopped and for the first time I saw her sitting in mating
position with her body lowered against the branch and her tail raised.
Her head was pointed in an upward direction in exactly the same
manner as the male's during the normal display. But when the male
came near she flew away again. This happened several times. As soon
as the male saw her take up this position he immediately flew to her,
but she continued to avoid him. Consequently no mating took place.
After the male had been pursuing the female for some time he
displayed in inverted position, but even this acrobatic performance did
not lead to any mating.
On nth June the female was in the nest-box the whole morning.
When I left home at 10 a.m. to drive 30 km. into Stockholm she was
still inside the nest-box. The male displayed outside the nest-box in the
morning, although the female could not see the performance. At noon
my wife telephoned me to say that there was an egg in the nest-box.
When I returned in the afternoon the female had come out and was
eating. I then went in and looked into the nest-box, which was so
constructed that part of the front could be swung open by means of
a hinge.
The egg was exceptionally large in comparison with the bird and
proved to be a typical Bird of Paradise egg : cream-coloured, with
numerous chocolate-brown streaks on the large end. The female
protested strongly when I approached the nest and she continued to
express her discontent all the time that I was inside her room. She
flew right up to me at the nest to see what I was doing.
Since there had been no egg in the nest the previous evening and as
the female had not spent the night in the nest-box, the egg must have
been laid either in the early morning or forenoon of 1 ith June. As the
female was in the nest-box all through the day of the 11 th, except when
eating outside, the incubation must have started as soon as the egg was
laid. The following day I did not see her when she came out to eat and,
as I naturally did not want to drive her out of the nest-box to see if she
had laid another egg, it was not until the 13th June that I was able to
ascertain that two eggs were present in the nest.
During the incubation the male bird sat almost continuously on a
branch close beside the nest-box. He would occasionally stretch his

head to have a look, but he was never seen to enter the nest-box. He
therefore never relieved the female during the incubation, neither did
he give her food during this period.
On the other hand, he displayed diligently for her in the neighbour-
hood of the nest, partly in the usual manner, with expanded fans and
tail-wires erected over his back, and partly, on many occasions, in the \
inverted position. He also repeatedly sat on a branch in front of the
nest-box and vibrated with expanded wings directly outside the
entrance hole, so that the female could not avoid seeing his courting.
On numerous occasions he sang his bubbling song right outside the
nest-box while the female was incubating. When she came out to eat
or to take a bath, he took the opportunity to look at the eggs and, later,
at the nestlings, through the entrance hole.
As part of my preparations for eventual breeding I had placed a
bowl of finely crushed shells in the King Bird's room. Before laying her
eggs, I had often seen the female eating these shells, but during the
incubation period I never saw her swallow any pieces of shell when she
came out to eat. After the eggs were hatched and the young birds were
in urgent need of calcium for bone-formation, she ate the shells several
times a day.
During the incubation period the female came out three or four
times a day to eat. As a general rule, she also took a bath once a day
and preened her feathers very carefully. The length of her visits to the
feeding place varied from a few to forty-three minutes, which was the
longest absence from the eggs that I observed. On that occasion the
female, after she had fed, had a thorough bath and then preened her
feathers for such a long time that both the male bird and I began to be
nervous about the eggs. All the time the male sat beside the nest-box
and repeatedly uttered his call of enticement : a-a-a-a-a (pronounced
as in English) when she seemed in no hurry to return to the eggs.
I had not seen the birds mate, and I dared not take the eggs out of the
nest to see if they were fertile. It was therefore with eager expectation
that I waited to see if there would be any results at the time I had
estimated.
On the morning of 28th June, after seventeen days, the eggs were still
unhatched. At 3 p.m., when she came out to feed, I again inspected
the nest-box and to my great joy found a newly-hatched, dark red little
thing and one egg in the nest. The egg-shell was not in the nest but was
found at the other end of the aviary.
I immediately went out to find fresh " ants' eggs " (more properly
the pupae of ants enclosed in their cocoons), which are the finest food
one can give to an insect-eating bird. In an ant-heap about 10 km.
from my house I succeeded in obtaining a good portion, which the
female readily consumed.
At 7 o'clock the following morning I looked into the nest-box and

found that the other egg also had hatched. It was evident, therefore,
that the second egg was laid one day later than the first.
When the female returned to the nest-box, after I had visited it,
I could see through the large entrance-hole that she regurgitated food
from her crop to feed her young. During the whole feeding period she
fed her young in this manner.
Apart from fresh ants' pupae the family were given the following
food : chopped yolk of hard-boiled egg, fresh raw meat in very small
pieces, finely-chopped apple, boiled rice and finely-chopped tomato,
soaked raisins, small mealworms, small live grasshoppers, and fresh
whortleberries.
The fact that the eggs were hatched during the summer considerably
facilitated the feeding problem. I was able to obtain fresh ants' pupae,
live grasshoppers, and fresh whortleberries. Six months before the
breeding I started to give both birds daily a portion of thawed deep-
frozen ant pupae.
When supplied with food the young emitted a suppressed, feeble,
peeping sound, rather like small mice. The nestlings had smooth,
naked bodies and were blind. All the young birds' droppings were
swallowed by the mother. When the delicate young birds would not
open their beaks she touched their heads very carefully with her bill.
On the fifth day I saw the young open their eyes for the first time.
Their gapes then were vivid yellow. When they were a week old
I happened to open the front of the nest-box and swung it to one side.
After a moment's hesitation the female fed her young just the same.
Each young bird was usually given three to four regurgitated portions
at one time.
Every day I released a number of small grasshoppers in the King
Bird's room. The female caught them and, after she had pulled off
their legs and swallowed them, regurgitated them to feed her young.
When the young ones were eight and nine days old respectively, she
would feed them while sitting in the entrance hole, stretching towards
them and the young towards her.
It was evident that the female selected the food offered to her young.
Once I watched her standing beside the young and regurgitating the
contents of her crop when a whortleberry appeared. She re-swallowed
this and regurgitated a mealworm instead. This she placed well
forward in her beak and stuffed it into the gape of one of the young.
Thereafter she regurgitated again, brought up a whortleberry,
re-swallowed it, and instead regurgitated another mealworm, which
she gave to the other nestling.
Since the young birds' droppings never showed any trace of blue
colouring, it is obvious that the female did not feed them with whortle-
berries, though she ate these berries herself several times a day.
When the young birds were twelve days old nearly all their feathers

were still in their quills, which were bluish grey in colour, though one
or two wing feathers had begun to sprout and these were brown.
When not asleep or feeding the young birds spent nearly all their time
preening their sprouting feathers.
At the age of fourteen days all feathers, both on the upper and under-
side, had sprouted. During this latter time the female had fed her
young almost exclusively on grasshoppers. When the young were
fourteen days old I saw, for the first time, the female emerging from
the entrance hole with the nestlings' droppings in her beak. She then
dropped them on the ground instead of swallowing them, as she had
always done previously.
Between their twelfth and fourteenth day the young birds developed
so quickly that one could scarcely recognize them. At the fourteenth
day the whole of their upper side was brown with more red-brown on
the wings. The underside was grey-brown with dark cross-bars. The
legs and feet were blue, but duller in colour than those of the parents.
They could now sit like proper birds, preening themselves incessantly,
or stretching their legs and wings and fluttering comfortably.
When, having taken some photographs of the young in the open
next-box, I had reclosed it and had been absent for a while, I found on
my return that one of them was sitting in the entrance-hole. Shortly
afterwards it flew out and sat on a branch close by. I picked up the
young bird and held it in my hand for a while. The female flew round
about and warned very loudly and incessantly. She crept with
expanded wings and tail along the ground and among the branches
and leaves round me. When I moved the fledgeling from one hand to
the other, the mother alighted on my head and pecked my crown with
her beak, beating me also with her wings. The bird was very excited,
but the male merely sat calmly at a distance and looked on. He has
never been observed feeding the young ones, either in the nest-box, or
outside it.
The following morning both fledgelings were out and were regularly
fed by the mother, as they sat on different branches. As the young were
hatched on the 28th and 29th June, the eldest one had flown out on
12th July and the other on 13th July, they thus had left the nest at the
fourteenth day. In the jungle they would undoubtedly have remained
longer in the nest and this would have happened here also had they not
been disturbed by being photographed, when the front of the nest-box
had been opened.
Despite their youth, the young birds were quite sure holding on to
their branches and flying to the branch for which they were aiming,
although they could only fly in a straight direction, as their tail-feathers
were only half a centimetre long. On the fifteenth day they could
already sit on one leg and scratch their heads. Sometimes one of them
would bend forward, turning round the branch and come up on the

other side without releasing its hold, an art with which all my full-
grown Birds of Paradise are experts. All of them also are capable of
doing both forward and backward somersaults on their branch.
The female, after having fed the young in the nest, always waited for
their droppings ; but she changed her behaviour after they had left the
nest and spent the day in the open. When she had finished feeding her
young she had the amusing habit of bending her head inquisitively
under the tail of one of them and then sitting motionless waiting for the
droppings, but always in vain !
When the young were fifteen and sixteen days old, I saw them fight
each other for the first time, which also happened the next day and on
several later occasions. They would peck at each other with flapping
wings like small cockerels. Sometimes they would swing round the
branch until one of them would force the other to loose his footing and
flutter down.
Every evening towards dusk the young birds began to grow restless,
flying from branch to branch and from one end of the aviary to the
other. It was obviously an expression of anxiety which so many birds
feel in the evening, when it is time to seek a resting place for the night.
At this time they uttered a cry which may be transcribed as tjao-tjao.
A couple of weeks later they produced a flutelike complaining whistle,
often uttered twice, and which later could be heard at any time of the
day. When the young birds were fifty days old I heard them for the
first time give their warning cry, which was reminiscent of the parents',
although it was not so harsh.
At the twenty-fifth day the young birds' appearance may be
described as follows : beak, dark horn-coloured, lighter at the base.
Iris, grey-brown. Upper parts of the head, brown tinged with russet.
The back, grey-brown. The wings, grey-brown like the tail ; the wing
feathers decidedly darker brown. The greater wing-coverts and outer
webs of the primaries red-brown. The underside, light grey with dark
cross-bars, curved on either half of the underside. Closer dark cross-
bars on the under tail-coverts. A light bar immediately above the eyes,
and over this a dark spot. The chin, grey-brownish yellow with small
descending streaks and points. The gape vivid yellow. The inner
anterior part of the lower mandible and its borders, yellowish-green,
as also the upper mandible. The legs and feet were blue, paler than
the female's.
At the twenty-fifth day the young birds' tail feathers were approxi-
mately 3 cm. long. At this age they were fed every day with whortle-
berries, which, as mentioned before, were never given to them when
still in the nest. Grasshoppers now formed a very substantial part of
their diet.
At the age of one month the young birds' tail feathers were nearly as
long as the female's. The young ones were much lighter on the under-

side than the female. The mother still fed them and when they begged
for food they uttered feeble cheeps whilst fluttering their wings.
The male's moult began by casting one of his tail-wires on 18th June
and the other on 19th June, while the female was incubating. The
female started her moult on 10th August, when the young were forty-
one and forty-two days old.
When the young birds were nearly two months old they changed all
their feathers on the sides and top of the head, and the entire back
acquired a pure grey colour. They had also grown new feathers on the
under parts, where the dark cross-bars, especially on the flanks, were
strongly marked. These bars were broader than in the female, which
was generally browner on the under parts than the young ones. The
greater wing-coverts, the primary coverts, and the outer webs of the
primaries were vivid red-brown.
As I write these words the young birds are three months old. Like
their parents they are both in splendid condition. They feed them-
selves with all the food they get, but the female gives them a titbit now
and then.
The male has now almost completed his moult and is extremely
elegant. It is only the tail-wires which have not yet reached their full
length. The fans are not yet full grown either. Feeling that he has
regained his splendour he has started to sing and display. The female
has completed her moult of all the feathers on the neck and head, and
has also grown new feathers on the underside.
It now remains to be seen whether my King Birds will repeat their
breeding.
As far as I know this has been the first successful attempt at breeding
that has ever occurred with a Cicinnurus held in captivity.

(Corythornis cristata)
By J. M. Spence (Port Elizabeth Museum, South Africa)
A nest containing five young Malachite-crested Kingfishers was
found near Port Elizabeth on 19th January. It was about 10 feet up
in a river bank, and had a tunnel about 12 inches deep, the actual nest
cavity was about six inches in diameter and extremely foul smelling.
The young were estimated to be about three weeks old. They were
covered with feather sheaths, some of which were already splitting to
reveal the blue feathers on the back. A week later all the sheaths had
vanished and the birds were fully fledged. Their droppings were
very liquid and quickly absorbed in sand. When first taken from the
nest the young would defecate in all directions, and if the droppings
happened to fall on the feather sheaths they would just run off, thereby
keeping them quite clean. As they grew older the chicks would
back away from the others and deposit the droppings well away
from them.
Three of the young were taken and hand-reared ; they thrived
on strips of fish as well as ten to fifteen small whole fish per bird per
day. When fed whole fish they would throw up a cast of the scales
and bones.
For the two days after they were feathered the young birds made
no attempt to fly, then on the morning of the 28th they jumped one
by one to the edge of their box and flew strongly around the room.
Needless to say, they were immediately caged. The next day they
started to take an interest in any food that accidentally fell to the
floor while they were being fed, but made no attempt to pick it up.
The following morning a dish containing some small live fish in
shallow water was placed in their cage. Although obviously interested,
they made no attempt to catch any until the 31st. Next day
they were taking live and strips of fish. I found that raw fish is
rather inclined to come to pieces in water, so strips of donkey heart
were tried ; this proved very successful, and they took to it without
any trouble. They were not hand-fed after they were five weeks old.
They are great bathers, and if not given a dish of clean water each
day they use the feeding dish to wash in. Their quaint habit of
bobbing their heads up and down was obvious from the day they could
fly, but they very seldom raise their crests.
They have two methods of " catching " their food, one by diving
either from a perch or hovering above the food or else, by alighting
on the edge of the dish and pecking the strips of food out. These are
usually thoroughly " killed 55 before eating by being beaten on a
perch. If the food is small fish they are always swallowed head first.

26 O. HIRTHE-FIRST BREEDING IN CAPTIVITY OF SEVERE MACAW
Although they are not as brightly coloured as the adult, they are
nevertheless very beautiful, having the area between the eye and lores
a light buff. The cheeks and breast are dark grey-brown, with the
throat and crown as in the adult. The abdomen is a lighter colour
orange than the flanks and shoulders. The rump and upper tail-
coverts are bright metallic blue, while the mantle and back are bright
metallic greenish-blue. The primaries are black, and the secondaries
and coverts dark blue with bright turquoise spots. The feet and legs
are orange underneath and grey above, while the beak is black with
a white tip.
As you can imagine, they are very interesting and beautiful little
birds, and make a wonderful addition to our fast-growing collection
of live birds.

FIRST BREEDING IN CAPTIVITY OF THE
SEVERE MACAW
(Ara sever a (Linnaeus))
By Otto Hirtfie (Copenhagen)
(&apos;Translated from the Danish by C. af Enehjelm)
In 1953 I bought a nice pair of Severe Macaws from the animal

dealer C. H. Krag, of this town. The birds were almost identical, only
the red colour on the forehead of the bird believed to be the cock was
somewhat more pronounced. The birds seemed very attached to each
other, so I thought they must be a true pair. I put them in a compart-
ment of my largest aviary. This consists of a long brick building,
60 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 8 feet high. The house is divided into
eighteen compartments, each approximately 3 feet by 5 feet, with a
3 feet passageway running along the back of the house. Each com-
partment has an outside flight, approximately 3J feet wide, 20 feet
long, and 7 feet high. One box was hung in the shelter and another
in the outside flight. The boxes were made of 1J inch boards, approxi-
mately 1 foot by 1 foot and 2J feet high. On the bottom of the boxes
I placed a layer of moist earth, and on the top of this a layer of peat-
moss, about 6 inches deep in all. Neither of the boxes was used for
sleeping. In spite of the very cold winter, 1953-54, the birds spent
all day in the flight, even the cold nights did not seem to hurt them
in any way.
The food consisted of sunflower seed, various millets, peanuts, and
groats. They also got all kinds of sweet fruit, apples, oranges, grapes,
etc. Strangely enough the birds did not seem to appreciate bananas.
Raw carrot was given freely, and should, in my experience, always
be fed to nesting parrots and parrakeets. Also sprouted oats and

sprouted spray millet were given daily. The birds did not take ordinary
green food, as usually given, with the exception of the yellow dandelion
blossoms, which they took readily, but not the ripe heads. The
Macaws seemed to thrive excellently on this food, and at the end of
May, 1954, I thought that the birds would start nesting, as they
seemed to be interested in the nest-box. Things, however, went
differently. I give fresh branches in the flight, and every time I bring
new branches, the Macaws first bite off all the leaves, then the twigs,
and finally, gnaw off the bark. Macaws should always have fresh
branches for gnawing. This does them a lot of good and keeps them
occupied.
At the beginning of August the birds started to feed each other,
and I also saw a single attempt at mating. It really was a true pair.
On the 6th August the hen disappeared into the box in the outside
flight and the cock spent most of his time in the neighbourhood of
the box. He also visited the hen several times a day and slept in the
box every night during the period of incubation. A nest inspection
was very difficult, as I was usually attacked by the birds. On the
19th of August I took a thin lath and gently pushed away the
birds from the centre of the nest, and an egg was visible on the bottom
of the box. When checking again on the 24th of August, I saw three
eggs, and these comprised the whole clutch. Apparently the eggs were
laid every other day. I did not inspect the nest again until the 12th of
September, when I saw a young bird, which seemed to be newly hatched.
Three days later, when checking the nest, I found another young one
lying dead, apparently crushed under the mother. The third egg was
infertile, and was removed. The remaining young one throve
excellently. Besides the ordinary food, I gave eggfood (hard-boiled
egg with biscuit), and boiled rice with milk and sweetened with sugar
and different sweet jams--this food, by the way, also being given at
intervals all the year round. The youngster left the nest on the
28th October, beautifully feathered, and was greeted by the parents
with loud cries. A little later the young bird flew with the parents
through the long flight, the parents taking good care of it. The bird
appears to be a cock, the red patch on the forehead being as big as that
of the old cock. It is delightfully tame, and takes food from my hand.
The incubation period of the Severe Macaw is obviously 25-28
days, and the young birds leave the nest when about 7 weeks old. They
are fed by their parents for quite a long time, but are independent
about six weeks after leaving the nest.
In 1955 another young bird was bred, and in 1956 three. These
were exhibited at the large bird show at Copenhagen in November,
and were awarded the # Sluis 5 cup for meritorious breeding.

(.Lagonosticta rubricata)
By C. J. O. Harrison (Tooting, London, England)
These notes are an addition to the previous article (Avicultural
Magazine, vol. 62, 1956, p. 128), and complete the study on those
Fire Finches commonly available to aviculturists in this country.
Appearance
The Dark Fire Finch (. Lagonosticta rubricata) is also known as the
Blue-billed Fire Finch, though this name is usually applied to the
West African subspecies, which is the one most frequently imported,
and the one on which these observations were made.
The cock is dark, perhaps dull, scarlet on the head, breast, and belly,
and the mantle is a dark slate-grey. In this subspecies the dark grey
extends on to the nape and crown, but in others the head may be
entirely red. The wings are a similar colour to the mantle, but perhaps
a little browner. The rump is scarlet, as is the base of the black tail,
while the under tail-coverts are black. There is a faint white rim to
the eye, and the bill is steel-blue. The hen is pinker than the cock
on head and breast with a small area of buff on the belly. The general
shape is that of a small squat bird with a narrow head and prominent
bill.
This species is unfortunately being widely sold and exhibited as
another species--Jameson's Fire Finch (L. jamesoni). At one time
the two were considered to be related subspecies, but they are now
separated. Jameson's Fire Finch is pinker on the head, light red on
the breast, and brown on the back : but the principal distinguishing
feature is the shape of the second primary feather. The first primary in
both species is vestigial, and what appears to be the first is in reality
the second. In Jameson's Fire Finch this latter feather tapers a little
towards the tip, but in the case of the Dark Fire Finch it is cut away
on the inner web towards the tip, so that the feather narrows suddenly
and the terminal portion is very slender. This feature is constant in
the different sexes and plumages.
General Behaviour
It is a rather nervous and furtive bird, resembling the Bar-breasted
Fire Finch (L. rufopicta ) in its habits. Like that species it has a crouching
posture. If alarmed it tends to hide, and if free in a room will disappear
into the darkest corner or under furniture, and remain still and silent.
I found that it quickly learnt to find its way around a room. Even
before a nest had been made it showed preference for roosting in

a box. In spite of its furtive manner I found it an aggressive species.
When two cocks were put together one would chase the other con-
tinually, one of the birds (I am not sure which) uttering a low, soft
" tuc " note. When I put one with Senegal Fire Finches (L, senegala)
and Lavender Finches (L. caerulescens ) it dominated both.
Call-note
The call-note is low-pitched, nasal, and slightly harsh--" kyew "
or " kyah ". It has a wide range of expression, from a soft, subdued
note used between a pair when feeding or on the move, to a loud,
harsh version used in periods of excitement or isolation.
Alarm-note
This differs in form from that used by the Senegal and Bar-breasted
Fire Finches. It is abrupt, similar to theirs, but higher in pitch,
and is repeated in a rapid series that run together to form a single
rattling trill. The pitch is variable, becoming higher as anxiety
increases. It is accompanied by a crouching posture similar to that
of the Bar-breasted but with the head raised on a rather thin neck.
The tail is held to one side, half-spread and jerked sideways at each
call.
Song
The dangers of generalizations based on a study of too few specimens
were brought home to me with this species, for the first cock that
I possessed had a song which consisted merely of a long-drawn toneless
trill on a single flat note. It was only with subsequent birds that
I heard the more normal song. The cock of a nesting pair did not sing
when the hen was on the nest, but used instead, low-intensity alarm-
notes together with a more melodious form of the call-note.
When the hen died the cock began to sing immediately and per-
sistently. The song was melodious though generally high-pitched,
surprisingly loud, and consisted of short phrases frequently repeated.
During one period I timed it and found that it consisted of phrases
I i~ 2 i seconds long, uttered at intervals of 5-6 seconds. In volume
and pitch it reminded me of a Robin's song, but the style was mock-
Nightingale. A typical phrase would consist of the rapid repetition
of a note, seven or eight times ; but there were frequent changes of
pitch between phrases, suggestions of crescendo and diminuendo, and
sometimes a short descending cadence. Once or twice I did hear a
short trill reminiscent of the first cock's song.
Nest-call
This was heard frequently during, and just after, nest-building.
It was a faint persistent clucking note repeated with great rapidity.

C. J. O. HARRISON-NOTES ON THE DARK FIRE FINCH
I was not able to compare it directly, but would have said that it
was lower in pitch than the Senegal Fire Finch's call, which is in
turn lower than the Bar-breasted's.
Display
This is similar to the display of the Bar-breasted Fire Finch. The
cock holds a piece of grass or a feather by its tip. It stretches very
straight upright with head thrown back and head and neck feathers
sleeked down, while the belly feathers are a little fluffed and the tail
half-spread. The movement consists, as in the other Fire Finches,
of a series of vigorous upward jerks, usually in repeated sets of four
bobs. At each jerk there is an upward movement of the bill and in
many, possibly all, cases the head is turned alternately half to one
side and then the other, so that the grass or feather appears to be
waved jerkily from side to side while the bird is bobbing up and down.
There does not appear to be any special movement at the completion
of the display. I did not notice any specialized flight of the cock
while carrying display material.
Unmated cocks showed what I took to be an undirected display
homologous with the " stip " display in the Senegal Fire Finch.
In it the bird had a rather tense posture, upright, with head raised.
It continually repeated a single note which I called a " squelch "
note since it reminded me most of the sound when air is squeezed out
of a wet rubber sponge with a rush of tiny bubbles, and was also
reminiscent of the " fwit " of a thin twig swished through the air.
Each note was accompanied by an upward movement of the bill, and
terminated in a subdued click.
I was surprised that it did not appear at the end of the display of
the paired cock. When the hen died the cock began to intersperse
its song with periodic repetitions of the note. Finally, about two weeks
after the hen's death, it picked up a grass-stem and indulged in a
momentary display during which I was able to detect that the note
occurred, with the lifting of the grass-stem to one side or the other, at
each upward jerk of the bird ; but it was normally masked in my
cages by the heavy thud of the bird's feet on the perch as it bounced
up and down.
Other postures
When the pair were first put together there was a certain amount
of what appeared to be aggressive behaviour. I thought for a few
days that I might have two cocks. Both birds would take up similar
postures side by side, with neck stretched straight upwards, head
thrown back and bill raised, while the tail was cocked and half-
spread. In this position they would pivot from side to side, the bill-
tips occasionally touching as though one bird was parrying the thrust

of the other. This occurred not only in the pair-formation period,
but also in the early stages of nest-building.
Nesting
Within a few days of being placed together a pair built a nest
in a cardboard box that had been put up for that purpose. The
nest was of coarse grass and leaves, and lined with feathers and fibre.
As in the other Fire Finches the cock brought all the material and
built the outer, rough shape of the nest, while the hen lined the nest
with material brought by the cock. In this case the hen began to
assist before the outer shape was complete.
Postscript
These notes complete my observations on Fire Finches to date.
It will be seen that they are, with the exception of the Lavender
Finch, very similar species, with distinct differences of song and
slighter variations of display and calls that serve to illustrate both
their relationship and the differences which enable them to preserve
their specific identity.
If it should be asked why they appear in these pages I would plead
that it is only through a knowledge of a bird's life and behaviour
that we can understand how best to keep it, and that it is only through
aviculture that it has been possible for the observations to be made.
Detailed studies on these species in their natural habitat are still
lacking, and I hope that these notes will be of some value to future
students.

Of my birds, I think a pair of Indian Zosterops has given me as
great pleasure as any. This, I say, even though I have an Indian
Shama who on many a warm night has charmed the silence with
notes that would intrigue a Nightingale.
The Zosterops arrived in the late spring and were liberated into
an aviary considered suitable to their needs. Luckily the weather held
fine for a considerable time and they did not appear to find the
English climate anything unusual. In Northern India, the sun deals
sunstroke by day, and it can be cold to freezing at night.
The aviary, 15 feet long by 4 feet wide and 8 feet high, was built
against a very old brick wall. This was riddled with crevices and holes
made by the hand-cut nails of former generations. They formed ideal

hide-outs for spiders and other insects. The wall faced south, and the
aviary was also protected from east and west winds. An apple tree
sapling, self-sown, grew tight to the bricks. It's branches radiated,
and pressing hard against the wire roof, formed a canopy of leaves
which effectively kept out rain.
For those who have not seen a Zosterops, let me say that they are
small, short-tailed, insectivorous birds, about the size of an English
Wren. Their colour is a warm grey-green with a grey-white stomach,
which merges into yellowish-green on the breast and lemon-yellow
under the beak. The eyes are their most arresting feature. These are
bordered with white rims, which have earned them the name of
Spectacled Zosterops. Knowing nothing of the nesting habits of these j
active little birds, I gave them soft, dry meadow-grass and hay.
In due course they became interested, and wove the hay into a rough
bundle between the fork at the end of a horizontal branch about
six feet above ground.
Adjoining this aviary was another, but of larger proportions, being
40 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 12 feet high. It contained some Chinquis
Pheasants, a pair of Senegal Touracous, a few parrakeets, and also
a pair of Zebra Finches. At the partition top, a strip of wire allowed
the inmates to look into the Zosterops' aviary. The Zebra Finches j
appeared to be fascinated by the " goings on " of the Zosterops,
and were desperately anxious to get a closer view of the nest. At
last they discovered that a heaven-sent mouse had enlarged a hole,
where the wire adjoined the wall, and through this they squeezed.
I don't know what goes on in the minds of birds, but these Zebras
had fully made up theirs long before they passed the wire netting.
In no time they had that bundle of hay torn to shreds, and were
preening themselves on a good day's work. You could almost hear
them say " Good-bye to all that " ! Later, finding seed only in a trap
cage, they were soon caught and transferred elsewhere.
It so happened that two little French poodles were being clipped
for show at that time. I threw a couple of handfuls of their brown
curly hair into the aviary. With evident delight, the Zosterops seized
upon it, and set to work to create a masterpiece of construction.
Choosing as before the flat fork at the end of a branch about 3 feet
above ground, they tightly wove a small, deep cup as neat as their
first effort had been ragged. It was interesting to note that this time
the nest was not visible from the next-door aviary. It hung under the
fork and was bound to it by two hinges, each about an inch long. Some
small feathers were used for lining, and two diminutive, blue-
green eggs were laid. These could be seen with the aid of a cane
through the wire, to which was attached a small looking-glass.
The little hen sat deep in her cradle, showing only the tip of her
beak and tail, while one beady eye, made very visible by its white

j spectacled rim, missed nothing that passed. She had the delightful
habit of pulling a solitary large white feather over her back when
the weather was cold. I do not know exactly how long the incubation
took, as she sat close and gave little or no chance of looking into her
nest. However, in a seemingly very short time, about a fortnight,
she was off hunting for insects.
Two children gathered ant-eggs from under the stones which
bordered the paths of the garden, and swept the hay-fields with
butterfly nets, catching quantities of flies, etc., from the grass tops.
At first the two babies looked like black spiders at the bottom of the
nest. They grew fast, and no parents could have been more zealous
in caring for their wants. Eventually they left the nest as two grey-
green balls of fluff, and were coaxed by their parents to the top of the
apple tree and on to the sleeping perch. With the two chicks between
them, they made a charming picture. Later on they placed one baby
between them--the other had to take an outside seat. Somehow
I think that the favoured infant was the hen. It appeared to be
smaller.
When the youngsters had grown to full size, and were able to fend
for themselves, the parents decided to build a new nest, and pulled
the old one to pieces. The cock, however, apparently also decided that
he could not tolerate another of his own sex in the aviary, and unseen
by anybody, he slew his son, reducing his pretty young head to a
raw skull. His daughter continued to live and sleep between the
parents as before.
Unhappily the weather changed, and they apparently decided that
the conditions were unfavourable for building, this much to my
regret, having just bought a colour film.

(.Bathilda ruficauda)
By Nicholas Gravem (Mill Valley, California, U.S.A.)
Of the so-called Australian grass-finches, I personally believe the
Star Finch or Ruficauda (Bathilda ruficauda) has been rather neglected
as an aviary subject and particularly as regards its breeding. Here in
California, imported Stars are plentiful enough ; however, aviary-bred
birds are sadly scarce. I understand that this same state of affairs also
exists, more or less, in Britain. Perhaps a few remarks on breeding these
finches, over here, may be of interest.
I breed Stars and&apos;Gouldians indoors in cages measuring about 24 by
18 by 15 inches deep. These cages are built in batteries of four in a unit
and are truly box-cages with only the fronts open. I have never known
Stars use a nest-box like Gouldians ; and they are furnished with one
of those tiny, wooden-barred canary travelling-cages, with the bottom
knocked out, and fitted within the cage on its side.
It has been my experience that these birds generally, as Gouldians,
come into condition and breed during our winter months, going into
post-nuptial moult in our late spring or early summer. However,
I have found that Stars are very much more flexible than Gouldians
with regard to adapting their breeding cycle to the spring and summer
of our northern hemisphere.
After mating (by " mating ", I mean pairing, not coition), the cock
proceeds with most of the work of nest-building, the hen assisting to a
minor degree. Compared with a Gouldian nest, this is a very neat
piece of work. The nest, built within the canary travelling-cage, is a
globular affair with entrance in the side and is usually started with the
coarsest material at hand and then receiving an inside lining of fine,
dry grass and (supplied) feathers. " Egg sandwich " architecture--so
frequently employed by over-zealous Zebras and less frequently by
frustrated Gouldian cocks--is seldom resorted to.
Three to five white eggs seem to be the rule, incubated for some
twelve or thirteen days. Very little egg-binding seems to occur with
Stars, even when breeding is controlled in small cages affording so little
exercise. (Gouldian hens, of course, are rather prone to this complaint ;
and I find that if a hen of this species becomes egg-bound and, more
particularly, if she reabsorbs the egg instead of expelling it, egg-
binding will always recur and the only thing to do is to retire that
particular hen from the breeding-cage.)
Diurnal incubation is usually shared by cock and hen, with the hen
alone incubating at night ; though in occasional pairs both will occupy
the nest at night. The incubation patch in the median apterium of the
hen is not as easily seen as it is on the abdomen of, say, a hen Gouldian.

I believe cocks of the genera Bathilda and Poephila are without this
patch--even though they do a large amount of daytime incubating--
and perhaps this is why these cocks incubate only during the day and
the hens at night when greater heat is required to keep the eggs warm.
Both parents also share in brooding duties.
Upon hatching, the young are fed by both parents by regurgitation,
with the cock perhaps doing more of the feeding as the nestlings grow,
both cock and hen usually being model parents. I believe insect fare is
necessary, or desertion will result. I use cut-up mealworms : one worm
three times a day upon hatching and increasing the number of worms
by one each day until they have fledged. This is along the lines
suggested by Mr. Brooksbank in his excellent book Foreign Birds for
Garden Aviaries. Mealworms are used as a matter of convenience and
undoubtedly any number of other insect forms would also fill the bill.
I have not found mealworms overheating to the parent birds or other-
wise objectionable, at least not while following the rationing schedule
as above. Millet sprays are before the birds at all times ; soaked sprays
when feeding young. I have had no real success with egg-food, bread
and milk, sponge cake, etc., in regard to nestling grass-finches.
The basic seed diet consists of about three-quarters small canary
mixed with one-quarter white millet, shaken with a little C.L.O.
Most so-called finch seed mixtures are predominantly millet; mine
mostly canary. Also available at all times is a supplement mixture of
more or less wild seeds that consists of: water-grass, sweet sudan (red
and yellow), brassica, kohlrabi, lettuce (black and white), clover, rye-
grass, and phalaris. This latter gives the birds, I believe, more than
enough variety. Cuttlebone in its original form is not given. Instead,
a mixture of ground cuttlebone, ground oyster shell, and ground
boiled egg-shells, in equal parts, with a bit of flaked charcoal added,
is supplied. The only green food offered is the small, young shoots from
planted rape seed. I am successful with this diet ; and I am sure other
aviculturists have equally sound diets, as well as successful systems of
breeding and management for grass-finches. I don't believe in
dogmatic ideas in reference to things avian.
I leave young Stars with the parents as long as possible after leaving
the nest, but still manage to get two nests per pair (infrequently three)
per year. The young, upon leaving the nest, roughly resemble young
Gouldians, but with darker bills, and completely lack the papillae-like
spots of colour in the malar region, as possessed by the Gouldians ;
but, before leaving the nest, the young Stars have well-developed white
areas at the commisural point (angle of the mouth), as well as coloured
mouth linings. Incidentally, young Stars have quite dark toe-nails
compared with the lighter colour of tarsus and toes. Sexing of young
prior to the postjuvenal moult is considerably more difficult than with
Gouldians (in which case the young hens exhibit darker bills than the

cocks) ; however, the fledged male Stars very soon attempt their small
warble of a song.
Young Stars bathe almost immediately upon quitting the nest ;
unlike Gouldians, which I find a bit reluctant to bathe. (However,
young Gouldians placed with young Stars soon imitate the latter and
bathe several times a day ; but when separated from the Stars, these
ablutions soon taper off. This would indicate that their innate bath-
ing behaviour can be gadfly accelerated by visual stimulation.)
One drawback with aviary-raised Stars is that they almost always
tend toward xanthochroism ; that is, the red feathering is replaced
with yellow or yellowish, quite unlike freshly imported specimens.
Most aviculturists claim, I believe, that this is due to a dietary deficiency
and particularly as regards live insect food. However, as red in feathers
results usually from chemical substances (carotenoids) taken with
green stuff, I wonder if live food has any bearing on the matter. I have
heard that soya bean, in some form, has been successful with Tanagers
in this regard.

THE STORY OF A LAPWING

<bodyText confidence="0.945928739130435" page_id="56318205"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
By A. A. Clarence (Parkstone, Dorset, England)
Some years ago I was at a partridge " shoot It was of the " set-
piece " kind : every stand marked, with its number embossed in black
on a large white metal plate, which was fixed to a rod and stood
about 2 feet above ground. At the first stand of the day my position
was near the corner of a high-hedged field. There I was surprised
to see a Plover standing motionless. I soon realized that it could not
fly and without difficulty caught it. I was astonished when I saw
that it had only one wing--the other was missing at the shoulder.
It had been cut off " clean as a whistle 55 . The skin had drawn
together over the bone and there was no blood. A surgeon could
not have done a neater job.
I put the Lapwing in a gamebag and passed it to a farm-hand,
who was acting as my carrier. This youth collected some worms
and gave them to the bird, which was very hungry. At the last
stand of the day I found myself in a field which adjoined the one in
which I had begun the day. At the base of the number plate lay
a severed wing.
No doubt the Plover had struck the plate in one of the fast
swooping dives which these birds delight in during the twilight hours
when, as though at a given signal, the whole world of night life
awakens, and Plover, Snipe, duck, and Curlew break into a
cacophony of sound, a chorus of calls, and whirring wings. On the

other hand, the Plover may have mistaken the white plate for one
of his own kind, and on a tour of inspection met his Waterloo.
We put him in a rabbit hutch, well supplied with water and earth-
worms. Next day he was liberated into a 15-ft. square roofless pen,
to which another pen of the same size adjoined. These pens were
built on solid sand and were used for rearing baby pheasants. An
aperture 10 inches long and 3^ inches high was at ground level in
order to allow the chicks to pass into the second pen, where grass
tufts and a dead mouse or two acted as cover and bait for flies.
I knew that Lapwings were quick-eyed birds, but I did not expect
this one to find the " bob hole " instantly, the exit being so well
below its line of vision. Having examined the second pen it returned
to the first, and never faltered or had to look for the opening.
Brailed Partridges would wander up and down the wire division all
day and never find it.
" Mr. Pee-Weet," as he was called, soon grew tame, and flourished
on the worms and insects brought to him by children, who were
enthusiastic hunters on his behalf and derived great entertainment
from the bobbing and bowing, which he did from the top of a box
covered with turf.
The winter set in and he looked very handsome and glossy standing
on this box. It was meant for him to shelter in, but he never used it.
In January there was a severe night frost ; this proved more than
his exposed side could stand. He was found frozen dead on top of
the box, much to my sorrow and that of his young friends, who
buried him in a boot box, with a wooden cross, flowers, and all !

Ill-luck or bad management, I don't know which, but certainly
I have not done well with breeding of birds so far this season. For
example, out of about forty Ruddy Sheldducks eggs I have only eight
ducklings. The fertility was poor, but there was a dreadfully poor
hatch with deads-in-the-shell ; and of those that hatched a fair
number were murdered by the unnatural wretches of broody hens
that I had bought in. I have, however, a nice strong young brood
of New Zealand Sheldducks, which by their very strength must invite
misfortune on them !
The only lories which have laid have either eaten their eggs or
refused to sit on them, and truth to tell I am beginning to lose interest

in them. I still have about a dozen pairs and a good few single birds,
mostly hand-tame.
Last year I did very badly and reared very few birds. The only
relatively bright spot was the " Foxwarren " Green Peafowl. The
Peahen laid no less than 18 eggs before going broody, really three
clutches. Of these one was clear and one was infertile because of an !
imperfect shell. The rest were all embryonated, but unfortunately
nearly all of those I trusted to an electric incubator died in the shell.
Of those left with the Peahen or with broodies, nine hatched. Had I
written sooner, as I had intended, I might have been able to
say that I had reared them all without loss, for until they were about
seven or eight months old, I had no losses. Since then, however,
one was killed (by a broody), one died of " cold weather Pasteurel-
losis ", and two developed such crippled toes that I destroyed them.
The survivors, one male and four females, are all good birds.
This year the Peahen has already laid two clutches totalling 14 eggs.
The first four hatched, four out of four, yesterday. They look strong,
one male and three females, I should say. All the eggs so far candled
have been fertile.
My little Demoiselle, a tame one, laid within about ten feet of the
dining-room and seemed likely to sit well. The egg, however, was
stolen, presumably by the Jackdaws that infest my place, and the
shell found under a nearby tree. I was very sad at this and made
even more so by the way that her ladyship followed me around as
though I had stolen it. Luckily she has laid again and this time
I quickly substituted a Barnacle Goose's egg, boiled in coffee and
ink and splodged to simulate the Crane's egg. She took to this
without demur and is incubating within ten feet of the door ! If the
egg is fertile I may return it to her when nearly ready to hatch, or
I may be tempted to try to rear it myself. I think the Stanley Cranes
are a pair ; so do they most times and they are defending a nest area
quite fiercely. My attitude is one of interest quite purged of hope or
expectation. The European Cranes are still too young to breed,
though they are taming nicely. I have a veritable drove (six) of
Vulturine Guineafowl, but they are all juveniles except for one, and
I can't expect anything this season, though they look in better form
than any of my birds and are so tame that they follow me closely
round their acre paddock.
I have quite a few ducklings of different species of Sheldduck and
geese, and of these I am particularly watchful over the New Zealand
Sheldducklings. There are also a few (precious few) baby pheasants.
Of the softbills, the Spreos finally revealed their sexes by laying
three infertile clutches at the same time. I know now that I had
three females. Luckily I had already a " cock " which I now intro-
duced. He was a real " Peer Gynt " and a-man-for-all-three-of-them.

The Toucan-Barbets, presumably so called because of the large
yellow and black, though not very Toucan-like bill, inhabit sub-tropical
zones in the Andes of north-western South America where there are
two forms :--
Semnornis ramphastinus of Ecuador and S. r. caucae of Colombia.
A third member of this genus is the Costa Rican Barbet (\0x25A0 Semnornis
frantzii) of sub-tropical zones in Costa Rica and western Panama.
A specimen of the first of these, new to the Collection, has been received
in exchange ; it makes a particularly interesting and attractive exhibit
at the Bird House.
Another bird not previously exhibited here is the Dusky Miner
(Myzantha obscura), one of the many Australian Honey-eaters. The
name used to be spelt Minah, and, of course, a better one would be
Dusky Honey-eater, but there is another, Myzomela obscura , already
known by this name.
Two White-bellied Storm Petrels ( Fregetta grallaria ) flew on board
R.M.S. Dunnottar Castle off Ascension. The ship's cat soon
killed one and the second was rescued by the wireless operator and
brought to London ; it lived only a few days.
Six King Penguins were brought from the Antarctic by H.M.S.
Protector and presented by the Captain and Ship's Company.
A Cape Robin-Chat ( Cossypha caffra) has been presented by Capt. R. S.
de Q,- Quincey and two Malayan Coast White-eyes (Zosterops palpebrosa
aureiventer ) by Mr. J. Newmark. An interesting addition to the Parrot
House is a Cuban Conure ( Aratinga euops ), also known as the
Red-speckled or Euops Conure.

Mr. M. Horwood collected two nestling White-necked Picathartes
in Ghana, feeding them mainly, I believe, on earthworms, and a
friend of his brought them to London by air. They are strong birds
with enormous appetites and they are so far thriving on the insectile
mixture used at the Bird House and some mealworms.
Two Maned Geese, another Cormorant, various Gulls and Pheasants,
including four Swinhoe's, have been bred in the Gardens. The
Green-winged King Parrakeets are nesting and another Swainson's
X Red-collared Lorikeet has been bred. The Satin Bower-birds built
a flimsy nest of twigs, bamboo and privet leaves. One egg was laid,
but it was broken soon afterwards. Four Greenfinches have been
bred in the British Birds' Aviary where a Stone Curlew is incubating
three eggs. Four Zebra Finches have been bred and there are nests of
Blue Tanagers, Black-throated Cardinals, Malayan Glossy Starlings,
and Black Crakes.
The Snowy Owls nested as usual and eight eggs were laid. Three
of these were given to a Spotted Eagle-Owl whose own eggs were
infertile and she hatched all three, of which two are surviving and
are now quite large. The Snowy Owl itself hatched several chicks,
letting them all die but one which is flourishing and growing fast.
An Australian Stone Curlew that was in Mr. Spedan Lewis's collection
at Leckford before the war now lives in the centre aviary at the Bird
House and continues to lay one or two eggs each year.

The Kinseys established " Manorin " thirty-two years ago, and built
up very considerable collections of birds, camellias, and orchids.
Unfortunately, the time came when Mrs. Kinsey found the strain
of supervising the collections too great and it thus became necessary
to dispose of them and the property at Manor. And so, in the words
of Mr. Kinsey, " Manorin is no more."

Das Buch vom Wellensittich. By Curt af Enehjelm. Edited by
Dr. Joachim Steinbacher. Verlag Gottfried Helene, Pfungstadt,
Darmstadt, Germany. Price 21.50 DM. (approx. 36^.).
Curt af Enehjelm, Director of the Helsingfors Zoo, is well known
to all readers of the Avicultural Magazine both for his achievements
in the field of aviculture and for his articles on the subject. This
" Book of the Budgerigar " has been produced with the assistance of
Dr. Joachim Steinbacher and, as might be expected, this collaboration
between two such well-known aviculturists has resulted in a most
comprehensive and informative work. Every aspect is dealt with,
starting with a description of the species Melopsittacus undulatus Shaw
in the wild, the history of its early importations and first breedings, and
the development of the varieties from the first mutation known, in
Belgium in 1872, to the countless colours which are available to-day.
The chapter on housing deals fully with cages, aviaries, and flights
and is illustrated with photographs, drawings, and diagrams. Advice
is given on buying birds, the points to look out for and avoid being
clearly given, and the author emphasizes that the cheapest bird is
seldom the best. His recommendations on how to treat birds during
the period immediately after purchase is particularly helpful. He also
says that in buying Budgerigars it should be borne in mind for what
purpose they are required, whether as a pet, for the pleasure of keeping
a few birds, or for breeding. He states that, as with all breeding of
animals, it is better to start in a small way with first-class specimens.
In the chapter on breeding the following aspects are dealt with--
choice of birds, breeding season, number of broods, pairing, laying of
eggs, and brooding, young, control of nests, foster-parents, rings and
the keeping of a record book, and points out the importance of the
latter. There are also chapters on feeding and care of Budgerigars,
moult, illness, " French moult," tame and speaking birds, and keeping
Budgerigars with other birds. Finally, there is full information on
colour breeding which occupies more than half the entire book.
There are 6 coloured plates, each depicting two varieties, by the
English artist, A. Vowles and 41 black and white illustrations.

WILDFOWL OF THE BRITISH ISLES. By Peter Scott and Hugh
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994590707317073" page_id="56318212"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
Boyd. Country Life, London, 1957. Price 21s. net.
There is no doubt that the group of birds popularly known as Wild-
fowl, which includes the swans, geese, and ducks, has become much
more popular in recent years than was the case formerly, when most
people thought of a wild goose or duck only as something to be shot and
eaten. This increased interest is due, no doubt, to the very fine pictures
one sees nowadays of the various species, drawn by the few artists who
specialize in the painting of these birds ; and in the establishment of the
Wildfowl Trust and its grounds at Slimbridge where the finest collec-
tion of wildfowl is to be seen. Very few people have an idea of the
number and variety of species of these birds that occur in our own
country and a book dealing with them was much to be desired. Such
a book would not be of much value unless it were well illustrated, and
with pictures in colour; and it must include all the species that occur in
Britain.
Such a book has now appeared and we welcome Wildfowl of the
British Isles , by Peter Scott and Hugh Boyd, as adequately filling a gap,
for it contains a full description of plumage, nesting habits, and range,
as well as a first-rate coloured illustration, of every species, even
including some that are only occasional visitors and some, such as the
Mandarin Duck and Canada Goose, which were introduced but have
become established with us. There are fifteen coloured plates, some
containing three or more species, all drawn by Peter Scott, and
although we have seen some of these before in his very excellent
Reports of the Wildfowl Trust, they are none the less welcome in this
compact form.
The only fault we have to find with an otherwise excellent book is
the absence of an index, of which the Table of Contents does not quite
take the place.

Notes on a Collection of Parrots
The following notes on my birds may possibly be of interest to some of our readers.
Starting with the successes :---
Roseate Cockatoos.----The cock of this pair is one of the late Duke of Bedford's
split-albino Roseates and was obtained from Mrs. Clark, of Maidsmere. Last year the
hen laid three eggs, and reared three beautiful youngsters, one of which is an albino.
It is white where the normal is grey, its breast is a lovely pink flecked with
white, giving a pearl effect, the under-wing feathers are very deep pink--nearly red,
it has the red eye, a flesh-coloured beak and feet. From what records I have been able
to look up, I believe this is the first albino Roseate to be reared in captivity.
Leadbeater's Cockatoos, reared three youngsters.
Blue Ring-necks, reared two youngsters.
Lutino Ring-necks, reared three youngsters.
Turquosines, reared three.
Splendids, reared one.
Illiger's Macaws, laid three eggs, all were fertile, but did not hatch.
Pileated, hatched two youngsters which lived for three weeks but died of cold
when the hen stopped brooding.
Brown's, had three youngsters in the nest on the 2nd March, but all died on the
night of the 15th March, when we had snow and 19 0 frost.
Crimson-wings, laid three eggs, two were fertile but did not hatch.
Derbyans, laid two eggs which proved infertile.
Amazon Parrots, laid two eggs which proved infertile. I am afraid the hen is too
old for any further breeding successes.
An interesting happening was that three 1955 bred lutino Ring-necks developed
their pink rings; two of these birds were bred by Mr. E. N. T. Vane, the other by
Mrs. Clark.
At the time of writing the Cockatoo population at Mount Pleasant is as follows :*--
seven Leadbeater's, four Citron-crested, seven Roseates, two Gang Gangs, and one

SEXING SOFTBILLS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960552222222222" page_id="56318213"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
How does one sex softbills ? Raymond Sawyer returned my other Rothschild's
Grackle two weeks ago, and when I put them together they looked as obvious a pair
as one could imagine. To confirm this my old bird sang like mad, and they preened
each other and he started breaking off twigs in a most business-like manner. Then
the " hen " began to pursue the " cock " in a rather half-hearted way and he looked
quite dejected. A few days ago the " cock " began to pursue the hen in a decidedly
purposeful way, and later I rescued the hen from the ground, luckily before there
was any real damage done to her. I still think they are a pair ! ! As Frost says,
these grackles, sing, mate, or fight, quite irrespective of sex.

By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
The Green Imperial or Bronze Fruit Pigeon has a very wide dis-
tribution, being found in India, Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Indo-
China, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Flores, Borneo, Celebes,
Philippine Islands, etc. There are, consequently, numerous races,
as many as fourteen being recognized.
This pigeon may be common in the wild state, but it is very seldom
seen in captivity in Great Britain. The Zoological Society of London
received their first specimen in 1866, a second arriving the following
year, with three more in 1871 : other arrivals were 1878, one ;
1883, one ; 1884, three ; 1892, one ; since when there have probably
been others. The only record of private ownership is the pair of the
Philippine race (D. a. chalybura ) collected in 1903 by Walter Good-
fellow for Mrs. E. J. Johnstone.
Pigeons collectively do not enjoy the popularity with aviculturists
they perhaps deserve. The smaller Fruit Pigeons, on the rare occa-
sions they are imported, usually find ready buyers as the majority
are so very beautiful. But the larger species, such as the present
which measures 15-17 inches in length, would probably prove almost
unsaleable, except to a zoo--and that is really the best place for them.
In August, 1954, a London dealer offered us five Green Imperials
(their origin being unknown it was, of course, impossible to determine
the race) and despite the fact we had no suitable accommodation
we bought them. Fortunately, John Yealland, as on many other
occasions, both before and since, kindly eased the situation by taking
them on deposit at the London Zoo : and there they remained for
nearly two years, until May, 1956, when they were finally trans-
ferred to our newly constructed range of pigeon aviaries. Having
been at the Zoo for so long one would have thought they would have
been very steady and that nothing could disturb them. But such

was far from being the case ; they were exceedingly timid and on the
slightest pretext would panic, somehow " half-roll " and hang
suspended from the roof of the flights--it will perhaps be remembered
from past accounts that the flights of these particular aviaries are
composed entirely of close-woven wattle fencing, except the roof
which is wire-netting. However, they gradually quietened down and
at the present time are as steady as one could reasonably expect.
We assumed that if, as we hoped, they attempted to nest it would
be some time during March, April, or May. We were reconciled
to the fact we had missed the 1956 breeding season and so we were
not disappointed that they showed no signs of nesting during the
remaining summer months. Autumn and winter passed and they
appeared to be troubled not at all by the cold. At the Zoo they
had had a heated house to use if they were so disposed, but with us
they have only half-open shelters, facing north ; and as often as not
they did not use them but roosted out. So they may be considered
quite hardy.
We experienced considerable difficulty in pairing them up as in
coloration and size the sexes appear to be exactly similar. Finally,
mainly as a result of trial and error, we sorted out what we believed
to be two pairs ; the odd bird being paired with a surplus Pied
Imperial.
Wooden seed-trays were provided as platforms for the expected
nests, and roughly formed foundation nests of straw were added as an
incentive. Straw, however, proved an unsuitable nesting material.
In common with some other Fruit Pigeons this species has somewhat
specialized feet, very strong with broad soles, developed to enable it to
clamber about branches and so reach fruit that would otherwise be
difficult of access. While indulging in courtship pursuit they frequently
landed on the platforms, with the result that the straw was dragged
out and scattered. Hay proved a quite successful alternative. The
actual nests were of a very scanty nature--little more indeed than
a few wisps of hay.
At the beginning of January we started dusting the food with
powdered cuttle-fish bone--this with a view to obviating egg-laying
troubles that might be due to any calcium deficiency. It certainly ;
had the desired effect as none was experienced.
Pair No. 1. On 9th March an egg was laid in the sand at the front I
of the flight. It was unfortunately punctured. On 1st April an egg was
laid in the sand at the back of the flight and another was found in the
nest : both of these were transferred to domestic pigeons, but they j
proved to be infertile. A fourth egg was laid on 22nd April, but was
deserted after a week or so and was removed on 3rd May. The measure-
ments of three of these eggs were 42 X 32 mm., 42*1 X 32-6 mm., i
and 42*2 X 32*5 mm. ; they were pure white with a slight gloss.

Pair No. 2. An egg was laid on 27th April, but was thrown out of
the nest and broken on 7th May. A second egg was laid on 1st June.
The female settled down and as incubation progressed she became
increasingly tame, eventually so much so that towards the end of the
period she even allowed herself to be stroked while on the nest. Both
parents spent a great deal of time on the nest. We were unable to
decide whether the male was actually assisting in the incubation or
whether he was merely keeping his mate company. During the
three or four days prior to the hatching both hardly left the nest.
The egg was found to have " starred 53 on the afternoon of the 20th
and had hatched by next morning. The incubation period is believed
to have been eighteen days. It is, however, rather difficult to determine
this point with any accuracy because the female did not begin seriously
to incubate until several days after the laying of the solitary egg.
The nestling in down was dark rufous above and pale rufous-brown
below. The female brooded it very closely, so closely in fact that it
gave cause for anxiety as the weather part of the time was very hot
indeed. This close-brooding lasted for about a week and may have
been the reason why the young one appeared to be very slow to
develop--at least by domestic pigeon standards. It then grew rapidly.
Lest it leave the nest prematurely a heap of straw was placed beneath
to break its fall. This, however, proved to be an unnecessary precau-
tion. It was strong and robust and by nth July was perching on the
edge of the nest, managing to reach a perch the following day and
thenceforward finding its way round the aviary quite easily.
On leaving the nest the young one appeared to be an almost exact
replica of its parents except that it was, of course, very much smaller.
It was a little less brightly coloured, with the legs and feet paler, but it
had quite a high gloss on the back and wings. It throve amazingly
and was, and is, a great credit to its parents who, in their turn, at
all times behaved in a really exemplary manner, even now with
never a hint of spitefulness.
Food. In captivity the feeding of these large pigeons presents little
difficulty : they will thrive on a very wide variety of foods. We have
known one species do very well, for a time at least, on damsons and
soaked brown bread !
Our own staple food consists of apples, bananas, tomatoes, and dates,
diced, mixed together and dried off with coarse biscuit-meal. The
drying off is very important, otherwise the birds will soon become
very soiled round the head, neck, and breast, and look very unsightly.
We have tried several biscuit-meals and found the most satisfactory
to be " Stamina 53 Poultry Biscuit Meal, which we put through a
mincing machine. To this staple mixture we add, as available, a
large variety of extras, grapes, cherries, plums, pears, pomegranates,
green peas, chopped lettuce ; boiled potatoes, carrots, rice ; soaked

sultanas, apricots, and figs. We do not give any form of milk-sop,
soaked sponge-cake, or insectivorous food, as is sometimes recommended
for some of the smaller species.
The food for a dozen Green and Pied Imperials takes quite a lot
of preparing. It does not, however, need to be chopped very finely.
Both these species have enormous gapes and are capable of swallowing
incredibly large pieces. In the wild state they are partial to nutmegs
which they swallow whole with ease : later, when the peel has been
digested, the nut is disgorged.
From the time the young one was hatched a heaped teaspoonful of
" Bemax " containing a couple of drops of cod liver oil was sprinkled
on the food.
Water. The authorities are still somewhat divided on whether this
pigeon drinks in the wild state. There can really be little doubt that
it is a regular drinker. Naturally, we provide water at all times, but,
as yet, have never seen one drink.
Postscript .--The young one was separated from its parents on
6th August as they showed signs of nesting again. An egg was in fact
laid on 9th August and duly hatched on 1st September. The squab
is at present only two days old, and much now depends on the weather.

By J. L. Throp (Curator, Buteyn Bird Ranch, San Luis Rey,
California, U.S.A.)
There is a group of large woodpeckers found in North and Central
America which are regarded as being the most impressive of all wood-
peckers. Members of this group practically all fall under different
genera, the only reason for calling them a group at all is their somewhat
similar appearance. They are all crested and have some semblance of a
white V on the back. This group contains the rapidly disappearing
North American Ivory-billed Woodpecker and the Mexican Imperial
Woodpecker, the largest of all woodpeckers, measuring 20 to 22 inches.
These two species, due to their specialized feeding habits, cannot survive
the encroachment of civilization. Other members are much better
favoured, the Pileated Woodpecker and the one we are now concerned
with, the Pale-billed Woodpecker ( Phoeceastes guatemalensis) are two.
Other members are found south of Mexico.
The members of this group have not often been kept in captivity.
The feeding habits are so demanding that few people would assume
such a burden. George and Evelyn Whitney, of Elsinore, California,
did assume this challenge, and the following information was compiled
in the hope it may add to the general knowledge of these magnificent
birds.
George Whitney, Jerome Buteyn, and Pat Murphy took a trip to
San Bias, Nayarit, Mexico, in the early part of May, 1955. They are
all bird enthusiasts and the trip was one of observation with the hope
of bringing something home for their collections.
A Pale-billed Woodpecker's nest was discovered a few miles from
San Bias along one of the forest tracks. The nest was in an old, rotten
palm tree about 16 feet from the ground. The palm had broken off
at the junction of a previous woodpecker's nest. The wood was soft
and pulpy. Two unfeathered young were taken ; from the colour of
the skin and pin-feathers of the crown, we know they were a pair.
One was red and the other was black, the red-crested was the male
and was also the larger. The two birds ate mealworms readily, and
no meals were missed. The female, regrettably, was accidentally
killed before they got home.
Coming back from Mexico, 108 degrees temperature was en-
countered in the Arizona desert and all the mealworms died. The
whole of the last day home the bird survived on those worms.
A short while after the bird's capture several black specks were
noticed under the skin. These grew quite large ; one of them was
lanced and a large grub-like creature filled with blood was squeezed

out. Seven or eight of these parasites were removed and what future
effect these might have had can only be speculated.
The bird was fed exclusively on mealworms for the first two months.
By this time he ate about fifty a day in two feedings. Other insect life
was tried during this time and it invariably caused indigestion.
Hard-boiled egg yolk was introduced and eventually the whole of
the yolk and part of the white was consumed every day. He had a
liking for " mocking bird food ", though objected if it was dampened.
The most notable thing connected with this bird was his sensitive
digestive system.
It was felt that an effort should be made to get the bird on a more
varied diet, and since these woodpeckers eat a small quantity of berries
and fruits in season, one soaked raisin was fed the bird. For two days he
moaned and complained with a stomach-ache. A week later he was
again given a soaked raisin and again he complained, but for a shorter
time. The raisin was given with increasing frequency until it became a
staple item. In season he also got two grapes each day, but he had to
be started on these half a grape at a time and still he was upset. The
tiniest piece of apple produced the same results until eventually he was
eating a piece about the size of a thumb-nail at each feeding.
At one time the woodpecker got indigestion that continued for two
days. The Whitneys were at their wits end trying to figure the cause.
It was found that when potatoes, for moisture, were put in the bran
containing mealworms the worms became toxic and the bird invariably
was sick. Apples used for the same purpose caused no ill-effects nor did
the flat cactus leaves. These leaves are preferred by most California
aviculturists and are cut in strips and laid on top of the bran. He was
very fond of bread slightly dampened with milk but this always gave
him indigestion so it was given sparingly.
The moult was made gradually so the bird always looked in top con-
dition with a fine sheen on the feathers. George thought it odd, but they
never found any of the red crest feathers. In the spring the normally
white areas of the bird, the wing patches, and the V on the back, turned
bright yellow. George thinks this may be due to the sulphur content
in the egg yolks given.
The woodpecker was given a lot of freedom in the house and
became increasingly destructive until he was about two months old.
At this time he attacked the wood panelled den and in a short time had
a hole that soon would have gone through the wall to the outside. He
was put in an all-metal cage 4 feet square and 2 feet high where he
quickly adjusted himself. For preoccupation he would busily pulverize
a piece of two by four wood put in his cage every few days. He disliked
a small clapper bell intensely and spent much time worrying it.
George found the bird would go into battle stance, raise the crest as
far forward as it would go, when he tapped the water container with

his finger. The bird would dance along his perch and his eyes would
take on a glazed stare. It was definitly threatening. The woodpecker
never acted this way to Mrs. Whitney.
The loss of the bird was caused after two years in confinement when
the Whitneys ran out of mealworms, the principal item in the diet.
When their stock got down to 500 they would order more from their
dealer. The 500 reserve would last ten days, it generally took only
three or four days to receive the worms but they allowed a grace period
to cover any delay. This time a severe delay occurred and the worms
were not sent until fourteen days after they were ordered. The
Whitneys made every effort to get them from local people, but nobody
carried them in any quantity and with the diminishing supply of worms
the bird soon died. The loss was felt very strongly.
From the trials encountered with this bird, they feel it would be
impossible to maintain a captured adult. The Whitneys plan to obtain
another youngster of this group and see just how much they have

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
I have always had a particularly soft spot in my heart for Senegal
Parrots as I had a delightfully tame one for 21 years, and I am conse-
quently very pleased to be able to record the successful breeding of the
species here at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm this 1957 season.
It seems that this may be a first breeding. Apparently they are said to
have been bred in 1886, before the Avicultural Society had come into
existence, but our Hon. Secretary, Mr. Prestwich, who is I think
acknowledged to be the chief authority on the subject, wrote to me
saying that he had " always regarded the 1886 report as rather more
than suspect ".
Before the war we had a very fine-looking, and I should have said
obvious, pair of Senegals here at Keston, but, although given every
opportunity to do so, they never made any attempt to breed, so after we
had had them for about three years, we parted with them.
Then after the war we decided to try again, this time with a
couple consisting of one we had purchased and one that had been
kindly sent to us by Miss Knobel. They are by no means easy birds to
sex, particularly single individuals, but Miss Knobel had rightly
assumed that her bird was a hen and ours fortunately turned out to be
a cock. As a breeding proposition, however, they did not seem a very

promising pair owing to their extreme wildness, both of them--as they
still do--dashing panic-stricken into their shelter uttering their worst
slate pencil screeches, if anybody went near their aviary.
They were very secretive about their nesting operations and I
personally never saw either of them taking the slightest interest in their
nest-box, but, as the hen eventually disappeared and as there was no
sign of a corpse in the aviary, we assumed that she was sitting. This was
in May and some time later, when both birds were in the flight and
dashed headlong into the shelter, we decided to shut them in and have
a look in the nest-box. The inspection revealed three half-grown young
ones, all of which have been sucessfully reared and are now flying with
their parents.
The first one to fledge, which had the curious habit of frequently
going back to spend long periods in the nest-box, came out about 6th
July, and the other two some four days later. They are very fine young-
sters, as will be seen from the accompanying photograph, which my
partner Alec Brooksbank took when the youngest of them had only been
out of the nest a couple of days or so.
Actually the first intimation I had that they were starting to fledge
was when one morning I approached their aviary and was astonished
to see a Senegal Parrot sitting calmly on a perch instead of dashing
wildly into the shelter ! Closer inspection of course revealed its dark
eyes, but the only difference from its parents in plumage was its very
dark grey crown and pale ashy grey cheeks, as is the case with the other
two. Altogether I don't think I have ever seen such grown-up looking
young ones&apos;--newly-fledged Blue-fronted Amazons, for instance,
looking such very obvious juveniles.
The nest-box, measuring about 10 inches square by 24 inches deep
with half a coconut husk fixed in the bottom, was hung up under over-
head cover in the open flight.
In addition to their staple diet of sunflower, canary, hemp, and
peanuts, the parent Senegals were given, while rearing their brood, a
considerably increased amount of hemp and various extras. These
consisted of boiled potato and carrot as well as a large cube of stale
bread previously soaked in sweetened milk to which Virol, etc., had been
added. These were given daily and we also offered them boiled white
fish--of which my tame Senegal was so fond--but this they refused to
sample, so it was discontinued. They always have spinach beet leaves
and apple about twice a week throughout the year, and during the
rearing period, both were given daily.
Finally, for the benefit of anyone who might not be familiar with the
appearance of these small parrots, I would just add that the Senegal is
green with a grey head, and with the lower breast and abdomen
orange-yellow. Its total length is a little over 9 inches.

Dr. P. L. Sclater, reporting on the additions to the Zoological
Society's Menagerie during May, 1886, says amongst the most
noticeable are : " Five Senegal Parrots (. Poeocephalus senegalus) , pre-
sented by R. B. Sheridan, Esq., May 5th. Four of these are young
birds bred in a large aviary at Frampton Court, Dorchester, under the
management and care of the late Mrs. Sheridan. This is of interest,
as these Parrots are rarely known to breed in captivity " (P.#.S.,
1886, 318).
In Bull. Soc. Nat. d'Acclim. de France , 1888, 667, the Director of the
Jardin d'Acclimatation (A. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire) says that on the
4th April, 18883 he saw a number of " Perroquets Marabous (P.
senegalus) " living in the open air at the London Zoo. A letter from
Sclater, dated 31st May, is quoted : " We received five of these
Parrots in June, 1886 : as we had been assured that four of them had
been reared in an open flight, we installed them in the Gardens under
similar conditions. Although two of the five birds, an old one and a
young, died, it was a rather curious experiment. They passed all last
winter (1887-1888) in the open flight where you saw them, without
other shelter than several wooden boxes."
I have always regarded the Sheridan event as rather more than
suspect, mainly because in the wild state the number of eggs is generally
stated to be two. Four certainly seems to be a rather large brood,
but the young may, of course, have been the product of two nests.
I certainly think it more likely the four young were newly imported
birds.

BREEDING OF DOUBLE-WATTLED CASSOWARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992137694444444" page_id="56318231"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
By Kenton C. Lint, Curator of Birds, Zoological Society of San Diego,
California, U.S.A.
A Double-wattled Cassowary chick (Casuarius casuarius aruensis)
was hatched on 30th April, 1957, in the Zoological Gardens of San
Diego. In its history of forty-one years this is the first record of a
Cassowary chick to be hatched successfully in the gardens.
The Cassowaries are the only members of the group of struthious
birds that have become adapted to life in the jungle. One of the most
primitive living birds in the world to-day, this entire group has
proved to be the most difficult to breed in captivity. Their heads are
protected from thorns by a heavy casque and their powerful legs are
fitted for crashing through tangled brush rather than for dashing at
high speed over open plains. The bare portions of the face, as well as
a long narrow space on each side of the neck, are brilliantly coloured
in blue, red, and yellow, the variations in shading being an important
factor in the separation of forms. About twenty have been described,
ranging from north-eastern Australia to New Guinea and small
adjacent islands.
The plumage of the Cassowary is much like that of the Emu, having
the same well-developed aftershaft. In structure, however, the wing is
quite different from those of other struthious birds, the flight feathers
being represented by five or six hard, stiff quills. When our Cassowaries
are angry the wing feathers are scraped along the fence making a loud,
rattling sound which warns one of their temper.
Cassowaries are fierce, pugnacious creatures, able and ever-willing to
deliver stunning blows with their powerful feet. Wounded birds are
treated with respect by natives in the bush and captive specimens
receive watchful consideration from their keepers and must be watched
constantly.
Male and female usually cannot be kept together unless in a very
large enclosure. A compatible pair of adult Cassowaries is rarely
seen in captivity.
We have persisted in our efforts to breed this species in captivity.
The male bird and father of this baby has been on exhibition for thirty-
one years. He alone incubated three eggs this season. The incubation
period was recorded at fifty-four days.

By Burton Benedict (Floreal, Mauritius)
The aviculturist who steps ashore in Mauritius will feel very much at
home, for around him he will see some of the commonest aviary birds of
Europe and America. The Indian Mynah (. Acridotheris tristis) hops
along the road ; the Bulbul (Otocampsa jocosa) and Green Singing Finch
(1 Serinus mozambicus ) flit about the garden ; flights of Indian Ring-necked
Parrakeets ( Psittacula torquata ) wing screeching overhead ; flocks of Red-
eared Waxbills ( Estrilda astrild) and Spice Finches ( Munia punctulata)
hover about the fields, and colonies of Spotted-backed Weavers ( Ploceus
spilonotus) build their elaborate nests in the casuarina trees by the sea.
These pleasant observations may be interrupted by several reflections
--surely these birds are not native to Mauritius, their very names
betray their countries of origin as Africa and India. How did they
reach this tiny island, barely the size of Surrey, which is some 1,400
miles from the east coast of Africa and over 2,000 miles from India ? It
is difficult to imagine a Waxbill or a Mynah flying such distances over
water. Clearly they must have been brought, but why ? How ? And by
whom ? Wandering further afield one sees more and more of these
avian immigrants. The ubiquitous House Sparrow ( Passer domesticus)
is seen in every gutter, though it is the light-coloured Indian variety
rather than the one familiar to English and American cities. Driving
along, Necklace Doves ( Spilopelia chinensis) and much smaller Zebra
Doves ( Geopelia striata ) rocket up before the car. Everywhere in the
island the story is the same. Another question springs to mind--where
are the native birds of Mauritius ?
Of the twenty-five species of birds once endemic in Mauritius only
nine remain, and only one of these, the tiny, pearly Manioc-Bird
( Malacirops borbonicus) is at all common. These little softbills, about the
size of a Zebra Finch, are to be seen flitting about the garden uttering
a metallic chirp. The local name, " Pit-pit," reflects this sound. The
Manioc-Bird resembles the much rarer Olive White Eye (# osterops
curvirostris) but lacks the white eye ring. The Olive White Eye is more
grey than olive, but otherwise resembles the Zosterops kept by
aviculturists. The other endemic Mauritian birds include a small
Peregrine Falcon, the Mauritius Kestrel (Falco punctatus) ; a very rare
parrakeet, the Mauritius Parrakeet ( Psittacula echo ), which resembles
the Indian Ring-neck but is rather larger; the extremely rare and

beautiful Mauritius Pink Pigeon (, Nesoenas mayeri ) ; the almost extinct
Mauritius Cuckoo-Shrike ( Coquus typicus) ; the Mascarene Blackbird
(Microscelis borbonica ), which is sooty-grey with a blackish crown; and
the Mascarene Flycatcher ( Tchitrea bourbonnensis) , an attractive bird
with a black head, grey breast, and russet wings and tail.

When the Portuguese landed in Mauritius in 1507 they found no
human inhabitants, but a rich and varied avifauna. Most famous of
these now extinct birds was the almost legendary Dodo. A living
specimen was exhibited in Europe in the seventeenth century. It died
in England and was presented to Oxford. Nearly a hundred years
later an over-zealous vice-chancellor consigned its moth-eaten remains
to the fire. Only the head and a foot were retrieved from the flames,
and these rather grisly objects may still be seen at the University
Museum, Oxford.
The Dodo was only one of the many birds exterminated in Mauritius
by the destruction of the forests, indiscriminate hunting, and the intro-
duction of the rat, monkey, and mongoose. Some of these extinct birds
make the aviculturist wistful, particularly the Mascarene Parrot
(.Mascarinus mascarin ), which was found in the neighbouring island of
Reunion as late as 1845, an d the Broad-billed Mauritius Parrot, a large,
handsome, nocturnal bird, probably flightless, which was sketched by a
Dutch traveller in 1601-1602. Only a few of its bones have been found.
Another striking bird which would have graced any aviary was the
Dutch Pigeon ( Alectroenas nitidissimd) . It had a greyish head, dark blue
body, and russet tail and was last seen in 1850.
But what of the immigrants ? Some of them have fared no better
than the native species. The Painted Quail ( Excalfactoria chinensis) was
introduced in the first half of the eighteenth century, but the Indian
Mongoose, imported to destroy rats, has practically exterminated it
along with other ground-nesting quail and partridges. Only the Indian
Grey Partridge ( Francolinus pondicerianus) , introduced about 1750, is
holding on precariously. The Helmet Guinea Fowl ( Numida mitrata ),
introduced in the eighteenth century, is now very rare in the wild state,
though several domesticated races exist. Only two ducks are to be
found in Mauritius, the White-faced Tree Duck (. Dendrocygna viduatd ),
which may have migrated here from Madagascar, and Meller's Duck
(Anas melleri) , also a Malagasy species. Both are extremely rare.
The Red Avadavat (. Amandava amandava) was an early importation
in Mauritius. It was wiped out by the great cyclone of 1892. The same
fate overtook the Cape Canary (Serinus canicollis) which was last seen
in 1913. A different fate overtook the Java Sparrow (. Padda oryzivora ),
which was introduced from Malaya about 1750. It became such a pest
that an ordinance was passed to encourage its destruction. It was last
seen in 1892. The Grey-headed or Madagascar Lovebird ( Agapornis
cand) was once common in Mauritius, but is now only found in the
small neighbouring island of Rodrigues. Both the Pied Grow (Corvus
albus) and the Indian House Crow ( Corvus splendens) were introduced
into Mauritius, the latter on several occasions. Both were indis-
criminately shot and are now extinct in the Island. The Madagascar
Broad-billed Roller (Eurystomus glaucurus) , a large, handsome, magenta

bird, occasionally migrates to Mauritius between October and June.
It is nearly always slaughtered on arrival.
Yet some immigrants have managed not only to survive but to
thrive. The absence of cyclones over the past twelve years has per-
mitted the increase of many of the small finches. Both the Spice Finch
and the Waxbill brought to Mauritius in the eighteenth century are
becoming more abundant. The Spot-backed Weaver, known in the
local French patois under the endearing name of " le schlugschlug ", is
increasing so rapidly as to become a pest. The Zebra Dove which
reached Mauritius circa 1781, is well established.
The Mynah was imported about 1760 to control locusts and grass-
hoppers which were devastating crops. It has performed this task well
and " le martin ", as it is called locally, is the most conspicuous bird in
Mauritius. The Ring-necked Parrakeet was brought from India about
1886, and is now considered a destructive pest. The Bulbul is even less
popular because of its attacks on ripening fruit. It was introduced as a
cage bird and accidentally released in 1892.
Possibly the most beautiful Mauritian immigrant is the Madagascar
Fody (Foudia madagascariensis ) which was introduced some time in the
eighteenth century. It is a bird about the size of a canary. The male
in the early summer breeding season is a brilliant scarlet, which gives
rise to the local name " cardinal ". The wings are brownish and there
is a small black diamond shaped mask over each eye. The female is
yellowish-brown. They are fairly common birds though extremely shy.
Much rarer is the Mauritius Fody (.Foudia rubra), the ninth endemic
Mauritius bird. Only the head and breast of the male of this species are
scarlet, the rest being greyish-brown. The diamond-shaped eye patches
are much larger than those of the Madagascar species. The female is
brownish-grey.
In spite of the existence of many easily bred species and a nearly
perfect climate, there is little aviculture in Mauritius. In the central
market one can purchase Green Singing Finches, Waxbills, Spice
Finches, Ring-necked Parrakeets, and Zebra and Necklace Doves ;
some degenerate Budgerigars are also offered. Most of these birds are
kept as cage birds- or in decorative aviaries in gardens. Little attempt
is made to breed them. It seems a great pity that no efforts are made to
breed some of the rarer endemic birds which, I fear, will disappear all
too soon from this lovely Island.

Aviculturists frequently have opportunities to add to our knowledge
of many kinds of birds, but because their first interest is properly one of
keeping and breeding their birds, rather than looking for new data,
they sometimes fail to record detailed observations which would be of
use to other students of birds. The purpose of this short paper is to call
attention to the need for fuller information on the Whydahs of the
genera Vidua and Steganura and the related Combassous or Indigo
Finches.
These birds, either known to be parasitic in their breeding or
suspected of being so, are frequently kept in aviaries, which gives the
aviculturist the opportunity to add important information of a sort
that would be extremely difficult to obtain in field studies of wild birds.
Parasitic birds have been a special study of mine for many years and at
present I am preparing a comprehensive report on these weavers.
Bringing together all the available information, both published and
unpublished, has revealed the many and serious gaps in our knowledge
of them, and I would urge all aviculturists having any of these birds to
keep careful records of any observations on the courtship and breeding
habits they may display. I shall be glad to correspond with anyone
having notes on them, and hope that by combining many individual
notes and experiences there may result an account more useful to, and
more meaningful for, all parties concerned.
The need for further knowledge may be made clearer by appending
here a series of particular questions to which it is hoped that some
answers may be forthcoming from observations on these birds in
captivity. First of all a list of the species involved may be helpful.
They are as follows:--

Information on any of these points for any of these species will be
greatly appreciated. Needless to say, full credit will be given the donors
for any information they may supply. Due allowance will have to be
made in interpreting observations for the artificial elements introduced
by the fact of captivity, such as the unnatural choice of hosts forced
upon a parasite by having to use what other birds the aviary contains,
by the absence of " individual distance ", etc.

FIRST BREEDING OF THE GREATER HILL
MYNAH (.EULABES RELIGIOSA) AT THE
KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997965571428572" page_id="56318239"  page_num="160" year="" vol="">
By Edward J . Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
A pair of Greater Hill Mynahs have successfully reared a young
one here at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm this (1957) season, and in
reply to a letter of mine, Mr. Prestwich wrote saying they have
" certainly never been bred before ".
The parents are a most amusing and quite celebrated couple as they
appeared on television in September, 1956, when an hour's programme
was devoted to our Bird Farm.
We imported a number of hand-reared Greater Hill Mynahs from
India in 1955 and kept one specially tame cock whom we called Joe.
He was given an aviary to himself and the following year was provided
with a mate who more or less christened herself Jo-Jo. Incidentally,
although they are superficially as alike as two peas, it is possible to
sex these Mynahs by the colours of the eyes and legs. As is the case
with many of the cockatoos, the cock's eye has an almost black iris,
while that of the hen is of a brownish colour, and her legs are of a paler
yellow than his, as also are her wattles.
Our pair both emit terrific wolf whistles and this is apt to have a
rather disconcerting effect on our female customers, causing them to
glance hurriedly round to see which male member of our staff has
taken a fancy to them ! They also whistle " Pop goes the Weasel ",
Joe doing the first part, and Jo-Jo finishing it for him with an extra
loud " POP . . . goes the Weasel ". Joe gives the most accurate and
reverberating imitation of the ringing of a bell--a sound which I
should have thought was extraordinarily difficult for a bird to re-
produce. They also do a rather fruity laugh and a very wheezy
asthmatical cough, and are excellent talkers with a very clear enuncia-
tion, among their sayings being : " Hullo Joe," " How are you

aviary by himself. They are both, particularly Jo-Jo, very devoted to
our General Manager, Bill Cummings--as they ought to be, considering
the care he bestows upon them.
Being by nature more or less omnivorous they were always given a
varied diet, particularly when they were rearing their young one, at
which time they were given bread and milk, insectivorous mixture,
apples, pears, cherries, grapes, etc. : minced raw meat, chopped
dates, and, morning and evening, a rationed allowance of gentles and
mealworms. Once--a rather anxious moment--they were given a
skinned mouse and I had qualms lest it should be too much, in one go,
for the young one. However, my fears proved groundless, for Jo-Jo
took it in her beak with its hind legs flapping about outside, and after
doing some rather muffled talking owing to this obstruction, dis-
appeared into the nest-box and fed it to the young one, who was none
the worse, and, incidentally, was always very noisy when being fed.
Two days before the young one fledged a most extraordinary thing
happened. Jo-Jo suddenly decided to murder Joe, and had not my
partner Alec Brooksbank happened to pass their aviary at the crucial
moment and succeeded in rescuing poor Joe, she would certainly have
succeeded. Although the stronger bird of the two, he was in a state of
abject terror and she had got him on the ground in the corner of the
flight and was starting to hammer away at his head.
Always hitherto a most devoted couple, they had been together in
the same aviary for about eighteen months, and I can think of no
explanation at all of why she should have so suddenly and viciously
attacked him. In any case a very disconsolate Joe was removed from
the aviary and the following day the young one perched for some time
in the entrance to the nest-box and then went back inside again. The
next day it came right out and flew straight down and had a bath ! It
was very steady and, although a strong flier, never did any of the usual
banging about in the aviary, and I only wish all newly-fledged birds
were as self-possessed and sensible.
Actually, if there was to be any trouble between the parents, we
originally thought it would be that Joe might attack Jo-Jo, because he
was extremely possessive about their only child, and in the early stages
did practically all the feeding of it. Incidentally, I may add that the
young Mynah is now fully independent and has been taken away from
its mother. We naturally wondered what sort of reception Joe would
get when he returned to the aviary, but apart from Jo-Jo calling him
a silly old crow several times and both of them doing a good deal of
whistling, there was very little reaction on either side. The following
morning, however, Joe was found dashing about in the aviary and
panting with exhaustion, so, although she did not appear to be doing

so at the time, we could only conclude that Jo-Jo had been chasing him
about. Rather regretfully therefore, we decided that the only thing
to do was to clip one of her wings so that Joe could always easily get
away from her. The curious thing is that judging by their demeanour
whenever one is watching them, one would still imagine that they are
at all times the very best of friends.
Last year the parents went to nest twice, on each occasion breaking
their very beautiful, faintly speckled bright blue eggs, but this may have
been because their nest had no coconut husk fixed in the bottom, as it
had this year. It is true that, from the nesting material supplied, they
selected numerous twigs and coarse grass stalks which they deposited
in the box, but they did not make a proper nest, and this I think was
the cause of the broken eggs. When nesting, they have a curious habit
of periodically carrying quite large stones into the nest-box, and these
had to be removed from time to time.
As will be seen from the accompanying photographs which were
taken by my partner Alec Brooksbank the day after the young one left
the nest, it was at first smaller than its mother, and, of course, lacked
the high gloss on the black plumage of an adult. Its legs were very pale
whitish-yellow, as were the rudimentary wattles which consisted of
small, flat patches of bare skin.
As described above Edward J. Boosey has bred the Greater Hill
Mynah (Eulabes religiosa). It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

THE BIRDS AT PAIGNTON ZOO
By Captain H. S. Stokes (Longdon, Rugeley, England)
On a recent visit to this Zoo, which was often referred to in our
Magazine in Mr. Whitley's day, it was a great pleasure to see the
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.996241" page_id="56318243"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
beautiful garden and lake and the wonderful greenhouses all planted
with rare and lovely plants, and to find the bird population being
gradually brought up again to its pre-war standard. The Paignton
Zoological and Botanical Gardens, Ltd., the proprietors of this Zoo,
sent an expedition to British Guiana on their own account, and this
has resulted in a number of rare and interesting birds and mammals
being brought back.
The great tropical house with its nine large compartments and a
score or so of small ones has as yet but few birds in it, but includes
Sunbirds and a pair of Violaceous Tanagers which were nesting.

H. S. STOKES-THE BIRDS AT PAIGNTON ZOO 1 63
One compartment with a small pool was being prepared for a Surinam
Jacana ( Jacana spinosa) which the Zoo has had for some time.
The Parrot house, with its cages of unusual and very practical
design, still contains some of Mr. Whitley's old inmates, such as a
Blue-eyed Cockatoo and a Green-winged King Parrakeet. There is
a good series of Amazon Parrots, including the Yellow-headed,
Mealy, Red-throated, Salvin's, Salle's, and Orange-winged. The
Conures also are well represented with the Brown-throated, Finsch's,
the Greater Patagonian, and Golden-crowned. There are specimens
of the Orange-crowned Gold Coast Parrot (Poicephalus gulielmi
fantiensis), and of Maximilian's Parrot. In this house were also a pair
of Abyssinian Touracos and a pair of Double-toothed Barbets
(Lybius bidentatus ) brought from Africa by Mr. Michelmore, the head
of the Whitley Educational Trust.
Extensive repairs and renovations have been carried out to many
of the houses and ranges of aviaries, and these are now populated by a
choice selection of birds, which were shown to me by the Curator,
Mr. Travers. A great deal of thought is given to the care and comfort
and feeding of the birds, and the result is obvious in their beautiful
condition.
A range of about eight tropical aviaries has a good selection of
finches, doves, and softbills, and Tinamous of two interesting species.
One compartment contains four specimens of the Little Blue Heron
(.Florida caerulea ) in its immature white form, another one a pair of
Mount Roraima Aracaris ( Pteroglossus roraimae), brought back by the
British Guiana expedition, and thought to be a first importation.
There is a long range of outdoor aviaries, with shelters which can be
heated when necessary, containing a series of macaws and cockatoos.
Another range with very large flights has Occipital Blue Pies, breeding
yearly, and a small collection of pheasants.
The birds of prey range houses among other Raptores a pair of
Condors which must have been there for thirty years, the hen laying
yearly. Owls are also well represented.
Beautiful paddocks on the hillside contain Sarus, Stanley, Demoiselle,
and White-necked Cranes ; Cereopsis Geese bred last winter, and
Barnacles were nesting at the time of my visit.
Perhaps the pride of the whole collection are two Wattled Cranes,
received separately from Africa, the later arrival a young bird. It is
greatly to be hoped that they may prove to be a pair.
A small pond enclosure has Rosy Wood Ibises, Sacred Ibises,
and Tree Ducks, and another one Black-necked Storks and Pelicans.
Black-footed Penguins had bred in this shelter.
The main lake, with wooded islets and beautifully planted margin,
has a rather sparse collection of waterfowl, which it is hoped to increase.

tame, and a great attraction to visitors. This is not the place to speak
of domestic pigeons, of mammals, of tropical fish and reptiles, all
well displayed and in excellent condition.
The Zoo authorities have ambitious schemes in view for the develop-
ment of a beautiful, wooded valley beyond the lake, with hillside
paddocks and rocky quarries for a series of large birds and mammals,
and of groupings of plants in their natural orders. This would certainly
be a unique addition, though even to-day a visit of two or three days
is not too much to devote to this Zoo.

Among the recent arrivals at New Grounds the most important
addition to the collection has been a fine consignment of birds made
available by the courtesy of the Department for Internal Affairs of
New Zealand. This consignment included three pairs of New Zealand
Brown Duck ( Anas aucklandica chlorotis ), three pairs of Blue or Mountain
Duck ( Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos) --a species which we understand has
never before been kept in captivity, and two pairs of New Zealand
Scaup (. Aythya novce-seelandia) . These birds have now finished their
quarantine and are well established in our pens.
The arrival of two male Kelp Geese ( Chloephaga hybrida hybrida)
from the Falkland Islands means that all species of geese are now re-
presented in the Wildfowl Trust collection. These were accompanied
by two pairs of Flightless Steamer Duck ( Tachyeres brachypterus ).
After many years we have at last succeeded in obtaining and estab-
lishing a Buffiehead ( Bucephala albeola) at Slimbridge. A pair was sent
to us from North America but unfortunately the male died on arrival.
The female was force-fed on small sections of eel for some days and is
now out on the main diving pond, in perfect health.
Common Scoter ( Melanitta nigra nigra) have also been established for
the first time, and a further addition has been a fine pair of Hooded
Merganser ( Mergus cucullatus) reared and presented to us by Mr. Pilling
of Seattle.
The fine weather of May and June has helped to make 1957 the most
successful breeding season yet recorded. So far ninety species have
nested, among the more interesting being the Magpie Goose ( Anseranas
semipalmata), Bewick's Swan ( Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Ringed
Teal (Anas leucophrys) , New Zealand Scaup (Aythya novce-seelandire) , Lesser

laid one infertile egg. At the time of writing there are some 650 young
birds, and although it is early yet it seems likely there will be a record
number of birds reared.
The Bewick's Swan was unfortunately disturbed from its nest by the
visiting public during the early days of incubation and its five eggs were
not hatched. I am pleased to say that she has started a second clutch
and we hope to arrange for her to have a more peaceful time brooding
the second lot of eggs.

THE RED-BILLED CHOUGH

Though the distribution of this bird covers an enormous area, from
the West Coast of Ireland and the Iberian Peninsula, through Southern
Europe and North Africa (a colony inhabiting one of the smaller
Canary Isles), the mountain ranges of the Mediterranean, Syria,
Abyssinia, Arabia, Southern Russia, Afghanistan, Central Asia,
through the Himalayas to North-East China, its habitats are more or
less remote localities required by the birds' specialized economy.
These are high cliff faces often rising sheer out of the sea or high
altitudes on great mountain ranges, usually in the most lonely and
desolate places of the world. Mountaineers have said that the Chough
is the last avian inhabitant of the great peaks seen before reaching the
utterly barren regions of snow and ice which will not support feathered
or in fact any other kind of life.
The following is taken from a recent book, The Sherpa and the Snow-
man, by Charles Stonor, page 104 :--
" Choughs were much in evidence to-day, and the two kinds found
in the Himalayas were both the Red-billed (Tchong-moh to the
Sherpas) and the Yellow-billed (or Tchong-Dzum) clever, happy
birds, very characteristic of the Sherpa countryside, much as are the
rooks amongst ourselves. The climbing expeditions meet them right
up at 26,000 feet and even higher, though what takes them to altitudes
that are totally devoid of life, it is hard to imagine.
I had met them several times already, bustling about in the village
fields, prodding in the ground with their long scimitar beaks, and
streaming down the valleys in loose flocks on their way to their feeding
grounds and back. Both kinds go together in casual association, but
their habits are different, the red-billed do not find their way up so
high, or in such large flocks, and they have a jackdaw-like call, as
compared with the eerie banshee piping of their relative." And again,
from the same source :--
" My attention was called to a vast flock of yellow-billed choughs

swarming overhead, a thousand or more strong ; they were engaged
in some spring courtship flight, spread out when we first saw them in
a great dark cloud, like a drifting plume of smoke or a swarm of
gigantic bees. Each and every bird of the flock, wing quills spread
apart, was dipping and diving, planing and weaving, in and out of
the cloud of its fellows, now solitary, now a member of a little group
broken away and displaying as a unit. The whole assemblage was
sometimes a continuous flock, sometimes splitting up into parties
swarming together to reunite as a rounded whole or to straggle out
streamer-wise. Surely this must be one of the most wonderful spring
flights among birds. Even the hard-bitten Sherpas were impressed
and stopped to watch as the choughs began to spiral in wide circles,
until they soared away in silence, out of sight of the naked eye, at a
height of anything between twenty-five and thirty thousand feet.
It has become a common experience of mountaineering expeditions
in the Himalayas to meet choughs and other birds at immense
altitudes. Apparently the lack of oxygen and the conditions of the
atmosphere has no effect on them at all ; an extraordinary condition
of affairs for which the science of physiology does not so far give an
explanation.
To the ordinary outsider it suggests a remarkable body mechanism,
whereby a quick-moving creature such as a bird, all of whose vital
processes must act with such infinitely greater speed than our own,
can climb to the thinnest atmosphere, where we can hardly scrape
along with artificial helps, and in a matter of seconds adjust its every
movement to a totally different set of outside stresses and strains. 53
Yet strange to say the Chough is equally at home down at sea-
level on the stony beaches at the base of the cliffs in the few places
where it survives in the British Isles.
It is in the mountainous regions and on the cliff faces that one sees
how useful is the long, slender down-curving bill which, with the legs
and feet, look as if they had been cut out of coral, for not only do they
look like red coral, but they have the feel and texture of that substance.
The bill is quite different from that of any other member of the Crow
family, except that of its near relative the Yellow-billed Chough, though
with this bird it is shorter and less curved. Neither does any member
of the Crow tribe use his beak with such facility. The Chough can
use it to work round corners or under rocky ledges, for prying under
flat stones, exploring fissures and crevices, seeking out insects which
are forced to hide away from the bitter winds which so often blow at
hurricane force in those high regions.
In those lofty realms where our bird makes his home there is great
competition in the plant world for an adequate anchorage, so there is
little loose or free soil. It is matted and turfy and held together by the
roots of rock plants. It is here that the Chough uses his beak as a

pickaxe to hack into these masses for insects or their pupae, which in
the cold altitudes, lie torpid for long periods.
I have watched the birds digging out tiny pockets of earth on cliff
faces which contained the nests of minute ants and unearthing ground
spiders which seem common in high places, it's then that the beak
is used as forceps or tweezers to pick out the edible bits in the debris.
In fact the Chough seems to spend his time either probing, exploring,
and excavating the stony world in which he lives in his never-ending
search for food--or in aerial acrobatics. Though there may be swifter
fliers, such as the dashing and meteor-like Peregrine or the speeding
Alpine Swift, scything its way with incredible speed through the high
atmosphere, and which must be the fastest flyer of all birds, few,
if any, have the effortless and graceful flight of the Chough.
It seems not so much to use its power of flight to get from one place
to another, as for the sheer joy of flight alone, and incongruous as
it may sound when speaking of a crow, its flight has the lightness of
thistledown borne on the wind. Its displays of aerial prowess are
enhanced by the settings in which they are given, which are in the
most spectacular, majestic, awe-inspiring, and least frequented by
man, of all the world's most solitary and lonely places.
Once common around the high cliff faces of our Southern and
Western shores, the Chough has now, alas, been reduced to the
status of one of our rarest breeding birds, colony after colony vanishing
during the last 150 years. Its near extermination has been brought
about by two main agencies, by the egg collectors who have almost
every accessible nest marked down and who receive word from the
local inhabitants when the eggs are ready for taking. The second
reason for its rapid decline is shooting, firstly by scientific skin
collectors in the nineteenth century and by that fraternity who found
pleasure, and still do, in massacring our wild birds. In the last century
sea-bird shooting was one of the favourite recognized " sports " for
holiday makers, and guns and boats could be hired on the spot.
In Cornwall and Wales the birds' habit of digging has been its
undoing. Farmers with cliff-land farms have seen the birds probing
about in the newly-sown wheat or oat patches on the top of the
cliffs and refusing to believe that the birds were not after the freshly
planted seed were glad of an excuse to slaughter them. The belief
that the birds eat grain is very prevalent in Cornwall, where a few
pairs of Choughs still linger.
Considering that the Red-billed, or Cornish Chough, as it used
to be called in these Islands, is such an outstanding member of the
Crow tribe and that it is so well known in folklore and tradition--
Shakespeare speaks of " the russet-pated Chough "--it is very
surprising how very little has been written about it in avicultural
iterature.

In all the years of keeping birds I have never seen or heard of but
one offered for sale and that was at a fantastic price. Yet they are
sure to be seen at any of the larger bird shows in this country where
the owner can be certain of getting a " First " in the " Large British
Softbill " class. In fact at a leading show in recent years I heard that
nine had been entered for competition !
I had kept the other species, the Alpine or Yellow-billed, but gave
them away to a local public aviary before embarking on a long voyage
abroad. I was rather sorry about this afterwards, for the birds turned
out to be a true pair and nested every year and hatched young,
but failed to rear them as they were not supplied with suitable
food.
However, within recent years a pair were known to be on sale,
and it was more or less to save their lives that I bought them. When
I got them home they certainly looked a " poor buy ". Owing to
unsuitable food which lacked the necessary vitamins, there were
large areas of the plumage which lacked pigment, being a dirty putty
colour instead of the normal glossy purple-black. The naturally
brilliant coral-coloured beaks and legs were pale and dull, especially
in the male bird, whose bill was overgrown and who had a nasty
chesty cough. The hen's beak was badly crossed which made it
difficult for her to feed.
On being put into a large aviary with rocks and gravel, a large
bath, plenty of room to fly about and a shed (which they loved),
their joy knew no bounds. For the first few weeks they spent their
time alternately bathing and whetting their beaks on the flat stones
in order to get them into the proper shape again.
The discovery of the opening which leads into the shed was the
source of great interest to the birds. At first they discussed the matter
on the ground, then flew on to the bottom ledge of the opening,
craning their necks inside so far that they nearly fell over, all the
while conversing with each other. Sometimes the cock would push
the hen in and she seemingly terrified would rush out and then try
to push the cock in. This went on for a day or more and when at
last they decided it held no terrors for them, they simply loved it,
mainly I think because out of a window they could see if any one
approached from the house. Tamer or more charming birds I never
had. They are quite without fear.
The Chough from all accounts is a bird with a happy disposition ;
though most birds of the Crow family are quick-witted (they have
to be to survive), intelligent and cunning, some have a sense of
humour--but this bird is quite different, it seems to dance its way
through life, always happy, light and airy, full of grace and gaiety.
It is interested in what one does, but the interest shown does not give
the impression of nosey ness. There is always a joyous welcome when

one comes in sight, though they often remain silent when a stranger
appears.
In the spring of 1956 the birds went to nest in half of a large
barrel which had been cut in two and placed end up on a platform
near the top of the aviary. A large hole had been cut in the side of
the barrel and the whole simulated a small cave. This was taken
to with alacrity. Soon the birds had a large structure built in the
centre of which was a small depression about the size of an ordinary
Blackbird's nest, and in time five eggs were laid. These were duly
incubated but, alas, failed to hatch, as they proved to be infertile.
This was no doubt owing to the low condition of the birds which
had been looked after during my prolonged illness by someone who,
though professing to be an ardent aviculturist, had neglected the birds,
and finally let me down altogether, until my kind friend Fred Logan
stepped into the breach.
During this nesting period the cock became extremely aggressive,
in fact he has never lost his pugnacity. He had a specialized and
cunning method of attack. As soon as he felt one's eyes were not on
him, he made lightning dashes for one's head, which he attacked
with his feet, inflicting quite nasty abrasions.
The attempt at reproduction seemed to give him added confidence
and he became very aggressive towards humans he knew, though I
could never decide if this was really pure bad temper or just very
aggressive and boisterous play. When he got himself worked up he
would crouch on the ground, feet well apart, feathers standing on end,
head between his legs and wings alternately waving in a kind of
rowing motion. His attacks on humans greatly annoyed the hen, who
would take a flying shot at him and knock him on to the ground,
where the pair, a tangled ball of feathered fury, would fight it out.
In a few minutes after this was over they would be their own friendly
selves towards each other.
Bathing they love, and if by accident they have been closed in their
shed for a period of several hours, they both indulge in repeated
bathing which lasts for an hour or so.
They live mainly on a good insectivorous mixture with as much
live food as possible. Unlike other members of the Crow family they
refuse any type of vegetable food, even cheese in bulk they disdain,
though I use it, finely grated, in their food. Nearly all
insectivorous birds like cheese, especially Jays and their kindred.
As mentioned before, in a wild state Choughs feed to a great extent
on the contents of the nests of small species of ants, but my birds when
given " uncleaned " ant eggs in bulk with nest debris and living ants,
were simply terrified and have always remained so, keeping as far
as possible from the container. They are very fond of mealworms
and woodlice.

J. J. YEALLAND-LONDON ZOO NOTES
The Choughs live amicably with a pair of Blue Crossoptilons,
though perhaps " amicably 55 is hardly the right word . . . " armed
truce " would perhaps be better. I am sure they would be unsafe with
any other birds, either their own size or smaller. The Crossoptilons live
in a state of haughty disdain, ignoring the Choughs, as far as possible
until the latter tweak their long flowing tails. However, with young
Crossoptilons it's quite a different matter. These are chased and
chivvied and generally tormented until they hide away and would
rather starve than come out of their hiding place.
Many so-called sub-species of the Red-billed Chough exist in the
imagination of scientific ornithologists, five being recognized in the
U.S.S.R. alone, the differences being usually in the length of the
third primaries, the central tail-feathers, or the legs ; these being
only a question of millimetres. But to casual observers the whole genus
appears to be more or less uniform.

Gabon, has sent two Cameroon Spotted Honey-Guides (.Indicator
maculatus stictithorax ), the first of the Indicatoridae to be received here.
This race, like most of the Honey-Guides, is not brightly coloured,
rather resembling a very small and dull coloured hen Satin Bower
Bird in general pattern, but for a variety of reasons the family is of
great interest.
The Honey-Guides are a small family (eleven species according to
Friedmann; thirteen according to Peters) of four genera and all
inhabit Africa with the exception of the Orange-rumped of the
Himalayas and a race of it ranging from northern Assam to northern
Burma, and the Malayan Honey-Guide of Siam, the Malay peninsula,
Sumatra and some adjacent islands.
The habit of guiding ratels (honey badgers) and human beings to
bees' nests is known to occur in the Greater Honey-Guide and the
Variegated or Scaly-throated. The guiding call of the former is a
chattering noise. This appears to be the best known of the family and
has a wide range over Africa southward of the Sahara wherever the
habitat is suitable.
The birds appear not so much interested in honey as in the comb and
larvae of bees which, of course, they could not obtain unaided, and it is
only after the ratel or man has taken the bees' nest that the bird
(almost always alone, but occasionally there are two) comes to feed
on the remaining fragments. Bees and other insect life are also eaten.
The Greater Honey-Guide is, according to Friedmann, known to be

All known eggs are white.
The young of at least some Honey-Guides are furnished with a sharp
hook on both upper and lower mandibles, these hooks dropping off
after some days. Whether the hooks are employed in the killing or
ejection of the foster parents' young is not known. It would surely be
very difficult in the case of some hole-nesting foster parents for the
Honey-Guide chick to evict the others, but whatever the method, and
there is evidence of both, the Honey-Guide is eventually the sole
survivor of the brood.
The Greater, Lesser, and Lyre-tailed perform flights in which a
noise is made, presumably by the outer tail-feathers, when the bird
dives. The skin of these birds is said to be very tough--evidently a
protection against the stings of bees.
Since the foster parents never eat honeycomb, the young Honey-
Guide cannot feed on it until it is able to fend for itself, when, presum-
ably, it learns by watching the adults. Why there should be this
desire for bees' wax and how it is digested ; how the guiding process
was evolved and how ratels and native people could originally have
learned that it was advantageous to follow a chattering bird are among
the many problems concerning these strange birds investigated by Dr.
Herbert Friedmann, but although a great deal of information about
them is set forth in his work, " The Honey-Guides " ( United States
National Museum Bulletin 208), much remains to be discovered.
Honey-Guides have been kept in captivity. Mr. Sydney Porter wrote
of an immature Greater Honey-Guide that he rescued and kept in
Southern Rhodesia ( A.M . 1927, p. 152) which he referred to as the
Yellow-throated, but he was not alone in making this mistake, for the
young of this species is so different in plumage from either parent that
for a long time it was considered another species. Friedmann says, " A
South African aviculturist, W. R. Garthew, informs me that he has
kept both greater and lesser honey-guides for over a year. .
Other birds new to the Collection are a pair of the Malayan Bustard-
Quail ( Turnix suscitator atrogularis) presented by Mr. G. H. Newmark,
who also sent an Orange-headed Ground Thrush and a Black Racquet-
tailed Magpie ; and an Eastern Waxwing ( Bombycilla garrulus central -
asiae) presented, together with a pair of Crested Black Buntings, a
Fohkien Grey-headed Crow-Tit and a Grey Starling, by Dr. K. C.
Searle. Messrs. Brooke Bond have given two Baillon's Aracaris and
two Purple-crested Touracos ; three Common, three Ring-necked, and
two Mongolian Pheasants have been received in exchange.

larger and more boldly coloured than the males and are said to be
very pugnacious during the breeding season. The males incubate
the eggs and care for the young. Members of this family are also known
as Button Quail or Hemipodes, and the Andalusian ( 7 *. sylvatica ) of
north-western Africa and the southern parts of Spain and Portugal has
on three occasions been found in England, but these were generally
regarded as escaped birds, though, as Newton says, " easily satisfied
persons have admitted the species as a ' British Bird
The Eastern Waxwing is much like the more westerly bird, but a
little paler and greyer.
Three Snowy Owls, the first to be bred in the Gardens, have been
reared, two by a pair of Spotted Eagle-Owls and one by the parents
which have nested each year for several years, but have not previously
kept the chicks alive for more than a day or two. The Malayan Glossy
Starlings sent by Dr. Searle several years ago have reared two young,
one in each nest. This starling was bred in 1931 by Mr. A. H. Isenberg
in California ( A.M . 1931, p. 23), but has not, so far as I know, ever
before been bred in this country. The young are quite unlike either
parent, being grey on the upper parts and whitish streaked with dark
grey underneath--rather like a female Amethyst Starling. The nests
were built in a crevice of the rockwork.
The Black-throated Cardinals have built five nests and hatched a few
young ones, but have not yet succeeded in rearing any. The old
breeding pair of Green-winged King Parrakeets have bred only one
this year ; four Quaker Parrakeets, yet another Swainson's X Red-
collared Lorikeet, Cockatiels, Masked Lovebirds, another Green-
backed X Grey-headed Gallinule and some Pheasants have also been
bred. A pair of Sarus Cranes nested but did not hatch their two eggs.
One King Penguin chick has been hatched and a second pair are
still incubating an egg.
A North American White-headed (or Bald) Eagle has died after
nineteen years in the Gardens. The oldest inhabitant among the birds
of prey is a Bateleur Eagle that came in 1919.
The White-necked Picathartes sent from Sierra Leone four months
ago has died from tuberculosis, a disease which it may have contracted
in Africa, for Blount states that, in domestic fowls, " Except in those
rare instances where the infection is passed via the egg to the chick, the
natural incubation period is long, never less than five months."
Whether the incubation period is the same in smaller birds is not known,
but the disease is generally associated with aged birds.
Looking through the 1927 volume of the Magazine I noticed an
article by Miss Knobel describing a visit to Mr. Spedan Lewis' collec-
tion of owls at Wargrave. Mention was made of a tame Turkestan
Eagle-Owl, a bird which came here in 1950 and which until this year
has laid and incubated a single egg each summer.

Members of the Club, 48 ; guests, 37 ; total, 85.
After the Loyal Toast, the Hon. Secretary proposed the health of
Gerald lies, a founder member of the Club, who is due to sail for
Montreal on 9th October.
The Chairman welcomed Mr. and Mrs. F. H. Rudkin, just arrived
from California, and expressed the pleasure of ad in the attendance
of Miss Knobel and E. N. T. Vane, both of whom were in process of
recovering from serious illnesses.
Introducing the speaker for the evening the Chairman recalled
that it was the third occasion on which Lord Alanbrooke had visited
the Club for the purpose of showing films.
Lord Alanbrooke then showed two of his coloured films taken in
Spain and Holland, in May, 1956. The first was devoted to the
Bee-eater, Black-winged Stilt, Pratincole, and Purple Heron ; and
the second dealt with the Long-eared Owl, Great Crested Grebe,

Needless to say both films were of the very high standard we associate
with Lord Alanbrooke. The large audience showed by its prolonged
applause that it fully appreciated the patience and skill of the photo-
grapher in securing so many remarkable pictures.
The next meeting of the Club is on Monday 9 11th November.

In 1936 the Edinburgh Zoo received six Night Herons from Canada.
They reared several broods in an aviary and in 1950 some of the
young birds were released. They did not leave the Park and built
nests in the trees surrounding the Sea Lions' Pool. Now about thirty
of these birds form a free colony, nesting regularly.

Allen Silver continues to breed Golden-mantled Rosellas and
Stanleys with considerable success--please note, none for sale ! The
Rosellas, now somewhat aged, have reared a brood of three (the
smallest number any of the three hens used over the years has reared).
This now makes 72 young reared in the same aviary and box, since
the first pair was obtained from Tom Goodwin many years ago.
The Stanleys reared four in 1955, six in 1956, and five this year ;
and a 1955 female paired to an adult Australian male has at first
attempt reared six.

AUDUBON WESTERN BIRD GUIDE. By Richard H. Pough.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.858215857142857" page_id="56318259"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
Published by Doubleday and Company, New York, 1957. Price
4 dollars 95 cents.
This is a companion to Mr. Pough's two previous books --Audubon
Bird Guide which covers small land birds of Eastern and Central
North America from Southern Texas to Central Greenland, and
Audubon Water Bird Guide which comprises water, game, and large land
birds of the same areas. The present volume comprises land, water,
and game birds of Western North America, including Alaska, from
Mexico to Bering Strait and the Arctic Ocean. Of the 614 species
included in the book, 203 are exclusively western, and these are
described fully with information concerning nests, habits, and range.
For the other 411 the range only is given as they have already been
described by the author in his books on eastern birds, and the page
references of these are given. There are 340 drawings in colour by
Don Eckelberry, some species are shown in flight, for others the com-
parison of mature and immature birds, plumage at different seasons,
or male and female are given. There are also a large number of line
drawings by Terry M. Shortt, mostly of birds in flight. The informa-
tion is clearly and concisely given and the book is a worthy addition
to the author's previous bird guides.

AN INTRODUCTION TO BIRDKEEPING. By D. H. S. Risdon.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995443307692308" page_id="56318259"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
Published by Cage Birds , London, 1957. Price 15^. net.
Mr. Risdon's first words in his general introduction are : " This
book is for the beginner in birdkeeping. It is not for the more
experienced aviculturist." A very good book indeed it is for those who
are starting to keep birds, but it also contains much of interest and use
to those who are more experienced. For one thing, the author explains
clearly the difference between " species " and 64 variety "--a confusion
between the two terms is surprisingly frequently made. The birds
which are possessed by those who read Mr. Risdon's book should be
happier birds, for all through he stresses the importance of watching
them closely and so ensuring their health and well-being. He points
out what to look out for and what to do about it, and his book contains
many details not to be found in other publications on the subject.

A possible Explanation of Failures in Rearing Superb Spreos
I am having trouble with my brood of Superb Spreos and looking through the
past records it seems that very often the birds give up feeding the young just before
they fledge. This is just what has happened with mine and I am wondering if my
findings might be an explanation of the cause of other peoples' trouble.
The females laid in the one nest a total of seven eggs, six of which hatched. All
four birds in the aviary fed the young devotedly and paid no attention to my man,
even taking mealworms from his fingers and flying directly with them into the nest.
They did not seem to resent my examining the nest daily and this daily examination
revealed a dead young one when they were about fifteen days old. It was plump and
well-fed looking and had I not been post-mortem minded I might have just thought
that it had died of chilling, or something, for the old birds had already cut down on
the feeding. I opened it and found that its trachea was just about full of gapeworms ;
I counted over thirty couples. The old birds had now given up feeding altogether
and next day I brought the remaining four into the house (one had disappeared).
To my mind the parents had given up feeding because the young were too sick to
gape for food and not because of any interference on my part, for this had been
going on all the time.
Two of the young ones were very sick and gasped continuously. None gaped for
food and it was a matter of prizing open the bill and force-feeding all the time.
In any case they were too old to gape for a human foster-parent. By the second day
one young one refused to swallow the food put into its pharynx and died the next
day. One of the others has a broken femur and unfortunately this one seems to
be the most likely to survive. One of the others has wilted a bit, but I do hope I
can save at least some.
They share a big planted aviary, 80 feet by 30 feet, with a pair of Green Peafowl,
and although it has only been in use for one year, it must be pretty well infected.
I intend to disinfect it by killing off the earthworms with Mowrah meal and reduce
the risk of gapes and of blackhead in the peafowl. Tom Spence.

BREEDING BLUE ROBINS--A PLAGUE OF FOXES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993812142857143" page_id="56318260"  page_num="177" year="" vol="">
The hen of a pair of Blue Robins kept in a cage which had made a nest and laid
eggs, refused to tolerate the cock after four days, so I removed him to save his life.
The hen then incubated and reared four excellent young, two cocks and two hens,
which are now independent ; she is rebuilding the nest. In the meantime the
cock has been paired to another hen in an aviary and has five more youngsters by
her. Unfortunately this second hen still seems to want him to help with the domestic
duties and I hesitate to borrow him either to return to hen No. 1 or to a third hen
which has also built in a cage and is calling for a cock all day. A fourth hen, also
in a cage, and paired to her brother, has eggs, but does not appear to be sitting ;
maybe she is shy and comes off the nest when I am about.
We have a plague of foxes here this year which have pretty well wiped out domestic
poultry in the neighbourhood and are also destroying cats--bless them ! Unfortu-
nately they are causing me some anxiety by digging at the foundations of my pigeon
lofts and aviaries and must go the way of all flesh. One got itself shut up in the
garage, where at the risk of blowing the tyres off the cars, I shot it. One morning
when I went out to supply breakfast to the baby Robins (5 a.m.) I met a young dog
fox ambling down the front path. When he saw me, he merely turned aside and
strolled down another path, which has taught me never to go out in the morning
without a gun. As we are in a very much " built-up " area, I suppose the lack of
rabbits is driving the foxes into the vicin&apos;ty of human habitation, in search of other
forms of food. K. A. Norris.

THE AVIGULTURAL SOCIETY'S WATERFOWL RINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997298533333333" page_id="56318261"  page_num="178" year="" vol="">
Members sometimes ask to be told the size of the Society's rings required for
" the various " ducks and geese, and while the table published from time to time in
the Magazine is a good general guide, it is clearly impracticable to include all the
species in it--even if anyone is able and willing to measure a number of tarsi of each
of " the vaiious " waterfowl.
Keepers of waterfowl should judge for themselves the requisite sizes, and a simple
rule is that the ring must move freely up and down the tarsus, but must not be so
large as to slip easily off the foot. It should not, of course, fit tightly.
A number of Mallard rings are received from time to time, but I cannot under-
stand why anyone should want to put the Avicultural Society's rings on these or on
any other common native species. The scheme is surely intended for members and
others wishing to keep foreign or the rarer native waterfowl full-winged so that if,
for an unlikely instance, a stray Barrow's Golden-eye is found and it is wearing one
of the Society's rings, it will be proved not to be a new bird for the British List, and
ornithologists will be spared a certain amount of doubt, not to say grief.

I am writing a book on introduced animals and birds in the British Isles, and should
be very grateful for any information about full-winged waterfowl allowed their
freedom at present. I am particularly interested in birds that have started to breed
away from their home estates, but information about any well established free-
living waterfowl, except for Canada Geese, Egyptian Geese at Holkham, and
Mandarin Ducks at Virginia Water, would be welcome.
I should also be grateful for information about free-living birds other than water-
fowl which have started to nest away from their home estates.

DUFRESNE'S WAXBILL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95062490625" page_id="56318268"  page_num="179" year="" vol="">
(Coccopygia melanotis melanotis)
By J. J. Yealland (London, England)
Dufresne's Waxbill, also known as the Yellow-bellied Waxbill and,
in South Africa, as the Swee Waxbill was first described in 1817 by
Vieillot who named it Fringilla dufresni , but the description was
considered by Sclater to be inapplicable because of being so faulty,
and Temminck (PL Col. , livr. xxxvi, 1833, pi. 221, fig. 1) is now the
accepted author.
This Waxbill inhabits south-eastern Africa, being said by Stark to
be migratory in part of its range, but resident in Natal and the
Transvaal.
Sclater recognized five races, the Angola Yellow-bellied Waxbill
(C. m. bocagei ), the Kenya (C. m. kilimensis ), the Uganda (C. m. nyanzae ),
and the Abyssinian (C. m. quartina) being the others.
Stark says, " In Natal this pretty little species is, when not breeding,
usually met with in small parties of ten or twelve, feeding on the
ground on grass-seeds. . . . This Waxbill breeds in Natal not un-
commonly, but not, so far as I have observed, near the coast. Not far
from Howick, at a height of about 3,000 feet, I have met with their
nests in some numbers. Unlike many of the Waxbills, they build in
tall bushes and young trees, at a height of from six to ten feet. The
nests are rough-looking, oval structures, with an entrance hole on one
side, constructed of fine dry grass. The flowering ends of the grass
being woven together, the stiff stalks are left projecting in all directions.
The interior is lined with grass tops, down, and feathers. The eggs
are very small, pure white in colour, and four or five in number.
When first hatched the young are fed on small caterpillars."
Dufresne's Waxbill was first bred in the British Isles by Miss Elsie
Robinson, who wrote a good account of the occurrence for the
Avicultural Magazine (1934, p. 249) and was awarded the Society's
medal. Mr. H. S. Sewell bred it in Adelaide during the following

BREEDING SUCCESSES AND FAILURES IN

By E. H. Hawke (Louren90 Marques, Portuguese East Africa)
Although I appreciate all too well how boring accounts of breeding
this and that can become, it does occur to me that some of the successes
(and failures) in this part of the world, where, I think I am right in
saying I am the only member, and which is probably not well known
to many of your readers, might be of interest.
Lourengo Marques, the capital of Portuguese East Africa, is situated
on the mainland some 250 miles (as the crow flies) north of Durban.
It enjoys one of the finest climates of the world during four months of
the year (May-August) ; is very pleasant during another four (March-
April and September-October), but from November-February, it is
not to be recommended. Our rains fall during the summer months
except for odd showers and when it rains, it rains. Aviary drainage and
shelters therefore need careful watching, otherwise there is a risk of
finding oneself with accommodation more suited to fish than birds.
In all I have at the moment twenty-four aviaries, with another five
about to be constructed. Four of these are planted, the largest
measuring 15 feet by 45 feet by 18 feet. The rest, including those to be
constructed, are in the main, breeding cages. They vary slightly in
dimensions and shape, but roughly are in units measuring 4 feet by
8 feet by 12 feet, which can be combined if required to form larger
areas.
From both the ornithologists' and aviculturists' point of view,
Portuguese East Africa is an area which delights both the heart and
the eye. Still, in many districts, comparatively unspoiled by the
advent of man, there are some 900 different species of birds ranging
from the lordly Ostrich down to the tiniest of the warblers, in greater
or lesser profusion, and no matter where you may roam, it will be a
rare exception if no bird is in view.
One would think that with such a wealth of bird life close at hand,
no one in their sane senses would look beyond our boundaries for
aviary stock, but what aviculturist is sane ? Naturally my collection,
which now comprises some 100 species and 500 birds, is made up
mainly of locally procured stock, but I am always ready to accept

strangers, and I have a few representatives from Australia, India,
and South America amongst my birds.
The largest of my planted aviaries houses hornbills ( Lophocems
nasutus epirhinus ), rollers (Corarias garrulus , Coraciura caudata, Eucorarias
mosambicus) , weavers, starlings, bulbuls, doves, barbets and thrushes
and the smallest, a wide variety including most of our waxbills and
Sunbirds. It is, of course, difficult to keep such mixed families on
good terms with each other, and every now and then a dispute ends
in tragedy but, by and large, they seem to get along reasonably well.
Of course, I do keep the worst offenders to themselves, but it is quite
astonishing--at least to me--how frequently one can find a real
" bad-egg 53 amongst what normally is considered a peaceful species.
As I write, a new breeding season is upon us and there is activity
in all directions. As usual, I am hoping for miracles but will, of course,
be satisfied with whatever the fates permit. I hold crossed fingers for
my African Greys, down on eggs for the fifth or sixth time, but who
have never yet " delivered the goods 33 . I have hopes that my Lilac-
breasted Rollers and Sunbirds will this season do something more
than play at raising a family--a pastime which they apparently enjoy.
I always feel that it is a poor reward for days spent rushing around the
neighbourhood collecting cobwebs--arousing in the process the
gravest suspicions amongst individuals who, at the best of times, are
apt to look upon the aviculturist as not quite " all there 33 --and
watching a beautiful nest grow before one's eyes, to find the couple
suddenly lose interest. Incidentally, I have in my aviaries Scarlet-
breasted, Amethyst, Marico, Purple-banded, Neergaard's, White-
breasted, Collared, Grey, and Olive Sunbirds, and such attempts at
nest construction that I have witnessed, both in the aviaries and out,
have been the work of the female only. The male appears to spend
most of his time urging his wife to greater and greater efforts, though
he is never averse to passing the time of day with any other member
of the opposite sex who might pass his way.
Just in case it might be of interest to fellow aviculturists, I list the
species which have bred successfully in my aviaries, i.e. the young
have perched and grown to maturity. Ruddy, Common, Orange-

young which for some reason or another have not made the grade.
I am one of that group which does not believe in disturbing any bird
that is about its business of raising a family, so I cannot provide
much information regarding the number of eggs laid, incubation
periods, etc. Food is of the widest possible variety ; all kinds of seed,
fruit, bread soaked in milk, minced meat, insectivorous foods, live
food (grasshoppers, mealworms, gentles, white ants), greenfood, so
there is something for all tastes, and it is surprising what some of them
will eat. To me a Sunbird with a juicy piece of minced meat was
something unexpected. Those which share the Sunbird aviary also
enjoy the nectar mixture and fruit flies, and the bird that does not take
some nectar certainly is the exception.
I do a certain amount of trapping myself but, having a business to
attend to, the opportunities are few and far between. The natives,
however, bring in specimens from time to time, and it is really on
them that I rely for replenishing and adding to my collection. Fate
also lends a hand, as one may judge from the following two incidents
which may prove of interest.
I had been trying for some time to secure a Black-collared Barbet,
but could never find a native collector with sufficient intelligence to
find one of the hollow logs in which these Barbets normally roost.
One day, however, I was doing some writing in my study when our
cook-boy approached with a bird clutched in his hand--a Collared
Barbet, of course ! As he had been walking through our back yard,
the bird had fallen at his feet, having apparently stunned itself by
striking an overhead telephone wire. This in the middle of a fairly
large town.
The second incident concerns a Narina Trogon (.Apoloderma narina). I
I was telephoned one afternoon by my wife who, though she bears with
my affliction, is not too well versed in bird identification, to say a
Coucal was flying around our garden and the gardener thought he
could catch it--should she permit the attempt. Not wishing to damp
her enthusiasm, I agreed, and when I returned home about 5 p.m.
I facetiously demanded to see the bird, only to be told that it had
disappeared. My wife, however, insisted on my going out to see
exactly where the Coucal had been spotted and lo, there was no
Coucal, but a Narina Trogon. All forces were summoned, but the
bird made off and I said good-bye to my hopes of owning one of
those beautiful jewels.
Next day I was busy in my office situated in the centre of a very
busy port area, when a friend walked in with a bird in his hand--yes,
the Trogon. He had been walking along the street to see me on
business when this bird flew into his stomach and stunned itself.
Admittedly the target was of no mean size, but what luck. Both birds
lived in my aviaries for a number of years.

(.Amazona autumnalis autumnalis)
By E. N. T. Vane (Great Missenden, England)
The Yellow- or Primrose-cheeked Amazon is found fairly well
distributed in south-east Mexico and the northern areas of Central
America, but only occasionally are odd specimens available in this
country. According to Peters' Check List it is only regarded as a
sub-species to Salvin's, Lesson's or Lilacine and the Diademed
Amazons, but it is without doubt by far the most handsome of the four.
The body colour is a bright green, lighter on the under parts.
The frontal band is a bright cerise, the crown a delicate pale lilac
blue, the edge of each feather being darker. This colour merges into
the green of the nape and mantle and again these feathers are
emarginated with a blackish shade. The cheeks are chrome-yellow
extending from the bill below the eye to the ear-coverts, this area
being flecked with cerise in some cases. On the bend of the wing
is a patch of pale yellowish-green. The primaries are bluish and there
is an orange-red speculum. The tail is green, lighter on the underside
and yellowish towards the tip. The bill is yellowish horn with blackish
areas on the upper mandible. The eye is brilliant gold which can
vary considerably, sometimes when excited the pupil becomes very
small and the iris literally blazes, at other times the colour appears
to separate into two rings of red and yellow. The eye is surrounded
by a narrow, white skin orbital area, and in some birds the eyes appear
to have distinct lashes. The feet are grey, with black claws. The sexes
are alike, though cocks are larger in the head and bill. Immature
birds resemble the parents in all details, except that the eye is dark
brown and the bill darker towards the point of the upper mandible.
Some specimens have traces of yellow on the throat. Length is about
14 to 15 inches.
The pair of birds in my possession started laying when they were
about three years old. They have twice succeeded in hatching young
previously, and have had young dead in shell every other season ;
the eggs have always been fertile. The cock is most aggressive in the
breeding season, indeed he is always seeking the opportunity to
attack someone or something and frequently vents his spite on his
poor hen, who is a charmingly friendly bird by comparison. His
favourite amusement is to knock her off the perch and watch her
climb back. She accepts this as normal good manners, and always
takes her time to come back within his reach. She regards any outside
interference in this procedure as unwarranted between husband and
wife, and is always ready to join him in a cursing match. This trait
is probably the cause of their repeated failures to rear their young, as

every year just as the hen should be incubating, it is time for the
adjoining land to be ploughed or sown, and this is the signal for the
cock to start his nonsense. They are both good talkers, and have
taught several of the other birds to talk as well. It is always amusing
to hear the cock encouraging the hen in the depths of the nest box,
and to hear her muffled replies coming back. But every time he starts
swearing at the farm hands over the hedge, or any other intruder
such as a cat, fox, or other visitor, the hen immediately joins him and
comes off her eggs. Unfortunately, this amuses visitors, who are
of course, entirely unauthorized, and they linger and talk to the
parrots and are frequently indignant when asked to clear off.
Last year our Grey Parrot laid two clutches of eggs on the floor
of her cage--one of the usual 18-inch square type--and incubated
them assiduously. Naturally these were abortive as she had no mate,
but we decided to take advantage of her exemplary behaviour pro-
vided she laid at the same time as the Amazons. " Polly 55 would
not tolerate any form of nesting material for her eggs ; wooden
nest-pans and shallow boxes of peat, sand, and rotten chips were
tried, but she laboriously removed the lot or pushed them aside.
Again she laid this Spring, rather earlier than usual, but it coincided
with the Amazons nesting in their flight (which is only about 18 feet
long with a nest-box outside ; they seem to prefer to climb though
both are excellent fliers when so inclined), so we put our intention to
exchange the eggs into operation ; there was little to lose, anyhow, as
sure enough they started to plough the field three days after incubation
should have started.
Collecting the Grey's eggs was a simple matter, she never minds
anything I do to her, and when the eggs were removed she just got
up on the perch and had a good feed. She really was not perturbed,
and seemed to be quite confident that I would return the eggs un-
harmed in due course. Getting the Amazon's eggs was quite another
matter altogether. The box was outside the flight, covered externally
with an asbestos sheet in case the birds whittled their way right through,
a task well within their powers, as they strip a three-inch perch in a
day and soon finish it altogether ; but strangely enough they have
had this same nest-box for seven seasons and have scarcely damaged
it beyond enlarging the entrance hole. After several attempts to
manoeuvre the birds away from their box, we finally succeeded in
stuffing a sack in the hole from the top of the box and removed the
eggs with a long-handled ladle, replacing them with the infertile
Grey's eggs. There were only two Amazon eggs, their usual clutch
being three. These were duly given to " Polly " on the thickly sanded
floor of her cage in the living room on 27th May, when she promptly
started incubating closely. Meanwhile the Amazons carried on as
in previous years. The hen duly retired to the box, but the cock was

so aggressive and demonstrative that she was constantly coming off
to see what all the bother was about. On 16th June, she was off for
quite a lengthy period, and after the usual ceremony of the cock
knocking her off the perch, I decided to have another look. She had
laid a third egg which was again removed. I had taken the pre-
caution of marking the eggs, which were almost identical in size
and appearance. The Grey's were possibly a little more rounded,
but it would have been most difficult to distinguish them with any
degree of certainty. This occurred during a very hot spell of weather
when the Amazon was sitting very lightly, in fact almost appeared to
desert for a few days, although she brooded every night. It is possible
that these birds, coming from a very hot climate, might well rely on
the heat of their surroundings to keep their nest warm for quite
lengthy periods during daylight hours, and this may account for their
unsatisfactory results in this country in other years.
" Polly " sat very closely in the corner of the room we used daily.
She was perfectly friendly and normal, and used to come off and
feed regularly every morning when her bowls of food and water were
renewed. She still liked to have her poll scratched, and once this
was done, she immediately settled down to her task once more, and
was left undisturbed for the rest of the day. This was exactly as she
behaved on other occasions.
Mr. Arthur Lamb has recorded that when he bred an Amazon the
incubation period was twenty-one days, so we calculated that these
eggs were due to hatch any time after 19th June. About this time
" Polly " started to soak her breast and thigh feathers each morning,
and since she did not resent my help, the eggs were floated in a bowl
of warm water for a few minutes. One sank and the other two floated.
I have not found this a reliable method of determining whether the
egg will hatch or not, but mention the fact for what it is worth. The
Grey immediately returned to her eggs when they were replaced.
On the 22nd the eggs were again submitted to this treatment, and
on this occasion there was a most definite movement in one of the
floating eggs and I could hear a definite tap from the interior. On
Sunday the 23rd, one egg had a clearly visible chip, and I could hear
the young bird squeaking inside the shell. Shortly before midday,
whilst I was out, the first little Yellow-cheek broke through. It was
assisted by the foster-mother who very carefully cut the top out in a
small circle, so that the young one wriggled through a hole leaving
the shell in two clean pieces. Of the other two eggs, one was clear
and one addled in the early stages. It is therefore assumed that
the latter was the egg removed on 16th June, which had been spoilt
by the unreliable sitting habit of the Amazon hen, and that the
fertile egg was removed on 29th May, together with the infertile
one. So the incubation period was twenty-five to twenty-six days.

E. N. T. VANE REARING THE YELLOW-CHEEKED AMAZON 1 87
The African Grey was entirely calm and unperturbed with her
accomplishment, she behaved like an experienced mother, never in
the least worried but obviously very pleased with the result of her
patience. She brooded the chick very closely, making no attempt
to feed it for the first twenty-four hours, although she repeatedly
cleaned it. She moved it about by lifting it bodily by the head. She
was supplied with the usual seeds, bread and milk with Abidec added,
also soaked brown bread, with sprouted seeds and greenfood, which
she enjoyed and consumed in increasing quantity as the youngster
progressed.
We now had a unique opportunity to observe exactly how a parrot
sets about rearing its young, as the whole of the operation was carried
out oblivious to our close interest and observation. The parent
bird was completely absorbed in her task, and did not resent our
presence in the least. The first feed was given on the second day.
The young bird was first lifted bodily by the head, and the point of
the parent's upper mandible was then gently inserted into the small
gap of the youngster's mandibles right at the rear as shown in sketch i.
She then trickled liquid down her tongue into the opposite side of the
baby's mandibles. Once the young bird started feeding thus, this
procedure was no longer necessary and as soon as the mother clucked,
the young one instinctively raised its head and gaped ready to accept
its food. Taking the tips of the mandibles in her beak the mother
then applied the usual pumping action of regurgitation and one
could actually watch the young one's crop fill out (see sketch 2).
At this stage feeding was carried out with unfailing punctuality every
two hours. The consistency of the crop milk was about the same as
that of ordinary milk. For practically the whole of the first two weeks
the Grey brooded continuously, but thereafter left the nest for a
while for longer and longer periods. Feeding intervals were slowly
increased to three hours, until six weeks had passed, when the meals
were increased in frequency, but decreased in bulk. During this time,
too, the consistency of the food was also thickened. By this time the
young bird was becoming very intelligent and knew full well that every
time mother had something to eat, it would get a taste, and it was not
backward in asking for its share.
At about ten days, the eyes began to open and quills began to
appear. At this stage we were a little apprehensive that the difference
in colour might upset the mother. We need not have concerned
ourselves, however, as " Polly " was a most attentive and competent
parent. The floor of the cage became littered with seed husks, but no
attempt was made to clean it out for the first month in case she
resented it. I was in fact away at the time, and no one else dared put
a hand inside the cage, this applied whether she had a youngster or
not. At a month old, the squab resembled nothing more than a dirty

looking pin-cushion, and was extremely awkward-looking and ugly,
but " Polly 5 5 thought it was the loveliest thing that ever happened,
and she spent hours cleaning it.
The young one grew rapidly, and as the feathers opened out the
young bird was deliberately taught to preen itself and was always in
spotless condition. The plumage was complete at seven weeks, exactly
similar to the adult bird's, except that the flight and tail feathers were
not fully developed. The young bird was just over eight weeks old
when it first succeeded in climbing on to the central perch--an age
at which it would normally have reached the stage of peeping out
of the nest hole. Its bill was blackish on the upper mandible, yellowish
at the edges and towards the point. The eye was dark and the feet
grey. On its breast it has a few yellowish feathers. The fact that its
plumage is similar to the adult was interesting, as according to some
accounts, many Amazons are reputed to be all green when immature
and to assume full colour when a year or more has passed.

Year after year numerous members inform us either that they have
had a good breeding season or that they are satisfied with their results.
I am afraid we are never completely satisfied--but we are ourselves
mainly to blame that our results fail to come up to our expectations,
because we keep far too many birds. We seem to have a faculty for
accumulating them !
During the winter all the pheasant pens and pigeon flights were
entirely rebuilt, the passage at the back of the main aviaries was
reconstructed and divided into six compartments, and a Caique house
with flight was built. It now only remains to overhaul completely the
main aviaries, but that is a project we do not view with equanimity.
Last winter was, of course, comparatively mild, and our losses
directly attributable to the cold were remarkably few. We did,
however, lose our Egyptian Plovers, a Natal Robin, a Black-headed
Sibia, and a Golden-breasted Bunting--all these in the wilderness
aviary.

Few of the parrakeets made any great success of such attempts as
they made to breed. The Pennants produced their usual brood, but
whereas in the previous four years the young have left the nest in full,
adult plumage, the four young this year were somewhat undersized,
mottled dark green and red. All the Lovebirds increased their kind,
but none of our pairs may be described as prolific. The Noble Macaws
laid three eggs, but scattered them at an early stage of incubation.
The colony of Lineolated Parrakeets just holds its own, a brood of three
late in September making up for earlier losses.
The Red-faced Lovebird colony, numbering thirty-four, is a con-
tinual source of interest. Last year's success when one young one was
reared has not been repeated, but it is not yet too late.
A few new birds have been added to the wilderness aviary : Hilde-
brandt's Starlings, Chinese Hawfinches, Pekin Robins, and Red-
collared and Yellow-backed Whydahs. Here the Common Mynahs
reared broods of two and one ; the former very rickety, the latter a
perfect bird. Purple-headed Glossy Starlings had several broods, but
only succeeded in rearing one young one which was later scalped.
Many Zebra and other small finches leave the nests, but the majority
quite unaccountably disappear--presumably falling victims to some,
as yet, undetected predator.
The numerous pheasants, quails, bantams, pigeons and doves, both
domestic and foreign, continue to thrive and, in the main, increase.
Our one real success, the breeding of the Green Imperial Fruit
Pigeon, made up for any disappointments. The young one hatched on
1st September (see page 148) left the nest on the 22nd, and is as fine
a bird as the first reared. We now have fourteen of these somewhat
voracious pigeons, seven Green Imperial, and seven Pied Imperial.
The latter laid fourteen or fifteen eggs, but failed to hatch any.
The most important recent arrivals are four Black Bronze-winged
or White-capped Ground Pigeons (.Henicophaps alhifrons schlegeli)
brought from the Am Islands by W. J. C. Frost. At present they are
very travel-stained, but eventually they should prove to be very
handsome birds.
The bird-rooms at present house seven White-bellied and four
Black-headed Caiques, five Senegal Parrots, one Mayer's Parrot, one
White-winged and three Canary-winged Parrakeets, three Black-
cheeked Lovebirds, and one Greater Hill Mynah. Amongst our house
parrots we suffered the loss of our favourite Grey " Cocotte ", a
venerable and very talented " lady " well known to many members
of the Society.

A NEW MUTATION OF THE GOLDEN PHEASANT
(&apos;Chrysolophus pictus luteus)
By Alessandro Ghigi (Bologna, Italy)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.986611025" page_id="56318279"  page_num="190" year="" vol="">
Adult Male. --Crest golden yellow slightly lighter than in the typical
form ; rest of face, chin, throat and sides of neck, light yellow ; cape
orange with the two steel blue bars as in the Golden Pheasant ; mantle
dark green, with the lower portion of each feather yellowish ; lower
back and rump golden citron yellow ; central tail feathers pale
brown dotted with light yellowish ; other tail feathers irregularly
barred with pale brown and yellowish ; upper tail coverts same
colour as central tail feathers in the lower web, with the upper web
yellow ; scapulars yellowish tipped with brown ; tertiaries and their
coverts dark brown ; secondaries and their coverts barred with
more or less dark brown ; primaries light straw yellow ; all body
feathers yellow, lighter in the middle of abdomen and on the lower
thigh ; tail-coverts yellow. Iris, wattles, and bare skin around
orbits yellow ; beak and legs yellow horn.
In substance, the more remarkable differences between this mutant
and the typical form are the total substitution of a yellow colour for
the scarlet, a dark brown for the blue of the wings, a citron yellow for
the rich yellow of the back, a pale brown for the black of the tail
and wing-feathers, and the straw yellow primaries. Crest and cape are
the same as is the visible portion of the green mantle.
Young male. --General surface colour straw-yellow, very slightly
barred with pale brown in all sections. On the sides of head yellow
orange shades are noted. Wing and tail feathers have the same
pattern as the typical form, but are extremely light-coloured with
alternative bars or lines of brown and straw yellow.
Adult female. --Same pattern as in the typical form, but the general
surface colour instead of being buff barred and mottled, more or less
plentifully with black, appears straw yellow, barred and mottled with
brown, more or less pale according to the specimens and to the
sections of the body considered. Primaries and secondaries, pale
brown barred crosswise with straw yellow.
Chick. --Creamy white at birth ; as soon as the epitrichium of the
filoplumes has split the mottling appears the same as in the normal
chick, but in much lighter shades.
Origin. --The mutant male, first of the race, was brought to me,
already adult, by Mr. Alexander Hampe from Coburg, in 1952.
Having had an inkling of the matter through an advertisement issued
in an avicultural journal, he thought I would be interested, and
brought it to me. I was not able to obtain information about the place
of origin, but it seems to have been in Bavaria.

Breeding .--In the spring, 1953, a young normal golden female
mated with the mutant did not lay eggs ; in 1954 an offspring of the
usual colour resulted, whence it was shown that the mutant sire was
recessive. Two heterozygous females of this generation were mated
with their sire ; I entrusted Professor Taibel, Director of the Experi-
mental Poultry Station of Rovigo, with one heterozygous male and
two heterozygous females.
In 1955 my heterozygous hens produced normal heterozygotes and
recessive mutant homozygotes in the same proportions ; Professor
Taibel obtained in Rovigo 75 per cent normal dominants and 25 per
cent homozygous recessives.
In the spring of the following year, 1956, it was confirmed that the
mutants are homozygous, as both my young mutant specimens and
those from Rovigo (Taibel) exclusively produced mutants.
My breeding was not very successful in 1956. The old cock, maybe
because of the terrible cold suffered during the winter, did not fer-
tilize the eggs of the first brood, but all the eggs laid by the hens
mated with the young male were fertilized. Furthermore, various
accidents caused the death of some chicks during the rearing season.
Anyway, excluding the first of the race, we now possess two adult
males and three adult females, three year-old males and six year-old
females. Altogether we have, the first of the race excepted, five adult
males and nine adult females. I have sent one adult male and two
young females to the Zoological Garden of Rome ; furthermore,
last spring, I shipped a pen formed by one male and two females,
all heterozygous of the usual colour, to the Zoological Garden of
Copenhagen, from where I have not yet had news concerning an
eventual mutant offspring.
Some further observations may be added :
(1) The adult male, that lives now in the Zoological Garden of
Rome is not perfectly similar to the sire ; some feathers of the throat
show a brown edging, so that the bird appears to have a small collar
in the throat.
(2) The plumage colour is not of the same richness in all the female
specimens ; some have darker bars compared with others. One must
consider that the first mutant cock, arising from normal forms, may
carry some multiple factor, to which a further variability is due.
The above facts will be the subject of careful control in the next,
!957, breeding season.
Note .--In this breeding season (1957) I have reared about fifty
mutant chicks.

By Karl Plath, Curator of Birds (Brookfield, Ill., U.S.A.)
" What's new at Brookfield this year ? " This question can be
heard every year, for each year a new attraction is added for the
benefit of the public. Last year an Okapi, before that the Otter
Grotto, modernistic but attractive, before that the enormously popular
Children's Zoo, a flock of the delightful, tiny Fairy Penguins (about
i o inches high), a generous gift from one of our benefactors, Sir Edward
Hallstrom, of Sydney, Australia, then from the Ueno Zoo in Tokyo
came Emperor and Adelie Penguins. So now we have the extremes
in size of these fascinating birds, for the lovable little Fairy Penguins
scarcely weigh 2 pounds, while the largest of our three Emperors
(about 4 feet high) weighed 80 pounds on arrival, and feels like a sack
of sand when one bumps against it. Comparing the Emperor with the
smaller King Penguin shows that the former has much more bulk,
while the slimmer King which is about 10 inches shorter weighs
on an average of 35 pounds. The Emperors, Kings, Adelies, and
Humboldts occupy a large, glass-fronted cage about 30 feet across
and 10 feet deep, with a glass-fronted pool almost as large, where
they disport themselves with abandon. This enclosure is kept at a
temperature between 50* and 6o*, usually 54 0 (fahrenheit), with
germicidal lamps for germ-proof atmosphere and filters for pure air.
The Fairy Penguins are kept in winter in one of the wall-cages (about
15 feet long), and in summer are active in one of the larger pools.
But this article is to tell members of our latest remodelling--that of
the Perching Bird House which attracted considerable attention about
ten years ago in the making of a series of " picture-cages ", twenty of
them along the east and west wings of the building. These are metal-
framed, glass-fronted cages and are used for individual specimens
best kept apart, such as the toucans, hornbills, several birds of paradise
(also gifts from Sir Edward), and others. Now the effect is a long
gallery of animated pictures, the subjects living birds behind their
glass fronts. The lights are in the cages, and the passage dark. A large
double door is at each end, but the main entrance is at the centre
of this long gallery. When the visitor enters here he sees at first, or
is aware of, large glass cages on each side of the door with numerous
colourful small birds but he is mainly attracted to the huge " Freedom
Room " which confronts him. This has no wire, no glass, and a portion
of the picture gallery floor of beautiful terrazza extends into this open
aviary. This has a railing to prevent the visitor from stepping down
into it. In former years this large room had thirty-three wire-fronted
cages all around it and a medium sized flying-cage in the centre.
The alteration was started early in 1956, and opened to the public

on Christmas Day, 1956. The construction is of stainless steel and
plate-glass, and the effect is very elegant.
This main room has been transformed into a garden of exotic plants
and flowers. There are three trees with bare branches for perching
and a tall hollow tree in one corner partly hidden by a large date
palm. There is more than one ground level--a little pool in a corner
at the top trickles into a larger one below it, and that again flows
into a large pool which overflows by means of a gurgling waterfall
into the largest pool immediately in the foreground beneath the rail.
Umbrella plants, banana plants, anthuriums, various aquatic plants,
and many kinds of flowering plants border these pools and add to the
tropical effect.
To keep the interest below there are several striking aquatic birds--
Scarlet Ibis, Jacanas, Stilts, Crocodile Birds, a pair each of Mandarin
Ducks, Formosan Teal, and several others. These birds are content
to stay in the water or on the ground, with the exception of a tame
and fearless Sun-Bittern which often perches on the rail and sometimes
tolerates a little petting. In the trees and flying all about are other
beautiful birds--gorgeous rollers, motmots, Quetzal, barbets, touracos,
and a brilliantly red Cock-of-the-Rock which often flies into the
gallery. Several other birds do this, Giant Whydahs, Long-tailed
Starlings, tanagers, Vermilion Cardinals, and some others, but all seem
content to fly back and enjoy this brilliantly lighted bird paradise. The
great skylight 30 feet above protects the birds from flying up against it
by being covered with plastic waffle-like panels. There are four double
400 watt lamps in the wall above, not too noticeable, and several
more lamps set below the floor under the railing beneath the floor.
All of this light in the big cage makes the gallery comparatively dark,
so that most of the birds are happy to stay in the open-front aviary.
This improvement has worked wonders with the public, who are
delighted and amazed when a brilliantly plumed Quetzal or touraco
fans their heads as it swoops by. Seemingly the birds have never been
more enjoyed.
Of course we had to consider the nature and habits of the birds
that were to be at large, and they had to be compatible. We knew
that the jays and other large omnivorous birds would not be desirable,
nor would most of the seed-eating finches which would also nibble
at the plant life ; so for these classes of birds there are other large
community glass cages, to accommodate various jays, oropendolas,
tree-pies, Australian butcher birds, and two smaller cages housing
the larger orioles, tanagers, and grosbeaks. For humming birds,
Sunbirds, and callistes we have twelve comparatively small cages, as
most of these species do best kept separately. Our most interesting
humming bird to date is the very tiny Vervain from Jamaica. Gener-
ally speaking, it is our opinion that sunbirds do better ; they are

equally beautiful though, of course, do not have the rapid wing-beat
of the hummer.
Our Parrot House, while one of the Zoo's older buildings, still houses
a good collection. One outstanding member is a beautiful Guilding's
Amazon (from the Bronx Zoo), and in all we have forty-six species
(240 individuals) in this building. We are fortunate in being able to
keep all of these parrots outdoors from May to October, and have had
good luck in breeding many of the larger Australian psittacines as
well as others ; outstanding being Grand Eclectus, Grays, and Roseate
Cockatoos--unusual for this latitude.
Later on we hope to do an article on the varied species in the
beautiful Aquatic House ; we did do something on this years ago,
but many rarer specimens have been added.

There are from one to five of each of the above birds in this
" Freedom Room ". We did try a magnificent Racket-tailed Drongo,
but the first thing he did was to snap up two tiny Painted Quail, and
he was removed pronto. We would like to mention here what I think
is the longevity record of a Spiny-cheeked Honey-eater which lived
from May, 1934, until December, 1956. With such a record, I would
not trust his safety with other birds, nor would I do so with a Hard-
wicke's Green Bulbul received in October, 1936, and still in perfect
plumage as was the Honey-eater.

By S. T. Johnstone (Slimbridge, Glos., England)
In the ten years that we have had a collection at Slimbridge,
107 forms of wildfowl have nested, and of these 100 kinds have
been reared. Whilst a number of species have been reared for the first
time in Europe, perhaps our greatest contribution to aviculture has
been the re-establishment of the Hawaiian Goose ( Branta sandvicensis)
from the three birds presented to us by Mr. Shipman in 1949. Fifty-
five birds have been reared, representing an estimated third of the
world's population. Twelve have been reared by Mr. Terry Jones at
Leckford, in whose care we placed a pair of birds some three years ago.
Bearing in mind the possible loss of the Slimbridge flock from epidemic
causes we have established pairs at our Peakirk branch, at Cleres,
and with Mr. Schuyl at Rotterdam ; a pair has been returned to
America under the care of Dr. Dillon Ripley. The Hawaiian Goose is
probably the world's second rarest bird, and consequently the Trust
is very proud of its effort in the attempt to save this beautiful goose

196 S. T. JOHNSTONE-NOTES FROM THE WILDFOWL TRUST
1957 has been far and away our most successful breeding season.
No doubt the improved breeding results were aided by the glorious
weather of May, June, and early July, so that by the time the bad
weather of August arrived the maj&apos;ority of the young birds were fully
feathered and past danger.
But we must record a new method of feeding the young birds. All
were reared entirely on dry Turkey Starter crumbs, and certainly it
would seem that this had a very beneficial effect, not only on the
numbers reared, but also on the rate of growth. Over 750 birds have
been reared, representing 75 per cent of those hatched. The figures
are as follows :--

Failure was recorded with the Bewick's Swan (\0x25A0 Cygnus columbianus
bewickii ), the first clutch of five eggs being spoilt when the sitting pen
was disturbed by the many visitors who came to the New Grounds
this summer. The second clutch of eggs were unfortunately infertile.
A further disappointment was the loss of nine of the fourteen Ne-ne
that hatched, owing to a heavy burden of tapeworm. On the other
hand, the Magpie Geese (. Anseranas semipolmata ) have been extremely
successful : six birds have been reared by foster mothers and a further
five by the parent birds.
The Australian Grey Teal {Anas gibberifrons mathewsi ) has been
reared for the first time, and two drakes and a duck have been added
to the collection. The Ringed Teal ( Anas leucophrys ) did very well, and
we have added thirty birds to the original stock.
From our own point of view the most interesting species that we
were successful with was the Smew ( Mergus albellus). We have had a
wild-caught female and three males at Slimbridge for the past six
years, and although in recent years the female showed signs of getting
" heavy " it was not until 1957 that she nested. In a small barrel
some 2 feet from the ground the first egg was found on 12th June,
closely resembling that of Carolina (Aix sponsa) in size, colour, and
texture. Altogether five eggs were laid. A large amount of down
was pulled after the third egg. The parent bird was allowed to sit
on the eggs for the first ten days, and they were then removed and
incubated under a bantam in the normal way. The incubation period
lasted twenty-six days, and all five eggs hatched, the ducklings being
extremely like young Golden-eye {Bucephala clangula clangula ), the
downy pattern being identical. Two ducklings soon fell behind and
died, but the remaining birds thrived. Their early diet was fresh-
water shrimp with trout fry, the fry being increased in size as the
birds grew. Turkey Starter crumbs were also given, and when the

All three birds are now well established.
At Peakirk, some nine miles north of Peterborough, we have laid
out eleven acres of Waterfowl Gardens, and established a collection
of seventy-five species of swans, ducks, and geese. Here a promising
start has been made with breeding waterfowl, and 146 birds of fifteen
species have been reared.

By Sir Edward Hallstrom (Sydney, N.S.W., Australia)
Perhaps the most interesting experience I have had this year has
been with the Golden-shouldered Parrakeet. The cross between the
Golden-shouldered and the Hooded has proved to be fertile, and some
youngsters from this cross are now fully matured. I have tried to
cross the Golden-shouldered and the Many-coloured Parrakeet ;
I found that the older Golden-shouldered male would have nothing
to do with the Many-coloured females. It then became necessary for
me to rear youngsters of both birds together and now, after several
years of waiting, I have three pairs that I feel quite sure will take up
housekeeping in a very short time, as the males are already driving
the females. My stock of Golden-shouldered Parrakeets has increased
to fifteen pairs plus a few extra, odd males. Young Golden-shouldereds
barely a year old have gone to nest, and have reared youngsters.
The cross between the Hooded and the Many-coloureds apparently are
infertile. I have had at least a dozen pairs go to nest, without pro-
ducing a single chick.
Some of the interesting birds I bred last year were some Red and
Blue Macaws, Red and Yellow Macaws, Blue and Yellow Macaws,
and more Glossy Black Cockatoos. One Banksian Cockatoo was
completely reared by hand from the day it was hatched. Its mother
took no interest in the baby ; we undertook the job for her.
There were four Red-bellied Conures, four Cactus Gonure crosses,
as before, a great many African Lovebirds---Fischer's, Peach-faced,
Masked, and Nyasa. Five African Grey Parrots, with three more
babies in the nest at the moment, and three baby Gloncurry Parrots.
For years I have wanted to breed the Gloncurry, but never seemed to be
able to get a female. At last I have three females, and to-day one pair
are sitting, a pair only a year old have gone to nest, and another nice
pair have mated and are very interested in the nest-box.

igB SIR EDWARD HALLSTROM- 1 957 BREEDING RESULTS
Several years ago I sent out a very carefully planned expedition
and procured some Blue-cheeked Rosellas ; two pairs, one of which
are only twelve months old, are now sitting on eggs. I had never seen !
Blue-cheeked Rosellas before. They are not even mentioned in 1
Cayley's book, What Bird is That ?, but they were recorded by Gould.
1 hope that within a week or two I will have established the first I
breeding record.
A few days ago, on making a check through my nest-boxes, I found j
many young Eclectus Parrots, a number of eggs, and a great many S
of the commoner Australian parrots. I have also two pairs of Yellow- j
winged Conures. There are at the moment five pairs of Macaws sitting I
on eggs.
I have another interesting youngster in the nest, about twelve days
old at the moment--a Ribbon-tailed Bird of Paradise (Taenia paradisea
mayeri ). This, of course, is the first to be bred in captivity, and I am I
glad that the credit goes to me. They are in an aviary with quite }
heavy undergrowth. The female chose a very thick privet bush in
which to build. She was supplied with ample nesting material, and j
built a nest quite 9 inches across, cup-shaped, the middle of the nest \
is no more than 2 inches deeper than the rim.
It took quite a long time to understand the mating habits of these j
birds by actual observation. Mating usually takes place after an ;
attractive display by the male, and in the case of my birds, of which;
there are two more pairs sitting at the moment, was finally completed
on the ground whilst the birds were locked together by the feet in j
such a manner that caused me to misunderstand the mating for
fighting, which perhaps delayed my success with this particular species.
After mating, the male takes no further interest in the female, the |
nest or the youngster. Special food, a mixture of fruit and yolk of
egg, was supplied, with a small handful of mealworms. The male
apparently has respected this food and left it entirely alone, eating s
only the standard Bird of Paradise food that is provided in the
ordinary way.
The aviary is about 30 feet long, 9 feet wide, and 7 feet high. The
whole of the floor is concreted ; along either side of the aviary is |
planted privet, and other shrubby plants, in beds 12 feet long. These
were built up from the concrete some 18 inches, leaving plenty of
soil for the privet. The rest of the aviary was covered with leaf which
soon became mould ; the mould is allowed to build up to between
2 and 3 inches ; this becomes a wormery, as literally thousands of!
earthworms breed in this litter. It is necessary, of course, to keep it
moist every day, for the worms to thrive. The female turns the i
leaf over, and she is to be seen quite regularly pulling worms out of
the leaf mould which she completely swallows and later regurgitates
as food for the baby. Around the roots of the privet I throw large

numbers of termites daily, and also supply large white grubs, giving
the parent a wide range of food from which to choose.
The youngster when hatched was a shiny black, quite ugly. It
is now twelve days old, and pin-feathers are beginning to become
apparent. When I found that this creature had been hatched, I got
in touch with the Australian Museum, and in a few days, when it is
safe to do so, Dr. Keast is being sent out to observe the baby, so
that the record of this breeding can be verified.
The position in which the bird has the nest, in dense foliage, pre-
cludes photographs from being taken for the time being. I would hate
to disturb or frighten the mother and perhaps prevent the very nice
extra feather in my avicultural cap.

An African Grey Parrot hen and a Timneh cock which I purchased
in the spring of 1956 laid four eggs on the floor of the shelter. They
sat for about four weeks, but the eggs were not fertile.
This year I stood a hollow log on the floor of the shelter and they
soon went to nest, four eggs were laid and both birds stayed in the
nest all the time except for feeding. About the 27th June young were
first heard, three of the eggs hatched and for the first two weeks, due
to the very hot weather, neither of the parents brooded in the day
time, but both did at night. Two of the young had black beaks
the other a white one. The next three weeks were very wet and both
birds brooded night and day, the cock Timneh coming off now and
again to get food which consisted of apple, hemp, and monkey nuts,
and though sunflower seed was offered little was taken, but very
large quantities of water were drunk. During the sixth week the young
one with the white beak died. The following week the parents only
brooded at night and the young started to get feathers on head and
wings. Three weeks later, when the young were half-grown, another
one died and I can only put this down to suffocation at night as both
parents brooded at night. Food taken was as before but now more
sunflower seed was eaten, the parents were still brooding at night and
this continued until the surviving young one left the nest-box when
13 weeks old. It has a reddish brown tail like the Timneh cock.

This year I have had young Bourke's, Elegants, Turquoisines,
Barraband's, Pileated, Red-rumped, Crimson-wings, blue Ring-

necks, Stanley, Rosellas, hybrid Brown's X Yellow Rosella, and
Queen of Bavaria's Conure. Princess, lutino Ring-necks, yellow Red-
rumps did not breed.
The nesting of the Bavarias is the most amazing result for the pair
are not perfect specimens. The male is a pinioned bird, and the
female has a flight impediment, and though she flies it is with some
difficulty. Accordingly it is all the more surprising that on ist July
I found the female on three eggs. As the pair go in and out of their
nest and use it for a play-pen most of the time, I had not realized
that they were nesting. She had not been noticed spending any special
amount of time in the nest. It was my impression, on ist July, that
the three eggs were fresh. On 4th July it was 104 degrees in the
garden, despite large, shady trees. Noting the female was off, and had
been off almost continually during the day, I took a quick look-see.
The initial impression was dismay, for broken egg-shells were in
evidence. Then, as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness in the
interior of the box, two small bits of fluff and one egg could be seen. !
It had been my original impression that the broken egg-shells had
indicated that they had used the eggs as toys, but what elation to find
they had actually done the right thing and incubated them !
Despite an almost 100 per cent conviction on my part that the
parents would refuse to feed, or murder the chicks, or the box would
fall to the ground, or the weather would cook the chicks, the birds I
have continued to thrive. Since then the third egg has hatched, and
the chick has grown apace, so that there is very little difference between
the three in size.
The weather has been the greatest worry. The summer has been
the hottest in several summers, and since ist July there has not been
a day with a temperature of less than 80 degrees, and several days
with the temperature over the century mark. Still, the parents and
chicks are doing well, so one should not worry, especially since it must
be very warm in their native habitat.
Both parents apparently feed the young and have from the first.
The male spends the night in the nest, which is about 18 inches by
18 inches by 3 feet high. The box is hung under a shelter. The young
are quite noisy and, while the parents are feeding, their calls can quite
easily be heard at a distance of 50 feet.

D. M. WEST-BREEDING OF THE QUEEN OF BAVARIA'S CONURE 201
The female is the more aggressive bird, but does not appear to be
too upset when an inspection of the box is made. As the box is at eye
level, I do not have to touch the nest, but can look directly in and see
the young. Inspections have been made each week, and on very hot
days when the temperature has been in the go's or i oo's, an inspection
is made daily for fear that one of the young might have died and the
smell would cause the parents to quit the nest.
Food : The parents are surprisingly unimaginative. They are very
fond of fresh corn on the cob, and will eat at least three large ears of
this a day. Formerly they were very fond of orange and apple, but at
present they do not eat much of them. Grapes are flung to the ground
in disgust, and ditto pine nuts. The only seed they eat in quantity
is sunflower and a little oats. Canary and millet are almost totally
ignored. Greens are not much appreciated. It is obvious that the
most important article in their diet while rearing young is the fresh
corn. It is surprising to me how often they go to the water bowl to
drink. Apparently they are a species that requires an inordinate
amount of water while rearing young.
At the age of some thirty-five days the young were just beginning to
show pin-feathers in the wing and tail. Now, at the age of six weeks
they are almost fully covered with feathers, and quite large in size.
Still, it would be my guess that they will be at least another three
weeks in the nest. While they were without feathers their body colour
reminded one of the body colour of young lutino or albino parrakeets--
quite pinkish.
This is not a first breeding for the U.S., but must be the second
recorded breeding. Previously in California the Sun Conure went
under the name of " Golden " Conure, and for this reason several
people have, erroneously, been given credit for breeding the Queen of
Bavaria's Conure. Some gentleman in Louisiana has bred the Queen
of Bavaria's Conure and has reared three, although I believe he helped
the parents and hand-fed the youngsters from time to time, although
this fact certainly should not detract from his accomplishment. It is my
understanding that the adult pair and one of their youngsters have been
purchased by Mr. Rudkin, Junr., and are in his collection at Fillmore.
I believe that the youngsters will emerge from the nest with their
plumage streaked with green. Mr. H. Zelenko, of New York City,
has told the writer that a Bavaria in his possession laid eggs while
still in immature (streaked green) plumage. Does this indicate they
mature early, for somewhere it seems to me I've read that mature
plumage is assumed at the end of the first year ? This has been the
case with the young bird reared in Louisiana, for it was in full adult
(clear yellow) plumage by the end of fifteen or sixteen months.

202 D. M. WEST-BREEDING OF THE QUEEN OF BAVARIA'S CONURE
Postscript:
At the end of the tenth week the youngsters left the nest. The
youngest of the three birds left the nest too early, and daily would
end up on the ground. This necessitated my replacing him in the
nest every evening, and the following day the process would be
repeated. This discouraging situation finally resulted in the removal
of this bird from the aviary, and hand-feeding " him I believe this
bird to be a male, as it is very brightly coloured.
The remaining two youngsters were replaced each night in the
nest-box for the first week after they came out. After the first week,
however, they have been able to find their way back to the nest each |
night by themselves, and at the present time the parents and the two
youngsters all sleep in the box together and without any fighting.
The young began to eat by themselves about the third day after
leaving the nest. The parents take very good care of them, and
constantly hover about the youngsters, even at this late date.
(23rd October, 1957.) The youngsters are quite reluctant fliers, and
prefer to crawl about rather than fly, though when forced into it
they fly very well.
The parents are now back again mating regularly, and appear
somewhat interested in the nest-box. However, the colder weather is !
coming upon us, and I doubt that their present interest will be !
long-lived.
It should be added that the two youngsters living with their parents
have the same terrible galaxy of cries and yells that their parents have.
The four birds greet each new dawn with a full assortment of terrible
shrieks and cries . . . about the only drawback to this wonderfully
coloured bird.

The fourth of the B.B.C. Television Service's " Zoo Quest " expedi-
tions set out in June, this time for the Central Highlands of New
Guinea where David Attenborough and Charles Lagus stayed at
Nondugl as guests of Sir Edward Hallstrom, filming the animal
life of the Wahgi and Jimi Valleys and later visiting the Bismarck
Mountains. Sir Edward's fauna station at Nondugl is, as members
know, in the care of Mr. F. Shaw Mayer, who, it will be remembered,
brought a number of rare and beautiful Papuan birds to London
before the war. The collection brought to the Zoo by David Atten-
borough in October called to mind those far-off days, for it contained
thirteen Birds of Paradise, the largest number to be exhibited here
since about 1940. These came from the large aviaries at Nondugl as
a present from Sir Edward, the complete list (those new to the Collec-
tion marked with an asterisk) of his gift being : --

It will be noticed that the common names used for some of these
birds are adaptations of the specific or sub-specific name, as the case
may be. The reason for this is that these particular races appear to
have no separate common name.
Some of the Birds of Paradise are still in the immature plumage.
The Superb is the one described by Iredale as L. superba addenda ;
I am not sure if this is an accepted name, but if so, the sub-specific
name minor given above can be corrected later.
A great deal should be written about this magnificent collection,
and it is hoped, if all goes well, to publish more detailed notes with
photographs, though, as we all know, only coloured plates can do
justice to Birds of Paradise.

Attenborough had to take the collection (which, of course, also 1
included some mammals and reptiles) to Rabaul, by sea to Hong i
Kong where he stayed with Dr. Searle, and thence by air to London.
On the same plane came a pair of Chinese Starlings presented by
Dr. Searle and a Javan Brahminy Kite and a Siberian Ground Thrush
given by Mr. G. H. Newmark.
A Tengmalm's Owl that flew on board one of the ships taking part
in the N.A.T.O. exercises off the Lofoten Islands has been presented ;
also a Duck Hawk or North American Peregrine (Falco peregrinus \
anatum) which flew on to a grain ship off Baffin Island. The Duck
Hawk is the first to be received here. A Red-fronted Woodpecker J
was sent as a present from Mrs. D. Seggar, who has previously given j
various birds collected in British Guiana, and a Bronzy Sunbird has I,
been received in exchange.
Cormorants that nested on the imitation cliff in the Southern
Aviary and reared two young earlier in the year have now re-made j:
their nests in the trees, using the old materials.
Editor&apos;s Note .--With regard to the " common names " given to the
Birds of Paradise in the above Notes, it is difficult to understand
why it is considered necessary to do this. It should be emphasized that j
these so-called " common names " applied to rare exotic species,
which are most unlikely ever to become common birds, have no real j
significance. For many years the Zoological Society of London, as in
the present instance, seems to have invented " common names " by j
translating the specific or sub-specific name into the nearest English t
equivalent. This practice has never been followed in horticulture
where the internationally accepted Latin name is retained for all rare I
species, and there would seem to be no real reason for departing ;
from this generally accepted procedure. In addition the translation j
of such " common names " into other languages is liable to lead to
confusion which could never arise if the correct nomenclature had
been maintained.

Exchange and Mart Scheme
Members often have odd birds for which they are unable to obtain
a mate. In order to facilitate the exchange of such birds the Council
have decided to inaugurate this scheme.
Any member who wishes to take advantage of the scheme should
send to Mr. C. M. Payne a postal order for 5,5., and particulars of
the bird required or for disposal. If Mr. Payne has a record of such
a bird from another member he will advise both members, who will
then be in a position to communicate with each other. It is not the
intention that the Society should take any part in the negotiations.
The payment of $s. will entitle the member to the benefits of the
scheme until the 31st December, 1958.
Mr. Payne's address is : The Malt House, Barford, Warwickshire.

Mr. and Mrs. R. E. Darnton were unable to show " Birds, Beasts,
and Butterflies of Equatorial Africa 55 as notified to members, because
this film has not yet been completed. Instead, they showed " Tobago
and nesting Flamingos in the Caribbean ".
Mrs. Darnton has provided the following summary :--
" We spent last winter in Trinidad, Tobago, and Bonaire, and our
film opens with various scenes taken round the lovely coast of Tobago
and of the even more lovely hills and valleys of the island itself. When
we were there, these valleys and hillsides were aflame with the
spectacular flowers of the Erythrinas grown for shading the cocoa,
and from many of these trees hung the long, pendulous nests of the
Crested Hang-nest (Ostinops decumanus) whose activities we filmed.
" We also found a Hairy Hermit Humming Bird {Glaucis hirsuta
insularum) attaching her nest with cobwebs to the tip of a hanging
palm frond--a difficult subject for the camera, as the nest was only
lit for ten minutes or so in the early morning. Unfortunately this lack
of good lighting formed a problem throughout Trinidad and Tobago,
as many of the most beautiful birds of these islands, such as the Red-
capped Manakins, the Mot-mots, the Jacamars, and the Trogans,
are birds of the shadows, and so are impossible to photograph satis-
factorily.
" However, when we went to Bonaire this problem did not arise,

for instead of dense, tropical vegetation and tall forests, we found
comparatively desert-like conditions--only trees and plants resistant
to a very low rainfall being able to survive. Here in this tiny island
we were fortunate in finding a colony of the Rosy Flamingo ( Phoeni -
copterus ruber ) actually nesting. This was extremely lucky for normally
they do not nest until May, and we were there in early March. In
fact we found several thousands of young birds of various ages already
running about in great, grey flocks, while some of the adults were still
sitting on eggs. This species of flamingo is undoubtedly the most
beautiful, and is said to be also the rarest. We were so entranced by
their beauty that we used to get up at 5 a.m. every morning so as to
be at their feeding grounds just after dawn. To live almost among
these lovely birds as we did for a fortnight, we felt was indeed a
privilege we shall never forget."
The Chairman said he had seen numerous films of flamingos,
but never one to equal the present. Judging by the applause, this
opinion was obviously shared by the large audience. These are
really worthwhile films, and Mr. and Mrs. Darnton are to be heartily
congratulated on the results of their recent visit to the West Indies.

The Whooping Crane is very close to extinction : only twenty-three
are known to remain in the wild, with three in captivity. Both in
1955 and 1956 the pair in the Audubon Park Zoo, New Orleans,
laid eggs and hatched young, but they soon died. This year the pair
has again hatched young--this time it is to be hoped with better
success.

" I have excavated earth mounds of the Megapodes, where they lay
their eggs. I have succeeded in hatching two eggs in a cupboard,
heated by a lamp burning day and night. I have thus had an
opportunity of observing the very interesting and curious hatching.
The chick kicks itself out of the egg and is able to fly as soon as it is
dry. At present I have two chicks nearly two weeks old."

Robins are almost through their first moult. There are five splendid

young Red-winged Blackbirds are also doing very well and one young
cock is already learning to display its scarlet shoulder tufts.
Zosterops had a magnificient little nest, entirely of plant fibres, but,
unfortunately, the two eggs appear to be infertile. The swarms of
fruit and other flies which we " created " in anticipation of the arrival
of young Zosterops have greatly delighted the Tree Frogs, and their
response might lead one to think that I have the B.B.C. Male Voice

When the Society was founded in 1894 the annual subscription was
fixed at 55. Four years later, in 1898, it was raised to js. 6 d., and in
1900 to ioj. And so it remained until 1918 when it was increased to #1. &apos;
It has now stood at this figure for 40 years !
The Avicultural Society is the only society of similar standing that ,
has not increased its subscription during the recent, semi-inflationary
years. But if the very high standard of the Magazine is to be main-
tained without an increase in the annual subscription the Society's
income must be increased. This may best be done by the members ;
themselves. They must make every possible effort to propose new *
members. No amount of energy on the part of the Officers can make
up for apathy in this respect. And please remember that donations to
the Coloured Plate Fund are always very welcome !

ORNAMENTAL WATERFOWL. By Lieut.-Col. A. A. Johnson [
and W. H. Payn. H. F. and G. Witherby, Ltd., London, 1957.
Price 21 .s', net.
Though wildfowl are very popular and a large number of books
have been published, especially in recent years, on this group of birds,
there have been comparatively few on keeping them in captivity, j
Rose Hubbard was the first to produce such a book, entitled Ornamental
Waterfowl , which was published in 1888, with a second edition in
1907. After an interval of a quarter of a century A. F. Moody's book
on Waterfowl and Game Birds in Captivity appeared in 1932, and this was
followed in 1933 by J. C. Laidley's comprehensive work on The Care !
and Propagation of Ornamental Waterfowl. Unfortunately all these books
have been out of print for some time and are most difficult to obtain,
so that those who wish to start a collection of waterfowl have been at
a great disadvantage. The appearance of the book under review is
therefore particularly welcome and the authors have dealt with their

subject in a straightforward and simple manner which will be of
particular use to those wishing to make a beginning in this
fascinating branch of aviculture. The first chapter is on starting a
collection and contains a list of some of the more attractive and less
expensive ducks which are particularly suitable for beginners. The
second deals with fencing, planting, and pond construction, and the
book continues with chapters on general management of the collection,
nests and eggs, hatching and rearing, plumage and moults, and ail-
ments and diseases. Then follow descriptions of some native and exotic
ducks and the geese and swans.
The necessity of making sure, by actual observation, that the
ducklings are eating is pointed out, but the authors do not give in-
formation, as does Mr. Laidley, on methods of ensuring that the young
birds do take food.
Emphasis is laid on the importance of winning the complete con-
fidence of ducks and geese from the start and the great value of always
talking to the birds when feeding or walking among them. That the
authors carry out what they preach is shown by the instance quoted
of a wild White-fronted Goose belonging to one of them which ate
bread from the hand within six weeks of being captured, and which
now likes to travel about sitting in the front seat of a motor-car.
The fact that each time there has been a special Waterfowl number
of the Magazine the issue has sold out is evidence of the great interest
there is in this group of birds and this latest book should therefore be
in great demand. As the authors state : " There is, in fact, no reason
at all that anyone who is interested in waterfowl should not keep at
least a pair or two even if they have only the smallest of gardens or
nothing more than a backyard."

Though as the author, who is Curator of the Department of
Ornithology in the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, states in the
introduction, the scope of this book is approximately indicated by its
title, it has been necessary to establish a rather precise boundary
along the southern perimeter to serve as a threshold in determining
what forms to include or exclude. Accordingly the boundary has
been established as a line running along the treeless coasts of Yukon
territory and Mackenzie District east to Bathurst inlet and thence
south-eastward to Eskimo Point on Hudson Bay, across that Bay to
Portland Promontory on the east coast ; thence eastward to Ungava
Bay and along its treeless coast to Cape Chidley. All species known to
occur, or which have occurred north of this line are included.

In describing the nature of Arctic birds the author points out that
it is not correct to assume that they are exceptionally hardy. He states
that among the more relentless factors enforcing adjustment among ;
Arctic birds is time, especially for migrants, and there is an urgency j
in courtship, laying, incubation, and growth of young. He also
points out that the Arctic is stern and insistent, discouraging the
development of frills and non-essentials such as crests, wattles, spangles,
and complicated rituals, and Arctic birds are plain and unembellished.
In describing the nature of Arctic bird populations he states that
the best established generality is that they are notoriously unstable
as to numbers and much of the instability is attributable to weather.
The Arctic has been virtually unavailable to birds of arboreal habit
and nearly half belong to one Order the Charadriiformes.
Attention is drawn to the fact that the knowledge of Arctic birds
is very meagre and a number of points requiring detailed study are
outlined. A key to the Orders of Canadian Arctic birds is given,
followed by a section on habitat as an aid to identification. The main
part of the book is devoted to accounts of seventy-two species of ten
different Orders, which include status, habitat, and characteristics,
with map. Additional names have been selected from the literature
to include those which may be in use locally in the North, and Eskimo
names for particular regions are given. In many cases there are
excellent pen and ink drawings by T. M. Shortt.

I think this may be the first time that yellow Masked Lovebirds have been bred
in this country. There is perhaps some doubt as to whether they are in fact pure
Masked Lovebirds. John Yealland, when he saw mine, expressed the view that
they had Peach-faced Lovebird blood in them. However, contrary to the expressed
opinions of more knowledgeable aviculturists, I still think that they are a delightful
mutation, and I see no reason why in time by careful selection they should not be
bred completely yellow with the very attractive bronze face. I have seen a con-
siderable number of this mutation, and they vary in the intensity and clarity of
the colour considerably. The pair which I have bred this year are very attractive.
A newly-imported pair of Turquoisines are at the moment sitting on five eggs.

Nesting of Pileated Jays
My pair of Pileated Jays fortunately went to nest in mid-July, 1956, in a small
aviary 12 feet by 4 feet, the shelter being 4 feet by 4 feet.
As they seemed to be playing around with nesting material and stripping the
various growing plants and creepers in their aviary, I put an old Magpie nest in the
shelter, never thinking that they would breed, but with the object of giving the plants
a chance by diverting their attention. Great was my surprise two days after placing
the nest to find an egg, not unlike that of our Magpie, in it. Two more eggs followed in
the course of the next four days. The hen seemed to do all the sitting. In fact I never
saw her off the nest, and the cock fed her. On the sixteenth day one youngster was
hatched. When I looked about four days later the three eggs had hatched. Both
birds appear model parents, but the cock did all the feeding. On collecting meal-
worms or maggots he would first feed the hen. She would then raise herself and the
cock would feed one of the youngsters ; he would repeat this until all were fed.
Incidentally, I was not standing in the aviary shelter while this was taking place ;
their aviary was one of a range, and I could observe this from a small passage dividing
their shelter from the next.
As at this time we were very busy on the land, I had not the time to collect beetles,
grasshoppers, etc., of which they are very fond, so they had to make do on soft food
and fruit, with mealworms and maggots as the only live food. I think perhaps this is
the cause of the failure to rear them. On the seventh day I found one of the babies
tucked away in a bush in the flight. A couple of days later the second one was placed
in the same spot. The last one was still alive and apparently lusty on the sixteenth
day, but as I could hear no feeding noises on the eighteenth, I flushed the hen. This,
the last hope, was dead, although there was food in its crop. Never having seen a
young Jay before, I couldn't really say, but my impression was that it was on the
skinny side. The pair are nesting again now, so perhaps they will have better luck
this time. They certainly deserve it, as both proved such good parents. As I have
said before, the only conclusion I can come to is that perhaps the cause of failure was
something lacking in their diet. However, we will see what happens this time#

Breeding Results at San Marino, 1957
Members may be interested to hear how some of my birds did this year. This
season, after an unsuccessful attempt last year, I was able to rear one Black-chinned
Yuhina. Two young were hatched but one died. The survivor has been removed
from the " glasshouse aviary " to avoid the possibility of its being killed by the
parents. An interesting attempt was made by a Mountain Tanager male and a
Red-eared Tanager female. They built a nest in a spruce tree but as far as I know
no eggs were laid. As I am now out of the navy and will be back in Los Angeles
next year I am planning to remove these two Tanagers and give them a planted
aviary to themselves. A hybrid from them should be a truly magnificient bird.
I also reared five young Grey-headed X Brahminy Mynahs. I would like to state
that the Grey-headed X Pagoda Mynahs referred to in my article (page 47) were,
in fact, the present cross. Brahminy Mynahs are often advertised as Pagoda Mynahs,
hence the confusion, but they are not the same.

THE DRINKING HABITS OF DUCULA SPECIES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8886971" page_id="56318307"  page_num="214" year="" vol="">
I have seen the Green drink in the wild state, and had both Pied and Green drink
in captivity.
I have not seen them drink whilst standing on the ground with open feet. Like all
the fruit pigeons they do not care for walking. The ones I had in captivity drank off
perches, the water being placed within reach. Birds in aviaries had overhanging
branches. They sidled down the branch until they could reach the water.
The common Bengal Green I have seen settling in huge numbers on the lower
branches of a peepul tree ( Ficus religiosa ) until the branch touched water. Other
fruit pigeons more normally settle on dead branches sticking out of the water. The
Green Imperial are, of course, tree-top dwellers and very rarely come down to the
ground. I should think they would get plenty of water, high up, which had been
caught in broken branches. If my memory does not fail me these pigeons drank at
dawn and dusk. I succeeded in breeding the Green while in Calcutta.
Stuart Baker mentions that some natives believe the Green Pigeon only comes
down to drink where no perches are available, if it has a branch clasped in its feet.
I have been told this by villagers in Bengal.

BREEDING OF CRIMSON FINCHES (. NEOCHMIA PHA&amp;TON)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965525928571428" page_id="56318307"  page_num="214" year="" vol="">
This summer we were fortunate in breeding three young Crimson (Blood) Finches
(JVeochmia phaeton ). The parents nested in a covered flight, producing five eggs,
the first about the 19th July. The young were hatched on 5th August, and three
left the nest on the 25th and 26th August. A fourth was found dead at a very early
age, and one egg was broken. We separated the young from their parents on the
12th September, as the first egg of a second round was laid on that day, and the
young were being prevented from returning to the nest, which was usual until then.
The three young are very fit indeed at time of writing (25th September), are medium
brown in colour, slight crimson diffusion over back and wings, crimson tail, underside
brDwn, flight-feathers dark brown, belly and thighs light brown, beak black.
The birds were very insectivorous, being fed gentles, once or twice ant eggs, and
some mealworms, with plenty of chickweed and home-made sponge cake. Ideal
parents, with the cock doing most of the incubation and much of the feeding.

A DIRECTORY OF BIRD RINGING
A world-wide directory of bird ringing is proposed to be published by The Ring ,
an international ornithological bulletin devoted entirely to bird ringing and bird
migration studies. The avicultural rings will be included in this directory besides
the rings of ornithological schemes, carrier pigeon associations, etc.
I should be most grateful if readers of the Avicultural Magazine could assist
us by sending information and addresses--home and abroad--of all possible, even
the smallest institutions, organizations, clubs, businesses, and individuals issuing
their own rings for cage-birds. Samples of rings are essential, and would be greatly
appreciated.
AH communications and information should be sent to The Ring, 1 Altyre Road,
