It is not much longer than a year since Harry Horswell died after
being secretary of the Avicultural Society for almost twenty years.
Now the Society has sustained another grevious loss in the death of
Harry's wife, Mary Harvey, who had served the Society for the same
length of time, first as Assistant Secretary and, from 1981, as Editor
of its magazine. She died in February after a long and debilitating
illness. Many of us remember her as the tall, attractive girl whose
charm and gracious manner complimented Harry's good humour
to make the social events of the Society so very enjoyable. We
also remember how hard she worked to maintain and improve the
literary style, format and content of the Avicultural Magazine. She
will be sadly missed.
The secretarial affairs of the Society are now in the capable hands
of Geoffrey Greed and I have agreed to take on the editorship of the
magazine. Although Mary had been ill for a long time her death
occurred suddenly and unexpectedly. She had been more seriously
ill than anyone appeared to realise and consequently her editorial
activities had become a severe burden with which, sadly, she was
coping only with extreme difficulty. Many letters were unanswered
and some manuscripts were lost and so I should be grateful if any
member who has submitted material for publication, the receipt of
which has remained unacknowledged, would write to me.
Already, I have become acutely aware of one of the problems
which have confronted editors of the Avicultural Magazine since its
inception almost a hundred years ago and that is the scarcity of
suitable material to fill every issue. I hope to broaden the spectrum
of interest of the magazine by including as many interesting
avicultural news items as possible and by incorporating articles on
the bird collections in the many zoos and bird gardens which now
exist. There must be many members with interesting news to record
about their birds and so I appeal to everyone to contribute something
to the magazine. Although the Society organises numerous enjoyable
social events, its membership depends mainly on the interest and
success of the magazine. To remain financially viable we must attract

would be a tragedy if the Society were to fold up now within a few
years of reaching its centenary.

Mary Harvey, editor of the magazine since 1979, will always be
remembered by many members of the society for her charm and the
welcome she always extended to everyone. Her presence at virtually
every social meeting over the years helped to ensure the smooth
running of each event and to integrate new members into what is
surely one of the finest societies for Aviculturists in the world.
As an editor, Mary was outstanding, maintaining the very high
standards for which the magazine is known worldwide. Always
courteous and understanding, her's must have been a very
considerable task to mould the work of so many writers into the very
particular style which has always set the Avicultural Society of Great
Britain's magazine apart from all others throughout the world.
To so many of us, there was only one "Mary", she will be greatly
missed.

BREEDING CHARMOSYNA PLACENTIS,
THE RED-FLANKED LORRIKEET,
IN A SMALL INDOOR AVIARY
By Dulcie Cooke (Epsom)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998992138888889" page_id="56269467"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
Until recent years the Red-flanked Lorrikeet, Charmosyna
placentis was not frequently imported into the U.K. Recently,
however, there have been several importations of members of this
species. Joseph Forshaw in "Parrots of the World" describes
five subspecies, of which Charmosyna placentis ornata has a greater
spread of red down the sides of the breast than some of the others.
For those who are not familiar with these delightful members of the
Charmosyna group of Lorrikeets, a rough description may be of
interest. The length is about 6 3 ,4&amp;quot; (17cm) the weight approximately
F/ 20 Z (42g). The sexes are dimorphic, so much so that at first it is
difficult to realise that the very beautiful green hen with her huge
gold-streaked ear patches belongs to the same species as the
flamboyantly coloured male. The body of the male is a uniform deep
green which admirably sets off the colouring of the head which is lime
green on the forehead and crown. The brilliant scarlet cheeks make
a perfect contrast with the huge violet ear patches. The bend of the
shoulder and sides of the breast and flanks are a vivid scarlet, the
rump is dark blue and the undersides of the tail are orange, red and
black. The bill is scarlet, the legs orange-red and the very large eyes
are orange-yellow. The female, as described above, is green all over
with exceptionally large ear patches of bright gold streaked with blue-
black. The young are like the female but males show some red
around the face from a very early age.
These birds inhabit the Moluccan Islands in Indonesia, parts of
New Guinea and Islands in that area as far as the Bougainville
Islands in the Solomons. In their various native homes, they frequent
mainly lowland forest areas, going in groups from one flowering tree
to another. They have also been observed in Coconut plantations. In
Papua New Guinea they have been seen in highland areas at about
1150m. In the Southern Moluccas flocks have been observed visiting
coastal areas. In their wild state these birds nest in arboreal termitaria
or in giant ferns.
Until recent years this lovely bird was considered difficult to adapt
to life in Europe, and was an extreme rarity. Rosemary Low states
in her book "Parrots, their care and breeding" that Mrs S. Belford
imported a pair in 1977, and since that time these birds have been

bred here, in Europe, in the U.S.A. and no doubt in many other
parts of the world as well. Possibly improved conditions for birds
during transit from their original areas to their many avicultural
homes in various parts of the world have greatly improved their
chances not only of survival, but also of a healthy, happy life and the
successful reporduction of their species. They certainly do seem to
take rather longer to adapt to conditions of housing, food,
temperature etc than some other Charmosynas; for example, the
beautiful little Fairy Lorrikeet, C. pulchella, seems to come sailing
through all sorts of conditions which would be too much for a Red-
flanked to endure.
In the summer of 1989 my husband Freddie and I obtained a pair
of Red-flanked directly from an importer. They were in immaculate
condition and appeared to be fairly young. They have remained in
this excellent state of health ever since. However it must be said that
they were kept at a permanent temperature of 74*F for the first year
and there were times when the cock used to sit looking "puffed up",
then quite suddenly he would shake himself and go back to his sleek
immaculate appearance.
The birds were established in a small indoor birdroom with a
window facing south and an airbrick high in one wall which was
partially screened by a pocket shaped plywood screen. The lighting
consists of a low watt ordinary hanging electric light with a shade,
this is on night and morning and acts as a "dimmer". The real lighting
comes from a four feet Tru-Lite strip light, which is switched on for
12 hours per day. In exceptionally brilliant sunshine in the summer
it is sometimes switched off for a few hours. The advantage of Tru-
Lite (used for aquaria) is that it's spectrum of light is such that the
birds are able to synthesize Vitamin D3 which enables them to make
full use of their calcium intake, required for egg laying, bone building
etc. Heating is supplied by means of radiators using the house central
heating, on twice per day, morning and evening and set at 68-70F.
When this is switched off a Convector electric fire takes over, it is
thermostatically controlled at 68*F.
The aviary-cage which the Red-flanked inhabit measures
approximately 5&apos; long by 2&apos; deep by 3&apos; high (about 1% x %m x 1m
high). Two pairs of double doors, one above the other, service this
little aviary. The roof is plywood at the back, and twilweld in front,
the sides are half plywood and half twilweld mesh (in front). The
back is plywood. The framework is constructed of finished l&amp;quot;xl&amp;quot;
wood. The back and sides are lined with white Formica for reflected
light and ease of cleaning. The floor is of thick ply to give stability

and the rather deep trays are of aluminium. The depth allows a layer
of wood shavings to be used as a floor covering where necessary. In
fact most of this floor is covered with newspaper of which some parts
are renewed daily.
This aviary stands on a 3&apos; (1m) high table with a Formica top,
which has been specially constructed as a base. Underneath the table
is useful storage spare. The perches are of W (1.27cm) dowelling,
and there are always a few small branches or twigs of hazel nut fixed
between the wire front and one of the perches. The aviary faces west,
so gets a lot of sunshine in the summer months. The nest box, which
is high up near the right hand pair of doors faces north. It is 7&amp;quot; X 7&amp;quot;
x 12&amp;quot; deep (18cm X 18cm x 30cm) and has an inspection door which
faces the top right hand service door, so it is quite easy to see what
is going on in the nest. The box contains a very small ladder. The
nesting material is a small quantity of brown peat at the bottom of
the box with about 4&amp;quot; (10cm) of soft wood shavings. These are quickly
broken down by the birds to a flat "platform" and the nest is most
of the time scrupulously clean.
The birds had slept in the nest box almost from the start of their
lives here but it was not until the spring of 1990 that they showed
serious signs of going to nest. Where many imported Lories and
Lorrikeets quickly became ultra tame, the Red-flanked, although
"steady", were always extremely nervous of visitors. This was
unfortunate because some later additions to the birdroom in the form
of a pair of Red-spotted Lorrikeets, Charmosyna Rubronotata
housed in the opposite (east facing) aviary caused considerable
interest amongst our visitors. Unfortunately this proved too much for
the Red-flanked, and although no visitors had been allowed to enter
the room but only to view the Red-spotted from the open door, the
Red-flanked decided that was just too much, and they deserted the
two large white eggs which the hen had laid.
With this experience gained, all visitors to the room were banned,
the door being tightly shut at all times. After a period of nearly three
months the hen laid again, and yet again I experienced a nervous
time after the one quick look to establish that there were in fact eggs
again in the nest. She did not return to the nest for a day and a half.
Eventually, much to my relief she went back to the eggs, and the
cock stood guard on top of the box. In 25 or 26 days, the faint cries
of a very tiny baby could be heard, but I did not dare to investigate.
Quite a lot of nectar was consumed at this time and also some of the
dry food which all our Lories and Lorrikeets receive fresh daily.
When I judged the baby to be about three to four weeks of age the

inspection door to the box was opened one morning when both
parents were out of the nest, which in the case of the hen was not
often at that time. In one corner of the nest box was a lively little
bird sitting over an egg which was clear. This was left with the baby
since it formed a very useful "hot water bottle". The chick was
covered in quills which gave it a very dark green appearance. It was
a very friendly baby and ran about the nest, and at that time called
incessantly to be fed, even through the night, calling expecially loudly
each night at about 1 a.m! At approximately five to six weeks of age
the baby was fully feathered except for the back and front, and had
a very short tail. At a surprisingly early age, (I judged it to be
between six and eight weeks old) the baby emerged from the nest.
It's tail was still very short indeed, and it had golden streaked ear
patches like it's mother. The chick was very friendly at that stage and
allowed itself to be caught and put back in the nest at night for the
first three days. On the fourth day out of the nest towards evening
the baby flew on to the top of the box and a little later disappeared
for the night. From that time onwards the baby bird became very
independent and refused to be caught at night, driving its tired and
sleepy parents mad while it played about! One morning it did allow
me to pick it up to be photographed, but I had to hold it very firmly
because it was so lively.
Young hen Red-flanked Lorrikeet bred in an indoor aviary.
This very clever chick quickly learned where its parents obtained
their food, and started to feed itself, although of course also calling

for food from the parents. Now at over three months of age it has
become obvious that the chick is a hen, no red whatsoever has
appeared anywhere on this bird. She was taken away from her
parent's aviary at approximately three months of age, because they
had gone back to nest. The parents were some of the most attentive,
and later tolerant, I have ever known.
During the time the mother was producing a further two eggs both
the father and the baby hen spent most of their time in the nest box
with the mother. However it was obvious from the squabbles which
could be heard at night coming from the box that all was not well.
One day the baby hen flew desperately towards me several times
when I was changing the paper floor covering, something she had
never done before. She allowed herself to be picked up and I noticed
a tiny mark near one eye where she had been pecked and a couple
of feathers removed, otherwise she was unharmed. The baby hen was
removed immediately to a cage in a room already rather full of young
birds, babies in a brooder and adults who needed some warmth for
the winter and whose aviaries could not be heated sufficiently for
their complete comfort; so some of them were taken out most days
in carrier boxes to their aviaries and brought back at dusk to spend
a warm comfortable night indoors. All this activity from three other
species of Lories and Lorrikeets was an admirable introduction to the
great wide world for the baby hen. She had come from a birdroom
where the temperature is kept now at a steady 68F and she had to
get used to a temperature which varied between about 60F during
the day and about 70F at night when the central heating made the
whole house warm.
All our Charmosyna Lorrikeets receive a small quantity of pure
Australian honey daily. In the case of the Red-flanked it amounts
to about a quarter of a teaspoon divided between two nectar
feeds per day. The nectar fed to these birds consists of about three
heaped tablespoons of fruit or cereal based baby food (usually
Milupa and, if possible, not those contaiing citrus fruits), one
tablespoon of glucose, one teaspoon of Soya Bean Flour (from
Health food shops), one level tablespoon of Muscavado medium
brown sugar, one teaspoonful of pure Australian honey and one level
tablespoon of liquidised peeled carrots and peeled and cored sweet
apple (one medium sized carrot to two medium sized sweet apples).
During the winter and when breeding ten drops of Adexolin (a
proprietary preparation containing vitamins A, C and D) is added to
one feed per day. About twice per week a little finely scraped very
white Cuttlefishbone is added to the nectar. The birds do have

Cuttlebone in their aviary, but unlike some of the larger members of
the Lory family they do not appear to eat it when presented in this
form. The dry food given consists of three tablespoons of fruit or
cereal based baby foods, as above, one heaped tablespoon of glucose,
one level teaspoon Soya bean flour (from Health food shops) one
level tablespoon of granulated cane sugar and one tablespoon of
wheat bran (from Health food shops). This is given fresh once per
day and replaced if it becomes damp or fouled. It does help to
encourage the birds to eat this food to sprinkle a tiny quantity of
granulated cane sugar on top of the mixture. The birds ate some of
it daily when they were feeding their baby, and now she is a regular
daily consumer of this dry food. I usually put a tiny amount of very
finely cut sweet apple in one corner of the little bowl containing the
dry food.
Green food is given fresh daily round the year, usually endive, but
sometimes watercress or lettuce. Occasionally some tiny twigs of
hazel nut with the leaves removed are put in the wires to give added
amusement, and for about nine months of each year a daily supply of
pollen bearing flowers is given to the birds. These can be winter
flowering heathers, roses, wild Honeysuckle (the evergreen garden
type is toxic), forgetmenots, wallflowers, impatiens (busy lizzies)
and the biggest favourites of all, a constant supply of fuchsias. Nut
catkins can also be given. All types of wild flowers have so far been
ignored. Perhaps it would be helpful to point out that all parts of
rhododendron flowers are poisonous, and honey from these flowers
can be very toxic.
The breeding of this little hen has been a delightful experience,
and it has been a joy to watch the devotion of the parents, both to
each other and to their offspring.

Mitchell Park Aviaries has quite a wide variety of birds in its
collection and so every breeding season has its surprises but this
season has, to my mind, been one of the most satisfying. Two species
which have eluded me over the years have bred - the beautiful
Hartlaub Duck Cairina hartlaubi , for the first time in South Africa,
and the Crested Guinea Fowl Guttera edouari.
A colleague of mine imported two pairs of Hartlaub Ducks from
Belgium over ten years ago and offered one pair to us. Our pair was
kept in a thickly planted aviary containing two small inter-leading
ponds and they settled down well and were quite tame. There was a
collection of smaller birds in the aviary, including Pigeons, Doves,
Mynahs, Orioles and Finches. Their diet included moistened duck
crumbles, minced ox-heart, duck weed, chopped lettuce and pond
weed and they could help themselves to the corn mixture supplied to
the Doves, etc. The following year the drake was seen mating with
the duck on the pond several times and we supplied three different
types of nesting logs and boxes at different heights to entice them to
lay but to no avail. They were fully flighted and perched at different
levels in the aviary, but the duck was never seen looking into any of
the logs. This performance went on for year after year - mating, but
no nesting, and the other pair belonging to my colleague behaved in
the same way. They would display regularly to each other and were
inseparable. Vocally the sexes are entirely different - the duck
making a low gutteral quack and the drake a low muscovy-like hissing
sound. Colour-wise the sexes are similar but the duck is a little duller
chestnut and the white spot on the head of the drake becomes a
small, narrow strip of white above the beak of the duck which
sometimes lacks the white spot altogether.
Our Hartlaub Duck died after eight years and my colleague's also
died the year before. So we were left with two approximately ten
year old drakes. An importer in the Transvaal was building up a
collection of waterfowl to import from Europe and I asked him to
keep a look-out for one or two Hartlaub Ducks but, not thinking for
a moment that he would be successful, I also applied for a Veterinary
Import Permit from the South African Authorities to bring one in
from their country of origin - West Africa - but this was rejected. I
understood that they were not readily available from waterfowl

collectors in Europe and were not frost-hardy. So imagine my
surprise when the importer informed me that he had an adult
breeding duck for me and he had imported a young pair for himself.
When she arrived after a month in the quarantine station, I
collected the Hartlaub drake from my colleague, and put him and
my drake (both now over ten years old) in with the duck - all three
together but with some trepidation for they can be very aggressive
and my old drake had already killed a full-winged Ringed Teal drake
which slipped into his aviary through a hole in the adjoining partition,
in two minutes flat. He was also totally intolerant of other ground
birds like Black Crake and Pheasants, but this aggression usually
peaked during the breeding season. There was very little reaction
between the three birds - neither drake attacked the other but after
a week it appeared that my colleague's male was more interested in
the duck than was mine, in spite of the fact that this male had been
in isolation for three years since his mate died. There was no
displaying but the two birds seemed to move around together and so
I took the other male out.
The following Spring I saw the drake mating successfully with the
new duck, and told the attendant to check up on the low duck box
- for this duck was pinioned and so could not reach the higher boxes.
He said there was nothing there and this went on for several weeks
until I got a bit anxious and told him to look into the box again while
I was there only to be told there were three eggs covered over with

leaves. She was so quiet and furtive that although the attendant had
been in and out of the aviary all day, he had never seen her in the
nest box. Their colouring and the fact that they tend to remain
stationary in shadows means that they are often overlooked.
Eventually she went brooding on nine eggs and sat tight. We never
once caught her off the nest so that we could examine the eggs for
fertility. Eventually, after what seemed a very long time, on
approximately the 28th day, we decided to check the eggs and had
to remove the duck from the nest for she attacked your hand while
she was sitting on the nest. We found the eggs now chipping and we
decided to remove them to place them under a broody Bantam hen
to hatch. Five ducklings out of the nine eggs hatched - the rest of
the eggs were infertile. We considered that removing them was the
safest method, thinking that the ducklings would probably be weak,
considering the age of the male Hartlaub and we also had no
experience or knowledge of the maternal instincts of this breed of
duck. The weather that weekend, as often happens with an exciting
event, was atrocious and raining heavily all the time. I preferred to
know that the ducklings were cosy and dry under cover - at least I
could sleep well. In any event, they were large, strong and healthy,
and a comment was made that they looked like young Muscovy
ducklings with their longish bodies and distinctive black eye streak,
and probably were - and this by the jealous colleague who imported
the Hartlaub duck! His young imported pair laid infertile eggs and
laid only the one clutch.
Our pair went to nest again within two weeks of our taking the
first clutch away and again we let her sit but this time we removed
the eggs after two weeks and placed them under a broody Pekin
Bantam hen. The Bantam hen hatched eight Hartlaub ducklings -
one eggs was infertile - and she reared all eight.
With this brood we tried a new high-protein diet in addition to the
regular foods and this caused some variation in growth and two or
three had dropped wings, which was corrected, when we realised
what the problem was, and we withdrew this food. We understood
that the Hartlaub Ducks are high protein feeders in the wild and the
first brood of five ducklings were particularly active in darting around
their pen catching flies but this behaviour was not noticeable in the
second brood. However, apart from a balanced duck-growth food
and minced ox-heart, we gave them regular dishes of small fish
(guppies) as additional protein and these they consumed avidly. But
in all we found the ducklings easy to rear and did not need tempting
to feed.

Summer was now nearly over and we were very satisfied with
13 healthy Hartlaub ducklings but still the adult pair had not
commenced to moult. Imagine our surprise when the second brood
under the hen were three weeks old, the Hartlaub duck was seen in
the same nest box again and we discovered another three eggs. She
laid a third clutch of nine eggs and then went broody and this time
we decided to let her sit the full time and rear the ducklings, if any,
herself. She hatched nine ducklings. The weather now was getting
colder at night and the aviary they were in did not get a lot of sun,
so we caught up the adult pair and the nine ducklings and put them
in a smaller, more sheltered and sunny aviary to give the ducklings
a better chance for development. She proved a model mother and
the drake was also very protective of the brood and the ducklings are
now nearly three months old and are developed identically in size
and seem on the whole finer specimens than the other two broods
(reared under hens).
Of course the last brood were swimming around from day one
whereas the other two broods reared by the hens were only
introduced to batheing when they were feeding well at about ten days
old and were fully water-proofed at three weeks old - and this activity
alone could vary development. So in all we reared from the one pair
of Hartlaub Duck 22 healthy ducklings., To follow up, a young duck
from the first brood of five hatched is now pairing up to the old drake
of the original pair and they are just beginning their courtship display
- so that will then give us a second un-related pair of Hartlaub Ducks
for breeding.
We left eight ducklings full-winged - the others we pinioned - and
the full-winged ones are extremely nimble on the wing for such large
duck and enjoy perching and are obviously highly adapted to thick
jungle conditions. We found full-wing perching ducks generally make
far better breeders when they have the opportunity to nest high -
one example is our Rajah Shelduck of which one full-winged pair
nested four times in one year (1989) and we reared 32 ducklings from
them whereas the same pinioned birds are very reluctant breeders.
We find the same with Ringed Teal, Brazilian Teal and Chestnut
Breasted Teal.
The Crested Guinea Fowl Guttera edouari chicks were easy to rear,
unlike the Vulturine Guinea chicks Aery Ilium vulturinm. The latter
seem very prone to worms and infections.
We were very pleased to rear young S.A. Cape Parrots
Poicephallus robustus for the first time after trying for years with
several pairs, but the main problem with these parrots that springs

to mind is that they are very selective over their partners and one can
sit for years with an adult cock bird and an adult hen together in an
aviary, but they will not pair together.
The hen of one pair in the Park died after many years of not
breeding so I put the remaining pair (also adults but non-breeders)
in together with the remaining cock bird. The following day I had to
remove the cock bird of the pair for I found him very stressed on the
ground and I left the other two together and within three months
they had nested. I believe they are also sociable breeders and you
have more chance if they are kept within sight and sound of other
Cape Parrots.
We also reared three Blue Stanley Crane Anthropoides paradisea
but the Crowned Crane Balearica regulorum were infertile. We also
bred a wide variety of waterfowl and pheasants, plus Sonnerats

PROFESSOR CARL ALBERT NAETHER
April 27, 1892 - January 28, 1990
By Josef H. Lindholm III
Emerald Forest Bird Gardens
Fallbrook, California, USA
On my last visit to Professor Naether, several months before his
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.995859647058823" page_id="56269478"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
brief final illness following a fall, he was exasperated by yet another
refusal by the East German Government to grant a visa to visit his
native Saxony, a trip he planned to make entirely by rail and ship,
as he detested airplanes. On the other hand, he was very much
amused by the receipt of the Deutschmark equivalent of $67.00 from
the editor of Die Gefiederte Welt, for his observations on the nests
of Feral Pigeons in some Santa Monica palm trees which he had
climbed not long before. This typical enthusiasm and gleeful
enterprise is evident in the enormous number of articles and reviews
which he wrote in English and German for many journals and books
on aviculture, photography and rabbit-rearing, as well as in a series
of texts on Business Writing which established his professional
standing as a Professor of Business English.
Carl Naether was born in Tergau. His father was a government
land surveyor who inspired his enthusiasm for natural history by
taking him on frequent expeditions and pointing out interesting
plants and animals. When Carl arrived at his brother's parsonage in
Iowa at the age of eighteen, his command of English extended to
"yes", u no", and "telephone". In 1924, at the age of 32, he was
appointed Professor of English at the University of Southern
California, Los Angeles, after holding teaching positions in Iowa,
Utah, South Dakota, Oregon and San Francisco, and obtaining
degrees from the University of Iowa, the University of California,
Berkeley, and the University of Michigan.
When he was at the University of Southern California he began
augmenting his well-established collection of domestic pigeons with
wild species, commencing with a pair of Diamond Doves. He
eventually developed, with the assistance of Dorothy, his wife for
more than fifty years, an impressive collection, in Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley, where he lived for the rest of his life. Though never
very large, the collection was distinguished by the presence of such
rarities, as the Snow Pigeon Columba leuconota (Naether 1965a&amp;c,
1966, 1973 &amp; 1981a), the Scaled or Splendid Pigeon Columba
speciosa (Naether 1939a, 1940c, 1959, 1961a&amp;c, 1962a &amp; 1973), the

(Naether 1939a &amp; 1940c), the Key West Quail Dove Geotrygon
chrysia (Naether 1962b&amp;c, 1965vb, 1973 &amp; 1974a), and the
Marquesas Ground Dove (Naether 1940c). Professor Naether bred
many species of pigeons and doves and had great long-term success
with some, particularly the Key West Quail Dove and the Jamaican
Mountain Witch Dove Geotrygon versicolor (Naether 1948c, 1960 &amp;
1963a). As is obvious from his publications Professor Naether
observed his birds meticulously for many years and was unusually
assidous in recording his observations. These have been extensively
cited by many authors and especially by Derek Goodwin (1970) on
Scaled Pigeons and Key West Quail Doves.
Professor Naether in his study, June 1989.
Professor Naether's prominence in pigeon and dove aviculture
appears to have obscured the reputation he deserves for an equal
enthusiasm for softbills. His 1955 book, Soft-billed birds, in fact, is
the first American book devoted to the subject. It is now,
unfortunately, very rare, having been long out of print. I am not
certain of the publisher. Professor Naether's softbills were all
Passeriformes. I believe he bred only White-rumped Shamas, the
significance of his softbill aviculture lying more in his maintenance
of mixed collections, with remarkable longevity records. In an aviary
8&apos; x 8&apos; x 16&apos;, for instance, pairs of two species of Yuhinas Yuhina
flavicollis and Y. nigrimenta had been maintained, at the time of
writing (1966b), for seven years, with twenty other birds, such as a

White-capped Redstart Chaimarrornis leucocephalus, a large South
American Thrush and Titmice. Among the more unusual of the many
softbill species of which he wrote in detail are the Canyon Wren
Catherpes mexicanus (1951a &amp; 1952d), the Bewick's Wren
Thryomanes bewicke (1943a &amp; 1951a), the Mexican Blue
Mockingbird Melanotis caerulescens (1940 &amp; 1947a), the Japanese
Robin Erithacus akahige (1936b &amp; 1939c), the Ryukyu Robin E.
koadori (1936b &amp; 1941g), and the Japanese Bush Warbler Cettia
diphone cantans (1936b, 1951, and 1954c).
It will be noted, in the appended list of his publications, that there
is no overlap in the periods during which Professor Naether wrote
for the Avicultural Magazine and the Avicultural Society of
America's Aviculture. I believe the commencement of his Aviculture
era coincides with the reorganization of the Society from a predo-
minately East Coast membership to a largely California one, while
his return to the Avicultural Magazine , of course, coincides with the
merging of the two society's journals in 1951, a situation that was to
last for nearly a decade, beyond which Professor Naether continued
to write for this magazine.
Professor Naether had many close friends in aviculture, among
then Alex Isenberg, Ray Thomas, the president of Columbia
Records, and Henrietta Cohen, of the Southern California Bird and
Pet Exchange. His closest friend was Jean Delacour, who as Director
of Art, History and Sciences for the City of Los Angeles (1951-1961)
worked across the street from the University of Southern California,
at the Museum of Natural History, which then held the City's art
collection as well. Professer Naether's fond reminiscence of Dr.
Delacour, published in this Magazine's 1988 Delacour Memorial
Issue, presents a protrait of the man contradictory to that of a
number of others in that number, but our great past President was,
in the words of Saint Paul, eminently capable of "becoming all things
to all men"! It was my privilege to hear many stories about Professor
Naether's friends. He would sometimes receive an urgent request
from Mrs. Cohen, to come to her shop to identify some "rare birds
from Asia". He would arrive to find Dr. Delacour. summoned for
the same purpose and realize that the reasons for their being there
were as much for retail as for identification. Ray Thomas, with the
wealth of his company at his command, and an enthusiasm often
exceeding the capacity of his aviaries, would just as urgently require
the presence of Naether, Delacour, and K.C. Lint, Curator of Birds
at the San Diego Zoo, to relieve his over-crowded collection of
whatever rarity they wished to take. Professor Naether's favourite

story was of his arrival early in the morning, at Delacour's
Los Angeles mansion to purchase a pair of Bleeding-heart Doves.
Dr. Delacour interrupted the bemused preparation of his breakfast
oatmeal to catch the birds, and with great care, personally selected
and presented to his friend - two males!
Though deteriorating eye-sight compelled Professor Naether to
give up his birds in the 1980s, his enthusiasm for aviculture remained
undiminished. He continued to subscribe to a number of journals and
to maintain close contacts with several people, in particular Donald
Hanover, whose wonderful collection of Indo-Pacific Pigeons and
Doves was not far from the Naether's Encino home. When, in 1989,
a pair of Hanover's Pink-necked Green Pigeons Treron vernans
produced a three-squab clutch (Hanover 1990), Professor Naether
was one of the first to be consulted on what may possibly be the first
recorded set of "triplets" for any pigeon or dove.
The fifty four years of Professor Naether's articles in the Avicultral
Magazine and Aviculture are certainly a fitting monument to a long
and rich avicultural career.

A REVIEW OF THE 1990 AVIAN BREEDING SUCCESSES
OF A MIXED SPECIES RAIN FOREST EXHIBIT

(Aviculturist, National Aquarium in Baltimore)
The rain forest exhibit in the National Aquarium in Baltimore
occupies 519,060 cubic feet and houses 16 species of birds with a total
of 40 specimens in a free flight situation. (Table 1). Other inhabitants
of this exhibit are six reptile species including Iguanas and Basilisk
lizards, 11 amphibian species including Tree Frogs and Poison Dart
Frogs, and one mammal species, the Two-Toed Sloth Choloepus
hoffmani. In it grow over 600 species of tropical plants.
Avian breeding successes for the year included the Scarlet Ibis
Eudocimus ruber , Hawk-headed Parrot Deroptyus accipitrinus ,
Green Aracari Pteroglossus viridis , Red-capped Cardinal Paroaria
gularis, and the Silver-beaked Tanager Ramphocelus carbo. This
paper describes the husbandry and breeding of these species.

After arriving at the aquarium in 1984 from West Germany, our
two ibis pairs bred with limited success in 1986 and 1987. However,
in 1990 they produced more chicks (seven) than in all of their
previous years combined. We attribute this to several husbandry
changes. One of the important modifications made during this time
was to the contents of the birds' diet. Previously, the ibis diet
consisted of two cups of soaked dog chow, three quarters of a cup of
Caradee, one eighth of a teaspoonful of Quintrex Redaxanthin
(Nutritional Research Assoc. Inc.), a feather dye, one tablespoonful
of Vionate vitamins (Rich Health Inc.), one half cup of silverside fish
Marinus marinus. one cup of krill Euphasia superba and two cups of
chopped chicken livers. In the winter of 1989, we changed the diet
by adding two cups of Flamingo Diet (Zeigler Bros., Inc.) and
omitting the chicken livers and the Redaxanthin red, which is an
additive to the flamingo diet. In addition to this diet, the birds have
been observed feeding on softbill food (Table 2) and on live insects
including mealworms, waxworms, and crickets available from
morning and afternoon "bug drops". The birds have also been seen
feeding on Dusky Tree Frogs Smilisca phaeota.
Another difference was in the selection of the nesting site. In
previous years the birds made use of large man-made wire nesting
platforms which had been provided for them in a corner of the forest.

A problem with these sites was that the Sloths frequently used them
as resting places thus interfering with the birds ability to utilise them
for nesting. This year nest building took place on our "epiphyte tree",
a large artificial tree heavily planted with bromeliads, orchids, aroids,
etc. Nest construction began after clearing sites of epiphytic plants
(much to the dismay of our horticulturist). Nesting material consisted
of stripped ficus branches and twigs which we had provided for them
on the forest floor.

Both pairs of ibis nested side by side on one branch with one large
bromeliad Aechmea sp. separating the two nests. These nests were
constructed in early May. By mid-May, both nests were observed to
have eggs in them and both sexes were doing their share of the
incubating. Our first hatching occurred on 26th May with the second
and third occurring on 1st June. The parents reared their young with
no interference from the staff. By late June, the chicks began
venturing onto other branches of the tree and were fully fledged in
early July. By late July, the parents had begun building new nests on
another branch of the same tree and again they were side by side
with one epiphyte between them. On 1st August eggs were apparent
in both nests. Hatchings occurred on 18th, 19th, 21st and 22nd
August. The chicks were again parent reared with little interference.
When the staff banded the second set of chicks in mid-September
they began to fledge early by leaving the nest branch and going into

adjacent areas. The parents continued to feed the chicks away from
the nesting site. Our average incubation time was found to be 21 days
with fledging occurring at approximately 49 days.
The first clutch of chicks was permitted to stay in the forest until
mid-October, during which time no signs of conflict were noticed
between the two sets of chicks or their parents. Unfortunately, some
plant damage did occur due to the intense foraging activity of the
chicks. Unlike the adults, the chicks were seen prodding and
sometimes uprooting epiphytic plants throughout the forest, possibly
looking for insects and tree frogs. The first clutch was transferred to
the service area to await shipment to another institution. The second
clutch remained in the forest until mid-November when they too
were placed in the service area for shipping preparation. Soon
afterwards the parents began their winter moult.

autumn of 1989. Both birds were wild caught. The pair agreed well
but no breeding behaviour was noticed. They were fed a diet
consisting of a parrot seed mix supplemented with fresh fruits and
vegetables, and Nekton-S vitamins (Nekton U.S.A., Inc.). The birds
were placed in the rain forest exhibit in March 1990. At this time
they had access to parrot and softbill diets. By the end of March,
they were observed entering nest boxes resembling the ones to which
they had access in the service area. These boxes measure 13&amp;quot; X 11&amp;quot;
x 26&amp;quot; and were placed about 25 feet above the floor of the exhibit.
Frequent copulation was observed during the following two months.
In early May, three eggs were found in one of the nest boxes. On
16th May, one of the eggs had hatched. Periodic checks were made
on the chick for the next two months. The adults began spending
more and more time outside the nest box towards the end of June
but there was no sign of a fledging chick. The nest box was examined
again on 10th July and the chick was found to be half the size of the
adults. Since we had been informed that the normal time to fledgling
was close to two months, we began to wonder why we had not seen
the chick peering out of the box. Perches and extra nesting material
were placed within the box in the hope that they might aid the chick
in fledging. When this did not occur by 8th August we checked the
box again to discover the parents had laid two new eggs next to the
chick. We removed the chick from the box and brought it into the
service area where is was discovered to have a deformity of the legs.
A third egg was laid but the parents abandoned the nest box soon
afterwards. The eggs were removed and candled and were found to
have no signs of development. In mid-September the parrots began
working on a palm log that had been placed nearly 20 feet above the
walkways on the side of the forest opposite from their original nesting
site. During the period of 23rd September to 17th October the
parrots were observed copulating. The female was seen entering a
palm log which had been previously hollowed by Black Spotted
Barbets Capita niger. Both parrots continued working on the log
creating a cavity with a depth of approximately four feet from the
top and giving it two entrance holes on the side. The male would
stand guard on the top. On 30th October we had not seen the
female for two days and the male was continuing his duty as guard
from the top of the log. On the 31st the log was checked to find three
eggs.
On 13th November both parrots were seen outside the log
consuming a large amount of food including palm fronds which they
chewed frequently. The types of palms used included Madagascar

checked at this time to find three newly hatched chicks. Subsequent
examination confirmed that the chicks were developing normally
without any problems or deformities. They were examined every two
weeks until 26th December when they were found to be fully
feathered and ready to fledge. The chicks began peering out of the

bottom. No nesting materials were added to the log. An increased
amount of mutual feeding occurred and copulation was observed first
on 27th February and again on 1st March. On 9th April, two eggs
were found on the bottom of the log. On 24th April our first hatching
occurred. The parents increased their insect intake during the
morning and afternoon "bug drops". They also had access to softbill
and parrot diets. The birds seemed to prefer the whole fruits such as
blueberries and grapes as well as the dog kibble and were seen
carrying these items to the chicks. Our horticulturist noticed that the
birds also used a number of the plant species within the forest as a
food source. These included the leaves of the Autograph tree Clusia
rosea , the leaves of the Night Blooming Cactus Epiphyllum
oxypetalum , the leaves of the Weeping Fig Ficus benjamina , the seeds
of a bromeliad Aechmea bracteata , and the berries of Anthurium
gracile. After 41 days of development within the log the chick
fledged. The male was the primary feeder of the chick once it had
fledged and within days it was seen eating on it's own. Four days
after the chick fledged the parents were seen copulating. On 22nd
June three eggs were found within their original nesting log.
On 7th July two of the eggs had hatched. The chicks continued to
grow over the next month and on 10th August they were seen
peeking out of the log. The chick from the first clutch was removed
from the forest on 14th August and sent to another institution. The
other two chicks fledged the next day. These chicks were permitted
to stay within the forest with their parents for the following two
months. In late October they were removed for physical
examination. The parents once again began feeding each other,
spending more time in and around the nest log and copulation was
observed late in December. In January 1991, three more eggs were
found in the log.
From these breedings we have found the incubation time to be 15
days with fledging occurring at 41 and 35 days.
Red-Capped Cardinal
A pair of wild caught Red-capped Cardinals was received in
September 1989. After being quarantined, they were released into
the forest on 12th December 1989.
The birds were seen working on a nest in one of the Weeping Fig
trees F. benjamina as early as 7th January. Nesting materials included
palm fibre, coconut fibre, and soft string. The nest itself was small
(5 inches in diameter), cup shaped and usually found nestled between
branches.

Unlike the birds previously mentioned, the cardinals face a greater
threat of predation, nest destruction, and egg stealing by more
aggressive species. On a number of occasions, the Green Aracaris
have been seen actively destroying nests and have been suspected of
robbing them of their eggs. Therefore, much of the bird's time is
spent constructing and moving the nest as necessary due to exhibit
stressors.
Eggs were found in the first nest on 15th January. The female
incubated for several weeks and on 9th February laid two more eggs.
On 18th February, the four eggs were candled. We found the first
two eggs infertile and the second pair fertile. The fertile eggs were
replaced in the nest and they hatched four days later on 21st
February.
The birds became quite bold during our bug drops while they were
raising chicks. The young were fed almost exclusively on insects for
the first week. We allowed the parents to raise the chicks to fledgling
size which takes about 15 days. At this time the nest of chicks was
moved to a small cage within the forest and one or both of the parents
were trapped inside with the chicks where they continued to raise
them without the interference of other species. This also allowed for
an easy removal of juvenile birds from our exhibit.
We did encounter health problems with the use of synthetic fibres
as a nesting material. One chick suffered swelling in its mouth, which
was found to be caused by nylon string fibres wrapped around the
tongue. Once removed, the chick recovered and only natural fibres
were subsequently used in the forest.
This year the cardinals have successfully raised four separate
clutches making a total of seven young. The average incubation time
is 12 days.
Silver-beaked Tanager
For some time, the Silver-beaked Tanagers have been reproducing
successfully. This prolific pair has reared many clutches since its
arrival at the NAIB in early 1988. The habits of the Silver-beak are
almost the same as those of the Red-capped Cardinal with the diet
and environmental pressures being identical. Therefore, the
husbandry techniques for these birds are similar. This year they
produced five clutches for a total of four chicks. We found the
incubation time to be nearly 11 days with fledging occurring on the
12th day. Because of the difficulty in placing this species in other
institutions, they were not encouraged particularly to breed. As
chicks were successfully reared, they became excess surplus stock in

our service area. The staff was not anxious to continue to breed these
tanagers and attempts were made to try and prevent some hatchings.
Techniques to limit the number of hatchings such as "egg shaking"
and water injection into the eggs were performed which explains the
small number of chicks produced during the year.
Summary
The year 1990 was successful for the aviculture section of the
National Aquarium in Baltimore. We can attribute these successes
to a number of factors such as dietary improvements and the
provision of suitable nesting materials. One other recent (July 1989)
modification has been the addition of a fogging system (Mee
Industries). This system delivers a fine water mist to the forest on a
timed schedule in order to maintain the humidity of the forest at a
level of 80%. At times, the humidity level is pushed to 95% and thus
produces the effect of a tropical rain forest engulfed in cloud cover.
A number of species of birds have been observed stationed near the
misting nozzles using them to bathe and as a drinking water source.
Our continued efforts to recreate a natural environment for our
collection have paid off this year with the breeding of five interesting
species.

The Buffons Touraco Tauraco persa buffoni is approximately 16
inches in length. The sexes are alike. The head, crest, mantle and
breast are green. The crest is full and rounded and of hair-like
texture.
In front of the eye there is a triangular white patch under which a
thick black line runs backwards. Below this is a very thin white line,
only visible at very close quarters. The back, rump, tail, wing coverts
and secondaries are glossy violet-purple. The primaries are carmine
with their outer edges and tips black. The iris is brown, the orbital
ring scarlet, the beak brown and the legs and feet are black.
Buffons Touraco is found in West Africa. It is a sub-species of the
Green-crested Touraco Tauraco persa persa which differs from it in
having a thin black line under the eye with a broad white stripe
beneath extending backwards almost to the nape, and its crest tinted
pink at the tip.
I obtained two unsexed Buffons Touracos in October 1988. They
were sold to me as Green-crested Touracos. They had been kept in
an outside aviary for some time and were fully acclimatised. The
birds were placed in a 10ft long X 6ft wide x 6ft 6in high outdoor
flight which was attached to a shed in which they had access to a
roomy flight cage. The shed is kept at a minimum temperature of
55*F and artificially lit to give the birds at least twelve to thirteen
hours of light during the winter months. The touracos were fed on a
variety of fresh chopped fruits, mainly apple, pear, grapes and
bananas plus others in season. They were also given Phebo dog food
soaked in water overnight, chopped and mixed with Bogena
insectivorous food and Vionate multivitamin powder.
The birds soon settled down and were often seen feeding each
other. They were surgically sexed in April 1989 and proved to be two
hens. While I was trying to find a cock bird during the next couple
of months it was brought to my attention that I had Buffons Touracos
and not Green-crested. Apparently, during the previous couple of
years, several other people had been sold Buffons Touracos which
they believed to be Green-crested.
An odd Buffon's cock was obtained during the early part of July.
It was placed in an enclosure running alongside the aviary containing
the two hens which had been ringed for easy identification. Within

two weeks the cock was seen on several occasions feeding one of the
hens through the wire and showing signs of aggression towards the
other which was found a suitable mate in another aviary. During the
next six months several attempts were made to get the two birds
together but on every occasion the cock became very aggressive
towards the hen, chasing her relentlessly within a couple of hours of
their being put together. However, he would still feed her regularly
through the wire.
At the end of April 1990 the cock was allowed into the hen's aviary
early one morning. He immediately tried to feed her. They were
together all day with no problems. From then on both birds roosted
in the flight, usually in an elderberry bush. No aggressive behaviour
was observed between the birds from then on, although they both
showed aggression to a pair of Livingstones Touracos in an adjoining
flight.
Two eggs were found in a hanging basket suspended in an
elderberry bush, on 4th June when both birds commenced incubating
them in turn. Two chicks were seen in the nest on 28th June. On 5th
July a chick was found dead on the floor beneath the nest. It was
covered with thick brown down, not black, as with the young of
White-cheeked and Livingstone's Touracos. The other chick seemed
fine, strong and very alert sitting in the nest. It was seen on a perch
near the nest on 19th July and running around the floor on 20th July.
It still looked brown in colour. On 24th July the cock again began to
show signs of aggression towards the hen.
The chick was becoming very active and was beginning to show
colour and on 2nd August it was seen perching in the inside flight of
the shed. On 5th September the baby was taken away from its parents
because the cock was still aggressive towards the hen. It had been
feeding itself and this seemed an opportune time to segregate it for
its own safety. The adult pair were separated on 20th September
because they were fighting but the cock continued to feed the hen
through the wire daily. At the time of writing (31st October) the
chick is doing well and is showing a lot of colour.

The Duivenbode's Lory, which comes from North West New
Guinea was, according to Rosemary Low, first imported in 1929 but
not again until 1973. Between then and 1988 many pairs were brought
into the country. I purchased a female from Birdland, Bourton-on-
Water in 1985 and this was a hand-reared bird. The male was an
imported bird which I obtained in 1987. This pair of birds laid one
infertile egg in 1989. During the cleaning out of the nest-boxes in my
Lory collection early in September 1990 I found a fully grown young
Duivenbode's Lory which the parents were rearing. The young bird
continued to be fed by the parents, left the nest-box during the last
week of September and is now fully independent.
The parent birds, together with the young, were fed nectar, made
up with Vitafood, honey, sugar, Milupa, Bovril and mixed with hot
water. These and all my Lory collection are fed also with carrots,
apples, pulses and soaked sunflower seeds which are pushed through
the wire of the outside flight cage on to a feeding tray. I find that by
giving them soaked sunflower seeds they do not get the fungus
Candida albicans in their mouths. I realise that many Duivenbode's
Lory have been bred by aviculturists in this country but they have all
been hand-reared. I feel therefore that this is a first breeding and our
Chairman Professor Hodges saw the bird in the nest when he called
on me and can confirm that is was being parent-reared.

BREEDING BLUE CROWNED MOTMOTS

The Blue Crowned Motmot Momotus momata is one of the nine
species which make up this American family. It is the largest species
and the one most commonly seen in captivity. It ranges widely
throughout South and Central America from Argentina to Mexico.
Twenty-one races are represented in this wide distribution. The
sexes are similar. The birds are green to olive brown above and olive
green to dull cinnamon below. The tail is greenish blue with blue
spatulae. The crown, which is surrounded by a broad blue band, and
the sides of the head are black.
We received our Blue Crowned Motmots in August 1981. There
were three birds of unknown sex, which we found later to be two
cocks and a hen. They were released into our Semi-Tropical House,
where they soon settled down well. This house measures 54ft long
by 20ft wide, and has a public footpath along the front. It is well
planted throughout and is provided with a small waterfall and stream
leading to a larger pool. The birds soon became fairly tame and
would come to bathe under the hosepipe. I have never seen them
bathe in any other way. Their diet was a problem at first as they
would take only mealworms. Mice, crickets and locusts were eaten
but were not readily available at the time. A mixture of chopped
fruits, raisins, mincemeat and insectivorous food was offered and
gradually the birds began to take some. However, mealworms still
made up the major part of their diet which consists now of
mincemeat, soaked raisins, grapes, bananas, mealworms, whitebait
and earthworms. Other insects and mice are eaten occasionally.
It was not until 1984 that any signs of breeding behaviour occurred
when the third bird was attacked by the other two. It was removed
before it came to any harm. The other two kept very close and could
be heard calling frequently. Signs of nesting appeared on the aviary
floor in the form of a large crater, which had been excavated by the
birds, into one side of which a hole had been dug upwards. The birds
were allowed to carry on for the rest of that season, but nothing came
of this attempt to breed. During the winter we built a bank into which
they could burrow and we also inspected the burrow made
previously. It was 11 feet long and very close to the surface. It wound
from side to side and backwards, crossing over itself several times
above and below, before terminating in a small chamber.

We hoped that the birds would breed successfully in 1985 with the
new bank in place. It measured 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 5 feet
high. It was not long before they had burrowed straight into the bank
about halfway up. This was as far as they got for they transferred
their attention to the floor at the far end of the house. These
excavations were not acceptable to us particularly when the birds
started digging under the Pygmy Marmoset Cebuelle pygmaea
enclosure for this burrow had to be filled in almost daily. Then in
late March they started back at the base of the bank. They made a
large crater in the floor with a burrow leading upwards and into the
bank. It was impossible to see the entrance without getting on hands
and knees and looking up under the rim. The birds spent six weeks
or more burrowing, not only in the bank but also at several sites in
the greenhouse. Around mid-May one bird could not be seen and
burrowing seemed to have ceased everywhere. The other bird was
usually perched close to and above the bank. The missing bird was
not seen for days and I wondered whether it was dead, sitting or
laying. One morning it re-appeared but the other was missing, so
both birds share incubation. I do not know how long the incubation
period is. Reference books give 17 or 21 days but without my
knowing when incubation started it is impossible to say which is
correct. I started giving them as many insects as we could collect on
the 17th day after the first bird disappeared. Several days later one
bird was seen entering the burrow with a mealworm. Both birds are
very cautious about entering the burrow when feeding. Later both
birds were seen out and feeding started in earnest mainly on
mealworms although other foods were offered. A week later one
adult was seen carrying a dead chick, which looked about ten days
old. Feeding continued and on 14th July two young fledged. Both
were identical to the adults but they lacked the tail racquets. The
adults continued to feed the young for some time after fledging. It
was during this period that I noticed the adults drop to the floor and
catch earthworms. These, after being beaten on a branch, were fed
to the young. This prompted me to offer worms around hatching time
in the following year. They were accepted readily from day one and
were preferred to mealworms. Only the smaller ones were taken for
the first few days after which any size was acceptable.
We were using whitebait for other stock that year. I had seen
African Starlings years ago relishing Sandeels and decided to try the
motmots on a few. Their chicks were about three weeks old when I
first gave them some. These were gone by the next feed and during
the next few days more were supplied. The birds started to leave

mealworms and earthworms, but not entirely. The amount of
whitebait taken that year suggested that they had a large clutch. Sure
enough four fledged over a period of two or three days. Without this
easily obtainable food I doubt if all four would have survived. We
now feed whitebait all the year round but outside the rearing season
only one or two are taken daily. Earthworms and a few mealworms
make up the chicks diet when they are very young. It is not until they
are about a fortnight old that any whitebait appears to be fed to them.
We can almost judge how many young there are by the amount of
whitebait taken by the parents.
Over the past four years we have reared thirteen young from
clutches ranging from one to four. Most references state that the
clutch size is three. We have had two of four, so if food is plentiful
four would seem just as likely. It is also stated that the young are
very vocal in the burrow. We have never heard anything from ours.
For birds nesting so low, if indeed they do in the wild, it would seem
inadvisable to advertise the whereabouts of the entrance, when the
adults are so secretive about it's position.

It is always pleasing to receive the latest copy of Kiwi House
Review, the magazine of Otorohonga Zoological Society. Although
only eight pages, it contains many interesting items, usually
concerning endemic species. The society has been pioneering the
management of Kiwis for several years now and, under the present
curatorship of Eric Fox, has made great strides. The 1990/91 season
was extremely successful with six North Island Brown and one Little
Spotted Kiwi hatching. I have very fond memories of an all too brief
visit to the collection in 1988. Having seen only sleeping Brown Kiwis
previously, the experience of being taken around Otorohunga's
breeding pens after nightfall to see all three species, and to have two
Great Spotted Kiwis reared that year, approaching so close as to prod
in search of worms at the side of one's shoe is a fond memory.

indeed in the U.K. with very few aviculturists reporting a record
year. However, the number of first breedings seems to be high, with
Marsh Harrier, Brahminy Kite, Kurrichane Thrush, White-spotted
Munia, White-tailed Jay, Sumatran Hill Partridge, Buffons Touraco,
Von de Decken's Hornbill and Scaly-crowned Amazon being
recorded. It is to be hoped that articles covering the above events

Two Kakapos Strigops habroptilus on Little Barrier Island raised
hopes of successful breedings when they each laid an egg last year
(1990). It was the first evidence of breeding by this rare flightless
Parrot (only 43 are known to exist) since 1982 when 22 Kakapos were
transferred to the predator-free island. However, although one egg
subsequently hatched, the chick died after about five days. The other
egg proved to be infertile. Since 1974, Don Merton of the New
Zealand Department of Conservation's Threatened Species Unit and
his colleagues have been trying to save the Kakapo from extinction
and in 1989 a $1.5m five-year recovery plan was launched. The
Kakapo Recovery Team has tried to maintain a 'hands-off policy to
minimise risk to the birds, but after the latest breeding failures Don
Merton considers that a more aggressive approach is in order. He
suggests that had he and his colleagues known that a nestling was
sick they could have tried to save it - and had they been aware
another Kakapo was incubating an infertile egg it could have been
removed to give the bird a chance to re-nest. 'The Kakapo is too rare
to leave to its own devices and simply hope for the best,' emphasised

Hopes were high when 13 Bali Mynahs Leucopsar rothschildi were
released into Bali Barat National Park in north-western Bali last
year. Of the group, 11 were from a captive-breeding project run
jointly by Indonesian biologists, the International Council for Bird
Preservation and the American Association of Zoological Parks and
Aquaria; the other two birds had been confiscated from poachers.
All 13 birds had spent a year in pre-release training when they were
housed in a large, enclosed forested area in the midst of their natural
habitat. For several months they were fed through a small door and
during the day had no exposure to humans. Researchers handled
them minimally and only at night. This careful preparation paid-off
handsomely, for jubilant conservationists observed that within two
days of their release eight of the birds were feeding and roosting with
the wild flock.

Three years of research and writing has paid off for Professor Janet
Kear, Curator of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust's Martin Mere
(Lancashire) Centre and, until recently, a member of the Council of
this Society. Her latest work, 'Man and Wildfowl' has been judged
the best natural history book of 1990.
It was selected from all the best natural history titles, published
over a 12-month period, by a panel of judges including wildlife artist,
Keith Shackleton, editor of Natural World , Lynda Bennett,
ornithologist and traveller, James Hancock, editor-in-chief of the
Illustrated London News , James Bishop and environment editor of
Country Life , David Tomlinson.
Man and Wildfowl throws light upon the special relationship that
has existed for many centuries between men and birds. And there
are probably few people better qualified to explain human-bird
interaction than Professor Kear, a world renowned ornithologist who
has worked for more than 30 years to bring people and wildfowl
closer together.

The Enchanting Owl by Connie Toops, 1990, Swan Hill Press,
ISBN 185310 1877. 128 pages. Numerous colour photographs. Price
#16.95.
This delightful book by Connie Toops reflects the enthusiasm the
author has for the subject. Covering all the Northern Hemisphere
species, Ms Toops breaks away from the more traditional layout of
such volumes. Instead of adopting the species by species approach,
she covers her subject in a series of chapters encompassing a variety
of behavioural and ecological aspects, even touching upon the subject
of owls as educators.
The book is written in a very readable way, unlike many of the
more academic volumes on the subject, and is illustrated by some
stunning photographs. Sequences covering the snowy owl at a nest
feeding chicks and those of the Great Grey Owl hunting are just
some of the 108 colour plates which complement the excellent text.
For those interested in owls, as well as those who like a well
written, illustrated and produced "bird book", it is to be
recommended.

THE 'CORNISH' CHOUGH:
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE(?)

By Malcolm Ellis (St. Breock, Wadebridge, Cornwall)
Perhaps it will be helpful, particularly for some American and
other overseas members, if I begin by explaining that the Chough
(pronounced 'Chuff) Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax, or Palores (digger)
in the Cornish language, is a member of the Crow family (Corvidae).
Sometimes this bird is called the Red-billed Chough, to differentiate
between it and the other species of Chough, the Yellow-billed or
Alpine P. graculus. (The White-winged Chough Corcorax
melanorhamphus , of Australia, is not a true Chough, or indeed a
member of the Crow family, but was so named by homesick Cornish
immigrants). The former has a highly distinctive, fairly slender,
downcurved and pointed bill which is bright red as are its legs and
feet. Like the typical Crows of the genus Corvus, it has black
plumage, which in bright light can be seen to be glossed with shades
of purple, blue and green. This species measures about 38cm (15in),
including the bill, which accounts for about 5cm (2in).
Particularly in the past, in Britain at least, this bird was known as
the Cornish Chough. Although the Chough no longer occurs in
Cornwall, or indeed anywhere in England, it remains closely
associated with Cornwall and the name persists. A Chough figures
on the Cornwall County Council coat-of-arms, which can be seen on
the Tamar Bridge crossing into Cornwall and throughout the county
on Cornwall County Council signs, bottle banks, vehicles, etc. (On
the latest transfer, the Chough has bright yellow on its wing coverts
in place of the more realistic blue on the older design!) A Chough is
included on the coat-of-arms on the sides of ambulances and fire
engines and is used by Cornish Railways regional division of British
Rail. In the Council Chamber of Wadebridge Town Hall, the
Wadebridge coat-of-arms has at the top a relief of a Chough. Near
Newquay and Stem Cove on the north Cornwall coast, where
Choughs last bred in Cornwall and therefore last bred in England, a

Chough figures on the insignia of the Royal Air Force Station, St.
Mawgan. These are just some examples of how the Chough is
identified with Cornwall. Various other representations of the
Chough appear on business logos, etc., and there are 'Chough' cafes
and restaurants, a 'Choughs' darts team and, I think, a wheelchair
dance team!
Penhallurick (1978) summarised the distribution and decline of the
Chough in southern England. He quoted Christopher Merrett who
wrote in 1666 that Choughs occurred "on all sea coasts from Cornwall
to Dover". In 1771 Gilbert White wrote to Thomas Pennant stating
that they "still abounded and bred at Beachy Head and on all the
cliffs of the Sussex coast". This species' decline seemed to become
apparent at the turn of the 18th century. According to Penhallurick,
Choughs lingered on the Isle of Wight until about 1850 and on the
Dorset coast until about 1880, about which time they ceased to breed
in south Devon. In north Devon the last recorded nest was in 1910.
On the north Cornwall coast, the Chough continued to breed until
at least 1947. That is the year of the last definite successful nesting.
According to Darke (Ellis, 1988), in 1951 four birds were seen, in
1954 three, and by 1957 one pair only remained. Each year they
carried nesting material into the traditional cave at Stem Cove but
failed to breed successfully. Archer-Lock (pers. comm.) wrote that,
"in 1963, after the hen had left her nest to join her mate on the
slopes, a distinctive cry of a young one was heard coming from the
crevice . . ." However, no young one was ever seen. By 1973, the
Chough had disappeared from Cornwall and, therefore, from
England. The 17th June 1973 is the date of the last recorded sighting
of what is regarded as the last truly Cornish Chough. He(?) survived
his mate by six years. If those last two Choughs were young hatched
during 1947, the last one must have been 26 years old when it
disappeared and its mate 20 years old when it was found dead.
Although birds of the Crow family are known to be long lived, it
seems prudent to treat such ages with circumspection. One or both
birds could perhaps have been from a later nesting or come from
elsewhere!
During the summer of 1986, two Choughs were observed on the
south coast of Cornwall, just west of Plymouth. Where they came
from can only be a matter of conjecture, although Cornwall is just
within the compass of birds from West Wales. During that winter,
one, almost certainly a female, became chronically ill with gapeworm
Syngamus trachea. The bird's condition deteriorated and it is thought
to have been taken by a Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus (Meyer,

1989, 1990). The remaining Chough moved away early in 1987.
Long before then, thought had been given to ways of returning this
evocative species to its ancestral home on the sea cliffs of the Duchy.
Padstow Bird Gardens were first to look seriously at the idea of using
aviary-bred Choughs. Their lead was followed by Newquay Zoo (see
News and Views, Vol. 77, No. 2, p. 77 (1971)), when it became
custodian of a small flock of these birds which came from Ireland.
Robin Hanbury-Tenison with Lord Eliot, went as far as travelling to
the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, to catch Choughs to bring back to
release in Cornwall. Such ideas were frustrated, I suspect, because
in the first two instances, the birds proved too difficult to breed, far
more so than expected, not least because they were so difficult to
sex; and in the latter instance because there had been insufficient
research into their ecological requirements, which are more exacting
than at first seemed likely.
Having been deeply involved in the controversy about whether or
not badgers are responsible for transmitting tuberculosis to cattle,
Richard Meyer turned his attention to the Chough. There was
considerable enthusiasm for Richard's plans. Support came from
H.R.H. Prince Charles, Duke of Cornwall, Lord St. Levan, Robin
Hanbury-Tenison, various charitable trusts, conservation bodies,
etc., and private individuals. However, it was not until another
interested Chough keeper, Mike Reynolds of The Rare and
Endangered Birds Breeding Centre, Paradise Park, Hayle, Cornwall,
stepped in with the main funding (and a camper van!), that the
project really 'took off. 'Operation Chough' was launched on 4th
August 1987. The first phase of the project was to attempt to discover
why the Chough disappeared from Cornwall and whether suitable
habitat still exists for this species to be re-established.
Richard made a detailed habitat assessment of a selection of its
former haunts in Cornwall. In addition, he studied old historical
records in the County Records Office and consulted the Tithe
Commission maps and apportionments from the 1840s, to get an idea
of how the landscape has changed in the past 150 years or so during
the Chough's most rapid decline and eventual demise. It is not
possible to get detailed earlier records. Studies were also made in
West Wales, the nearest area to Cornwall where Choughs still live.
The idea was to see how the Chough's former haunts in Cornwall
compare with its habitat in West Wales, and to study its feeding
habits and other behaviour throughout the course of a year.
Results are likely to show that several causes contributed to the
Chough's disappearance from the coast of Cornwall. They include

habitat changes, increased human activity, egg collecting, being
taken as pets/cage birds, shot to satisfy the fashion for stuffed birds
and supply museums, and destruction in gin traps set for rabbits.
There is little or no evidence that competition from the Jackdaw
Corvus monedula contributed to the Chough's decline. Undoubtedly
high on the list will be changes in the Chough's habitat caused by
modernising agriculture and tourism. A habitat favoured by the
Chough, the rough ground/farmland along the cliff-tops, underwent
changes brought about by a decline in pastoralism and profound
development, much of it associated with the holiday trade and all
that it entails, though Choughs co-exist elsewhere with tourism.
Year-round grazing of cattle and sheep along the cliff-tops produces
short-cropped cliff-top turf, with patches of bare earth and lots of
cow pats, etc., where the birds can probe with their slender curved
bills and find beetles and their larvae, ants and fly larvae, etc., which
form the bulk of their diet. The decline of pastoralism along with an
absence of offshore islands, such as exist elsewhere, could have been
the death knell for the Cornish Chough, Richard believes.
Dr. M. W. Pienkowski (Bignal and Curtis, 1988) concluded that
the Chough needs "a special blend of wild places and land modified
by man's agricultural activities"; it needs pasture modified by
domestic animals "to produce the optimum conditions for it to exploit
its invertebrate prey".

Early results from Richard's study show that suitable habitat still
exists in parts of Cornwall. An important adjunct could be a
programme of cliff-top grazing, including overwintering stock on the
cliffs, to ensure a winter food source for the Choughs.
Choughs tend to be sedentary. Therefore, it is unlikely that more
than one or two storm-blown or otherwise wayward birds will reach
Cornwall. As the two south coast birds show, it is difficult for such
birds to establish themselves. Therefore, it is almost impossible that
Cornwall will be recolonised naturally. Furthermore, it is highly
improbable that wild birds from elsewhere will be allowed to be
brought in. Such birds would have to come from Wales, the Isle of
Man, Inner Hebrides of Scotland, Ireland or Brittany on the French
Atlantic coast, where this species is very rare. These birds of the
'Celtic fringe' all belong to the same race, P. p. pyrrhocorax , as did
the Cornish birds. They differ in minor respects from the Choughs
living in other parts of Europe, North Africa, Ethiopia and Asia.
'Operation Chough's' plan revives the idea of breeding Choughs
in aviaries for eventual release into the wild. This might mean
establishing Choughs in aviaries at one or more cliff-top release sites
which can be kept secure and where research indicates that this
species has the best chances of becoming re-established. Richard's
hope is that the Choughs will breed in the aviaries and, when the
time is deemed right, young birds will be given their first tastes of
freedom and sally forth to explore the surrounding areas and
gradually revert to wild ways. Whichever means of release is
employed, the ultimate aim is that the birds will fly free and choose
natural nesting sites among the sea cliffs and their young will
recolonise the coast and revert to a truly wild state.
From the avicultural point of view, keeping Choughs is not
difficult, but breeding them has proved problematical. The first
breeding record in Britain seems to have been as late at 1960,
followed by Paignton Zoo in 1972 (Harrison, 1972). Since then quite
a number have been bred at Paignton and to a lesser extent at
Paradise Park and, perhaps at one or two other public collections,
but so far not on a regular and reliable basis. One or maybe two
private individuals claim to be successful, but remain guarded about
how they achieve their success.
'Operation Chough' has, at considerable cost, been able to buy
several birds from the most successful private breeder. Obviously the
release programme will require quite a number of Choughs, certainly
a minimum of, say, 20, and from as wide a genetic pool as possible.
As well as the main release and perhaps an earlier pilot one, it will

be prudent to hold a top-up stock. The project initiated its own
aviary-breeding programme, which suffered an early setback when
surgical sexing showed Paradise Park's original birds were five males
and only one true pair. Luckily six new birds proved to be five
females and one male.
1990 began with 13 Choughs, seven males and six females at
Paradise Park. Choughs are not sexually mature until two to three
years old, and unfortunately only one of the females was of breeding
age. That situation was remedied somewhat when a mature male was
exchanged for an additional breeding age female from The Wildlife
Breeding Centre in Hertfordshire. After a visit to the successful
private breeder, it was decided to try a number of birds together,
instead of in single pairs. Thus, early in February, the two mature
females with their chosen partners and a young pair were housed
together in a breeding aviary provided with several nest sites. Two
nests were constructed, but no eggs laid. The other immature birds
also were provided with nest sites and some nest building occurred.
In an attempt to learn more about the Chough's breeding behaviour
and improve the chances of success, one of the mature pair's nest
sites was equipped with a video camera which relayed the 'action' at
the nest. This video monitoring proved very successful and almost
certainly will be used again.
Thanks to a generous grant from The Conservation Foundation,
five more aviary-bred Choughs were purchased in August. When
sexed they proved to be two males and three females. These
important additions to the 'Operation Chough' flock undoubtedly
increase its breeding potential and already the 1991 breeding season
is being looked forward to with renewed anticipation. 'Operation
Chough 1 is in close contact with Padstow Bird Gardens, Paignton
Zoo, Chester Zoo and The Wildlife Breeding Centre, all of which
have pairs of Choughs and are keen to breed them. It is also
exploring the possibility of soon setting up a pilot release project.
Any such releases will need to satisfy conservation, scientific and
legal requirements.
As mentioned earlier, a contributing factor to the Chough's decline
was that many were taken as pets/cage birds. According to
Penhallurick, Choughs have been tamed in Cornwall since at least
the 16th century. He quoted W. G. Maton ( Observations of the
Western Counties of England, 1797), who found the Cornish so much
attached to them "that it was very common to see tame ones in their
gardens". William Borlase author of The Natural History of Cornwall
(1758) had one for some years in his vicarage at Ludgvan.

Penhallurick quoted a letter written by Borlase in 1763. Borlase
wrote "Our Chough is now, I think, in its fourteenth year. It has
sometimes been sick. Mrs. Borlase is the doctor, and when its
appetite appears to be disordered she has grated rhubarb made up
with a little meal into a paste with success; if his spirits are low we
infuse saffron into his water; and as he has free egress and ingress,
appears generally at dinner, knocking at the door if it is shut with his
bill till 'tis opened; his place is to perch behind my chair, his favourite
dish is the yolk of a boiled egg, which he will take off my plate
without leave; if there is any white meat, particularly chicken or veal,
he expects his share minced for him, and he flies upon the table and
back to his perch without ceremony and manners. It is a bird that
loves such familiarity and I apprehend cannot live in solitude where
he has not liberties of ranging and varying the scene." Borlase
dispatched Choughs to his London friends, including in 1757, at the
request of Dr. William Oliver, two young ones for Mr. Legg the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, but neither bird lived long. In his
manuscript notes, Borlase wrote of a Mr. Roberts of Truro, who kept
a bird for nine years, which could "speak several words exceedingly
distinct".
The Chough has remained popular to the present time. On account
of its rarity in Britain, the Chough is now a Schedule 1 species and,
as it is throughout Europe, is fully protected, including its nest and
eggs.

and making many helpful suggestions.
FOOTNOTE: As I was completing the typing of this article, a
Chough appeared not far from here, on the north Cornwall coast.
Eight months or so later, it continues to live there. It seems to stay
almost exclusively in a cliff-top field, grazed by cattle and well
supplied with cow pats, and patches of bare earth, etc: classic-type
Chough habitat. A known exception was during harsh winter
weather, including snow, and when the cattle had been removed,
when the Chough moved onto the cliffs below Port Isaac, and foraged
between there and Port Gaverne. Enquiries revealed that this is
almost certainly an aviary bird released by Grahame Dangerfield.
Another was found dead near Bude.

For nine years the San Diego Zoo has had the opportunity to
establish a breeding record with the North Island Brown Kiwi.
Through the manipulation of pairs, the management of eggs and
incubation conditions, and a constantly refined and improved chick
rearing method, the San Diego Zoo has sucessfully reared five chicks
since 1983, a record outside New Zealand.
Kiwis are flightless birds endemic to New Zealand. Three species
have been described; the Brown Kiwi Apteryx australis , the Little
Spotted Kiwi Apteryx oweni and the Great Spotted Kiwi Apteryx
haasti. Only the Brown Kiwi has recognized subspecies; A. a.
mantelli, A. a. australis, and A. a. I awry i. These subspecies occur on
the North Island, South Island and Stewart Island respectively. All
Kiwis are nocturnal, lay 1-2 egg clutches, and have similar natural
histories. The male assumes all incubation and chick-rearing duties.
Kiwis have very poor eyesight, and make their living on the forest
floor by probing the soil with their long, sensitive bills. They have a
keen sense of smell, and in conjunction with their facial bristles, are
successful at the detection and extraction of earthworms.
The wild populations of all three Kiwi species seem to be stable.
Their ranges have been modified, if not reduced in some areas, but
in no cases are they threatened. There now exist laws which protect
the Kiwis from capture, hunting, or incidental mortality through the
use of unmodified opossum traps. Export of the Kiwi is controlled by
the New Zealand Wildlife Service Department of Conservation.
There are numerous New Zealand institutions which currently
display one, two, or all three species of Kiwi. A number of these
collections have bred the Kiwi - none of which, until recently, has
bred their animals predictably and consistently. The most notable of
these breeding programmes have been at Otorohanga and
Wellington Zoo. Beginning in the 1980s, eggs have been laid and
artificially incubated with a resultant increase in chick hatchability
and survivability. The first captive hatching outside Australasia was
at the National Zoo in Washington, DC, in 1975. (This chick, a male,
is currently paired at the National Zoo with a hen hatched at the San
Diego Zoo in 1987). Other singular hatchings have occurred at

Jurong Bird Park (Singapore) and Frankfurt Zoo. Historical attempts
to establish Kiwi breeding programmes have failed due to a host of
problems including imcompatibility of pairs, inadequate breeding/
exhibit areas, embryonic mortality under conditions of natural
incubation, eggs broken by the incubating male, and unsuccessful
chick-rearing in both artificial and natural conditions.
History of the North Island Brown Kiwi at the San Diego Zoo
The first Kiwi ever exhibited at the San Diego Zoo arrived in 1954
and lived as a singleton for 13 years, until 1967, when it was joined
by a female. The original male died ten months later. The female
died nearly one year after its arrival. In 1969 two wild-caught males
arrived from Auckland, one living for 3+ years and the other now
on loan to Brookfield zoo (22+ years of age). In 1973 and 1981, two
additional wild-caught males arrived from the National Zoo, one
living on exhibit until 1985 (18+ years of age), and the other
currently alive. In 1979 two wild-caught females arrived from
Auckland to join the three males.
Breeding History of the North Island Brown Kiwi at the San Diego
Zoo
The San Diego Zoo has had potential breeding pairs since 1979
when there were two pairs and later three males and two females in
1981.
1981 - The first egg in the collection was laid in 1981. It was incubated
by the male and removed after a full term of incubation. It was
addled and it was not possible to determine fertility.
1982 - No eggs were laid.
1983 - Three eggs were laid; two were infertile. The third egg was
fertile and hatched under the male. This was the first hatching of a
Kiwi in San Diego Zoo's history, and the second hatching outside
Australasia. The chick was removed for hand-rearing immediately
after hatching. This chick survived for 22 days. The cause of death
was a bursal infection.
1984 - There were two infertile eggs in 1984.
1985 - A chick was hatched under the breeding male and survived
for two days. The cause of death was undetermined. The second egg
of that year was laid by a hen in a trio. This egg was infertile.
1986 - A third chick was hatched, again under the breeding male.
This chick was found dead when two days old. The cause of death
was trauma, apparently caused by a tearing kick to the belly from the
brooding male parent. A second chick was hatched in 1986 (fourth

chick to this point) under the breeding male, removed when one day
old, raised to fledge, and sent to the National Zoo.
1987 - One, possibly two, pre-natal chicks were killed prior to
hatching, due to enclosure disturbance and destruction of the eggs
by the incubating male. In addition, two infertile eggs were produced
in 1987 by the same pair of Kiwis.
1988 - A total of three eggs were obtained from two pairs of birds.
Two were infertile and one was fertile, artificially incubated,
hatched, raised to fledge and sent to the National Zoo.
1989 - Four eggs were produced by the two pairs of birds. The
breeding pair produced a chick (artificially incubated) and a second
fertile egg that was broken by the male before the egg was removed
for artificial incubation. The newly established second pair produced
two probably fertile eggs, the embryos of which died early during
incubation under the male. The successfully reared chick was sent to
the Rotterdam Zoo to pair with their single male.
1990 - Two fertile eggs were laid, artificially incubated and
successfully reared. These birds were, in turn, sent to the Los
Angeles Zoo to join their hen, and to the Memphis Zoo to form a
future pair. As an additional note, a chick was hatched on 15th
March, 1991 and is doing well.
In summary, there have been 26 eggs produced since 1981 by three
different pairs of Kiwis. Of this number of eggs, 13 were fertile, eight
hatched and five chicks survived for more than a year. Two pairs of
Kiwis have produced fertile eggs, with one pair hatching chicks.

enclosures - one on exhibit and one off exhibit immediately behind
the display area. The exhibit area is maintained on a reverse night-
day cycle while the off-exhibit area is kept under the ambient light
regime. The exhibit area light regime imitates the day-night lengths
of Auckland.
Off-exhibit: The enclosure is a chainlink 'yard' measuring
approximately 20&apos; x 30&apos;. It is covered by chainlink to prevent the
entrance of predators. There is a water dish with fresh water daily.
The base is natural earth. Two open-bottomed wooden boxes are
provided, each measuring about 3&apos; (long) x 1&apos; xl&apos;. The boxes are
half-buried in the soil, presenting the Kiwis with a single entrance
located at the end of each box. The top of the box is hinged to allow
for burrow inspections and removal of eggs and/or chicks.

approximately 20&apos; x 30&apos;. The floor is mulch and soil. The burrow
boxes are the same dimensions as above, but are completely buried.
The entrance to each burrow communicates with the surface via a 3&apos;
tunnel made from a 3-sided plywood box, open at the bottom.
Diet: The birds in each exhibit are fed daily a mixure of 3 /4 cup
soaked hi-protein dog-food with trout chow, V 2 cup ground beef heart
and nightcrawlers ad lib. The soil is stocked with five pounds of the
latter once a week in each exhibit. One of the females will eat two
or three mice each day, but she is unique in her taste.
Breeding Behaviour
Both pairs of birds behave similarly during egg-laying. The pairs
will roost together in the same burrow during the non-breeding
season. When the female is ready to lay, she will visit the unused
burrow, lay her egg and return to the traditional roost burrow. The
male will then leave the roost burrow and begin incubating the egg
in the second burrow. In only one pair will the male carry material
into the incubation burrow. This consists of pine needles and
eucalyptus leaves.
Natural Incubation: The male will incubate a two-egg clutch,
beginning incubation with the first egg. The female lays the second
egg usually between two and four weeks after the first egg. The
length of time between the first and second egg is a characteristic of
the individual female. Only the male will incubate the egg(s), leaving
for brief periods to feed. Weights were not taken to determine any
weight loss by the male during incubation. Contrary to historical
reports, the female will not take part in any aspects of incubation,
and will roost in the other burrow for the entire incubation period.
The incubation period lasts for 70-71 days, although longer periods
have been recorded from New Zealand, both under artificial and
natural conditions. Captive male Kiwis are notorious for being
unpredictable incubators and fathers. There are numerous accounts
of male Kiwis in New Zealand which either break eggs, abandon
eggs, or hatch chicks and 'clumsily' kick the neonates to death. For
this last reason, the first Kiwi chick to hatch in San Diego in 1983 was
removed on hatching, for hand-rearing. Although the chick survived
the male's ministrations, it subsequently died after 22 days because
of a bursa! infection. Because of this death under artificial conditions,
fertile eggs laid in 1985 and 1986 were left for the male to incubate
and rear. He successfully hatched the chicks, but in both cases, they
died when they were two days old. A second egg of 1986 and all eggs
laid since have followed the same basic scedule; i.e. the egg is left
with the male for forty days, when it is removed and artificially

The chick is left in a dark brooder until it is three days old, when it is transferred to
a specially built floor brooder. This brooder has a soil base with an indoor-outdoor
run. The chick is let outside only after it has regained its hatch weight and the weather
is suitably mild. Handling at this age is kept to a minimum so as not to stress the chick.
It is extremely shy and loud noises and bright lights frighten it.
incubated. It is important to mark the egg(s) in order to distinguish
the first from the second. This can be helpful if there is a second egg
laid, and the first egg is destroyed without a trace. Egg retrievals are
done carefully and quickly to avoid molesting the male, and to avoid
any unnecessary cooling of the warm egg.
Artificial Incubation: Kiwi eggs are more closely related to reptile
eggs than to bird eggs and do not require turning during incubation.
They demonstrate an extreme temperature gradient from the top of
the egg (warmer) to the bottom of the egg (cooler). The temperature
of the eggs varies from 37.1*C. (day) to 35.5*C. (night) at the top
and from 26.6*C (day) to 26.0*C (night) at the bottom. Artificial
incubation is done in a Lyon's, still-air unit at 35.8*C. - 36.1*C. Still-
air conditions duplicate a natural gradient, more like an incubating
male than a forced air incubator which evenly distributes warm air
over the entire egg. The expected weight loss is about 10%. The pip-
hatch interval was found to vary from 24 to 96 hours.

Chick Rearing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95350176923077" page_id="56269534"  page_num="64" year="" vol="">
The last five chicks which were hatched from artificially incubated
eggs were hand-reared and not replaced under the male. The
inconsistent incubating and brooding behaviour of the San Diego
Zoo's breeding males (both pairs) was in agreement with reports
from New Zealand regarding their male Kiwi behaviour. The San
Diego chicks hatched in 1983, 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1990(2), were all
placed in a brooder at 33.8*C. The delicate chick is handled as little
as possible to the point of supporting the neonate in the brooder with
rolled towels. The chick is weighed on hatching and again when it is
three to seven days old, when it is moved on to a sterile soil floor in
a brooder. The chick begins walking from day four to six, as it
initiates exploration forays in its new environment. The chick begins
eating on about day six, and loses 30% of its initial weight in its first
two weeks. The chick regains its hatch weight in 30 days. The chick
diet consists of papaya, waxworms, red worms, earthworms, ground
beef heart, apple, chopped greens, banana and a gruel of beef heart,
soya oil, wheat germ, rolled oats, vionate and water, mixed to a
soupy consistency.
Dispersal of Chicks
All five chicks which have been successfully reared since 1986 have
been transferred to other institutions. To minimize potential risks,
the chicks are moved after they are more than six months of age.
Two females went to National Zoo to form a trio with their FI male.
One female chick went to Los Angeles Zoo to join their remaining
hen, another one to Rotterdam Zoo to pair with their male, and
another to Memphis Zoo to form a future pairing with an imported
male.
Future Prospects of the Captive Kiwi Programme in San Diego U.S.
Bolstered by the five Kiwis successfully reared in San Diego since
1986, a consortium of U.S. zoos has opened discussions with the New
Zealand Department of Conservation with the hope of providing new
imports of captive-hatched Kiwis which are now residing in
Wellington and Otorohanga. The U.S. Kiwi consortium is comprised
of National Zoo, Brookfield Zoo, Los Angeles Zoo and the
Zoological Society of San Diego. Additionally, the 1990 hatched
chick which was sent to Rotterdam, represents the first exchange of
Kiwis between the U.S. and Europe and will hopefully serve as the
first step in a long-term exchange of Kiwi blood between two
continents. With the recent hatching of a Kiwi at Frankfurt,

exchanges between the U.S. Kiwi consortium and European
collaborators is possible. Lastly, we are optimistic that the new San
Diego pair of Kiwis, composed of a 1979 imported female and a male
on loan from Brookfield Zoo, will continue to lay fertile eggs,
eventually resulting in a new genetic line of Kiwis which will
strengthen the U.S. population.

The Trumpeter Hornbill Bycanistes bucinator belongs to a group
of forestdiving species which includes the Brown-cheeked Hornbill
B. cylindricus and its close allies, the Silvery-cheeked Hornbill B.
subcylindricus and the Black-and-white-casqued Hornbill B. brevis.
The Trumpeter Hornbill is one of the two smaller species in this
genus and is closely related to the Piping Hornbill B. fistulator of
West and Central Africa (Snow, 1978). Two other African forest
dwelling Hornbills, the Black-casqued Hornbill Ceratogymma elata
and the Yellow-casqued Hornbill C. atrata differ from this group in
being larger and in having extensive bare areas of blue facial skin and
wattles. Fry, Keith and Urban (1988) treat all species of Bycanistes
as members of an enlarged genus Ceratogymna , the Trumpeter
Hornbill then becoming C. bucinator. We remain conservative in
continuing to follow White (1965) and Snow (1978) by retaining
Bycanistes as a genus distinct from the larger and more awesome
Ceratogymna.
The Trumpeter Hornbill is patchily distributed in the forests of
sub-equatorial Africa ranging from southern Kenya through Malawi,
Zimbabwe and Mozambique into South Africa and westwards across
Zambia, Zaire and Angola. Strikingly clad in black and white the
sexes are distinguished only by the slightly smaller size of the female
and the larger casque of the mature adult male.
In the wild egg-laying occurs from October to January with the
birds selecting natural holes in trees or in a rock face. Although for
Trumpeter Hornbills the details of the nesting couple remain largely
unknown, like other Hornbills the female seals herself inside the nest
chamber and this may precede egg laying by more than twelve days
(Fry, Keith &amp; Urban, 1988; Millar, 1921). An unsuccessful breeding
attempt was recorded at London Zoo in 1936 when it was noted that
mudding up of the nest box began in April and that although this
was largely the work of the female the mud was carried up to her by
the male (Stonor, 1937). That particular breeding attempt began in
April and ended in July when the female emerged from the nest box
after 94 days without any fledglings. Stonor reports that examination
of the box then showed no trace of either eggs or young. As there

was no increase in the amount of food carried to the nest during this
period Stonor suggests that either the female failed to lay or that the
eggs were eaten by the female.
Our experience with Trumpeter Hornbills at Chester Zoo began
when we obtained a pair of these birds in April 1985. These have
since been the sole occupants of one of the indoor aviaries of the Bird
House. Their aviary measures 6m x 3m x 4.3m high, but because
of the destructive nature of these birds in this relatively small
enclosure it has been left unplanted. In the Bird House heating is
provided only in the wintbr to ensure the area is frost free. The diet
fed to the Trumpeter Hornbills at Chester Zoo consists of chopped
fruit; usually apples, pears, tomatoes, grapes and bananas (although
other fruit is offered in season), with soaked Diet "A" (SDS Diets)
and a coarse insectivorous mixture supplemented with SA37 and
"Equivite E". Outside the breeding cycle live food was not normally
taken in any quantity and limited to a few mealworms daily.
Shortly after their arrival at Chester a nesting barrel, 66cm high x
53cm diameter, was positioned vertically at a height of about 1 metre
in a corner of the aviary. The barrel was provided with an entrance
hole of 15cm diameter located 7.5cm below the top of the barrel. A
concrete lip was fashioned around its entrance to facilitate mudding
up by the Hornbills. Freshly dug clay was provided and kept wet by
being immersed in a large water vessel throughout the breeding
attempts. No real interest in nesting was shown until 1988 when the
female in particular spent some time inspecting the nest barrel but
seemed to want to dig out her own entrance. Attempts to block the
entrance to the nest barrel with soft wood failed to satisfy the birds
and although occasional interest was shown throughout the year, no
serious nesting attempt was made. On 17th March 1989, the nest
barrel was packed with composted bark so that the entrance hole was
entirely blocked with this compacted material. Both male and female
Trumpeter Hornbills immediately inspected the nest barrel and the
hole was opened up with the dislodged bark forming a pile below the
barrel. Over the following ten days the male was observed to stand
guard as the female proceeded to remove half of the bark contents
from the barrel. On 28th March the female was seen inside the barrel
smearing mud around the entrance. At that time, live food started
to be taken in increasing quantities. By 3rd April the female was
spending most of her time in the barrel mudding up the entrance and
the male was then seen feeding her. No courtship feeding of the
female by the male had been seen before this time. This contrasts
with the London pair for which Stonor (1937) reports the female

width. From then until 1st May, the mudded entrance was constantly
rebuilt, being partially broken then repaired although the female was
never seen to leave the nest barrel. The male became extremely
attentive and from the commencement of the mudding up
increasingly wary of the keeper's presence. The amount of live food
taken increased dramatically on 9th May when the food dish was
emptied by mid-afternoon. This was taken to indicate that chicks had
hatched some 36 days after the female had mudded herself inside the
box. At this time and from then onwards live food offered included
mealworms, crickets, and locusts. Pink mice and rats although
offered were eaten only rarely. Over the nesting period the amount
of live food accepted increased to a peak of 100 locusts, 300 crickets
and 50g of mealworms each day. These were fed in addition to the
usual diet.
The male individually mandibulated and swallowed each food
item. It was then regurgitated and offered to the incarcerated female.
Similar behaviour has been observed in the wild for the closely
related Silvery-cheeked Hornbill B. brevis , the Black-and-white
casqued Hornbill B. subcylindricus , and the Brown-cheeked
Hornbill B. cylindricus. In all these species the males visit the nest
infrequently carrying in their gullets loads of small food items which
are then individually regurgitated to be fed to the nesting female.
However for all three species noted above the most frequently
reported food items were small fruits (Fry, Keith &amp; Urban 1988).
This behaviour of infrequent nest visits by the males carrying multiple
loads of small food items in the gullet contrasts with that observed
in African Grey Hornbills Tockus nasutus in which the male
frequently visits the nest with single food items carried openly in its
bill (Wilkinson &amp; McLeod, 1990).
During the weeks following the incarceration of the female in the
nest barrel it was noticed that the pile of bark below the nest
disappeared. Captive male African Grey Hornbills carry bark into
their nest during the breeding cycle and this may aid nest hygiene
(Wilkinson &amp; McLeod 1990). Although it was never witnessed we
suspect that this behaviour may also have been shown by the male
Trumpeter Hornbill. Fresh bark was made available on 16th June
several days after faeces were first noticed around the nest entrance.
Neither the female nor the chicks were actually observed to defaecate
from the nest entrance although Stonor recorded this for the London
female noting that "the droppings were expelled with considerable
force".

Stonor noted that the male Trumpeter Hornbill at London became
"more and more suspicious of any onlookers" until he would not feed
the female if he was being watched. Similarly Millar reported that in
the wild a male he had under observation would not feed his mate
after he approached closer to the nest tree. The Chester male was
also shy of feeding the female in the keeper's presence and this
coupled with the long intervals between feeding the female made
observations difficult. It was only when tape recordings of the chicks
call together with those of the adults were made on 28th June that
we were able to confirm our suspicions that the Trumpeter Hornbills
had young in the nest. Immediately following this recording session
the chicks were heard on several further occasions. The only time
the male was seen to visit the nest barrel when the keeper was visible
to him followed the female summoning the male by a rapid knocking
of her bill in the nest entrance. The male then flew directly to the
nest rather than following his usual behaviour of first flying to a
nearby perch and calling to the female before flying up to perch on
the barrel itself. No exchange of food was seen when after being
summoned the male flew directly to the nest. The breeding attempt
culminated with the discovery at 8.00am on 31st July that the mudded
entrance to the nest was half broken and one chick had fledged. The
male was very excited and vocalised continuously. By early afternoon
the female had completely broken the mud rim around the nest and
both she and a second chick had emerged to join the excited male.
The female and the two chicks emerged in perfect feather. The chicks
were of similar size to the female but differed in their less robust and
paler casques and were distinguished by conspicuous blazes of
chestnut brown feathers above the bill extending to the forehead and
back over the eyes, and below the lower mandible.
Both male and female fed the fledglings after they emerged from
the nest although for two days the male repeatedly carried food to
the then empty barrel. Two weeks after leaving the nest the young
Hornbills were joining the adults at the food dish and largely feeding
themselves. The amount of live food then taken rapidly decreased to
a minimal quantity. The period for which the female was fully
incarcerated during this nesting cycle was calculated to be 117 days.
Because the dates of egg laying were unknown it is not possible to
determine the incubation period but the interval between the female
finally mudding herself in and hatching, as indicated by the increased
consumption of live food, was estimated as 34 days, and the nestling
period as 83 days. Inspection of the nest contents following
emergence failed to reveal the presence of any unhatched eggs or the

evidence of failed nestlings. This suggests that the clutch comprised
two eggs both of which were successfully hatched and reared. Millar
noted that both of the two nests he studied in the wild had clutches
of two eggs. Clutches of 1-2 eggs are normal for this genus and noted
by Fry, Keith &amp; Urban (1988) for all Bycanistes Hornbills with the
exception of Trumpeters which are recorded as having 2-4 eggs.
Perhaps the normal clutch size also for this species is of five eggs.
The storms of early 1990 necessitated repair work in the Bird
House. The Trumpeter Hornbills were then rehoused temporarily
and returned to their previous aviary on 26th April. They then
immediately inspected the nest barrel which had been refilled with
bark. As in 1989 the female excavated the nest barrel and between
29th April and 1st May mudded herself inside the nest chamber. The
male was less disturbed by the keeper's presence than during the
previous breeding attempt and on 5th June was observed to be very
attentive and vocal, carrying live food to the nest as soon as it had
been offered. This was taken to indicate a chick had hatched some
36 days after the female had finally incarcerated herself. Over the
next two months increased quantities of live food were taken but this
amounted to a smaller proportion of the total diet fed than in 1989.
On 9th August, some 65 days after their hatching was first suspected
the female and two chicks broke out of the barrel. This was a more
contracted nesting cycle than noted in 1989, the difference relating
to the shorter nestling period. Both adults fed the chicks but these
remained dependent on their parents for food for a longer time than
in 1989, this being extended to four weeks after they emerged with
no reduction in the quantity of live food taken. Thus although the
period in the nest was shorter it was compensated by a longer period
of post-fledging dependence on the parents. Stonor noted a complete
moult of the captive London female during her unsuccessful 1936
nesting attempt. Once moult has been initiated the female may be
constrained to remain within the nest to complete her moult even if
that nesting attempt fails early in the cycle. Inspection of the nest
contents following both successful nesting attempts at Chester
indicated that she had moulted wing and tail feathers during the
nesting cycle and in both cases she emerged in immaculate feather.
Millar recorded that in nature wild Trumpeter Hornbills plaster up
their nest hole immediately after their chicks fledge concealing its
presence so as to preserve it for their use in the following year. No
such mudding up of the nest entrance was observed following either
breeding of the captive birds at Chester. This may, however, in part
explain the behaviour of our female in being stimulated to breed after

removing the compacted bark we had packed into the nest entrance.
The breeding of the Trumpeter Hornbill at Chester Zoo in 1989,
repeated in 1990, is believed to be the first successful nesting of this
species in the United Kingdom. At the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode,
a pair made an unsuccessful breeding attempt in 1989 and at Paignton
Zoo a pair of Trumpeter Hornbills successfully reared two chicks in
1990. Other recent reports of breedings of this species from the
Netherlands and the United States of America indicate that given
sufficient interest Trumpeter Hornbills should not be too difficult to
establish in captivity. However they are presently not a conservation
sensitive species and therefore some zoos may consider them of
greater importance in developing husbandry methods of value in
propagating those large Oriental Hornbills presently considered to
be threatened in the wild.

BREEDING THE HISPANIOLAN CONURE AT PALMITOS
PARK (GRAN CANARIA)

One of the least known of the Aratinga Conures is also one of the
most modestly coloured, the Hispaniolan A. chloroptera. At first
glance it is entirely green, except for the red on the bend of the wing
and the prominent area of white skin surrounding the eye. It could
easily be confused with the White-eyed Conure Aratinga leucoph-
thalmus from which it is distinguished by the under wing coverts.
Most of these coverts are red in both species but the greater coverts
are yellow in the White-eyed species whereas in the Hispaniolan
some are red and some are green. It is a medium-sized Conure,
measuring about 29cm (11 in) and weighing 135g to 170g. Immature
birds differ from the adults in having much less red on the under wing
coverts. The colour of the iris is reddish-brown (seen in a good light)
or dull brown in the young. The bill colour of the adults is an unusual
shade, perhaps best described as very pale brown. The White-eyed
has a very large range over nearly all tropical South America, but the
Hispaniolan is confined to the island of that name which, politically,
is comprised of two countries, Haiti and Santo Domingo. It has
always been very rare in aviculture. When Thomas Arndt published
his book on Aratinga Conures in 1981 he stated that he knew of only
five specimens in Europe, at Vogelpark Walsrode in Germany and
at Palmitos Park on Gran Canaria. It remains rare but fortunately is
proving prolific in the breeding centre at Palmitos Park. The first
success occured in 1986 when two young were reared from a clutch
of four eggs. This pair has continued to produce one or two nests of
young every year and, in 1990, a second pair started to breed. We
now have 17 birds, several of which are unrelated to the breeding
pair and so we shall be able to make up more unrelated pairs in the
future. This is important, with so few birds within aviculture and with
the species declining in the wild as a result of their loss of habitat.
The decline has been most severe on Haiti. Visitors to the Dominican
Republic can still observe the Conure in the wild without making any
particular effort. However, habitat destruction has meant that (as has
occurred with so many Caribbean island parrots) it is more likely to
be seen in the mountains. Nesting occurs in trees and in arboreal
termites' nests.

I will relate the breeding cycle of one pair during 1989 and 1990.
In the first clutch of 1989 one egg was seen in the nest on 5th May
and two eggs on the 10th. They hatched on 2nd and 5th June, giving
a 26 day incubation period for the second egg. Both young left the
nest on 30th July, 58 and 55 days after hatching. In the second clutch
there was one egg in the nest on 15th November and two eggs on
the 17th. They hatched on 10th and 13th December, again giving a
26 day incubation period for the second egg. The chicks were closed-
ringed at 16 and 15 days with 7.5mm rings. Both young left the nest
on 8th February, 60 and 57 days after hatching. All the young from
this pair are plucked naked on the underparts and quite badly
plucked on the wings while in the nest. However, as their flight and
tail feathers are untouched and it is unlikely to be cold when they
fledge, the young are left with the adults which are otherwise very
conscientious parents.
In 1990 the female laid on 5th and 8th April. On 9th April two
new laid eggs from another pair of Hispaniolan Conures were
transferred to her nest. The other female, which was hatched at
Palmitos Park, was in an aviary containing eight birds, including the
young from the previous year, and her previous clutch had been
broken. After the removal of the eggs, the new pair was moved to a
suspended cage. The incubating female's first chick hatched on 2nd
May (after 27 days), another chick hatched on 6th May and one of
the fostered eggs on 4th May. The second and third chicks were
ringed with 6.5mm rings when aged 16 and 14 days - and this proved
to be the correct size for the species. One left the next on 26th June
and the second and third on 29th June.
Favoured rearing foods are fresh corn and spray millet and a
mixture of small soaked seeds (canary, hemp and oats). The normal
diet is also eaten and this consists of a mixture of sprouted sunflower
seed and boiled maize, plus items varied daily such as peas, carrots,
cooked butter beans and cooked whole rice. Calcium carbonate is
added to this mixture several times weekly and while chicks are in
the nest a liquid calcium additive is given frequently in the drinking
water and on two or three occasions directly into the chicks' beak.
These conures also receive a mixture of chopped fruits, pieces of
orange and various fruits in season, such as cactus, which is a
favourite of many species.
The Hispaniolan Conures at Palmitos Park have engaging person-
alities, being inquisitive and active. I suspect that there will never be
much demand for them because most other Aratingas are more
colourful. It is very important, however, to ensure that this species

I visited Madang Province (Nitul, Jais Aben, Baitabag,
Alexishafen), New Guinea, between 15th December 1988 and 26th
January 1989. I spent the week beginning 26th January and ending
3rd February at Port Moresby and its surrounding countryside.

During these periods I made observations on five of the 12 mannikin
species known to occur in New Guinea. Mannikins are popular cage
birds and many species have been kept, yet little is known of their
biology in the wild. It is hoped that these notes will stimulate others
to make observations on this fascinating group of finches.
Habitat
Four of the five mannikin species treated herein are grassland
species. In coastal Madang Province, grassland is recent and the
result of rainforest cleared for cultivation and then left fallow. Most
of these grassy areas tend to be small and scattered. The one
exception is the Streak-headed Mannikin Lonchura tristissima , a bird
of patchy distribution, which avoids open grassland (Coates 1990). It
frequents scrubby regions most often at forest edges (Beehler et al.
1986). I saw them in pairs or in small flocks, but never in large flocks
as I did the following species.
The Grand Mannikin L. grandis is reported as local and less
common than the other New Guinea mannikins, tending to forage in
small to medium sized flocks. I found this to be the most common
species in Madang. I observed flocks of this mannikin on the outskirts
of Nitul (near Jais Aben Resort), near Alexishafen, and at Baitabag.
At Baitabag the flock I observed for over a week numbered about
300 individuals.
The Chestnut-breasted Mannikin L. castaneothorax is found in
both upland and lowland grasslands (Beehler et al. 1986). It was the
second most common species encountered both at Madang and Port
Moresby.
The Grey-headed Mannikin L. caniceps is a lowland species at Port
Moresby where the nominate form occurs. A mid-montane

subspecies, which occupies grassland between 1000m- 1800m, occurs
in southeast New Guinea (Mayr et al. 1968). This mannikin appears
to have a more catholic preference for habitats than the other
congeners, and is found in savannahs, marshes and riverine grassland
(Beehler et al. 1986). I encountered them in small flocks of a dozen
or so birds in the savannahs of Port Moresby and vicinity. Flocks may
number up to 1,000 birds in September and October when they feed
on the ripening grass (Immelmann et al. 1977). I also saw pairs and
singletons, notably in the vicinity of Brown River.
The Hooded Mannikin L. spectabilis is typically a bird of mid-
montane grasslands, and only sparingly a bird of the lowlands
(Beehler et al. 1986). Only one individual was observed, on two
occasions at Baitabag, Madang Province.

Half-ripe grass seeds are the main diet of the mannikins at all the
localities where they were encountered. In the Madang area all four
mannikin species fed principally on Rottboelia exaltata , a grass
reaching up to 6 feet in height (Baptista 1990). Smith (1988 and pers.
comm.) found Rottboelia to be an important food item for various
estrildid species in south-central Cameroon, Africa. The second most
favoured foods in this area were the inflorescences of wild sugar-cane
Saccarum robustum. Grey-headed and Chestnut-breasted Mannikins
at the Port Moresby area fed mostly on seeds of Sorghum nitidum
and occasionally on Themeda australis.
Typical of grassland estrildids, all the mannikins observed in this
study were adept at perching on vertical stems. The method of
foraging depended on the strength of the culms, whether they
remained upright or whether they bent over with the weight of a
perching mannikin.
The culms of Saccarum remain upright, even with the weight of as
many as 12 perching mannikins. A Grand Mannikin typically perched
on the upright inflorescence culm to peck and remove the small seeds
attached to the lateral spikelets. Some individuals were seen grasping
the spikelet at the base, then running the bill along its length to the
apex, removing the small seeds in the process. Others would pull the
spikelets off the culm and fly off to remove the seeds at another spot.
The spikelet may be placed across a perch, clamped under one foot,
and then pecked at. A flock of Grand Mannikins may eventually strip
all the Spikelets off the vertical culm.
L. castaneothorax were occasionally seen feeding on Saccarum , but

L. tristissima were never observed doing so. In contrast to L. grandis ,
L. castaneothorax used only one method of feeding: pecking at the
spikelets. Perhaps the smaller and weaker bill of L. castaneothorax
does not equip it to pull spikelets off the main culm in the manner
of the Grand Mannikin.

Individual mannikins would feed on Rottboelia by flying against
the stem causing it to bend. They would then slide along the stem to
the seedheads and consume the seeds while moving from the spikelet
base to the apex. The weak stems of the Sorghum grass bends double
with the weight of a Grey-headed or Chestnut-breasted Mannikin.
Under these circumstances the mannikin hangs upside down, reaches
down and plucks seeds off the spikelets (Fig. 1). If the culm of either
grass species bends and rests on another plant providing a horizontal
perch, other mannikins may also converge on this food source. As
many as five mannikins may thus eat from one culm. Chestnut-
breasted Mannikins sometimes shared the same seed-heads with
Grand or Grey-headed Mannikins.
On 3rd February, I watched a Grey-headed Mannikin employ a
unique method of foraging. It landed near the top of a vertical
Sorghum culm, then slid down the stem to reach seeds protruding
from surrounding grasses at a lower level. The action was reminiscent
of a fireman sliding down a pole.
As described earlier for Chestnut-breasted Mannikins
(Immelmann 1982), a Grand or Grey-headed Mannikin may also
perch on a stem, reach out and pull a seeding head from surrounding
plants towards itself, then clamp the seeding head onto a perch with
one foot and remove the seeds with its bill. I did not see Streak-
headed and Flooded Mannikins feed in this manner. However my
observations on those species were few. Immelmann (1982) reported
that a Chestnut-breasted Mannikin might reach out and sieze a seed-
head with its bill and then place it under one foot. Once all the seeds
were consumed, it reached out and placed yet another seed-head
under its foot. This action might be repeated until four or five grass
stalks were held with the feet. It flew off when all the seeds were
consumed, with the stalks swinging back in various directions.
Juvenile grand Mannikins were also observed foraging on seeding
heads of a sedge, Cyperus iria , and a grass, Brachiaria mutica . The
sedge grows to about nine inches in height and the grass to about 18
inches. The mannikins jumped up from the ground and either
removed seeds in the process, or pulled the seeding head down and
clamped it onto the substrate with one foot and then removed the
seeds.
Insect-eating
On one occasion I observed about six juvenile Grand Mannikins
picking objects from the undersides of leaves of Cassava Manihot
esculenta. I could not see what was being consumed; I suspect that

they were taking small insects. Insects have been found in stomachs
of Streak-headed Mannikins on Karkar Island (Diamond and LeCroy
1979).
L. castaneothorax have been observed catching flying termites at
the beginning of their breeding season in Australia (Immelmann
1982). This behaviour should be looked for in New Guinea.
Consumption of Grit
At 4.45pm on 14th January and at 4.53pm on 15th January, I
observed groups of Grand and Chestnut-breasted Mannikins taking
grit from the ground. On 14th January two such groups were
observed foraging simultaneously. At each spot, as many as 25 birds
could be seen feeding at one time, however, these did not represent
two separate flocks. Individuals were coming and going from these
two sites at regular intervals. On 15th January only one of the sites
was being used. No grit consumption was observed on subsequent
days, the soil at Baitabag was very chalky and is derived from
Pleistocene corals (Matthew Jebb, pers. comm.). In addition to
aiding the birds in processing food, the consumption of grit probably
provided them with calcium and other minerals (Verbeek 1971).

Social Behaviour and Displays
Flocking behaviour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.961495222222222" page_id="56269551"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
Chestnut-breasted Mannikins were often seen flocking with Grand
or Grey-headed Mannikins at Baitabag and Moresby respectively.
Although Streak-headed Mannikins at Baitabag sometimes foraged
with Grand and/or Chestnut-breasted Mannikins, I found that they
tended more often to stay apart from the other species. They seemed
to favour a certain patch of grass at the forest edge on the southeast
portion of the Baitabag site and were mainly seen in pairs or small
flocks.
Roosting
Roosting and feeding sites appeared to be separated by great
distances. The congregation of mannikins at that site appeared to
consist of many separate flocks which left the feeding site at different
times. On 14th January I tried to estimate flock sizes and departure
times at Baitabag. the first two flocks left the meadow at 6.04pm
(Fig. 2). Eight different flocks left at 6.08pm. Otherwise one or two
flocks of mannikins left at intervals of from two to six months. Most
of them had departed by 6.33pm when 1 observed one mannikin
calling incessantly, flying in a large circle about ten feet off the

ground, then climbing to about 70 feet and following the others
heading in a southwesterly direction. I estimated that about 320
mannikins left the meadow that night.
Departure was accompanied by much calling, the flocks often
climbed up to a height of 50 to 70 feet above the ground, circled over
the meadow, and then flew towards the roost. The calling and circling
over the meadow might function as a signal to stragglers to join the
departing group. Indeed, on several occasions I saw small groups fly
up to join the circling calling group.
Although the Grey-headed Mannikins at Moresby foraged as one
or two groups as specific sites, arrival and departure was most often
in pairs. As pointed out earlier, this may be indicative of birds in the
process of breeding. Baitabag birds appeared to represent post-
breeding flocks.
Social Behaviour and the Social Tree
All the mannikin species observed were social in that they often
travelled to flocks and fed as a group. However, Grand, Chestnut-
breasted, and Grey-headed Mannikins are "distant" species (Sensu
Hediger 1964) in that they usually kept a few inches apart from their
neighbour upon landing on a perch. Only recently fledged juvenile

<bodyText confidence="0.998929473684211" page_id="56269553"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
Grand Mannikins were seen to perch side-by-side with bodily
contact. These observations are similar to those of Oberg (1975) for
other mannikins.
The flock of Grey-headed Mannikins was relatively tame,
permitting me to make observations on various aspects of their social
behaviour. They appeared to feed mostly on two patches of Sorghum
nitidum grass. These two patches were about 30 feet southeast and
southwest respectively, of a bare sapling which was about five feet
high. Groups of mannikins would gather on this bare sapling to
preen, sing, and to display. Chestnut-breasted Mannikins shared the
same display tree with the Grey-headed Mannikins. On one occasion
I saw a Grey-headed Mannikin preen the head of another. The
preenee fluffed its head feathers and tilted its head away from the
preener, who in turn stretched towards the preenee and nibbled at
the latter's head feathers. During the hotter periods of the day the
flock sometimes gathered in the shade provided by the bases of
Ophiurus tongcalingii , a green grass with tough canes. At time of
observation this grass was not yet in seed; it is conceivable that when
fruiting, this grass may provide yet another food source.

Undirected Singing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998219809523809" page_id="56269553"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
Displays were observed for only two species, Chestnut-breasted
Mannikins and Grey-headed Mannikins, both of which often
engaged in undirected singing., i.e. song not addressed at any other
bird. In this display the body is erect, the bill is kept wide open and
pointed forward, the feathers of the nape, back and belly are raised
and ruffled. Ruffling of the belly feathers is more exaggerated in the
Chestnut-breasted Mannikin. Holding this posture the bird sings its
whisper song, and turns its head in jerky movements from side to
side. Two to four seconds elapse between each head-turn.
The whisper songs were so soft that although I was only about 25
feet away from the singers and had a microphone mounted on a
parabolic reflector pointed at the singing bird, I could hear no song
through my earphones. The songs were drowned by the ambient
noise. It is possible that songs may be detected when these recordings
are analysed on a continuous spectral analyser which I plan to do at
a future date.
Undirected singing is performed throughout the day. Birds often
sing upon arrival at the social tree, irrespective of whether other birds
are also there. Aborted courtship attempts usually end up as bouts
of undirected singing. Birds also sing when resting at the base of the
Ophiurus grass during the hot periods of the day. On one occasion

I observed a Grey-headed Mannikin carry a green grass stem about
two feet in length by one end, fly onto an exposed perch, drop the
grass stem, posture and sing. Grass-carrying as a prelude to
displaying has been described for other mannikins (Baptista and
Horblit 1990).
Courtship displays
During courtship the male Grey-headed Mannikin exaggerated the
feather postures seen in undirected singing, i.e. the feathers were
erected more. In addition to feathers of nape and belly, those of the
rump were also erected (Fig. 3.). The bird twisted the tail in the
direction of the female, pointed his bill in her direction, displacement
bill-wiped once on the perch, and with bill held wide open sang and
approached the female in a series of hops. The bill was pointed down,
and the head moved from side to side as in undirected singing.
Displays were performed on horizontal branches, but also on erect
branches. The male might land below a female on an almost vertical
branch then hop upwards towards her. He might approach to within
an inch or two of the female. I never saw copulation. No "inverted
curtseys" (defined below) were observed.
Fig. 3. Courtship posture of Grey-headed Mannikin. Note that the head is pointed
down and the bill is held wide open. Feathers of the nape, rump and lower belly are
raised and ruffled providing the impression of broken contours.
I saw only one display performed by a Chestnut-breasted
Mannikin. The posture was similar to the Grey-headed Mannikin,
except that the body feathers were ruffled from the lower belly
almost to the breast, whereas the Grey-headed Mannikin ruffled on
the feathers of the lower belly. The adult male Chestnut-breast

displayed to a fledgling. I suspect that the display was not complete,
as Immelmann (1982) described an "inverted curtsey" portion in the
display, which 1 did not see in this case. In the inverted curtsey
display, the body bounces rhythmically up and down by alternate
stretching and bending movements of the legs (Goodwin 1982,
Baptista and Horblit 1990).
Flight display
On one occasion I observed a Chestnut-breasted Mannikin fly past
within about eight feet from me and about four feet above the
ground. Its head was pointed down, its bill held wide open and it was
uttering a loud (for a mannikin) series of clicks which sounded like
tik-tik-tik-tik-tik ... It fluttered its wings up and down as it flew past
me, glided with wings held out horizontally, fluttered again, glided
once more, fluttered once more and then dropped almost vertically
onto a patch of Sorghum.

Diamond (1972) studied mannkins at mid-montane sites in the
Eastern Highlands of New Guinea. He found recently created grassy
patches distributed as a checkerboard of montane islands, each one
supporting only one mannikin species. Diamond suggested that the
first successfully colonising species to arrive would prevent the
establishment of a second species. I found from two to as many as
four mannikin species in each of my lowland study sites. This is
perhaps due in part to the fact that the patches of grassland are more
extensive in the lowlands and also due in part to the presence of
Rottboelia exaltata , an abundant food source (Baptista 1990).
Most of the Grand Mannikins observed were juveniles in various
stages of post-juvenile moult. Post-juvenile moult in the related Five-
colored Mannikin L. quinticolor begins at the age of about 84 days
after hatching (Green 1986). If Grand Mannikins follow a similar
schedule, then the youngest begging fledglings encountered must
have hatched about mid-October.
Immelmann (1962, 1982) made detailed observations on all the
Australian estrildids, and found that the grass finches Poephilinae
tended to feed on the ground by jumping from the substrate to the
seeding heads, whereas the mannikins Lonchurinae tended to feed
while perched on grass stems and/or holding items with their feet. It
is noteworthy that Grand Mannikins (this study) employ both
methods of foraging.
Detailed observations on the poephiline estrildids indicate that

most species are highly social and conduct much of their activities on
a preferred "social tree" (Zann 1976, Immelmann 1982). Displays
and other social behaviour at a social tree were observed in the Grey-
headed Mannikin, the only species observed at the start of its
breeding season. The presence of social trees should be looked for
in the other mannikins.
The courtship display of the Grey-headed Mannikin is described
herein for the first time. The posture during courtship is similar to
that in L. castaneothorax , except that in the latter ruffling extends
beyond the belly to the lower breast. The courtship posture of both
these species differs from that in the Hooden Mannikin in that during
courtship the bill of the latter species points forward (Restall 1989)
whereas the bills of the other two species point down.
It is possible that the L. caniceps displays described herein are
incomplete, and may vary with seasons or with stages in the breeding
cycle since inverted curtseys usually accompany the courtship
displays of related Lonchura species.
The flight display described herein for the Chestnut-breasted
Mannikin appears to be the first such display described for any
mannikin. Immelmann (1982) described a flight display in Emblema
ruficauda during which the male held a blade of green grass in its
bill. These appear to be the only flight displays described to date for
estrildid finches.
In summary, as many as four mannikin species may occur together
in lowland savannahs of New Guinea. This is in contrast to the
highlands where the small grassy "islands" permit the occupancy by
only one species. Mixed flocks occur, although the Streak-headed
Mannikin appears to be less inclined to join multispecies mannikin
groups. The Grand Mannikin equipped with a larger, stronger bill
appears to be more versatile in its feeding habits than the other forms
observed. Some displays are described including what appears to be
the first description of a "flight display" for any mannikin. The Grey-
headed Mannikin was observed displaying on a selected "social tree"
in the manner of poephiline estrildids of Australia.

THREAT TO THE GOULDIAN FINCH IN THE WILD

It will come as a surprise to many aviculturists to learn that the
Gouldian Finch is now an endangered species. Its numbers in the
wild have declined rapidly, possibly because of infestation with an
air-sac mite and possibly because of loss of habitat. Now the
ramaining, small, wild breeding population is severely threatened by
proposed gold mining activities in the birds' restricted habitat by a
subsidiary company of Shell International. The following article and
appeal for action to prevent the disappearance from the wild for ever
of this incredibly beautiful little bird has been written by Michelle
Kanter and Sue Jackson of the Threatened Species Network of the
Northern Territory. Their address is do Environment Centre of the

YINBERRIE HILLS - GOULDIAN FINCHES
AND THE MT TODD GOLD PROJECT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9771665" page_id="56269562"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
By Michelle Kanter and Sue Jackson (Darwin).
A very large gold mine is currently being planned in the sub-humid
tropics of Northern Australia in an area called Yinberrie Hills, near
Kakadu - a World Heritage National Park. Unfortunately, the same
area is home to one of only two large breeding populations of wild
Gouldian Finches known in the world. If the mine goes ahead there
is a possibility that it will endanger the species survival in the wild.
The Gouldian Finch is one of the most beautiful birds found in
Australia, and many people will have seen it in aviaries. Very few,
however, have ever seen it in the wild. Once widely spread across
Northern Australia, the Gouldian has declined dramatically in
numbers during this century, particularly the last thirty years, and is
now officially recognised as an Endangered Species. The reasons for
this decline are not fully understood, but researchers have discovered
that many wild Gouldians are infested with air-sac mite. Possibly
changes to the Finches' habitat due to grazing by cattle and fire has
also meant that the birds are not surviving in some places where they
used to live.

Two sites have been found where Gouldian Finches breed in
substantial numbers. Both are in the Northern Territory, each area
containing in the order of 500-800 birds. There are isolated breeding
records to the east in Queensland (none recent), and to the west in
the Kimberleys of Western Australia, but no other major breeding
sites have yet been identified despite extensive searches.
Yinberrie Hills is a small area of rolling hills, covered with a
diverse mixed-Eucalypt and Ironwood woodland and a dense grass
understorey. Unlike the surrounding area, the Hills are in a near-
natural condition and are free from cattle and feral animals. Large
ferals such as buffalo, pigs and horses have caused serious habitat
degradation throughout most of the Territory, and introduced
predators such as fox and cat continue to take a heavy toll on native
wildlife. Gouldian Finches nest in unburnt tree hollows of Salmon
Gum Eucalyptus tintinnans and have specialised diet, eating seeds of
Sorghum sp. and a few other grasses. They drink daily and require
permanent water within a few kilometres of the nest.
The proposed gold mine is a project of the Mt Todd Joint
Venturers (MTJV), who are headed by Billiton Australia Gold, a
subsidiary of Shell. They plan to mine an extremely large but low-
grade, gold deposit on the margin of the Yinberrie Hills and, if
approved, mining would start later this year. They will extract and
process ore over a 14-19 year period. Mining will involve daily
blasting and use of heavy earth-moving machinery; the ore will be
processed at a plant next to the pit which will run continuously. The
question that must be answered is what effect this activity will have
on the Gouldian Finches living in the area. Billiton has expressed
concern about the birds and contributed money to World Wide Fund
for Nature (WWF) to pay for research, but is this enough?
Exploration in the area has already destroyed many potential nest-
sites.
The mine site is on the eastern boundary of the Gouldian Finch
habitat. The open pit and a water-storage dam will permanently
destroy 2.5% of this habitat. A larger dam in the Hills area is now
planned, which will cause further destruction. A tailings dam will be
sited near the mine and may cause poisoning in birds drinking from
the dam. There will be a zone of disturbance around the mine site
which is likely to affect Gouldian Finches through the impact of
noise, dust, blasting and traffic movement. In addition, mine
activities may lead to a change in the fire regime and the introduction
of weeds and feral animals. More frequent fires, or hot late-Dry
Season fires, may reduce the number of breeding sites and affect food

availability. In May 1990, a control burn in the area of the future pit
got out of control and burnt a large area of the Hills.
With the current level of knowledge of the Gouldian Finch's
biology, it is impossible to estimate the effects the mine will have on
the population. The company says that displaced birds can fly
elsewhere in the Hills. They may be physically able to do this, but
no-one knows whether they will continue to live and breed
successfully. Billiton also believes any impact will only be
temporary. However, studies have suggested that the wild Gouldians
have a very short life-span. Even a "temporary" impact on their
breeding success could be disastrous. In addition, the effects of
disturbance may be increased if birds are stressed by mite infestation.
The Mt Todd site, while being traditional country of the Jawoyn
people is not land over which the Jawoyn have any legal control,
except for sites of tribal significance. The Jawoyn have expressed
grave concern for the impact the mine may have on the Gouldian
Finch population, on exisiting water quality, the creek environment
downstream of the project area and on bush resources which they
still utilise. The Jawoyn are angry about damage that has already
been done and have requested that, if the mine were to proceed,
processing of the ore should occur off-site, and thus reduce its
impact. It is likely that Billiton will locate and want to mine other
gold deposits in the Hills area, in order to ensure the economic
viability of the project.
While the search for other large breeding sites continues, it is
absolutely imperative that known population centres are securely
protected. (Billiton maintains that they have located at least 3 other
breeding sites. In reality, these have been sightings of one or two
juvenile birds.) Currently no level of risk to the survival of the
Yinberrie Hills birds is acceptable. In fact, it would be far safer to
incorporate the area in the Nitmiluk National Park, which is only
10km away. Research can continue to try and work out a way to halt
the decline of the species, and eventually help it become re-
established over its old range.
Of course there is a large number of Gouldian Finches in
captivity. However, most people including aviculturists would be
very unhappy with the knowledge that the species was extinct in the
wild. It is unlikely at the moment that releasing birds to the wild will
be successful. Until we know why wild birds are not surviving,
releases are likely to suffer the same fate. Releases may also disrupt
natural patterns of genetic variation and further reduce the birds'
viability, rather than increase it.

Staff at Adelaide Zoo were jubilant earlier this year when a young
Mallee Fowl Leipoa ocellata hatched and successfully emerged from
its mound - the first successful breeding of the species at the zoo for
more than eight years. During the past two breeding seasons, 'Zoo
Watch' volunteers have spent many hours collecting data on the
Mallee Fowl's behaviour, its activity around the mound, mating, egg-
laying, humidity and temperature. The experience gained could
provide the basis for a conservation programme at Adelaide Zoo for
this threatened species - or in conjunction with that in operation with
the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service.
A significant breeding success at Orana Park, Christchurch (New
Zealand) was the successful rearing by their parents of four North
Island Kakas Nestor meridionalis septenironalis. This is the first time
this species has bred at Orana Park (which is only the second
institution to have bred them). Auckland Zoo has enjoyed continuing
success with Kakas and is working in conjunction with Orana Park
as co-ordinators of a project with the species.

The genus Charmosyna contains some of the most beautiful avian
species in existence. Until comparatively recently they were almost
unknown to aviculturists but during the last decade several members
of the genus have been imported. Many of them are now being bred
in this country and abroad. Is it too much to hope that they will be
established as aviary-bred strains? In the last issue of the A.M. there
was an interesting article by Dulcie Cooke about her breeding of the
Pleasing or Red-flanked Lorrikeet Charmosyna placens. Now she has
been successful with the Red-marked or Red-spotted species C.

Bristol Zoo, renowned for its very beautiful gardens and for its
remarkable breeding successes with several endangered mammalian
species, has never given much publicity to its bird collection despite
the fact that it has always contained some unusual, interesting and
beautiful species several of which, including the Victoria-Crowned
Pigeon, have bred successfully. Recently, some of the aviaries have
been refurbished and one has been completely re-designed and
rebuilt. A simple and delightful official opening of this aviary was
performed in May by our President, Miss Ruth Ezra, with her
characteristic charm. The aviary, part of which is a walk-through
enclosure containing an unobtrusive, ornithological, educational
plaque for young children, already accommodates several interesting
exhibits including pairs of Rothschild's grackles, Toco Toucans and
Luzon Bleeding-heart Pigeons and groups of the lovely Azure-
winged Magpie, Golden-backed Woodpeckers, Celebes King
Starlings and Red-tailed Laughing Thrushes. Other enclosures house
pairs of two species which have bred consistently at the zoo, the
Green Imperial Pigeon and the Yellow-collared Macaw, both of
which have young again this year.

In a very interesting Loro Parque Newsletter (No.23, May 91),
Tony Silva describes the lengthy, elaborate, occasionally frustrating,
but eventually successful efforts, which he and other park officials
made to obtain a mate for their female of the extremely rare Red-
necked Amazon Parrot Amazona arausiaca. The pair appears to be
compatible and there is every hope that the birds will breed. The
1991 breeding season started well at Loro Parque and several species
of Cockatoo, (including Leadbeater's) Amazon Parrot and Conure
(including Queen of Bavaria's) were being reared in May. The
newsletter includes lists of species which are sought by and which are
available from the park and ends with Tony Silva's opinion that trade
in wild parrots will be banned at the next CITES meeting later this
year.

The very successful Parrot Society, which celebrates the twenty
fifth anniversary of its formation this year, has produced at three year
intervals since 1981, a register summarising the breeding results of
its members for the year. The register is not only of great interest
but also of great importance in demonstrating the activities of private
aviculturists in conservation and in emphasising the considerable part
which they may play in the future in the preservation of endangered
species. In spite of the regrettable fact that less than a fifth of the
5000 membership of the Society made a contribution to the Register
the results were remarkable and indicate clearly the role which
private aviculture can play in conservation. The Australian
parrakeets have maintained their popularity with breeders and
almost all of the species of the genera Alisterus , Polytelis,
Platycercus, Psephotus and Neophema are well established with the
possible exception of Golden-shouldered and Brown's parrakeets
and, of course, Rock and Orange-bellied Parrakeets which have
hardly ever been present in European collections. Turquoisine and
Splendid Parrakeets which are still considered as endangered species
are recorded in numbers of more than a thousand. Large numbers
of African Peach-faced, Masked and Fischer's Lovebirds were also
bred as well as encouragingly increased numbers of the Black-
cheeked and Nyassa species which were becoming uncommon in
British aviaries. Considerable increases have also occurred in the
numbers of Conures, Macaws and other South American Parrots,
Cockatoos and African Grey Parrots. The register reflects the recent
increase in interest in Lories and Lorrikeets. Imported specimens of
many species almost unknown to aviculture have been available in
the last few years and the success with which they have adapted to
aviary life is shown by the successful breedings recorded in the
register which include 15 Stella's, 13 Red-flanked, 8 Fairy and 5
Josephine's Lorrikeets of the genus Charmosyna as well as many
successful breedings of other genera which, until recently, were more
familiar to aviculturists. The Parrot Society deserves our congratula-
tions on this and its other efforts to ensure that our fascinating hobby
of aviculture remains viable.

The press release from the company Databird Worldwide Limited,
made in the context of the present political arguments concerning the

as a noun). "It has been the policy of Databird Worldwide Limited
since 1986 not to import or trade in wild caught birds. This is a very
successful policy to date for this organisation. Databird fully supports
a total ban of only wild caught birds destined for the pet market.
However we do not support a total ban of wild caught birds. There
is considerable debate about the capture and trade of 'pest' species
of parrot which can be successfully bred in order to generate suitable
stock for resale either to the pet trade or for further breeding. Each
species must be considered individually and this will always be a
controversial area. There are good reasons for limiting the trade of
any species from certain countries. Secondly there are species which
are suffering from habitat destruction. The species resident on many
Indonesian islands are having trees felled from under their feet for
use as chop-sticks, hardwood double glazing and doors. In this case
the birds have lost nest sites and in some cases even trees to sit in!
They will perish. Captive breeding can save these birds and
ultimately the species. The arguments concerning captive breeding
are often centred around the maintenance of a &amp;quot;diverse gene pool".
This is useful but little understood or appreciated. If captive stocks
are carefully managed, and this requires the compilation of stud
books in many cases, populations of many species can be maintained
for numerous generations, this often requires the "trade" in birds to
continue internationally to expand the available breeding gene pool
enabling breeders in other countries to exchange stock. A total ban
on the trade in birds or restrictive registration schemes will negate
these issues and impede the continued maintenance of the captive
stocks. Databird has, through its breeding, incubation, hand-rearing
and research facilities, reared no fewer than 100 different species of
Psittacines including Palm Cockatoos Probisciger aterrimus, Shining
Parrot Prosopeia tabuensis, Mullers Parrot Tanygnathus sumatranus,
Fig Parrots Psittaculirostris spp and many other rare or endangered
species. We also rear large numbers of healthy parrots ideally suited
for the pet market enabling us to recommend birds suitable for
prospective pet owners. We would not consider selling a Shining
Parrot as a pet! During the last six years Databird has formed an
excellent relationship with many conservation groups including the
International Council for Bird Preservation, Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds and Government departments assisting them in
any way that we could. Databird has therefore become established
as one of the serious breeders, rearers and an authority on captive
bred Psittacines in the United Kingdom. The sister company
Databird Worldwide Scientific Limited has been established to carry

out research into many and diverse avian fields which include
taxonomy, population studies, ecology, and pathology. We are
currently involved with many field studies jointly with universitites,
zoos and private aviculturists on an international scale. The research
involving chromosome studies has allowed more than 120 species of
Psittacine to be studied (over 400% of the species studies by all other
researchers, worldwide). This work has enabled one of only two
international chromosomal sexing services to be established, a
technique which remains the safest and most accurate way of sexing
birds available to aviculturists. DNA fingerprinting is being
promoted for Psittacines in both conservation and pedigree analysis
for identification. Both companies have promoted in many ways
research into a variety of fields, most recently becoming involved
with research into Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease, which
remains a very serious disease for any Psittacine keeper. Through
these research projects and captive breeding we are able to improve
the maintenance and propagation of captive Psittacines but also act
as an example to government departments and "protectionist" groups
that aviculture is acting in the interests of all parrots, especially for
their long term future. We must act in a positive way in answering
any campaign against aviculture, not aggressively or defensively.
After all we all think that we have the interests of the parrots at

Psittaculture - The Breeding , Rearing and Management of Parrots.
By Tony Silva. Published by Birdworld, Farnham, Surrey. Price
#29.50.
This is a major work by a world renowned Aviculturist. It is very
comprehensive with 44 chapters dealing with every aspect of the
husbandry of Parrots of many species. It cannot be considered an
easy book of reference, for example, if one wishes to look up egg
candling, one has to read the whole chapter on incubation. The list
of chapters does not compensate for the lack of an index. Some
references in the list of contents can be misleading, for example one
would not expect to find Greenwing and Amboina Kings lumped
together with the popular Australian King under Australian
Broadtailed Parrots. The book is handsomely produced in hardback
form. It is refreshing to handle a new book published on good quality
glossy paper with a huge number of colour pictures taken in aviaries
many of which are outstandingly good. This excellent book would
have been much easier to read and assimilate if the Author had not
let his enthusiasm for writing run away with him, involving overlong
paragraphs and the use of esoteric language. In many instances, some
of the words used do not feature in the standard English dictionaries.
Simple language makes a bigger impression on a greater number of
readers and has a grace of its own.
Tony Silva's sentiments concerning the wisdom of giving very
careful consideration to all the implications of the work,
responsibility etc., before acquiring a pet bird are to be applauded.
Those wishing to obtain a parrot will find a tremendous amount of
valuable information in the chapters devoted to pets for the home.
Perhaps one of this work's greatest strengths is the vast amount of
practical advice which it contains, this is the result of experience and
is charmingly written on the care, feeding, housing and maintenance
of birds. Every aspect is dealt with, from food for different species
to aviary sizes, incubation, handrearing and ringing, including the use
of microchips. A wealth of detail is given, including the weights of
various parrot chicks which is most useful to those embarking on
handrearing. The list of ring sizes is also valuable. The recipes for
nectar and dry food for Lories and Lorrikeets will be especially useful
to those about to take up the keeping of these-fascinating birds. Ten
Lory keepers are sure to have ten different ways of feeding their
birds, and one can learn so much from reading about other people's
methods.

There are chapters on all the species of parrots which are available
to Aviculture including some very interesting ones on some of the
rarities such as the Shining Parrots and Pesquet's Parrot. The last
chapter gives details of the "unknowns" which, perhaps some day in
years to come, will become available to Aviculture. The appendix on
sexual differences in dimorphic species will be of value to many
Aviculturists. Perhaps one of the most important chapters in this
valuable addition to the works on Aviculture is the one on pressures
on wild parrot populations, admirably pointing out the predicament
in which both Governments and people find themselves when the
preservation of birds cannot be tolerated because of the immense
damage they do to crops etc. Many countries can only try to alleviate
the stress of lack of food, work etc for their people and at the same
time endeavour to set aside some small part of their land for the
preservation of endangered species of birds, animals and plants. The
writer's heartfelt pleas to all experienced Aviculturists to specialise
in one or more undomesticated species of parrot and actively
endeavour to breed as many as possible of their chosen bird should
not go unheeded. Tony Silva belongs to that group of Aviculturists
who really understand the birds in their care and who can
communicate with them in much the same way as humans talk
amongst themselves. He is obviously a man who can understand
every gesture, every look as though it were spoken in human
language. This is a rare gift and any book written by such a writer is
one to be acquired and treasured.

South African Birds - A Photographic Guide. By Ian Sinclair.
Struik Publishers, Cape Town, South Africa, 1990. ISBN 0 86977
7949. One hundred and forty-four page paperback, with numerous
colour photographs and distribution maps.
This is a pocket guide to 265 of the most conspicuous and
commonly encountered birds found in Southern Africa. The latter
includes the Republic, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique.
There is good overall coverage, from the Ostrich and Jackass or
Black-footed Penguin, to the Golden-breasted, Cape and Lark-like
Buntings. Several European migrants which winter in the south are
included. Aviculturists will find among the 265 species, many familiar
and popular park/zoo birds and cage and aviary species.

help identify the different groups of birds. Each species is illustrated,
most by one or two colour photographs, one species by three and
another by four, depending on the need to show different plumages
and/or the bird in flight. The photos, almost without exception of a
high standard, are the work of various photographers, including
fellow member Neville Brickell.
A map plots each species' range in southern Africa. Because of
the tight format of this guide, the maps are of necessity very small.
The area of distribution is coloured grey, which on some maps,
particularly the coastal bird ones, I found difficult to pick-out. A
paragraph of text describes salient features enabling the bird to be
identified accurately and there is reference to their preferred habitat.
This guide scores high marks for its photographs and general
presentation. Each species' photo or photos, distribution map and
text are together on the same page. With one exception, there are
two species to each page.
It is suggested that this guide is used in conjunction with more
comprehensive books, a good reason, though not necessarily the
most important, why I feel it would be helpful to have included
scientific names. Also, there must be many like me, who have still
to get to grips with metric measurements, and would appreciate the
birds' sizes being included in good old-fashioned feet and inches.

Birds of the Transkei. An ornithological history and annotated
catalogue of all recorded species. By C. D. Quickelberge. Durban
Natural History Museum, 1989. ISBN 0 620 131403. One hundred
and thirty-four page paperback, with one colour plate, 88 colour
photographs, several monochrome illustrations and photographs,
and a map. Available from the Secretary General, Department of
Agriculture and Forestry, Private Bag X5002, Umtata, Republic of
Transkei.
Transkei, in case you are wondering, is on the south-eastern corner
of Africa. Roughly rectangular in shape, Transkei is only about 250
x 130km (156 x 81 miles). It is bordered to the north by Natal, to the
west by Lesotho, to the south by eastern Cape Province, and the
eastern side is bounded by the Indian Ocean.
It has a rich avifauna, which includes tropical African species, birds
from the drier west and more temperate south, plus Palaearctic
migrants. Transkei is badly affected by deforestation, soil erosion and
other habitat degradation, and is subject to droughts. Some species
have declined or disappeared, others have profited from the changing
conditions.

Four hundred and sixty-one species have been recorded, with the
suggestion that others remain unrecorded and the true total maybe
nearly 500. Scarce or rare there during the early decades of this
century, the Cattle Egret was the most common larger (starling-sized
upwards) species seen during roadside bird counts carried out
between 1969 and 1979. Next in the Top 18' larger birds, came three
members of the Crow family, then the Yellow-billed (Black) Kite,
and Pied Starling, followed by the Cape Vulture. Six colonies of
Cape Vultures are known, and there may be others.
Many of the better known African species familiar in aviculture
occur there, from the larger ones, down to the sunbirds, among them
the Malachite, and most of the popular smaller seedeaters. More
unusual species include Gurney's Sugarbird.
This is a well produced and attractively presented publication.
Each species is catalogued under its English common name current
in southern African ornithology, its scientific name, and where
known, its Xhosa name. The author has drawn on data from the
latter part of the last century, through to the present time. The
records reveal many interesting facts, eg. during the last quarter of
the 19th century, thousands of Black-winged Pratincoles appeared
each mid-summer (". . . four shots brought down as many as 50 . .
."), but it seems that this Palaearctic migrant has not been recorded
there since 1909. The author attributes its disappearance to locust
control measures!
Painted by P. A. Clancey, the excellent colour plate, shows the
Spotted and Orange Ground Thrushes. Interspersed among the text
are other birds painted by Dr. Clancey. The colour photographs,
most by Neville Brickell and Peter Craig-Cooper, show a variety of
other species. Other photos give ideas of some of the different kinds
of countryside and portray early recorders of Transkei bird-life.

This extremely clear and well organised book gives details of stock,
sexing, breeding, life cycles, feeding, handling, and where relevant,
health warnings. There is a most useful glossary of terms used in the
text and addresses where live food and equipment may be purchased
are also included. This book will prove invaluable to everyone who
keeps any species of bird requiring live food, and is a most useful
source of information for Aviculturists.

Parrots in Captivity. Proceedings of Symposium 14 of the
Association of British Wild Animal Keepers. Obtainable from June
Sherborne, 12 Jackley Road, Eastville, Bristol, BS5 6UQ. Price
#3.50 (#2.50 to ABWAK members) including postage.
This little book contains the printed versions of seven communica-
tions presented at the above Symposium. The subjects ranged from
the colony of Roseate Cockatoos at Blackpool Zoo to parrot eggs
and throughout particular emphasis was paid to parrot breeding and
the role of aviculture in the conservation of endangered species. All
of the articles are interesting and original and it is a particular
pleasure to see some of the interesting, entertaining, controversial
and wise views of Harry Sissons in print! It is a pity that it was
possible to include the Editor's synopsis only of Andrew
Greenwood's contribution for, clearly, it contained new information
and concepts about diseases in parrots. In a remarkably informative
introduction the Editor (Rob Colley) referred to the underlying
mistrust between the professional zoologist and the private
aviculturist which was evident at the symposium. Many private
aviculturists have doubts about the ability of zoos to keep and breed
parrots and the zoo people are sceptical about private aviculturists'
willingness to co-operate in and be commited to a long term project.
The symposium provided an opportunity for members of the two
groups to meet and work towards a better understanding and
resolution of their conflicting views about their mutual interest. It
also resulted in the publication of this informative booklet which, I
believe, will be of great interest to every aviculturist.

(Curator, Breeding Centre, Palmitos Park, Gran Canaria)
The White-eared Conure Pyrrhura leucotis was fairly well known in
Europe until 1967 when Brazil ceased to permit the export of its fauna.
Although two sub-species, emma and auricularis, are found in Ven-
ezuela, they have rarely been exported. In the late 1960s most breeders
were interested in Australian parrakeets and the attractive Pyrrhura
conures were almost ignored. I found them fascinating and kept several
species (Low, 1967, 1968) but, regrettably never had the opportunity to
obtain leucotis . Within a few years it became virtually unknown in the UK
and rare or unknown elsewhere in Europe. In February 1989 I moved to
Gran Canaria where I was delighted to find eight of the nominate race in
the collection, housed together in a large aviary. It is the smallest species
of the genus, about 8 in (21cm) long, approximately the length of an
exhibition Budgerigar but of a more slender build and weighs about 50g.
It is strikingly marked and has rich red-brown cheeks, maroon abdomen
and rump, blue nape, white ear coverts and white scalloping on the upper
breast. The bend of the wing is scarlet, the tail is maroon and the
upperparts are dark green. It is surely one of the most attractive of the
genus. It could be confused with the Painted Conure P. picta but in this
species the white markings on the breast feathers are pointed, whereas in
leucotis they are rounded.
This article describes the prolific nature of these birds over a period of
two and a half years. In 1989 the eight birds (three pairs and two males)
were placed one pair per cage in all-wire cages raised above the ground.
The cages were 5 ft. (1.5 m) long, 3 ft. 4 in (1 m) wide and 1 m high. They
were in an open outdoor area until October 1989 when they were moved
to a large enclosed building containing over 100 cages, on metal stands,
housing neotropical parrots, Eclectus and lories. Large open areas in the
roof covered by shade cloth (fine mesh plastic netting) make the atmos-
phere sunny and airy. Enclosed areas like these are necessary in this
mountain location to protect the birds from strong sun and high winds.

The Conures had been surgically sexed. Pairs were made up at random
since it was difficult to identify individuals to discover whether pair bonds
had already been formed. In 1989 only one pair nested. Four eggs were
laid and the incubation period was 20 days for each of the last two eggs
(unknown for the first two). Two young were reared by the parents and
two by Red-bellied Conures P. frontalis with one of their own. In 1990
the same female laid the first of three eggs on 16th February. Chicks
hatched on 12th, 14th and 15th March and were all reared by the parents.
In their second clutch, laid in May, there were again four eggs which
hatched, one on 6th or 7th June, two on 8th June and one on 10th June.
Again, all were reared without mishap. In 1991, the female nested even
earlier. Five eggs were laid, on 10th, 12th, 14th or 15th, and 17th January;
the date of the fifth was unrecorded. Incubation apparently did not start
until the second egg was laid, for two chicks hatched on 4th February, to
give an incubation period of 23 days for the second egg. The other chicks
hatched on 6th, 8th and 11th February, hence the incubation period was
22 or 23 days. The weather was cool during the incubation period, as cool
as 50 deg F (10 deg C) on some days. The third chick died within a few
minutes of hatching and the fifth died when it was five days old, perhaps
it was too small to compete with the other chicks - although Pyrrhuras are
usually good at keeping smaller chicks well-fed. The total production of
this pair in three seasons was therefore 16 eggs, 16 chicks of which 14 were
reared.
A second pair first nested in 1990. The first of six eggs was laid on 13th
March, the second on the 15th the third on the 17th but the dates for the
others were unrecorded. All six eggs hatched; the incubation period for
the first three was 24 days. All six chicks were successfully reared by the
parents. In 1991 the early part of the year was unusually cool, as already
mentioned, yet the female laid a few days earlier, the first of six eggs being
laid on 3rd March. The second egg was laid on the 6th and the others at
two day intervals. Again, incubation could not have commenced until the
second egg was laid, as the first two chicks hatched on 28th March, 25 and
22 days after being laid. The other eggs in the clutch also hatched after
22 days incubation. The smallest of the six chicks was so much smaller
than the largest that I transferred it to the nest of a pair of Blue-throated
Conures Pyrrhura cruentata where it was the eldest in the nest and well-
fed. It was with the cruentata from days 1 to 22 when it was large enough
to be transferred back to its parents' nest. All six chicks were successfully
reared. They left the nest between 11th and 20th May and were removed
on 7th June. The female laid the five eggs of her second clutch between
10th and 18th June. Unfortunately on 20th June she was observed to have
left the nest and the eggs were cold. We then realised that she had been

out of the nest on the previous day. She had a small injury just above her
leg, caused by a protruding nail in the nest-box. The eggs were transferred
to an incubator but the outcome of this clutch is not known at the time of
writing. However, to date the performance of this pair is 12 eggs and 12
young reared in two clutches during a period of 12 months - again 100 %
hatchability and 100% rearing success.
Pair number three first nested in April 1990. The female laid the first
of six eggs on 1st April and there were five eggs in the nest on the 8th. Her
first four eggs hatched after 20, 20,19 and 18 days incubation. The fifth
egg hatched after 24 days and the sixth egg four days later. This was almost
certainly because the female ceased to brood the eggs after the fourth chick
hatched and the eggs had to rely on the heat generated by the other chicks,
thus lengthening the incubation period. As a result, the sixth chick was
too small to receive a fair share of food and it died three days after
hatching. I now know that later eggs in large clutches should be artificially
incubated and returned to the nest as they pip, the eldest chicks then being
removed for hand-rearing. In this way, a large size discrepancy between
any two consecutive chicks is avoided. In this nest the eldest chick died
when it was 13 days old. The reason was not known. In 1991 the female
excelled herself by laying nine eggs, at intervals of two and thee days,
between 7th and 29th April. Every egg hatched, the first two after 24 and
23 days and the others after 21 and 22 days, except the ninth which hatched
after 23 days incubation. One hatched in the incubator and another under
another pair of cruentata to which it was transferred because there were
too many eggs in the nest. The chick with the cruentata was removed
when it was 11 days old and hand-reared. The second chick appeared
dehydrated when ten days old when it also was removed and hand-reared.
On 7th June these two chicks were returned to the nest-box of their parents;
the sixth and ninth chicks had died, so they then had seven in the nest. The
first two left just over one week later. By 29th June six young had left the
nest. In a period of 13 months this female produced 15 eggs in two
clutches, all of which hatched and from which 11 chicks were reared.
In 1990 the four 1989 young were surgically sexed and found to be all
females. They were therefore set up in trios with the two surplus males.
Before being sexed, however, the six birds were housed together. One pair
nested and hatched a chick on 17th July which died at six days. In 1991
one trio of two females and one male produced five eggs in January. One
hatched on 15th February but was not well fed after 13 days, so was
removed and hand-reared. The fifth egg hatched on 22nd February but the
chick was found dead in the nest on the day it hatched. One female was
removed from the cage on 20th April - but at the time of writing (the end
of June) the other female has not laid again. The other pair fulfilled my

good expectations of the species by producing six eggs, all fertile, the first
four being laid on 20th, 22nd, 24th and 26th April. All six hatched, the
incubation periods for the third and fourth eggs being 23 and 24 days.
Foster parents were urgently needed for a Blue-throated Conure so this
was added to their nest and the fifth and sixth eggs were transferred to the
nest of a pair of Cuban Conures Aratinga euops whose eggs were infertile.
At the time of writing, 29th June, only the eldest youngster from this pair
has left the nest. The two with the Cubans were badly plucked on the head
and breast, but those with their parents, plus the cruentata, are all perfect
young which should shortly leave the nest. Once again, fertility, hatchability
and rearing was 100%.
The number of days the young spend in the nest is usually 43 to 45 but
has varied between 42 and 48. At first the young spend very short periods
out of the nest so that sometimes one cannot be certain about which day
they first left. At this stage their plumage is softer in colour than that of
the adults, with less pronounced barring on the breast. There is no blue
on the forehead. The maroon patch on the abdomen is duller and less
extensive. The skin of the cere and surrounding the eye is whitish (grey
in adults). The pads on the sides of the upper mandible are still soft. The
young then have a very gentle and appealing appearance. Incidentally, I
have tried to discern whether there is any difference in the plumage of
adult males and females, but can see none which are consistent.
White-eared Conures readily accept a wide variety of foods. They
have a dry mixture of small seeds (canary, safflower, oats and a little hemp
and sunflower), some of the mixture for the larger parrots (soaked
sunflower, boiled maize (which they leave) and chopped fresh vegetables
such as carrot, Swiss chard, and other items in season such as broccoli and
radish) and various fruits, either chopped or halved (usually apple, pear,
orange, papaya and cactus fruits). Favoured rearing foods are fresh corn,
spray millet and sunflower seed. A rearing food made from hard-boiled
egg, carrot, whole grain bread and non-fat cheese, is fed as a soft crumbly
mixture. Blocks of fine mineral grit are always available and cuttlefish
bone is given when possible. Seventeen of the young were housed for
some months in two cages right outside my kitchen door. They received
many leftovers from the table and would eat almost anything offered,
instantly investigating anything placed in the food dishes. When they
were moved to a larger aviary, I sorely missed their inquisitive little faces
peering in through the window!
All the young were closed-ringed with 6mm or 5.5mm internal
dimension rings. The correct size is 5.5mm and the ring should be fitted
at about 16 days. The young are left at least one month with their parents
after leaving the nest. Two which were hand-reared in 1991 were returned

to their parents 1 nest which contained another five young, just before they
were due to fledge. This is the easiest way to integrate hand-reared young
into the family but, of course, can be carried out only if there are other
young in the nest. It was a joy to watch them after removal from their
parents, in groups of about eight, feeding, bathing or preening together.
They are lively, inquisitive and playful in the extreme. At the time of
writing we have 28 young in one large aviary, where these characteristics
are less apparent.
To sum up the above experiences, five pairs nesting over one, two or
three seasons produced 54 eggs, of which 51 hatched and from which 44
young were reared, two pairs rearing young from all the eggs laid. (The
nest produced in a small cage with six birds is discounted as the conditions
were not suitable for breeding.) Few non-domesticated parrots in avicul-
ture could equal this performance. In a period of 29 months the original
eight have increased to 51. One young bird died suddenly when a few
months old but no other losses of adults or young adults have occurred.
This Conure is undoubtedly a very suitable subject for aviculture. Alas,
the day may come when the Brazilian race depends on aviculture for its
very existence. In Brazil it occurs only in the south-east (one of the most
disturbed and vulnerable rainforest areas in the world), in primary or
slightly disturbed forest and at forest edges. Scott and Brooke (1985)
include leucotis in their list of Endangered Forest Avifauna of South-
eastern Brazil. It was studied during 1980 to 1982 in the Serra do Tingua,
Rio de Janeiro, where it was described as rare, and at the Sooretama
Biological Reserve, Espirito Santo, where it was found to be common
(more than 10 birds seen or heard daily). This conure has become rare in
aviculture. The young reared at Palmitos Park will be sent to other
European collections so that hopefully, at least in the UK, the species will
at last become established. One of the most attractive of the genus, with
a voice which is relatively weak for a conure, it has many qualities to
recommend it.

The Silver-eared Mesia Leiothrix argentauris is a close relative of
the slightly smaller and more common avicultural subject the Pekin Robin
L. lutea . As its name implies, the Mesia has large ear patches of silver
- an unusual colour in feathers. Habits, temperament and care of both
species are identical and the reader is referred to the article on the Pekin
Robin in the Avicultural Magazine, 1978, 84,4-17.
A bird of hill country for preference, the Mesia overlaps the Pekin
Robin from the Eastern Himalayas to Western China, but also ranges far
to the south, down through Indo-China into Sumatra. Both species are
'bush' birds and are extremely uncomfortable in bare surroundings. Like
all of the babbler group, a single Leiothrix is nervous and unhappy and
every effort should be made to keep them in pairs and in planted
surroundings. They are easy birds to maintain in good condition. They
can stand any amount of cold if kept in dry, roofed enclosures, with shelter
from prevailing winds - as all aviaries should be built.
Mesias are dimorphic, so sexing is no problem. The cock has a scarlet
collar, throat and rump. Both birds have a red patch on the wing and this
is the only red on the hen. The maximum spread and intensity of the
scarlet collar and throat may not be reached until the second or third year.
Chicks can be sexed at a week old, just as soon as the tail coverts are
through. These are rusty red on males, while the hens' are buff. The pair
mates for life and the birds are rarely far apart. They spend much time in
affectionate mutual grooming and sleep huddled together.
The birds have quite a variety of chirps and quiet whistles with which
they communicate throughout the year. Shared with lutea is the angry
chattering that alarmed birds make at cats or at strange, brightly coloured,
unnatural (i.e. manufactured) objects. Also shared is the explosive alarm
whistle they use when chased or caught up. Sometimes this call is made
when a crow is nearby. Crows are the only creatures which inspire real
fear in all types of birds kept outdoors. The breeding song is a blackbird-
loud, five note call with which the cock shakes the surroundings. The
cock uses a quiet, often shortened version of this song if he is separated
from the hen. She replies with a high-pitched, thin double trill. Also when
breeding a quiet 'churr' is made in the privacy of thick vegetation. When
the song is warming up at the beginning of the season, or more so when
it is winding down in late summer, the cock shortens this to four notes (the

second two, repeated) or he will whistle only two or three notes of the
original five. The song is not very musical, but is not unattractive or
annoying. Male chicks were heard to make loud and determined efforts
at the song when between six and seven weeks of age.
The natural prey is insects, with some vegetable matter as available.
Worms are not eaten. A limited variety of fruit is taken, habit probably
being the governing factor. My birds readily took chopped grapes,
blueberries, and occasionally ate raspberries etc. They consumed half
an apple per pair most days of the year and pecked a little at orange slices
in warm weather. Banana and other large soft fruit was never touched.
They regularly ate a few buds, shoots, flowers and millet that grew in the
aviary, but most of the time these items were just picked and dropped. My
original wild-caught pair ate powdered dog-food and passed this conven-
ient habit, along with the above food preferences, down to the &amp;quot;grand-
chicks". The other mainstay of the diet (as it is with all birds here) was
peanut butter and margarine sandwiches, chopped up or put through a
hand-operated meat-grinder. When kept outdoors on the above diet, the
males developed an intense shade of scarlet. Housing birds indoors has
an adverse effect on red colour, as does a restricted diet without, for
example, fruit, greens or margarine. Food was placed on a small wooden
platform on top of a 20&amp;quot; (0.5m) stand, just outside the kitchen window.
This made it easy to check that all birds had access to the food and to note
what they were eating.
The original, wild-caught, pair was bought in March and kept in a 4&apos;
(1.2m) long cage with sides of plastic sheeting. This type of cage is easy
to make, light in weight and is ideal for birds like Leiothrix which are
inclined to damage themselves against cage wire. An aviary was
hurriedly constructed, the pair was put out at the end of May and they
obligingly laid eggs by the 22nd of June. Most of my observations were
made of the birds in this 16&apos; x 12&apos; (5m x 3.7m) aviary, which was built
across an L-shaped part of the house, roofed over and enclosed on three
sides. It was open to the south and blinds were put on the clear plastic roof
in the summer. The enclosure was built against a large kitchen window,
which afforded a view of the whole space, and the birds could be
observed over lunch! The only large plant in the first year was a
transplanted bushy Camellia, trimmed down to about T (2.25m). Camel-
lias are ideal for aviaries and the twig structure provides many nesting
sites. Later, the spaces were filled with Hollyhocks, Honeysuckle and
Passion Vines and a variety of flowers and ground cover (including
Strawberries). The floor was covered mainly with a mulch made of
shredded Christmas trees, which provided hours of fun for the birds and
also had a pleasant smell of pine.

Unlike lutea, the Mesias did not regularly nest with the arrival of 12
hours of daylight. Rather, they waited for a warm sunny spell of weather,
which in Portland can occur at any time from February until June. This
is probably a reflection of the Mesias&apos; distribution being nearer the
Equator. Once they suspended nesting activities with the arrival of a long
dull cool spell in the mid-sixties (18* C). Nesting was spread over the
period from 16th April to 18th August.. The bill loses its blackish end and
becomes clear ivory when the birds are ready to nest. The cock displays
by holding a grass stem and stretching bolt upright, with raised head
feathers. Both birds then raise the wings above head-height, with the hen
sometimes holding grass too. Then they slowly bow heads and bob tightly
folded tails. Prior to building, both birds fly ceaselessly back and forth,
carrying nesting material. The cock then chooses a site and loops long
stems, thin string etc. around twigs to form a nest base. When a substantial
base has been built, the hen finishes the greater part of the nest. Usual
construction time is three days, with the first nest of the year often taking
longer. Many extra nests were built, especially by young birds which
built two for every one used. Nests were built in bushes and plants at from
3&apos; - 5 Vi\ 1 m -1.7 m.) from the ground and most were made in Hollyhocks.
The lowest nest was slung betweeen the stems of a clump oiHelianthus.
Of 18 nests, 17 were constructed of black horsehair, usually with some
grass stems forming the base. Sometimes a few dried leaves were
incorporated into the lining. In their third summer of nesting, the old pair
made a radical departure from the usual by making a nest out of grass and
lining it with dried leaves and only a few strands of horsehair. Often the
nests tilted badly, especially those in the Hollyhocks, and all were shored
up with bunches of dried grass and supported by wiring twigs alongside.
Eventually so many twigs were wired to the Hollyhocks that successful
nests were built on these without requiring further support. Males
invariably went directly to the nest, while hens took a circuitous, more
secretive route.
Three large eggs were always laid. These averaged 21.75 x 16 mm
(7/8 x 5/8&amp;quot;) and completely filled the bottom of the nest. One egg weighed
3.25 g. The eggs are dirty-looking off-white with large reddish brown
spots at the bigger end. Spots range from a few in number to a heavy ring
of them around the end. Hatching time is usually 13 days from when the
hen commences sitting. At night the cock sleeps on the edge of the nest
or on an adjacent twig. Sometimes he will sleep in the nest itself, squeezed
between the hen and the rim. The cock relieves the hen for up to ten
minutes at a time but usually sits just long enough for her to feed. As
incubation progresses, cocks sit more frequently, probably because the
hens are off more as chicks get closer to hatching. At this stage, one cock

was timed to sit for 47 minutes, in short spells, out of a total of 1 Vi hours.
Usually the cock sits for up to 5 minutes at 30 - 40 minute intervals.
Newly hatched chicks are the usual pink - tinged grey of young birds, with
sparse, dark grey down. The gape is pinkish orange. Chicks in early nests
were fed commercial waxmoth larvae and maggots oiSarcophaga bulata
(a sort of blow-fly) supplemented with mealworm pupae rolled in soft
margarine. They also received two or three supplemental hand-feedings
from day two to day six, of scrambled egg and margarine mashed in milk.
Chicks from the middle of July on were fed almost exclusively on that most
useful insect and complete food, the grasshopper. No hand-feedings were
given to these chicks but mealworms were put out when grasshopper
supplies ran low. About 150 half-grown grasshoppers were caught each
day and supplied at intermittent intervals. Plastic sheeting was stapled
to the outside lower half of the cage wire to prevent them escaping.
Fledglings leave the nest when they are about 12 days old and can fly
about 3&apos;(1m). They immediately scramble up into the highest cover they
can find, where both parents feed them. The cock uses non-live food at
this stage if no insects are available. Chicks are fed for up to 34 days,
although they can feed themselves by three weeks of age. This period
is dependent on whether and if the hen lays another clutch. All the chicks
and eggs were examined at least once a day, the adults sometimes
chattering mildly, or simply waiting quietly to return.
Mesias are excellent aviary birds. They are brightly coloured, bold
without being aggressive, become quite tame and they are constantly on
the move. This latter is important if you like watching your birds. The
only drawback to L.argentauris is their propensity for nipping offshoots.
It is impossible to establish plants like vines in their presence and they can
be hard on flowers and buds. A heavy mass of plants helps to overcome
this. In the third summer the wild hen was seen to pluck a sprig of
Nasturtium. She stood up high in an &apos;anting&apos; pose and vigorously scrubbed
herself with the plant for two or three spells of 10-15 seconds. This action
was also previously carried out by a young Pekin Robin hen with an
Acdnidia shoot. As there was an Actinidia vine in the next aviary it
was tasted to see if it had the same &apos;nippy&apos; flavour as Nasturtium , but it
did not. The only obvious common factor was that both sprigs were sappy.
This phenomenon must be a trait of the Leiothrix genus and it would be
interesting to find out what plants a re used in the wild, how often and why.
All Leiothrix are devoted bathers and a dish was kept below a dripping
tap for them. Baths varied from a quick dip in freezing weather to several
on a hot summer&apos;s day. About the only depature from lutea behaviour
noted was that the Mesias spent a relatively greater amount of time
(although still not much) picking over the ground. They are not ground-

scratchers, although prey is often held down with the foot when taken to
a branch.
As an experiment, a pair of young birds was left in with the old pair
over the winter. They were all quite amicable until spring, when the two
cocks began a singing competition. Eventually the old male backed down
and became almost totally silent. There were frequent outbreaks of
chasing but only two serious tussles between the males, with the
respective hens chattering encouragement. Tension remained high when
eventually, at 10 months of age, the young pair nested. While they were
incubating the old pair also laid but were too nervous to sit. The following
day the young pair ( or probably the cock) threw the rival&apos;s eggs out and
pecked holes in them. At this stage the highly nervous old pair were put
in another aviary where they immediately raised a family. As soon as they
were separated, both cocks recommenced their singing duels. Three
generations of birds were raised in three successive summers.

found on the Aru Islands. This bird, like other subspecies of Pheasant
Pigeon, differs from the other members of the family Columbidae. The
relatively short wings combined with a greatly reduced furcula make these
birds weak fliers. Other differences include the presence of a row of well
defined rectangular scutes down each side of the posterior half of the
strong tarsi, twenty-two tail feathers (more than any other columbid) and
a modification of the coracoid arteries (Glenny and Amadon 1955). These
birds have long legs and a slender neck. The breast and underparts are
glossy blackish-purple. The wing coverts and secondaries are chestnut.
The bill is bright red and the legs are yellow suffused with black. Unlike

the Green-naped Pheasant Pigeon, Otidiphaps nobilis nobilis, the White -
naped lacks the short nuchal crest (Goodwin 1983). The tail is black with
a greenish gloss and tends to be longer in the male than in the female. As
its name implies, a white patch is found on the nape and hind neck. The
Pheasant Pigeon feeds and lives on the forest floor (Mayr and Rand 1937).
These birds are roughly 45cm (18 in) in length. When walking, the folded,
tentlike tail is pumped up and down (Beehler, Pratt &amp; Zimmerman 1986).
Several facilities have bred the nominate form, the Green-naped
Pheasant Pigeon, in captivity (Black 1930, Hall 1987, Kuehler 1989).
Evidence of captive propagation of the White-naped Pheasant Pigeon
prior to the hatching at the Cincinnati Zoo seems to be nonexistent. The
Cincinnati Zoo acquired two pairs of wild caught White-naped Pheasant
Pigeons in February 1987. All four birds were housed in enclosures with
average dimensions of 1.8 m x 1.8 m x 2 m high (5 ft. 10 in x 5 ft. 10 in
x 6 ft.). The display cage utilized sets of skylights augmented with
artificial lighting, while the off exhibit enclosure was entirely lit artifi-
cially. The diet of premixed pigeon seed, diced fruit, hard-boiled egg with
a mix of soaked dog chow, peanut butter and cottage cheese was offered
throughout the day. Only the dry seed was available ad lib. Vitamin
supplements in the form of Nekton-S and Nekton-Bio were added to the
fruit.
Egg production from both females began in 1988. The eggs were laid
overnight only to be destroyed on the arrival of the Aviculture staff and
the turning on of the display's lights. In January 1989 one pair of pigeons
was transferred to the Butterfly Aviary in the Insect World. This
&amp;quot;greenhouse&amp;quot; aviary measures 6.2 m x 16.9 m x 6.2 m high (20 ft. x 52 ft.
x 20 ft.) at the apex. The principle function of this enclosure is for the
display of butterflies. Other species of birds are also housed there
including Rufous-tailed Hummingbirds and Purple-collared Woodstars.
Supplemental lighting was installed for these nectar eating birds to allow
them sixteen hours of daylight, throughout the year, in which to feed.
On 26th March 1989 an egg was found and removed. The egg was
placed under a pair of Homing Pigeons which were to be used as surrogate
parents for the incubation process and initial rearing of the squab. This
technique had been used successfully here in the rearing of Nicobar
Pigeons, Caloenas nicobarica. When it was two days old the squab was
rejected by the foster parents and transferred to an incubator. The squab
weighed 19 g and was started ona diet of 4 parts chicken baby food, 2 parts
Hi-pro cereal, 2 parts water and 1 part apple pulp. The squab lived for
twelve days when it died from an infection. Two other eggs were
subsequently artificially incubated and the squabs hand reared. Hand-
rearing protocols set up by San Diego Zoo (Kuehler, 1989) which had been

successful with Green-naped Pheasant Pigeons and with otherpigeons and
doves were used for the two squabs. Both died from separate causes;
vitaminEdeficiency and infection. Withourlackofhand-rearingsuccess,
other eggs were left with the adults for them to incubate and rear the young
but after each successful hatching the squab was found dead within a few
days.
On 18th December 1989 an egg was discovered on a well planted ledge
running along the public walkway. The ledge was 2 m. high and 45 cm
wide (6 ft. 6 in x 1 ft. 6 in). The egg hatched on 14th January 1990 and
the squab was later found to be a male by chromosome sexing. On the
hatching of the squab the display was closed to the public and the small
bird flourished.

Further observations of the pair were made as other eggs were laid and
squabs cared for. Displays were best seen in the morning hours. One bird,
presumably the male, was often observed perched above the female.
There he would coo, a call that could be heard well outside the building,
until he flew down towards the female. A pursuit would then commence
with what could be best described as a trot. While following the female
the male's head and tail would oscillate vigorously. One dramatic display
occurred three days before the production of an egg. A low resonating
call, was noted from the pair and the birds clasped beaks and &amp;quot;bobbed"
their heads up and down. The pair then separated leaving the female to
stoop down on the ground. The male then walked closely around the
female. While completing his circuit he turned slightly to the side and

vibrated the outstretched wing closest to his crouched partner. The
circling bird&apos;s posture remained dominate while his tail pumped up and
down at an accelerated rate (Creamer &amp; Filbrun, 1991). Nestbuilding
commenced approximately one week before the single egg was laid. A
small scrape loosely lined with small twigs made up the nest. The eggs
were glossy white with a mea n measurement of 4.4 cm long and 3.1 c. wide
(1 Va x 1 Va). Incubation of the egg lasted for approximately 26 days. When
the nest site was disturbed a guttural roar, which was surprisingly loud,
would accompany the normal pigeon-like wing beatings. The squabs left
the nest at roughly 30 days of age when they would find a secure area under
foliage. All young birds were removed when they were 42 days old in
order to prevent their being injured and to allow further breeding by the
adults. To combat vitamin E and calcium deficiencies found in develop-
ing offspring, Nekton-E and Nekton-MSA were added to the normal
regimen of supplements placed in the fruit mix.
With secure, well-planted, undisturbed accommodation, an artifi-
cially controlled photoperiod and closely monitored vitamin intake, the
White-naped Pheasant Pigeon has bred successfully at the Cincinnati Zoo.
At the time of writing, the last four eggs and subsequent squabs have been
taken care of to the time of fledging by the adult pair. Future success with
additional pairs held here and in other aviaries may help to ensure the
population in captivity.

On a recent field-trip to south-east Asia I had the opportunity to visit
the Jurong Birdpark in Singapore. The economic dynamism which
characterises this Asian city is nowhere more obvious than at Jurong.
Massive private capital investment, to co-incide with the twentieth
anniversary, has been directed not just into the infrastructure to service the
visitors (like the spectacular monorail public transportation system which
will be 1.7 Km long when finished), but also into expansive, intelligently
designed aviaries reflecting species-specific requirements. Half an hour
from the city centre, in twenty hectares studded with lush tropical
vegetation, the park houses more than 4,500 birds representing 420
species from all around the world. Jurong also employs a full-time
horticulturist to exploit the full possibilities of the natural environment
and climate and several endemic species of honeyeater are attracted to the
nectar bearing blooms maintained in the park and some species of wild
wetlandbirds, like the White-breasted Waterhen, live off the vegetation on
the artificial lakes. This intelligent use of natural advantages in encour-
aging wild birds to entertain the visitor conceals the fact that few of the
smaller species, typical of the tropical Asian forest, are on show in the
park. The aviaries, both individual and multiple-species, are organised
into twenty four core units highlighting habitat usage, behavioural con-
gruence or family relationships. Unfortunately, because of renovations
for the anniversary celebrations, the enormous two hectare walk-in aviary,
with an artificial thirty foot waterfall, was closed during my visit, but
promises to be the largest and most elaborate in the world. For the less
athletic, the entire park can be traversed in comfort using the Tram Tour.
This one mile journey covers the major attractions with frequent stopping
points and a running commentary reminiscent of Disney World. My
preference, despite the exhausting heat and humidity, was to make the
longer walking tour which enabled me to view everything at my own pace.
There is a strong accent on visitor participation and inter-action
throughout the park and not just for the children, although they are
especially catered for: this includes direct contact with various species in
the many daily bird shows and at the restaurants, at the special photo-
graphic points or through one of the fixed audio-visual exhibits. Despite
the information booth in the park, the giftshop and postcard rack in the
Administration building and the usual, timewarped, miniature notice

outside each cage for the species on display, the depth of species
information is quite inadequate to satisfy the modern curious visitor and
compares poorly with the total financial investment and the general
quality of the presentation. Something on the line of Chester Zoo&apos;s &amp;quot;Zoo
Labels&amp;quot; would add that extra polish as well as fill the educational void.
As in almost every bird park the world over, one of the most colourful,
and popular, groups in Jurong is the &amp;quot;Parrot Parade&amp;quot;, containing a varied
selection of Cockatoos, Macaws and other, smaller parrots, focusing on
those endemic to the Australasian region, but covering all the continents.
I was particularly pleased not to see any parrot hybrids, which are
becoming a regular feature in many European birdparks. Although only
the male was on view to the public at that moment, the park has a breeding
pair of the seriously endangered Hyacinth Macaws among it&apos;s South
American parrots and has regularly produced offspring. Success with
breeding parrots has made Jurong famous throughout Asia and Australa-
sia, and their expertise is often utilised by other zoos and birdparks to
support their local breeding programmes.
The nearby World of Darkness, with suitably darkened habitats,
contains seven types of owls - including Ketupa zeylonensis and Ketupa
ketupu - alongside the more unusual nocturnal Brown Kiwi (also a
breeding success story), Tawny Frogmouth and one lonely Bush Curlew.
On the other side of the main entrance building several species of
penguins, including Humboldt, Little, and King occupy an enclosure with
a swimming pool separated from the public by viewing glass so that the
movements of the birds can be followed above and below water. The
Humboldt Penguins have been breeding successfully here since 1976 and
at the appropriate time the mating rituals and territorial displays can be
seen by the visitor.
For most ornithologists, Jurong has something of special interest to
offer, whether it is the birds of the wetlands, birds of prey or Birds of
Paradise. Although by no means the world&apos;s largest, the selection is
impressive and the habitat reconstruction successful, mainly because the
concentration is on Asian, or neo-tropical, species. The Argus Pheasant,
Malay Crested Fireback, Brahminy Kite, White-bellied Sea Eagle or the
strange Roulroul are all at home here. Broadbills, Woodpeckers, Pittas,
Crowned Pigeons, Bulbuls, Mynahs, Shamas, Magpie Robins and glitter-
ing Sunbirds all waylay the visitor with their beauty and charm. Numerous
species of cranes and flamingos, tree-ducks and pelicans, swans and
plovers inhabit large artificial lakes created especially for them and seem
very happy, but my personal &amp;quot;Oscars&amp;quot; went to the Hombill and Ratite
displays. Both groups are the most comprehensive that I have ever seen
anywhere.

The seventeen Hombill species, of which the only African representa -
tives are the Red-billed Hornbill and Southern Ground Hornbill, with their
high, roomy cages, are certainly among the most extensive and well
housed in the world. Although improvements in the foliage density of the
upper canopy remain one of the curator&apos;s objectives, the present situation
in no way detracts from the splendid cages and their fascinating inhabit-
ants which include the very rare Helmeted Hornbill, the Black Hombill,
the Tarictic Hombill, the Great Hornbill and an unusual chance to see three
sub-species of the Rhinoceros Hornbill at close range.
Ratites, birds with a flat breastbone which are often flightless, are my
speciality, and the reason for my visit to the area, so I was particularly
pleased to find Jurong has most of the world&apos;s larger species. In no other
zoo, as far as I am aware, anywhere in the world, is it possible to see an
Ostrich, an Emu, a Double-wattled Cassowary, a Dwarf Cassowary, a
Single-wattled Cassowary, a Greater Rhea and a Lesser Rhea in neigh-
bouring pens for easy identification and comparison. Unfortunately,
although the three cassowary species had been given plenty of shady,
green foliage to imitate their forest habitat, I felt a bit sorry for the
grassland birds which had, understandably, grazed their pens, despite
being generously sized, into dust.
Singapore has been become known as the &amp;quot;Bird Market of the world&amp;quot;,
and most rare species can be obtained if the price is right. The city,
occupying a very favourable geographical position, receives birds from all
of the neighbouring countries, and many further afield, even though much
of the trade is forbidden under the Washington Convention (CITES) and
the national laws. Ken de la Motte, the Consultant Curator in Jurong,
informed me that the Birdpark has increasingly assumed a conservationist
role in south-east Asia and has rescued many rare species from unscrupu-
lous dealers who have little concern for the well being of the birds.
Recently, the New Zealand authorities intercepted a large smuggled
quantity of fertile parrot eggs from America and passed them on to Jurong
for successful incubation. I saw about forty very young fledglings,
ranging from macaws to amazons, being hand fed. The principle, that
birds bred in captivity reduce the economic pressure for the capture of wild
birds, has inspired Jurong. The breeding of rare species, to exchange with
other zoos, has become a speciajity of the Birdpark and they devote a lot
of time and effort into achieving their very considerable successes.

BREEDING THE RED-SPOTTED LORIKEET

The Red-spotted or, as it is sometimes called, Red-marked Lorikeet
Charmosyna rubronotata rubronotata is a member of that most delightful
of all Lory and Lorikeet genera, Charmosyna. If more Aviculturists who
keep Lories and Lorikeets knew of the very special charm of these little
birds they would surely make strenuous efforts to obtain them.
In their native areas, which include the islands of Salawati and Biak,
Irian Jaya New Guinea and North Western Papua New Guinea, these
beautiful little birds are sparsely distributed in forest land up to 900 m,
tending to be more scarce in lowland areas. In their habitat they have to
contend for food with the Red-flanked Lorikeet, C.placentis and the Fairy
Lorikeet, C. pulchella. Red-spotted Lorikeets have usually been seen in
small flocks feeding in the higher branches of flowering trees which
include Coconut Palms growing in coastal areas. When searching for food
they fly swiftly above the tall trees on which they feed. Like other
members of the Charmosyna genus their food consists of nectar, pollen,
blossoms and possibly soft fruits. In their native haunts they are consid-
ered to be quiet birds but in a domesticated situation they have a tiny but
charming little warble.
The male of the nominate race may be described as follows. The nape
of the neck, mantle and back are dark green, the wings very dark green.
The crown and forehead are very bright red and the cheeks are light green.
The ear patch is not as extensive as that of the Red -flanked Lorikeet but
nevertheless is a most attractive feature of the bird, being a deep purple.
The pretty &amp;quot;apple&amp;quot; green of the breast is suffused with yellow at the sides
and the brilliant red high up on either side of the breast is an extension of
the under wing colour. The tail is dark green above and yellow below and
some of the tail feathers are prettily marked with yellow and have a red
base. There is a fairly dark red band running across the rump and blending
into the under wing red which makes the bird look very attractive in flight.
The large eyes are orange, the beak is red and the legs are a rather washed
out red. Some cocks are said to exhibit yellow in the under wing feathers.
The female of these sexually dimorphic birds is a most elegant little
beauty. The forehead, crown, nape, and mantle are all dark green, as also
are the wings and back. The breast is light &amp;quot;apple&amp;quot; green with a
pronounced golden yellow suffusion at the sides of the breast. The cheeks
are a very bright light green and the ear patches are light green streaked

with gold. The tail is dark green above and yellow below. There is a dull
red patch on the rump. The eyes are orange, the beak red and the legs a
dull rather light red. The weight of these birds is probably about three
quarters of an ounce and the total length is about 6 Vi in. (approx. 16 cm).
There is a sub-species , C. r, kordona which is apparently found only
on the island of Biak. In this race the male has a larger area of red on the
crown which is paler in colour and the ear patch is blue instead of purple.
The hen is similar to the female of the nominate race. In the case of the
nominate race it is possible to sex the young in the nest, the cocks showing
red on their heads as the feathers appear. The purple ear patch comes much
later, long after they have left the nest.
Early in the summer of 1990 an opportunity occurred to obtain a pair
of the nominate race from Shirley Lawton's collection. They appeared to
be quite young and were in superb condition. My husband Freddie and I
have a small indoor birdroom in our home which is lighted by Tru-lite for
about 15 hours daily and ordinary warm light for a further 2-3 hours. The
temperature is maintained throughout the year at a steady 74 0 F. This very
small room faces south and so there is plenty of natural sunlight. Plants
are grown on the window-shelf to increase humidity and to make the
surroundings attractive for the birds and for ourselves. We put the new
arrivals into an aviary-cage facing southeast and measuring approxi-
mately 5 ft. x 2 % ft. x 3 ft. high (1.5 m. x 76 cm x 92 cm). Soon after their
introduction to the room we added a nest box 5 Vi in x 5 Vi in x 8 in deep (14
cm x 14 cm x 20 cm). This was to prove a disaster. What we did not know
at that time was that these birds, even when just roosting in their box,
regularly drench it so that it really is necessary to have a bigger box for
ease of cleaning and removing the wood shavings which comprise the
nesting material.
Early in January 1991 the pair went to nest and two eggs were laid, one
was clear, one fertile, but the chick died before hatching. The hen was at
that time still very nervous and until she finally left the nest it was not
possible to look inside. Itwaslikeabog. The duties of incubating the eggs
had been shared between the pair, the cock sitting during the day, the hen
at night, and as soon as either of us entered the room the hen would dive
into the nest. With this experience gained we took out the small nest box
and replaced it with a larger one 7 Vi in x 7 Vi in x 12 in deep (19 cm x 19
cm x 30 cm) with a flat roof which we find a 11 birds appreciate because they
can sit on the top of the box with ease. About 4 in (10 cm) of soft wood
shavings were put in the box and the birds took to this larger nesting site
immediately. The larger size made it much easier to keep clean. On 24th
February 1991 two eggs were seen in the box and this time the birds were
sufficiently confident to allow me to clean out the box which they seemed

to appreciate very much. One chick hatched on 16th March and by the 20th
two chicks were doing well. They had probably taken 21 days to hatch.
On and after the 21st March the nest was cleaned out daily and the soiled
wood shavings were replaced with new warm shavings which had been
well rubbed to prevent any sharp ''spikes" from injuring the really tiny
chicks. Both birds were model parents sharing brooding, feeding etc. at
a 11 times. By this time the cock had become very confident and was almost
tame. At four and five days of age the tiny babies stretched and flapped
their wings in pleasure at the process of cleaning and being placed on dry
warm wood shavings. They were fat and well fed and about the size of a
Bee.
The food the parents were given is prepared as follows: cooked brown
rice and bananas are liquidised, two tablespoons of rice to two medium
sized peeled bananas in enough water to make a liquid mix. Peeled carrots
are liquidised in a similar way. Sweet apples are also liquidised in a little
water. To make one pint : one tablespoon of rice and banana mix, one
tablespoon of apple mix, one teaspoon (after five days) of carrot mix, one
half level teaspoon (after five days) of ground soya bean flour (from Health
food shops). To this is added half a level tablespoon of Muscavado
medium brown sugar, half a level tablespoon of glucose, one level
teaspoon of Australian honey (no other honey is used) and one tablespoon
of a fruit based baby food which does not contain coconut (which is too
indigestible for tiny babies) and is not based on citrus fruit for we have
found that anything containing orange, lemon or grapefruit is not suitable
for baby " Charmosynas &amp;quot; To the above mixture we add either one teaspoon
of condensed milk, or the same quantity of Vita Food, which is a skimmed
milk based product of Boots pic. This is an excellent addition for all Lories
and Lorikeets which contains many vitamins, minerals, 21% protein and
only 3 Vi % lactose. All the above are mixed first with cold then hot water
to make up the whole volume to one pint. Into each small feed cup is put
a piece of plain sponge cake about the size of two sugar cubes and the
slightly warm mixture is then added.
Normally the birds are fed twice per day, using clean cups each time,
but when feeding young the little cup may need &amp;quot;topping up&amp;quot; on several
occasions, and it must be remembered that in thundery weather this food
may go sour quite quickly. The 25 watt warm light goes on at 6 am., the
Tru-lite at 7.30 am. and this remains on all day until 11 pm., when the warm
light goes on for about one hour. It is quite usual to hear the babies being
fed at 12 midnight and at 3 or 4 am. A dry food mixture consisting of one
part ground rice, two parts fruit based baby food, one part glucose, half
a part of bran and a quarter part of granulated sugar is always available in
a small bowl on the floor of the aviary next to a bowl of water. This is

hardly ever touched but on one occasion when a minor accident prevented
me from feeding the birds their nectar at the usual time the clever little
parents switched to the dry food to feed their babies.
Both chicks of this second nest proved to be cocks. They left the nest
together on the 7th May 1991, seven weeks after hatching, and three days
later they were seen feeding from the nectar cup. They were strong flyers
and good escapers! About the 20th May the hen appeared rather &amp;quot;puffed
up&amp;quot; and disappeared for some time, on the 23rd May one of the young
cocks was seen pecking his devoted little mother and so both were
removed to another aviary-cage of similar size to that occupied by their
parents. A nest box of similar size had been fitted and supplied with wood
shavings. The young cocks made themselves at home immediately,
feeding from the nectar supplied, eating bits of flowers, green food and
playing on the small twigs and branches of apple supplied. They even
copied their parents and had a bath in the rather flat bowl of water
provided. They went to roost in the nest box the very first night. As soon
as the young cocks were removed I looked into the parent&apos;s nest box and
found one rather battered looking egg. The box was cleaned out and new
wood shavings were provided. Nothing more happened for some time
although the hen spent some period of each day in the nest. Early in June
I looked into the box again and found three eggs. These were candled. The
original one was clear and the other two were fertile. On the 18th June one
chick hatched, followed on the 20th by the second.
The parent birds had now come to expect a daily cleaning of the nest
when chicks were in residence. This is always a nerve racking experience
when the babies concerned are just hatched and about Va in. in length. In
the early stages both parents remain at the other end of the aviary, but as
the chicks grow the cock comes progressively closer during the process of
cleaning, until he is on the outside perch of the nest box looking in and
making &amp;quot;stabs&amp;quot; at my hand! Nevertheless the process is well tolerated by
the parents who always give a lift of the wing to show their appreciation
of this care bestowed upon their young. It is indeed an essential task for
without this daily cleaning and removal of soaked wood shavings the box
would be so wet that it is doubtful if the young would survive for long.
It is interesting that, at times when some of the nesting material was
not removed and renewed, such as when egg laying was taking place, the
cock could be heard vainly trying to gnaw the wood of the box. He did,
in fact, succeed in making a little heap of chips at one time when the box
had become really sodden and the birds had endeavoured to move their
eggs into one comer near this little pile. Perhaps in the wild state in
cavities of trees it is relatively easy for the birds to chip away porous wood
to soak up the moisture.

These Lorikeets are always supplied daily with a tiny quantity of
greenfood, usually endive, and whatever harmless flowers are in season.
These include heather and indoor fuchsias in the winter, forget-me-nots
and wallflowers in the Springand roses, wild honeysuckle (not the flowers
of evergreen honeysuckle which is a poisonous plant), impatiens (Busy
Lizzies),outdoor fuchsias, white alyssum, pansies and BegoniaSemperflores
(the small bedding begonia which is a great favourite with all Lorikeets)
at other times of the year. It should be noted that the beautiful sweet
scented Daphne Mezereum is a poisonous plant and that every part of the
Rhododendron flower is poisonous. Honey coming from an area where
these shrubs grow in abundance should be avoided. I find Australian
honey the best for small birds.
Like most Lorikeets Red-spotted enjoy small twigs and little branches
of hazel nut and apple with the leaves removed and the buds left in place.
They will eat these and also the bark with great pleasure. Our two young
cocks have a small branch of either of the above at least once per week.
One end of their little aviary now looks like a little &amp;quot;jungle&amp;quot; and they
enormously enjoy climbing and playing amongst the twigs and branches.

It may be noticed that the quantity of soya bean flour I include in the
food is tiny. This very excellent substance is very high in protein, about
38 to 40 % of the whole flour. Birds need protein to breed, grow etc., but
only in very limited amounts. Probably somewhere around 15 to 16 % of
the whole of their food. Too much protein may produce eggs etc. but the
end result will be damaged kidneys and liver leading possibly to the bird's

death. I have noticed that members of the Charmosyna genus are
particularly sensitive to soya and Stella&apos;s particularly produce heavy, thick
and pasty excreta when given too much soya. The tell tale over-rounded
look below the vent (as if there were an egg about to be laid), seen in both
cocks and hens, is a sign of an &amp;quot;overloaded&amp;quot; liver. It is a sign to be ignored
at the owner&apos;s peril. If it occurs it is advisable to reduce the viscosity of
the nectar by adding a little more liquidised apple and to stop the soya.
Owing to the fact that these birds are only in the care of a limited
number of Aviculturists in different parts of the world, breeding successes
are few and far between, and probably not always recorded. Rosemary
Low states in Parrots, their Care and Breeding that in 1981 Helmut Michi
in West Germany bred two chicks but they died at 16 and 17 days of age.
I can find no records of these birds having been kept and bred in the USA.
In 1990 Andrew Blythe and Johnathan Powell bred three C. rubronotata
and I understand that Roger Bulloss bred one bird in the same year. My
husband&apos;s and my breeding results are: two completely independent cocks
hatched in March 1991 and two strong chicks three weeks old at the time
of writing, which is July 1991. All the above are parent reared birds. It
is very much to be hoped that any other breedings that have taken place,
or which occur in the future will be reported.
In conclusion, I consider that once they are thoroughly established and
used to their home the Red-spotted is one of the most charming of all tiny
Lorikeets. Their little aviary-cage remains surprisingly clean, they keep
their feathers immaculate and always gleaming and they are the most
attentive and tolerant parents imaginable. Clearly they are suitable only
for indoor heated quarters but they make a most delightful addition to any
collection of small Lorikeets and their obvious willingness to reproduce
their kind recommends them to all Aviculturists keeping the more delicate
members of the Loriinae.

NOTES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL
ORNITHOLOGICAL CONGRESS
CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND
By Roger Wilkinson

(Curator of Birds, Chester Zoo.)
The 20th International Ornithological Congress held at Christchurch,
New Zealand, from 2nd - 9th December 1990 was a mammoth meeting
attended by some 1200 delegates from around the world. The programme
and abstracts alone were presented as a 550 page volume and the
proceedings are yet to follow in a further three volumes. The meeting was
extremely useful.
It was impossible to attend all the sessions as up to ten were run
concurrently. Obviously captive breeding and conservation took priority
for me but when these were not running I was able to attend sessions on
co-operative breeding, mate-choice etc., which also had relevance to
captive propagation. The plenary lectures were most stimulating. One on
gas exehange in embryos at high altitudes was directly relevant to the
problems we have had in artificially incubating Kea eggs. Enrique
Boucher gave a plenary lecture on applied ornithology which particularly
addressed the problem of the export of Blue-fronted Amazons from
Argentina. John Craig&apos;s plenary on communal breeding across the
changing face of theory was not only challenging but immensely enter-
taining. John Croxall gave his plenary on ecological and physiological
constraints on reproduction in Albatrosses - a title which did not do justice
to its content. The Japanese Blue Fin Tuna industry is currently threaten-
ing Albatrosses with extinction. An estimated four and a half million
Albatrosses become the victims of the long-line Tuna industry each year
and the reduced survival rate of juveniles and adults has resulted in an
overall decline in Albatross populations over the last fifteen years.
Charles Sibley presented his revised avian taxonomy based on DNA
hybridization studies. Ratites were shown to be monophyletic; Toucans
to be advanced Barbets, Vireos (but not Starlings) to be related to Crows
and New Zealand Wrens to be different from everything else in the world!
I attended three round-tables. One on avian disease was particularly
concerned with the impact that disease could have for reintroduction
programmes. The second on species level taxonomy promised to be of
interest with regard to current problems Zoos are having in coping with
subspecies. In the event it did not really help our decision making other
than noting that the US constitution notes the importance of conservation

of endangered species, subspecies (and populations?). The numberof taxa
needing help is ever-widened and the recent Red Data Book policy of
considering only species (and not sub-species which a future taxonomic
revision could upgrade to species level) may be too narrow. The newly
favoured phylogenetic species concept may gradually replace the biologi-
cal species concept. If that happens we can expect a large number of taxa
previously ranked as subspecies to be elevated to specific level.
The third round table on captive breeding was specifically convened
to consider its role in the conservation of New Zealand birds. A brief
introduction established that captive breeding of Takahe began in 1959
and was divided between two facilities: Burwood Bush close to the release
area and Mt. Bruce National Wildlife Centre. Sophisticated techniques
included the use of a fibreglass Takahe model complete with heat-pad and
loudspeaker. One-way glass rearing booths and puppets were also used.
The use of puppets was challenged by Ellen Thaler (Curator of Birds at
Alpen Zoo) who preferred birds to be hand-reared but kept in visual
contact with a tamed member of their own species. Discussion indicated
this method had been successful with Choughs, New Zealand Falcons and
Pukeko. However, under stressed conditions birds reared in contact with
humans may seek human habitation, e.g. bustards in Saudi Arabia showed
no tameness when released but under conditions of drought or food
shortage returned to human areas looking for food. Black Stilts were the
next bird to be discussed. Experiments with the reintroduction of hand-
reared Black Stilts and those fostered under Pied Stilts had little success.
Black Stilts were now being parent-reared at Twizel in large natural
enclosures in the wild range of the species.
One representative argued strongly against captive breeding suggest-
ing that instead all effort should be concentrated on in situ conservation.
He then went on to praise the New Zealand transfer and cross-fostering
management techniques as infinitely preferable to caging birds. This
emotive argument was ably countered by Don Merton replying that in fact
small islands were very like large aviaries and his techniques very similar
to those of captive breeding. I also had my say again arguing for the
integration of captive breeding with conservation in the wild. Environ-
mentalists should not be afraid of the success of captive breeding diverting
people from the goal of preserving species in the wild, captive breeding
being a step to the same end.
Discussion followed for and against the argument of captive breeding
as an insurance policy for the over 1,000 bird species now considered
threatened. Other techniques considered included behavioural manipula-
tion of the endangered species; for example training Peregrines to nest on
city blocks, and training Saddlebacks to use elevated rat-proof roosting

boxes. An argument was made that Blue Ducks could be trained to
frequent areas of still water thus giving them a larger range of habitats. The
response was that this change would be counterproductive as the Blue
Duck was specifically a bird of mountain streams. The counter argument
that in historical times Blue Ducks may have occupied more general
habitats echoed an argument in an earlier session that we may be wrong
in assuming that what birds are doing now is optimal; e.g. Takahe in alpine
New Zealand are considered now to be occupying a sub-optimal habitat
as are Ne-ne in the upland areas of Hawaii.
A captive breeding symposium preceding the round table included
papers on the prospects and problems of reintroducing captive bred birds
with examples from, Whooping Cranes, Guam Rails, Condors and
Shorebirds. Other related papers were scattered through many different
symposia. I will briefly review some of the most relevant of those I
attended.
Scott Derrickson, Curator of Birds at the National Zoo, Smithsonian,
USA, considered the problems of reintroduction. He argued for the use
of manipulative techniques by Conservation managers on wild populations
to avoid having to use captive breeding as a last ditch solution. However,
he stressed that for some species long term propagation ex-situ may be the
only hope for future survival. Contrary to every other report I have read
he argued that for 544 different releases considered there was no signifi-
cant difference between the success of hard or soft release techniques. The
strategy for establishing a captive population was to a) Secure a large
founder population, b) Expand quickly to carrying capacity, c) Minimize
inbreeding, d) Equalize founder representation, e) Maintain stable age
distribution, and f) Avoid artificial selection.
Various examples were discussed including Lord Howe Island
Woodhen, Thick-billed Parrots, Whooping Cranes, and Hawaiian Geese.
The Californian Condor project was estimated to be costing US $500,000
a year, and the Puerto Rican Parrot Project was also very expensive. Of
thirteen captive-bred microchipped Bali Mynahs recently released into
the wild, one had already turned up in Jakarta bird market! Unless capture
for the pet trade can be stopped this project cannot be viable.
David Ellis reviewed the history of Whooping Crane captive-breeding
and reintroduction in the USA. Cross fostering of Whooping Cranes to
Sandhill Cranes at Gregs Lake has now been phased out and considered
to have been unsuccessful. Problems included mal-imprinting, powerline
strikes and avian tuberculosis. The main problem was of sexual imprint-
ing to the foster Sandhills. Of thirteen birds presently in the flock it is not
expected that any will ever reproduce successfully. Now it is intended that
juvenile captive-bred Whooping Cranes should be reintroduced instead of

cross-fostering. However, an experiment with Sandhill Cranes resulted in
total failure as pre-release conditions had not been correctly defined.
Parent-reared cranes were found to be the best for release.
Susan Haig reported on her computer simulation to consider the best
genetic options for choosing which Guam Rails to use for an introduction
to snake-free Rota island (Guam is no longer suitable because of Brown
Tree Snakes). David Bird read M.P. Wallace&apos;s paper on the Californian
Condor programme. Interesting points were that copulation is socially
facilitated - one pair mating in vision of a second pair leads to copying and
that the programme is going better than expected; the Andean Condor
surrogates adapting well to the release programme. A change in strategy
is that the Andean Condors (all females) will be left in the wild for an
overlap period to research the Californian foraging sites etc.
In a different session, Christine Reed reported on problems resulting
from cross-fostering Black Stilts; cross-fostered Stilts tended to migrate
with the Pied Stilts rather than remaining in the Mackenzie basin with the
sedentary Black Stilts. Black Stilts are now critically endangered with
interbreeding between them and Pied Stilts and only 80 remain.
John Innes reported how the main threat to the New Zealand avifauna
had come from introduced species. The Kakapo situation is well known
but I was surprised to find the Kaka now declining on the mainland with
only one nest found to be successful on South Island in the last six years.
(That I found a pair south of Lewis Pass thus pleased me greatly!) Other
declining species included Kakariki, Yellow-heads and Kokako. Control
of competition by poisoning was discussed with respect to Possums which
defoliate native forests.
John Craig once again challenged current theory arguing that the
1980&apos;s genetic theories for population management were not appropriate
for New Zealand birds. In particular the Population Viability Analysis
(P.V.A.) assumptions that a) Selection is less important than drift, b)
Inbreeding of more than 1 - 3% is deleterious and c) Animals mate
randomly as applied to New Zealand birds is contrary to experience. Craig
considered that many small populations rather than one large one were
better genetically and stochastically. He argued for a minimum of three
populations each with a minimum of ten pairs rather than the single
population of500 birds as being argued for by P.V.A. theorists. Craig also
advocated minimal management with no inter-island transfers, and no
attempts to equalize founder contributions as these would impede local
adaptation.
Important points that came up in discussion were that in Red-billed
Gulls there is no correlation between good breeders in one generation and
those in the next generation. Thus there is no justification for selecting

good breeders as founders. Secondly out-breeding depression may occur
if founders are selected from different populations. Thus it may not be
wise to pair together birds originating from different areas.
Roger W ilkinson
Takahe at Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre, New Zealand.
In a symposium on disease ecology and the conservation of avian
species we learned that viruses are expected to become a greater problem
in the face of global warming. It was argued that most wild birds no longer
live in a natural environment and that some intervention may be needed
which should be targeted on the host, agent, or environment. For example
scaring waterfowl away from sites where cholera has been identified.
Milton Friend emphasized the need for the results of autopsies to be
databased. Problems of disease and re introduction were highlighted by
the transfer of avian tuberculosis to free-flying Whooping Cranes. Other
concerns were neoplasia in Sandhill Cranes, and Avian Pox and Malaria
in Hawaiian birds. Avian botulism was seen as a disease of disturbed and
managed wetlands. In captive populations herpes virus was particularly
worrying having been responsible for many crane deaths. Eastern equine
encephalitis was now causing concern by also causing the death of captive
cranes.
A separate symposium was devoted to pain and stress in birds. Alan
Feduccia&apos;s paper on skeletal pathology of birds in Zoos was based on his
research on post-mortem material. Feduccia used this as a vehicle for

&amp;quot;Zoo-bashing". He argued that birds in Zoos were subject to a great deal
of pain and suffering especially ratites which suffer pathological lesions
and chronic osteoarthritis. Rather than arguing a case for improved
keeping conditions with larger areas for exercise he used this to argue that
Ratites should not be kept in captivity. Clearly stress in captive birds is
a problem and that was why I attended that session. Other papers indicated
how stress affects birds and its main causes. Handling and transport were
the most significant causes of stress. Other important stressors that led to
disease problems included surgery, temperature, pathogens, noise, social
interactions, and feeding restrictions. For chickens the strongest stressor
was the human presence. Machine caught birds were less stressed than
those caught by people. I do not advocate our using machines but handling
should clearly be minimized. That creates problems as we need to handle
birds for management purposes including worming and the checking of
identification rings or other markings.
Whilst in New Zealand I took the opportunity to visit the excellent
Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre. Concurrently managed by he
Department of Conservation the National Wildlife Centre evolved from
the Mount Bruce Native Bird Reserve. It began when the Internal Affairs
Department bought up the land and aviaries belonging to Elwin Welch, a
farmer and aviculturist who worked with Takahe from 1948. Mount Bruce
now breeds and exhibit a large number of native species including Ta kahe,
Blue Duck, Kokako, Saddlebacks and Kiwi. As always smaller aviaries
of earlier years remained as a testimony to how our criteria for cage design
has advanced faster than the financial abilities to rebuild aviaries. The
newer aviaries are excellent; extremely spacious and worthy of their
endangered occupants. The nocturnal house was especially good with
extremely large spacious well planted natural areas for the Kiwis. Mount
Bruce is open to the public and set in a remnant of native forest which is
home to many wild native birds including my personal favourite the Tui.
New Zealand is indeed fortunate in having dedicated people with far-
sighted attitudes which enable them to devise strategies to conserve their
fascinating but sadly depleted avifauna and to remain very much at the
cutting edge of bird conservation. I applaud their work and especially wish
them success with that most marvellous of parrots, the Kakapo.

On Sunday 2nd June 1991 over one hundred members and their guests
gathered at Chestnut Lodge, Cobham, Surrey, at the kind invitation of
Miss Ruth Ezra and Raymond Sawyer (President and Vice-President
respectively of the Avicultural Society). The weather was colder than
usual with no sunshine but, fortunately, it did not rain.
As always this world famous collection had some interesting new
arrivals. A pair of Little Bee-Eaters were most striking, as were a single
Carmine Bee-Eater and three Blue-faced Honey eaters. A single Golden-
headed Quetzal refused to come outside, preferring to sit eyeing us from
its stone-built shelter. Perhaps my favourite new arrivals were a pair of
Laminated Hill Toucans with their wonderful coloured bills. Old favour-
ites were still present and included what must be the only male Scarlet
Cock-of-the-Rock in the country. It is 15 years since it first came to
Cobham. The Toco Toucans looked magnificent, as did a pair of Racket-
tailed Rollers, the two cock Purple-throated Fruit Crows, the Grey-backed
Trumpeters, Royal Starlings, Golden-heart Doves, Pygmy Geese, Roul-
roul Partridges and the waders, which included Avocets, Black-winged
Stilts and Crocodile Birds. Amongst the parrots were Scarlet and Blue-
and-Gold Macaws, Keas, Philippine Hanging Parrots, Red-flanked
Lorikeets and, a new arrival, a Hyacinthine Macaw. Crowned and
Demoiselle Cranes, Flamingos and a varied collection of waterfowl were
at liberty in the grounds as usual. There is still a large selection of
tortoises, including the Giant. The gardens are a delight and add much
to the enjoyment of the occasion.
Tea was provided on the lawn and our hosts were thanked for their
generous hospitality which included the #406 raised through the ticket
sales and which they donated to the Society&apos;s funds. At tea, presentation
of first-breeding medals were made to Jeffrey Trollope for the Blue-
and-White Flycatcherand to Mr. and Mrs. Freddie Cooke forthe Wallace&apos;s

The Amethyst Starling Cinnyricinclus leucogaster comes from Africa.
Its range is from Kenya in the east to Senegal in the west with a subspecies
C.l.verreauxi covering Kenya to Natal and west to Angola. It is often
called the Violet-backed Starling in field guides. The bird is about 7&amp;quot;
(177mm) long and pairs are visually sexable which is unusual in members
of the Starling family. The adult male is a metallic violet plum colour
above with a white belly and lower breast. The female has tawny brown
upperparts, and dark-streaked white underparts. My two youngsters are
similar to their mother but lighter in colour with gape markings still
showing (November 1990).
The Amethyst Starling has long been known in aviculture, with the first
breeding occurring in 1935 when Maurice Amsler was awarded the
Society's medal (Avicultural Magazine November 1935 Fourth Series
Vol.XIII 11: 295-300.) W. D. Cummings describes the breeding which
took place in 1958 at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm (Avicultural
Magazine , March/April 1959,65,2:44-46.) The Cotswold Wildlife Park
at Burford, Oxfordshire, and Harewood House, Near Leeds, bred them
duringthe mid-1970s as is recorded inthe Avicultural Society&apos;s Breeding
Register. None have been recorded by the Foreign Bird Federation since
it started its breeding register in 1984. Colour plates are to be found in the
August 1908 and April 1921 issues of the Avicultural Magazine.
My first &apos;pair&apos; of Amethyst Starlings was obtained in October 1970 but
they were two cocks for I was not aware, at the time, of the marked sexual
dimorphism which this species exhibits.
I acquired a pair on the 8th March 1979 at a time when they had become
scarce in the United Kingdom. The cock died on 21st March but a
replacement was obtained on the 22nd April. I am certain that my birds
are West African, probably from Senegal, as a lovely colour plate by H.
Gronwold showing both these two birds appears in Bannerman&apos;s Birds of
Tropical West Africa Volume 6.
The pair has occupied three different aviaries but since 1982 they have
been in the same enclosure the flight of which is built on an old rockery.
The flight is 14 ft long x 7 1/2 ft wide x 7 ft high (4.5 m long x 2.42m wide
x 2.25m high). It faces south and is fairly well exposed. A shed running
along the back provides shelter from bad weather and is also used for
feeding. At this end is a sheet of P VC, 2*A ft (0.8m)wide, on the aviary roof

and down the western side, and the far end is sheltered against strong
winds. There is a hawthorn tree in the centre which is cut back each
autumn as is a Russian vine which grows on the eastern side by the
footpath, and provides cover in the breeding season. In 1990 the aviary
housed &apos;pairs&apos; of Amethyst Starling, Southern Tit Babblers, Yellow-
collared Ixulus, Red-tailed Sivas, and Grosbeak Starlings and a cock
Philippine Hanging Parrot.
During the previous two winters all the birds with the exception of the
Babblers remained outside but before then the birds had been brought in
from this aviary. The Amethyst Starlings had shown no real signs of
breeding. Various shaped nestboxes had been put up and although some
inspection had taken place, nothing had happened. This species, like its
near relative the Emerald Starling, loves to pick off small leaves to carry
around the flight.
In the spring of 1990 the cock bird chased the hen a little as he always
did and displayed with a quiet call. He fanned out his wings and tail, but
it seemed that the hen was not interested. A nestbox hung inside at an
angle of 20* was chosen for her nest, (unknown to me). It contained wood
shavings and rotten wood and was 15&amp;quot; x 9&amp;quot; x 5 1 /2&amp;quot;(38cm x 23cm x 13.75cm)
There is a 2&amp;quot; (5cm) diameter hole at one end and a door at the other which
can be used for inspection purposes. The nestbox, upon a full inspection
when the young had left, revealed quite a few dead leaves but little else
had been taken to the box. I did not know that the hen was sitting. Both
birds were always inthe flightduringthe summer although early June was
cooler than other periods the previous year when, in Somerset, tempera-
tures of over 90*F were recorded. Perhaps I should have realised that a
part of a blue egg shell was not from the Grosbeak Starlings,which had
nested occasionally for some time, usually throwing out their eggs or even
laying them straight onto the aviary floor. The pair of Red-tailed Sivas had
also nested and on Friday 22 June at 5.30 p.m. I saw a young bird, but by
9.00 p.m. it was missing. I found it the next day. It must have been two days
old at the most.The weather was by now very hot and on Wednesday 27th
June in the morning at 7.20 a.m. I saw the hen Amethyst Starling with two
mealworms in her beak, being chased by the cock. During the day my
father saw this as well. Again, it happened when I gave them the usual
mealworms on my returning home from work. I went into the flight,
looked into the nestbox and saw two youngsters but no sign of any eggs.
The chicks were several days old. On the 28th June it rained in the
afternoon and was not so hot. The supply of mealworms dusted with SA37
was increased and the birds were given waxmoth larvae. On Thursday
5th July I examined the nest again with a torch and all looked well with
the chicks appearing as if they could leave the nest any day. I decided to

put a wire frame in the doorway of the shelter for three parts of its height
in the hope that it would keep the youngsters inside for the first few days.
Both birds were seen out of the nest at 1.15 p.m. on Saturday 7th July. On
Sunday, the 8th, one bird was in the flight all day, the second was unable
to fly very well but in the evening it had ventured outside . I could see it
so I caught it and put it back inside the shelter. It spent all day on Monday
9th July inside, coming out to roost at night. This time I could not see it
and it spent its first night outside. On Tuesday 10th July I could see both
young birds in the flight all day and they roosted as near to the aviary roof
as possible.
They were similar to their mother but the brown was lighter and their
yellow gape markings were obvious for several months after. They were
fed by their parents for as long as four weeks after leaving the nest but I
believe this was partly because they were very lazy. They would call for
food and their parents duly obliged.
Ants eggs and ants were available in the long hot summer of 1990 and
they were taken. The Red-tailed Sivas in particular enjoyed this treat. The
food available at all times was Orlux insectivorous food, bananas, grapes,
apples, pears and oranges, some cut up and others spiked, mealworms and
a nectar mixture made from honey and beef extract, brown sugar, Abidec
drops, Milupa, glucose and Complan. The Amethyst Starlings took some
of each. Other fruits wereofferedinseason.lt is said that these birds take
dung into their nests. Accordingly horse manure and cow dung was put
into the aviary each year. None was taken into the nest but it attracts plenty
of live food which the smaller Babblers love to catch.

Chester Zoo has always maintained an interesting Parrot collection
and in reviewing 1990 I would like to start by considering some of our
experiences with the larger parrots.
Our Lilacine Amazons amazona autumnalis lilacina are wild caught
birds presented by Customs and Excise to Chester in 1982. They had never
shown any sign of being interested in each other let alone in breeding and
so we decided that perhaps the time had come to admit our lack of success
with this species and replace them with Green-cheeked Amazons Amazona
viridigenalis. Consequently, in order to make up unrelated pairs, we
imported two young Green-cheeks from Rotterdam Zoo and purchased a
second sibling pair from Janet Fletcher, a private aviculturist who had
considerable success with this species. The Lilacines then surprised us by
laying eggs for the first time and thus securing their future with us.
Although no chicks hatched this was very promising as was the first
nesting of a pair of our Hawk-head Parrots Deroptyus accipitrinus. The
Hawk-heads got one stage further than the Lilacines in actually hatching
a chick although this died when it was a few days old. Our Leadbeaters
Cockatoos Cacatua leadbeateri laid but incubated unsuccessfully their
first clutch of eggs. We decided to remove the second clutch and these
were taken as they were laid and removed for artificial incubation. Both
eggs hatched and two chicks were hand-reared as were a Kea Nestor
notabilis and a Blue-eyed Cockatoo Cacatua ophthalmica. A second
Blue-eyed Cockatoo was reared by its parents; this was especially
gratifying in that this was the first time this particular pair had attempted
to breed. The male parent was a captive-bred bird hatched at Clee Hill
Birds Gardens in 1979 and the female parent had been hatched at Chester
in 1983.
The Keas have been laying eggs for a number of years but failing to
hatch any chicks. Hence their eggs were taken for artificial incubation.
The eggs of high altitude Parrots such as Keas react differently from those
of other Parrot species and a particular problem is getting them to lose
sufficient water during incubation. In order to achieve the desired weight
loss the eggs must be weighed at regular intervals and the humidity of the
incubator adjusted accordingly. In order to hatch the eggs the incubator
had to be run dry and silica gel employed to achieve the desired water loss.

Red-fronted Macaw bred at Chester Zoo in 1990.
Although when necessary we hand-rear parrots our ultimate aim is for
the birds to rear their own youngsters. Our greatest successes this year
were with the Red-fronted Macaws Ara rubrogenys which bred for the
first time at Chester rearing a single youngster from their second clutch
and with the Greater Vasa Parrots Coracopsis vasa which reared two
chicks as previously first reported in this magazine. The Lesser Vasa
Parrots Coracopsis nigra first bred in 1985 and these were again
successful in rearinga brood of four chicks. The Blue and Yellow Macaws

Ara ararauna again reared two superb youngsters.
Other psittacine species bred included Lesser Patagonian Conures
Cyanoliseus patagonus\ Slender-billed Parrakeets Enicognathus lepto-
rhynchus, Yellow-backed Chattering Lorys Lorius garrulus flavopallia-
tus, Musk Lorikeets Glossopsitta concinna, Musschenbroeks Lorikeets
Neopsittacus musschenbroekii, Derbyan Parrakeets Psittacula derbiana
and Splendid Parrakeets Neophema splendida. New to the collection were
Scarlet Macaws Ara macao and a pair of Blue-throated Conures Pyrrhura
cruentata; the latter being an endangered species from the remnant
Atlantic forests of Brazil.
Another group of birds with which we had particular success in 1990
was the pheasants. Sixteen Himalayan Monals Lophophorus impeyanus,
thirteen Brown-eared Pheasant ;Crossoptilon mantchuricum and two
Satyr Tragopans Tragopan satyr a were reared in addition to a number of
commoner species. The rearing of Grey Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron
bicalcaratum was of some interest in that one of the chicks was hatched
and reared by an unpaired female. This bird had laid and was incubating
its own infertile eggs at the time our breeding pair laid their first clutch.
Her infertile eggs were then replaced by the fertile eggs from the pair and
she proved a model parent. The breeding pair then went on to rear two
chicks from a subsequent clutch. New to the collection were a pair of
Temminck&apos;s Tragopans Tragopan teminckil. The Variable Chachalacas
Ortalis motmot reared a fine chick in 1990 but no Bare-faced Curassows
Crax fasciolata were bred.
Crowned Plovers Vanellus coronatus, Blacksmiths Plovers Vanellus
armatus, Superb Spreo Starlings Spreo superbus and Coleto Mynahs
Sarcops calvus again reared chicks and the Kookaburras Dacelo no -
vaeguinae had another successful year fledging six chicks.
Trumpeter Hornbills Bycanistes bucinator reared two chicks for the
second year running and the Wrinkled Hornbills Acer os corrugatus nested
for the first time but the female emerged alone without any indication of
hatching success. Two Bar-tailed Cuckoo Doves Macropygia unchall,
were reared. Two pairs of Pink Pigeons Nesoenas mayeri laid and two
chicks were hatched after fostering their eggs to Java Doves Streptopelia
risoria and Domestic Pigeons Columba livia . The Java Doves reared one
chick to four weeks old but sadly that bird died before it reached
independence. Rothschilds Mynah Leucopsar rothschildi also had a
shaky year but one chick taken from the nest at a few days old was
successfully hand-reared.
Our greatest success with an endangered species was the rearing of
seven Waldrapp Ibis Geronticus eremita. Three chicks were hand-reared
and four others resulted from supplementary feeding of the chicks under

their parents. The lack of breeding in 1990 of our flamingos was put down
to the necessary disturbance because of major work required to complete
the new flamingo shed and the extensive new enclosure around the Lemur
Island. The Chilean Flamingos Phoenicopterus chilensis now occupy this
new area leaving the Caribbean Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber ruber to
occupy the older area. We hope it will not be too many years before the
birds settle down in their new situations.
We were also particularly gratified when the Channel-billed Toucans
Ramphastos vitellinus repeated last years success in again fledging two
youngsters. In 1989 the eggs of the Co!lared Aracaris Pteroglossus
torquatus proved infertile and despite exchanging our male for a new bird
again this year the eggs were infertile. New to the collection is a pair of
Toco Toucans Ramphastos toco and recently on display, also for the first
time insome years, a Sparkling VioletearHummingbird Colibricoruscans.
Many species nested in the free-flight and the aviaries of the Tropical
House. We were especially pleased to rear four Mountain Witch Doves
Geotrygon versicolor. White-headed Buffalo Weavers Dinemellia
dinemelli and Golden-Palm Weavers Ploceusbojeri again fledged young.
The Plumbeous Redstarts Rhyacornis fuliginosus, share their enclosure
with the-Congo Peafowl Afropavo congensis. The Redstarts nested and
one chick was reared to independence but sadly died later in the year.
Birds nesting in the free-flight area included White-rumped Shamas
Copsychus malabaricus, Fairy Bluebirds Irena puella (one of which was
hand-reared) and Java Sparrows Padda oryzivora. Emerald Starlings
Lamprocolius iris hatched chicks but disappointingly failed to rear them.
A major new development nearing completion in the Tropical House is the
conversion of the old Gorilla inside enclosures to two massive new
aviaries. These are currently being landscaped and will be planted to
simulate a rain forest environment. One of these aviaries will house our
Great Indian Hombills Buceros bicornis and the other our Rhinoceros
Hombills Buceros rhinoceros.
Other recent developments on bird enclosures include the netting over
of one of the crane paddocks and the building of two large new Snowy Owl
enclosures. Two telegraph poles were erected inside the Crane paddock
from which was fitted a specially tailored section of trawler netting to
reach down to the top of the chain-link sides of the enclosure like a tent.
Our initial reason for roofing this area was that we received a full-winged
female Red-crowned Crane Grusjaponensis from Baraboo, Wisconsin, in
exchange for one of the two brothers originating from Rotterdam. We
preferred not to pinion this adult bird and hope that this enclosure may be
a model for future areas for cranes and storks.
The new Red-crowned Crane female has settled in well with the

Rotterdam male and they are presently displaying. The White-naped
Cranes Grus vipio laid for the first time last year and one of the second
clutch eggs proved fertile but died during development.
Two Sams Cranes Grus antigone were hatched. One was reared by
a bantam but the chick left with its parents failed despite their experience
in successfully rearing a chick in 1989. Most significant of all was the
hatching of two chicks from eggs laid by one of our pairs of West African
Crowned Cranes Balearicapavonina pavonina. This species is particu-
larly difficult to propagate in that when they can be persuaded to breed
they tend to lay in the late summer; that is in the same months as they would
be laying in West Africa towards the end of their rainy season. The two
chicks hatched under a bantam on 25th September but had to be separated
because of the aggression of one towards the other. The chick left with
the bantam was found dead shortly afterwards. The remaining chick was
then reunited with the foster. That chick really was a survivor and despite
the trauma of a green stick fracture is now well grown and still with its
foster mother. The Demoiselle Cranes Anthropoides virgo laid but again
the eggs were infertile. Two White Storks Ciconia ciconia were reared by
their parents and these together with one of the chicks that we bred in 1989
have since been sent to Bristol Zoo.
A male Andean Condor Vultur gi yphus was incubator hatched and
puppet-reared, and is destined for Antwerp Zoo. Since 1985 we have
reared a total of eight chicks. The previous year&apos;s young female Condor
has now joined Moscow Zoo. We also had a good year with owls; our most
important success being that both pairs of Spectacled Owl Pulsatrix
perspicillata reared a youngster. Three Great Horned Owls Bubo virgin-
ianus and a Snowy Owl Nyctea scandiaca were hand-reared and three
further Snowy Owls, two European Eagle Owls Bubo bubo and seventeen
Bam Owls Tyto alba were parent-reared. As previously the Barn Owl
chicks were taken by Carol Hackney for the Keele University monitored
release programme. Carol tells me that zoo-bred Bam Owls released in
Cheshire and Staffordshire in 1989 are still being reported from their
release areas and that there is a strong probability that one pair of zoo-bred
owls, released in Staffordshire in 1988, successfully reared chicks in 1990.
The two female White-faced Scops Owls Otus leucotis received from
London Zoo in 1989 have now been joined by an unrelated Belgian-bred
male. During the year a male Milky Eagle Owl Bubo lacteus was received
on loan from Rotterdam Zoo. A generous gift from an anonymous
benefactor allowed us to build two new very spacious aviaries for our
Snowy Owls. These have been landscaped to represent a tundra habitat
the owls have quickly taken to these and seem well settled in their new
homes.

Waterfowl are well represented at Chester and 1990 additions include
Smew Mergus albellus, Garganey Anas querquedula, Eider Somateria
mollissima and Lesser White-fronted Gees tAnser erythropus. Breeding
this year included amongst the endangered species eight White-winged
Wood Ducks Cairina scutulata , ten Hawaiian Geese Branta sandvicensis
and four Ruddy-headed Geese Chloephaga rubidiceps. We have two pairs
of White-winged Wood Ducks on loan from the Wildfowl and Wetlands
Trust and the youngsters have been consigned to them for distribution to
other collections. We receive many birds from Jersey Wildlife Preserva-
tion Trust and it was therefore a pleasure to be able to send them a second
pair of Ruddy-headed Geese together with half a dozen Mandarin Ducks
Aix galericulata. Other waterfowl bred this year included White-faced
Whistling Ducks Dendrocygna viduata, Fulvous Tree Ducks Dendro-
cygna bicolor, Common Shelduck Tadorna tadorna, Marbled Teal Anas
angustirostris, Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula, Red-crested Pochard Netta
rufina, Carolina Wood Duck Aix sponsa and Maned Geese Chenonetta
jubata.
We had a poor year with our Humboldts Penguins Spheniscus hum-
boldti with only three chicks hatched. Hopefully this reflected changes
in the demography of our group with older previously successful birds
being lost from the group whilst we still await younger birds to mature to
replace them. However, other Zoos have recently had major problems
with their penguins and we are keeping a watchful eye over the situation.
Finally to end where I often start; that is right at the beginning of the
taxonomic sequence with ratites and their relatives. Our ChileanTinamous
Nothoproctaperdicaria continued to breed and their nearest relatives, the
Rheas Rhea americana reared three chicks. We received two male Red-
necked Ostriches Struthio camelus masaicus from Fota Wildlife Park, the
second to replace one that failed to establish itself at Chester. We expect
to receive soon a female Red-necked Ostrich from Cotswold Wildlife
Park. The Emus Dromaius novaehollandiae gave an excellent Easter
exhibition with their five newly-hatched chicks but despite previous
requests for chicks these again proved difficult to place. As such we shall
not permit the Emus to hatch any chicks this year. I only wish we have
similar problems in requiring some of the more difficult species not to
breed!

The Third International Parrot Convention will be held in Puerto De
La Cruz from Thursday, 15th September to Sunday, 28th September 1994
and will be sponsored and organized once again by Loro Parque. In Loro
Parque&apos;s 24th Newsletter, dated August 1991, Tony Silva lists some of this
year&apos;s successful breedings of rare species of parrot. These include Pretre&apos;s
Yellow-shouldered and Yellow-faced Amazon Parrots, the Fiery-shoul-
dered Conure, the Red-quilled Lory, Purple-bellied and Great-billed
Parrots and Illiger&apos;s and Caninde Macaws.
The pair of Guilding&apos;s Amazon Parrot at Paradise Park, Hayle, has
produced a chick which has been hand-reared successfully. Other species
which have bred at the Park this year include Buffon&apos;s Macaw, Leadbeat-
er&apos;s, Goffin&apos;s, Umbrella and Roseate Cockatoos, Crowned and Mauritius
Pink Pigeons, the Yellow-fronted Woodpecker, the Red-breasted Goose
and Crowned and Wattled Cranes.

The &amp;quot;West Australian&amp;quot; published this short article entitled &amp;quot;Rare parrot
eggs hatched&amp;quot; on 18th July 1991. &amp;quot;WELLINGTON: Two Australian
cockatoos a re among 26 rare parrot chicks hatched in a Singapore bird park
where smuggled eggs were sent after being discovered in New Zealand last
month. The New Zealand Conservation Department flew 38 eggs and
eight chicks to the Jurong Bird Park on 28th June after quarantine
regulations threatened their destruction. Customs officials found 52 eggs
on two women arriving in Auckland from Los Angeles. Spokesman Jim
Kidson said that of the eggs and chicks flown to Singapore 26 hatched,
three eggs were still viable, nine died before hatching and three chicks
died. He said the bird park had reported that of the 26 hatchings there were
seven macaws, eight conures and four Amazon parrots, all from South
America, three African Grey Parrots from Central Africa, two Australian

The World Pheasant Association will make an International Census of
Gallinaceous Species held in captivity on 31st December 1991. The
primary objective is to assist in the future maintenance of viable captive
stocks of endangered species. Members who keep gallinaceous birds in
their collection are urged to help. Census forms may be obtained from
Diane Hewitt, WPA census Co-ordinator, Windy Hall, Crook Road,
Windermere, Cumbria, England.
Our Council Member Alan Griffiths, who is a veterinary surgeon,
writes about a virulent type of avian malaria, affecting particularly
Australian parrakeets, which is becoming increasingly common.
"1 am very interested in the problem created by Protozoan blood
parasites because during the past six or seven years many people,
including myself, in this area of Wales (Dyfed) have been losing young
parrakeets eight to twelve weeks after their leaving the nest. At first the
birds are strong flyers but after a while they mostly run, or hop, along the
floor. If alarmed when perching they will drop to the ground because of
the loss of the power of flight. These symptoms continue, getting
progressively worse for perhaps a week until the birds die. Other birds
simply die suddenly and not all of the birds from the same nest may be
affected. Many of the birds appeared to be in reasonable condition but the
post mortem examinations revealed haemorrhages in the heart muscle and
gizzard and the pericardium was found to be full of blood. Histological
examination of the heart muscle, gizzard and breast muscles showed a
severe infestation with the schizonts (a stage in the life cycle) of a
Leucocytozoon.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Leucocytozoa are members of a group of blood inhabiting protozoa
(i.e. the lowest form of animal life). Protozoa are found in soil, surface
water, vegetation and the intestinal tracts of man and animals. However,
Leucocytozoa are known to occur only in birds, so far as I know, with the
exception of the Teiid Lizards in Brazil. Birds of many species have been
found to be infected but the parasite is particularly host specific, i.e. one
that kills ducks, for example, will not kill turkeys but may kill geese.
&amp;quot;As the mortality from this disease can be very high (a mortality of 35%
has been reported in ducks and 70% in goslings at the Seney Wildlife

Refuge in the USA) it is important that we should reduce it. As usual,
prevention is better than cure. It is known that the transmission of the
disease from carrier to recipient is by the bite of a fly known as the Blackfly
which belongs to the Simulidae family. These flies lay their eggs on stones
or plants, just below the surface of water in fast flowing streams which are
well oxygenated. So do not blame your garden pond for being a potential
breeding site for the flies if you have been having trouble. The larvae hatch
from the eggs in four to twelve days and can fly quite long distances.
Incidentally, the larvae of the flies cannot be killed in the water by
chemicals without killing most other animal life in the water. The disease
cannot be transmitted by the injection of blood from an infected to a
healthy bird, as the life cycle is dependant on its passage through the
carrier insect viz., the Blackfly.
&amp;quot;Some aviculturists in this area who have had problems in the past, in
the 1990 breeding season covered their aviaries with fine nylon(Mosquito)
netting until mid-day, and then replaced it again in the evening as the flies
are more active in the early morning and evening. &amp;quot;Blue" electric fly traps
were also placed in front of the aviaries, and the entrance holes to the nest
boxes were painted with a Vapona fly pen (which is apparently non-toxic
to birds) and Vapona strips were hung in place under the nest box,
inaccessible to the birds. These measures seem to have been reasonably
successful in reducing mortality.
&amp;quot;Mr. Vic Simpson considers that the disease in this country is limited
to Antipodea n species of parrot only, and I have certainly not seen it in any
Asiatic or South American species in the same range of aviaries. I have,
however, come across a reference to this disease as being the cause of the
decline of the Tahiti Blue Lory in the wild. I should be interested to know
whether other people have had similar problems and what measures they
have adopted to control the disease.
&amp;quot;I should like to express my appreciation and thanks to Mr. David
Harwood, and Mr. David Thomas of the Carmarthen V.I. Centre for
carrying out the Post Mortems, and to Mr. Vic Simpson of the Truro V.I.
Centre for his interest.&amp;quot;
Dulcie Cooke has repeated her successful breeding of the Red-flanked
Lorikeet and writes &amp;quot;It may be of interest to owners of Red-flanked
Lorikeets Charmosyna placentis, that as mentioned in my article in the
Avicultural Magazine 1991,97,1:3-8, the parent hen laid a further two
eggs. These hatched in due course and were admirably and devotedly
reared by the parents. They have proved to be two handsome little cocks.

At the time of writing (early August 1991) one is totally tame and steps
on to my finger whenever it is proffered. The other younger one is
extremely lively, not particularly tame and flies all over the aviary. They
hatched on the 7th and 8th June 1991. On 7th July the older of the two by
one day was showing red cheek patches which the younger bird took rather
longer to develop. Both now have enormous purple ear patches sparsely
streaked with gold. The purple-blue rump is clearly defined. The young
birds left the nest within hours of each other when they were 6 Vz weeks
old. The older and larger of the two fed himself from the nectar cup within
four days and the smaller and younger one took about six days to learn to
feed himself. From the first day out of the nest they returned to the nest
box at night. As far as 1 could ascertain the parents fed the young cocks
at night for a least one week after they had left the nest. During rearing
they were quite the noisiest chicks I have ever encountered! At present
the parents are extremely proud of their efforts and totally tolerant of their
fine young sons.&amp;quot;
She also writes &amp;quot;The homing instinct of birds is always a cause for
wonder and interest, especially when it is exhibited in a species not usually
associated with this ability and even more unusual perhaps when it occurs
in a very young bird. Such was the case in the summer of 1991. A
remarkable case of &amp;quot;homing&amp;quot; by a very young Ornate Lorikeet Trichoglos-
sus ornatus was reported to the writer. Two very young birds, believed to
be a cock and a hen were established in a small aviary forming part of a
number of similar enclosures. One morning the cock escaped and flew up
and down in the vicinity of the garden where the aviaries were situated.
After a short time something must have frightened him and he flew off into
the distance. The owner searched the area and spoke to as many residents
as possible but no-one had seen the bird. By nightfall there was still so sign
of it, nor was it seen or heard the following morning. The owner had to
leave for work and it was not until the afternoon that his small son reported
to his mother that &amp;quot;there is a parrot on the outside of one of the aviaries&amp;quot;.
The wife very wisely approached cautiously with a catching net hidden as
much as possible. She found a very exhausted young cock clinging to the
wires of &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; aviary with the hen trying to comfort him from the inside.
He was so tired that it was possible to place the net over him and return
him to the aviary without difficulty. He had been outside his aviary for

Society) recently received his doctorate at Glasgow University for his
thesis on The Feeding Ecology of the Red-billed Chough Pyrrhoccrax
pyrrhocorax L. in West Wales, and the Feasibility of Re-establishment
in Cornwall, Avicultural Magazine 1991,97,2: 51-58. Dr. Meyer&apos;s
research shows that the three former haunts of the Chough which he
studied in Cornwall appear to be richer in its invertebrate prey, beetles and
their larvae, ants and fly larvae, etc., than comparable sites in West Wales
where the Chough continues to thrive. Richard considers three areas of
Cornwall are suitable for re-establishment. These are north Cornwall,
west Penwith and the Lizard. He favours the last.
According to a report in Bird Watching Magazine, 66: 87, London is
set to have a new Waterfowl and Wetland Trust wildlife sanctuary. The
Trust and Thames Water have planning permission for a 110 acre wildfowl
reserve at Bam Elms reservoirs, about four miles from central London.
However, the Trust has announced the imminent closure of the Peakirk
Wildlife Gardens. Following strong protests, the Trust began discussions
with Peterborough City Council, which would like Peakirk to survive but
willliot take direct responsibility for the centre.
From Dave Coles
Formed just over eighteen months ago, the World Parrot Trust is
already contributing significantly towards parrot conservation. Through
its membership and fund-raising activities, the Trust has raised over
#80,000 and is thus able to support a range of conservation projects, the
largest of which is the purchase of a &amp;quot;conservation bus&amp;quot; for St. Lucia. This
project is outlined in Psitta Scene the Trust&apos;s excellent quarterly maga-
zine, along with items covering the reintroduction of Military Macaws in
Guatemala and the recovery of the Orange-bellied Parrakeet. Details of
the Trust and its work can be had from WPT, Glanmor House, Hayle,

The third annual meeting of the Blue Duck Captive Breeding Group
took place at the National Breeding Centre, Mt. Bruce, New Zealand on
4th May 1991. The purpose was to discuss the 1990/91 breeding season
which had seen an increase in the captive population to 25.17. A total of
6.3 had been reared in three collections. One adult death was recorded and
the introduction of two wild caught females will inject much needed new
blood into the population within New Zealand. If the 1991/92 season is
equally successful, initial releases will take place, probably within Mt.

Egmont National Park. Presumably, these figures omit the breeding
population held by the Wildfowl Trust.
A summary of the North Island Brown Kiwi studbook appears in issue
number eleven of the Kiwi House Review, the excellent magazine of
Otorohanga Zoological Society. The population at 31st December 1989
stood at 121 (55.38.28), a net gainof five over the previous year. Although
not a significant increase overall, it is important as the eleven birds which
died were mainly adults and the sixteen chicks which survived represents
one of the highest annually reared, both in individuals and institutions.
The preamble to the studbook gives an insight into some recently
discovered facts about Kiwi nesting habits in the wild.
The first European studbook for the Red-crowned Crane Grus japon-
ensis has just been completed. Compiled by Rob Belterman of Rotterdam
Zoo, the population status as at 31st December 1990 stands at 115.
Attempts are to be made to reintroduce the White-tailed Sea Eagle
back to Ireland after an absence of 90 years. The breeding nucleus,
originating from Switzerland, Holland and Germany, is to be housed in
breeding aviaries at the Fota Island Wildlife Park in County Cork. Young
birds will be released, under the auspices of the Irish Wildbird Conserv-
ancy, at various sites in the counties of Clare and Kerry. The cost of the
breeding venture is being covered by Eagle Star Insurance. A similar
introduction, rearing imported chicks for releasing has met with some
success in Scotland - eighty two were released over a period of years on
the island of Rhum and, although mortality is reported at around 50%,
pairs are now breeding with increasing success. Individuals perished by
gun and poison and it is probably the educating of the people most likely
to come into direct conflict with the eagles that will be the deciding factor
governing the ultimate success of the Irish venture. The coastline of
County Kerry is certainly a spectacular part of the British Isles and may
again be home to these enigmatic birds.
Attitudes change, but ever so slowly, even in the scientific fraternity,
as can be judged by the fate of the only known specimen of Bulo Burti
Boubou Shrik t Lanaris liberates. Discovered in 1988 by Eddie Smith in
the grounds of a hospital in the Bulo Burti district of central Somalia, it
survived becoming a museum specimen by virtue of being the only one of
its kind so far discovered. &amp;quot;Had it been more numerous&amp;quot; says Nigel Collar
of I.C.B.P. &amp;quot;in the interests of conservation, we would have said collect
one&amp;quot;. Equally, though, a species is said not to exist until scientifically

described. Thankfully, I.C.B.P. suggested catching the bird and taking
blood for DNA analysis. The bird was mist-netted and kept over a period
of six months in an aviary during which time it was photographed, video-
taped, tape-recorded and its behaviour studied. It was then released back
to the wild. DNA analysis confirmed it to be a new species. If this is the
first species to survive its baptism, as is stated in the August 1991 issue of
BBC Wildlife , just how many skins, one wonders, are there in the world&apos;s
museums of species discovered in the past decade or so!
The American Federation of Aviculture&apos;s journal, Watchbird contin-
ues to be one of the most interesting avicultural publications available.
Amongst subjects covered in the Dec/Jan. 1991 and Feb./Mar 1991 issues
are the breeding of the Java Mannikin, Chestnut-capped Ground Thrush,
Toco Toucan, Edward&apos;s Fig Parrot, Red-crested Cardinal, Hispaniolan
Conure, Tucuman Amazon and Goliath Herons. All are illustrated using
colour photographs.
The plans for the long term survival of the Takahe are beginning to
come to fruition, After years of careful management, research and captive
breeding the population of this, the world's largest rail, now stands at
around 200. It has been a policy of the New Zealand Wildlife Service to
introduce species to predator-free islands in the hope of increasing
numbers. The Takahe is no exception and is now present in small numbers
on four: Mana and Kapiti off the west Coast of the North Island just north
of Wellington, Maud in the Marlborough Sounds and Tiritiri Matangi, in
the Haura ki Gulf. Mana has been accorded the highest priority for the long
term survival of the species. It has also been successfully introduced to
a valley in Fiordland.

I.Z.N. was founded in 1951 to give the
world's zoos a regular medium for the
exchange of information, news and ideas.
With contributors in six continents, and
subscribers in more than 40 countries, it
is still the only specialist journal which
covers all aspects of the international zoo
scene. Every issue contains full-length
articles on animal management and
related topics (often including translations
from foreign publications), as well as numerous shorter news
items from zoos in Britain and overseas. Other regular features are
book reviews, conservation news, a free service for advertising
surplus and wanted stock, profiles of famous animal collections,
and reference lists of important articles in other zoo publications.

BREEDING THE ASHY STARLING AT CHESTER ZOO
By Roger Wilkinson (Curator of Birds)
and Wayne McLeod (Senior Keeper)
Ashy Starlings Cosmopsarus unicolor have a limited distribution in

East Africa which is virtually restricted to Tanzania but also just extending
to southern Kenya (Hall 1970, Howard &amp; Moore 1980). Further north and
east into Kenya the Ashy Starling is replaced by its better known relative
the Royal or Golden-breasted Starling Cosmopsarus regius. The Ashy
Starling, unlike its more colourful relative, has been imported infre-
quently and less is known of its behaviour in the wild or in captivity. Ashy
Starlings resemble Royal Starlings in their general build and proportions
but are of a brownish grey colour slightly glossed green only on the wings
and tail.
Chester Zoo received a pair of Ashy Starlings in August 1988 from
Paulton&apos;s Park where the birds were causing problems because of their
aggression in a mixed species exhibit. At Chester the Ashy Starlings were
established as sole occupants in one of the planted aviaries in the upstairs
gallery of the Tropical House. They were fed on our &amp;quot;softbill mixture" of
minced beef, rubbed with biscuit flour, grated hard-boiled egg, grated
carrot and commercial insectile food supplemented with a vitamin/
mineral additive. Additionally finely diced apple, chopped tomatoes and
grapes were given. A nest box measuring 15 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm high (6
in x 8 in x 12 in) with an entrance hole of 5 cm (2 in) diameter was provided
for this pair. Unlike many other starlings, no attempt was made to pack
the box with nest material. Instead the floor of the nest box was covered
with a layer of nest material in which a shallow cup was fashioned in one
corner of the box. When checked on 22nd March 1989 the nest contained
three eggs.
On the 29th March the parents were first seen to carry food into the nest
which when inspected on 1st April contained two chicks. The first of these
fledged on 24th April and the second two days later. Throughout the
nestling period both parents fed the chicks on the live food provided which
included mealworms, wax moth larvae, and early instar locusts.

A second nesting attempt was begun by the Ashy Starlings in late
September. By 29th September it was judged that the parents had
commenced incubation and when the box was inspected on 2nd October
a clutch of three eggs was found. The pa rents were first seen carrying food
to the nest on 13th October indicating an incubation period of around 14
days. The behaviour of the adults was as for the first brood until 19th
October when the male appeared lethargic and was removed for individual
hospitalization. The female continued to rear the chicks on her own and
on 4th November both chicks fledged. The nestling period of about 31
days for this second brood compared with 26 - 28 days for the first nesting
may reflect the fact that the workload of feeding the youngsters was for
the first brood shared by both parents.
Brown &amp; Britton (1980) list two records of nesting by Ashy Starlings
in East Africa; one in February, the other in March but gave no details of
these. Walters (1980) indicates that the nest and eggs of Ashy Starlings
are undescribed. For that reason a detailed description of the eggs is given
below.
The eggs were sub-elliptical, smooth and slightly glossy and at first
glance appeared to be of a uniform pale blue colour. The eggs of the
related Royal Starling are described as pale greenish blue minutely
speckled with reddish brown (Mackworth-Praed &amp; Grant, 1960). Closer
inspection of one of the Ashy Starling eggs revealed some slight staining
and several obscure pale small reddish brown blotches on the narrow end.
Less obviously the pale greenish blue colour also appeared to be marked
with uniform minute faint brownish speckles which were so tiny that they
could easily have been overlooked.
We are unaware of any other reports of the captive breeding of Ashy
Starlings and would welcome further observations on this or related
species in the wild or in captivity.

BREEDING JOSEPHINE'S LORIKEET
AT PALMITOS PARK

(Curator, Breeding Centre)
The rich avifauna of New Guinea includes numerous brightly
coloured small parrots. In contrast, those from the tropics of South
America, beautiful as they are, appear almost dull. One of the most
beautiful is surely Josephine&apos;s Lorikeet Charmosyna josefinae.
Briefly, it can be described as a smaller, shorter-tailed version of
Stella&apos;s Lorikeet, which is represented in aviculture by C. papou
goliathina. Josephine&apos;s differs from Stella&apos;s in having the upper
side of the tail red; in Stella&apos;s it is green. Josephine&apos;s has several
notable assets from the avicultural viewpoint, especially its beauty,
tameness and appealing personality. Adults are sexually dimor-
phic, have a fascinating courtship display, nest fairly readily and
mature early.
Josephine&apos;s is a small lory, with a body length of about 12 cm and
a total length, when adult, of about 24 cm. It has a graceful shape
as well as a beautiful colour scheme. Three sub-species are
recognised. I believe that sepikiana is the best know in aviculture.
In this race the area of blackish-green on the abdomen is larger and
the front of the black patch on the crown is streaked with grey or
bluish-grey. The streaking is said to be bluer in the nominate race
and absent or nearly so in cyclopum. The nominate race is said to
have the lower back red in the male and green in the female
(Forshaw, 1973). In the other two sub-species the female has the
lower back and sides of the flanks brilliant daffodil yellow.
In late 1988, while curator at Loro Parque, Tenerife, I obtained
three male Josephine's which had been bred there from one pair
during the previous thirteen months. I had no idea where I would
be able to obtain females as they are hard to acquire. This was the
first new species I had added to my own collection for three years.
There was little need for at that time I was working with over 200
species of parrots! Early the following year I moved to Gran
Canaria to look after the birds in the Breeding Centre of Palmitos
Park. A few months later the park&apos;s founder and owner, Mr. K.
Paulmann, imported three female and one male Josephine&apos;s from
Germany. Unfortunately, two of the females were not in good
health and one of these died. The third, however, paired with one

of the captive-bred males, has formed a successful breeding pair.
The lories are housed in an enclosed building to protect them
from the strong sun and winds of the mountain location. A section
of the roof above each row of cages is covered with green shade
cloth, thus giving the whole building an airy, sunny, outdoor feel.
Each pair of lories is housed in a suspended cage measuring 2 m
long, 76 cm wide and 1 m high (6 ft. 6 in x 2 ft. 6 in x 3 ft. 3 in).

Display and copulation
The behaviour of this species is very interesting to observe.
When excited they flick the head very quickly, sometimes also
waving the long tongue outside the beak. Without moving the feet,
they jerk the body from side to side, keeping the head low, almost
in line with the body. The display is as obvious in the female as in
the male. Mating is preceded by head bobbing in both sexes and,
as in all lories, is performed by the male with both feet on the
female&apos;s back.
Incubation
In February of the following year, 1990, the pair consisting of
1988 hatched male and the wild-caught female, nested. The female
laid on 4th and 6th or 7th February. In this species, and other
members of the genus, incubation is carried out by male and female.
Anton Spenkelink found that of his pairs the male incubates for the
first five to seven days, then male and female share incubation, then
after two weeks the female incubates. I shall keep notes in future
to see if a similar pattern emerges in our pairs, although often both
birds are in the nest together.
Eggs are usually laid at intervals of three days, sometimes two
days. The clutch always consists of two eggs. New laid eggs are,
of course, white like all parrot eggs, but after a few days the shell
acquires a few grey lines, something I have noticed only in the
closely related Stella&apos;s C. papou goliathina and Fairy C. pulchella
pulchella species. In Charmosyna lorikeets incubation does not
commence with the first egg and usually not with the second egg -
a strange facet of behaviour, However, this pair of Josephine&apos;s
starts to incubate before the second egg is laid because the young
hatch on consecutive days, whether the eggs are laid two days or
three days apart. This probably means that incubation commences
the day before the second egg is laid. So far one other pair (both
captive-hatched) has bred, producing two young, which also hatched
on consecutive days. In the instances where two chicks hatched
(both pairs), they hatched on the following number of days after the
eggs were laid: 27 and 25 or 26, 26 and 25, 27 and 25, 28 and 26 and
(captive-bred pair), 29 and 27. Thus the true incubation period
(calculated on the second egg) has varied from 25 to 27 days. Four
of these eggs were measured, two from each of two females. Those
of the original wild-caught bird measured 19.5 x 22.5 mm and 18.8
x 22.5 mm, and those of the other wild-caught female 19.8 x 25 mm
and 19.5 x 25.5 mm. In these two eggs, which were the female&apos;s
first , the embryos died at an early stage.

To revert to the result of the first clutch, the eggs hatched on 3rd
March (pipping commenced on 1st March) and 4th March. The
chicks were removed for hand-rearing on 20th March. As with all
subsequent chicks, they were closed-ringed with 5.5 mm rings
whey they were about 21 days old.

<bodyText confidence="0.999163628571429" page_id="56269651"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
All of the young have been well fed by their parents. The first
two were removed because the youngest chick had a swollen leg
from the age of about nine days. After a few days in the hand-
rearing room the swelling had gone and the leg was normal. In the
second nest, the second chick died at 10 days; the reason was
unknown. The other chick was immediately removed for hand-
rearing. In these two cases, the female laid again 31 and 19 days
after the young were removed. The eggs of the second nest had been
laid on 20th and 22nd April and hatched on 16th and 17th May. In
the third nest eggs were laid on 15th and 18th June and hatched on
12th and 13th July. Both young were reared by the parents. The
first left the nest on 28th August when it was 47 days old and the
second did not until 13th September when it was 62 days. The pair
did not nest again that year and their young were removed on 1st
October. Their first three clutches had produced six eggs and six
chicks, five of which were reared. Surprisingly four of them proved
to be females!
In 1991, the female laid on 28th and 31st March. The second egg
hatched on 27th April; the first egg was infertile. The chick was
removed for hand-rearing at 11 days. It felt cold, the weather was
not as warm as usual and the parents spent much of the time out of
the nest. Two chicks keep each other warm - but one is more
vulnerable to chilling. The chick was removed on 8th May but the
female did not lay again until 20th and 23rd June. These eggs
hatched on 18th and 19th July. The young were reared without
incident and left the nest on 18th September (after 62 and 61 days).
Meanwhile, the very first youngster, hatched on 3rd March 1990
and paired to a 1988 Loro Parque hatched male, was nesting. On
25th February before she was 52 weeks old, she laid her first egg,
and the second on 28th February. The nest was very wet and the
embryos died about two thirds of the way through the incubation
period. She laid the first egg of the second clutch on 22nd May and
the second egg probably on 25th May. They hatched on 20th and
21st June. The chicks were very well cared for by the parents and
left the nest on 19th August (60 and 59 days).

Immature plumage
It is interesting that although the young of the closely related
Fairy and Red-flanked Charmosyna placentis Lorikeets can be
sexed in nest feather those of Josephine's can not. The yellow
feathers on the lower back and rump of the females do not appear
for about four months and it is at least another two or three months
before full adult plumage is acquired. Only one of the young
(which is just independent at the time of writing) had yellow
feathers on the back in nest feather. However, Anton Spenkelink,
a most experienced breeder of this species, told me that this is no
indication of sex as males can have yellow feathers and lose them
in adult plumage. Immature plumage otherwise differs from that of
the adults only in the less well defined shaft streaking on the nape
and thighs. However, the beak is brown/orange (coral in adults),
the cere is whitish (instead of coral), the iris is brown (orange in
adults), the skin surrounding the eye is paler grey and the feet are
greyish-pink (pale coral in adults).

Diet
Food for this species at Palmitos Park consists mainly of nectar
(either Nekton-Lori, or a mixture of Milupa baby cereals and
honey, with vitamins and minerals added occasionally) and fruit;
each pair receives at least half an apple or half a pear daily, with
other fruits in season, especially cactus fruit, of which nearly all
lories are very fond. The Josephine&apos;s relish tinned sweet corn
kernels, and the young breeding pair like our home-made rearing
food which contains carrot, hard-boiled egg, non-fat cheese and
whole grain bread. Soaked dried figs and raw carrot are also eaten.
I have never tried the dry lory diets; it they would eat it, it could be
given as a small part of the diet; nectar should always be available,
given fresh twicedaily.
The hand-rearing food is varied; it contains Milupa baby cereal,
wheat germ cereal and Nekton-lori; to most food is added papaya
and a little of the rearing food described above. Liquid calcium or
the calcium and mineral supplement Nekton MSA is added once
daily.
Age at independence
Hand-reared young will start to feed themselves at an early age
if given the opportunity. I gave a small container of warm rearing
food to the first two when they were only five weeks old and they
fed themselves immediately - in fact, they took an excessive
amount. They each weighed 53 gms and I was giving them only 4
gms or 5 gms at a time, yet on the first day they filled their crops
with 13 gms of food! If there are two young I do not encourage this
early weaning because they spill food on each other&apos;s heads and
object greatly to their feathers being cleaned.
Parent-reared young leave the nest then they are about seven
weeks old and start to feed themselves on nectar almost immedi-
ately. However, I prefer to leave young lories with their parents for
four or five weeks, so that they can learn as much natural behaviour
as possible. Hand-reared young are as suitable as those which have
been reared by their parents for breeding provided that they are
reared with a sibling or introduced to their own species as soon as
they are independent.
Future in aviculture
Josephine&apos;s Lorikeet was unknown in aviculture until the late
1970s. Not many have been imported and it is not well established.
Perhaps only in Germany and the Netherlands are there a few
breeding pairs. I do not know of any in the UK because of the
shortage of females. Its future in aviculture does not seem assured.

and a European studbook would, if initiated, at least provide some
ideas of the numbers held. The problem would be that nearly all are
in private hands, not in zoos, and many private aviculturists are not
good at co-operating in this way.

Very little is known about this lorikeet in the wild. It occurs in
the mountains of western and central New Guinea. It has been
described as scarce and local but that may be due to lack of
observers or the species being difficult to see in foliage. Whatever
its status, aviculturists must do their best to ensure that this
exquisite lorikeet is maintained in our aviaries - preferably in
planted aviaries where the birds will live a more natural and active
life and their &amp;quot;owners&amp;quot; will derive even greater enjoyment from
their company.

PADSTOW TROPICAL BIRD GARDENS

(SI. Breock, Wadebridge, Cornwall)
Situated on the north Cornwall coast in south-west England, Padstow
could, and perhaps still can, be described as a quaint old Cornish fishing
port. Fishing continues though long ago it was overtaken in importance
by the holiday trade. The bird gardens are in a quiet largely residential part
of the town. Relatively small - approx, two acres (just under one hectare)
in extent - they are somewhat reminiscent of a smaller version of the late
Len Hill&apos;s Birdland at Bourton on the Water, Glos. The gardens are on
three levels. The main one has aviaries on four sides of a large lawn
(complete with gazebo), plus on one side the Tropical House and on
another a two-aviary conservatory-type structure. Steps lead up to the
terrace with aviaries on three sides of a small lawn, with to one side a
butterfly exhibition and the tea room (with good views out across the
estuary). The lower garden includes the waterfowl/flamingo enclosure,
wader/waterbird aviary and other aviaries.
There is a nice mix of birds in good sensible aviaries and enclosures,
well manicured lawns, neatly tended flowerbeds, shrubs and trees, some
of them exotic, which like many of the birds benefit from the milder
climate in the south-west. The all too common temptation to keep adding
more birds and aviaries has been resisted, and the pleasant relaxed
atmosphere and feeling of a spacious walled-garden has been retained
(Providing a haven from the hubbub of the town during the height of the
holiday season). The aviaries are mostly around the perimeters and many
have the advantage of backing onto or, in a few cases, having the back and
one side formed by Cornish stone walls.
The entrance to the gardens is in Fentonluna Lane, the other side of
which beyond another stone wall and high trees is the deer park in front
of Prideaux Place, an Elizabethan mansion.
Jack Brown and his wife moved in the late nineteen-sixties to Cornwall
and set about creating Padstow Tropical Bird Gardens from an &amp;quot;unkept
piece of land which had not seen a spade for 20 years.&amp;quot; The gardens opened
to the public at Whitsun 1970. The &apos;walk-in&apos; Tropical House was opened
two years later. The house was described in the Avicultural Magazine
1973(a) by the first Curator Richard Mark Martin.
Early inhabitants of the gardens included Sulphur-breasted Toucans
Ramphastos sulfuratus, White-crested Laughing Thrushes Garrulax leu-
colophus, Rosy and Chilean Flamingos Phoenicopterus r. ruber and

P. chilensis, two species of cranes and various waterfowl, including
Baikal Teal Anas farmosa, Red-crested Pochard Netta rufina, White-
faced Whistling Ducks Dendrocygna viduata, Mandarins and Carolinas
Aix galericulata and A. sponsa. There were also macaws and other
parrots.
Among the first birds to breed were Great Kiskadees Pitangus sulphu-
ratus, the parent birds having been bred at the now defunct Winged World
at Heysham, Lancs., where Richard had worked previously. Another early
member of the Padstow keeping staff was Dave Coles (until recently a
Council Member of our Society), who, when Richard moved on, eventu-
ally became Curator, before himself moving on.
During the early years another species which bred at Padstow was the
Emerald Dove Chalcophaps indica. Scha low&apos;s Touracos Tauraco living-
stonii schalowi nested unsuccessfully, and White-cheeked Touracos T.
leucotis bred first in 1971, but the two young died. They were badly
affected with Aspergillus fumigatus, the fungal spores coming it was
thought from straw used as nesting material (Martin, 1973, b). That
practise was immediately discontinued and White-cheeked Touracos later
bred successfully through to the second generation and beyond. Padstow
Gardens have been very successful with this touraco, and birds from there
have^one to several zoos, bird gardens and other collections.
They were also very successful with (Thailand) Hoopoes Upupa epops
longirostris. During 1973 fifteen were hatched and reared, though young
from some clutches suffered from splayed legs (Martin, 1974). The leg
problem initially thought to be due to a vitamin deficiency, was traced to
the nest-box floor being covered with peat, which gave little support to the
chick&apos;s legs and feet and caused them to splay. Chips of rotten wood were
used as a replacement and eradicated the problem (Coles, 1982).
The most notable breeding successes have been with the Tacazze
Sunbird Nectarinia tacazze (Coles, 1978, Martin, 1976), the Hunting
Cissa or Green Magpie Cissa chinensis (Coles, 1978), and the Crimson-
rumped Toucanet Aulacorhynchushaematopygus (Evans &amp; Coles, 1982,
Hughes, 1988). All three were first breedings of these species in Britain
and for each the Avicultural Society Certificate of Merit was awarded.
Bred at Frankfurt Zoo, two pairs of Fairy Blue Wrens Malurus cyaneus
although only in immature plumage and while still in quarantine, started
nest building using shredded newspaper. Dave Coles has kindly supplied
me with details of how one pair were placed in the Tropical House, and
within eight days completed a nest and went on to rear two young. The
second pair also quickly built a nest and laid in an outside aviary. The male
unfortunately died the day the first egg hatched. The port mortem revealed
worms of a type that could not be identified. The British Museum (Natural

History) thought that they could possibly have been a new species. During
the course of the next six months, sadly, the remaining three parents and
three young were lost. One disappeared, two died from causes which could
not be established and the others died from different causes.
Other breedings that have been reported in our magazine are the Scarlet
Ibis Eudocimus ruber (Evans, 1982, Hughes and Owen, 1988), and the
Golden Heart Dove Gallicolumba rufigula (Owen, 1985), the Plush-
capped Jay Cyanocorax chrysops, also known as the Pileated and Uracca
Jay (Coles, 1978), the Red-headed Laughing Thrush G. erythrocephalus
(Coles, 1979), and most recently the Red-tailed Laughing Thrush G.
milnei (Haines, 1989). The last initially was thought to be the first
breeding here, but subsequently there was a prior claim by a non-member,
who had as I recall, pipped Padstow&apos;s claim by a matter of just a week or
so.
In the past other species which have bred include Bartlett&apos;s and Luzon
Bleeding Heart Doves G. criniger and G. luzonica and the Sun Conure
Aratinga solstitialis. Among other recent breedings are the Violaceous
Touraco Musophaga violacea , the Red-crested species T. erythrolophus,
Dusky Lory Pseudeos fuscata, Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo Cacatua
sulphured , Noble Macaw Ara nobilis, Lilacine Amazon Amazona autum-
nalis lilacina and Orange-headed Ground Thrush Zoothera citrina. 1991
breedings to be added to the list include the Gough Island Moorhen
Gallinula nesiotes comeri, Bronze-wing Pigeon Phaps chalcoptera and
Superb Spreo Spreo superbus.
Having initiated the idea of breeding the Chough Pyrrhocorax pyr-
rhocorax in aviaries as a means of providing birds to attempt to re-
establish this splendid corvid around the Cornish coast as described in the
Avicultural Magazine 1991 97,2 : 51-58, it is a great disappointment that
despite having an aviary with a custom-made rock-face for nesting, the
Padstow birds have never progressed past egg-laying. It is perhaps
because the aviary does not provide sufficient seclusion. Surgical sexing
has shown them to be two true pairs. They are now getting on in years.
Richard can recall collecting one, already an adult, from north Wales in
1971. So one is at least 20 years old, probably more.
As well as several species mentioned already, the present collection
now in the hands of David Brown, also includes Ringed and Hottentot Teal

I like to cycle to Padstow along the 'Camel Trail'! In the Cornish
language camel means winding, and the trail or path is along the south
bank of the River Camel. The footpath-cum-cycle-trail follows what was
the route to Padstow of the railway line which was closed to passenger
traffic in 1967. Opened in 1899 &amp;quot;The five and a half miles of track between
Wa debridge and Padstow afforded the traveller one of the finest stretches
of scenery in Cornwall,....''. The river and estuary are a good place for
wild birds, especially waders and waterfowl. Large numbers pass through
each spring and autumn and winter there. A few years ago I was fortunate
enough to see three European Spoonbills Platalea leucorodia, which
were present for a week or so during October. More recent visitors have
included at least one Little Egret Egretta garzetta and, according to some
reports, a Red Kite Milvus milvus.

and Wayne McLeod (Senior keeper)
Channel-billed Toucans Ramphastos vitellinus are handsome
medium-sized Ramphastids which originate from Trinidad, Ven-
ezuela, the Guyanas and north and east Brazil. Channel-billed
Toucans belong to a species group that also includes Citron-
throated Toucans Ramphastos citreolaemus, and Yellow-ridged
Toucans Ramphastos arid which according to different taxonomic
authorities are variously accorded specific or subspecific status.
We follow Meyer de Schauensee (1970) in treating each of these as
a full species.
These closely related Toucans are distinguished by differences
in bill colour and pattern, in the colour of their facial skin, and that
of the bib which extends down from the face to the upper breast, and
in the colour of their rump and crissum. In the Channel-billed
Toucan the bill is largely black relieved by pale blue at the base, the
bare facial area is pale blue and the bib is white near the face
graduating into yellow on the throat and upper breast. A broad red
band separates the bib from the black lower breast and the rump and
crissum are red. This detailed description is given to assist in
avoiding confusion between this and closely related species.
Confusion in nomenclature abounds in the avicultural litera-
ture; for example Rutgers and Norris (1977) give Ramphastos
vitellinus the common names of Sulphur or White-breasted Toucan
and refer to the Yellow-ridged Toucan Ramphastos culminatus as
the Keel-billed or Channel-billed Toucan. This is all the more
confusing in that the name Keel-billed Toucan is now most com-
monly used for Ramphastos sulfuratus, also known as the Sulphur-
breasted Toucan.
Chester Zoo&apos;s breeding pair of Channel-billed Toucans com-
prise a female received in November 1984 and believed to have
been recently imported from Guyana, and a male received in July
1988 from Paradise Park, Hayle. The birds soon settled down and
became confident as sole occupants of their 6.8 x 2.6 x 3.5 m (22
ft. x 11 ft. x 13 ft.) high aviary which is situated in the upper gallery
of the Tropical House. Our Toucans are fed on a diet that includes

Channel-billed Toucans. Two recently fledged birds;
the first to be bred at Chester Zoo in 1989.
A grandfather clock type nest box measuring 40 cm x 40 cm x
90 cm ((16 in x 16 in x 34 in) deep with an entrance hole 10 cm (4
in) diameter was filled to within 40 cm of the hole with a mixture
of peat and forest bark. To assist entry and exit of the birds a wire
mesh ladder was fixed vertically to the box leading down from the
hole to the base. This nest box was fixed to the back wall of the
aviary and on 30th June 1989 the keeper noted that both birds were

spending considerable time inside it. The nest box was checked on
10th July when three eggs were seen. Both the male and the female
took turns in incubation. On 23rd July some broken egg shell was
found on the aviary floor and we suspected that at least one chick
had hatched. The food consumption of the birds had greatly
increased by 25th July with live food being taken into the nest box
by both parents. This included mealworms, crickets, giant morio
worms and locusts. The chicks were heard to call from within the
box on 2nd August. Pink mice were offered in addition to the other
items of live food but were ignored until 13th August when these
were taken by the parents to be fed to the chicks in the nest. The
appetite for live food increased markedly and by 16th August the
birds were being fed ten pink mice, twenty-four large locusts,
twelve giant morio worms and a handful of mealworms daily. This
was in addition to the apple, pear, grapes, tomato and banana that
the adults were seen to carry into the nest box.
Nest sanitation was observed on 5th September when the female
was seen to emerge from the nest box with a beakful of peat which
she then dropped onto the aviary floor. Both male and female
cleaned the nest to such an extent that when the chicks fledged no
peat or forest bark remained. A youngster fledged on 12th Septem-
ber, a day after it had been first seen peering out of the nest box.
The female continued to carry food into the nest box from which
chick calls could be heard whilst both adults became excited
calling loudly and continuously after the first chick had fledged.
For a period of four to five days before this first chick fledged
hardly any live food was taken. A second chick fledged three days
later. Pink mice were not accepted after 19th September and from
then on not offered to the birds. Both chicks were first seen feeding
themselves on 22nd September although the parents continued to
feed them for some weeks after fledging. The bills of the fledglings
were shorter than those of the adults. On fledging the chicks&apos; bills
were all black but a few days after fledging the base of the bill paled
then gradually turned pale blue as in the adult. The fledglings also
differed in that their yellow and red feathering was less intense than
that of the adults. We also noted that on first fledging the chicks&apos;
tails were still growing with the basal portions of each rectrix still
in sheath. Both chicks were reared successfully and in February
1990 were transferred to Paignton Zoo.
In 1990 the adult pair showed signs of breeding in early April
when the male was observed feeding the female. By 17th April both
birds were spending long periods in the nest box. A month later a

broken egg was found and that is our only record for that breeding
attempt. However on 28th May it was considered that from their
behaviour the Toucans had re-nested and two eggs were observed
when the nest box was checked on 31st May 1990. Changes in the
adults behaviour suggested that a chick or chicks had hatched on
14th June. That would indicate an incubation period of around
seventeen days. At first sight this appears a very short incubation
period for such a large bird but may in fact be an overestimate;
Skutch (1983) quotes Bourne as giving an incubation period of only
15 %days for the related Red-billed Toucan Ramphastos tucanus.
Behaviour of the adult birds in 1990 was similar to that recorded
in 1989 in that initially only a small amount of live food was taken
by the adults with no interest in pink mice until the chicks were over
10 days old. The first chick fledged on 30th July followed by a
second the next day. The youngest Toucan had to be removed from
the parents a month later because of aggression towards it from the
male. This chick died three days later but the first was successfully
reared and after being surgically sexed as a female remains in our
collection paired to an unrelated male.
The original breeding pair re-nested in 1991 laying the first egg
of a clutch of four on 23rd April. On 2nd May two eggs were
removed from the nest by the parents. Both of these contained dead
embryos which had died in early incubation. The remaining two
eggs were candled and proved to be fertile but when the box was
checked on 15th May both were still unhatched. These were
checked again and found to have also died in early incubation. The
nest box was then emptied by the keepers and refilled with fresh
peat and forest bark after which the Toucans soon showed interest
in re-nesting.
The nest box was checked again on 3rd June 1991 when a clutch
of five eggs was found. Candling these eggs indicated four to be
fertile. On 11th June a hatched egg shell on the aviary floor
indicated that the first chick had hatched and two days later a
second egg-shell was found. Checking the nest box on 21st June
revealed four chicks. On 27th June the adults were again carrying
large amounts of live food. On 1st July three chicks were observed
in the nest. Although there was then no sign of its remains one of
the chicks must have succumbed in the previous 10 days. The
chicks were naked and of an unusual grey-blue colour. On 26th July
a chick was seen peering out of the nest being encouraged to fledge
by both its parents. The following day two chicks had fledged
followed by the third two days later on 29th July.

Channel-billed Toucans at Chester Zoo. Parents with two fledglings, 1989.
Channel-billed Toucans receive their name from the groove or
channel that runs below the culmen of the upper mandible along the
length of the bill. We noted that, whilst our breeding male has a
pronounced channel on the bill, the channel is lacking in the female
and we^wondered whether this difference might be an aid to sexing.
Accordingly the skins of seven males and five females were
examined at the British Museum, Tring. Other unsexed specimens
were also examined but none were without a channel although in
one specimen this was very shallow. Channel development was
scored as shallow, standard or pronounced. Of the seven males two
had pronounced channels, two had standard channels and three had
only shallow channels. Of the five females none had pronounced
channels, three had standard channels and two had shallow chan-
nels. Thus it would appear that channel development is inconsist-
ent and that our female was eccentric in showing no sign of channel
development. However measurements of the bills of the museum
specimens indicated that bill length was a good guide to sex with
bills consistently longer in males than females. For the seven males
measured bill length ranged from 121 to 138 m (mean = 131 mm)
whilst that of the five females ranged from 98 to 116 mm (mean =
106 mm). Bill length was measured by callipers from the tip of the
bill to the point along the culmen at the top of the base of the upper
mandible where the bill meets the feathering of the forehead.
However bill length may only be useful in sexing adult birds. We
noticed that in recently fledged birds the bills were markedly
shorter than those of the adults.
The breeding behaviour of Channel-billed Toucans in the wild
is not well documented although Lill (1970) provides some very

useful data from two nests he studied in Trinidad. Herklots (1961)
indicated that as in other Toucans, the Channel-billed Toucan nests
in holes high up in trees but the nest holes found by Lill were only
3.4 m (10 ft.) and 1.1 m (4 ft.) above the ground. Lill notes that both
nests were 30 to 45 cm (12 to HV 2 in) deep and the holes were
relatively small, each being less than 64 mm average diameter
forcing the adults to &amp;quot;wriggle&amp;quot; in and out of the nest. Our nest box
was filled to a level about 40 cm from the hole but the hole was
rather larger being about 10 cm in diameter.
Clutch sizes over four nesting attempts of our pair at Chester
were 3,2,4, and 5. Herklots (1961) quotes two as the normal clutch
size but Lill (1970) recorded clutches of 4 and 3. Five seems an
unusually large clutch.
Lill estimated the nestling period as being between 44 and 51
days for the one nest that successfully fledged, noting that the first
value was comparable to that given by a previous author. Our
observations indicated a nestling period of 52 days for the first
chick in 1989, and 46 days in both 1990 and 1991. Again these
agree well with periods observed in the wild. There are no records
of the incubation period of Channel-billed Toucans determined
from nests in the wild. Our observations suggested it may be of the
order of 17 days but as previously noted this may be an over
estimate.
We have been unable to find any previous records of captive
breeding of Channel-billed Toucans in the U.K. although this
species was bred in the USA by Rod Barth in June 1987 for which
he subsequently received a U.S. First Breeding Avy Award
(Thompson 1989).

One of the least known Amazon Parrots in aviculture is Pretre's or the
Red-spectacled Amazona pretrei. Briefly it resembles the Tucuman
Amazon A. tucumana but the red on the head is a deeper shade and extends
from the forehead to encircle the eye. The species was virtually unknown
to aviculturists until the 1980s and it remains very rare. Its numbers and
its range are said to be declining rapidly. It is now known to occur only
in Rio Grande do Sul in the south-east of Brazil. It may also survive in
adjacent parts of north-eastern Argentina. There has been a substantial
decline in is numbers since the 1970s, mainly because of destruction of the
Araucaria pine forest with which it is associated. The ripe seeds are its
principal food during certain times of the year. Apparently, little virgin
forest of this type now survives within its range. After the breeding season
it migrates early each year from the southern part of Rio Grande do Sul to
the north.

The Tucuman Amazon, to which it is closely related, is also endan-
gered by habitat destruction and by excessive trade, as the result of which
it was placed on CITES Appendix 1 in 1989. Pretre&apos;s Amazon, however,
had been placed on Appendix 1 several years previously when it was
unknown in aviculture.
Although the two species are very similar in colour and size, their
personalities are different. Much as I like the Tucuman, I would describe
pretrei as on of the friendliest, most cheeky and cheerful parrots in
existence! It seems inherently almost fearless but usually without the
vicious streak which accompanies fearlessness in some of the larger
Amazons. It is a truly delightful bird to keep. Most specimens will whistle
or call out to attract attention when anyone passes the aviary. It is a small
Amazon weighing between 240 gms and 310 gms and measuring 12 in (30
- 31 cm). Several books quote a greater length, even up to 35 cm - but this
is incorrect.
At Palmitos Park, Gran Canaria, Pretre&apos;s Amazon is well represented
in the off-exhibit breeding centre. The genus Amazona is the prime
interest of Klaus Paulmann, the founder of Palmitos Park. He had been
breeding endangered species of Amazons, such as the Cuban A. 1.
leucocephala , Yellow-shouldered A. barbadensis and the Tucuman, also
threatened species such as the Hispaniolan A. ventralis and the Green-
cheeked or Mexican Red-headed A. viridigenalis long before I joined the
staff of Palmitos Park in February 1989. In 1990 the following Amazons
were reared: Cuban, Hispaniolan, Yellow-lored A. xantholora , Lilac-
crowned A. finschi, Yellow-shouldered, A. barbadensis , Double Yellow-
head A. ochrocephala oratrix and Pretre&apos;s. All were reared by Amazons
with the exception of some of the barbadensis and one Hispaniolan which
had to be hand-reared because of a bacterial infection. In 1991 all the
foregoing Amazons were reared, plus Bodin&apos;s Amazon A. /. bodini ,
Yellow-fronted A. ochrocephala, the rare Tres Marias A. o. tresmariae
and the Green-cheeked A. viridigenalis .
Most of the pretrei had been flying together in a fairly large aviary for
some months. They were not sexed as I was under the misapprehension
that they were sexually dimorphic! They were paired up towards the end
of February 1990 and we were left with what we believed to be four males.
These were placed together in a breeding aviary with a nest-box. Among
our group of this species were some obvious males and some obvious
females but sexing is not as easy as has been suggested by some authors.
Males are said to have more red on the head and wing or on the wing. I
tried to assess this feature in association with the size and shape of the head
and beak. Certainly some females have noticeably smaller heads and
beaks and most have less red in the plumage. However, I would advise

chromosomal or surgical sexing of this species as there is always the
exception which proves the rule.
And so it was for on 30th March one of the four&amp;quot; males&amp;quot; was incubating
three eggs! A fourth was laid soon afterwards. It appeared that the female
was paired to the most assertive male who was often displaying. The other
two males were removed from the aviary. At this point it should be stated
that it is easier to separate this particular male and female by behaviour,
the female being more subdued, than by appearance, although the male
does have marginally more extensive red on the carpal edge of the wing.
We were delighted to discover that all four eggs were fertile. Nest
inspection was simple, being carried out from the service passage in the
next block of aviaries. One had only to tap gently on the nest-box for the
female to leave. The box measures 11 in (29 cm) square and 15 J /4 in.
(40 cm) high. Wood shavings were placed in the bottom.
The aviaries are of the traditional walk-in kind, with part of the roof,
one side and the front of welded mesh. On the mesh side, each aviary is
divided from the next by sufficient space for flowering hibiscus which not
only break up stark outlines, but create a pleasant environment. Each
aviary (most of those in this block house Amazons) measures approxi-
mately 8^ft. (2.4 m) x 4 ft. (1.2 m) x 7 ft. (2.1 m) high.
On 20th April, probably 25 days after the first egg was laid, a pip mark
was seen. Early in the morning of 22nd April, there was a chick in the nest,
on the following morning there were two chicks. The third egg was
pipping on the morning of 24th April and the chick had hatched by 3 pm
the next day. The fourth egg was pipping on 26th April but the chick did
not hatch until the morning of the 29th or during the previous evening. I
assume the latter. It appears that the eggs hatched after 26 and 27 days
incubation. Three of the four chicks were weighed on the day they
hatched. Their weights varied from 10 to 12 gms depending upon the
amount of food in the crop.
From hatching to about seven days pretrei chicks have white down
which is quite dense on the back and much sparser on the head. After six
days the back darkens with the feathers growing under the skin. Because
of this the three oldest chicks had a grey appearance by the beginning of
May; their eyes were still closed. Many of their wing feathers had erupted
by 13th May. The red forehead and red carpal edge of the wing already
distinguished the oldest chick as a pretrei.
The chicks were closed-ringed when aged between 12 and 14 days with
9.5 mm bands (internal measurement) but I realised later that 9 mm is the
correct size. The young grew well and their crops were always bulging
with food for the first month. After this the young were fed less frequently
as is normal for Amazons. The rearing diet consisted of unlimited fresh

corn (much of it grown on the premises, along with other vegetables and
fruits), the normal mixed food which consisted of sprouted sunflower,
boiled maize and chopped greenfood, varied daily with cooked rice in the
husk, butter beans, peas and/or chopped carrot, plus a mixture of chopped
fruits and our own rearing food made from hard-boiled egg, carrot, non-
fat soft cheese and wholegrain bread. They also consumed a mixture of
small soaked seeds (oats, canary and hemp) and spray millet.
The rearing period was totally uneventful. By the end of May the
three eldest chicks were fully feathered, the youngest nearly so.
Immature plumage differs from that of adults in the following respect. The
red on the crown and forehead is less extensive and only one of the four
had some red feathers below the eye. The same youngster had the
feathers of the forehead green, margined with red to produce a pretty
scalloped effect, while in the others the feathers were solid red. The red
is a ruby shade, perhaps even deeper than in the adults, unlike the Tucuma n
Amazon in which immature birds have the forehead orange, not brick red
as in the adults. Immature pretrei have much less red on the wing: there
is a little on the bend, little or none on the carpal edge, and red on some
of the primary coverts - but much less than in an adult. The amount varied
in the four young. The alula is green, not red as in adults (I think these
pure red feathers are among the most beautiful of any parrot). The thighs
are entirely green, whereas in adults they are partly red. The iris is pale
grey (chrome yellow in adults) and the beak is ivory. In the parents it is
ivory tinged with orange on the sides of the upper mandible.
The young left the nest on 9th, 12th, 13th, and 21st June. I believe that
they fledged in the following order: second, third, first and fourth, after 53,
48,49 and 55 days in the nest. Even if I am wrong and the eldest left first,
it would have been after 49 days. As is usual with Amazons, they started
to feed on their own within two or three days of leaving. I believe that the
longer young birds can stay with their parents, the better it is for them.
After all, in the wild they stay as a family unit for many months. Often
this is not possible in an aviary because restricted space leads to aggressive
behaviour.
Our experiences with this pair made the breeding of Pretre's Amazon
seem deceptively easy - but another pair seemed determined to prove the
contrary. They were housed in our new breeding centre, a fully enclosed
building containing more than 100 suspended cages. The temperament of
this pair is totally different from that of the calm couple who reared the
young. They are extremely excitable and, uniquely among our pretrei ,
both male and female are aggressive. It is generally true that the small
Amazons are easier to breed than the large ones but it is also a fact that
breeding problems are more likely to arise with aggressive individuals.

There is a risk that the young will be killed on hatching. This female laid
three eggs, only one of which was fertile. It hatched on 13th May. Sadly
the chick was killed within minutes of hatching. The female did not nest
again in 1990 but, in future , her eggs will be fostered to other Amazons,
preferably pretrei. Several other females laid but all the eggs were
infertile. It should be noted that it was a first breeding attempt for all our
pairs.
However, the 1991 results were disappointing, producing a large
number of infertile eggs. The previously successful pair were the only
ones to produce young. The female laid the first of three eggs on 25th April
and the third probably on the 30th. On 13th May they were moved to an
incubator in the hope that the female would produce a second clutch. She
did not. The temperament of a female pretreiwho had laid for the first time
was therefore tested. Her own eggs were infertile. She was given the
pipping egg of a Finsch's Amazon two days before the first pretrei hatched.
This chick was well cared for and nest inspection was very easy (the latter
being an important requirement of foster parents). She was therefore
given each pretrei egg the day before it hatched. The three chicks, along
with the finschi, were reared without incident. The chicks were seldom
weighed or handled because the female became very excited when this
occurred, although she did not enter the nest. This female, unlike the male,
reacted very aggressively towards anyone who approached the aviary.
The three young, which appear to be two males and a female, left the nest
on 7th, 10th and 13th July - and the finschi on 15th July. The latter was
not fed by its foster parents and was removed to be hand-fed. Some
Amazons will feed fostered chicks of a different Amazon species after
they have left the nest; others will not. In future, if Amazons chicks have
to be fostered, they will be removed for hand-rearing by four weeks.
Our experiences to date with this species indicate that it nests very
readily but that most pairs are single-brooded, whatever the outcome of
the clutch. Only a small number of Pretre&apos;s Amazons exist in aviculture,
perhaps about 100. However, I believe that this species will eventually
become firmly established and that it will prove to be one of the easier
Amazons to breed.

About 90 members and their guests accepted the kind invitation of
Mr and Mrs Ken Dolton to visit their home &amp;quot;Parklands&amp;quot;, near Worcester,
on Sunday 15th September 1991. The weather was kind and we enjoyed
a very warm sunny autumn day. The extensive collection of livestock at
Parklands is mainly of parrots and waterfowl plus what may be the largest
private collection of tortoises in the country. The parrots were varied and
contained species varying in size from the Bourkes parrakeet to the
Macaws. Several aviaries had a pair plus their 1991 offspring on show.
Of particular interest are the Thick-billed Parrots of which there were
several pairs. Ken was in fact the first person to breed this species in
this country, in 1976, and it is pleasing that they are still being bred at
&amp;quot;Parklands". Amongst the various waterfowl were Red-breasted Geese,
Swans, and both Demoiselle and Crowned Cranes. There was also a pair
of White-cheeked Touracos.
The various aviaries and enclosures are set in landscaped grounds.
The Doltons were able to show a picture of their house in 1966 just after
it was built and the grounds freshly planted with numerous shrubs, trees
etc. The grounds are now mature and a credit to our hosts. There are
also various greenhouses, one containing cacti, another ferns. A lot of
the plants had name tags and several members were observed taking down
names with the object of obtaining these plants for themselves.
An excellent buffet lunch was provided by outside caterers and
members were able to mix and exchange news, views etc. After lunch
two beautiful framed colour photographs, donated by Cyril Laubscher, a
member of the Society, were auctioned by David Spilsbury. The pictures
were of a Blue-headed Pionus Parrot and a Fork-tailed Wood Nymph
Hummingbird. The profit from the lunch, the auction and donations
amounted to almost #300 for the Society's funds. We are all most grateful
to Ken and Mona Dolton for inviting the Avicultural Society to their home
and for their continued support. It also transpired that it was Ken&apos;s
birthday as well!

A Lesser Bird of Paradise Paradisaea minor was hatched
recently at the Bronx Zoo, New York. The chick was hand-raised
and is apparently the first of this rarely-kept species to be reared in
this way. The protocol established for the successful hand-raising
of ten Red Birds of Paradise P. rubra in 1988-89 was used. The
Lesser Bird of Paradise lays only one egg per clutch. The hatching
of this chick is of special interest because the father lacks the
handsome adult plumage, being only three years old, and would
normally be considered to be immature. A project is under way in
which reproductive behaviour is being studied in the Red and the
Lesser Bird of Paradise.

Paulton Park, Romsey, Hants came second with their successful
breedings of many species of waterfowl and pheasant, Lesser Hill
Mynahs, Black-headed Caiques and Goffin&apos;s Cockatoos.
Twenty years ago the Mauritius Kestrel was considered to be the
world&apos;s rarest bird with only four known survivors. However, a
conservation programme devised and performed by the Jersey
Wildlife Preservation Trust, the Government of Mauritius and the
World Centre for Birds of Prey in the U.S. has saved it from
extinction and provided a glowing example of the potential role of
aviculture in the conservation of endangered species. A captive
breeding programme in Mauritius, organised by Carl Jones a
Mauritius resident employed by the Trust, was begun just over ten
years ago and has resulted in the release into the wild of 120 birds
reared in captivity. The programme will continue until the opti-
mum number of wild breeding pairs had been established. In the
meantime, two pairs of these beautiful birds have been placed by
the Government of Mauritius on loan to the Trust at Jersey where
the first European breeding of this very rare falcon occurred in
June of this year.
Alan Lieberman (Curator of Birds, San Diego Zoo) has submit-
ted for publication in the Avicultural Magazine detailed tables
summarising the Zoo&apos;s remarkable breeding results during 1989
and 1990. The tables state whether the birds were parent-reared or
hand-reared, their sex if known (usually determined in non-survi-
vors during post-mortem examination) and the numbers which did
not survive for 30 days. I have calculated the numbers which did
survive and these are given in the following lists.

Encyclopedia of Animals. Birds. Consultant editor, Joseph
Forshaw. 1991, Merehurst Press, Ferry House, 51/57 Lacy Road,
London, SW15 1PR. Price #25.00
This is a well-produced book containing hundreds of magnifi-
cent photographs and original paintings. It is written by a panel of
internationally well-known ornithologists. The first part of the
book consists of comprehensive, lucid chapters on general aspects
of the natural history of birds including Taxonomy, Evolution,
Behaviour and Habitat. There is also a very interesting one by
Alison Smitherfield on Endangered Species in which she presents
a thoughtful and fascinating account of the various factors which
lead to the extinction of species and how they may possibly be
avoided. The remainder of the book is devoted to systematically-
arranged, well-illustrated descriptions of the various kinds of bird.
There is not enough space in a couple of hundred pages to make
every chapter comprehensive and, consequently, many species of
particular avicultural interest (e.g. parrot finches, lovebirds, parra-
keets of the genus Neophema) are hardly mentioned . Particular
emphasis is placed throughout on conservation and at the beginning
of every chapter of the second part of the book there is a relevant
selection from the ICBP list of threatened species (none of which,
except some parrots, has ever been a common avicultural subject!)
This attractive, beautifully illustrated and interesting book would
make an excellent present for a young person anxious to learn about
the wonderful world of birds.

A n introduction to Garden Birds of South Africa VHS Video (PG Oil)
with bird calls by courtesy of Len Gilliard. An accompanying leaflet
Gardening For Birds by Geoff Nichols, lists the types of plants which
attract birds to a garden. LLA Productions (PTY) Ltd.
Members, especially seedeater and softbill enthusiasts, should be
delighted by this new video which features just over 60 species. These
are categorised according to their food: seedeaters, fruiteaters, etc. There
is a lot of good advice about ways of attracting birds to gardens, including
natural food sources and putting out food, e.g. bread soaked in milk and
sprinkled with sugar, and cooked &apos;meallie&apos; (maize!) meal for seedeaters,
home-made nectar forsunbirds and, most interesting to me the provision
of bone meal to attract insectivorous species.
Small seedeaters featured include the Blue or Blue-breasted Waxbill,
the 'Common&apos;, or as aviculturists more often call it, the St. Helena Waxbill,
Bronze Mannikin, Pin-tailed Whydah, and the Green Singing Finch (in
South Africa called the Yellow-eyed Canary), Bully, Forest and Streaky-
headed Canaries. There are also good shots of weavers, some at their
nests, and the gorgeous Red Bishop or Orange Weaver. The male Cape
Sparrow looks an attractive little fellow. Four members of the Pigeon
family complete the seedeaters.
Fruit, whether growing in a garden, or put out specially for birds,
attracts a rich variety of species. A rural garden in the bush veld with a
fruiting fig tree, may, viewers are told, be visited by Violet-backed
Starlings (there called the Plum-coloured). Another garden visitor is the
Cape Glossy Starling. Four species of bulbuls are shown. There are nice
shots of the Black-collared Barbet eating an apple, Levaillant&apos;s or the
Crested species is shown, and my favourite is the little Golden-rumped
Tinkerbird at its nest-hole. Some like mousebirds and the introduced
Indian Myna, Common in Natal, are not always welcome where fruit is
grown.
Water for drinking and bathing also proves a great attraction. I recall
in Kenya on a visit to a suburban garden outside Nairobi, being thrilled to
see a Hartlaub's Touraco come down to the bird bath. In this video there
is a Purple-crested Touraco or Lourie at a bird bath. This bird&apos;s beauty
is for me, rivalled only by the striking Black-headed Oriole shown later.
I love the idea of having the Malachite Sunbird come to the garden to
sip nectar and, I expect, snap-up insects from the flowers, as happens in
gardens in the Natal Drakenbergs, and enjoyed seeing the Greater and
Lesser Double-collared Sunbirds, the Amethyst or Black, the White-

bellied species and the flowers and butterflies.
If the garden has thick cover the commentator explains, it maybe home
to the Cape Robin (Chat) which ventures out at dawn and dusk while the
Chorister Robin is more often heard than seen. In South Africa and on
the commentary called Robins, elsewhere they are usually called Robin
Chats. The Natal Robin occurs in gardens on the east coast. Less shy are
the Kurrichane and Olive Thrushes.
A lawn is also a popular feeding place for the Hoopoe. Other
insectivorous species featured included the Red-billed or Green Wood
Hoopoe, the Cardinal Woodpecker and Paradise Flycatcher. On this
video the largest species and one which may seem an unlikely garden
visitor is the Hadada Ibis.

there that year. The script writer received a Special Merit Award for her
research for this programme.
The twenty-six Orders of birds found in southern Africa are
presented in more or less the same sequence as that followed in the
authoritative bird books of the region. The name of each Order is
carefully pronounced, that name is shown on the screen and the charac-
teristics of the birds in that Order are described with words and pictures.
Much is made of describing the different Orders. Too much I feel. I would
like to have learnt more about the individual species. Also the commen-
tary, is I feel too slow and 'dry&apos; and academic in tone and would have
benefited from a lighter touch. Many if not most of us have available a
wide choice of wildlife programmes on TV and are accustomed to a very
slick style of presentation. Too often that seems to be treated as more
important than the content. This presentation though could easily have
moved along more quickly and been more lively and entertaining
without becoming superficial.
Much of the video footage is excellent and I enjoyed seeing it, some
looks to be of birds in collections, a few of the birds, e.g. the Cape Parrot
and Rosy-or Peach-faced Lovebird are obviously in aviaries and, I think,
I spotted a few stuffed birds!
As twenty-five of the Orders consist of Non-Passerines (from the
Ostrich to the woodpeckers, the Red-throated Wryneck and barbets), this
video is devoted mainly to them, with Passerines (Perching Birds) given

somewhat cursory treatment at the end. I would like it to have dwelt less
on some of the larger species, particularly the more familiar ones, and
given extra time to the smaller birds, e.g. it would have been nice to see
more of species such as the Forest Weaver, Spotted Thrush and the Cape
Sugarbird and Cape White-eye. Some, especially the smaller birds, are
not named on the commentary, which is unhelpful for those without a
good knowledge of African birds. The accompanying leaflet however
lists all the birds, just over 150 species, in the sequence in which they
appear. Included also is each species' number in Ian Sinclair&apos;s Field
Guide to the Birds of Southern Africa, which follow those in the &apos;new&apos;
revised Roberts&apos; Birds of South Africa.
It is hoped to find overseas outlets for these videos, in the meantime
they are available from LLA Productions (PTY) Ltd., P.O. Box 22174,
Glenashley 4022, South Africa. Price #12.50 each plus #2.50 each

I.Z.N. was founded in 1951 to give the
world's zoos a regular medium for the
exchange of information, news and ideas.
With contributors in six continents, and
subscribers in more than 40 countries, it
is still the only specialist journal which
covers all aspects of the international zoo
scene. Every issue contains full-length
articles on animal management and
related topics (often including translations
from foreign publications), as well as numerous shorter news
items from zoos in Britain and overseas. Other regular features are
book reviews, conservation news, a free service for advertising
surplus and wanted stock, profiles of famous animal collections,
and reference lists of important articles in other zoo publications.
Professionals and amateurs alike find reading I.Z.N. the best way
to keep up with new developments in the zoo world.

THE HON. SECRETARY AND TREASURER, THE AVICULTURAL
SOCIETY, c/o BRISTOL ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS, CLIFTON,
BRISTOL, BS8 3HA, ENGLAND.
THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have
not been published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture
of a particular bird or group of birds, or that describe their natural history.
Articles should be preferably typewritten, with double spacing, and the
scientific names as well as the vernacular names of birds should be given.
References cited in the text should be listed at the end of the article. Line
drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card; black and white
photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be used
where possible and should be clearly captioned. If authors wish their
eventual return, they must say so when submitting the article and write
their name on the back of each photograph.
