CABOT'S TRAGOPAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963287176470588" page_id="56350037"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
(Tragopan caboti)
By Philip Wayre (Norwich, England)
The genus Tragopan consists of five species and two sub-species.
Of these, three species are at present in the Trust's collection. Satyr
Tragopan satyra, Temminck's Tragopan temmincki and Cabot's Tragopan
caboti. The last two species have again been bred this year. Cabot's
Tragopan is not quite so brightly coloured as the other two, having
less red in its plumage ; the general appearance of the male being
pale buff, spotted with black and a tinge of red. The crest and the
sides of the neck are orange-red and the facial skin orange-yellow,
giving the head an altogether paler and more orange look than the
other species. The hen Cabot's is very similar to the hen Temminck's
except that the breast is paler and more heavily streaked with whitish
feathers.
Much has been written about breeding and rearing Tragopans but
in many instances authors have merely re-hashed accounts of breedings
which have taken place at the beginning of the century. Feeding-stuffs
and rearing methods have changed considerably in the last decade
and some of the old beliefs are no longer true so that an up-to-date
account of breeding Cabot's in the Trust's collection may not be out of
place.
Five males and two females of this species were imported from China
in the winter of i960 as previously reported (Avicultural Magazine,
Vol. 67, No. 1). Both hens laid the following summer but, unfortunately,
only one male survived the journey, quarantine and the subsequent
change of environment. Despite a choice of elevated nest-boxes and
baskets in their enclosures both these hen Cabot's made their nests on
the ground underneath shrubs. Three young were reared from three
eggs produced by the pair, two of the young surviving to maturity,
both being hens. Last summer the same adult pair laid four eggs in
their first clutch and from these four young were reared. Unfortunately
one died when nearly five months old and proved to be a male, the
remaining three all appear to be females. The nest in 1962 was in
precisely the same spot under a shrub as in the previous year.

<bodyText confidence="0.99822" page_id="56350038"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
Adult Cabot's are very arboreal, spending much time in trees and
shrubs when not actually feeding, but it is interesting that these two
wild-caught hens both nested on the ground despite a choice of elevated
nest-boxes. This has not often been the case before, judging from old
accounts of breeding this species.
The eggs took twenty-nine days to hatch under a bantam and the
chicks were easily reared. It has often been stated that Tragopan
chicks do not eat much for the first two days, but this is common to all
pheasants. The young Cabot's were brought up from the start on a
proprietary brand of pheasant-starter crumb, with a little finely
chopped lettuce and grated hard boiled yolk of egg scattered over the
crumbs for the first three weeks. Live maggots were also given daily
from the start. In common with other Tragopans the Cabot's chicks
need to be given heat of some kind until they are two months old,
especially at night.
All the brooders containing young pheasants are moved daily across
a freshly mown lawn, but no other green food is fed to young Tragopans
except the chopped lettuce mentioned above.
While Cabot's have not in the past proved easy to keep or to rear
it is to be hoped that with modern conditions and feeding it will be
possible to build up a sound stock of this rare species. Perhaps two of
the most important points are to give them plenty of space with large
runs and to refrain from feeding corn of any kind, since the males are
liable to die of heart trouble or fits if allowed to become over-fat. A
diet of turkey or pheasant breeders pellets and fruit with plenty of
natural greenfood is essential.

The past year has been an important one in that for the first time
part of the Trust's collection was open to the public.
As many Members are no doubt aware the continual growth of the
collection with all that its maintenance entails, supported as it is by
a limited income from subscriptions and donations, has become an
increasing financial burden upon the Hon. Director. At the same time
his private collection of birds and mammals has also continued to
expand. During the year the scheme to develop some 26 acres of land
at Gt. Witchingham, as mentioned in the 1961 Report, has been put
into operation. A representative selection of the Trust's birds is now

on view to the general public within the new Wildlife Park. To
accommodate these birds additional pens have been constructed ; these
include a series of nine large open-topped pens each measuring 24 by
60 feet and containing an electrically heated Leckford hut for
tropical species. In addition a range of smaller pens each measuring
40 by 20 feet with a central service passage has been erected.
These pens are roofed with Ulstron (nylon) netting and each contains
an unheated shelter.
The remainder of the Wildlife Park has been laid out to exhibit
other birds and mammals. A chain of seven new pools for water birds
has been constructed, the largest of these pools covering almost three-
quarters of an acre. One of them is set aside for flamingoes and another
for waders. The remainder accommodate a large variety of waterfowl.
The original waterfowl gardens with their eight pools have also been
included in the Park. Many large aviaries have been built for birds
of prey and other birds, including a walk-thro' aviary housing British
birds. A number of Macaws are at liberty with their headquarters in
a fallen tree.
A Gatehouse comprising a shop, kitchen and tea-room has been
built together with a block of public lavatories. Near the tea-room
an enclosure of about an acre has been made in which a number of
cock pheasants of various species are exhibited together with Wallabies
and Soay sheep. This Pheasant Lawn has been planted with flowering
shrubs and it is hoped to increase the cock birds on view to make a
really fine show. It is significant that while comparatively few members
of the public pay any serious attention to pens containing individual
pairs of even rarities such as Bornean Great Argus or Cabot's Tragopan,
they are impressed by this mixed collection of cock birds, especially
as they are able to walk amongst them in the enclosure.
In addition to the birds there are over a dozen enclosures and pens
containing mammals, and more are under construction.
The aim of the new Wildlife Park is not merely to provide a spectacle
or to compete with existing Zoological Gardens, but to encourage the
general public to take an interest in all forms of wild life and to impress
upon them the need for conservation. For these reasons the theme at
Great Witchingham is mainly upon showing British and European
creatures under as near natural conditions as possible, with emphasis
upon those species threatened with extinction in the wild.
While the public is charged for admission to the Park, Members of
the Trust are always welcome at any time free of charge. This privilege
has already resulted in a steady rise in membership, which now stands
at eleven Life Members, five Sustaining Members, 193 Ordinary
Members, making a total of 209. Needless to say members of the Trust
are always welcome to inspect that part of the collection which remains
outside the new Park.

The whole 26 acres of the Park has been enclosed with a vermin-
proof galvanized netting fence of very heavy gauge. It is 8 feet high
and has an overhang both inwards and outwards. This fence is almost
a mile in length, and over ten tons of steel was used in the netting
alone. At the time of going to press over 30,000 members of the general
public have visited the Wildlife Park since it opened on 1st August.
Mr. Arthur Jennings of the School of Veterinary Medicine, Cam-
bridge, has continued his valuable work in conducting post-mortem
examinations and Mr. Barrow has kindly prepared several skins for the
Trust's collection. Mr. John Wood, our veterinary surgeon, has given
much of his time to the Trust's work. Your Council is extremely
grateful to these gentlemen for their co-operation. Once again during
the year samples of egg-white from infertile eggs have been sent to
Cornell University, U.S.A. to help Professor Charles Sibley in his
research into the taxonomic relationship of birds by means of electro-
phoresis of egg-white protein. The generous contribution made by
Cornell University towards the mailing of these samples is gratefully
acknowledged.
A number of infertile eggs and chicks which suffered early mortality
were sent to the British Museum (Nat. Hist.) to strengthen their
collection of rarer species of pheasants.
Twenty-one young Swinhoe's (.Lophura swinhoei) were reared in the
collection and negotiations are continuing with the Government of
Formosa for the majority of these to be sent back to Formosa to be
turned down in a protected area to reinforce the depleted wild stock
of this species. The authorities there have intimated that their
Government is about to pass an order protecting Swinhoe's Pheasants
in Formosa. When this operation has been completed it will constitute
what is perhaps the most significant achievement by the Trust to date.
This will be one of the very rare occasions when the application of
Aviculture has been directly instrumental in helping to save a species
threatened with extinction in the wild.
A formal request has been made to the World Wildlife Fund for
a grant towards the cost of packing and sending these birds by air to
Formosa.
Your Council is pleased to report that Mr. R. E. Moreau of
the Edward Giey Institute of Field Ornithology and President of the
British Ornithologists' Union is about to conduct research into the
relationship between Common Quail (Coturnix c. coturnix ) and Japanese
Quail (Coturnix c. japonica ) and for this purpose four pairs of Common
Quail have been specially imported from Spain. The generosity and
assistance of Senor Alberto Duran of the Zoological Gardens, Jerez,
who obtained these birds for the Trust is very much appreciated.
Early this spring a new rearing lawn was laid out. It is on a new ley
and measures 35 by 40 yards and is surrounded by a small mesh wire

installed capable of heating twenty-seven separate brooders. One
dozen Leckford type brooders have been adapted to heating by electri-
city by means of installing heater elements. In addition some twenty
smaller electric brooders are in use. After the age of seven to eight
weeks the young birds are moved to a range of Whitlock fold units some
sixty of which are on loan to the Trust.
At the request of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association a Wild-
life exhibit was staged at the Royal Norfolk Show on 27th and 28th
June. In addition to a number of British mammals and some birds of
prey, three pens of ornamental pheasants were exhibited--these were
Swinhoe's, Reeves's ( Syrmaticus reevesi ) and Blue Eared Pheasants
(Crossoptilon auritum ). They proved a great attraction and nearly 3,000
leaflets describing the aims of the Trust were distributed.

Partridge has been imported into this country. Both pairs have settled
down well.
One male Mikado Pheasant ( Syrmaticus mikado ) was donated to the
Trust by Drs. Dien Zuh-Ming and Liu Yen of Taiwan Museum. In
the same consignment they sent a pair of Mikado Pheasants to our
Member, Mr. A. J. Swain of Bedford. Mr. Swain most generously
presented these two birds to the Trust. The collection has therefore
been enriched by three wild-caught Mikados which, with any luck,
should greatly increase our chances of saving this exceptionally rare
species which is in grave danger of extinction in the wild. Your Council
is most grateful to Mr. Swain for his kindness.
Drs. Dien Zuh-Ming and Liu Yen have been made Hon. Members
of the Trust in recognition of their co-operation and help.
The Trust was able to help Mr. Newton Steel to import two more
female Mikado pheasants from a dealer in Taipei.
Our Member, Mr. J. Rawlings of Holt, Norfolk, imported some
Grey Francolin (. Francolinus afer swynnertoni) from S. Rhodesia and
presented one pair to the Trust, for which your Council is most grateful.

It will be observed no eggs were laid by Edwards's Pheasants
(.Lophura edwardsi ) or Brown Crossoptilon ( Crossoptilon mantchuricum )
and very few by the Temminck's Tragopan ( Tragopan temmincki).
These are all old birds from the original Leckford collection and they
must now be considered too old to be of any further use as breeding
stock. This is all the more regrettable when it is remembered that
none of these species has, as far as is known, been bred outside the
Trust's collection this year. Unless fresh importations of these birds
can soon be made they will doubtless quickly become extinct as captive
species in this country.
One male Edwards's was bred by Mr. F. E. B. Johnson from a pair
of the Trust's birds in his care.
For the second year running three Cabot's Tragopan ( Tragopan
cahoti ) were reared from the original pair sent by Dr. K. C. SearJe and
once again all appear to be hens.
Eleven young Common Koklass ( Pucrasia m. macrolopha ) were
reared, two males and nine females, thus bringing the number of pairs
in the collection to five.
Three young Tonkinese Red Junglefowl ( Gallus g. jabouillei ) were
reared from the wild-caught birds imported from China.

Once again infertility continues to be the greatest single problem in
building up a captive stock of any species. Continuous in-breeding over
many generations is no doubt the cause in the majority of cases, but
other factors must not be overlooked. For example, the wild caught pair
of unrelated Cabot's Tragopan produced four eggs in their first clutch,
all of which hatched. Their second clutch of three eggs were all infertile.
The wild-caught Red Junglefowl laid four clutches, but only the first
and third contained any fertile eggs. It would seem possible that in
these cases the male was starting to lose breeding condition soon after
the first clutch had been laid.
Some forty Californian Crested Quail (. Lophortyx c. californica) and
a number of Bobwhite Quail ( Colinus virginianus) have been reared.
Two species new to the collection have recently been received in
exchange from Mr. F. E. B. Johnson, these are a pair of Hume's Bar-
tailed Pheasant ( Syrmaticus h. humiae) and a pair of Sonnerat's Jungle-
fowl ( Gallus sonnerati). As described elsewhere in this report Mr.
Johnson has successfully bred Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasant for the first
time in this country and your Council is pleased to congratulate him.
Mr. Johnson has donated one pair of Swinhoe's pheasant to be
included in the shipment for Formosa and Mr. J. Rawlings has donated
three young Blue Crossoptilons. Their generosity is greatly appreciated.
The Trust's collection now consists of 378 birds, of forty-nine forms,

NOTES ON WING DISPLAY IN THE
COURTSHIP OF PHEASANTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998499256410256" page_id="56350047"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
By J. P. Kruijt (Zoological Laboratory, Groningen, Netherlands)
Considering the courtship of Junglefowl, Beebe wrote as follows in
his Monograph of the Pheasants : " The assertion has often been
made and with some truth that some of the courtship attitudes are
similar to those assumed in fighting. . . . This statement is now quoted
and repeated in the most sweeping manner by every dilettante writer
on birds. . . . The lateral display of Junglefowl has nothing to do with
the fighting position of birds, which is essentially frontal. Even when
two cocks are approaching one another and circling for an opening,
the resemblance between the two motor phenomena is extremely
remote."
Despite this strong denial, the idea of similarity between fighting
and courtship patterns has continued to appear, and has now become
firmly established. During the past ten years, Tinbergen and other
ethologists have shown convincingly that in courting animals tendencies
to attack, to flee, and to behave sexually are aroused simultaneously
by the presence and activities of the partner. The animal cannot
completely obey these tendencies all at the same time, because the
motor patterns belonging to these tendencies are often partly or entirely
incompatible. One of the ways in which courting animals solve their
conflicts is to compromise : they show a little of the one and a little
of the other tendency, so that in the end they do something in
between.
The principle of compromise has proved to be extremely valuable
for the understanding of courtship patterns even to such an extent
that the remote resemblances mentioned by Beebe become meaningful
and can no longer be ignored. In studying the courtship of Burmese
Red Junglefowl (Gallus g. spadiceus ) I came to the conclusion that it is
applicable to this species also.
The cock which takes the initiative in a fight with another cock
approaches the opponent with his body kept high and erect (Fig. iA)
and while jumping up at him, he flaps his wings vigorously (Fig. iB).
The loser of the fight runs away with his body kept low and flat, and
his wings folded (Fig. iA). Now when the two cocks are well matched,
attack and escape are both aroused in each cock and the two tendencies
keep each other in balance. In such a situation side display occurs
(Fig. iG). A cock in side display neither approaches, nor withdraws.
He does something in between and circles around the opponent.
While walking, the legs are often crossed : the nearest leg walks away

and the leg on the far side walks toward the opponent. The body-
posture is oblique : the near side is held low as if the bird was fleeing
and the far side is held high as if the bird was approaching to attack.
All these components can be understood as compromises between
attack and escape : the tendency to escape is expressed in the body-half
nearest the opponent and the tendency to attack in the body-half
further away.
Side display begins to be shown during fighting when the cockerels
are two months old. At this age, side display is sometimes continued
during a fight into a full waltzing or wing-flutter performance (Fig. iD).
This consists of close circling in side display, with a peculiar movement
of the far wing superimposed. The far wing is kept tight against the
body, but the hand of the wing is extended downward, so that the
primaries are spread and touch the ground. The foot of that side
steps through the extended primaries, producing a rasping sound.
This movement (although I can not give the full arguments here) can
again be understood as a compromise between attack and escape :
upper and lower arm of the outer wing remain folded (as in escaping
birds) and the hand is spread (as in the wing-flapping of attacking
birds). All three parts remain folded in the nearest wing, which is
consistent with the stronger escape expressed in this body-half.
Cockerels of two months old may also show incomplete attempts to
copulate with other chicks. Side display and waltzing are never
associated with this sexual behaviour ; they occur exclusively during
fighting at this stage. With later age, side display and waltzing
disappear to a great extent from the fighting context ; they are then
mainly used in the courtship of the cock toward the female. The
relations between courtship and fighting are then remote indeed, and it
is very understandable that Beebe, who did not know the develop-
mental history of these displays, denied a connexion.
Waltzing in adult Junglefowl functions as a signal during courtship.
The oblique attitude of the cock results in a conspicuous display of
the bright neck and saddle feathers. By his sudden circling and the
rasping sound produced by the movements of the far leg through the
lowered primaries, the cock stimulates the hen to crouch, after which
copulation may follow.
In looking at the courtship of other pheasants, one finds that wing
display is present in many species, but the form of it is often strikingly
different. In most species it seems to function as a signal during
courtship but, parallel to the differences in form, this effect is often
achieved in different ways. I will give a few examples of wing display
in other species.

Elliot's Pheasant (Syrmaticus ellioti) : Fig. 2A.
The position of both wings in the lateral display of this species is
strongly asymmetric. This is partly a result of the tilted back, but even
if this factor is subtracted, the upper and lower arm of the far wing
appear to be raised more than the corresponding parts of the nearest
wing. I think that this is often so in Pheasants with asymmetric wing
display, even when the primaries of either inner or outer wing are
spread. It is also true, for example, of Junglefowl. In the Elliot's
Pheasant, the white markings of the wings are beautifully emphasized
by their position during display : it therefore seems probable that the
display acts as a visual signal.

Golden Pheasant [Chrysolophus pictus) : Fig. 2B
The well known lateral display of this species depends mainly on
the neck ruff, which is fanned out at the side of the female, but the
wings also play their part in producing a highly conspicuous visual
effect. The cock hops and runs around the female and the final
display is adopted for only a second or so. During this brief moment
the wings are brought in an asymmetrical position, essentially similar
to that of Elliot's Pheasant. Here, however, the movement does not
serve to emphasize structures on the wing itself, but lifting of the outer
wing has the effect that the elongated, golden-coloured feathers of
the back are pushed upward, permitting the female on the other side
a full view. The climax of this display (see arrow in Fig. 2B) is syn-
chronized with vocal hissing.

In this species the folded wings are again held asymmetrically
during courtship. Side display may be adopted while the male is
several metres from the female. He then suddenly hops sideways
towards her and while hopping, the folded far wing is tilted upward,
probably by a turning movement of the upper and lower arm. The
visible surface of the cock as seen from the side is considerably increased
by the position of the wings ; this probably makes the display potent
as a visual signal.

Here the wing display is very similar to that of the Junglefowl, but
instead of the outer, the inner wing is lowered. I have seen this display,

but at the time I was not yet aware of the importance of details. The
drawing of Taber also does not permit detailed description, but it
seems clear that the main movement is an extension of the primaries.
The display probably acts as a visual signal, and again, the movement
is accompanied with vocal hissing.
Painted Quail (Excalfactoria chinensis) : Fig. 2E
The outer wing is lowered during courtship of this species. The
posture differs from waltzing of Junglefowl, however, in that not only
the hand, but also the lower arm is completely extended. As a result,
the wing is extended more backward than downward, and no sound-
producing contact between the outer leg and wing is made. It is
puzzling how this display could act as a signal : no conspicuous visual
effect is produced either.
Another aspect of the display of Painted Quail is equally puzzling.
Whereas in most Pheasants the body-half nearest the partner is kept
lowest during display, the reverse is true in Painted Quail. Thus, it
appears that some species incline their body toward and others away
from the partner and which of the two occurs is not related in a simple
way with the side where parts of the wing are extended.
Many other examples could be given and although the published
accounts of courtship in Pheasants often do not go into great detail,
one gets the impression that the variety is very large. Every attitude

that the wings are mechanically capable of assuming seems to be
realized in one species or another, especially when the comparison is
extended to Gallinaceous birds not belonging to the Pheasants.
Moreover, wing display occurs commonly in the courtship of birds
in general.
I think it likely that in several of the examples shown, the wing
display originated in the same way as in Junglefowl, as the result of a
conflict between wing-folding and wing-flapping. In some species,
the tendency to fold the wings predominates during the display and
the tendency to unfold them, expresses itself at most in a slight, often
asymmetric, shifting of the position of the wing-bones of both wings.
In other species, parts of one or both wings may be raised or lowered
to a greater extent. The result is that the forms of wing display differ
greatly from species to species, but many of them could, in principle
at least, be due to the same sort of conflict occurring in Junglefowl.
It must be concluded that, if this is the case, each species has solved
this conflict in its own, more or less unique way.
It is of course quite possible that in some species the origin of wing
display is different. For example, in some species the wing display
may be derived from balancing movements, necessary to compensate
for imminent loss of equilibrium when the bird assumes an oblique
posture. Detailed study of each species and of the differences between
species will be necessary to find out this. Such detailed studies will
probably only be made by ethologists, who are trained in analysing

behaviour, have the opportunity to devote their time to this task, and
can profit from the facilities of a research institute.
However, before these people can start with the analysis, it is
necessary to have a good descriptive inventory of the behaviour. This
is a point where I believe aviculturists could contribute in many
important ways. As far as Pheasants are concerned, a good deal of the
courtship is already known, but many of the published descriptions
are of little use to the ethologist. Vague descriptions like bobbing or
waggling of the head and dragging or drooping of the wings are too
ambiguous to have any significance for meaningful comparison of
differences between species.
I would like to give one or two suggestions which might lead to
improvement in this matter. First of all, the observer who is interested
in describing behaviour should try to get an analytical eye. For
example, in describing movements of wings, he should remember that a
bird has two wings and both do not always behave in the same way.
He should also realize that a wing is not just an unstructured bone with
attached muscles, skin, and feathers. He should be aware while
observing that the wing consists of three parts and a good description
should take this into account. If this is kept in mind, the observer will
realize that the statement : " the wing is lowered 55 is not satisfactory,
if in fact the primaries only were spread.
Second, it is important to make notes immediately while one is
observing. I have experienced that any record I make in retrospect is
likely to be a distortion of what really happened. Probably other
people have been victims of the same human weakness : I know of at
least three authors (and they were trained scientists !), who described
that waltzing of the domestic cock involves lowering of the wing
turned toward the female. Such gross mistakes are avoided if one records
the behaviour while observing it, either verbally or in drawing, or
better still, with photographs and film. Especially the latter techniques
are often very useful because many of the rituals of courtship are too
complicated and occur too rapidly to be caught correctly with the
naked eye.
Of course one can think of many refinements in describing the
details of behaviour patterns, such as measuring speed, frequency, or
amplitude of movements. Eventually, when our knowledge proceeds,
such refinements will be necessary and the work involved in describing
the behaviour will then move more and more out of reach of the
aviculturist and become the task of the ethologist. At present, however,
our descriptions are still not very sophisticated and every keen observer
can make new discoveries. The clear descriptions by D. Goodwin,
appearing in this Magazine, are good examples of the kind we need
for many more species of birds.

(.Francolinus francolinus)
ByJ. J. Yealland (London, England)
The Black Partridge, Black Francolin or Common Francolin ranges
from Cyprus to the hills of Manipur, seven races being recognized.
It is said to have lived as far westward as southern Spain as well as
other parts of the Mediterranean area, but it has long since vanished
from there except for the island of Cyprus where, so Dr. and Mrs.
Bannerman [Birds of Cyprus , 1958) were told, " the francolin is now
making an excellent recovery both in the Paphos reserve and in the
Karpas."
Hume and Marshall (Game Birds of India, Burmah and Ceylon , 1879, ii)
wrote at length about this bird, but largely about the shooting of it,
for it offered " pretty sport " and in places where it was then still
abundant " fifty brace may still be bagged in a single day by a single
sportsman ". It is, they say, to be found " not only in the plains and
lesser chains of hills, but in all the lower outer ranges of the Himalayas,
and in the river valleys running far into these, up to elevations, at
any rate in summer, of from 5,000 to 7,000 feet". Further westward
it was said to be common " in the tamarisk jungles and reed beds of
Mesopotamia ".
The call of the Black Francolin is a familiar sound in the places where
it is at all common. It is said to live in pairs, only being in coveys
(presumably in family parties) at the end of the breeding season and
then only for a short time.
Various small animal life such as beetles, spiders, termites, snails,
insect life, and larvae, together with seeds, small fruits, and tender
shoots of plants form the diet. The breeding season of the Indian birds
is said by Jerdon to be from May to July, ten or twelve eggs being the
usual clutch. These appear to be variable in colour, greenish-white,
bluish-white, pale olive-green, pale fawn, and chocolate being the
colours recorded. Albinos and albinistic specimens were " not very
uncommon " and Hume and Marshall report the occurrence of
hybrids between this and Francolinus pictus , the Southern or Painted
Francolin.
The first recorded breeding in captivity in this country was pub-
lished in the Avicultural Magazine (New Series, vol. vi, 1908)
and the Society's medal was presented to the breeder, Mr. C. Barnby
Smith, during the following year, though why this was done is not clear,
for the hen Francolin, after laying four eggs, took no further interest
in them, and they were incubated and the chicks reared entirely
by a bantam.

BREEDING HUME'S BAR-TAILED PHEASANT

By F. E. B. Johnson (Bedford, England)
The pheasants of the genus Syrmaticus have always been popular
because of their long tails and similarity in shape to the game
pheasants which they combine with bold markings and distinctive
patterns.
In view of this it is strange that the Bar-tailed Pheasant, Syrmati-
cus humiae , has not been established in captivity in the Western
Hemisphere.
The species is divided into two subspecies : Hume's Bar-tailed
Pheasant, Syrmaticus humiae humiae , occurring in the Naga Hills and in
that part of northern Burma lying west of the Irrawaddy ; and the
Burmese Bar-tailed Pheasant, S. h. burmanicus, found in south-western
Yunnan and Northern Burma.
For a full description I would refer readers to Delacour's The
Pheasants of the World , pp. 213, 214. Briefly, Hume's Pheasant is
similar to Elliot's Pheasant but with the following differences : in the
male Hume's the underparts are rich brown, not white ; the brown
of the upper parts is rich plum-mahogany, not chestnut as in Elliot's,
and the blue-black of the upper parts is steel blue in Hume's. The
throat and neck of the cock Hume's are black. The tail is barred
dark grey and rich brown and black. The feathers of the neck have
a metallic subterminal patch as in the Mikado.
In general appearance the cock, in particular, seems to be pro-
portionately much broader across the shoulders than Elliot's and both
sexes fan their tails more frequently. These birds are quite as hardy
as the other species in the genus.
My pairs of Hume's are housed in the same type of aviaries as the
Elliot's Pheasants and these conditions seem to suit the birds as, on
29th April, I found a broken egg under one of the perches in the
morning. On the same day the hen of this pair made a scraping in
the back of the small shelter. She then laid two more eggs, on 1st May
and 3rd May. These eggs were placed under a bantam but proved
infertile.
From 5th May to 18th May she laid seven more eggs which were
placed under a bantam on 18th May. On 14th June two Hume's
chicks hatched ; the remaining five eggs were infertile. This hen
continued to lay and five more eggs were placed under a bantam on
28th May. From these eggs four chicks hatched on 24th June.
The incubation period is, therefore, twenty-seven days as in the
Mikado Pheasant, S. mikado , and not twenty-five days as with Elliot's
Pheasant, S. ellioti.
The chicks were very similar to Elliot's Cl have never seen Mikado

chicks) but were extremely wild and lively ; in fact, when put into
a coop and run with their foster mother they persisted for some
minutes in banging themselves on the wire-netting of the run and
I had great difficulty in persuading them to go under the bantam.
Eventually they did so, however, and I am pleased to be able to say
that from then on they proved quite easy to rear on a diet of " Turkey
Starter " crumbs but with a liberal supply of mealworms. They grew
a little more slowly than Elliot's but the cocks were in adult plumage
by the age of about five months. They therefore take the adult
plumage in the first year.
One point of interest should be mentioned : although the chicks
were so wild when young they gradually gained confidence in their
surroundings and are now much tamer than my young Elliot's of
approximately the same age.
In conclusion, Hume's Pheasant is a striking and beautiful bird,
quite as beautiful as either of its near relations, Elliot's Pheasant and
the Mikado Pheasant. It is somewhat intermediate in appearance
between these other two species but can easily be distinguished from
hybrids between them.
It is hoped that many pheasant enthusiasts will take up the species
so that it may at last become established in our aviaries.

By F. E. B. Johnson (Bedford, England)
Since very early times the Golden Pheasant has been a favourite
with aviculturists and has been common in captivity in Europe since
the eighteenth century. It is probably more numerous in captivity
than in the wild.
Most birds that have been bred in captivity for many generations
tend to give rise to mutations or colour variations. It is therefore not
surprising that two striking mutations have arisen in the case of the
Golden Pheasant [Chrysolophus pictus).
Before I describe these mutations I feel that a word should be said
on the subject in general as it applies to aviculture. A number of
aviculturists condemn in the same breath all hybrids and mutations.
While hybridizing between two species is only excusable under very
special circumstances, mutations are entirely a product of nature and
have as much right to be admired and preserved as the original
species. The fact that many of them can only be preserved in
captivity and would die out in the wild makes them not a whit the less
interesting.

The first Golden Pheasant mutation to appear was the form known
as the dark-throated or black-throated Golden Pheasant ( Chrysolophus
pictus mut. ohscurus ). It occurred in Amsterdam Zoo some time before
the year 1928. It corresponds to the much more familiar " Melanistic
Mutant " ( Phasianus colchicus mut. tenebrosus ) of the game pheasant.
The close parallel is easily shown by the colour of the newly-hatched
chicks which are dark chocolate brown with whitish markings about
the head and underparts in the above forms of both species.
The main differences between the dark-throated and normal Golden
Pheasant are as follows : adult male dark-throated :--

(1) The throat and upper breast are black or blackish.
(2) The central rectrices are barred with alternate bars of black and
dark olive brown as are the outer rectrices. It should be noted,
however, that the barring is not of the same type as in the tail of the
Amherst Pheasant.
(3) The whole of the remainder of the plumage is slightly darker in

shade throughout.
In the hen the whole colour is dark chocolate brown but with the
usual markings of the normal hen.
The yellow Golden Pheasant ( Chrysolophus pictus mut. luteus) is of
more recent occurrence ; the present world stock having been
multiplied by Professor Ghigi from a bird obtained by him from
Eastern Europe.
The yellow Golden is a striking and beautiful bird and can be
considered a " dilute 55 of the normal colour. In the adult male all
the parts that are normally bright red are bright yellow. The crest
is yellow. The ruff and green feathers of the mantle are as in the
normal golden pheasant but slightly paler in shade. The blue bars of
the wings are dull purplish-brown. The central pair of rectrices are
spotted as in the normal Golden Pheasant but the spots are cream
and the ground colour is fawn. The hen is cream in colour with fawn
markings as is the first-year male but the latter has a yellow cast about
the face and throat.
As is often the case when a new mutation or aberration occurs,
suggestions are put forward that the colour changes are due to
hybridization. In the two cases mentioned above there seems to be
no evidence that any crossing with the Amherst Pheasant has given
rise to these colour changes. The strain of dark-throated Goldens that
exists in this country at the present time appears to be particularly
pure. These birds are very small (as all good Golden Pheasants should
be) and, when mated to normal Goldens of good appearance, the
resultant male progeny (not dark-throated but carrying the factor in
recessive form) have tails which are regularly and finely spotted.

throated or normal in appearance and the former have the correctly

In the yellow Golden, specimens do not occur with part red, part
yellow breasts and when these occur among normal Goldens they are
usually an indication of impurity.
It is to be hoped that others will breed these interesting birds ;
possibly to be rewarded one day by the appearance of an even more
beautiful further stage in either mutation.

(Turacus corythaix)
Claude M. Payne (Barford, Warwickshire, England)
Touracos are restricted to Africa and there are about twenty species
of which four, including the Knysna, are found in South Africa where
they are known as Louries. The Knysna Touraco occurs only in the
lush evergreen forests of Knysna eastwards to Natal. The head, neck
and breast, are green of an iridescent quality, there is a white line under
the eye, the back wings and tail are iridescent green with blue reflec-
tions, the crest is rounded tipped with white, the scapulars, wing-
coverts and innermost secondaries are violet, blue and green, the
greater part of the flight-feathers are crimson with the edges dark blue,
the eye brown, the bare skin round the eye red, bill orange-red, and
feet and toes black. Sexes are alike. The juvenile plumage is similar
to the adult, but much duller, and there are no white tips to the crest.
The bill is dull brown and the skin round the eye dusky. The crimson
in the wings contains turacin a copper-based pigment, said to be
soluble in water, a fact, if such it is, which I have failed to prove,
although many feathers have been immersed in water and in various
solutions. Is it a scientific fact or an oft repeated, and thereby semi-
fairy tale ?
During the late summer of 1959 ,1 believe a few pairs of this beautiful
Touraco were to be seen in dealers' shops in England. There is, I under-
stand, a very interesting story as to how the birds were caught and sent
here, notwithstanding the heavy penalties imposed on trappers. How-
ever, the story, interesting as it may be, does not entitle it to a place
in this magazine. But what does concern the Society is that in 1959
I saw a number of birds for sale, and being all together in a large cage,
made a truly wonderful sight. The only Touracos I have possessed
were a pair of Hartlaub's which are considerably smaller than the
majestic Knysnas. I had found the Hartlaub's easy to feed, house and
manage, so the desire to possess a pair of Knysnas was not readily

quelled. I looked long and hard at the birds who eyed me back in
their inimitable fashion ; perhaps who knows, weighing me up in
much the same way as I was weighing up my chances of choosing a pair.
Touracos have tremendously powerful feet and legs, and propel
themselves through the air from perch to perch by strong muscular
leg action, helped by one wing beat half-way between the two perches.
They also have the habit of running rather than hopping along a
branch. The feet are zygodactylous, that is to say, they can place two
claws each side of a branch, or three forward and one to the rear, and
so obtain considerable grip and purchase for their flying leaps.
They are by nature active birds, particularly in the mornings and
early evenings, when the male bird, I believe the male only, makes the
characteristic noise from which the word Touraco is derived, i.e. " Cou
Cou Cou 55 repeated in the same key many times over. I am travelling
on with my tale a little too fast perhaps, but two birds, which I hoped
would be a pair, were duly deposited in one of my planted aviaries
containing a tangle of vegetation growing through stout branches of
hazel-nut and apple tree. The aviary is one of a group built round a
wooden shelter and divided into six compartments. Incidentally as
two other flights in the group have already had their moment of fame,
having been the birth-place of two other first breedings, one can only
surmise that something in the make-up of this aviary has an influence
on the virility of the inmates.
The shelter for the compartment in which the Touracos were placed
is 4 feet square and the flight about 15 by 10 feet. The birds did very
well in their new surroundings, feeding freely on bananas, grapes, pears
and any other fruit as became available, including mulberries.
They were in such good condition and feather that I decided to
leave them out for the winter, as it turned out with no ill effects, in
fact, the birds came through in absolutely wonderful fettle, and the
early Spring dawns were heralded by the not unmusical sonorous call.
At this time I had no thoughts of breeding, but as each Spring arrives
my hopes rise, that I may once again be successful with one or other of
the pairs which have not been bred before. However, my hopes, such
as they were, were soon dispersed--one Touraco killed the other. The
dead bird was found with its head broken open. It was fairly obvious
that I had chosen two cock birds.
I thought there was little chance of obtaining another bird, particu-
larly a hen, and for the summer, or at least until the August, the
surviving cock bird had other birds for companions.
In August, however, I saw an advertisement offering a Knysna
Touraco for sale by my good friend Alan Griffiths, who very kindly let
me have the bird although neither he nor I had any idea of its sex.
I was afraid to put the two birds together until the new arrival had
settled down, and therefore gave it a somewhat smaller aviary adjoining

that of the other Touraco, where the birds could see each other and
pass such pleasantries as Touracos are wont to do. So things remained
until the Spring of 1961 when on one rather pleasant quiet day I took
the plunge and placed the Griffiths bird in the aviary with the cock, prior
to this removing all the other inmates. Imagine my delight and satis-
faction when immediately the old bird " cou ", " coued " for a short
spell and then fed the new-comer by regurgitation. I felt that this time
I had a true pair.
As days passed and the power of the Spring sun increased, so did the
cry of the Touracos. Then at the highest point in the shelter I put up
a contraption, made of thin saplings and the last-year runners from
the Russian Vine made to resemble an open nest, and into this
saucer-like shape I put a handful of straw and rootlets. Some weeks
went by and the noise became more constant and prolonged until at
last my bird-man, Mr. Beck, reported that when he was feeding the
birds in the aviary he had seen a bird leave the nest.
After this I made a habit of examining the nest at frequent intervals
until one morning in May a white egg was seen through the rather
sparse covering of the twigs which formed the base of the man-made
nest. Not daring to interfere or remove the egg for examination, I left
the birds alone for a week, after which I explored the nest again,
hoping to find at least one other egg. But, alas, there was none, and
search as one would, no shell or any indication that there had been an
egg was to be found.
This ended the breeding attempts for 1961, although the birds
maintained a very close companionship and the cock continued to call,
but again only in the mornings and evenings during the Summer. As
in the Winter of 1960-61 so in the Winter of 1961-62 the birds were
left in the aviary open to all weathers and without heat. And so to
the Spring of 1962 when hopes of a successful first breeding ran high,
as both birds had come through the severe weather which we experi-
enced in late December and early January in first-rate
condition.
This year instead of the pseudo-nest in the shelter, I constructed,
with the aid of wire netting and some evergreens a very passable nest
in the corner of the flight near the top of the aviary. I was elated
when, almost before I had closed the aviary door behind me, one bird
scrambled along the branches and peered into the clump of evergreens,
and later that day was seen actually inside and settling in the depression
in the wire in which I had placed some twigs and dried grass.
Both birds showed great interest in the nest, and after about three
weeks the first egg was seen. From this time on the hen bird only left
the nest during the day for a minute or so, about 4.30 in the afternoon,
although she may well have done so early in the mornings. I thought
on one or two occasions that the cock bird was doing his share of the

The hen, or the cock, if indeed he did help with the incubating, sat
so close that I never knew if more than one egg was laid. Some four
weeks after the incubation began, Mr. Beck gave me the glad news that
a young one had hatched. It seems he was walking in the garden and
happened to pass the aviary and saw the hen bird was off the nest.
Peering through the branches he saw a dark object which moved, and
wisely he retired quickly and left the birds alone. I saw the young
bird myself on the following day and at a guess it was about seven days
old. It was covered in a dark brown, almost black, fluff, and its eyes
were open. The hen bird brooded continually and only left the nest
to feed, and then only for a few moments, until the young one was about
three weeks old, when I was able to observe the growth and develop-
ment. At this time the crest was beginning to form and if I got too close
the young bird hissed and struck out as if to defend itself.
One month after hatching I found the youngster still in the nest,
but cold. Obviously the hen had deserted, so I brought the young one
into the hospital cage at about 8o* F. and it soon recovered. It was then
noticed that it could not stand, as one leg was thrust forward at an
angle. Perhaps that is why the hen deserted ; because of this deformity
the young one could not leave the nest. It was a very large if somewhat
ugly baby.
I attempted to hand-rear the bird but without success. As I was
going on holiday that day, I took the bird with me and fed it at fre-
quent intervals during the journey, but either the food--banana and
crushed grape--was too cold, or the car journey too rough, for it
brought back most of the food and although it appeared to pick up
during the evening, it was dead next morning.
Some three weeks after the hen deserted the first young one, she again
sat on the nest and the cock bird spent most of his time close by, fre-
quently calling. A day or so later, on 28th July, 1962, the first egg was
seen, and two days later there were two. The eggs resembled table-
tennis balls, being roughly that size, pure white, and without gloss,
perhaps not quite so round but not noticeably oval either.
The hen sat steadily until 20th August, 1962, when a young one
was seen. Two days later two young were seen, their eyes wide open
with their heads through their mother's wing as one often sees chickens.
They appeared strong and healthy so my hopes rose for a success this
time. The old birds were being fed the usual mixture of cut fruit,
particularly banana, and I then gave them a pot of a proprietary soft-
bill food which they seemed to like, so much so that large quantities
of the soft food were consumed. This pattern of feeding continued for
about fourteen days when a return was made to the fruit. The young
at this time were showing distinct quill and tail feathers, although
very few feathers appeared on the body. The general feathering pattern

did not appear to follow as both wings and tail grew without any
attendant increase in the body feathers. The birds continued to thrive,
until they were about one month old when one young one was found
dead in the nest. It was quite flattened, and it was therefore
impossible to say whether death was due to a lack of food.
The following day the remaining young one left the nest, and the
hen was seen brooding the bird during the late evening on a low branch.
The next day the young bird spent most of its time on the ground.
The old birds were very excited and from observations which were then
made they were seen to visit the young one every few minutes. No
feeding took place so far as it was possible to ascertain, during the short
time in which the birds were closely observed.
Unfortunately on the following afternoon the weather turned cold
and we had a very heavy downpour of rain. The hen was seen brooding
the young bird but, nevertheless, after the storm it was found in a dis-
tressed condition on the aviary floor. Drastic action had to be taken,
and the young bird was brought into the hospital cage with consider-
able heat. It was a very bedraggled object, just a few feathers among
the fluff on the body and the rain sodden tail and wings, but after a
time it perked up and became quite lively. A few drops of brandy
were given and this no doubt helped to ward off a chill. A mixture
of sponge cake and milk was prepared and fed very hot to the bird,
it lunged at the spoon and removed the food. A pot of cut bananas
and grapes was placed in the cage and it was not long before it decided
to help itself. It had a voracious appetite, and a tremendous gape.
For safety's sake it was left in the hospital cage for about seven days
and then placed in the birdroom in much less heat where it continued
to make progress.
At the time of writing, although now covered in feathers it still is
only a shadow of what I hope it will become after its first moult.
As described, Claude M. Payne has bred the Knysna Touraco
Turacus corythaix. It is believed this may be a first success. Any member
or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once with

(Compsocoma somptuosa)
Habitat--The Andes of Ecuador and Columbia
W. D. Cummings (Keston, Kent, England)
Eighteen months ago at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm we were
offered four Blue-shouldered Mountain Tanagers from a well-known
importer, and though a little sceptical over the ability to keep tanagers.
in our outdoor planted aviaries all the year we decided to try these.
We thought they would be hardier and stand up to outdoor conditions
better than the smaller tanagers, which generally speaking, thrive
better under conservatory conditions.
We put them in one of a range of planted flights with access to a
shelter which is heated in the winter. The four were shut in the shelter
to begin with, for they were in importation plumage and not acclima-
tized. Three of the tanagers had pale yellow breasts and the other, the
fittest of them, was a bright buttercup colour. One had a swollen foot
and they were all a little puffed-up. We had received them in the
month of October which is not the best month to acclimatize newly
imported birds, but we need not have worried for, with very little heat,
plenty of exercise and bathing facilities, and a varied diet, they very
soon picked up and needed no extra attention.
They varied quite a bit in size and it was not at all easy to distinguish
the sexes. They are identical in colour but the hen seemed to have a
finer head and beak and the flat yellow patch on top of the head is
narrower in the hens. They are a little larger than the Amethyst
Starling and one about the size of our English Thrush. They are pre-
dominantly yellow, with blue shoulders and black flights, with broad
blue and black through the eye. Now they are all a brilliant buttercup
yellow and have the sleek tanager shape--they are really beautiful
birds.
Apart from their colouring, they are extremely confiding in nature
and altogether make extremely attractive aviary inmates. One thing,
however, is that when they are fit one has to be careful which other
species of birds one mixes with them for they do tend to be aggressive.
We have mixed an odd Blue-shoulder out of the breeding season with
Rock Thrushes and Amethyst Starlings and we had no trouble apart
from the normal amount of disagreements.
We feed them with the usual insectivorous mixture and they eat
this freely and since it is moistened with carrot juice we think this is the
reason we keep the depth of yellow on their bodies. Apart from this,
their diet consists of a few mealworms and gentles, chopped dates,

soaked currants, chopped grapes and slices of pear and apple, and this
is supplemented by blackberries and elderberries in the autumn. They
seem to like a mixed fruit diet and sample a bit of everything.
We kept the four birds together all winter and throughout the
following year, for we were not sure of their sexes and anyway they
appeared to agree perfectly. Towards that autumn one bird started
to build a nest in a thick macracarpa fir in the flight, but it was dis-
couraged from continuing when we started shutting them in the shelter
as the nights got cold. The nest was open and cup-shaped, well made
and tight fitting, made mainly with coarse grass and fibrous roots. They
passed the winter without any ill effects and the temperature of the
shelter was kept just above freezing.
The following Spring, 1962, there seemed to be a considerable
amount of activity---following each other up and down the flight--but
it was not easy to say who was doing what, for we could not tell them
apart. The original brightly coloured bird was distinguishable as an
obvious cock and it seemed to be following two others up and down ;
so we presumed there were two cocks and a hen--and the fourth a
rather disinterested spectator, another hen. However, before we could
decide how to split them into pairs we found one dead in the flight
and this proved to be the odd hen. So we now took a cock bird out
and left the smaller of the three with the brilliant cock. She quickly
built a second nest in the macracarpa fir and laid three eggs. They
were large, heavily speckled on a grey-blue background. At least two
young hatched and we could see how they were progressing for the
bush was growing very close to the shelter and, by standing in the
shelter and looking out through the entrance hole, we could see them
being fed. They appeared fully fledged in just over three weeks and we
anticipated a successful rearing, for both parents were extremely
attentive and excellent feeders. Then one morning, while we were
replenishing their live food, there appeared less activity than usual
and there was no sound coming from the bush, so we thought they had
left the nest. However, after a week, it was obvious the parents were
not eating as much live food as they ought, and they also ceased to make
their warning noises when one approached the aviary.
So the flight was searched and we found one fully fledged corpse in
the grass, identical in colour to the parents, only a paler yellow.
The pair then went into nest again and once more the process was
repeated, the youngsters disappearing when they ought to be fledging.
This took us into the middle of September and since we do not give
much hope to late breeding successes we did not think that there was
much likelihood of success this year. The hen decided otherwise, how-
ever, and before we could do anything about it we found she had laid
two more eggs in a fourth nest in the macracarpa. We could think of
no other way of avoiding the same results other than taking the cock

bird away, which we did, for we could lose nothing by it. We thought
he might be killing the young as they fledged for, since they are identical
in colouring, they could have been mistaken as rivals by an over
attentive parent. This was just the last thing we could think of and it
proved to be the case, although we have never actually seen him
attacking the young. The hen bird finished rearing the two young of
the third nest. She was an excellent little feeder and we need not have
worried on that score. Unfortunately, the second youngster left the
nest during a spell of light night frost and, although we shut the three
of them in the shelter at night, we could do nothing to save it. The other
surviving youngster is now independent and is a lovely, healthy bird
and we think a hen. A few deeper yellow feathers are already beginning
to show through the paler ones.
This will now give us two pairs of these lovely birds for our collection.

<bodyText confidence="0.96411725" page_id="56350068"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
Mitchell's Lorikeets are about 8 inches long with nigger brown head
faintly tinged with green. The bill is orange. The cock has a brilliant
red breast while the hen is slightly less brilliant with a tinge of yellow.
The red is succeeded by a very dark blue-black abdomen, followed by
yellow and green underneath. They have a pale green collar and the
cock has a blackish band of feathers and green back, rump and tail.
Underside of wings is red and yellow, wing tips black.
The birds were housed in a 10 feet long by 6 feet high by 2 ft. 6 in.
wide flight with no other occupants. Feeding and sleeping quarters
were in the adjacent bird room. The nest-box was hung in the outside
flight about 6 feet high and facing north. The box was io inches high
by 7 inches by 6 inches with a 2J inch entrance hole. A layer of small
pebbles was put in the bottom covered by a layer of peat moss and
rotten wood. Interest was shown in the nest-box about the beginning
of May and on 14th May two eggs were seen laid on top of the bare
pebbles. The birds had removed every trace of peat moss and wood.

Although the hen appeared to be in the nest-box most of the time, it
would come dashing out when anyone approached. Due to the
nervous disposition of the hen no inspection was made until 12 th June
when the nest still contained two eggs. The hen did not return to the
nest-box again so on 15th June the nest-box was opened again and the
eggs were found to be cold. One egg was clear and the other contained
a fully developed dead chick.
The birds were seen in the box again on 22nd June but were left
alone except for a quick look on 10th July when two eggs were seen.
Again the hen seemed to leave the nest on the slightest excuse, so no
inspection was made until 6th August. There was one chick and one
egg on that date. On 14th August both eggs had hatched but one
chick was much larger than the other. On 22nd August both chicks
were covered with grey down. On 14th September the larger of the
chicks appeared to be fully feathered, the other being only half
feathered. The older chick appeared at the nest-box entrance on
27th September, and on 30th September left the box fully feathered.
The parents were still visiting the nest but the second chick was found
to be dead on 7th October. The young one has the brilliant red chest
of the parents, but the head is very dark green and the bill is all black.
The rest of the plumage is the same as the adult pair. The birds are
fed twice a day with nectar, supplemented by canary seed, millet
sprays and gentles which they seem to enjoy. The young one is now
taking nectar from the bottle and the beak is gradually taking on a
lighter colour.
This year I have also bred two Jenday Conures, six Cockatiels,
four Nyasa lovebirds and five Fischer's Lovebirds but have not had
any success with my Australian Parrakeets.
As described, C. Smith has bred Mitchell's Lorikeet Trichoglossus
haematod mitchellii. It is believed that this may be a first success.

Ara chloroptera
By J. S. Rigge (Millom, Cumberland, England)
This pair of Macaws were purchased by me on 7th August, 1956, and
judging by the very light eye were obviously fully adult at the time.
They were put in an aviary measuring 17 by 8 by 6 feet high which
was only made of 18 gauge ^-in. mesh wire netting on a 2 by 2 inch
wood frame ; an aviary not really considered strong enough for
Macaws, but as usually happens, the only one available at the time.
It would not have kept either my Illigers or Blue and Gold Macaws
under control for more than a few hours but, although it is now well
patched, this pair have been in it for six years.
In the Spring of 1958 a nest was provided in the form of a large oak
barrel butter-churn fixed horizontally on its stand. That year and in
1959 nothing happened, but on 16th May, i960, an egg appeared
without warning and two more followed. The hen sat perfectly until
27th June, when I decided to inspect as no sound of young had been
heard. The eggs were then found to be addled and were removed.
In 1961 the first egg was laid on 18th May and a second one followed
about two days later. Again the hen sat perfectly, hardly ever being
seen off the nest. On 22nd June I decided to investigate and found
two dead, newly-hatched young in a nest which was full of dust. The
hen having chewed up the damp rotten wood and her body warmth
had dried it to a very fine dust, this, I think, had asphyxiated the
young. Again my hopes were dashed for another year.
This year, 1962, I was determined to avoid the dusty state of the
nest so I cut a large damp peat sod (we have plenty of natural peat
around here) about 8 inches thick and large enough to cover the
bottom of the nest. On 18th April, an egg was laid, and I think this
was the only one. After letting the hen sit for five weeks I inspected the
nest and found the egg contained a fully formed dead chick and I
thought this would be the finish again for this year. However, the
hen never left the nest and after a week or two had passed, I presumed
she must have laid again and was incubating. On 7th July, a young
bird was heard to squeak and on 12th July, I first saw two young birds.
So as not to disturb the birds too much, I had arranged it so that I
could see what was going on in the nest without going in the aviary.
The parents were not too aggressive as long as you did not approach
the nest, but they sat on the entrance to it and I should not like to try
and move them.
For a fortnight I heard the young being fed as I passed the aviary,
then suddenly all was quiet and I had a feeling something had gone

wrong. But I could see them quite fit and strong so all was well, but
I never heard them make a sound again, I never knew anything so
quiet in the nest.
Feeding now became a problem as I tried everything I had heard of
being used to rear Parrots etc., but the hen positively refused to look
at anything except sunflower seed, a little hemp, and about five large
spinach beet leaves a day, but the young seemed to be growing fast
so I left it at that.
The hen started to leave the nest a bit when the young were five
weeks old and the red feathers were beginning to show on their heads.
Up till then she had tried to brood them all day even though she could
hardly cover them. I was glad to see her out for a bit as she had
hardly ever left the nest from 18th April till i oth August, and I thought
her health might suffer. The cock was seen in the nest feeding either
the hen or the young once or twice, but the pair were so secretive in
their goings-on that I wondered when anything ever happened.
They never appeared to be doing anything when I was about, and I
have never seen the cock feed the hen off the nest, but once when they
were unaware of my presence I did see mating taking place and this
seemed to be accomplished with the birds inclined towards each other
on the perch and not by the cock mounting the hen as in other birds.
The young appeared to be more or less perfectly feathered at nine
weeks of age, and at this time about i lb. of seed and five large spinach
beet leaves were being consumed by the family each day.
The first young one left the nest on 18th October, after 103 days and
the second one on 22nd October, four days later. They were almost
exact replicas of the parents in size and colour except for the shorter
tail, dark eye, and the lower half of the beak being only shaded with
grey and not jet black as in the parents. Also the one I consider to
be the male has the feathers on the nape tipped with yellowish olive
and in the female these are crimson as in the adults, but whether this
is a colour variation as in young Pennant's or a sexual difference I
should not like to say, but I feel certain they are a true pair as they
have the same beak variation as in the adults.
As described, J. S. Rigge has bred the Crimson Macaw Ara chlorop-
tera. It is believed that this may be a first success.

As a footnote to the breeding results already recorded in the Maga-
zine another Scaly-breasted Lorikeet has been reared, but both Lead-
beater's Cockatoo and King Parrakeets had eggs which failed to
hatch.
Although two King Penguin chicks were hatched both failed to
rear--in the first place due to the death of the male parent and in the
second case the young chick was killed by either a rat or a crow.
New arrivals include two Single-wattled Cassowaries, which are
young birds and the exact species has not yet been determined. At
present they are a golden-brown in colour, but will get a great deal
darker as they mature. Adult Cassowaries are extremely dangerous,
and cases have been known in New Guinea of their killing natives.
The inner toenail is very elongated and they have a powerful kick.
Our keepers have been warned !
Two Scarlet Ibises have been added to the collection. They are
immature, hand-reared birds, and still show a great deal of their
brown nestling feathers, though pink is beginning to show. It is hoped
that a large flight can be fitted out for the Ibises and also Bitterns,
Rails, and waders.
A young Occipital Blue Pie has been purchased, and as it has become
very friendly with our original bird, it is hoped that we now have a
true pair.
Presentations include a Kestrel, an Indian Hill Mynah, an English
Partridge, four Little Owls and an oiled-up immature Herring Gull.
This we have managed to clean up and it can now fly and is in good
fettle. Not so fortunate was a badly oiled Common Scoter drake which
only survived for twenty-four hours, although eating well.
A number of new enclosures and aviaries are in course of construction
or are planned. Three of these enclosures are situated opposite the
new Rhino House and should be completed shortly. The enclosures
will contain cranes and waterfowl. The largest enclosure is about an
acre-and-a-half, with a large reed-fringed pond. The other two are
rather smaller and each enclosure has a small pond in it. Roomy log-
cabin type sheds for winter quarters will be provided for each enclosure.
The frame of a very large flight has been erected near the Birds of
Prey aviary. This is 150 by 15 by 20 feet high. Exactly what will be
housed here has yet to be decided.
It is hoped in the near future to extend our Bird House into the area
now occupied by the breeding aviaries. These aviaries have now just
about reached the end of their useful life.
Last but by no means least, work on the new Tropical House has
commenced. This will be exciting enough to merit an article to itself

Among the birds received during the past two months are two species
new to the collection.
These are the Sickle-winged Guan, Chamaepetes unicolor and Hume's
Bar-tailed Pheasant, Syrmaticus humiae humiae.
The Sickle-winged Guan, a native of the highlands of Costa Rica
and western Panama, is so named because the first three primaries are
very curved and the width of barb much reduced or, towards the tip,
absent. One other species (C. goudotii) lives in northern South America.
Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasant inhabits the mountainous parts of
northern Burma westward of the Irrawaddy. A second race
(S. h. burmanicus) living eastward of the river in northern Burma,
south-western Yunnan and the Shan States.
Other arrivals of particular interest are two Fulvous Whistling
Ducks bred by Mr. J. O. D'eath and presented by him, a Panama
Curassow [firax r. rubra) presented by Mr. P. H. Hastings together with
the Guans already mentioned, a Black-casqued Hornbill ( Ceratogymna
atrata) and an African Golden Oriole. Two young Dial or Dhyal Birds
(or Magpie Robins) have been presented by Mr. I. S. Horabin who
bred them.

Dr. Karl Plath writes : " Since my retirement as Curator of Birds,
Chicago Zoological Park, in July, i960, I have had more time to
spend on my former avocation, painting birds. I have recently had
the honour of being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts
(London). When I first joined the Avicultural Society in 1924 I lived
in a part of Chicago where one could have a fairly large garden, and
it was there that I had in all about 400 species of birds. Later, after
becoming Curator of Birds at Brookfield, we moved to Oak Park
(adjoining Chicago) and had even more ground ; but the keeping of
any livestock in Oak Park is unlawful and so I had to give up my
prized collection. Most of it, however, went to Brookfield. Now we
only have ' Toto ', a Grey Parrot, which we had hand-reared.

Derek Goodwin was surprised that anyone should have thought
that his success in breeding the Blue-headed Waxbill was a " first ".
I was surprised that this should not prove to be the case. This waxbill
was apparently first imported by G. B. Chapman in May, 1927. It
was first bred by A. Decoux in France, in 1930 (see Avicult. Mag.,
1 93 1 , 37 )* A. R. Hynd reports that the late John Cranna was successful
in Scotland in 1933. In view of the fact that Cecil Webb brought
a number in 1934 it is possible that Cranna's success was really a year
or so later than that reported.
Derek Goodwin has bred others since, and writes : " They certainly
are not difficult to breed given a bit of care. I would have bred more
but for having to have all my birds flying together in one small room.
This, of course, results in a certain amount of nest-destruction and so on.
And one brood of four fine young Blue-heads, about ten days old, were
poisoned by wild mealworms which I foolishly gave the parents. All
the waxbills that ate them were ill (those that didn't were not) and
these four young died."

E. H. Hawke, Lourenco Marques, writes : "In May of this year,
Mr. Jack Scheepers, the well-known trapper and exporter of birds,
caught in the Maputa area of this territory a pair of Melbas, the cock
of which is coloured so unusually that one can be excused wondering
whether something new has been discovered in our bird life.
The hen seems identical with the hen of Pytilia melha but the facial
mask of the new bird is a very definite orange as opposed to the
scarlet of the male. No other difference, even of size, can be noted
except that the birds do not seem to display the same pugnacity one
usually expects from Melbas.
The pair were entrusted to my care and, very naturally, they were
caged separately in the hope that if they bred, the male issue would
provide some clue as to whether father was just a freak or not. In

July the birds went to nest and early in September four very fine
youngsters were perched. These are now quite independent and as
the parents are displaying a readiness to repeat their effort, I have
removed the young birds to another aviary where they remain
uncontaminated by any other members of the Melba family.
I am now anxiously awaiting the first moult to see how the young
males colour out and for the benefit of those of your readers who may
be interested in this unusual experience, I will report again later."

THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS. By Jean Dorst. Translated
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990256193548387" page_id="56350077"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
by Constance D. Sherman. Heinemann, London, 1962. Price
50s. net.
The periodical disappearance and return of birds has interested man
since the dawn of history and many legends and theories have been
invented in explanation. It is only comparatively recently, however,
that the fundamental causes of migration and some of the methods of
orientation have been discovered.
The author, for many years curator of birds and mammals at the
Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, has attempted to collect
the available information on the subject from earliest times down to
the results of present-day research. The study of migrations has been
greatly helped in recent times by the development of bird stations in
various parts of the world and also by the use of new and scientific
methods, such as bird ringing and radar, which are providing much
more accurate information than was possible by simple observation.
The book is divided into thirteen chapters, the first dealing with
old explanations of bird migration, followed by methods of studying
migrations. The migrations in Europe and North Asia ; in North
America, in the southern hemisphere, in intertropical regions, and in
sea-birds, respectively, are considered in separate chapters, followed
by Modes of Migration. Bird Invasions, Hibernation, Physiological
Stimuli and Orientation, and the Origin and Evolution of Migration.
Some idea of the literature on the subject may be gathered from the
bibliography which comprises fifty-two pages and contains only a
fraction of the articles and reports devoted to the subject.
This is the most comprehensive study of bird migration ever
published and is likely to appeal to both amateur ornithologists and
experts in the subject. It can be thoroughly recommended to anyone
interested in this fascinating problem and is likely to long remain
a standard work on the subject.

BIRDS OF THE WORLD. By Oliver L. Austin, Jr. Illustrations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975233619047619" page_id="56350078"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
by Arthur Singer. Paul Hamlyn, London, 1962. Price 84J. net.
The statement on the jacket of this book that it is a spectacular
presentation of all the bird families of the world is by no means an
overstatement, for it is certainly most striking and attractive, the
placing of the illustrations within the letterpress being particularly
pleasing. The artist, Arthur Singer, has produced no less than 300
paintings in colour of a very high standard, both from the point of
view of accuracy and artistic value, and they are excellently repro-
duced. In his preface the author states : " The following pages
present a comprehensive survey of the world's birds to show them as
they are--a natural living entity. I have tried to explain something
of their origin and evolution, their distributions, life histories,
behaviour, and their relationships to one another and to their
environments." Dr. Austin has succeeded admirably in this task and
deals with twenty-seven Orders and 155 Families of birds. Much of
the information contained in the book is obtained from the writings
of other ornithologists and there is a partial bibliography of the more
important of the many works consulted in compiling this work.
This is a book which will not only be of continual help and use but
a constant source of pleasure.

The Breeding of a Crake
The photograph accompanying Mr. Everitt's account of the breeding of the
" Red-legged Water-Rail " and his description of the parents make it evident that
this is not Ortygops notata , as stated, but Laterallus leucopyrrhus, the Red and White Crake
or Southern White-breasted Crake.
Ortygops (now Coturnicops ) notata is much smaller, with the feathers of the back and
wings brown with blackish centres and spotted with white. The breast and abdomen
are whitish, the feathers being tipped with black. The legs are olive-green.

Jameson's Firefinch and the Dark Firefinch
In 1957 I wrote an article in the Avicultural Magazine about the behaviour of
the Dark Firefinch, Lagonosticta rubricata. Recent studies by C. M. N. White and H. E.
Wolters have shown that Jameson's Firefinch, L. jamesoni, is more widely distributed
than was thought, and that a West African race, virata, belongs to the latter, and not
the former species. It was also found that the name rhodopareia should be used for
Jameson's Firefinch and not for a race of the Dark Firefinch. I had kept a skin of one
of my birds, and I now find that most, if not all of my notes refer to a dark race of
L. rhodopareia (= L. jamesoni) and not to L. rubricata. The colours of the races of both
species vary in the same way in similar areas, and the only sure guide appears to be
the shape of the tip of the outermost large primary, which is emarginated in the Dark
Firefinch and entire in Jameson's Firefinch.

Notes on a Parrot Collection in Calcutta
Since I last wrote to you in 1957 about my Golden-headed Conures having bred,
three in November, 1956, and three in February, 1957, that is when they left their
nest, three more left their nest in October, 1957. In January, 1958, three more with
another three in May, 1958, and one in March, 1961.
In August, 1961, I had two young from Pale-headed Rosella X Red-rumped
Parrakeets. The young are more like the Rosella. Although I have bred Cockatiels
many years ago I kept no record. In July, i960, two young left their nest with two
more in October, 1960, and one in August, 1961.
I have a Peach-faced Lovebird which is completely red, but with the rump blue.
I seem to think that with age some of these Lovebirds become partly or entirely red
and doubt whether they will breed. I also have a pair of completely white (not
albino) Red-vented Black Bulbuls. They are lovely birds, white with red vents.
About a couple of months ago I was offered a very young, not fully feathered, blue
Alexandrine but the bird died before it could be delivered to me. I have a number of
very pretty Red Avadavats in the following colours, black, (some do get black with
age), pied, white-headed, white-cheeked, and the prettiest of them all, light fawn
birds with red breasts.
Due to unsettled conditions I was unable to build the aviaries I had planned for
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.55342675" page_id="56350079"  page_num="43" year="" vol="">
my Cockatoos of which I have a number of species and which are at present in cages
3 X 2^ X 2 feet. A White-crested Cockatoo was continually laying since 1955 and
I decided that something must be done for this pair. I built an aviary and released
the birds end of May, 1961. On 11 th October, 1961, the hen laid an egg in a large
wooden barrel and another four days later. By about 20th October, 1961, the barrel
was pulled to pieces and the eggs broken. I then put in a small water-boiler which
they inspected and tested, but there was no question of breaking up this nest. On
12th December, 1961, the hen laid an egg and another a couple of days later. Because
</listItem>

of the cold spell I knew the eggs would not hatch as it was the same with all my
other birds. However, on 5th and 7th February, 1962, two more eggs were laid.
On 9th March, one of my workers told me he had a dream that one of the eggs
had hatched. Of course I promptly told him that he was a silly ass and should have
dreamt that both the eggs had hatched ! Sure enough, his dream came true as next
morning, 10th March, 1962, we saw the young one. This event according to my men
was a " Burra Deen ", big day, and there was no way out of it but for them to celebrate
at my expense ! The water-boiler, with the lid off for the entrance, was laid on its side
and slightly raised in front. It was filled some four or five inches with coarse sawdust
and wood chips but most of this was thrown out and part pushed towards the entrance.
The young one is never left alone and every time either of the parents leaves the boiler
to feed, it is most amusing to see them peep through a hole at the bottom end where
the tap used to be before entering. The youngster is now a few days over a month
old and has a number of tiny feathers growing.

WHITE EYES AS " HOMING " BIRDS
My recent articles about White Eyes breeding at liberty in Norfolk have prompted
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9692748" page_id="56350079"  page_num="43" year="" vol="">
a number of inquiries into the suitability of this species for homing experiments.
In my experience White Eyes are intelligent, adaptable, and self-composed little
birds, inexpensive to buy and maintain and inseparably attached to each other.
Their small size, quick movements, inconspicuous plumage and arboreal habits
protect them from the vandal's air-gun and minimize the risk of predation by cats
and other ground vermin.
Provided there are trees nearby and one has a well-established true pair in breeding
condition, familiar with the view from the aviary and addicted to a certain food (in
this case nectar) there is no reason why anyone should not experience the sheer
delight in having White Eyes flying free during the summer months.

It is undoubtedly an advantage to keep at least one other specimen in captivity
to act as a call-bird during the initial stages of their freedom and advisable to release
one bird of the pair some days before the other to explore the neighbourhood before
returning to its mate and the feeder.
As White Eyes are great bathers the provision of a shallow dish of water will offset
any temptation to bathe in water-butts or other dangerous places.
On no account should they be caught-up or handled.
As the nests are attached to leaf-stems it is best to wait till late May or June when
the foliage is well-developed and it is certainly imperative to re-admit them to the
aviary before the gales and frosts of autumn, or any possible post-breeding wanderlust
makes itself felt.

MUTUAL PREENING BEHAVIOUR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9536808" page_id="56350080"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
I thought it may be of interest to mention the mutual preening and behaviour
of two birds in my possession, a cock Chinese Painted Quail ( Excalfactoria chinensis)
and a cock Firefinch (L. senegala). The Firefinch initiates these preening periods,
preening the Quail mostly on the head, for up to three minutes, sometimes perching
on the Quail's back. The Quail's preening of the Firefinch, however, is of briefer
duration and not always reciprocal.
Some time ago I had a Java Sparrow ( Paddy oryzivora), which frequently perched
on the back of a Necklaced Dove ( Streptopelia chinensis ), although no preening took
place, but I have been told that Java Sparrows are noted for this habit when kept
with Doves.

REARING GREAT INDIAN BUSTARDS

(Choriotis nigriceps)
By K. S. Dharmakumarsinhji, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U. (Dilbahar,
Bhavnagar, India.)
Many years ago at home one of our Falconer-cum-Dog boys was
given a two-week old Great Indian Bustard chick to rear. This he
successfully did, but no notes of the upbringing were made. The chick
seemed to have flourished on all kinds of foods the boy ate himself.
Last August, I was given a Bustard fledgling which I presumed was
about a month old. A brief description of it, is of interest. Crown,
black with fawn coronal streak ; supercilium, pale buff ; upper-parts,
brown with black and buff spots ; neck, fawn, finely vermiculated
or barred with dull black ; throat, buff. Lower-parts, buffy with
ochre undertail-coverts ; tail, pale greenish-grey ; primaries, slate ;
secondaries, grey, flecked with white and buff; wing-coverts, spotted
with buff and tan. Eyes, iris pale yellow ; bill, horny and ivory-white
with egg-tooth whitish. Weight, lb.
The chick became hungry after two hours of capture and was
force-fed on grubs and earthworms. Subsequently, it was fed on raw
minced meat three times a day. On the third day it took food on its
own but was still force-fed for four more days. The chick emitted a
short shrill " kaon " and when alone twittered repeatedly. When
disturbed it sounded a throaty " gha ".
For over a month it was fed on minced meat, green leaf which it
picked up, locusts, grasshoppers, other insects, and prawns, all of which
was given to it by hand. It sometimes took rice and green peas. From
the early stage it swallowed grit. I kept a keeper to look after it, whom
it recognized and followed.
A constant twittering whistle when left alone appeared characteristic.
When hungry it came to the keeper's feet ; it was then fed by hand,
after which it sat on its tarsi or walked searchingly. Attempts at
feeding on its own were made, and it was seen to catch minute insects,
caterpillars, earwigs, centipedes, and small butterflies. In a month's
time its weight had reached 2 |lb. The wings were clipped as it could
fly. The colour of the legs was fleshy-white and the soft neck feathers
commenced dropping.

46 K. S. DHARMAKUMARSINHJI-REARING GREAT INDIAN BUSTARDS
The chick's habit was to take frequent dust-baths ; rubbing its neck
sideways and puffing out the neck and crown feathers ; then it would
suddenly spring to its feet to stand erect motionless for a second or
two. At times the wings were ruffled to take in dust. During the process
of rubbing its neck in the dust, the body angle was slightly tilted and
the chick gave an impression of being in pain as it squirmed in the dust.
Later when it suddenly jumped up and stood, it often gave itself a good
shaking, raising the mantle and scapulars, a common habit often seen
in adult Bustards. The stretching of one wing and leg was also observed.
When a goat or large bird passed by, the chick raised its tail and spread
out its wings in a threatening manner. This threat-posture was
sometimes accompanied by a hiss or " gha " with the crown and neck
feathers puffed. This display was seen in play also. The peculiar thing
about it was that the bird's display was so sudden and ceased as
suddenly as it had commenced. This threat-display which appeared
like a dance when the bird turned round, was seen more frequently at
a later stage.
When seated, the chick kept one leg slightly in front of the other and
it often moved forward or turned while still resting on its tarsi. When
preening, the chick invariably closed its eyelids. In the second month,
a new coat of smoky-grey feathers appeared on the neck, and blackish
feathers were seen at the sides of the breast. Blackish-brown feathers
grew on the wing-coverts, forming a chequered pattern of black and
tan on them. A white spot above the wing-shoulder also showed itself
clearly. The lower-parts became buffy-white.
Another Bustard chick was obtained in September and this fledgling
was presumed to be about three to four weeks younger than the first.
It weighed 2i lb. Although much the same colour and pattern as the
first, it had a shorter and thicker neck ; paler and broader super-
cilium ; the crown was black tipped with buff edges to feathers ; bill,
bluish-grey with egg-tooth whitish. Eyes, iris, earthy-brown ; legs,
greyish or plumbeous. The chick was placed on same diet. It was shyer
and made frequent efforts to escape. It made less sound though
making the characteristic twittering and was less demonstrative.
Both young drank water profusely from a cup. The manner was to
sit on the tarsi and sip, sucking water like in the Columbidae. Basking
was done by sitting or lying flat with one or both wings spread out. In
the sun the gular movement was often noticed.
In November, Chick 2 grew rapidly reaching same size as No. 1.
By December, it had exceeded No. 1. This was rather extraordinary
considering it was only three-quarters the size of No. 1 soon after it had
arrived. All in all, a sexual difference was suspected. The neck
assumed lighter greyish-white, with very faint barring while the breast
showed a blacker and broader band ; flanks were also whiter than No. 1
which had a pale bufhsh tinge. Tarsus and toes were larger. Both

young now had full black crowns with a greyish hue and a short crest. On
the upper-parts, the buff spots almost disappeared and a more uniform
sandy-brown colour was seen, the black markings scanty only on No. i
Irides became paler. The remiges are a bluish-grey flecked with white
and a conspicuous patch of white on the centre feathers. Both young
fly easily and enter into mutual play.
Owing to lack of natural food, I have put both birds on a pellet diet
consisting of: Chopped meat, 90 per cent ; crushed gram flour,
5 per cent ; ground carrots, 2 per cent ; butter fat \ per cent ; boiled
egg, 2 per cent ; vegetable leaf, \ per cent ; fortified with Vitamin
A and D.
In voice, No. 1 emits a peculiar short throaty " wut-wut-wuturr 5
repeated quickly and which appears to denote affection ; it is
reminiscent of the alarm note of Grus grus. The plaintive twittering is
less conspicuous and seldom heard. Chick No. 2, more silent, sedate,
and shyer, utters frequently a short whistle and a drawn-out whistle
which is reminiscent of the courtship song of the Painted Snipe
(Rostratula benghalensis ). Both emit the " gha 55 but No. 2 emits a
sobbing " W00-000-000 5 when handled.
Both young have excellent eyesight, equalling the Goshawk and
react to birds of prey flying at great height. They react to eagles by
crouching or by threat display when an eagle flies low over them.
Disregarding kites and now vultures, they show vent to eagles, buzzards,
and hawks, and become alert at the sound of the alarm signals given
by other birds. The threat posture is often triggered by a bird flying
high over, or by a flying insect such as a dragon-fly, or by a bird
alighting close by, or even just sometimes without any special cause.
In taking flight, both birds take a step or two and while taking off the
legs are drawn up and then stretched out behind. When alighting a
short glide is seen. Flapping of wings is done as exercise, and the feet
are often lifted from the ground when doing so. Both birds play with
small objects, sticks, small stones, manipulating them with their bills,
and keep themselves very clean. They had from the start, a liking for
swallowing white shiny objects or pebbles which they pick up with
much rapidity. Such pebbles and pieces of glass are expelled regularly
in the faeces. Both birds eat about \ lb. of food daily. They are mostly
hand-fed and are given daily morning and evening walks, after which
they are penned in a small roofed enclosure with wire netting in front.
No. 1 stands 28 inches and weighs 6J lb. and No. 2, 35 inches and
weighs 8 |lb. on 7th January, 1963. No. 1 has more distinct vermicula-
tion on the upper-parts and neck than in No. 2, which has whiter
breast and belly, thicker neck feathers, blacker breast-band, and rich
brown, almost turning to rufescent, at the base of hind-neck. No. 1 has
a tinge of fawn on lores, face, chin and throat with a duller supercilium.
In the manner of taking food No. 1 has a soft mouth, tasting its food

frequently, protruding its tongue, and gulping smoothly ; in contrast
No. 2 has a hard mouth and swallows food jerkily like a duck. More
observations are being made as the birds grow.
The Great Indian Bustard is protected in India as it is becoming
quite rare. The first Zoo in India to obtain an adult pair of this species
is the Bikaner Zoo in Rajasthan. The pair is thriving well.

By R. A. Copley (Hemingford Grey, Huntingdonshire, England)
A pair of Black-necked swans were acquired in i960, and they
were immediately introduced to an area of water of about ij
acres and plenty of grass. The male started coming up for food
almost at once, but the female seemed to be very unhappy and was
all the time trying to get out. It paid no attention to the other swan
or to any of the other birds on the water. Day after day it was seen on
its own, sulking in a corner, and every endeavour was made to get it
to eat or to take some interest in its surroundings.
Soon it seemed to be very weak and almost unable to stand and when
it was caught and put in a confined space it still refused to eat and would
only drink a little water. The male would not take any notice of it
at all.
It appeared quite clear that the female was very unhappy and would
die unless its circumstances were changed, so it was sent back to where
it came from. Unfortunately it was not given a chance to rehabilitate
itself and was promptly killed to see if it had any disease. The report
was that it had no disease.
Another female was obtained from the same source and this was
put in a confined space separated from the male by a piece of wire
netting. Very quickly he came up to take notice of the new bird and
for several days they remained side by side with only the netting
between them. Directly the wire netting was removed they both went
into the lake and have been inseparable ever since. In 1961 the fence
dividing the lake was opened and they had five acres of water and
islands.
In early 1962 it was seen that they were making a nest on one of
the islands, so hay and straw were supplied. They then made a big
nest and laid five eggs, three in due course hatched off, two being
unfertile. The young ones were soon being carried on the backs of
the male and female and it was thought that they would be safe on the

island they had chosen ; but in a few days time it was noticed that
only two cygnets remained and before anything could be done only
one cygnet was left.
The parents with their one cygnet were confined to a small area of
water and a clear piece of sandy land. The two cygnets on the island
were found mutilated and eaten by some predator. The parents took
great care of the cygnet and it always rested on the back of one of
them underneath the fold in the wing even when it was grown to
half size.
Shortly after this another egg was found on a few scraps and sticks
that had been collected ; so immediately hay, straw, and grass were
provided and another large nest was made in the restrictive area and
five eggs in all were laid. The female started to sit and, in ignorance,
the cygnet was allowed to stay with its parents and every evening it
was seen sitting on the nest beside its mother and everything seemed
to be satisfactory.
Early one morning the cygnet was seen to be in great trouble some
distance away from its parents. When caught it was found that its
head was badly swollen and one eye was very damaged. To ascertain
what had happened the cygnet was put near the nest with a piece of
wire protecting it. The cause of the injury was soon discovered because
the male tried many times to hit the cygnet with its wing and it
appeared only too clearly that the instinct of the father to protect its
offspring had been wiped out by its instinct to protect the female and
the nest. When any nest making begins again, the cygnets will now
be removed to safety.
The cygnet was taken away and put with some bantams and other
chicks for company but it seemed to have lost its balance. It fed and
drank a little and its head appeared to improve but it seemed blind in
one eye due to the injury. It gradually grew weaker until it died.
In due course of time two cygnets were hatched off from the second
sitting and these are doing well and their neck feathers are beginning
to go black.
It is noted that when the cygnets are growing to their full stature
they are very unsteady on their legs and if they are frightened their
legs give way and appear to lose all strength.
It is understood that it is quite rare for Black-necked Swans to raise
two broods in one year and it will be interesting to see what happens
in 1963.
The male bird appears to be rather antagonistic to any other white
birds on the water, particularly a pair of Muscovies, but as these can
fly no damage is likely. He sometimes objects to one of the Emperor
Geese.
One interesting trait is his wonderful eyesight. He often notices the
writer looking at him through a window and sets up a cry immediately.

He also loves to show off by skimming over the water at great speed
and as he reaches the bank where you are standing, he dives, almost
standing on his head. He never appears to get tired of showing off in
this way.
Generally it has been very interesting to study the love life of Black-
necked Swans and this year it is hoped to get a cinefilm of the
courtship.

By J. Delacour (Cleres, France)
Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, New Caledonia and the
South Pacific Islands were the last part of the world I had never
visited before. As years are passing fast, it was essential not to delay
too long a trip to this fascinating area, so long isolated from the larger
land masses that the flora and fauna possess a highly peculiar character.
I therefore left Cleres early in September, 1962, and after a few days
at Singapore, where I was the guest of the well known ornithologist
and bird photographer Dato Loke Wan Tho, I arrived at Perth,
Western Australia, on the 10th September.
My excuse for writing the present notes for this magazine is that
many Australian birds, in particular, are not only very different from
those of the rest of the world, and extremely attractive ; but they also
number among those which have long been the most popular with
aviculturists. Cockatoos and Broadtail parrakeets, pigeons and doves,
geese and ducks, as well as grassfinches, to name only the most familiar,
have been early aviary favourites as they add to great beauty the
advantage of being fairly hardy in Europe and in North America,
where they breed relatively easily. I hope therefore that some recent
observations concerning them will interest our readers.
Australians and New Zealanders are enthusiastic and experienced
aviculturists, and it was my privilege to visit some collections. I wish
I had had time to see more of them, which I hope to do in the near
future.
I.--Western Australia
Perth is a large and attractive city, and the Swan River estuary
expands into salt-water lakes, along which runs, high on a hill, a vast
park where the native vegetation has been well protected, to the
advantage of numerous native birds. Small swampy lakes have very
fortunately been preserved in the suburbs, so that one can see there,

close to houses, an excellent sample of West Australian water birds :
two species of Cormorants, Coots, Porphyrios, Black Moorhens, Black
Swans, Grey Ducks, Grey Teal, White-eyed and Blue-billed Ducks,
and even the curious little Pink-eared Ducks. The only pigeons seen
there are the introduced Senegal Palm Doves. The familiar Australian
passerine birds are much in evidence in park and gardens and one
Parrakeet, the Port Lincoln (Barnardius z- zonarius) is very common.
The population at Perth is somewhat intermediate between zonarius
and the larger semitorquatus found farther south.
I was met at Perth by Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Sheffler, my old friends
from Los Angeles, who accompanied me throughout Australia.
Dr. D. Serventy, the well-known Australian ornithologist, not only
kindly showed us birds in and around Perth, but he also had
arranged for a comprehensive 3,300 mile tour by car of the central and
southern parts of the State.
West Australia probably contains the most varied and showy wild
flowers in the whole world, and September is the best month to see them
in all their glory. The Australian flora is dominated by the Eucalyptus,
which give the country a very special aspect ; growing to a very large
size, they usually have a small and light canopy which provide little
shade, so that there is a rich undergrowth ; there are hundreds of
different species, but all of them, large or small, present these
characteristics. It makes it easier to see birds.
We went first north, through the light eucalyptus forest, then the
savannah country, most of which has now been changed into wheat
fields. Farther north-east, we found the " mulga ", an arid area more
or less thickly covered with stunted acacias and other desert growth ;
we went as far north as Kathleen Valley. Afterwards we drove
south to Kalgoorlie and reached the southern coast at Esperance.
On our way to Kathleen Valley, through Wubin and Mount Magnet,
we saw in the wheat belt our first Roseate Cockatoos, the Galahs as
they are locally called. Although very common in all the cultivated
and open parts of Australia, they remain one of the most attractive
birds one can watch. They are usually walking on the ground, feeding
or on the wing, when they look at their best ; sometimes they perch
on fences, wires or trees ; also one sees them coming in and out
of hollow branches of eucalyptus. Australian Magpies, or Piping
Crows and Butcherbirds are always numerous. European Goldfinches
abound, more numerous and tamer in Australia than in their native
countries. There are here and there brackish ponds, where Black
Swans and Australian Shelducks live ; the latter had broods of young.
Straw-necked Ibises are met in flocks ; these fine birds are never
molested, as they destroy many harmful insects, and they are common
all over Australia. As we went north-east, Red-tailed Black Cockatoos
and Corellas (Bare-eyed Cockatoos) became more numerous, usually

feeding in the fields. Port Lincoln Parrakeets were still numerous,
but Rock Peplars appeared here and there, and in the dry country, we
saw one Queen Alexandra's and several Bourke's Parrakeets. Emus
and kangaroos (Red and Euro) began to show up here and there. But
they have been, and still are, terribly persecuted and ruthlessly
slaughtered by sheep farmers, as is the Wedge-tailed Eagle, which we
never saw once in that part of Australia where it used to be very
numerous.
We spent two delightful days at Yackabundi, Kathleen Valley, the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Bob Adamson, who farm a very large sheep
station, in this arid, semi-desert district. The big house is surrounded
by a lush, irrigated garden. Birds recognize its tall trees and green
shrubs as an oasis. Budgerigars come by the hundreds, Galahs swarm
around the farmyard. Each morning, I could watch a hundred
Crested Pigeons (Ocyphaps lophotes) feeding with the poultry, Mud
Larks (Magpie larks) abound as everywhere else in Australia, and
there were many other birds around. Away in the desert we could
find the Western Bowerbird and its bowers, and the curious Quail
Thrush ; lovely Red-capped Robins nested in the garden trees.
Port Lincoln Parrakeets also were there.
The southern coast is picturesque and rocky, and the islands off-shore
are the western home of the Cereopsis goose which never inhabits the
mainland. The country is green and very cool at that season, and the
wildlife quite remarkable. On the way west to Albany and beyond,
there were pairs of Maned geese, Grey Ducks, Plovers, White-faced
and White-necked Herons around pools ; Stanley Parrakeets were
frequent, as also the large, crow-like, grey Currawongs (Strepera versi-
color) . The introduced Kookaburra was commoner over there than in
its native east. We came across several flocks of White-tailed Black
Cockatoos, high up in Eucalyptus forests ; we once counted 134 in
a flock, including young birds still fed by their parents. Pelicans were
frequently seen near the coast.
The great interest of Albany, as far as birds are concerned, consists
of the presence in its vicinity of the Noisy Scrub Bird (Atrichornis
clamosus) in the thick, short brush which covers the slopes of the hills
along the ocean. Mr. H. O. Webster, its recent (1961) rediscoverer,
took me through the scrubland to his small cabin near Two People
Bay. Just outside, as we landed from the car, I heard a beautiful
song, similar to that of the nightingale, but fuller, louder and more
varied. A narrow path wound through this part of the brush, above
which stand a few scattered trees. There is a worn run across the
path, such as a rodent or a weasel would make ; but it actually
is that of the Scrub Bird. This particular specimen, used to human
observers and probably intrigued by them, starts singing and also
moving about as soon as he hears anyone. It eventually crosses

the path along its run, and all one has to do to see it is to wait a few
yards away. I saw it twice, a small, brown bird, with an erect head,
thin neck, high held tail and short legs, running like a rat, deliberately
and without fear. It general aspect, proportions and movements
clearly indicate its peculiarity, which is proved by its special anatomical
features. Prior to Mr. Webster's observations it had not been seen
since 1889 and was therefore considered extinct. It is probably
still fairly numerous in the impenetrable scrub of the coast, which is
now being proclaimed a sanctuary.
Two other very rare birds were seen and heard in the area : the
Black-throated Whip-bird ( Psophodes nigrogularis) and the Bristle Bird
(.Dasyornis longirostris ). The weather was bad during our visit--rain and
a cold wind. Mr. Webster is an excellent photographer of birds' nests,
but he has not yet been able to find that of the Noisy Scrub Birds ; he
has only seen the female on two occasions. But he will no doubt soon
succeed.
West of Albany, on the way to the western coast, we crossed the
magnificent forest of giant Eucalyptus, Karris ( E . diversicolor) and Yar-
rahs (. E . marginata ), the former as large and tall as the great Sequoia Red
Woods of the California coast. Stanley Parrakeets were numerous, but
we only saw a few Pileated ( Porphyrocephalus spurius ). Brush Bronze-wing
Pigeons were not uncommon among the shrubs and trees along the
coast.
The best private collection of live birds which we saw near Perth
was that of Mr. Theo Peters, who has a large, well planted aviary
and several smaller ones. The most interesting birds were several
species of the magnificent Blue Wrens of the west and the lovely
Red-eared Firetails, a beautiful Waxbill-like Finch of the south-west, rare
in captivity and very difficult to keep ; there were also Scarlet Chested
Parrakeets, Plumed Doves and several other Finches and Softbills, all
in excellent condition and perfectly kept. There are a number of
smaller collections most of cockatoos and parrakeets.
The Perth Zoo is not very large, but it is attractive and well kept,
and it has very good collections of local birds and mammals. It must
be remembered that importation into Australia of any foreign birds
has been prohibited for years, so that zoos and aviculturists have to
concentrate on the local avifauna, which, fortunately, is one of the
best in the world. The cockatoos and parrakeets are particularly well
represented at the Perth Zoo. They are well housed and cared for,
and many breed each year. There are a few birds of prey in perfect
condition, and interesting waterfowl, doves and passerine birds.

Introduction
My Java Sparrow keeping has not, as will appear, been very

extensive or successful. As, however, I have been unable to find any
detailed notes on its behaviour in English books or j'ournals I feel
j'ustified in offering my own scanty observations on this interesting,
beautiful and cheap bird, together with references to some relevant
observations that have appeared in German publications.
The Java Sparrow (.Padda oryzivora) also known as Ricebird, Java
Finch and, to the romantically-minded American aviculturist, as
Java Temple Bird is endemic to Java and Bali. It occurs widely else-
where in south-eastern Asia but in many places is suspected of having
been introduced. It is one of the largest estrildines and (as most
readers will know but I shall describe it for such as do not) extremely
beautiful. About the size of a Goldfinch but very different in head
and bill shape. General colour soft bluish-grey, mauve-pink belly,
head black with white cheeks, rump and tail black and a very large
bill which is pink to pinkish-red at the base and whitish-pink at the tip.
There is also a domesticated variety which is white or pied in colour.
The domestic form is said to be easy to breed but as its price never
drops below #5 or #6 per pair (about six times as much as the far more
beautiful wild form) it seems unlikely that it can be really prolific.
The very scarcity of white Java Sparrows when compared to the
numbers of the other two domesticated estrildines, the Zebra Finch
and the Bengalese Finch, which are to be seen in every bird shop,
shows as clearly as anything could that it cannot be so easy to breed
as other domesticated species are.
It would appear that, contrary to what is the case with Bengalese
Finches and Canaries, it is impossible to produce wild-coloured
domesticated Java Sparrows by pairing pied individuals together. At
least I have never heard of it being done or seen domesticated greys
offered for sale.
History of Individuals Kept
In my early 'teens I bought a " pair 55 of Java Sparrows, for the
modest sum of 2s. 6 d., and kept them in a large outdoor aviary with
a small shelter attached, in company with Turtle Doves and various
small passerines. These Java Sparrows never showed any signs of
nesting and were probably of the same sex. It was not until the summer

zoos and bird-dealers' establishments and, one day seeing two in a
cage full of Budgerigars in a local pet shop, I bought them.
They were placed in a cage about 3 by 3 by 4 feet high and once
they had got used to their new home were allowed to fly free about the
upper part of the house for at least two or three hours every other day.
One soon revealed himself to be a male by his frequent song and
display. The sex of his mate remained a mystery, however, as the
second bird never showed any behaviour that could be interpreted as
definitely either feminine or masculine. From the size of its bill it was
most likely a male. Early in December I visited the " Crystal Palace "
show. Looking round the dealers' stands I saw at that of the Toddington
Bird Farm a cage with about a dozen Java Sparrows. One (and only
one) of these was an obvious hen, being very small and neat with
(for a Java Sparrow) a very small, pale-coloured bill. Moreover she
had about her something of that indefinable " sweetness " or
" placidity " of expression that one sees on some female pigeons (of all
species) and which always indicates that the bird showing it will be
more easily tamed and less nervous and panicky than others of its
species. This will sound nonsense to the non-aviculturist but anyone
of experience in keeping pigeons and other birds will know what
I mean. With some difficulty, but no objection, the proprietor
managed to catch this individual for me from among the fluttering
melee and also another bird which I thought might do as a mate for
her. Since I was reluctant to part the original " pair " if it could
be avoided.
The original pair showed hostility to the newcomers though this
decreased in intensity in a very short time. The two newcomers
showed, to my surprise, not the slightest tendency to pair or even
associate closely with each other. The old pair, including the male,
were equally hostile to both. It became very evident that if I was to
get any observations on the breeding behaviour of the J ava Sparrow
the only course was to split the original pair and keep only the two
birds known to be a male and female. Moral scruples against splitting
the faithful old pair thus came into conflict with scientific interests.
I fear I need hardly tell my readers that, as is usual in such cases,
moral scruples soon went by the board. I gave away the new (presumed)
male and the bird of unknown sex and kept the female and the
undoubted male of the original pair.
Left with only the hen for company the male did not immediately
succumb to her charms. He called loudly and frequently for his
former enigmatic mate, sang at very frequent intervals and although
he did not actually persecute the female he repulsed her in no uncertain
manner whenever she tried to approach him closely. At night they
slept in different nest-baskets on opposite sides of the cage. This state
of affairs continued for about ten days. Then, on the morning of

24th December, I saw the female hop along the perch towards the
male. As she drew near him she greeted him humbly, lowering her
head right to her feet. He, although not responding courteously to
the greeting, did not repulse her, she cautiously drew close against,
him and they sat side by side for (so far as I had seen) the first time.
That night was certainly the first time they roosted together, the
female having probably taken the initiative over this also, as they
roosted in the male's basket, not hers.
Within a few days they were firmly paired, constantly greeting one
another with the tail twist and head bow and the male frequently
giving his courtship display and song. On 15th January I noticed
that a piece of string had been carried into the cage by the birds, who
had been free of the house on the previous day. I put some lengths of
string and some long dried grass on the floor and the cock soon carried
some into the nest-basket that they did not use for roosting. For the next
few weeks the birds spent much time building and copulated frequently,
but by the time the first egg was laid on nth February, only the barest !
apology for a nest was inside the basket. The pair began to sit or at
any rate to take turns inside the basket, but it was obviously a very
unsatisfactory nest and they soon began to lose interest. By the 16th
they had clearly deserted and when I emptied out the basket I found
two eggs, together with only a few odd whisps of grass and a feather
or two.
This nesting failure seemed to be due to the basket (one of the
ordinary " foreign finch nest basket " type) being too small. The
closeness of its sides around them evidently provided the Java Sparrows
with the same stimulus as would a nest with the outer shell already
built. Hence, for the most part they had taken only nest-lining
materials and these had been constantly knocked out of the nest when
the birds hopped in and out. I removed the basket and substituted
a plastic basket (one used for shaking washed lettuces dry, I believe)
about 7 inches in diameter. I cut a hole in one side and threaded a
few twigs and bits of grass among the plastic bars to give a bit more
cover. At first the birds viewed this addition to their world with fear
and suspicion but they soon got used to, and, then investigated it,
and before the end of the month had begun to build in it.
I think the first egg was laid on 3rd March. None having hatched
by 23rd March I feared they were addled or infertile. I removed two
eggs and, foolishly, broke them open. The first was infertile, the
second, to my sorrow and anger, contained a live young one, which was
evidently not due to hatch for several days. There were still four more
eggs in the nest and when I replaced the nest the parents soon returned.
On the 24th I could feel one young one in the nest. On 26th all the
remaining eggs had hatched. For a few days all went well, or at least
appeared to do so. The parents were assiduous in caring for their

young. On the 26th I took a nestling out to look at it. It was light
pink with the feather tracts showing grey under the skin on the wings
only. Most of its bill was blackish, but it had a broad creamy-white
gape and gape flanges. The inside of the mouth was pale pinkish
without markings. It was plump and healthy, its crop contained millet
and a few bits of broken rice or broken peanut.
On 1 st April a friend who had looked after my birds that day told
me that he was worried as the cock Java Sparrow had looked unwell.
He was only too right in his fears. Early on the 2nd I found the male
moribund on the floor and he died within half an hour in spite of
attempts to revive him with heat. The female did not look well either.
She appeared weak on her legs and, although feeding the young, she
obviously was not giving them enough as they called loudly and
continually for food ; which they had never done before. Previously
I had only heard them call, not so intensely as now, when they were
actually being fed and in the early morning before their first feed of
the day. I tried to force feed both the female and the young with some
beaten up raw egg. With little success ; the female indeed looked
worse after my ministrations than she had before. Then I had to leave
the birds (first putting on a second heater in their room) and hope
for the best.
When I returned at 5 p.m. all the young were dead. Apparently
of cold through the hen not brooding them as they showed no signs
of emaciation and two of them still had some of the egg I had fed to
them in their crops. The hen bird looked much better and had begun
to call, a sure sign that she was no longer seriously ill. How strange it
seems to us that the same estrildine that is greatly upset and calls
constantly if out of sight of its mate when well, is silent and does not
even answer its mate's calls if it is seriously ill. At a time when one
would have thought the mate's presence might be most desired it is no
longer of any importance and the sick bird dies alone or, if it recovers,
only then begins to seek to re-establish contact. One can see the
biological utility of this behaviour but this does not lessen its pathos.
I sent the cock bird for a post-mortem which diagnosed a blood
clot on the head. However, I feel certain that the real cause of the
trouble was nutritional. The diet that Java Sparrows, or at any rate
my Java Sparrows, will take in captivity is, perhaps, sufficient to keep
adults in health but as soon as the bird is feeding young (because it
then consumes less food itself or because some nutritive secretion is
fed to the young ?) it is no longer getting enough of some vital element.
The fact that the hen was obviously " going the same way " as the cock
but quickly recovered as soon as she gave up parental cares makes it
pretty certain that the cock's blood clot was a symptom rather than
a cause of his condition.
Next day the hen looked as fit as ever. For some weeks I kept her

alone, then, instead of being sensible and searching round until I could i
find a reasonably steady male for her I accepted a friend's offer of a Java I ,
Sparrow which he thought was a cock. In this he was correct, the bird
proved a male in good condition and of a particularly bluish colour
in its grey parts. Its beauty and fitness were, however, its sole
recommendations. It was excessively wild and when, after about
three weeks, it paired with the hen (for Java Sparrows seem, in my
limited experience, much more reluctant to accept a substitute for
a lost mate than are pigeons or waxbills who seldom lose much time
grieving for the late loved one if an adequate replacement is to hand) ,
she soon became wild " in sympathy ".
I was thus able to get far fewer observations on this second male
and the hen's behaviour with him. After I had had them together
for about a month they were free together in the house one day and
evidently found a window which had been inadvertently left open and
escaped through it. I felt a greater guilt at my carelessness which had
caused their almost certain death because I could not feel entirely !
sorry at having lost them.

This information is given for interest not example since, as has been
shown, it is highly likely that the feeding of my birds was inadequate.
It is hoped that any who have been successful with these birds will
make known their own feeding methods in our magazine.
My Java Sparrows, so far as I saw, ate nothing but paddy rice if
given a free choice. If paddy rice was not available they freely ate
canary and millet seed. Soaked and germinating (or dry) spray millet
they would eat in some quantity if it was tied near their perch so that
they did not have to fly down to the floor of the cage. If they had to do
so then they preferred to take paddy rice from the dish. Seeding,
flowering and newly growing grasses, chickweed, lettuce, knotgrass,
mealworms, and maggots were left untouched. Ripe or unripe wheat
or oats in the ear were taken readily, at any rate if they were tied
temptingly near a perch. Considerable quantities of sand, mineralized
grit and crushed baked eggshell were taken. The seed was treated
weekly, rather more often in winter, with halibut oil.
Prior to their commencing to nest I had, rightly anticipating that
their diet would lead to disaster if they tried to rear young on it, tried
to coerce them into eating other foods, inspired by the sight of a Java
Sparrow in a zoo eating peanuts. This was successful to the extent
that very small quantities of broken peanuts and sponge cake (home-
made, with eggs) were eaten. However, these foods were never touched
until the birds were looking very dejected from hunger, only small
quantities of them were taken then and the moment dry seed or
paddy rice was available all other foods were ignored. Radtke, who

successfully reared young from a white male and a captive-bred grey
hen, found that his birds refused soft food, live food and sprouted oats
but ate and fed to their young large quantities of chickweed. My own
pair fed quantities of soaked spray millet to their young, but continued
to ignore other supplements to their dry rice diet.
The species is said to eat insects in a wild state but I know of no
detailed study of it in freedom. However, at least one other estrildine--
the Gouldian Finch--which habitually refuses live food in captivity,
feeds its young largely on insects in a natural state (Immelmann, 1962)
so that it would be unsafe to deny that the Java Sparrow may do
likewise.
Voice
My notes on this subject are tentative, especially as regards the
function of the various calls. They are, however, at least more complete
than are such other accounts of the voice of the species which I have
been able to find (and which I quote here when relevant) and will,
I hope, serve as a foundation for anyone undertaking a more detailed
study.
The Contact Call
This is the short, rather liquid " T'luk " or " Ch'luk ", mono-
syllabic, but usually repeated many times. It appears to function in
maintaining or re-establishing contact between individuals. Possibly
it might as well be termed a " flight-intention 55 call as it usually seems
to indicate some degree of disquiet or alarm and readiness to fly away.
It is heard in many different degrees of intensity. Typically it is
very loud and emphatic in birds which are separated from their
companions or which take flight in alarm. If a pair are shut in different
rooms both utter this call in answer to the same call from the partner.
This call and the trilling call may intergrade. A German aviculturist
sometimes heard this call given by a male White Java Sparrow when
displaying (Radtke, 1959) and another says (Kunze, 1962) that the
song consists only of repetitions of this call note. My own birds never
gave this call when displaying but there would appear to be much
individual (or racial ?) variation in song and perhaps some males do
simply use repetitions of the contact call as their song. The alarm call
appeared, to my ears, to be merely a very loud, " hard-sounding "
version of this call, but further observations on this are needed.
The Trilling Call
A trill, of varying length, with a strong " r " sound in it and usually
with rising inflection. May intergrade with the contact call but
typically quite distinct from it. A very loud, hard, rattling, long-drawn
version is given during successful copulation.

This call seems to be an expression of any form of apparently
pleasurable excitement connected with reproductive behaviour. It is
given by the female, possibly also by the male, when greeting the mate
after a brief separation. When they bow in greeting to each other )|
just after hopping out of the roosting basket they have shared when the
light is put on in the morning. By the female when alighting near nest
with a feather and more intensely a moment later as she enters the nest
with it. Possibly the male gives it also in this situation but the male
would always stop building if he noticed me watching. By one or both
of pair during copulation, at the moment that cloacal contact was,
apparently, achieved. Not given in attempts at copulation that
appeared unsuccessful. Sometimes by female entering nest (without
feather) if male already inside. As the female sometimes gave it while
the male was giving other vocalizations I am quite sure that she
uttered this call. I cannot be sure whether the male also gave the
trilling call as at all times when I thought he may have done the
female was very near to him. This call was uttered without any
marked bill or throat movements.
I at first thought that the very distinctive version given in copulation
ought to be considered a different call. However, a version intermediate
between the " normal " high-intensity form of the trilling call and the
hard, very long, rattling call given during copulation was heard several
times when artificially induced in the following manner. If I shut the
male in a different room for an hour or so and then let him fly back
into the other room this intermediate version would be given by the
female while he was still in the air flying towards her. It was followed
by very intense greeting display.
That the more usual (non-copulatory) version of the trilling call
depends for its intensity and duration on the degree of excitement was
also indicated by the female when taking feathers to the nest. She
preferred fairly large, fluffy, white feathers and gave much louder,
longer trills as she slipped into the nest (or alighted near it) with one
of this sort than she did when she had only a small, dark-coloured
feather.
The Moaning or Mewing Call
This call is very difficult to describe but quite unmistakable as,
although it varies greatly in loudness, pitch and duration, it bears no
resemblance whatever to any other call. At least not to any other
Java Sparrow call that I have heard. It is a low-pitched moaning
sound, sometimes inclining to a mewing sound, at high intensity
so loud and long-drawn out as to be suggestive of some cries of the
Herring Gull (the " mewing 55 cries) at low intensity only a very soft,
intermittent moan. It always, however, has a very " complaining "
tone, slightly querulous also at times but the " complaining 55 sound is

always present and so striking to the human ear as to tend to make one
at once "jump to the conclusion " that it must be a note of protest.
But this is far from certain.
On the only occasions when I am sure this call was given by the
female of my pair (that is when the male was singing in the nest while
she gave it) she gave it in a much higher-pitched and " sweeter "
sounding form than that usually given.
This call was given when both birds were in the nest-basket at the
same time. Usually it was uttered when one bird entered the basket
in which the other was already present. Thus it was given when one
of the pair entered to take over incubation of the eggs or brooding
of the young or when one entered with nesting material when the other
was already in the nest. It was not, however, confined to such repro-
ductive situations since it was heard from birds going to roost, not only
from the breeding pair but also from the male and/or his original
(probably male) mate who had shown no signs of nesting. The most
intense versions were, however, heard from the breeding pair while
nesting. On very few occasions the male introduced short, low-
intensity versions of this call into his song or it might be more correct
to say interspersed his song with them.
I am uncertain as to the functions of this call or the exact circum-
stances under which it is given since (except when the male gave it
while singing) I was never able to actually see the calling birds. It
would seem likely that it has some appeasing function. It might even
express an inhibited aggressiveness of a bird " resentful " at being
crowded to one side or reluctant to leave its eggs. Since it is only
(in my experience) given when both birds are together in the nest or
roosting-basket it can hardly be equated with the nest-calling of other
estrildines.
The PJVest Call
I sometimes heard a very soft, repeated " tut-tut-tut-tut ..."
suggestive of a very tender, soft version of the contact call but with all
the notes " run together ". Very suggestive of the nest calling of other
estrildines. It was, however, only heard when both members of the
pair were together inside the nest. Kunze (1962) says the hen Java
Sparrow has a very pleasant nest call that sounds like " tuituituit "
but does not give further details.
The Song
There would appear to be much individual or racial variation in the
song of the Java Sparrow. According to Butler (1899) the songs of the
wild grey form and the domesticated white form differ consistently.
However, it is certain that there is much difference even between the
songs of different wild caught birds. Thus I paraphrased the two

songs of my breeding male as " Chu-chillik, chu-chillik, chillik-eee "
and " chillick-chillick-eee ". Pialek (1958) who bred numbers of the
grey form in a large aviary describes the song as a very pleasant-
sounding simple fluting song (" Ein recht wohlklingenden einfachen
Geflote "). Musil (i960) reported that his Java Sparrows hissed atone
another in courtship display (when the majority of males, like mine,
apparently sing). Morris (1958) apparently studied a number of
males (he does not say how many but infers a number was involved)
all of which ended their songs with a very long-drawn whistled
" weeeeeeee The song of my second male (the very timid one) was
much softer, sweeter and rather more complex than that of the other.
Song is given by a male in breeding condition when he is alone or
at any rate out of sight of the female and also in the courtship display.
These at least are the situations in which song is almost invariably
heard from a male in breeding condition and they parallel the situations
in which most other estrildines utter their songs. Less often, however,
the song may be given when in sight of the female and on several
occasions I heard the male sing when both he and the female were in
the nest together. Since there was no sound of jumping it is unlikely
the male was then trying to display to the female. Possibly in the
darkened nest the male may at times be unable to see the female and
this may stimulate song (as it certainly does when the pair are outside)
even though the female is with him.
Bill-snapping
A rather loud snapping or clicking sound, apparently made by
snapping the mandibles together, was usually given by my breeding
male just before beginning to sing in the courtship display.

In this the members of a pair hop or sidle towards one another.
As they come together they bow their heads to their feet or towards the
other bird's feet then lift their heads, each in turn puts its head over
the other's (see sketch), then they bow again. This may all be repeated
several times. The trilling call (q.v.) accompanies or prefaces this
display. At low intensity only the bowing movement may be shown
and it may be merely " suggested ". One bird only may bow, one
may bow more deeply than the other ; only one may put its head
above the other's head.
This display is shown whenever the pair come together after some
little separation. High intensity versions could always be artificially
induced by separating the cock and hen (shutting them in different
rooms) for half an hour or so and then allowing them to come together

very closely together for some five minutes or more. It was shown

of the pair suddenly see one another again after a period with no visual
stimulus from the partner.
In the Java Sparrow (and probably in other species also) the lowering
of the head probably expresses submissiveness or " inferiority 55 and
the placing of head above or higher than the other bird's dominance
or " superiority ". At least this appears to be their significance when
they are performed singly. When they are combined in the full greeting
display they seem to express rather mutual esteem or affection. The
same is true of many other bird displays some of which incorporate
very obvious elements of hostile behaviour (See Goodwin, 1956 for
fuller discussion of this).
If this display were confined to the Java Sparrow one could suggest
that the bowing of the head might be a ritualized aggressive movement
as this species often bites at the feet of another bird when attacking it.
However, as there are homologous displays in other species, including
that of the Dark Fire-finch ( Lagonosticta rubricata) which is extremely
similar in form to that of the Java Sparrow, and these do not try to
bite their enemies' feet, there seems no justification for postulating such
an origin to the bowing of the Java Sparrow.

The Courtship Display and Copulation
The Java Sparrow has a display which is homologous to the bowing
display of Amandava and the stem display of other waxbills (see Goodwin,
i960, Harrison, 1962, Kunkel, 1959). In this display the male adopts
a peculiar bent-over posture. In this posture (see sketch) he bounces
up and down on the perch, sidling nearer to his mate as he does so.
His feet usually leave the perch at each jump and make quite a loud
noise as they strike it again. His lowered head is above perch level
(3) " Bent-over " posture of male in
courtship display.
most of the time and only slightly turned towards the female but
every few seconds (but I think not at every jump) he lowers it more
deeply till it is at or below perch level, at the same time giving a
waggling movement suggesting an exaggerated symbolic " bill-wiping "
and as he does this his head is turned rather more towards the female.
His head plumage is arranged to make a " triangular head 55 but this
is less marked than in waxbills ; his tail is twisted towards the female
but again less so than in the waxbills.
As my male began to display he commonly gave very excited-
sounding contact calls which become more intense as he adopted the
bent posture and turned to loud bill clicking which in turn gave way
to song as he neared the female. Often, the male began to display in
silence and sometimes the clicking notes were altogether omitted.
Always, however, the male sang as he began to draw himself more
erect in readiness to mount the female even if he had not sung before,
unless the female forestalled this (as she often did) by soliciting at an
earlier stage of the display. Once the male had begun this display
he would always respond to soliciting of the female by mounting her
immediately, even if this occurred before he had begun to utter bill
clicks or song.
The female's response to this display varies. Its most spectacular
form is when she adopts the same posture as the male and bounces

up and down also with the same head movements. As the pair come
together, or shortly after they have done so she goes from the bent over
posture into the usual solicitation posture of hen estrildines, crouching
horizontally with somewhat raised and quivering tail. The male
then mounts and copulates. I saw this behaviour on two occasions
from a pair of grey Java Sparrows kept in a window aviary by an
airline company in Bond Street. Owing to the plate glass I could not
hear if the female also called but she did not appear to do so. A pair
of White Java Sparrows owned by Radtke (1959) are said to have
invariably given this form of display and response in a completely
stereotyped manner. Another continental aviculturist who kept and
bred the white domestic form merely records the female as edging
along the perch towards the male, thus implying that she did not join
in the display (Kapzynski, 1961).
I never saw my female display in the same manner as the male in
response to his doing so although I watched a number of successful
copulations and many more attempts by the male (prefaced by display)
that came to nothing owing to the unco-operativeness of his mate.
If she was in the mood for copulation she would respond to his display
by hopping or sidling towards him and immediately solicit with
crouched posture and quivering tail. Often she did this the moment
the male began to display, even before he had got fully into the bent
over posture. If she was unwilling she would hop up to the male and
put her head over his as soon as he began to get ready to mount her or
even before, at other times she would hop away, stay where she was
and peck at the male's bill as he neared her, or simply take no notice
and then slip from under him when he tried to mount her.
Successful copulation was always followed immediately by aggressive
behaviour. Usually this was initiated by the female. As he dismounted
the male would adopt a rather upright posture (see sketch) similar
to that used when singing alone. The female would at once peck
fiercely at his bill and face. He would usually reply in kind and a brief
but fierce pecking match would ensue. Usually they pecked only at
each others bills and faces but in a very evidently " vicious " manner,
quite unlike the " pulled punch " pecking duels in which pairs of wax-
bills sometimes indulge. Sometimes they pecked at each other' feet
also, but not very often. As their aggression died down mandibulation
would replace pecking and the birds would then give the greeting
display. Often their anger would flare briefly again and they would
recommence fighting even after giving a loMdjitensity version of the
greeting display. On one occasion the male definitely started the post
copulation hostilities, pecking fiercely at the female before she made
a move to attack him. Similar post-copulatory aggression has been
recorded for the Spice Bird (Lonchura punctulata ) (Moynihan and
Hall, 1954).

the male when singing alone.
Whilst nesting and laying the female sometimes hopped up to the
male whirring her tail violently (the movement appearing to me
nearer to that made when drying after a bath than when soliciting)
and then put her head over his or else peck at his bill or feet. Some-
times this developed into an attack in which she chased the male about
the cage or room, sometimes the male would peck back at her. I had
the impression that this behaviour was caused by the female being
sexually aroused but the male failing to satisfy her by displaying. At
all events on the days when the female behaved in this manner she
responded immediately by soliciting if the male began his courtship
display. The female Canary often attacks her mate if he does not
respond to her sexual advances (Nicolai, i960). " Hell hath no fury..."
As in some other aspects of its voice and behaviour the Java Sparrow
apparently, however, shows considerable individual or racial variation
in its post-copulatory behaviour. Thus Radtke (1959) records that
his male always sang immediately after copulation. He does not
mention what the hen did but obviously the male could not have
sung had she attacked him. Kapzynski (1961), speaking of the white
form, says that the female pecks gently (italics mine) at the male's head
after copulation and that he " crouches patiently ". Obviously both
the above aviculturists must have owned Java Sparrows a good deal
less aggressive than mine !
Nesting
For nesting purposes my birds chose the longest, toughest and most
wiry of the many sorts of dead grasses I gave them. Long, thin, pliant
twigs of weeping birch were also readily taken. Soft or short grasses

were practically ignored. Some dead, tough bindweed vines were
taken very eagerly. A large, globular nest was built in the plastic
basket already mentioned. The cup of the nest lay very deep within
and was lined with feathers. Body feathers of domestic fowl and a few
pigeons' feathers were supplied. Fairly large, fluffy, white or nearly
white feathers were preferred.
So far as I saw only the male built the outer part of the nest. The female
would accompany him as he did so but never attempted to carry
anything to the nest. She may have done some arranging from the
inside but there was no proof of this. Both sexes, however, took feathers
to line the nest and continued to do so throughout the incubation
period. They showed no interest in bits of burnt wood as some estril-
dines do. All material was carried by one end in the usual estrildine
manner.

Parental Behaviour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998111535714286" page_id="56350117"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
Both sexes incubated and brooded. One bird was always present in
the nest (though probably not incubating) from the time the first egg
was laid. I did not record the periods for which each sat. They
relieved each other about every 20 to 30 minutes or even more often,
at least on those days or parts of days when I took note of them. When
off duty the male frequently sang except on the day before his death.
Behaviour towards doves
I have previously described (Goodwin, 1952) how the Java Sparrows
that I kept in my boyhood roosted under Turtle Doves (Streptopelia
turtur) that were kept with them. When the Turtle Doves were nesting
they would choose an incubating individual to roost under (probably
because it was easier to creep beneath) but at other times they would
roost alongside or (more often) between the legs of a dove roosting
in the ordinary way. Morris (1956) recorded similar behaviour
between Java Sparrows and Spotted Doves [Streptopelia chinensis ).
I have since discussed this matter with other aviculturists and those
of them who had kept Java Sparrows with doves of the genus Strepto-
pelia had all observed similar behaviour. One, whom I recently spoke
to, was keeping Java Sparrows with Spotted Doves and he found that
his birds tended to roost perched on the dove rather than against or
underneath it as would appear to be more usual.
Morris interpreted this behaviour as being due to the fact that the
dove's rounded form suggests the form of a fluffed out estrildine such
as others tend to clump with but being " bigger and better " it supplies
a super-normal stimulus. Kunkel (1959) criticised this interpretation
on the grounds that such an unselective " clumping " reaction would
be impossible in a wild state and suggested that the Java Sparrows
concerned are merely trying to keep warm. He points out that

<bodyText confidence="0.9867037" page_id="56350118"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
estrildines (or many of them) if very cold will clump together regardless
of species. My own experience, admittedly limited, of Java Sparrows
suggests that they do not clump very freely among themselves except
with their own mates. Moreover, Morris' Java Sparrows defended
" their " doves against rivals whereas had they been suffering from
cold one might have expected them to welcome anyone who wanted
to join the huddle. Estrildines will quite quickly learn to toast them-
selves by a light bulb, bar-heater or other source of artificial warmth
but the fact that all Java Sparrows appear to react to all Streptopelia
doves in the above-described manner seems to rule out acquired

behaviour or, at any rate, behaviour acquired subsequent to capture.
I consider it not impossible that wild Java Sparrows may exploit
some species of dove in this way. Observations on their behaviour
in a wild state are much to be desired. Aviculturists could, however,
provide information that would give much insight into this behaviour.
For example ; anyone who keeps Java Sparrows might be able to
answer one or more of these questions.
(1) Is this behaviour shown towards birds other than doves? (It
was not shown towards cockatiels, lovebirds and Rain Quails by some
Java Sparrows I observed kept with those species.)
(2) If more than one species of dove are kept with the Java Sparrows
which do they choose ? Are any species of doves not used (by Java
Sparrows known to exploit other doves).
(3) Do the white or pied domesticated Java Sparrows react in the
same way ?
(4) Does the reaction vary with temperature ?
(5) Is it also shown by breeding Java Sparrows ?
(6) Do Java Sparrows kept in hot countries (Africa, parts of
Australia) show this reaction ?

If any reader can supply answers to any of the above questions or
any other information on this or other aspects of Java Sparrow
behaviour it is much to be hoped that they will publish their
observations in our magazine.
Concluding Remarks
I think I have shown that although so common a bird in captivity
with us the Java Sparrow is of great interest and poses not a few
problems both in regard to its behaviour and, on a practical level,
in the matter of correct feeding. By this I mean a diet that will achieve
constant breeding success ; the adults are easy enough to keep in
apparent health when not breeding. Most of the successful breedings
of the wild form seem to have occurred in outdoor aviaries and often
without their owners being aware of exactly which of the available
foods the Javas were taking.
Although, as I have said, circumstantial evidence suggests that the

domesticated white and pied Java Sparrows are by no means so easy
to breed as they are usually stated to be, it is, nevertheless, clear that
they are very much easier than the wild form. They are also tamer
or at least less timid, from what little I have seen of them. It is very
likely that it would be possible by crossing domestic pied birds with
wild ones (carefully selecting the least timid individuals of the latter
form) to succeed in, eventually, producing wild-coloured Java Sparrows
that were relatively tame and would breed freely in captivity. Any
person with time, facilities and patience to embark on such a project
would, if successful, achieve a far more worthy end than the innumer-
able fanciers who spend time and money to produce ever more
monstrous macrocephaline Budgerigars or more distorted Canaries.

{Neophema petrophila)
By Hartley King (St. James, Western Australia)
I had a surprise breeding of my Rock Parrakeets (.Neophema petrophila )
this year (1962). I have had two pairs of these birds for four years now
and although they nested each year, nothing ever came of their efforts.
The first two years I had them in the finch aviary with a mixed collec-
tion of Australian finches ; the third year I housed them on their own ;
and this year they were in a large aviary 14 feet by 48 feet by 10 feet
high, together with two pairs of Bourkes, one pair of Regents, one pair
of Western Rosellas (Stanleys), two pairs of Cockatiels, a few doves and
a pair of Indian Peafowl. The aviary is covered in at both ends to a
depth of 6 feet and numerous nest-boxes were scattered about under
cover. I had given up the idea of breeding Rocks until such times
as I could provide a large slab of limestone in which was a suitable
cavity. This I intended to place under a dripping tap to supply
the moisture that I had become convinced was an essential. However,
I did have hopes that the Regents might go to next even though they
were but a year old, and to this end I placed a hollow log some 10 inches
in diameter and 4 feet long, at an angle of 30 degrees in the open flight,
and wrapped felt round the outside to afford some protection from our
hot summer sun.
Whilst the Cockatiels, Rosellas, Bourkes, doves, etc., went to nest in
various sites, not a single bird showed the slightest interest in my special
log. It so happened that the log was situated directly behind a large
lemon tree and it is my practice on hot days (which means almost
every day through the breeding season) to send a spray of water high
above the tree, which serves the dual purpose of watering the tree
and the surrounding plants and also allows the birds in the aviaries
round about to indulge in a shower if they so desire. Thus it came about
that the log was under a spray of water for an average of if hours
during the hottest part of the day.
Early in January I concluded that the log was not going to be used
and decided to take it down. I was just about to cut it down when
I was prompted to take a glance inside. I lifted the lid and lo and behold
there was a Rock hen with four little heads peeping through the
feathers. Needless to say I slipped the lid back on and scrambled down
smartly, after which I left things severely alone. Some ten days later
there were four fine young Rock Parrakeets flying about the aviary.
I will maintain the same conditions next year and keep a much closer
watch on the female Rock.
There are very large numbers of Rocks in Western Australia, mostly
on the off-shore islands or the rocky parts of the coastline south and
east to South Australia from a point about 100 miles north of Perth.
By the way, St. James is in the Perth metropolitan area 7 miles from
the centre of the city.

(.Psephotus haematogaster)
The second new species of Australian parrot presented by John
, Gould to the Zoological Society in London on 26th September, 1837,
was the Blue-bonnet. This bird was also placed in the genus Platycercus
with the remark that it was the most beautiful member of the genus
yet discovered. The red patch on the abdomen was the cause of its
being called Platycercus haematogaster. The species was later included
in Psephotus and Ps. haematogaster became established.
In 1912 Mathews created the genus Northiella for the Blue-bonnet.
It was noted that the species differed from other members of Psephotus
by having the first five wing primaries attenuated into spatulate tips.
Although this difference hardly warrants a generic differentiation, it
gains much importance when considered together with other distinc-
tions such as presence of blue cheek patches, larger and heavier bill,
larger general size with a more bulky appearance, and stronger call.
There does seem to be some justification for the separation but this
must be weighed against the convenience factor before any hasty ideas
are formed. Most taxonomists have come to the conclusion that it
is much more convenient to retain the Blue-bonnet as a member of
Psephotus and the author is in complete agreement with this decision.
Although not amongst the most brilliant of parrots, the Blue-bonnet
exhibits an extremely fascinating colour pattern and it impresses all
who meet with it. The adult male has the upper parts ash-brown with
the crown, face and cheek patches blue. The blue is much deeper, with
a mauve tint, on the forehead. The breast is of a lighter ash-brown colour
with the feathers having buff spots on them thus creating an overall
speckled appearance. The abdomen is yellow with a red centre patch.
The vent is yellow with a few faint red markings in some old birds.
The median wing coverts are olive coloured. The shoulders are
turquoise blue merging into a brilliant ultramarine blue on the primary
coverts. The rump and upper tail coverts are ash-brown with the
central tail feathers a somewhat darker shade of the same colour merging
with a dark blue on the outer edges. The secondary tail feathers are
lighter with more blue. The undersides of the tail feathers are white.
The female and immatures are somewhat lighter in general colour. It is
a medium-sized bird and a male taken by the author at Tero Creek in

Psephotus haematogaster is a bird of the interior and inhabits semi-arid,
arid, and desert areas. The distinct subspecies recognized correspond
roughly in distribution to these zones. The interior of southern
Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia constitute
the range of this species, while one isolated race inhabits an area in
Western Australia. Five subspecies have been described from within
this range, but the dismissal of one of these is here advocated.

Victoria, far western New South Wales and far south-western Queens-
land. It is by far the most common of the subspecies and enjoys the
widest range.
Considerable confusion was created at the turn of the century when
it was realized that Gould described the above race as the typical form
in 1837, but pictured the red-vented race in his Birds of Australia
published some twenty-five years later. Bonaparte, not realizing
Gould's error, immediately applied the name Ps. h. xanthorrhoa to the
yellow-vented form. This state of affairs existed until 1913 when
Mathews discovered the fault. Ps. h. xanthorrhoa was immediately
made a synonym for the typical yellow-vented race and the red-vented
form was named Ps. h. zanda. A short while later it was discovered
that, in spite of all the confusion, Gould had actually succeeded in
tabulating the red-vented race in 1865 and he was thus granted the
final honours.
Psephotus haematogaster haematorrhous was described by Gould in 1865.
This subspecies differs from the typical race in having the centre red
abdominal patch continue through the vent, and in having the inner
median and greater wing-coverts blood red. This beautiful and
distinctive race inhabits the semi-arid areas of southern Queensland
and New South Wales. The southern limit of the range of this race is
uncertain but records exist for Wellington, N.S.W., while the author
has observed it on many occasions a few miles north of Dubbo, N.S.W.
Intermediates between this and the typical form exist and one such
bird that the author observed in captivity was reported to have come
from twenty miles north of Leeton, N.S.W.
In 1912 G. Mathews described Ps. haematogaster alter from a specimen
taken at Murtoa in the Mallee area of Victoria. This race was reported
to differ from the typical form in its much larger size and in having
the under-tail-coverts greenish yellow. This latter colour difference
he altered to green in 1913. From all subsequent reports and personal
observations the author cannot agree with this colour distinction as
put forward by Mathews. Although there is a report of some immature
females from the South Australian Mallee areas having yellowish-
green under-tail-coverts, the universal colour for all adults from this
area is pale lemon-yellow. As regards the larger size the above state-
ment does not withstand investigation. Individual Blue-bonnets vary
somewhat in size and a standard larger size from this area does not
exist. A pair of birds belonging to this race was collected by a party,
of which the author was a member, at East Wellington, South Australia,
in March, 1962. The measurements obtained were as follows :--

JOSEPH M. FORSHAW-THE PARROTS OF AUSTRALIA
As one can see these birds were smaller than the typical Ps. h. haemato - 1
gaster whose measurements are given above. The conclusion the author
draws regarding this race is that, although a slight difference exists
in so far as the birds of the Mallee areas of Victoria and South Australia
are slightly paler in colour, the subspecies Ps. h. alter as described by
Mathews is not acceptable.
In 1891 T. Salvadori tabulated Ps. h. pallescens from a specimen 1
collected at Cooper's Creek, South Australia. This race is distinguished
by the very pale upper surface and breast, while the olive patch on
the median wing coverts is a more yellowish colour. This is a bird
of the desert regions of the Lake Eyre Basin, one of the driest areas of
Australia, and it illustrates clearly the effect of environmental factors
on the development of a species. This race is similar in its distinctiveness
to Ps. haematonotus caeruleus of the same area.
Psephotus haemato gaster narethae was tabulated by H. L. White as a
new species in 1921. It retained its specific rank for twenty years and
was then reduced to sub-specific status. White presented this subspecies
as a result of three skins collected by F. L. Whitlock at Naretha,
Western Australia. Four hundred miles of barren, waterless desert
isolates this distinct race from the eastern forms.
The Naretha Parrot or Little Blue-bonnet, as Ps. h. narethae is often
called, differs markedly from the typical race. A full description of
the male is the best means of illustrating the differences. The
measurements of the type specimens are as follows :--

The general colour above, including the greater portion of the head,
the fore-neck and chest, pale brown, becoming a greyish-olive on the
back. The rump and upper tail-coverts are a rich olive yellow. The
nape, hind-neck, throat and upper breast are mottled with a light buff.
The forehead and upper ear-coverts are a greenish-blue, changing to
a deep purplish-blue on the lower ear-coverts, which have an edging
of very pale yellow. This two-tone extensive facial colouring is markedly
different from that of the typical race. The abdomen is very deep
yellow with no red patch, while the flanks are washed with greyish
olive. The under tail-coverts are vermilion. Greenish-blue is the
colour of the lesser wing-coverts and shoulders. The outer median
wing-coverts are scarlet, while olive yellow is the colour of the inner
median and greater wing-coverts. The inner secondaries are also
olive yellow, while the outer secondaries, primary coverts and
primaries are ultramarine blue. The central tail feathers are dull

olive-green washed with blue, while the secondary tail feathers are
dull deep blue with white on the outer edges. Under the tail feathers
is white washed with blue. The sexual difference is more obvious with
this race than with Ps. h. haematogaster. The hen Ps. h. narethae is much
duller with the colours on the wings, ear-coverts and abdomen greatly
reduced. The smaller size of the female is also evident.
A bird of the semi-arid and arid areas, Ps. haematogaster is often
observed flying over heath, saltbush or spinifex plains or through
Mallee trees. The flight is undulating and not unlike that of the
Platycercus sp. except that the wings are left extended and not withdrawn
between wing beats. The birds generally fly quite close to the ground
rising over the higher bushes and dropping down immediately to the
lower level again. If the bush or Mallee gum is of comparatively large
size, the birds will swing to the side and straighten on the other
side. Frequently a small party of birds in flight will part on coming to
a Mallee gum, some going to the right, others to the left, and rejoining
once the tree has been bypassed. Both these methods of avoiding natural
obstacles, when in flight, have a certain fascination about them,
especially as the flashes of brilliant blue from the wings provide a
beautiful relief in what is often a desolate setting. Whilst in flight the
call is nearly always used.
The call note of this species is most distinctive and cannot be mis-
taken for any other parrot within its range. It somewhat resembles
the alarm call of the Rosellas but is of a sharper tone. A rough indica-
tion of the sound is given by placing one's hands on a medium sized
hand-bell and ringing it. A high pitched piping whistle is also
employed. Although this species generally feeds in silence sometimes
a chatter will be heard.
The food of the Blue-bonnet consists of seeds of grasses and other
plants and shrubs. Most of the seeds are procured on the ground and,
as the bird usually feeds under a tree or shrub or some such shaded
area, it is most difficult to observe without warning and usually a
person is not aware of its presence until he flushes it from the ground.
When running on the ground Ps. haematogaster has a most curious
upright stance and appears to stretch itself to its maximum height.
In some areas within the range of this species, the seeds of Saltbush
(.Atriplex vesicarum) and Bluebush ( Kochia sedifolia) are firm favourites.
A close examination of the crop of a bird taken at Moree, N.S.W. in
1909 revealed mainly small grass seeds supplemented by fragments of
stamens of flowers and pieces of charcoal.
Ps. haematogaster shows a marked preference for certain trees within
its range and so strong is this ecological factor that one can foretell
the occurrence of these birds merely by the vegetation. In some areas
false sandalwood (Myoporum platycarpum) is the favoured habitat while
in the more eastern areas Bull-oak or She-oak trees ( Casuarina sp.) and

JOSEPH M. FORSHAW-THE PARROTS OF AUSTRALIA
Native Pine (Callistris sp.) are the most popular. So noticeable is the
second as a favoured habitat that another name for this bird is Bull-oak
Parrot.
An interesting account of the relationship between Ps. h. narethae I
and the vegetation among which it lives was given by J. Galaby in !
1956. Two species of Acacias (A. sowdenii and A. aneura) were the
dominant trees in the locality while the single species of Gasuarina
(C. cristata) was really quite rare, generally occurring in scattered i
groves. It was found, however, that the Naretha Parrot did rely on I
these few Casuarinas because they were the only species in the area in !
which hollows formed.
Unlike most other broadtailed parrots this species is exceedingly 1
quiet while roosting during the heat of the day. Frequently when the ;
author has been seeking these birds he has almost given away the |
search when suddenly a party of Blue-bonnets will be literally stumbled ;
on as they roost in the centre of bush, shrub or small tree. When these ;
birds are aroused in such a manner they call excitedly and raise the i
feathers on their foreheads and crowns while the wings are raised in j
the folded position. The raising of the crown and forehead feathers is
most interesting and, because of the plumage on these parts, it is most
impressive with this species.
Although it does not associate in large flocks as does Ps. haematonotus ,
the Blue-bonnet is a comparatively common bird and most country
dwellers from the interior know it. Shearing quarters and storage
sheds generally have a couple of pairs of these birds in the near vicinity
while the dams on outback properties are visited twice a day by many
small parties.
Sexing Blue-bonnets in the field is a very difficult task, but when the
birds are in the hand a combination of differences will usually solve
the problem. The female is generally smaller in size, more slender
in build and duller in colour than her mate. The " wing-stripe " is a
valuable indication of sex with this species. Immatures show the
stripe but it tends to be less marked with the males. With the adult
bird the position is much clearer with most females retaining the stripe
and almost all males losing it. It is true that exceptions to these main
distinctions occur but when all the differences are taken and applied
together the risk of failing to distinguish the sexes is almost eliminated.
The activity of these birds increases as August inaugurates the
breeding season. The males can be observed displaying before their
mates on the branches of trees and bushes. The display is performed
by the male while in a very upright position. The wings are raised and
vibrated in the folded position, the head is held upright and bobbed
forward, while the tail is spread and moved quickly from side to side.
The interesting addition to the display of this species is that the feathers
of the forehead and crown are raised. Because of the plumage of the

head and facial parts of the Blue-bonnet this raising of the feathers
becomes the most striking feature of the display.
Both sexes take part in the selection of the nesting site, which is a
hollow limb or hole in the trunk of a tree. Except for the timber
bordering watercourses and dams, most trees in the areas frequented
by this parrot are relatively small. This results in most nesting hollows
being small cavities close to the ground. However, in many cases this
disadvantage is counterbalanced by the great depth of the nesting
hollow resulting in the nesting chamber being a considerable distance
from the entrance.
The bottom of the nesting hollow is lined with decayed wood and
eggs are deposited in a shallow excavation. Four to seven, usually
five, eggs form the clutch. The eggs are pure white, round in shape
with a smooth glossy surface. The average measurements of the eggs
are 0-94 by 0*83 inches. The eggs of Ps. haematogaster narethae are
slightly smaller than those of the other races. The average measure-
ments of these eggs are 0-89 by o * 72 inches. They also differ in being
dull without gloss and in having a rough surface. The eggs are laid
at forty-eight hour intervals and incubation commences with the laying
of the second egg. The hen only incubates and is fed by her mate
during the three weeks sitting. The female sits very tightly and the
author has found, during the examination of many nests, that she will
not leave until the very last minute.
Newly-hatched nestlings are naked and helpless and are closely
brooded by the female. Down quickly appears followed by the gradual
appearance of feathers. The cock bird, although not permitted to
feed the young until they are progressing favourably, is a most attentive
parent feeding the female who in turn feeds the regurgitated food to
her offspring.
Approximately four weeks after hatching the young leave the
nest and are fed by their parents until they become fully independent.
The young often remain with their parents for quite some time thus
accounting for the usual small parties observed.
Rarely is Ps. haematogaster double brooded but the breeding season,
which usually lasts from August to December, is often altered by the
rains and in this way some pairs will produce young twice in a year.
This correlation between climate and breeding times applies to a great
number of the birds inhabiting the interior parts of the continent.
Besides governing the breeding seasons, the climatic conditions also
have a marked effect on the general ecology of this species. In times
of drought the birds will often associate in flocks and move from the
drier areas towards the rivers and billabongs. This movement usually
brings them into contact with Ps. haematonotus and the two species will
occasionally join forces. Damage to grain crops frequently follows the

formation of these flocks especially if food is not plentiful as is often
the case in times of drought.
Because of its extremely spiteful disposition the Blue-bonnet is not
a popular aviary bird. It is very pugnacious and is quite capable of
killing other species much larger than itself. However, if housed
separately, this species is a most fascinating inmate with its constant
movements, most of which are executed in the characteristic jerky
manner, and playful actions. If swings and other objects are placed
in the aviary the birds will spend many hours with the plaything.
Successful breeding of this species in captivity is not an easy task.
Although it has been bred overseas on numerous occasions there are
few records for this country. It is not easy to obtain a suitable pair of
birds as some individuals are not kindly disposed towards others. Once
a pair have mated, however, they remain strongly attached to each
other.
Once the breeding pairs have been isolated two hollow logs or nesting
boxes should be provided. The cock bird will become increasingly
dominant over his mate and will chase her into the nesting hollows.
Once the hen has commenced incubation the pair should not be
disturbed as she will usually leave the eggs at the slightest interference.
This is in direct contrast to breeding in the wild state where the hen
sits very tightly.
Very few hybrids with this species have been recorded but the typical
race has often been crossed with the red-vented form. Intermediates
between these races do occur in the wild state.
The diet recommended for aviary birds is a mixture of plain canary
seed, sunflower, millet and a little hemp when this is available. A small
quantity of oats may be given but too much of this seems to be detri-
mental to the health of these birds. Sprays of seeding grasses and gum
tips are always appreciated. A plentiful supply of green food is essential,
while pieces of apple are often relished.
Although not amongst the brightest of the parrots, Ps. haematogaster
has numerous compensations that make it a most fascinating species.
A bright flash of colour as it flies over the semi-arid plains of the
interior, the Blue-bonnet brings life and brightness to a somewhat
desolate environment. It is still another gem in the wonderful avian
jewellery store--Australia.

BREEDING THE KURRICHANE THRUSH
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N.J., U.S.A.)

The Kurrichane Thrush --Turdus libonyanus --is resident over an
extensive area in Africa, ranging westward from Natal and the
Transvaal northward to the Sudan and westwards to Senegal. There
are several recognized races through this region the variations being
mainly in colouring and size, those of the east being generally richer
in colour and larger than the western races. The nominate race--
Turdus l. libonyanus --comes from Kurrichane, West Transvaal, but it is
with the eastern race --Turdus l. tropicalis --that we are concerned with
here.
Mr. Edward Marshall Boehm received four of these birds from
Mozambique in December, i960, and they were housed in reception
quarters until late February, 1961, and then released into a planted
aviary of some 40 feet by 16 feet. They are slightly smaller than the
nominate race, being about 8 inches in total length and the sexes are
alike. The top of the head, through the back, wings, and tail is
brownish-grey, the throat and belly being white. The chest is buffish-
grey with black streaks on the side of the throat and neck. The flanks
and under-wing feathers are a deep yellowish buff, the legs and feet
being flesh to pale yellow in colour. The bill is bright orange and the
eye is brown with a fine yellow line encircling it. There is a narrow
pale-buff superciliary eye-stripe running from the base of the upper
mandible, over the eye, to the back of the head.
As is customary with all the birds in the Boehm collection, they had
been banded with different colours prior to being transferred to the
aviary in which they lived amicably with a diverse assortment of other
birds. This included pairs of Ross's Touracos, Black-headed Orioles,
Silver-blue Tanagers, Black-headed Sugarbirds, Black-throated
Cotingas, and Red and White Crakes and some half-a-dozen or so
single birds of other species. Incidentally, the pair of Black-headed
Sugarbirds had been bred on the establishment in 1961, each bird
from different stock, and they themselves reared young, in the aviary
now being dealt with, in 1962 thus giving Mr. Boehm a third generation
of this species.
However, to return to the Kurrichanes, a further specimen
received from the same source in September, 1961, was allotted its
coloured leg-band and sent in to join the others of its like. Careful
watch was maintained for the first few days to ensure that it was
accepted for, so often, when a new member of a species is introduced
amongst settled birds, conflict is experienced. In this instance all went
well and the five birds got along together although it was noticed that,
unlike the majority of thrushes of other species spread throughout the
numerous Boehm aviaries, these birds never became very tame,

spending the major part of their days hiding in the hemlock trees and
ilex bushes. This skulking habit of theirs gave value to the system of
colour banding for, without this means of identification, it would have
been virtually impossible to maintain a check on them, for seldom
were all five to be seen at one and the same time.
In view of their apparent liking for the trees, nest-baskets were
secured in various positions in the hope that they would be made use
of. If this hope had been pinned solely on the thrushes it would have
been doomed to disappointment, for they completely ignored them.
One of the nests, however, was made use of by the Red and White
Crakes, but that is a separate story that has been recounted in the
November-December, 1962, issue of the Avicultural Magazine.
It was in March, 1962, that the latest arrival of the Kurrichanes was
seen to be carrying nesting material up to a 2-inch ledge above the
entrance door to the aviary. This obviously was totally inadequate, so
an open-fronted box of 8 inches by 6 inches, with a 2-inch front and
6-inch sides, was fixed at the chosen site. The top was made with
a 2-inch overhang so as to give full protection from the moisture
drippings from the Visqueen covered roof and to act as a deterrent to
other birds. The box was accepted immediately, the final nest being of
typical thrush construction with its mud and coarse grass base and
surround, the whole being lined with fine grasses, pieces of wool, and
feathers. A clutch of three eggs was produced over nth-13th April,
but these proved to be clear and were deserted. They were pale
bluish-green in ground colour, finely speckled and spotted all over with
pinky-brown, and measured 26 mm by 18-5 mm. A further clutch was
laid in May and this time two did hatch but the chicks lived for two
days only. A final effort in June was made, but the eggs were deserted
after about ten days of sitting.
In the meantime, however, another pair had selected a site about
half-way along the side of the aviary, again on a 2-inch ledge. Another
nest-box was placed there and, as with the former pair, the birds took
to it right away and produced a clutch of three clear eggs in May.
On 3rd June, another egg was laid followed by two more on the next
succeeding days. Incubation, which was shared, began with the laying
of the first egg and lasted fourteen days, the first chick hatching on the
17th and the last on the 19th. The nestlings were covered with gingery
coloured down and had bright orange gapes. Their eyes were open at
six days by which time quill feathers were showing in their wings. This
trio never looked back, the parents being most assiduous in their care
of them and the first one vacated the nest on 1st July, being followed
by its nest mates on the 3rd and 5th respectively.
Their upper plumage was greyish-brown, like the adults', but the
breast was buff, heavily spotted in dark brown, the abdomen was white
and the bill dark coloured. There was very little sign of the rich

buff-yellow in the flanks, these being flecked with brown. At fourteen 1
days after leaving the nest they were feeding themselves and their bills
were now yellow. It was not until they were some thirteen weeks old that
the spottings and fleckings had disappeared from the breast and flanks ,
and they now resembled their parents in colouring, but were i
slightly smaller. Needless to say they had been banded as soon as they
left the nest and this artificial means of identification is now the only
means by which they can be told apart from the adult birds.
Their food throughout the rearing period had consisted of our own
brand of soft-food mixture, ground raw beef heart and a surfeit of
live-food in the form of mealworms, earthworms, and gentles. Since
the advent of the young birds the others have become much tamer and
it is a common sight to see the entire eight of them foraging about in
the Ground Ivy and around the roots of the various trees and shrubs.
They are all living together in perfect accord and no action is intended
to split them up. We do at least know now the sexes of four of them
and hope that, in time, we will be able to accurately record the sex of
the remaining adult and the young birds.
Although the Kurrichane Thrush is a fairly common bird within its
native habitat, I have not been able to find any record of their breeding
in captivity prior to that described above. If such does prove to be the
case it would seem that yet another " first " has been accomplished by
Mr. Boehm.

This was a most remarkable exhibition. Increased entry fees might
have caused a serious drop in numbers, but in fact the drop was quite
small and only really high quality exhibits were on show. Appalling
weather might have meant a fiasco, but there were amazingly few
absentees and the birds seemed quite undaunted by the fog and cold.
In the Foreign Section the exhibits were all in fine condition and
there were some first-class specimens on view. In spite of having
had a most worrying time with electricity failures in her aviaries,
Mrs. Scamell staged a splendid team in immaculate condition,
ranging from the Fire-Finches which won the first class and the special
for the first three classes to her magnificent Toco Toucan which
looked as perfect as ever.
There were few rarities in the seed-eater classes but the standard
was consistently high---class specials to Mrs. White's White Java
Sparrows, K. Lawrence's Queen Whydahs and C. W. Stevens' Melba
Finches were all well deserved. Best Large Seed-eater special went to

Seed-eaters to W. Langberg's really lovely Grenadier Waxbills. The
class for Gouldian and Parrot finches was outstanding, containing
several pairs of Parrot Finches, Red-headed, Blue-faced and Peale's,
all in sparkling condition ; good Red-headed and Yellow-headed
Gouldians and some nice Pintailed Nonpareils. The small A.O.S.
class was good ; besides W. Langberg's winning Grenadier Waxbills
this consisted of several pairs of Rhodospingus ; Schlegel's and Peter's
Twinspots, Red-crested Finches, a Hooded Siskin, Pytilias and Blue-
capped Cordon Bleus.
The insectivorous classes showed few absentees and contained many
lovely specimens. It was a pity that Mrs. Dineen's Rifle Bird was alone
in its class as this was a most interesting exhibit. Mrs. Dineen first
showed it five years ago when immature and this is the first time it has
come into colour although not yet quite in full plumage. I hope that
by next year it will have rewarded its owner's patience and care by
achieving perfection. There were three charming hummingbirds
staged, first the delightful Gould's Heavenly Sylph which won the
Supreme Award and several other trophies for J. Forest--this was in
splendid condition but the lighting where it was staged did not do full
justice to its sheen and colouring. Next came Mrs. Scamell's Violet-
eared in perfect order, and a lovely little Heine's belonging to R. E.
Oxley. A glorious sunbird class was led by Mrs. Scamell's Splendid,
a very handsome bird, followed by Mrs. Draper's immaculate Golden-
winged, Mrs. Scamell's well-known pair of Yellow-backed (one of the
most charming of all sunbirds to my mind), two Wedgetails, Amethysts
and a Bronze. The sugarbirds were really good, first was E. T. Hawes'
Red-thighed, then Clare and Howard's pair of Purples, G. Anderdon's
Red-thighed, several Isthmian, Purple and Yellow-bellied. The small
tanager class had unfortunately several absentees, those present were
Mrs. Kent's Black-throated which won the class, R. F. Dudman's
Mrs. Wilson's, E. M. Beale's Blue-naped Euphonia and Mrs. Scamell's
Flame-headed ; this last attracted me very much although it has a
slightly soft-feathered appearance which I am told is natural to it.
Several of the large tanager and bulbul class were also missing, but
Mrs. Scamell's Coral-billed Bulbuls would have been hard to beat in
a much larger class. These were followed by G. Anderdon's Blue
Mountain Tanager in perfect condition, a Black Bulbul, Palm and
Silver-blue Tanagers, and A. V. Griffiths' Yellow-crowned Bulbul
which should be a most attractive bird when in full condition.
The flycatcher class was fascinating ; first were Mrs. Scamell's
beautiful pair of Paradise Flycatchers, in faultless plumage and shown
together for the first time ; Mrs. Scamell showed the hen two years
ago and the cock won best foreign at Olympia last year. A lovely
Blue-fronted Redstart and a Daurian Redstart won second and third
places for Mrs. Scamell, followed by an Indian Blue Chat, a pair of

<bodyText confidence="0.99458525" page_id="56350136"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
Blue-naped Flycatchers and a Loo Choo Robin. The only two entries
in the thrush class were Blue-headed Rock Thrushes, the winners being
Mrs. Scamell's breeding pair and the second a fine cock belonging to
Mrs. Draper. A good starling class went to B. C. Davies' quite lovely
pair of Amethysts, which won the Best Large Insectivorous special ;
there were also some good Spreos, a Red-shouldered Glossy, Purple-
headeds and Pagodas. A fine pair of Rothschild's Grackles won the
mynah class for Mrs. Scamell from two good Hill Mynahs and a
Common Mynah. The Toucans and Touracos were magnificent, not
a very large class but full of quality. Here Glare and Howard's Curl-
crested Toucans were placed first, quite fascinating birds but in rather
rough feather. This is the first time I have seen them, and their tight
black curls give them a most quaint appearance. Mrs. Scamell's
superb Toco Toucan came second, J. W. Ransom's handsome Buffon's
Touracos third and his Red-billed Toucan sixth, with Mrs. Draper
winning fourth and fifth with a Pink-crested Touraco and a Toco
Toucan. I thought this Touraco quite charming and it must be a lovely
sight in an aviary. Doves and quail were rather disappointing with
several absentees ; G. Anderdon's Mourning Dove won over pairs of
Diamond, Barbary and Snow-white Doves and Chinese Painted Quail.
The small A.O.S. insectivorous class as usual held some delightful
exhibits. Mrs. Scamell won with a fascinating newcomer described as
a Yellow Warbler. Full of life and colour, this bird has the charac-
teristics of a warbler but in spite of strenuous research has so far not
been identified. Next came Mrs. Scamell's lively little Red-headed
Tits and her beautiful pair of Small Minivets, some Yuhinas and a
Blue-winged Siva. Medium-sized A.O.S. class went to Mrs. Scamell's
Himalayan Ruby-throats, an interesting exhibit as the pair consisted
of father and daughter, the latter bred this year. Next came Digby
Stuart College's good Blue-cheeked Barbet, a Hangnest, a pair of
Malayan Starlings and two more Blue-cheeked Barbets. The large
A.O.S. class contained Clare and Howard's Orange Cock-of-the-Rock,
an Occipital Blue Pie, Tree Pies and a Red-billed Magpie.
It was a pity that in the parrotlike classes some interesting exhibits
were missing, but according to the judge, W. R. Partridge, the quality
was extremely good. In the Peach-faced, Fischer's and Masked
Lovebird class, Mrs. Duggan's excellent pair of Masked came first and
went on to win Best Lovebirds. In the A.O.S. lovebirds and parrotlet
class a fine cock Abyssinian won for D. R. House ; there were no
parrotlets entered. K. Lawrence's Mitchell's Lorikeets won their class

from Mrs. Duggan's Swainson's. The cockatoo and macaw class was
won by G. Anderdon's Roseate Cockatoos, followed by his Citron-crest
and A. W. Bolton's Noble Macaws ; the Roseates went on to win the
Duke of Bedford Memorial Trophy for Best Parrotlike. The next
class consisted of A. W. Bolton's Rock Peplars and L. G. Stevenson's

Crimson-winged, both pairs in shining condition but the Rock Peplars
slightly the more perfect. There was only one exhibit staged in the
grass parrakeet class, H. Willis' Bourke's, and only three in the broad-
tail class, H. Willis's Pennant's and Redrumps first and third,
G. Anderdon's cock Pennant's second. A. W. Bolton's fine pair of Cocka-
tiels won their class, and E. A. Dracup's Canary-winged Conures won
that for Ringnecks and Conures from A. W. Bolton's Golden-flanked, a
pair of Sierra Parrakeets, a Patagonian Conure and some Ringnecks.
The parrot class went to Mrs. Draper's fine pair of Ruppell's (I cannot
remember seeing these birds ever beaten), with her Little Dusky
Parrot second and J. P. George's Green Amazon third. There were
also several Black-headed Caiques, a White-bellied Caique, a Primrose-
cheeked Amazon, an African Grey and several Senegals.
The class for hybrids and abnormal coloured birds was interesting.
This was won, for the sixth year in succession I believe, by Mrs. Lewis'

I cannot end without a word of appreciation to the L.C.C. Parks

Last year I called their display an inspiration ; this year it was
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.95769045" page_id="56350137"  page_num="85" year="" vol="">
doubly so. Both sides of the gallery aisle were laid out in charming
water gardens and shrubberies, one pool complete with the now
famous Flamingos and the other with a pair of Crowned Cranes ;
these were flanked by aviaries full of colour and a most effective tree
in which two gorgeous macaws played happily at liberty. There was
also a cageful of monkeys to delight the crowd, and two large pens--
one full of rabbits and guinea-pigs with the most ridiculous hairstyles
and the other holding the Parks' two Shetland foals, Minicab and
Miniminor by name. I cannot help wondering if Raymond himself
is going to break these to saddle !
Another last word--we are apt to take for granted the magnificent
organization behind the Exhibition, but this year I must offer my
humble appreciation and thanks to the officials and staff for the cheerful
way they carried on in spite of frightful journeys and very little sleep.
And lastly, what a disappointment it was not to see Allen Silver.
I believe this to be the first National Show he has missed and we
certainly missed him ! I am surprised that such a young and vigorous
man could be kept away and we all look forward to seeing him
next year.
S. M. Anderdon.

BIRDS IN THE JERSEY ZOOLOGICAL PARK
By Kenneth Smith
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962282634146342" page_id="56350138"  page_num="86" year="" vol="">
Gerald DurrelPs Zoo Park in Jersey has a very interesting collection
of birds, and during the four years of its existence quite a number of
unusual species have been exhibited there. Numerous specimens have
come as gifts, others have been purchased from collectors and dealers,
but many of the best exhibits are the results of DurrelPs own zoological
collecting expeditions to the tropics. Indeed, one of the main purposes
of establishing his own zoo was his resolve to fulfil his ambition to
keep for himself, rather than send to other zoos, the wealth of animal
life he collected over the years.
When I left Paignton Zoo towards the end of 1948 to build the
Jersey Zoo, Durrell and his wife were leaving Britain for a collecting
trip in Argentina, but already on deposit at Paignton were many of
the animals that they had collected during their last trip to the
Gameroons. These formed the nucleus of the Jersey Zoo and were
shipped aboard the S.S. Sambur at Weymouth on the last day of
November. The " zoo ship " arrived in St. Helier harbour the next
morning, causing much excitement to the islanders--particularly to
the children and young people, many of whom had never visited a zoo !
Among the Cameroon birds were Sunbirds, Mousebirds, a very
tame Pied Crow, a Woodford's Owl, a trio of White-faced Scops
Owls, an African Hobby ( Falco cuvieri), an African Hawk-Eagle
(.Hieraaetus fasciatus) and a pair of Verreaux's Touracos ( Turacus
verreauxi) . The birds were in good condition and steady, as they had
been at Paignton Zoo for nearly two years, but at Jersey I had to put
them into temporary accommodation while the construction of a bird
room and aviaries proceeded. In passing I must mention that the birds
had some remarkable amphibians as travelling companions to Jersey.
These were Hairy Frogs ( Trie hob atrachus robustus ) that Durrell had
captured in the fast flowing streams in the Bafut highlands.
In June, 1959, three months after the zoo was opened to the public,
Durrell returned from South America. His collection was rich in birds.
There were Coscoroba Swans, Black-necked Swans, Crested Screamers,
a Chimango Hawk ( Milvago chimango) , and two Seriemas--one Crested
( Cariama cristata ), the other an example of the rarer Burmeister's species,
(Chunga burmeisteri.) Choice items were a pair of Yellow-naped
Macaws (Ara auricollis) and some Sierra Parrakeets ( Amoropsittaca
aymara) , also a wonderful pair of Great Grebes ( Aechmophorus major)
which, unfortunately, did not live long in Jersey. Also noteworthy
was a tame Tucuman Amazon Parrott ( Amazona tucumana) named
Blanco. In his book " The Whispering Land " Durrell describes this
handsome species as being " unusual in European collections ".

Other Argentine birds included an Ovenbird, two Red-breasted
Marsh-birds, a Pigmy Owl and a Burrowing Owl, some Pileated Jays,
two Red-gartered Coots and four White-breasted Rails, and a pair
of Grey-necked or Hoary necked Guans (Ortalis canicollis). The Guans
were ridiculously tame, and they still welcome human company by
flying to the front of the aviary to greet zoo visitors with a high-pitched
and somewhat raucous cackling.
Jersey Zoo has a good range of aviaries for birds of prey. Eagles
shown are Wedge-tailed, Wahlberg's, Tawny, Bateleur, a Cassin's
Hawk-Eagle and an immature Martial Eagle. The Martial Eagle was
brought from Africa by Jeremy Mallinson, a member of the zoo staff,
who spent four months in Bechuanaland during 1962. He also collected,
mainly in N'gamiland, two young Ostriches, three Marabou Storks,
a pair of Spur-winged Geese, a group of Red-billed Francolins, a
Yellow-billed Kite and three species of Vulture, namely White-headed,
White-backed, and a single specimen of the very large Lappet-faced
or Black Vulture (Tor go s tracheliotus ). Owls are represented by the
Malayan Fish-Owl, Virginian Eagle-Owl, Fraser's Eagle-Owl, Barn
Owl, Tawny Owl, Little Owl, and a young Spectacled Owl which
recently arrived from British Guiana, in addition to the owls mentioned
as being part of Gerald Burrell's collections.
Although the zoo is only about five acres in extent it has a number
of sizeable grass paddocks and a lake of a considerable area. The
Ostriches occupy a large open enclosure, with a big indoor area adjacent
for dull and cold weather. Sarus, Crowned and Demoiselle Cranes,
Red-breasted Geese, Barnacle Geese and Upland Geese are displayed
in naturalistic surroundings, while Blue Eared Pheasants and a Grey-
winged Trumpeter enjoy complete liberty in the zoo grounds.
The tropical bird house and numerous large aviaries are populated
by a wide variety of species, too many to list in full. Among the more
interesting are Boatbill Herons, a Hammerkop, a fine pair of Crested
Wood Partridges, two Toucan Barbets, a Rice Grackle, a Chough and
a Raven, and a breeding colony of Fischer's Lovebirds. Valuable new
additions, resulting from Gerald Durrell's recent journeys through
New Zealand, Australia and Malaya, are a pair of Keas (obtained
through the good offices of the Auckland Zoo) and five Blue-crowned
Hanging Parrots.
About 250 different species of wild birds have been recorded in the
Channel Islands, and quite a number of orphaned and injured birds
have been brought to the zoo for attention. These have included
several Barn Owls (the commonest owl in the Islands), a single Tawny
Owl (extremely rare here !), four Water Rails, a Snipe, two Corn-
crakes, a Golden Plover, a Grey Phalarope, four Kingfishers, several
Kestrels and two Sparrow Hawks. The Sparrow Hawks were released
in the open country around the zoo.

As these notes are written, on 14th February, arctic weather is still
with us and conditions are far from pleasant. Luckily there has not
been a great deal of wind, which is so much more deadly than intense
still cold. Compared with other parts of the country, snow has not
been a major problem, though a certain amount of propping of flights,
as a precautionary measure, has been done.
Arrivals during the past two months have been few. We were pleased
to receive a pair of Lesser Snow Geese, presented by Mr. Frank
Mosford ; the male being the blue form and the goose the white.
Another gift we were glad to get was a Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo,
as we had no specimen of this attractive little Psittacine in the collection.
Two common Buzzards, found half-starved in North Wales, have
made a welcome addition to our large Bird of Prey flight.
Inappropriate though it may be to mention births in the present
weather conditions, it is interesting to record that on 4th January,
another Scaly-breasted Lorrikeet left the nest-box in the open flight.
When the nest-boxes were being taken down in late September, it was
found that this particular one had two eggs in it, which from their
appearance were close to hatching. They were the third clutch of the
pair concerned, and without much hope it was decided to leave the
nest-box where it was. Both hatched, and as recorded above, one
survivor appeared early in the year. It was immediately placed in
the indoor shelter with its parents and is doing well.
The three new enclosures mentioned in an earlier article are now com-
pleted, and a few birds are already installed, including a pair of Black
Swans, a pair of Sarus Cranes, and a group of seven Grey-necked
Crowned Cranes and three Black-necked Crowned Cranes, together
with a number of cock Pheasants. The Cranes are for the moment
confined to barracks in the very comfortable shelters provided and
should make a very fine show when, weather permitting, they are given
the freedom of these very large enclosures.

in 1933 has died. Its age at the time of arrival is not known, nor is the
age of a recently deceased Donaldson Smith's Turaco which came in

Three species new to the collection have been received. They are
a Bourcier's Barbet ( Eubucco bourcieri), a Tinkling Grass Warbler
(Cisticola tinniens), both presented by Capt. R. S. de Q,. Quincey and
a White-chinned Thrush ( Turdus aurantius) given by G. H. and J. R.
Newmark.
The specimen of Bourcier's Barbet, a male, was of the normal green
on back and wings, with a red head and pale yellow and white under
parts at the time of its importation. Now its plumage is much faded,
possibly due to a carotenoid pigment deficiency in its diet. There may
be some Old World Barbets whose colours change for this reason, but
I cannot think of any. Eubucco bourcieri ranges from Costa Rica to Peru,
seven races being recognized.
The genus Cisticola has not previously been represented in the
collection. There are some forty species in this genus (as many as
seventy-five according to some recently published estimates) only two
of them being found outside Africa, Madagascar and neighbouring
islands. One of these, the Fan-tailed Warbler, ranges from southern
Europe, throughout Africa to eastern Asia and northern Australia.
Males of many species have conspicuous courtship displays, one species
being known as the Cloud-scraper or Wing-snapping Cisticola, for the
male flies to a considerable height and makes a snapping noise in the
course of his evolutions. The nests, sometimes open, sometimes domed,
according to the species, are built in grass or other low-growing
vegetation and in some cases, if not all, the lining of plant down is
added to, even during the incubation and sometimes after the eggs have
hatched.
Some species are brood parasitized by whydahs and the Parasitic
Weaver ( Anomalospiza) . The habitat is grassland, scrub, bush or savannah
woodland as well as swamp and rocky country and the birds are
insectivorous. In some there is an eclipse and a breeding season
plumage.
The White-chinned Thrush, a native of Jamaica, is said to be
frequently seen by roadsides and in gardens, particularly at higher
altitudes.
Other arrivals of particular interest are three Red-wattled Lapwings

<reference confidence="0.71097325">
(.Lobivanellus indicus), four Green-winged Doves, six White-eared Fruit
Doves, a Brown Hawk Owl ( JVinox scutulata) and a Blue-fronted

Preston in Sussex was sent and is so far thriving.

the Adelaide Zoological Gardens during the 1961-62 season. Possibly
the most important event from the display point of view was the
rearing of four Mute Swans : two were reared in 1959-60, and one in
1960-61. The Mute Swan is a rare bird in captivity in Australia,
although it does occur in small numbers in a more or less wild state in
Western Australia and Tasmania where it has been introduced.

The Chester Zoological Gardens were still but recently founded
when, in April, 1940, there occurred a remarkable event. This was
the nesting of the pair of Griffon Vultures. Vice-President G. S.
Mottershead described the rearing of the young one in the Magazine,
1941. It is very pleasing to be able to record that this bird, which has
the distinction of being the only one of its kind to be bred in Great
Britain, and nearing twenty-three years of age, is flourishing and is in
splendid condition.

According to Roy P. Cooper, Emu , 1962, p. 212, the original male
is now fourteen and a half years old, and the female died at the age of
nine years and eight months ; at the time of her death she was brooding
three eggs. Of the young retained by Burnett, one is seven and several
are six years old. In their first nest a hybrid pair hatched a young one
that lived for twenty-seven days, but the eggs in all subsequent nests
have proved infertile.

THE BIRDS OF SIKKIM. By Salim Ali. Oxford University Press,

1963. Price 526^. net.
As might be expected from India's leading ornithologist, Salim Ali,
this is a first-class book on the birds of Sikkim--to quote the author's
own description--a vertical strip of extremely rugged montane
country 40 to 60 miles broad and about 100 miles deep, wedged in
between the Himalayan States of Nepal in the west and Bhutan on the
east. In the introduction the author gives a graphic and concise
description of the area. He states that the abrupt telescoping of the
terrain--from the hot steamy foot-hill valleys to the arctic cold of the
snow-capped peaks--which has produced the marked altitudinal
zonation in the rainfall, humidity, climate, and vegetation is also
responsible for the great variety and numerical abundance of the
resident bird life, making Sikkim perhaps the richest area of its size
anywhere in the world.
Over 400 species of birds are described in detail, including field
characters, status and habitat, distribution outside Sikkim, general
habits, nesting, and racial characteristics, measurements, etc. The
book is illustrated with seventeen coloured plates, depicting 140 species,
by Paul Barruel, David Reid-Henry, and Robert Scholz in the
traditional high standard of these bird artists, and beautifully repro-
duced. In addition there are thirty-six black and white drawings by
Paul Barruel and Walter Ahrens, and a number of photographic
illustrations which give an excellent idea of the various habitats.
It is regrettable that the index falls far below the standard of the
rest of the book.

THE BIRDS OF CHESHIRE. By T. Hedley Bell. John Sharratt
and Son, Altrincham, 1962. Price 30 j. net.
Though, as the author points out, the ornithology of Cheshire has
been well documented, especially by the late T. A. Coward and
Charles Oldham, their last work was published in 1910. The purpose
of the present work is to publish all records and information since 1910
and the author gives full credit to those from whom he obtained data,
in particular the late A. W. Boyd.
He includes a history of recording, coverage by recorders, and
a topography in which he gives an account of the changes since the
publication of Coward's book. This is followed by summaries of related
species and a systematic list of 289 species and sub-species found in the
county, in which an attempt is made to give an assessment of the status

areas in the county showing the widely differing habitats but the
illustrations of birds are confined to six species. Three of these are
recent additions to the breeding birds of Cheshire, the Collared Dove,
Pied Flycatcher, and Little Ringed Plover. There are also three
illustrations of Wilson's Phalarope, believed to be the first photographs
taken in Britain of this rare American species. A clear and helpful map
completes the book.

THE CONDITION OF AVIARY BIRDS DURING THE EXCEPTIONALLY
SEVERE WEATHER IN JANUARY, 1963
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989411138888889" page_id="56350146"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
It may be interesting to put on record experiences during the recent cold spell.
On 22nd, 23rd and 24th January, the minimum temperatures here were --3 0 F.,
i* F., and --1* F. respectively, and were still as low as this at 8 a.m. the following
iar\r npQtinrr nrA\ rt=&amp;gt;r\ mnfp manorniotp to cnnp untn onr&amp;gt;h eonnitmno
mornings. My aviary heating proved quite inadequate to cope with such conditions.
The small bird quarters have wooden shelters 4 feet square by 6 feet high. Each
has a half-kilowatt heater. The inside temperature fell to 27*F.; Hunting Cissa,
White-crested Laughing Thrushes, three species of Glossy Starling and various
whydahs, waxbills and foreign finches were, as far as I could tell, not in the least
inconvenienced.
Four Crowned Cranes were in a shelter 8 by 8 by 8 feet made of concrete blocks and
with one kilowatt heating. Here the temperature fell to 20* F. but there was no sign
of frost-bite on legs or feet.
Flamingoes were in a wooden shed without heat but with straw over peat on the
floor. Here the minimum temperature was 5 0 F. and so far they seem none the worse.
Lilford and Demoiselle Cranes were in the open and did not even make use of a
roofed shelter of wattle hurdles. They have survived 35 0 of frost-- -- 3*F,
without any apparent discomfort. Maybe they would not have fared so well if there
had been any wind. Conditions were calm throughout.
I have had no losses amongst waterfowl. It seems curious, however, that they eat
much less in really cold weather than normally.
Lady Amherst's, Silver and Golden pheasants and a Blue Crossoptilon were quite
happy in the open with only rather sparse shrubs for cover.

How our birds have survived this winter I do not know, but they all appear to be as
cheerful and fit as usual. We had 20 degrees of frost and deep snow on the aviaries so
that for weeks the birds never really saw daylight ; their food froze as well as their
drinks, nectar as well as water. None of the outdoor aviaries have any heat and the
parrakeet aviaries have very little shelter, but the birds seemed absolutely immune to
cold. We have mynahs, a toucanette, a mountain tanager, a redstart, doves and
seedeaters outside. Indoors we could not get the birdroom above 40 degrees when the
power cuts were on, and the birds were as happy as can be. I also had flocks of
wild birds to feed ; they all lined up in trees waiting for me. Masses of Chaffinches

Greater-spotted Woodpeckers, Rooks, Jays (one I believe to be one I brought up by

really cold weather and still feed them once or twice a day.

In "News and Views" in the January-February, 1963, number of
the Magazine it was reported that a pair of Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasants
had been received by the Berlin Zoo (West). The birds were in fact
received by the Berlin Zoo (East) and the Editor much regrets this
mistake.

(Odontospiza caniceps )
By W. Langberg (Copenhagen, Denmark)
The African Weaver Finch Odontospiza caniceps has popularly been
called Grey-headed Silverbill, in English as well as in German. Recent
scientific investigations made by the well-known Swiss ornithologist
Professor Dr. Hans Steiner in Zurich, show that this species is, however,
closely related to the Bronze Mannikins ( Spermestes ) and not to the
Silverbills ( Euodice ). In the Estrildidae, now usually considered as a
family and not, as earlier, a sub-family of the Ploceidse, weavers, the
different palate markings of the nestling young have been considered
as the main guide in the determination of the relationship between the
different genera. There is a pronounced identity between the palate
markings of the young of the Spermestes-species and Odontospiza , not
occuring in any other species of Estrildidae, and quite different from
those of Euodice. As a result of his examinations Professor Steiner
considers Odontospiza as a sub-genus of Spermestes. Professor Steiner
therefore suggests the name Perlhals-Amadine in German for this
species. (Translated into English " Pearl-throated Mannikin ".) This
decision was arrived at from examination of newly hatched young,
partly supplied by me, partly from his own birds, as well as both his and
my observations of the birds' behaviour and my descriptions of the
colour of young birds.
The length of the bird is about 4 inches, and it is slim and elegant in
shape. There is some resemblance in colour to the Parson Finch,
except for the small feathers reaching from below the eye over the
cheeks and the throat, which are of a pearl-like colour instead of white.
The head is dark grey, this colour reaching right down to the back.
The chest is of a warm brown colour, toning lighter on the belly. The
back is also brown, rump, upper and under tail-coverts being white.
Primaries, secondaries, and tail feathers are black. The upper mandible
is dark grey, the under mandible somewhat lighter. The legs are dark
horn coloured. The eyes black.
Two consignments, I believe about 200 birds in all, reached
Switzerland in September-October, 1961. They were offered as a first
importation, but according to Mr. Yealland of the London Zoo, they

were imported in 1929-30 by De Von, and four specimens were in the
Regent's Park Zoo at that period. {Foreign Birds, May-June, 1962.) As
far as he knows the species has not bred in England, and he does not
know whether the species had even been bred in captivity.
The two consignments were imported at the request of Professor
Steiner by the Zurich bird dealer Theodor Waech, who, with the
assistance of Mr. Surber of the same town, found a collector in
Mozambique willing to catch the birds in question. Professor Steiner
was anxious to obtain live birds of this species for studies of their
behaviour, palate markings of the young (which were not earlier
known), and other characteristics of the species, in order to reach a
final decision as to their relation to other species and hence their
correct place in systematics. No doubt this importation would not have
taken place, if the birds had not been important to fill a gap in Professor
Steiner's systematic studies, and we owe him our thanks for the great
efforts he made to find a collector in Africa, interested in the matter.
I am glad to state that these efforts have not been made in vain and
that the systematic position of Odontospiza caniceps now seems to be
settled.
About 1 st November, 1961, I got a consignment of these birds
together with some other birds, Grenadier Waxbills and Blue-headed
Cordon-bleus. I observed that the chest colour of some of the birds was
darker than that of others. One bird was sick on arrival and died
within a few days. The post-mortem examination showed that it was a
hen. The chest colour of this bird was rather light, and I now sorted
out all my Odontospizas by means of the chest colour. Up to now all the
birds with the darker colour have been cocks. The cock has a nice little
song, executed with the head stretched upwards, with the open beak
moving when singing.
At the end of November the birds seemed to be in good condition
and I chose a cock, which semed particularly strong and active.
This I put in a flight in my bird room. In the flight, approximately
8 by 2J by 2 feet, I had breeding pairs of Peak's Parrot Finch, Painted
Finch, and Gouldian Finch. A week later I put a hen Odontospiza in the
flight. The cock was immediately very interested and started to sample
coconut fibres on the wooden top of a basket nest. The hen flew to a
small shrubbery which I had made for the Peak's Parrot Finches and
sat there calling for the cock. A bit later I observed the cock jumping
on a perch in the manner of common Bronze Mannikins.
The birds, however, did not make any serious attempts at nest-
building and at last chose an old nest, by the way, the same one the
Peak's Parrot Finches had used the first time they bred. Later on I have
also observed with other pairs of the species that they usually prefer
to use an old nest, and only repair it sparingly with some coarse material.
On 22nd January, 1962, I observed that the hen showed the

characteristic signs of starting to lay, and on 26th January, the first egg
was laid in the old Peale's nest. On the 28th a second egg was laid, but
no more followed. No attempts to sit were observed and I therefore
removed the eggs. The shell was rather thin and chalk-white, size
about 16 by 10 mm.
The birds, however, started again immediately, and on 5th February,
the first egg was laid, totalling five in all by 9th February. This time the
birds sat, but mostly the hen only, the cock occasionally taking over the
job for a few minutes. On 25th February, I examined the nest when
the hen was out of it and felt that there were young. On the next day
there was obviously something wrong. Later in the day I had an occasion
to examine the nest and found a dead chick, which had obviously not
been fed and therefore starved. This was removed and some days
later the remaining eggs also, as the birds did not care about them.
Both birds always spent the night in the nest and also a part of the day.
On 3rd March there was again an egg. This time I did not disturb the
birds and therefore do not know the number of eggs and when the
sitting started. I observed, however, that this time both birds took
turns in sitting, as is usual with the Weaver Finches. On 24th March
I had the impression that there were young ones in the nest, and when
putting in a finger I felt there were living young.
As to feeding : canary seed, different millets (white, Indian,
Algerian, Japan, and spray millet) Niger and grass seeds were given all
the time. Every day fresh sprouted seed (white and yellow millet),
hard-boiled egg mixed with a German proprietary food (Claus'
Aufzuchtfutter) and milksop with vitamins added. Mealworms were
eagerly taken, and gradually as the youngsters grew, the consump-
tion became bigger. I had the impression that the young were mainly
reared on mealworms. The pair spent much time inside the nest, but
as soon as I came with mealworms they immediately flew out, hung on
the netting and were very interested. As soon as the mealworms were
given the birds went straight to the nest. When both the birds were
outside I sometimes put a finger in the nest in order to see if the young
were still alive. On 1st April I heard for the first time the young
begging when the parents fed them. The sound was very weak and at
first I thought it was the song of the Gouldian cock, but when I put my
ear nearer the nest I could clearly hear that the sound came from it.
When the Odontospiza pair Nr. 1 was sitting on the eggs I had, a bit
improvidently, put a pair of Grenadier Waxbills in the same flight, as
I had the impression that the waxbills were inclined to nest, and this
flight seemed to suit them. Unfortunately they selected the shrubbery
where the Odontospizas nested and started to build. They did not allow
the Odontospizas to come near the nest, and in order to save the young
from starvation I had, much to my vexation, to remove the Grenadier
Waxbills again.

Every Friday is cleaning day in the birdroom. Even though I did not
dare to clean the Odontospizas 5 flight, I removed some droppings and
sprinkled some new sand on the bottom. I was shocked when I saw the
cock Odontospiza take a lot of sand and fly right to the nest of young
with lots of sand around his beak. I imagined him filling the young
with sand and thought all sorts of disasters would follow. Next day
I had an opportunity to inspect the nest and put in a trembling finger
expecting to find all the young cold and lifeless. I was happy when
I felt the warm young moving and lively.
At last the time came when I expected the young to leave the nest.
14th April was the birthday of our daughter and some days earlier
I had promised her that the young would leave the nest on her
birthday. I had the great luck that on that very day at 9.45 in the
morning the first two young came out, and at 11.15 a.m. the third one
was on the perch. The parent birds were somewhat nervous and
obviously worried about the young, which flew around rather helplessly.
One of the young ones was not able to fly up to the perch, when on the
floor. I made a kind of ladder from the floor to the perch, and this
helped somewhat. Later I observed, however, that this particular
youngster had a defective wing and a crooked leg and still had some
difficulty in reaching the perch.
When I saw the young outside for the first time it struck me that
they had a great likeness to the small Bib Finch [Lemuresthes nana ) from
Madagascar, a species related to the Bronze Mannikins. The colour of
the young Odontospizas is paler and more washed-out than that of the
adult birds. Head and neck are grey but without the small white
feathers which make the colour of the adult birds so decorative. On
the day the young left the nest Mr. A. Ryder Tonnesen--a member of
the Avicultural Society--visited me and saw the birds, and on 18th
April another fancier, Mr. A. V. Nielsen visited me and saw the young
being fed by the parents.
The young were fed for a considerably long time after leaving the
nest. In the nest the voice, as stated, was rather weak when begging,
but after flying out the voice grew stronger and could be described as
something like drrrr zirp * When fed the young take a horizontal position
on the perch with their heads stretched a bit upwards, at the same time
lifting and quivering the flight feathers and uttering the drrrr zirp,
drrrr zirp sounds.
Already on 27th April, when the young had been out of the nest
about a fortnight, I saw one of them jumping up and down on the
perch, like an adult cock. Later in the day I saw him singing in the
characteristic position with the head stretched and the beak open.
I could only see that the bird was singing, the voice being so weak that
I could not hear it.
On 19th May I observed for the first time that two of the young had

started to grow the small white feathers and already on 8th June, when
the birds were about eight weeks old, these two birds had all the small
white feathers on the throat, cheeks and neck, exactly like the adult
birds. Later on it turned out that these two birds were cocks, whereas
I suppose that the third one, which has moulted out more slowly, is
a hen.
I have tried to breed with several other pairs of Odontospiza and also
had young several times. At one time or another they have all, however,
stopped feeding the young, and up to now I have only been successful
in breeding the above mentioned young by their parents. In order to
save something that would else have been lost I have tried to put eggs
and young under Bengalese, but with poor success. I have only got
two young in this way. On the other hand this gave me a better
possibility to study the young birds during their growth.
Professor Steiner also had young from his Odontospiza but also in this
case the parent birds did not feed them, and they therefore died from
starvation.
My impression is, that this species is not very easy to breed. The
birds seem quite willing to lay eggs, and even sit on them. They
are, however, apparently unreliable feeders, and I am afraid that it will
be difficult to maintain the species in captivity, even if a comparatively
large number was imported in the autumn 1961. Also the usual short
cut, to use Bengalese as feeders, seems to be unreliable with this species.
All my experiences about the breeding of Odontospiza caniceps are from
indoor cages. I did not have any finches in the garden-aviaries in the
summer of 1962 because of the cold and wet weather, but have only
kept and bred with my Australian parrakeets and the Grey Parrots
outdoors.
I hope we get a better spring and summer in 1963 and if we do I will
put some Odontospiza caniceps in my outdoor aviaries for breeding.
Maybe they will breed more easily there because the birds are able to
find more living food to feed their youngsters.

All my life I have been interested in parrots and I think I must
have had one or two hundred pass through my hands.
I have lived in a big house where they had plenty of room to fly and
run about, but lately I have moved into a cottage and had to part with a
good many. However, in spite of the smaller space I have managed to
keep fifteen of them. The parrots I have kept have been mostly Greys
and Amazons. The Greys are undoubtedly the best talkers, but the
Amazons are more active and amusing.
Few parrots are being imported these days and nothing rare has come
in for a long time. The ones I have at the moment are four Greys,
seven Amazons, three Caiques, and one Ring-neck.
The Amazons are the Blue-fronted, two Yellow-fronted, one double-
fronted, one Yellow-naped, one Orange-winged, and one Festive.
I should like to hear from anyone who has more at the present time.
Macaws are delightful birds to keep especially if they are tame.
I have had several, but only two lately, the Blue and Yellow and the Red
and Yellow. But the cottage was not big enough for them and I have
had to give them away. The Red and Yellow went to that lovely place
" Birdland " at Bourton-on-the-Water. He had to be kept in all the
winter, but recently I heard that he is now out and free to fly about.
He seems to have paid a visit to the school to see the children. I think
they must have been astonished at seeing such a big bird.
Caiques make sweet little pets, so tame and confiding. I have three
different kinds--the Black-headed, the White-bellied, and a very
rare Lutino.
The little Ring-neck was picked up in a garden in Essex. It was
advertised, but was never claimed and I was asked if I would give it a
home. It had been kept in a stable and I was told it was extremely wild,
but when it saw a cage it was delighted to get into it where I think it
felt safe and happy. It is in wonderful condition and not a bit wild. The
same sort of thing happened during the War. A Ring-neck flew into a
room at a convent--the Nuns seemed scared stiff and asked if I would
come--I took a cage and the moment the bird saw it, it was only too
pleased to get inside. I think it must have escaped from France for it
was so tired it slept for a week.
I give here a list of the parrots I have had at different times.

THE NEW BIRD HOUSE IN THE BERLIN ZOO

Director, Berlin Zoological Gardens (Germany)
At the beginning of December, 1962, the new Bird House was
opened in the Berlin Zoo. As it is more than 3,300 sq. metres in area it
must be by far the largest of its kind in the world and naturally all
concerned in its construction endeavoured to make it the most beautiful
and the most suitable for the birds. In spite of its enormous size the
House does not contain long dull rows of cages but by the arrangement
of wings of buildings in a square round an open courtyard garden a
succession of different and charming vistas are presented. The main
entrance, in which there is a mosaic depicting the abundance of colours
of the feathered inmates in the adjoining rooms, leads the visitor first
to the Parrot Section after a selection of bright exotic birds have greeted
him in the special " Reception aviaries ". The Parrots are intentionally
in a section quite separate from the rest of the house so that the calls
made by these noise-loving birds do not penetrate everywhere and
deafen people with sensitive ears. As parrots, with their sharp beaks,
destroy wood and every growing plant the vegetation which is care-
fully preserved all over the House has to be omitted. However, every-
where else tropical vegetation of virgin forests has been allowed to
grow so high that already a beautiful natural picture is given.
Fountains provide the necessary humidity of the air and in addition,
throughout the whole house, each aviary is provided with a " rain-
shower " the fine mist from which can be used to spray the birds or to
lay the dust. To give an unrestricted view, the front of the aviaries is of
glass ; for this, however, we have used as far as possible light, non-
reflecting glass in order to avoid the appearance of keeping the birds
in an aquarium.
Even in the make-shift quarters which we had previously, the col-
lection of parrots in the Berlin Zoo was by far the richest in Germany.
It now consists of over 200 parrots of more than fifty different species
and there are some quite unusual rarities among them. Mention must
be made of the Keas of New Zealand, the only ones in Germany, the
enormous Black Palm Cockatoo, the Cockatoo collection and the
select collection of unbelievably beautifully coloured lories.

In the adjoining courtyard, which in the summer can be crossed
under a pretty creeper-covered pergola, the parrots which are
hardened to cold weather are displayed in large aviaries--the rare
Derbyan Parrakeet which extends to Tibet or the Argentine Quaker
Parrakeet which later, following the old Berlin Zoo tradition, will be
kept fully free-flying. The centre piece of the courtyard, with flower
beds planted with interesting Mediterranean plants, is a fountain with
steps.
In the North Section which follows is the largest part of the Zoo's
collection of Toucans and Touracos and this again has no equal in
Germany. A special treasure is the turquoise-blue Giant Touraco of
the Congo virgin forests, the only specimen in captivity in a zoo in the
whole world ! Next to it is the first importation after the war of four
specimens of that peculiar bird the Kagu, which now, owing to the
danger of the extinction of this species, is strictly protected. This
bird's resounding call is used as the time signal of the South Sea Radio
Station Noumea. After passing a pond with Flamingoes and the orna-
mental South American Ringed Teal, the path leads to aviaries
placed in semi-darkness from which Little Owls look out of their
hiding places in the natural rock like real goblins. An exhibition
showing the autumn migrations of Storks illustrates the fascinating
phenomenon of bird migration, while opposite, large observation
windows give a glimpse of the principal food kitchen of the service
section. Here visitors can see exactly how, under the direction of the
experienced " mistress of the house ", Frau Johst, the hundreds of food
trays and small dishes are filled with many different kinds of special
mixtures. The synthetic nectar for the Humming Birds is brewed in
" mixers ", sugar, tinned milk and honey form the food for the lories,
and seeds, nuts, and kernels are chosen from the innumerable drawers
of the large wall-cupboards and carefully and individually mixed for
the seed-eaters.
The South Section of the Bird House is certainly the most diverse of
the whole complex. Here are large aviaries in which brightly-coloured
weaver birds build their elaborate fibre nests in the branches, here is
the large enclosure for waders in the form of a carefully-maintained
muddy habitat in which plovers, avocets and sandpipers are shown in
particularly good condition, here also are the brightly coloured Bee-
eaters and the Tiger Bittern from the primeval forests of the Amazon
demonstrates its acrobatic contortions.
In the centre hall aviaries placed among flower beds principally
contain delicate species of birds and those who keep cage-birds will be
particularly interested and perhaps a little envious. Much the most
beautiful are the scenic backgrounds of the Jewel room. Here the Zoo
gardeners and workmen have created miniature habitat backgrounds in
the most remarkable way, in which the "jewels " of the bird world--

Humming Birds, Cocks of the Rock, Sugar Birds, etc., are shown in a
completely natural setting. On the branches of thorn bushes in the
middle of the red-gold wastes of a desert habitat sit African Rollers,
Ruby-throated Humming Birds whirr back and forth in front of great
orchid blooms in the subdued light of a virgin forest, or Argentine
Crakes scurry from sight like mice through a tropical thicket of rushes.
The high-point of a visit to the 190 aviaries of the new Bird House is
undoubtedly the walk-through aviary. Without being separated from
the winged inhabitants by a wire-netting or other partition, visitors may
walk on a winding forest path through a luxuriantly planted tropical
landscape ; irridescent Glossy Starlings, Drongos, and Bulbuls fly
around overhead, dainty rails scurry over the path, Barbets climb up
and down the waving lianas, and in a small clearing Crocodile birds
and beautiful Scarlet Ibises wade about in water-lily pools. The
dazzling blooms of the parasitic plants shine from the enormous tree
trunks and at the side exotic Mud-Turtles dive with lightning speed
into a splashing woodland stream as the visitor approaches--in fact a
true fairyland has been created.
In spite of all this the Bird House with its 190 large aviaries only
meets the need of a part of the Zoo's collection of birds ; the larger
species such as the gleaming brightly coloured pheasants, the Crowned
Pigeons of New Guinea, the velvet-red Tragopans of the Himalayas,
the Shoebill or the huge Argus Pheasant are housed in the new
Pheasantry which, just completed, 160 metres in length and containing
a large hall for the public, observation kitchens and observation
breeding-pens, cannot be equalled elsewhere. It is the fourth
Pheasantry to be constructed during the 120 years of the history of
the Berlin Zoological Gardens and naturally we have endeavoured
to utilize to the best advantage the experience accumulated in the
passage of time. Pheasant breeding and rearing, formerly a speciality
of Geheimrat Heck, will now be carried on by Heinrich Schwarz, the
oldest animal keeper in Germany still in service, who was recently
decorated with the " Bundesverdienstkreuz ", and undoubtedly this
new large installation will prove a flourishing rearing place.

Introduction
Southern 1 has described the behaviour of the gene which controls
the red- and black-masked phases of the Gouldian finch (Poephila
gouldiae, Gould). This article discusses the behaviour of the gene which
controls the production of the much rarer yellow-masked phase.
Mr. L. Webber of Epping, N.S.W. assisted me in carrying out this
work on the yellow-masked phase.
Red and Black Masked Phases
The results of Southern's work may be summarized as follows :
As far as the red and black phases are concerned, the colour is
controlled by a single sex-linked gene, the colour for red being domi-
nant to black. Thus for the red and black phases there are five different
types of birds. These are

The Yellow-masked Phase
The results of crossing yellow-masked Gouldians and their progeny
with the other two phases show that the yellow is a modified red phase.
The factor which controls the production of yellow is recessive, auto-
somal and thus independent of the sex-linked factor which controls
the production of the black or red. Where a bird is homozygous for the
yellow modifying factor but is without the red factor, the bird has a
yellow tipped beak instead of the usual red tipped beak.
There are therefore nine different types of cock birds and six different
types of hens which concern us. If the symbol " y " is used to denote
the " yellow 53 factor the various types of birds may be designated as

In comparing the actual results with the theoretical, the significance
of the non-appearance of certain types will be appreciated. For
example a yellow cock mated to a yellow hen does not produce a red
bird. Absence of red birds in the progeny is one of the main proofs of
the correctness of the hypothesis.
The genotypes of the parents were, with the exception of black
(type c) birds, determined either from breeding results of the birds
themselves when tested with other birds of known genotypes or from
their parentage. Type c birds were assumed to be pure for both
recessive factors. Thus in mating i, the cock birds, bred from yellow
parents produced no black progeny when mated with black hens.
Similarly the hen (rOYY) produced no yellow or black (type c) birds
when mated with yellow cocks. The parents in mating 2 were the
progeny of mating 1.

The oxpeckers, also known as Tick Birds and Rhinoceros Birds are a
highly specialized genus of passerines. (I hope those of my readers who
know this will pardon and skip over the first paragraph of this article,
which is merely to put those who don't " in the picture ".) They spend
most of their time resting or climbing about the bodies of large herbi-
vorous mammals such as buffaloes, antelopes, warthogs, rhinoceroses,
and domestic cattle. Only two species exist, both confined to Africa.
These are the Yellow-billed Oxpecker (Buphagus africanus) and the Red-
billed Oxpecker (Buphagus erythrorhynchus ). Both are dull brown in
colour with bufhsh belly and flanks, the Yellow-billed having also a
buff rump. The bill of the latter species is (despite its name) parti-
coloured, being yellow only for the basal half, its tip being a most vivid
scarlet red. The bill of the Red-billed is red but sometimes with some

They feed largely on ticks but also, apparently, sometimes take blood
or other liquid matter from wounds on animals. They do not appear to
incommode the wild animals that they batten on, but have been
accused of injuring domestic cattle by pecking at wounds and thus
preventing them from healing. It need hardly be said that the wounds
in question have usually been inflicted by man, but that does not lessen
his resentment at the oxpeckers' behaviour.
At the moment (March, 1963) the London Zoo has one oxpecker of
each species. The Yellow-billed is in an aviary, with a contrivance of
canvas to simulate the body of a large mammal, for it to perch on. It is
not very tame (as Zoo birds go) but sometimes shows what is either a
Captive Yellow-billed Oxpecker giving begging or soliciting display to its reflection
in rim of food dish.
food-begging or sexual-solicitation display towards human beings. In
this it adopts a horizontal posture and flutters its wings (see sketch). It
has an aluminium food dish and I have often seen it crouching so that
it can look and see its reflection in the narrow rim and reacting to each
good view of its image with a spasm of wing-fluttering. However,
interesting as this pathetic enforced narcissism is in its way, the
behaviour of the Red-billed Oxpecker is even more so.
This latter bird is kept in a cage with a similar hessian " ersatz
mammal " to perch on. When it first arrived at the Zoo it was hardly
out of its fledglinghood (it does not yet appear to be fully mature as its
bill is only just getting red) and Mr. John Yealland informs me that it
had been taken as a nestling and hand-reared. It is in good condition
and, at any rate with people on the other side of the bars, completely
tame and unafraid. When it sees Mr. Yealland, whom it recognises at a
distance, it gives what I think to be a self-assertive display in which it
erects the feathers of belly and rump, sleeks down those of head, neck
and foreparts generally, holds itself very upright (see sketch) and sways
its head and neck slightly from side to side. Once or twice it has shown
a very low-intensity version of this to me.
When I first proffered this bird a mealworm I discovered that its
" oxpecking 55 behaviour could be elicited by human fingers. I have
visited it many times and always it is desperately eager to perform what

are, evidently, its natural feeding-behaviour patterns, or at any rate
some of them. If given a finger, or the whole hand against the wires of
the cage, the oxpecker nibbles rapidly at it with a movement so quick
that the mandibles and tongue appear to vibrate as it does so. It nibbles
with its bill at right-angles to the skin but also often turns it sideways,
nibbling with a scissors-like movement. The tongue appears to be in
constant movement and there is a repeated, almost continuous, move-
ment of the throat as if the bird were swallowing, as indeed I think
it is. Only a slow-motion film would, however, be able to show exactly
what movements are made. The feeling of the bird at work is not at all
unpleasant when it is confining its attention to intact skin on hand or
head. When working on a cut, however, it can become quite painful.
On many occasions I have laid the side of my head against the cage
front to give the oxpecker a choice of feeding biotope, albeit a rather
restricted one. In such circumstances the bird nearly always chooses
the parts covered with hair (I wear my hair rather short at the sides as
a rule) to start with and works on them first although often soon being
lured away by my ear. I do not let it work on these for long, however,
since it not only tends to treat them very roughly but I cannot see what
it is doing so that, scientifically, nothing is gained although the very
slight pain does intensify one's feelings of self-satisfaction at providing the
poor creature with an outlet for its instincts !
The impression, that I had from the first, that the bird detached and
swallowed tiny loose morsels of skin whilst nibbling the hand was
corroborated when I experimented. When I cut little bits of the skin
of my finger so that, while still partly attached, they stood up from the
surface, the oxpecker nibbled, scissored, and tugged at them till (in a
very few seconds) it had detached them, when they were greedily
swallowed.

I cut the back of my finger with a razor blade (a friend who was with
me and who shall be nameless having, with a deplorable lack of
scientific zeal, declined to let me make use of his ear lobe for the experi-
ment) until a little blood came. The oxpecker appeared even more
excited by this than it had been by the fragments of loose skin. It
consumed the blood with frantic haste and then nibbled avidly at the
tiny wound. A few moments later I repeated the experiment (making a
fresh incision) with the same result. It was noticeable that whereas only
a very little blood oozed from the original wound (I waited for it to
appear before offering it to the bird) after the oxpecker had nibbled for
some moments the blood welled up more freely and in larger quantity.
These observations were repeated an hour or so later. Although
slightly painful and clearly effective in inducing freer flow of blood the
bird's nibbling at the cut place did not seem to result in any greater
injury than the removal of cut bits of skin and, perhaps, some of the
skin immediately around the cut. At least careful examination of the
finger next day showed no signs of injury attributable to the oxpecker
other than a reddening immediately around the cuts. The bill itself
had left no marks.
During the course of two protracted sessions as " blood donor " I
presented a cut finger to the bird many times and was impressed by
the speed with which every vestige of blood was removed and swallowed.
Sometimes, but not invariably, the oxpecker initially put its bill side-
ways against the finger as it started to work with nibbling bill tip and
rapidly-moving tongue at the bleeding spot. This appeared to be
slightly more efficient, but even when the bird started and continued
work with its bill at right-angles to the finger all visible blood was
cleared up in a few seconds.
Obviously one must be careful in interpreting the actions of a
solitary captive bird such as this. It is deprived of all possibility of
seeking its food in the usual manner of its kind and this may account for
its readiness to " oxpeck " the human hand or face. The eagerness for
blood probably has relevance to ticks or other ectoparasites which,
when engorged, burst as soon as the bird's bill nibbles at them, rather
than being an indication that it normally gets any blood from large
mammals " first hand ". Its behaviour does, however, show that there
is an innate recognition of some characteristics (? skin and warmth)
of mammalian bodies that are alive and therefore " worth investi-
gating ". Although this bird and the Yellow-billed specimen spend
much time climbing about on or clinging to their hessian substitutes I
have never seen either of them show any " oxpecking " behaviour when
on these dummies. It also suggests fragments of the skin of the host
mammals (probably those that are being shed as scurf) and possibly
such things as dried sweat may play some part in the oxpeckers' diet.
It would be extremely interesting to put this bird in a large aviary

and, when it had become accustomed to its new surroundings, to

(\0x25A0Continued from page 55)
The vicinity of Adelaide offers to the bird watcher a great variety of
species as there are, within easy reach, several distinct kinds of habitats,
green wooded hills, large salt and fresh-water marshes and dry mallee
(dwarf eucalyptus scrub). It has, moreover, the advantage of being the
avicultural centre of the country with numerous bird collections,
mostly of native parrakeets and finches, some very rare, which breed
regularly. The Adelaide Zoo is well laid out, well kept, and well
stocked with a particularly fine collection of Australian birds.
Our readers are familiar with the name of Dr. Alan H. Lendon, an
Honorary Fellow of our Society, who probably knows more about
Australian parrakeets than anyone else. He has been extremely
successful with the rarer and more difficult parrakeets and his excellent
articles have often appeared in this magazine. They will also remember
that the Avicultural Society of South Australia is affiliated to us.
Dr. Lendon and Mr. R. McKechnie very kindly took charge of us.
The country and its birds have little secrets for them--they know
exactly where the different species can be found. They were perfect
guides ; as they are also outstanding aviculturists, we saw the wild and
captive birds of the area under the best possible conditions. I take this
opportunity to express my deep gratitude to them and also to others,
too numerous to be named, who were kind and helpful during our visit
to South Australia.
The close vicinity of Adelaide, the zoo, and some private aviaries
were visited during the first two days, while the last two were reserved

for extensive tours of the salt pans, brackish, and fresh-water ponds
near the city, the mallee plateau and the lower valley of the Murray
River.
Australian zoos are suffering from the complete prohibition to
import foreign birds ; they are therefore reduced to the local and New
Zealand avifauna (New Guinea birds are not allowed in and ungulate
mammals are also barred). There are still a few exotic species in
aviaries brought in before prohibition or locally bred, mostly doves, par-
rakeets, finches, pheasants, quails, and waterfowl. For the visitors from
abroad, however, native birds are of greater interest, and the Adelaide
Zoo offers an excellent series of them. The collection of parrakeets and
cockatoos is particularly good, housed in highly suitable aviaries, where
a number of them breed every year. Practically all native species are
represented, as well as Keas and both Yellow-fronted and Red-fronted
Parrakeets from New Zealand ; Blue-faced Mealy Rosellas and Clon-
curry Barnard's are particularly attractive and seldom seen elsewhere.
It can be stated here that most Australian parrakeets are still common
in the wild state. The species which are rare or very local are ;
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.9780066" page_id="56350184"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
Brown's, Queen Alexandra, Golden-shouldered, Scarlet-chested
(Splendid), Turquoisine, Bourke's, Orange-breasted (jV*. chrysogaster ),
and Swamp ( Pezophorus wallicus) . The Night Parrot is very rare, and
the Paradise Parrakeet may be extinct ; all cockatoos are numerous,
except perhaps Gang-gangs and Leadbeater's.
Noticeable for a visitor from abroad were three species of Button
Quail (Turnix melanogaster, velox , varia ), the native Quails, Bustards,
Mallee Fowl and Brush Turkeys, and the Musk Duck ; certain doves :
Brown Pheasant-tailed, Red-plumed ( Lophophaps ferruginea) , and Flock
Pigeons (very Sandgrouse-like) ; there are also several very striking

pure white Crested Pigeons ( Ocyphaps lophotes). Two female Lyrebirds,
a Noisy Pitta ; many species of honey-eaters, and finches ; Ibis,
Spoonbills, Plovers, Herons, Frogmouths, Kingfishers (Kookaburra and
Sacred), Butcher Birds, Piping Crows, Bower Birds, Regent's Birds,
Cat-Birds, and Wood Swallows completed this excellent presentation of
the native avifauna.
There is also a good mammal collection, with breeding herds of
many species of kangaroos and wallabies, some now very scarce. The
installations are altogether practical and pleasing and it is evident that
the Adelaide Zoo is managed by enthusiastic and experienced men.
M. F. Basse, the President, and the members of the Council are to be
congratulated. The Director, Mr. V. D. Haggard, has retired since
my visit.
A number of private collections are also very interesting. Dr.
Lendon has now reduced his collection to a few very rare parrakeets,
particularly the Golden-shouldered. But Mr. C. C. Burfield has a
large and interesting one, not only of parrakeets but also of doves,

waterfowl, passerines, and other birds. He breeds a remarkable colour
mutation of the Scarlet-chested, or Splendid Parrakeet in which the
blue of the face invades other parts of the plumage. The aviaries of
Mr. Robert Wright and Mr. J. Jolly are also well built, well kept, and
agreeably surrounded by plants and flowers. One night we had a
well attended and interesting avicultural meeting when I had the
pleasure to meet many local aviculturists and bird students.
We found some very nice birds in the city of Adelaide. Mudlarks
and native Magpies ( Grallina and Gymnorhina ) are everywhere, as in all
Australian towns, and two species of Lorrikeets (Swainson's and
Purple-crowned) were feeding in the small, pink-flowered eucalyptus
trees lining a street.
In the wooded hills of the suburbs, numerous birds can be observed,
including Adelaide and Port Lincoln Parrakeets (also known as
Bauer's) ; but I cannot attempt, of course, to list here all the species
seen, and I will only mention the most striking ones, or those of special
interest to aviculturists.
A little further away lies a large flat area consisting of many salt-
water pans, surrounded by scrub and, between them and the sea, a
shallow fresh-water lake. It is a bird sanctuary ; waterfowl are abun-
dant, some preferring one habitat, while others are partial to the other.
Black Swans lived on both, but were more numerous and breeding on
the second. There were many Black Ducks and Grey Teal, and also a
number of Chestnut, which kept more to the mangroves and reed-beds ;
Australian Shovelers, Pink-eared Ducks, and White-eyes were
common, and there were Blue-bills ( Oxyura ) and Musk Ducks. The
two species of Stilts were abundant, the White-headed one (with
black nape and hind-neck), much like the American, and the very
pretty Banded ( Cladorhynchus leucocephalus) , with white neck, back, and
belly, dark wings, and a broad chestnut band on the breast ; these were
swimming about, picking food from the water, much as Phalaropes do.
The Australian Avocet is probably the prettiest of all, with its chestnut
head and neck. Two species of Grebes, Terns, and many Dotterel,
Sandpipers, and Stints were there ; also Spur-winged (Yellow-
wattled) , and Banded Plovers, two birds which live and breed well in
aviaries. We saw several little flocks of Blue-winged Parrakeets on the
low bushes along the road, and here and there the tiny and lovely
Blue and White Wrens. The larger rails were in evidence in the marsh :
Blue Porphyrios, Dusky Moorhens (larger and darker than the
European), and Native Hen ( Trihonyx ventralis) . Coots abound, the same
as in Europe and Asia. Galahs were numerous as always, and we saw
a few Brush Bronze-wings near the coast.
We drove across the attractive, wooded, and cultivated hills to the
dry mallee plateau, and it was a completely different country. The
slender, crooked eucalyptus, with scattered bushy undergrowth, stretch

far and wide. The mallee in fact covers most of the dry interior of
Australia. It is interspersed here and there by cultivated fields.
Despite its parched aspect, it has a rich bird life--we found three nests
of the Tawny Frogmouths, so tame that they would leave the nest only
when touched. Barnard's, Blue-bonnet, Many-coloured, and Red-
rumped Parrakeets were common and nesting ; Diamond Sparrows
and Zebra-finches, Mistletoe Birds ( Dicoeum ), Crested Bell-birds
(Oreoica ), Thornbills ( Acanthiza ), and White-faced Chats ( Epthianura
alhifrons) were conspicuous. This is also the habitat of the Common
Bronze-winged Pigeon. There were also many interesting small
birds. We found the nest of the Mallee Fowl, but could see none of the
birds. We finally reached the lower valley of the Murray River, the
largest permanent water course of the continent. We saw our first
Peaceful Doves along it. At one spot, in the grass and willows, there is
an established colony of the South African Grenadier Weavers. We
saw Common Blue and Purple-backed Wrens here and there. But
it is in the large swamps, beyond the river, that our finest display of
water-birds came into view ; Black Swans with cygnets ; Musk Ducks,
some huge males going through their prolonged and extraordinary
display ; all sorts of rails and ducks ; two species of Ibises (White and
Straw-necked), two of Spoonbills (Royal, Yellow-billed). We never
tired of watching them.
I am afraid these notes give a very inadequate impression of this
most interesting country, but it would take a whole volume to
enumerate all the thrilling sights which it was our privilege to enjoy.

In 1962 my pair of Yellow-winged Sugar Birds ( Cyanerpes cyaneus)
nested and raised two sturdy young chicks in my winter garden.
After building her nest of dried grasses, cow hair, and feathers, the
hen laid two small white eggs speckled with red on 15th and 16th July.
These hatched on 26th and 27th July and the young left the nest on
9th August.
The young birds had to be fed on live food so the hen was supplied
with mealworms, live ants' eggs and small spiders, also hundreds of
fruit flies ( Drysophila repleta ). In the corner of my orchid house
I have a fabulous fly farm where large supplies of fruit flies are bred,
rather to the disgust and annoyance of my long-suffering wife.
The young birds were separated from their parents at the beginning
of September, fed well on their own and appeared remarkably fit.

Introduction
People have been recording the sounds produced by birds for almost
as long as it has been possible to record sounds of any sort. To date
about 2,300 of the world's 8,600 known species of birds have been
recorded during the last three-quarters of a century.
In Europe, 313 species out of the 419 known to nest west of the
Urals (Voous, 1961) had been recorded in Europe, to my knowledge,
by mid-1962. For the British Isles, of the 244 species which can be
seen annually (Peterson et al ., 1956, plus the Parrot Crossbill ( Loxia
pityopsittacus) and Collared Dove ( Streptopelia decaocto) ), 201 had been
recorded by the end of 1962.
Remarkably enough, the vast majority of them are of wild birds.
It is the purpose of this essay to outline the early history of recording
the voices of captive birds, and to draw attention to the splendid
opportunities which aviculturists have for this work.
Early History
The earliest recording extant of any bird is on a wax cylinder in
the possession of Ludwig Koch--the " Master of Nature's Music ".
It was made in Frankfurt in 1889 with an Edison phonograph (Koch,
1955). The bird was a Common Shama ( Copsychus malabarico) and its
voice is preserved in the B.B.C.'s Sound Archive, along with almost
all Dr. Koch's other recordings.
The earliest mention in scientific literature of the reproduction of
bird song also refers to a cage bird. The account of the 16th Congress
of the American Ornithologists' Union, held in 1898 (Anon, 1899),
mentions the playing of a " graphophone demonstration of a Brown
Thrasher's song " by Dr. Sylvester D. Judd of Washington, D.C.
A world discography (Boswall, 1961a and 1962) shows that about
160 individual gramophone records, or albums of records, have been
commercially issued since 1908. The earliest one of all gave the voice
of a captive nightingale ( Luscinia megarhynchos ) in the Carl Reich aviary
in Berlin. It is worth quoting in full the entry in the H.M.V. Catalogue
for 1908-10 about this historic disc :--
" Unique Bird Record. G.C. 9439. Made by a Captive
Nightingale. For the first time in the history of the Talking Machine
industry, a genuine record has been obtained of a bird. The
Nightingale in question is the property of Herr Carl Reich, of
Berlin, and was taken from its nest shortly after hatching, and
reared by hand. The bird, therefore, can be said to have been

hatched in captivity, and consequently bird lovers can put out of
their minds all thoughts of a wild bird being confined in a cage.
This particular bird is a famous songster, and is taken about through
Germany by its proud possessor for show purposes. There was no
difficulty in obtaining the record. The cage was suspended in front
of the horn, and as soon as the recording motor was set in motion,
the bird began singing and did not even stop when it should, as
will be seen by the last note of the record, which clearly shows the
bird went on singing after the instrument stopped recording. As this
is the first record of its kind, no one interested in the Gramophone
should be without it."
Unfortunately, we are all without it, as no copy exists so far as
I can discover.
Gramophone Records
Altogether I have a note of twenty-three gramophone records
devoted either entirely or chiefly to the voices of captive birds. The
recordings for eleven of them were made in Britain, for seven in
Germany, for three in France, and for two in the U.S.A. In the
following discography, they are arranged chronologically by year of
issue, under national headings. I would be particularly glad to
hear from any member of the Avicultural Society of any additional

Of these twenty-three records, eight are of talking birds, mostly
Budgerigars ( Melopsittacus undulatus ), and a further seven are of
domestic Canaries [Serinus canaria) . Three present the songs of
European Oscines recorded in Germany, and two vocalizations by
birds in the collections of the Zoological Society of London. The
unrivalled waterfowl collection of the Wildfowl Trust provided Peter
Duddridge with the opportunity for his first disc, and for his second
he went to the " Birdland " aviaries at Bourton-on-the-Water in
Gloucestershire. Finally, Collias gives us a most interesting scientific
excursion into the vocabulary of the domestic farmyard chicken [Gallus
gallus). Garstang (1923, p. 37) mentions a captive Song Thrush
[Turdus ericetorum ), an H.M.V. disc, B 392, but gives no further details.
Gramophone records devoted primarily to recordings of wild birds
sometimes include reproductions of the voices of aviary specimens.
Among the Palearctic discs we find a number of examples. Palmer
(1958-62) includes among the 199 species in his magnificent Swedish
set a " conversation " between a pair of captive Snowy Owls [Nyctea
scandiaca). North and Simms (1958) include in Witherbfs Sound-Guide
to British Birds calls of four species of goose recorded in confinement.

Unpublished Recordings from Zoos and Aviaries
It is far beyond the scope of this contribution to attempt a review
of work done in the general field of bio-acoustics on birds brought
into captivity for the purpose.
Striking work has been done in this country, for example by
W. H. Thorpe, and others, at the Madingley Ornithological Research
Station at Cambridge. Dr. Thorpe tells me that during some twelve
years research into vocal communication and expression in birds,
recordings have been made of " All British finches (including buntings
and many hybrids), and many exotic finches, buntings and doves,
and hybrids of those in captivity ".
This work has resulted in a series of important papers (e.g. Thorpe,
1958, and Marler, 1956) and a stimulating monograph, Bird-Song
(Thorpe, 1961). Other outstanding studies are those of Gompertz
(1961) on the Great Tit (. Parus major) and Hall (1962) on the
Estrildines.
From a world review of avian bio-acoustic work in i960 and 1961
(Lanyon, 1962) it is evident that birds in confinement are not
infrequently the objects of experimental acoustic study. He quotes,
for example, Blase's (i960) work on Red-backed Shrikes ( Lanius
collurio ) reared in soundproof rooms : Thielke's comparison of songs
of European Tree Creepers ( Certhia brachyolactyla and familiaris ) hand-
reared in Germany, and so on. There are, of course, many more
examples of this kind of work in progress in Europe and elsewhere,
but in this paper I want to stress rather the importance of the oppor-
tunities provided by birds which are already in confinement, particu-
larly in Britain. The best example is that of the work done at the
Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge. By i960 the voices of twenty-seven
forms of Anaditidae of twenty-five species (Boswall, 19616) had been
recorded there by Ludwig Koch and Eric Simms and incorporated
in the B.B.C.'s library of natural history recordings (Anon, 1961).
Some of Peter Duddridge's Slimbridge recordings of about eighty
species have since been added to the B.B.C. collection, and a selection
of eighteen species from his library were used for the disc earlier
mentioned. Early in 1962 two Research Associates of Cornell Univer-
sity's Laboratory of Ornithology--Col. Donald S. and Mrs. Marian P.
McChesney--recorded the voices of at least eighty waterfowl species
in the Trust's grounds (Kellogg, 1962). For an up-to-date list of
species and forms recorded at Slimbridge, see Boswall (in press, c).

Acquaria of the World 55 (Jarvis and Morris, i960), recording work
on any scale has been done only in Regent's Park and Whipsnade,
so far as I am aware. Zoos are particularly important sources of new
material since so many of their birds are from regions where little
recording work has been done on wild species. In the Oriental region
in particular the taping of birds has been no more than fragmentary,
probably only a dozen species having been recorded. In the Ethiopian
region the total recorded is little more than three hundred, and in the
Antarctic (with an admittedly not very rich avifauna) probably only
about thirty species. My main source of information on work done
in the collection of the Zoological Society of London is the B.B.C.'s
catalogue of natural history recordings (Anon, 1961), which shows that
Ludwig Koch, Eric Simms, and an occasional B.B.C. engineer have
between them recorded twenty-two non-European species. Of these,
fifteen were from Africa south of the Sahara--including the Knysna

Turning to other collections in this country, Peter Duddridge tells
me that he has taped thirty species at Mr. Leonard Hill's delightful
bird garden at Bourton-on-the-Water in Gloucestershire (some of
which appear on the disc mentioned earlier) and about ten at the
Charlecote Bird Garden.

I have the following observation to report on what I consider to be
the peculiar behaviour of young Gouldian Finches.
I bred Gouldians on a community basis, i.e. six pairs of Gouldians in
an outside aviary 6 by 15 by 7 feet high, no other birds but Chinese
Painted Quail being present. The particular nest of birds of which
I speak was the first of the season and the three youngsters left the nest
on 9th March, 1963. On the 21st March, 1963, the young were still
being fed by the parents.
Thereafter two became independent but the third remained
immature and kept up an incessant chirping for attention. This
immature bird, which I shall call A, did not look well and was not
strong on the wing. I was easily able to catch it by hand and ring it.
The other two youngsters which I shall call B and G were perfect in
every respect. Up to 24th March, 1963, A was still being fed by the
parents. Between 18th and 26th March, 1963, A was seen to be fed by
B and G (i.e. its own nest mates) on numerous occasions.
The feedings were not just token feedings but were accompanied by

the usual wing fluttering displays, and regurgitated food was seen to pass
from one bird to another. On one occasion while A was being fed by
B, G was seen to enter another nest of Gouldian nestlings and from
the characteristic noise was feeding these. On 27th March, 1963 A was
still being fed by its nest mates but was making attempts to feed itself.
This bird unfortunately died on the 28th March.

One more of my old and dear friends has left us--taking with him
more of my fond memories. We had long been closely associated in the
pursuit of our common interests, particularly birdkeeping and
gardening. John Spedan Lewis, a Vice-President of the Society since
1938, died on 21st February, 1963, at Longstock, Stockbridge, in the
cottage he had built three years ago to enjoy peace and comfort in the
company of his devoted secretary and housekeeper. It is a great relief
to hear that he passed away suddenly and quietly soon after he had
gone to bed, after a day of normal activities. He was seventy-seven
years old.
He had a very full life. We can only mention here the tremendous
work he has done in expanding very successfully the large business he
inherited from his father, and more so in turning it into a partnership,
thus presenting his employees with the large fortune he could have
kept. Spedan Lewis's unselfishness and idealistic generosity have few,
if any, equals in the world to-day. His other line of interest was the
study of nature, which he started as a child. An avid reader, he learned
a great deal--his knowledge of the native plant and animal life of
England was remarkable. He was also a keen gardener, and he carried
on with these hobbies until his last day.
Spedan Lewis joined the Avicultural Society in 1924 and I met him
at the Zoo the following year. He was then living at Hampstead, where
he had built some excellent aviaries, with large heated shelters for rare
passerine birds, particularly Birds of Paradise, and a few others. He
also had a fine collection of wild cats in outdoor cages. He soon took
great interest in owls and gathered a large collection of them, which
were housed at Wargrave and cared for by Miss Ethel Chawner, a
learned and enthusiastic naturalist, and long a specialist of these birds.
He became a member of the Council in 1927. When he left his house
at Hampstead, he built a series of aviaries at Odney (Cookham), a
park used as a country club by the John Lewis Partnership. He
acquired many more birds, including pheasants, a large number of

them brought over by Messrs. Frost, Webb, Shaw-Mayer, and Gordier,
sharing these collections with Ezra, Whitley, and me.
Spedan Lewis moved to Leckford, Stockbridge, Hampshire, in 1933,
and Miss Chawner followed him. Great developments soon took place.
With my advice, many very spacious pens for pheasants were erected
up on the hill, and they were as good as any I have ever seen ; also a
large duckery was established in the valley on fast-running chalk
streams and ponds, in a perfect location. There were furthermore,
roomy pens for swans, geese, and cranes. Excellent collections of all these
birds were gathered, many of them bred at Cleres. Numerous indoor
and outdoor aviaries for parrots, doves and small birds, and enclosures
for Rheas and park animals completed the installation.
Spedan and I had great fun planning this accommodation. We had
become close friends through the years and saw a lot of each other in
England and in France. He was also a benefactor of the London Zoo,
presenting many rare species, and of the British Museum, several expedi-
tions being sponsored by him.
A livestock department had been opened at Peter Jones, one of the
London stores of the Partnership, in 1938. It was soon closed down, but
a fortunate result was that Mr. Terry Jones, who had been engaged to
work in it, was then sent to Leckford. Until then Miss Chawner had
supervised the collections with the help of Mr. H. Milligan, who had
acquired a great deal of experience at Elbeuf, caring for the birds of
Madame E. Lecallier, and later at Cleres. Terry Jones joined them,
and when Miss Chawner, a great friend to him, was obliged to curtail
her activities, he assumed full responsibility for the collection. Everyone
knows what a success he has made of it, particularly of waterfowl
breeding. The Leckford collection was at its height in 1939 when war
was declared. Mr. Jones joined the Navy. It became more and more
difficult during the following years to feed and care for the birds.
Many were disposed of, particularly the cranes, but a good many
species of waterfowl and pheasants were preserved. It was lucky, as
European and even American collections were replenished after the
war from that valuable nucleus. Mr. Lewis most kindly presented
many specimens to me to restock Cleres in 1946. Waterfowl still are
reared there to-day on an economic basis.
Spedan Lewis's interest in his captive birds gradually diminished
during the last ten years. His devoted wife had died in 1953, a terrible
blow, and his health began to decline. A very serious illness of his early
years had always obliged him to take precautions, and these became
more urgent. He however was still a lover of plants and nature in
general. I visited him a few times each year and we had the same long
talks and discussions as we had in earlier days. I shall miss them deeply,
as also his true friendship and affection.
J. Delacour.

A Bittern found in a Cornish town during January, 1962, and
deposited here by the R.S.P.C.A. has now been sent to Minsmere
reserve where the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is trying
to rehabilitate specimens collected from various places. During the
severe weather most of the Bitterns scattered and must have suffered
heavy mortality.
A male Eider Duck (ringed in Denmark), a female Scoter, a Gannet,
and a Common Gull (ringed at Heligoland) were picked up in
different parts of Kent and Essex and sent here.
Other arrivals include a pair of Cereopsis Geese, eight Japanese
Quail, two Blue-headed Parrots (Pionus menstruus), a Hoopoe, a
Meadow Pipit, a Virginian Cardinal, a Mistle Thrush, four Gouldian
Finches, two Siskins, and four Alpine Choughs.
A pair of Baikal Teal and an Eastern White-breasted Waterhen
have been sent from Hong Kong by Dr. K. C. Searle.
A Black-footed Penguin and a Crested Pigeon have been bred in
the gardens.
The Japanese Quail is not recorded as having been in the collection
at any earlier date, but this seems unlikely, for it has long been
domesticated in parts of eastern Asia and for several years in this
country, being kept for the large number of eggs that it lays, and
reared for the table. Like the nominate race which is a summer
visitor to this country and to other parts of Europe and to western
Asia, Coturnix c. japonica is migratory in at least part of its range,
breeding as far northward as Sahkalin and parts of Japan and
wintering as far southward as Siam and Indo-China. Other races are
resident in the Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands,
and parts of Africa and Madagascar, Comoro Islands, and Mauritius.
In eastern China where this quail used to occur in large numbers on
migration, many were netted, shot, or caught with hawks. The males
were also used for fighting contests. Pere David stated that the birds
were " bathed in hot tea and dried inside their owners' sleeves and
then fed. After the process has been repeated several times the birds
become very tame ". It was said that the contestants were put upon
a railed table and millet thrown there, " and as soon as one picks
up a grain, the fight begins."

The Bronze Medal of the Avicultural Society of South Australia
has been awarded to R. W. McKechnie, for breeding the Black-faced
Wood-Swallow Artamus cinereus.
McKechnie has previously bred the Dusky A. cyanopterus , the

Kenneth Russell sends further news of his Sierra Parrakeets (see
1962, 213). He writes : " I regret that ultimately the breeding wasn't
a complete success--the three youngsters perished, due to the rain
penetrating the nest-box, which was not a very suitable one for this
species. I have wintered them indoors (unheated) and they do not
appear to have been particularly affected by the cold. They are really
charming little birds, seemingly quite inoffensive, sharing a flight with
Queen Whydahs and a Red-headed Finch. All my parrakeets outdoors
have so far come through this bitter weather quite well. A pair of
Alexandrines decided to nest with resultant egg-binding. The hen
survived, however, so I am hoping that they may resume domestic
pursuits in more seasonable weather later on."

A. W. E. Fletcher points out that there appears to be a difference
of opinion concerning the number of eggs laid by the Picazuro Pigeon
Columba picazuro. Dr. A. G. Butler, Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary ,
II, page 255, writes : " Gibson says . . . that in six nests which he
examined each contained only one egg ; Hudson, on the other hand,
declares that two are deposited, which is what one would expect in the
case of a Columba ."
Fletcher is able to offer some confirmatory evidence that in captivity,
at least, the clutch size is one egg only. Last year the pair at Chester
Zoo nested three times, and so far this year once. On each of the four
occasions a single egg was laid.

Jack Hartley, of Clearview, South Australia, has enjoyed remarkable
success in breeding Peach-faced Lovebirds. During the past two and
a half years he has bred over 130 young ones.
Apart from the prolificness of his original two pairs and their
progeny the results are the more remarkable in that he has had the
seeming temerity to breed on the colony system !
The aviary is 10 feet long, 7 feet high and 6 feet wide. The maximum
number of breeding pairs in the aviary has been eight, and the maxi-
mum number of all ages at any one time sixty-four. Hartley stresses
the importance of having plenty of boxes and logs always available, also
two or three sheaves of hay on the floor of the flight. The aviary also
contains a pair of Black-breasted Quail, which help to turn over the
earth floor.

Mention in Australian Aviculture that Norman McCance, of Avons-
leigh, Victoria, has an Amherst Pheasant cock twenty-one years old
prompted an inquiry regarding this bird. Mr. McCance kindly sent
me details of its origin. Many years ago the late Mr. Alan Jacques, of
Balwyn, Victoria, imported some pure-bred stock from the late George
Beever, of Huddersfield. In October, 1941, he gave a setting of eggs
to McCance and it was from this that " Methuselah 55 eventuated.
He fathered quite a number of youngsters which were sent to friends

Mr. McCance writes : "By the way, old Jacques who was a Wiltshire
man was as famous for longevity in his pheasants as I am now. I saw
a Reeves' cock hobbling around at his place and commented on its
age. Jacques said ' Yes, he's pre-war ! ' This was in 1940-41. I replied
that that was nothing remarkable. Jacques said 4 1 mean pre-last war ! '
He had imported that bird in 1913 and it was twenty-seven years old.
All our rare pheasants are generally very long-lived. I got the
original pair of Edwards in December, 1936, from Genoa (in exchange
for twenty-seven Wallabies, two Wombats and two Sugar-squirrels),
and the cock bird lived for seventeen years. My Fireback (Siamese)
died last winter aged fifteen ; and my present Edwards pair total
twenty-two years, and had one fertile egg last November.
The amazing feature of ' Methuselah ' is his virility. He was
displaying yesterday to his mate and as he is just through his moult
he gave a dazzling performance. He gets regular doses (in c parts per
million ') of salt, iron, magnesium and manganese, and his colouring
is superb. Sorry to boast so much about him. People come from
N.S.W. and drool over him. All I reared of Amhersts this season,
1962-63, was a trio of his grandchildren."

The foregoing causes one to speculate on the longevity of pheasants.
Accessible records appear to be somewhat meagre. J. H. Gurney,
" On the Comparative Ages to which Birds live " (Ibis, 1899, pages
19-42) gives only two examples : Silver Pheasant &amp;lt;J, 21 years old,
Authority, " Birds of Ireland," p. 27.
Temminck's Tragopan &amp;lt;J, 14 years old. Authority, F. E. Blaauw.
It would be of interest if members would report any cases of longevity
of which they have knowledge. A.A.P.

A GUIDE TO THE BIRDS OF SUSSEX. By G. des Forges
and D. D. Harber. Oliver and Boyd, Ltd., Edinburgh, 1963.
Price 30^. net.
This concise and clear guide provides a summary of the information
on the distribution and occurrences of birds in Sussex. The validity
of records has been submitted to critical examination and all those
which were not considered perfectly sound have not been included.
A description of the topography and ecology of the county is followed
by notes on individual species giving, as far as appropriate, details of
status, breeding information, numbers, where in the county the species
occurs, and migrations. There is a specially drawn outline map,
i inch to the mile, showing woodland, principal urban areas, heights
and contours, and twelve excellent photographs illustrate varying bird
habitats. P. B.-S.

Escapes from London Airport
Since 1954 I have spent a great deal of time at London Airport, waiting for, and
meeting, aircraft at all hours of the day and night, and I hope these notes on bird
escapes from aircraft and vehicles will prove of interest to fellow aviculturists. The list
of species only includes those birds seen in the actual airport area, the boundary taken
being the perimeter road. The majority of escapes are from Indian shipments, this can
be attributed to the cane-type hessian covered cages which are very easily damaged
during loading and offloading; one loose cane-slat pushed out or broken and the damage
is done.
Owing to the large numbers shipped and their small size the Red Avadavat,
(Amandava amandava) is the Indian species that most often escapes. Many of them are
recaptured by the loading staff who, although not experienced, are well aware that the
chances of survival for such tiny unacclimatised birds are very remote. Other com-
monly imported African and Asiatic species I have seen escape or have noted in the
airport area include Java Sparrow ( Padda oryzivora), Tri-coloured Mannikin ( Munia
malacca ), Spice bird (Mania punctulata) , Silverbills ( Euodice malabarica and E. cantans ),
Bronze-winged Mannikin (Spermestes cucullatus ), Cut-throat ( Amadina fasciata), Grey
Singing Finch (Poliospiza leucopygia ), Pintailed Whydah ( Vidua macroura ), Red-eared
Waxbill ( Estrilda troglodytes) , and various weavers.
On a few occasions I have seen Shamas ( Kittagingla macroura ), Pekin robins ( Leiothrix
lutea ), Common Mynahs (Acridotheres tristis ), Zosterops, various Bulbuls, and, once
only, a Red-crested Cardinal ( Paroaria cucullata ). There is little likelihood of survival
for most of these birds although, of course, the season and weather conditions would
have a bearing.
The airport and surrounding country is frequented by large numbers of gulls.
Carrion Crows and Magpies breed in the area, which is also popular with boys and
youths armed with air-rifles, and sometimes more formidable weapons. Unfortunately
I have no time for regular bird watching, but I have often wondered if any of the more
hardy and wily species have managed to elude these hazards. It would be interesting
to know if anyone living in the vicinity has any evidence of survival.

Wattled Crane in N'gamiland
In the north-west corner of the Bechuanaland Protecterate lies N'gamiland, a large
inland delta, surrounded by hundreds of square miles of semi-desert.
During my recent visit to N'gamiland, in March, 1961. I travelled to the pan lands
of Lake N'gami, 75 miles to the south-east of Maun, the administration centre. At the
time of my visit this seasonable lake was covering an area of approximately 24 square
miles, varying from 2 to 4 feet in depth, and supported a profusion of bird life, including
flocks of Flamingo, Pelican, Wood Ibis, Blacksmith Plover, and many others too
numerous to list.
The terrain surrounding the lake is flat with little or no vegetation so, on driving
round the lakes southern shore, it was easy to pick out the tall grey silhouettes of the
Wattled Crane ( Bugeranus carunculatus) . During a fifteen-minute drive over grassy veld
I encountered eleven different specimens of Wattled Crane, grouped in twos and threes,
walking casually, prodding and probing the ground for insects. On leaving the
vehicle I was able to get within 10 yards of them, before they took off, flapping their
large wings, gradually gaining height, uttering loud cries of protest for being disturbed
in their daily terrestrial foraging.
In an article in the Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 9, No. 6, November-December,
1944, entitled " A Rare Baby Crane ", by Lee S. Crandall, he writes that the Wattled
Crane is the very rarest of the group and the birth of one in 1944, in New York, was the
first recorded hatching of this species, apart from a hybrid between the Wattled and
Canadian Crane, which was reared in England in 1911.
To the best of my knowledge, Paignton Zoo, in Devon, is the only zoo in the British
Isles to possess a pair and, with the obvious scarcity of these birds, it is very encouraging
that in some remote areas in Africa Wattled Crane are still fairly plentiful and not in
any immediate danger of being exterminated.

THE FIRE-CROWNED BISHOP
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982137333333333" page_id="56350213"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Derek Goodwin (London, England)
Weavers ( Ploceidae ) are well known to aviculturists and deservedly
popular as most of the more commonly imported species are brightly
coloured, hardy, and easily fed in captivity. The Fire-crowned Bishop
(.Euplectes hordaceus ) also known as Red-crowned Bishop, Black-winged
Red Bishop, and Crimson-crowned Weaver is one of the most brilliant
of them all. It is, however, less freely imported by bird dealers than
the equally brilliant Red Bishop (Euplectes orix ) also known as Orange
Bishop, Orange Weaver, Grenadier Weaver, Fire Weaver, and Fire
Finch.
The Fire-crowned Bishop is larger than the form of Orange Bishop
most commonly imported (from tropical West Africa) but little, if any,
larger than the southern form of Orange Bishop which dealers usually
distinguish by the name of Grenadier Weaver. When in breeding
plumage the male's red or orange crown distinguishes him at a glance
from male Orange or Grenadier Bishops which have the forehead and
crown black. In all plumages the male Fire-crowned Bishop can be
distinguished by his black primaries and secondaries, those of Orix being
brown. The red of the male Fire-crowned Bishop is usually a little
paler than that of the West African Red Bishop being a vivid orange
or fire-red rather than geranium red. Most (but not all) wild males
are, however, a rather deeper colour than the one shown in the
accompanying plate. Like the Red Bishop captive Fire-crowned
Bishops assume a paler, more orange red after moulting in captivity,
particularly if they are kept in cages or small aviaries.
The Fire-crowned Bishop is found across the central parts of Africa
from Senegal and Angola east to the southern Sudan, Ethiopia,
Southern Rhodesia, and Tanganyika. It inhabits grassy country,
especially areas where there is high grass near to water. The nest is a
domed purse of grass with a hole in the side and a porch of grass seed-
heads. The nest, minus the porch, is built by the male, the female
adds the porch and also continues to add further material to the nest
itself during incubation. Only the female incubates and cares for the
young.
In a wild state the Fire-crowned Bishop appears only to have been
recorded eating grass seeds and, where available, cultivated grains.

It doubtless takes insects also and the young are known (from stomach
contents of collected nestlings) to be fed, at least partly, on insects.
The plate shows a pair immediately prior to copulation, the female
soliciting with slightly opened and fluttering wings and the male
puffed out in a manner apparently similar to that used in the territorial
display flight (see Lack, 1935). The artist watched the birds wild in
Sierra Leone and later made the painting of an actual scene she had
observed.
The breeding behaviour of this species was studied in a wild state by
Dr. David Lack. I have summarized his findings (or some of them) in
this note but all readers interested in this species should read his paper
in full.
I regret I have never kept this species so cannot give any advice,
based on experience, of how to treat it in captivity. It is to be hoped,
however, this plate and this lack in my accompanying notes will
induce some reader who has kept the Fire-crowned Bishop to give us
a fuller account of it.

By E. D. W. Jayewardene (Kandy, Ceylon)
The Malabar or Indian Blue-Winged Parrakeet (. Psittacula
columboides ) is found only in the hill country of South-western India,
where according to the noted Indian ornithologist Salim Ali, it is a
prized rarity. A beautiful bird, it is remarkably similar in appearance,
habits, and call to the Layard's or Emerald-collared Parrakeet
(.Psittacula calthorpe) which is peculiar to Ceylon and found only in the
hill country of the island.
Bates and Busenbark describe the Malabar in their excellent book
on Parrots and related birds as " shaped like a Ring-necked and about
the same size. The male has a red bill and a slightly rose-tinted grey
head, which has a tinge of powder-blue on the forehead and a tinge of
pale green around the eyes. The black ring is bold and meets at the

back of the neck. A pale blue collar follows and graduates to a paler
green below the throat. The chest, abdomen, and mantle are soft grey
with the rose cast present again. The wings and tail are blue and are
darker on the flights. The wing feathers have paler edges giving them
a scalloped effect and the tail has yellowish tips. The vent, tail-coverts,
and the underside of the tail are a yellowish-green, which becomes less
yellow on the tail. Females have black bills and lack the collar. The
rose cast is absent from the grey areas. The wings are duller 55 .
My breeding pair was obtained from a dingy little boutique in a back
alley behind the Mysore Market. They were fledglings when I bought
them, with several others, in May, i960. They were just able to eat by
themselves and were on a diet of ripe mangoes.
On their arrival in Ceylon they were housed in an outdoor aviary
and placed on a diet of bread and milk and mixed seed--a paddy base
with sunflower seed, oats, Indian and Pakistan millet. Fruit and ground
nuts were also given. No vitamins of any sort were added to their feed.
The bread and milk was discontinued as soon as they stopped eating it.
This pair first nested in January, 1962. Four eggs were laid, but all
were infertile. On the second occasion the birds commenced mating
last November. As they were in an aviary with a pair of Eclectus Parrots
I transferred them to another aviary by themselves. They settled down
almost immediately and within a matter of days the hen was on eggs.
The nest-box was a small wooden box approximately 9 inches square
by 14 inches long. An entrance hole about 3 inches in diameter was
made 3 inches from the top of the box. A 4-inch layer of sawdust was
placed at the bottom. At no time before or after the eggs were laid did
the male make any attempt to enter the box. The hatching of the eggs
was done entirely by the female. Not only did the male not help the
female to hatch the eggs but he took good care to perch each night as
far as possible from the nest-box during the time the hen was on eggs.
Unusual activity on the part of the hen early in January indicated
clearly that the chicks had arrived. The birds were immediately
supplied with plenty of bread and milk, sunflower seed, Indian corn on
cob in addition to their usual food. The feeding of the chicks for the
first five or six weeks was done entirely by the female. The male fed the
female, who in turn fed the chicks.
After the sixth week I observed the male entering the nest-box for
the first time and feeding the chicks. The first chick emerged from the
box a few days later. The next came out about a week later. When the
second chick came out I observed yet another chick in the box. As this
chick showed no signs of leaving the nest I became impatient and
opened the box. I found two chicks inside. I replaced the box with the
two chicks. The third chick came out a few days after this and the other
one a few days after the third left the box. They have all left the nest
now and I have four healthy young Malabars.

The young ones are almost as big as their parents. They have light
orange bills and the black ring round their necks. They do not have
the grey tinge with the rose cast on their heads and bodies. The wing
feathers have the scalloped effect. The bills, as in the case of the
Layard's or Emerald-collared Parrakeet, start off as orange then turn
black and finally the males get their red bills while the bills of the
females remain black.

By Charles K. Lucas (Melbourne, Australia)
In the Avicultural Magazine , 1962, page 78, there appears a note
of a breeding by me of two nests of two each of the Plumed or
Spinifex Pigeon. Not long after this note appeared I received a letter
from Professor Carl Naether of Encino, California, stating that he was
very interested in the fact that I had bred this bird and asking me to
write an article about the breeding for publication in the Avicultural
Magazine. Unfortunately I had not paid close attention to the time of
incubation and other details in regard to the breeding and I decided
that I would wait until this last season to see whether the birds bred
again and in that event I would make some notes of the activities of the
birds. As one might well expect the little wretches did not breed during
the last season although it appeared on several occasions that they were
about to do so, but I think that they were disturbed by a pair of
Brown Quail which were in the same aviary and their efforts came to
nothing. However, in order not to disappoint Professor Naether, I
have decided to put down such details as I can give in regard to the
breeding of these birds.
The Plumed or Spinifex Pigeon (Lophophaps plumifera ), sometimes
called the Plumed Ground Dove, is a native of Australia and is abun-
dant in the Northern Territory and also occurs in Queensland. They
prefer hot, dry, and arid conditions among rocks and sand and they are
fond of perching on a rock in the full glare of the sun which, in their
special habitat, can be very hot indeed. Their natural food is the seed
of the spinifex shrub which thrives in the arid conditions in which the
birds are found. Their general colour is a pale cinnamon with the neck,
mantle, and wing-coverts barred with brown, the latter and the
scapulars being grey at the base and some of the inner secondaries are
glossed with bronzy-purple on their outer webs ; the forehead and ear-
coverts are grey and the centre of the crown has a long crest feather,

cinnamon in colour, the cheeks and throat are white with a line over the
eye and gorget black ; a greyish-white band runs across the breast, the
centre of the abdomen is white and there is bare crimson skin around
the eyes. The female is very similar to the male, but smaller in size.
However, they are difficult to sex. They are usually seen in pairs or
flocks and appear to be remarkably tame and difficult to flush from
the ground. They usually lay two eggs on the ground in a depression
sheltered by a low bush or clump of spinifex. The eggs are pale creamy-
white and the breeding season occurs after rain throughout the year.
The Spinifex Pigeon makes a very attractive aviary bird provided
that not more than one pair are kept in the same enclosure as they are
apt to fight amongst themselves and can inflict severe damage on one
another. They are extremely dainty birds and the mating display of the
male is most attractive. He faces the hen bird and bows rapidly towards
her at the same time spreading his wings and tail feathers and uttering a
loud coo.
The Spinifex Pigeon is commonly kept in aviaries in Australia and
they do quite well, even in Melbourne, where the climate has very
little similarity to that experienced in their native habitat. Although
they are not freely bred many fanciers have bred them and it is a
question of securing a breeding pair as is the case with most birds which
are rare. My pair was housed in a large L-shaped aviary, the shelter
being 28 by 9 feet and the flight section being 21 by 16 feet, which was
heavily grassed. They were housed with a mixed collection of finches
and doves, including Green-winged Pigeons. Apparently they do not
like to nest in long green grass. A fellow breeder informed me that his
pair had nested in the shelter after he had dug up a tussock of grass and
planted it in the shelter to provide cover for them ; they laid their eggs
in a small depression behind this tussock. I tried the same device but
the birds did not appear to be interested during the i960 breeding
season. However, in about October, 1961, I found that the hen bird
had laid two eggs on a heap of dried grass clippings in the shelter in
quite an exposed position and after a time I saw that she was sitting
on them. In order to provide her with some cover I broke off some
twigs from the tea tree in the aviary and built these up into a kind of
bower around the nest. This of course was done while the bird was off
the nest but I found that I could approach very close to her when she
was sitting without disturbing her. The cock bird took his turn at
brooding and, after about seventeen days, two young were hatched.
They were very small but grew extremely rapidly. They were a delight-
ful chocolate-brown colour and during the first fortnight or so after
they were hatched they sat very still in the nest when the parent bird
was off the nest. However, after about a fortnight, they began to move
about and could run very rapidly all over the aviary. It was not very
long before they began to take on their adult plumage and I suppose

that, by the end of a month, they were hardly distinguishable from their
parents.
When the young birds had almost attained adult plumage, the hen
bird laid two more eggs, again in an exposed position and again I
adopted the device of making a bower around them constructed of
broken twigs from the tea tree. Two young were duly hatched and
again they quickly reached adult plumage. The hen went down a
third time and very soon two more young were hatched and duly
reared, making a total of six young birds from the three nests between
October, 1961, and February, 1962.
I left the six young with the parents for some time and eventually I
noticed that they were attacking each other and very soon two of them
had been rather severely mutilated around the top of the head and of
course I had to separate them. They quickly regained the crest
feathers and were soon again in first-class condition.
As already mentioned, I was looking forward to their nesting again in
the 1962-63 season but they did not do so. I am almost certain that this
was due to the interference of a pair of Brown Quail in the aviary as I
saw the latter chasing the Spinifex Pigeons on a number of occasions.
I removed the Quail after a great deal of trouble in catching them in
the long grass but apparently the Spinifex Pigeons had been " put off "
and they did not do any good. I still have the parents and am hopeful
that they will do the right thing again next season.
I find that pairs differ considerably. Some are very wild and if kept
in a small enclosure they are apt to fly up and knock the top of the
aviary doing themselves damage on the head. Other pairs are quite
docile and do not panic even when one walks up quite close to them.
They love to bask in the sun and often they can be seen lying on their
side with one wing raised, obviously enjoying the hot sun. Although
they have to be brought a long distance from Northern Australia they
are often available in Melbourne through the dealers and cost from #4
to #5 per pair. They make delightful aviary birds and do not interfere
with the other inmates of the aviary but, as stated above, it is not
advisable to house more than one pair in the same aviary.

(.Pipreola riefferi)
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.A.)
The Cotingidae family of birds is confined to the New World and,
although they are mostly to be found in the Amazon region, they have
spread north as far as the borders of the United States and southward
to northern Argentina. There are some ninety species in all, embracing
such birds as Cocks of the Rock, Bell Birds, Umbrella Birds, Fruit
Crows, etc., their size varying from 3J to 18 inches. Some of the species
are known as Chatterers and are recognized under the common name of
Cotinga, and it is with one of these that I am now concerned.
They are arboreal birds taking fruit and insects as their main diet
and require careful acclimatization to be kept alive in captivity. From
experience gained in the keeping of two species, the Black-throated--
Pipreola riefferi --and the Orange-breasted --Euchlornis jucunda --it seems
that they do not adapt themselves well to cage life but do thrive in an
aviary. Two pairs each of the aforementioned species came under my
care at the Boehm Aviaries in January, 1961, having been brought
back by Mr. Boehm after his visit to Ecuador. It was a long drawn-out
winter in New Jersey that year, and they had to be kept in cages until
such time as it was possible to complete the aviaries in which it was
intended to place them. During this confinement, one male Black-
throated and a pair of the Orange-breasted were lost. Eventually, the
remaining three Black-throated were housed in an aviary containing
several other birds that included Ross's Touracos, Black-headed Orioles,
Naked-throated Bell Birds, Kurrichane Thrushes, and some four or five
other species as well. The aviary was 60 by 20 feet, well planted, had a
stream running through it, and was piped for hot water heating during
the winter period. The pair of Orange-breasted were placed in another
aviary of very similar design, also in company of a number of other
birds. The time that these movements took place was May, 1961.
In April, 1962, one of the female Black-throated Cotingas began nest-
building in a hemlock tree situated at the lower end of the aviary,
overhanging a pool. It was an open cup-nest built within a basket
originally positioned in the expectation that the Kurrichane Thrushes
might make use of it. The materials employed were dried grasses,
rootlets, and horsehair, the latter item being woven in with the other
materials, binding them together. An egg was laid on 17th April,
followed by a second on the 18th, and incubation began with the laying
of the first egg. The eggs were pale brown, spotted with sepia, heaviest
at the thicker end, and measured 25 by 18 mm. Incubation was
carried out entirely by the female and it was noticed that, whenever the
other female approached the tree containing the nest, the male chased

her away. To avoid trouble, this spare female was transferred to an
adjoining aviary.
The male fed his mate on the nest and, when she vacated it for a
bath--they are ardent bathers--or for any other reason he stood guard
over the eggs standing on the edge of the nest, but making no attempt
to cover them. Unfortunately both eggs were clear and it was not until
12th June, that another was laid. This time there was a three-day
interval before the second of the clutch was produced. One egg hatched
on 20th June, and the second on 2nd July, but this chick died three days
later. Both parents fed the nestling, the initial diet consisting entirely
of live-food in the form of mealworm pupae, moths, flies, and other
insects. At ten days old, fruit and ground raw beef were included in their
feeding and the male even caught small minnows out of the pool and fed
these both to the young bird and to the female. These fish actually
were netted from a nearby brook for feeding to the Pigmy, White-
collared, and Striped Kingfishers we had and were just stored in the
pool for convenience. Having very little reference literature on this
species of bird it was enlightening to learn that they are live fish eaters.
They do not kill the fish in the normal manner of Kingfishers but just
swallow it alive, head first. Owing to the location of the nest it was not
possible to follow closely the progress of the nestling but, at fourteen
days old, it was found dead on the ground immediately below the nest.
At that stage it had a fair amount of green and yellow feathering
showing and its eyes were open.
No definite cause for the young bird to have fallen out could be
decided upon as the nest was quite deep and the nestling, so far as could
be seen, had shown no signs of great movement in the nest. Considera-
tion, however, had to be given to the parent bird having accidentally
pulled the chick out when disturbed by some other bird in the aviary.
To obviate any recurrence of such disturbances, a portion of the aviary
was divided off for the sole use of the pair of Cotingas. They certainly
were intent upon having a family for, on 24th July, yet another egg was
laid with a second on the 26th. Even this was not to do the trick for one
egg was clear and, although the other hatched, the chick died on the
second day. The female was still as keen as ever and promptly began
to rebuild the nest in the course of which she got entangled in a strand
of horsehair and hung herself.
It is very true that to breed softbills one must have plenty of patience
and be prepared for setbacks. With this pair of Cotingas we felt that
we had had a full share of the adversities attached to the hobby, but
never daunted and ever hopeful, the other Black-throated Cotinga
female was introduced to the widowed male the day following the
tragedy. Close observation of his reactions towards her was kept and,
although he was inclined to chase her around for the first few days, by
the fifth day they had settled down well together.

It was on 20th September, that this female was seen taking pieces of
nesting material up into a shallow, open box located on a beam just
to the side of the entrance door to the aviary. Actually it was the same
box that the Kurrichane Thrushes had begun to nest in earlier in the
year. Unlike the Thrushes, no mud was used in the construction of the
Cotinga's nest which was made up entirely of grasses, rootlets, and
horsehair. Incidentally, although the latter item was still supplied
despite the previous catastrophe, it was ensured that no strand was more
than 4 to 5 inches in length.
The first egg of this nesting was laid on 29th September, with a
second the following day. It was noted that the basic colour of the
second egg was much lighter than the first, in fact paler than any of the
eggs of previous nestings. As on prior occasions, the entire incubation
was carried out by the female, the male feeding her on the nest as he
had his first mate. In addition to this bedroom service she would
accept fruit, ground raw beef, and mealworms from any of us when
offered to her in our fingers, but only when she was on the nest. The
passage of time revealed that the first egg was clear but the second
hatched on 19th October. The female had become so accustomed to us
going up to her on the nest that it was possible to maintain a close watch
over the nestling without causing any disturbance. It was literally a
case of going up to the nest, for it was situated 7 feet above ground level.
The young bird's gape was bright orange and the bright pink little body
was sparsely covered with black nest down. At six days old quill
feathers were beginning to show and, by the 28th, its eyes were open
and green and yellow feathering could be discerned. The bill was
black, wide, and squat as compared to the fine red bills of the adult
birds. At twelve days, yellow tips were visible on the primaries and tail
feathers and the white edges to the wing-coverts were most distinct.
At this age it was left to itself for periods of forty-five minutes to an
hour at a time, so to avoid any chance of it clambering out of the nest,
a 4-inch strip of cardboard was stapled to the outside of the box
containing the nest. From 7th November, the nestling was perching on
the side of the nest, and vacated it on the 9th. From the very first
moment it was a strong flier and the following day was standing with its
parents at the top of a 16-foot tree.
As stated earlier, the male had assisted in rearing the nestling but,
now it was out of the nest, he took over the whole task, even finding time
to pass tid-bits to the female. By the second day out of the nest the
fledgling's bill had lost its youthful appearance and, although still
black, had taken on the shape of its parents'. The basic feather
colouring was dark green with yellowish underparts, orange-red legs
and feet with black claws. By 25th November, the tail feathers were
full down and it was feeding itself three days later, that is, at forty days
old. By 3rd December, the bill had begun to change colour at the base

and black feathers were showing at the throat, indicating that it was a
male. At three and a half months old it has almost obtained full adult
male plumage except that the black on the head still bears some yellow
flecks.
The female went to nest again on 14th November, laying two eggs
which she incubated steadily until deserting the nest on 1st December.
It was then disclosed that both eggs had been fertile but that the chicks
were dead in shell at about the twelfth day of forming. At the time of
writing this report, February, 1963, she is once more brooding two
chicks hatched on the 12th and 13th of the month. It had become
necessary to remove the first young male bird as the adult male objected
very forcibly to it going anywhere near to the nest, or to its mother
whenever she vacated it. After all the upsets we had had prior to the
successful rearing of the first young Cotinga, we did not wish to run any
undue risks of having anything happening to it and we also wanted to
give the new arrivals every chance of reaching maturity.
Being more interested in detailing all the nesting behaviour and
development of the young, I now realize that I have omitted giving any
description of the adult birds so I will endeavour to rectify that
forthwith. About 8 inches in total length, the sexes are dissimilar, the
male having a black head and throat with a yellow collar extending
from the base of the neck round to the upper throat. Here it blends in
with the yellowish-green underparts. The upper plumage is dark
green from the back of the head through to the tail, including the
wings, the upper coverts of which are white tipped. The tail feathers
are green above tipped with yellow, the undersides being dark grey,
almost black. The upper surface of the flight feathers also is green
edged with yellow, the back of the feathers being dark grey. The eye is
dark brown, almost thrush-like in its boldness and round shape. The
bill is bright red as are the legs and feet, the claws being black. The
female is green throughout, with slight yellow fleckings, and the upper
wing-coverts are white edged. The eye is brown with a fine yellow line
encircling it. The legs and feet are similar to the male's, even to the
black claws, but are a lighter shade of red. The bill also is red but
features a black tip, entirely lacking with the male.
I have not been able to trace any previous report of the breeding of a
Cotinga in captivity and further information on this would be appreci-
ated. It does appear, at first sight, that this may well be the third
first breeding in captivity to have been achieved by Mr. Boehm in 1962,
the other two having taken place in the upper portion of the same
aviary and were reported upon in the November-December, 1962--
Rails--and the January-February, 1963--Kurrichanes--issues of the
Avicultural Magazine.

(&apos;Continued from page 120 )
Three days spent in Melbourne is much too short a time to enable
me to give an impression of the State of Victoria, the coolest and one
of the most attractive parts of Australia ; I very much hope to pay it a
longer visit in the near future. Nevertheless, I saw in the vicinity of this
large and beautiful city exciting things which I want to mention here.
My friend Professor A. J. Marshall, of Monash University, one of his
assistants recently arrived from Scotland, Dr. Doward and Mr. M. C.
Downes, Superintendent of Game Management of the State, were
kind enough to take us to various areas where bird life is unusually
interesting.
The Biology Institute of the Monash University has j'ust been com-
pleted. It struck me as one of the best equipped that I have ever seen.
Dr. Marshall who heads it, has spent many years in England and has
seen much of the world ; he can be congratulated for its excellent
planning. One of its features is a large piece of land, with trees and
ponds, which has been set apart for living animals, both wild and
captive, a great and rare asset to such an institute. Cereopsis Geese,
among other birds, are studied there at present.
The Fisheries and Wildlife Department of the State of Victoria is
also making an effort to preserve, study and propagate game. The
reserves, stations and laboratories now being set up under Mr. Downes'
management, will certainly prove very useful. We visited with him
one day the marshy districts west of Melbourne where a large wild
life park is being established. Cormorants and Herons were nesting
on dead trees in and along the lakes, on which Black Swans,
Australian Shelducks, White-eyes and other ducks were numerous.
We spent another day in the hilly country to the east. We drove on
highways along which, in certain places, Koalas were common in
light eucalyptus forests. There were also many eastern Rosellas and
various passerine birds.
Higher up in the hills, in a more moist climate, we found one of the
greatest sights of Australia in Sherbrooke Forest, the famous Lyre
Bird Refuge. The road is lined with suburban houses, attractive in
large, well-shaded gardens, until you enter the forest. Huge eucalyptus
trees, E. regnans, a large species resembling the western Karri,
(. E . diversicolor ), raise their enormous trunks 250 feet high. As it is
always the case with such trees, they have only thin canopies which
do not stop the light, so that there is much undergrowth, particularly

<bodyText confidence="0.982732" page_id="56350224"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
large tree ferns (Dicksonia ), among which Lyre birds find favourable
conditions of life. These wonderful birds, one of the largest of all
passerines and peculiar to eastern Australia, are very numerous there,
as they are indeed in many suitable places in Victoria and in New
South Wales, thanks to proper conservation measures. But those of
Sherbrooke Forest have one peculiarity : they are tame. Elsewhere,
they usually can be heard, but seldom seen, as they are expert at
hiding in the brush and remain very shy. We could watch for a long
time a cock singing loudly a few yards away, and we saw several others.
In a more favourable season it is not unusual for a bird to display while
surrounded by a ring of visitors. There are many small birds in the
refuge, but, aside from the Lyre birds, the large number of Pennant's
Parrakeets, or Crimson Rosellas, which nest in the holes of the Giant
Eucalyptus, are a striking feature of this marvellous spot.
Another one is the Healesville Sanctuary at some distance from
Sherbrooke Forest, also in the hills. This excellent and almost complete
collection of live local animals and birds has been very well installed,
in pretty natural surroundings by Mr. David Fleay, an expert
Australian naturalist, who now possesses a private wild life park near
Brisbane. The Victoria State however now keeps up the Sanctuary.
A perfect Platypus, swimming briskly in a large aquarium, was the
most striking exhibit at the time of my visit, but there were many
other excellent displays, particularly a large, thickly planted aviary
with several Lyre birds. Wild birds also abound at Healesville. Small
Honey-eaters and White-eyes feed here and there, entering pens
through the large mesh wire netting, and we saw King Parrakeets and
Gang-gang Cockatoos in the high trees.
Melbourne has large and beautiful parks and the suburban gardens
are pretty, well planted and well kept. The temperate climate gives it
quite a European aspect, to which many introduced birds contribute.
As everywhere else in the southern half of Australia, Starlings, Black-
birds, Goldfinches and Skylarks are very common. There are also
many Song Thrushes, some Greenfinches and Tree sparrows, and two
Asiatic birds have also been acclimatized : Common Mynahs and
Spotted Turtle Doves.

Alice Springs lays practically in the centre of the continent, and it
is a long flight from Adelaide, over arid country and even true desert.
But there is a good deal of vegetation in the country around the lively
town : large eucalyptus, various small trees and brush. It is astonishing
that such growth thrives under dry conditions (3 to 4 inches of rain a
year) but Australian trees and shrubs are better adapted to an arid
climate than any others. There are many long, rocky ridges, and dry
red hills. Gaps in the former occur here and there, forming striking

gorges, usually with permanent, but barren pools of fresh water. It is a
strange, awesome, but picturesque scenery, where bird life is abundant
and interesting. Red-tailed Black Cockatoos and Galahs are often
seen, and also Many-coloured and Port Lincoln Parrakeets. Flocks of
Budgerigars are met with, some very large, as well as great numbers
of Diamond Doves and Zebra Finches, while Cockatiels fly gracefully
here and there. There were so many of those common birds, so well
known in captivity, on some dead trees surrounding a water tank, that
it incongruously reminded one of an over-crowded bird shop !
Water birds are naturally scarce in the desert. But we saw several
species of Dotterels around pools, and a few Pink-eared ducks were
swimming on a large tank. Pratincoles swarmed along the road, and
there were lots of birds in the bush, among which Crimson and Orange
Chats ( Epthianura ) were particularly attractive. On rocky, red hills
live two of the most striking birds of the district : Painted Finches and
Plumed Ground Doves, both quite common.
We had a glimpse of the Ground Cuckoo-Shrike ( Pteropodocys ) and
the Red-backed Kingfisher ( Halcyon pyrrhopygius ) and many Masked
Wood Swallows flew and perched along the road. The curious " Song
Larks 53 ( Cinchloramphus ) were common near irrigated cultivation, looking
and behaving much like some African Pipits. The common Australian
Pipit abounded there as almost in every other part of the country.
We had a very good idea of the local bird life, thanks to Mr. A. E.
Newsome, naturalist of the Animal Industry Branch, and to Mr. and
Mrs. Ray Rothwell. Mrs. Rothwell is an enthusiastic student and
watcher ; she knows the local birds extremely well and her kind help
in taking us through the country in search of them was invaluable.
V.-- Northern Territory
We next flew to Darwin, on the northern coast. The country is
fairly flat and hot, but rather well wooded. Although the rainfall is
considerable, it has a long dry season. Eucalyptus and Pandanus
dominate, forming extensive forests. There are open spaces, and the
Commonwealth Government operates in the vicinity a large experi-
mental station dedicated to rice cultivation. We spent a memorable
day there, about forty miles north-east of the town. There are marshes
and ponds, much reduced at the end of the dry season (October),
where the concentration of water birds is tremendous, both on the
water and the banks. Magpie Geese were abundant, most of them
dyed brown by the ferruginous, muddy water, and hardly recognizable
at first. Many Grey Teal and Black Ducks swim along with the lovely
Green Pygmy geese. Whistling Ducks (Dendrocygna arcuata) are numerous.
The most interesting species, however, was the Radjah Shelduck.
Dozens of them were seen on the banks of different ponds, behaving
much as Common Shelducks do in Europe ; but they live near fresh

water, not on the sea shore ; they look beautiful on the wing. There
are also many Pelicans, Cranes, Darters, White-necked Herons, Royal
Spoonbills, Plumed Egrets, Glossy and Straw-necked Ibises, Stilts,
Avocets, Whimbrels, Dotterels, Masked Plovers, Terns, Jacanas and
other shore-birds. Feral Water Buffaloes wallow in the water by the
hundreds. For the first time in my life I saw together over twenty
Black-necked Jabirus, a usually solitary stork. Red-tailed Black
Cockatoos perched on trees, as well as hundreds of Corellas. Bar-
shouldered Doves and Finches abound in the bushes : Crimson,
{phaeton) Black-rumped Bichenow, Long-tailed, Masked and Chestnut-
breasted. This fascinating area constitutes an important reserve for
waterfowl, which spread through the country to breed during the
rainy season.

In September, 1961, I was able to make another series of tests with
ants at the London Zoo which added six species to the list of birds that
I have recorded anting ( Avicult . Mag., 1961, 124-132), making a grand
total of 102 species. The additional species were :

Family PIPRIDAE (manakins) :

Of these, the species shown in heavy type have not previously been
recorded as anting, while the Pipridae is a " new 55 family. Another
species that I also saw anting for the first time was the Long-tailed
Glossy Starling ( Lamprotornis caudatus ), previously included in my list
on the authority of Robert Gillmor (ibid., p. 128).
Finally, two small corrections to my 1961 paper : (1) p. 128, third
line from the bottom, the additional species referred to should number
seventy not seventy-five; (2) p. 129, the family PYCNONOTIDAE
should have appeared in heavy type as Mrs. Bucksey's record seems to
be the only one for any species of bulbul.

Introduction
I must begin this article with the admission that I have not been
very successful with this species. Why then write about it ? It is true
that, so far as one can judge from the success of certain Sunday papers,
there exist in our civilized and enlightened country many people who
derive satisfaction from reading about the failures, disappointments,
and humiliations of others, but I assume (rightly, I hope) that our
readers have no such ignoble impulses. I feel, nevertheless, justified in
offering my scanty observations because, so far as I can find out, very
little has been published on the behaviour of this species. It was bred
in the 1930s (and a photo of the young appeared in our Magazine)
but the account that accompanied it gave little detailed information.
Perhaps others have been more successful than I and, if so, it is to be
hoped they will write giving their observations and commenting on
mine.
The Black-capped Waxbill or Black-crowned Waxbill (Estrilda
nonnula) comes from the central areas of Africa and appears to be a
bird of forest clearings and grasslands among or near trees or brush.
It is a very lovely little bird whose black cap and faint, soft calls give
it a remarkable, if superficial, resemblance to a Bullfinch. The latter
is, of course, the most " estrildine-like " of the cardueline finches. It
(the Black-capped Waxbill) is a finely-barred dark grey above and
greyish-white (cleaner and whiter in the male as a rule) below, with
a black cap and rather broad, black tail. The upper tail-coverts,
lower part of the rump, and a line along the flanks (see sketches) are
a rosy crimson. The bill is patterned in red and black on both
mandibles.*
In parts of its range this species overlaps with the very similar
species --Estrilda atricapilla. This latter differs in being rather darker
on the underparts, having the red areas a little more extensive and of
a more brilliant red, and in having the upper mandible entirely black.
The two species occur together (Chapin, 1939) and no obvious
differences of voice, behaviour or ecology have been so far recorded
for them. It would be most surprising, however, if significant differences
did not in fact exist. I recall reading, in an old number of our
Magazine, that a collector (I think it was Cecil Webb) who caught
numbers of both species found atricapilla impossible to keep alive and
thought this must be due to different feeding habits.
* In the line sketches, which have no pretension to art or detailed accuracy, the
solid black parts of the plumage are shaded dark, the red parts with cross bars. The
red parts of the bill are unshaded.

I 5 O DEREK GOODWIN-SOME NOTES ON BLACK-CAPPED WAXBILLS
E. nonnula does not seem particularly easy to keep in captivity. I have
yet to see one, including, alas, my own, that looked really fit and well
for more than a few weeks at a time. Loss of feathers in quantity
from all parts of the body, but especially the shoulders and neck,
seems a common trouble (all the birds I have purchased have had this
to some degree when first acquired) and is certainly not caused by
plucking during mutual preening, or allo-preening as it is now called.
I think the trouble will eventually prove due to some dietary deficiency,
though it is hard to say what. I have, as will be seen, tried mine with
all sorts of foods but although they have often temporarily regained full
plumage this happy state has never lasted for very long before bare
patches, at least on neck and shoulders, began to reappear. However,
of the pair still living the hen has now been in complete plumage for
some months and the cock, who had gone very bare on neck and back,
has nearly regrown his plumage on these areas. In his case this regrowth
started about two months after I had commenced giving the birds
Hasting's " Multivitamin " in their drinking water every other day.
I am hoping this was a case of " cause and effect " and that there may
yet be brighter days ahead for this pair and their owner !
Individuals Studied and their Conditions
I purchased a cock and two hens (all the former owner had for sale)
in early November of i960. A few months later I sent off for another
cock which the vendor assured me was in good condition. It certainly
was not when it arrived (and it had only a few hours travelling as I met
the train) and died within a few days. Later I managed to purchase
another cock. As I have said the four remaining birds seldom looked
really fit for more than a week or two at a time and the original male
died in January, 1962. A little later I gave away the spare hen to
someone who had a unpaired cock in a large outdoor aviary. I took
her to her new home myself and she and the male greeted one
another rapturously, but I have been given no further information
about her.
My Black-caps were kept in the same small, well-lighted room as
my other waxbills, but at times were temporarily placed in cages in
order to elicit calling between mates or companions thus separated.
Especially during the first year, and to a less extent subsequently, they
showed a certain amount of sexual and reproductive behaviour but
never got as far as laying or even completing a nest. It will be appreci-
ated, therefore, that it is quite possible that much, or even all, of the
display behaviour I have seen was being shown at a rather low
intensity. Similarly the remarks on feeding and food preferences
must be qualified by the fact that (in contradistinction to my other
waxbills) they cannot be said to have really thriven on the diet.

Small yellow millet, maw seed and canary seed are supplied ad lib.
So are maggots ; mealworms and whiteworms are given at least
three times a week. Seeding and flowering grasses, fresh turfs of young
growing grass, soaked or sprouting millet sprays, flowering or seeding
knotgrass ( Polygonum aviculare) , and Persicaria are supplied as available.
Usually at least one of these extras is supplied on most days. Mineral
grit, crushed dried eggshells, and bird sand and, of course, fresh water
are supplied daily. When they can be obtained fresh ant pupae, ants,
and greenfly are given. Home-made sponge-cake is also given daily,
crumbled and placed with the millet in a large tray
The Black-capped Waxbills have varied their diet from time to time
as when one, for a period of some months, ate quantities of blow-fly
pupae. In the main, however, they take principally millet, both dry
and soaked spray millet, maw seed (of which they eat much more per
bird than any of the other waxbills do), and sponge-cake which they,
like the Rosy-rumped Waxbills, soon started to eat. Of wild foods they
are fondest of knotgrass, annual meadow grass ( Poa annua), wood
melick grass, and ryegrass, although eating most other grasses (I mean
the ripe or green seeds of flower buds of them) and also chickweed,
Persicaria and, sometimes, unripe dandelion seeds if the head is
broken open for them
For a long time they showed little interest in insect food other than
greenfly. Even ant pupae were only occasionally eaten and maggots
and whiteworms were left untouched. This state of affairs changed
in February, 1963, however, when the remaining hen started to eat
mealworms and blow-fly pupae, at first in small amounts then in some
quantity. After a few weeks her mate began to do the same. I will not
say " to copy her ", since there was no evidence of this and too often
birds are described as learning from others of their kind when the
evidence is merely of a "post hoc ergo propter hoc" kind. Now
(3rd May, 1963) they have become avid eaters of mealworms and
blow-fly pupae. The former are held crosswise in the bill and chewed
slowly and deliberately, passing first to one side then to the other until
all the inside parts have been forced out and consumed. This is in
some contrast to the less efficient and more wasteful mumblings and
bangings used by Blue Waxbills ( Uraeginthus sp.) and Dark Firefinches
(Lagonosticta rubricata ) when eating mealworms. Indeed the Black-
capped Waxbills often take and " finish off" half-eaten mealworms
that the others have discarded.
Like all my waxbills, the Black-caps eat an appreciable amount of
grit and crushed eggshell, often taking these substances shortly after
awakening in the morning and before they feed, apparently, therefore,
on an empty stomach.
When feeding they show the agility and grace of typical waxbills of

the genus Estrilda , although their movements appear (and I think
actually are) a little slower than those of Red-eared and Rosy-rumped
Waxbills (. Estrilda troglodytes and Estrilda rhodopygd). They have the
same clockwork-like swinging the tail to one side and then back,
sometimes with a tendency to spread the tail feathers as they do so.
Food is often held down with the foot and I have seen this done on the
ground (or rather the floor of the room) as well as when the bird has
taken a grass stem into the branches. Kunkel found that in the
Estrilda species he studied (Kunkel, 1959), the foot was not used for
holding unless the bird was perched.
Voice
All the calls of this species that I have heard are very high-pitched,
thin, and faint in sound as compared with the calls of other waxbills
known to me.
Contact and Flight-intention Calls
If the bird is uneasy, especially when restlessly flying to and fro it
frequently utters a thin, high " Tee-tee 55 or " Tsee-tsee-tsee " ;
especially at the moment of taking flight. This might be considered
either as a flight-intention call or a contact call according to whether
one named it from its probable motivation or its probable function.
It is certainly homologous to the " Tsit-tsit 55 call of the Blue-breasted
Waxbill (Goodwin, 1959).
If a Black-capped Waxbill is out of sight of its mate or companions
it gives calls that to my ear differ from the above only in being somewhat
louder and longer-drawn : " Tseee-tseee 55 or " Tseee-tseee-tseee
Others hearing this answer with the same call. This is perfectly
homologous with the contact call of the blue waxbills ( Uraeginthus ) as
I have previously described it (Goodwin, 1959 and 1962). It must,
however, be pointed out that some authors (e.g. Harrison, 1962) have
used the term " contact call 55 for the notes that are commonly given
by active (and probably usually slightly uneasy) birds still in visual
contact with each other as well as the louder (and in some cases rather
different otherwise) call that is typically given to establish or maintain
contact between birds at a distance from or out of sight of each other.
The Alarm Call
Differs (to my ears) from the intense version of the contact call only
in having a distinct " r " sound in it which is completely lacking in all
the other calls of the species that I have heard. Could be written

The Nest Call
A faint, soft twittering, very like that of the Golden-breasted
Waxbill, but running up and down the scale more and very C{ pure 55
and " sweet " in tone. Used by both sexes when nest-calling.
Song
I am not sure I have heard the " song " of this species. A female
once gave what sounded like a very loud, long version of the contact
call and the male I have now recently uttered a call much like the
alarm followed by a contact-call-like note when displaying : " Trreee-
teee". On other occasions males never sang when displaying (or made
any sound so far as I could hear), which suggests that they may not
have displayed at full intensity.

Social Behaviour and Display

This posture, common to all waxbills and some other estrildines
(see Kunkel, 1959, Goodwin, 1959, Harrison, 1962), is very marked in
the Black-capped Waxbill as, at high intensity, the tail and head are
both twisted at a fairly sharp angle (see sketch). In this display
(Harrison's " recognition posture ") one bird hops or sidles up to

high intensity the body is somewhat tilted and the flank feathers some-
what raised so that the red on the flank joins the red of the upper
tail-coverts (both being very fully visible to the bird displayed to)
without the wing " bisecting " them as it does when held normally.
This posture is shown both between mates--especially if they have
been separated and then come together again--and towards other
individuals, especially strangers. It is not shown between birds that
are mutually known and mutually hostile. Or perhaps one should say
overtly hostile since some aggressive elements may (see Kunkel, 1959)
be involved when this display is given. It seems, however, primarily
an expression of sexual interest (often at very low intensity) and to
function as a friendly or appeasing greeting. As in other waxbills it is
usually followed by, or interspersed with, very deliberate bill-wiping.
This displacement gesture, being very much more slowly performed,
is much more immediately obvious in the Black-capped Waxbill than
in other species.

feet not leaving the perch for a moment as those of blue waxbills
usually do when they display. Head at lowest point of movement
horizontal or nearly so. The display is usually interspersed and
prefaced by little, jerky, side-to-side movements of the head, but
I suspect this may be due to a tendency to stop displaying or to look
around for the unresponsive mate.
On other occasions I saw a male take a grass stem, fly up with it,
and then execute deliberate upward thrusts of the head rather different
(head held at an angle) from that described above. This latter move-
ment appeared exactly the same as one of the nest-building movements
used by this (and other) species, so I think it was merely a nest-building
movement performed in vacuo. Of course the stem display is generally
(and probably correctly) thought to be derived largely from this or
(in some other species) other nest-building movements.
On two occasions I saw a female give a very intense version of the
stem display, but without the stem. She held herself rather more
horizontal and with feathers, especially on belly, rather more erected
than in displaying males and, while displaying, held her bill open and
gave a long, intense version of the contact call (or the female song ?).
Little can be deduced from only two observations, but it may be worth
mentioning that this female displayed in this manner in exactly the same

Mandibulation
As with other waxbills a rapid opening and shutting of the mandibles
is shown in situations of inhibited aggression, particularly in " tiffs "
between pairs or other individuals that are not very hostile. It often
follows (but never, in my experience, immediately precedes) actual
attack. The bird showing it will not attack further and usually follows
it by more definite appeasing behaviour, such as offering the head for
preening.
When mandibulating the bird nearly always faces its partner directly
and it seems likely that, at least when it is done at high intensity, the
mouth markings are made visible. The striking mouth markings of
young estrildines have often been commented on but, at least in the
blue waxbills ( Uraegiithus angolensis , U. bengalus, and U. cyanocephalus )
and the Dark Firefinch ( Lagonosticta rubricata ), they persist in the adult
and it seems probable that they have an appeasing function in situations
of marital strife.

Mutual Preening or Allo-preening

The latest term decreed for this behaviour is allo-preening, which
now takes precedence not only over the admittedly unsatisfactory
" mutual preening " but also over the term " hetero-preening ", which
was the first one substituted. No doubt by the time this appears in

larger size it would offer its head but when (as more often happened)
the little Goldbreast was the species chosen then the Black-capped
Waxbill initially " showed its superiority 55 by preening the latter.
The only thing that needs to be added to my previous remarks on this
behaviour (Goodwin, i960) is that although inter-specific associations
start, and often long continue, on a purely dominant-subordinate basis
with only the dominant bird doing the preening, they may change
their character in time. They then become mutual and the little
Goldbreast that for months or years has been preened by, say, a Black-
capped or Blue-breasted Waxbill, and not reciprocated back now
preens its stronger companion " turn and turn about 55 . Human

THE HIMALAYAN SNOW COCK
( Tetraogallus himalayensis Gray)
By Wolfgang Grummt (Curator of Birds, Zoopark Berlin, Berlin-

Five species of the genus Tetraogallus ( caspius , caucasicus, himalayensis ,
altaicus, tibetanus) occur in the high mountains of Asia. The Snow
Cock closely resembles the Rock Partridge in habits but is the size of
a Capercaillie, the sexes are similar in colour but the cock is somewhat
heavier than the hen. The strong feet of the cock, with distinctive
short spurs, are particularly striking.
All species of the genus Tetraogallus spend the summer above the
tree line in the high alpine meadows below the snow line which are
covered with rhododendrons. In winter they move to lower areas
and like to be in the company of Ibex, which scrape away the snow
under which lies their food.
The food of Snow Cock consists principally of leaves and buds of
high mountain plants and the corms of various species of Allium, they
also eat insects. In winter they eat, in addition, berries, seeds of various
conifers, and the fruit of wild roses.

During the breeding season they keep in pairs. While the hen is
brooding the cock usually stays quite close by and raises up his voice,
which consists of a whole series of calls, especially in the morning.
The care and guidance of the young is undertaken by both parents.
The clutch consist of 7-15, relatively small, hard-shelled eggs.
Members of the genus Tetraogallus are extremely rarely seen in
captivity.
On 20th January, 1959, for the first time, the Berlin Zoopark
received three Tetraogallus himalayensis himalayensis from the Moscow
animal dealer " Zoocentre 55 in transit for an animal dealer in West
Germany. These extremely interesting birds were not very timid and
also in very good condition. As during their short stay with us the
birds at once took food, and we found them most attractive, we
decided to attempt to keep them in captivity. On 6th May, 1961, we
received from Moscow three Himalayan Snow Cocks, an old cock,
one young one, apparently a first-year bird, and a hen. Though the
old cock was not in particularly good feather and also had a somewhat
overgrown upper mandible the other two specimens were in good
condition. After quarantine we put the Snow Cocks in an aviary of
about 60 square metres in size. The aviary, which faces south, was
arranged so as to provide a suitable living place for these birds ;
stones were piled against the back wall, which was roofed over, about
two-thirds of the floor was covered with grass, the rest of the space
with sand, and several stones about the size of footballs were placed
about. A few shrubs were planted for protection from too much sun.
For the first few days the Snow Cocks were very timid and remained
at the back of the aviary. Only in the early morning when there were
no visitors and they felt undisturbed and unobserved, did they come
to the wire-netting at the front of the aviary. But after a short time
the young cock uttered a long drawn-out " koooo After a few
weeks the birds were so tame that even when there were crowds of
visitors they showed no fear and took no notice of humans. All three
birds got on well together and I never saw any disputes or fights.
During great heat they liked to take sun baths ; they lay down flat on
the grass or sand in the scorching sun and stretched out their wings,
often panting heavily. They frequently stood on the stones in the
aviary and at night either roosted on the stones against the back wall
or lay in a corner between stones. They never perched though they
had the opportunity of doing so.
The moult started at the end of June, beginning with the head and
breast. The flight-feathers were dropped from the middle of July.
The young cock and the hen came through the moult in a short time
but the old cock, which from the beginning was not in very good
condition, only moulted partially.
In August the hen died suddenly. The post-mortem revealed that

her crop was burnt. She had swallowed a lighted cigarette which
some stupid visitor had probably thrown to her. The old cock lived
till 5th January ; the post-mortem showed an infection of Heterakis,
but this was not the only cause of death. At the beginning of May
the young cock showed unspecific signs of sickness. It no longer ate
well and mostly sat motionless in a corner with its feathers puffed out.
It died on 24th May, in spite of all veterinary aid, and the post-
mortem showed that it had bird cholera.
In June, 1962, we received a further three Himalayan Snow Cocks
which unfortunately all arrived in very bad condition. All three had
considerably overgrown upper mandibles. Two days after arrival
they were dead.
Our experience with Snow Cocks shows that it is by all means
possible to keep these interesting birds in captivity so long as they are
well acclimatized before they are received. It certainly should also be
possible to breed these imposing birds in captivity in due course.
In accordance with their feeding habits in the wild, the Snow Cocks
were fed principally on fresh green food. Every day the three birds
ate a whole pailful of freshly cut grass and also liked the leaves of clover
and lucerne ; in addition we gave them mixed corn. They would not
eat soft food with ants eggs which we provided regularly for them.
Three very similar races of the Himalayan Snow Cock [himalayensis ,
gronbczewski , and koslowi) occur in the high mountain slopes of the
West Himalayas, the Pamirs, Tien Shan, Kunlun, and Turkestan as
far as the Koko Nor Mountains.
Our birds were captured in the West Pamirs and therefore belonged
to the race Tetraogallus h. himalayensis. The crown and back of head
and nape are ash grey, sides of head light grey shading into white.
Throat white surrounded by a chestnut-coloured band ; on the sides
of the neck a chestnut-coloured stripe descends from the eye. The
breast is light grey with black markings. The remaining underparts
are finely flecked with grey and brown, the flanks being more bluish-
grey with cream and black stripes. The upper parts are greyish-black
with longitudinal rust-coloured stripes. The primaries are white with
brown tips and the tail feathers reddish-brown with brown flecks.
There is an orange-gold strip of bare skin behind the eyes. The iris is
dark brown, bill horn-coloured, and feet orange-red.

The Galah or Rose-breasted Cockatoo, as it is often called overseas,
is undoubtedly the most widespread and abundant of all the parrots
inhabiting Australia. Most people in this country are familiar with this
handsome pink and grey bird in the wild state, while its popularity
as an aviary and cage bird is exceeded only by that of the Sulphur-
crested Cockatoo ( Cacatua galerita). Indeed so common is this species
that it ranks high in the list of our most abundant birds.
First described by Vieillot in 1817 from a specimen received at the
Paris Museum, the Galah had to wait the extension of the new colonies
to the inland regions before it was made known to science. Kuhl, in
1820, described it as Psittacus eos. Bonaparte formed the genus Eolophus
in 1854, but this was not readily accepted as Cacatua was used by most
ornithologists to cover this species. With the change from eos to
roseicapilla because of priority, this name remained for some time and
is the most popular term used at present. Eolophus was again brought
to the front lines by Mathews in 1917 but his views were not generally
accepted and Cacatua roseicapilla remained as the usual name for the
Galah. The author, however, is strongly in favour of the retention of
Eolophus and believes it must take preference over Cacatua. This will
be discussed fully in another section of this paper.
A very attractive combination of pink and grey is exhibited in the
general plumage of this bird. The short crest is white with a pink
suffusion through the base of the feathers. The nape, neck, cheeks and
underparts are pink which merges with a greyish-white on the lower
abdomen and vent. The back, wings, and tail are pale grey becoming
much darker towards the wing tips and the end of the square tail. The
scapulars are very pale, almost white. This marking is very noticeable
in flight. The orbital ring is red, while the feet are grey and the bill
white. The colour of the iris is quite an important sexual differentiation
and will be discussed fully later. It is a medium-sized bird and a pair
taken by the author near White Cliffs, N.S.W., on 21st August, 1962,

Systematic Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99818075" page_id="56350241"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
As mentioned previously there has been considerable controversy
over the generic name applicable to this species. Cacatua is almost
universally used but, in the author's opinion, this cannot be justified.
He thinks that the Galah should not belong to the same genus as the
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo. It is outside the scope of this paper to deal
with the over-all systematics of the Cacatuinae but the author is by
no means satisfied with the present arrangement generally adopted
for the white cockatoos. Much research and investigation is being put
into this subject and the final results will be subsequently published in
another paper. However, at present the author is strongly of the
opinion that the genus Eolophus should be reintroduced for the Galah
and this is hereby formally advocated.
At the turn of the century a detailed study of the cranial osteology
of many species of parrots was carried out and this produced many
differences within the Cacatuinae. However, very little assistance was
given to the classification of this group because of the lack of a definite
conclusive pattern. Many species, including E. roseicapilla, differed
from others to which they were obviously related, while they resembled
species which were obviously far more removed in relationship. This
was brought about by many factors, one of the most prominent of
which was adaptations arising from diverse feeding and general habits.
In assessing the validity of separating the Galah from the Sulphur-
crested Cockatoo one can only be guided by a combination of
differences. Present investigations being undertaken by the author
and other interested parties concern such important factors as blood
analysis and general protein structure, but these are only in the pre-
liminary stages and for the purposes of this paper we will have to be
content with relative differences.
It is widely accepted, and rightly so, that plumage colouration is not
an important factor in the systematics of birds as this property can be
altered by environment and other conditions. However, colouration
is a very good indicative factor and as such should not be completely
overlooked. No person can deny the strong plumage differences
between E. roseicapilla and C. galerita.
Rather than give a list of the differences concerned and be guilty
of repetition when each is dealt with individually, it is the author's
intention to bring to the reader's notice these apparent conflicting
properties when discussing call-notes, flight, field habits, etc.
It would not be superfluous to mention here work that has been done
in the field of ethology concerning the parrots. Some ornithologists
have drawn attention to a definite pattern that exists in the manner of
head-scratching used by members of Psittaciformes. The Cacatuinae,
for instance, all scratch under the wing while the Platycercinae invari-
ably scratch over and so on. However, with the cockatoos one member,

the Galah, often shows a tendency to scratch over with two records of
captive birds actually scratching in this manner. The ethological field
is a comparatively new one and hence has not gained the importance
it will receive when ethologists become more proficient. It is
undoubtedly a most important field and will become one of the major
aspects of zoology and especially of ornithology. There is a wonderful
opportunity existing for the coupling together of ethology and system-
atics. In spite of the retarding circumstances, the above example of
the head-scratching patterns does add a little weight to the revival of
Eolophus.
Distribution of Eolophus roseicapilla.
From within the Galah's distribution, which includes most of the
interior of the continent, five subspecies have been described. Eolophus
roseicapilla roseicapilla , the typical race, inhabits the eastern areas and
is the most familiar form.
Mathews, in 1911, tabulated Eolophus roseicapilla kuhli from a specimen
taken on South Alligator River, Northern Territory. This race differs

from the typical form in its overall paler colouration and in having the
whole crest strongly suffused with pink. The following two subspecies
have been incorporated into the western race. The smaller size of this
bird as mentioned by Mathews is negligible.
Eolophus roseicapilla assimilis was also described by Mathews in 1911
from a specimen collected at Laverton, mid-western Australia. This race
was said to differ from E. r. roseicapilla in its overall paler colouration
and from E. r. kuhli in its larger size. It is synonymous with the above.
Mathews described yet another race in 1911 when a specimen
collected in north-west Australia gave rise to Eolophus roseicapilla
derbyana with its extremely pale colouration as the distinguishing
factor. With the combining of all these races into the one subspecies,
we have E. r. kuhli with the range of the western parts of the continent.
With E. r. kuhli of the west meeting the typical race in Central
Australia we have a large area inhabited by intermediate birds. It was
from within this area between Claraville and Ruby Gay that S. A. White
collected a specimen on 12th September, 1913. Mathews, on examining
the specimen, tabulated, in 1917, Eolophus roseicapilla howei. This race
was reported to differ from the typical race in having a much paler
plumage with the grey being of a bluer shade, while the under surface
was paler than in E. r. kuhli. This paler colouration of the underparts
is often similar to that of the birds of the north-west. The author
cannot justify the general acceptance of this variation and advocates
its dismissal. The overall situation of two good subspecies inhabiting
the east and west respectively and an area of gradation in the centre
is thus reached.

Mother nature was indeed generous to the Galah, endowing it with
a rich plumage of pink and grey blended together in a most appealing
manner. The rose-pink underparts are exhibited to perfection by the
contrast provided by the soft grey of back and wings. The white cap
and recumbent crest complete this splendid colour scheme.
As mentioned previously, the Galah inhabits most of the interior of
Australia. The inner areas of all the mainland states form the distribu-
tion range of this species. It has been accidentally introduced to
Tasmania. This cockatoo is increasing in numbers and is rapidly
extending its range. In parts of the Southern Highlands where it was
a complete stranger a decade ago it is now common and is building
up its population rapidly. The Nullarbor Plain, where these birds were
previously considered as wanderers from the north, has seen an estab-
lishment of populations. However, owing to the lack of suitable nesting
sites in this very arid region, there will undoubtedly be a movement of
most birds found there. In times of severe drought E. roseicapilla visits
the coastal areas, but this is not a common occurrence.

164 JOSEPH M. FORSHAW-THE PARROTS OF AUSTRALIA
As would be expected from the nature of the range of this species, open
forest, timber along rivers and watercourses, plains and desert country,
and cultivated farmlands are the favourite haunts. Essentially a bird
of the dry arid regions it has shown much adaptation in its extension
to the colder regions of southern New South Wales. In this district
the mountains are interspersed throughout with valleys and hills which
have been cleared and opened up for grazing. This has been the cause
of the Rose-breasted Cockatoo's invasion there, while the heavily-
timbered mountainous country in other districts has been rejected.
As with the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, 3,800 feet appears to be the
restricting altitude in the southern areas.
Most farms and properties have flocks of Galahs frequenting their
pastures, crops and haystacks, searching for seeds and grain which
form the bulk of their diet. Bulbous roots, greenfood and gum tips
are the other main food items. The birds spend many hours in the
morning and before dusk feeding on the ground, over which they move
with their characteristic waddling gait. Occasionally a squabble will
come about as two individuals meet. There will be a flapping of wings,
a raising of the crest and a loud screech. The remainder of the flock
will cease feeding and, with crests raised in alarm, investigate the
commotion. When all is quiet the feeding will resume.
Unfortunately the feeding habits of this handsome bird make it a
noxious pest in most districts. It will congregate in very large flocks and
raid cereal crops causing considerable damage. Although not capable
of as much destruction as Cacatua galerita , many Galahs are destroyed
every year by pastoralists. They have not developed any warning system
such as that used by the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo. When birds are
shot the flock will take to the wing and settle at the other end of the
paddock or in nearby trees often affording another opportunity for the
farmer. However, when, as is often the case, they join forces with
the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo they will always take advantage of that
bird's sentinel system. As can be readily appreciated the damage
caused when these two cockatoos congregate together can be very
serious indeed. However, there is another weight on the balance and
this species is most valuable in many areas in keeping numerous plant
pests in check. The settlement of, and consequent provision of many
new watering places in, outback areas has brought about an increase
in the population of many birds, particularly the Galah. The seed-eating
activities of these birds is an important adverse factor in the successful
regeneration of Saltbush (Atriplex vesicarium ). Flocks of these birds settle
on an area and, after eating all the fallen seeds, attack the ripening
fruits. The heavy seed-eating activities have been borne out by all the
crop contents examined by the author. The crops of the two birds from
Lockhart, N.S.W., contained seeds of grasses and grain with small pieces
of grit and gravel, no doubt used to aid digestion.

The collection of sand and grit on the country roads of Australia
proves a fatal act for many birds as hundreds of Galahs are killed by
motorists. It is by no means uncommon for a driver, on rounding a
curve, to have a flock of these birds rise from the road in front of him
screeching all the while.
The call of E. roseicapilla differs remarkably from that of C. galerita
and other white cockatoos. It is very difficult to describe, but is best
likened to a rather high-pitched double screech bordering on a cry.
A single screech of a harsher tone is also often used, particularly when
the bird is alarmed or excited. The call is one of the differences
mentioned in the Systematic Discussion.
Another strong difference is provided by the flight of E. roseicapilla ,
which is unlike that of other white cockatoos. The flight of the Galah
is laboured with slow full wing beats. The glide is used when coming
to alight on a tree or on the ground but never forms part of the regular
flight pattern. These beautiful cockatoos are very strong on the wing
and are capable of much manoeuvring. While in flight they are at their
best and their beauty excels. As the flock twists and turns the rays of the
summer sun highlight first the rose-pink underparts and then the soft
grey of the back. It is a most impressive spectacle. These birds seem
to enjoy flying and after awakening in the early dawn the flocks spend
some time flying through the trees which form their roost. The author
will never forget a dawn scene on the banks of the Lachlan River at
Balranald, N.S.W., in the summer of 1962. As the first rays of sunlight
filtered through the large river gums, a large flock of Galahs, com-
prising approximately 500 birds, left its roost and weaved its way
through the tall trees flashing pink then grey in the early dawn glow.
The same routine is also followed at dusk before the birds go to roost.
Although relatively powerful in flight, the Galah often falls prey
to the larger members of Falconiformes, particularly the majestic
Wedge-tailed Eagle (. Aquila audax) and the smaller, but fierce, Little
Eagle ( Hieraaetus morphnoides) . Indeed there is a record of a Wedge-
tailed Eagle rearing a brood entirely on Galahs. However, these
appear to be the only natural enemies of this species, although the
a goanna 53 takes many nestlings.
With the arrival of E. roseicapilla in the southern areas of eastern
New South Wales field comparisons between the bird and the Gang-
gang Cockatoo ( Callocephalan fimbriatum ) have become possible. One
striking feature of these observations has been the remarkable similarity
in the flight of both birds. Each species has the laboured flight and the
tumbling movement. This, of course, does not mean that the two species
are closely related but it does indicate that they may be closer than
most authorities previously imagined.
Sexing is comparatively simple with E. roseicapilla . The males are
heavier birds and are generally richer in plumage. However, the colour

of both sexes deepens with age and this often upsets the comparisons.
The male also has a larger head with a broader bill. The colour
of the iris of the female is orange-red, while that of her mate is dark
brown. The use of the combination of these distinctions rarely
fails satisfactorily to differentiate the sexes. The Galah and the
Maj&apos;or Mitchell Cockatoo (Cacatua leadbeateri) differ from the other
cockatoos in having this sharp, clear difference in the colour of the
iris.
The courting display of this species is simple but impressive. Aero-
batics always form part of this display. The male struts towards the
female along a branch. With crest raised and head bobbing to and
fro he approaches uttering a soft wheezing call note. The female leaves
the branch and wings her way through the trees and across the
paddocks pursued by the persistent male. When she alights he repeats
his display and succeeds in the preening of her nape before they take
to the wing again. In no other species of white cockatoo does this
aerial display form such an important part of courtship.
In selecting a nesting site the pair will inspect many hollow limbs
and holes in tree trunks before the hen is satisfied. Usually the nesting
site will be a hole in the trunk or main branch of a dead or living gum
tree in close proximity to water. The birds will immediately commence
to strip the bark from around the entrance thus exposing the smooth
wood. This habit is peculiar to this species and there have been many
theories put forward to explain this unusual behaviour, but none has
been satisfactory. It has been suggested that the birds strip the bark
from living trees to prevent " goannas " (Varanus varius) gaining access
to the nest, but this does not seem to be the case as these reptiles can
climb as easily over the smooth wood as they can over green bark.
It has also been suggested that it is done to prevent the hollow entrance
closing, but as most nests are in comparatively large hollows there
rarely exists this danger. This habit of the Galah is one of those
mysteries of ornithology that have not been solved.
With the exception of the Major Mitchell Cockatoo, the Galah is the
only member of the white cockatoos that lines its nest. The bottom of
the hollow is lined with a plentiful supply of gum leaves on which the
eggs are laid. Occasionally more leaves are added after the eggs are
laid and such a quantity of leaves is built up that the eggs are almost
completely covered. C. leadbeateri does not use gum leaves but lines
its nest with strips of bark.
The number of eggs varies from two to five and are laid over a period
of up to a fortnight, Each egg is white and oval in shape with a fine
slightly glossy surface. Eggs from a nest at Dry Plains, N.S.W.
examined by the author on 13th October, 1962, gave the average
measurements of 1 * 375 in. by 1 * o in. Incubation, which lasts approxi-
mately five weeks, usually commences after the laying of the first egg

thus giving rise to disparity in ages of nestlings generally observed in
the nests. Both sexes share the incubation, but the most work in this
sphere is done by the female.
As expected, the breeding season varies greatly throughout the
extensive range of this species. In the eastern and western areas it is
from August to December while the central regions have the season
from late June to November. In northern Australia, where the wet
season is the deciding factor, the birds breed from May to August.
In the central regions dry periods cause the birds to forego breeding
altogether or to lay clutches well below normal in number, but in
these same areas good seasons bring about an increase in clutches or in
the number of broods.
Newly-hatched Galahs are naked and are nearly all head and bill.
White down appears after a few days followed by the slow acquisition
of pin feathers. Development is slow and the nestling period usually
lasts from five to six weeks. Both parents share the duty of feeding the
nestlings. The parents visit the nest together at approximately three-
hourly intervals while the nestlings are young, the visits becoming less
frequent as the birds progress and develop. While being fed the young
emit a constant rasping, wheezy, call interspersed with a vibrating
interrupted grating cry. When feeding her offspring the adult bird locks
her bill with that of the young bird and, with a violent up and down
jerking movement, passes regurgitated food to the youngster. It is this
movement that is accompanied by the vibrating cry.
After leaving the nest the young birds are fed and preened by their
parents in the roosting trees for the first couple of weeks. An integral
part of the inland scene around December is the noise of young Galahs
in the trees as they are fed by their parents. These young birds are
readily distinguished from the adults by the grey markings on the
underparts and crest, giving them a somewhat smeared appearance.
Also their bills are usually yellowish in colour.
Although it frequently associates with the Little Corella (Cacatua or
Ducorpsius sanguined) along inland watercourses and creeks, the Galah
does not often hybridize. There are scattered reports of hybrids between
these two species and with the Major Mitchell Cockatoo occurring in
the wild state. A most interesting record of a combination clutch
comes from Minginew on the Irwin River, W.A., in 1927. Three young
cockatoos at pin-feather stage taken from a nest proved to be two
Major Mitchell Cockatoos and one Galah. Apparently the Galahs
deserted the nest after laying one egg and the Major Mitchells took
over and hatched the Galah's egg with their own.
A mutation in which the grey of the upper parts is replaced by white
has been the subject of a number of observations both in the wild state
and in captivity. The author observed one of these birds in captivity in
Adelaide in 1962 and was greatly impressed with its beauty. The bird

which had all the underparts normally coloured and the upper surface
and tail pure white, had been trapped in the north of South Australia.
There are also records of mutations in which the pink is replaced by
white while the grey is retained.
Although an extremely popular cage bird in this country, the Galah,
because of its abundance, is rarely kept in an aviary with a view to
breeding. When hand-reared from nestling stage it makes a most
affectionate pet and, in spite of many statements to the contrary, will
often become quite proficient as a 44 talker ". Its voice, although often
quite irritating, is not as disagreeable as that of the Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo and this is a big factor in its favour. Because of its quieter
disposition E. roseicapilla is in demand overseas as an aviary bird. It has
been bred in captivity on a number of occasions and once acclimatized
is very hardy. However, aviary-bred birds are delicate and very sus-
ceptible to chills for the first six months and reasonable care should be
excercised. If breeding in captivity large hollow logs or nest-boxes
should prove suitable. There is a record of aviary birds stripping slivers
of wood from perches to make a nest at the bottom of the box, but
usually they will be satisfied with decayed wood on which to deposit
the eggs.
The diet of captive birds should consist of oats, wheat, sunflower
seeds, and cracked corn in equal parts with a little millet and plain
canary seed for variety. Milk thistle, chickweed, lettuce and silverbeet
will provide the essential greenfood, while fruit will be readily taken.
One of the most abundant of all Australian birds, the Galah provides
colour and beauty to the vast inland areas of Australia. Whether turning
and tumbling in flight thus displaying the plumage to perfection, or
spending their idle hours stripping gum tips as they roost by outback
watercourses, these handsome birds never fail to fascinate the observer.
Such is the charm of yet another of Australia's wonderful psittacine
birds.

As these notes are written in the first week of May, it is far too early
to give much news of breeding. It can be reported, however, that both
the Great and Spotted Eagle-Owls again have well-grown young
ones--four in the case of the former and three in the case of the latter.
Two of last year's young Spotted Eagle-Owls have laid, but as both
birds are incubating, they must be two hens. There are a number of
other possibilities but they will have to wait for a later number of the
Magazine.
A number of interesting new arrivals are now on view, including
several new to the collection. The penguins have been increased by
four Humboldt's Penguins and four King Penguins. The latter were
somewhat reluctant to feed on first arrival and two had to be forcibly
persuaded. They now seem to have settled down well. It is interesting
to note that in captivity King Penguins never learn to pick up their
fish, either on land or in the water. They always take them from their
keeper's hand. The smaller species, although they may have to be
hand-fed when first captured, very soon learn to pick fish up off the
ground or out of the water.
Our three American White Pelicans have been joined by two Brown
Pelicans, two Rosy-breasted Pelicans, and a Crested Pelican, and the
eight make up quite an impressive flock. They share the penguin
enclosure, which now has a very well-filled look.

J. J. YEALLAND-LONDON ZOO NOTES
Of birds of prey, two immature vultures sent to us as White-backed
are almost certainly White-headed. Very tame birds, they have
evidently been hand-reared from the nest. They have settled in with
the rest of the birds of prey with no trouble. It is somewhat surprising
that quite large numbers of the raptors can be kept together with very
little fighting, provided that really roomy quarters are available.
Presumably it is because of mutual respect.
The arrival of Demoiselle Cranes has increased the number of
species of these attractive and spectacular birds at Chester to four. In
the large enclosures in which they are housed they can be seen at their
best. They are something of a worry in a high wind, as most are wing-
clipped and not permanently pinioned. In addition to the Demoiselles
we have received a very nice young pair of Sarus Cranes.

A Second Australian Collection
In 1954 Sir Edward Hallstrom was instrumental in collecting
together and sending a large collection of Australian mammals, birds,
and reptiles ( Avicult . Mag., 1954, lx, p. 90). These were shown in
Regent's Park as a special exhibit and, of course, many of them are
still living.

In May of this year another of these characteristically generous gifts
was sent to mark the occasion of the recent Royal visit. This time the
collection travelled by air under the care of Mr. F. Hargreaves and
the specimens are being exhibited at Whipsnade Park until the
autumn.
The birds came from Sir Edward's private collection, from Taronga
Park, and from the Adelaide Zoo, many of them having been bred at
these places.
The collection of birds comprises eighty-seven specimens of the
following species : Bennett's Cassowary, Black Swan, Cereopsis Goose,

The Bennett's Cassowary is, I believe, of the race inhabiting the
Nondugl area in the highlands of eastern New Guinea, one being
caught as a chick and the other being bred in Taronga Park in 1959.
The Cloncurry Parrakeet ( Platycercus zonarius macgillivrayi ) has never
before been in the collection. It was previously imported in 1939 by
the late Duke of Bedford who published a note on it in the Magazine
that year, calling it the Cloncurry Barnard. In the same volume
Dr. Alan Lendon also wrote on it and there appeared an excellent
coloured plate by Goodchild which was originally published in
The Ibis in 1902, two years after North had first described the bird.
The Blue-cheeked Parakeet is, of course, the northern race of
Platycercus adscitus.

Walther Langberg, Copenhagen, writes at the end of May : "At
present the Princess of Wales have five youngsters in the nest-box,
and three pairs of Crimson-winged have a total of ten young ones in
the boxes. Splendids, Turquoisines, and Bourkes have young and more
pairs are laying at the moment, so I hope for a good number reared.
My blue Ring-necked paired to a split-blue cock laid three eggs, but
I regret to say they were all clear. The hen has, however, been in
the nest-box today and I think she will go to nest again.
A fortnight ago I put my two 1956-bred Grey Parrots in the old

Vice-President Allen Silver kindly amends my note on the Citril
Finch in the last number of the Magazine. He writes : " It is not
only possible but was a fact that Teschemaker bred this species.
I purchased the adults and their four young from him and passed
them on to the late Professor Bateson and his niece Miss Florence
Durham, then keenly interested in canary genetics. They came over
to Streatham, where I then lived, to collect the birds and have a
chat. They thought there might be some other finch in the origin of
domestic canaries but I politely disagreed. I said I thought they could
get fertile eggs from Citril Finch male and domestic canary, but that
the hybrid would be infertile should they get so far. The Professor
was a nice old boy and Director of the John Innes Horticultural
Station, then at Merton Park, near Wimbledon. I later heard nothing
as to how the birds fared, but suspect they lost them in due course as
they were not experienced bird-keepers. I am afraid if caged and
treated exactly as canaries they would sooner or later lose them."

Timor (Dwarf Sulphur-crested), one pair sitting and, most remark-
able of all, two hybrid Leadbeater's (J X Citron-crested $. These
have only just hatched (one Sunday and one today) and I believe
they are being fed. We are delightedly speculating what colour they
may be. The hen Citron-crested is one of my own breeding. She is
now five years old but I am almost certain she laid, in a mixed aviary,
when only three years of age. The Roseates, incidentally, were
double-brooded in both 1961 and 1962.
Another thing that pleased me last year was that after very many
years' perseverance one pair of Plum-headed successfully reared three
fine young which came through the winter and are now moulting into
grey heads. This year the parents have hatched again and I think
all goes well."

The Dartford Warbler Sylvia undata dartfordiensis , as its name implies,
was originally closely associated with Dartford, Kent. It was first
brought to the notice of ornithologists when a pair was killed on Bexley
Heath, not far from Dartford, on 10th April, 1773. They were sent
to John Latham who communicated the discovery to Pennant, by whom
the species was described and figured in 1776.
A very local species, its numbers have greatly decreased during
recent years, mainly due to the destruction by burning-off of the heaths
and gorse-covered commons that are its habitat. The very severe
past winter must have taken a terrible toll and the species must be in
serious danger of extinction. In captivity it is worth recalling that in
1909 the late John Frostick succeeded in hand-rearing a nest of three.
One he succeeded in keeping in perfect health for nearly nine years.
This bird--" Champion Perfection "--shown at all the leading
London shows, probably created a record for the number of " firsts "
and specials won by a single bird. Incidentally, a nest-brother was
claimed at the Crystal Palace Show for twelve guineas, at that time a
record price for a small, British insectivorous bird.
On the death of John Frostick in 1946 his son William very kindly
gave me " Champion Perfection " and it is before me as I write--
a treasured reminder of a very great bird-lover.

" During the past season I had some good and some poor results.
The Princess Alexandra Parrakeets are my favourites and although

beginning. They were delightful birds but unfortunately about ten
days ago they all got something which did not agree with them and
" went light " and I lost the three of them over the last few days.
The cock bird of the pair also was afflicted and I now have him in a
cage and am dosing him up in the hope of saving him, but he looks
pretty weak at the present time. He is in beautiful feather and I shall
be very sorry if I lose him. These were a first breeding for me as was a
young Barraband. My Spinifex Pigeons did not breed this year but I
got about ten Scarlets, about fifteen Bourkes, four Turquoisines, four
Green-winged Pigeons and sundry finches, including eleven Red-
faced Parrot Finches which also was a particularly pleasing result.
During the year I secured a pair of Swinhoe's Pheasants and, although
these birds were extremely wild when I got them, they tamed down very
well and went to nest. As I have had unfortunate experiences with hen
pheasants brooding before, I took half the eggs from her and put them
under a bantam, but the bantam died about a week before they were
due to hatch. However, the hen Swinhoe's got on with the job on the
six eggs that she had under her and brought out three young, all of
which came on well and are now almost adult."

interesting one. The young reared were : Peach-faced Lovebird,
thirty ; Nyasa Lovebird, eleven ; wild, green Budgerigar, nineteen ;
Pale-headed Rosella, two ; Yellow Rosella, two ; Crimson Rosella,
one ; Adelaide X Yellow Rosella, two ; Green x Yellow Rosella,

The hen Scarlet unfortunately escaped when her young were less than
ten days old and she disappeared immediately.
The young Many-coloured was also reared by Redrumps. The cock
Many-coloured was killed and the hen refused to incubate. The eggs
were shuffled around under Redrumps, Nyasa Lovebirds, and Budgeri-
gars where they finally hatched. The Budgerigars, however, killed all

reared the lot. Her one and only fertile egg and youngster was reared
by Blue-wings.
Another hen Redrump was killed, her eggs did the rounds finally
ending-up under a hen Eastern Rosella whose own eggs were addled,
and two young were reared.
The Crimson Rosellas let their young ones die as they hatched.
Only one, the last, was I able to save by giving it to a pair of Golden-
mantled Rosellas whose own eggs were infertile. The Peach-faced
Lovebirds did exceptionally well, my best pair reared seventeen in
ten months.
One pair of the wild, green Budgerigars is interesting in that they
reared three broods, five, four, and four. Yet in the wild, before they
were caught for me, this pair only had two young."

Notes from Chester Zoo. A. W. E. Fletcher writes : " Two recent
happenings at the Zoo may prove of interest. The first is an example of
the way pairs in breeding condition are aggressive to birds of similar
colour patterns. Our American Black Vultures share the large Birds
of Prey Flight with Griffon, White-backed and White-headed Vultures,
Bateleur and Fish-Eagles, Buzzards, Ravens, and a Crested Hawk-
Eagle. On coming into breeding condition, the Black Vultures
persecuted the Hawk-Eagle to such a degree that it had to be caught
up to save its life. Curiously enough they ignore the Ravens, although
the latter are the biggest obstacle to their successful breeding. Does
this mean that both species and colour must be allied in order to
provoke aggression ?
The second quite interesting occurrence concerns three immature
Silver Pheasant cocks. Having nowhere else to put them, I had one
wing clipped and put them into a two-acre enclosure with eight Black-
necked and Grey-necked Crowned Cranes, and a pair of Black Swans.
After a few days the pheasants began wildly to chase the cranes and
this finally got so bad that they had to be caught up. During this
operation I saw a pheasant swim for the first time ! The sequel is
rather interesting. I was reading the Avicult. Mag., 1907, last evening
and was intrigued by an account of a Swinhoe's X Silver Pheasant cock
attacking and seriously injuring a Crowned Crane. As the French
say : 4 The more things change, the more they remain the same ! 5 "
The event to which Mr. Fletcher refers is recounted by Mrs. Octavia
Gregory. She writes : "I have lately introduced amongst my Cranes
a handsome Swinhoe's X Silver cock Pheasant. He is quite tame and
has been accustomed to run loose in a garden. A few days ago this
bird suddenly rushed at my Crowned Crane and after chasing him up
and down the garden managed to get his spur into the Crane's hind

toe and nearly severed it off. It bled very freely so I caught up the
Crane and bathed and bandaged the foot, which bandage I may say
he never attempted to peck off but walked about quietly in it for
three days when the wound having healed he pulled it off--and the
toe is well--but the nail has come off. Since, the Pheasant has tried
to attack two male Demoiselle Cranes, but they are so quick, they got
out of his way. Afterwards, he tried to get at my Flamingo which
fortunately was standing in deep water. The Pheasant flew on to some
rocks in the pond and I quite expected to see him swimming in the
water. At last I got him into a run, where I shall keep him shut up. . . ."

A very interesting event last year in the Edinburgh Zoo was the
successful breeding of a pair of Corncrakes that had been hand-
reared and presented to the Park by our member, H. F. Gruber.
The Annual Report describes the success : " During the early part of the
summer the male bird was heard calling continuously during the
night, a strangely rural sound for a Zoological Park, and later it was
discovered that the female had formed a shallow nest and laid six eggs.
The birds were disturbed as seldom as possible, and the female finally
appeared with six chicks which, with some help from the male, she
fed and brooded solicitously. Unfortunately, the only accommoda-
tion available was one of the outside aviaries south of the Tropical
Bird House, and although this contained shrubs, and the grass was
allowed to grow for increased cover, the area was insufficient and the
birds were able to hide only by remaining at the end farthest from the
visitors' path. This sufficed for the adults that were able to run into
cover when frightened, but it proved inadequate for a mother with
young chicks, and four of them were found dead at the foot of the
netting close to the public path. It is surmised that the mother had
been feeding them when surprised by someone passing. Retiring
hurriedly to the undergrowth, she had been followed by two chicks
while four remained and, presumably, died from exposure. Given a
larger enclosure with plenty of cover, this might well have been
prevented. ..."
This event is not, however, unique. J. Lewis Bonhote, of Cambridge,
was successful in 1896. He describes the event in the Avicult. Mag., 1896,
179. Eight eggs were laid and all hatched. Five of the young ones died
during the third week but, the account says, " two of them are now
seven weeks old and fully feathered birds." (See also 1898, 51.) From
Bonhote's accounts in the Z 00 ^*S^ S ^ 1 897, 35 ; 1900, 29, it appears
that the parents were hand-reared, wild-taken birds of the previous year.
A further success is that of G. E. Rattigan, Gloucestershire. Six
young, three males and three females, were reared in 1915. He gives
a breeding account in Bird Notes , 1916, 28, 58.

(Chrysococcyx caprius)
By J. J. Yealland (London, England)
The Didric Cuckoo, so named from its call, inhabits Africa south-
ward of the Sahara, islands near the coast, and southern parts of
Arabia. It frequents a wide variety of habitat and is said to be migra-
tory in most parts of its range, being, for example, only in South Africa
from about October to March which is its breeding season in this area.
The coloured plate depicts a male ; the female differs in being a
rather duller coppery-green above, no central white streak on the head,
not such a pure white on the breast and throat and with more barring
on the under side.
The food consists largely of caterpillars, with some moths, butterflies,
and other large insects.
Mackworth-Praed and Grant describe the bird's thoroughness in its
search for caterpillars, its habit of sometimes sitting lengthwise on a
branch like a Nightjar and that " like all the metallic Cuckoos, often
feed young birds of their own species after they have left the nest of their
foster parents ".
A wide range of birds known to be parasitized by this cuckoo--twenty-
eight species, according to Bannerman--include Weavers, Sparrows,
Flycatchers, Cisticolas, Sunbirds, and Wagtails. The egg is evidently
sometimes deposited in the nest by the mouth, Levaillant having shot
two females in the act of doing this. Generally only one egg is deposited
in a nest, but two have sometimes been found. The eggs are variable
in colour, some being white, greenish-white or pale-blue, with or
without variously coloured spots or blotches. The nestling cuckoo
evidently ejects its foster brethren.
So far as is known, this, like others of the genus, has rarely been kept
in captivity and with scant success. Some years ago Mr. R. C. J.
Sawyer had a specimen, but found it a difficult subject and evidently
unsuited to captivity both by reason of diet and of temperament.

(Eupsittula jendaya)
By Jorge O'Neill (Lisbon, Portugal)
To begin with I will point out that I call " half-liberty birds " the
maintenance of birds in relatively small aviaries (8 to i o feet length)
with the possibility of flying in freedom every day, but returning at
night to their aviary.
Eight years ago--in 1955--I bought a pair of Jendayas because of
their gaudy colours. Although I knew they were very noisy, I was
not prepared for their terrific cries. I put them in an aviary I have in
my garden mounted under a stone stairway. This aviary is 4 or 5 feet
in length by 8 feet high, dimensions not, of course, very suitable for
breeding purposes.
Due to their terrific din I decided to try them flying at liberty
according to the ideas expounded in the late Duke of Bedford's book.
For this purpose I made a trap-door on the front side of the aviary
and I placed a funnel with suitable dimensions, beside this trap-door.
First I caught one of the birds and, leaving the other inside the
aviary, I set it free in my garden. I was immediately pleased with the
results not only because these birds have a marvellous flight, but also
because the flying bird's strong cry brought an immediate response
from the one inside the aviary and I saw there wasn't any danger of
losing the free bird.
I must say that these birds are very clever, and on the first day, the
bird set at liberty learnt to get inside through the net funnel simply with
the help of some sunflower seeds put in the middle of this funnel. For
two or three days I set the same bird at liberty and on the second or
third day it began to use the entrance quite normally. Then I did the
same with its companion. A week after my experiment the two birds
were both flying at liberty and they returned regularly to the aviary
to feed and at nightfall.
At the end of several months--in September, 1956--(during which
only once or twice they did not return for the night) the shooting season
of the Turtle-Doves opened (1st September) and after a few days being
in my garden, I heard a shot in the late afternoon and seconds later
one of my Jendayas came flying hurriedly into the aviary and I never
saw the other bird again.
It was clear that a very unscrupulous " sportsman " had killed it,
to increase his bag with an exotic victim which certainly he had never
seen before. I was of course very annoyed with this but quite by chance
a bird shop in Lisbon had half a dozen Jendayas for sale and being
convinced that the survivor was a cock, I tried to buy a new bird with

a thinner head hoping that it might be a hen. And a hen it was. This
bird learnt with the same ease to get in and out of the aviary.
During the next year--1957--when the winter arrived I decided
to put a log in their small aviary but more with the idea of a place
for them to roost in than for breeding purposes. This log was simply
part of an orange tree with a natural hole and 10 inches in diameter.
I was surprised to see the hen entering it and staying a long time
inside. When the gardener opened the trap-door every morning the two
birds came out immediately, but the hen only took a brief flight round
the garden and came back to the nest. After about three weeks the
hen began to come out more frequently and approximately one month
after this, two chicks appeared in perfect plumage. When these birds
come out of the nest they are a little smaller than their parents. The
breast and neck which in the parents is orange-yellow is more lemon-
yellow and sprinkled with green. Within two months these birds were
also flying at liberty.
The following year--1958--the old pair again raised four chicks.
I gave two of these birds to a friend and remained with six in the aviary.
In 1959 four chicks were born. Two of these were lost, I think because
I set them at liberty too soon. Two others died. They were found
clutching the net tightly and badly injured. Again six birds in the
! aviary. In the summer another " sportsman 5 5 killed one of the parents
as I forgot to lock them in due time. But there was a new breeding
the following season--1960--between the parent that survived and
one of its children and one chick was born.
In 1961--three chicks were again born and something happened
which convinced me that the former birds were killed by their parents
or brothers. One of the birds from last year's breeding was savagely
attacked by two or three of its companions. The gardener saw the
accident in time and seized the badly injured bird which had fallen
on the ground. I put it in a small cage and some days later, I set it at
liberty. It went to its parents' aviary and was again attacked. It was
saved again and after having it a whole month in a cage I set it free
once more. On this occasion the bird flew for a while in the garden but
did not return to the cage and disappeared, probably in search of better
company. From this incident I concluded that perhaps because the
aviary is not big enough, or for some other reason, these birds sometimes
attack one another fiercely. The birds previously found dead were
probably not killed by rats as I then suspected, but simply killed by
some members of their family. That is really probable as the birds
were found with deep wounds, but not gnawed. Now I do not keep
more than six birds in my aviary.
It seems to me that this experiment with the Jendayas has some
interest. My property is composed of a garden 30 yards by 60 yards
and an orange grove of approximately 30 acres. This part of the
imtiismiai

property is relatively narrow with an average width of 500 yards. I am
convinced that in the country anybody possessing an aviary of small
dimensions and a garden with not more than one acre can have these
birds flying at liberty and breeding in an aviary. They are easy to
teach and although their cries are very disagreeable in the aviary, they
are almost gay when the birds are flying, and the noise makes them easy
to locate. They are wonderful on the wing, sometimes a little
reminiscent of Snipe. Their colouring is : head, yellow; breast, orange ;
mantle, green; wings and tail, green with blue tips.
The end of this story is not a very happy one however. Last year--*
1962--I decided to keep only four birds and gave the rest away ; one
died in the nest, one accidentally, and a third one did not come back,
presumably again killed by some " sportsman 55 . At present I have
only one bird flying about in my garden.
As to other birds, I only keep parrot-like birds.
At present for breeding purposes, I have :--
Three pairs of lutino Ring-necks
Four pairs of Pennant's
Four pairs Red-collared Lorikeets, living in a colony
Eight pairs blue pied Budgerigars.
This season I was successful with the lutinos, seven chicks from two
pairs (the third pair is one year old and did not breed), and with the
Lorikeets : two pairs. These birds are very regular breeders.
Two pairs of Pennant's are in the nest, I know not with what
results. For various reasons I am not very confident with them for
success this year. I had a good breeding season with my Pennant's
last year : six chicks.

Introduction
The babblers have long presented taxonomic difficulties, not only
as regards their internal composition but also the systematic position
of the group itself among the other passerines.
For many years the babblers have been treated as a " rag-bag 5 5
family. A large measure of order was given it, however, by Delacour
(1946, 1950) but, though the core of typical babblers is now well
known, it still remains doubtful if the group as presently constituted is
a wholly monophyletic one. There has been a wide divergence of
opinion, also, as to the status and relationships of the babblers. Some
authorities, such as Amadon (1957), van Tyne and Berger (1959),
Storer (i960), and Wetmore (i960), still give them full family rank,
the Timaliidae, but the prevailing trend is to place them as a sub-
family, the Timaliinae, within the great thrush-warbler-flycatcher
assemblage, the Muscicapidae sens lat. (Mayr, 1946, Mayr and Amadon
1951, Mary and Greenway, 1956, and Delacour and Vaurie, 1957).
Few taxonomists indicate that the relationship of the babblers may lie
elsewhere, though the order of both Wetmore (i960) and of van Tyne
and Berger (1959), for example, could imply a closer affinity with that
looser assemblage of families centred about the crows (Corvidae),
notably the bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchidae), birds of paradise (Para-
disaeidae), tits (Paridae), nuthatches (Sittidae), and creepers
(Certhiidae).
To a greater or lesser extent, all these problems are still greatly debat-
able and much reliance has been placed on purely morphological
evidence. During the course of recent studies on head-scratching
(Simmons, 19570, 19610) and on anting (Simmons, 1957 b, 1959,
19616), I was able to make some observations on the general behaviour
of babblers and of other passerines in captivity, mainly in the London
Zoo. In addition, I have kept Pekin Robins (Leiothrix lutea ) for a number
of years and recently had a pair of Rufous-chinned Jay-Thrushes
(Garrulax rofogularis) for a year (Simmons, 1962, Harrison, 1962). The
notes thus gathered, plus some further information from the literature,
indicate that the babblers have several characteristic traits of
behaviour which should be considered in any future assessment of
their taxonomic composition and relationships. This paper presents
an informal and preliminary treatment of these problems.

184 K. E. L. SIMMONS-SOME BEHAVIOUR CHARACTERS OF THE BABBLERS
The Characters
Writing in the Avicultural Magazine, Delacour (1925) described
the babblers as insectivorous and frugivorous birds, inhabiting Africa
and Asia, related to the thrushes and warblers and distinguished by
their short and rounded wings and tendency towards a longer tail and
stouter legs. He mentioned their rapid movements and their manner
of progressing on the ground by large hops.
Diet, manner of gait and flight, nesting habits, voice, and display
are outside the scope of the present paper, though probably all worth
examining in detail in any full review of the Timaliidae. Indeed, as
regards display, little seems to have been recorded and I have only
once seen any elaborate display in a babbler, the Pekin Robin ; this
was of such unique form for a passerine (see review by Andrew, 1961)
that I give a description of it in an appendix.
My own interest in the babblers was taken chiefly by unusual
features of their routine behaviour, including " feather maintenance "
(Simmons, in press) and, while most or all of the behaviour characters
to be discussed are to be found in other groups, their peculiar combina-
tion within the Timaliidae is probably unique and of taxonomic value.
The main items to be treated will be considered under the following
heads : (1) use of the foot in feeding ; (2) manner of scratching the
head and bill ; (3) mutual preening and other social behaviour ;

(4) manner of bathing ; (5) manner of oiling the head and wings, and
(6) prevalence and methods of anting. Of these, the first four are

clear-cut, the last two less so and included only after much
deliberation.
Use of the Foot in Feeding
The fossil evidence of avian evolution has firmly established that
birds are descended from reptilian stock, having the same ancestors as
the ill-fated dinosaurs. One should keep this origin in mind when
considering the usually very limited ways in which birds use their
feet, for we tend to overlook that these are the equivalent of the hind-
limbs of reptiles, that is, mainly organs of locomotion and scratching.
With the evolution of wings for flying, birds were left, as it were,
without conventional, prehensile front limbs and very few species
to-day employ their wings for even simple front-leg tasks.
In most passerine groups, the use of the feet is very restricted, being
chiefly concerned with perching, locomotion, and head-scratching.
Backward-scratching with both legs alternately is, however, wide-
spread, though mainly confined to nest-shaping, House Sparrows
(.Passer domesticus ) also using this co-ordination when forming hollows
for dust-bathing (Simmons, 1954). A few species show forms of
backward-scratching in their food-seeking, for example the Dunnock

(.Prunella modularis : Prunellidae), Blackbird ( Turdus merula : Turdi-
dae), the scrub-birds (Altrichornithidae) and whydahs (Viduinae).
The most specialized use of the feet, however, is connected with the
holding of objects, most often food. Surprisingly few passerine groups
have advanced this far and most instances are to be found in the
non-passerines. The simplest pattern in this category is the employment
of one or both feet merely to hold down and steady objects, so that the
bird can bend down and deal with them with the bill. Within the
passerines, the crows, tits, and the shrikes (Laniidae) are well known
for using the feet in this manner and I have seen a Magnificent
Bird of Paradise ( Diphyllodes magnificus ) hold an ant to its perch for
re-adjustment during anting. The behaviour is unknown in the
thrushes and their allies but is present in the babblers, though this
seems not to be generally known outside avicultural circles.
I have seen babblers of the genera Leiothrix , Siva , Heterophasia , and
Garrulax use the foot in feeding. Two main, inter-related, methods occur
within the same species. The food may be held against a perch with
the front three toes, while the hind toe grips the perch directly
(clamping) or, usually on the ground, the bird may extend the tarsus
and hold the food with all four toes, while its weight is taken by the
other leg (grasping). The babblers are, perhaps, generally not so
adroit at holding food in the feet as are, for example, the crows and
the tits which, as well as employing the two methods just described,
also clamp food to the perch with both feet and can with ease rotate
and move objects along under the feet for better treatment. The
Long-tailed Tit ( Aegithalos caudatus) is known to eat prey while hanging
upside down with one foot and grasping the prey with the other.
However, the highest level of development has been reached by the
drongos which, perhaps alone among the passerines, have achieved
full emancipation of the hind limbs and are able to use them for
grasping and holding food up to the bill as if they were hands. I have
seen a Large Racket-tailed Drongo ( Dissemurus paradiseus) grasp a
cockroach in one foot and hold it up to its bill for eating.
Manner of Scratching the Head and Bill
The head parts are scratched with the claws of one foot while the
bird supports itself on the other leg. There are two main ways in
which birds move the foot up to the head for scratching. When
scratching " indirectly ", the bird first makes the positive movement of
slightly lowering one wing and then lifts the corresponding leg over the
shoulder to the head, the co-ordination being a characteristic two-phase
one. When scratching " directly ", the bird lifts the foot straight up
without any special wing movement. In the great majority of cases,
one method of head-scratching is a diagnostic feature of the species
and its family.

1 86 K. E. L. SIMMONS-SOME BEHAVIOUR CHARACTERS OF THE BABBLERS
It has long been known that the indirect method of head-scratching
is characteristic of the passerines (see, for example, Finn, 1919) but
not until comparatively recently that a minority of members of this
order scratch directly. The record is still far from complete, and some
cases are puzzling, yet it is clear that direct-scratching is widespread
among the babblers whereas, as far as is known, all other groups with
which they have been associated, including the thrush assemblage,
regularly scratch indirectly in the typical passerine manner.
Of the birds listed as babblers by Delacour, the following genera are
known to scratch directly (most records from Simmons, 1957a, 1961 a) :
Pomatorhinus , Chamaea , Turdoides, Babax, Garrulax, Leiothrix , Siva, and
Heterophasia. The following, however, were found to scratch indirectly :
Paradoxornis, Tuhina , and Picathartes. These and other instances are
discussed in Simmons (1961a) while further papers on head-scratching
include those of Ficken and Ficken (1958), Nice and Schantz (1959),
Wickler (1961), and Brereton and Immelmann (1962). The latest
general review on the subject is that of Nice (1962) and the position
in the American warblers (Parulidae), the only other passerine group
in which direct head-scratching seems to be fairly widespread, is
summarized by Ficken and Ficken (1962).
Mutual Preening and other Social Behaviour
Most babblers are highly social birds. This sociability manifests
itself in many ways. Not only do they often gather in parties and
flocks, some species even co-operating in nesting activities and
communal defence (Kendeigh, 1952) but, above all, they are " contact 55
birds. The majority of other passerines, even otherwise gregarious
ones, are " distance " birds, that is each individual maintains a free
space around itself and, except at special times (such as when mating
or fighting), avoids bodily contact with its fellows, either by passively
moving away from them or by showing mild aggression. Such a social
convention is characteristic of the thrushes and their allies. The
babblers, however, have no such inhibitions but, like a few other groups
(notably the Estrilidae), freely clump together when perched during
the day and roosting during the night. The Pekin Robin, the babbler
most often kept in captivity, provides a good example. Paired birds
sit side by side, often so tightly pressed together that they look like a
single bird with two heads and two tails. The bodies, with feathers
ruffled, form a single, fluffy ball, especially when the birds tuck their
heads away to sleep. So strong is this tendency to clump in the
babblers that, in captivity, birds of the same sex freely associate in this
way while, in the absence of a bird of the same species, individuals
will try to clump with other babblers or even with quite unrelated
species, passerine and non-passerine.
Another social habit of the babblers, usually connected with

K. E. L. SIMMONS-SOME BEHAVIOUR CHARACTERS OF THE BABBLERS 1 87
clumping, is mutual preening. This behaviour is otherwise rather
rare in the passerines, being quite absent, apparently, in the thrush
assemblage. The best-known protagonists, apart from the babblers,
are the estrildine finches. I have seen mutual preening in several
babbler species and, especially in my own captive Pekin Robins and
Rufous-chinned Jay-thrushes which would clump for minutes on end,
first one and then the other of the pair taking its turn to preen the
other's head-parts. The chin and throat received special attention, the
bird being preened remaining stock still, often with bill elevated
vertically. Frequently, I noted that one bird would preen the other
hurriedly for a few seconds, as if to encourage it, and then hold its own
head in position, inviting attention in return.
As noted, the head-parts are the ones usually treated, and this seems
to be the general rule among birds that mutually preen. In the London
Zoo, however, I saw what might be best termed " vent preening "
from a pair of Masked Jay-Thrushes ( Garrulax perspicillatus) . The
two birds were in a small tree in their flight and one hopped near to,
and slightly above the other, facing away from it and formally inviting
it to preen its ventral area in a special posture. It remained quite
motionless, body horizontal, tail somewhat cocked, the neck stretched,
and the head up. The mate hopped eagerly forward and inspected the
undersurface of the tail, pecking at the feathers and, apparently, the
skin round the cloaca and also preening the feathers for nearly two
minutes, swallowing from time to time. It then " extracted " a long
length of stiff, thin, greyish material, which looked like a strip of
vermicelli. For a moment, it held the stuff in its bill, then took it to
the ground, dropped it, picked it up again and ate it. The Jay-Thrush
returned immediately to its mate and went on preening its ventral area
for a further minute or so. The other bird had kept quite still all the
while.
I have no other records so complete as this one but some do indicate
that vent-preening, or, at least, cloaca pecking, may occur in more than
one species. I have twice noted a female Pekin Robin assume a posture
that seemed to be an invitation to the male to preen her ventral area,
stretching up the head and the tail, in the manner of the Masked
Jay-thrush, and remaining motionless with the feathers round the vent
raised. In neither case, however, did the male respond. On one
occasion, I saw a White-throated Jay-Thrush (Garrulax albogularis) peck
briefly at the vent of a White-browed Jay-Thrush (G. sannio), the latter
bird remaining still while it did so. Another, different, case involved
a Guira Cuckoo ( Guira guira) which acted as a supernormal stimulus
for mutual preening for the babblers caged with it. A Common
Babbler (Turdoides caudata) followed the cuckoo around, persistently
keeping under its long tail as it moved from place to place, though no
preening of the ventral area was seen.

1 88 K. E. L. SIMMONS-SOME BEHAVIOUR CHARACTERS OF THE BABBLERS
A further manifestation of babbler sociability is found in what has
been termed " collective de-ticking ", a little-understood phenomenon
recorded, for example, in the Large Grey Babbler (Turdoides malcolmi)
and in the Jungle Babbler (T. somervillei). I can do no better than
quote from Hutson (1956) :--
The habit has been called a " de-ticking huddle " and it is
possible that it is connected with the care of the plumage. In the
case of the Large Grey Babbler you may come upon a band of these
birds on the ground, on a sandy track perhaps, or in short grass. The
birds are hunched together, jostling one another as they hop along.
Some look as though they are indulging in mock fights. Others
stand on the recumbent birds and peck at them, or appear to do so.
Often the " huddle " takes place in a tree. A band feeding on the
grass below will suddenly start flying up and collecting on a branch
in one or two closely packed bunches, six to eight birds in each, some
individuals on top of the others. As the birds reach the tree they
join the " huddle " till all that can be seen is a feathery heap
with tails sticking up in all directions. A " huddle " breaks up as
abruptly as it is formed and the birds fly off with much clamour.
Sometimes only a few of the birds in a band take part--at others
the whole band is employed. The bird at the bottom of the pile
lies there voluntarily and submits to the attentions of its companions
without protest.
Finally, brief mention may be made of the " courtship feeding "
between paired birds. I have seen this in at least one species of babbler,
the White-throated Jay-Thrush, and it may occur widely in the Tima-
liidae.

Manner of Bathing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.935780866666667" page_id="56350282"  page_num="188" year="" vol="">
There are five main types of true bathing in passerine birds :
(1) bathing while standing in shallow water ; (2) bathing by hopping
in and out of the water ; (3) bathing from the air, usually in deep
water, in a series of dips and rises ; (4) bathing in the rain, and
(5) bathing in wet vegetation (rain or dew soaked).
Of these methods, the first is by far the most common and usually
takes the following form. The bird stands throughout in the water,
though it may change its position from time to time. It alternates
rapidly between two sets of activities. First, it lowers the front of
the body, with legs bent and tail more or less clear of the water. With
the head and the front of the breast dipped into the water, it shakes
its bill vigorously from side to side while both wings are flicked up and
down. Then it raises the head and fore part of the body and lowers the
rear part, so that it stands more or less upright with the tail in the water,
and flicks the wings very rapidly in and out of the water and over the

back transversely ("wing scissoring"). As the wings often move
asymmetrically, a spurt of water is sent now over one side and now over
the other.
The majority of passerines, including the thrushes and their allies,
bathe in this " stand in " way. The babblers, on the other hand, use
the second method listed above. They are " in and out " bathers,
jumping repeatedly in and then out of the water during a single session.
While briefly in the water, they dip and shake the head, whirring the
wings rapidly, all the body feathers ruffled to the extreme. As they
hop away, they continue to shake the wings and then return for
another dip. I have watched this form of bathing many times over the
years from my Pekin Robins and then later from the Rufous-chinned
Jay-Thrushes and a number of other babbler species at the London
Zoo, including several more jay-thrushes. I have never certainly seen
any passerines of other families bathe in this way, though it would
seem that wrens (Troglodytidae) do so (Armstrong, 1955).
In some ways, this " in and out " style of bathing resembles the
" from the air " plunging and rising of such aerial birds as the martins
and swallows (Hirundidae) and may be an adaptation for using
relatively deep or running water. I noted that my captive babblers
preferred the deeper of their two bathing dishes. It has also been
suggested that " in and out " bathing may be an anti-predator
measure, whereby the bird both wets itself and shakes surplus water
out of the plumage more or less at the same time, thus reducing its
vulnerability to enemies at any given moment.
Although many birds will ruffle the plumage and perform what are
really drying movements of the wings in the rain, the only passerines
that I know of that bathe only in the rain are the larks (Alaudidae).
They do so by lying down with wings and tail spread. On the other
hand " foliage bathing ", as a subsidiary to one of the other types of
bathing, is probably quite widespread and certainly occurs in the
babblers for I saw it fairly often in my captive birds.
Manner of Oiling the Head and Wings
The majority of birds oil their plumage after bathing. They first
stimulate the flow of preen-oil from the uropygial-gland with the bill,
twisting the tail to one side, and then transfer the oil to the feathers.
The passerines have developed special movements for getting oil on the
more inaccessible feather areas, namely the head and the wing tips.
Most species, including the thrushes, oil the head with the foot. After
taking oil with the bill, they then scratch the oily bill with the foot,
transferring some oil, and immediately after quickly scratch all over
the head with the now oily foot. The underside of the wing is oiled by
both the bill and the head together, with rapid rubbing and quivering
movements. The birds stand upright and extend the wing, with the

humerus and upper arm raised, carpus high, elbow swung forwards,
and the hand partly extended to sweep the primaries forward, some-
what fan-like, with their inner surfaces roughly parallel with the side
of the body.
Once again the babblers use somewhat different movements, the
oiling co-ordination reaching a peak in this group. Most of my
observations have been on jay-thrushes and the Pekin Robin. In the
first place, babblers seem rarely to oil the head by scratching but, usually,
just scratch the bill merely to distribute the oil on it. They then simul-
taneously rub the bill and the head on the extended wing and the wing
against the head, all at great speed, alternating from wing to wing
and, at full intensity, spreading the tail and thrusting it sideways to
steady the wing by pressing against it. I have seen somewhat similar
head and bill oiling in the Blue Tit ( Pams caeruleus), a species which,
however, also oils the head by scratching.
Prevalence and Methods of Anting
Anting behaviour is widespread among the passerines having now
been recorded from 207 species of nearly forty groups (Simmons, 1961&amp;,
1963). This strange habit involves the application to the bird's
plumage of the defence fluids of ants, chiefly the formic-acid of workers
of the sub-family Formicinae. This annointing is effected either
directly, the bird applying ants with the bill (" active anting"), or
indirectly, the bird allowing the ants to swarm on to its feathers
(" passive anting "). This last form of anting is mainly confined to the
larger thrushes and crows, though also found in the tiny estrildine
finches. The majority of species ant directly, using movements and
postures very similar and undoubtedly homologous to those used in
wing-oiling (Simmons, 1959). As in full oiling, one wing and the tail
are postured simultaneously, the inaccessible wing-tips and, indirectly,
the head being the main areas annointed.
Anting is very prevalent in the babblers. Twenty-six species have
now been recorded as anting (see lists in Whitaker, 1957 and Simmons,
1961&amp;, 1963), of the following (Delacour) genera : Pomatorhinus
(2 species), Paradoxornis (1), Turdoides (3), Bahax (1), Garrulax (13),
Leiothrix (2), Siva (1), Tuhina (2), and Heterophasia (1). The great
majority of these records are of captive birds and, in testing passerines
of many groups for anting, I have found the babblers, together with
the starlings (Sturnidae), crows, weavers, and icterids to be among
the most ready of all passerines to ant if given the opportunity. The
thrush assemblage, on the other hand, with the partial exception of the
large thrushes (genus Turdus and allies), seem to ant far less readily.
The babblers show two main types of active anting. The large jay-
thrushes and allies seem to be specialized for anting on the ground
among thronging trails of ants. The bird seizes an ant and rapidly

applies it just once to the extreme ventral tip of one wing, contorting
the tail markedly. The ant is then rejected and ant after ant taken in
quick succession without the bird moving its position if possible. The
smaller babblers, best typified by the Pekin Robin, seem to be special-
ized for anting above the ground, either with ants taken from the
ground or from the foliage, though they will often ant on the ground
too, at least in captivity. They use each ant several times in a lightning
series of applications, again to the ventral tip of one wing at a time,
the tail thrusting sideways repeatedly. Because of their short wings
and conspicuously postured tail, babblers have often been reported to
be rubbing ants (and even bugs and wasps) on the tail or ventral area,
but this is an optical illusion. No babbler is known to ant both passively
and actively in the manner of the Turdus thrushes, which spread-eagle
themselves amongst a swarm of ants and also apply the insects to the
wing-tips with the bill.

Much more information is needed, both for the babblers and the
other passerines, before a full assessment of the characters outlined
in this paper can be made.
The systematic position of the babblers remains to be fully established
but the evidence from behaviour does not suggest a particularly close
affinity with the thrush assemblage. As regards the internal composi-
tion of the Tiamaliidae, on present evidence it seems that a passerine
bird (preferably one with loose, fluffy plumage, strong legs, and short
wings) may well be a babbler if it moves on the ground by hopping ;
is social at least to the extent of permitting and seeking close bodily
contact with its fellows and of indulging in mutual preening ; uses the
foot to hold down food and scratches its head directly ; bathes by
hopping in and out of the water repeatedly and by brushing up against
wet vegetation, and oils its head and wings and ants readily by using
highly characteristic co-ordinations. Difficulties are posed, however,
by birds which lack one or two of these characters while showing the
rest. For example, the Stripe-throated Yuhina (Tuhina gularis )
scratches indirectly though otherwise seeming to be a " good 55
babbler. For the time being such cases must be left undecided.
On the other hand, the Wren-tit (Chamaea fasciata) of the New
World provides an excellent test example of the value of the characters
mentioned. This bird has been variously classified and is still officially
given family status of its own (Chamaeidae) in the latest (1957) A.O.U.
check-list, though most authorities treat it as a babbler. The grounds
for disputing its identity as a babbler are chiefly zoogeographical for,
otherwise, the group seems to be unrepresented in the Americas. Yet
the behaviour evidence for the Wren-tit's being classed as a babbler
is overwhelming.

Erickson (1938) studied the Wren-tit in California and, although
she herself believed that her work had " no bearing on the systematic
problem of the monotypic family Chamaeidae ", her paper contains
much important data. This includes information on (1) the use of the
foot in feeding (pp. 305-6) ; (2) clumping (p. 307) ; (3) mutual
preening, including treatment of the ventral feathers (p. 308), and
(4) " in and out " and " foliage " bathing (pp. 308-9). In addition.
Brown (1959) found that the Wren-tit scratches the head directly.
The next stage in the study of the relationships of the babblers and
other passerine groups is the painstaking, systematic collection of facts
on the behaviour characters of as many species as possible, with perhaps
the inclusion of further activities, such as the manner of wiping the
bill. Once again, the aviculturist is in a unique position to make
valuable observations.
Appendix
Display in the Pekin Robin
On 12th August, 1957, I saw the only elaborate display that I was
to record during the seven years that I kept Pekin Robins in captivity.
This ocurred during a heavy thunderstorm. From the appearance of |
the male Pekin Robin, it is an easy guess that his display might involve
the bright yellow and chestnut throat and breast, the yellow, orange,
crimson, and black pattern of the wing and, perhaps, the forked tail*
Nevertheless, I was totally unprepared for the form that the display
actually took. My current pair of Pekin Robins were clumping in a
small, dead fir tree. The male " danced " rapidly round and round
the female swaying his head, which was pointed up, and the front of his
body from side to side, showing off the throat and breast colours. He ;
did not ruffle his feathers to enhance these, indeed his head feathers
were sleeked, indicating a measure of fear. As he dodged about thus,
he displayed the pattern of both wings at the same time in a striking
lateral posture, leaning towards the female, lowering the near wing
and raising and inverting the far wing, still largely folded, so that it
showed over his back, in the manner of certain gamebirds. This
posture varied from moment to moment as the male endeavoured to
keep in front of the female in a lateral position. She in turn either
seemed to ignore him, or hopped away or even pecked at him. When
on the ground, the male apparently tried to mount the female but, as
she avoided him, a kind of " leap frog " resulted. Of course the male
may have been attacking the female for I was not able to establish
whether his activities were courtship or hostile ones.

(&apos;Continued from page 148)
The north-eastern part of Australia possesses the best tropical rain
forests of the continent, and its coast also has the advantage of being
bordered by the Great Barrier Reef. It is therefore a very attractive
country, some of it reminiscent of New Guinea in its flora and fauna,
which naturalists should visit. Curiously enough, dry coastal districts
alternate with humid ones, and there are inland temperate plateaus
as well as hot arid stretches, so that very different birds and plants
occur within short distances.
Our first stop was at Cairns (i7*L.N.), a nice tropical seaside
town, far back from the coral reef, with humid forested hills in the
background and on the sides. We at once went to Green Island, a
small atoll which has become a popular tourist centre. The coral beds
and their wonderful animal life : fishes, giant clams, etc. are, of course,
entrancing. There are interesting birds on the reef. Brown Boobies,
Silver Gulls, Crested and Caspian Terns, Reef Herons, Green-winged
Doves and White-eyes are numerous and tame among the trees which
cover the island, and there are even some Whampoo Pigeons ( Megalo -
prepia), a large and magnificent species, green, pearl grey, yellow and
wine-red, easier to hear than to see.
Even the town of Cairns has plenty of birds, some which we never or
seldom saw elsewhere. Yellow-breasted Sunbirds and several Honey-
eaters frequent gardens ; Yellow Fig-birds and Peaceful Doves live in
the streets, perching on telephone wires. Chestnut-breasted Finches are
seen in sugar-cane fields. Lorrikeets, Crows, Australian Magpies,
Butcher-birds, Cuckoo-Shrikes, Masked Plovers, and other common
species are abundant. Pelicans, Greater and Lesser Egrets come to
the mudflats at low tide with many waders.
A colony of Shiny Starlings (Glossy Calornis) provided a most
interesting show. Hundreds of these pretty birds come from New Guinea
every year to nest. They take possession of some large tree in a subur-
ban garden and build in it their purse-shaped nests, much as Village
Weavers do in Africa. They work hard, quarrel loudly, flying in and
out, making a great commotion, and consequently a nuisance of
themselves to the unfortunate inhabitants. No means of disturbance
have any effect on them ; the only way to eliminate them consists of
cutting down the tree of their choice. In such a case they just take
over the next available one. To the ornithologist however they are a

most enjoyable sight, and, fortunately a number of the local people
also enjoy them, despite their noisy habits.
The visit of the country-side around Cairns was made possible under
the most favourable circumstances by Mrs. Marion Cassels, a local
resident of English origin, whose study of the local bird life has become
more than a hobby. We visited under her guidance, and that of her
husband, several very different areas, and therefore we could watch
many species in the various habitats.
The rain forests of the slopes and ridges around Cairns are typical :
palms, epiphytes, ferns, vines and medium-sized trees, resembling
much those of New Guinea. So does the avifauna. One hears every-
where the weird calls of Whampoo Pigeons and Fruit Doves, Mega-
podes, Log-runners, Spotted Cat-birds and Victoria's Rifle birds.
These Birds of Paradise, the males magnificent in their velvety-black
and shiny green and purple plumage, are easily seen as they fly swiftly
through the trees, often stopping on vertical branches to look at you.
There are many Honey-eaters, particularly, low down in shrubs, the
pretty little Scarlet ( Myzomela sanguinolenta) . In the same bush one
can also watch the tiny and lovely Red-backed Wrens, and the Whip-
bird ( Psophodes olivaceus). Large Pheasant Coucals flop through grass
and bushes. Flocks of Red-browed (Sydney) Waxbills feed and flutter
low among flowering grasses and seeding bushes in which they feed
and nest, just in the same way as many of the African species, a
convincing proof of their close relationship. The beautiful songs of the
Grey and the Rufous Shrike Thrushes ( Colluricincla ) are heard ; also
that of the Whistlers (Pachycephala ).
Further inland, on distant ridges, we visited other forests, rather
drier and more open, with larger trees. We watched there the big
Topknot Pigeon, a fine fruit-eating species peculiar to Eastern
Australia, as well as doves, particularly the Pheasant-tailed ( Macro -
pygia). There were big flocks of Rainbow (Swainson's) and Scaly-
breasted Lorrikeets, and quite a number of Mealy Rosellas. A dozen
Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, perched high on trees where they fed, were
suddenly disturbed by a Goshawk soaring overhead ; they started a
fearful racket, the leader of the group taking flight after the bird of
prey which speeded away frightened. Dollar Birds ( Eurystomus ) and
Kookaburras were common. Many sorts of passerine birds are found
in those woods, including Drongos, Shrike-Thrushes, Whistlers, Honey-
eaters, White-eyes and Waxbills. We saw one Crimson-winged Parrakeet
flying about the trees.
The great Atherton Table-land, between the high hills, is well
settled and cultivated, mostly in tobacco, due to irrigation. There
were some ponds and meadows with Plovers, Straw-necked Ibises,
Darters, Jacanas, Egrets and White-faced Herons. The usual birds of
the open country were numerous.

There seems to be few aviculturists in Northern Queensland, but
Poincettia Garden, outside of Cairns, open to the public, has an
excellent bird collection. There are, well displayed, a very repre-
sentative series of Australian Cockatoos and Parrakeets, including a
number of young Golden-shouldered, fine pairs of Whampoo and
Nutmeg Fruit Pigeons, different doves, Brush Turkeys, and waterfowl,
including Maned Geese, Eyton's Whistling Ducks, and White-eyes.
Townsville, a large city and harbour, lies 200 miles south of Cairns,
but it has a completely different aspect. The surrounding country,
fairly hilly, is dry, with a short rainy season only. In its own way,
however, it is also most interesting to the ornithologist, who has not
long to wait as there is a shallow lake, near the airport, which is full of
wonderful water birds. Under the helpful and competent guidance of
Mr. H. J. Lavery, of the Animal Health Section of C.S.I.R.O., we
visited the whole district, mostly in search of waterfowl, which congre-
gate there in huge numbers during the dry season, nearing its end at
the time of our visit. The ponds near the airport had hundreds of
Magpie Geese and many Black Swans, both nesting there later on ;
some Maned Geese, numerous Black Ducks, Grey Teal, White-eyes,
some Green Pygmy Geese and a few Wandering Whistling Ducks. But
there were also many Australian Cotton Teal and Plumed (Eyton's)
Whistling Ducks which we had not seen in the Northern Territory.
The usual waders and shore-birds were abundant, and we saw, nearby,
over 300 Brolgas (Australian Cranes), a wonderful sight.
The Australian Cotton Teal, ( Nettapus c. albipennis) is very much
larger than the Asiatic one (N. c. coromandelianus) . It is actually bigger
than the Green Pygmy Goose (N. pulchellus ), and the difference is
striking when one sees the two species together. Another of its peculiar
features is that the male Australian Cotton Teal retains its bright green
and white plumage the year round, while the small Indian one keeps
it a few months only, during the breeding season.
Mr. Lavery took us 100 miles south-west, through dry country. We
saw many more Brolgas. A small pond, surrounded by trees, near a
house, was occupied by hundreds of Plumed Whistling Ducks, resting
on the banks and on low branches. Other pools studded with blue
water lilies, had little flocks of Green Pygmy Geese and Cotton Teal,
often mixed, which reminded me of similar waters in Africa and
Madagascar with African Pygmy Geese in their place. We saw more
of these lovely ponds when we drove north, and also more Cranes.
But they drop out of view when one re-enters the damper belt, about
eighty miles north of Townsville. We saw there more Nettapus , Jacanas,

Little Grebes, River Terns, ( S . leucoptera), Porphyrios, Glossy and White

small birds.

The Townsville neighbourhood is just as good for waterbirds as that
of Darwin. The lack of Radjah Shelducks and of some other species is
compensated by the presence of Plumed Whistling Ducks and Cotton
Teal, and the Brolgas are much more numerous. The lakes and ponds
where they are seen, however, are not too safe. Large Estuarine
Crocodiles (C. porosus) hide there, and every year fishermen fall victim
to these monsters.
VII.-- Tasmania
Lying off the south-eastern coast of the Australian mainland to
which it is linked by the archipelago of the Bass Straits, Tasmania is
a pretty island, with a gentler and greener scenery than most of
Australia. The western half is made almost inaccessible by abrupt
wet mountains dotted with lakes where few people can live. The rest
is an attractive rural country, hilly and picturesque, with a cool
climate excellent for fruit growing, cattle and sheep raising. Birdlife
is not as rich and varied as on the continent ; nevertheless it is abun-
dant, with fourteen endemic species ; a number of others have their
stronghold there. We spent a week in Tasmania and our visit was
made exceedingly interesting by the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Michael
Ridpath, both bird enthusiasts. Mr. Ridpath came from England three
years ago to join the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization (C.S.I.R.O.) and has since been in charge of the survey of
the Native Hen ( Tribonyx mortieri ), a large, almost terrestrial Rail peculiar
to Tasmania, which constitutes a good game bird, but could easily be
exterminated. It seems to be more closely related to the Moorhens
(Gallinula ) than to the Australian Native Hen ( Tribonyx ventralis) in
general proportions, colour pattern, and behaviour. It appears to
be related to Gallinula much in the same way that Notornis is related
to Porphyrio in New Zealand. We had a good look at the birds through-
out the country and more particularly at a sanctuary in the hills
where Mr. Ridpath has conducted a detailed and most valuable study
on the species. I may add that it is a handsome bird which lives and
breeds well in captivity, usually tame and interesting in its habits.
The city of Hobart, not yet too big, has an old world charm. It is
beautifully situated between a deep fjord and a fine wooded mountain,
Mount Wellington, which is a natural reserve. Mr. and Mrs. Ridpath
live on its slope, practically in the forest, with deep tree fern gullies and
mossy trees. Sugar and sugar-water are always available at a window
of their house ; as you sit comfortably inside, (it was very cool outdoors
in October), you could watch at all times dozens of pretty, small
Honey-eaters coming to feed. Strong-billed ( Melithreptus validirostris ),
Black-headed (M. affinis ) and Yellow-throated ( Meliphaga jlavicollis ),
three endemic species, were common, particularly the first two ; also
the Crescent ( Phylidomyus pyrrhoptera ) and farther away in the bushes,

the Yellow-winged ( Meliornis novae-hollandiae). Also many White-eyes
(.#osterops halmaturina ) fed at the dishes, and, along the road, lovely
Pink Robins {Petroica rodinogaster) could be seen. After dinner, on the
back porch, several Opossums came from the forest to eat toast and
honey which Mrs. Ridpath had disposed for them. These shy nocturnal
animals would allow her to handle them, so accustomed had they
become to her good offices.
We saw a good deal of the south of the island, lowlands and swamps,
as well as hills and mountains. We watched the large local Green
Rosellas, peculiar to the island, as well as the well-known Eastern one
in many places ; also the two endemic species of Black Magpies, or
Currawongs [Strepera arguta, S.fuliginosa). There were many Australian
Ground-Thrushes {gjoothera lunulata) and various small birds up the
forested slopes in the National park north-west of Hobart, among the
giant eucalyptus ( regnans and gigantea ) and the Antarctic Beeches. But
the most exciting sight up there was a large flock of Yellow-tailed
Black Cockatoos {Calyptorhynchus funereus), hardly discernible in nature
from the White-tailed (C. baudini) of south-western Australia, both
living in similar habitats.
The beautiful wooded hills surrounding the rolling meadows where
the Native Hens have been carefully watched for several years, had the
added interest of being the home of two pretty species. Swift Parrakeets
were plentiful on some flowering eucalyptus, feeding, calling, and
flying across the open spaces. These beautiful little birds are incredibly
fast on the wing, and when eating, they prove real acrobats. Despite
the fact that their tongue has no brush-like filaments, their colour
pattern, particularly of the wing, their narrow, pointed tail, their voice,
their diet and general habits, suggest a relationship to the Lories. The
other interesting species was the Firetail Finch {^onoeginthii 3 bellus ), a
a lovely seed-eater seldom seen in aviaries, where they prove difficult
to keep. Mrs. Ridpath throws millet and other seeds near a small
cabin which has been put up fairly high on the slope of an open
meadow, and the little birds, usually shy and hard to detect, come
fearlessly to feed from the neighbouring bush. They struck me as
fairly Waxbill-like in their ways, and they no doubt provide a link
between these birds and the heavier Australian Grassfinches, through
their congeners the Red-eared Finch, the Diamond Sparrows and the
Painted Finch. Along the road, around pools and streams, both
Native Hens ( Tribonyx ) and Swamp Hens ( Porphyrio ) are common ;
they never seem to notice or interfere with one another ; Spur-winged
Plovers were numerous. We saw many more on the way to Moulting
Lagoon, a large, shallow lake near the sea, about half way up the east
coast of the island. We were taken there one day by Dr. E. R. Guiler,
of the University of Tasmania, who conducts a detailed study of the
habits of Black Swans. The lagoon, surrounded by rolling meadows

where sheep graze the rich grass, is the home of about 1,000 pairs of
these majestic birds, which breed in reed beds and on islets between July
and November. There were many young birds of different ages at
the time of our visit (25th October) and pairs were still incubating.
We went over to a small islet, 100 by 50 feet, where nests almost
touched one another, many still contained eggs which the sitting birds
had reluctantly left when we landed, swimming nearby, waiting for
our departure to resume their duties. Dr. Guiler said that the islet
had 103 occupied nests in 1961. It was amazing to me that breeding

the lagoon : Australian Shelducks, with broods ; Black Ducks, Grey
and Chestnut Teal, Shovellers, Musk Ducks, and White-eyes, also

One of my community aviaries contains a pair of Maroon Tanagers
(.Rhamphocoelus carbo), the male of which was purchased 29th April,
1958, and the female 20th November, 1959. The other pair was a
male Blue-grey Tanager ( Thraupis virens) and a female Olive Tanager
(Thraupis palmarum atripennis ). This female was secured 20th November,
I959 &apos;
These two pairs of birds nested in canary nest-cups placed 5 feet
apart, and at no time were observed to interfere with each other ;
however, there was considerable competition for the available supply
of insect food when they were feeding young.

The first nesting of the Olive Tanager--Blue Tanager cross was in
1961. The nest was not discovered until the calling sounds of the four
young had given it away. They placed their nest inside an up-ended
parakeet's nest-box. These four young birds succumbed toward the
three-week period, undoubtedly from insufficient insect food.
In 1962, 10th April, to be exact, the hen was observed sitting on two
eggs, and 17th April, a single young was found dead in the nest. On

3rd May, two eggs were again being incubated, this time in a canary

found dead.
8th June the hen was again on eggs and shortly thereafter hatched
two young that lived for a week and a half. On 14th August she had
constructed another nest, her fourth for the season. These young
survived for a period of two weeks. The Maroon Tanagers first nested
6th June, i960. Four eggs were laid, broken, and eaten by some other

23rd April, 1961, the female was observed carrying nesting material,
and although she hatched eggs, the young could not be reared.
13th April, 1962, this female built a nest in a dense, suspended tumble
weed. Previously she had used canary nest-cups. On 27th April, two
pale blue-speckled eggs were in the nest. She set these eggs until

3rd May, at which time the eggs and nest were abandoned. On the

in it. On the 15th one egg had fallen out of the nest and the second
disappeared. 8th June she was again on eggs and early in July had
abandoned this nest.
Being of a nervous disposition it is believed that the constant
interruptions and interferences in her sitting caused eggs to chill, and
she would abandon her nest every time any one walked by the aviary.
She will be attempted to be bred this coming season as this pair of
birds have a better chance in an individual aviary where they will not
be disturbed, and when young hatch the parents will be liberated so
that they may secure their own proper food in a state of controlled
liberty.

A CLOSE-UP VIEW OF THE MOUNTAIN
WITCH DOVE

<bodyText confidence="0.98587195" page_id="56350295"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">
By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California)
Having for many years been attracted by both the beauty and the
behaviour of the Mountain Witch Dove, which I was so fortunate as
to breed successfully for eleven successive years, I am pleased to
present herewith a close-up view of this delightful dove.
Names Given the Mountain Witch Dove
Various names, both scientific and popular, have been given this
dove, whose habitat is Jamaica. Among the former appear Geotrygon
sylvatica, used by Philip Henry Gosse, in The Birds of Jamaica, published
in 1852 in London, which affords the reader one of the earliest and
most authentic accounts of the Mountain Witch Dove. Next in point
of time appears Geotrygon cristata , used by Dr. Arthur G. Butler in
Volume II of his Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary , published about
1899 ; and in 1901 this same appellation was used by the author of
" Bird Notes from the (London) Zoological Gardens ", appearing on
page 184 of the March, 1903, issue of the Avicultural Magazine,
no author having been named. The scientific name Geotrygon versicolor ,
in current use by most ornithologists, was employed as early as 1929
in an article titled " Ground Doves and Pigeons ", by T. H. Newman,
which was published in the June, 1929, issue of the Avicultural
Magazine. It appears likewise in James Bond's authentic Birds of the
West Indies , published in January of 1936, by The Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia, Pa. So much for a brief comment on this
dove's scientific names.
Among the popular and local names given Geotrygon versicolor are,
in addition to Mountain Witch, which seems to be the most widely
used. Crested Quail Dove, Blue Dove, Blue Partridge, and Mountain
Partridge or Mountain Dove.
Notes on the Natural Life of Geotrygon Versicolor
Gosse in the above-mentioned book writes most enthusiastically
concerning the Mountain Witch : " No description can give an
adequate notion of the lustrous radiance of this most lovely bird ;
though it has not yet found a place in our Ornithologies. . . . This
magnificent bird inhabits the most retired mountains, and the deepest
woody glades there ; places difficult of approach and rarely traversed.
In the dense and lofty forest that clothes the brow of Bluefields Peak,
it is very numerous, usually seen singly or in pairs, walking on the
ground ; the freedom of the forest there from underwood allowing it
to exercise its fleetness of foot to advantage. If alarmed, it generally
seeks to escape by running, its bulk and shortness of wing rendering

<bodyText confidence="0.993827613636364" page_id="56350296"  page_num="202" year="" vol="">
its flight burdensome and ineffective. Its coo consists of two loud
notes, the first short and sharp, the second protracted and descending
with a mournful cadence. At a distance its first note is inaudible ; and
the second, reiterated at measured intervals, sounds like the groaning
of a dying man. These moans, heard in the most recluse and solemn
glens, while the bird is rarely seen, have probably given it the name
of Mountain Witch. . . .
Various seeds and nuts I have found in the gizzards of many
(specimens) that I have examined, some hard and stony ; others
farinaceous, and comminuted. The seed of the lance-wood is said to
afford it food. The Mountain Witch is generally spoken of as rare in
the island ; but I suspect the remoteness and difficulty of access of its
recluse solitudes, have contributed to this opinion . . . Robinson says
it is the most beautiful pigeon in Jamaica. I should be inclined to say
4 the most beautiful bird ', if we except the Long-tailed Humming-
bird. . . . Of many which were procured for me in May, nearly every
one was of the male sex ; and they were shot from trees ; on inquiry
into this anomaly, I was told that during incubation the male invariably
lodges in a neighbouring tree ; a singular deviation from its ordinary
habits.
There is no appreciable difference between the sexes, except that the
male has the vent, under tail-coverts, and thighs of a deeper chestnut,
and empurpled. The red of the quills also is brighter."
In his Birds of the West Indies , James Bond introduces the Genus
Geotrygon as follows : "I well remember my first sight of the beautiful
Crested Quail Dove when following a trail high up in the Blue
Mountains of Jamaica. Just ahead of me a movement by the side of
the path caught my eye, and a moment later there appeared in full
view one of these splendid birds as it crossed over the trail a few paces
in front of me. The species is still quite common in the Blue Mountains,
but appears to be rare elsewhere in Jamaica, except in the 4 Cockpit
Country 5 of the west. ..."
Description of Plumage and other Characteristics
Typical of the descriptions of the Mountain Witch Dove's plumage-
colour is that provided by Jean Delacour in his book Wild Pigeons and
Doves : 4 4 These ground pigeons have their occiput and nape feathers
long, forming a thick, occipital crest. Their forehead and crest are
olive-grey, a broad, reddish-buff streak marking the cheeks ; the neck
is golden-green, shot with purple, the throat rufous-buff; the mantle
purplish-chestnut ; the lower back, rump, and tail-coverts are a
greenish-blue ; with a purple gloss ; the primaries cinnamon, the
secondaries and tail blackish-green ; the under-parts are pale-vinous ;
the flanks and under-tail chestnut. The hens are a little smaller and
duller, but difficult to sex."

The length of the Mountain Witch is given as being from 11 to
12 inches ; the tail from 3 * 75 to 4 inches ; the eyes blood-red ; the
bill blackish, and the feet pinkish.
Life in Captivity
According to A. G. Butler, writing in Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary ,
Vol. 11, the Mountain Witch Dove found its way into captivity first
in i860, various specimens being acquired by the London Zoological
Society in i860, 1861, and 1869. I can find no evidence of this dove
being in captivity elsewhere in Europe at this period. Dr. Karl Russ
in his classical work " Die Fremdlandischen Weichfutterfresser ",
published in 1899, confines his ten-line description of the Mountain
Witch Dove largely to comments on its plumage-colour and general
behaviour, making no mention of its being in captivity anywhere
except in the London Zoological Gardens. There it was, apparently
for the first time, bred successfully in 1901, two young being reared,
as reported in the March, 1903, issue of the Avicultural Magazine,
no details of this breeding being furnished. Judging from the very
few mentions of this dove--in my thirty bound volumes of this fine
journal I found but two--its importation has been very infrequent
to say the least, at any rate up to 1930.
I acquired my pair of Mountain Witches from a California dealer
in the late 1940s. About to release the birds from their shipping box
into a separate, small aviary, I removed a portion of the wire-front
when suddenly the male " shot " out of the container against the wire-
netting, in which, to my distress, his right foot caught for a few moments.
This sudden mishap caused it to be crippled ever after, its owner not
being able to spread the toes, but always keeping them " bunched up ".
Since the bird walked with a very noticeable limp, I foresaw difficulties
in mating and breeding, which however, failed to materialize.
To make a long story short, this pair raised one or more healthy
youngsters every year for eleven years in succession. It utilized the same
nest location, an open-top box 3 feet off the floor of the aviary, which
was planted with low shrubs and grasses. Since almost no nesting
materials were carried into the box by either male or female, I supplied
some hay for this purpose. Almost from the start, the birds proved to
be quite tame, especially the hen. It was but a few weeks after her
arrival at my place that she began to take mealworms from the hand.
Of these, as well as of angleworms, she was especially fond, eating a
dozen or more per day. She proved to be very aggressive toward other
species of doves, whereas her mate was much more docile and gentle.
I kept the pair in a separate aviary. The moment I entered it, the hen
would come running to me not in expectation of getting titbits, but
to " attack " me by pecking vigorously at my shoes with every step
I took. I had to be exceedingly careful not to step on her, so close

<bodyText confidence="0.994502627906977" page_id="56350298"  page_num="204" year="" vol="">
to me was she during every moment I spent in her aviary. The male,
on the other hand, would never come near me. Perhaps he remembered
still the great shock which he received upon being first released into
the aviary.
Both birds proved to be gentle and tractable in their nesting and
breeding. Even my close approach to their nest would not prompt them
to leave it, though the sitting bird would eye my every movement
sharply. As soon as youngsters appeared in the nest, both parent
birds assumed a definite anxiety, evidenced by warning notes given
the moment I went into the aviary and not ceasing until I left it.
Mountain Witches walk with a curious bobbing motion, which,
oddly, I have not seen mentioned in any description of their behaviour.
They spend most of their time during the day on the floor of the aviary,
while at night they roost high up. The young stay in the nest for about
twelve days ; upon leaving it, they usually remain on the floor of the
aviary until they learn to fly, when they exhibit a wildness instinctive
with all young foreign doves which I have raised. Their colour is a
bluish-black, giving no hint of the lovely array of hues that is to be
theirs upon maturity. As a matter of fact, the beauty of the Mountain
Witch becomes apparent only when the rays of the sun strike its
plumage with full force. This loveliness has to be seen to be
appreciated.
When Butler, whose book is mentioned above, writes, " I had been
assured by intelligent men, very familiar with these birds, that the
young Mountain Witch doves leave the nest about a week after they
are hatched, and are led about by the mother, who scratches for them
in the manner of a fowl ... I have made many inquiries, and found
the statement very general, almost universal . . ."--it is only fair to
assert and to emphasize, that the pair in my possession behaved
differently. Its young stayed in the nest much longer than a week, and
their mother never led them about in any way or fashion. Moreover,
I have never in all the eleven years of their breeding in my aviary
observed the hen scratching * { in the manner of a fowl ", an observation
which I suspect rests on insufficient evidence. Like Butler, I too, have
made many inquiries of other breeders of the Mountain Witch Dove,
none of whom can confirm the foregoing statements of his.
Present Status of the Mountain Witch in Captivity
There has been no importation of the Mountain Witch into the
United States during the past fifteen or more years. In consequence,
the continual inbreeding of the original stock has produced more and
more sterility. In point of fact, the species may soon become extinct
in confinement in this country. And there appears to be no prospect
of importing fresh stock. In the light of this continuous lack of breeding

successes, I was very agreeably surprised when recently Mr. Rudkin,
Jr., well-known California aviculturist, telephoned me that he had
raised one young Mountain Witch to maturity. To the best of my
knowledge, this is the first of its kind raised in many a year anywhere
in this country.

THE EDWARD MARSHALL BOEHM AVIARIES
IN 1962
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.A.)

It may appear to be a little tardy to write about aviary activities of
a past season, but I feel sure that many will agree that bird news is
always news, no matter when given. Actually the 1962 breeding
season was one of the worst in the eastern part of the United States of
America, both so far as the wild birds were concerned and in private
collections. This was no doubt due to the varied weather we experi-
enced throughout spring and summer that year. It was not possible
to formulate a pattern with it at all. Hot when it should have been
mild, cold when it should have been hot, and these vagaries in the
weather were further aggravated by the scarcity of insect life.
If everything started by the birds in the Boehm Aviaries had been
pursued to a satisfactory conclusion, we should have had an exceptional
year. However, although the ultimate results were disappointing,
much was learned of the nesting habits of some of the rarer species
housed within Mr. Boehm's spacious aviaries. Therefore, as some of
the species might have been probable breedings in captivity, I shall
detail all the birds concerned, irrespective as to what stage of breeding
they arrived. These I shall record in alphabetical order of their
common names, rather than in chronological order of the events.
The pair of Azure-winged Magpies that had bred in i960 (A.M.
i960, 223), laid eggs but deserted them. Two of the Bengal Pittas
bred in 1961 (A.M. 1962, 33), were paired together and built their
nest only to be killed by rats before they could proceed any further.
Attempts were made to pair up the original female with one of her
offspring but, although three different males were introduced, she would
not accept any of them. A Black-chinned Yuhina had been obtained
to replace one lost from the i960 breeding pair (A.M. i960, 230), but
it turned out to be of the same sex, female, as the survivor. They
actually built a double-chambered nest, suspended below a hanging
fern, and each laid a normal clutch in their respective compartments.
However, one of the most pleasing successful nestings was that of
a pair of Black-throated Cotingas --Pipreola riefferi --from which one

male was reared to maturity (A.M. 1963, 141). Similar fortune
did not favour us with the Black-headed Oriole --Icterus g. gularis --for,
although a chick was hatched, it disappeared from the nest at three
days old. The Black-headed Sibias that had made several unsuccessful
attempts to rear young the previous year, the chicks reaching the
fledgling stage only, this year produced three sturdy birds that, by the
end of the year, could only be distinguished from their parents by their
coloured leg-bands.
Five pairs of Black-headed Sugarbirds went to nest in their respective
aviaries, two of the pairs being unrelated birds bred here in 1961
(A.M. 1962, 49), but only three of the pairs reared young. As two of
the successful nestings were by aviary-bred birds it did at least reveal
that they breed at a year old. Blue-headed Tanagers reared one
young but the Buff-naped Tanagers got to the egg stage only and then
deserted their nest. Similarly with the Chestnut-breasted Nuthatches,
the pair having two clutches of five eggs each time, but failing to hatch
any of them. Such a condition did not exist, however, with the Chukar
Partridges for this pair had fourteen fine young that were all reared
to maturity.
A pair of Eastern Towhees --Pipilo erythropthalmus --that had been
taken locally the previous year, settled down well in captivity and nested.
Four eggs were laid, but only two hatched, the others disappearing
from the nest. One of the chicks was missing one day but the other
reached the fledgling stage only to be drowned during one of the
many torrential downpours we experienced in June. Although the
female built another nest, only one egg was laid and this vanished after
four days. A pair of the brown Thrushes brought back by Mr. Boehm
from Ecuador which had bred in 1961, five birds reared in all, made
several attempts in 1962 but all to no avail. Actually this bird has not
yet been definitely identified and that is why no previous report has
been made on the 1961 breeding. It is thought to be Turdus leucomelas but,
until such time as we are assured on this point, no claim in respect of
the breeding is being made.
Now follows a series of birds that all reached the egg stage but, for
varying reasons, failed to get any further. These include European
Blackbirds, Fairy Blue Wrens, Ferruginous Wood Partridges, Gold-
breasted Euphonias, Green Wood Hoopoes, Grey-winged Blackbirds,
Heuglin Robin Ghats, Hooded Pittas and Indian Robins. After this
spate of disappointments it is pleasing to be able to write that a pair of
Killdeer reared three young. Derby Flycatchers, the female having
been paired to her son bred the previous year (A.M. 1962, 64), reared
four young from two rounds, one from the first and three from the
second.
Knysna Touracos had laid eggs the previous year but they had all
proved to be clear. We were to be no more fortunate this season for

two nests of three eggs each again produced nothing. It was felt,
however, that more had been learned regarding the identification of
the individual sexes of the four Knysnas in the Boehm collection and
an apparent pair was segregated during the winter months with the
purpose of placing them on their own the following season in the hope
of getting some better results.
Working in an alphabetical order does at least break the monotony
of recording near misses, clear eggs, broken eggs, etc., for the next
species in order is the Kurrichane Thrush, the successful breeding of
the eastern race being recorded in A.M. 1963, 80.
In November, 1961, Mr. Boehm was presented with six pairs of
Birds of Paradise by Sir Edward Halstrom. It was only possible to
place one pair of these in the aviaries available in 1962 so the Lesser
Bird of Paradise pair was selected. The male was in full adult plumage,
although not in colour, and the female also was an adult. Despite this,
however, the male did appear to be rather intimidated by the female
and, although she built nests on four separate occasions from May to
August, the solitary egg laid each time was clear. They were left in
the aviary, heated throughout the winter, so that they might have the
opportunity of becoming better acquainted in the hope that there
might be fruitful results the next season.
A pair of Lesson's Euphonias must have fallen victims to a nest
robber, never traced, in an aviary that they shared with numerous
species of Tanagers, Sunbirds, Flycatchers, etc., for, from March to
June they had three nestings with four, three and three eggs respectively.
All the eggs disappeared within four days of the clutch having been
completed. Success did come a little closer in the case of a pair of
Mexican Magpie Jays --Calocitta formosa --for, from the two eggs laid
in May, one chick hatched only to be found dead on a wooden rail
in their aviary when it was five days old. This pair also were left in
an aviary to themselves in the hope that another year in there might
achieve ultimate success with their breeding.
The pair of Magpie Tanagers that had bred in i960 (A.M. i960,
225) and again in 1961, had been removed from their aviary in order
to accommodate some other birds. They had been placed in one of
the rooms in the main bird house, but this did not daunt them one
bit. Noticing that the female was collecting pieces of wood shavings
and trying to shape them into a nest on the floor in the corner of the
room, a small Hemlock tree in a tub was placed in there. A home-made
nest of wire netting and dried grasses was secured in the lower branches
and an assortment of nesting materials was placed in the room. Within
forty-eight hours a complete nest had been constructed within the
dummy one and she was sitting. Only one of the two eggs hatched, the
other being clear, but the chick was reared to maturity. This was

obviously a pair of birds that could not be deterred by change of
environment.
In April, 1962, Mr. Boehm had received a pair of Masked Wood
Swallows direct from Australia and by June they had built themselves
a nest in their feeder tray. As so often happens with birds that go to
nest before they have become fully acclimatized, although the eggs,
two of them, were fertile and hatched, both chicks were thrown out
of the nest at two and three days old. A pair of Mearn's Quail laid,
but failed to sit, so their eggs were put into an incubator, only for a
blown fuse to put an end to that means of reproduction.
Although Birds of Paradise are not the best of aviary companions
for other species, a pair of Malachite Sunbirds did share the enclosure
occupied by the Lesser Birds of Paradise mentioned earlier. The
female Sunbird built a beautiful nest suspended from the roof of the
aviary, about 12 feet up, but she fell victim to egg-binding so another
aspiration came to nought.
I know that it does happen that birds nest, rear young and nothing
is known about it until such time as the young birds are seen flying.
Such an event occurred in the Boehm Aviaries in 1962 with a pair of
Red-eyed Bulbuls --Pycnonotus nigricans. One morning we spotted the
two young birds but, search as we could, no nest was located. Unfortu-
nately they were both killed four days after having been discovered and
there was no means of telling their age. From their flying ability it was
assumed that they had fledged about three days prior to our having
seen them for the first time.
As with the Mexican Magpie Jays referred to earlier in this article,
a pair of Red-winged Starlings also had one chick, but it lived only
eleven days. These losses of young birds in the nest was considered
to be primarily due to the lack of sufficient variety in the live food.
Although every effort was made to provide regular supplies of meal-
worms and maggots, the general inclement weather, coupled with
extensive spraying carried out on the adjoining estates, was a deterrent
to the availability of other forms of live foods in the way of moths,
insects, etc.
Ever since i960 when Mr. Boehm brought back Royal Starlings
from Kenya, there had been a hope that they would breed. The
nearest they got to it is that they had four clear eggs in June, 1962.
The Silver-eared Mesias that had bred in i960 (A.M. i960, 233) and
again in 1961, had their nest robbed by the Derby Flycatchers each
time they made an attempt. As they were a reliable breeding pair they
were caught up and handed over to a zoo where, it is understood, they
have carried on the good work.
Spreo Starlings have bred each year for us and once again
reproduced their kind but only two this time as against four in each
of the previous two years. Tricolour Tanagers and White-browed

Wood Swallows had young but they failed to rear, again attributed to
lack of variety of live food. However, the White-breasted Crakes did
rear two fine birds as reported in A.M. 1962, 179.
To wind up the 1962 breeding season we had two hybrid Silver-blue
Tanagers. A male Thraupis cana paired to a T. episcopus. Originally
there had been a pair of the latter species in with the T. cana but the
male bird died. The parents had two nests with one young from each
but, owing to the location of their nest, in the upper part of an old
tree trunk well bored by woodpeckers, it was not possible to see how
many eggs there had been in each clutch or their colouring. Similarly
no information was gleaned as to the appearance of the young birds
prior to their being seen as fledglings. The young birds were six
months old when they were donated to a zoo and, at that date, they
favoured their male parent in appearance.
A summary of the season's records reveals that a total of forty-one
different species, regarding the hybridization as one species, plus eight
duplications were involved in various stages of breeding, but only
twelve species reared their young to maturity. This was our worst year
to date but, as mentioned before, the 1962 summer was the worst for
many years in New Jersey and to this had been attributed the scanty
breedings amongst the wild birds. These conditions undoubtedly
were reflected in the results achieved with aviary birds. Maybe 1963
will be more favourable and will give us the opportunity of bringing
our average of successful breedings back to their former level. Here's

Since the last News, a number of interesting new arrivals and births
have occurred. Three Hill Mynahs have been presented and are housed
in a compartment in the Parrot House. Two of them are talented
talkers, far better than most of the parrots.
A pair of the South American Black-necked Swans have now settled
down well after causing some anxiety when they first arrived. They
are almost certainly a true pair, so it is hoped that they will breed
next year.
Two so-called Lilford's Cranes are, in fact, Common Cranes ; these
two birds were extraordinarily nervous for the first few weeks after
arrival and as they were in a large two-acre enclosure it was worrying
when they refused to come for food with the other cranes housed with
them. Now they have calmed down and are as tame as the older
inhabitants. We now have five species of crane in the Gardens. Two

plumage. In spite of their name, these birds belong to the Stork
family. Their appetite is enormous and they will take six or seven
freshly-killed day-old chicks each in one sitting. In spite of their
appetites, however, they retain a " lean and hungry look ".
Four Lesser Snow Geese of the blue form were presented by Mr.
Frank Mosford and these, together with our original pair and several
odds and ends of geese, make up quite a nice flock. They live with the
penguins and pelicans and keep down the grass in their paddock very
effectively.
Five more Orange Cocks-of-the-Rock, two of them just coming out
of the immature dark brown, bring the numbers of these showy birds
at Chester up to eight. Seven are the Orange species and one the
Scarlet (Rupicola peruviana). Two have been set free in the existing
Tropical House, where, with Humming Birds, Zosterops, and Waxbills,
they make a most attractive show amongst the tropical vegetation.
A Red-rumped Parrakeet received in exchange provides a mate for
the cock and a number of others of the parrot family include an
Umbrella-crested Cockatoo (Kakatoe alba) and pairs of Elegant and
Bourke's Grass Parrakeets, Golden-mantled Rosella and Stanley
Parrakeets. Most of these were received in exchange for some of our
" crop " of 1963 Pennants, of which more anon.
Finally, our Owl species have increased by a pair of Mackinder's
Owls (.Bubo mackinderi) from East Africa, which were bred at Regents
Park, and six Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) in exchange with
Calgary Zoo. At the time of writing, 22nd July, the breeding season is
not quite over, but except for a few birds still incubating, we have a
fairly clear idea of the results. Our owls have again bred successfully,
the Great Eagle-Owls having hatched and reared four owlets for the
second year running. The Spotted Eagle-Owls only succeeded in
rearing one youngster this year, due to the hen starting to lay in the
very cold weather at the beginning of April. Only one egg was hatched,
the last of four eggs laid.
Perhaps the most exciting event has been the hatching of two
Humboldt's Penguins. They are now more than a month old and
appear to be thriving. They are still in the seclusion of their breeding
cave, with one or other of the parents constantly on guard. Only one
King Penguin is incubating, the single egg being due to hatch on about
12th August. We are hoping for better luck than last year, when two
pairs successfully hatched a chick each but neither survived more than
a few days.
The Black Swans had a good hatch of five cygnets from seven eggs
and the young birds which are now seven weeks old are splendid
specimens. It has been interesting to see the devoted care of the cob
and pen, sharing as they do a very large enclosure with cranes, ducks,
and duikers (a very small species of antelope).

A number of the commoner pheasants have been reared and a
single Swinhoe's Pheasant. Most were hatched and reared artificially
but a Silver Pheasant hen was successful in raising a family of five in her
public aviary.
Our resident Mallard must have hatched more than a hundred
ducklings but due to carrion crow trouble, only about forty have
reached the feathered state. These birds are left unpinioned and come
and go as they please. Other waterfowl which nested unsuccessfully
due to carrion crows were Lesser Snow Geese and Ashy-headed Geese.

Pennant's Parrakeets, have bred successfully. The two pairs of
Pennant's have reared four and five very nice young birds respectively.
The Barraband's X Crimson-winged Parrakeet pair which had a
single young one last year produced twins in May.
Picazuro Pigeons, Deceptive Doves, and Deceptive X Barbary
Dove hybrid have young, and to our disappointment the Crowned
Pigeons laid a number of eggs but failed to incubate.
Twenty-two other species, some of great interest, made nesting
attempts, but space forbids their being dealt with in detail.

One species and three subspecies new to the collection have been
received during the past two months. The species is the Basra Reed
Warbler ( Acrocephalus griseldis) which breeds in south-western Asia and
migrates to East Africa.
The African Yellow-billed Egret ( Mesophoyx intermedia brachyrhyncha ),
the White-cheeked Turaco ( Tauraco l. leucotis ) and Davison's Thrush
(Turdus sibiricus davisoni) are the new races.
The nominate race of M. intermedia , known as the Yellow-billed or
Wagler's Egret, of eastern and south-eastern Asia has been in the
collection, but some years ago. There is a third race M. i. plumifera of
Australia, New Guinea, Buru and Ceram, and this is known in
Australia as the Plumed Egret--in places as the White Crane, according
to Cayley.
T. 1 . leucotis inhabits north-eastern parts of Africa from Eritrea
to south-eastern Sudan : the southern race is Donaldson Smith's
Turaco (T. 1 . donaldsoni ) living in Somaliland and southern parts of
Abyssinia and which differs in having the tips of the crest feathers red
instead of dull bluish.
Davison's Thrush is rather like the Siberian Thrush, but darker ; the
males have less white underneath.

On the cover of the May-June, 1963, number of International Zoo
News there is a good reproduction of the young Rothschild's Grackle
recently bred in the Copenhagen Zoo. Last March the parents hatched
three young ones but threw them out of the nest. On 15th April a
single chick appeared in the nesting-box and this is thriving. The
first success with this species was, of course, that of our late President,
Mr. Alfred Ezra. In 1931, after many attempts a single young one was
reared by the female alone after the male was found dead.

The Giant Canada Goose Branta canadensis maxima has been con-
sidered extinct for the past fifty years or more. Now, however, it
appears to have been rediscovered. In the April, 1963, number of the
Game Bird Breeders , Pheasant Fanciers and Aviculturists ' Gazette , there is a
reprint of a report from the Sheboygan Press. According to this a flock has
been discovered wintering in Wisconsin in the vicinity of Turtle Creek
in Rock County. Positive identification came from Dr. Harold Hanson
of the Illinois Natural History Survey. Last winter the Rock Prairie
flock consisted of about 4,000 geese, mostly made up of the rediscovered
subspecies. To date, Dr. Hanson has located about 10,000 of the Giant
Canadas in the middle West.

Some seventy-five members and guests accepted the Seventh Annual
Invitation of the Chairman and Council of the North of England
Zoological Society to lunch at the Zoological Gardens, Chester, on
26th June, 1963. The Chairman of the Society, Miss Geraldine Russell
Allen, was unable to be present and in her absence Mr. Kilpatrick
welcomed the visitors. Mr. W. R. Partridge thanked the Chairman
and Council on behalf of our members. Every year I say that the
warmest thanks of our members are due to Mr. and Mrs. G. S.
Mottershead and their staff for making this event so very enjoyable.
Repetition makes the thanks none the less appreciative or sincere. Due
to their efforts our members in the North of England and the Midlands
are given a great opportunity of a gathering which otherwise would
not be possible. It is a very great pity that more members from the
South do not attend.
The day itself was not too bad--a little rain and a little sun. The
roses were out, but needed another week to be at their best. Winter has
taken its toll of quite a number of trees and shrubs, but the grounds, as
usual, looked immaculate. The Society has been invited again next
year, by which time it is to be hoped that the new developments of the
Tropical and Monkey Houses will be finished--they look like surpassing
even the Elephant House, which in itself is a masterpiece.

R. Busenbark. T.F.H. Publications, Inc., Jersey City 2 , N.J.,
U.S.A., 1963. No price given.
The authors of this book are, apparently, not only highly successful
importers and keepers of birds in California but also run a " bird
farm " and some associated pet shops. The book deals not only with
seed-eating and insectivorous passerines but also with rollers, trogons,
motmots, barbets, cuckoos, toucans, doves, quails, cranes, and many
other families of birds. All species that are commonly obtainable in
America (and some that are not) are dealt with. To a large extent,
although not entirely, the same species are usually obtainable in
Britain, so that this choice is no disadvantage to the English reader.
The first section of the book deals with such subjects as feeding,
housing, and acclimatizing birds. Although California has a better
climate than Britain and some foods and drugs obtainable in America
may not be here, most of the information given is equally applicable
this side of the Atlantic. The second part lists the species of birds, giving
for each the scientific name, a description of the bird, some brief and
usually accurate information on its habits and range, its availability on
the American bird market, and the authors' opinions on its charms or
drawbacks.
The style of writing is, naturally, American and so may at times
seem unnecessarily verbose to the English reader, unless he is a
bureaucrat. The sizes of the cages pictured on pp. 24 and 25 and
stated to be suitable for a pair or a collection of small seed-eaters struck
the reviewer as very much too small for the purpose. In America, as in
Britain, the aviculturist is regarded as the villain and the sportsman as
the favoured darling by many bird protectionists and the authors make
some heartfelt comments on the American anti-avicultural laws.
The book is very profusely illustrated with drawings and photo-
graphs, both coloured and black and white. These are uneven in
quality and range from really excellent paintings and photographs to
really hideous ones of badly-stuffed birds, like the American Robin on

p. 596. The many (unsigned) pictures that might be termed " diagram-
matic coloured sketches 55 (as on p. 588, for example), although
unpretentious, seemed to the reviewer among the most attractive and
effective in the book. However, any picture is better than no picture
when the reader is trying to get an idea of what some species he has
never seen looks like.
In spite of the criticisms made and some other points of disagreement,
the reviewer thinks this book will be of use and interest to most avicul-
turists. If he had not been lucky enough to get the free review copy he
would certainly have bought it !

Price 15^. net.
This excellent and comprehensive introduction to the sea-birds of the
world is the fourth of the series and well maintains the high standard of
previous volumes. Dr. Mary Gillham explains her subject clearly and
concisely and writes in a most interesting and attractive manner. The
line drawings by the author, which are interspersed in the text, are both
delightful and instructive and she also provides a large number of good
photographic illustrations. A glossary of terms used is a helpful
addition.
Not only young ornithologists but those not so young will wish to buy
this book.

Gallicolumba criniger
By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
Owing to the unique coloration of their plumage, principally the
bright-red or else the maroon patch on the breast, Bleeding-heart
Pigeons are great favourites with most keepers of foreign doves. While
many a pair of these odd beauties is being kept in private aviaries in the
United States in the hope that it will sometime nest successfully,
breeding results, on the whole, are meagre. To be sure, in isolated
cases, in which these rather rare birds receive special attention and
care, fairly numerous offspring have often been raised. To-day,
Bleeding-heart Pigeons are still regarded as being both rare and
" temperamental " aviary occupants, and more or less frequent impor-
tations from the Philippine Islands are needful to replenish American
stocks of this much-wanted and always popular wild pigeon.
In tracing the early history of Bleeding-heart culture, I find that a
truly noteworthy breeding success with the Luzon Bleeding-heart was
scored many years ago in Angouleme, France, by M. Delaurier, who
concentrated his best efforts on this species. To be specific, in 1877, his
breeding pair produced three young ; in 1878, six young ; in 1879,
sixteen young ; and in 1880, domestic pigeons, serving as foster parents,
hatched no fewer than twenty young from thirty-four eggs ! This
Bleeding-heart specialist ascribed his almost phenomenal success to the
use of foster parents, which, so he asserted, cared for the youngsters better
than did their natural parents. It is very doubtful that this enterprising
Frenchman's breeding results have ever been equalled, assuredly not in
the United States, even though the number of Bleeding-hearts kept in
private aviaries has in recent years increased appreciably.
While the Luzon Bleeding-heart Pigeon is found in many an aviary
collection in the United States, its near-ally, Bartlett's Bleeding-heart

Pigeon (Gallicolumba criniger) is much rarer, and probably always will
be, for lack of importations and for other good reasons. Somewhat
larger than the former, though quite similar in shape, posture, and
general behaviour, it differs in plumage coloration in that the top of its
head, the back of its neck, and the mantle boast a lovely green ; the back
and the wings a deep-chestnut ; the chin and the throat a pure white.
Moreover, there is the highly conspicuous, crimson-maroon breast patch,
which is both larger and darker coloured than is the bright-red " heart "
of the Luzon. An excellent likeness of Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeon,
painted from life by Gronvold, appeared in the June, 1909, issue
of the Avicultural Magazine. The striking plumage colours are
exactly and faithfully reproduced by this eminent artist, whose
discerning, sensitive eye missed no essential detail.
This very pretty pigeon derives its name from a Mr. Bartlett, who
purchased the first specimens to be seen in England from a Liverpool
dealer in August of 1863--a hundred years ago ! They were one male
and two females. Regarding them as representatives of a new species,
Dr. P. L. Sclater, noted British ornithologist, named them Phlogoenas
bartletti. In the years to follow these newcomers were given other names,
including Phlogoenas criniger , Columba criniger , with Gallicolumba criniger
serving as the currently accepted name. According to a Philippine-
Island authority, " this dove is fairly abundant in the Basilan Island
Group, but much rarer in Samar, where it frequents forest grounds,
running rapidly into dense cover and thus escaping without taking
wing."
Even though Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeon has been known to
aviculturists for a hundred years, published accounts of its having bred
successfully in captivity are, to say the least, very scarce. This writer
scanned the indexes of some thirty-odd bound volumes of the excellent
Avicultural Magazine in his library, but found only half a dozen
references to this species. The only truly comprehensive one among
them proved to be T. H. Newman's article in the June, 1909, issue,
titled " Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeon ". From this informative
account I shall quote certain pertinent and interesting details designed
to throw light on the behaviour in captivity of this lovely wild pigeon.
First and most important of all, Mr. Newman's article brings a report
by Dr. Sclater of this pigeon's nesting, which features certain high-
lights : " The single male paired with one of the two females in the
spring of 1864, breeding five times during the summer. The female
deposited only one egg each time, in a nest of small sticks built in a flat
basket placed 8 feet above the ground. Incubation lasted fifteen
days. Two of the young birds were successfully reared ; two others
died immature. . . . Several specimens were hatched in 1865, and one
in 1867, after which time the flock appears to have died out, and the
species has not been represented in the Gardens since."

Mr. Newman obtained a pair of Bartlett's Bleeding-hearts in 1907
from a Mrs. Johnstone, which had been brought to England from
Mindinao, often considered their main habitat, by Mr. Walter Good-
fellow. The last-mentioned person commented in part as follows,
" They are by no means common in their own country. . . . They are
forest birds, but do not perch in trees. You will see they are far more
beautiful than the ordinary (Luzon) Bleeding-hearts. I think I have
brought over the only specimens of these birds--two five years ago and
three two years ago."
Describing the behaviour of his Bartlett's, Mr. Newman writes in
part, 55 My birds spent nearly the whole of their time on the ground, and
had a wonderful way of hiding behind bushes. . . . They knew full well
how best to make use of all their beauty when displaying : when
turning in the direction of the hen, the cock had the curious habit of
standing quite still ; and at regular intervals of a few seconds he
would slowly raise his wings to their full extent above his back ; this
would be continued for a considerable time, but only when he could
see her. The display proper would begin by the cock lowering his head
and arching the wings so as to cause the bars to become very con-
spicuous ; he would then often pursue the hen. When quite close, he
would suddenly stop and squat down in an upright position almost on
his tail, with his head thrown back and his breast fluffed out and
protruded so as to exhibit the ' heart ', the buff flank plumes, which
are long and soft, standing well out on each side. Meanwhile, he
would utter his curious rumbling coo. As is usual in such cases, the hen
did not seem at all impressed, but rather anxious to get out of the way.
They were not very affectionate, and generally kept rather apart. ...
" On 17th June, 1908," Mr. Newman continues, " I found an egg in
a rough nest built in some ivy only about 18 inches from the ground.
The egg is large for the size of the bird, decidedly tinted with cream-
colour, and very long in shape ; the shell is rather smooth and glossy
in texture. ... It is very curious that crinigera should lay only one egg,
while luzonica should lay two at a clutch. ..."
All egg-laying proved fruitless until 13th October, when Mr.
Newman reports that " Both birds were sitting together on the nest,
which I had not seen them do before, and I found the egg had hatched,
making the period of incubation seventeen days. On 15th October,
I noticed that the young one was sparingly covered with pale-yellow
down, and its flight feathers were beginning to show through the skin.
The hen did not leave the nest, and she resented my looking at the young
one, which was growing fast : the down on the upper surface of the
body seemed darker (pale-fawn), the primaries and secondaries were
sprouting well with other feathers in the wings, no feathers visible
anywhere else, eyes beginning to open. . . . The young Bartlett left
the nest on the 28th. Its wings and legs were very well developed, but

the tail was very short, only just beginning to show ; there was a pale,
whitish patch of feathers below the bare chin, no sign of red on the
breast ; in fact, the area was still bare. . . .
" The first beginning of the ' heart 5 appeared early in November ;
also the nape and back of the neck assumed a green tint, which became
gradually brighter ; the crown, however, still remained chestnut. The
red patch on the heart began to show when the bird was about six
weeks old, at first in the form of red stripes down the breast."
The hen of Mr. Newman's pair, as well as the young bird, died in
December, the cock following in March of the next year. Commented
this breeder : " During the whole time I had these birds they per-
sisted in roosting in the open, and though the first winter seemed to
have been gone through without any ill effects, the exceptional severity
of the last one was, I think, too much for them. . . ."
So much for the early breeding of Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeon.
Now I wish to trace the behaviour of a breeding pair which I acquired
two years ago. Thus supplementing the excellent account which
Mr. Newman gave many years ago, my comments are meant to
emphasize distinctive aspects of breeding behaviour.
At the time the pair was offered to me, I hesitated long before
accepting the offer because the hen's plumage was in deplorable
condition. The feathers on her breast and belly, instead of lying smooth
and flat, stood almost erect as if the bird had been plucked severely,
which indeed may have been the case. Moreover, she was listless,
standing about in a corner of the aviary and giving every appearance of
not being well. Being, however, desirous of once again keeping and
perhaps breeding these handsome pigeons, at the same time being
unable to obtain their likes anywhere else, I took the pair home and
placed it in a small separate aviary. My immediate concern was, of
course, for the well-being of the hen, the cock being in excellent plumage
and health. In the hope of improving her badly ruffled feathers, I
ordered a tube of the widely-used " Federvit " from Germany and
used it promptly--but with no visible effects whatsoever. Next, I
mixed some codliver oil with the milo and corn that constituted the
birds' principal grain diet, and I also dipped the mealworms which
these doves took greedily in codliver oil. Moreover, I fed them a
generous portion of diced Longhorn cheese every single day. Very
slowly the ailing hen's health seemed to improve : she took more and
more interest in the food proffered her and she ate more and more of it.
Her plumage, however, remained badly ruffled, showing here and there
naked spots on the breast and abdomen. In fact, it never regained its
normal, smooth texture during the entire time this bird lived in my
aviary.
I was much surprised when after a period of four months, the hen
evinced an interest in nesting : she began to sit in a feed-crock set in a

hanging, glass-enclosed box, in which I had placed short-cut hay to
serve as a nest foundation. This arrangement the pair accepted readily,
and without adding nesting material to speak of. Whenever she was on
the floor of the pen, her mate pursued her so rapidly and so continu-
ously that she sought refuge either on a high perch or else in the feed-
crock. Twice she sat almost the entire day and night on the make-shift
nest, as if indeed she were brooding, However, she did not lay the
single egg until the fourth day, when she began to incubate in earnest
and when also her mate began to relieve her from approximately ten in
the morning until late in the afternoon. Incubation proved fruitless :
the egg was infertile, as were the next two, laid at intervals of three
weeks. This state of affairs did not surprise me in view of the hen's
plumage, which was still in bad condition. I should add at this point
that she was noticeably smaller than the cock, much less colourful, her
breast-patch being duller and smaller ; in short, she was easily
identified as a hen, probably an imported specimen and one having
been given very inadequate care in captivity.
So as not to lengthen this account unduly, let me simply state that
this pair during a single season managed to raise six healthy youngsters,
of which one died when three months old. The remaining five,
considerably larger in size than their parents, are still in my possession,
and in excellent physical condition. At best, Bartlett's are difficult to
sex. Thus far, I am sure of only one hen among them, she having laid
once, and she is about to lay once again, her first egg being infertile.
Sometimes by bringing three or four specimens of these pigeons together
in not too large space, but space affording them suitable retreats, the
sexes will " sort themselves out ", so to speak, that is, the males, pro-
vided of course they are in breeding condition, will soon assert them-
selves aggressively in the presence of other males and females. Sexing
Bartlett's Pigeons simply by the size of the maroon breast patch is not
an efficient method, there being often hardly any difference in the size,
or in the intensity, of the crimson-maroon.
I fully agree with Mr. Newman in his comments that these pigeons
show little, if indeed any affection toward each other, even during the
height of their breeding activities. The hen appears always to be on
the alert--as if expecting her " lord and master " to pursue and attack
her, which he will certainly do, should she deign to leave eggs or young
during her regular brooding time. Bartlett's, moreover, appear to be
restless creatures, nervous, even though I keep each pair strictly by
itself in a pen, 4 feet wide, 8 feet high, and 10 feet deep, planted with
some shrubs. Thus the birds are afforded privacy, and since the pen is
solidly roofed over, there is complete protection from above. Yet,
despite this management and the care they get daily, the five fully-
grown young and the old male have shown, until yesterday when one
pair began to nest, no inclination to breed for many months in

this paradisiac climate. Little wonder that many fanciers call these
Bleeding-hearts " temperamental ". It simply means that we do not as
yet understand their special needs sufficiently well to be able to cater to
them suitably and fully. And it is surprising how little effort many
bird-keepers make to arrive at such an understanding. I welcome the
challenge which so-called temperamental wild doves and pigeons
present in captivity, for it serves as an incentive to discover through
gradual, careful observation little-known phases of their natural actions
and reactions which may prove practical and valuable in inducing
them to breed successfully.
My Bleeding-heart Pigeons, both Bartlett's and Luzons, use the
same nesting site again and again, and often they do not bother to
re-build the old nest at all. Whichever bird is sitting, male or female,
will turn to face me when I enter their pen and at once assume an alert
position. These pigeons will not tolerate repeated nest inspection :
I have learned to leave them strictly alone, inspecting the contents of
their nest only when it is not occupied, and then very carefully. Their
diet consists of milo and maize, with daily additions of diced cheese and
live mealworms or angleworms. These additions are increased when
young are in the nest. An excellent food, though rather expensive, is
shelled sunflower seed, which seems to be their favourite.
Currently (I am writing this article in July) I seem to be the only
person breeding Bartlett's Pigeons, at least in California. But there must
be other birdlovers as fortunate as I am. If so, let them come forward
with their observations of this most beautiful pigeon, so that we may
exchange and compare our experiences for the benefit of all interested
parties. There have been, it seems to me, far too few reports of breeding

With the death of David Seth-Smith on October 30th, 1963, the
Avicultural Society has lost a much loved President and one who has
done more for aviculture and the Society than any other single person.
His whole life had been bound up with the Society since its earliest
days--as he wrote in the Jubilee number of the Magazine in 1944--" It
is difficult to believe that half a century has passed since, in November,
1894, I was handed a proof of the first number of a new journal to be
entitled The Avicultural Magazine by my old friend, J. B. Housden, who
thereupon put my name up for membership ". David Seth-Smith was
Editor of the Magazine from 1901 to 1907, with Dr. A. G. Butler,
1907-1908, and with Frank Finn, 1908-1909. After an interval of
some years he again took on the editorship with R. I. Pocock from
1920 to 1923, and then with the Marquis of Tavistock for one year 1925.
From 1926 to 1934 he edited the Magazine alone. It is owing to
Seth-Smith that the Magazine has reached the position it now holds
in ornithological literature for not only did he develop it as Editor but
he was a constant contributor and his numerous articles on many
groups of birds still remain indispensable for reference. In addition,
his series of articles " Early Years of the Avicultural Society " which
appeared from January, 1939, to April, 1940, are an invaluable record
of the activities of the Society and the achievements of its members.
Mr. Seth-Smith was elected a Vice-President in 1950 and on the
death of his old friend Alfred Ezra, became President in 1956. His
constant and keen interest in all aspects of the Society's activities
is shown by the fact that he was a founder member of the British
Aviculturists' Club (established in February, 1946) and was its first
Chairman, remaining in this office till 1954. He was also a founder
member and Trustee of the Ornamental Pheasant Trust which was set

David Seth-Smith was no less distinguished as an ornithologist and
did much to obtain recognition of the value of aviculture ; as early as
1905 he contributed a paper on " The importance of Aviculture as an
aid to the study of Ornithology " at the International Ornithological
Congress held in London that year. He was elected to the British
Ornithologists' Union in 1901 and was a Vice-President from
1938 to 1941. His other services to ornithology included the editorship
of the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists ' Club which he carried on from
1915 to 1920 ; he was made a Vice-Chairman of the Club in 1936-37
and was Chairman from 1943 to 1946. He was also deeply interested in

bird preservation and took a great part in the work of the International
Council for Bird Preservation acting as Treasurer of the British
Section from 1936 to 1957.
David Seth-Smith was a keen nature photographer and was not only
expert in taking photographs, but also did all development of negatives
and enlargements himself. His photographs were of very high standard
and many of his studies of birds have appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine . A few years before his death he presented his extensive
collection of negatives to the Zoological Society of London.
Mr. Seth-Smith was an all-round naturalist and his knowledge of
mammals, insects, fish, and all forms of animal life was outstanding ;
he was also no mean botanist and a great gardener. His simplicity and
his deep love of nature gave him the ability of imparting his knowledge
to others and he can justly be acclaimed the pioneer of natural history
broadcasts, when in the years before the war he broadcast every
Monday in the Children's Hour. His listeners included " children 55
up to 90 years of age and again and again he topped the poll in the
popularity vote for broadcast programmes. There is no doubt that the
quiet, friendly voice which began " This is the Zoo Man speaking 55
played no little part in arousing the great interest in wildlife which has
become so widespread to-day.
Starting his career as a civil engineer, Mr. Seth-Smith was Inspector
of Works, Zoological Society of London from 1909 to 1923, but living
things were his dominating interest and in 1923 he became Curator of
Birds and Mammals, which post he retained till his retirement in 1939.
He married in 1901 Miss Mary Scott by whom he had a son and two
daughters. After her death he married, in 1946, Miss Heather
Heydeman.
David Seth-Smith was a man of innate kindness and his great
variety of interests and sense of humour kept him ever young in spirit.
His wife Heather shared in, and identified herself with, all his interests,
and always accompanied him to international conferences and to the
functions of the Avicultural Society--to her the sympathy of all
Members is extended.

A COMBASSOU AND A PIN-TAILED WHYDAH
By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
I recently purchased from a local pet shop a small assortment of the
more usual cage-birds with a cock Combassou in breeding plumage
which appeared to me to show some peculiarities. The plumage was
black with a marked dark-blue gloss that had a slight violet tint, the
bill was white faintly flushed with pink, and the legs and feet were red.
An examination of museum skins showed that it most closely resembled
Hypochera funerea. The wing-butts showed brown when the bird raised
them a little away from the body, and there was a slight concealed
white patch on either side of the rump.
All these details are typical of a normal Combassou, but in addition
there was a single narrow feather of uniform width arising from the
upper tail coverts and appearing about 2 inches long. It extended well
beyond the normal tail, and was slightly asymmmetrically placed
towards the right-hand side. In addition there was a single white
feather on the mid-breast.
Apart from this the only other thing I noted about it was an excite-
ment note, a loud harsh nasal " chuc ", rather like the harsher chirps
of the House Sparrow, Passer domesticus. At times a series of similar notes
were run together to form a long harsh rattle with a slightly fluctuating
pitch, rather reminiscent of the furious scolding of a Wren, T. troglo-
dytes. This could be the " sustained twittering " referred to by
Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1955) for Hypochera.
Now there is a blue long-tailed Whydah, the Steel-blue Whydah,
Vidua hypocherina , but this is a much lighter blue over the whole plumage
and has white on the under wing-coverts and inner webs of the flight
feathers, and this white also shows on the edges and butts of the closed
wings. The bill is greyish-flesh, and the feet dusky-flesh coloured. This
is confined to dry thorn country in East Africa from Abyssinia to
Tanganyika and is local in occurrence. Little is known of it. It is a very
unlikely species to turn up in a small pet shop after passing through the
hands of various dealers.
The bird described here is much more likely to have originated in
West Africa. H. funerea would seem to have played a major part in its
production, but some other species appears to be involved. The most
likely is the Pin-tailed Whydah, Vidua macroura. This has four long
" tail feathers " (these feathers arise in the upper tail-coverts) similar
in shape and appearance to the one possessed by this bird, but consider-
ably longer. In addition it has large areas of white on the plumage
including the breast.
Hybrids are relatively likely in the Whydahs. In spite of the difference

between males in breeding plumage the females are all very alike ; and
in addition captive Whydahs are notorious for their readiness to copu-
late with almost any small bird irrespective of species or sex. Nicolai
C 1 959) comments on their tendency to mate with birds of species
which have different soliciting postures, and records that males of the
Shaft-tailed Whydah, V. regia, and the Cameroon Combassou, H.
camerunensis, responded immediately and copulated with soliciting
hens of two Serin species before the males of the Serin pairs appeared
to become aware of what was happening. In such circumstances inter-
specific matings between the much more similar Whydahs themselves
would seem to be even more likely, and in related species might be
expected to produce natural hybrids in the wilds.
The appearance of this hybrid may give us cause to review the case
of the Purple Whydah. Only three male specimens of the latter are
known, two being referred to and one illustrated by Roberts (1940) and
a third found among imported birds and kept by C. Everitt, and pre-
sented on its death to the British Museum (Natural History). The
Purple Whydah was originally thought to be a species but is now
suspected to be a hybrid between a Combassou and the Paradise
Whydah, Steganura paradisea. These birds are black with a marked
purple gloss over all the plumage. They have long tail-feathers which
vary from one individual to another but although smaller and more
modified, most closely resemble those of the Paradise Whydah. Since
the hen Whydahs are relatively similar, and the apparent hybrid
cocks show a greater resemblance to one parent than another, it is
possible that a hybrid hen might escape notice. In addition Abrahams
(1939) has described an apparent hybrid between a Paradise Whydah
and a Shaft-tailed Whydah.
From the five apparent hybrids one may conclude that where inter-
specific hybridization occurs in the Whydahs between Combassous and
other species there is a tendency for the Combassou colour to persist,
and for the cock to show tail-feathers similar to those of the other parent,
but modified in both length and shape. This would seem to support
Friedmann's view (i960) that the Combassou represents the earlier,
more generalized, form of Whydah, from which the more elaborately
plumaged species have evolved.

(Continued from page igg)
This great State not only includes the largest city in Australia,
Sydney, but also the capital territory (A.C.T.) surrounding Canberra,
which has been carved out of its south-eastern part, on a high plateau.
It shows a considerable diversity. Near the coast, and on the mountains
along it, the climate is temperate or cool in the southern parts, even
cold at higher altitudes, with a great deal of snow in the winter ; but
it is subtropical and warm in the north. There is a good rainfall in the
east, twice as much as in southern California, but the plain becomes
dry west of the mountains and the mallee covers most of it. There are
therefore great differences in the fauna and flora.
Our visit to Canberra was made particularly interesting by the
presence in the capital city of Mr. H. J. Frith, Officer-in-charge of
Wildlife Survey section of C.S.I.R.O. He had already arranged for
our visits throughout the country in the most kind and efficient way.
Mr. and Mrs. Frith had come to Sydney to greet us when we first
arrived there. Thanks to him we had an excellent general view of the
birds of the region.
The wildlife survey section of C.S.I.R.O. is comparatively new.
Until it started operating, bird studies in Australia had been carried
on either by Museum curators who were not always given the means
to work as they wished to, and by amateurs, who, fortunately have
been numerous, enthusiastic, and well informed since the end of the
last century. Now a number of well equipped, adequately provided
positions are available to biologists who, under Mr. Frith's directives,
can make exhaustive surveys of the fauna and its life habits. Birds are
featured particularly as they altogether make up the best part of the
local game, and they are important to agriculture. The outstanding
beauty of many Australian species are also a considerable asset in the
field of recreation, and a special attraction to visitors from all over the
world. Dr. Warren Hitchcock, Assistant to Mr. Frith and president of
the R.A.O.U., took us around Canberra the first day. Eastern Rosellas
and Red-rumped Parrakeets can be seen in the numerous parks and
open places of the new city, as well as the usual common birds :
Magpies, Mudlarks, Red-Wattle Birds, Willy Wagtails, Noisy Miners,
and the like. We were particularly interested in flocks of White-winged
Choughs ( Corcorax ), fairly large, sooty black birds which certainly
neither look nor behave like crows.

Mr. Frith, busy as his position keeps him, insisted in showing me
himself the country around Griffith, some 200 miles to the north-west
of Canberra, where he has been stationed several years and done a
great deal of work, particularly with the Mallee Fowl on which he has
recently published an excellent book. As one drives to the west, the
plateau and the hills grow lower until the interior plain is reached,
much drier than the higher country. There is much mallee, but a great
deal of it has been cleared for farming. Irrigated fields around Griffith
make the large town an important agricultural centre. It must be a
particularly favourable climate for growing roses, which in November,
were in a state of splendour I seldom had seen before. Birds were
numerous throughout ; Galahs abound, and, west of Griffith we saw
some twenty Leadbeater's Cockatoos feeding in a large field, the only
ones ever encountered during our trip. Red-rumped, Blue-bonnet,
Barnard's Parrakeets and Cockatiels were common. Also Kestrels,
Brown Falcons, Whistling Eagles, and Black-shouldered Kites ;
Bee-eaters, Sacred Kingfishers, and Kookaburras ; Emus appeared
here and there, and also a few Red Kangaroos. Mr. Frith took us to
the mallee patch, now a reserve, where he studied the Mallee Fowl.
The birds are quite tame there ; soon after we entered the wood we saw
a female, feeding ; further on was the nest. Mr. Frith dug it open and
showed us a large egg. The male was walking around quite near,
disturbed and agitated, but not at all shy, and eventually came to the
nest and started filling up the holes while Mr. Frith was still on it.
Great Grey Kangaroos live in the mallee and we also saw some
Owlet Nightjars (Aegotheles ), many Babblers (Pomatostomus), Trillers
(. Lalage ), and White-winged Choughs. Perhaps the most interesting
spot was the curious wooded marsh, full of large eucalyptus and other
trees growing on hundreds of small islands and even in the water,
located on a large sheep station, Woowandard, near Booligal, 120 miles
west of Griffith. These peculiar swamps have more or less water and
consequently change greatly in size according to rains ; they may
remain dry for several years. They were moderately full in November,
1962. We spent several hours in a small flat-bottomed boat in a
veritable bird paradise. There were Cockatoos, Parrakeets, and
numerous small birds in the trees, and many nests. White-breasted
Sea Eagles flew through the branches, where sat Nankeen Night
Herons and three species of Cormorants ; Black Swans breed there,
rather unexpectedly, on the narrow channels between the trees, as
well as Coots and Little Grebes. A number of Black Ducks, Grey
Teal, White-Eyed, and Pink-eared Ducks could be seen swimming
ahead of the boat, and we even watched a Freckled Duck, a rare and
puzzling species, which Mr. Frith was as anxious to show me as I was
to see it. It was a thrilling moment.
Large reedy swamps, much of them dry, extend outside the drowned

forest, and we saw there more ducks, Cormorants, Herons, Darters,
Straw-necked and White Ibises and Yellow-billed Spoonbills. A pair
of Wedge-tailed Eagles, very large, were flying high up, the only ones
I could detect during the two months I stayed in Australia. The drier
and higher land was also very interesting. The owner of Woorandara,
Mr. Keith Turner, unlike most other sheep farmers, loves and protects
the local fauna. There were many Cockatoos, Crested Pigeons and
other birds, and hundreds of Red Kangaroos, a truly marvellous sight.
Mr. Turner does not believe that these wonderful animals do a great
deal of harm on the station, ten of them not consuming what one sheep
does. May his example contribute to stop the senseless slaughter of
Red Kangaroos !
Mr. Frith had arranged for Mr. Joseph M. Forshaw, one of his
assistants, to show us the Snowy Mountains, to the south of Canberra,
various interesting areas in its vicinity, and the eastern coast. Mr. For-
shaw is making a detailed study of Australian Parrots and Parrakeets,
the first results of which have already appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine. He first took us to the farm of one of his cousins, in the
hills not far from Canberra ; we had some interesting hours there.
The grassy slopes have many scattered old eucalyptus, full of holes,
and there lives a large colony of Pennant's, or Crimson Rosellas, as
well as some Redrumps and Eastern Rosellas. These birds, well
protected, have been studied carefully.
It was cold, wet, even snowing in the fine mountains where great
dams have recently been built. They are well wooded and bird-life
is abundant on them. We were particularly anxious to see Gang-gang
Cockatoos, and we found a few of these strange and beautiful Parrots
feeding and sitting on trees as snow was falling.
Sydney has some beautiful country in its very suburbs, and quite a
good deal of it has been made into preserves where the native fauna
and flora are protected. There are some well-known ornithologists in
the city, and I had the pleasure of seeing many of them at a meeting of
the R.A.O.U. Mr. Alec H. Chisholm is well known outside Australia
as a prominent ornithologist, and I had already had the advantage of
meeting him in Western Australia, when, like myself, he had come to
see the Noisy Scrub Bird. He and another well-known ornithologist,
Mr. K. A. Hindwood, were good enough to take us to the foothills
and to show us, in a wood, the bowers of the Satin Bower Birds.
Besides these fascinating birds were many Bell Miners ( Manorina ) a
fairly large Honey-eater with a crystalline call mixed with harsh notes.
The woods are very well stocked with small birds. We drove through
the cultivated country. Various Cockatoos frequent old trees, and in
marshy places, Pelicans, Jabirus, Ibises, and Spoonbills are seen as
well as other waterbirds. Yellow Robins, Blue Wrens, Leaden
Flycatchers, several Honey-eaters, particularly the pretty little

Spinebill, are common in gardens, along with Blackbirds and Gold-
finches imported from Europe, and also Red-eared Bulbuls and Spotted
Doves from Asia.
No aviculturist arriving in Sydney can wait to meet Sir Edward
Hallstrom, a notable Honorary Fellow of our Society. As he is a close
personal friend I was most anxious to see him. But he still was in the
United States when I first arrived in Sydney, attending a meeting of
the International Union of Directors of Zoological Gardens at San
Diego, (where I should have been myself!). I had to wait until my
return from Queensland to find him. Sir Edward has for many years
very efficiently managed the Sydney Zoo at Taronga Park and
generously stood the cost of most of the installations and of the acquisi-
tions of rare animals. At the same time he possesses wonderful private
collections of birds in and outside the city (Willoughby and Mona Vale),
and also on the highlands of New Guinea (Nondgul). I naturally
was most interested in seeing it all. Sir Edward's kindness and
hospitality are proverbial among zoologists who have visited Australia,
and I was not disappointed.
Sir Edward Hallstrom's main object is to keep and breed animals
and birds under the most favourable conditions. Their health and
comfort come first, and the planning has been primarily practical.
Most installations at Taronga Park and at his private places are very
large, substantially built with solid concrete shelters, sometimes even
partitions and floors. It provides a maximum of protection, privacy,
and sanitation. He has proved highly successful, the longevity and the
rate of reproduction of birds and mammals have been greater there
than at any other zoo I have seen so far. The favourable climate of
Sydney, much like that of southern California or the Mediterranean
Riviera, perhaps even milder, also has contributed to this happy state
of affairs. Because of the complete prohibition to import any birds or
ungulate animals, it has been extremely important to prolong their
life to the utmost, and to propagate them as much as possible. Needless
to say, the feeding and general care are excellent and very carefully
devised.
The bird collections at the Taronga Park Zoo, although handi-
capped by the import prohibitions, are extremely good in Australian
and New Zealand species (birds from New Zealand are permitted to
enter Australia, but not those from New Guinea), and I will not
endeavour to enumerate all those represented ; all the better and
more suitable ones are kept. There still is an excellent series of
Birds of Paradise, all there since twelve years or more, each bird or
each pair living in very deep, long aviaries, carefully protected and
planted wherever possible. A few have reared young, particularly
Salvadori's. Victoria Crown Pigeons are very numerous, and also
Nicobar Pigeons and Jobi Doves, which breed in great colonies in big

flight cages. Parrots and Parrakeets are very well represented, both
native and exotic species, many breeding. There are dozens of lutino
Ringnecks, and many more in Sir Edward's private aviaries, 400 in all,
and continually increasing, all reared from a few pairs imported years
ago. Ostriches and Rheas breed freely. Waterfowl are comparatively
few as accommodations are difficult because of lack of flat ground and
of natural ponds. But Magpie Geese and Black Swans are continually
breeding.
Sir Edward's home is situated on one of the small rocky, pretty
peninsulas of the harbour, itself a long picturesque fjord, and he has
built around the rugged shores rows upon rows of aviaries, mostly
for parrots. There are numerous pairs of Cockatoos, particularly of
the rare and difficult Glossy Black (Calyptorhynchus lathami), Macaws,
Amazons, and Grey Parrots, and many have been reared there. Each
pen is very long, with a large shelter and wind-breaks, most practical
and suitable for parrot breeding.
The smaller Parrots and Parrakeets are now kept at Mona Vale,
a valley near the coast, in the lovely country north of Sydney. Much
of the background is a national park, and it is all well wooded, hilly,
and attractive. Sir Edward possesses there a weekend house in the
middle of a good acreage. There are large enclosures with several
species of Kangaroos, Wallaroos, and Wallabies, many of them
albinos, white strains of them being established. It was the only place
where I saw a number of Apostle Birds ( Struthidea ) feeding in the
company of more widespread species. They are curious birds, tame,
inquisitive, and amusing in their ways. Several rows of large, well-built
aviaries stand at the back of the house ; they contain a selection of the
rarer species, many pairs of each. The most striking ones were the
lovely Golden-Shouldered and of their hybrids, a pair of lutinistic
Turquoisines, two pairs of albino Galahs, which retain their pink
head, neck, and breast, and, of course, lots of lutino Ringnecks.
I have seen many large and successfully kept Parrakeet collections in
the world, but none as well housed and cared for as those at Mona Vale.
I spent a few days in Sydney now and then between trips to different
parts of Australia, to New Guinea, and to New Zealand. Each time I
had delightful visits with Sir Edward Hallstrom, looking at or talking
about the objects of our common interest. I am certain that the
members of the International Union of Zoo Directors, due to meet
there in 1964, will enjoy enormously a visit to the Australian metropolis,
particularly the hospitality of their host. I am naturally looking forward
to being there.

Cassowaries. It has the richest avifauna in the world, after Colombia,
in the number of species represented. My age does not allow me any
longer to go on tiring and difficult expeditions, as I used to in the past,
and I have to content myself with easier trips, which fortunately air
transportation has made possible to-day. Therefore a quick visit to
Sir Edward Hallstrom's Station at Nondugl, in the Whagi Valley of
the central highlands, was a perfect opportunity. Sir Edward's health
last November did not permit him to come with me, but he kindly
arranged for my visit. I flew to Port Moresby, an insignificant town
among the dry hills of the coast, and soon a small, old plane (DC 3)
was to take me to Goroka. However, landing there was prevented by a
storm, and I found myself at Madang, on the east coast, which is
hilly, lush, and attractive. But soon a six-seater flew me up to Goroka,
over the high mountains. The other passengers were all native
Papuans, in local dress, that is to say a small belt, shell or bone face
ornaments, and feathers in the hair. Goroka is an important centre,
with a good hotel. The view of the mountain ranges is magnificent.
Two tame Cockatoos roamed the grounds. Papuans swarm, as else-
where in the high valleys, between 5,000 and 6,000 feet of altitude.
Short, but sturdy, brown with large, hooked noses, they reminded me
of some Japanese masks. They are active and friendly, obviously
intelligent. Another little plane took me over a range to Minj, some
20 miles from Nondgul, where I was driven by landrover along a
difficult road, as the wide valley is cut up by ravines such as I had
never observed elsewhere. I was welcomed by Mr. Fred Shaw Mayer,
the well-known collector, whom I have known well for many years.
He had brought over, in the thirties, year after year, magnificent birds
from New Guinea and the neighbouring islands for my late friends
Herbert Whitney, Alfred Ezra, and John Spedan Lewis, and also for
me. He now manages Sir Edward's property in New Guinea. I was
glad to spend four days with this old friend and to talk of the past,
as we have so many common memories.
Mr. Shaw Mayer has laid out the grounds at Nongdul with great
skill and taste, and besides the numerous aviaries, there are several
large ponds, beautiful trees and shrubs, and orchids. Many wild
conifers grow in the area up to the top of the high mountains
(. Araucaria , Podocarpus , Cypresses), also many large ferns, ( Cyathea ,
Angiopteris ), pandanus, but few palms. One species of local eucalyptus
looks entirely different from the lowland ones.
Wild birds are not numerous in the high valleys for two reasons.
First, the native avifauna is a forest one, and few species have adapted
themselves to the open and cultivated spaces, which now prevail ;
those which naturally frequent them have only j&apos;ust started to come.
Second, the natives are great and skilful hunters. They know the
birds and their habits perfectly, and as they want the feathers of many

of them to decorate their hair, and the body of all for the pot, destruc-
tion is appalling. They are very choosy about feathers and they only
seek particular ones to which some religious or legendary interest
attach. The chance of supplying them with artificially treated feathers
of domestic birds to protect the wild ones is absolutely nil. Peacock
feathers for instance, have been completely ignored by them. Local
birds living around 5,000 feet, and consequently within their reach, are
doomed. This is unfortunately the case of the Salvadori, Blue, and Lesser
Superb Birds of Paradise, once common around Nongdul, now scarce.
Only a few females and immatures can, with luck, be encountered.
Captive birds at Nongdul, however, make up for the scarcity of wild
ones. The aviaries number nearly one hundred and consist of four
well-spaced rows of ten compartments, each of the proper size for a
pair of Birds of Paradise, and of several groups of bigger ones. All have
large shelters at the back, and are very heavily planted, except a few
containing Parrots and Birds of Paradise particularly destructive to
vegetation ; some are very large. It is an excellent and most practical
installation. The climate at Nongdul is temperate ; it can drop to
40 degrees at night. It is warm during the day, but there is little sun
and much rain, the sky being often overcast. I was lucky during my
visit to the highlands, as it was dry and sunny ; an unusual drought,
I was assured. The birds of these high valleys, and more so those living
higher up, are therefore fairly hardy.
Birds of Paradise predominate in the Nongdul collection. There were
in November, 1962, about 160 of twelve species ; Salvadori's,
Finch's Lesser, Blue, Ribbontail, Stephanie's, Meyer's Sickle Bill,
Carola's Six Plumed, Loria's, Wattled (Loboparadisea ), King, Hunstein's
Magnificent, King of Saxony's. I had never before seen the latter
alive ; there were several males adorned with the tremendously long,
horny head feathers. Four species have successfully nested at different
times ; Blue, Lesser, Ribbontails, Stephanies', the last two having also
produced hybrids. To this must be added Salvadori's. Three young,
plumeless males and several females live in a large, planted flight,
and there was a nest. Mr. Shaw Mayer so far doubted that non-adults
could breed, but we looked into the nest : there were newly hatched
chicks in it !
I had never seen before anything like the Nongdul aviaries, and it
taught me a great deal. It appears to me that the usual treatment of
Birds of Paradise in Europe and in the United States is wrong. Their
cages are too small ; they are given too much heat ; they are overfed.
They should be in large, outdoor aviaries, well protected from winds,
with a large shelter at the back kept just warm enough (40 to 50 degrees)
during the coldest days. Indoor cages in hothouses are unsuitable.
A good length for the larger species is 25 to 30 feet, by 6 to 10 feet wide ;
smaller compartments (18 x 6) will do for Kings, Magnificent, and

other similar birds. The more space the better. The food they receive
at Nongdul consists, in the morning, of a mixture of mashed papaya
and banana (io per cent of the latter), crushed dog biscuit and fresh
ant eggs. This food is eaten by mid-day, when the birds are given plain
fruit, mostly papaya and any available berries. Only a few (six to ten)
mealworms a day ; no meat. When ant eggs and papaya are not
available comparable ingredients can be used, but, on the whole,
this is a very satisfactory diet. Mr. Shaw Mayer is a great expert ;
his birds and also those of the Sydney Zoo, live longer and in better
condition than in any other collections I have ever visited.
There are other interesting birds at Nongdul ; Pesquet's Parrots,
Green-winged King Parrakeets, Eclectus, Opopsitta, a Long-tailed
Buzzard (Henicopernis ), Victoria Ground Pigeons and lovely little
Salvadori's Ducks, three of which were brought in when I was there.
Young were reared a number of times in previous years on the large,
natural ponds of the garden. Mr. Shaw Mayer found them very
pugnacious and one pair only could be kept on each pond. Clutches
always consisted of three eggs.
While I was at Nongdul, native men and boys were constantly
coming in, sometimes large parties, to bring ant eggs and other
insects, fruit, and berries, and sometimes birds. It always was exciting,
and it reminds me of the good old days in Indo-China.
The local inhabitants although they had been in touch with
" civilization " for thirty years only, are certainly quite superior.
They always had good farms, growing quantities of sweet potatoes,
other vegetables and fruits, and raising pigs and chickens. This
abundance of food kept them out of the cannibalistic habits, so pre-
valent in other parts of New Guinea and in several South Sea Islands
not so long ago. They no doubt have a sense of beauty seldom seen
among primitive people. Not only do they adorn themselves with
shells, feathers, leaves, and flowers, but they line all the roads and
paths with ornamental shrubs and plants. They grow Buddleia,
Hibiscus, Cannas, Achyranthes, Alternantheras, Lupins, and other old
garden favourites, as well as annual flowers such as Marigolds, Cosmos,
Coreopsis, Zinnias, etc. They will buy any seeds they can find, and
when travelling, they collect cuttings of plants new to them. I had
never seen before such a craze for gardening. They may astound the
world if they are given a chance.
Sir Edward Hallstrom must be warmly congratulated for having
established the remarkable bird centre of Nongdul. He has there
experimental plantations, particularly coffee, and he has presented
the Government with several of them. His Bird of Paradise collection
is unique in the whole world, and thanks to him and to Mr. Shaw
Mayer, a great deal of new knowledge has been gathered on this
beautiful family.

My visit to New Zealand had to be shortened to two weeks as
transportation to New Caledonia was not available at a later date.
I therefore was unable to see as much of that fascinating part of the
world as I had intended to. I was particularly disappointed to miss the
off-shore islands ; Great and Little Barrier, Kapiti and Stewart, where
much of the native avifauna, now scarce or even extinct on the two
larger islands, has been preserved. An endeavour to reach Kapiti
failed as bad weather made it impossible to cross the rough channel.
I shall have to try again soon.
The two main islands of New Zealand are very different, but both
are beautiful, temperate, and green. There are volcanoes, lakes, and
geysers in the North Island ; alpine ranges and lakes, barren plateaus in
the centre, wet fjordland in the west, and a fertile eastern plain in the
South Island. The scenery reminded me more of Europe than of
Australia. It is a moist, cool, evergreen country, and there are none of
the eucalyptus trees, except planted ones here and there, which give
such a special character to the southern continent. A great deal of
the ground has been cleared and transformed into fields, meadows,
and European and American trees, widely planted, add to the oddly
northern temperate look of the land. The native forest however is
quite peculiar and very fine. With the exception of the large Kauris,
Araucarias and other conifers of the North Island, and some Antarctic
beeches, indigenous trees are not very large ; they all grow very
slowly, while the northern imports reach in half the time twice as
large a size as in their native countries. Monterey pines and Cypresses,
European oaks, etc., grown for timber or windbreaks, soon become
enormous. The native undergrowth is marvellous, particularly the
ferns, which prosper even in chilly climates. Several species of tree-
ferns, Cyathea {medullaris and dealbata) and Dicksonia abound. The
smaller ferns, particularly the translucid ones which cover fallen logs,
low trunks, and branches, are marvellous.
The clearing of much of the country has had a terrible effect on the
local bird life, which was adapted to forest only. A few species have
become extinct ; others only survive on islands and in other sanctuaries.
They are now well protected and have begun to increase in numbers.
The avifauna never was very rich in species, as it always happens on
isolated islands. But it consists of very interesting forms. The largest
have been extinct for several centuries : the various Moas, some of
them gigantic, large Swans, Geese, and Eagles. It is to-day easier to
see European or Australian birds, all well adapted to open country, than
native ones. Starlings, Blackbirds, Song Thrushes, Hedge Sparrows,
Yellow and Girl Buntings, Song Larks, Greenfinches, Goldfinches,
Redpolls, Chaffinches, Rosella Parrakeets, Australian Magpies are
abundant as well as Canada Geese, Black Swans, and Mallards.

My friend Dr. R. A. Falla, Director of the Dominion Museum,
welcomed me at Wellington. He and Dr. K. E. Westerskov, Head of
the Wildlife Bird Division, most kindly showed me the birds of the area
and arranged for friends to help me elsewhere. Dr. Falla's home, on
the other side of Wellington Bay, is on the edge of the forest, full of
beautiful tree-ferns, and also of native birds. We had very interesting
moments watching them while, over the sea, many birds, including
Albatrosses and Giant Petrels, could be seen. There are two similar
but entirely different small Gulls in New Zealand ; a lesser race of the
red-billed Silver Gull and the black-billed Buller's Gull. Both are
common, often in mixed flocks, and occur far inland.
Dr. Westerskov drove me to Mount Bruce, a very interesting station
where he endeavours to propagate, under control, some of the rarer
birds. The enclosures are excellent and well kept. I was thrilled to see
there two pairs of Takahes ( JVotornis ) the huge Porphyrio long believed
extinct, which was rediscovered some years ago in the Southern
Fjorland. The birds, captured young, are very tame, just coming into
breeding condition. Eggs have already been laid by the older females,
and they are surprisingly small for her size ; they have so far proved
infertile. But they no doubt will hatch when the birds are completely
adult. Very thickset, with large bills, short legs and toes, they are
magnificent, having much brighter tones of blue and green than in
any Porphyrios. There were a number of Weka Rails, still locally
common in some districts of both the North and the South Islands,
and on Chatham and Stewart Islands, I was told ; Kiwis, also
still numerous in places ; one Kakapo, a very rare bird ; pairs of
Red-fronted and Yellow-fronted Parrakeets, now almost confined to
the smaller Islands, and a few other species. The area being a sanctuary,
several wild native birds are easily observed : wonderful, large Pigeons

bronzy black Tui ( Prosthemadera ) and the dark green Bell Bird

and Wrens (Xenicus). Blue Porphyrios were common along the road.

Unable to cross to Kapiti Island, Dr. Falla took me to various spots
on the opposite coast, where Black Ducks and Mallards were common,
and also Shovellers. The introduction of the northern Mallard has
been unfortunate ; it has spread through many parts of both islands
and has hybridized with the native Black (or Grey) Duck (A. super -
ciliosa ) producing a large mongrel population. We returned to
Wellington over the hills, where a good deal of forest has been pre-
served. Tree-ferns are magnificent, and near the east coast are small
groves of the native Areca Palm (Rhopalostsylis ), long popular in
European conservatories.
The Wellington Zoo has interesting native birds and some foreign
animals.

Christchurch, the main city of South Island, lies in the coastal
Canterbury Plain, sheltered by the hills of Bank's Peninsula to the
south. It is a well laid-out town with a beautiful park and a good
museum. Mr. E. G. Turbot, who is in charge of Natural History there,
knows the local birds extremely well. He and Mrs. Turbot were the
kindest of hosts. We saw a number of interesting areas, particularly
the large, brackish Lake Ellesmere, south of Bank's Peninsula, a water-
fowl paradise. Three hundred Mute and 10,000 Black Swans live and
breed there. Black Swans have increased so much that their eggs are
regularly taken and sold on the Christchurch market, as their numbers
have saturated the area. There were also many Ducks, Porphyrios,
Stilts, White-faced Herons and Gulls. The whole population of the
introduced Canada Geese, which breeds on the southern highlands,
comes to Lake Ellesmere to moult and to winter.
I drove through the rich, cultivated Canterbury Plain and the
open barren plateau, up to the magnificent Mount Cook National
Park, where snowy peaks and huge glaciers, coming down as low as
3,000 feet, compose a magnificent scenery, reflected in milky glacial
waters. There are some native birds in bush patches, but the most
spectacular ones there are the Keas, a few of which could be seen
flying in the valleys. They come early every morning to the hotel,
perch on the roofs and beg for food at the windows. Introduced
Chukhor Partridge showed up on rocks once or twice, and along the
streams of the moraines, pairs of Paradise Shelducks protested loudly,
and sometimes flew up, as we passed.
Another long drive along desolate highlands and over small ranges
took me into higher valleys, picturesque and fertile, and finally to
Queenstown, on lovely Lake Wakatipu, the long arms of which are
bordered by rugged mountains. Its clear waters, along the shore, are
full of enormous trout ; many ducks, quite tame, come to feed on
breadcrumbs. The majority are Mallard and Black Ducks, and their
hybrids of all sorts ; also New Zealand Scaup, a pretty endemic species
common throughout the island. A few pairs of Canada Geese had
young chicks. I was able to observe at leisure a pair made up of a male
Black Duck and a hybrid female (Black Duck X Grey Teal). The
latter, as well as Shovellers, Scaup, and Black Ducks could be commonly
seen on pools and farm ponds throughout the neighbouring country,
as well as isolated pairs of Paradise Shelducks, several with broods.
Buller's Gull is common at Queenstown.
I flew back to Wellington and went by road to Rotorua, North
Island, where Mr. A. G. Hall of the Wildlife Service, showed me the
geysers, lakes, and hills of this interesting district. New Zealand Scaup
were very abundant and tame where rivers flow into Lake Rotorua.
I might add here that the White-eyed Pochard, who had invaded New
Zealand from Australia in the past, has now completely disappeared.

Gulls nest in colonies on islets. At the Government Game Farm,
Mr. Hall showed me interesting birds including some forty Weka Rails
which had been trapped in the neighbourhood where they are
numerous and prove a nuisance raiding chicken yards and eating eggs.
They were to be transported to wilder districts.
On my way to Auckland I stopped at Tauronga. I had there a
pleasant day with Mr. and Mrs. P. M. Roberts, visiting their aviaries
of rare Parrakeets and Finches, as well as the very attractive country,
and meeting my old correspondent, Mr. M. E. Fitzgerald, who was
successful in keeping Blue Ducks.
The Auckland Zoo is well laid out and kept, and its Director,
Mr. Woods, was very kind to me. He has under his care a good collec-
tion of native birds, particularly several Kiwis and four beautiful
Kakas, the rarest of the two native Parrots, which are scarce and more
difficult to keep than the familiar Keas ; they also are prettier birds.
Notwithstanding great import restrictions, the general collection of the
Zoo is quite a creditable one.
Of my short visits to New Caledonia, Fiji, Tahiti, and neighbouring
islands, where I hope to return shortly, I only want to say that both
the Red-headed Parrot Finch, near Noumea, and Peale's, around Suva,
are actually very common in the grass and the bush. Some imported
species are much in evidence in gardens and along roads ; Chestnut-
breasted Finches and Sydney Waxbills in New Caledonia ; Avadavats
and Java Sparrows in Fiji ; Common and Sydney Waxbills in Tahiti ;
Common Mynahs (A. tristis ) are tame and numerous on all the islands,
while Jungle Mynahs (. A. fuscus ), Red-Vented Bulbuls and Spotted-
necked Doves are also common in Fiji.

The year 1962 was one of many disappointments for breeding soft-
billed birds here. My female Red Bird of Paradise laid one egg, but
I no longer have a male. On introducing my male Lesser to her all
further attempts ceased. The two birds have since been together and
now are finishing their moult. Five Shamas were reared from two pairs,
five Common Babblers ; three Turdus cardis ; and five Clarines
(Myadestes unicolor). My Allen Hummingbirds nested twice but rain
and wind ruined the nests and eggs. Collies Magpie Jays had three
young to twelve days old when I left for a few days and upon my
return all had disappeared. I suspect the pair of Oropendolas. Mexican
Brown-headed Motmots nested in an earth ledge in a greenhouse but
without success. Australian Struthideas again built several mud nests

By Dr. Reginald E. B. Brown (Newcastle, N.S.W., Australia)
Concerning Mr. Goodwin's questions re Java Sparrow in the March-
April Magazine. I have some of these and find them very free breeders
as is usual in Australia. I think that his trouble is climatic rather than
dietary as many are reared here on millet alone. As far as the blue
type goes it is usual here to get mostly blue young ones even when
breeding from pure whites ; the blues are exactly like wild birds.
There are so many of them here that they are of no value at all, and
they are all bred from whites. No Java Sparrows have been imported
since before the war. My birds fly in a large planted aviary without
shelter and they breed very easily. Food is millet, milo, wheat, soft
food, green food, raw meat, white ants, and they steal any precious
mealworms they can get (mealworms cannot be bought in Australia
so are precious). This food is not specially supplied to the Javas ; it is
really for the other birds, but they eat it all.
I have noticed the extraordinary friendship that exists between Javas
and doves, in my case it is the Bleeding-hearts ( luzonica ). It is not
unusual to see a Bleeding-heart sitting on the nest and the Java sitting
on its back and a couple more nestling beside it. It is not due to cold as
I have seen it when the temperature was 90* F in the shade. I have
never seen this occur with the Green-winged Pigeons or Cape Doves
which also share aviaries with Javas.
A man in Sydney has bred a race of cinnamon Javas. They were
bred originally from whites, but their immediate ancestors were pied.
They have pink eyes and consequently poor sight.

(.Barnardius barnardi)
The Mallee Ringneck Parrot, one of the most beautiful inhabitants
of the interior of eastern Australia, was described by Vigors and
Horsfield in February, 1827, from an account found in a manuscript
belonging to John Latham. The locality of the type specimen was
given as New South Wales. The specific name applied to the new
parrot was barnardi in honour of Barnard the famous French naturalist.
Being readily recognizable as a broadtail, it was included in the genus
Platycercus and thus became established as Platycercus barnardi. This
remained until Bonaparte (1854) created the new genus Barnardius with
barnardi as the type.
The adult male Mallee Ringneck Parrot exhibits a showy combina-
tion of blue and green relieved by yellow and red markings. The
crown and nape are bright green bordered by a red frontal band and
bluish ear coverts. There is a brownish band from the eyes to the occiput
where it extends in a V-shape almost to the yellow collar of the nape,
which gives this species its vernacular name and is characteristic of the
genus. The underparts are of a turquoise-green with an irregular
orange-yellow abdominal band. The back and mantle are of a deep
blue-black, while the shoulders are yellow. The secondary coverts,
upper tail-coverts, and rump are green. Bluish-green is the colour of
the primary coverts. Brilliant royal blue is found on the primaries,
secondaries, and undersides of the wings. The upper sides of the tail
feathers are green, while the under-sides show a beautiful bluish tinge.
The outer edges of the secondary tail feathers are tipped with white
giving a characteristic effect when fanned. It is a medium-sized stocky
bird and the following measurements and details were obtained from
specimens collected near Euston, N.S.W. These birds were examined
by the author on 2nd March, 1963.

The generic name Barnardius has not received universal acceptance
and many ornithologists follow Peters (1937)? who stated that there
were no structural characters justifying the existence of Barnardius.
Peters went further by combining all the forms of this genus into the
one species. However, Condon (1941) exposed a difference in the
cranial osteology of Platycercus and Barnardius. This difference is most
marked in the auditory region and was used by Condon to uphold
the generic distinction. The author is in complete agreement with this
arrangement.
Australian authorities do not accept the combination of the eastern
and western forms into one species as advocated by Peters. These
two forms are distinctive in the colour of their heads. The arrangement
whereby two species of the genus Barnardius are recognized will be used
in this series and, in the author's opinion, should be universally adopted.
Barnardius barnardi barnardi, the typical subspecies, is the race whose
description is given above. It is found in the semi-arid interior of New
South Wales and Victoria. This race appears to reach its peak of
development in the Murray Basin region. The author has collected
specimens of the Mallee Ringneck Parrot from many areas in the
eastern states and has reached the conclusion that the distribution of
the typical race is not as widespread as has been generally accepted.
B. b. barnardi is restricted to the Murray Basin, and the stand of Callitris
and Mallee covering most of the wheat belt of New South Wales to the
Queensland border. The birds inhabiting this area of better country
have the blue-black mantle of the nominate race.
Mathews (1918) commented on the difficulties with the subspecific
analysis of this species. The peculiarly strong degree of variation present
with this bird made it possible to describe many races with a few speci-
mens, only to be confronted with complete confusion when more
material was carefully examined. In fact this confusion was rampant
amongst the early authorities and subspecies were described from
individual variations.
In 1912 Mathews described Barnardius barnardi augustus from a speci-
men taken at Port Augusta. This race was distinguished in having a
grey-green mantle and back. The range was given as South Australia.
Condon (1914) gave the range as that area bounded by Port Augusta,
Yorke Peninsula, and Lake Alexandrina. He also drew attention to
the presence of birds intermediate between this race and barnardi
inhabiting the mallee areas west of the River Murray. In fact this
intermediate bird is found right along the western fringe of the range
of B. b. barnardi , and in southern inland Queensland. As the arid areas
of far western New South Wales and Queensland are approached the
mantle and back becomes greenish. In many birds the head becomes
dark thus showing affiliation to the race whitei , but this appears to be

completely variable. Adult males collected by the author at Cobar,
Wilcannia, Ivanhoe, N.S.W., and St. George, Queensland had green
backs. None of the many birds observed by the author in these areas
showed the blue-black back of barnardi. The author believes that the
parrots of the arid western areas of New South Wales, and of the
interior of southern Queensland are of the race augustus and not
barnardi as was previously believed. Although there are some differences
he does not believe that the tabulation of a new race for the birds of
these areas, as proposed by Condon in 1941, is warranted. The distri-
bution of barnardi and augustus will be discussed at length in another
paper the author has in preparation.
From a specimen taken at Ulooloo, South Australia, Mathews
described Barnardius barnardi whitei in 1912. This race is distinguished
from augustus in having the head, from the red frontal band to the
yellow collar, uniform dark brown. Considerable confusion has arisen

about the colour of the back of this race. Cain (1955) was utterly
confused by the variation in the skins he examined and came to the
conclusion that the northern populations possessed dark backs
approaching that of barnardi , while the birds from the southern districts
of the Flinders Range had greenish backs nearing augustus in this
characteristic. These variations in the birds of this region were attri-
buted to a hybrid zone by Cain (1955). There appears to be no evidence
to uphold the existence of a hybrid zone between B. b. whitei and
B. zonarius but the evidence does support a theory of past gene flow as
outlined by Condon (1962). This gene flow resulted in the brownish
head and the wide abdominal band so marked in B. b. whitei.
S. A. White tabulated Barnardius barnardi lindoi from a male he
collected at Moolooloo in the Flinders Range in 1915. The description
given left no doubt that it was synonymous with the above. However,
the importance of the description of the immature bird given by White
has been generally overlooked. In this description he draws attention
to the red frontal band which is very bright and decreases in intensity
with maturity. This is most interesting when it is compared with
B. zonarius , the young of which often show red frontal bands which are
lost with maturity. White also made the observation that these birds
of the northern Flinders Range resemble B. zonarius in their habits
and habitat.
Much interest was aroused in the ornithological world with the
description of Barnardius barnardi macgillivrayi by North in 1900. Origi-
nally described as a new species, the Cloncurry Parrot was reduced
to a race by the R.A.O.U. Checklist in i960. This markedly distinctive
race is an excellent example of isolated development. The plumage of
the Cloncurry Parrot is of a far more delicate hue than that of B. b. bar-
nardi. The adult male differs in having the mantle and back light green
and in lacking the red frontal band, the head being a uniform green
with remnants of the brownish band from the lores to the occiput. The
lower parts of the ear coverts are bright light blue merging into a pastel
bluish-green on the sides of the head. The abdominal band is more
pronounced and even, and is of a pale yellow colour. The lesser wing
coverts are green instead of deep blue. Immatures are slightly duller
in plumage and possess a faint orange-yellow frontal band. The type
bird, a female, was collected by W. Macgillivray at Leilavale Station
on the Fullarton River about 30 miles east of Cloncurry, North
Queensland. The details of this specimen are as follows :--

noticed a strong difference in the plumage of a Mallee Ringneck Parrot,
thought to be an adult female, but later proved to be a male. This
bird was richly coloured with an abundance of blue ; the entire breast
was blue-green. The yellow collar was only faintly indicated by a small
yellow patch on each side of the neck, while the abdominal band was
completely absent. He used this bird as a type to describe a new species,
Barnardius crommelinae. The fact that this bird was an aberrant cyano
form did not impress Mathews and it was figured in a colour plate
some two years later. Subsequently many aviculturists stated that they
had seen similar birds and many stated that they had successfully
reared such variants as members of an otherwise normal brood. The
author examined a bird answering the above description in the skin
collection of the Australian Museum. This specimen (No. 014845) was
collected in the Coonamble district of New South Wales. Another
specimen (No. 014842) collected in the same area was a typical
barnardi. B. crommelinae was described from an aberrant form and has
no claim whatever to validity.

Although by no means confined to Mallee regions, the Mallee
Ringneck Parrot is aptly named, for few areas of this distinctive country
in the eastern states are devoid of populations of this brilliant parrot.
Open forests, timber bordering rivers, and watercourses, Native Pine
(Callitris sp.) stands and Mulga groves are other habitats of this species.
B. b. macgillimayi appears to differ somewhat from the other races in
showing a marked preference for large eucalyptus trees growing along
watercourses. As the exact southern limit of this race is unknown it
cannot be ascertained if the distribution is restricted by this habitat
preference.
Just as it is uncertain how far south the Cloncurry Parrot is found, the
northern limits of the southern subspecies are ill-defined. The Windorah
area of Queensland and Coopers Greek in South Australia seem to be
the most northerly observation reports. The western limit of distribu-
tion lies roughly on the 138th meridian of longitude. Primarily an
inland species of the semi-arid region, the Mallee Ringneck Parrot
visits the coastal areas only in the south-east of South Australia.
Barnardius barnardi is frequently observed in pairs or small family
parties feeding on the ground or in the outer branches of a tree. Their
plumage, although showy and brilliant, harmonizes with the sur-
roundings and generally an observer is unaware of the presence of
these parrots until they take to the wing. While flying through the trees
the flashes of green and blue exhibited by the birds are most impressive.
The flight is undulating and closely resembles that of the Rosellas.
The wings are left extended between beats, not withdrawn into the

body as in some other species. When undertaking a flight from one
tree to another, B. barnardi usually flies close to the ground rising with
the tail fanned before alighting. On the banks of the Murray and other
large inland rivers, where the habitat is large River Gums, the birds
travel from the topmost branches of one tree to those of another at a
considerable height. These flights, however, are of a short duration.
While in flight the call is generally employed.
The call of the Mallee Ringneck Parrot is a high pitched whistle
note repeated several times. A harsh call similar to that of the Platy-
cercus species is also heard. While feeding in the branches of trees a
chattering is often emitted.
Seeds of grasses and herbaceous plants form the main diet of this
species. Eucalyptus seeds and tips are also relished. In the western
areas of New South Wales and in South Australia the seeds of the
Paddy Melon ( Cucumis myriocarpus) and the Wild Bitter Melon ( Citrullus
lanatus ) are consumed in great quantities by the Mallee Ringneck
Parrot. The fruits of various shrubs such as the introduced tobacco
plant ( Nicotiana glauca ) are also eaten. B. barnardi does eat cultivated
fruits but, because of its reluctance to frequent habitated areas, is not
regarded as a pest. In winter the fruits of the Mallee Gums are chewed
to gain access to the seeds, while the flowers of these and the Sugar
Gums are readily eaten when available. There is an interesting record
of a Mallee Ringneck Parrot extending this fondness for flowers to
include cultivated violets and freesias with considerable damage being
the end result. Stomach and crops of B. barnardi examined in 1935 by
two Australian authorities revealed seeds of various grasses, seeds of
a Solanum sp., very small seeds of a Portulaceae , vegetable matter, grit
and sand, and pieces of charcoal. A stomach of a bird taken by
S. A. White in the Flinders Ranges in 1913 was entirely filled with
eucalyptus seeds. The crop of a B. b. macgillivrayi examined by
W. Macgillivray in 1914 contained various grass seeds. The crop of
B. b. augustus from Cobar examined by the author in 1962 contained
many very small brown beetle-like insects. As the crop also contained a
considerable quantity of sand it cannot be ascertained if these insects
were deliberately eaten by the bird or whether they were unknowingly
devoured with the sand.
As mentioned, this parrot is not plentiful in the neighbourhood of
cultivated farmlands and human habitation. In this way it differs from
the Platycercus sp. and does not appear to be able to adapt itself to
encroaching settlement. As the Mallee and open forest country are
cleared for wheat and sheep the Mallee Ringneck Parrot gradually
retreats. Although still generally considered numerous, it appears to
be declining in parts of its range. B. b. macgillivrayi is not the subject
of many reports owing to its isolation, but it does appear to be holding
its own well on the upper tributaries of the Diamantina River.

J. M. FORSHAW-THE PARROTS OF AUSTRALIA
The brilliant colour of the males is generally the strongest indication
of sex. Females and immatures are much duller than the adult males,
particularly on the back and rump, which are generally dark grey-
green in colour. This makes the birds easy to sex in the field especially
when observed in flight. The female also possesses a smaller head and
a narrow pointed upper mandible as in the Rosellas. The 45 wing-
stripe 55 is also a valuable aid, with the males losing it with their first
complete moult and the majority of females retaining it.
The close relationship to the Platycercus sp. is revealed by the mating
display, which is identical with that of the Rosellas. The male assumes
a slightly crouched position before the female and squares his shoulders
with slight vibrations. The tail is fanned a little and excitedly moved
from side to side with a constant chatter emitted. The head is occasion-
ally bobbed up and down. The mating period is often a time of
squabbling and fighting as lone males attempt to impress a mated
female. During the pre-nesting time B. barnardi becomes pugnacious
towards his own in a manner resembling all the other broadtails.
As August heralds in the breeding season, which is greatly governed
by climatic and environmental conditions, activity in the form of
seeking suitable nesting sites reaches its zenith. A hollow limb or hole
in the branch of a eucalypt is chosen and considerable time is spent
preparing the site for the laying of the eggs. Dead trees are generally
chosen but living gums along rivers and watercourses or by dams also
provide many suitable nests. The bottom of the hollow is lined with
decayed wood and a shallow excavation is made for the eggs.
If the season is favourable the breeding season commences in August
and often two broods will be reared. A dry period or a severe drought
restricts breeding and the birds may not go to nest until October or
November and indeed many will not nest at all.
Four to six, usually five, pure white eggs are laid. These are rounded
oval in shape and the texture of the shell varies from coarse to fine.
The eggs are slightly glossy but rapidly become dull and nest stained.
An average egg would have the measurements 1*2 by 0-97 inches.
Lendon (1940) describes the eggs of the Gloncurry Parrot as being
appreciably smaller than those of B. b. barnardi and being smooth, dull
white, and slightly larger at one end, the average measurements being
1 * 08 by 0*86 inches.
Incubation, which commences after the laying of the second egg, is
carried out only by the female and is of three weeks duration. During
this time she usually leaves the nest for short periods in the early
morning and in the evening to feed. The cock bird generally sits in a
nearby tree and warns of any approaching danger. The young are
born covered in white down and are carefully brooded by the hen for
the first few days. As the nestlings grow the male is allowed to assume
his share of the feeding duties. The nestling period lasts approximately

five weeks. On leaving the nest the young remain with their parents
thus accounting for the family parties usually observed.
Hybrids in the wild state with this species are very uncommon.
However, as discussed previously, mutations of various kinds are some-
times reported. There is a record of a pair of lutino birds taken from
a nest on the Murray River in 1927. These birds were of a pale yellow
colour with pink feet and eyes.
The Mallee Ringneck Parrot has generally been considered uncer-
tain as an aviary bird. Although it does not take to captivity as readily
as the Rosellas, reasonable care and attention should result in satis-
factory results with this species. New arrivals should be guarded against
chills, but once acclimatized it is a hardy species. Two characteristics
darken its popularity in captivity. It is very pugnacious towards other
species and it attacks wood with its strong bill reducing perches and
supports to splinters in a very short time. In spite of these disadvantages
it is a beautiful inhabitant of an aviary and its prowess as a whistler
endears it to many aviculturists.
The diet for birds in captivity should consist of sunflower seeds, oats,
wheat, plain canary seed, and millet in the proportions of 2 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 1,
while individual birds will relish corn. A plentiful supply of green food
must be made available at all times while apples, pears, and other
fruits are always appreciated. Many breeders have had considerable
success offering a limited supply of mealworms and this should be
experimented with by interested owners.
The successful breeding of this bird in Australia is not common. The
Cloncurry Parrot has, in recent years, been established in collections
in this country and it is to be hoped that this beautiful race proves to
be an exception with the species and that it increases substantially in
numbers. For breeding purposes a pair of Mallee Ringneck Parrots
should be housed separately in a flight, which is not in close proximity
to any aviary containing other broadtails. A number of nesting logs and
boxes should be provided so that the birds are able to choose their
nesting site. Once the birds have commenced breeding they should
be disturbed as little as possible. If a second brood appears likely the
young of the first nest should be taken from the parents as soon as
possible.
A number of hybrids between this species and other broadtails have
been recorded in captivity. The most note-worthy of these was the
breeding of a hybrid with the Red-backed Parrot (Psephotus haematonotus)
at London Zoo in 1933. The author recently examined skins in the
Australian Museum of a hybrid with the Yellow Rosella (Platycercus
flaveolus ) and, although there is a record of this hybrid occurring in the
wild state, it is almost certain that these skins were from captive birds.
The hybridization of the two members of the genus Barnardius in capti-
vity is comparatively common. There is a record of a hybridization

must be strongly questioned.
Renowned for its beauty, admired for its grace, the Mallee Ringneck
Parrot occupies a high position in the parrot group. When winging its
way through the Mallee areas of the Australian countryside, or when
flying in an outdoor flight it never fails to impress the observer. Truly,

PSITTACINE BIRDS IN CALIFORNIA

It has been many many years since there has been any mention of the
Mexican Thick-billed Parrot in the Magazine. Members may be
interested to know that there are several pairs here in California and
Arizona, although apparently the closely related Maroon-fronted
Parrot is totally unknown in captivity.
For many years the San Diego Zoo displayed three specimens of this
fine parrot, and from the writer's limited observation they appeared
to be a true pair and an odd bird. The brilliant yellow under the
wings shows up very clearly when they are in flight. I do not know if
these birds made any breeding attempt although nests were provided
should they be so inclined.
I have also seen a very tame and talking specimen which chattered
a great deal in a rather indistinct manner. This bird was very aggres-
sive but also very intelligent.
There appears to be no sexual distinctions and no apparent difference
in size between the sexes.
European members might enjoy hearing that there are some Blue
Fischer's Lovebirds here in California. I have two specimens which
were purchased from a local dealer who had obtained the birds from a
breeder who stated he had five or six more at home. The bird has a
whitish-grey head and the body is a pale sky blue. When seen next
to a Blue-masked it is readily clear that the bird is a true Fischer's
and not a cross between Fischer's and a Blue-masked.
Many years ago my father had a Blue Fischer's, and Bernard Roer
in Arizona also has had Blue Fischer's. They are not any prettier than
the Blue-masked Lovebird, which is a very handsome mutation.

Mr. Rudkin, Jr. in Fellmore continues to have very outstanding
breeding results with his lutino and blue Ringnecks. In 1961 he mated
a male lutino to a female blue and reared one green male split for
lutino and blue and one lutino female split for blue. These two
youngsters have now been paired up and have eggs this year.
In 1962 the lutino male and his mate bred four female lutinos, all
split for blue. Thus the groundwork has been laid for the eventual
rearing of an albino Ringneck.
Recently I was fortunate in securing six specimens of the Malaccan
Long-tailed Parrakeet. These are especially lovely, but the sexing of
them appears to be somewhat confusing. At first it was thought there
might be three pairs, but some of the females are now moulting and
are looking suspiciously masculine as the moult progresses. To date
they have made no noise, and appear to be a rather ill-tempered bird,
each of the six appearing to prefer to sit quite alone.
These birds have steadfastly refused to eat any fruit or greens, and
look wonderfully healthy on a diet of water and sunflower seed.
Sometimes one is disappointed when seeing a living specimen
previously known only from an artist's plate. However, the Long-tailed
is a truly beautiful and regal parrakeet and is far superior to the plate
in the old Reichenow work.
At about the same time the Long-tailed Parrakeets were obtained
a second pair of Slatey-headed Parrakeets were obtained. My original
pair are extremely handsome, and like most asiatic parrakeets get a
wonderful sheen to their plumage. The male's tail grows to a very
great length and the quiet but elegant colouration is most pleasing.
The Slatey-headed like all types of fruit and greens, and pay no
attention to other small birds in their aviary.
The original pair have been seen to mate and feed repeatedly during
the early spring months, but have never laid, and as far as I can tell,
have never entered any of the nest boxes provided. They are quiet,
and their call and display greatly resembles that of a Plum-head.
My own breeding results have been rather disappointing this year.
Neither the Grand, Red-sided or Solomon Island (dwarf form) were
successful, although a number of eggs were laid. Quite recently a
dealer here had an all red female Eelectus, presumably a Cardinal
Eelectus. From a study of skins it would appear that the colouration
of the females varies a great deal from locality to locality, while the
males all appear quite alike.
Mr. and Mrs. Miser of Stanton, California, are hand-feeding a three-
week old hybrid cockatoo, the result of a mating from a male Lead-
beater's and a female Umbrella. This should prove a most interesting
chick, and they are naturally quite elated over their success.

The weather has been just impossible in 1963. After a cold and
unusually long winter, came a dull, chilly spring, followed by a wet
summer without warmth. The result has been that regular breeding
pairs of tropical birds as, for instance, Rajah Shelducks and Orinoco
Geese, simply did not come into breeding condition and never laid.
Others only produced infertile eggs. It was even worse with doves
and small birds. Some obstinate nesters, however, did rear a few young.
There were a number of Rheas and one Stanley Crane, a few geese :
Ruddy-headed, Ashy-headed, Magellan, Cereopsis, Greenland White-
fronts, Blue and Lesser Snow Geese, also White-necked Swans.
Snow and Blue Geese, of which there are a dozen pairs or so in the
park, rear their own young at liberty. This year a blue pair had one
blue and two white goslings. They showed a curious behaviour this
season. Every year, a few young are reared under hens as well ; when
about two months old, these were released into the park, where they
joined the other Snow Geese and lived in peace with them. But this
time the park geese, for an unknown reason, would not tolerate the
young reared elsewhere and attacked them savagely, killing one before
they could be removed. A few more pairs of Snow Geese live in the
deer park, across the road. There are full-winged birds in both flocks,
but they never mix, and they would fight if they came into contact.
Yet Snow Geese belong to a gregarious, non-quarrelling species !
Two pairs of Nenes again laid two clutches each of infertile eggs,
a great disappointment. A good many ducks were reared, some by
their parents. There are many free-flying Carolinas, Mandarins,
Bahamas, Chilean Pintails, Shovelers, Garganeys and Green-winged
Teal on the lake and streams. Also Chiloe Wigeons, which are not
very good stayers in the spring, when pairs wander away in search of a
hidden territory where to nest ; so a few are lost. But, this year, a pair
returned in September with four young--others had been reared on
the lake and they all fly together. The most interesting ducklings were
Hawaiians (Koloa) now a very scarce species in its native islands,
probably fewer than 200 being left.
Among the game birds were several young Sonnerats and Ceylon
Junglefowl and a Brazilian Curassow. Seven day-old wild Turkey
chicks sent by Professor Ghigi, from Bologna, arrived in perfect con-
dition and were reared easily. They belong to the northern race
(silvestris ), taller and darker than the Florida Turkeys (osceola) I have
had so far.
The best doves reared this year were Common and Brush Bronze-
wings, many Green-winged, Grey-headed ( caniceps ), Grayson and
White-headed Pigeons, also three Crimson-winged and three Aymara

Parrakeets (Myiopsitta aymara). The latter were imported for the first
time a few years ago. They are small and pretty in shape and colours
(dark grey, pale grey, and green). Coming from the high barren plateaus
of the Southern Andes (Bolivia, northern Argentina, and Chile), they
are very hardy; they also have the great advantage of respecting
vegetation, and they do not damage the shrubs of their aviary to any
appreciable extent, a rare quality among parrakeets which Queen
Alexandras and Bourkes only share with them, as far as my experience
goes. Two pairs of Aymaras laid late in the summer in ordinary small
nesting boxes, one of them made of metal, hung under the roof of the
shelter. The young remained long in the nests, which became so dirty
that we had to clean them. They feed on seeds, but used a great deal
of softbill mixture when rearing their brood.
A pair of Schutti's Touracous laid infertile eggs three times.
We received many new birds this season, among which a pair of
West African Ostriches from the Paris (Vincennes) Zoo, where sixteen
were reared last year, twelve of them by the parents themselves, a rare
occurrence in a northern climate and a public park. Many Parrot
Finches, both Red-headed and Blue-headed, arrived from the New
Hebrides and New Caledonia, as well as two pairs of the diminutive
Polynesian Duck (Anas superciliosa pelervensis ), which does not seem to
have been imported before; it is considerably smaller than the
Australian form, and prettier.
I made last year a new duck garden across the road, where the rarer
species are kept in peace, away from visitors. It should prove successful
in breeding the more difficult birds. It also provides me with a welcome
haven. The tropical house is being restored, and the halls of the
chateau, destroyed by fire in 1939, have now been turned into indoor
aviaries, so that we shall have much more room for small and medium-
sized delicate birds.

Since opening the new Bird House and Pheasantry in December,
1962, the bird collection of the Berlin Zoo has been increased by a great
number of interesting new arrivals and donations and a lot of remark-
able breeding successes.
As a gift we received in January, 1963, a pair of Yellow-casque
Hornbills ( Ceratogymna elata) , a species from Western Africa, which is
seldom to be seen in Zoological Gardens. In the London Zoo a
specimen lived for more than thirteen years (Flower, 1925). In the
wild the fruit of the Oil Palm is the food these birds prefer, but in
captivity they have settled down well, living on a mixture of bananas,
oranges, apples, and rice with meat or freshly killed mice.
On 1 st May, 1963, for the first time a pair of the White-breasted
Guineafowl ( Agelastes meleagrides) arrived at the Berlin Zoo. It is
believed that this species, which inhabits the forests of Liberia and the
Gold Coast, has never before been in a European zoological garden.
The two birds were trapped by the Dutch animal importer Frans van
den Brink himself. Here they spend most of their time in the branches
of their cage and are fed on a diet very rich in insects. Although there
are no reports about their breeding biology in the wild, the Zoo hopes
that it will be possible to breed these rare and beautiful Wood-Guinea-
fowl in due time.
In July, a collection of birds from the New Hebrides arrived,
collected by Mr. Bregulla, including two Red-bellied Fruit Doves
[Ptilinopus greyii) , two Sacred Kingfishers [Halcyon saneta) , two Chestnut-
bellied Kingfishers ( Halcyon farquhari ), and two Red-headed Parrot
Finches [Erythrura psittacea). Ptilinopus greyii is like any Ptilinopus , in
habits, but perhaps more apt to fly from one island to another, so that
it has been reported from New Caledonia, Loyalty Isles, New Hebrides,
Banks, Torres, Santa Cruz, Reef Isles, and Gower Isle. Though
Halcyon sancta is quite widespread and common in the New Guinea
region, Halcyon farquhari is a more local, rare species, known only from
the isles Malekula, Malo, and Santo.
Other arrivals worth mentioning include two flightless Steamer
Ducks from the Falkland Islands, one Ross's Goose, ten Lesser
Flamingos, two of the carnivorous Weka Rails from New Zealand, two

Giant Cazique, one Great Himalayan Barbet, one Guiana Motmot,
two Peruvian Cocks of the Rock, two Quetzals, and two each of the
Speckled, the Blue-naped, and the Red-faced Mousebird.
On 20th February, 1963, the male Japanese Stork (Ciconia ciconia
boyciana ), one of the rarest birds in the Berlin Zoo, died of senility.
Acquired from Hagenbeck, Hamburg, on 23rd June, 1933, the
Japanese Stork was one of the ninety-one animals, which had survived
World War II in the Berlin Zoo, in the end being the oldest zoo
inhabitant of all. In Japan this sub-species is nearly extinct in the wild.
Only eleven specimens are left, and they have not been propagated
in 1962. In the Berlin Zoo the Japanese Stork lived together with a
female European White Stork. Once the pair nested, but the eggs did
not develop.
The hatching and raising of a young European Flamingo, the first
one ever bred in a German Zoo, was the most welcome breeding
success of this season. The flamingo colony, consisting of fifty-six
birds, is living isolated from the zoo visitors on a small peninsula in a
lagoon with a regulated water level, where a load of mud had been
brought this spring. After years of experimenting to find out the best
breeding conditions, this time at last the flamingos, European as well
as Chilean, punctually began to build their nest hills. On 16th May,
the first egg was laid, followed by four others. Four pairs of the
European and one pair of the Chilean sub-species were sitting on the
eggs persistently. On 25th June, the European Flamingo egg, laid on
25th May, hatched.
The strong chick left its nest on the third day and was fed not
only by its parents, but also by others standing near. Being now more
than six weeks old the young flamingo has grown considerably. The
other eggs remained undeveloped.
The waterfowl collection of the Berlin Zoo was increased by a great
number of breedings, among which those of three Bar-headed Geese,
five Blue Geese, two Common Shelducks, a Cereopsis Goose, five
Emperor Geese, three Black-necked Swans, four European Eiders, and
a Common Cormorant are noteworthy.
Furthermore a Black-footed and a Humboldt's Penguin, two
European White Storks, three Hill Mynas, and a Great Crowned
Pigeon were hatched in the Gardens.
Repeating the breeding success of last year the Snowy Owls hatched
and raised three young ones. The Giant Eagle-Owls have two young
ones. Three young Black Vultures, taken away from their parents,
have been raised by hand with pre-digested food by our head keeper,
Mrs. Johst, who is also raising just now a young Paradise Crane,
hatched on 16th July.

A fine specimen of Fischer's Whydah, a male in full breeding
plumage, has been presented by Messrs G. H, and J. R. Newmark and
is the first of this species to be in the collection. Fischer's or the Straw-
tailed Whydah ( Vidua fischeri) inhabits the thorn bush country of parts
of eastern Africa. It is said to be brood parasitic mainly on the Purple
Grenadier Waxbill, but, as Dr. Friedmann points out (Bull. U.S. Nat.
Mus., 223, i960) the host species are not known with certainty.
Another new species is the Black-faced Solitaire ( Myadestes melanops),
a native of Costa Rica.
Other arrivals of particular interest are a Booted Eagle (an immature
bird of the light phase), two Lesser Kestrels, a Spoonbill, a pair each
of White-eye or Ferruginous Ducks, Garganey Teal and Chilean Pin-
tail, two Gull-billed Terns, a pair of Painted Quail, a pair of the
Straight-crested Helmet-Shrikes ( Prionops plumata poliocephala) , a pair
of Red-crowned Tanagers ( Tachyphonus coronatus ), a pair of Red-eared
(or whiskered) Bulbuls, White-crested and Necklaced Jay Thrushes,
a Yellow-backed Whydah, a Peters' Twinspot and a pair of Blue-headed
Waxbills.
One Barn Owl was reared, the first to be bred here since 1905. Two
Blue-headed Parrots presented in March after being in the donor's
possession for ten years, are very unlike the typical birds, being smaller
and more slim, of a paler blue with paler ear-coverts and no trace of red
on the throat. They may be what Massena and Souance called Pionus
cobaltinus and although the original description mentions a red front,
the Type may presumably have been an immature bird. " P. cobaltinus "

In 1835, Major (later Sir) Thomas Livingstone Mitchell built a
stockade near the junction of the Darling and Bogan Rivers, in New
South Wales : this he named Fort Bourke after the then Governor,
Sir Richard Bourke. It was near here that he found the charming
parrakeet subsequently known as the Bourke, in 1838.
Until within the last thirty or so years " Back o' Bourke " was under-
stood to indicate utter remoteness. Now Bourke is a mere two air-hours

that he has little time for writing of the interesting events in his aviaries.
It may therefore not be out of place to report that his young Patagonian
Gonures have now left the nest. The three young birds are exact
replicas of the parents except that they have white upper mandibles,
whereas the adults have black. An unusual cock Bourke has been bred ;
it has red eyes, very pale body feathers, and the wings are suffused with
yellow. Two Rothschild's Grackles have been reared, also about forty
Vulturine Guineafowl.

A. W. Bolton is busy stocking his new 63 by 18 feet aviary. This
enclosure contains two small ponds and a waterfall, and will eventually
contain a large and varied collection. Breeding results this past season
have not been particularly good but some nice birds have been reared.
Redrumps had three in their first nest (one normal hen, one yellow hen
and one possibly split cock) and six in the second (three yellow hens
and three possibly split cocks). The surprising thing about this

breeding pair is that the normal hen was five years old, but the cock
was only eleven months old. Golden-mantled Rosellas had two young
but refused to feed them. Cockatiels laid large clutches of eggs but the
cock birds failed to do their share of sitting and only two young ones
were reared. Hahn's Macaws, one pair reared two good young ones,
and a second pair had young dead in shell. The Rock Pebblers had
clear eggs.

Further to my notes in the May-June number of the Magazine on
the longevity of pheasants. Search has revealed a few further records:--
Reeves&apos;s Pheasant. P. J. Lambert ( Avicult. Mag., 1936, p. 14) says :
" I personally know of a Reeves cock that was hatched before the
Great War and is still healthy and happy--its tail length exceeds
5 feet." This would make it over 21 years old.
Golden Pheasant. P. J. Lambert (loc. cit.) : " I know of a Golden cock
in the North of England that is over 20 years old
Silver X Reeves&apos;s Pheasant. Major S. S. Flower, " Further Notes on
the Duration of Life in Animals--iv. Birds " (Proc. #ool. Soc. London ,
Ser. A, vol. 108, p. 226, 1938) cites: "Hybrid Silver X Reeves's
Pheasants in the Sofia Z.G., one that lived for 20 years, and one still
living at 20 years, have been recorded (Adolf Schumann, Mitt. Kon.
Naturwiss. Inst. Sofia, 2 , 1929, p. 52)."
Argus Pheasant. Major Flower (loc. cit., p. 227), " London, $, pre-
sented 22nd May, 1922, living 2nd October, 1937, 15 years 4 months
10 days. At Cleres, in France, Monsieur J. Delacour, F.Z.S., has had
both male and female Crested Argus Pheasant living for about the same
period as the London maximum."
Major Flower also lists : " Twenty Silver Pheasants , genus Gennaeus,
average 12 years iof months ; 5, of the 20, left alive. Of all the genera
of pheasants Gennaeus appears to be the hardiest in captivity.

THE BIRDS. By Roger Tory Peterson and the Editors of Life.
Time Inc., New York, U.S.A., 1963, Price $3-95.
This book deals with all aspects of bird life, starting with the evolu-
tion of birds and finishing with a discussion of the inter-relationships
of birds and humans.
The author writes in his usual clear and easy style that the veriest
beginner will find both interesting and understandable but which
never sacrifices accuracy for the sake of popular appeal. Even know-
ledgeable ornithologists, or those who like so to consider themselves,
may learn from this book and will certainly appreciate the amount of
research and study the author must have gone to in order to get all his
facts right.
The book is very profusely illustrated with both black and white and
coloured drawings by the author, who is, of course, one of the world's
leading bird artists. Also by a great number of photographs, many of
them in colour. The illustrations do not only beautify the book, but
most of them serve to illustrate or emphasize some point in the text and
do this very effectively. A Santa Cruz islander catching honey-eaters ;
Glaucous-winged Gulls waiting for scraps around two feeding bears ;
close-up colour photographs of the eyes of six different species and a
Skimmer skimming are but four pictures that can be singled out here
from among a multitude of equal interest and merit.
No doubt specialists will be able to find, or imagine, a fault here or
there. The reviewer, for example, thought that the generalizations on
behaviour were perhaps a shade too emphatic and wished that the
author could have given us some observations and examples from his
personal experiences instead of all the standard ones. Probably,
however, the reviewer is biased here by his past enjoyment of the
author's " Wings over America ", in which many interesting personal
anecdotes are given, and by familiarity with most of the classical
examples of bird behaviour.
The book can be unhesitatingly recommended to anyone interested
in birds regardless of how much or how little they know.

of this may irritate some who are well advanced in aviculture or
ornithology, they should remember that such an approach is very
likely to capture and hold the attention of anyone who is just beginning
to take an interest in birds.
Frankly, the reviewer was prejudiced by both title and dust-jacket
(a lurid pink) and started reading fully prepared and expecting not
to like the book. He ended it with his prejudice gone and quite a high
opinion of it. The book is largely a compilation but a careful and pains-
taking one, and the author quotes his sources of information wherever
these are not common knowledge in ornithological circles. There are
one or two errors (as in many books) but most of the information is
correct.
The book is illustrated with eight plates of photographs and very
many black and white drawings. These vary in quality but most are
competent and effective. The all too human face of the Frogmouth on
page 45 makes this drawing (regardless of its ornithological merits)
more than worth the price of the book.

A WARNING--THE DANGER OF TOXIC CHEMICAL SPRAYING TO

First I have a " Tale of Woe " to unfold. I was building up quite a nice little
flock of Parrot Finches and had them breeding nicely. They are very fond of seeding
grass--especially when breeding--I generally go out to the Bush to get this--but I have
been very busy and was unable to drive far. I knew where there was a small patch in
an outer suburb. So I drove over and collected it. As I got out of the car a small flock
of Diamond Sparrows flew off it. I collected a double handful of the grass and took
it home to the Parrot Finches--next morning all the Parrot Finches were sick. I drove
over immediately to look if the grass was all right, and found it had been sprayed--it
seems it takes three days from the time the spray is put on for the grass to wither--
when I picked it, it looked perfect. Otherwise, of course, I wouldn't have touched it.
Well, to cut a long story short, I lost nine coloured Reds--two nests of young Reds,
one of three and one of four--one Blue ( Trinchiva) and two Fiji's ( Paelae ). It really
is a great blow--as they cannot be replaced--especially the Fiji's I am afraid ; I
only have three of these left and they are all cocks.
Have you got criminal lunatics in England spreading poison far and wide like
we have ?--if so, it is not safe to touch any grass unless you grow it yourself. The
Municipal Council does it here--Poison, I mean. No doubt those Diamond Sparrows
I saw are all dead now. These birds are strictly protected--there is a heavy penalty
for catching one, however, it is quite all right to poison them, it seems ! The grass
was the kind called " Summer " grass. All the small seed eaters--Diamonds, Sydney
Waxbills, Double Bars, etc. love it--it is their main food during late summer.

RECORDING THE VOICES OF CAPTIVE BIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.993582055555556" page_id="56350369"  page_num="261" year="" vol="">
In response to my request in a paper under the above title ( Avicult . Mag., 69, 3,
122) for details of additional commercial gramophone records of the voices of captive
birds, Mr. Allen Silver has kindly drawn my attention to two records on which bird
song recorded in the famous Bremen aviary of Karl Reich is mixed with human
instrumental music.
These, therefore, need to be added to the list under the side heading " Germany "
on p. 123 (op. cit.). The details are :
Reich, Karl (c . 1925). " Nachtigall und Schwarzdrossel singen zur Hochzeit "
and " Sang der Nachtigall-Edelkanarien ". One 10-inch, 78 r.p.m. disc, no. E.G.

Reich, Karl (c . 1925). " Volkslieder-dreistimmig, harmonisch umsungen von
Nachtigall-Edelkanarien der Zucht ". One 10-inch, 78 r.p.m. disc, no. E.G. 855.
Electrola, Germany.
Also, Miss Valentine Britten has kindly traced a copy of the disc of which I had only
limited information (p. 124 op. cit.). It too turns out to be of Karl Reich origin. The
details are :
Reich, Karl (pre. 1923). " Actual Bird Record made by Captive Thrush " and
on the other side " Captive Blackbird ". Both are " The property of Herr Karl

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975093485714286" page_id="56350377"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Mr. P. H. Hastings, the proprietor of the above firm, has
been medically advised to retire. This very progressive
business is therefore up for sale as a going concern, prefer-
ably as a whole, or will be split in two separate businesses
if required.
The business comprises two freehold properties. The
main building, newly rebuilt, is acknowledged the finest
of its kind in the world, specially designed after long
experience, by the owner, for tropical birds.
The food manufacture is of the exclusive " STIMULITE "
Foods which have been acknowledged, for over forty years,
the leading foods of their kind in the whole world, and they
are indeed exported to every corner of the earth.
" STIMULITE " Nectar Paste has the largest sale of any
Bird Food in the universe.
Mr. Hastings is well known to most experienced fanciers
and exhibitors, for his position in obtaining and supplying
to collectors and zoos the very rarest of birds. He was the
very first dealer to handle Humming Birds which he first
imported about 1926, and of which he has been the leading
dealer in the world.
Such a business has a unique position in aviculture as
there are no foods anywhere that can claim such practical
experience behind them.
Naturally, as the above has been Mr. Hastings' life's
work, he wishes the business to expand and keep the eminent
position in aviculture to which he has brought it.
It offers exceptional prospects for a company take-over,
or for a group of business men and fanciers to invest in.
In the event of purchase, Mr. Hastings will offer his
services at a minimum retainer, to teach the buyers the
complete management and manufacture, for up to
twelve months.
The price required is #22,000, at which it represents the
year's biggest bargain. For fuller particulars apply--
