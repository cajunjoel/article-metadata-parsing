The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2\ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

THE PRESERVATION IN CAPTIVITY OF
CHINESE PHEASANTS
By J. Delacour
PRESIDENT OF THE ORNAMENTAL PHEASANT SOCIETY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99889955" page_id="56314181"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
It is commonplace to state that, owing to the vast and increasing
population and the unrest and lawlessness in China, her marvellous
Pheasants are threatened with extinction in a wild state.
Before 1914, the two Chinese species of Tragopans, Temminck's
and Cabot's, were well established in European aviaries, particularly
in France where they had been successfully bred generation after
generation for over fifty years. Each season several dozens were
reared, often by small amateurs who only kept a few pairs of
Pheasants. Temminck's sold for #10 a pair, Cabot's for # 6, and
both could be easily obtained. The Indian Satyrs were shyer
breeders, and their price was up to #20 a pair.
Owing mostly to lack of organization, the stock was allowed
to dwindle down during the last war, so that, at the end of 1918,
there were hardly any left, except one pair of Cabot's which I had
given to the late Mr. Hubert Astley in Herefordshire, and a pair
of Temminck's entrusted to the late M. de Sainville in Solugne
(Central France).
A very few young were reared in 1919 and 1920. They were
weak through in-breeding, and I could hardly manage to have
a pair or two of these beautiful birds in my pheasantry up to a few

years ago, when new blood was introduced, mostly thanks to the
efforts of Messrs. Floyd Smith and Hampe. Even now, Cabot's are
not plentiful with us, although there are a number in America.
Temminck's, which still are very scarce now in the New World,
are more numerous in England, Belgium, and France. We
reared at Cleres this last season, nine cocks and seven hens. In fact,
it is perhaps the freest breeder of the genus, the strongest, and the
most beautiful. Incidentally, I advise aviculturists not to mix
Temminck's chicks with those of other species. Although small
they are more active and less delicate, and somehow the others
suffer till one finds that there are only Temminck's left in the pen.
The tragedy of the disappearance of these fine Tragopans
must be avoided this time, as well as that of other Chinese Pheasants
such as Crossoptilons, Blue and Brown, Elliots, which had also
almost disappeared in 1918 (fortunately there were some at liberty
at Woburn and the Duke of Bedford kindly sent me some of their
eggs in 1920) and even the commoner Reeves, Goldens, and
Amhersts ; adequate stock of which ought to be preserved.
The less threatened Malaysian, Indo-Chinese, Japanese,
Burmese, and Indian Pheasants are also well worth preserving.
One must not forget how difficult and costly it has been to procure
Blyth's Tragopans, Koklass, Imperial, Edwards, Copper Pheasants,
Ceylon Junglefowls, Palawan and Bronze-tailed Polyplectrons,
Bulwers, Rheinarts, etc.
I suggest that any member or breeder who owns some of the
better Pheasants and for some reason has to part with them,
gets into touch with either the O.P.S. or the Avicultural Society,
so that his precious birds can be saved by others, more fortunate,
who can endeavour to see them safely throughout the present war.

In these troublous days it is a great relief to visit a collection
such as that at Foxwarren Park, and to find that it is as fine or
finer than ever, and that Mr. Ezra intends to do his utmost to
maintain it as long as he possibly can.
The collection of rarities in the bird room is just as splendid
as ever, and so are the Humming Birds in their warmed house
where one at least, a Garnet-throated ( Eulampis jugularis) has
lived for five years which is, I think, a record. One particular
favourite is an Australian Spine-bill Honeyeater (Acauthorhynchus
tenuirostris) which lives in a cage in Mr. Ezra's bedroom, where
I was taken to see it. It welcomed its owner on his approach,
for it knew well that it would be allowed the treat of an excursion
round the room after flies of which it is an expert catcher, and
as soon as the cage door was opened it exhibited its skill in this
direction. In a flash it was out and had captured a fly on the
window, but almost before we could realize what was happening
it was back in its cage manipulating its prey into a convenient
position for swallowing it. Then out it came again and, shooting
into the air, gave a click of its bill, and another fly was caught.
Meanwhile Mr. Ezra had filled the wash-hand basin with water
and, having devoured several flies, always after returning to its
cage, the Spine-bill flew to the basin and commenced to dash
in and out of the water, although it had already bathed that
morning. After its bath it flew straight back to its cage.
The aviaries contain a varied and wonderful collection that
would take a very long time to describe, but I should like to say
something about the Parrakeets.
The Queen Alexandra ( Northipsitta alexandrae) has always been
regarded as a gem in any collection, but here there are no less
than fourteen, all of which, with the exception of the original
pair, have been bred at Foxwarren.
The young of this year also include four Crimson-wings
(.Aprosmictus erythropterus ) looking very fine with their parents, two
Malabar ( Psittacula peristerodes) , a fine blue Alexandrine ( P . nipal-
ensis ), a whole flock of lutino and lutino-bred Ringnecks (P. manil-

lensis), and a hybrid Turquoisine X Elegant (, JVeophema pulchella X
N. elegans).
One Barraband egg was placed in the nest of the Crimson-
wings and a young bird hatched and reared with them.
Of the larger Parrots the Guilding's ( Amazona guildingi) had a
nest and the female sat well, but the eggs were infertile, but a
pair of Leadbeater Cockatoos ( Cacatua leadheateri ) hatched and
reared three beautiful birds.
In a small aviary I noticed a pair of the very rare Musschen-
broek's Lorikeets ( JVeopsittacus musschenbroeki) , a recent acquisition
from north-west New Guinea. They are very pretty red-breasted
Lorikeets which, Mr. Ezra tells me, feed entirely upon seed. They
are doing very well, and I hope may one day add to the wonderful
breeding record of the collection.
Of the Cranes, the Manchurians laid and sat well, but without
result. White-necked are the best breeders of all and hatched
and reared a fine pair of young, one of which, when quite big,
managed to jump or fly over the fence, to be killed by a neigh-
bouring pair of Stanleys which themselves reared two young.
Sarus and Demoiselle each reared one young.
The Park is perhaps the most interesting part of this superb
place, and on the day of my visit was looking particularly lovely
in its autumn tints. Wallabies of which there are at least forty,
Bennett's and Daimas, sat about close to our path, hardly deigning
to move as we approached. Geese, Ducks, and Sheld-ducks
covered and surrounded the upper pond. Bar-headed Geese
which breed there every year now number fourteen head. There
are also thirteen Red-breasted Geese, which, so far, have not
bred, but five of the charming Ross's Snow and two Ashy-headed
Geese have been reared this year as have four Paradise Sheld-
ducks and three Black-necked Swans. I also noticed three strange-
looking hybrid Geese, which I was told were from a mating of a
Barnacle gander with a Snow Goose.
The lower duck ponds contain a rare variety of species, including
several of considerable rarity. The Indian Cotton Teal thrives
here as nowhere else in the country, and so does the extraordinary
White-backed Madagascar Duck ( Thalassornis insularis) which
first bred here some few years ago, and has reared five young
again in 1939.

Fulvous Tree Ducks breed very freely here, having reared
over sixty young this year.
The herd of Black Buck here are magnificent, and the males
have fine heads. They started in a small way with three or four
animals and now number forty-five, but this is not more extra-
ordinary than the increase of the Axis Deer in an adjoining paddock.
One pair of these came some ten or twelve years ago, but the
stag broke a leg and had to be shot. The hind, however, pro-
duced a fawn which was a male, and from these two a herd of
about forty magnificent animals has arisen.
Several attempts have been made in years gone by to establish
the Mandarin Duck of China and the American Carolina Duck,
the two most beautiful Ducks in the world, as wild breeding birds
in this country. I remember how Mr. Meade-Waldo kept
Mandarins on a pond in his woods at Stonewall Park and allowed
the ducklings to go free. A large number were bred, and no
doubt partially established themselves in the neighbourhood.
But it is doubtful whether either of these two species has succeeded
so well in the past as they are doing at the present time at Fox-
warren, where Mr. Ezra breeds large numbers every year.
He had asked Jones, his keeper of the Waterfowl, to go into
the Duck enclosures and put up the full-winged Mandarins and
Carolinas, all of which have been bred there or in the barrels
that are fixed up in the surrounding trees. As Jones entered the
first enclosure the Ducks began to fly out in ones and twos, then
in half-dozens, until there were perhaps fifty in the sky ; but there
were many more in the second pond, and I was asked to go to
the farther end and watch while the keeper went in. The birds
soon began to rise into the air, not in twos or threes, but in dozens,
Mandarins predominating, and soon there were some half-dozen
large flocks in the air flying in formation, each bunch consisting
of perhaps twenty or thirty birds. It was impossible to count
them accurately, but we both estimated the number in the sky
to be about two hundred, in mixed flocks of Mandarins and
Carolinas.
Both of these are woodland Ducks, normally breeding in
hollow trees, often at a considerable height from the ground.
The&apos;wooded country of this district in Surrey, containing numerous
ponds and lakes, is ideal for these two species which now are

often seen on Virginia Water, Wisley Lake, Silvermere and
many smaller pieces of water, not to mention the River Wey, and
there is no doubt that they are becoming well established as
British breeding birds, and a very desirable addition to our avifauna.
As just remarked, both of these birds are tree breeders, and
the question has often been asked as to how the young birds reach
the ground. Fantastic stories have been told of the method
adopted by the parent Duck in conveying them, either in her bill
or on her back, to terra firma. The fact is, of course, that these
small fluffy balls simply tumble down without sustaining the
slightest injury from whatever height they may fall, but their
exit from the nesting hole has very seldom been observed. I was
therefore very interested to hear that Mr. Jones has actually
witnessed it on more than one occasion. He pointed out to me
a nesting barrel fixed in the fork of an oak tree some twenty-five feet
from the ground. Early one morning in June he heard the Mandarin
Duck calling loudly and, keeping quite still and watching care-
fully, he saw her take up her position on a branch some two or three
feet away from the entrance to the nest and continue to call the
ducklings out. Presently one ran out on to a branch, overbalanced,
and fell to the ground. Then others appeared and did likewise,
while their mother kept at her selected position and continued
to call.
In a short time the whole brood had come out and toppled
to the ground, none of them being any the worse for their fall.
They huddled together in a bunch until their mother, after satisfying
herself that there were no more left in the nest, joined them and
conducted them to the water.
Mr. Jones believes that at least fifty Mandarins and Carolinas
have been bred at Foxwarren during 1939, and that there are
at least two hundred full-winged birds on the ponds at present,
which is about the number we saw in the air.
As we walked uphill from the lower duck-ponds we passed a
group of eight very beautiful Crested Forest Guinea-fowl {Guttera
pucherani) which are particularly attractive birds in their rich
blue-spotted coats and bare blue and red faces. They always
keep amongst the trees as is their habit, and in the spring make
nests in the bracken. They were somewhat molested last summer
by the Blue Crossoptilons but managed to rear one chick.

Nearer the house we walked through a covey of tame though
full-winged Ghukor Partridges which, later in the afternoon,
assembled on the lawn prior to flying up on to the roof of the house
where they roost undisturbed. This is another species that really
thrives on the light soil of this neighbourhood. Many broods
have been reared this year, and any morning or evening one may
count half a hundred on the lawn where they associate with Silver

It will interest members to know that I still have two Humming
Birds which are in perfect condition after four and a half years.
One is a hen of the Racket-tailed Humming Bird ( Discwra longicauda )
and the other the "Garnet Throated" ( Eulampis jugularis).
Although the " Racket tail " is beginning to show signs of old age,
the " Garnet Throated " has just moulted out, and looks more
beautiful than ever.
A very interesting pair of birds I got from our best collector,
Mr. Shaw Mayer, are doing well, and with luck should breed
next year. They are a pair of Musschenbroek's Parrot ( JVeopsittacus
musschenbroeki) from New Guinea, and are the first to be imported
to this country. These birds are the size of a Layard's Parrakeet.
General colouring : Head, green, slightly tinged with yellow ;
cheeks, greenish yellow ; throat, dull yellow ; breast and belly,
bright red ; back, green ; wings when closed are green, but
when in flight a large red patch is noticeable, reminding one of
the Touracou's wing. Under wing is red-edged with black tail ;
above green undertail is a blending of green, yellow, and red ;
beak, yellow ; legs and feet, slaty grey. They are beautiful birds,
and do well on only canary seed.
I have had a very successful year with most of my birds in
the animal enclosure and in the garden. The following Cranes
were successfully reared : Two white-necked--one Sarus--one
Stanley and one Demoiselle. Two pairs of Stanleys had six
young ones between them, but as my keeper was ill most of the
summer, these birds were neglected, and only one young one
was reared. One pair of Sarus had two nests, hatching off two
young ones each time, but only one young one was reared. Man-
churian Cranes laid, but their eggs were infertile. In the garden
we counted fifty young Chukor Partridges and most of these
were reared, and can always be seen in the garden by the house.
In the evenings they come round the house, and all fly to the top
of the house to roost every night. The full-winged Mandarins
and Garolinas have done very well, and nearly two hundred of
them are seen on the ponds, or flying about. About fifty of these

young last year unfortunately got into the bad habit of eating
their eggs as soon as each one was laid. One egg, however,
was saved, and this was placed in the nest of another pair that
had infertile eggs. This egg was duly hatched, and a fine young
one reared. Another pair laid four eggs, and three young were
hatched, but the parents would not feed them, and all three died
when only two days old.
Four young that were bred here and kept together in one
small aviary were given two nest boxes. Several eggs were laid,
but only one young one was reared.
Crimson Wings.-- These laid four eggs, and one egg belonging
to a pair of Barrabands was added to the nest. Five hatched
out, out of which four were reared. Three Crimson Wings and
the fourth a Barraband.
Malabars. --This pair laid three eggs, and two of these were
hatched and reared. These Malabars are wonderful parents,
and every year rear a good many young.
Barrabands. --This pair is always most disappointing. Every
year they hatch out several young, and after feeding them for
several days, they suddenly turn on their young and kill them.
The only young one reared from this pair this year was reared by
the Crimson Wings, their foster parents.

(Continued from November, 1939, p. 351)
The Black and White Fantail is affectionately known in
Australia as " Willy-Wagtail ", though he in no way resembles
the Wagtails of Europe, in fact compared with him our birds appear
very dull and lethargic creatures. " Willy-Wagtail " has the
most extraordinary demeanour, it seems in a continual state of
falling over, almost as though it were drunk or trying to hold on
to a branch in a violent hurricane. Its body is rocked from side
to side, it seems almost to fall off from its perch, it indulges in a
strange rowing motion of the body, and all the while the large
black fan-shaped tail is spread at right angles to the body and
swayed about as though it were only very loosely attached to
the body.
The Fantail is extremely familiar, living about farmsteads and
sheep stations, usually in the vicinity of water. It takes up its stand
near the water's edge and goes through its extraordinary antics
in its efforts to catch flies. It is a very striking bird of jet black
and white plumage. The vernacular name of its near relative,
Seisure inquieta , or the Restless Flycatcher, would be much more
suitable to this bird. I did see specimens of that bird, and it is not
nearly so restless as is the former.
I had the good fortune on my last day in Melbourne to be taken
by a friend to see what is probably the rarest of the Australian
Honey-eaters, and possibly the rarest of all Australian birds, the
beautiful Helmeted Honey-eater. This bird is known from only
two very restricted localities, areas in Victoria within two miles of
each other. The birds never move far from their local habitat which
is no more than half a square mile in area, unless by reason of
some exceptional occurrence such as the cutting down of the timber
or a forest fire. Sad to relate, at the very time I was observing the
birds, a fire was sweeping through their home, and the sickening
crackling of the burning timber was heard as I stood, binoculars
in hand, watching a bird not a hundred yards from the flames.
All around had been fires, and fallen and burning trees were on
every hand. How heart-breaking to the naturalist to think that

a superb race of birds which had taken hundreds of thousands
of years to evolve and perfect itself, should, by the thoughtlessness
of a passing picnicker or carelessness of a farm hand, be jeopardized
for posterity. Fire is a terrible problem in Australia, especially
in the forest districts. Every year thousands of areas of forest and
scrub are destroyed by fire either started deliberately by the
farmers so that they can get fresh grass, or else by campers or
picnickers leaving fires. One may sail along the coast for hundreds
of miles and see nothing but hills and mountains covered with
blackened poles ... all that remains after the fires had swept
through, of what were once magnificent forests.
The colony of these birds under observation was at Woori-
yallock Greek, about twenty-six miles from Melbourne in a farming
district. The birds live in a small patch of " White Gums They
have never been known to live away from these trees, which are
marsh loving and do not grow away from rivers or marshy places.
The birds were known from three other colonies, but one has
been eradicated through the cutting down of the timber and
recently the birds have not been observed in the other two. The
nest of this Honey-eater is placed very low down, only a foot or
two above the ground in the low dense herbage. In the colony at
Woori-yallock there would be, at a rough guess, perhaps fifty
pairs of birds. The exact habitat of this bird is known only to a
few naturalists, and there is little chance of the bird being exter-
minated except by bush fires. It is one of the brightest coloured
of the Honey-eaters, and from a distance appears a bright yellow
with two conspicuous plumes on the side of the head. It feeds
mainly upon insects and nectar.
The Bell Minor is a very peculiar bird, and is not related to the
Mynahs but is allied to the Honey-eaters which it resembles in
appearance. It is found in small colonies in the heavily forested
districts, and it seldom wanders from its limited habitat. The noise,
when one is near one of these colonies, is strangely reminiscent
of a field of crickets chirping ; sometimes the noise made by a
colony will sound like the tinkling of hundreds of tiny bells. It is
a most peculiar sound and one might imagine pixies striking on
hundreds of tiny anvils. I could never quite get used to this sound,
it always used to amaze me every time I heard it. The first time
I came upon a colony I searched everywhere for the insects which

I thought were making this strange noise, for, although the birds
were so active and continually flying to and fro, one didn't seem
to associate them with the noise. The birds are always searching
with avidity the leaves of the trees for insects upon which they
feed, and one wonders how such a small area in which the birds
reside can support such a number. When once a colony is
established it seldom moves far from the restricted spot except
if driven out by a forest fire or timber felling.
The large and conspicuous Wattled Honey-eater is found
around the clearings in the heavily forested country. It is noticeable
for the peculiar wattles which hang like bright red pearls from
just below the ears. I have often watched these large birds behaving
in the manner of a Flycatcher and procuring flying insects on the
wing. In flight it looks remarkably like a small Hornbill. This
bird has a series of very peculiar harsh notes which it utters as it
flies from one tree to another.
The food of the Wattled Honey-eater is mainly the honey
and flowers of the large forest trees and also insects. The beautiful
little Spine-billed Honey-eater was a frequent visitor to the flowers
around the house in the forest, where it used to pass with rapidity
from one flowering bush to another. It was particularly fond of
the Buddlia, as in fact, most Honey-eaters are. It is a small bird
and in its demeanour resembles a Sunbird.
The Yellow-faced Honey-eater is a small and rather sombrely
coloured bird, common in the mountainous districts of Victoria.
It is often found around the homesteads, but is reckoned a nuisance
owing to its liking for cultivated fruits. I only met with this species
near Healsville.
The renowned Coachwhip-bird is far oftener heard than seen,
for it inhabits the dense undergrowth in the forested regions, and
is not fond of showing itself. Occasionally if one sits quietly in
the forest it is possible to get a glimpse of this bird, as it grubs
about in the loose forest debris in much the same manner as the
familiar Blackbird. Its peculiar call exactly resembles the loud
crack of a whip, hence its name. Although most Australians, at
least the country dwellers, know its familiar call, very few know
it by sight. As soon as the bird has uttered the whip call the
female also utters two loud notes.

or less open lands partly covered with " tea tree 55 and sword-grass.
Though recorded as an exceedingly tame and confiding species,
I found it most difficult to observe. It is a large and fairly brightly
coloured species.
The lovely Golden Whistler, like the Coachwhip-bird, is more
often heard than seen, and as one moves through the forest its rich
melodious notes can be heard issuing from the thick forest under-
growth. It finds its food, which consists of insects and berries,
amongst the leaves of the forest undergrowth. I often used to see
and admire it in the forest on Mount Monda. In colour it is
bright olive green on the wings and tail, with a black head and *
nape, a white throat and below this a black band meeting the nape,
a collar on the back of the nape and the whole underparts are
brilliant golden yellow. Truly one of the most lovely of the forest
haunting birds.
The beautiful little Yellow Robin is familiar to those frequenting
the dense forest ranges of the Great Divide. It is an unobtrusive
little bird, flitting into the line of vision for a few seconds, hanging
on to a branch or trunk of a tree to get a look at one then diving
back into the undergrowth again. Its nest is very un-Robin-like,
and is a tiny compact structure built around the fork of a slender
sapling only a few feet from the ground and made of mosses
and fine hair bound together with cobwebs. It is a most delightful
little bird, beautifully, yet chastely coloured, and reminded me of
the tame Black Robins of the Little Barrier Island.
The Flame-breasted Robin is one of the most beautiful of the
small birds of the forested areas. About the same size and shape
as a Spotted Flycatcher, it is grey above, slightly olive with a white
forehead, and white markings on the wings, the whole breast is
the most vivid flame-orange of an unusual brilliance. When
perched on some shrub it looks like a brilliant tropical blossom.
It has a habit of taking up a stand on a small dead tree and from
there making excursions of several minutes' duration around the
neighbourhood for insects which it either catches in the air or picks
off the trunks of the great eucalyptus trees. It has a short song
which it repeats at intervals. The female lacks the red breast.
Another very lovely Robin is the Scarlet. The first time I saw
this lovely bird I thought it was a brilliant flower on the bark of
one of the forest trees. No wonder Australian visitors to England

are disappointed in our Robin after they have been used to seeing
this one, for its breast is the most brilliant shade of geranium red
that it is possible to imagine. In fact it would almost make the
Salvias look pale if compared with them. The Australian Robins
of the genus Petroica are not really the same as the Robins of
Europe, but are allied to the Flycatchers. There are five species
whose colouring ranges from brilliant flame-orange, scarlet, rose
pink, to vivid cerise. These birds, whose habits resemble those of
Flycatchers, are found in the heavily timbered forest ranges, but
during a certain part of the year they seem to come out into the
more open country.
The Brown Thornbill is a tiny drab-coloured bird which was
a cheerful companion during my wanderings in the forests around
Mount Monda. It is a charming and familiar little creature,
exceedingly inquisitive and upon seeing an intruder in its forest
domain will at once come up and investigate. The movements of
this tiny bird combine those of a Wren and a Zostwops. It seems
to live and find its sustenance amongst the low forest undergrowth,
and goes about in small parties. The Striated Thornbill is a
slightly smaller and pale grey bird, and I found it not quite so
common as its brown relative. The Thornhills are amongst the
smallest of the Australian birds, and are hardly four inches in length.
Another small denizen of the deep forest is the Pilot Bird which
seems to work in conjunction with the Lyrebird. He is always
on the look out to give the alarm to his large friend, and I noticed
that though the Lyrebird in the Sherbrook forest took little notice
of the noise we made in walking along or of our voices when we
spoke, the second the Pilot Bird sounded the alarm all the Lyre-
birds remained silent and on the alert with cocked heads and
expectant eyes. As the Lyrebird digs the little Pilot Bird hops at
his feet picking up the crumbs, figuratively speaking, that fall
from the Lyrebird's table. It is a very small Robin-like bird, and
is also known as the Downy Pycnoptilus.

The season which is now past is nothing to boast of, though
one cannot, as is usual, blame the weather, which has been much
as usual--chiefly samples.
My first young birds bred here were a trio of Blue-headed
Parrot Finches, the large mountain form, called after Goodfellow
(E. trichroa goodfellowii).
The parents of these chicks were bred here two years ago--
but as I did not think much of them as breeders they were left out
last autumn and wintered out, without heat, but with a good shelter.
These birds on several occasions experienced 22* F.--i.e. io degrees
of frost--but seemed quite unaffected by the cold and laid a few
odd eggs during February and March. Towards the end of this
month they were sitting and their young left the nest at the end of
April. The parents did not go to nest again at once, as I had
expected, but are now building again at the end of August. My
old breeding pair of this species, although apparently in perfect
trim, have done nothing.
I have two adult breeding pairs of the Red-headed Parrot
Finch ( E . psittacea ) ; the older pair, which I have had for several
years, have done nothing this season ; I expect they have shot
their bolt. The other pair, however, reared two broods of three
and four young and are now sitting on three fertile eggs.
The breeding in May of the Black-crested Finch (Lophospingus
pusillus) has already been reported and will presumably be published
in these pages before the appearance of these notes. Of the Waxbills,
the only species which has reared young is the Green Avadavat,
perhaps my favourite of this group of birds. If they are left strictly
alone, I find that young birds put in an appearance from time to
time during the summer. No extra food is provided, but I am
careful never to look into their nests, having learned from past
experiences that these birds strongly resent anyone taking undue
interest in their family matters.

year by Mr. Ezra, built the usual Doves' nest and the eggs never
had a chance--finally the hen was found dead, so that was that.
Diamond Doves, of which I normally breed from twenty to
thirty in a season, have also let me down because I have now only
one ancient pair and two other couples which are all cocks. The
Jobi Island or White-fronted Doves of which I have three true
pairs have been equally disappointing ; it is now two years since
I have succeeded with this species. My birds are getting old, but I
do not think this is of great importance in the case of Doves, a long-
lived genus. The Jobi Dove is to be found in many aviaries both
in Great Britain and on the Continent and I think I am correct
in saying that all these birds emanate from one single pair whose
arrival many years ago I witnessed in the late Mr. Hubert
Astley's aviaries in Herefordshire. They are in consequence terribly
in-bred.
Of the Pheasants I have not a great deal to report. Owing to
the present unsettled state of the market I had been unable to sell
any of my 1938 Amhersts and decided not to breed any of the
commoner species, but to sell my eggs. This was doubtless a counsel
of perfection, result two dozen eggs sold at a price which scarcely
warranted the trouble of packing. Having realized that I was not
meant to be an egg merchant, I consulted my wife with the result
that we have for several weeks partaken of hard-boiled Amhersts'
eggs in our daily salad ; I believe the total eaten in this house
was 137.
Mikados did not lay although this species breeds in its first
year. I presume my hen was not forward enough.
Edwards did better, one hen laid seventeen or eighteen eggs
and ten young have been reared. Satyr Tragopans from which I
had been expecting great things were disappointing. The first
egg was soft, and the second and last was not laid in the sitting
basket, but on a narrow flat shelf where it miraculously remained
until I noticed it. As no more were forthcoming I set this egg under
a Bantam ; it was fertile, but I found a dead fully formed chick
under the foster mother two days before it was due. It may of
course have been killed ; these things do happen fairly often when
the broody discovers that she has hatched a strange alien instead
of an ordinary chicken. The usual remedy is to wring that hen's
neck, but the damage is then done and the Pheasants lost. An

infallible tip given me by a local Pheasant breeder of great
experience is to cover the sitting box, or coop, with a thick sack
a day or two before the eggs are due to chip.
My experience is that a hen who will not tolerate newly
hatched Pheasants will behave quite well if kept in absolute dark-
ness until the Pheasant chicks are quite dry and active. A Bantam
who killed a whole brood of Edwards last year has reared three
Peacock-Pheasants this year by this method. It is possible that
I might have saved my one and only Tragopan had I covered the
sitting box in time, but as I have pointed out the egg hatched two
days sooner than I expected.
My favourite Pheasants are the " Peacocks 55 (P. bicalcaratus) ;
of these I have two pairs and a 1938 hen bred here.
Professor A. Ghigi writes in Aviculture that it is possible to run a
cock with two hens, providing the two hens are kept in separate
aviaries. I did not expect much from my nine-month-old hen but
as an experiment I drove in a mated cock from the adjacent aviary
in early February. He behaved perfectly, displayed at once and
offered anything he could find in the way of luxuries--such as
mealworms or currants. These introductions lasted two or three
days, after which he went back to his lawful spouse for an equal
length of time.
These frequent changes of mate were amusing, as showing the
fickleness of the male sex. Each visit either to the young hen, or
his return to his own mate was the source of violent displaying,
quivering, and the well-known whistling call ; this would last for
a few hours and then slowly simmer down.
The young hen only laid two eggs rather late in the season ;
neither of them hatched, but one was fertile, which shows that the
experiment was successful. From the two adult pairs I reared only
six chicks, though several died in their early days. Notwithstanding
this I consider this an easy species to rear to maturity.
It is well known that Peacock-Pheasant chicks seldom go more
than a couple of yards from the coop containing the foster-mother.
This means, of course, that they do not get as much natural food
and wild insects as they should, but if the hen can be given complete
liberty she will walk the chicks around, and very little artificial
food is required. Failing this the coop can be placed in a small
wire netting enclosure which is moved about from time to time,
and the hen is not shut inside the coop but allowed to lead her

chicks round the run in search of food. Unless the run has a wire
roof or cover it will be necessary to clip one of the wings in each
chick about once a fortnight, but this is an easy matter.
It must be remembered that most foster mothers are very
intolerant of any chicks which are not their own--be they of the
same or some other species, and it is for this reason that the wired-
in run is recommended. Anyhow, these remarks only apply to
Polyplectrons. Amhersts, Edwards and many other chicks wander
about at a distance from the coop and are no trouble in this respect.
Elliotts, indeed, are such travellers that I have lost many in the
past, no doubt through rats and weasels which would not have been
about nearer home.
Dare I write any more about Blue Robins ?
I started the season with a pair each of the Eastern and Western
forms, to these were added a second pair of Eastern, the property
of a lady who wanted me to have them for the season because she
was very busy and I " so clever 55 !
I accepted these birds with alacrity on the understanding that
they would be given their liberty if they hatched young. These
birds were late in starting, hatched five young, were given full
liberty by day, and failed to rear satisfactorily ; the young not
only grew too slowly, but gradually disappeared until only two
weaklings were left. In desperation I hunted for a Robin's nest ;
but, as I said, it was late in the season, and all I could find was a
Spotted Flycatcher's nest with four young. Finally I took these
and replaced them by my two young Robins, now far gone ;
they were neglected and died almost at once.
Here I was faced with a quandary--what should I do with the
Flycatchers. I had nowhere to put them apart from the Bluebird's
nest. Feeling rather like a murderer I gave the Flycatchers to the
Bluebirds and, of course, kept the aviary closed as I feared the old
birds would neglect their foster children and not only desert them
but make their escape as usually happens if they have not a strong
incentive to make them " home ".
To my intense surprise they evinced the greatest pleasure and
excitement when they found their nest-box occupied once more by
a young family. To cut a very long story short these four Fly-
catchers were reared without difficulty on a dozen mealworms
twice daily and the usual soft food, of which a large quantity was

eaten. The young birds all flew on the same day, some ten days
after I had taken them from their own nest.
It is my invariable custom with Bluebirds to cage the whole
family when the young begin to fly, so my mixed crowd were trans-
ferred to a large cage for another ten days, after which I replaced
the adults in their aviary. Seeing that the young were feeding
well and quite independent the question now arose as to their
future. I did not feel that I could cope with such delicate Softbills
during the winter, so decided to liberate them.
One sunny day the cage was placed outside and the two doors
opened. I took up my position some yards away and watched.
Within a very few minutes two of the youngsters flew out and
perched on a high post--part of a pergola--and immediately began
to hawk for insects, a thing they had never done when caged ;
such is instinct, even without the tuition of their legitimate parents.
The other two birds did not attempt to leave their cage for several
hours and I was careful that they should not be driven out and
thereby scared away. They stayed about for a couple of days,
and then left us, perhaps, to return next year. I shall recognize
them if we meet again, as each carries a small aluminium ring.
The pair of Blue Robins whose history has just been told went
to nest again, laid three eggs only, which proved to be clear. They
will shortly be returned to their owner, certainly in perfect con-
dition after their moult, but the question is will she think me so
clever after all ?
My own Bluebirds did rather better. This pair of the Eastern
form occupied a small aviary next door but one to the pair whose
strange doings have just been detailed, and this proximity has,
I feel sure, been a source of trouble if not of actual failure. These
birds are all very combative at any time and when liberated are
inclined to fight other pairs through the aviary wires instead of
attending to business and hunting for insects.
All this meant a good deal of manoeuvring on my part ; for
instance I had to shut pair No. i into their shelter when No. 2
was out, and vice versa. This naturally is disturbing for the birds
which are not liberated and may be impossible if they are incubating
or actually feeding young. Fortunately in my case things did not
clash and my pair hatched five youngsters in their first nest, four
being reared and now grown to fine large birds. I am still kicking

myself over the second nest. After the hen had, as I thought, sat
for nearly three weeks I removed the eggs and broke them--three
contained live chicks.
I had forgotten that hens can 44 sit " without incubating. In
an old note I see that the first chick hatched twenty-one days
after the laying of the last egg, and as the usual incubation period
with this species is twelve to thirteen days it is obvious that when
the hen is constantly flying out of the box whenever you pass by
she may not yet have become 44 broody 53 but is just sitting inside
the box, possibly on the eggs but not properly 44 down 55 on them.
It is not generally known that broodiness is accompanied by
pyrexia or fever, that it is in fact a sort of illness which makes
the bird drowsy and inclined to sit on its eggs, also that the bird's
temperature rises, I believe to about 104* F.
The above mortifying experience was my punishment for
greed--I wanted the birds to lay again, but they did not oblige.
Whereas I still feel ashamed of myself over this destruction of three
valuable chicks, I am extremely proud of my success with the
Western Bluebirds which, although they only reared three young,
did so under great difficulties.
The hen of this couple has for the past two years been weak
in flight feathers and cannot fly strongly. Last year she reared
two young, both hens, fine birds with perfect feathering, but the
old hen, at liberty, often experienced a certain difficulty in flying
back to the aviary door which is about 4 feet above ground level.
I had hoped that with careful feeding, spraying, and so on, she
would moult perfectly for this season's breeding, but her flights
are in fact considerably worse, much resembling the broken primary
quills which one so often sees in newly imported Softbills. 1
When the spring arrived I felt rather hopeless over any chance
of breeding from this pair. They were put in a very large cage
and the usual type of nest-box was hung inside the cage, the
entrance hole being close to a sloping perch to enable the hen to
enter if she so wished. I waited one, two, three weeks--not a scrap
of nesting material was carried.
On 5th April I put both birds into the aviary where they bred
in 1938--this is merely a wooden shed, some 8 feet long with the
front facing south-east, entirely wired in.

Before moving the birds I put up a forest of peasticks to enable
the hen to get about, and hung a nest-box about 3 feet from the
ground ; the box used last year was left in its original position,
quite 6 feet high.
A few bits of hay were quite soon carried into the lower box,
but the nest was so badly built that I suspect the whole work to
have been the cock's. About this time I first noticed him feeding
the hen ; incidentally it may be here stated that unless this feeding
takes place nesting is unlikely and even if it takes place, the eggs
will be infertile. On 15th April I found a soft egg laid or dropped
in the feeding tray--not an encouraging event.
By 25th May things looked brighter, a nice nest was finished
in the higher nest-box and contained five eggs, but here I was on
the horns of a dilemma. I knew from past experience that the birds
would not rear in this small aviary unless given at least partial
liberty, which I then thought impossible, seeing that the hen could
not fly farther than a couple of feet. A wild Robin with eggs in
an old kettle came to my rescue ; my five eggs were transferred and
in due course all hatched.
As I had had a failure in this particular kettle last year, some
robber, furred or feathered, having taken a single Bluebird, I deter-
mined to take precautions to prevent such an occurrence. The
trunk and branches of the thorn tree in which the kettle was sus-
pended were well smeared with Renardine, and the surrounding
ground liberally sprinkled with a mixture of paraffin and creosote.
This should keep away stoats, weasels, or rats, but to protect the
nest against the attacks of winged vermin such as Owls I took a
risk and covered the front of the kettle with ij in. mesh wire
netting. This barricade in no way disturbed the Redbreasts, who
carried on as usual.
Was all safe and set ? Not at all, two days later I looked into
an empty nest ! Five Western Bluebirds gone west, and to this
day I have no idea what beast can have taken them ; but a week
or so later my gardener drew my attention to a small putrifying
mass alive with maggots, it was a pile of five Bluebirds carefully
collected together lying on a paved walk some ten yards away
from the nest site.
Could some clever naturalist possibly enlighten me as to what
bird or animal would behave in this wanton manner ? I set several

carefully baited traps and gins around the old nest but caught
nothing and none of my baits was disturbed.
Meantime the Westerns had laid four more eggs, but by this
time Robin Redbreasts were no longer nesting--or perhaps it
should be said that I could not find a nest.
There was only one course for me, the old birds must be enlarged,
and this I did when the four young were three or four days old ;
first the cock flew out and he at once showed that he remembered
his way perfectly after last year's liberty. Having made several
journeys in and out of the aviary he was followed by the hen, for
whom I had constructed a sort of ladder to enable her to get home
again. As a collector of provender she was, of course, quite useless,
but to encourage the poor little thing I occasionally threw her a
few mealworms which she collected and by dint of great effort
clambered back into her aviary and fed her young.
For me this was all very nerve-racking as I feared she might
lose her way and be trodden on. Finally, when she was reported
as walking down the garden path some forty yards away I caught
and replaced her in the aviary, made a small door high up out
of her reach and quickly taught the cock to use this back-door
entrance instead of the usual one.
After this all went well, the hen using any mealworms or ants'
eggs which I supplied, the cock going in and out through his
private trap-door and greatly adding to the commissariat. The
four young left the nest at the age of seventeen days. All were
large perfectly feathered birds but one was not reared to inde-
pendence. I verily believe he was born blind, he was the first to
leave the nest and I at once noticed his peculiar sphinx-like
expression. Later when the birds were all caged he took no notice
of my hand in the cage or of any of my movements. Naturally
he did not fly about, but managed to find a low perch where he
constantly sat.
Later, when the other three young were becoming independent,
this little fellow was constantly calling for food and, as the parents
became tired of feeding their young, I very much fear he died of
starvation.
This is a very long story detailing great efforts on my part to
perpetuate this very rare sub-species of Blue Robin, fortunately
I have an unrelated adult cock so that I hope to be able to carry

1910, opens with a very charming article by Lady William Cecil
entitled " Some Notes on a few Egyptian Desert Birds ". She
paints a delightful picture of the Desert--" vast, measureless,
silent, glowing golden in the glare of the burning sun, cr changing
through every hue of rainbow tint to silver-white and purple-black
in the magic of the moonlight. Always mysterious, always lonely,
a world of dreams, a wonderland of thought. To the traveller
perhaps a world of terror, of sand-storm, thirst and death ". Yet
here is considerable bird-life from Vultures and Ravens to Chats,
Desert Bullfinches, and the very delightful Desert Partridge
(. Ammoperdix ).
The late Dr. Gunther, who was a first-rate ornithologist and
an Honorary Member of our Society, contributes some interesting
notes on the birds he had kept, with special reference to their age.
He found no difficulty in rearing a Nightjar from a nestling,
an historic specimen, being one of the two figured by Gould in his
Birds of Great Britain. His pair of Red-backed Shrikes which nested

A new series of articles under the title of 44 Practical Bird
Keeping" commenced with the number for January, 1911, and
contained a number of valuable papers. It starts with one on
" The Culture of Finches ", by A. G. Butler, which is followed
by 44 British Warblers " by W. E. Teschemaker, 44 Foreign Doves "
(two articles) by Miss Rosie Alderson, 44 Parrakeets " (two articles)
by myself, 44 Hawks and Owls " by J. L. Bonhote, 44 Starlings "
by A. G. Butler, 44 Tanagers " by S. M. Townsend, and 44 Parrots "
by Hubert D. Astley.
A coloured plate by Gronvold of a pair of Crossbills, illustrates
an article on these birds by Allen Silver in which he describes
the successful breeding of this species in a friend's aviary at
Tunbridge Wells. The birds, both old and young, were so tame
that they were let out to fly in the open every day, but invariably
returned to their aviary at night.
Mr. Silver's article is followed by one by Bonhote who
reproduces a letter which appeared in the Inverness Courier in 1887
describing the successful breeding of this species in captivity and
that actually in a cage two feet long !
Mr. W. L. Sclater writes on the Brom-vogel, a name by which
the Ground Hornbill ( Bucorax cafer) is known in South Africa.
He possessed one of these birds when in charge of the Cape Town
Museum. When he first met 44 Brom ", he lived about the house
following his master when he went for a walk, and squatted by
the side of his chair when he was at work or reading. 44 I was
struck with the bird," writes Mr. Sclater, 44 and after my return
to Cape Town, to my great delight, Col. Bowker sent him round
to me as a present."
Sir William Ingram, Bart., describes his experiment of
introducing the Greater Bird of Paradise ( Paradisea apoda) to the
island of Little Tobago in the West Indies which he purchased
in order to make a sanctuary for this species and which, before
the passing of the Plumage Act, was being decimated in its home,
the Aru Islands. The island is about 400 acres in extent, thickly
covered with tropical jungle and very tall trees, with a climate
much the same as that of the Arus. Forty-eight birds were set at
large at the end of September, 1909. That is thirty years
ago and Sir William has passed away, but I believe the birds,
or their descendants, are there still, living under Government

protection. The late R. Cosgrave writes an account of the
Cranes at Lilford Hall, where a fine collection has been kept
up for many years and is still maintained under the able
charge of Mr. Moody.
T. H. Newman writes on the Snow Pigeon ( Columha leuconota ),
a singularly beautiful species which Goodchild has well portrayed
in a coloured plate. It is seldom imported and seems difficult to
breed successfully. Newman's birds produced many nests and
hatched several young, only one of which lived to be three months
old, for there seems to be considerable difficulty in rearing the
young of this pigeon. There is an excellent coloured plate by
Goodchild of the Cinnamon Teal ( Querquedula cyanoptera ) illustrating
an article by myself.
With a view to giving members a chance of meeting and
becoming personally acquainted with one another, a reception
was held by the Council of the Society on 6th July, 1911, in the
large room of the Refreshment Department, now the Parrot
House, where afternoon teas were served. The Duchess of Bedford,
Vice-President of the Society, received the members, amongst
whom were many prominent ornithologists and aviculturists such
as the Hon. Walter Rothschild, Dr. F. Penrose, Mr. and Mrs.
W. L. Sclater, Mr. and Mrs. Pocock, Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Bonhote,
Messrs. F. E. Blaauw, H. D. Astley, W. R. Ogilvie-Grant, A.
Trevor-Battye, Gerard Gurney and a good many others. This was
the first of such meetings which have since become annual events.
Hubert Astley was no mean artist and several of his drawings
of birds grace the pages of the earlier volumes of the Magazine.
In the one we are considering is a coloured plate by him of the
handsome Red-capped or Pileated Parrakeet ( Porphyriocephalus
spurius ), a somewhat uncommon species from West Australia which
he was successful in breeding.
C. Barnby Smith's articles were always very interesting as he
mostly kept the somewhat unusual birds which do not seem to
appeal to the majority of aviculturists. He writes on the Cayenne
Lapwing ( Vanellus cayennensis) , relating how three birds formed a
triple alliance, though the frosts and snow of an English April
spoilt their chance of rearing a brood ; and of the Rufous-throated
Tree Partridge ( Arboricola rufigularis ), a couple of which made a
domed nest, the entrance to which was carefully blocked with

grass when a bird was sitting ; but both his birds proved to be
hens.
During 1911 a pair of Brazilian Cariamas (Cariama cristata)
nested and reared a young bird in the Zoological Gardens, Regent's
Park, and the young bird is illustrated by three photographers.
W. E. Teschemaker contributes two extremely interesting
articles on the Sprosser (.Daulias philomela ), a species that he found
to be easy to keep and to breed. As this fine songster was said
to prefer the neighbourhood of water and marshes part of a large
aviary was planted with bamboos and reeds while a mound was
planted with a kind of fine grass " because our Nightingale likes
to nest on a bank and, if D. luscinia why not D. philomela ? " The
pair seemed to quite appreciate their new quarters ; the female
foraging in the bamboo jungle and bathing in the shallow pools
while the male, perched in a quince tree, would fill the garden
with the beauty of his song. " The courtship of the male was a
delightful thing to watch. With drooping wings and tail spread
fan-wise and carried erect in Peacock fashion, he would run up
and down a ledge a few feet from the ground, gazing solicitously
downwards at the female on the ground below, and singing
incessantly."
The nest was constructed entirely by the female in a little
hollow in the side of a mound under a projecting tuft of grass ;
four eggs were laid and two hatched after thirteen days incubation.
The young were carefully brooded by the female and fed by both
parents until reared.

This form, known as the Gape Rooibekkie, is as pretty as, if
not prettier than all the other races of this species. It is a larger bird,
and more profusely barred than either the West African, East
African, or the St. Helena forms. It is a bolder bird, with a longer
and broader fan-like tail, when spread, than any of the preceding.
Generally it is darker in colour, with the bars more distinctly
marked and regularly placed.
The bright red patch, rather low down on the abdomen, is
about the same size and shape as a small tea-spoon. The bird has
a waxy, bright red beak and a bright red stripe over the eyes,
perhaps not so broad and prominent as that of the West African
race, but very effective against the darker background. The feet
and tail are black, but apart from these instances there is no other
variation in colour. The Cape race is not washed with pink, as is
the case with the West African, and does not show that white about
the face associated with the East African form, nor is the breast
washed with red as found on specimens from St. Helena.
There is, however, very little difference between the Mauritius
and Cape birds. The former are a shade darker, while the latter are
a trifle larger. We have all those mentioned, and it was most
amusing to see how they all congregated around one nest during the
breeding season.
A huge, deep, bushy nest, about 12 inches deep and 9 inches
broad, was built in the bushes inside the aviary house, about 4.feet
from ground level.
The nest was cleverly constructed of green grasses, beautifully
interwoven, and lined with " Kapok " (a fine, woolley-like material,
used for making mattresses in this country) and thistle-down.
Obviously a nest which one could see as one approached, it was so
thoughtfully placed that the opening was concealed between bush
and branch. It was hidden in such a clever manner that, although
one watched the birds alight on the nest, they suddenly disappeared
and it was difficult to see where they gained their entrance. All the

Rooibekkies in the aviary seemed to have something to do with the
building and the domestic affairs of this home.
It was most interesting to watch their comings and goings.
Several birds would fly in line-ahead formation, one after another,
each carrying a long straw in his mouth, to the house which was
apparently being built to a specified time. Whenever one approached
the aviary one could see this going on. They all worked very hard
during building operations and it was really a pleasure to watch
this busy scene. It was just like a " bee-hive 55 . After building
operations were completed, it was also amusing to watch their
behaviour. There was always some half-dozen of them hovering
about the nest ; some performing on the top, switching their
outspread tails from side to side, and others carrying on the
renovation of the home, pushing a loose end of grass in here and
there. Some were busy in the bush outside the entrance, and now
and again one would carry in some more soft stuff for the cradle.
Knowing that they do not breed freely in captivity, and not having
read of any record of a true pair having bred in captivity, we did
not hold out much hope of anything serious happening.
Little did we know that deep down in that community home a
little family of Rooibekkies was being reared. It was my good fortune
to witness them leaving their home for the first time to go out into
the world, and what a lovely experience it was.
As I approached the aviary I heard some unusual twittering,
which attracted my attention. On arriving inside I found all the
Rooibekkies gathered together in great excitement round and about
the nest. It was just as though there was something unusual in the
aviary, such as a snake or frog, when the birds all gather around in
great excitement. Birds hopped hither and thither excitedly,
twittering as they went, with their little spread tails switching from
left to right. All the time it seemed as though they were expecting
something to happen. Suddenly there was great excitement and
confusion, and a chorus of voices heralded four young Rooibekkies
as they left the nest. All the Waxbills in the aviary seemed to join
in the chorus. It was a huge din, and the Rooibekkies started
screeching with that " Chee-chee-chee " sound of theirs, as they
followed the youngsters into the flight. All noise and activity was
centred around the little mites, which looked quite scared, followed
by so many birds and noise. It was really a very pretty scene, and

made me think of a happy wedding, when relatives and friends wait
outside the church to greet the bridal couple as they appear. By
nightfall the excitement was over and the aviary was restored to
normal again. My only regret is that my good wife missed it all.
The youngsters were naturally much smaller than their parents, or
at least the adult birds, for it was difficult to distinguish which were
the parents, and none of the markings were distinct. The bodies
looked as though they had been discoloured by smoke, only darker
on the backs, with black tails. The red stripes through the eyes and
the red patches on the stomachs were present, though not very
bright. The little black bars were broken and irregularly placed,
and could only faintly be seen. On account of the large number of
interested parties it would be difficult to say how many birds took
part in incubating. However, after the breeding season was over,
and all the old used bushes, nests, and nest-boxes were removed
to prepare the house for winter, special notice was taken of the
Rooibekkies nest. It was found to be a proper community-nest.
Over a dozen eggs were found in various stages of hatching, deep
down at the bottom. Some were newly laid, some addled, and
others infertile. Unfortunately, the good ones had to go the same
way as the bad when the time came. Were it not for that we might
have been able to swank a few more Rooibekkies bred in captivity.
The nest inside was deep, roomy, and spotlessly clean. The eggs,
about the same size as those of the Zebra Finch, were pinkish white
in colour. They were all huddled together in the cosy thistle-down
and Kapok. It would be impossible for one hen to cover all those
eggs, so it leads one to think that several hens must sit side by side
during the incubating period. All four youngsters are now fully
grown and doing well. During the incubation period the usual
foods--manna, plain canary, millet, niger, teasle, green grass-seed,
soft and live food--were supplied, but they seemed to gorge on the
latter two.

By A. F. Moody
A breeding season more or less as usual at Lilford has resulted
in the rearing of average broods of many species of Waterfowl.
The best kinds include numerous Argentine Red Shoveler, five
Australian Sheld-ducks, three 1 Cape Shoveler, five Brazilian Teal,
five Australian Grey Teal ( Anas gibberifrons) . In each of these
cases the number of young reared represent the only eggs laid.
Our Geese included five Cereopsis, five Grey Lags, and two small
broods of Ashy Headed Geese. Amongst other species were four
Australian Banded Plover (Conifer tricolor) , the united efforts of
two breeding pairs (two each). One Ypacaha Rail (A. ypacaha ),
and to wind up the season, one young Macaw {A. chloroptera) of the
species which annually rears here and which took its first flight
from the nesting tree on 22nd September.
Birds which laid with us and did not hatch include Burmeister's
Cariama (Chunga burmeisteri) , Kagu [Rhinochetus jubatus) , Wattled
Curassow (C. carnuculata) &gt; Grey Crowned Crane, and others.
One species which hatched, but did not rear young, was the
White Crested Jay Thrush (Garrulax leucilophus) . A pair of these
built natural nests in tall bushes, produced two clutches of pure
white eggs, but failed to feed the young on hatching.

Mr. P. H. Maxwell sends the following note :--Through the enterprise of
Mr. J. W. G. Frost seven Shrike Starlings ( Scissirostum dubium ) were brought to
England last June. I was lucky enough to obtain two specimens. This bird is
almost entirely of a slaty-grey colour, with yellow bill and feet, but the feathers
of the rump and upper tail-coverts each terminate in a rigid glossy pencil or tuft
of vivid crimson. The sexes are similar. Its habitat is the Celebes, which it is
peculiar to, and I understand it is fairly abundant on that island. My birds do
very well on insectivorous food, bananas, and mealworms. They seem very
hardy and thrive in captivity. It cannot be said to have any song but makes a
funny squeaking noise which is a little difficult to explain. Some doubt has
been cast as to how this bird should be classified, but by most ornithologists
now it is considered to belong to the Starling family.

Most bird keepers are familiar with the occurrence in a wild state of an
aberration of colour, viz. blue instead of green in the cases of Agapornis per sonata,
Psittacula nipalensis, Barnardius zonarius, and the blue fixed variety of the Budgerigar
which occurred in captivity.
In looking through a collection of papers recently I found incidentally
a coloured figure of the All-green Parrakeet or Tuim, Tirica tirica or B. tirica
(del. Rud Fischer), the plate forming an appendix to Revisao dos Psittacideos
Brazileiros, Sao Paulo, 1920.
The specimen is apparently in the collection of the Museu Paulista and the

Whilst officiating at a show recently at Paignton, my notice was called to a par-
ticularly perfect pair of Sacred Kingfishers exhibited by Miss Salter (Mr. Whitley's
aviary curator), and to which pair she had awarded the prize of best foreign
bird. They belonged to a Mrs. Perrett, of Paignton, and this year the pair
nested, laid, and hatched a chick which lived a few days, but was either killed
by the male or died from lack of proper accommodation, as this all occurred
in a cage. These facts may be verified by Miss Salter and Mr. Whitley. This
particularly healthy pair, so well looked after by their owner, might with more
roomy accommodation rear next season, particularly if a good supply of newts,
small frogs, little crabs, and fish, and large insects (such as cockroaches) were
available.

Perhaps the two most striking of the raptorial birds at present
in the London Zoological Gardens are the Harpy from Central
America, and the Monkey-eating Eagle from the Philippines ;
and it is interesting to be able to see and compare these two
wonderful birds from the tropical forests, side by side.
The Harpy (.Harpia harpyja) is, surely, the most magnificent of
all birds of prey with its handsome plumage and enormous talons
that are capable of paralysing any animal into which they get
a grip. Although more closely allied to the Buzzards and Gos-
hawks than to the true Eagles, none of these last would stand
much chance in a fight. Its plumage is very dark grey and white
when adult, though when immature the whole bird is much more
grey.
The Monkey-eating Eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) is perhaps
slightly less in size than the Harpy, and possesses a longer tail.
One might describe it as a giant Goshawk. Its back and tail are
brown and the breast and underparts white, while on its head is a
regular mop of long pointed feathers which are erected when the
bird becomes angry or excited, giving it a most formidable appear-
ance. Its beak is narrow and very deep, and the feet and claws
very powerful. Its home is in the mountain forests of the Philippines
where it was discovered as lately as 1896, by John Whitehead, who
found that it was well known to the natives as a robber of their
poultry and pigs, but they knew it best as a destroyer of monkeys

which are the only animals sufficiently abundant in the district
to support such a large bird.
Whitehead had noticed these large Eagles flying along the edge
of the forest, and believing them to represent an undescribed
species he tried his hardest to obtain a specimen. After much
patience and waiting his native servant managed to bring one
down with a shot as it perched on the top of a high tree. The
specimen, which weighed between 15 and 20 pounds, was sent
home and named by the late W. R. Ogilvie-Grant.
Little more was heard of this rare Eagle until 1908, when
Mr. S. Willoughby Low, with great difficulty, obtained a living
specimen for the London Zoo, which had been captured in
Mindanao, through the kind help of a priest. It arrived on
31st August, 1909. On the 8th February, 1910, this bird refused its
food, and died a few days later, from tuberculosis.
For thirty years the Zoo has been without a specimen of this
fine Eagle, a deficiency which has now been made good by the
arrival of a second example, brought to this country last summer
by Mr. Shaw Mayer for Mr. Herbert Whitley, who has most
generously presented it to the Zoological Society.
There is little doubt that the feeding habits of these two Eagles
are much alike, and that they capture any animal that they can
master.
In a specimen of Pithecophaga skinned by Captain Joseph
Clemens was found a monkey, not yet digested ; and where these
animals are numerous they probably form a large item in the diet
of both this species and the Harpy.

By V. A. V. Carr
{Continued from November, 1939, p. 362)
By careful observation, I think it is generally acknowledged
that the standard and quality of aviary bred British birds has
improved enormously. This may be due to several reasons, the
chief of which being that the parents (in the majority of cases,
that is) are selected before being paired ; and that the parent
birds have easily acquired foods with which to feed the youngsters,
most of the food being more of a " scientific " nature comparable
to balanced rations and mashes with which experienced poultry
farmers feed their stock. I need hardly add, however, that if the
youngsters are not fed in a correct way for the first week by the
parents the chances of the fledgeling living up to four months old
are remote.
In 1936 my father bred a particular nest of Goldfinches from
parents that were selected. The male bird had a wonderful
" blaze " (the red square extending from the top of the head to
about J in. below the beak), and altogether very fine in most
respects. The hen also is one of the best hen Goldfinches I have
ever seen and fortunately the pair mated and bred many youngsters.
They had two clutches (four each) and reared seven hens and
one cock. This was a most remarkable occurrence but a most
interesting one and makes one wonder if such things happen in
the wild. The young hens are very fine but the cock bird is one
of the best Goldfinches I have ever seen, putting his father very
much in the " shade ". Such a bird has great possibilities of
improving the breed and quality by pairing selectively and getting
a strain of Goldfinches that are much above the average. I think
the Goldfinch is one of the handsomest of our native birds which
can be imagined by noticing some of the names by which it is
called--" Seven coloured Finch," " Proud Tailor," etc., etc.
The Goldfinch is a very attractive and comparatively easy bird
to keep and has a very delightful song. The difference in the sexes
is only confined to the cock bird being better and brighter in
every respect and as a general rule they are not hard to sex. They
go readily to nest--building a wonderful little nest made with
</bodyText>

small twigs as the base and well lined with feathers. In the wild
state fruit trees are their favourite sites, but in captivity they will
nest in Hartz Roller Canary cages (wooden), in bushes made by
tying a bunch of heather, elm suckers, and a little evergreen and
securing them in a corner of the aviary or on a post, etc. Unwoven
binder twine string is much appreciated by most birds for the base
of the nest and also for lining. Thistle down, too, is used by
Goldfinches, Siskins, and Linnets, in fact anything that is soft.
I have seen confetti, cotton waste, and even paper used and the
bigger the assortment of material supplied to nesters and would-be
nesters--the bigger the chances of success.
I remember last summer in the course of my travels I came
across four Goldfinches that had been reared from the nest by
a gardener. They were in a cage 4 feet wide, 2 feet high, and about
18 inches from back to front. One of these birds (they were equally
sexed) had endeavoured to nest in a small twig and had laid her
eggs on the floor. I managed to procure these birds and put them
in two large aviaries and, within a week, both the hens were sitting
and eventually reared their respective broods. This was about
the end of August and they went ahead with another nest.
Even in the wild they are late nesters but in captivity are a lot
later and, strangely enough, a lot earlier. We had one pair lay
their first egg on the 2nd March !
The youngsters are not difficult to rear compared to Bramblings,
Chaffinches, Yellow Buntings, etc. These are essentially reared on
live food, not so much as regurgitation by the parent birds.
Goldfinches and the like are fed principally by semi-digested food
and if sprouted seeds, seeding groundsel, thistleheads, sowthistle,
ragwort, etc., are thrown in the aviary the parent birds help
themselves and take their choice. Bullfinches likewise are attractive
birds but towards the breeding season time the cock birds must
be separated. They will agree with any other species of birds,
but two cock Bullfinches will fight to the death from spring time
to moulting time. I have heard it said that they pair for life, but
from my own observations they are one of the most polygamous
birds I know. In fact in the breeding season wild cock Bullfinches
will come to the captivated hens and fight for mastership. This
will go on incessantly and upsets the hen concerned. If the proper
mate is not in proper breeding condition she will have nothing

By C. Buckingham Jones
A short description of attempted breeding operations in the
East might interest readers--at least so I have thought. Conditions
out here are not quite the same as at home. Nevertheless one has
a modicum of success when one least expects it.
Local birds one expects to have no trouble with ; not only,
however, do they not breed but die off suddenly and without
rhyme or reason.
Here are two instances of this. I must explain first that my
aviaries are situated in Upper Assam where the climate is very
hot, steamy and wet in the summer but our cold weather, i.e.
winter, is j'ust ideal, what there is of it ; warm sunny days and
delightfully cool nights.
To return to local disappointments in Assam we have the
Green Pigeon, lots of forms, all good to shoot and eat but
uninteresting birds in an aviary I have found. The " greener ",
however, is a beautiful bird to look at. Anyone interested should
see Stuart Baker's book on Indian Pigeons and Doves. One would
think, however, that the Green Pigeon in captivity in Assam of
all places, would thrive. I have never managed to keep them
more than a few weeks though I have tried them with all kinds of
food, jungle berries and so forth, and experimented with youngsters
out of the nest. They all pine and die off.
Then again I once received a batch of half a dozen White-
faced Hill Partridges from the Miri hills. Now the Miri hills are
only 20 odd miles away from my aviaries and the climate is the
same in both places. Actually I expected these Partridges to stand
up to the excessive dampness and exceptionally heavy rain one

gets in Assam. Not a bit of it. They flourished exceedingly for two
months or so when after a heavier deluge than usual the whole
lot died off within two to three days. It may have been disease,
of course. Other birds, not birds of Assam either and therefore
birds one might expect not to stand up to the climate, weathered
the storm as it were. However, I hope to try again with Arboricola
atrigularis.
An Assam bird I have managed to breed, however, is the
Black-breasted Kalij Pheasant ( Germans horsjieldii horsfieldii) . The
Dorik, as he is known locally, is a nice looking bird in a quiet way,
a purple blue which stands out well when the sun strikes on him,
the lower back carrying bars of white. The female is, of course,
the usual subdued Kalij hen.
Last year in a jungle aviary one pair reared to maturity three
youngsters, a male and two females. Seven eggs were laid. This
year the same pair have two youngsters, both females three months
old. I do not know how many eggs were laid but I do not think
as many as last year. Given the right conditions there seems to be
no trouble in rearing Dorik in Assam and I feel certain I could rear
this Kalij Pheasant to any extent required. How they would stand
the journey to England is another matter but they seem fairly tough,
constitutionally not gastronomically. So much for the Black-
breasted Kalij Pheasant.
My aviaries I may say are all \ in. wire mesh, as we have
snakes, etc., to contend with, excepting the large wildfowl enclosure,
which has 2 in. mesh on the top. This may let in rodents, etc.,
who do the preliminary climb up the J in. mesh sides, but the
wildfowl seem to manage all right, probably because they have a
pond in which to take refuge.
The next species of bird which I take pride in breeding is the
Grey Jungle Fowl, Gallus sonnerati. This bird hails from South
India and is not a local inhabitant. I got a pair from a Calcutta
dealer and have had them two years. This year, in a very jungly
aviary 18 ft. by 18 ft. which they share with a pair of Ringneck
Parrakeets ( Psittacula torquata), three youngsters have emerged and
are now three months old.
How many eggs were laid I do not know. I find that leaving
the birds to get on with their matrimonial activities pays. The
Jungle Fowl laid in heavy guinea grass, a scrape presumably, and

the chicks were fully feathered when I first saw them. I made a
point of allowing none of my people to go inside the aviary whilst
there was any possibility of these birds laying. There was in this
aviary a 6 ft. box let into the ground a foot or so, and filled with
earth. A grandfather clock nest in other words. The earth was
topped with old wood chips about i foot from the top and there
was a small square opening. The Ringnecks took advantage of
this and there is certainly one, if not two, youngsters inside at the
moment, ist August, 1939. It or they were hatched quite a month
ago. I am awaiting my first sight of the progeny with much interest.
I give as much fruit as possible to these Parrakeets, I do not think
the best diet for the Parrot family is grain and only grain. In the
wild state in India they eat little grain save in the ear and, in fact,
I regard the Indian Parrot as mainly a fruit- and bud-eater. I feel
certain that in captivity a diet of dried seeds must nauseate him, but
of course I may be wrong.
Finally, I have two pairs of the Assam or Grey-bellied Tragopan
(Tragopan blythi ). One pair laid two eggs on the ground at the
beginning of the year. At that time I did not know these birds
nested in trees or fairly high up. Since then I have put in nest-
boxes fairly high in their runs and they sleep in them invariably
but no eggs. I seem to have missed the bus for this year. My pair
of Mrs. Hume's Pheasants have not laid so far. I find them very
wild and shy in captivity whereas the Tragopans, particularly
the females, have got quite tame. With the experience so far gained
I hope to report better progress next year.

(Continued from p. 15)
In the deep forested gullies where the great gum trees rise up
to between two and three hundred feet, and the undergrowth is a
jungle of tree ferns and a hundred other growths, one finds the
unobtrusive Mountain Thrush, a bird which rather resembles a
rotund edition of our Missel Thrush but less spotted. Its song,
if it may be called a song, is very distinctive and as Cayley says in
his book, What Bird is That , resembles the noise made by a ratchet
drill boring a metal plate. It spends its time on the ground searching
in the forest humus for insects.
All around the house in the forest were Bower Birds, the
\0x25A0 \0x25A0 Satins ", and their strange wheezy calls could be heard especially
in the early morning and late at night; in fact they had a bower
not far from the house itself. The birds live mainly on berries.
There was a single holly tree near the house which in season
bore a profusion of berries and these the birds loved. In a few
days after ripening the tree would be cleared. The owner of the
house used, as soon as the berries were ripe, to pick some for
indoor decoration, but even that did not deter the birds, they just
came into the house and took them the same. A bower which
I had under observation was not a particularly good one, as it was
made by immature birds. Scattered all round it were dozens of the
pale blue feathers of Pennant's Parrakeet, bits of blue paper, and
the inevitable blue-bags which the birds managed to steal from
the wash-house. In some districts where the birds are plentiful,
no one can keep a blue-bag unless they put it in a drawer or similar
place. There were a good many washed-out blue-bags around this
bower, and the birds had obviously painted part of the play-
ground blue with the bags. These birds dearly love anything
blue. They specially love the blue paper in which cotton-wool is
usually wrapped, but they gather up blue beads, blue pieces of
broken china, etc. Some Bower Birds are fond of yellow as well
and in the spring time when there are yellow flowers in bloom,
the owner of the house told me, the bower is carpeted with them.

The owner of the bower I had under observation was just coming
into colour, and his green plumage was mottled with dark shining
blue. I often caught a couple playing around the bower, but
my appearance usually sent them away and, no matter how long
I waited, they never came back again.
The Satin Bower Birds eat a great deal of fruit, especially
grapes, as I know from my birds at home, plums, apples, etc.
The bower is purely a playground and has nothing to do
with the nest, which is high up and very difficult to find. The
birds, like Birds of Paradise, breed several years before getting their
adult plumage, which in the cock is deep shining blue. The hen is
mottled green, which is also the colour of the cock before he assumes
his adult garb. The eyes of these birds are the most beautiful I
know of, except perhaps those of the Six-plumed Bird of Paradise,
being a lovely clear pale violet blue. These birds had been bred
by Mr. Hirst, of Sydney, and I saw a very fine young one in his
aviaries. The adults had made quite a large bower.
Before leaving the forested regions I must mention those
magnificent birds the Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoos, which inhabit
the same country as the Gang Gangs. I saw my first birds in the
heavily forested ranges in Victoria. Our attention was first
attracted to them by their harsh cries, and several then flew over,
easily distinguished from the Gang Gangs by their large size and
larger and differently shaped tail. The habits of these and the
Gang Gangs are very much the same ; they are exclusively forest
birds, feeding upon the seeds of the great forest trees, and also
upon the large white grubs which live in the dead wood.
I was told of a pair of young birds for sale in Melbourne,
but on going for them I was told that they had just been sold.
They make the most delightful pets and are extremely tame and
familiar. In fact, there is no bird I would rather have than a pair
of these, but alas, they are difficult to rear and still more difficult
to procure, as it is usually only by cutting down some giant forest
tree that the young are procured.
The Black Gocktaoos, of which there are four species, excluding
the Palm Cockatoo, inhabit the South, South-Western, and South-
Eastern parts of Australia, and are amongst the most magnificent
of the Parrot tribe. In Europe they are exceedingly rare, and
seldom seen outside Zoological Gardens. Even in their own country

the Black Cockatoos are accounted a great rarity in captivity, and
they are held to be worth as many pounds as the other Cockatoos
are worth shillings. I came across only two in private hands, but
more of that anon.
Although the Pied Currawong so closely resembles its near
relative, the Pied Crow-Shrikes or Magpies as they are called in
Australia, it differs markedly in habits. It is far more arboreal,
and I seldom saw it on the ground. It is a forest loving bird, and
is also found around the houses and clearings around the forest
lands. Its exceedingly loud and melodious calls, which are by
no means as varied as the Crow-Shrikes, are to be heard in the
early mornings issuing from the heart of some dense forest tree.
I often used to stand and watch them out of the bathroom window
as I shaved in the mornings, for outside stood a huge Rowan Tree
whose berries were a great attraction to the birds. The Currawongs
were very fond of them, and I often used to watch them stuffing
themselves with them. In fact, it was almost incredible how many
berries a bird could put away. They feed on all manner of wild
fruits and berries, and I have watched them eating plums with the
Bower Birds near the house. Most birds are afraid of the Curra-
wongs, even the Crimson Rosellas will quickly leave a tree when
they come along. I believe they eat eggs and kill young birds, but
to me their diet appeared to be frugivorous.
For many years at home in England one of the first sounds
I heard in the mornings was the loud musical chortle of my tame
Crow-Shrikes, Piping Crows, Australian Magpies, or whatever
one likes to call them. So when I came out to Australia and stayed
in the country districts it was a strangely familiar sound I heard
in the early mornings. At one hotel I stayed at in a remote town
there was a gum tree in the main street which was just outside
my window. This was the roosting place for the town's Magpies.
They started their carollings about 4.30 a.m., and after this it was
quite impossible to sleep. I enjoy their melodious loquacity in
small doses, but this was quite too much of a good thing. I was
glad I wasn't staying there long.
No bird is better known or typical of Australia than the familiar
Magpie. He is bold and aggressive and will brook no interference
from any other bird. They are to be found around the home-
steads and farms all over Australia. Often a pair will take up

residence at a farm, usually in a cattle paddock where insects
are plentiful, and will not tolerate any more of their own species
in the vicinity. As soon as the young ones are able to fend for
themselves they are driven off. They get exceedingly tame and
will come into houses for food. At the house in the forest the
young ones learned to tap on the window-pane for food, and they
just tapped until it was given to them. This is one of the very few
birds which I think is never shot. The birds know this and with
the Pied Grallinas are the tamest and most familiar birds in
Australia. Few birds will go to such lengths to defend their nest
as this one, and they will unhesitatingly attack human beings if
they try to reach it.
The Piping Crows, Crow-Shrikes, Magpies, etc., as they are
variously called, are amongst the most delightful of all birds kept
by aviculturists. Though boasting no brilliant plumage, there
are few birds having a greater share of intelligence. They have
this great advantage, which at once places them amongst the most
desirable birds--that they can be kept at complete liberty and yet
they still retain their tameness. Being practically terrestrial
they seldom wander away, though it is best to clip one wing when
they are first given their liberty. They are blest with perhaps the
most musical voice of any living bird. They have no actual song,
but a delightful peal or carol of exceedingly sweet flute-like notes*
often starting on a low note and ascending right up the scale.
Each bird has a different series of notes, and they are not slow
to imitate the sounds of other birds and mammals.
On a bright warm sunny day the birds will chortle away for
hours on end. Their music, however, is not appreciated by every-
one, for a neighbour once complained that his daughter could not
sleep owing to the noise made by " those awful black and white
birds " ! There are some people to whom the notes of the
Nightingale are but " noise ", though often the same people will
listen for hours to dreary promenade concerts because it is the
" thing " to do.
Every bird has a different and very striking individuality. Of
three birds I brought back from New Zealand, two cocks and
a hen, each one was as different in personality as human beings
are. The hen was a very happy creature and, at first, never vicious,
but later she developed the bad habit of flying straight into one's

face. I rather think it was her husband who spoilt her. He was
a savage brute and would fly at one on every occasion. He was
sly about his attacks, slowly getting to the back, and when one
was not looking would inflict very severe wounds with his dagger-
like beak. The three birds were kept in an aviary together, but
the pair inflicted such severe punishment on the odd bird, dragging
him round the aviary by the back of his neck until they almost
killed him. That is one of their disadvantages, they can never be
kept with other birds unless the latter are stronger and larger. Also
a pair will not tolerate others of their own species with them. In a
few months the odd bird recovered. He was a delightful pet, quiet
and gentle, without any trace of fear. He would meet one as one
came into the orchard, stand in front and utter a short peal of
melodious notes. On every occasion he would try to get into the
bird room to pick up the odd mealworms which he might find
lying about, or jump into the mealworm breeding box as soon as
it was opened. His cage hung outside on a wall, and every evening
he would find his way there and roost in it for the night. Motors in
motion he was half afraid of, and when one came out of the garage
he would either hide behind a wall or jump into his cage ; when
stationary he would go underneath and examine the parts, much
to the detriment of his plumage. A quiet and most charming bird,
he would at once come up and inspect any work one was doing,
conversing all the while in a low undertone. He always reminded
me of someone who had a great trouble on his mind, for his eyes
were always sad and he had a far-away look. Strangers he hated,
and always went for their ankles, much to their discomfort, for his
pecks were no joke. A hen was procured for him, a derelict when
she arrived, but a jollier or happier bird I have never possessed.
Her joy at being given her liberty was unbounded, she raced
round and round waving her wings and giving vent to the most
amazing variety of sounds I have ever heard issue from a bird.
She seemed simply in love with life, she loved to play hide and
seek round the aviaries or follow one out on to the road, run into
the house, chase about the room, and, if she found no one, go out
into the road until she did, when she would at once run up to
them and utter her joyous carol of sweet music. One of her accom-
plishments was to bark exactly like a dog. Out on the road she
would spy a dog, run up to it and start barking ; this amazed the

dogs who, when they got over their astonishment, would start and
chase her. After she did this several times we had to be very
careful and prevent her going out. She was totally different from
her quiet and unobtrusive husband. Her whole life seemed to be
spent in prying into everything, meeting everyone who comes,
and telling the world in general how happy life was.
Alas, both birds came to a very sad end. The cock hunted
and caught rats and mice, but one evening he pounced on a rat
which was too big for him. The squeals of the rat brought other
rats, and they all attacked him and tore him to pieces. In the
morning there was little left of my poor " Maggie 55 . I found
another husband for the hen, but he disapproved of her, and
one day when closed in an aviary containing a pond, he drowned
her. In the meantime I had to part with the first pair, as they
fought terribly, so in the end I was left with one single bird which
I still possess, or at least I hope so, as these notes are penned in
Australia, and it is nearly six months since I last saw him. He is a
quiet dignified bird, quite unlike the others. In the early morning
he will always greet one with a loud chortle, and later on he will
come into the house for a bit of cheese or meat. He is very friendly
with the gardener, and follows him about in the hope that he will
do some digging so that he can get some small worms or grubs,
though he prefers the latter. When he first came to us he was
a terrible derelict. He had had one leg broken at the thigh and
it was still in splints. He was only a very miserable undersized
youngster, and all day long he used to whimper with the pain of
his leg, but in a couple of years he was one of the best specimens
I ever saw.
After the " Magpie " the next most popular bird is perhaps
the Giant Kingfisher known in Australia as the " Kookaburra ".
This is a very common bird distributed throughout Australia, and is
a great favourite. This bird doesn't fish in the accredited King-
fisher style, but feeds upon all manner of land animals such as
small mammals, lizards (these seem to be its favourite food),
snakes, small landcrabs, centipedes, etc. On Mount Monda large
numbers of landcrabs must have been eaten judging by the amount
of claws and legs which I found on the high forested ridges. The
bird takes up its position on some exposed branch or similar place,
often a post, and quietly waits for its prey. As soon as anything

edible is sighted, the bird swoops down with a swift and silent
flight and the victim rarely escapes.
I found the bird more silent than I expected, and only heard
its loud rollicking " laugh " in the full just before it went dark in
the evenings. The bird already in its roosting place would give
vent to this very loud and far-reaching cry which would be caught
up and answered by all the surrounding birds. In a few minutes
after the first started, the mountain ranges would be ringing for
miles around as every bird answered its neighbour. The sound
seemed to be amplified by the dead silence which otherwise seemed
to prevail at that hour. The evening chorus of the Kookaburras in
the mountains was perhaps one of the most impressive and striking
bird sounds I have ever heard, and one which I shall never forget.
The tiny and delicate Fantails are the very antithesis of the
foregoing. I first made their acquaintance in New Zealand, and was
greatly enamoured by these dainty and fairy like birds which
used to flit silently through the deep forests, following the traveller
long distances. In Australia I again met with two closely related
species, but owing to abundance of small birds in the forest they
did not appear as conspicuous as in New Zealand where they
are often the only denizens of the deep dark forests.
The Rufous Fan tail, the most beautiful of the Fantails, is a
charming little creature with its dancing flight low over the
mountain streams and torrents, catching tiny flies just off the
surface of the turbulent waters and showing all the time its large
widely spread fan-like tail to its best advantage. It is very tame
and allows one to approach very close.
The Grey Fantail is much commoner than the Rufous, and is
found also in the heavily forested districts. I met a great many in
the forests of the Lyrebird country. It seems to live higher up in
the trees than the Rufous, where it feeds on tiny flying insects
captured on the wing. In pursuit of these it performs all manner
of aerial acrobatics, keeping all the time its large fan-like tail
outspread. The nest is like that of the New Zealand Fantail, and
is one of the most beautiful structures ever built by a bird. Shaped
like a spinning top it is composed of the finest materials, covered
with cobwebs, and built round the slender branch of a forest
sapling. Sitting one day in the decayed hollow trunk of a forest
giant, I was surrounded by a flock of the Pied Fantails which came

so close to inspect me that I could have easily caught them with
my hands, when a Rufous Fantail appeared on the scene and put
all the rest to flight.

The volume of the Magazine for 1912, which, as usual, com-
mences in November of the previous year, is another fine production
of a period when aviculture was flourishing. There were only
six coloured plates, but a number of black-and-white illustrations.
The volume commences with an account, by R. Cosgrave, of the
breeding of a hybrid Crane from a male Canadian and a female
Wattled. As our older members will remember, Cosgrave was
for many years in charge of the collection of birds at Lilford Hall,
and a more charming person or one better fitted to his post it would
be difficult to find. Late in the same volume he records the breed-
ing of the Laughing Kingfisher, and the successful rearing of
young for the first time in this country ; and the breeding of
hybrid Cockatoos of which the parents were a male Rose-breasted
(Cacatua roseicapilla ) and female Greater Sulphur-crested (C. galerita ).
He also contributes an able article on Cranes in the series " Practical
Bird-keeping 55 .
W. E. Teschemaker bred the Hawfinch, Crested Lark, and
Black Redstart, and contributes very interesting accounts of these
successes.
Gerard Gurney writes on the successful breeding of the
Coronated Guineafowl {Guttera pucherani), this being, apparently,
the first time this handsome species had bred in this country, though
Mr. Ezra has bred it since, as recorded in our last number.
Dr. Philip H. Bahr contributes " Notes on Some Fijian Birds
in Captivity " accompanied by a good coloured plate by Goodchild,

of the Fijian Parrot Finch ( Erythrura pealei), a number of which he
brought home, together with specimens of the interesting Lorikeet
(Calliptilus solitarius) and the other Parrots of those islands--
Pyrrhulopsis splendens , P. taviunensis, and P. tabuensis. Peale's Parrot
Finch is one of the best of the groups, though hardly as attractive
as the new Caledonian E. psittacea. Some that Dr. Bahr sent to
the Zoo bred in what was then known as the Summer Aviary.
A. L. Butler, who was at one time Game Warden in the Sudan,
contributes a valuable article on the migration of the Sprosser
and the Common Nightingale as observed by him. The Sprosser
arrives at Khartoum in large numbers in the autumn, then dis-
appears, but it is not observed in the Spring, showing that it
travels north by another route.
H. Wormald contributes a delightful article on the " Red
Grouse in Confinement ", in which he says that of all the game
birds he has kept, Grouse have proved themselves by far the tamest
and most interesting, becoming extremely tame and actually
aggressive. The hens laid freely and the eggs, placed under
Bantams, hatched in twenty-one days.
" The newly-hatched chicks," he writes, " are most charming
little birds, very thick-set, with beautiful yellow down with rich
brown markings and furred legs and toes." They were fed upon
fresh heather shoots, Spratts' Maxco, hard-boiled egg, and maggots.
They grew quickly and began feathering when about three days
old. They flew well when little bigger than Sparrows and none
were lost after they were a week old. " One great point to remember
in rearing young Grouse, Black-game, and Capercaillies," he
proceeds, " is that full sun is fatal even to half-grown birds ; to
guard against this I have low, movable covered pens made about
30 inches high, 12 feet long, by 6 feet wide boarded half up the
sides, and with wire-netting tops. I then spread a thick layer of
grass, green boughs, etc., all over the tops of the pens, so that
practically all the interior of the pens was in the shade, and when
it did happen to rain the young birds kept nice and dry." He
stresses the great importance of good grit and a dusting bath.
In an interesting article on the Secretary Bird, Major Boyd
Horsbrugh, who knew this bird well in South Africa, remarks :
" I cannot quite understand why the Secretary is dubbed a vulture
--he has nothing vulturine about him--he kills his own prey in

his own fashion and tainted meat seriously upsets him. I look
upon him as a large ground Goshawk and not at all as a
vulture."
W. H. St. Quintin follows with an article on the same subject,
" I have kept these birds for about four years," he remarks, " and
the first thing that struck me about them was their amazing
appetites ! I have long been accustomed to keep raptorial birds
large and small ; and, as a rule, one may say that the larger the
bird the less frequent (imitating natural conditions) should be
his meals, though of course the meals, when given, must be full
ones. In one of our best private collections, where Eagles and
Vultures live for years, and are in the pink of condition, these
birds are fed on four days in the week, but as much as they like
each time. On the other hand, the Smaller Falcons, Hawks, and
Owls must be fed night and morning. But the Secretary Bird
I soon found, big as he is, does not look his best unless he has a
good meal twice a day, and pretty much what he can stow away
each time, including fur, feather, and bone."
W. T. Page tells us of his success in breeding the Indian White-
eye (#osterops palpebrosa) in an outdoor aviary. They built at the
top of a hawthorn bush, a " cradle-like nest slung on the under-
side of the branch ". Three pale bluish-white eggs were laid,
and all hatched on 7th July, the young leaving the nest on 17th
July-
Writing upon Mandarin Ducks at liberty, E. G. B. Meade-
Waldo remarks on the extreme activity of the newly-hatched
ducklings. " Some of the nests," he writes, " were at least two feet
down a perpendicular hole in a tree ; the young to have got out
must have jumped up that height. A brood of young ducks covered
a mile as the Crow flies, partly through standing corn, the day
they were hatched, in little over an hour ! The young ones were
able to leap from the water on to a branch eighteen inches high when
a day or two old, and it was very pretty to see an old Duck fly on
to a branch, and the young leap up one after the other and arrange
themselves along the branch ; one or two would generally jump
on the old Duck's back."
A very interesting account of the habits, both when wild and
in captivity, of the Kokla or Wedge-tailed Fruit Pigeon (&amp;lt;Sphenocercus
sphenurus) is contributed by Pelham T. L. Dodsworth, and John

50 D. SETH-SMITH-EARLY YEARS OF AVICULTURAL SOCIETY
William Ainley writes on the Parson Bird of New Zealand ( Prosthe-
madera novae seelandiae), a species that has not been seen in captivity
in Europe for many years past. Mrs. Johnstone gives a charming
account of her successes in keeping Touracos, Bower Birds, and
Birds of Paradise. The first of these bred successfully in her aviaries.
A coloured plate by Goodchild of Hunstein's Bird of Paradise
(Diphyllodes m. hunsteini) accompanies an article on the species by
E. J. Brook who at that time kept, at Hoddam Castle, the finest
collection of Paradise Birds in the world.
In an account of the display of the Satyra Tragopan, C. Barnby
Smith describes both the lateral and the frontal display. The
latter is an extraordinary exhibition of which Mr. Barnby Smith's
account is well worth quoting. He writes : 4 4 The head is nodded
repeatedly with increasing speed and the brilliant light blue horns
gradually become inflated and extend forward from the black
feathers of the head whilst the bib (or gular wattle), which is also
blue with pink side stripes, is gradually let down to its full length.
Whilst this is being done the shivering and rustling of the feathers
have increased to an alarming extent, the body of the bird has been
lowered quite near the ground, the wings are extended sometimes
almost to their full width, and the whole business is preceded and
accompanied (particularly in the early stages) by a curious noise
like the 4 clacking ' of two bones together, but how this noise is
made I have never found out, though I should much like to know.
44 When the bib has been extended to full length for a few
moments the bird gathers himself together, moves forward about
a yard, draws himself up to his full height (and it is surprising
how high he can reach), keeps the bib fully extended in front of
the hen for one moment, and then, within half a minute, horns and
bib have entirely vanished and the cock is strolling about pecking
grass as if nothing unusual had happened."
The breeding of insectivorous British birds has never been so
popular with aviculturists as has that of foreign birds, so a letter
from Mr. J. Jeffrey describing the successful breeding of Nightingales
is of especial interest. He says Nightingales are most adaptable
birds for cage and aviary, and go to nest very readily. He bred

to this volume a most interesting article on the Paradise Flycatcher
(Terpsiphone paradisea qffinis ), a tame specimen of which he kept
in India. He purchased the bird for one shilling and fourpence from
natives who had kept him tethered by the leg. When obtained, he
was a little red-brown bird evidently of that season, a pretty bird
then, but very different from the glorious creature he became in
his fourth year when he attained the snow-white plumage of the
adult, with four long white tail feathers, black shafted and black
edged.
" Butterflies he disdained, but he enjoyed grasshoppers, cater-
pillars, woodlice, grubs, and beetles, and above all, house flies.
Perhaps, however, even more than house flies or anything else
living, he enjoyed little tit-bits of fowPs liver raw, and it was very
pretty to see him swooping up off a chair-back, high up, almost
to the ceiling, as I threw up pieces of liver for him to catch. He
was a magnificent catch . . . but not nearly as quick as a tame
Drongo I kept at the same time, and when both were in the same
room together I had always to throw the Drongo a piece first and
whilst he was after it, throw a piece for the Flycatcher in the
opposite direction . 55
Those who have known this most charming species will realize
Mr. Baker&apos;s delight in his possession.
In writing of 64 Fresh Air for Birds , 55 Mrs. Katharine Gurrey
thus describes an escapade of an American Robin which, " one
very cold day opened the door of his cage and flew out. I placed
his cage on the veranda and hoped for the best, but spring is rather
a fatal time in which to lose birds. He flew all over the garden
and late in the afternoon returned to the veranda and flew into
his cage ! It was home to him . 55
The late J. G. Phillips, who was known to some of us as a very
charming personality in addition to being a great ornithologist
and the greatest authority on American waterfowl, made several
contributions to our Magazine at this period. His article on
\0x25A0 ' Wintering Cranes in New England 55 is of interest as proving the
hardiness of these birds. Of the American species the Whooping
Crane (Gras americana) was the finest of all but, so far as is known,
it is now gone for ever and, as Phillips observes, " the extinction
of such a fine species is a real calamity and one that will be realized
by the next generation much more than by this one . 55 Of this

Have I been lucky, or are Jameson's Ruddy Waxbills easy to
breed in confinement ?
My latest joy is a family of four fine babies now as big as their
parents, and, but for a Pekin Robin, I believe there would have
been five. The young cocks, though only five weeks out of the
nest, are already singing cheerily.
My first so-called pair I purchased two years ago, but the
reputed hen moulted into a handsome little common cock Firefinch,
and it was only last autumn that I came across two genuine
Jameson hens. These arrived in excellent condition, in spite of
having been sent in error, five days earlier, from London to a
remote hamlet in Perthshire, where they arrived one Saturday
afternoon, the sole package on a large railway lorry, from the
station, miles away. It was too late to do anything but keep them
there over the week-end, and on Monday send them another day's
journey on to Yorkshire. With experience of the common hen
Firefinch, I fully expected to receive " A live bird--but it's dead ",
as announced by a railway clerk on a previous occasion.
But, not a bit of it ; two extremely sprightly little birds returned
from their Scottish trip.
The courting dance of the cock, in his rich crimson suit, is
similar to that of other Waxbills, but his song, or perhaps succession
of notes better describes it, is loud, clear, and varied, and as un-
expected from so small a bird as that of our native Wren. Although
there is an unmated cock Firefinch in the aviary, the second hen
Jameson seems to offer little attraction, and he pays more attention
to a Pink Cheek Waxbill than to her.
Owing to a holiday in August, followed by the war and its
occupations, I know singularly little of the Jameson's nest building,

but the babies were hatched somewhere in a pile of heather some
four feet high in a corner of the aviary, and when they emerged
in September, they were little black-billed, brown-feathered objects,
strong on the wing, but attended everywhere by very worried
parents. It was a charming sight to see father and mother on
the ground at feeding time, surrounded by four clamouring infants,
almost turning themselves upside down in their endeavours to be
first at the source of supply.
For the most part the young Jamesons were reared on gentles,
with occasional mealworms, added to a perpetual supply of fresh
seeding grass and chickweed. Every bit of soil was diligently
searched for insects, but as the aviary is indoors, in a disused
billiard room, all their food had to be introduced. The staple
diet of the adults is mixed millets with cod liver oil added, soaked
canary seed, and soaked millet sprays. But owing to a large mixed
collection in the same aviary (which measures some 30 feet long by
5 feet, by 9 feet high) various mixed seeds and soft foods are also
available.
Having become acquainted with these cheerful, hardy little
birds, never again will I risk the sorrow of picking up that pitiful
little scrap of ruffled feathers that was once a common hen Firefinch.

A few days ago I lost an old favourite which had lived with
me for many years.
In the spring of 1923 I sent for a cock Shama. When I received
the bird I noticed that his legs were rough and scaly, and I
remember feeling annoyed, thinking that I had received an old
bird. However, whatever his age may have been at that time,
he lived here in perfect health for over sixteen and a half years.
William, 55 as he was called, was a bird of strong character.
I have never seen a larger or finer Shama, though I have met
better songsters. In spring his songs were apt to be more loud
than melodious.

B. G. THOMASSET-A LONG-LIVED SHAMA
For most of his time he lived caged in my sitting-room, enjoying
every day a flight about the house, and occasionally out of doors.
Latterly I had to curtail these outdoor excursions. William was
inclined to wander. He was known to stay out all night and one
day I received a message from a house a little way off: "You
had better fetch your bird. He is eating the cat's dinner."
He spent two seasons with a mate in an outdoor aviary. They
had numerous broods and in all fully reared seven young ones.
One brood followed on the last at such short intervals that many
young ones died from neglect after leaving the nest. When
nesting the parents were often allowed their liberty for part of
the day. They were both charmingly tame and assisted at all
gardening operations.
After two seasons I decided that the rearing of young Shamas
was an all-time job, as they needed such an enormous supply of
insects, and I parted reluctantly with the hen. She was just as
tame and confiding as William, and quite a good singer. By
the by, except in the nesting season the two birds fought like
demons and had to be caged separately. When the hen was
let out she would fly first to the cock's cage and enjoy a set-to
through the bars, then to a brass bowl to tilt at her reflection. She
would stab the brass so hard that I used to fear that she would
injure her beak.
My old bird was in full moult when he died. It must have
been a strain each year to grow his magnificent yj-inch tail. He
did not seem to be ill, and his appetite was as good as ever. For
the last two or three days of his life, whenever he saw me, he
fluttered about his cage, asking to be let out. When out he would
at once perch on me, and only seemed happy on my shoulder
or arm. Poor old fellow, evidently he knew that something was
wrong. Finally, one morning, I found him sitting in a ball on
the cage bottom. I spoke to him. He hopped along the cage,
rolled over, and died. It really seemed that he had waited to bid
me good-bye.

By A. Martin
(By kind permission of W. L. Eaves, Esq.)
During the early part of 1939 I took over the management of
Mr. Eaves' collection of birds, and I found amongst this collection
a very fine pair of the above Parrakeets. They were housed in
a large flight measuring 25 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet, with a 6 foot
shelter attached. They were in perfect condition, and of course
I wished them to nest. So with the help of my employer we placed
a natural tree trunk in their flight. The cock came into breeding
condition much sooner than the hen, and it was a pleasing sight
to see him display. This is a most spirited and amusing per-
formance, jerking his head up and down as though controlled by
an invisible wire from above, and at the same time erecting a
tiny shield of feathers on his forehead and contracting the pupils of
his orange-coloured eyes. It was not until late in May that the
hen took the slightest notice of him, and even then when in the
mood would drive him away. However, during the last few days
of May the hen began visiting the nesting site, four eggs were laid
and she commenced to sit. I read in an article that you should
move away the cock while the hen is sitting, I decided, however,
not to do so, as I was certain she could take good care of herself.
A month later I heard the unmistakable cries of young Parrakeets,
but I never had the chance of getting a look, because I think it is
the best policy to leave these birds alone when on the nest, and
I could never catch her off for a long time. When at last I was
lucky enough, I found two young nearly feathered and two clear
eggs, one of the young left the nest several days before the other ;
both of them were good healthy birds strong on the wing. A second
clutch was laid before the young were able to fend for themselves,
and I was rather worried as to how they would fare, as the cock
made not the slightest effort to help feed. As a matter of fact,
he seemed quite scared when they approached him, and would
instantly fly away. I need not, however, have worried for the

hen proved quite capable of looking after them herself. The second
clutch contained three eggs, but only one hatched out, two being
dead in the shell, the odd young one, however, grew quite fast
and left the nest quite strong. I now noticed a very amusing and
interesting thing, the young of the first nest would try to feed the
younger offspring ; it was a pretty sight to see them all together,
and when I entered their enclosure they liked nothing better than
to settle on my head and shoulders and take small titbits out of
my hand. These beautiful Parrakeets are natives of Central
Australia to Western Australia. They are sometimes called Queen
Alexandra's, but I prefer the first of these names, Princess of Wales,
for no other Parrakeet has quite the charm and elegance of this
beautiful bird. To those who have never seen this bird, I would
refer them to the beautiful plate by Ronald Green that appeared
in the May, 1935, Magazine.

over thirty years. It seems impossible to imagine the London Zoo without
Mr. Seth-Smith, so much has he identified himself with the Society. His ready
willingness to give advice and assistance, and his charming personality will be
missed more than a little by scientists, students, and animal lovers who visit
the Gardens. Though Mr. Seth-Smith will no longer be living in London, his
activities in the zoological world will be by no means curtailed, and with more
leisure at his disposal there is no doubt that the Avicultural Magazine and
other periodicals will benefit by an increase in his contributions.
The Queen Alexandra Parrakeet
Few species of birds have had to submit to so much name changing as has
that charming Parrakeet which Gould, in 1862, named Polytelis alexandra.
In 1895 Alfred J. North discovered that, in the male, the third primary feather
was spatulated, and, on this frail difference, created for it the genus Spathopterus
which stood until Gregory Mathews, finding that this name was preoccupied,
created yet another, Northipsitta.
Gould named the species after the then Princess of Wales and it was popularly
known as the " Princess of Wales' Parrakeet ", but when the Princess became
Queen the bird became known as the " Queen Alexandra Parrakeet ", a name
that, we suggest, should be retained.

By J. Delacour
For the last thirty years I have hardly been without Sunbirds
in my cages and aviaries ; that is to say almost ever since Mr. A.
Ezra had found a practical way of feeding them on a mixture of
honey, milk and Mellin's food diluted in water, a method which
has never been much improved upon, although some aviculturists
have slightly varied the composition. He and the late Marquis de
Segur are responsible for the usual addition of these beautiful
birds as well as of Humming-birds to our collections.
I may add that I have also been fortunate enough to watch
at liberty and to collect myself a good many different species in
Asia and in Africa, so that I can venture, perhaps, to recall here
a few essential points regarding them.
Sunbirds are entirely an old-world family and have no relatives
in America, which is occupied by the very different Sugar-birds
and Humming-birds. They live in tropical lands, although many
species are found in chilly high ground ; one (Daby's) reaches
Central China, and two others are found in Egypt and in Palestine.
To the south-east they extend to Northern Australia, New Guinea,
and adjacent islands, and the Philippines. While a number of
species haunt damp forests, more inhabit drier jungle, park-like
country, and some even gardens. They are active and fearless little
birds, very pugnacious and quarrelsome, although one sometimes
meets with large flocks of them during the winter on flowering
trees ; it is a beautiful sight which one never forgets. Their natural
diet consists of insects and of the nectar of flowers, sometimes also
of the sugary juice of certain fruit and berries. In captivity, strange

<bodyText confidence="0.999308692307692" page_id="56314286"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
as it may first appear, they live indefinitely on the well-known
mixture mentioned above, which has been often described in this
magazine, with a little sweet grapes or orange, which brings them
the necessary vitamins. A Purple Sunbird lived twenty-two years
on such a diet at Woburn, and I have kept several well over ten
years.
Like many others I have repeatedly tried to keep several
Sunbirds together. With the exception of mated pairs it invariably
fails, the end being the slaughter of all the weaker birds by the
strongest and fiercest ones, no matter whether they inhabit a
large flight or greenhouse, thickly planted, or a small aviary and
cage ; whether there are a few or a large number together (this last
process being successful with Humming-birds and other groups also,
as long as birds of equal strength and size are associated). As
usual, all goes well in the beginning when the birds first arrive
and are not feeling very fit or very much at home. But after a
few weeks or months when they have settled down, particularly
after the moult, they begin to fight and must be isolated one by one,
or in pairs, if murders are to be avoided. Their wickedness and
persistence are astonishing. One can usually associate a male
Sunbird, or a pair, with other birds of the same or rather larger
size. But they often are dangerous to weaker birds, especially Sugar
birds, sometimes also Humming-birds, small Finches, Tanagers,
etc. It is safer to keep them either separate or with decidedly
stronger, though not spiteful, companions. Of course, some species
of Sunbirds are much quieter than others and this must be taken
into consideration. Undoubtedly it is safer to isolate Sunbirds
in cages where they prove very satisfactory in every way, especially
as many can be trained to come out into the room and go back
to their home again. But I must confess that they look at their
best among leaves and flowers in a well planted greenhouse or
outdoor aviary during the summer. Also species with red and yellow
in their plumage, particularly the Scarlet JEthopyga (the Yellow-
backed Red Sunbird being the best known of them), will only
keep their brilliant hues after a moult in captivity if they have a
free range with a natural supply of tiny insects and blooms. I
have had remarkable results at Cleres in the greenhouses, while
different Red Sunbirds not only remained for several years as
brilliant as could be, but some attained their bright adult plumage

after arriving in immature olive-grey dress. In cages the same species
lose all trace of red and become a dull yellow after their first
moult.
Many systematic ornithologists have divided Oriental and
Ethiopian Sunbirds into many genera, most unnecessary in my
opinion. In Africa, Asia and Australasia all square-tailed Sunbirds
can be ascribed to the genera Cinnyris , Anthreptes and Arachnothera,
the characters invoked to separate the genera Chalcomitra , Cyano -
mitra, Leptocoma , etc's. . . . being negligible.
In the pointed-tailed section one finds in Africa the beautiful
Nectarinia, the genera Anthohaphes and Hedydipna being of doubtful
value and probably better considered as subgenera. In Asia and
Malaysia they belong to the genus AEthopyga , the rather peculiar
Mangrove Sunbird being separated as Chalcostetha.
A great many species of Sunbirds have been imported to Europe
during the last twenty years from the different parts of their range,
many of marvellous beauty. But perhaps none can surpass the
two larger Cinnyris which were brought a few years ago from
West Africa by Mr. C. S. Webb. The size of a Siskin, they both
are rather similar in colour. The Splendid ( Cinnyris coccinigaster)
is figured on the adjoining plate. It is a commonplace to say
that its beauty is " indescribable " ; but it has the advantage of
saving one the trouble of describing it. The Superb Sunbird
(C. superbus) differs mostly in its plain dark red breast, its straighter
bill, and its longer, slimmer shape. While the Superb is an inhabi-
tant of damp forests, the Splendid lives in drier savanna country.
They both are birds of hot climates. I never had a chance of obtain-
ing a Superb Sunbird, but the few which I have seen in the hands
of Mr. Ezra and the Hon. Anthony Chaplin did not look very
happy in cages, their plumage getting frayed and dry and their
colours tarnished. Evidently this damp forest species requires the
moist hot atmosphere of a stove house, and I regret the more so
not to have been able to try it in my tropical aviaries. I had for
several years a Splendid Sunbird in one of the latter. It proved
strong but harmless to other birds, taking no notice of a small Red
Sunbird and of several Humming-birds, which he probably con-
sidered too insignificant to bother about.
The Splendid Sunbird ( Cinnyris coccinigaster) inhabits the whole
of West Africa, from Senega* to the Congo, while the Superb

The initiative and enterprise of the Directors and Editor of
Cage Birds in carrying on the National Cage Bird Show was more
than amply rewarded, there being no less than 5,041 entries, beating
the record of 1936 by 131. As Sir Henry Buckland said at the
lunch on the opening day, the Show was an example of that
British pluck which was to be expected. The whole Exhibition
was full of instruction, and every exhibit would please every
member of the public. Sir Charles Howell Thomas, Chairman
of the Red Cross Agriculture Fund, also complimented the
organizers on their courage, an effort which was greatly benefiting
the world's greatest war fund. Mr. Haddon, Director of Cage Birds
and Chairman of the Organizing Committee, paid a special
tribute to the judges who had all given their services without fee,
and also drew attention to the great work of the stewards. During
the course of the speeches it was announced that #350 had already
been collected for the Red Cross Fund, and Mr. Haddon remarked
that he hoped before the Exhibition was ended this figure would
be even further increased.
In the entries which, including teams, totalled 5,700 birds,
though in numbers Canaries predominated, all other classes
were well represented.
Foreign Birds.
In this section there were many beautiful and rare species,
and, as usual, Mr. Ezra, President of the Avicultural Society,
secured many successes, one of the most interesting being his Red-
tailed Laughing Thrushes, which were brought to this country
for the first time by Mr. Delacour from Indo-China last year.
Among seed-eating birds were some beautiful specimens of
Lavender Finches owned by Mr. E. Reavill and Mr. H. Mitchell,
and Mr. H. Underwood's Javan Maja Mannikins, and Mr. V. T.
Long's White-headed Mannikins were also prizewinners. Rainbow

Buntings (H. Underwood), Munia quinticolour (A. Ezra), Virginian
Cardinals (W. Fosbrook), Red-headed Gouldian Finches (S. M.

prizewinners.
Of softbills Mr. E. F. Benjamin's Shama was the best in a
strong class, and Mr. E. J. Z. Marshall won the first prize for a
beautiful New Zealand Zosterops. Mr. G. P. Flint's Fanny's
Tanager and Mr. K. M. Scamell's Green Tanagers well deserved
the place given them as leaders of their class, and other beautiful
species which were awarded prizes were Mr. Ezra's Baud's Pitta,
Mr. E. C. Hildred's Hunting Cissa, and Mr. N. G. Allison's
Golden-capped Troupial. Mr. Ezra's Garnet-throated and Alice's
Pigmy Emerald Humming Birds stood alone in their class, and
were a striking example of his success in keeping these delicate
birds. His fine Regent Bower Bird was also the sole occupant
of its class. -r. o
Parrots.
To obtain an entry of nearly fifty birds in the four classes for
Parrot-like species was, I think, very good going under present
conditions. Some of the birds were specially attractive, and
Mr. Tom Goodwin who judged them must have had some
difficulty in placing his awards, but made a very excellent job
of it, although personally there were one or two alterations I should
have made.
In Class 304 for Lovebirds and Parrotlets there was an entry
of eight, first prize going to Mr. P. Alderson's pair of Abyssinian
Lovebirds, of which there were two pairs exhibited. These birds
are seldom imported and breed very rarely in confinement. A pair
of West African Lovebirds were second, belonging to Mr. R. Best,
with a nice pair of Fischer Lovebirds taking third place belonging
to H. and Miss J. R. Buckland. A very nice pair of Tui Parrakeets
were also exhibited by Mr. P. Alderson, and possibly these were
not placed higher as there may have been some doubt as to whether
they were in the wrong class. One most interesting entry in this
class deserves mention, a lutinistic Fischer Lovebird exhibited
by Mr. Percy Glover. Unfortunately it was in the wrong class,
as it should have been entered in the class for abnormally coloured
foreign birds.

Class 305 for Grass Parrakeets was almost entirely covered by
Mr. Norman Dixon's team of birds. A pair of Splendids were
first, Elegants second, Turquoisines third, and Bourkes fourth,
all of which belonged to Mr. Dixon. One other pair of Bourkes
completed the class, and there was very little to choose between
either pair, which were both nice. I would have preferred to see
the Elegants head the class on their condition, although one had
a slightly defective hind claw, whereas the Splendids when I saw
them were both decidedly heavy, and the cock had several small
quill feathers showing, whilst the hen had an overgrown beak.
On condition also I should have been inclined to place the
Turquoisines above the Splendids.
The Class for all other species of Parrakeets contained some
very fine specimens. First prize and special went to our President,
Mr. Alfred Ezra, for a pair of Princess of Wales. They were in
beautiful condition, and the award was most well deserved.
Mr. Harlow's Derbyan Parrakeet was second, and a very fine
pair of Crimson Wings of exceptionally large size belonging to
Mr. H. J. Indge were third. A Javan Little Hanging Parrakeet
belonging to Mr. H. Underwood took fourth prize, but had no
opportunity in its Show Cage of hanging from the top in its
characteristic attitude. A pair of Adelaide Parrakeets took V.H.C.,
but these birds were shown in a cage much too small for them,
and could not do justice to themselves. A pair of Ringnecks
were H.C., and a very fine Barnard completed the winners. I could
not understand why this bird was not placed higher, and felt
rather sorry that a magnificent pair of Red-collared Lorikeets
were not among the cards, as they were in beautiful condition and
looked very handsome. Several people remarked about the deep
colour on their abdomen.
In the class for Parrots there was a magnificent pair of Hyacin-
thine Macaws belonging to Mr. J. A. Avery, which easily headed
the class. The rest of the prizes were awarded to Mr. H. T. Batt's
birds. This exhibitor was showing his extensive team of large
Parrot-like species, which included various Cockatoos such as

British Birds.
The British birds made a good showing, and varied in size
from a Cornish Chough to a Dartford Warbler. The aviary-bred
birds were very pleasing to the eye, and it was gratifying to note
the different species that are the results of three or four generations
of aviary breeding. Furthermore, several of the winners in the
open classes (it must be remembered that special classes are
provided) were also of aviary breeding, and in the majority of
cases beat older birds. The avicultural world also owes Mr. A. H.
Scott a debt of gratitude for his breeding of rare feathered birds
in such a manner that they can be bred true to type. His
Greenfinches were represented at the show, such as Lutinos and
Fawn White. I believe he has also bred Silver Fawn Greenfinches,
but, as yet, I have not had the pleasure of seeing one.
The special prize for the best aviary-bred was won by a
Brambling, whilst a Bullfinch, Yellow Bunting, and a hen Lutino
Greenfinch won their respective classes.
In the other classes I think the rarest hardbilled bird (to my
mind, at any rate) was a Girl Bunting, and a beautiful specimen
at that. The Bunting family was well represented, including Reed,
Corn, Snow, and Yellow. All these birds settle well and get
very tame, with the exception of the Corn Bunting. It is only
possible to tame these by hand rearing and I concluded, by the
way they opened their mouths and called when one placed one's
finger in front of the cage, that all those at the show had been
reared thus.
The best British hardbill prize was awarded to a beautiful
Hawfinch, as tame a bird as one could wish to see. I think the
Hawfinch is one of our most majestic birds and makes an ideal pet.
Strangely enough, in the wild state, they are one of the shyest
birds, and are rarely seen at close quarters. They have a very
distinctive call, very high pitched, and one often hears this call
in beech woods, about the time of year the beech masts are ripening.
Another denizen of the woods represented at the Show was a
Crossbill, singing for all it was worth. What a pity this bird does
not keep its red plumage when in an aviary. It moults out a very
ugly green--ugly in comparison to its original red.
The softbills were well represented in species, but not in
quantities. Some of the larger species were Choughs, Magpies,

Greater Spotted Woodpecker, Fieldfare, Ring Ouzel, Blackbirds,
Thrushes (both Song and Missel), Jay, and Starlings. The smaller
softbills were Dartford Warblers, Sedge Warbler, Bearded
Reedlings, Nuthatch, Blackcaps, Yellow and Grey Wagtails,
Tree Pipit, and Hedge Sparrow.
A Dartford Warbler won a class and it is one of the best I've
seen, being an adult cock in perfect plumage. It was staged to a
nicety and every credit is due to the owner for keeping such a bird
in such beautiful condition. They are related very closely to the
Hedge Sparrow (or Hedge Accentor) in many ways, such as the
colour of the eye (pink) and also song. I derived as much pleasure

Budgerigars.
As the best birds are mostly in the champion classes, naturally
all the cream of the section usually comes from these, however
I did not see a better adult Green than the winner of the Novice
Light Green class. This bird was a very fine one in every way,
and was much admired.
Another Green, the one judged to be the best 1939 champion
young bird, was one of the finest youngsters ever benched.
Exceptional in size, head, mask, it was indeed a most outstanding
exhibit. It has been out at five or six shows this season, and has
won everything before it with consumate ease.
There was a huge collection of birds on view, and whilst there
were some magnificent specimens, taken on a whole, it is question-
able if the average quality was up to previous years. Quite a lot
of the exhibits suffered from lack of preparation. Whether it was
that some exhibitors had been hindered by the frost from getting
their birds into true show condition I cannot say, but it was
generally agreed that there was a tendency to a lack of preparation
in many of the exhibits. Quite a lot, no doubt, out of patriotic
reasons, took birds out of their flights knowing full well that the
exhibits were not really fit, but were determined to swell the
entries and therefore help the Red Cross by so doing. Neverthe-

less, all these birds were a sight for sore eyes, and the leaders
were fine examples of the modern show bird.
The most interesting class to me is always the " any other
colour ". In this class go all those birds for which there is no
set class staged. Therefore all the rarer and newer varieties
are to be seen here. This year an Opaline Cobalt of vivid colour
won. In such a class as this the personal taste of the Judge is likely
to have some bearing, as it is very difficult to make really true
allowances for all the various colours and varieties, one against
another. In this class were to be seen also Yellow-faced, Greys,
Violets, etc., together with one or two birds which as yet have
not been named. One bird appeared to have the characteristics
of both the Opaline and Yellow-face, yet the owner told me that
it had appeared from the straight blue, and up to its first moult
remained to all outward appearance normal, and when the moult
was complete, it developed the characteristics I have just
enumerated.
In the red-eyed classes there were some fine examples of the
Lutino on view. These birds now being benched consist of two
distinct groups. One which is sex-linked, the other which breeds
normally. Some people lean to the idea that the normal breeding
variety produces the best coloured exhibits, but great strides have
recently been made in the sex-linked varieties, and to-day I have
seen sex-linked exhibits of a colour that will favourably compare
with anything the other variety could produce.
As a matter of fact it is interesting to remark that I happen
to know that this year's winner comes from sex-linked stock.

1939 BREEDING SEASON AT LEGKFORD

1939 was, on the whole, a very good breeding year in Mr. Spedan
Lewis's collection at Leckford, although we had one or two major
disappointments.
The pair of Kagus, which live in about an acre of woodland,
laid an egg on 10th May, but unfortunately one of the pair stabbed
it. The egg was about the size of a Turkey's, the ground colour
was a light stone, and the mottling was of slate and black in large
blotches, chiefly at the larger end.
On the eleventh the pair of Native Companion Cranes laid a
single egg which they incubated in vain for thirty-five days, when
I took it away. About a week later they built a second nest of
turfs and laid their second egg, both parents took turns in sitting
and sat far more steadily than the Mexican Sandhills, who
immediately left the nest to attack anyone who came in sight. The
chick hatched on 2nd July, a smokey fawnish grey little chap, with
a sandy head and neck. We fed them on soaked biscuit and
chopped bullock's heart, which was the way Mr. Milligan, the
head aviary attendant, had very successfully reared the young
Sandhills the previous year. Unfortunately the chick developed
gapes and, in spite of treatment with aniodole, it died on 16th July.
The parents were then moved to another pen to moult. Much
to our surprise they built a third nest, and the egg was laid on
16th August. This hatched on 20th September. The weather
was alternately wet or sunny, with ground frosts at night, and
we had little hope of rearing the chick. However, when I was
called up on 6th December I left a fine fledged youngster almost
as big as its parents.
Cranes are a most delightful family of highly individualistic
birds. All our species dance a good deal, with the exception of the
Hooded, which are at present very wild. Apart from the dancing,
most species have special display poses. The native Companion
male has a slow stilted walk which ends in his suddenly simul-
taneously throwing his wings right back and his head right down,
and then quickly back again ; this action is accompanied by a
deep internal rumbling.

T. JONES-1939 BREEDING SEASON AT LECKFORD 67
In the Asiatic White's display the male puts his beak on the
floor between his feet and then suddenly swings it up and into his
shoulder plumes on the side nearest his mate or rival, at the same
time dropping the black flights of the same wing. In this position
he remains for quite a time, often as long as half a minute.
One other pair of Cranes laid quite unexpectedly, a pair of
White-necks. We found a nest containing two eggs, like huge Gull's
eggs, on 29th May.
The pair were, however, fearfully nervous, although normally
quite steady. These eggs had vanished a week later.
Our adult Cranes, excepting the Stanleys, Crowned, and
Demoiselles, have a fair amount of meat as well as their biscuit
and grain. Those in the water meadows have fish and the others
meat-scraps. This is thrown into the streams out of the way of
Crows and other thieves.
Three species of Swans built nests, and two species bred. The
Whoopers only built a nest and got no further. The Blacks reared
five ; both sexes incubated. The Black-necked hatched three, but
lost one accidentally when it was quite large. The Swans get a
barrowfull of weed between the three pairs each day, besides
some mash and grain. Water celery and watercress are two
favourites, and on those the young were largely reared.
With each pair of Swans we had a pair of the more quarrelsome
Geese or Sheld-duck. With the Black Swans were a pair of
Egyptian Geese. These, curiously, nested right beside the Black
Swans' nest, and the Egyptian gander frequently stood on guard
over his mate by standing up on the rim of the Swans' nest beside
the sitting Swan. Yet there never was the slightest quarrel.
The Whoopers had a pair of Magellan with them, but the
gander fought the male Whooper and had his wing badly broken
at the shoulder. When I saw him I drove him into the next pen,
which contained two female Manchurian Cranes, while I went to
get a bandage to tie up his wing. On returning I found he had
chased one of the Cranes till she was exhausted, and having got
her on the ground had taken most of the skin off her neck and
would have killed her.
We reared over three hundred waterfowl, amongst the more
unusually bred being Wandering, Red-billed, and Eyton X Fulvous
Tree Ducks ; Lesser Scaup. Amongst the Geese the following

were reared : Emperor, Greater and Blue Snow, Bernicle, Ashy-
headed, Ruddy-headed, and Abyssinian. Altogether thirteen
species of Geese laid, but two species had only clear eggs, these
were the Ross's Snow and the White-cheeked. The fact that the
Greater Snow nested about six weeks after being sent to us by
Mr. Sibley from America is, I think, worth recording.
We had considerable difficulty in keeping in good health both
Barrow's Goldeneye and Eider. I do not know whether chalk
streams with their heavily weeded waters are dangerous for these
species or not. Eventually, after losing a couple of Goldeneyes
and a young male Eider, I thought I would try soaking their
biscuit in very salt water. At first I used ordinary cooking salt,
which was perfectly satisfactory and the birds ceased to cause us
any more worry. When the Kelp Geese came I got sea salt for
them, and also powdered kelp ; the Eiders and Goldeneye now
have this salt together with a little of the kelp, and are still in
perfect condition.
We started to try keeping some full-winged Duck about the
place, and so we left some full-winged Carolina, Red-billed Tree
Duck, and Cinnamon Teal. The first two species are so far a
failure, as they never fly at all, but the Cinnamons are charming
and fly a good deal, and have somehow managed to entice a
strange male to settle with us. There are miles of suitable water
for Ducks, yet these birds have all stayed. The full-winged Tufted
have increased rapidly owing to settlers, and always live in the pen
till flight-time.
Amongst the rarer Pheasants reared were four species of
Tragopan, Satyr, Blyth, Cabot, and Temminck ; Palowan
Peacock Pheasants, Monals, and Ceylon Jungle-fowl. An Imperial
chick was hatched, but not reared, and our only baby Rheinardt's
Argus chick escaped and was lost when quite large.
Of our four and a half pairs of Bulwer's Pheasant, two males
have been displaying in the late evenings from September onwards,
one regularly so. The display position of the pair seems to be
head to tail. The female is usually completely bored, and only
when she has passed does the male move. Like lightning he turns
about, dashes up to the female, and turns about again and then
remains still till she has again walked by. This manoeuvre is so
rapid that at first one is only struck by the two flashes of the white

tail as the bird does his two turns. The position of the tail, wattles,
and horns was excellently portrayed in a coloured plate in the
Magazine. The plate also brought out the extraordinary flat
appearance of the bird's body. I never saw either male try to make
a rustling noise with his lower tail feathers, the only times the tail
was moved was when the bird about turned. I was particularly
struck by the lightness and the vividness of the blue of the horns,
face, and wattles.
Among our Owls is a hen Savigny's Eagle Owl, which laid
and sat on her clear egg. The pair of Milky Eagle Owls made a
nest and sat for ages on a stone. This pair has been a good time
in captivity, and has laid fertile eggs when in Mr. Lewis's original
collection. In the interim they have been at the Zoo, and we rather
wondered whether we had got the same pair of birds back again,
as the small " male " was the one who did the bulk of the sitting
this year. I had had great hopes for 1940 so far as breeding Owls
was concerned, as our collection was greatly increased in 1939.
We got a most beautiful male Bay Wood Owl (Phodilus badius)
from Mr. Shaw Mayer, and later we got a female from the London
Zoo. This latter bird has a cataract on one eye and was very dirty,
but the two birds were placed in an indoor cage and became great
friends. We also have acquired a female Snowy Owl from the
Zoo as a mate for our bird. Mr. Whitley gave Mr. Lewis a female
Sumatran Eagle Owl, and we have had a male, which has been
in Miss Chawner's care for many years, sent up to the aviaries.
One of my vividest memories of my first days at Leckford is
of Miss Ghawner chopping up rabbits and rats in a hot run,
surrounded by scores of wasps and bluebottles. Owls, I decided,
were not my cup of tea, but slowly I got more and more intrigued
by their beauty and curious ways, till they became one of the
favourite families. Then one gets used to anything, even the
attendant host of bluebottles and wasps. Owls have one further
advantage, they seem to live for ever.
The Band-tailed Pigeons were a disappointment to me. " Pigeons
and such muck " are not very popular at Leckford, but I am told
my tastes are of a low standard, and so I am allowed a few just to
keep up my enthusiasm. The Band-tails laid seven times during
the season. On the first three occasions they built their own nest,
but as soon as the single egg was laid it fell through the bottom

of the nest. I built a very fine nest with the aid of plenty of sticks
and string, but the pair laid on the rim, and that was that. One
of the men then cut out a rook's nest for me. I then thought we
should win, but for some reason the pair deserted when the egg
was chipped. The sixth came to nothing, and while the pair
were sitting on their seventh egg the cock was killed by a rat.
The Bronze-wings reared five, and the Brush Bronze-wings two,
one of which was killed. The Ashy Doves had two young which
left the nest but died, and then in the autumn reared another.
This was a fine strong chick, but the weather turned cold and
I brought the trio indoors, against Mr. Milligin's advice. The
youngster would not feed itself and died ; the weather then became
milder immediately. Quite a few Galapagos Doves were reared ;
these are charmingly tame little birds ever on the move, but with
a much weaker flight than any of the other Pigeons we have kept.
The Mountain Witches reared four fine strong babies ; their nest
was well off the ground in a shallow box, and the young did not
leave it till well grown. I never saw the eggs.
The Red Mountain Doves laid late in the autumn two deep
buff-coloured eggs. The Spectacled Thrushes stole the first and
the second contained a dead chick. Our Red Mountains are
extraordinarily tame, and will allow one to touch them when they
are sitting on a perch.
Both the Red Mountain and the Mountain Witches are very
fond of mealworms, as is our odd male Bartlett's Bleeding Heart.
The Plumed Ground Doves laid once, but a mouse got their eggs.
All the species of Doves and Pigeons get roughly the same
mixture--canary, millet, hemp, wheat, dari, kibbled maize, and
chopped peanuts. This last item all, with the sole exception of the
Diamond Doves, are extremely fond of, and I think is a very
necessary food.

There seems to be few records of the Corncrake being kept as
an aviary bird, so perhaps I might be permitted to offer a few
lines regarding a tame bird just deceased.
Some years ago I had an aviary attendant who lived a con-
siderable distance away, and had to make a journey each day by both
train and cycle. One day whilst cycling to his work he picked up
off the road an adult Corncrake. The bird had no apparent
injury and made no resistance to being picked up, so my man put
it in his pocket and brought it to me.
I felt sure that the bird must have sustained some internal
injury, otherwise it would be difficult to account for its behaviour.
We thought we would keep it a day or two just to see if there really
was anything wrong with it, so it was placed in a large aviary with
a pair of Argus Pheasants and a few odd Partridges and Pigeons
of various species.
The next day the bird was taking mealworms from our fingers
and from then to the day of its death it never evinced the slightest
fear of human beings. It was a delightfully quiet and unobtrusive
little bird, never courting attention unless one wished it. One had
only to take a few mealworms and go into the aviary, crouch down,
and in a few seconds our little friend would quietly slip out of the
undergrowth and come between one's knees and look knowingly
up into one's face, waiting for his reward. I never saw a bird take
a titbit more gently from one's finger than he did.
He--I say " he ", but I have no idea to which sex the bird
belonged, and the manner of its death made it impossible to
ascertain--was always in perfect feather except that he got scalped
once or twice. I rather think he was frightened at night by either
owls or cats.
The bird ate the food provided for the Argus Pheasants, pheasant
corn containing small seeds, millet and canary, and soft food with
which we mixed cut up banana and grapes. I saw the bird eating
the small seeds but occasionally ; he lived mainly on the soft food
and was fond of the banana. We used to give him about six
mealworms a day.
Heat and cold seemed to trouble him little, and though he had

access to a heated shed he never seemed to use it. Every day winter
and summer he stood for hours in the water pot just apparently
soaking his feet. This was rather annoying, as he used to foul the
water.
All the time we had him he never made a sound and not once
did we hear him emit the well known call ; for this we were
rather thankful, for I have youthful memories of nights spent in
the Peak District of Derbyshire, which were made sleepless by the
dreadfully monotonous nocturnal cries of these birds. No bird's
call can be more exasperating than this one's, especially if uttered
hour after hour unceasingly only a few yards from one's bedroom
window. I would gladly have shot the birds in those days had I
ever been able to find them.
No bird in a wild state is more elusive than the Corncrake,
and no matter how we tried we could never find one. Its cries
certainly have ventriloquial properties for, as soon as we seemed
to have traced the bird by its calls in one corner of the field, it
seemed to be calling in the other. Very few humans ever seem able
to get really near to this will-o'-the-wisp of a bird. I have asked
many bird-lovers and aviculturists who have visited my aviaries
if they know what species my bird was, and only one, a keen British
bird photographer, ever recognized it. Most people said, " Oh,
I suppose its a rare kind of foreign Rail " !
Unfortunately the Corncrake has now died out from most parts
of Britain, and one seldom if ever hears its once familiar call.
Many theories have been advanced regarding its disappearance,
but why it really went we shall never know. Quite possibly it
may return, as sometimes happens when a bird disappears by other
than human agency.
A few weeks ago after having had my little friend for several
years, my aviary attendant brought me its skin, a rat had got
into the aviary and had eaten his entire inside, and so I lost one
of the most interesting and charming little birds I have ever kept ;
utterly fearless yet most unobtrusive, he would only come to you
if you wanted him to, after you had spoken to him or given him a
mealworm he would vanish as quietly and unobtrusively as he
had come.
I am afraid I will never be able to replace him, for you cannot
pick Corncrakes up off the road every day !

(Continued from p. 37.)
As a contrast to the Goldfinch and Bullfinch, more particularly
in size and drabness in colour perhaps, the Linnet, Redpoll, and
Twite come to my mind, and three more delightful and easily bred
British birds one would have great difficulty to find. Older fanciers
than myself may perhaps have seen Redpolls working hard,
drawing up their own seed and water within reach in fanciful
cages, in nearly every birdshop and stall several years ago.
This in itself shows the great intelligence and ingenuity of this
particular species, and they are extremely attractive birds because
of this intelligence.
The Twite or Mountain Linnet is more or less rare, especially
in the southern part of the British Isles. I have heard of cases
of lighthouse keepers in the north of Scotland keeping them as
pets and treating them generally up there as the Londoner treats
his or her sparrows !
The Linnet, of course, everyone knows and in the summer it
can be seen and heard along every hedgerow. In many ways it
is totally different from the Twite, although the latter is called
Mountain Linnet. Their calls, songs, feeding methods, their
colourings and their markings are totally different and yet in a
way they resemble each other in inexplicable ways.
In the wild state the Linnet nests in small bushes and low thick
hedges about four to five feet from the ground. The Twite nests
on the ground in stumps of heather, whilst the Redpoll nests in
trees or high hedges. In captivity, however, they are adaptable
enough to use more or less the same type of sites that are provided.
The Twite and Linnet prefer to nest on ledges made either by wire
netting or by wooden batons at varying heights above the ground,
with a good base of grass, twigs, and evergreens stuck in to form
some cover. The Redpoll, however, prefers an isolated bush high
up in the aviary (for one's own personal reasons, however, it is
best not to arrange the sites too high, otherwise the joy of seeing
the birds in their parental duties will be lost), and builds a most
attractive little nest, well lined and strongly built.

V. A. V. CARR-BREEDING BRITISH BIRDS
The eggs of all these species are very similar in design, although
naturally those of the Redpoll are a lot smaller. If one is in doubt
with regard to the fertility of the eggs it is best to make sure after
about the fifth day, and if the results are disappointing it is
advisable to pull the nest out and allow the parents to have another
attempt.
Linnets make good mothers and their desires for wild foods to
feed their young are easily satisfied. Any seeding plant that is in
season is very acceptable ; also sprouting seeds of most varieties
that Linnets appreciate in the dry state (made to sprout by
soaking seed in water for a day and then allowing to drain dry
again, by which time little green shoots begin to appear). Rearing
Redpolls perhaps may be a bit more difficult in view of the live
food that it is advisable to provide, if only in small quantities.
As regards the Twite rearing I may have exaggerated when I
mentioned above that they come under the " easily bred " category.
They are not easily reared , proven by experience, and need live food
practically the whole of the time, otherwise the subsidiary food-
stuffs can be the same as those mentioned above.
The Siskin, a very pretty little chap and more colourful than
the aforementioned three, builds a very similar nest to the Redpoll,
and for rearing youngsters is the same as the Twite. The parent
birds are proper little gluttons, feeding all the time and getting
very fat, hence their slowness in going to nest. If, on the other
hand, they are in a large aviary, getting plenty of exercise and
not too much hemp seed, they will nest as readily as any Canary.
The British Bird Breeders' Association has done a lot towards
the advancement of British bird breeding, and anyone who intends
taking up this delightful hobby would be well advised to join.
There are a lot of birds that have not been reared , but certainly
hatched successfully, and anyone who can breed in captivity any
of these species would make our hobby as a whole a lot richer.
Once a strain of aviary bred birds has been started, the standard
and simplicity is undoubtedly improved.

Six coloured plates and a large number of black and white
illustrations, including several excellent wash drawings by Hubert
Astley, appear in the volume of the Magazine for 1913 which,
as usual, commences in November of the previous year. J. L.
Bonhote, who had acted as editor since 1910, retired at the end of
1912, and Hubert D. Astley succeeded him.
A coloured plate of the Ringed Teal (Anas torquata ) illustrates
an article recording the first arrival of this beautiful species in the
London Zoo in 1911, this being, probably, its first appearance in
Great Britain. W. E. Teschemaker contributes a delightful article
on the nesting of the Whinchat in his aviaries in Devonshire. He
was extraordinarily successful with those British species that most
of us would regard as difficult, to say the least of it. His aviary
contained a male and two females and, although only one of the
latter nested, the second helped to rear the brood of five, four of
which, when full grown, were allowed to migrate.
Miss Drummond describes the successful breeding in 1912 of
the Grand Eclectus Parrot after several unsuccessful attempts.
Incubation lasted thirty days, during which the hen rarely left the
nest where she was fed by the cock. Two young birds, a male
and a female, were hatched about 12th July, and first made their
appearance outside the nest on 9th October, though retiring
there to sleep until ten days later. The young birds resembled their
parents from the first. Dr. Amsler records the breeding of the
Hooded Siskin ( Chrysomitris cucullatus ).
In W. H. St. Quin tin's Breeding Notes for igi 2 he mentions
never-ending rain and absence of sun during that season, a condition
very unfavourable to the rearing of young of tropical species.
This accounted for his failure to rear young Cabot's Tragopana
and Little Bustards. However, with such hardy birds as Ravens;
and Laughing Kingfishers he had full success. Madagascar
Hemipodes, too, succeeded in rearing two chicks, probably owing
to the foresight of their owner in providing shelter by means of

soon became quite tame, allowing human beings to approach
within ten yards. They arrived in October and were still there
when the account was written in the following January.
A very interesting article on " The Capercaillie at Home " in
Siberia, by Martin Cunningham, describes this splendid bird
in its forest home, where it spends its time during the winter in
the pine trees. Only in the warmer weather does it come to the
ground, and it was on one such occasion that the author of the
article discovered two males fighting. So hard were they at it
that, although naturally the shyest of birds, they took no notice of
an approaching human being, and one was caught by hand with-
out difficulty. For two days this bird refused food, but afterwards
started to feed ; but it proved so wild that it was released in the
forest. Young birds were brought in by keepers and were reared
without difficulty, though every attempt to bring them through
the winter failed, as they always suffered from frost-bitten feet.
Our President, Mr. Ezra, gave an account of his Sunbirds, of
which he kept several rare species in those early days, just as he
does now.

of young Ducks, and concludes by saying " if one gave all one's
personal attention to the Duck rearing, I think one would do better
with incubators and foster-mothers than with hens, as the latter
vary so ; a restless hen kills half her Ducks, and many a hen
takes a dislike to having a lot of wet ducklings rushing under her
or standing on her back
About this time we used to breed a good many birds in the
Zoological Gardens, but that was before the many " improvements "
had been made, such as the building of the Mappin Terraces which
ruined the Western Aviary, the new Reptile House which did
away with the Summer Aviary, and the construction of the Monkey
Hill on the site of the Western Duck Pond and Goose Paddocks.
Crested Screamers, White Storks, American Red-winged Starlings,
Blue Porphyrios, Mexican and Douglas Quails, were all reared
successfully.
Astley writes on the Seed Snipe (Thinocorus rumicivorus ), a pair of
which he had obtained, which were imported from Chile by Walter
Goodfellow, together with a number of Chinchillas, for Mrs. John-
stone. They are interesting little birds, reminding one somewhat
of Larks, though of sturdier build. The article is illustrated by a
drawing by Roland Green which shows the black, anchor-shaped
marking on the chest of the male. In a later page Philip Gosse
writes on the species in the wild state, which he met with in the
Andes from the altitude of 10,000 to 13,000 feet. He writes,
" When flushed both birds utter a sharp cry several times in
succession. They look rather like moths with their quiet jerky flight.
For some time I could not make out a noise that would often continue
all night round the camp : a sound somewhat like a frog's croak
without the rough notes. At last I found it to be the Common
Seed Snipe, but was never sure if it called while flying to and fro,
which is what it sounded like. The sound is at any time very
difficult to locate, at first appearing far away and at the next
moment at one's feet."
W. E. Teschemaker's name again appears as the successful
breeder of the White Wagtail and of the Scaly-fronted Finch
(Sporopipes squamifrons ), the latter small South African Weaver
being a species rarely imported in these days. " The Scaly-
fronted Finch," he writes, " is one of the most enthusiastic architects
of all the dome-builders with which I am personally acquainted ;

when it strikes a dull day and cannot think of any other amusement
it sets to work to build a nest ; even an unmated bird will complete
a nest in a couple of days." " The young in the nest," he proceeds,
" are most curious little objects, having large warts of pale cream
colour at the angles of the beak. The task of feeding a family,
which seldom is less than four and sometimes six in number, is a
heavy one, but . . . the task can be greatly lightened if insect food
is liberally supplied."
E. J. Brook writes on the " Nesting of Purple Sunbirds in
Captivity ". A pair of these birds became very aggressive towards
other occupants of the aviary, and demanded the place to them-
selves. " The mated pair of Purples soon set about looking for a
suitable site for their nest. The horizontal part of a long spray
from an orange tree was chosen, and to this the hen tried to fix
some pieces of moss, but seemed to find the bark too smooth to
get a foundation. Noticing her difficulty, I twisted a little sheep's
wool round the branch, and to this foundation she wove a con-
siderable mass of wool and moss, but not finding it to her liking
she pulled it all to pieces again. This she repeated three times.
I then cut a small piece from a bough of dead spruce fir and fastened
it to the place the hen wanted to build from. Nest building now
began in earnest, and soon a mass of sheep's wool, looking like a
large cobweb, was woven in and out of the small twigs of the spray
of spruce. To this web was woven an untidy mass of wool and
moss that hung down about six inches, the end of which was thick
and bulbous and into which the true nest was presently built.
" At this stage I noticed that the hen was restless and again
threatened to undo her work. ... I got some coir thatching cord,
tied three lengths of about six inches each to the branch, and
arranged them in such a way that they hung down with the mass
of wool, touching it at three different places. It was most interesting
to see how the hen immediately took advantage of this by weaving
together the wool and the rough coir fibre. I have said that the
true nest was built into the thick end of the hanging mass of wool.
The hen made a small hollow where she desired to make her nest,
which was entirely built of coco-nut fibre drawn from unravelled
coir rope and lined with tow and a few feathers. A few straggling
ends of fibre projected in an untidy fashion over the top of the
nest and so formed a sort of canopy."

NOTES ON THE CHIRPING NIGHTINGALE
(.Luscinia sihilans ( Swinh .))
By Rudolf Neunzig
In south-east Siberia, as far west as the Jenissei, there lives a
small Ground Warbler, little known to scientific ornithology. It
is found in Sanghalien and migrates in winter to south China and
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99695075" page_id="56314307"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
Hainan. Up to the present only three living specimens of the
Chirping Nightingale-- Luscinia sibilans --which ranks as a rarity
in museums--have been seen in Germany. The first was an
apparent female which arrived in the Bird House of the Zoological
Gardens in Berlin (1934). Two years later a bird dealer in Berlin
received two Chirping Nightingales, unrecognized among many
other Asiatic species. They were a pair, which unfortunately
were not sold together.
According to Stegmann ( Journal f Ornithologie, 1931), this rare
bird lives in the thick undergrowth of its native haunt, especially
where fallen trees have rendered the thicket almost impenetrable.
It lives very concealed there. Its song can be heard about the
middle of May, especially during the morning and evening hours.
According to Stegmann " the song is a loud unmelodious whinnying
trill, so strange that it cannot be mistaken ". In antithesis to
this, Professor O. Neumann told me that on the label of a skin
there was a remark in Russian to the effect that the bird sang
very beautifully on the end cf a branch. The vocal efforts of a
captive Chirping Nightingale differ from both descriptions, as
we shall see later.

80 R. NEUNZIG-NOTES ON THE CHIRPING NIGHTINGALE
I was able for a time to observe one of the two birds last imported.
It was the only male ever seen here. In character it resembled
to a certain extent the larger Calliope--Luscinia calliope. It there-
fore greatly resembled all its related species, such as Nightingales,
Sprossers, or Thrush Nightingale, Blue-throats, and Redstarts.
The Chirping Nightingale is appreciably smaller than all these
species, being about the size of a hen Redstart. The bird was
very lively and gay, and bathed a great deal, always several times
a day. The tail movements were very varied. The bird often
vibrated it like a Redstart, then erected it somewhat in the shape
of a fan. Like most Ground Warblers, it liked to sit on the bottom
of the cage, though it also frequently sat on a short thick branch
or something of that kind. It was fed like a Nightingale. In
colour this species resembled the Sprosser, the throat and feathers
of the crop and breast are bordered with olive brown, so that
these portions of the plumage appear scaled.
The subsequent owner of this bird, Herr Gerbert, reports
on its vocal efforts as follows : "In May I placed another bird
opposite the Chirping Nightingale for a short time. At once the
little fellow commenced a most charming courtship display. Now
he bowed, then he sprang high above the perch, spread his wings,
cocked his little tail and remained in continuous motion. At the
same time he uttered a soft 4 tack tack '. A short time afterwards
he began to sing. The song bears no resemblance to that of our
Nightingale or Sprosser, but is more like that of our Wood Warbler,
a short melodious strophe and then a prolonged trill. My Blue
Throats often call and then the Chirping Nightingale answers
with its sirr-r-r, and then both birds continue with their respective
songs. From July to August the Nightingales moulted quickly
and easily, but up to the present their song has not recommenced .' 9
(September, 1937, in Gef. Welt , 1937.)
The second bird, a female, came into the possession of another
aviculturist in Berlin. This bird showed a great desire to breed
and laid eggs, which naturally in the absence of a male, were
unfertile. This was the first instance of laying by Luscinia sibilans
known to ornithology. In a letter of the 26th July, 1937, the
owner of this Chirping Nightingale wrote to me as follows : 44 As
perhaps you have no eggs of Luscinia sibilans in your collection,
I am sending you enclosed three eggs of my Chirping Nightingale,

which, on account of her dull song I had long thought to be a
female, which were incubated for three weeks by her. The nest
was made in an open nesting-box at a height of about i J m., and
in its form and building resembled those of Redstarts. The
surprising height of the nest for that of a Luscinia is no doubt
due to the fact that there were also in the aviary three Indian
Quails. In the same aviary also a pair of Myrtle Warblers (.Dendroica
coronata (L.) were rearing three young ones, of which two are
apparently males.
The colouring of the eggs of Luscinia sibilans was as follows :
light greenish grey, spotted lightly with reddish brown, not
sufficiently to obscure the ground colour, but more closely massed
at the thicker end of the egg, forming larger patches. Size 19
by 15 mm.
According to my observations, the sexes of Luscinia sibilans can
be distinguished by the colour of the tail-feathers. These are
darker and somewhat redder in the male. However, as already
mentioned, only three specimens of this rare species have been

A Wonderful Tovi Parrakeet
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.97262375" page_id="56314309"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
Mrs. D. Elton Cotton sends the following account of her Tovi :--
I was very interested in the December issue of the Avicultural Magazine,
in the account of the " Tui Parrakeets ". The photographs were excellent.
I made up my mind I would write to the editor and tell her of my very wonderful
pet Tovi " Billy Unfortunately, on Monday last he had a haemorrhage and died.
This bird was fearless, known to most bird lovers, and always visited the National
Show. He accompanied me everywhere, always riding under my coat collar, snug
and warm. He talked well and distinctly, christened me " Mammy " all on
his own, whistled, sang, and did almost anything. His besetting sin was jealousy ;
he would not allow anyone to touch me, and if anyone did was always told to
" Go away, that is my Mammy ".
His vitality was marvellous, and he had several amazing escapes through so
much energy. If I happened to come down in the middle of the night he would
know and whistle his special call, with " Pretty dear Mammy " ; but if any
other member of the house came down there was dead silence, although his cage
was covered with green baize, two thicknesses, and he could not see. He knew
no fear and would go to everyone. If I told him to kiss my eye, left or right,
he would do so correctly, and always said, " I love Mammy, pretty dear, my
Mammy ". Also any part of my face he seemed to know, and do as he was told.
He was a great fellow and I loved him very dearly. He used to sing, " Yen I

glow too old to gleam " just that first line, and no matter what temper he was in,
this song always seemed to calm him. My Amazon loved him dearly, and strange
though it may seem they were great friends. I used to tell him to comb " Polly's
hair ", and he would go to her and pull her feathers through his little beak,
preening them most carefully. Sometimes he would be cross and bite the Amazon ;
she was always patient and gentle with him, and strange to relate she did not
retaliate, although she does not allow us to do this. It was a most pleasing sight
to see these two birds together and many visitors who saw them marvelled at
this little fellow. I have had many tempting offers for him, as he is well known
at " Cage Birds " and at shows. When he came to me many years ago we had
no idea he talked, neither had the person from whom we purchased him. His
knowledge of my whereabouts was remarkable, in fact uncanny, and as long
as he could hear my feet about the house he was perfectly happy ; but if he
could not hear me he would call " Coo-ee, Mammy, pretty dear He knew
my movements like a clock, would ask for anything, and a very forceful character
he had.
Nothing mattered as long as we were together. A week ago he showed signs
of bronchitis, and in spite of every treatment that could possibly be procured
he passed away in my hand, after a haemorrhage, on Monday, 29th January,
at 3.45 a.m.
Mr. John Frostick says he knew him some twelve years ago on the show
bench, but if that is so that would make him some eighteen years of age. Although
when I purchased him he was supposed to be two years of age. Perhaps it may
not be the same bird. I feel his loss intensely, and can only say he was remarkable,
loving, and faithful, and if any other aviculturist gets as much interest on cash
paid for a bird as I have had from his companionship, and by his faith and trust
in me, they are repaid tenfold. Now I bid good-bye and salute a grand little
Tovi, who devoted his little nine inches of self to his mistress, and in the words
of his own song :
" When I grow too old to dream,
I shall have him to remember."
Breeding of the Derbyan Parrakeet
Mr. W. Gilbert, The Nash Cottage, Kempsey, nr. Worcester, sends the
following note :--
I have pleasure in sending you a few notes about the breeding of the Derbyan
Parrakeet. Bred in outdoor aviary. Nest in hollow log about 4 feet high by one
foot in circumference, with rotten wood placed at bottom. First egg, 19th May,
1939 ; hatched, 14th June, 1939 ; number of eggs, 3 ; oval, white. Date left
the nest, 9th August, 1939 ; number living, 3 ; hatched and reared by
own parents.
Food : Sunflower, hemp, canary, groats, nuts, and apple.
Plumage of young exactly like parents, but at time of writing all three have the
black beak of the female. I rather think that Mr. Ezra has bred these Parrakeets.
I have also bred the Leadbeater Cockatoo successfully this year. I feel
sure that you will be interested to know that I have a pair of Kagus incubating
their single and lovely coloured egg ; they are sitting in an outdoor aviary under
a well-screened lonicera hedge. The nest is rather flimsy, composed of dried
grasses and leaves, the cock sitting at night and the hen by day. They have
been sitting now about twenty-eight days, and Mrs. Dunn tells me that they sit
for about forty days, and that they have hatched a chick these last two years,
but it has only lived for an hour or two. There is a heated aviary adjoining,
and I thought that should the chick hatch out I would shut them all in and
supply plenty of earthworms and raw meat as this is all they seem to care for.

Aviculture in the Adelaide Zoological Gardens
The sixty-second Annual Report of the Royal Zoological Society of South
Australia, just received, is of considerable interest to aviculturists as it shows
that those responsible for the management of the Zoological Gardens at Adelaide
regard aviculture as of prime importance. They realize that in Australia they
possess a wonderful avifauna and are anxious to exhibit as many of their native
species as possible. Of Parrots alone there are fifty-nine species in Australia
and of these fifty are shown in the Gardens and the report states " it is the ambition
of the Council to acquire the remaining nine species ... in order that we may
attempt to breed them in captivity and thus learn something of their habits
before they finally become extinct 55 .
Thanks to the keenness of Mr. R. R. Minchin, the Director, and his Council,
every endeavour is being made to breed the rare Australian species and the
success achieved so far is most encouraging. During the past year the Brush
Wattle-bird ( Anthochaera chrysoptera) , one of the Honeyeaters, has been bred,
for the first time anywhere in captivity, while of the Parrakeets, three Pileated
(.Porphyriocephalus spurius), fourteen Queen Alexandra ( Northipsitta alexandrae),
fourteen Splendid (Neophema splendida ), eleven Bourkes ( Neopsephotus bourkei ),
five Crimson-wings ( Aprosmictus erythropterus) , four Brown's ( Platycercus venustus)
and many others of the commoner kinds have been successfully bred. The list
of Australian birds in the collection is a large one, amongst them being such
rarities as the White-tailed Black Cockatoo ( Calyptorhynchus baudini) and the

ANOTHER LONG-LIVED SHAMA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.958368666666667" page_id="56314312"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
I was much interested in Mr. Thomasset's account of his long-lived Shama
in the February Magazine. The first one I had I thought was fairly long-lived, as
I knew it was fourteen years old, but Mr. Thomasset's has beaten that.
The one I had was given to a friend of mine by her husband who, I believe,
got it from a bird shop that used to be opposite Harrods in the Brompton Road.
He took it home as a great treasure and had paid a lot for it.
After two or three days I received an S O S from them. Would I come at
once as the Shama was dying. Of course, I went, they lived in West Kensington,
and I certainly found the Shama in a very bad way. They had fed it entirely on
canary and white millet seed, which naturally, it would not touch. However, we
managed to pull him round on proper food and in a few days be began to whistle,
and I was asked to come and hear the " wonderful violin ".
They kept him seven years, and then I suppose got tired of him or wanted
something else. Anyway, they made me a present of him, and he certainly was
a charming bird, very tame, and whistled beautifully. I taught him one or two
tunes. One was the Marseillaise, I remember, and another several bars of
Beethoven's fifth. He lived very happily with me for seven years and then one
morning we came down to breakfast and he was singing as usual. But in a few
minutes I noticed something was wrong--he had gone down to the bottom of
his cage.
I took the cage out of the window and put it nearer the fire, but almost before
I had done it, he had rolled over and was gone.
I have had many Shamas since, but I don't think any have ever come up to
my first.

The members of the Avicultural Society have responded to the
President&apos;s appeal for continued support and increased help in a
manner which leaves no doubt as to their true enthusiasm for
aviculture, and their realization of the supreme importance of
maintaining the link which binds them together, and assures the
future of this most important branch of the science of ornithology.
There are few who have not continued their subscriptions, in spite
of heavy taxation and the many financial difficulties caused by the
war ; some have generously increased the amount, others have
achieved the great success of securing new members, one, especially,
is accorded the thanks and congratulations of the Society for
proposing no less than three !
The expressions of sympathy and desire to help from far over-
seas have been particularly gratifying ; to quote one only, from
the other side of the Atlantic : cc There are many of us over here
who are anxious to help their fellow aviculturists, and reading the
article on the care of birds in war time prompts me to say that if
there is any conceivable way in which it might be possible to take
care of some birds over here c for the duration 5 I for one would
be only too glad to co-operate to the fullest extent . 55 Such offers
of help are yet another indication of the bonds of fellowship existing
between aviculturists, no matter of what nation, and strengthen
still further those between Great Britain and the U.S.A.
The Avicultural Societies in Australia and New Zealand are
no less staunch in their support than the members in the Mother
Country, and there is no doubt that the close co-operation and
complete understanding that has always existed will continue

unabated. The undaunted Secretaries and Treasurers are par-
ticularly to be thanked for the efforts and trouble they have taken,
and are continuing to take, to forward subscriptions in the face of
complicated and difficult financial restrictions. The Editor is also
especially grateful to those on the other side of the world who
are taking no little part in keeping up the supply of material for
the Magazine, a help which is of the greatest value not only for
the future of the Magazine and the Society, but also of aviculture
in general. The accompanying photograph of the President is
happily symbolical of the close friendship which unites the parent
Society and her offspring in the other hemisphere.
In the British Isles and France even members of the Society
who are in the fighting forces in the air, on the sea, and on land,
and those engaged on Home Defence, have continued to send
contributions to the Magazine. Some of these articles have been
produced under great difficulties as one author wrote of his article :
" It has been written in a room containing over 800 other people,
mostly rowdy, to the stamp of boots on wooden floors, to vqices
swearing, shouting, and singing to an accordion, a loud wireless,
and dozens of mouth organs." But, despite these drawbacks, the
resulting article was one of the most interesting that has ever
appeared in the Avicultural Magazine.
From Italy and Belgium and other countries have come further
promises of support and expressions of desire to help. So, though
the future is naturally full of anxiety, it is evident that the Society
will not be allowed to fail for want of effort.
But it must again be reiterated that it will need the help of
very many members to keep the Magazine alive, and the Editor
most earnestly asks for contributions from all who are able to
send them.
Every effort is being made to ensure that the Magazine shall
appear as near the first day of each month as possible, but the
patience of members is asked for those occasions on which it is late.
There is much inevitable delay in production, communications,
particularly overseas, are much more uncertain, authors cannot
always return their proofs promptly, and the Editor is engaged in
full-time war work which does not make for celerity in editing.

{Concluded from p. 79)
The volume of the Avicultural Magazine for 1914, under the
editorship of Hubert D. Astley, is a very fine production, full of
valuable information for aviculturists. R. I. Pocock, who had
acted as Honorary Business Secretary, retired from this office and
was replaced by T. H. Newman. There were seven coloured
and a number of uncoloured plates. The volume commences, as
was usual in those days, in November (1913), the first article, by
Hubert Astley, describing the Himalayan Red-headed Titmouse
(.fEgitholiscus erythrocephalus ), a rare and charming species which
Astley has very successfully portrayed in colours.
F. E. Blaauw describes the breeding of the rare Long-billed
Parrakeet (Henicognathus leptorhynchus ), a pair of which he had
himself obtained and brought home from Chile.
Collingwood Ingram relates the story of how his father, the
late Sir William Ingram, Bart., purchased the island of Little
Tobago in the West Indies, with a view to placing thereon a
collection of Greater Birds of Paradise, a species that was suffering
greatly by the plume trade, in its native home in the Aru Islands.
Upwards of forty birds were safely placed there in 1909.
The late Dr. Lovell-Keays contributes a useful paper " On
Sexing Parrakeets ", followed by one on the same subject by the
Marquess of Tavistock. H. Willford describes the photographing
of the Oystercatcher from a hide, the success he achieved being
shown by three very beautiful pictures.
An interesting paper by Herbert K. Job, on the hatching of
Wild Ducks from an incubator and rearing the ducklings by hand,
is reproduced from an American journal. The actual hatching
was very successful, but the number of birds reared to maturity
small. This attracted the attention of Hugh Wormald who, in a
letter, offers really valuable suggestions from his vast experience
of rearing young Ducks in this country.
Teschemaker adds to his many records of success an account
of the successful breeding in his aviaries of the Yellow Wagtail

(Motacilla Jiava). He remarks that although this species seems to
be rather delicate, he never had any difficulty in domesticating it.
Five young were successfully reared and, having reached maturity,
released with their parents.
Although the Grey Waxbill ( Estrilda cinerea) is in normal times
imported very freely, records of its successful breeding in captivity
are very rare. W. A. Bainbridge records how he bred the species
successfully. The birds were in an outdoor aviary where they
spent the winter, " merely helped along by having their shed warmed
on frosty nights and on the coldest of days." Several nests were
built before success was achieved, and they were all on the ground,
easily visible though the actual entrance was obscured. The
successful nest was "added to and enlarged until it was roughly
six inches high and wide and about twice as long ". The young
birds were fed upon " mealworms and seeds, principally the latter,
while flowering grass and docks were always available."
In an article entitled " My Sunbirds' Aviary ", "A Lover of
Birds in France " gives an insight into his successful method of
maintaining a collection of no less than thirteen species (over thirty
individuals) of these very charming birds. E. C. Stuart Baker
contributes a delightful article on the White-legged Falconet
(.Microhierax melanoleucus) , a species which, in the main, feeds upon
insects but is not averse to tackling birds much larger than itself,
as was exemplified by its murdering and commencing to devour
a large Woodpecker. The same author writes very charmingly
on a pair of Serpent Eagles ( Spilornis cheela ) which he hand-reared
and kept for years.
The late G. A. Heumann, a well-known and very successful
aviculturist living in Australia, describes a trip to the Northern
Territory in search of the Hooded Parrakeet.
His account of the birds at a water hole in this arid district is
interesting. He writes : " The sun rose (July) about 7 a.m.,
but already at about 6.30 the Common Parrakeets flew past,
screeching as they always do ; after them came the Hawks, waiting
for the flocks of Doves and Finches. The first of the smaller birds
to arrive were the Blue-eyed Doves, and in countless numbers.
When a Hawk swooped down on them whilst drinking, the whirr
of their wings reminded us of the roar of the incoming waves on
the ocean beach. Then appeared the Parrakeets, the Browns and

Hooded. . . . After the Parrakeets had quenched their thirst the
Finches arrived in untold quantities. Gouldians, the red and
black-headed ones in grey and coloured costumes, Masked, Long-
tailed Grassfinches (the red-billed variety), and Double-bars (the
black-rumped kind)--they all came, not in hundreds but in
thousands. The Blood Finches seem to me to be the elite of the
rabble, always keeping to themselves, taking their drink apart
from the others. It is generally supposed that all these birds are
very delicate, but to live through the cold and bleak nights up there
would convince anyone that they are as hardy as any hard Finch."
A good coloured plate of the Australian Green-winged Dove
(Chalcophaps chrysoclora) illustrates an article on this and the Indian
species, by Miss R. Alderson. These charming Doves are much
more rarely seen in captivity now than then, when Miss Alderson
purchased them at 7 s. 6 d. a pair. Both species (which by the way,
are referred to as 44 varieties " which they are not), will breed freely
enough in captivity, providing they are kept in a good outdoor
aviary.
Two extremely good drawings by Hugh Wormald, depicting
Golden-eyed Ducks and Sheld-duck in flight, accompany an
article on these two species by Hubert Astley.
In an article on 44 Aviculture in Paraguay ", the late Lord
Brabourne describes the birds he met with and kept in a country
he describes as ideal for aviculture, with a perfect climate and an
abundance of very desirable species.
Astley writes on 44 My Birds at Brinsop Court ", his beautiful
home in Herefordshire, where at the time he kept a wonderful
collection in ideal surroundings. A. G. Butler writes on his

The Amethyst Sun Bird ( Cinnyris amethystinus) is the subject
of a coloured plate by Goodchild, and the accompanying article
is written jointly by Hubert Astley and Alfred Ezra.
Heumann's name appears again as the author of a series of
three very interesting articles on 44 Birds of New South Wales I
have caught and kept ". Living, as he did, in Australia, he had
every opportunity of getting to know the birds of that country
well and there were very few species that he did not at one time
or another have in his aviaries.

(.Phoeniconias minor) is reproduced as a coloured plate, together
with photographs of the Flamingoes on Lake Hannington, and
Astley writes on Flamingoes in general. It is rather strange that
the small African species has never, apparently, been kept in
confinement.
Lord Tavistock contributes three articles entitled " Some Hints
on Parrot Keeping ", which contain much useful information from
the pen of a specialist with this group. Aviculture was again in
evidence at the Zoo in 1914. A fine collection of Australian birds
brought over by Mr. Heumann, some of which were purchased
by the Society and others presented by Mr. Ezra, contained
such species as the Black and White Fantail, White-shouldered
Caterpillar-eater, five species of Honey-eaters, Scarlet-breasted and
Flame-breasted Robins. Douglas Quails, Crowned Pigeons, Green
Cardinals, and several species of Doves reared young, while a pair
of New Guinea Rifle Birds nested though unsuccessfully.
At Dereham, Hugh Wormald had a successful season with his
Ducks, twenty-one species nesting, producing " a fine lot of
ducklings
In the September number the Editor, Hubert Astley, wrote :
" It is calamitous and infamous that not only peace-loving nations
should be forced into stupendous war, but also that thousands of
Germans who must hate and loathe it should have to be involved
and become our enemies. The Germans are great bird-lovers ;
everywhere in Germany there are signs of this in the numerous
nesting-boxes for the benefit of the wild birds. Long ago, when
aviculture was in its infancy in England, in Germany many foreign
birds had been bred in captivity, and insectivorous foods had been
studied. The vileness of the plots of the Prussian War Party, with
the inflated vanity of the Kaiser to back it up, is completely outside
our experiences of and dealings with German bird-lovers."
But the Magazine carried on in spite of the war, though the
volumes in succeeding years are diminished in size. Now history
has repeated itself, and the world is once more in a state of
upheaval, but with the help and co-operation of members we shall
carry on again as we did then.
This concludes my review of the early years of the Society. It
has been interesting to go through these early volumes which
have brought up memories of many dear friends now passed away.

THE BREEDING IN CAPTIVITY OF THE
CLONGURRY PARRAKEET
(Barnardius macgillivrayi )

<bodyText confidence="0.998715086956522" page_id="56314325"  page_num="91" year="" vol="">
In the course of a previous article in the Avicultural Magazine
(December, 1939), I recorded how I came into possession of my
first Cloncurry Parrakeet in April, 1939. In August of the same
year, while returning from a holiday trip to Cairns, North Queens-
land, I was successful in locating four Cloncurry Parrakeets in
captivity in Townsville, mainly owing to the kind help of Mr. St.
John Robinson, of the Mount St. John Bird Sanctuary and Zoo
(about which delightful place more on another occasion). I had
long felt that Townsville would be the most accessible and likely
place in which to possibly find a few of these birds in captivity, as
the railway from Cloncurry in North-western Queensland runs
almost due east to Townsville on the coast, a distance of nearly
500 miles ; and such proved to be the case. Helped greatly by
Mr. Robinson's persuasiveness, we were successful in inducing two
of the owners to part with their pets, for such they were, and a
true pair duly arrived in Adelaide by air on 27th August. Both
birds are quite fearless, the cock being quite savage as is so often
the case with tame Broadtails, and both are accomplished whistlers,
particularly the cock. When they arrived I felt that if ever a pair
of birds were unlikely to breed in captivity, it would be these two !
On liberation in the aviary occupied by my first acquired bird,
which consists of a flight 9 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 6 feet high,
with a shelter at the same width at the rear, 4 feet deep and 7 feet

high, both, but particularly the cock, were very wing stiff, doubtless
through having spent most of their lives in small Parrot cages.
They seemed indifferent to the presence of the oldest inhabitant
and he was only mildly interested in them. A few days after their
arrival we experienced a cold snap, and as the hen looked a bit
tucked up, I took her inside for a few days ; she soon recovered,
and was returned to her companions. It early became evident
that she had mated up with her fellow-traveller, and was interested
in the log provided, which was 2-|- feet long, with an internal
diameter of about 5 or 6 inches, and with a side entrance hole
close to one end, both of which were closed. The log was hung
obliquely high up in the shelter. At this time, although the
odd cock bird was tolerated, he was made to feel that his presence
was not exactly welcome, and on several occasions I was on the
point of removing him.
On 24th September, exactly four weeks after the pair's arrival
in Adelaide, the first egg was laid, and forthwith " Oscar ", as the
odd cock bird was called after his previous owner, Mr. Seppelt,
was removed and taken to the Adelaide Zoo, where the species
had not previously been exhibited. I think the first egg got broken
because two days later there was still only one in the log, and a
further two days elapsed before two were seen together. Assuming
my supposition is correct, the total clutch consisted of five eggs,
laid on alternate days, and incubation commenced after the third
or fourth egg had been laid. The hen sat very steadily, not leaving
the nest when I entered the aviary, but of the four eggs incubated,
two proved infertile. On 20th October one newly hatched young
bird was seen in the log, but when the log was next inspected, three
days later, it was dead. However, the hen was allowed to continue
incubation for several days longer in the hope that the remaining
fertile egg would hatch ; when eventually removed it was found to
measure i-i X 0*9 in., and to contain a fully developed dead
chick. The two infertile eggs were presented to the South Australian
Museum ; never having been previously described, they become
the type and measure (1) 1*15 X *85 in., and (2) 1-05 X *85 in.
It soon became apparent that the birds were going to nest
again, and on 14th November the first egg of the second clutch
was laid. This time the clutch consisted of four eggs laid on
alternate days as before, and incubation commenced with the

<bodyText confidence="0.976517151515152" page_id="56314327"  page_num="93" year="" vol="">
laying of the third egg. Again, two eggs proved infertile, and on
5th December one egg was observed to be chipped, and next day
two young birds had hatched, but by the 8th only one was alive.
The survivor, however, flourished, and after what seemed an
extremely long time, though actually about the same as for other
members of the genus that I have bred, it eventually left the nest
early on the morning of 9th January, 1940, being very well feathered,
strong on the wing, and very quiet and steady. As regards its sex
I am uncertain as yet, though I think and hope it will prove to be
a hen, and therefore a mate for " Oscar " at the Zoo. My reason
for supposing it to be a hen is that it has a very pronounced " wing
stripe " which is the term I use for the series of white spots found
on the flights of almost all immature and many adult female
Broadtails. In moments of doubt, however, it seems to me to have
a rather large head and beak for a hen. In plumage it is very like
its parents, except that its colours are not quite so bright and it
has the very faintest trace of a red frontal band, which is quite
lacking in the adults. It appears to have been fed very largely by
the hen, for although "Jimmy", the father, would sit quite
quietly if I entered the aviary while his mate was in the nest and,
on the other hand, would attack me noisily and viciously if she
happened to be off, yet I rarely saw him feed her when she came
off and rarely did he enter the log, presumably to feed either her
or the young bird.
Although this appears to be the first record of the species being
bred in captivity, yet it is quite possible that it may have been bred
by someone living in the interior of North Queensland, where it is
found, and is apparently not uncommon. Nevertheless, I think it
is unlikely, for like all the genus, Cloncurrys, or Bulu-bulus as they
are called in Queensland and not usually distinguished from
Barnard's, appear to be mostly kept singly as whistling pets ; in
fact all six that I have seen were tame birds that had obviously
been taken from the nest and hand-reared.

The American Robins, also called Migratory Thrushes, were
an interesting pair. We bought them in the autumn of 1938 and
M. Delacour assured us they were a true pair. However, during
the winter they fought so badly that we had to catch one up and
bring it indoors. I then thought we had two cocks. In the spring
this second bird was turned out in the next aviary but one to
the original bird. After a bit the bird which had been out all
winter started to sing. The notes are sweet but few, and one has the
curious impression that one is hearing a Mistle Thrush singing
somewhere in the distance. I noticed the two birds wanted to
get together and also that the singer's head had become far blacker
than that of the other bird. We caught up the hen and put her in
the cock's aviary. He chased her all over the place, pulling feathers
out whenever he could. I stayed watching with the net ready.
After a bit the hen was exhausted and settled on the ground. The
cock hovered over her, diving at her again and again, but she kept
her beak pointed at him. After a few minutes he landed and
immediately the pair started collecting grass and leaves and
flying about looking for somewhere to place them. They chose
eventually a ledge in the shelter where nothing would stick and
here they put material which dropped in heaps on the floor. I got a
twiggy spray and nailed it to the beam. Behind this they built
a fine nest exactly like a Blackbird's. Five eggs were laid of a
very deep green-blue. Five fine strong chicks left the nest. Their
breasts were red and their backs grey, but both were covered with
the same markings as those of a young Blackbird. The youngsters
left the nest at eleven days old. On 2nd July the parents nested
again in the same nest, hatched on 15th July, and reared
another four.
The Eastern Bluebirds started carrying material into a Tit's
nest-box on 13th May, and started sitting on the 19th. The
youngsters hatched on 3rd June and we cut a small hole in the
netting and gave the parents their liberty and then ceased to
supply anything in the way of live food. The old birds were most

delightful to watch. They sat on the telephone wires on a high
post and hawked flies just like Spotted Flycatchers do. The
youngsters did not leave the nest till 2nd July, but on leaving
they were completely feathered and even had long tails. I have
never seen young birds leave the nest so well feathered with the
exception of young Parrakeets. There were four young in the first
nest and in the second three.
The Western Bluebirds were one of our tragedies. They were
a pair purchased from a dealer in the winter in poor plumage.
They went to nest in a Starling's box on 16th June. The young
hatched eleven days later and the parents were given their liberty.
All went well for a few days, but I was rather busy and did not
watch the pair very closely. A mouse got in and ate the youngsters.
This was not noticed. One morning I saw the old birds were not
going in and out of the aviary, so looked in the nest which was
empty. The pair disappeared during the day and were seen no
more, I hoped they would take one of the many boxes in Mr. Lewis's
garden, but they did not.
Miss Knobel gave Mr. Lewis a White Black-winged Grackle
male and another was purchased, which proved to be a hen. The
pair were very wild, but went to nest in September, and one
youngster left the nest in October. The weather was cold and it
perished. It had a pale grey back. When the box was taken down
a clear egg was found. It was just the same shade of pale blue
as is the egg of the common Starling.
A pair of Orange Headed Ground Thrushes nested. They also
chose a ledge on which nothing could possibly stick, as did the
Migratory Thrushes, only their nesting site was on the outside
of their house. I got a dead bough covered with ivy and nailed
it to the ledge, and in this they built a nest rather like a Blackbird's
and laid four or five eggs. Their aviary was, unfortunately, the same
one as that of the Band-tailed Pigeons, and the rat that killed the
cock Band-tail also killed the cock Thrush and the youngsters.
We have a pair of Hermit Thrushes and a pair of Dwarf Hermit
Thrushes. The latter are, I think, two hens. None of these nested,
but I had hopes of breeding from the pair of Hermit Thrushes in
1940 if they were placed in a more thickly planted aviary. The
male Hermit sang perpetually, especially in the evening. His
song was most curiously metallic but one got terribly tired of it.

especially when it insisted on singing along with the Nightingales.
Both the Hermit and the Dwarf Hermit Thrushes are very like
small and frailly built Song Thrushes ; there is little difference in
size between the two species. Both have the habit of slowly raising
and lowering their russet tails when perching, the cock does so
between each phase of his song.
One other species of Thrush completes our present collection of
Thrushes. Mr. Lewis bought three Blue Whistling Thrushes which
M. Cordier collected in Indo-China. They have turned out to
be two males and a female. The males' song is low and rippling,
rather Dipper-like. The female is fairly easily distinguished by
the presence of many little blue spots on her breast, neck, and
throat. When at rest all continually flirt their tails fanwise.
Our Parrakeets did rather well on the whole. The only complete
failures were the Crimson-wings, which had two batches of clear
eggs, and the Queen of Bavaria Conures which had one lot. The
latter pair may be two hens. In fact, I am afraid all our four Queen
of Bavaria's are probably hens.
We have one pair of Queen Alexandra Parrakeets and two
males. The pair were put in a 72 ft. by 16 ft. aviary and given a
natural hollow log. The hen started laying on 30th April, and made
very heavy weather of it ; I very nearly had to bring her in, but
by the afternoon she had appeared again and was fit. I never
looked into the nest and so do not know how many eggs were
laid. On 15th June, I noticed ants going in and out of the hole so
decided I must take the top off. On looking inside I saw one
fine youngster, one partly eaten and covered with thousands of
ants. I took the baby out, put in a whole tin of Keatings and stirred
into the wood chippings, and later removed all the wood, replacing
it with peat and a few clippings on the top ; then I put back the
baby. On the 22nd I noticed that the hen must be laying again
and was afraid that the first youngster would ruin everything
when he went rampaging around the nest; so once again I opened
up the top and saw four eggs scattered around the nest. I got
another nest-box and placed it beside the original one and into this
I put the baby. I then cleared up the old nest, added some more
damp peat, and put a few chips on top ; after making a good hollow
in the top I put the four eggs in it and put on the lid again, and
somewhat nervously hoped for the best. The hen went in straight

away and the cock immediately found his son, so all went well.
I watched carefully, but never looked into either nest again. The
baby left on 25th June. Eventually, rather to my surprise, five
youngsters left the second nest.
The parents were supplied with large quantities of sprouting
canary seed and sunflower and in one of the flower-beds a good
deal of canary seed came up ; this the parents ate a great deal of,
devouring the blades lengthwise like rabbits.
I also collected every morning a large bucket full of the annual
poa grass when it was seeding, and also some seeding chickweed
and groundsel. The poa grass is practically essential for young
Parrakeets and is the only grass all species seem to like. If one
can get large quantities, so much the better, a small bunch of
green food is not enough, but if the parents have a really large pile
always fresh and plenty of sprouting seed they leave the dry
seed almost untouched.
The pair of Layards reared three ; these do not care for green
food very much, but ate a whole apple and half an orange every
day, as well as sprouted sunflower and plenty of peanuts.
The pair of Redrumps reared thirteen magnificent youngsters in
two broods ; they were fed like the Queen Alexandra's. These we
left all together in the 72-ft. aviary and the fifteen birds made
a most lovely flock. Their flight is incredibly swift, and in their
large aviary they were able to fly up and down, turning round
at the ends without stopping.
Our pair of Splendids consisted of a magnificent imported cock
and a 1938 hen given to Mr. Lewis by Lord Tavistock. The hen
started sitting on 1st June in a large Lovebird box which had been
filled with damp peat. I never looked inside and never saw her
off till the second week in July, when she came off and went into
the flight to feed with the cock on their heap of poa grass. I shut
her out of the shelter and peeped into the box because I was a bit
suspicious owing to the fact that the cock did not seem very hard
worked. Inside I found six clear eggs, a bitter blow. Anyhow,
they were removed and the hen laid again about a week later.
In due course I noticed the cock feeding the hen a lot and eventually
three magnificent babies left the nest, all of them distinctly larger
than their mother. The old pair were extremely tame ; the cock
would feed from my hand and on several occasions they were so

98 T. JONES-1939 BREEDING SEASON AT LEGKFORD
anxious for their green food that they flew out into the corridor
when I opened their door to put in their green food. One had
only to go inside and they would come running incredibly quickly
along the floor, jump up the step and into their pen again. The
exit from the shelter to the flight is through a small pigeonhole
with a let-board on either side. The first day the babies went out
they did not try to get back. I went very quietly into the
flight and coaxed them on to my finger one at a time and put
them back. The cock actually fed one of them as it was sitting
on my finger.
Lord Tavistock also gave Mr. Lewis four young Turquoisines
in 1939, but he strongly advised me not to breed from them till
they were two years old, so they just lived together quietly. They
had a very pretty habit of perching on the seeding heads of the
growing canary seed and also on the lavender heads and picking
out the seeds. Neither they nor the Bourke's have ever become
really tame like the Splendids, but have the most disconcerting
habit of freezing when on the ground, and so running the risk
of getting stepped on.
Of New Zealand Golden-fronted we have a cock&apos; and two hens.
They lived together as a trio and I put up several boxes in the
hope that the male might prove to be a polygamist, but he did not
do so. His mate reared three youngsters in her second nest, the
eggs in the first proving clear. The babies were so like the old birds
that when we came to ring them the only way we could tell which
were which was owing to the fact that the old birds were shedding
their flights.
The Golden-fronted is to my mind easily the most attractive of
the small Parrakeets. They are extremely active, running on the
floor, perches, or wire, like mice. Their call is rather like the
churr of a Great-tit. They are extremely tame and cheeky, and
seem to have more individuality than the other little Parrakeets.
Hemp is supposed to be bad for them, so they only get canary,
millet, and a little oats, as do our Grass Parrakeets. But green
food is absolutely essential and they eat much more than any other
Parrakeet. They also have sprouted canary and millet all the
year round, and a little bit of apple. They scratch like Fowls in
all their dishes.
We also got a pair of Swainsons Lorikeets in the summer.

They got no further than feeding each other. They are a delight-
fully amusing pair and share a large planted aviary with a pair of
Pheasants. If the Pheasants, Mikados, are given an apple it is
amusing to watch the little Lories drive them off it.
In their aviary is a wild crab apple that bore quantities of very
brilliant orange but very bitter fruits. These the Lories were very
fond of, and they were a lovely sight as they clambered about the
branches plucking the fruits. All the Pheasants' aviaries are 72 feet
long and each has a long bed planted with rare and very beautiful
flowering shrubs which greatly enhance the beauty of the birds.
Besides the Lories two other members of the Parrot family use
these aviaries and so far without doing any damage. One is a
pair of White-backed Roseate Cockatoos, and the other a pair
of Queen of Bavaria Conures. So long as the shrubs have very
twiggy branches the large birds prefer to stick to their official
boughs.
Mr. Lewis is particularly fond of Touracous and we possess
about forty odd birds of eight species. These all live in the large
planted aviaries in the summer, where they make a fine show.
We had a pair of Pink-crested which had been feeding each other
all winter so they were given an aviary to themselves, but they never
nested. In another were eight Senegal Touracous. Much to our
surprise one laid in a Tragopan's nest-basket, but the eggs proved to
be clear. She laid three times during the summer with the same
result each time. We never knew her mate. In the winter all
the species live together in a very large heated shelter with a 34 ft.
flight outside to which they have access on all but the coldest days.
All seem to agree and they make a magnificent show.
Four young Emus were hatched in an incubator and reared ;
they proved quite easy, and were absolutely tame and full of
clownish gambols.
Our last success was not avicultural, but was such a thrill
that it must be mentioned. We have a pair of Gibbons (Hylohates
concolor) which live on an island containing about fifty odd trees.
During the early summer we decided that the female was going
to have a youngster, but nothing happened. She is delightfully
tame and often when she was in my arms I hoped to feel the
youngster move. We had decided that the poor animal must
have some sort of a growth and just hoped it would not

affect her health. On 12th September she did not come down
for her food at 9 a.m., but after lunch she was leaping and swinging
through the trees far more actively than she had done for some
time, and across her middle clung a naked pink baby with a
horribly wizened baby-like face. Its hair soon grew and its. skin
turned black and when I left on 6th December it had begun
to sit up in its mother's lap and look around or else play with
its father's hand. The female has remained just as tame and
sweet-tempered and does not in the least object to one touching
the baby.

GOATSUCKER IN CAPTIVITY

In the middle of April, 1934, the dailies and journals of Buenos
Aires announced and commented greatly on the arrival of a foreign
visitor of strange and legendary habits, brought from the forests
of Santiago to the bustle and noise of the metropolis.
This was the famous Urutaii or Giant Homed Goatsucker
(,Nyctibius griseus cornutus) an inhabitant of the northern regions,
seen only very occasionally in the province of Buenos Aires. Like
all its relatives of nocturnal habits, it is difficult to catch alive and
more so to maintain in captivity, for which reasons it is little known
and always an object of curiosity.
For several days its arrival was the topic of the moment, and
its photograph was widely reproduced. The public was reminded
of its fantastic exploits, the legends and superstitions of which it
has been the subject, and its distinguished role in the folklore of
the north, already mentioned by Azara and other authors, among
them Lehmann-Nitsche, in El Hornero , ii, p. 277, and iv, pp. 168
and 307.

As is known, this bird, which measures some 40 cm. in length,
is peculiar from every point of view, with its mottled feathers, its
grotesque shape, its enormous frog-like head furnished with a
mouth out of all proportion, its secret, nocturnal existence, its
habit of nesting on the extremity of a dead trunk or branch on
which it perches motionless and rigid, merged with the bark, and
above all for its strange, indefinable call, like a mournful cry or
hoot which impresses itself on one's memory.
Chance made me acquainted with the owner of the specimen,
Sr. Luis F. Gomez, who called at the Museum in order to have the
bird properly classified, as various incredulous people had cast
doubts on its identity.
I was therefore able, as Sr. Gomez kindly allowed me to do so,
to examine it in detail on various occasions, take photographs of
it and collect various data.
It had been sent to him while still juvenile by his brother,
Sr. Eduardo C. Gomez, resident in Santiago del Estero, who had
found it early in January in a nest built at the end of a branch of
the white Quebracho in the Cerro de Guasayan (Depto. de Ghoza).
The nest consisted of a simple shell, without soft lining of any kind.
Here in the city the bird was fed exclusively on cooked meat,
chopped and mixed with lettuce.
I was able to observe the bird in the Museum at the end of
April, when it was already in adult plumage, its coloration differed
very little from the specimens preserved in the collections, except
that the tail was considerably shorter. This was caused partly
by friction and partly through having been cut almost in half,
doubtless in order to use the feathers as charms, as is done in the
case of the Brazilian Pygmy Owl. The head and neck were dark
brown, forming a kind of hood which runs down in a point towards
the centre of the back. The wings, of a mottled ashen grey tint,
terminate in black feathers, while the coverts are very dark blackish-
brown. The breast and throat are brown, with large blackish
spots, making an indefinite colour as a whole. The belly is ashen
grey. The iris of the eyes is lemon yellow, the pupils being very
dilated. The upper lid is dentated, with three lobes, the central
one of which is wider than the other two.
By day the bird remained motionless in its habitual upright
position, but when it heard any sound near at hand or loud, such

as a piano or noise from the street, it raised itself slowly stretching
its neck and maintaining this same curious attitude for some
minutes, before slowly returning to its normal posture.
It was easy to cause this movement in the bird by playing,a small
musical instrument, such as the mouth-organ, the first notes from
which would cause the bird to adopt this expectant attitude long
enough to photograph it.
Without doubt, such a manifestation, spontaneous in this bird,
is bound up with its instinct of self-preservation, as this special
manner of reacting to noise, which means unknown danger,
accentuates its oneness with the trunk on which it perches and
makes it difficult to discover.
During the night it usually displayed some excitement, beating
its wings.
It knew its keepers and tried to play, pecking their fingers.
It would allow one to stroke its head, but did not like one to touch
its tail or wings. It did not utter any call, but gave a feeble cackle
when molested.
During the month of October it followed the same regime and
behaved as usual. It grew two tail-feathers which afterwards broke
off. It continued its nocturnal liveliness and tried to call. It ate
slowly, repeating the swallowing process ; and from time to time
it appeared to devour some flies that annoyed it. The fall of an
object in the house made it open its beak, but it did not become
alarmed or make any other movement. At times it made short,
clumsy flights, bumping against the walls.
It died on the 6th December, 1934, after almost a year of
captivity, probably by reason of a moulting crisis, in spite of every
care. It never managed to eat by itself, although it tried to catch
food on the wing when thrown from a distance.
It was presented to the Museum, in whose collections it is
exhibited.

By V. A. V. Carr
(&apos;Continued from p. 74)
The Bramblefinch, Chaffinch, Hawfinch, and all members of
the Bunting family can be classed together because of the similar
ways they adopt to feed their youngsters--chiefly, like Softbills,
from beak to mouth, and secondly regurgitation. The " beak to
mouth ", of course, suggests that live food is carried without having
been digested--which is correct and is one of the troubles of the
breeding of such birds. The regurgitation period of feeding does
not occur to any great extent until the young birds are ready to
leave the nest and after, and at that time live food can be left off
to a certain limit. I have heard people say that young birds are
not fed by the parent birds until they are several hours old. From
my own observations this is untrue, as I have seen a Bramblefinch
feed its progeny immediately the shell has fallen away.
The Brambling and Chaffinch (especially the latter) are very
faddy over starting to nest. They will go from one site to another
with a bit of cobweb they have found from somewhere and shuffle
about looking most distracted. We have had them do this for
days and eventually found broken eggs on the floor--suggesting
that they were unable to get a nest built in time.
A Chaffinch's nest, in the wild, is one of the best made one can
hope to encounter and generally it is interwoven in a fork on a
bough--not a thick one, at that. They weave the material round
and round until they have a good base and nothing that you give
them in captivity satisfies their desire for something, apparently,
they want to get started to weave round and round.
This happened time and time again and it was not until by
chance we used some wood wool (or wood shavings) used for packing
purposes. Wherever a Chaffinch was noticed endeavouring to
get started, some wood wool was placed in the site and made into
a cup shape. This was an admirable base and Chaffinches and
Bramblefinches weave into it bits of dry grass, untwisted binder
twine, moss, horsehair, etc. One wonders how they do it, as it is
done with such diligence that one gains the impression that it is
done with a needle and cotton. Long lengths of any building

material must be avoided at all costs, as it is dangerous to let
birds carry about long pieces because of the danger of their getting
hung up on boughs, etc., with fatal results.
I have never seen a Bramblefinch's nest in the wild, as they
have not been recorded as having bred in this country. If any
reader has I should be interested to hear what it looks like, and
if it in any way resembles a wild Chaffinch's nest. In captivity
they are very similar--but one has not the selection of material
to provide as the wild birds have to choose from.
A Brambling only sits for nine days and I think it is the shortest
incubation period of any of our British Hardbills and, indeed,
some of the Softbills. A Chaffinch hatches about the tenth day,
whilst the Bunting follows with thirteen and, longest of all, the
Hawfinch, fourteen days.
If any breeder can rear any of these aforementioned birds he
is doing very well, and four more interesting birds at nesting time
can be difficult to find. Hawfinches agree with other birds in
aviaries provided there is plenty of room. Yellow Buntings are
inclined to be pugnacious and want watching--but it is not advisable
to put more than one pair of the same species in an aviary together.
If any reader requires any information on any problem with
British birds, I shall be pleased to help : Ormond Lodge, Newbold-
on-Stour, Stratford-on-Avon.

By the death in November, 1939, of Mr. A. E. W. de B.
Wachsmann, of Beecroft, New South Wales, who had been a mem-
ber of the Avicultural Society since August, 1914, Australia loses one
of its best-known aviculturists. Through living in another state the
writer had only had the pleasure of meeting the late Mr. Wachs-
mann on two occasions, the second being in August last, when
he appeared to have made a good recovery from a severe illness
which had kept him confined to bed for nearly six months earlier
in the year. On that occasion the writer spent several interesting
hours chatting to him and inspecting his collection of birds, which,
though poorly housed and displayed, were nevertheless in excellent
condition. At that time he had a good collection of Australian
Parrots, without any notable rarities, and a very fine collection of
Pheasants which were the especial charge of his sister-in-law,
Miss Heumann, who has been very successful in breeding them.
Other outstanding birds in the collection at that time were a male
Paradise Rifle Bird ( Ptilorhis paradisea ) in full colour, a male Regent
Bower Bird (Sericulus chrysocephalus) also in magnificent condition,
a Trumpeter, and several Kagus (. Rhynchaetus jubatus ), which he
succeeded in breeding on several occasions, and one of which,
" James," was very tame and always ready to display for the edifi-
cation of visitors; also several New Caledonian Pigeons known as
the " Collier Blanc " (. Phaenorhina goliath) which had been bred by
him on many occasions.
The late Mr. Wachsmann and the writer had corresponded
freely for a number of years and exchanged Parrots on many
occasions, amongst the species which the writer secured from
him on various occasions being the Barraband's Parrakeet ( Polytelis
swainsonii ), Crimson-winged Parrakeet ( Aprosmictus erythropterus ),
Northern Rosella ( Platycercus venustus ), Red-vented Blue Bonnet
(.Psephotus haematorrhous) , and Gang-gang Cockatoo ( Callocephalum
fimbriatum). His letters were always interesting, and some extracts
regarding rare Parrots may be of interest to members.
Writing of the Paradise Parrot ( Psephotus pulcherrimus ) he says :

Queensland-New South Wales border, where the birds have been
seen at intervals along the river-banks, which are very steep and
in which the birds nest. We had a couple of aboriginal drovers
with us, and they assured us they knew the birds but we were
unable to locate any in a stay of five days. An old resident of the
district mentioned that he could recollect them well, and had
searched their nests in ant-hills ; he was of the impression that
they nested more frequently in river banks which are only accessible
by ropes. They bred in September." On another occasion, speaking
of a friend, he wrote : 44 Three years ago he discovered a pair of

ant-hill ; one of the station-hands caught the cock bird when it
entered the burrow and placed it among other Parrots in an
aviary. When my friend arrived he was handed the dead bird ;
it was hard luck after locating them and watching them for months.
He seems very sanguine of getting on to them again."
Regarding the Golden-shouldered Parrot (Psephotus chryso-
pterygius) he wrote : 4 4 The last pair that I had I got from the
Gulf country, Queensland, sixteen years ago. I let Ellis Joseph
have them in exchange for three pairs of Cuban Finches as I was
expecting more that did not materialize." How many hundred
Cuban Finches would one want for a pair these days !
Of the Orange-bellied Parrot (.Neophema chrysogastra) he wrote :
44 I had them at the same time as the Golden-shoulders. I let
my father-in-law, Mr. Heumann have them and I think he sent
them to England."
Finally, regarding the Ground Parrot (Pezoporus wallicus), he
wrote : 44 As a boy, I shot them and found their nests on the site
of the Randwick racecourse, which was then a swamp."

Intimate Sketches from Bird Life. By Eric Hosking and
C. Newberry. Price 5^. Published by Country Life, Ltd.,
20 Tavistock Street, London, W.C. 2.
This book should make a wide appeal both to the experienced
ornithologist and the amateur. It is profusely illustrated with
Eric Hosking's photographs, which is sufficient commendation
in itself for any book. Ten different species are dealt with, each
chapter commencing with a brief description of the bird followed
by detailed and informative field observations. The descriptions
of the behaviour of the parent birds at the nest, period of incubation
and feeding, and behaviour of the young should appeal especially
to aviculturists. The observations on the Stone Curlew and the
excellent series of photographs illustrating them are most valuable,
and no less are those on the Little Owl which do much to clear
up the controversy on the diet of this much discussed bird. Such
points as the different methods adopted by the Spotted and Pied
Flycatchers in securing food for their young, and that the authors
saw two out of three pairs of Grey Wagtails feeding on minnows,
are typical of the many interesting observations in this book. Five
shillings spent in its purchase is a five shillings well spent.

Death of the Director of the Adelaide Zoo
It is with the greatest regret that the death of Mr. R. R. Minchin, Director
of the Adelaide Zoo, at the early age of 35 is announced. The death of
Mr. Minchin is a great loss not only to Aviculture in South Australia, but through-
out the world. Owing to the efforts of Mr. Minchin the Adelaide Zoo at present
has the most representative collection of Australian Parrots in Australia. More
birds are bred at the Adelaide Zoo than any other Zoo in Australia, and
Mr. Minchin had marked success in breeding rare Parrots, some of which were
in danger of extinction. His contributions to the Avicultural Magazine were of
the greatest value and his co-operation will be sorely missed by his colleagues
in many countries. He was President of the Avicultural Society of South Australia
for the years 1936 and 1937. The obituary notice in the Advertiser, Adelaide,

" He was the third Minchin to hold the position. His grandfather, Mr. R. E.
Minchin, became the first Director of the South Australian Zoological and
Acclimatisation Society's Gardens when they were transferred from the Botanic
Garden to their present site in 1882. Mr. R. E. Minchin's son, Mr. A. G. Minchin,
succeeded to the post. When Mr. A. G. Minchin died four and a half years ago,
his son, Mr. Ronald Minchin, became director. He did much to improve
attendances by making the gardens more attractive.
" Mr. Ronald Minchin was born on 26th February, 1904, and was educated
at St. Peter's College. The Society sent him to Singapore and the Dutch East
Indies in 1929 to collect animals for the gardens, and to New Zealand in 1933
for a similar purpose.

National (Red Cross) Exhibition of Cage Birds
As a result of this Exhibition, which was held in the Horticultural Hall,
Westminster, on 8th, 9th, and 10th February last, a sum of #1,016 was handed
to the Lord Mayor of London's Red Cross and St. John Fund. In the report
of the Exhibition which was published in the last number of the Magazine, it was
stated that on the opening day #350 had been collected, and it was hoped this
would be exceeded; as the amount was nearly trebled the organizers must feel
more than satisfied with their efforts, and well rewarded for having, despite the
war, not only achieved one of the most successful exhibitions ever held, but so
considerably helped a great national cause.

I am writing to rectify a mistake I made in the Avicultural Magazine of 1938
regarding a Cuckoo from New Guinea, on which I wrote an article. This Cuckoo
which lived in the London Zoo was unfortunately labelled Bernstein's, but since
its death has proved to be a Menebiki Cuckoo. These Cuckoos are very
similar in appearance, but Bernstein's is a small dark green bird with a black
bill while the Menebiki is much larger with a white bill.

OWLS AS AVIARY BIRDS

By E. F. Chawner
The majority of aviculturists when they see this heading will
probably say, " how dull," and pass on to another article. There
is a widespread conviction that all an Owl does is to sit on a perch
in a dark corner sunk in sleep. Some people generously concede
that their plumage is handsome, but even this is stretching a point.
True, Owls do not hop or fly incessantly from perch to perch,
they are sedate and having selected a favourite corner are usually
to be found there, but this does not mean that they are unobservant
of what goes on around them, on the contrary, very little escapes
their notice. Owls can pick out an aeroplane flying high and
watch it until it is a mere speck on the horizon ; their sight is very
keen, as is to be expected of a creature which can detect a field-
mouse on the ground while perched as much as twenty feet above,
and can swoop noiselessly down and capture it before it has even
begun to realize its danger.
Most Owls readily respond to kind treatment and show real
affection for human friends, particularly Eagle Owls, Wood Owls,
and Scops. Barn Owls, being more nocturnal, are not so forth-
coming, though there are exceptions. They will answer when
spoken to, and come forward to have their heads scratched, which
they enjoy as much as any Parrot.
A tame Spectacled Owl which I kept for many years was
always on the look out for his friends, and was grievously dis-
appointed if he was passed by.
Another favourite was a lovely Scops leucotis, a fierce little
creature to strangers, but gentleness itself to her friends. She

would sit on my hand and nibble my fingers " talking 55 meanwhile
in a soft crooning voice. Yet another, a " Marbled Owl " from
Australia, was so tame that he was allowed to join us when we had
tea in the garden, though this much displeased the Robin, who
considered us and our tea-table his special property. Not that
" Edwin " ever deigned to notice the Robin ; he sat on the back
of my chair quietly preening his feathers and occasionally taking
part in the conversation. He had a curious double note, like a
Cuckoo gone very flat. His wife died egg-bound, and " Edwin 55
adopted me in her stead, going so far as to lead me by a finger to
the nest-box and getting into it himself, evidently hoping I would
join him.
The next aviary housed a very beautiful female Fernando Po
Eagle Owl [Bubo fraseri ), and in her eyes I was her chosen mate.
She carried this delusion so far that in her breeding season I had
to make the " scrape 55 in the sand where she laid and incubated
her eggs, and when she felt hungry it was my part to stand by
them while she fed and usually bathed before returning to her
post. It was a great pity that I could not obtain a cock for her ;
she would have been a most devoted mother.
A hand-reared Lapp Owl (Syrnium lapponicum) had the same
fancy ; she laid six eggs in a large open basket fixed high up in
her shelter, and again I was called on to provide tit-bits and mount
guard. She, however, only attempted a family one year, no
doubt she realized my shortcomings, but she was always devoted
to me until her lamented death from aspergillosis.
Speaking generally the large Owls become tame more readily
than the small ones, though there are exceptions. The tiny
Glaucidiums are very charming, and so are the Scops, but the
former especially are rather shy and sometimes unfriendly. Scops
are too nocturnal (again generally speaking) to take much interest
in human beings ; they are also decidedly delicate, and need
careful feeding with plenty of exercise. This applies to the Sparrow
Owls ( Glaucidium) as well. They are very short-lived in a cage
or small aviary, but thrive for years if they have a long flight,
are not overfed, and are supplied with Sparrows or mice. Rats,
even young ones, or raw meat, soon cause death from fits.
When Mr. Spedan Lewis had his collection of Owls it was
our aim to breed as many species as possible, but we found it

exceedingly difficult to get true unrelated pairs. The proportion
of imported females greatly exceeds that of males, the former being
usually the large and more imposing, dealers naturally prefer
them. True pairs are nearly always hand-reared birds out of the
same nest, and of all crosses that of brother and sister is the most
infertile. In many countries the natives will not have anything to
do with Owls, holding them to be birds of ill omen, and the collector
has not only to obtain and feed them personally but to guard them
from his followers who are convinced that misfortune will dog the
camp as long as the unlucky birds are permitted to live.
When we could get true pairs we found Owls usually quite
ready to go to nest, provided they were not disturbed or visited
by anyone but their accustomed attendant. The more they are
left to themselves the more likelihood of success. If they are
interfered with they will destroy their eggs and kill their nestlings.
The pen must not be cleaned out from the time the scrape is made
or the hole occupied until the young can perch. This, of course,
is the great drawback to having the owlery near one's house or
garden, for an accumulation of six weeks' rabbit or rat remains
becomes decidedly overpowering, particularly in hot weather,
as breeding Owls must be provided with more than they can possibly
consume. The male bird's duty is to carry in supplies until the
nest is surrounded with masses of food from the day's portion to&gt;
bits a month old. The sitting Owl receives and divides the ration
among her young ; she only leaves them for a few moments during
the day or night, and returns at once to her post. In the wild
state the male goes hunting for his family and the female guards it.
Hence probably the difference in size and fierceness between the
sexes ; he is built for speed, she for defence ; though if both are
at home together he will play his part in driving off intruders.
Owls sit four weeks from the day the first egg is laid. The young
are usually more or less covered with white down ; they are
blind and very ugly. The usual clutch is two, but some species,
particularly the Barn Owls, lay again before the young leave the
nest, and they help to keep the eggs warm. This may be repeated
several times, so that a nest may contain three or four pairs of
youngsters varying from practically fledged to newly hatched.
When they leave the nest they usually sit concealed until dusk,
then start calling for food.

The small species are great insect-eaters ; large moths, cock-
chafers, dor beetles, and caterpillars are eagerly taken, and though
they could not get at them for themselves, I have found cockchafer
larvae greatly appreciated, in fact a sick bird will take them when
all other food is refused, and can often be kept alive by these means.
Hairy caterpillars are refused. Large spiders are usually accepted.
Eagle, Wood, and Sparrow Owls are mostly frequent bathers,
and though they can exist without water, they do drink. They
also enjoy an occasional sun bath ; I have seen a whole row of
Eagle Owls lying in full sun, wings extended and feathers ruffled,
for half an hour at a time. The Wood Owls occasionally do this,
and the Little and Sparrow Owls, but not the Barn Owls or the
Scops.
It cannot be too strongly emphasized that all Owls without
exception must be given fur or feather if they are to be healthy.
Raw meat or liver may occasionally be substituted, but if it is made
the sole diet the Owl will die from digestive disease. They cannot
make their castings and an Owl that makes no castings is doomed.
In pre-war days Burrowing Owls occasionally came into the
market and found a ready sale. They are most amusing little
creatures if they are given the wherewithal to burrow, and their
requirements are simple ; a mound of turf and sand with a drain
pipe passage into its interior will please them mightily, they will
excavate a chamber for themselves and spend their time popping
in and out, sitting on the top and bobbing up and down as if
pulled by a string. They resent any interference with curses
loud and deep, and take refuge in the innermost recess of their
castle, whence proceed hisses and weird grumblings. They breed
inside the burrow well out of sight, but one day on going the
rounds one finds the population doubled, sometimes even trebled,
and all the little birds bobbing up and down. They are very hardy
and easily managed, the only risk is that if the mound is not firm
enough it may fall in and bury them alive ; the drain pipe, however,
minimizes this risk.
These are the Owls which travellers assert live on the South
American prairies in the burrows made by prairie dogs, and share
their habitation with rattlesnakes, this last being a picturesque
" traveller's tale ".
I suppose Barn Owls would be considered least interesting,

as they are in hiding and asleep all day, but if visited at dusk they
show off their beauty, which is not small, and " mop and mow "
very entertainingly. It is said that every country has its own
Barn Owl, and certainly we soon acquired a long series mostly very
much alike, and all, it appeared, ready to interbreed. There were,
however, some exceptions, the " Bay Owl 55 (Phodilus badius)
from Indo-China and the New Guinea species (Strix arfagi) could
not possibly be confused with the ordinary type. We have a pair
of the former, one of which is sitting, possibly on fertile eggs, but
it is too soon to be certain, and from the indifference shown by her
mate I have grave doubts. This Owl has a cream-coloured breast,
and under parts rather sparsely spotted and a bright bay back.
Its face is round and has a decided crest, and the eyes are black.
When Mr. Shaw Mayer came home from collecting in New
Guinea three years ago, he brought a very pretty little Owl, a very
rare specimen only known by one skin in the Natural History
Museum. This charming bird, about the size of the " Little Owl ",
is finger tame, and loves to be noticed and petted. Unfortunately
there is no hope of obtaining a mate for him (or her). Its scientific
name is Glaucidium tephronotum , but in the family it is known as
" Tweedle " from its soft trilling call when it sees its friends.
If it is desired to liberate a hand-reared Owl or one that has
been some time in captivity it must be trained to kill for itself
before it is set free. If this is not done the bird will starve to
death in the midst of its natural food. It either has not learnt
or has forgotten how to catch its prey and just remains perched
on a branch until it drops dead from hunger.
It was a great pity that Mr. Lewis's collection had to be
dispersed, it attracted many distinguished visitors, heads of zoos,
and private collectors from the Continent and the United States ;
in fact, more interest was shown in the Owls by scientists than
in all the other rarities in the Pheasant and Parrot sections,
attractive though they undoubtedly were. Perhaps, when the
world has recovered its sanity, if we are not all reduced to beggary
before then, a day may dawn when a still finer assembly of Owls
will adorn these aviaries. May it come soon is the fervent prayer
of E. F. Chawner.

<bodyText confidence="0.97436252" page_id="56314358"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
By Alan Lendon, F.R.C.S., Adelaide, South Australia
My previous attempts to breed the various species of Australian
Parrakeets in captivity in their own country have in former years
been recorded elsewhere. The past season (February, 1939-
January, 1940), has been the most successful that I have yet
experienced. During the year under review I have had pairs of
thirty-three different species of Australian Parrakeets of which
twenty-four were encouraged to breed at one time or another,
during the twelve months under consideration, by being segregated
in an aviary to themselves provided with suitable nesting facilities.
Of these twenty-four, eleven species successfully reared young,
one species hatched young without rearing them, two species laid
but failed to hatch any young, and most of the remaining ten
showed some inclination to go to nest without actually laying.
The total number of young birds successfully reared was forty.
My breeding aviaries consist of a row of twelve parallel flights
each 6 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 6 feet high, with a shelter of the
same width at the rear of each, 4 feet deep and rising to a height
of 7J feet, and a second row of nine similar aviaries differing only
in that the flights are 9 feet long instead of 6 feet. In addition
I have a considerably larger aviary accommodating those species
not provided with separate aviaries, in which breeding is not
attempted except under special circumstances on account of the
fighting which occurs if a nesting log is introduced therein. I shall
now proceed to deal with the results of each species in detail.

In the same month I was fortunate in being able to secure from
Mr. Waddel, of Melbourne, a fine hen which had been bred by
him in the spring of 1937. She settled down well with her new
mate, and in September and October feeding was seen on many
occasions, but a good deal of bickering also occurred and she never
seemed particularly interested either in the hollow log provided,
or in the wooden box which was similar to that in which she

Feeding and mating observed in September and October,
but the hen appeared only mildly interested in the log provided.
She is a tame bird and I hope to replace her when the opportunity
occurs. This is the only Rosella which has not yet been bred in
captivity in South Australia.
10. Yellow-bellied Parrakeet [Green Rosella] ( Platycercus
caledonicus)
The male, which was an aviary-bred bird, was killed in a
brawl in the large aviary in September. I was not able to replace
him until November when the pair were placed in a breeding
aviary, but they showed no inclination to go to nest.
11. Pale-headed Rosella [Mealy Rosella] (. Platycercus adscitus)
Six eggs were laid late in August, of these three proved infertile.
One young hatched on 13th September, and a second on the
following day, the remaining egg was fertile but failed to hatch.
All went well until 22nd September when both young were found
to be dead in the nest ; rather suspect interference from the pair
of Princess Alexandras which shared the aviary, and at that time
appeared to be in breeding condition. A second clutch of four
eggs was laid about the middle of October, and one of these was
thrown out of the nest, a second proved infertile, the third, though
fertile, failed to hatch, and the fourth hatched about the middle
of November and the young bird, a hen, was successfully reared,
leaving the log on 13th December. A very fine cock bird, evidently
an escapee, was caught on the aviaries in September.
12. Brown's Parrakeet [Northern Rosella] (. Platycercus venustus )
A clutch of four eggs, one of which was infertile, was laid
about the middle of August, and three young were seen in the log
on 13th September. They flourished and left the nest on 14th and
15th October, being very fine specimens, two hens and a cock.
This is the first recorded breeding of this species in South Australia,

other than at the Zoo, where two clutches were reared from a
pair earlier this season.
13. Eastern Rosella (. Platycercus eximius)
Feeding and mating observed in September and October, but
not segregated. In October I succeeded in obtaining a hen of the
golden-mantled or splendid sub-species, the first to come into my
possession. To date I have not been able to procure a cock bird,
although they are common enough in captivity in Brisbane.
14. Stanley Parrakeet [Western Rosella] (. Platycercus icterotis)
Feeding observed in October--not segregated.
15. Barnard's Parrakeet [Ring-necked Parrot] ( Barnardius
barnardi)
I disposed of one pair of birds of this species in July of this
year, keeping the male who was anxious to breed when mated to
a Mealy Rosella last season and the hen to whom he seemed
most attracted. However, although the hen came into breeding
condition in September, and feeding was observed on several
occasions, nothing further happened.
16. Cloncurry Parrakeet (. Barnardius macgillivrayi )
I obtained my first example of this rare species, a young male,
in April, and in August I was fortunate enough to obtain a further
pair. The latter were anxious to go to nest soon after they arrived,
and the first clutch of five eggs was laid at the end of September.
Of these, one disappeared, two more were infertile, the fourth
contained a fully developed embryo which failed to hatch, and
the fifth hatched on 20th October, but the young bird only survived
three days. A second clutch of four was laid in the middle of
November, again two proved infertile, the remaining two hatched
early in December, but one only survived a few days, the remaining
one was successfully reared and left the log on 9th January, soon
after which the hen laid a third clutch which she is incubating at
the time of writing. This unique breeding has been described in
a separate article in the Avigultural Magazine.

17. Bauer's Parrakeet [Port Lincoln Parrot] ( Barnardius
zonarius )
In March of last year I obtained a new mate for the hen which
had laid and incubated infertile eggs last season. This season a
clutch of four eggs was laid about the middle of September, all
of which hatched early in October, and all of which were reared
and left the nest towards the middle of November, being two of
each sex. This is the first recorded breeding of this species in
South Australia.
18. Yellow-naped Parrakeet [Twenty-eight Parrot]
(.Barnardius semitorquatus)
Feeding was frequently observed in the spring and the hen spent
much time in the log but no eggs appeared.
19. Pileated Parrakeet [Red-capped Parrot] ( Purpureicephalus
spurius)
A clutch of five eggs was laid about the middle of October,
four of which proved fertile and hatched early in November ;
approximately ten days later all four young were found dead.
The parents appeared to have ceased feeding them, and immediately
after their death commenced to moult. This species has been
successfully bred in the Adelaide Zoo in the last two seasons.
20. Red-vented Blue Bonnet ( Psephotus hamatogaster hamatorrhous)
In March I was able to secure a hen of this species that had
laid in captivity the previous spring. She soon mated to the
undoubted cock of my two previously acquired birds, and laid
a clutch of six eggs towards the end of August. All the eggs proved
fertile and duly hatched, but three of the young birds died in the
first few days, and a fourth when about half-grown. The two
survivors left the nest towards the end of October, both showed
the chestnut shoulder patches of the adults, though to a lesser
degree, and one, the male, had yellow sub-caudals while the other,
a female, had red. However, at the first moult the yellow sub-
caudal feathers of the male have been replaced by red ones, thus
confirming the fact that this species or sub-species, whichever it

be regarded as, breeds true to type. This is the first recorded
breeding of any of the Blue Bonnets in South Australia.
21. Yellow-vented Blue Bonnet ( Psephotus fuematogaster
xanthorrhous)
The pair of this species, which I have now had for about four
years, once again showed no particular interest in nesting.
22. Little Blue Bonnet [Naretha Parrakeet] (. Psephotus naretha)
Beyond the hen occasionally visiting the log provided, this pair
did not show any great desire to go to nest. The hen is supposed
to have laid in captivity about two years ago, but I have grave
doubts as to the accuracy of the statement.
23. Hooded Parrakeet (. Psephotus dissimilis)
This year, the first clutch, consisting of five eggs, was laid at
the end of February and beginning of March. All were fertile but
one failed to hatch and another died during the first week, the
remaining three being successfully reared and leaving the nest
late in April. The second clutch, again of five eggs, was laid late
in June, all were fertile and hatched but again only three were
reared, leaving the nest about the middle of August.
24. Many-coloured Parrakeet (. Psephotus varius)
This pair of birds, which laid two clutches of eggs without
incubating them last year, had a very good season. The first
clutch consisted of six eggs, laid late in July and early in August ;
five were fertile and were duly hatched and reared, leaving the
nest towards the end of September, and being two males and three
females. The second clutch was laid at the end of October and
consisted of five eggs, four of which were fertile and hatched and
were reared, the young leaving the nest about the middle of
December and being two of each sex.
25. Red-rumped Parrakeet (. Psephotus hamatonotus)
This pair were not segregated during the year under review.

26. Bourke's Grass Parrakeet (Neophema bourkei)
This season my old breeding hen was mated to a son bred in
1937. The first clutch of seven eggs was laid about the middle of
September, and all hatched. One died early, the remainder leaving
the nest late in October and early in November, but of these, the
two youngest were not properly fledged and did not survive. The
second clutch was commenced early in November, before the last
two young had left the nest, and eleven eggs in all were laid, but
the hen did not incubate. A third clutch was commenced early
in December and consisted of nine eggs, four of which proved
infertile and were removed ; of the remaining five, two hatched
early in January, the remaining three contained only partly-
developed embryos. These two young ones did not survive longer
than a fortnight, due, I think, to the parents starting to moult.
27. Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet (.Neophema chrysostoma)
The pair of this species, which last year had infertile eggs,
this season laid very late in the year, as is usual with them. The
clutch consisted of six eggs laid at the beginning of December,
five of which were fertile and duly hatched late in the same month
but two young ones died very early and a further two when they
were about half grown. The fifth survived and left the nest at the
end of January, being an undoubted cock bird from its appearance.
28. Elegant Grass Parrakeet (Neophema elegans)
A young hen, bred last year, was left in the same aviary as
her parents and early in the spring it became apparent that she
had mated up with her father. As the old hen had plucked her
young ones in the nest the previous season I removed her, and the
young hen laid a clutch of eggs early in August, all of which dis-
appeared. A further clutch of five eggs was laid at the end of
August, one proved infertile, the remaining four hatched towards
the end of September but all were dead in a few days. I then
replaced the old hen and she laid a clutch of four eggs by the
middle of October which I thought might be infertile as the cock
bird did not seem very pleased about the change of wives at first,
but three proved fertile and hatched about the middle of November.
Once again, the hen plucked the young in the nest, this year worse

than last, as she pulled out all their tail feathers in addition to
a number of body feathers, so that they were sorry sights when they
left the nest in the middle of December. However, a month later
they had grown new feathers and looked none the worse for their
ordeal.
29. Rock Grass Parrakeet (. Neophema petrophila)
These birds showed no signs of nesting this season, either in
logs provided or amongst a heap of rocks. I sometimes wonder
whether I have a true pair, as this is admittedly a difficult species
to sex.
30. Turquoise Grass Parrakeet (, Neophema pulchella)
For the third year in succession the hen has failed to incubate
her eggs and I hope to be able to replace her before next season.
This year, the first clutch was commenced about the middle of
September, most of the early eggs were broken and after about
fourteen eggs had been laid the nesting log was removed. When
replaced a second clutch was commenced in the middle of
November, and after eleven eggs had been laid it was again
removed.
31. Scarlet-chested Grass Parrakeet ( Neophema splendida)
A new hen, obtained late in 1938, was mated to a cock bird
bred by me in January, 1937. Her first clutch consisted of six
eggs laid about the middle of September, all hatched but three
died early, the remaining three survived and left the nest early
in November, all being cock birds. A second clutch, this time
of four, was laid in the middle of November, again all hatched,
but again only three were reared, leaving the nest early in January,
this time being two cocks and a hen.
32. Swift Parrakeet ( Lathamus discolor)
I obtained a nice pair of this species, which I had not kept
for some three years, in March, both being birds which had been
some time in captivity. They were not segregated for want of
space but feeding was observed in November. They have thrived
on the usual seed mixture, plus apple or other fruit and green
food given most days.

hatch. Shortly afterwards the hen lost her upper mandible in
a fight, presumably with the pair of Redrumps which were always

In March of 1939 I arrived in Sumatra for a four-month
stay. I was determined by hook or crook to secure some live birds
to bring back to America. Particularly desirable, it seemed to
me, were the long-tailed Peacock Pheasant ( Polyplectron cholcurus ),
the Rhinoceros Hornbill ( Buceros r. rhinoceros ), and, at the prompting
of my friend, Mr. Maresi, the Sumatran Silver Ear ( Mesia argentauris
laminae). The latter bird is certainly one of the most beautiful
Sumatran birds and the most colourful member of its family.
My wanderings led me to Atjeh, the northern province of the
island. Here I found unfortunately, that the native Acheenese,
in contrast to the skilful Bataks farther south, are completely
lacking in ability as trappers. During the three months that I
stayed in Atjeh, in spite of repeated urgings on my part, they
caught only one pair of Pheasants, no Hornbills, and no Mesias.
In contrast to my previous experiences with East Indian peoples,
the Acheenese showed a great and whole-hearted apathy towards
the jungle and all that it contained ; and this, in spite of the fact
that never have I encountered such mercenary or avaricious beings.
As one travels about the East Indies, perhaps only up or down one
of the great islands, it is curious to observe the contrast in energy
and intelligence as well as local customs shown by neighbouring
tribes. In one place, for example, bow and arrow people make good

traps, while their neighbours who use spears do not. As for the
Acheenese, they have used guns for so long and are so agriculturally
minded, that they are not jungly men any more.
Unfortunately my other work preoccupied my time or I
should have had a try at trapping myself. The northern part of
Sumatra is very wild and beautiful, long ranges of mountains rising
to 10,000 or more feet, interspersed with narrow sheltered valleys.
Some of the valleys are thick with jungle, with occasional native
clearings for villages, gardens, and rice paddies. Others have
been burnt over at some past time and are covered with grass
and scattered clumps of a huge pine, Pirns merkousii, locally used
for the extraction of turpentine.
The rice paddies were a fairly good hunting ground for my
trappers. Here they were able to get Munias, Parrot Finches, and
even some Water Hens, Amaurornis, the latter a rather striking
bird in captivity. I also was able to secure the Bay Owl ( Phodilus
b. badius). This beautiful little lilac-tinted Barn Owl is one of the
loveliest of all its kind. It is a rather engaging bird in captivity,
as it has a curious dance that it performs when startled or excited,
shaking its shoulders from side to side rather in the style of an
Hawaiian hula. Two other species that were caught for me were
the sombre but beautiful blue Whistling Thrush ( Myophonus
melanurus) and the White-headed Laughing Thrush ( Garrulax
leucolophus bicolor ). The latter has a charming little song in captivity
in contrast to its insane laughing calls in the jungle.
A walk through the jungle is a fascinating experience. The
underbush is alive with activity. Along the stream, black and
white Forktails dip and run like Sandpipers. Flycatchers and
Babblers move about erratically among the low shrubs and vines.
Higher up a Barbet is seen, a statuesque little figure, perching bolt
upright on a branch, sending out his monotonous " tok tok
Woodpeckers and Nuthatches are everywhere, reminding one,
except for their brilliant colours, of a more northern fauna.
Occasionally there is a flash of colour, and that incredibly coloured
Bee-eater ( Nyctiornis amicta) is seen, pink and violet forehead
contrasting with vivid green upper parts. Broadbills, the most
brightly coloured family of all, are common in this jungle, ranging
from the Parrakeet-like pale green and yellow Psarisomus to the
duller black and scarlet " Great-Billed Tody " of Latham.

Malkohas, those startling looking green and red billed Cuckoos,
are common too, creeping about among the higher branches, and
sometimes a harsh call announces the brown monk's cap and long
black and white tail of a Tree Pie (Dendrocitta ).
Mammals are seen very often in this jungle, principally gibbons,
langurs, and tree shrews. Once coming into an opening at the
bend of a small stream, I looked up into the wall of trees opposite,
and saw another man staring down at me, an old man of the
jungle, an Orang-utan. I judged him to be a male and a fairly
big one at that, but he looked small indeed in those enormous trees.
The most striking thing about him was his colour, so very red against
the green. We surveyed each other for some time. He confined
himself to small movements to show his nervousness, the impatient
breaking of a twig or pouting of the lips. Finally I stood up to
go, and he decided to leave also. It was then that I was conscious
of his comparative clumsiness. Here was no agile and effortless
gibbon's progress, but rather the careful advance of a rheumatic
old man. Every branch must be tested, every vine shaken, and
once or twice I quite literally saw him stumble. Poor " Men of
the Forest ". Their unsuspicious nature and slow-moving ways
have doomed them to an early extinction unless they can be
protected from marauding humans by some efficient system of
forest preserves.
Leaving Atjeh in May I returned to Medan, the capital of
Sumatra. There is a dealer here from whom one can get a good
many of the smaller species, Bulbuls, Barbets, and the little hanging
Lorikeets. He also had some of the long-tailed Peacock Pheasants
that I wanted and a pretty good collection of Hornbills, including
one Rhinoceros Hornbill. To export Hornbills nowadays from
the Netherlands East Indies one must get a special permit from
the Department of Economic Affairs in Batavia.
In June I sailed for home, heartily regretting that I had to
leave such a beautiful island. Our first port of call was Penang,
that delightful little island off the coast of Malaya with the
beautiful view across to the Kedah peaks. There is a bird store
here, but it is rather small and poorly stocked. Strangely enough,
however, there were a good many Lories and several Cockatoos.
How these Moluccan birds had ever arrived in Penang was a
question that the shopkeeper's Chinese and my Malay could not

agree on. Three or four years ago there was a German dealer
who lived in Penang who had a great many Orang-utans, one of
them being the largest that I have ever seen in captivity, measuring
12 feet between his fingertips. Fortunately this dealer's trade
has been stopped now, as his captive animals used to die like flies.
From Penang we came to Singapore where there are many
interesting things for the aviculturist. There are fully half a dozen
Chinese shops, most of whom deal in poultry to be sure, but all
of whom have some cage birds on display. Several of them have
mammals, too, and I will never forget the surprise that one shop-
keeper sprang on me. Taking me into the back building of his
house, he announced that he had something wonderful to show
me. He opened a door and propelled me into a room which, it
suddenly seemed to my startled eyes, I was sharing with a full-
grown tiger. The tiger gave one leap and landed up against
some iron bars between him and me which I had failed to notice.
So great was my agitation, however, that I also leaped, but back-
wards and on to a low crate. With a tearing noise my foot went
through the top of the box, and I found that I was standing on
the back of a large python. Needless to say, the shock of all this
was such that I was forced to retire to Raffle's Hotel and sample
some of their cooling refreshments.
Singapore has, or rather had, a Zoo which was simply an
animal dealer's clearing house. At one time there was quite a
good display of birds here, mostly Birds of Paradise, Waterfowl,
and Pheasants. There was also a very pretty aviary full of little
Sunbirds and Honey-eaters. Now, however, that has all been
given up, a good deal of the stock which hadn't died in the mean-
time has been sold to America and Europe, and the place looks
rather deserted. I did see a nice pair of the lovely Philippine
Mallard (A. luzonica ), but was afraid that they would not stand
the long journey home. The birds at the Singapore Zoo always
look rather underfed and perhaps that is why they seem to have a
tendency to get pneumonia. There is a nice Zoo in Johore half
an hour out of Singapore. It is run and owned by the Sultan's
heir and has by far the most expensive and elaborate equipment
of any Zoo in the East. There is a pond for the Waterfowl where
the herd of Sambar deer also come down to bathe, and here I
saw some nice Magpie Geese (Anseranas semipalmata ), not a very

common bird in captivity. Also flying in and out of the pond at
will was a large flock of Tree Duck of various species, Dendrocygna.
Hongkong was our next port of call, and although I was
pleased to see the famous island at last, I was tremendously dis-
appointed with the bird stores. Canaries and Java Sparrows
seemed to form the main stock of the stores along with Chinese
White Eyes (#*sterops) . Hongkong, however, is more famous for
its bird cages than its birds. These come in a great variety of
shapes and sizes, and are beautifully and elaborately made with
so many knickknacks and gadgets incorporated in them that
one rather wonders where the bird can fit in. I had hoped to
find some Pheasants here, as there is still a certain amount of
trade going on with the river ports, but in this I was disappointed.
Two days later, sailing up the Yangtse to Shanghai, I wondered
as we passed the bombed buildings where the Chinese Lost Battalion
had held out, if there would be anything of interest left to see in
the most international of cities. I might have realized that the
slogan would be " business as usual ". In spite of this fact and the
tremendous gaiety and activity on all sides, the bird shops here
again were practically empty. Pheasants, except for Goldens and
Ringnecked, were non-existent. One shop seemed to be entirely
full of Australian Gouldian Finches, which can be bought more
cheaply at home. I did find some nice birds in a Chinese store.
There was a lovely long-tailed Paradise Flycatcher ( Tchitrea
paradisi) in the grey plumage with a 7 in. tail. There were
also Barbets of two species ( Cyanops ) and a very pretty red and
grey Woodpecker, which I did not get and so far haven't identified.
On my arrival in Shanghai I had been sorry to hear of the recent
death of Floyd Tangier Smith, the almost legendary animal
collector who, I believe, brought out the first live White and
Blue Manchurians (Crossoptilon) , as well as several Pandas.
Leaving Shanghai after a few days we went on towards Japan,
and as we sailed through the Inland Sea my hopes rose high
that perhaps I could satisfy a long-held ambition and find an
Ijima's Pheasant. What was my excitement, therefore, when I
found a splendid bird store in Kobe with a large stock of birds.
My first question was about Copper Pheasants, and sure enough
the owner had a cock bird of this rare and interesting form of
Syrmaticus, illustrated in Aviculture in 1937. He also had a splendid

Lidth's Jay from the island of Oshima, as well as a large supply
of Australian cage birds. Parrots, Cockatoos, and, of course,
numbers of Finches. In his garden he had some cages of rare
animals, a Korean Wolf, Japanese Sea Lions, and several kinds
of monkeys. What I was also delighted to see was a young specimen
of the rather uncommon Philippine Hornbill, a sombre but effective
bird with brownish head and red bill. I could not resist also
some of the Japanese poultry, which have always seemed to me
to be far too stylish for the barnyard. There is one sort of Bantam
that is all white, about five inches long, with a perfectly straight
up and down io in. black tail. Then, of course, there are the
Silkies, which I have always liked, and the Tosa Fowl or Long-
tailed Yokohamas, which come in several colour patterns and
have to be more or less permanently kept on perches to preserve
their tails.
Kobe has the best bird store in Japan, but there is also a fairly
good one in Yokohama, where I found two Formosan Magpies
(Urocissa ccerulea ), a striking all-blue bird that was illustrated not
long ago in the pages of Aviculture. They also had some nice Ducks
and Pheasants, but strangely enough only one cock bird of each
kind, never pairs. Most of the Japanese aviculturists do not
breed birds, but simply keep a single male on exhibition. In
Tokyo I had a chance to see several collections, and was much
struck by the variety and excellence of the birds kept. One collector
had a splendid group of birds from the Caroline and Mariannes
Islands, particularly the fruit-eating Pigeons, a family not easy
to keep in captivity. I also saw a fine collection of Waterfowl,
all kept in individual pens for each pair in the Continental manner.
It was amusing to see specimens of our American Wood Duck, or
Carolina, being treated with such reverence in this collection,
while Baer's Pochard and the White-winged Duck ( Asarcornis )
passed almost unnoticed. I was particularly interested by the
latter birds, as the female had made a large nest of straw in a
box raised about 4 feet off the ground. However, nothing so
far had come of it.
Ten days out from Yokohama, I woke up one morning to see
the high brown hills of Oahu Island outlined against the sunrise.
Honolulu is a pleasant warm-hearted place enough, although a
bit too civilized to be considered part of the South Seas any

more. There is a fine new bird park here run by Mr. Lewis, who
used to manage the one on Catalina Island just off the coast of
California. I was delighted to see here specimens of the fascinating
and vanishing Hawaiian Goose (Nesochen sandvicensis ), a rare bird
indeed. A pair of Australian Brush Turkeys were nesting here,
and nearly every day a chick would suddenly appear in the pen
from out. of the great sand and compost pile.
Another week and our ship drew into the harbour of San
Francisco. Once through the delays and anxieties of landing, and
I drew a sigh of relief indeed to be on home soil again with my
precious cargo. The lure of the East Indies is great, however,
greater indeed to those who know the islands if only a little.
Perhaps some day I shall go again, and if that day does come
I know that the thought of the trials and difficulties will be quite
swept out of mind by the wonderful anticipation of walking again
through the jungles and the myriad strange towns and bazaars

In the Ibis for 1931 (p. 468 ), Mr. Gregory M. Mathews had
an interesting article on John Latham, the eighteenth century
ornithologist. He gave a full account of his life and works, but
(as was perhaps natural in such a place) never mentioned anything
to suggest that the learned doctor was a bird-fancier as well as
an ornithologist. This, I think, is obvious from his interest in bird-
shops and new arrivals, as well as in the aviary-doings of the birds
kept by his friends, notably Marmaduke Tunstall, who must have
had a good aviary. The following extracts from our subject's
General History of Birds (ten volumes, 1821-4), all dealing with
a fancy aspect of the birds described, can be taken as proofs of
his claim to be considered a fancier. This work commences with
the Birds of Prey and ends with the Darters, etc. ; here we take
an order more convenient from our point of view and commence
with the Finches and other small birds, the more typical cage-
birds.

These receive plenty of fancy-mention. Taking the European
birds first, we have the CHAFFINCH (vol. vi, 38), " ranked
among our singing birds, very pleasing to some . . .," the GOLD-
FINCH (75), " much esteemed for its fine note as well as great
tameness and docility. ..." A black variety (hemp-fed) is referred
to on p. 77, and mules with the Canary on the next page. The
SISKIN, " often kept and paired with the CANARY BIRD,
with which it breeds freely ; it is a very tame and docile species "
(83). The AMERICAN YELLOW FINCH (i.e. the American
Siskin) " is easily familiarized to confinement . . . Tunstall . . .
kept them . . . both sexes lost their yellow colour in winter and
became pale olive, but recovered their beautiful yellow plumage
in spring " (1/9). The GREEN GROSBEAK (i.e. the Greenfinch)
" soon becomes tame . . . and will produce if paired with the
Canary" (", 215 ). LINNETS AND TWITES are mentioned
on pp.g6,100, and the RING FINCH (which is the Rock Sparrow)
on p. 34 ; it is described as often kept in cages, where " it soon
becomes familiar, but has a very trifling note ". Three pages are
allotted to the CANARY FINCH ( 86-g ), where its song, breeding,
and mules are dealt with and its date of introduction to Europe
given as 1555. The SERIN FINCH and the CITRIL FINCH
{go, gi ) " are esteemed for their song ", and SERINS DE
MOZAMBIQUE are included in the account of the CANARY
{8g) ; these are of course what we know as " Green Singing
Finches ", Serinus mozambicus , etc. Another Serin mentioned
{vi, 101), is the ANGOLA FINCH, which Latham says, " is
probably the c Vengoline 5 mentioned by . . . Barrington, which
he says will sing better than any bird which is not European,
except the American Mocking Bird ". This is the Angola or
Yellow-rumped Singing Finch, which is by far the best singer of
the African Serins which are kept as cage-birds.
The BULLFINCH, we read, is u very docile when tame, not
only learning to pipe tunes, but to articulate words " ; in a foot-
note {p. 218 ), piping Bullfinches from Germany are referred to ;
the Common CROSSBILL is said {v, 20j) to sing very prettily

GROSBEAK (=S. nigroaurantia ), and the " DUSKY FINCH,
Fringilla ohscura of the Ind. OrnP, described from a cage-bird
(vi, 102 ), is probably another, while the BROWN-CHEEKED
GROSBEAK is the Cuba Finch, which is described from a living
one in the collection of Mr. Tunstall, and said to " have a soft
and fine note ; . . . a lively, pretty bird, but did not change the
colour ... at any season " (z&gt;, 286).
Of other foreign Fringillida the CARDINAL GROSBEAK
(i.e. the Red Cardinal), receives most notice from a fancier's
point of view (v, 274), " frequently kept in cages, in which it
sometimes sings the whole year through . . . and the female is
not greatly inferior to the male in respect of song ; . . . old ones
taken ... in traps . . . soon grow familiar. . . . Attempts
have been made to breed these birds in confinement, but with
only partial success. Mr. Tunstall had a pair which built a nest
in an orange tree placed in an aviary, and eggs were laid, but
whilst the hen was sitting, a high wind blew down the nest and the
eggs were broken ; young birds were, however, found in them.
There is another instance on record, but I have not heard whether
the young birds were brought to perfection." * The INDIAN
GROSBEAK, which Latham thinks may be the same as the
Cardinal, " is said to have a pleasing voice, readily imitating the
human speech." DOMINICAN GROSBEAKS and the CRESTED
DOMINICAN GROSBEAKS (i.e. the Popes and Grey Cardinals),
were also kept by Tunstall, some for many years, but he could
never tell cock from hen (z;, 278, 27g). The RED-THROATED
TANAGER (vi, 15) is probably another Paroaria, probably gularis ;
" it bears confinement in a cage and will feed on all sorts of seeds,
as well as insects."
The RED-BREASTED GROSBEAK (i.e. the North American
Rose-breasted Grosbeak (v, 280), " sings pretty well, and is some-
times kept in cages for that purpose " ; and the BLUE GROSBEAK,
Loxia ccvrulea " (a Cyanocompsa or Guiraca) is also kept in cages,
but seldom sings there " (271).

The PAINTED BUNTING (i.e. the Nonpareil, is " frequently
kept in cages in England, and may be fed on millet, succory, and
other seeds. The Dutch contrive to breed these in Holland, but
we believe the attempt has rarely succeeded in England. I was
assured by the late Mr. Tunstall that it has happened more than
once, and that two pairs made nests and laid eggs in orange trees
in a menagerie of a friend of his at Holderness, but . . . the young
were not hatched. The above gentleman has kept many, but
seems to think that they gain their full plumage sooner than the
third year . . ." (z 1,348). The INDIGO BUNTING is described
on p. 346, where it is said to sing like a Linnet and be known by
some as the " Minister ", by others as the " Bishop ".
Some half-dozen other Buntings are mentioned as cage-birds.
The CIRL as " easily tamed and now and then kept in cages "
with a footnote to say that Colonel Montagu was successful in
rearing them from the nest" (v, 301 ) ; the ORTOLAN (295),
as caught on passage in large numbers and fattened for the table
in dark rooms with plenty of oats and millet, and on p. 234 we read
that Colonel Montagu had kept a female TAWNY BUNTING
(i.e. the Snow Bunting). The LESBIAN BUNTING (= E.fucata)
is mentioned as kept "in a cage in poultry yards in Lesbos and
Mitylene to give warning of the approach of Hawks " (v, 310).
What the FAMILAR BUNTING (v, 323) is I do not know ;
from the tricks described the account would seem based on tame
Java Sparrows, which to this day may be seen in the streets of
Singapore, etc., performing in the same way, but the description
does not fit. " It inhabits Java ... is exceedingly familiar, for
if the cage is opened, it would settle on the first person's hand that
was offered ; when anyone whistled it sang very sweetly in return ;
if it saw a dish of water it went immediately and bathed itself
therein ; it was fed with rice."
Weavers (. Ploceida )
Two Bishops ( Euplectes ) at least were known to Latham as
cage-birds, aurea and afra. Of the first under the name GOLD-
BACK GROSBEAK we read (v, 222) that " Mr. Tunstall had it
. . . and that one of his cocks lived nine or ten years " ; the same
fancier also had the BLACK-BELLIED GROSBEAK (.Euplectes

afra , the Napoleon Bishop of to-day) which moulted twice a year,
being brown in winter. The WEEVER ORIOLE (vol. Hi, iyy)
is the Rufous-throated Weaver, Sitagra cucullata. Its readiness to
weave in a cage is described and a preference noted for green and
yellow materials as against other colours. The GAPITAL
TANAGER of plate xciv, vol. vi, p. 23, is another Yellow
Weaver, Sitagra capitalis , and is probably the same bird as the
WEAVER BUNTING of v, 321, which also has " the disposition
to interweave silk between the wire of the cage ". Queleas were
apparently rarer then than now, for all that is said of them (v, 233)
is that RED-BILLED GROSBEAKS (= #U quelea) are " now and
then brought in cages to Europe 55 . The PHILIPPINE GROSBEAK
(v, 233), is the Baya Weaver ; it is said to sing like a Linnet and
be easily tamed and taught to do tricks, and the " RUFOUS-
CROWNED GROSBEAK, Loxia ochrocephala. Daudin., brought
from Cochin-China into Holland alive " (v, 240) is probably one
of the other Bayas, while the SUMATRAN GROSBEAK ( 241 ),
of which " a living specimen . . . was in the collection of Count
Carlson, of Stockholm ", may be Ploceella javanensis.
Two Whydahs are mentioned : the Paradise Whydah under
the name WHIDAH BUNTING, as " often brought alive into
Europe, where it frequently lives many years, and is in general
a lively and active species ( 312 ), and the Pin-tailed Whydah as
the VARIEGATED BUNTING, which " according to Edwards,
soon regains the long tail feathers after moulting " (315).
The GLOSSY FINCH [vi, 127), might be either the Combasou
[Hyp ocher a) or the Jacarini Finch ( Volatinia ), though the description,
" size of a Chaffinch . . . whole plumage deep black . . . South
America " is against either to a certain extent, and might more
exactly perhaps mean a Glossy Cowbird. Whatever it is, this
GLOSSY FINCH " is easily tamed and will be satisfied with
bread when kept in a cage " (? would any of the three suggested
alternatives really be so easily satisfied?--E. H.).
The PARADISE GROSBEAK [v, 223) is Amadina erycephala,
the Red-headed Finch. It is described as inhabiting " Angola . . .
whence it is not infrequently brought . . . Mr. Tunstall has a
pair, and was twice successful in hatching young in his aviary,
each time bringing one young bird to perfection ; one of them
lived a week, the other a fortnight, but was forsaken at the last

by the mother, probably from being too much disturbed ; while
the hen was sitting she was in strange agitation, writhing herself
into a form almost horrid, as if falling into convulsions ; the cock
frequently sang and would do so almost at command, but in so
low a note as scarcely to be heard except when quite close to the
cage ". The " Cut-throat " does not seem to be mentioned, and
the BRAZILIAN GROSBEAK, " Sometimes brought alive to
England," is probably the same bird as the PARADISE GROS-
BEAK (.277). The Blue-beaked Weaver is described under the
name CRIMSON-BREASTED GROSBEAK, in vol v, p. 222,
and a coloured plate provided, but it has no mention as a
cage-bird.
The Silverbills ( Aidemosyne ) appear under the names
WARBLING GROSBEAK (the African), and MALABAR GROS-
BEAK (the Indian Silverbill). Of the first (262) , we are told that
" it inhabits Africa and is frequently brought by our traders from
that part, but is not long-lived in our climate ", and under the
second, " inhabits the East Indies ... is frequently tamed and
serves to amuse its master ; a pair is always kept in the same
cage ; each bird has a small cord fastened round the body. The
owner holds one of them by the cord, and the other, though thrown
up into the air, always returns and sits by its companion . . . for
the above I am indebted to Dr. Buchanan."
The remaining Ploceidae mentioned are what we now know as
Waxbills ; of these Latham knew (or knew of) five as cage-birds.
These are (1) the AMADUVADE FINCH (i.e. the Avadavat)
which Mr. Tunstall had often kept and had observed that " they
became more spotted in proportion to their age " (vi, 105) ;
(2) the SENEGAL FINCH (i.e. the Firefinch) ; some of these our
author has apparently kept himself, and they are described as
easily caught, " familiar as cage-birds, and when once used to the
climate will frequently live five or six years in a cage. They have
been bred in Holland . . ." (vi, ioy) ; (3) the BLUE-BELLIED
FINCH, which we know as the Cordonbleu ; (4) the BRAZILIAN
FINCH, F. granatina Linn, which though wrongly assigned to
Brazil, is the Violet-eared Waxbill ; it is described as a lively
bird, with an agreeable song, which is frequently kept in cages
by the Europeans (vi, 145) ; of (5) the TEMPORAL FINCH
(our Sydney Waxbill), we read that it is common in New South

By H. Manfield (Head Bird Keeper)
It was with very deep regret that I had to report the untimely
death of the late Mr. R. R. Minchin, Director of the Royal Zoo-
logical Society of South Australia, on the 4th February of this year
after a short illness, at the age of 35 years.
Mr. Minchin was highly respected by all who knew him, and
more especially by those who came in close contact with him. He
was always willing and eager to exchange views in the bird world
and his wide knowledge on birds and animals made his name a
household word among all lovers of birds.
Mr. Minchin was born at Adelaide and lived the whole of his
life at the Zoological Gardens, having served his apprenticeship
under his father, the late Mr. A. C. Minchin, who was Director
of the Gardens for over forty years. Mr. A. C. Minchin succeeded
his father, Mr. R. E. Minchin, and this makes the third generation
of Minchins to occupy the position of Director.
Mr. Minchin was always ready to help bird fanciers with
advice and was one of the few who could always fulfil the task of
answering questions placed in the question box at the Avicultural
Society's monthly meetings. He was President of the Avicultural
Society for two years, and was always on the Committee, the
members never allowing him to resign.
Mr. Minchin was also an active member of the South Australian
Ornithological Society and acted on numerous occasions as judge
for different bird shows, etc., and his awards were always well
received by the exhibitors.

His success in breeding, at the Gardens, some of the rarer
species of Australian Parrakeets, such as Splendid or Scarlet-
chested, Hooded, Bourkes, Turquoisine, Blue-winged, and Princess
Alexandra's was outstanding. Over fifty Alexandras were reared
under his guidance in a little more than three years.
He was placed on record, by Dr. E. Hopkinson, as being the
first to breed the Javan Parrakeet ( Psittacula alexandri) and the
Green Conure ( Aratinga leucophthalmus) . He was awarded the
Avicultural Society's Bronze Medal for outstanding success in
breeding many rare birds (medals for breeding successes are not
available for Zoological Societies, etc.) as the committee and
members felt they could not allow his achievements to pass without
some recognition.
Of the fifty-nine species of Australian Parrots the Zoo houses
fifty-three, including two of the very rare Ground Parrakeets
(Pozoporus wallicus) . The bird collection has grown to be the
largest in the Southern Hemisphere under his guidance, and many
big improvements which have been carried out during his term
as Director will go down in the history of the Adelaide Zoological
Gardens.
Mr. Minchin travelled in connection with the Society, and in
1929 he went to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies ; in 1933
to New Zealand and later to Tasmania. He was in close touch
with all the Australian Zoological Gardens, and visited them
frequently, making many valuable exchanges.
He was one of the very few who could successfully claim to
have been able to acclimatize and keep in captivity the Green
Pigmy Goose ( Nettapus pulchellus) , of which a fine pair may be
seen in the Gardens to-day.
His numerous articles dealing with his bird experiences printed
from time to time in this Magazine will be missed by his large
number of readers all over the world, and in his passing in the
prime of life, bird lovers of this great world of ours will be the
poorer and we suffer a severe loss.

Death of Lady Lilford
It is with the deepest regret that we have to record the death, on 8th April,
of Lady Lilford, who had been a member of the Avicultural Society since 1898.
The name of Lilford will always be intimately associated with birds, and Lady
Lilford took the keenest interest in the fine collection which was established by
her father-in-law, the fourth Lord Lilford, whose great work for ornithology and
aviculture will ever be remembered. The aviaries and waterfowl enclosures at
Lilford Hall are well known and models of their kind, and Lady Lilford, though
leaving their management entirely in the capable hands of Mr. A. F. Moody,
always took an active interest in their inhabitants. She had been confined
to the house, through illness, since the beginning of the year, but on 6th April,
feeling much better and the day being particularly fine and mild, she ordered
her electric bath chair and paid her accustomed visit to the aviaries. She discussed
the birds with Mr. Moody and expressed her delight at being able to be out and
to see them again. She was taken ill that night and died two days later. Her
death is most keenly felt by all who knew her, especially those at Lilford who all
loved her dearly.

Breeding the Banksian Cockatoo
Mr. Gorman who, as is well known, has charge of the famous collection of
Parrots and Parrot-like birds belonging to the Marquess of Tavistock, sends the
following particulars of what is believed to be the first breeding of this species :
One egg was laid on the floor, as usual, in the aviary shelter on the 24th
October, 1939. The hen only incubated. The egg hatched on the 26th December,
and though its mother did not seem very devoted, the chick lived, possibly because
Mr. Gorman supplemented its rations at intervals. In spite of the cruel weather
it grew and was in perfect condition until it was four weeks and six days old and
well feathered. Then " brittle bone rickets " appeared, and the poor bird was
found to have both legs and both wings broken. Mr. Gorman took charge and
has hand-reared it to the present day, 15 weeks and 2 days from the time it
was hatched. It is still unable or unwilling to feed itself, though fully fledged.
It resembles the hen in plumage but the markings are duller.

By A. F. Moody
Four species of the genus Spatula are known, of these the
British representative, S. clypeata , is perhaps the most beautiful
as well as the most widely distributed. Taking S. clypeata as the
type, they all, with certain modifications, possess the long ungainly
bill, weak legs, and general outline of that species. Their general
behaviour and nesting habits, too, are very similar.
Common Shoveler (.Spatula clypeata)
In deference to the accompanying plate, nothing need be
said concerning the great beauty of the Common Shoveler. I will
mention only that a male when in colour is a conspicuous and a
pleasing addition to any group of wildfowl. The species nests
readily in semi-captivity, and like others of the group, prefers to
nest in meadow grass and often at a considerable distance from
the water. In many instances these nests, although situated in the
open, are so perfectly camouflaged that in the absence of the female
there is nothing to indicate the presence of the eggs except a small
circlet of down.
Argentine Shoveler (\0x25A0Spatula platalea)
The Argentine, Red, or Spotted Shoveler was introduced
into England about ten years ago. It is perfectly hardy, has bred
freely, and is now probably well established in Europe. In appear-
ance the male is a particularly handsome bird. The most noticeable
features of his plumage being his pearly grey head and neck,

tawny-pink black-spotted breast and sides, and a rather lengthy
tail the upper surface of which is bordered with white ; this
latter feature being also present in the adult female. This species
has annually bred at Lilford since 1934, broods of from seven to
nine being frequently reared.
Cape Shoveler (, Spatula capensis )
It is entirely owing to the initiative of Messrs. R. and N. Stevens
that this fine species has recently found a place in modern collec-
tions of waterfowl. Its introduction took place about four years ago
and at the time of writing probably less than a dozen pairs exist
in this country. This being the case, I would earnestly recommend
that every such rare bird, which in happier times would have formed
the nucleus of a European stock, be taken the greatest care of
and if possible be induced to breed. To some people this suggestion
during the present grave national crisis may seem out of place,
but I would remind any critic that there are many keenly interested
in waterfowl who are now serving with H.M. Forces. It would,
indeed, be a tragedy if on their return they were to find that rare
and interesting species which had taken years to get into this country
were lost and no longer available.
Known in its own country, I believe, as " The Slop ", the Cape
or African Shoveler is not a particularly prepossessing bird. The
general plumage of the male is dull, at the same time his conspicuous
chrome yellow legs, massive black bill, and green back give him a
handsome appearance. The female is considerably darker than
the English bird and also differs by having the dark tail crossed with
lighter bars.
Australian Shoveler ( S . rhynchotis )
\0x25A0k
A very rare bird in confinement and probably confined to
less than half a dozen examples in England.
Said to be more insectivorous than other Shovelers, the young
in particular being very difficult to rear. A native of Australia,
New Zealand, and Tasmania, the male of the present species
when in colour differs from other male Shovelers in having a white
face patch, reminding one of the male Blue-winged Teal.

By J. C. Laidlay
Waterfowl have had this winter more than their share of
hardships, for with a shortage of feeding stuffs, capped by such
severe weather, conditions have been as bad as they could be.
When war started I decided to release some of the hardy and
more common species on the lake here, which is 199 acres with
reed beds and edged by grass fields and cultivated ones, so I had
hopes they would find a sufficiency of food. But it was not the case
for the various Ducks, bar the Wigeon which grazed on the grass
lands, soon all disappeared, Ruddy, South African, and Paradise
Sheld-duck holding out longest and I think would have come
through the winter if it had not been for otters who got them
all by degrees. The Geese, Greylag, Whitefronted, Bean, Barnacle,
Canada, and Barheaded, looked well until about Christmas, then
their numbers began to diminish and obviously they were not
getting enough to eat as they came up to one to be fed. The frost
came then and the ice got to a depth of just over one foot and
remained so into March, so we caught up the remaining Geese
bar a pair of Cereopsis, who, despite the weather, had made a nest
on the edge of the ice. They did not lay though till two months
ago and had incubated their four eggs for about seventeen days
when both birds were stolen, the Geese being unfortunately so tame
as to allow any one to pick them up and handle them. Despite
their eggs being out all night in the keenest of frosts one hatched
out under a hen. Two Demoiselle Cranes were also let loose at the
same time and they alone remain looking now very fit. Of the
stock Ducks and Geese kept in pens we decided to put the whole
lot from various pens into one, the largest one ; their water was
of course frozen solid for months and it is of interest that all the
foreign Duck such as Cinnamon, Argentine Shoveler, etc., which
one might have expected to suffer from such severe conditions
came through well without a single death, but Common Shoveler
and Common Pochard died off in numbers. Coscoroba and Black-
necked Swans all died except for an old male Black-necked.
One Bewick died. Of the Geese the only deaths were most

unfortunately two female Red-breasted Geese. One pen of some 4
acres that we had evacuated in September had left in it some Blue
Snow and Magellan Geese ; they have received no food at all
and look in first class condition ; that, I think, is owing to this
particular pen being entirely marshlands, and as the short rushes
protruded above the snow it gave the birds something to graze on.
I expect the breeding results from this lot will be far better than
from the general pen as there the Geese get too much feeding
owing to the Ducks having to be fed, and I found from past
experience fertility among the Geese is reduced if they get too
much grain. Of all the birds set free only two were full winged,
which gave them a great advantage, and they, a male Pintail and
a male Wigeon, are flying about to-day. As a substitute for grain
we fed considerably on boiled potatoes which are much appreciated,
but whether owing to the weather or the feeding we usually get a
general start of laying in the first week of April, that is among
Carolina, Mandarin, Pintail, Red-crested Pochard, and the more
early species, but so far not one egg has been laid except from a pair
of Greylag. It will be interesting to see whether fertility will be
good or not and whether the clutches are up to average in numbers.

The exceedingly severe winter of 1939-40 caused great devasta-
tion among the birds of the Zoo of Budapest which have remained
in the open-air, and on the morning of 17th January, 1940, it
was found that the only specimen of the Sushkin's Bean Goose
(Anser neglectus Sushkin) had died.
This bird was a very famous specimen. It is not certain when
it arrived in the Zoo, because all the Geese are listed under the
name Anser fabalis Lath., but at the time of the 10th International
Zoological Congress in September, 1927, the late curator of the
ornithological section of the Zoo, Mr. F. R. Cerva, had already
designated it as this species. Mr. Sushkin was himself present
.at the Congress, and a discussion on this bird was held at the Zoo,
where at this time there were two specimens. Taking part in this

debate were Sushkin, Hartert, Rothschild, Stresemann, Vonoczky-
Schenk, and many others, but they could not come to an agreed
conclusion.
Some years ago one of the two specimens died, and the remaining
bird was always seen in the company of an Anser indicus Lath,
till his death in January, 1940. So the last living specimen on
which one has attempted the solution of this difficult systematical
question, one of the greatest in Ornithology, is no more. The
skeleton of the bird is conserved in the collection of the Royal
Hungarian Institute of Ornithology.
Let us see what is now the systematical position of the much
disputed Anser neglectus ? The breeding-range of the bird is unknown.
The longest discussion appeared in the Aquila , 1931-34, pp. 193-247,
from different authors, but the most important papers are those
of Dementiev (. Alauda , 1936, p. 169), and of Berry (Ibis, 1940,
p. 136). Dementiev contends that the Pink-footed Goose and
Bean Goose belong to the same species as A.f brachyrynchus
(Greenland, N.W. Europe), A.ffabalis (N.E. Europe, W. Siberia),
A. f. serrirostris (E. Siberia), A.f. middendorfi (E. Asia), and that
neglectus is an intermediate form between brachyrynchus and fabalis.
Again, Berry considers brachyrynchus and fabalis as two species,
and in the species fabalis belong the following races : fabalis
(N. Europe, N.W.W. Siberia), segetum (N.W. Siberia), serrirostris
(N.E. Siberia), middendorfi (E. Asia), neglectus (territory unknown).
Dementiev has up till now studied the greatest amount of material,
about 400 skins, so his opinion must carry the most weight, but
we are still far from the final conclusion, because the material from
the breeding period is still insufficient.
Most of the specimens of neglectus are shot in Hungary, but
here also it is very rare. It can be said that two or three birds occur
in about two years, therefore there are not many specimen^ even

The first half of the twentieth century will, in the years to come,
be looked upon as the blackest in the annals of the animal life of
the world. A great number of birds and mammals are now fast
approaching extinction and the mid-century will undoubtedly
see many of them out. The fierce slaughter in the last half of the
nineteenth century brought a great number of species to the
danger level, and the beginning of this century is witness to their
slow but sure decease. When species of birds get below a certain
numerical strength, they quickly start to disappear as they are
unable to supply that surplus which supplies their natural enemies.
As soon as the numbers reach the danger level the species is doomed
to extinction. It is heart breaking to travel the world over and
witness the gradual extinction of so many interesting and valuable
species. The Labrador Duck, the Passenger Pigeon, the Huia,
the Carolina Parrakeet, the Night Parrakeet, are but a few of
those which have already vanished and yet so little is being done
to save the many hundreds of species which are on the downward
trend.
Of New Zealand's ducks one, the Auckland Island Merganser,
is already recorded as extinct, two are on the danger list, one
decidedly so, and only one species can be called flourishing.
The New Zealand Brown Duck ( Elasmonetta chlorotis)
In keeping with the rest of the avifauna of New Zealand this
attractive species has sadly diminished since the advent of the
whitejman to the country. Once found in vast flocks over the whole
of both Islands, the main remnant is now confined to the northern
portion of the North Island above a line drawn across the Northern
Peninsula about a hundred miles north of Auckland and if one
looks at the map of New Zealand one will see what a small portion
of the whole this is. The bird has not absolutely gone from below
this line as odd birds and pairs are still found in isolated parts
of the North Island. Naturalists cannot advance any theory
regarding the gradual retreat northwards of this duck. This

retreat began about 1914 to 1916, before this the bird was plentiful
in the North Island and from that day onwards the bird has steadily
died out until now it cannot be seen in any numbers below the
Waipu Forest area.
When recently cruising up the north-east coast of New Zealand,
our main objective being to revisit the island sanctuaries, we called in
at Whangarei some twenty miles up the beautiful Whangarei river.
A young ornithologist in Auckland had given us an introduction to
a gentleman who had a farm some miles from Whangarei, and
we were told that we might see some of the Brown Duck on his
property. We motored out to the location and there found a very
charming gentleman farmer who protected the ducks for their
aesthetic and not their utilitarian value.
Situated in a wonderful setting enclosed by great hills partly
forest covered, we found an utterly unexpected sight. A winding
creek meandered with a hundred twists and turns through the
beautiful valley and on its surface we found hundreds of these
beautiful little ducks almost as tame as domestic poultry. For
seventeen years these birds had been protected ; they were never
fed and no attempt was made to tame them, but they were never
interfered with and their immunity from any form of persecution
had rendered them almost fearless. There must have been between
two and three hundred of these birds, quite, I should think, the
largest single flock now in existence, and they lived more or less on a
series of deep pools some hundred yards or more below the farm
house which was situated on a hillside. The ducks played, bickered,
and quarrelled, and generally behaved as though no humans were
in sight, even though we stood only a few yards away from them.
I have never seen tamer " wild " birds, especially duck, which in
the majority of cases take flight as soon as they sight a human being.
As we wished to examine some of these birds we were given
permission to catch several, and this was easily done by lying in
wait in the rushes at a narrow point in the stream and catching
them in a landing net. The birds did not seem unduly perturbed,
and we were able to examine them at our leisure. There was a
good percentage of fully coloured males, some with a half circular
white frontal collar at the base of the neck. The rest were young
males and females, and we were told that the percentage of males
was roughly seventy-five. Certainly most of the birds we caught

were males. The sex is easily distinguishable at an early age and
I was informed by an ornithologist who is an authority on ducks
that they can be sexed at five months as soon as they are fully
feathered. A strange thing I noticed was that some females swam
with their wings folded in such a manner that their flight feathers
pointed almost straight upwards above their backs, giving them
the appearance that they might have been injured, though this
of course was not so.
It was only very reluctantly that the birds took wing, but
contrary to the reports of the early observers who stated that the
birds had very poor powers of flight, they proved to be splendid
fliers, and several small flocks of about twenty or more circled
round for a considerable time high up in the air ; in fact I have
a beautiful photograph, taken from a negative kindly lent to me
by the gentleman who gave me the introduction, of a flight of
these ducks high in the sky. After a time they came down again
almost like meteors from the clouds, right down almost at our
feet on to their favourite pool. That day I learnt many interesting
things about these birds and many preconceived notions were
changed. I had expected to find from the meagre information
.gleaned from books that the birds were naturally very shy and
recluse, and also that they were strictly nocturnal, as it has been
always stated that the birds hide away during the day in the dense
and matted grasses which grow beside the rivers and swamps.
But I was told that the birds were just as much in evidence during
the day as at night, though they never appeared to feed during the
day but only at night. No one has been able to give any definite
information regarding the food of this bird, even Buller, the great
New Zealand ornithologist, is silent in regard to what these birds
subsist on. Perhaps this is not surprising as the bird is strictly
nocturnal in its feeding and the farmer at Kara, near Whangarei,
stated that not once during the seventeen years that he had the
birds under observation did he see them feeding during the day.
What is known, is that at night they leave the water and seek their
food in the grass some distance away. It would appear that their
diet consists of grasshoppers, moths, beetles, worms, etc., which
they find in the herbage. One person told me that when he was
in his paddock at night he was surrounded by the birds both
running round and flying. A young naturalist told me that he

found the remains of insects and vegetable matter in the crops of
birds he dissected.
The Brown Duck is apparently double brooded, the first nest
being in May and June, which is remarkable as this is the beginning
of winter, the second nest being in September. The first nesting
usually being more successful. Ten eggs are laid, six or seven
young ones being hatched, and usually five are reared. The nests
are often made some distance from the water, sometimes up to
a mile away, in the dense, tangled grasses or beneath the dead
leaves of a low tree fern which hang umbrella-like from the crown
of the fern and thus form a tent-like structure.
The matted grasses by the side of the creek at Kara were full
of burrows and runways, and under normal conditions the birds
would hide in these, but in their sanctuary there was no need of
this and the runs would merely lead to their feeding grounds.
The reason that the bird does not nest close to the water is that
the narrow creeks upon which it lives are liable to overflow with
the heavy rains from the mountains.
It is stated that the Weka (a large flightless rail-like bird) is
the natural enemy of the Brown Duck for it feeds to a large extent
on the eggs, but does no harm when the ducks are in their natural
numbers, and when the bird is reduced to a minimum the Weka
disappears. Wekas were certainly most plentiful in the district
where we saw the ducks and as we were watching the birds we
heard the loud cries of the Wekas from the forest patches close
at hand.
The diminution of the Brown Duck is due to two factors, the
chief reason being shooting. In the old days whole boat loads of
these birds were slaughtered in a day. Old settlers have told me
of having crept up to the birds in a low punt with a " hide 55 of
vegetation and have been able to destroy a whole flock as the birds
swam about on the water, so tame and unsuspecting were they.
Unfortunately, in the North where the birds still exist they are still
shot even though they are protected.
The second factor is the destruction of the habitat of this bird
by cattle which wallow and tramp about the small creeks, either
eating or breaking down the vegetation in which the birds spend
their time during the day. The draining of the swamps has also
hastened the departure of this bird from many of its resorts and

<bodyText confidence="0.970874051282051" page_id="56314422"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
the outlook regarding this species is very black. New Zealand
naturalists say that another twenty or thirty years at the present
rate of expiration will see the end of this interesting species except
for the private sanctuaries, but even here, there are difficulties
as this species is partially migratory. This migration is purely
limited to the one water-shed where the bird lives. It breeds at
the head of the streams and gradually migrates down to the coast
as the chicks grow up and the water in the creeks dry up. In the
summer the ducks and chicks feed on marine life in the estuaries
on rivers which they have descended. Thus it is difficult to protect
the bird on one property. Fortunately at Kara there is no migra-
tion and the birds are to be seen all the year round ; they are
thus spared the fate of those birds which do migrate. It seems
that the Brown Duck can alter its habits according to circumstances.
The male has a low musical whistle, but the female has a loud
and rather unpleasant quack. One is often able to tell the sex
of the birds by handling them, the male uttering a piping squeak
and the female a loud quack.
This duck is not nearly related to any other form except the
Auckland Island Flightless Duck and it superficially resembles the
Kerguelan Island Pintail when in eclipse plumage ; in fact it
reminds one somewhat of a small Pintail in shape, but not in
colour, which may be described as a rich brown, the head is
glossed with metallic green, the breast is a chestnut shade marked
with a darker brown, the undertail coverts are black, and there
is a very conspicuous white patch each side of the tail, the scapulars
and flanks are finely vermiculated with rufous and black. Some
males have a whitish frontal collar at the base of the neck. The
speculum in the wing is metallic green, the feathers having a
cinnamon band at the tip. The female is brown marked with
darker shades, and closely resembles the Auckland Island Duck
except that her wings are larger.
Though the birds are generally very gregarious, the males in
the breeding season are very pugnacious, and a friend tells me that
in captivity a single male will keep that most pugnacious of all
waterfowl, the Paradise Sheld-duck, away from the water. But in
a wild state the nests are often placed very close together, sometimes
almost touching.
This bird has very rarely been kept in captivity and I only

know of a single pair in captivity in New Zealand besides three
males in the Auckland Zoo. They are easy to manage and will
live on a very small area of water. They are very fond of insecti-
vorous food which has been made moist with either Madeira cake
or finely grated carrot. They also eat soaked stale brown bread
and minced raw meat given in water. It is to be hoped that one
day before it is too late this species will be established on ornamental
waters in England.
The Auckland Island Flightless Duck (,Nesonetta aucklandica)
Although inhabiting a small, remote, and uninhabited island
more seems to be known about this duck than its congener the
New Zealand Brown Duck. I suppose that owing to its peculiarities
it has received more notice than its very recluse relative. It has
even been exhibited at the London Zoo, an honour which has
not yet befallen the other bird ! All my knowledge of this species
is second-hand and is gleaned from books, etc. " Flightless " is
rather a misnomer, for the bird has certain limited powers of
flight which is rather surprising as the wings are exceedingly small
and one would have thought they would have been unable
to sustain the bird in the air. However, it is stated by competent
observers that it has been seen to fly 15 to 20 feet up the cliffs to
reach its nesting holes. It is mainly a marine duck though it has
been found on the water courses away from the coast, but its chief
habitat is the kelp-fringed shores where, owing to its sombre
colouring which blends so well with the kelp, it is difficult to see.
As with most birds which do not come in contact with man, this
duck is very fearless. The following, which I take the liberty
of quoting from Guthrie-Smith's recent book, Sorrows and Joys of
a New Zealand Naturalist , will give a good idea as to the habits of
this queer little duck, " In its desire for covert and its disinclination
to venture beyond sanctuary, Nesonetta aucklandica resembles not
a little the Brown Duck ( Elasmonetta chlorotis). Even in the shelter
of the little bay few swam beyond the seaweed area. Mostly they
were to be seen diving in quick coils like active trout, or floating
restfully close to the piled roll of ocean debris. When out of the
water they stood on the bull kelp preening themselves or half
asleep ; more or less its pancake growth served both as a playground
and a bivouac.

" Within the vast bolster of dead and decaying seaweed, warmth
must have been generated almost as in a hot bed. Insect life was
abundant. On its unctuous surface these Flightless Duck guzzled
about our feet with all the unrestrained gusto of their
domesticated kin.
" There was but little difference between the sexes ; the drake
perhaps carried a more distinct green sheen in the prevailing brown ;
at this time of the year, except in size, the young were hardly to
be distinguished from their parents--all alike were fully fledged.
" At the hooked termination of the bay rises a low cliff in the
holes of which--though I could see none myself--or probably in
the peat above, the birds are believed to nest. The master of the
Tutanekai has seen them rise on the wing upwards towards this-
rocky wall, a flight, however brief, steeply vertical."
Fortunately this duck is still common on the Auckland Islands
and will doubtless continue so unless the New Zealand Government
lease it to run sheep on. A thing they are very prone to do with
small outlying islands with disastrous results to the avifauna.
The New Zealand Scaup (Fuligula novaseelandia)
This sombre, but very attractive little duck is fairly plentiful
in the South Island and is found more or less sparingly in the North
Island. On some of the large southern lakes it is very plentiful, and
where not shot becomes quite tame, as at Queenstown where the
birds come to the landing stage in the company of the large trout,
to be fed by the tourists. The only place where I saw these birds
in the North Island was at Lake Waikaremoana. They are quiet
and would be unobtrusive little birds were it not for their deep
black colour which shows up very conspicuously on the water.
They allow a near approach and make their get away by diving,,
at which they are adepts, like all the Scaup. In their habits they
are very aquatic, if one may use that expression in regard to a
duck, they seldom leave the water and are very ungainly and
awkward on land.
The habitat of the Scaup is on the clear inland waters, usually
on lakes, but seldom on rivers, where it can be seen floating in
small parties not far from the shore. Unlike the Brown Duck its
nesting season is confined to two months of the Southern summer,
November and December. The nest is placed by the very edge of

the water under the dense overhanging clumps of carex, a coarse
native grass. The birds like to nest by the shores of islands so as
to be away from the various introduced carnivorous mammals.
The young, unlike those of other ducks, can swim and dive almost
as soon as they are born, and day old chicks will, so a friend tells
me, go down to 6 feet or more under water in search of food which
*consists mainly of small crustaceans and water weeds.
This duck appears to have no regular migratory movement,
it merely moves from one piece of water to another. It is more
often kept in captivity in New Zealand than the Brown Duck,
and is a ready breeder with those who take a little trouble with it.
It is fond of soaked bread, minced raw meat, and insectivorous
food mixed with dried flies.
In colour the male is deep black above glossed with metallic
purplish-green, especially on the head, the under parts are dark
brown, there is a white speculum in the wing, the iris is golden
yellow .which makes a striking contrast to the deep black of the
head. The female is rather dull, being a more or less sombre
brown. This bird has a very pleasing shape, the body being almost
round, and the head, in the drake, very full. Though not by any
means brightly coloured the drake in full plumage is a very con-
spicuous object amongst a flock of other ornamental waterfowl.
The Auckland Island Merganser ( Mergus australis)
A hundred years or so, less than two life times, have seen Man's
introduction to many species of birds, and their leave taking, a
" Hail and Farewell " ; they have slipped into oblivion and another
link has been snapped in the mighty chain of evolution. Species
whose development has taken aeons of time are either for momentary
gain or Man's sheer love of killing swept off the earth. Such has
been the fate of the Auckland Island Merganser, made known
less than a hundred years ago it is, through the agency of skin
collectors, reckoned as extinct. The species has never been plentiful
and owing to its rarity a price was placed on its head by skin
collectors to whom the greater a species' rarity, the greater desiderata
it becomes. About twenty skins are known which means that many
others would have been wounded and lost in the sea, so we can
conclude that the race was never more than a hundred or so
strong.

S. PORTER---THE DUCKS OF NEW ZEALAND
How this strange aberrant Merganser came to be upon a tiny
remote island so many thousands of miles from the habitat of the
rest of the genus is one of those mysteries we cannot explain. It
must have been there for many aeons of time for it to have developed
along the lines it did.
It lived in the sheltered waters of the many inlets on the island*
and no doubt subsisted, as the rest of the genus do, on fish.
The Grey Duck (Anas superciliosa)
This is the only duck which can be called really common in
New Zealand, being found over both islands and also on most
of the off-lying islands as far as the Ghathams. It is not endemic
to New Zealand alone, but has a wide range, being found in
Australia and as far as the Celebes, New Guinea, New Caledonia,
and other islands. Unlike the other ducks of New Zealand it has
no special habitat, being found on tiny ponds, rivers, lakes, estuaries,
in fact anywhere where there is water enough for it to swim on
and enough food for its sustenance. It will also take up its abode
on small ponds and lakes in public gardens and parks where it
soon becomes tame. Its habits are those of the typical Mallards,
and unfortunately the European species has been introduced into
New Zealand, and the two species breed readily together and one
sees a great many mongrels, very nondescript birds, looking very
much like common domestic ducks. Some years ago, when I was
in New Zealand for the first time and did not know quite as much
about ducks as I do now, I brought four young ones back with
me which, much to my disappointment, proved to be hybrids.
This duck is wild and wary and will not allow a close approach
like the other New Zealand Ducks, which has unfortunately been
their undoing, and in the shooting season it, the Grey Duck, gets
wilder still except on sanctuaries where it is not shot. It is surprising
how, as soon as the shooting season starts, the sanctuaries become
crowded with birds. In some parts where there are no such places
available the duck go out to sea for the day, coming back to their
feeding grounds when dark has fallen and returning before dawn.
The Grey Duck chooses very varying sites for its nest, sometimes
nesting high up in trees, the young ones jumping down soon after
they are born. I was speaking to an old bushman recently in New
Zealand who was a keen bird lover and knew their habits well.

and he said he had often watched the young ones jump out of the
nest. Owing to the great height of the nest the young ones were
usually stunned or paralysed with the fall and lay about for
several hours before they recovered, when they were collected up
by their mother, who led them to the water.
The Grey Duck is a large bird and only fit for large expanses
of water as it soon makes a small pond in a very dirty condition,
and it has little to recommend it to the amateur waterfowl keeper
who only has a small place. There is little chance of this species
dying out, the only trouble is that in time it may interbreed with
the Mallard and the pure breed may give way to a race of very
unattractive mongrels.

In January, 1938, I sent a collection of various hand-reared
waterfowl including Mandarin, Rosybill, Common Shoveler, and
Common Sheld-duck to a friend in South Africa from whom I had
previously obtained hand-reared specimens of South African Red-
bill {A. erythrorhyncha) and South African Yellowbill (A. undulata )--
the latter required for change of blood.
In March of the same year I received from him six Cape Teal and
one pair of Cape Shoveler {Spatula capensis ), one pair of the former
adult and the remainder young birds, all being hand-reared and
pinioned. Sexing was not easy, as the plumage is almost identical
in male and female, though in the breeding season the bill of the
male is slightly more highly coloured. When handled the female
can be induced to give a low quack, the note of the male being
a very husky whistle. The four young birds proved to be one male
and three females.

the Teal arrived in excellent condition, but the drake Shoveler
was very thin and died soon after arrival.
The Gape Teal were kept in a special enclosure for ten days ;
by the end of this time they were quite waterproof and had taken
to a diet of wheat with only a little millet added. They were then
moved to a much larger enclosure which included a section of
a slow running stream with plenty of rough grass and sedge
adjoining. The Teal spent much of their time on the water,
chasing flies and small insects, and at this they were very adept.
The adult pair cast their flight feathers at the end of April,
though the young birds did not do so until two months later.
As soon as the adult pair had grown their new flight feathers they
became rather aggressive to the others, which were moved on to
one of the large breeding ponds with some forty other pairs of
breeding ducks.
On 10th June two " rubbings " were found in the rough grass
of the enclosure ; one of these was subsequently deepened and
the first egg was laid on 25th June, and a clutch of eight completed
by 5th July. The egg, which is very rounded, is about half as
large again as that of the Garganey Teal and in colour pale orange,
though some clutches are of a more creamy tint. The nest down
is pale grey with white centre and contains a good proportion
of the pale breast feathers.
The eggs from this first clutch were set under a small bantam
and five ducklings hatched on the twenty-third day. Unfortunately
the weather was bad, with north-west wind and a cold drizzle,
and despite the use of a glass covered frame the ducklings made
a bad start and three died after the second day. The other two
only survived for a fortnight.
As the enclosure was required for young stock, the adult pair
were moved to the large breeding pond with the other four, and
all six birds wintered well ; even before the end of the year all six
could be seen going through their courtship display, which consisted
in swimming round in circles and then darting very rapidly along
the surface of the water for three or four yards with necks stretched
out. Both males and females do this, and even when resting quietly
on the water they will without warning suddenly dart off along
the surface.

frost at night, but on the 25th there were only five of the Teal
on . the pond at feeding time and on a search being made the
adult female was found sitting on eight eggs in a nest on bare
ground close to the edge of the pond. These eggs were all found
to be frosted and not one hatched, but the remaining three female^

no less than twelve clutches were laid by the four females before
the end of the season, the last nest on 22nd June. The sites chosen
for the nests varied from underneath a rhododendron bush to a
Carolina nesting box, but in no case was the nest more than five
or six yards away from the water. Clutches varied from eight to
ten eggs.
The fact that there were only two drakes to four ducks did not
affect the fertility ; the ducklings were strong and over fifty were
reared to maturity, ordinary duck meal with a good supply of
duckweed and a few dried ants eggs forming the staple diet.
This year the first nest was laid in a Carolina nest box, and the
duck began to lay on 27th March, all having come through the
very severe winter in fine condition. I allowed , this duck to sit
and hatch, and after pinioning the little ones removed them with
their mother to a small enclosure where they can be driven into
a rat-proof shelter at night. At the time of writing they are ten
days old and growing fast. The other females have already (1st May)
completed their first clutches, which are being hatched under
bantams.

Much pleasure and interest can be derived from the keeping
of wild Geese. To the ornithological-minded wildfowler in
particular the very presence and musical gaggle of the British
section brings to mind many happy hours spent (often in the
wildest weather) in gaining even a sight of these wary birds. Further,
if I may use such a simile, the fact of having them around in happy
semi-captivity suggests to such sportsmen reward or success of the
potted or canned variety. To the ornithologist, too, their charming

ways and the great diversity of plumage of the thirty or forty
species available are ever interesting and pleasing to study. Most
Geese soon adapt themselves to confinement, and many of them
nest readily if given an opportunity of doing so. All that is required
to keep them satisfactorily is access to drinking and bathing water,
preferably a pool, pond, lake, or stream, and a wired in paddock or
fox-free open stray. Grass they must have, short sweet turf for
preference. Their other requirements, except in the case of one or
two very quarrelsome or tropical species, may be dealt with in the
two minutes required at each end of the day to throw them a handful
of grain. As a rule Geese live to a considerable age in confinement--
forty years in the case of a Bean and a Barnacle not being unknown.
Newly caught or wing-tipped examples of the British species
tame very readily ; much more quickly than less intelligent
birds. I have known a freshly caught Pink Foot eating grain thrown
from the hand within a week. Brent also tame quickly, Greylags
being perhaps the most nervous in this respect ; but it is noticeable
that however confiding they become, they always retain their
natural instincts. It is quite true that they do drop or discontinue
the sentinel business when feeding or resting during the day-
time, but this I feel sure is only because they realize that man is
their protector or that, owing to the fences being fox proof, there is
no need for them to remain on the alert.
At the outbreak of the war we had in the Lilford collection one
or more pairs of all the British and representatives of almost twenty
foreign kinds. They are all charming subjects to study and much can
be learned concerning their innermost habits, notes, plumage, etc.,
and the development of the young. The colouring of the soft parts,
bill, feet, etc., is also worthy of notice and particulars taken from
typical, healthy, adult examples living under conditions as near
nature as possible is vastly more reliable than such information
on these matters as frequently appears in print.

It has long been considered that Ducks of the genus Dendrocygna,
were difficult to induce to breed in captivity. In spite of becoming
very tame and friendly, instances of captive breeding were not
common until the last few years, and not much publicity was
given to the occasions on which they were bred.
Yet the writer, in his own collection, has found the various
Tree Ducks not indisposed to breed and, in correspondence with
other waterfowl fanciers, has been interested to note how much
more often Tree Ducks have been bred than has been popularly
supposed.
In the United States all except the Spotted (D. guttata) have
been bred, some species quite a few times, and in one instance,
at least, hybrids have been produced.
Some twenty-five years ago or more Mr. Henry Cook, of
Woodbury, Long Island, one of America's pioneer waterfowl
fanciers, bred the Black-bellied Tree Duck (D. autumnalis autumnalis)
for several successive years, until his collection was dispersed.
The late Mr. J. V. de Laveaga, of San Mateo, California, bred
four species of Tree Ducks in his collection, some several times.
These were the White-faced (D. viduata ), the American Fulvous
(D. bicolor helva ), the Black-bellied (. D . autumnalis autumnalis ), and
the Javan ( D . javanica). Some of the young hand-reared birds
bred for second and third generations.
When one considers that the early stocks of Tree Ducks were
all wild-caught birds, as no hand-reared stock was then available,
it does not appear that the Tree Ducks are too difficult. Probably
birds did not breed in many cases because they were not true
pairs, as the sexes are difficult to distinguish. Also, many of the
earlier waterfowl collections were in the northern part of our
country, and Tree Ducks are too tender to withstand the Arctic
cold of a northern winter, and must be kept inside a heated house
for several months. This is not conducive to successful breeding
for, in spite of the best of care, birds are quite liable to be more
or less enervated when they are put outside into a suitable breeding

environment in the spring, and it takes some time for them to
get back into breeding condition. Then, too, many fanciers of
waterfowl lack the knowledge or the conditions for successful
breeding of any except the most easily bred species.
Of late years, however, possibly due to the availability of more
hand-reared stocks, or better methods of handling, successful
breeding of various Tree Ducks has occurred more and more
often. Mr. Alfred Ezra has raised large numbers of Fulvous Trees
at his lovely place in Surrey, and Mr. Jean Delacour has raised
numbers of the Black-billed Tree Ducks (D. arborea) in France.
Other European aviculturists have been successful with Tree
Ducks, and their successes have been more or less paralleled by
American fanciers.
Mr. William Mackensen, of Yardley, Pennsylvania breeds
numbers of the Black-billed Tree Ducks yearly. Mr. Anthony
Bliss, of Westbury, Long Island, has bred the Black-bellied species.
Until recently the writer has not known of the Wandering (D. arcuata)
being bred, but lately learned of some thirty young having been
reared during the last two years by Mr. G. R. Norton, of Ganoga
Park, Los Angeles, California. Mr. Norton's experience is typical
of what happens in the wonderful climate of Southern California
with many species of birds. In 1934 two specimens of arcuata
were obtained from a dealer. They proved to be a pair and laid
eggs for the first time in 1936. In the climate of California they
breed almost the entire year, laying from five to eight eggs in a
clutch. Mr. Norton has allowed his birds to hatch and rear their
own young, so the large number of young produced is even more
surprising. Most waterfowl breeders incubate the eggs under
bantams and rear them with bantam foster mothers.
In the north Tree Ducks are inclined to nest very early in the
spring, then again in the late summer or autumn. Because cold
weather comes early in the north, it is rather difficult to rear the
late Ducklings for they go off their legs if put inside a heated house
on the advent of cold weather, and if left outside are quite subject
to freezing of feet and legs. This may be why more have not been
reared in the northern part of our country.
Of the kinds bred in the writer's collection over a period of
years, all but three of the nine species are represented. White-
faced ( viduata) bred quite a few years ago for the first time, then

the Black-bellied {autumnalis ), American Fulvous (bicolor helva ),
Black-billed ( arborea ), Javan ( javanico ), and last, but not least,
Eyton's ( eyetoni) which nested in 1938, two young being reared.
The breeding female was, unfortunately, killed later, and the two
young proved to be males, so that the happy circumstance of
breeding this species again may not be repeated for some time.
The female which nested was obtained from an importer and was
almost surely a wild-caught bird, yet nested the first season we
had her. That would hardly indicate that Tree Ducks are as
difficult about breeding as has been popularly supposed. There
is, so far as the writer knows, no true pair of the Spotted ( guttata )
in any American collection, but it is not too much to hope that
when one or more true pairs are available, the Spotted may be
added to the list of breeding species.
In 1937 young were reared from the union of an American
Fulvous male and a Javan female. Two male hybrids were reared
and mated with Fulvous females, but to date no young have
been produced, although the birds have been seen to pair repeatedly.
Most of the Fulvous specimens in American collections are
of the native American race (bicolor helva) found in south-western
United States, Mexico, etc. They seem identical with the form
found in Africa, India, and South America, and distinguished by
the ornithologists as D. bicolor bicolor. Probably the Fulvous breeding
in European collections are of the Asiatic rather than the American
race, but to the writer they seem not enough unlike to be accorded
separate rank. For the layman who fancies Tree Ducks a Fulvous
is a Fulvous, whether Asiatic or American.
The Grey-breasted or Red-billed ( D . autumnalis discolor) from
South America is so like the Black-bellied (autumnalis autumnalis)
that ornithologically it is considered a sub-species of the Black-
bellied. ' Yet in this country autumnalis has bred quite freely, whereas
discolor has been bred on only two or three occasions. A hybrid
female of autumnalis and discolor parentage was mated with an
autumnalis male and produced fertile eggs, so it is evident that
they are quite closely related in spite of the disposition of discolor
to breed less freely in confinement than does autumnalis. Thus
far the writer has not succeeded in breeding discolor , in spite of
owning well-mated pairs kept under identical conditions with
autumnalis which breeds well.

With our thoughts entirely on war, Waterfowl and the
rearing of them seems a distant object, possibly more so for myself
than most, as I have had several hundred killed this winter by
vermin, owing to no time or men to look after them. But the
future may see times when peace will allow us again to think of
things more beautiful than war, and what is more beautiful than
water with the many kinds of Duck and Geese that can be kept
in this country swimming on its surface. To those who keep
Waterfowl, spring is the time of highest interest for them ; all the
birds are at their height of beauty and their courting displays a
source of endless pleasure. The birds themselves are also most
tame at that time. Many species can be safely left to rear their
own young ; Geese of all kinds can do so on grass alone, and so
can many, indeed all, of the Duck if the waters are large enough
and sufficient natural food is available. Young ducks of all kinds
depend mainly in the first few days of their lives on flies and also
eat small water weeds such as duck weed ; the ideal waters are those
that are edged by reeds and have a certain proportion of shallow
swampy land edging the waters. But if these conditions do not
exist they can be supplemented or aided by fencing in parts of
the water at the edges with wire netting of such a mesh that enables
the young to swim through, but keeps out the older birds ; in
these enclosures biscuit meal and duck weed can be scattered ; if a
little of this is also scattered outside and at the edge of these
enclosures the parent birds will find them, and bring their young,
who will soon learn to swim through the mesh and get the food
inside when the old birds have cleared up the food outside. It is
a good plan to have these little enclosures made some weeks before

hatching, and the old birds fed at them, which gets them then
accustomed to going to these places.
Young duck so reared and left full winged rarely will leave their
home, and it adds to the attractiveness of the collection to have a
proportion of the birds full winged and flying about. If for some
reasons or other it is decided to take the eggs and hand rear the
young, i.e. rear them under hens, the eggs should be set as far
as is possible in their own kinds as the period of incubation varies ;
for example, a Common Teal takes 21 days to hatch, whereas a
Carolina takes 30, or a Wigeon takes 25. Also the young of some
species obviously will not mix well ; diving ducks when little do
not thrive with surface feeding ducks, for not only do they require
different feeding, but they require to live more in the water than
do surface-feeding duck. It is difficult to give an exact menu
of food for young duck generally, it varies so.
With Common Sheld-duck we found from day of hatching
until well feathered they thrived best on a diet of rabbit chopped
up fine and given raw, better than any other food ; while talking
of meat-eaters, Eider did best on chopped raw ox liver. Most of the
surface feeding duck such as Teal, Wigeon, Pintail, etc., do well
when fed on fine biscuit meal, duck weed, and a little raw meat.
Shovelers are somewhat difficult to rear, and nothing suits them
better than my wet food consisting of a very little biscuit meal
and mainly finely chopped worms, a rather laborious task. I also
think that diving duck like Common Pochard and Tufted have
their health improved when one feeds them under water ; it avoids
eye trouble and they get much fun and exercise when having to
dive for their food. They are rather rank feeders, and also like
a lot of green food. Grit is an important item in the life of all
young waterfowl and can be given in the shape of fine river or
seaside gravel. I think all kinds thrive best in rather small bands
say of about seven ; possibly because they then get more warmth
and are able to keep themselves and the coop cleaner.
Young duck are very subject to changes of weather, and though
hating cold weather do not like to be unable to get out of the direct
rays of a hot sun, so shade should be provided. As I think is now
generally known, they do not like to get wet during the first few
days of their lives, by wet I mean heavy rain. In a wild state
they do not seem to mind how dirty or foul the water is, but in

captivity they certainly do best in clean or fresh water. Duck
differ in temperament, some seem to hatch wild and easily
frightened, others bold and confident. Sheld-duck of the various
kinds, and geese, are especially confident, whereas Teal of various
species and Mandarins are noticeably timid, so. care should be
taken not to frighten them, and that no holes in the coops or
netting will allow them to escape. After a week or so, if they have
had no frights, all will get tremendously tame, some, indeed, too
tame. One more, and rather an important point, the foster-
mothers should be fed on the same food as the young birds, or
otherwise the young might pick up and eat what might be to them
indigestible food.

on a day in May when, by the kindness of His Grace the Duke
of Bedford, I visited it, accompanied by our Editor. It is twenty
years since I was there last and I could see little change except
perhaps that the Waterfowl, which have the free range of the park
with its numerous lakes and ponds where the monks of old obtained
their fish, were slightly less numerous than formerly. Almost all
are full-winged, and under these conditions the losses are naturally
heavy, for they fly for miles, and the man lying in wait for Duck
does not differentiate between a Snow Goose and a Mallard. But
the severe winter seems to have been responsible for the loss of
quite a number of birds which simply flew away when the ground
was covered with ice and snow, under the belief, presumably, that
they might find more congenial conditions elsewhere. Magellan
Geese were to be numbered at over 200 in the autumn, but in the
cold weather the majority took their departure and now there are
less than thirty, while a dozen Ashy-headed Geese are all that
remain of more than forty. It seems strange that these have not
been reported in other parts of the country, but I am afraid the

average wildfowl shooter simply regards a strange bird as something
more for the pot.
The Black Swan, which never meets with much cold weather
when at home, seems indifferent to it here, for it will persist in
nesting at the wrong time of year. A pair at Woburn nested in
October and duly hatched a brood of four which, in spite of the
weather, have thrived and their parents now have another nest of
eggs, while another pair has a brood of cygnets. That splendid
Swan, the American Trumpeter, which in its wild state is nearly
gone, is represented at Woburn by several pairs, and we saw one
sitting on her nest.
There are between sixty and seventy Red-breasted Geese at
Woburn and they breed there every year. They commenced to do
so in 1926 after a residence there of some fourteen years, and in
most succeeding years have produced good broods. It has been
discovered that they sometimes go to nest in their second year,
though seldom producing fertile eggs until the third year. Mandarins
and Garolinas have bred in hundreds in years gone by and many
of the young birds have left and, one would suppose, become
established in other parts of the country. It is a pity that so many
of these foreign ducks get shot, for if only they were left in peace
the Mandarin at least would soon become established as a British
breeding species.
Of American Wild Turkeys we saw numerous fine cocks, the
hens being mostly occupied with their nests. They do extremely
well in dry seasons but the chicks are apt to suffer in wet ones.
Of the mammals at Woburn, the fine herd of Pere David's Deer,
the only specimens of the species in the world, were looking very
well with quite a number of fawns, and of that other nearly
extinct species, the European Bison, there is a nice lot with several
recently born calves. We did not see the Prejevalsky's Wild Horses,
which were in a distant part of the park, but this is another nearly
extinct species that is being maintained at Woburn.

We have received the Annual Report for 1939, which is edited as usual by
the indefatigable Secretary, Mr. Rowland Hutchinson. It is full of interesting
matter, particularly the accounts of breeding successes for which claims are
made for certificates for first successes in the Dominion.
They include YELLOW-BILLED CARDINALS : one young one reared
by Mrs. Bullock, who in her account says that Dr. Russ bred this species. Did he ?
And where did he record the fact ? I should be glad to know. Neunzig in his book
( = a fifth edition of Russ), says nothing about it, I think. The successful breeding
is also described of HECK'S GRASSFINCHES, SCALY-BREASTED LORI-

note. Some Munia hybrids (? Diamond Sparrow as one of the parents), are
described by the breeder, Mr. John Black : these I well remember seeing when
last in New Zealand, but have no more idea now what exactly they are, than
I had then. The same member also describes nearly complete success with other
hybrids, Bulbuls this time, Pycnotus bimaculatus X P. cafer ; once two young lived
to leave the nest, on another hatching took place but the young died in the nest,
and the parents were sitting on eggs in a fourth nest at the time of report. We hope
full success was obtained.
The remainder of the Report contains other interesting bird-histories, extracts

The Corncrake as an Aviary Bird
Miss E. F Chawner sends the following note :--
Mr Sydney Porter's article on this bird was particularly interesting to me
as I also had a Corncrake which became very tame almost at once.
He (I think it was certainly a male bird) was found in my garden here, one
wing was injured, probably by the reaper which was working in a field near by.
Only the tip was missing, but the bird never attempted to fly all the time, about
two years, that I had him. He was turned into a large fruit cage and quickly
made himself at home there ; in a few days he learnt to come running for meal-
worms which he took from my fingers as to the manner born. No bird could
have been tamer or more fearless.
He was silent all that autumn and winter, but in the late spring he started
" craking ", and for the sake of my neighbours had to be transferred to a small
enclosure at the further end of the garden where I am bound to say he seemed
equally contented. The craking ceased after a couple of months, and he was
returned to the fruit cage. There he remained until, to our great regret, he was
killed and partly eaten by a rat which managed to find its way into the enclosure.
My bird was always in perfect condition, I suppose he moulted but there
was never any sign of missing feathers or dishevelled plumage, he was always
spick and span. He bathed occasionally and liked to get thoroughly wetted by
rain. We gave him bread and milk, worms, and such insects as we came across,
and about a couple of dozen meal-worms every day. Of course he found some
food for himself as well.
In Memoriam of two Great Australian Aviculturists
The death in Adelaide of Mr. Ronald Minchin at the early age of 35 will
come as a great blow to all those who had the good fortune to come in contact
with him. He had a delightful and engaging personality and one felt all the
better for having known him no matter how short the acquaintanceship.
Unfortunately my acquaintance with him was only of short duration, but his
courtesy and charm of manner made a lasting impression.
No one, except perhaps Mr. Harvey, has done so much for aviculture in
South Australia as Mr. Minchin, and the collection of Australian birds which
was amassed under his direction at the Adelaide Zoological Gardens was unique,
and was without doubt the largest and finest which has ever been gathered
together.
All the Parrot-like birds known to inhabit Australia, with one or two exceptions,
were represented in the collection, including all the five species of Black Cockatoos.
Even the very rare and almost extinct Ground Parrakeet (Pezoporus wallicus )
was there, which I had the good fortune to see.
Under Mr. Minchin's able direction the Adelaide Zoological Gardens reached
a very high standard, and after seeing most of the Zoological Gardens in the
Southern Hemisphere, I can safely say they are the finest of them all except perhaps
those of Sydney.
Whilst in Australia I also had the good fortune to meet Mr. Wachsmann,
whose death is also announced in the March issue of the Magazine. His death
was not so unexpected as that of Mr. Minchin, as Mr. Wachsmann had reached
the good age of " three score years and ten ". This gentleman's collection of
Australian birds was unique, and though his aviaries hardly conformed with
our ideas of what formal aviaries should be like, they contained some very rare
and wonderful Australian birds, including quite a few of those rare and lovely
creatures the Australian Rifle Birds.
Mr. Wachsmann was a connoisseur of Australian Parrakeets, and he had the
finest examples of many of the well-known species. He certainly had an eye
for a fine bird, and his Platycercus and Barnardius Parrakeets were the finest
specimens I have ever seen.

Collections in Belgium
Up to the time of going to press no news has been heard of two well-known
Belgian aviculturists, members of the Avicultural Society, Monsieur Y. Malisoux
and Dr. J. M. Derscheid, or of the fate of their collections. Monsieur Malisoux
is famed throughout the world as a Phasianist and for his collection of Pheasants,
and on hearing of the invasion of Belgium, Mr. P. J. Lambert, acting secretary of
the Ornamental Pheasant Society, immediately tried to get in touch with Monsieur
Malisoux both by telephone and telegram, but in vain. No less well known and
valuable are Dr. Derscheid's collections of Waterfowl, Pheasants, and Parrots.
Great anxiety will be felt for their two Belgian colleagues by aviculturists in all
parts of the world, and any news of them will immediately be published in the
Magazine.
The President's Garden Party
By kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Ezra, members of the Avicultural
Society were entertained to a garden party at Foxwarren Park on 25th May.
There was an attendance of sixty, who greatly enjoyed viewing the magnificent
collection which is still being maintained at Foxwarren, and the warm hospitality
for which our President is renowned. Mr, Ezra has given a strong lead to
aviculturists by making every effort to safeguard the future of aviculture, not only
by maintaining his own collection to the utmost, but also by giving asylum to
many birds whose owners are no longer able to keep them.

By V. A. V. Carr
(Continued from p. 10 f)
Having mentioned several species of British hardbills in my
previous contributions, I will now deal with a few of the large
Softbills that have been bred, and primarily I will mention the
Ring Ouzel. To my mind, it is one of the most fascinating of our
British birds and in captivity makes an ideal aviary bird. In its
wild state it is found in mountainous and moorland districts and
is very difficult to observe in these localities unless one has field-
glasses, or a hide in the neighbourhood of the nesting site.
Its song, like most moorland birds, is very shrill and uninteresting,
consisting of short and then long whistles without any variation,
and can be heard at a very long distance. Its nest is constructed
just like a Blackbird's and likewise the eggs are identical, but,
unlike the Blackbird's, is situated in a clump of heather, bracken
or gorse a few inches above the ground. I have watched these
birds with field-glasses, from a hide over half a mile distant,
brooding their young, and also found their line of flight to food
and water and waited for them to fly past me ; and how they
can fly ! When they view one their harsh " tchuck " " tchuck "
conveys a great deal of the consternation they feel at anything
foreign to them.
Mountain Blackbird is another name this bird is known by,
and with the exception of the white crescent on the breasts (the
hen's breast is a lot less colourful) and the greyish tipped feathers,
one could easily pass it for a Blackbird.

1 66 V. A. V. CARR BREEDING BRITISH BIRDS
These birds never lose their characteristic temperament in
captivity, being agile and shy although perfectly tame. In fact
they will feed from the finger, and yet anything strange, such as
a dog, hawk or owl, or stranger, they will create for all the world
as if they were doomed.
In 1938 we put a pair in an aviary approximately 10 feet long,
9 feet wide and 6 feet high, i-inch wire mesh netting. In the
centre of this aviary a concrete pond was constructed to make it
as natural as possible to represent the dew ponds or swiftly running
streams that these birds seem to favour. Along one side of the
aviary a shelf of wire netting was fixed up, about 2 feet above the
ground to represent a sloping bank, whilst heather, gorse, bracken,
and dry grasses were stuck up in the netting. This was done early
in April, and it was not until the end of May in that year did
they attempt to breed. It rained all day on the occasion the hen
bird started building operations and within a few hours she had
built her nest, as perfect as any wild one.
She laid four eggs and incubated splendidly, eventually rearing
four youngsters and almost when they were able to forage for
themselves, she had another nest, but forsook this after sitting a
few days. I suppose the young ones had disturbed her one night--
but we were very satisfied with the luck achieved so far.
Unfortunately about October time, a tree fell on the aviary where
the young ones were housed and let them all out.
Last year (1939) the same pair nested, but all the eggs were
infertile and the hen bird moulted very early.
This year, however, to date they have had two nests. She
started building her first nest about the 28th of April and on the
30th laid her first egg and eventually finished with five, but strangely
enough she would not incubate them at all. Upon observation
I noticed the cock bird was chasing about with building material
in his beak, and worrying the hen a great deal. In short, he
would not allow her to sit. The eggs were removed and placed
under a wild Thrush's nest, but Fate interfered once again,
because this nest was robbed by a Jackdaw or Magpie.
On the 8th of May the Ring Ouzel had built another nest,
started to lay on the 10th and finished on the 14th, and as I write
she is sitting beautifully and Mr. Ring Ouzel is leaving her severely
alone.

Although they are summer migrants, they will stand the severest
weather, and will live on any kind of meal. All this cold winter they
were fed on bean meal, oatmeal, alfalfa meal, and ground pea nuts.
Incidentally they will live solely on ground pea nuts and I believe it
is rich in vitamins that produce fertility. ## Saval, 55 a proprietary
brand of puppy biscuit, cannot be resisted .and with their 1938
youngsters (at a certain age) the parent birds would pick up huge
beakfuls of this food and stuff the youngsters. Wood ant eggs and
maggots were used principally the first day or two of the young
ones lives--but an earthworm would not be relished very much.
One point of interest that arises out of these birds nesting
habits. The hen bird generally lays her eggs about midday
almost to the minute, whilst other species of British birds do so
regularly six hours earlier than that. Is this a peculiarity of the

BIRD GOSSIP FROM TAHITI

Although I can make no claim to be an aviculturist, it has
been one of my chief pleasures, whenever circumstances permitted,
to have a few birds at liberty about my house. Here in Tahiti,
where I have resided for some years, conditions are exceptionally
favourable for many kinds of birds, and I am jotting down a few
remarks on those I have liberated in hopes that a little gossip
from this far-away place may prove of interest to members of the
Society. I have been handicapped by a limited water supply and
the fact that I have only a few acres of grounds about my house.
My experiments began about seven years ago, when I built
a roomy covered enclosure equipped with a small concrete pool.
Through the kindness of Mr. F. E. Thornton, of Wellington, New
Zealand, I obtained a pair of Imperial Hens (Porphyria melanotus)
and four well-grown young, and the authorities of Taronga Park,
in Sydney, New South Wales, were good enough to ship me one

pair of the Australian race of the same bird. " Pukeko," as they
call them in New Zealand, are birds of great beauty and character.
One never tires of watching their quaint antics, of admiring their
handsome plumage and elegant forms, nor of listening to their
varied cries. They were placed in the enclosure, together with
a few Mandarin and Carolina Ducks, and two pairs of the local
Grey Duck (Anas superciliosa).
All of these birds got along together without a sign of friction,
and thrived on a diet of wheat, paddy rice, lettuce, and live shrimps.
After a few months, when they had recovered completely from
their long journeys and were in the pink of health, I removed one
end of their enclosure, and a few days later, after they had become
accustomed to wandering about outside, I drove them gently away
from their pond and hastily removed the remaining wire and posts.
On the following morning, to my delight, the whole company
reported for breakfast and from that day on they made the little
cement pond their headquarters.
Carolinas and Mandarins, as everyone knows, are wonderful
stayers, but I was agreeably surprised to discover that the little
Tahitian Grey Duck and the big Blue Porphyrios also appreciated
plenty of good food and no work. All were, of course, full-winged ;
it was a real pleasure, after the Mandarin and Carolina drakes
had changed to their winter plumage, to watch them circling about
the place, threading their way among the trees at forty miles an
hour. The Porphyrios ran about the lawn like fowls and roosted
high in a breadfruit tree at night. They remained even during the
moult when unable to fly. The ducks at this time all disappeared,
returning, to my joy, after an absence of several weeks. They
must have sought out some secluded spot in one of the valleys
where they could pass the flightless period undisturbed.
The native duck on many occasions fetched in friends on
nights when the moon was near the full. On one such night I
counted fourteen of them on the pond, tipping for corn : my own
four, no doubt, and ten wild guests.
The Mandarins and Carolinas went to nest readily in the high
boxes I had placed for them, but in spite of a stimulating diet and
the fact that I saw them mate repeatedly, all of the eggs laid in
two successive years proved to be clear. Should I be able to keep
ducks again after the war is won, I hope to obtain a better stock,

for I think that both my Mandarins and my Garolinas must have
been enfeebled by inbreeding.
My friend and neighbour, Mr. Eastham Guild, and I decided
some years ago to attempt to acclimate California Quail (.Lophortyx
californica ), and sent for eighty pairs, most of which were liberated
in the Punaruu Valley, a large semi-arid canyon on the dry side
of the island. Eight pairs, which I kept shut up for a few days, were
persuaded to make my little place their headquarters, where their
trim forms and ringing three-note calls were sources of much
pleasure. They went to nest readily when the time came and
brought up large broods, but rats and half-wild cats made havoc
among the flightless chicks. The largest number one pair was
observed to rear on my place was six. Whether these handsome
little game birds will prove able to establish themselves in a wild
state remains to be seen.
Pheasants seem better able than the little Colins to cope with
this environment. When in California four years ago I obtained
thirty common Pheasants : ten cocks and twenty hens. They
were landed here after a long and trying voyage and in the midst
of a four-day tropical storm. Nevertheless I decided to liberate
them at once. Their crates were opened and off they went, rocketing
high above the coconut palms. Then for a long time no more was
seen of them.
About six months ago a native told me that he had seen several
large, strange birds on a plateau, far off from the settlements at
an elevation of about 1,000 feet. They proved to be Pheasants in
splendid condition and strong on the wing, and since then I have
become convinced that they already number several hundred,
scattered over a region a good many thousand acres in extent.
Their principal food, outside of the insects devoured by their
young, seems to be the berries and seeds of the lantana, and I hope
that they may succeed in reducing to some extent this very serious
pest.
Both Mr. Guild and I have experimented with Macaws at
liberty : two kinds obtained from Panama--the Blue-and-Yellow
and the Red-and-Blue. Unlike the Amazon Parrots I have attempted
to keep at liberty, the Macaws proved themselves real stayers,
and their flight, high above the coconut palms, is worth travelling
many miles to see, but they were fearfully destructive to fruit and

fruit trees, and were so tame that they often landed on the road
to play with the children on their way to school. Fearing the
retaliation of their powerful beaks in case some child were foolish
enough to tease them or throw stones at them, I shut my Macaws
up and eventually gave them to a friend.
Until a few years ago Mr. Guild had at liberty about his house
a pair of magnificent Fruit Pigeons (Globicera aurora) which may
have been, I fear, the last of their kind. They were as large as
small fowls and clad in rich and exquisitely subdued tones of bluish
grey. Mr. Guild's Globicera were so tame that they used to land on
the backgammon board when a game was in progress. I have
seen at a distance of 6 feet the strange courting-dance of the male
and regret that in those days we had no motion pictures in colour
to record what may never be seen again. There is an allied and
somewhat similar species in the Marquesas Islands, I believe, not
yet quite extinct, but so far as I know Mr. Guild's birds existed
only in the Society Islands and on Makatea in the Tuamotuan
Group, also known as Aurora Island.
It is barely possible that a few pairs may still exist in the depths
of some remote valley, but in my opinion this magnificent bird has
already gone the way of the Passenger Pigeon.
Mr. Guild's garden at feeding time is a spot to delight the bird-
lover's eyes. Finches and insectivorous birds of many species
come to be fed, not in dozens or scores but in hundreds. All are
at complete liberty, and many of them travel far off into the
mountains to nest and rear their young. The more striking birds
to be seen about his house are Gouldian Finches, Orange Bishops,
Blue and Scarlet Tanagers, and Western Bluebirds from America,
which have already nested and reared four beautiful young.
Birds, like men, will seldom desert a place where food is abundant
and free, but will soon leave when the supply is cut off. My house
was closed some time ago, and I was forced to absent myself for
many months. The ducks flew away to distant swamps, the Colins
wandered off to join their kin in the foothills, and my Pukekos
established themselves in a marshy place about a mile away where
I know that at least one brood of young was reared.
I have lately acquired a new place, about forty miles distant,
which I believe will prove ideal for waterfowl and game birds.
There are about 150 acres of land with abundant cover, and a

A FEW NOTES ON THE SHRIKES
By A. Martin
The Shrikes constitute the family of the Laniidae. They are
birds with strong beaks, the upper mandible is hooked and strongly
serrated. Wings are short and rounded, but the tail very long
and tapered. They are lively birds but quarrelsome, and even
cruel ; as a matter of fact they are small birds of prey, having the
courage of the more larger birds of prey. Apart from their
monotonous call, they have no particular song ; they can, however,
imitate perfectly the notes of other birds.
The Shrikes are insectivorous as well as carnivorous, hunting
large insects as well as small mammals and even small birds and
they sometimes will even attack large species of birds. They have
a very curious habit of carrying off their victims and impaling
them on thorns in order to be able to pull them to pieces more
easily. I once came across a larder of the Red Back Shrike that
contained several large beetles and flies of all different hues,
a baby frog just out of the tadpole stage, a field mouse and also
a young linnet--a rather gruesome sight. The family is represented
in all parts of the world except South America and about a dozen
species appear in Europe.
The Great Grey Shrike (Lanius exubitor) measures about
25 centimetres in length. The top of the head, the nape of the
neck and back are of a pretty ashy grey, with a black stripe over
the eyes, wings are black with white spots, the lower parts pure
white. This bird becomes rather common in winter near inhabited
places : it likes to perch on a high branch to survey its surroundings
and like the Hawk, drops on any prey that comes its way.
The Southern Shrike is about the same size as the preceding
one : its abode is the South of Europe and North West Africa.

A. MARTIN--A FEW NOTES ON SHRIKES
The upper parts of the body is of a very dark ashy grey, with
black streaks on sides of the head, breast grey tinted with pink--
its habits are about the same as those of preceding species but
even more cruel to little birds. The Pink Breasted Shrike (Lanius
minor) is a beautiful bird, and is to be found in South and
Central Europe. Its back is of light ashy grey, the throat white,
the breast and sides pink, the eyes and ears black, wings black
with a white spot, a very pleasing and beautiful bird. The Russet
Shrike differs more from the other species. In this bird the head
is a fine russet colour, the forehead black, the back and wings
black, variegated with white. It is found in Europe and Africa.
The Red Back Shrike (.Lanius collurio) is about the smallest of the
family (17 centimetres) and is found all over Europe and in winter
North of Africa--a very pretty and beautiful cage bird. I have
kept many of these birds and have found them hardy, but always
a great trouble to moult. Its larder is always well stocked.
In captivity Shrikes are pleasing owing to their fine colours
and their vivacity, they become very tame and do well if given
the correct food, insectile mixture with meat, also live insects.
They should also be provided with a piece of wood with a nail
driven through so as to impale their prey. Shrikes are good mimics,
imitating the voices of other birds.
A certain number of exotic Shrikes have been imported. There
are the Lanius of North America and the Lanius lathora of Northern
India--they differ very little from the Lanius exubitor. Then there
is the African Shrike which differs very little from our own Red
Back Shrike.
The Long Tail Shrike of South Africa is an interesting bird.
It is black with the wings and the upper covering feathers of the
tail marked with white. At first sight it looks like a Whydah bird.
It is a savage bird and does not do well in captivity.
Another group of Shrikes inhabit Australia. The species are
similar as regards size, general form, and habits. They have the
long beaks, well developed wings and short tail of the crow and
are known as Crow Shrikes.
I hope these short notes will be of some interest. There are,
of course, many more of this interesting family, but I am afraid
I have wearied you enough so perhaps I had better wait until
a later issue.

By the Marquis Hachisuka
My newly constructed bird-house in Atami is one of the most
ideal places to cage birds. It also is a green-house for tropical
plants as well as a bathing pool. I am sure it must sound very
strange to readers, but the natural hot spring water, 200 degrees
Fahrenheit, which comes out from my property is utilized to heat
the house. Consequently, a large glass-covered room which is
about 35 feet in length and 20 feet in width, and the height about
the same as the width, steadily keeps up the temperature between
60-80 degrees during mid-winter, and the average temperature
is usually a little higher than 70 degrees during the day time.
Among its tropical vegetation I have liberated the Humming
birds from California and many rare birds from Formosa, Malay
States, and tropical America.
As Japan is facing her third year of war, the shortage of coal
is fast becoming a matter of great difficulty. Consequently, the
heating problem became very severe in Tokyo during the last
winter so the Marquis Yamashina turned over his tropical birds
to be kept under my care.
In 1929 the Marquis and Marchioness Yamashina went to
Micronesia and brought back many interesting birds which they
kept in their house in Tokyo. Each bird lived in a small Japanese
cage less than a cubic foot square in size, with only two perches,
less than 5 inches apart. For the last six or seven years they were
placed in a room where the temperature dropped down to nearly
50 degrees ; however, they became accustomed to the severe
conditions of winter for many years.
Last November I received a pair of the Golden Honey-eater,
Cleptornis marchei. It is a good singer and its entire body is golden-
yellow, while the back is washed with dark olive colour ; the bill
and legs are of the same golden colour, and it is a little larger than
a Sparrow. They are very sociable and lively, so a pair was always
kept together. The Golden Honey-eater is a rare bird from
Micronesia, found only on a small island called Saipan and this
pair is the first record of the kind ever kept in captivity. The

next was a pair of the Blue-whiskered Leaf-bird, Chloropsis cyanopogon ,
from the Malay States which is perhaps the most showy, and a good
songster whenever there is sunshine in Atami, although they had
seldom sung in Tokyo, except during the summer. A pair of Yap
White-eye, Zostewps oleaginea , were next introduced. Its behaviour
is quite like the ordinary White-eye, but it is much larger in size
and its colour is chocolate, so that the white ring around the eye
is very conspicuous ; its voice is much more powerful and clear
metallic. If I turn the light on at night, say an hour after
sunset, the White-eye is the first to wake up and start singing.
It flys about and perches on a hammock, or hops about the table
ready for food ; whereas, the Leaf-bird is a very tight sleeper,
looking like a puff-ball with tail, the head being entirely hidden
in the back. Such trivial matters as several human beings bathing
under the tree and talking loudly never seem to disturb his good
nights sleep. By the way, the Humming bird is just as sound
a sleeper, if not more, than the Leaf-bird. If I gently touch a
branch of the tree where the Hummer is sleeping, with its bill
always upright, he will not wake up. This is quite an interesting
observation because experienced Humming bird owners in Tokyo
and California believe that it is better to keep the bird awake for
several hours after sunset under artificial light in order to prolong
their feeding hour during winter.
The Marquis Yamashina also trusted me with a Scarlet Honey-
eater, Mizomela rubratra. This is a regular Sun-bird type having
a bright scarlet body with black wings and tail, and the long bill
is strongly curved downward. It had grown old during the past
years and the legs became very scaly. This being a very delicate
and aged bird I did not turn it out into the room, but kept it in
the same old cage. All the birds enjoyed their spacious new
surroundings when I turned them out one by one from their
" less than a square foot world ". Their power of flight had been
weakened so much that, after a flight around the room, some
could not even perch properly on a branch. The White-eye and
the Golden Honey-eater could not rise more than io feet high
at a time, but the Leaf-bird was very hardy and did not show
any weakness of the wing. A week after their arrival the Leaf-bird
started its first song in early December, and it is a beautiful sight
to see a lovely green bird with a golden crown hanging down

upon the fiery-red hybiscus flower and sucking its nectar, or a
pair of White-eye perching on a dial-like flower of poinsettia and
picking its yellow centre. The Mizomela became much hardier
and a better feeder, and I can see its movements becoming more
vigorous and quicker.
In my opinion the birds are happier when given space, but
they are often subjected to unexpected accidents, such as fight
with other birds, broken legs, or irregular feeding, while in a
smaller cage one has no fear of such things and their health is
adjusted only by the strength of food. Therefore, the Scarlet
Honey-eater, unlike all the other old friends, lived in his same
cage but enjoyed better weather. After three months of tropical
environment I began t6 notice some of them beginning to court
and pecking fibre from the cushions so I gave them nesting material,
sterilized rough fibre a little shorter than a foot in length, the
usual thing that we give to Java sparrows and other breeding birds
in Japan. One day towards the end of March, I noticed a deep
cup-shaped nest cleverly tucked into a crotton bush and the
Golden Honey-eater was sitting tight in its centre. The eggs were
laid, unfortunately not in the nest, but here and there scattered
about, and all were eventually destroyed by other birds. What
interested me a great deal was the fact that these birds, after
having lived for ten years in a small cage, surviving very cold
winter, when once turned out into a proper environment with
plenty of warmth, sunshine, vegetation, diet and exercise became
ready to breed in three months in confinement during the winter
in Japan. Apart from the regular diet which I supply, there are
any number of crickets singing all through the night, and the
young insects often hop about during the day time and some
birds, especially the Leaf-birds, are always after them. A keen
gardener knows well that the green-house plants always suffer
more from insect pests, but such parasites are at once cleared by
the birds.
On 4th April, the Scarlet Honey-eater dropped down on the
floor of the cage and looked very ill. As there was no means of
feeding it died the next morning. According to the Marquis
Yamashina this bird lived io years and 2 months in the same
cage and it was fully grown at the time of its capture. When it
was dissected it contained a large pair of testis, proving that the
bird enjoyed the best of health and died only of old age.

Latham apparently knew but few of these as cage-birds, and
says little about them as such, and that little mainly hearsay.
" The PARADISE TANAGER, Tanagra tatao. Linn., may be kept
in a cage and will feed on bread and milk " (vi, 27) ; Desmarest
saw an OLIVE TANAGER in the Jardin des Plantes (p . 5) and
the GOLDEN TANAGER ( = T. violacea. Linn.) is " often kept
in cages, but has no song ; ... delights to live five or six in a
cage One Saltator has cage-bird mention, the GRAND
TANAGER, Saltator magnus ( Gm ), " sometimes kept in a cage
and will feed on bread, husked maize, fruits and other things,
swallowing the food whole, but if too large, will break it with
its bill" (p. ii). The RED-THROATED TANAGER of p. 15
is probably a Cardinal (see above). Another Tanager or Tanager-like
bird, which even to-day is only rarely imported, appears with
a good plate in Vol. v (p. ig2) as the LINDO CHATTERER.
Latham saw one alive at Mr. Bailey's, the Haymarket dealer in
birds. It is the Swallow Fruit-eater, Tersa.

(3) The CARTHAGENA ORIOLE {Hi, 104). "This was
brought from Carthagena, . . . and placed in the Menagerie of
the Emperor of Germany at Vienna ; it was an unquiet and
clamorous bird."
(4) The RED-WINGED ORIOLE { -- Agelaius phoeniceus ),
" sometimes kept in cages and have a pretty kind of note ; it is
said also that they will imitate the human voice, but I suspect
this to be a rare instance " {Hi, 109).
(5) RUSTY-CROWNED ORIOLE (? another Agelaius) :
" Azara observed six . . . in Paraguay . . . ; one was taken alive,

caged on this account (the author can never have heard it or that

Of these besides the Common Starling {v, 3), which " is kept

SILK STARE, Sturnus sericeus L., one of which " Mr. Tunstall

" in India kept in cages for their song " (75/). Lastly the MINOR
GRACKLE (i.e. Eulabes), which is described as " remarkable for
whistling, singing and talking, more so than any Parrot, and very
distinctly, imitating the human speech in greater perfection than
any other of the feathered tribe ; . . . easily domesticated . . . five
shillings each ... at Canton
Crows
These are described in the third volume ; information as to
life in captivity is given about eight. The MAGPIE " when
brought up young, becomes familiar, will talk many sentences
and imitate like a Parrot every noise it hears, but in a less distinct
manner ". The RED-LEGGED GROW (i.e. the Chough) is
described as " thievish . . . and dangerous to be kept tame, as it
has been known to catch up lighted sticks, whereby houses have
been set on fire The HUNTING GROW ( the Hunting Cissa)
is " said to be capable of instruction and may be taught to hunt
like a Hawk, so as to catch small birds ; besides a kind of chattering
like a Jay or Magpie, it has an agreeable note and will become
very tame" (m, 54). The RED-BILLED JAY (i.e. Urocissa
erythrorhyncha ( Linn .)) is said to be often kept in cages by the Chinese,
who teach it many tricks to entertain the multitude. The BLUE
JAY " has a variety of notes, some musical, and will learn to
talk " (86) ; the CINEREOUS CROW (presumably the Canada
Jay) on the other hand is said not to bear confinement well and
also to be detested by the natives (62). The other Grows with
cage-bird mention are the PARAGUAN JAY, " common in
Paraguay . . . often domesticated," and the SURINAM CROW,
which Latham saw in Mr. Tunstall's collection and which he says
is easily tamed and often kept in houses in South America (m,
60, 64). What exactly these two are, I do not know, but they
must belong to one of the genera of South American Green Jays.
Birds of Paradise
As one would expect, there is little here as regards captivity*
for it is only of quite recent years that live specimens have been
imported and kept, but under the GREATER PARADISE

The CINEREOUS SHRIKE (i.e. the Great Grey Shrike)
" ... if kept in a cage seems content, but has no note or song
whatever ; ... in Russia . . . often trained for catching small
birds . . " (m, 6). The RED-BACKED SHRIKE " in confinement
may be fed with sheep's kidneys, of which it will eat a whole one
every day Its habit of impaling its prey both in freedom and
captivity is noted (n, 12). The JOCOSE SHRIKE of p. 42 is a
Bulbul.
The Waxwing, under the name EUROPEAN CHATTERER
has a place in the fifth volume {p. 174 ), where we read that " in
1787 . . . many were taken alive, and appeared extremely tame,
but none would live any time in cages
Larks
The three Larks mentioned as cage-birds are the SKY-LARK
and its occasional black variety caused by feeding on hemp, the
WOOD-LARK, " now and then kept in cages," and the
CALANDRE LARK, " frequently kept for its song . . . said also
to imitate that of others." Suitable food is described in a foot-note
(vi, 265, 270 , 291).
The TITLARK (i.e. the Meadow Pipit) : " Mr. White says
that when kept in a cage, it will often sing at night " ( 277).
Tits, etc.
The GREAT TIT is mentioned (vii, 246) as a possible cage-
bird and the AMOROUS TITMOUSE, P. amorous , from
N. Asia, " when kept in a cage in pairs, nothing can exceed the
fondness of one sex for the other ; perpetually caressing, by this
means alleviating the rigours of confinement and making even
captivity itself supportable ". What is this AMOROUS TIT-
MOUSE (269) ? (Is it the BEARDED TIT ?--E.H. A foot-note
on p. 299 says that according to Edwards, a cage-ful of these was
brought from Denmark by the Countess of Albemarle). The
NUTHATCH'S cage-ways are described (iv, 64).

sings delightfully in a cage, though it is kept in confinement with
difficulty, existing entirely on sugar and water " (iv, 247). Latham
also mentions the " CAPE PROMEROPS (P. cafer. Linn) " and
says that " they will easily become tame and may be fed with the
flowers of the Protea brought fresh daily . . . and when these fail
with honey and water ; and by such means have been sustained
on board ship for a good while, but not throughout the whole
passage to Europe " (vi, 1/5).
Thrushes, etc.
The BLACKBIRD " . . . frequently brought up tame . . . may
be taught to whistle tunes ..." (v, 33) ; the RED-BREASTED
THRUSH ( = the American Robin) " does not bear well confine-
ment in a cage, yet in this state will learn parts of tunes " (v, 143) ;
the SOLITARY THRUSH, Turdus solitarius Linn. (i.e. the Rock-
Thrush) is " esteemed for its song ; . . . the young ones are easily
brought up, and besides their natural sweet voice, may be taught
to whistle and articulate words ; are said also not only to sing in
the day, but also by candlelight and to live in confinement eight
or ten years ; . . . ". A foot-note says that according to Hasselquist
a bird called the " Solitaire " is so highly esteemed for its song
that it sells at Constantinople for two hundred piastres, and that
it whistles and learns to talk (v, 46).
The Mocking bird, the MIMIC THRUSH of Latham, is said
to be difficult to rear, but " to exceed even the Nightingale in
song ; . . . when raised from the nest the usual price of a good
one is from seven to fifteen, or even twenty dollars ; will breed
in confinement, instances of which are given " (v, 147 ). The CAT
FLYCATCHER (i.e. the Cat-bird, Galeoscoptes carolinensis) is also
mentioned (vi, 243) as a mimic and a bird that will " learn to
rehearse songs . . . even in a state of nature ".
" The RED-TAILED THRUSH, Janfrederic, Levaill, may be
kept tame if taken young, fed on flies and suffered to be at large
in a room " ( v , 101). This is the Cape Robin-Chat. Two other
Thrushes have cage-bird notes, but what exactly they are I do
not know. They are the TETUAN THRUSH (v, gg) " . . .

impatient of confinement, but kept ..." and the GREEN
THRUSH, Turdus virescens Linn., from China, which is described
from a cage-bird (v, 6g). The LONG-TAILED THRUSH is
a Shama and is honoured with a plate (82), but all that is said
about it in captivity is " . . . probably kept in cages ... ", and the
DIAL GRAGKLE is the Dayal Bird, which the Achinese use for
fighting (Hi, 165).
The NIGHTINGALE receives nearly two pages on its care
and ways in confinement and a white sport is mentioned (vii, 7) :
the REDSTART WARBLER (i.e. the Redstart) " when brought
up by hand may be treated as the Nightingale, and if intended
to be kept in a cage must be taken young ". The BLUE-
THROATED WARBLER (i.e. Cyanosylvia ) loses its blue if kept
in a cage (vii, 2g).
The HEDGE-SPARROW we are told " sings agreeably ... in
a cage and feeds on hemp seeds " (vii, 21).
Warblers
Those mentioned as cage-birds are the BLACKCAP, " song
much esteemed," the BOG-RUSH WARBLER (i.e. the Reed-
Warbler), " the young easily brought up, and the bird in general
is very tame and familiar," and the Dartford Warbler of which
some were reared from the nest by Col. Montagu and kept for
some time. All these are to be found in vol. in.

Under CHIMNEY SWALLOW {vii, 2J 9 ) we read that
" experiments have been made of preserving Swallows throughout
the winter in confinement, and this was effected by Mr. J. Pearson
of London and recorded in Bewick's work ( vol . i, p. 248) ; that
they were fed with the same food as the Nightingale, that they
throve extremely well, sang their song throughout the winter and
soon after Christmas began to moult, which they got through
without difficulty, and lived three or four years, regularly moulting
every year at the usual time ".

Bird Reserves. By E. C. Arnold. With nine coloured plates from
paintings by the author ; also twelve monochrome plates.
Price 15s. Published by H. F. &amp; G. Witherby, Ltd., London.
During the past few years the movement for the establishment,
and development of properly organized and practically run Nature
Reserves has gained much ground. All such schemes are of necessity
shelved for the present, but anyone interested in their progress
and anxious to keep them in mind pending the arrival of better
days could not do better than read this book. In it the author
describes how he acquired at various times five areas of marsh,
fen, and woodland, and turned each into a bird preserve.
He gives an account of how each area was converted by experi-
ments in planting, making islands, and so on to make it more
suitable to birds, and I have enjoyed this part of the book very
much indeed.

Mr. Arnold is a writer with the gift of making the most trivial
incident--digging out clay to enlarge a pond or planting water
lilies--live as vividly in the imagination of the reader as in the
memory of the author, and his accounts of such topics as the
planting of various trees and shrubs, and his failures and successes
are portrayed in language that makes one genuinely disappointed
at the refusal of this or that plant to become established, and
genuinely glad when it succeeds.
Here and there the style is rather overdone, as in such expressions
as "Sporadic sprinklings of broken glass" (p. 151) or "A now
discredited Welsh demagogue " (introduction).
Incidentally there are many very useful practical tips as to
the introduction of plants on marshy ground, and what difficulties
are likely to be encountered.
A list is given of the birds of each area, and much of the book
is taken up with field notes--largely extracts from the author's
diary--so that a very complete picture can be built up of all aspects
of the reserves. I must admit that I find the practice of giving
notes on every species, whether there is anything interesting to say
or not, a trifle tedious, but this is a minor point. There are nine
of Mr. Arnold's charming paintings of marsh birds, some black
and white drawings (the one of the Osprey is particularly good),
and some photographs of the reserves.
This book would be an excellent " escape " from the war for
anyone fond of country life, either at home or at the front. As far
as the publishers are concerned it leaves nothing to be desired.

The Loss of Cleres
During the last week in May, Cleres was heavily bombed by German aircraft,
but, though about #3,000 worth of damage was done and cottages and out-
buildings were destroyed, no one was killed and the main building was not hit.
The following mammals and birds were killed : 4 Antelopes, 2 Thoamin Deer,
1 Wallaby, 20 to 30 Ducks and Geese, 1 White-necked and 1 White Asiatic Crane
(sitting), and some Pheasants. Captain Jean Delacour wrote from Cleres on
2nd June that this damage was annoying but not too serious and that it was
his intention the collection should be maintained if " nothing worse happened ".
Since that date far worse events happened and the Editor last heard from Captain

Delacour on 10th June from farther south, where he had been retreated with
French troops, that Cleres had been entirely lost. In all his letters Monsieur
Delacour stressed the importance of continuing Avicultural publications and his
intention to do his utmost to achieve this end ; this spirit is admired by and
completely in accord with that of his English colleagues. The deepest sympathy
will be felt by his friends all over the world for Monsieur Delacour, who for
the second time has lost his collection and all his possessions to an invading
enemy. Aviculturists of all nationalities and especially those who attended
the Ornithological Congress in Rouen in 1938 will experience sincere personal
sadness that Cleres, unique in Europe, and indeed the world, for its beauty
as a setting for an exceptionally interesting zoological collection has been ravaged
by the ruthless onslaught of the aggressor.

In a letter sent to Monsieur Delacour on 30th May, Dr. J. M. Derschied stated
that his regiment had received the first onslaught of the German attack and
had in two days lost 92 per cent of their effectives, subsequently being driven back
across Belgium into France. Speaking of his collection at Sterrebeek, Dr. Derschied
wrote : " Except for the Ducks on the large lake I believe I have lost my entire
collection ; the doors of the aviaries of the Parrots, Parrakeets, Lories and Tragopans
were opened in order to save the birds from starving to death. From what I can
hear the village must have been destroyed during the battle preceding the capture
of Brussels. 55 At the time of writing this letter Dr. Derschied was in Northern
France awaiting the reorganization of the loyal Belgians to continue fighting.
Since then there has been no further communication from him.
No news has been received of Monsieur Malisoux.

FERTILITY IN PASSERINE&apos;S EGGS AFTER BEING KEPT

It is common knowledge that the eggs of poultry and game birds can be
kept safely for two or three weeks before being put down for incubation, but
I wonder if anyone is aware that the same applies to passerine birds 5 eggs.
A few weeks back a hen Bluebird who was temporarily caged with her
newly-flown young deposited an egg in her food pan. This egg was wrapped
in cotton wool and put into a box containing pheasants eggs which are turned
over daily en bloc .
When the parent blue-birds were returned to their breeding aviary they
began to build again immediately, and when the third egg had been laid I added
the egg we had been nursing for three weeks, heavily marked in ink.
At the end of ten days I tested all the eggs, six in number, and was surprised
to see that the marked egg was fertile ; it has since hatched.

In four of the five species of Tragopans (that is, Western, Satyr,
Blyth, and Temminck), the males have a coppery red as their
dominant colour. They are almost continuously distributed on
the high mountains which stretch from Kashmir to Western
China, Northern Tonkin, and Burma.
The fifth species, Cabot's Tragopan, is mainly yellowish buff,
with curiously marked back and wings which remind one of the
pattern of some old Indian shawls. The adjoining plate, by the
clever Japanese artist Kobayshi, gives an excellent idea of its
beauty.
The lovely orange yellow skin of the face in this species is a
peculiar feature, quite distinct from the golden yellow of Blyth's
Tragopan. When displaying, the wonderful green, blue, and pink
bib is also very remarkable. The female Cabot's is greyer and
darker, with more distinct spots than any of the others, and the
reddish orange skin round the eye, although not very apparent,
is a good characteristic to tell her from other Tragopan hens.
This species is found in a wild state on the mountains of Fokhien,
in Eastern China. Its range is quite isolated and in fact very far
removed from that of its nearest neighbour, Temminck's
Tragopan. These Fokhien Mountains have a very interesting
fauna ; the fine Elliot's Pheasant is another of its exclusive
inhabitants.

Twenty-five years ago Cabot's Tragopans were the commonest
species in captivity in Europe. Although there are a few in America,
where they are more numerous to-day than any other species of
the genus, they are now the rarest in Europe if we except the
Western which has been altogether absent for over fifty years,
and never was established in captivity. However, it is to be hoped
that the few pairs which exist in the hands of Mr. Spedan Lewis,
myself, and a few others will prove sufficient to increase the numbers
of these very pretty birds in our pheasantries.
Cabot's Tragopans, like all others, live at high altitudes in very
damp and chilly forests, and with us they are not adversely affected
either by cold or wet weather ; in fact, they like it. They are great
leaf eaters and in consequence should be given large planted pens
and fed with plenty of green food. In small pens, cocks are inclined
to die suddenly of apoplexy, but with plenty of exercise, such
accidents are easily avoided.
All Tragopans like to perch and females prefer to lay high

One cannot but advise phasianists who really want to learn
something, to keep the same pairs as long as possible. The more
changes one makes so much the more will our results become
entangled and implicated. That is why I had better ask my readers
who still have in their possession the O.P.S. Journal No. 6 to read
again the article dealing with our 1938 breeding season. I hope
they will not mind doing this as it will make the present one
clearer, and they will be able, like ourselves, to understand better
and make some profit from what 1939 has taught us. Note.--
In No. 7 Journal we explained that septicaemia (colibaccelli plus
streptococci) played havoc amongst our broods of Pheasants and we
indicated the remedies. So we will not return to this subject, but
let me only say that much bigger doses of anti-streptococci medicine

can be given without any harm. We give now as much as one
tablet a day to birds the size of an Elliot's, Tragopans, etc.
Aviary i. Diardi (Siamese Fireback). --This pair has been fed
on richer animal food than formerly. Here are the results. The
hen laid in three periods (seventeen eggs) instead of twice (sixteen
eggs) in 1938. Some were good, some bad, just like 1938. This hen
is certainly in better health. All the same she is not yet perfect.
Perhaps we shall find out, should the Boches permit, in 1940.
Ten chicks hatched but two did not absorb their vitellus. Among
the eight others two had faulty toes and legs after the war had
prevented us from feeding them on the new diet we had tried
that summer. Two months later we were able to resume the diet.
Both birds were cured in a short time, but only one became
perfectly straight again, the other retains a twisted leg. We have
not met with any visible coli-streptococcic septicaemia among the
chicks of this species.
Aviary 2. Fair Edwards. --Every year this hen starts laying on
19th March, just as if she knew of the calendar. Twenty-five
eggs in 1938, twenty-two in 1939. The extreme cold of 1939
winter had brought about a rheumatic attack in one of the cock's
heels and he was late in getting back to condition. The result
was that the first six eggs were infertile. Then six fertile and they
hatched. Then another eight which were not of good quality and
infertile. Then the two last eggs and one produced a chick. The
pair were fed on the same diet as the Diardi. Among their progeny
none of them had what one can call " dove's head Not one
weak chick or difficult to rear. Why then so many abortive eggs ?
Aviary 3. Elliot&apos;s. One cock , two hens.--- This is not the same trio
as we had in 1938. One of the 1938 hens got killed through dashing
against the wire netting, so we bought another. Did she arrive
a little late ? Anyhow it is not the first time we find the Elliot's
we buy, even from the most reliable persons, useless for breeding-
before they are two years old. It is the same for the cocks. On the
other hand we have kept in touch with the owners of several
specimens reared here, very carefully to tell the truth. Without
exceptions both cocks and hens proved fertile when one year old.
Does this mean that our method of rearing this species really suits
it ? Our Satyrs (aviary No. 8) might give hints to the same effect.
Or must one rather divide the Elliot's one buys into two classes ?

Class No. i to include all the birds reared in pens, whose health
has frequently been spoilt by faulty feeding, etc. While the other
group would consist of these birds which, being allowed freedom
for some weeks during their infancy, would later on become like
imported birds, either from the point of view of their diet, or from
that of their establishment. I wish I had been able to keep in
touch with the new owners of my 1938 Elliot's but they are widely
distributed. For that purpose I had sold them very cheap to a
fancier in this country. This person did not know much about
Pheasants. So I explained to him all I knew about these birds
and the reason for the low price. However, poultry and waterfowl
had already made the fellow " ingenious " so he sold our Elliot's
to complete novices for no mean prices. Afterwards these naturally
were dissatisfied as they were not well cared for and the man got
cross with me. Such is the reason why the readers and myself
will not know this spring whether or not year old Elliot's having
apparently suffered from lack of lime, but otherwise sound, can
breed the next spring. Note.---I know of two different hens (year
old) that did not lay in 1939 but laid very well this spring, despite
the fact that they had no cock. Moreover, one of them was moved
to another aviary very late in the season. The remaining hen only
laid eleven eggs instead of twelve in 1938. These Elliot's, far from
getting the extra animal food the Diardi had, were rather kept short
on that point. I feel very much inclined to begin my next sentence
with the words " Because of this " but I do not quite dare to do it.
From these eleven eggs, eleven chicks were hatched, out of which six
did not reabsorb the vitellus. A seventh chick was most interesting.
He did not reabsorb but after five days he was looking only four days old.
It is the second chick we have met with which had such a narrow
escape. It grew to a normal specimen but died quite suddenly
when four months old. It was at the time septicaemia was raging.
But such a sudden death could hardly be ascribed to it, especially
as no other Elliot's apparently contracted the disease in any
degree.
Aviary 4. Pair Vieillot Firebacks. --The hen we had formerly
was her mate's sister. Her eggs were always fertile but would not
hatch unhelped owing to the egg skin being detached too low.
Our present hen is the daughter of the above pair. She does not
at all behave in the same way. Some of her eggs are infertile.

Others do not hatch. Some chicks do not reabsorb their vitellus.
.This problem must be solved.
Aviary 5. Pair Koklass .--1939 seems to be the first year this
species has been bred in captivity. Two cocks were reared in
America, two in Germany, and one to three (cock, three hens) with
us. One pair laid seven eggs. The first egg was pure white, the other
six were blotched. From this first egg I extracted, for it could
not hatch, a chick with the upper part of the beak boneless, full
of liquid instead. So also was the hind part of the skull. All the
other eggs had this in common, that none of the chicks could
hatch. All were wrapped up in skins detached very low. No. 2
I helped too late because I had been obliged to leave home. The
other five I delivered without any trouble. No. 4 was most
interesting. The chick was strong but, as said above, the skin he
was in proved an insuperable obstacle to his hammering of the
shell. Just as if one was to hammer at something through a waving
blanket. Nevertheless the skin was not detached so low as to make
it impossible for the chick to revolve in its shell. This is what
happened. The chick succeeded in cracking the shell all round
and deep enough to chip but insufficiently to cut it. It could not
open. Then I saw what I had never before seen in my life. The chick
began chipping another turn round. I am positive on this point as I
never lost sight of this most interesting egg at any time the chick
was trying to hatch. After this had been going on for one and
a half centimetres I delivered the chick. I was most surprised
to see that this second chipping had not cut any deeper than the first.
One of the chicks met with rather a strange death. The tiny fellow
went to sleep with its foot just in the middle of a fece. In time
this got dry and when the chick woke up its foot was sticking to
the cloth. It strained its foot and died of pain in a few hours.
Aviary 5. One cock , two hens , Temminck's Tragopan. All the eggs
of the mother hen were infertile. The younger hen (daughter
of the pair) was unable to lay her first egg in spite of the fact that
the egg had a perfect shell. Heat was of no avail. It had to be
broken inside the oviduct, but the hen never got over it and she
died during that summer.
Aviary 6 . One cock and two hens , Blyth&apos;s Tragopan .--The young
hen is the pair's daughter. She was only one year old in 1939 and
did not lay. Her mother laid in exactly the same way as in 1938.

First three eggs were fertile. Only one chick hatched. This chick
died when three months old from streptococci. Since its early
days we had noticed its pulse was beating hard near one of its
nostrils. We have not yet seen a chick meet with a successful
career which had shown this sort of pulse for any serious length
of time. After this the hen laid another egg with shell incomplete,
just the same as in 1938. Apparently these birds are well cared for
and they look extremely well. Nevertheless something is wrong,
but what ?
Aviary 7. One cock and two hens. Brown Manchurians.--As in
many other cases all did not go well with this trio. In spite of
months spent together the two hens would not agree. One of
them was continually bullied by the other so no wonder her
results were negative. Most of the eggs were infertile or chicks
did not hatch. We got only one chick from her. The other hen
laid the same as in 1938. Her eggs, eighteen, nineteen and twenty,
were, exactly the same way, tough shelled and small. In 1938
I had ascribed the fact to an infection of aniodolin in the trachea.
It was only a coincidence as the same thing happened in 1939 without
any infection at all. So one sees how easy it is to jump to a conclusion
prematurely. The Crossoptilon chicks were extremely sensitive
to coli-streptococci septicaemia and we lost several. Nevertheless
we saved one which was worth while. This chick had the narrowest
escape, first from streptococci then from colibacilli and demonstrated
in a few weeks time how really efficient were the " sulfamides 55
and the pig serum against both diseases. This cock is now a strong
cock, in fact the best of the lot.
Aviary 8 . One cock Satyr Tragopan and two hens. --The aviary
bred hen laid twelve eggs and eleven hatched. The last one nearly
succeeded but its shell had been badly cracked and greatly sunken
before we put it into the incubator. No wonder the embyro under
these abnormal conditions died two days before hatching was due.
With the imported hen matters did not prove very good. In 1938
she laid seven eggs. In 1939 she laid sixteen but of these two were
infertile, ten became addled, one did not hatch, and only three
did so. These chicks were weak in sharp contrast with their half-
brethren (aviary bred mother) which were perfect. Why again ?
The coli-streptococcic septicaemia proved dangerous for this
species. There was one curious case. A chick had been very ill

from it. Three days after it suddenly became a cripple with crooked
toes and distorted legs, at the same time becoming very thin.
At once we gave the whole brood an extra dose of lime water and
D Vitamins. In a week's time the little patient entirely recovered.
This was hardly over when two other chicks began to develop
crooked toes (one each) in spite of the fact that they had been fed
on the same diet which had cured the brother. The funny thing is
that while that poor cripple only spent a week in getting cured,
the others took a very long time to heal their slight deformities.
I hope somebody will be able to give an explanation, I cannot.
It is possible that the first chick suffered from a severe attack of
rickets and became weakened by its dangerous illness, while
another sort of avitaminsis distorted the toes of its two brethren.
I shall welcome correspondence from any reader who can enlighten
me.
Aviary g. One cock and two hens , Mikado .--These two year old
hens only laid thirty-eight eggs between them, instead of fifty-four
laid in 1938. Again one-third became addled or chicks unable
to hatch. Two chicks looked as if they had badly formed thigh
bones at birth. These bones were quite soft and got broken.
Lack of lime probably. Another chick must have had one of the
vertebrae forked in the spine as it developed a hunch-back after-
wards. All this points to a lack of lime with the parents. Unhappily
we are unable to experiment any further with this trio as the cock
got accidently killed in March. Our experiments with these
Mikados seem to hint that the chicks unable to hatch, the addled
and even the infertile eggs with the Pheasants (and perhaps all
aviary birds) must come from slight causes which one could find
out. We shall see what one can learn on the subject this spring.
Aviary 10. Pair Impeyans. --This pair is billeted with a friend.
In 1939 we got twelve eggs and all hatched, beautiful chicks but
most sensitive to colibaccili streptococci. Four of them died in a
few hours. Chick No. 11 hatched the wrong'way down. It chipped
towards the small end of the egg opposite the air cell. It is rather
annoying when one must deliver a chick, as one has to guess through
a shell instead of peeping through an opening. These Impeyan
eggs have demonstrated a fact some other eggs had given us cause
for suspicion about. The readers of the O.P.S. Journal No. 4 will
perhaps remember that in it I explained how to deliver these

chicks. Note.--We had better repeat that the best sign of maturity,
i.e. that the chick is ready to hatch, is when it has burst through
its shell membrane, not only with its beak but also with neck and
shoulder. Such a chick must have its head delivered at once and
the cotton wool and wire collar put on, otherwise the chick will die.
In another journal I had said also how to scour the eggs with citric
acid just before hatching time, first to disinfect them and also to
make them translucid for the testing. A most important thing in
case of artificial delivery. At the time the editor of an important
avicultural paper was good enough to write to me on the subject
but he said I was scouring the eggs in order to make the shells thinner
to help the hatching. Happily I had never written anything of the
sort as it is just the reverse that is true. A chick, to be successful in
hatching, must first cut round three quarters of its shell, but for
this accomplishment it must revolve in its egg. It does this through
kicking. When the top of the shell is almost entirely cut from the
lower part, a last kick " throws open the lid But this is what
happens, not infrequently with eggs that have been too well
thinned. After the chick has cut round some part of the shell but
much less than three-quarters, the " lid 55 begins to try to give way
before the kicking starts. But it does not succeed because the
weakened shell cracks lengthwise. Then the egg becomes like a
sort of box with a spring lid whose top can no more be broken open
because too small a part of the circumference has been cut, while
on the other hand the chick can no longer revolve to cut further
because the springy nature of its prison takes all firm ground
away from under its kicking. That is the way experience joins
with logic. It might perhaps have been easier to begin with the
last. The purpose of the Ordainer of all things was evidently not
to offer us thinning possibilities when He fixed the appointed
degree of thickness for all egg shells.

A Message from the President of the O.P.S.
To maintain the activity of a Society such as our O.P.S. in
war time is a serious proposition, but we mean to do it. Although
we are proud to be an International body, the majority of our
members are British and French, and since Great Britain and
France are involved in the struggle we have to face numerous
difficulties. It was unanimously agreed, however, by the Com-
mittee that we should carry on. It is unfortunately impossible to
continue to issue our Journal as before, but we have found the
most cordial help from the Avicultural Society in London, the
mother-society of bird activities the world over. Instead of our
own Journal, members of the O.P.S. receive now a special number
of the Avicultural Magazine and they will not lose through it. At
the same time, readers of the Avicultural Magazine will benefit
by the-contributions of the Pheasant specialists. No one will contest
that Pheasant keeping and breeding is a particularly interesting
branch of aviculture. When peace reigns again we hope to resume
the publication of our journal, but till then we intend to use the
Avicultural Magazine's hospitality.
One feared, when the war broke out, that bird keeping in general
and Pheasant keeping in particular would suffer a very serious
setback. From the beginning I appealed to aviculturists to maintain
their collections. It now appears that there is a tremendous demand
in Europe for home-bred birds as all fresh imports have ceased.
Pheasants consequently are much sought after this year. In fact,
all birds bred in 1939 have been easily disposed of. It is a great
encouragement for our members to persevere in their hobby, and
I have no doubt that the 1940 season will be a prosperous one.

A Few Remarks from the Secretary of the O.P.S.
Writing these notes in the latter part of the month of June,
one finds it most difficult to concentrate or prophesy as to the present
or future position of the O.P.S. In this copy of the Avicultural
Magazine there are articles by eminent phasianists, Captain J.
Delacour and Monsieur Malisoux. Since these articles were

written both of the collections of birds owned by these gentlemen
have been totally lost, at least we can only conclude this. The
loss to all Pheasant and bird lovers of many valuable species of
Pheasants is absolutely irreparable. At the moment we have not
heard if any of the Pheasants or other birds were evacuated from
either Cleres or Namur, if not then the loss of such species as the
Imperial and other species will be tragic indeed. Most of us know
Captain Delacour's collection, but only a privileged few have
visited Namur to see Monsieur Malisoux's collection. For many
years past he has been steadily building up good breeding pairs
of the most valuable species and great success was attending his
efforts, now all is lost and indeed we have heard nothing of the
owner. For the past twelve years my father and Monsieur Malisoux
have been staunch personal friends, and I think my father is
correct in saying that if Monsieur Malisoux finds it impossible to start
collecting again then the fancy has lost a member who will never
be replaced. One has only to read his many articles in the journals
to realize that he was a man who studied Pheasants as no other
fancier has ever done before. I am sure I am voicing the feelings
of every member of the Avicultural Society and the O.P.S. when
I extend to Captain Delacour and Monsieur Malisoux the sincere
sympathy of all the members.
To turn to the O.P.S., I do not know what steps will be taken
by Captain Delacour and Major Elliot-Benham as to carrying
on for the duration of the war ; that must be left in abeyance for
the time being. However, I hope I am justified in stating that
after the war is over the Society will renew its full activities, which
must be curtailed for the time being. It is impossible to say more
than this at present. I am aware of the fact that many good
collections in Great Britain have of necessity been dispersed, yet
on the other hand there is encouragement in the fact that a great
many members have written to say they must cease membership
during the war but will certainly rejoin afterwards. Such state-
ments prove that interest is still present if now possibly latent.
For the past nine months I have been unable to devote much
time to the work of the Society, and must confess to being more
or less out of touch with the members and the activities of the
Society. However, my father has done his best to keep the flag
flying under difficult circumstances, and he has been greatly

I wish to place on record our most sincere thanks to the
Avicultural Society and Miss Barclay-Smith, the Editor, for
allowing us to make use of their Magazine in order to send to our
members this Pheasant number. It is right that our members
should know that they are charging us nothing for this privilege,

indeed in having such a powerful Society to help us in difficult

who has been untiring in her efforts to make this number a success ;
that she has succeeded I am sure our members will agree.

not appeal in vain to our members to send their usual subscriptions

Dawyck lies in the Upper Tweed Valley in the County of
Peebles. Its lowest altitude is the level of the river, 600 feet above
the sea, and the hills&apos; rise to 2,400 feet. They are clothed with
hardwoods to 850 feet and conifers above to timber level at
1,300 feet. The average rainfall is about 36 inches and zero frosts,
though unusual, are far from unknown. In the past winter 3 degrees
below zero Fahr. was the most severe visitation but was preceded
by many nights of 20 degrees and more.
The first game birds I turned down here were four brace of
Red-legged Partridges (.Alectoris rufa ), caught in the Orleans
district and released in December, 1925. The experiment was

quite unsuccessful, as indeed it might well be in this lofty cold
region in the case of a bird from S.W. Europe. An occasional
one was subsequently picked up dead and one was shot in the
following season. I am almost certain they did not breed.
In more recent years I have put out Ghukor Partridges ( Alectoris
chukar ) from Asia, and Bob-Whites iColinus virginianus) from America.
Charming birds, both of them, because of their engaging tameness
and propensity to lay prolifically. Both species are now raised
in enormous numbers in the United States and released in many
parts of that country. The Ghukors have quite established
themselves on the sandy sunny slopes of Foxwarren Park in Surrey,
but I have no knowledge of Bob-Whites in a wild state in Great
Britain. It is greatly to be regretted that attempts in Midlothian
and here have failed to establish Ghukors in Scotland. They will
stand a considerable amount of cold but continued rain is fatal
to their chicks. Adult birds will winter safely enough if kept under
cover.
Another disappointment was my introduction of the so-called
Mountain Quail from California (Oreortyx picia plumifera). The
bird is more nearly a Partridge than a Quail. As it is to be found
in the high Sierra Nevada mountains of California and has been
successfully introduced as far north as Vancouver Island, I had
good reason to expect it might thrive at Dawyck. The Californian
Valley Quail ( Lophortyx californica) is a most sporting bird to shoot
and inhabits the dry chaparral thickets of the Coast Range and
the vineyards of the San Joaquin Valley. It was introduced long
ago and I believe has survived for a few seasons in the Eastern
Counties, but it has never become established. I had a number
of them in a covered pen as a boy and remember my excitement
when they began to lay their dark mottled eggs. It was a sad
disappointment that the Mountain Quail which I kept penned up
here soon succumbed during a wet spring, and the same was true
of those I sent to Mr. P. J. Lambert, of Nawton near York. However,
there are, or were till recently, still survivors from among those
sent to the Zoo and to M. Jean Delacour out of the same
consignment.
My next venture was at last a successful one. After vain attempts
in 1929 and 1930 to raise Capercaillie from eggs and day old
chicks, I was able to get a pair of live birds from Deeside in August,

1930, three hens and one cock from Finland in November of that
year, and two cocks and one hen, also from Finland, in October,
1931. They have bred in our woods every year since 1932. During
the last four years some 300 acres of mature Scots Pine and Larch
have been felled, but there are still sufficient old and young
coniferous woods to keep a fair stock of these splendid birds on
the ground.
I have made several efforts to arrange the importation of
Hazel Hen (Bonasa bonasa) from Norway, Austria, Sweden, and
Finland but with no success. I have many times examined the
contents of the crops of these birds, commonly sold by British
poulterers, and found that buds of Birch and Aspen Poplar seem
to be their staple food. They are native of all Central and Northern
Europe except our islands. If this introduction were ever successfully
made they would be a great addition to the sporting value of such
country as that of the Argyll and Inverness sea-boards where
in the prevailing natural birch and oak woodlands little game
is to be found except woodcock in winter.
I have Red Indian Jungle Fowl running wild in considerable
numbers. They lay freely but do not raise large broods. Hedgehogs
rob their nests and I fear Brown Owls take heavy toll of the chicks.
This year a hen was actually seen on New Year's Day with three
chicks. The arctic weather which soon followed doubtless made
an end of them. Jungle fowl of either sex have the mastery of
wild Pheasants.
Wild Turkeys thrive well--indeed far better than domestic
turkeys do in this cold region. They lay freely and although we
set the earlier eggs under fowls and hand rear them, the turkeys
themselves raise their young successfully, though perhaps not
more than four or five out of ten or more eggs hatched. They
meet with a ready sale at Christmas when a rook-rifle is used for
killing them.
Of Pheasants I have only released Reeves, Lady Amhersts, and
Blue Crossoptilons. The hens of the first are seldom to be seen
and I doubt if many wild broods have been raised. The cocks
become tame and one or tw r o are always in the near neighbourhood
of the Pheasant pens, though sometimes flushed far away in the
woods.
Lady Amhersts are to be seen everywhere in the environs

of the house though never more than half a mile away. I cannot
see any signs of animosity between them and the common Pheasants.
Jungle Fowl, Lady Amhersts, Melanistic Pheasants, and Blue
Crossoptilons can frequently be seen feeding simultaneously at the
same hopper in perfect amity. With the war upon us I am tempted
to release other Pheasants ; however, no member of the Kalij
group would be a safe denizen of our woodlands as they are well
known for their inveterate pugnacity.
As we have generally had difficulty in rearing Monauls to
maturity we purpose this year to place eggs in Capercaillie nests.
Whether this is likely to succeed I do not know. The period for
hatching Monaul eggs is twenty-eight days and Capercaillie twenty-
four which may render the attempt abortive.
I have put early Ptarmigan eggs into late high up Grouse
nests, but only once have I seen a Ptarmigan go over the butts
as a result of this experiment. Ptarmigan used to be native on the
tops of these hills as lately as 1861.
The Bamboo Partridge (Bambusicola thoracica ) is a native of
Western Szechuan, in the Valley of the Upper Yangtze, up to
2,000 feet. It is a species well worth establishing in this country.
It is incorrigibly wild when penned but perfectly hardy and a
prolific egg-layer. I shall turn out three pairs this spring on newly
cultivated fields and hope for good results.
There are some who deprecate the introduction of exotic birds
as possibly leading to regrettable results. As far as I am aware
there has not been a single introduction of a gallinaceous species
in the world which has not been advantageous. The establishment
of the Pheasant as well as the Red-legged Partridge in this country,
and of the Pheasant and European Partridge in America have
proved valuable achievements. By the way, our Partridge is
universally known as the Hungarian Partridge in the United States.
A misleading name indeed for a bird which is found from Sweden
to the Mediterranean and from Ireland to Southern Siberia.
The re-introduction to Scotland of the Capercaillie in 1837 and
1838 after over sixty years of extinction is regretted by no one,
unless it be the stricter officers of the Forestry Commission.

By J. Delacour
Many a time bird lovers have told me that they were not
interested in Pheasants because of the difficulty of accommodating
them. Each pair of Pheasants, on account of the violent and
jealous disposition of the cocks, has to be kept in a separate pen.
Not even one cock and several hens can always be kept together.
With quite a number of species hens will fight if two or three
inhabit the same enclosure and on several occasions, with Soemmerr-
ing's in particular, I have experienced that one would not leave
the other in peace, and without actually killing her make her
die of starvation and misery.
To add to the expense and trouble it is useless to try to keep
Pheasants in a pen which is not covered over with wire netting.
Even pinioned birds can jump and climb up fences so that they
easily get over them.
I agree that if Pheasants are kept for breeding purposes, or
in the case of very valuable species, the only correct way to house
them is to build rows of suitable aviaries where pairs or ones
can be isolated.
But it is also possible to keep Pheasants for the sake of their
beauty only, without especially trying to breed them but with a
view of enjoying them as pleasing and interesting objects. Nothing
finer can be seen than cock Pheasants walking about a garden or
park or living together in a large aviary. Many of us have tried
the experiment in different ways and with variable luck. I have
done so myself for over thirty years and have seen it done by others
in different countries at different times. Perhaps an account of
these various attempts, their success or the contrary, may be of
interest to our readers.
It cannot be denied, however, that keeping many Pheasants
together is not an easy proposition.
It is, of course, more difficult to make many Pheasants live
together peacefully in a small space than in a large one. Hence
gathering them in an aviary, even a very spacious one, requires

more precautions than when they are more or less at liberty over
a wider and more natural piece of ground.
One rule is all-important : unless one has the use of hundreds
of acres it is only possible to keep males together if trouble is to be
avoided. But this is not sufficient. These males must be intro-
duced to one another in a season when they are not too pugnacious,
that is to say, from August till January. The aviary or small
garden ought to be well planted, so that persecuted birds can hide
or escape by perching from bullies. In all cases the weaker
species must be left full-winged, otherwise they may be cornered
and killed ; only the strong and dominant birds are better pinioned
for the opposite reason. Also it is essential to avoid altogether
the more pugnacious and spiteful species and individuals. In
any case careful watching and supervision are necessary at the
beginning and in the Spring. In a large park, however, it is
often possible to keep several species of Pheasants of both sexes
at liberty where they can breed freely without interfering with
one another. Mixing species of the same genus .is to be avoided,
otherwise worthless hybrids would be produced. But this is more
the scope of game-birds' acclimatization than of aviculture. In
this particular branch the most successful attempt that I know
of is what has been achieved at Woburn Abbey by the Duke of
Bedford. For half a century, and after having tried many different
species, the following Pheasants have quite settled down and
reproduced themselves regularly : Common, Reeves, Elliots,
Black-crested Kalijs, and Amhersts. Attempts to establish other
species have failed. There are also at Woburn a few Manchurian
and Blue Eared Pheasants, which were sent from Cleres during
the last twenty years, but the experiment is not yet conclusive.
All these birds breed in a natural state at Woburn, rearing
their own chicks, except the Elliots which have held their own only
by the eggs being picked up and the chicks reared under domestic
hens. To these Pheasants are added Wild and Brush Turkeys
and Red Jungle Fowls.
As one is aware, however, the conditions of space and care
obtained at Woburn are unique, and it would be useless to try
to establish several species of Pheasants in a much smaller space.
In enclosures and parks of moderate size all attempts usually end
in two or three species taking advantage over the others and

remaining alone after a few years. Recently, however, Mr. Balfour
seems to have been very successful in establishing several species
on his estate, and he tells us about it in this same number of the
Magazine.
On Mr. A. Ezra's estate, at Foxwarren Park, Silver Pheasants
have gradually eliminated Common, Reeves, Goldens, etc. Only
Jungle Fowl and Peafowl have been tolerated, and also some Blue
Eared Pheasants. At Wormley Bury, near Broxbourne, Major A.
Pam's property, Golden and Amherst Pheasants are doing well,
although naturally hybridizing, and also Jungle Fowl. Cheer and
Swinhoes disappeared quickly, and Eared Pheasants had to be
removed on account of their bad temper in the breeding season.
I heard also that before 1914 Lord Poltimore had been able to
keep and breed several species of Pheasants at liberty in his park.
I could report of many other such experiments, the results of
which have been similar.
On moderate sized grounds, nevertheless, I am convinced that
the correct way to introduce Pheasants for " show " is to stick to
cocks only. Risks of fights and losses are very much lessened if
not even removed entirely. As far as large aviaries are concerned
one of my oldest recollections is that of the great flying cage at the
Antwerp Zoo, which has long since been pulled down. About
1910, one could see there nearly fifty cock Pheasants of various
sorts, living seemingly in peace among Cranes, Herons, Water-
fowls, etc. The effect was very pleasant, but I cannot say whether
there were many losses or not through fighting. At the same time,
at Villers Bretonneux I used to keep a dozen cock Pheasants,
several being hybrids, in a special aviary about 25 feet by 15 feet, at
the entrance of the pheasantry. But I must confess that two or
three birds were killed every spring. There was no cover in the
aviary. Near New York, at Scardsdale, my friend Mr. R. Maresi,
always keeps a few cock Pheasants of different species in some of
his aviaries. They are carefully made used to one another, and
Mr. Maresi is practically never troubled with fights and seldom
loses a bird.
I have heard that in New England one could admire in a large
and well-kept garden several hundred cocks, Golden and Amherst,
and I well believe that the effect is wonderful.
I now come to what we have done at Cleres. Since my early

days as an aviculturist, Pheasants have been among my favourites.
Truly cock Pheasants of almost every species range among the
most beautiful birds in the world. When I was fifteen I already kept
over twenty species and bred many of them. But I also had to
face the problem of available room. A hundred pens makes a
large Pheasantry, but it is not large enough for many breeding
pairs of each species. Of the rare ones it is wise to keep at least
four pairs, and there are more than thirty desirable and obtainable
species of Pheasants. One naturally reaches the decision of
reducing the common sorts to one pen, and to keep several birds
together for " show ". I said above that I first tried to keep
a dozen cocks in a medium sized aviary with moderate success.
When, after the destruction of Villers, I moved to Cleres in 1920,
I first attempted to keep most of my Pheasants at liberty in the
park, which consists of a piece of hilly ground of fifty acres with a
lake, river, grass, and isolated trees and patches of woods and
shrubbery, enclosed by wire netting fences 1 o feet high, with 2 feet
buried in the ground. Other larger enclosures and woods of
some 300 acres connected with large forests and farm land and
pastures, surround it everywhere. The rare Pheasants only, such
as Tragopans, Argus, Peacock-Pheasants, etc., were put into
special pens. The result was poor. A good many birds strayed or
escaped as others chased them, and being pinioned they could
not get back. A few were killed and none bred well, except the
stronger birds, such as Monauls and Silvers.
I hastened to build new pens in sufficient numbers, and soon
every pair or trio was properly housed. I wanted, however, to
see Pheasants in the park. I left some Silver, Reeves, Corean
Ringnecks, and Monauls and a few odd cocks Black Kalij, Siamese
Firebacks, and Swinhoes, as well as Manchurian Eared Pheasants
and Red Jungle Fowls, Wild Turkeys, Black-winged and Spicifer
Peafowls. Some Monauls, a good many Silvers, Turkeys, Brush
Turkeys, Peafowls, and Red Jungle Fowls even bred. The latter,
the Turkeys, and Peafowls kept on breeding well, but even Reeves
and Silver Pheasants gradually died down ; and the Monauls also
even quicker. At the present time there are only a few cocks
left, which of course look very fine. Corean Ringnecks like all
other races of Common Pheasants were a failure ; they soon
wandered away and disappeared. Black Kalij and Swinhoes proved

a nuisance : even odd males are terribly quarrelsome, kill all
other game birds they can reach and master. They had to be
quickly removed. Silvers and Reeves, also bad-tempered, are not
nearly so dangerous, especially when pinioned, while weaker birds
are full-winged. Among the latter I now have some cock Amhersts,
Golden, and hybrids. They soon become very tame, do not fight
viciously, and make a miscellaneous show. For gardens and small
parks they are very much more to be recommended.
Cheer, Eared-Pheasants, and Monauls, the first two of a very
tame disposition, would be very nice if they had not such a pro-
pensity to dig in the ground ; they are impossible gardeners !
They are, on the contrary, suitable for a large park and rough
ground. Gurassows and Guans are usually amusing and tame,
but very susceptible to frost. During the summer months they
can be kept at liberty ; unfortunately they too often become spiteful
to other birds and even to human beings. Wild Turkeys are in
every way excellent park birds, very handsome, and breeding
freely. They are also far better eating than their domestic relatives.
Brush Turkeys, with their curious mound building habits, are of
exceptional interest, and do extremely well. Some, however, but
not all, are bad egg-eaters and great bullies, killing other game
birds which venture near their tumuli. However, I keep them at
Cleres, where they breed well.
When new game birds are to be introduced into the park and
garden it is safer to place them first in a pen situated in a quiet
part of the grounds, with a view of a good part of them. After
two or three weeks the door is opened and they come out gradually,
not being frightened and knowing where they are. If birds are
let out abruptly they run about terrified and are usually chased
and killed by long-established residents.

There are few better illustrations of the saying " Familiarity
breeds Contempt " than that afforded by the common Peacock,
which rivals all other birds in his magnificence yet is of little value
compared with many other birds which can boast of none of his
splendour. If only the Peacock were a rare bird his price would be
above rubies, but he has been known in Europe for so long that
no one thinks very much of him, no one, at least, who regards
himself as an authority on birds. But to the man in the street he
still possesses a great attraction. Go to the Zoo in April or May on
a fairly busy day and you will have some difficulty in passing the
Peafowl aviary on account of the admiring crowd, though you will
be able to walk quite easily in front of the cages containing the
Birds of Paradise !
The Common or Blue Peafowl (Pavo cristatus), of India and
Ceylon, has been known in captivity from so early a time that
nothing very definite on the subject can be ascertained. We know
that King Solomon imported it into Palestine and that the Ancient
Greeks knew it quite well, but in spite of the antiquity of its
domestication, this has never been more than partially successful.
At one time it was valued as an article of food, but, being slow to
reach maturity, it was never a paying proposition and the introduc-
tion of the Turkey put it right out of favour.
The precincts of country mansions are the ideal setting for
Peafowl to display their splendour on the broad lawns or
perched on parapet or statue with train sweeping to the ground.
There they are perfectly at home with little disposition to wander
or stray. Strict captivity is not entirely to the liking of this species
and the chicks are not very easy to rear, requiring as they do far
more animal food than either those of poultry or other of the
Pheasant tribe. But in semi-freedom the Peahen hatches her brood
in a hedgerow or beneath a clump of brambles and leads them forth
in search of the insects and grubs in which they delight. When adult
they are perfectly hardy, preferring to roost in the branches of high
trees, however cold the weather, to any sort of shelter.
The Peacock has his regular display ground, such as a mound

beneath the shade of a large tree or an open clearing in a wood
where, during spring, with his splendid train extended, he struts
around, fully conscious of his attractions and every now and then
giving vent to his most unpleasing challenging call ; and there the
Peahens visit him from time to time.
Although Peafowl have been in captivity for so long, the amount
of variation from the type that has occurred is remarkably small, far
less than in any other domestic animal. Two mutations have
appeared, a white variety and the so-called japanned, or black-
shouldered bird. The latter was at one time thought to be a distinct
species and given the name of Pavo nigripennis, but it is nothing more
than a sport which, however, breeds true. In this mutation the
pigment seems to have mostly gone to the male sex, as he is of a
darker and richer colour than the type, and his lesser and median
wing-coverts, instead of being mottled with black and buff, are all
brownish black with glossy reflections. The hen is nearly white,
with a greenish or bluish neck, and the chicks are entirely creamy
white. By crossing white birds with normal or black-shouldered
specimens, pied birds are produced which are anything but beautiful.
Mr. Whitley, who has a large number of Peafowl at Primley,
told me that if one keeps both the common and its white variety,
it is difficult to preserve a stock of the white birds because the
Peahens, whether normal or white, will never visit or mate with a
white cock if there is a normally coloured Peacock in the neigh-
bourhood.
With the breaking up of so many large estates where Peafowl
were formerly kept it is to be feared that these splendid birds will
be less and less seen in our country.
The other distinct species of Peafowl is the Javan, Spicifer, or
Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus ), which is easily distinguished from the
Indian bird by the following characters ; the crest, instead of being
formed of bare shafts tufted only at the tips, is composed of a long
tuft of feathers webbed from the base ; the legs are longer than in
P. cristatus , making the bird appear taller ; the skin of the face
is bright blue and yellow ; the neck is green instead of blue, and
the sexes are alike except for the absence of the train in the Peahen.
The Javan Peafowl is less adapted to captivity in Europe than
is its Indian relative. It is less hardy and the young more difficult
to rear ; and it generally breeds later in the year, so that the chicks

have not time to become fully reared before the winter. It is a wilder
bird, inclined to wander if liberated, and the males, when tame,
almost invariably become savage and actually dangerous. It is,
however, a wonderfully beautiful bird and well worth keeping in
very large enclosures.
Although the two species of Peafowl are so distinct, they readily
hybridize and, strangely enough, the progeny is fertile. I think
the finest Peacock I have ever seen was a hybrid between the Javan
and Black-shouldered variety of the common species which was,
I believe, bred by Mr. Bertram Jones, a great Peafowl enthusiast.
It had a much finer train than in any other I have seen and its
colours were magnificent.
The Burmese race of P. muticus is slightly darker than the Javan
bird, and has been distinguished as P. m. spiciferus.

I have recently had the pleasure of reading a most interesting
book written by Mr. E. H. Wilson. The title of the treatise is
A Naturalist in Western China , and it is published by Messrs. Methuen
and Co., 36 Essex Street, London, W.C. The publishers kindly
allow me to quote from the book and to use references for this
article. I must thank Mr. F. R. S. Balfour, a member of the
Avicultural Society and the O.P.S., for sending me the work,
and it is worth while to note in passing that it was through
Mr. Balfour's influence and generosity that Mr. Wilson made the
trip to China to discover and bring back with him specimens of
the flora which abounds in Western China. I was most intrigued
to discover that the author devotes several chapters to Pheasants
and other game birds in general, and I feel sure it will interest
members both of the Avicultural Society and the O.P.S. to know
what Mr. Wilson has to say about these Chinese Pheasants.
It was in the years 1907-1910 that the expedition was made,
and the book deals with the flora and fauna of the vast tract of
country west of Ichang, incidentally famous for its brand of China
</bodyText>

tea. The collection of some 3,000 skins serves to prove his interest
in this ornithological pursuit. It would appear that Mr. Wilson
considers China is the headquarters of the Pheasant family, a
statement some aviculturists may feel disposed to dispute, but it
is not a matter we need trouble about at the moment.
The Chinese Pheasant, commonly known as the Ring-neck
(.Phasianus torquatus ), is first dealt with, and it is stated that all
sportsmen will know that this bird was introduced into Europe
and crossed with the native Pheasant. One can only surmise that
the native bird referred to is P. colchicus. This Pheasant can hardly
be styled a native of Europe proper, though of Asia Minor certainly.
Yet I must admit that the Marquess Hachisuka tells us of a Pheasant
which is indigenous to the Balkans, so I may be wrong. The
country west of Western Hupeh, of which the city of Ichang is
die gateway, " constitutes a natural boundary for members of
the animal and vegetable kingdoms. The flora and fauna found
east of this region are, generally speaking, totally different to that
found to the westward." Apparently this is caused by the nature
of the country. Within a series of mountain ranges lies the Red
Basin of Szechuan, a district well known to all phasianists as the
home of many Pheasants. There are some six species or sub-
species of Phasianus in this district, each occupying a particular
geographical area. The author complains that these birds have
been split up into sub-species and races and asserts that the actual
differences " exist on paper only ". This I think is incorrect ;
such Pheasants have not been so divided without solid and
definite grounds for so doing. Furthermore, Mr. Wilson himself
tells us of distinct differences in plumage ; the assembly of the
plumage may be similar, but that does not signify that Pheasants
are of the same species.
Ph. holderei is mentioned as being a bird of the mountain ranges,
whereas torquatus is a Pheasant of the plains. The author states
that the latter is almost semi-aquatic by nature, loving to live
and feed in reed beds and marshy ground. I was glad to read this
statement as I like to think that originally most of the Pheasants
we know thrived in such surroundings. The picture of an
Amherst Pheasant cock seeking its food by the side of a mountain
stream, conjures up a scene of intense beauty--of a most lovely
bird seeking its sustenance with that neat flick of the beak on a

partly submerged pebble which may disclose an aquatic insect,
and we can further imagine its mate waiting, perhaps in vain,
for a tit-bit.
To return to the book we are discussing. The only difference
between torquatus and holderei is that the latter has no white eyebrows
although frequently the white ring round the neck is completely
missing in holderei , a very strange thing indeed. No doubt in years
past both these Pheasants were sent to Europe and called
Ring-neck, and in passing I remember a friend telling me he had
bought a Chinese Ring-neck which had no white collar. At the
time I was not interested as I thought it a freak, but now I
realize it must have been holderei.
At the time the author wrote this book all these Pheasants
were common and even abundant, but he significantly remarks
that they are " ever decreasing in numbers ".
West of the Min River Valley the Ph. elegans is found. The
male has a dark green instead of a purple breast, terra-cotta instead
of dull yellow sides, and is, generally speaking, smaller. Around
Sungpan occurs a Pheasant which closely resembles the last named,
but we are told this is probably a local form of the species.
The author tells us that at one time the birds were so common
and tame that the natives were able to knock them over with a
stick, but he declares that this is probably an Eastern exaggeration ;
one certainly hopes that this is the case, for a more horrible method
of killing cannot be conceived.
On mountainous country bordering the Red Basin is found
Ph. herezovskyi. The crown of the head is purplish, the neck a
lustrous green, and chest and breast, a rich coppery-bronze.
The Ringless or Ph. decollatus is apparently restricted to low
hilly country bordering the Yangtsze River and in the valley of
the Min River around Kiating Fu. Although some confusion has
arisen regarding the identification of this bird it should be noted
that since the publication of this book, the true identification has
been definitely established. At one time a Pheasant of this species
without a ring around the neck was certainly a novelty to the
Chinese and even to that great traveller, Swinhoe.
Strauch's Pheasant {Ph. strauchi) occurs in Kansu and in
mountainous country bordering the Amdo region. It is similar
to Ph. decollatus with slight differences in plumage.

Now we come to Pheasants outside the group known as Phasianus ,
and the first mentioned is the well known and majestic Reeves
(Syrmaticus reeve si ). It occurs in the wooded country north and
south of Ichang at an altitude of between 2,000 and 5,000 feet.
So it will be seen that it is rather local, as indeed are most of the
Chinese Pheasants, although when the word " local " is used in
regard to a vast country like China, the word loses much of its
significance as applied to such countries as Great Britain. Mr. John
Reeves sent specimens of this Pheasant to England as far back as
1808. Mr. Wilson mentions a specimen that was shot near Nanto
at the head of the Ichang Gorge, it measured some 7 ft. 2 in.,
tip to tip ! Just imagine that bird in full flight ! It will be unnecessary
to describe this bird ; it is well known to all of us and may in future
years become established in the wild state in Great Britain, as
indeed it is at Dawyck in Scotland at the present time ; yet it
will not be out of place to mention that although it is spoken of
in this book as being most numerous, this is far from being the case
in these times. The natives call the Reeves, " ClTu che " (Arrow
Chicken), a beautiful description, for when in flight an arrow is
immediately brought to one's mind. This I will vouch for as I have
seen the Reeves in flight on more than one occasion. The author
suggests that L'Abbe David, in mentioning this bird as being the
original of the Phoenix Bird, is probably correct, but this does
not bear out the solution as propounded in the O.P.S. Journal,
dated September, 1939, by the Marquess Hachisuka. In this
article the Marquess proves beyond reasonable doubt that the
Rheinhardt's Argus Pheasant was the original of the mythical
Phoenix.
We are told that our little friend the Golden Pheasant ( Chrysolo-
phus pictus) is abundant in Western Hupeh and Eastern Szechuan ;
this geographical range corresponds with the Reeves. It is rarely
seen by travellers and trapping is about the only method of securing
specimens. The author does mention one shot he missed at a
Golden cock and when I read this sentence I chuckled and was
pleased ! It frequents dense woods where evergreens abound.
When one writes of " dense woods " the word " dense " must be
taken in its literal sense ; a Britisher speaking of a dense wood
implies only a thicket as compared to the forests and woods in
many parts of the world. The Golden is called by the natives

" The Golden Chicken 55 . I once read of it as ' 4 The Bird the sun
always shines on ", this is surely a most beautiful description.
West of the district mentioned one finds the Lady Amherst
(Ch. amherstia), and apparently these " cousins " are never found
in the same locality.
(Note that nature is wiser than mortals, who disregarding natural
beauty, cross the Lady Amherst with the Golden, to the detriment
of both species.) The tail feathers of the Lady Amherst are
extensively used by the Chinese for theatricals, and strange to
relate the cape (that most wonderful feature of both the Lady
Amherst and the Golden) is used to adorn the caps of favourite
male children.
In the upland thickets throughout Western Szechuan is found
a Blood Pheasant ( Ithaginis geoffroyi), which was abundant at the
time this traveller was in Western China. A short description may
prove of interest. In the male, crest, dark grey ; feathers of back
and chest lance shaped, grey in colour, each with a fine longitudinal
white stripe ; breast and sides, light green ; under tail coverts,
crimson ; tail feathers, light grey, edged with crimson. Female
similar to male. It will be noted that as regards the formation of
the plumage this bird is similar to the Blood Pheasant of Northern
India. One wonders why this Pheasant has never been imported
into European and American aviaries, for it should prove hardier
than the same species of India. It is, however, probable that its
numbers are so much reduced that it is virtually impossible to
secure specimens. Most certainly at the present time, or until
peace is restored between China and Japan, no Chinese Pheasants
will be exported. Mr. Zappey, who accompanied Mr. Wilson on
this adventure, shot specimens of a Blood Pheasant which proved
new to science and this sub-species was named Ith. wilsoni , the
name a compliment to Mr. Wilson.
Species of Koklass Pheasants are found in this district. There is I
Pucrasia xanthospila , a woodland bird which was not uncommon.
Here is another instance of a bird unknown in our aviaries, although
the Indian Koklass is not so rare in confinement as it was a few
years ago, and this Pheasant is reared both in Great Britain, Eire,
France, and Belgium.
In parts of Western Hupeh and Western Szechuan " that

temmincki ) is found. It lives in woody and shrub-clad country, on
steep mountain slopes covered with vegetation and is therefore
most difficult to find (that is splendid news !). As my readers will
know, it is similar in plumage to the Satyr Tragopan, but it is
worth while giving a description so that it may be distinguished
from the more common (I refer to aviary life) Satyr Tragopan of
the same genus. Male : plumage of the upper parts of the body is
dark brown crimson spotted with small whitish spots ; breast,
Indian red, blotched with grey ; crown, rufous-crimson ; ears and
lower eye-patch, indigo blue with flesh-coloured markings ; tail,
short and broad. That is a remarkably good description of this
Tragopan by the author. The natives regard the Temminck's as
a bird of good omen, bringing good luck to their lucky owners
and long life. The Temminck's is undeniably hardier than the
Satyr of India and one can assert with confidence that it will
prove easier to establish in our aviaries than the Satyr. The latter
has been imported in great numbers for the past twenty years,
yet it cannot be said to be established, whereas the Temminck's,
although still expensive and difficult to possess, is yearly becoming
easier to obtain, despite the fact that it is never imported from
Ghina. It is only to be hoped that this magnificent Pheasant
will be imported in some numbers after the war ; the present
available stock will not ensure establishment in our aviaries and
fresh blood is necessary wherewith to propagate this noble species
of the Pheasant family.
In the provinces of Fokhien and Kiangsu is found the Cabot's
Tragopan ( Temm . caboti ). Little mention is made of this species
in this book. This Pheasant, although perhaps not so beautiful
as the last named, is indeed lovely and we can only hope that it
will be imported when times are better. There are a few isolated
specimens in Great Britain, but I believe the only true pair exists
at Mr. Spedan Lewis' place at Leckford. There is certainly one
pair at Cleres, in France, and Monsieur Malisoux possesses one
specimen.
It is strange that the only species of Crossoptilon that Mr. Wilson
observed in his travels was the very rare White (C. tibetanus ),
the more common Blue and Brown evidently do not occur in the
districts visited by him. The White Crossoptilon is very rare in
captivity. I do not know of any specimens in Great Britain, but

P. J. LAMBERT-PHEASANTS OF WESTERN CHINA
there are one or two pairs at Cleres, in France, and it is to be hoped
they will breed. There are certainly at least two pairs in California.
Finally, mention is made of the Monaul Pheasant, and this is,
of course, the Chinese of the species (Lophophorus Ihuysi ). According
to Mr. Wilson it is the rarest and also the most gorgeous of all
Pheasants found in China. I am told it is even more resplendent
than the Indian Monaul, which is saying quite a lot ! In actual
plumage it is not unlike the Indian, but it is much larger ; further
than that I cannot vouch for, as I have never seen a specimen,
alive or stuffed. The Chinese call this bird Hoa-t'an che, which
means " The Burning Charcoal Chicken ". That interpretation
gives one a wonderful impression of the scintillating plumage of
the neck feathers in particular. A bulb known as " pei-mu " is
the favourite food, and this fact reminds us that the Monaul seeks
all its food by digging with its upper mandible. One should
remember this fact when dealing with Monauls in our aviaries.
We cannot supply bulbs for their use, but a little ingenuity will
give them useful and natural exercise.
There are other species of Pheasants in China, but they do
not receive mention in this book for obvious reasons.
Our interest in all Pheasants that come from China should
be intensified, for we must realize that supplies from that country
will be small, if not entirely curtailed. These facts (for facts they are)
should stimulate us to do all in our power to cause all Chinese
Pheasants to propagate their species. By our efforts alone many
species of beautiful Pheasants may be handed down to posterity.
Failing such efforts many of these birds will most assuredly be lost
for ever. When peace once more spreads its benevolent wings over
Europe and the Far East, surely the O.P.S. should make strenuous
efforts to import some of the rare Pheasants--it may be our last
chance.

By C. L. Sibley
For the sixth consecutive year the Philadelphia Game Bird Show
was held in connection with the Sportsmen's and Motorboat Show
at the huge Commercial Museum in Philadelphia. Under the
management of Mr. J. Allen Gardy, publisher of Modern Game
Breeding , the show has grown from a small beginning to the large
and comprehensive one of the present year, probably the largest
show of game and ornamental fowl ever held in America, and
possibly anywhere.
Beautifully penned in large, specially built pens, and situated
in a part of the great hall very favourably disposed for lighting,
the thousands of visitors were greatly interested in the large displays
of ornamental and shooting (or " game ") Pheasants, Ornamental
Ducks, Geese, and Swans, Quail and Partridges, Peafowl and Wild
Turkeys.
" Game " Pheasants were shown in pens of one cock and
four hens. In these classes were shown three pens of Chinese, eight
pens of Mongolians, five pens of Formosans, four pens of Black-
necks, seven pens of Melanistic Mutants, and six pens of the common
hybrid so-called " English " Ringnecks, so much used for stocking
in this country. This made the large total of thirty-three pens of
shooting Pheasants shown, a total of 165 birds. And it may be said
that breeders of shooting Pheasants have become so conscious
during the last few years of the advantages of pure-bred types of
Pheasants for use in varying conditions of terrain and cover, that
among the twenty-seven pens of pure-bred Pheasants shown (for
we must exclude the six pens of common hybrid Ringnecks),
not a really poor pen was to be found. This made the work of the
judges most arduous, but so far as one could see from the outside
the pens selected for prizes deserved their winnings.
Champion game Pheasant pen was won by a splendid team of
Chinese Pheasants. The winning pens of Mongolians, Blacknecks,
Formosans, and Mutants were very close indeed to the winning
Chinese pen, and it must have been a close decision for the judges
in selecting the Chinese. Notable this year was the excellence and

uniformity of the forty Mongolians entered. They demonstrated
by their appearance the careful breeding and purity of their blood-
lines. The winning pen of Formosans was excellent, light in colour,
but not lacking the brick-red breast and beautiful light blue rump
of the pure Formosan. Mutants were extremely uniform in colour-
ing, size, disposition, and station, showing that this genetic mutation
has been in the hands of excellent breeders who have refined it to
its original genetic purity, after being allowed to deteriorate through
careless cross-breeding with other Phasianus stocks in the coverts
where it appeared. Blacknecks showed much uniformity, and were
a great improvement over some shown in the past, demonstrating
again the interest in breeding pure-bred races of shooting Pheasants.
In this country the Versicolor is classed as an aviary or " orna-
mental ", and not as a shooting species, so we shall consider it
among the " ornamentals ".
Ornamental Pheasants were shown in pairs. Of these twenty-
four pairs were shown in the following species : Golden, Lady
Amherst, Silver, Reeves, Cheer, Elliott's, Blue Manchurian Eared,
Brown Manchurian Eared, Swinhoe, Nepal, Versicolor. Also
shown in this class was a mutation from some species or hybrid of
Phasianus , called, from the name of the breeder in whose flock
it arose, " Van Burens." These are said to breed true to colour
over succeeding generations. They are an attractive shade of
greyish fawn with rather indistinct markings. Showing, perhaps,
that Nature tends to produce mutations to certain colour patterns
in particular species, is the fact that in 1939 when Professor
Allesandro Ghigi, of the University of Bologna was in America, the
writer showed him some specimens of the " Van Buren " Pheasant,
and after looking at them carefully, Professor Ghigi declared them
identical with a mutation which he had observed as long ago
as 1893.
One was struck with the fact that nearly all the Pheasants shown
were in splendid plumage, a tribute to the care taken in crating and
transporting them to the show. The winners in Golden and Lady
Amherst were excellent birds, without any trace of hybrid ancestry.
Winners in the ornamental classes were nearly all very high quality
birds. Reeves were a bit disappointing in that of those shown the
top winners lacked the deep golden orange colour and brilliant
black markings of some which were placed lower, but were placed
on condition, which was excellent.

One could wish that more of the less common sorts were shown :
Mikado, Impeyan, Edwards, Imperial, Firebacks, the Tragopans,
White Eared, Peacock Pheasants, etc., but it is understandable
that exhibitors might hesitate to crate and ship these rarer sorts
during frigid winter weather. At the same time they would add
greatly to an exhibition of this sort. Notable was the fact that three
excellent pairs of the Blue Eared Pheasants were shown, while
only one pair of the Brown species was on exhibition. The Blue
has proven so prolific that from the single importation brought in
by the late Floyd Smith in 1932, the species has gotten to be one
of those included in nearly every American Pheasant collection,
even the most modest. A pair of Blue Eared Pheasants won the
award for best ornamental Pheasants in the show, a well deserved
award.
The display of ornamental Ducks and Geese was excellent,
with the following species shown : Mallard, Black Duck, Pintail,

<bodyText confidence="0.995908823529412" page_id="56314509"  page_num="215" year="" vol="">
Swans were also shown. A splendid pair of Lesser Snow Geese
won the award for best pair of waterfowl, a placing well deserved.
Many of the Ducks and Geese were displayed in a large pool,
where they played and disported themselves with entire disregard
for the hundreds of people crowded about their enclosure at all
times. There is a great fascination about a display of ornamental
waterfowl, which seems to attract those who understand them and
those to whom they are only a spectacle and it is to be hoped that
more people with the means and facilities for keeping waterfowl
on their estates will start collections of ornamental waterfowl
when the nations of the world can get back to normal living.
Strangely, for the first time in several years, no species of
the " Quail " family was shown other than our own American Bob
White. Competition in these classes was keen, with the winning pair
excellent in size, colour, and condition.
Partridges were represented only by six pairs of Chukars and
two pairs of Hungarians. All were splendid birds and put down in

excellent condition and awarding places on these must have taxed
the skill of the judges.
Peafowl were shown in Blue, with its White and Blackwinged or
Black-shouldered varieties. No Greens were shown this year,
although they have been in evidence at most of the other Game
Bird Shows.
As regards the variety called variously : Blackwinged, Black-
shouldered, Japanned, etc., it is interesting to note that Elliott in
his beautifully illustrated Monograph of the Pheasants , published in
1872, shows an excellent picture of the variety, and remarks that it
bred true to colour,, even at that early date. There can be no doubt
that this variety is a pure genetic mutation from the Indian Blue
Peacock, for every now and then it has arisen in flocks of Blues,
and if the mutations are bred together they reproduced themselves
100 per cent in their offspring, with no further throwback to the Blue
species ( cristatus ), from which they sprung. An amusing idea has
become current in some places because of the name " Japanned ",
sometimes applied to them and referring to the brilliant iridescent
black colour of the wings of the adult male. Because of this name
one now and then sees the statement that the variety is native to
Japan. As a matter of truth the only Peafowl in Japan are those
which have been imported there by man for ornamental purposes,
and the Blackwinged variety was known in Europe long before
Western nations had access to Japanese ports.
One of the outstanding exhibits in any American game bird
show should be our finest native American game bird, the Wild
Turkey. Heretofore exhibits in this class have been few, one or two
pairs, perhaps. This year six different exhibitors entered pairs of
Wild Turkeys, reflecting the growing interest in this excellent native
game bird for stocking suitable covers which have been depleted.
The first prize pair were most excellent birds and might very
well have been wild-trapped birds from the few inaccessible haunts
of the Wild Turkey now remaining in this country. Slim, nervous,
racy appearing birds of medium size, with long, slender red legs,
snaky blue heads, never still for a moment, they were outstanding
examples of the north-eastern type of the American Wild Turkey.
None of the other exhibits came close to them in quality, although
in one pair a most excellent hen was shown, while in another pair,
a superior old cock was shown. In this connection it might be well

to say that in showing Wild Turkeys exhibitors would do well to
show young birds, rather than birds two years old or more. In
captivity, with less than the usual amount of exercise and more
liberal feeding than is the rule in the wild, older Wild Turkeys
tend to put on weight and to coarsen up on head points somewhat,
so that when exhibited against young birds of the year they appear
at a disadvantage. Wild Turkeys reared in captivity tend to become
more or less tame, although if of pure wild stock never lose the
nervous, alert manner and carriage so characteristic of the species
in the wild. This was evidenced in the splendid pair of birds
which won the blue at the Game Bird Show.
In summing up the show one must congratulate the twenty-six
exhibitors from twelve states (Pennsylvania, New York, North
Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Delaware, Connecti-
cut, Florida, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Mississippi), on the
high excellence of the 363 birds shown in fifty-two species and
varieties of Pheasants, Waterfowl, Quail, Partridges, Wild Turkeys,
and Peafowl. Also to Modern Game Breeding (magazine) and its
editor, Mr. J. Allen Gardy, who sponsored and directed the show,
sincere congratulations on a splendid show well conceived and
executed. To anyone interested in ornamental or game birds and
wildfowl, 26th February to 2nd March, 1940, will be remembered
as the dates of the finest exposition of these species yet held in
America. One hopes that each succeeding year will show increased
excellence in the show and its exhibits, but if so, it will seem, after
the excellent show of this year, almost like " gilding the lily ".

The President of the O.P.S.
Though the President of the O.P.S., Monsieur Jean Delacour, is for the
moment cut off from his colleagues in England, there is no doubt that he will
endeavour to get into communication with them at the earliest possible oppor-
tunity. In the meantime his greatest wish certainly would be that everything
possible should be done to keep the Society alive till better days dawn and it
can be renewed with its old vigour. Also with the loss of the valuable collections
in France and Belgium it has become even more important that every effort
should be made to maintain a representative stock of Pheasants in other countries.

I think most people have found their Pheasants did not lay so freely this year,
probably owing to the trying winter. Tragopans did only moderately with
us and the chicks are not as good as before. Imperials laid freely but their
eggs were clear; fresh blood is badly wanted. Bulwers' Pheasants raised
our hopes by displaying and occupying their nests, but nothing came of it, and
we console ourselves by looking forward to next year. They are very wild, shy
birds, and are only now beginning to quiet down after a full year of aviary life.
Palawans did well, ten chicks from two pairs of adults, Edwards and Mikados
bred freely as usual ; we have two Reinhart's Argus chicks and a Copper
Pheasant.

Editor.'s Note.
The issue of the present special Pheasant number of the Avicultural
Magazine was decided upon early in the year. The original intention was for
a French in addition to the English edition ; with the sudden invasion of Belgium
this idea had to be abandoned. An article had been promised by Professor
Ghigi, but this failed to arrive in time. Further, an article on the Black Kalij
Pheasant, by the Marquis Hachisuka, accompanied by a coloured plate, presented
by him, was also intended for inclusion ; but owing to a disaster at sea near Japan,
the plates are now at the bottom of the ocean. It is hoped, however, to publish
the article and the plate, which the Marquis Hachisuka is having reprinted, in
a later number of the Magazine.

I have been much interested in watching the Mexican Ocellated Turkey cock
displaying to his wives. He is a truculent gentleman and when he feels that
way has no hesitation in attacking anyone entering his pen. He kicks with all
his might and can deliver a hefty one. When displaying he first stands open-
beaked and gobbles, then squats half-spreading his wings and strikes the ground
with them, at the same time he raises his tail and wags it from side to side. After
a few minutes he rises and struts to and fro, puffing out his breast feathers until
they look like a housemaid's feather brush. His wives gather round him and
meekly await his pleasure. He has nine poults to his credit. Has the Ocellated
Turkey been bred before in England ?
Our Radjah Sheld-duck laid eleven eggs, ten of which produced healthy ducklings
on the i oth May, lively black and white mites which throve and grew very quickly.
They have feathered and are quite able to hold their own with the rest of the
duckery. Ashy-headed, Ruddy-headed, Blue Snow, Ross's Snow, and Great
Snow Geese have all bred, and a Red-breasted Goose has two sturdy youngsters.
Besides these we have bred one Red Shoveler, five Cape Teal, five Black-billed

(Munia flaviprymna)
By David Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
This species was described by Gould in 1845 f rom a single
specimen obtained by Dr. Bynoe during the surveying voyage
of the Beagle in 1839. It is uncertain what became of the
type specimen, but another, secured by J. R. Elsie, was the only
example in the British Museum or elsewhere in Great Britain
until 1904 when a single living specimen was sent to the present
writer by Mr. H. E. Pier, of Sydney, N.S.W., with the request
that it should be exhibited at the Crystal Palace Show which took
place in October of that year. It was hardly to be expected that
the judge or anyone else would recognize the bird and it is not
surprising that it was only awarded a second prize and that most
people regarded it as a hybrid of which one parent was a Chestnut-
breasted Finch. At the " Great National " show, held at the same
place the following January, it took the first prize in its class as
well as the special prize for the rarest bird in the show.
A few examples of this hitherto almost unknown bird were
trapped in North-West Australia early in 1904. A pair went to
the Melbourne Zoological Gardens and seven more were secured
by Mr. Pier, one of which was the bird mentioned above. In 1905
those enterprising collectors, Messrs. Payne and Wallace, captured
a number and the species became well known to British aviculturists.
In 1907 I had in my own collection nine examples of M.
flaviprymna and noticed that one or two of them were commencing

to develop distinct variation in plumage, the throat becoming
darker and traces of a pectoral band appearing. They were,
in fact, developing in the direction of their near relative, M.
castaneothorax , the Chestnut-breasted Finch. Mr. Goodchild made
a series of careful drawings showing the change that was taking
place, and these were published in this Magazine for May, 1907.
M. flaviprymna is much more of a desert form than M. castaneothorax ,
as may be judged from its sandy cbloured plumage and, according
to Messrs. Payne and Wallace, " only appears in parts where the
latter congregate during extremely dry seasons." It would appear
that the one is a desert form of the other, and when kept in the
humid climate of Europe, has a tendency to revert to the more
common type, though many examples show no inclination in this
direction.
Mr. W. E. Teschemaker was the first to breed M. flaviprymna
in this country ( Avicultural Magazine , February, 1907). He believed
that the two forms were distinct species and that those examples j
of M. flaviprymna that developed dark markings were wild hybrids.
If this is so, the fact that the two readily interbreed when they meet
would indicate their very close affinity and tend to prove that
the two forms are local races of the same species.
With Mr. Teschemaker the Yellow-rumps built their nest
in a box after the manner of the majority of Australian Finches,
and it was noticed that the parents fed their young on insect food,
for which they were seen searching all day long and even hawking
for flies. He saw as many as six gentles carried to the nest at one
time. He found that the Chesnut-breasted Finch also was purely
insectivorous during the nesting season.
Mr. Teschemaker describes the young flaviprymna as " a little
bird whose head, throat, back, and tail are dark brown, chest dull
grey with a short stumpy beak, dark horn-colour with white warts
at the angles ". On leaving the nest " they are fed like young
Zebra Finches, standing beside the parent and twisting their heads
round ; not fluttering their wings ". A week after leaving the
nest they are described as " all buff except a patch (light brown)
on back of neck and some primaries. Head and cheeks streaky ".

A TRIP TO NORTH QUEENSLAND
By Alan Lendon, F.R.C.S., Adelaide, Soudi Australia
The trip about to be described principally from an avicultural
and ornithological viewpoint was undertaken in August, 1939,
and occupied nearly four weeks. It comprised a rail journey
from Adelaide to Sydney, and thence by the Adelaide Steamship
Company's s.s. Manoora to Cairns where five days were spent.
The return trip was by the same ship to Melbourne and on to
Adelaide by train.

<bodyText confidence="0.99813172" page_id="56314521"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
On arrival in Melbourne the weather was very unpromising,
but, undeterred, a friend and I set off for the Sir Colin Mackenzie
Sanctuary at Healesville, about 40 miles by road from Melbourne.
Fortunately for us the weather improved as we neared our
destination and apart from one heavy shower remained reasonably
fine while we were there. On the way the only birds of interest
noted were a few White (Sulphur-crested) Cockatoos ( Kakatoe
galerita) feeding in a paddock by the roadside. On arrival at the
Sanctuary one immediately heard the tinkling note of the Bell
Miner ( Manorhina melanophrys) and these rather inconspicuous
greenish birds were seen and heard throughout the enclosure.
Also about the Sanctuary, obtaining an easy living from the grain
used to feed the various captive birds and animals, were large
numbers of King Parrots (Aprosmictus scapularis) and Crimson
Rosellas (Platycercus elegans ), the former being particularly tame.
There were also a few Pied Currawongs or Pied Crow Shrikes
(Strepera graculina) about and they, too, were particularly fearless,
which is not usually the case with the common South Australian
species, the Black-winged ( S . melanoptera) . Smaller birds noted
were small flocks of the Red-browed Finch ( AEgintha temporalis)
and a number of White-browed Scrub Wrens ( Sericornis frontalis ).
Of the birds in captivity the outstanding exhibit was a
magnificent pair of Superb Lyre Birds ( Menura nova-hollandire)
housed in a very large aviary erected over natural tree fern scrub.
When seen they had been in captivity about nine months, were

in excellent condition and were becoming very tame, especially
the female. Other interesting exhibits were a Powerful Owl
(,JVinox strenua), several Winking Owls (jV. connivens) , one pair of
which had laid the previous spring, and a fine Yellow-tailed
Black Cockatoo {Calyptorhynchus funereus) . There was also a very
fine collection of Australian mammals at the Sanctuary, including
three specimens of the Platypus, but I will not digress, this article
being written for aviculturists. My friend and I felt that we could
easily have spent much longer there, Mr. David Fleay, the curator,
being extremely kind to us and giving us much of his time, but we
had to return to Melbourne to allow me to catch the Sydney
express that evening.
Sydney
Arriving early next morning, I lost no time in revisiting
Sydney's magnificent Zoo, Taronga Park. One could easily devote
a whole article to the collection of birds in the Park ; there are
a great number of species exhibited and they are mostly very well
housed and displayed but I do not think they reach the standard
of the Adelaide Zoo, either in the number of species exhibited
or in the quality, shall I say, of some of the best exhibits. In this
article, which is largely concerned with birds observed in Queens-
land, one can only pick on those which caught the eye and mention
them. On entering at the top gate, the first exhibit to attract
my attention was a fine pair of Black-necked Swans ( Cygnus
melanocoriphus ) probably the only ones in Australia, and in the
same enclosure, but not labelled, were a pair of Ducks with which
I was not familiar but which I subsequently identified as the
White-winged Wood Duck ( Asarcornis scutulata). Another Duck to
attract my attention was a fine male Australian White-eyed Duck
(,JVyroca australis ), a bird which I had only seen in captivity once
before, although I have seen very large flocks of them in the wild
state.
There was a very fine display of Cranes of about eight to ten
species, a flock of some twenty or thirty Flamingoes, of two different
species said to be the European and the Chilean, and a unique
collection of Cassowaries of, I think, five distinct species.
Of the Parrot family, I was particularly taken with four Blue

Bonnets ( Psephotus hcematogaster) of the red-vented subspecies
(Juematorrhous) , easily the most brilliantly coloured examples I had
seen of this subspecies which is comparatively rare, at any rate in
captivity. There were six specimens of the pretty little Fijian
Lorikeet ( Phigys solitarius ) but the flock of about a dozen Indigo
Lorikeets (Coriphilus taitianus) that I had seen previously, had
dwindled to two. There are three examples of the striking Pesquet's
Parrot (Dasyptilus pesqueti), three or four fine Fijian Shining Parrots
(Pyrrhulopsis sp.) ; a number of the true Moustache Parrots
(.Palceorius fasciata ), not the Javan (P. alexandri) which is much
commoner in captivity in Australia, and several relatively rare
Lorikeets such as Forsten's ( Trichoglossus forsteni) and the Green-
naped (T. cyanogrammus) . Of the Cockatoos, there was a fine old
male Banksian (Calyptorhynchus banksi) ; a number of Gang-gangs
( Callocephalon Jimbriatum), mostly in very fine plumage, a Blue-eyed
(Kakatoe ophthalmica) and several Ducorps' (K. ducorpsi) ; whilst
among the Macaws were three fine Hyacinthine (Anodorhynchus
hyacinthinus ).
Other exhibits which caught the eye were two Hornbills
(I think the Concave-casqued) in very fine condition and plumage,
a Great Bower Bird ( Chlamydera nuchalis ), either female or immature
as it lacked the lilac ruff, several Hunting Cissas ( Cissa chinensis)
and a small flock of the attractive little White-headed Stilt
(Himantopus leucocephalus). The collection of Birds of Paradise
had dwindled somewhat since my previous visit but there were
still several fine specimens. Wild birds noted in the gardens were
the introduced Bulbul (Otocompsa jocosa ) and the Yellow Robin
(.Eopsaltria australis ).
Brisbane
Arriving in Brisbane, my first visit was to the Botanical Gardens
where a few monkeys and other animals and a small collection of
birds are kept. The outstanding exhibits amongst the birds were

two Salmon-crested Cockatoos (Kakatoe moluccensis) , one Blue-eyed
Cockatoo (K. ophthalmica ), one Kea (Nestor notabilis) , one Glossy
Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus ) in magnificent plumage, a pair of Kagus
(Rhynchaetos jubatus ), a Crowned Crane (Balearica sp.), a Stanley
Crane (Tetrapteryx paradisea) and a pair of Green Peacocks (Pavo

spiciferus). There were a number of small birds but the only ones
of interest were a pair of small Bulbul-like birds, greenish above
and yellowish below, with a black head and a little orange-red
on the throat, which I have not been able to identify to date.
The same afternoon I paid a visit to the Lone Pine Koala
Park and Zoo on the Brisbane River, where the only birds to
particularly attract my attention were a nice pair of Red-sided
Eclectus (Lorius pedoralis) , almost certainly the New Guinea form.
At this spot and on the way there and back I noticed a few interesting
birds, namely the Rufous Whistler ( Pachycephala rufiventris) which
was calling on the banks of the river, and a pair of Lorikeets,
almost certainly the Scaly-breasted ( Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus)
which flew very swiftly overhead. The Black-faced Cuckoo-Shrike
(Coracina nbva-hollandia) was very numerous and appeared to be
feeding largely on wild figs, but the Southern Figbird ( Sphecotheres
vielloti ), said to be plentiful around Brisbane, I did not see. Another
bird which was not uncommon in the suburbs was a Kingfisher,
which I am fairly certain was the Forest (. Halcyon made ay i) .
On the second day spent in Brisbane I visited Mr. Fred Smith,
who lives at a rather ungetatable place called The Gap on the
outskirts of the town and who is a very well known veteran
aviculturist. His collection at the time of my visit was considerably
depleted but he had two fine Paradise Rifle Birds ( Ptiloris paradiseus ),
neither of which was in colour, and a number of Red-headed
Parrot Finches (Ery thrum psittacea) which were breeding freely.
On inquiring about the Paradise Parrot ( Psephotus pulcherrimus ),
Mr. Smith informed me that up to the beginning of this century
they could nearly always be obtained in the Brisbane bird shops
for about $s. a pair, but that they had then disappeared and he
had not seen them since !
The same day I made a search of the city for bird shops and
managed to locate most of them but they had very little of interest
to offer, mostly the Parrots and Finches which are commonly found
locally such as the Cockatiel ( Leptolophus hollandicus) , King Parrot

(.Aprosmictus scapularis) , Crimson-winged Parrot (A. erythropterus ),
Crimson, Mealy, and Eastern Rosellas (. Platycercus elegans , P. adscitus

modesta ), Chestnut-breasted ( Munia castaneothorax) , Double-bar
(Steganopleura bichenovii) and Gouldian ( Poephila gouldm ). It was

interesting to note that the Eastern Rosellas were all of the golden-
man tied subspecies ( splendidus ) and further that the adult females
frequently had a number of yellow feathers mixed with the red
ones on the head, a point which Gould illustrated in his Birds of
Australia , but which I have never seen referred to elsewhere.
Further, the Crimson Rosellas, though obviously immature birds,
were all in a dull red plumage and from inquiries made, it would
appear probable that the green immature form does not occur in
the northern part of the range.
Townsville
Arriving in Townsville early in the morning, I was for a time
unable to identify a large strikingly coloured bird flying around
the harbour ; it proved to be the Red-backed Sea-eagle (Haliastur
indus), which I saw again several times later. On the morning
of arrival in Townsville, I went by launch to Magnetic Island
but was disappointed in the bird life there, the only interesting
birds seen being a Friar Bird ( Tropidorhynchus corniculatus) and the
only Sunbird ( Cyrtostomus frenatus) seen on the trip, unfortunately
a female. Several Pigeons or Doves were heard but could not be
seen in the dense foliage.
The same afternoon I visited the Mount St. John Bird Sanctuary
and Zoo which proved to be my idea of a bird-lover's paradise.
It is situated about five miles out of the city of Townsville and
on the way there and back quite a number of birds were observed.
The Peaceful Dove ( Geopelia placida) was extremely plentiful in the
streets of the town as also was the introduced Indian Myna
(Acridotheres tristis). The Magpie-Lark ( Grallina cyanoleucd) was
very common in the open country as also was the Pied Butcher-Bird
(Cradieus nigrogularis) , but the Black-backed Magpie (Gymnorhina
tibicen) was comparatively rare. Grows ( Corvus sp.) were in large
numbers and so were several species of small hawks particularly
the Nankeen Kestrel ( Cerchneis cenchroides) . As around Brisbane,
Kingfishers were frequently observed sitting on the telegraph wires
and a number of Zebra Finches ( Taeniopygia castanotis) were seen
on the roadsides. An interesting bird, new to me, was the Black-
faced Wood-Swallow (. Artamus melanops), a close relative of the

familiar Dusky Wood Swallow (A. cyanopterus) of the south and
with similar habits.
The Mount St. John Zoo is situated on a slight rise with a
fair-sized lagoon which dries up each year on one side, and a large
permanent swamp covering several hundred acres on the other.
There is quite a good collection of animals and birds kept in the
Zoo, those which took my eye being a fine pair of Australian
Bustards ( Eupodotis australis ), very rare in captivity, several Blue-
winged Kookaburras ( Dacelo leachi) which were being visited by
a wild one, a fine White Goshawk ( Astur novce-hollandice) , two
Banksian Cockatoos ( Calyptorhynchus banksi ), a male Argus Pheasant
(.Argusianus argus) in very fine plumage, and several Tawny Frog-
mouths ( Podargus strigoides) , one of which was quite a fawn colour,
very different to the greyish tones of the southern form. There
were also quite a number of waterfowl kept on a small lake in
the Zoo enclosure but most, if not all, of the species will be described
in dealing with the wild birds of the Sanctuary, with which I shall
now proceed.
As I entered the Zoo, I noticed a large flock of Ducks on the
shore of the lagoon which, on investigation, proved to be the rare
Plumed or Eyton's Tree-Duck ( Dendrocygna eytoni), I thought they
numbered about five hundred, but Mr. Robinson estimated the
flock as about a thousand ! The only other bird noticed on the
lagoon was a single Jabiru ( Xenorhynchus asiaticus) which looked
very stately and solemn. Crossing over to the big swamp I was
absolutely amazed by the quantity and variety of the bird life
on and around the water. Very striking were the large flocks of
Magpie Geese ( Anseranas semipalmata) mostly quite tame and many
obviously immature. There were a few Black Swans ( Chenopsis
atrata) and Pelicans ( Pelecanus conspicillatus) and plenty of Black
Duck (Anas superciliosa) and Grey Teal ( Querquedula gibberifrons ),
and Mr. Robinson also pointed out to me small flocks of Whistling
Tree-Duck (. Dendrocygna arcuata) and White-quilled Pigmy-Goose
(Nettapus coromandelianus) , neither of which were we able to approach
closely. Other birds noted were numerous White-fronted Herons
(Notophoyx nova-hollandia) , a few of the attractive White-necked
Heron (JV. pacifica), two species of Egret (Egretta sp.), a fine flock
of some twenty Royal Spoonbills ( Platalea regia) , a number of the
quaint Darters (Anhinga nova-hollandire) , Eastern Swamp-hens

kiornis molucca and Carphihis spinicollis) . Two birds new to me were
the Masked Plover ( Lobibyx miles), closely related to the southern
Spurwing Plover (L. novce-hollandia) and the interesting little
Jacana or Lily-Trotter ( Irediparra gallinacea) . Dotted around the
swamp were some dozen or so Brolgas or Australian Cranes
(.Megalornis rubicundus) and when I expressed my pleasure at seeing
so many of these fine birds in the wild state, Mr. Robinson said
he would drive me a few miles to another swamp where we might
see a few more ! This he did and on arrival I was amazed to see
countless hundreds of these beautiful birds feeding very quietly
only a very short distance from us ; truly something never to be
forgotten, as indeed was the whole visit to the Sanctuary.

We have now finished the Passeres , and before going on to
the larger birds we may note that Latham obviously knew the
earliest British book on cage-birds, Eleazar Albin's Song-birds , 1737,
with several editions and copies up to the end of the century and
after. Latham also refers to Bewick (1753-1828) as his authority
for some of his cage-bird notes. It is interesting that both these
early writers only mention one foreign bird (except the Canary) ;
this is the Red Cardinal.
CUCKOOS. Latham mentions about 6 of these commencing
with the Common one, of which he writes that young ones " are
now and then brought up tame from the nest and in this state
become very familiar, eating bread and milk, eggs, insects and
flesh, either dressed or raw ; and I remember one that remained
in a cage the whole year, but how much longer, I did not learn 55

EASTERN BLACK CUCKOO (one of the Koels) the LONG-
BILLED RAIN-CUCKOO, C: vetula. Linn., and the BRAZILIAN
CRESTED CUCKOO (i.e. the Guira Cuckoo of South America).
The last is described as "a sedentary bird and easily becomes
domestic ; one has been kept in a cage and fed with raw meats "
(in, 283, 313, 319). The ANIS. (Greater and Lesser) are dealt
with in Vol. ii (p. 33J) and " are said to be easily made tame and
learn to talk like Parrots. One of them in the collection of Mr.
Mcleay, which came from Berbice, was named Koroebo ". Later
on (p. 339) we find the VARIEGATED ANL, C. varia. Ind. Orn.,
a specimen of which is said to have been kept alive at Versailles
for some time. (What was this ? E.H.)
TOURACOS. Only one of these has cage-bird mention ;
this is the TOURACO D'ABYSSINIE. (ii, 344), several of which
the author had seen alive in England and observed the eye " to
be uncommonly brilliant, the crest always erect and the bird in
general very lively ; the white stripes above and below the eye
were obtained after the first moult, and grapes, apples, oranges,
and other fruits formed the food ". This must be one of the Green
Touracos, probably T. leucotis.
The only mention of KINGFISHERS in captivity is that
" M. Daubenton is said to have kept some in a cage for several
months, by means of small fish put into basins of water, on which
they fed, for they refused all other kinds of nourishment 55 (iv, 36).
Two of the HUMMING BIRDS described in vol. iv, have
some cage-bird mention : under the MANGO (p. 311) we read
that " the circumstance of keeping Humming-birds alive in their
own climate by means of sugar and water is well authenticated,
and the following fact is also well attested. A young Gentleman,
a few days before he sailed from Jamaica for England, met with
a female Humming-bird sitting on the nest and eggs, and cutting
off the twig, he brought all together on board. The bird became
sufficiently tame, so as to suffer herself to be fed with honey and
water during the passage, and hatched two young ones. The
mother, however, did not long survive, but the young were brought
to England, and continued for some time in the possession of
Lady Hamond. . . . These little creatures readily took honey from
the lips of Lady H. with their bills ; one did not live long, but
the other survived at least two months from the time of their

arrival ".- The other Humming-bird mentioned is the RED-
THROATED, T. colibris. Linn., which has " been preserved alive
for several weeks, ... by feeding them with honey dissolved in
water ", and there is a footnote to say that a General Davies
kept some three months and others for shorter periods (presumably
in their own country). Nowadays of course Humming-birds are
kept for years on the " Nectar Food " (i.e. Nestle's or Horlicks) ;
as a past master at this our President is pre-eminent.
One BEE-EATER, the PHILIPPINE B., is said to be sometimes
caught alive, but to seldom survive long as they feed only on the
wing and on living insects ( iv , 130 ).
Hornbills
Half a dozen are mentioned as possible pets in their own
countries, but apparently the author knew no case of importation
to Europe. The RHINOCEROS HORNBILL (m, 3 o 5 ) " is tamed
without much difficulty, and in this state as well as when at large,
will chase rats and mice . . ." The UNICORN HORNBILL {312)
is kept in Ceylon to kill rats and mice and at this surpasses any
cat. The GREEN-WINGED HORNBILL (i.e. Anthracoceros
coronatus (. Bodd )). " Ceylon. . . . One brought to the Cape . . . was
kept tame in a menagerie, and observed to be affable towards the
keeper, but so ferocious towards the rest of the birds in the aviary,
as to completely keep them in awe, however much larger than
himself; yet with all this audacity, he would not suffer any
quarrels among others, and always interfered between the
combatants, ending the conflict by beating both parties. He was
fed indiscriminately with flesh, raw or cooked, and was equally
fond of boiled grain" (313). The BLACK-BILLED and RED-

Tinian and Pulotimoen, and was kept alive on board ship " for
a time. (What was this ? E. H.)
Toucans
Are described as " easily tamed (ii, 281 ), if brought up young
. . . (some) have been brought alive to England, and seemed to
suffer merely from the coldness of the climate, for every sort of
food appeared to satisfy them. Fruits of all kinds, bread and even
flesh and fish without distinction ; but whatever they took was
swallowed whole, first taking it in the bill, then giving the morsel
a toss upwards, immediately caught it again and gulped it down,
without even the slightest compression " ( 281 ). Two species are
separately mentioned, the PREACHER TOUCAN, R. picatus ,
as " easily tamed, and in that state will eat almost anything. . . .
One . . . seemed more fond of grapes than other fruit ; for being
plucked from the stalk and tossed to it, the bird would most

that " Dr. Plot mentions one that was found within two miles
of Oxford in 1664, which we suspect to be a bird escaped from
confinement ". The other is the BRAZILIAN TOUCAN,
R. piscivorus , Linn. (284), one of which Edwards saw alive in London
and there is a note to say that Linnaeus may have seen one feed
on fish in a cage, but that this cannot be taken as a proof that
they do so at large.

In October, 1938, I obtained two pairs of Bearded Tits from
Belgium, through the kindness of Dr. Derscheid, for Mr. E. H.
Wilding of rhododendron fame.
Mr. Wilding died suddenly in the early spring of 1939 and his
son very kindly gave me the Bearded Tits. One pair built a nest
last August, but laid no eggs. During the winter I lost one pair,
the remaining pair came through in good health and at the
beginning of May began to look as though they were going to nest.
On the 15th May they began to build in an open soap tray
hung on the side of their inside shelter, the nest was very deep
and made of last year's leaves of Iris sibirica and reed leaves, lined
with the soft seed heads of reed, and a little horse-hair.
The following are the notes I made :--

On Saturday, 22nd June, the old hen had laid the first egg of
her second clutch in the old nest.
23rd June, saw young bathing for first time.
24th June, young seen feeding themselves, but think they have
been doing so for a day or two, still fed by parents.
24th June, old birds incubating five eggs.
25th June, parents refuse to feed the young, which are managing
very well by themselves.
Both cock and hen take turns in sitting, although both are
tame they are very shy sitters, and leave the nest when one goes
near the aviary.
I had no time to hunt for what I thought would be suitable
food for the young, but managed to keep the parents supplied
with ants' nests, small maggots, and mealworms. In normal times
I should probably have spent a lot of time and trouble trying to
find more suitable food, and not have been so successful !
27th June, I consider young fully reared.
Bearded Tits make charming aviary birds, and are very easy
to keep--mine live on " Anteggo " with a few mealworms daily--
occasionally I give them a little boiled potato or hard boiled egg,
and they have access to seed as a pair of Bullfinches share their
aviary, these latter have two full-grown young from two eggs,
and four young a week old in their second nest. The Bullfinches
have, to my disgust, developed a love for mealworms and ants'
eggs, though they would not look at a mealworm for two years !
3rd July, the two young Bearded Tits full grown and quite
independent. The second clutch should hatch to-day or to-morrow.
Bearded Tits commence incubation with the laying of the
second egg, and the young are sexable almost before they leave
the nest by the colour of the beak. In cocks the beak is yellow
ochre, becoming yellower every day, and in hens blackish brown.
The two young reared in the first nest are a pair, the plumage
of the hen is duller than that of the cock, but this difference was
not apparent until they had left the nest about a fortnight.
My old birds hatched four young in their second nest, the
fifth egg containing a dead chick ; one young one disappeared,
presumably died in the nest and removed by parents, the remaining
three are flying and feeding themselves--two males and one female.
I hope the old birds will moult now. I shall not encourage
any further effort to nest, this season in any case.

{Continued from p. i6y.)
The photograph of the hen Ring Ouzel which appeared in the
July issue of the Avicultural Magazine was taken when she was
building her first nest this season, towards the end of April.
As already stated this nest was forsaken as soon as she had finished
laying her clutch of eggs. On the 8th of May the second nest was
completed and out of five eggs, four youngsters were reared and
to-day (25th July), I noticed these youngsters have just started
to moult into their adult plumage. Even in their immature plumage,
they are quite easy to sex, the cock birds being a clearer black
than the hens, whose flights as well as their breast feathers have
a lot more grey merged into a darker background, if one can so
describe them. When fully matured, however, the cock bird has
a white crescent on the breast extending from the butts of the
wings right across the chest, being about an inch or so wide in
the centre of the chest. The hen bird has also this crescent, but
not of such a pure white.
The first nest that was built was made in a corner of the aviary
which they inhabit, about 6 inches above the ground. The site
was artificially made of heather branches twisted into a bunch,
leaving a wide base in the centre, large enough to hold a nest
comfortably. A small elm sucker was growing just outside the
aviary, and the small branches were trained so that they grew
through the wire, and thereby gave a certain amount of life to
the artificially constructed affair. As I have mentioned before,
this nest was forsaken but within a few days a second nest had
been built on a ledge about 3 feet above the ground, with only
dead bracken, heather, and twigs for cover. It was in this site
the young ones were brought up, on wood ant eggs and gentles
to start with, and afterwards bread and milk, " Saval," ground
pea nuts. As soon as the young ones had left the nest, another
nest was built in the same position as the first and four eggs were
laid, and the parent birds incubated them for another 12 days.
We were afraid the young ones that were flying about would
disturb the sitting parents, but all the time they were there I do

not think they went near the nest at all. Eventually, when they
could fend for themselves, they were taken away and placed in
a large aviary, in which they are flying about to-day.
This third nest was very disappointing because as soon as one
youngster was hatched the parents forsook the lot and it grieved
me as soon as I found out to see one dead young one in the nest
and three eggs chipped with the starved little mites 5 beaks just
showing through.
And, though it is hard to believe, a fourth nest was started ;
but this time in the food box, which consists of a box about a foot
high, 2 feet long, and barely 6 inches wide, on four legs about
30 inches above the ground ! Four more eggs were laid and four
hatched out, but one young one was thrown out on to the ground
when twenty-four hours old. This has since died, but as I write
three sturdy chicks remain almost old enough to ring and doing
well.
Since April to the middle of July eighteen eggs have been
laid by this one hen, and with the exception of those of the first
nest, which were not incubated long enough, all were fertile.
Special mention must be made of the cock bird. He takes
his turn sitting and he certainly does a lot of feeding either to the
hen or the young ones, whether in the nest or flying about. And
even then, if one enters the aviary he finds time to fly at one,
uttering his harsh " tchuck 55 " tchuck 55 , enough to intimidate one.
As with most young birds, if one can get them going for a week
one can be fairly certain that with good luck the worst is over and
success can be more or less assured. The first twenty-four hours in
a young bird&apos;s life is the most critical and every care must be
fostered on the parents to induce them to do their best. The
aviary where the Ring Ouzels reside is in a wood, surrounded
by trees, and an occasional green grub will fall off the boughs
right into the aviary ; and how the male birds will take care, if
one does fall within reach, that the young birds have the delicacy.
The trees have their assets, and also their liabilities, as we have
found out to our cost--but taking it all round, a better position
would be difficult to find. I have taken several photographs of
these birds in order to obtain a permanent record of their activities,
but owing to the faulty light experienced in this position, some
will not reproduce satisfactorily.

By A. H. Scott
I have had a lively season with a mixture of disappointments
and rather exciting successes. Among the successes the most
interesting to me were a new Bullfinch hybrid and a snow-white
Chaffinch. This Bullfinch hybrid is a cross between a British hen
and a Chinese cock. The Chinese cock Bullfinch is quite similar
to the British bird in general form and behaviour, but is larger.
Moreover, while the cheeks are pink, the breast is blue. It is a very
beautiful bird, and I owe the chance of trying this experiment to
the kindness of Miss Knobel, who offered to lend it to me for
the purpose when I admired it at her house several years ago.
During two whole summers this cock took no notice of the hen
Bullfinch allotted to him and this is my usual experience when
I have to deal with any bird that has been kept in a small cage,
even when it is placed in a very large and well planted aviary.
From spring to autumn it mostly sat still, piping all day a rather
maddening little tune : ## One, two, three, one-one, two-two three 55
(a rise of half a tone on the ## twos " and ## two-twos "). Not
being a musician I cannot describe it better. I cannot think this
is the bird's natural song : it sounds to me like a few.notes from
some air that it has been taught.
The third year I gave it a new mate, and though the pair
did not seem much interested in each other a nest was built and
two infertile eggs were laid. A week or two later the hen had a
bad accident and lost a leg. The fourth season, the present one,
I kept the same pair together, and a nest was built in April and
two eggs were laid. My hopes had risen as the cock now seemed
to be really attached. However, a few days after laying the eggs
the hen fell ill and got worse daily, till I gave up hope and put in
another one, which built immediately but did not lay. I was
still hoping for eggs from her when the legless hen which had not
been seen for ten days, and which I thought dead, reappeared,
quite well again, and began to build. The second hen was therefore
removed, and in due course the first hen hatched three strong
young ones on 19th June. The nest was high up, about 9 feet,
and not very accessible, so I removed one youngster to a Canary

where I could observe it closely. Fortunately I had tested the
Bullfinch previously, when she laid the first infertile eggs, by giving
her a young Greenfinch to rear, and knew her to be a good mother
in spite of her physical handicap. I could not see much of the two
young birds under their mother until they left the nest on the
sixteenth day, and even then they kept much in thick bushes,
but I had every opportunity to observe the other. When the
feathers grew on the neck both my bird man and myself thought
it had a tumour until I picked it up for examination. The feathers
spread out sideways from a central line and projected in a very
odd manner. For a week or two the bird presented the most
comic resemblance to a bison ! The same colour, the same small
eye, the large unwieldy front and narrow quarters. Even now,
at four weeks old, " bison " Finch would be a much better name
than " Bullfinch ". The neck feathers, however, have smoothed
out. The hen Canary did not seem to do it very well, so I finally
hand-reared it and have it in a cage. It will be very interesting
to see what colours these young birds will have when they change
their present very dull plumage. One thing that surprises me is
that it started to pipe at the age of nineteen days, an unusually
early age I should think.
The pure white Chaffinch was bred from a very pale yellow
cock (a wild sport) and an ordinary hen. I had a pale yellow
from him two years ago, but lost it after six months. An eye had
been struck out when it fell from its nest as a baby and probably
it was never strong afterwards. I was getting it out of a high-placed
wild Chaffinch nest, where I had put the eggs, when the accident
occurred, for its own mother is untrustworthy. Last year I again
used a wild bird, but it is always a risky business and the foster-
mother was, I believe, killed. Anyhow the young were dead at
two weeks old. One cannot well use Canary fosters for Chaffinches
unless trained to eat ant eggs. This year I have beside this white
bird, four normals (two by a different hen) from the pale yellow
cock. There is therefore enough material to make probable the
founding of a pure white or pale yellow strain. I hope also to mate
some of this stock to my Cinnamon Chaffinches, and to get further
new colours before long. My Cinnamon Chaffinch hen, mated
to her grandson, has brought up six young ones this season, all
Cinnamons, and I now have nine of these beautiful birds. The old

hen is a marvel, for I have had her seven years, and do not know
what her age may have been when purchased. At present she is
as vigorous and ready to breed as any young bird. She did not
breed for the first two seasons and I have been dogged, too, by
very bad luck as regards her nests, but the fault has not been hers,
and at last this cinnamon colour is well established.
The Bullfinches have been a complete failure so far this year.
I bred three cinnamons and lost them all. The first killed itself
instantly at a month old by dashing against a window-pane.
Both the others were neglected by their mothers. By the worst of
luck I had no fosters available at the time. A cinnamon cock
Bullfinch, when bred, should prove to be a bird of great beauty,
but it looks like taking a long time, for the original cinnamon
hen is dead and also one cinnamon which I bred from her two
years ago. Both succumbed to asthma, but I still have two
cinnamon-carrying cocks.
The worst disappointment was my albino Goldfinch. When
bought eighteen months ago it was in a poor state, and as expected
did not breed last year, but this spring I had got her into very
perfect condition, and she went to nest in April. I found, however,
after twelve days only one egg in the nest, and to gain time I put
it under a Canary. It hatched but the Canary proved to be the
one bad one among my fosters and let it die. In her next nest the
Goldfinch hatched four--and let them all die unfed. When her
third nest of five were due I was again horribly unlucky for it was
just the same time when I had no fosters and the cinnamon
Bullfinches were lost. As a last resort I applied to a neighbour,
to whom two years ago I had given some Canaries. She had a
nest just due to hatch, and I substituted the Goldfinch eggs and
hoped for the best. However, her Canary proved to be a non-
feeder and let all the young die in a short time. So out of ten
hatched none survive, and the prospect of albino young is deferred
for two years anyhow. It is a pity ; for this Goldfinch with snow-
white plumage, salmon pink blaze, and gold flights, is most beautiful.
The season has been pretty good for Greenfinches as, in addition
to my usual colours, lutinos, dark and pink-eyed cinnamons, and
dark-eyed yellows, I have now bred a further new shade. This,
in nestling plumage, is a very pale fawn, mottled with very light
green. It has pink eyes. There was a complete absence of chick-

of the many nests of clear eggs (from which I rarely suffer). This
reduced the total numbers, but the proportion of new coloured
birds was very high.

Since this article was written the albino Goldfinch has had a
fourth nest and hatched five more young ones. I had an excellent
Border Canary with young ones three days old, so it was with
good hopes that I removed them and substituted the Goldfinches.
Alas and alack ! This very good mother was annoyed and threw
all the young Goldies out. To hatch fifteen of these much desired
youngsters and rear none would excuse a good round oath.
Both Bullfinches have also nested yet again, and one has
already hatched out two normals and a cinnamon. These I
immediately took by car to Bournemouth where Mr. and Mrs.
Webb, who are famous people in that town, have kindly placed
them under a Canary with one young one of her own. Now I
await the results with hope. Hoping is a large part of bird-breeding,
as we all know.

ORIOLES WHICH HAVE BEEN KEPT

An inquiry from a member asking what Orioles had been kept
in captivity, which had been bred and what books (with coloured
plates if possible) there were on the subject, made me look up the
records, and here are the results, which may be of interest to others
besides my questioner. As regards breeding, the answer is : I know
no case. As regards books there is but little written as to life in
captivity. Neunzig's 4th edition of Russ, 2 volumes, 1913 and 1921,
gives the fullest particulars of more species than is given elsewhere,
and about two pages are given in our first volume of Aviculture,
2nd ed., igj6, and in Delacour's Les Oiseaux, vol. ii, 1934. Older
cage-bird books refer to the Golden Oriole and perhaps one or
two foreign relatives. References to the plates, which I know,
appear under each bird.

E. HOPKINSON-ORIOLES WHICH HAVE BEEN KEPT IN CAPTIVITY 239
The GOLDEN ORIOLE, Oriolus oriolus {Linn) is the occasional
summer visitor to Britain. It is the least rare as a cage-bird, and is
occasionally to be seen at Shows ; like all Orioles, it does not take
kindly to captivity, and usually is not long-lived, but Neunzig
mentions one he knew that lived in a cage for eighteen years,
and I remember one in the more or less public aviaries which
Mr. Gladding had at Burgess Hill, near here, which, arriving in
bad plumage, with rubbed flights and other common Oriole
troubles, was turned into an aviary and lived there at least three
years ; the latter part of its life in perfect condition. I remember
its arrival and looks in 1933, and my thoughts of its not being long
for this world, but it lived till 1936, and I think a year or two
longer, but I never visited the place after 1936. This bird was one
of the Indian race, 0 . 0. kundoo Sykes , which Neunzig says is only
rarely imported, but was .at the London Zoo in 1878, and at a
Berlin Bird Show in 1903. The African race, 0 . 0. auratus , was once
in the Zoo (1925), a bird I brought from the Gambia which lived
there about nine months, and Mr. Webb told me that he brought
one of the South African race, 0 . 0. notatus Peters , for Gamages
in 1930. There are plates of the Golden Oriole in most British
bird-books, a specially good one being that in Keuleman's unfinished
work on Cage-Birds. Plates of kundoo , auratus , and notatus can be
found respectively in Hume and Henderson's Lahore to Yarkand ,
pi. //, Swainson's Birds of West Africa {ii, pi. /), and Ibis , i8yo ,
pi. 7,/. 2.
The ABYSSINIAN BLACK-HEADED ORIOLE, 0 . monachus
{Gm.) does not appear to have been imported, but Mr. Webb
brought a Black-headed Oriole from East Africa at least once ;
this would be 0 . m. rolletti Salvad , I presume. Another African
species was also brought by the same collector from Tanganyika
in 1934 ; this was the GREEN-HEADED ORIOLE, 0 . chloroce-
phalus Shelley. I saw the bird at the Zoo ; it had a broken leg
on arrival, but this mended well.

reserved section of the Fellows' Restaurant for all who attend the
rally and a collection for the Red Cross Fund will be made there.
Though there are no special arrangements for lunch this will be
obtainable as usual in the Gardens. Members of the Avicultural
Society are asked to volunteer their services in taking parties round
the aviaries and bird houses and those willing to do so are asked to
communicate with Mr. E. R. Lincoln, Chairman National Cage Birds
(Red Cross) Appeal, Cage Birds, Dorset House, Stanford Street,
London, S.E. 1, from whom also all details regarding the programme
can be obtained. It is hoped that members of the Avicultural Society
will do their utmost to attend the rally and by so doing both help
to maintain interest in aviculture and assist a vital national cause.

New Birds at the London Zoo
The Annual Report of the Zoo contains the usual List of Birds new to the

These three species were brought by Mr. Frost last autumn (see Avi. Mag.,
1333, 3 00 )- The Scissirostrum is, I think, new to any collection, the Zebra Finch
has been imported into Holland and maybe elsewhere, and Munia quinticolor
has a plate in Reichenbach's SINGVOGEL, but nothing is said there about
in captivity.

(4) Cinereous Finch, Piegorhina cinerea, Peru. Also a new arrival anywhere,
I imagine.
(5) Black-bellied Sunbird, Nectarinia melanogastra, East Africa.
A subspecies of JV. p. pulchela, the Beautiful Sunbird of West Africa, which
has been at the Zoo, first in 1929, a specimen presented by Mr. Spedan Lewis,
which was still alive and in perfect order in 1933, and perhaps later. Mr. Webb
also brought some in 1937 from the Gold Coast (A.M., 1937, 183).
(6) Crimson-winged Jay-Thrush, Garrulax milnei sharpei, Indo-China.
(7) Golden-winged Jay-Thrush, G. erythrocephalus connectans, Indo-China.

<reference confidence="0.6568929">
M. Delacour writing in 1934 says sharpei had been imported by then ; G. m.
milnei (Fohkien) not yet known in captivity, I think.
G. e. erythrocephalus (Himalayas) has been at the Zoo ( = No. 801 of the 1323
List), and has also been at Berlin teste Neunzig.
(8) Long-tailed Sibia, Sibia simillima, Sumatra.
The same bird (or ? subspecies) as those brought by Mr. Frost in 1936 ;
of these Mr. Sheriff had a pair which nested with him, but did not rear (A.M.,
1937, 333 &gt; an d Plate). Mr. Ezra has also had it, and I think the next as well.

New as a subspecies ; the typical form, I. f. Jiavala , the Brown-eared Bulbul
has been at the Zoo (first in 1877) and elsewhere.
(11) Blue-naped Coly, Colius m. pulcher, Tanganyika.

BLUE-WINGED SIVA AN EGG-STEALER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98731156" page_id="56314542"  page_num="242" year="" vol="">
We are frequently warned that the Pekin Robin is an inveterate egg stealer--
but we hear nothing about the Blue-winged Siva ( Siva cyanuroptera ), probably
because he is less frequently kept. I have seldom been long without one or more
of these perfectly charming birds during the past twenty years or more, but the
one specimen I have at the moment has caused me to alter my opinion very
considerably about this species.
Last season a pair of Orange-headed Ground Thrushes twice lost their eggs
after a day or two of incubation.
I suspected a pair of Mikado Pheasants which frequently perched in a bush
just by the Thrushes' nest.
Last month the Thrushes again built--the same bush--but this time we
caught the Siva which had inhabited the same aviary for eighteen months, busy
eating the Thrushes' last egg. He had not managed this without a fight, for he
was well " blooded ". It was a matter of a few seconds to trap the robber who
was put into the next aviary which only contains pairs of Tragopans, White-
fronted Doves, and Goodfellow's Parrot Finches.
The first day he took the Doves' eggs, and two days later he managed to
remove those of the Parrot Finches who were sitting unbeknown to me. The
entrance into their nest-box is a circular hole only one inch in diameter through
which even these small birds have a tight squeeze.
I fear the Siva will have to be caged--as X do not like to liberate him and do
not think he is worth an aviary to himself.
I must have had at least a dozen of these birds in my time, always in mixed
aviaries, which once more proves that one can never dogmatize as to the harmless-
ness of any particular species.

This brightly coloured bird is a member of a large group of
Tanagers popularly known as Callistes, though as a scientific name
Calliste has long since been displaced by Tangara. It is doubtful
if taxonomists will ever reach finality as far as the nomenclature
of birds is concerned. This is a great pity, for after aviculturists
become well acquainted with the scientific names of certain birds
it is very confusing when these are changed without their knowledge.
The mere fact that the multiplication of common names for birds
renders it necessary to use scientific names should be one good
reason why the latter should remain constant.
I understand that the genus Tangara has now been re-named
Calospiza. "
Mrs. Wilson's Tanager is an inhabitant of the tropical zone
from Western Ecuador to Panama. It frequents the forest and
second-growth of the hot humid coastal regions, where it may be
seen in small parties seeking its favourite berries or fruits. It prefers
the clearings and more open parts of the forest to the high virgin
forest and in this respect resembles the Yellow-winged Sugarbird
(Cyanerpes cyaneus ), in whose company it is often seen.
This Tanager is not common in Western Ecuador but becomes
more so as one goes northwards to W. Colombia and particularly
in W. Panama. It is strange that such a delightful bird, occurring
as it does in the Panama Canal zone, should not be better known
to aviculturists. The only one I ever remember seeing in captivity

before was at the Bird Show at the Horticultural Hall, Westminster,
London (1937), but it is possible that it belonged to another race
of the same species, which extends through Central America to
Mexico. My specimens were fed on a mixture of boiled potato
and hard-boiled egg (both finely minced) and dried off with
powdered sweet biscuit. This, in conjunction with a little fruit,
was all they ever had and, like all my other Tanagers, they
remained in perfect condition on this diet.

The Avicultural Magazine has now survived over a year of
war ; this survival is entirely owed to the magnificent support which
has been received from members of the Avicultural Society all
over the world. Without the articles they have written and the
financial support they have given we could not have continued.
Particularly to our fellow countrymen of the British Common-
wealth of Nations in Australasia and to our good friends across
the Atlantic do we owe a debt of gratitude.
Many and bitter have been the personal losses suffered during
recent months. Though the destruction of collections in France
and Belgium is a hard blow to aviculture throughout the world,
this is no cause for despair and even more is it an incentive to those
who can do so to continue to keep up collections to their utmost
for the good of aviculture as a whole in the future. *
A year ago I stated that there were several articles by German
aviculturists in hand and that these would be published. In this
number is published the last of these articles . . . without comment.
Though difficulties are increasing and the storm clouds at the
present time are at their blackest, the desire to cherish the
better things of life has in no way abated. I know I do not appeal
in vain for the support, which has so generously been given, to
be continued, and that every member of the Society will do his or
her utmost to maintain the Magazine and to contribute the articles
which are its very life blood.
The bonds of friendship between aviculturists have proved
their strength and through the welter of unhappiness and suffering

these bonds have increased a thousandfold. The efforts which
have been made, and are continuing to be made, by aviculturists
in the British Isles to carry on in the face of all difficulties will
be encouraged by the knowledge of the sympathy expressed in
the following letter, just, received by the American Clipper, from
the President of the Avicultural Society of America.
21st August , 1940.
" I should like to express through the columns of Avicul-
tural Magazine my very great admiration for the manner in
which your aviculturists and, indeed, all the people of your Islands
have been carrying on through these grim and tragic days. And
in so doing I know I am voicing the sentiments: of every decent
American.
4 4 There can be no question as to the final result of the dreadful
conflict in which you are now engaged. When the happy day
comes which ends it, and let us hope it be not too long delayed,
free men and women once again will be able to go about their
peaceful pursuits without let or hindrance from the brutal hand of
a cowardly oppressor. Let every Briton continue keeping his
chin up, firm in the conviction that he who will not be beaten,
cannot be beaten, now or ever.
" Meanwhile, the very best of luck to each and every one
of you.
"Yours sincerely,
"Henry Sedley,

In the spring of 1937 I received an imported pair of Australian
Banded Plovers (Zonifer tricolor Vieillot), a species which has only
rarely reached Germany. In conformity with my experience of
African species, as for example Stephanibyx coronatus and Sarciophorus
tectus , I put the pair in one of my inner aviaries on a thick layer
of sand. These Plovers are at their best on a thick layer of dry
sand and need in addition a large receptacle for water (a flower-
pot saucer) placed on a heap of peat. In these conditions all the
pairs I have kept over a period of years remained in good health
and always ready to breed. The Australian Plovers were some-
what shy at first and like true desert creatures did not regard
the whitewashed walls as obstacles. They immediately tried to
get through. Even when they become tamer, they still try to do
this when they want to fly. They never learn to regard the walls
as an impenetrable boundary of their enclosure.
The male bird appears stronger than the female. Its weight
is 170 g., that of the female 160 g. In the male too the wattles
on the forehead are larger and more brightly coloured. The neck
seems to be thicker. In character these Plovers resemble the
African Banded Plovers [Sarciophorus tectus ), but they are slower
and heavier than these.
Soon after they were settled in the aviary, copulation was
observed at various times. The female remained standing quietly
and did not duck, as for example, the Crowned Lapwings do.
In the middle of May, I found two plover-like eggs in a nest in
the sand, which unfortunately were damaged on the same day.
Apparently they were destroyed by Turnstones ( Arenaria inter pres)
or by Black Rails (. Limnocorax niger). The Plovers, therefore, were
placed in another aviary, where such disturbances could not occur.
On the 16th June the first egg was laid, followed at intervals of
two days by two others. This clutch was also laid in a sand hollow
lined with the excrement of the occupants. The clutch was only
incubated for a few days and then deserted. The birds continually

tried to reach their former aviary as soon as the door was opened.
As I thought I might be more successful if I granted the wish of
the birds, I returned them to their old aviary. The Turnstones
and Black Rails were captured and placed elsewhere.
A third clutch was commenced on the 7th July. The nest,
or rather the nesting hollow, was in a corner of the aviary and
this time lined with hay. On the 9th July there were three eggs,
which from that day onwards were incubated by the female. She
was relieved during the midday hours for a short time only by the
male. The three eggs always lay in the nest with the pointed end
downwards. During the period of incubation both birds became very
excited. The male, if approached, raised a frightful din, in which
the female, who had left the nest, immediately joined in somewhat
less degree. The female soon resumed her place on the clutch
and continued to brood pressed close to the ground. The normal
brooding position was only gradually resumed and one was able
to distinguish the brooding bird from the ground. When one
entered the aviary the Plovers naturally became still more excited.
The male became aggressive and tried to fly upon the intruder.
When one brought in the food receptacles he attacked and pecked
one's hand. Later the female took a more active part in the
defence of the eggs. Just the reverse was experienced during
breeding experiments with a pair of Crowned Lapwings. In the
case of this species the male did the incubating and the female
took over the defence of the eggs and afterwards of the young.
At the end of an incubation period of 28 days two chicks
began to hatch. At 12 o'clock on the 5th August two cracks
could be observed in two of the eggs. The young emerged very
slowly. The first chick only emerged between 6 and 7 o'clock in
the morning of the next day ; the second left the shell with my help
at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. The first chick weighed 12*5 g.
on the 6th August, the second in the eggshell 16*5 g. and after
emergence 14&apos;5 g. The first chick had crippled feet and died
on the 7th August. The other chick was very strong, but only
lived for two days. Apparently the difficulty it had had in emerging
from the eggshell had weakened it very much.
The behaviour of the parents after the emergence of the first
chick was quite interesting. The latter crawled out of the nest
from time to time, but always remained in the neighbourhood of

it. Then, while the female continued to sit, the chick was kept
warm by the male. I constantly found both parents sitting close
together, but always so that the breast of the male was turned to
that of the female.
After this fruitless attempt at breeding, the moult commenced
and lasted for about eight weeks. As early as January, 1938, the
Plovers were again ready to breed. The eggs were rendered
unfertile by shaking, as an attempt at breeding at this time of
year was useless, owing to the lack of fresh ants 5 eggs for the chicks.
In order to prevent the female from laying again, the eggs were
replaced in the nesting hollow and of course incubated in vain
for many weeks. During May and June plumage was renewed
once again. In July the birds once more showed a desire to breed,
unfortunately somewhat late in the year, as the lack of fresh ant
pupae would have to be reckoned with. On the 24th July two
eggs lay in a corner of the aviary in a shallow nest made from
droppings and a few pieces of hay. On the 26th July the clutch
was completed by a third egg and was again incubated largely
by the female. The behaviour of both birds during the time was
the same as described previously.
The other occupants of the aviary were removed before the
young hatched out. They were a pair of Somali Babbling Thrushes
{Crater opus leucopygius smithi), Black-headed Mynas {Myzantha
melanocephala ), and Levaillant's Barbet ( Trachyphonus cqfer). On
the 21 st August two young Plovers hatched out. They emerged
very quickly. The female continued to sit two hours after hatching.
The two chicks already began to run about, remaining near their
mother under whom they slipped again. The male also assisted
in keeping the chicks warm by placing himself close to the female.
The third chick hatched out on the 22nd August. The three
young birds were quite strong and lively and had the characteristic
down colouring of the Plover. They soon ran about, took food
and slipped again under their parents to warm themselves. They
were immediately given garden ants and their larvae and pupae,
which they at once picked up from the ground. They were soon
offered the larger pupae of the wood ant, which they also devoured
immediately. After a few days the ant pupae were strewn on a
flat board, together with finely chopped hard-boiled egg, so that
the young might accustom themselves to a certain feeding-place.

Dried ant pupae were also mixed with it. The following food was
always popular--even when other ingredients were added, first
in small quantities and later in greater proportions. It consisted
of a mixture of Spratt's biscuits, musk, white worm, dried ant
pupae, mixed with a little hot water and kneaded with freshly
ground carrot. Meal-worms were also appreciated.
Young Plovers are charming companions, extraordinarily agile.
At the first alarm they slip quickly behind a stone, a feeding-
trough, etc., and crouch close to the ground, so that they can
hardly be distinguished from their surroundings. The adult Plover
does this also if it becomes alarmed.
The young Plovers throve visibly. Their legs developed
especially and their general physical condition was good. Their
plumage could only be discerned as they grew older, as was the
case with their wing development. In their infancy they depend,
like so many of their kind, on the rapidity of their movements and
the protective colouring of the down plumage. The following
weights represent the physical development of the strongest chicks :
25-viii, 20 g. ; 27-viii, 30 g. ; 2g.viii, 38 g. ; 2.ix, 59 g. ; q.ix,
69 g. ; 8.ix, 91 g. ; io.ix, 105 g. ; i8.ix, 148 g.
On the 10th September the three chicks weighed 105 g.,
103 g., and 99 g. respectively.
The development of the plumage was noticeable from the
4th September onwards. During these days small white feathers
were visible on the sides of the body. On the 8th September
there were signs of wing feathers and other main plumage. The
plumage on the sides of the body and that of the breast developed
most rapidly. Finally, as the birds grew, the small feathers of head,
neck and other portions of the body became visible. The colouring
of the juvenile plumage was in the main that of an adult bird.
All portions of the plumage were duller and dirtier, however.
The black portion of the plumage appeared blackish grey. The
plumage of the back, wing coverts and shoulder feathers is not
monotone, but barred with light wavy lines. The coloration of
the naked parts is considerably duller. Since December the
adolescent young Plovers have been gradually moulting into adult
plumage.
The development of the red wattles on the forehead seems
to take place late. I found signs of them on the 10th September.

One gets the impression that this development starts on the front
portion of the eye and gradually expands in greater degree to
the forehead.
The old and young birds agreed quite well for a considerable
time until, in January, the parents again wished to breed and
began to lay. The young Plovers were then driven away by the
old male. I thought it best to separate the birds in order to prevent
them pecking each other. From the middle of January and
throughout February all the Plovers were very restless during the
night. They fluttered about and their peculiar loud calls were
often audible. Apparently the migration urge was affecting them,
as at this time in their native haunt they would naturally be roaming
about.
The result of the successful attempt at breeding gives one a
clear insight into the breeding psychology of these rare birds, which
in many respects, as I have already emphasized, is in contrast to
the observations I have been able to make for several years on a
pair of Crowned Plovers. In the case of the latter species, the male
broods almost exclusively, while the female undertakes the defence
of the nest and later the young.
I would like to add that the various species of Desert Plover
from Africa, Asia, and Australia are at all times satisfying aviary
birds, which I have always kept in inner cages often in the company
of very small birds, such as Ornamental Finches, Softbills, etc.
They speedily become tame and confiding and soon learn to know
their keeper. All of them appear to breed easily and give us a
pleasing insight into their frequently peculiar breeding habits.

The sad news of the probable destruction of the collections at
Cleres and at Sterrebeek (and, one fears, of others as well) leads
me to send a note on Dr. Derscheid's collection as it was at the
outbreak of war.
Most of the birds at " Armendy " were waterfowl, and of
these the Sea Ducks were, perhaps, the most interesting as nearly
all had been reared there.
In 1939 a good many Sea Ducks were reared from eggs obtained
from Iceland, and at the end of the year there were some 35
Harlequins, 10 Long-tailed (a species we found to be by far the
most difficult to rear and extremely susceptible to aspergillosis),
50 Barrow's Golden-eye of the year and an adult pair (reared
there in 1937), the female of which, after choosing a box to nest
in and ignoring the small caves we made in the rockwork, laid all
her eggs in the water.
Two Goosanders and two Red-breasted Mergansers were
reared--we found them very easy to manage after the first two days.
In addition to these there was a fine pair of adult Goosanders,
two pairs of Red-breasted Mergansers, and three Smews which
seemed to be two males and a female, the two former having some
black on the face and the latter, a more effeminate looking bird,
having some brown, but, though we had all three for two years,
the two supposed males never showed any sign of coming into
colour, so perhaps they were all females.
Like the other Saw-bills, the Smews soon acquired a preference
for bullock's heart to fish, and were even too lazy to catch the
small roach, etc., which one could sometimes see swimming fearlessly
all round them.
In the Smews' pond were one male and two female Common
Golden-eye, and a female Buffle-head, while with the Mergansers
were three pairs of Eiders.
Some Common Scoter were reared in 1939 but, as is so often
the case, they disliked the water and so were never in good plumage.
In September most of these sea ducks were moved to the estate
of a friend of Dr. Derscheid who lived near Luxembourg ; we
found that so many diving ducks made the shallow water at

Sterrebeek extremely muddy, but at the new place there were
fine stretches of clear and deep water in some old quarries, and
so some of the birds may still be alive and well, finding enough
live food.
The rarest of the fresh-water ducks were 2 &amp;lt;$ and 1 S
of the handsome Crested Duck (Anas cristata ). The two males
performed their curious display (which included swimming back-
wards) throughout the year, but as the female was never interested
in them, they displayed to any of the others, chiefly Gadwall, or,
in the absence of others, to nothing.
Three pairs of the immaculate Ring-billed Scaup were also
of interest.
The curious Spiny-tailed Ducks were represented by three
cJ North American Ruddy, one pair of White-backed, and
two $ (?) Peruvian Ruddy.
These birds, which are so low in the water as to appear rather
water-logged, rarely came on to the land, but on sunny days
would often put their feet up in the air from under the wings as
though to sun them, and sometimes while this quaint contortion
was being performed, the tail, which is generally carried under
the water, would be cocked up at right-angles to the body and
spread fanwise to dry, giving the bird the appearance of having
set sail. The North American, with their bright blue bills, displayed
a great deal in the summer, but I never saw the others do so.
Of the Teal, a fine pair of Ring-necked (A. leucophrys )--perhaps
the only breeding pair in Europe--and three of their 1939 young
ones were the most attractive. There were also two pairs of what
is probably a sub-species of the Brazilian, which it resembles except
for being much larger, a pair of Hottentot, a male Puna (A. puna),
a male Sharp-winged, three pairs of Chilean, four pairs of Brazilian,
four pairs of Cinnamon, five pairs of Versicolor, one pair of Cape,
two pairs of Chestnut-breasted, three pairs of Green-winged,
two pairs of Australian Grey, one of Common, one of Garganey,
and three of Blue-winged.
A male Pigmy Goose had been in the collection for several
years, I believe ; it and a female had done very well on soaked
canary seed and millet, and plenty of duckweed in summer, but
the female had died in the winter of 1938, when, owing to intense
cold, we were obliged to put them inside with a lot of larger ducks.

The Shovelers were represented by a male Australian
(S. rhynchotis), three pairs of South American, one pair of Gape,
and one of Common ; the Pintails by three pairs of Chilean, four
of Bahama, one of Red-billed, and two of Common, and the
Pochards by a pair of White-eyed, i $ Baer's, two pairs of
American Red-headed, and two of Common.
There were some four pairs of Eastern Scaup which arrived
from China in the summer of 1939, but, being young, they were
not sufficiently in colour when last I saw them to be able to judge
if they were much different from the Common, though they were
smaller.
There were also a pair of Lesser and one of Common, as well
as the very nice Ring-billed.
The Tree Ducks which were full-winged, had been depleted
by severe weather in 1938, and only a pair of Red-billed, one
Javan, one Fulvous, and one Wandering survived.
Several species of Mallard were represented--some four pairs
of Icelandic, a form slightly smaller and slimmer than those one
may usually see here or on the Continent were reared from eggs
from Iceland in 1939.
There were also one pair of the rather handsome Dusky Duck
(A. obscura ), one of Japanese Spot-billed, one of Indian Spot-billed,
and two of Australian Mallard.
Of the Sheld-ducks, a pair of Common, one of New Zealand,
one of Radjah, one of Ruddy, a female Australian, and two pairs
of Cape were in the collection.
A male White-winged Wood Duck, American and Indian
Comb Duck, three pairs of pure-bred Muscovy, Common, and
American Wigeon, Gadwall, Falcated, and Baikal Teal, Mandarin
and Carolina complete the list of ducks.
Thirteen species of Geese were in the collection : Ross' Snow,

The only Cranes in the park were seven Demoiselles.
Of the Parrots, a pair of Keas (.Nestor notabilis) were delightful ;
they were tame and very inquisitive, and would, I think, have
nested but the cock was afraid of the hen, which was in breeding
condition, and went a great deal into the nest.

I am sure that these extremely intelligent birds would survive
at liberty, and would stand the coldest winter, but they were
altogether too trusting and would, I fear, soon be caught or shot.
There were also a hen Desmarest's Dwarf Parrot (C. desmaresti) j
and a tame Dusky. A fine pair of Slaty-headed (P. schisticeps )
which would have been old enough to breed this year ; two hen (?)
Tabuan ( Pyrrhulopsis tabuensis) which were very tame and had
been in the collection for several years, and a breeding pair of
Hooded were the best of the Parrakeets.
A $ Red-fronted New Zealand and a Great-billed
(T. megalorhynchus) were also rarities.
There were four pairs of Golden-fronted New Zealands, two
of Swifts, Layard's, Malabars, Kings, Crimson-winged, African
Ring-necked, Salvadori's, Turquoisine, Rock Grass, Splendid,
Bourke's, and Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets.
Of the Lories and Lorikeets two pairs of Violet-necked, one of
White-backed, and a single Porphyry-crowned were perhaps the
most interesting ; there were also two pairs of Green-naped
( T . hamatodus) and one of Black-throated (T. nigrigularis) , Mitchell's,
Forster's, Ornate, Scaly-breasted, Chattering, and Red Lories.
There were three nice little Javan Hanging Parrakeets
[L. pusillus, I believe) , and two Worcester's.
Eight Avocets were the best of the Waders, which included
Ringed Plover, Dunlins, a Curlew-Sandpiper, a Temminck's
Stint, and a Redshank reared at " Armendy ".
There was a delightful pair of Bearded Tits shown off to per-
fection by the soft green leaves of the bamboo (Arundinaria nitida ),
with which their small aviary was planted. Two eggs were laid
in 1939, but were dropped from the perch.
The only Pheasants were a pair each of Satyr and Temminck's
Tragopans. A bird I shall always associate with " Armendy "
is the Golden Oriole. Several pairs nested in the park each year,
and although it was nearly always difficult to see them, one could
hear the flute-like call on any sunny day in the summer.
I hope that accounts of other European collections will be
made for the Magazine, because I believe that, at the commence-
ment of the war, they contained a greater and more interesting
variety of rare birds than ever before.

It occurred to me that some of your readers may be interested
in a few observations on the keeping and breeding of the Satin
Bower Bird (.Ptilonorhynchus violaceus ), a species of our avifauna
that, so far as I have been able to learn, has not hitherto been
bred and reared in captivity. 1
In my breeding pair, which I have had for the past six or
seven years, I was fortunate perhaps in having secured a pair
that I fancy were mated when caught, but being fully matured--
the male, a particularly fine specimen in full adult plumage--they
were perhaps slower in adapting themselves to captivity than would
have been the case had they been younger birds or ones that had
previously been kept in confinement.
However, in the course of time they settled down, and when,
in 1937, I was able to provide them with conditions resembling
as nearly as possible their natural state, their contentment was
at once apparent and in December of that year they built their
nest. In the selection of its site advantage was taken of the privacy
which a dense clump of ti-tree, dead and suspended from the roof
of an open shelter, provided. In construction the nest corresponded
with the usual design, cup-shaped and composed of thin sticks
and twigs and loosely lined with dead leaves.
On this occasion one egg only was laid although two to three
are the usual number, but, being mainly interested in the problems
of breeding and rearing, my chief concern--once having satisfied
my curiosity as to the content of the nest--has been to see that
the birds enjoy absolute freedom from interference and for this
reason I regret that I have nothing to add to the knowledge of
the domestic habits of the species ; even with certainty the period
of incubation. There are, however, a few observations which

my close association of some years now with these birds enables
me to make that may be interesting in so far as they serve to
reveal, among other things, the adaptability of these highly
intelligent birds to conditions that necessarily restrict to a great
extent their freedom and choice of action.
At this point a brief description of the aviary and the conditions
under which the birds are housed may be helpful. The section
of the aviary to which I refer has an area of 133 square yards
and a height over all of about 8 feet. On the western side of the
flight and protecting it from the winds that occasionally blow
here in all seasons of the year from that quarter, is a dividing fence
along which the neighbours have conveniently planted a tall privet
hedge. Within the aviary is an assortment of shrubs with a few
conifers interspersed. A fig tree is there also, and an old
pittosporum, which has been lopped, spreads its branches to give
further shade and protection to the birds. A number of small
tree trunks, moss-grown and decaying, lie scattered about on the
bare earth beneath the bushes. In the centre of the aviary is
a fountain past which a path leads from the steps of a rockery
and the entrance gate on the southern end, to a large open shelter
at the opposite extremity. On the eastern side of the path grow
cocksfoot and prairie grass beneath specimens of hibiscus, prunus
and pomegranate, which beautify without obstructing a view
of the occupants of the aviary.
Under conditions such as I have attempted briefly to describe,
the birds have all the privacy that such denizens of the dense
scrub lands enjoy, and the fact that they have regularly nested
for the past four years goes far to support my belief that given
a setting resembling its habitat it is possible to breed any bird
in captivity.
By the use of the word " breed " I mean only what the word
implies--to rear the progeny is another matter and I have yet
to learn the secret of my one and only success in so doing, unless
it was due to the fact that on the occasion in question the birds
had only one egg and one chick to care for. This being the case
it would then appear to have been a matter of quantity rather
than the quality and kind of live food that happened to be available ;
otherwise only sheer good luck would account for an achievement
which I have not since been able to repeat although the birds

have bred regularly every year since, laying two eggs and hatching
both, but failing to rear the babies beyond the second or third
week.
Unfortunately about the month of November the mealworms,
which if available in unlimited quantities would, I believe, be
alone sufficient to bring the youngsters to maturity, begin to
turn into beetles and in consequence by December and January
when the eggs are hatched and live food is most needed, I am
forced on to substitutes which are difficult to find in sufficient
quantities.
If the nestlings survive the first four or five weeks the problem
of feeding becomes easier, for then I found that as an adjunct
bread and milk, well sweetened, was readily accepted, but it is
necessary to have it lumpy enough for the parent bird to carry.
A supply of fruit, chiefly bananas, and a good soft bill food are
always available, but although greatly appreciated by the adult
bird I am unable to say if either was ever fed to the nestling ;
however, I fancy not. In adult life P. violaceus is one of the easiest
birds to cater for as it is practically omnivorous, and because
of this one would imagine it to be easy to rear, but it is not, and
the proof of it is to be found in the effort to do so.
I cannot say whether in the process of nidification the work
is shared by both birds or done by the female alone ; I have
not had the good fortune to witness the procedure, but it may
be taken as a fact that with this exception, every other function
having to do with the life and welfare of the brood is borne by
the female. The male of the species, on the other hand, judging
by its habits in captivity, appears to have only one interest in life,
which is the upkeep of his beloved bower. From it he is never
long absent ; to him, and to a lesser degree the female, there is
nothing so sacrosanct ; in it their constructive and artistic genius
finds expression ; it is at once their temple, their trysting place,
and their playground.
In my observations I have been curious to discover what the
birds' reactions would be to conditions which afforded them
little opportunity for free choice of material in the building of
their bowers, but such is the ingenuity of these birds that on
occasions when I have purposely withheld supplies of material
from them they succeeded in constructing their bowers equally

as well as ever from sticks that they had themselves plucked from
the shrubs in the aviary. I have noticed, moreover, that their
interest and pride in the bowers were not affected to any extent
by the lack of ornaments with which to adorn them. It would
also appear from experiments which I have made that the painting
of their bowers, a practice which is to be frequently observed
in the field, is not essential to either their economy or enjoyment.
It is, of course, probable that I did not provide them with the
requisite material for the work ; but having supplied them with
charcoal, which is believed to be the medium used, the fact that
they have never shown any disposition to paint their bowers would
suggest to me that this further manifestation of their genius is only
exhibited when conditions favour or render it desirable.
One peculiarity, however, in the construction of their bowers,
the reason for which is as obscure as it is remarkable, is the aspect
in which they are built. Invariably I have found the walls run
in a north and south direction. On two occasions I have lifted
their bowers platform and all--so strongly are they built that
it is possible to do this without risk of damage--and transferred
them to sites which seemed to me to be suitable in every way
excepting that in one instance the structure was given a slightly
different bearing. The result of this experiment was that the
bower did not survive the first inspection but was at once
demolished and rebuilt, not on its former site but near by, and
in the usual northerly direction. In the case of the other bower
which was given the proper aspect I noticed that the birds continued
to use it for a few days but it was evidently not to their liking
and in due course met with the same fate as the other.
I have also noticed, contrary to the experience of some
observers, that both birds share in the construction and maintenance
of the bowers. There is no doubt that the male is largely responsible
for the work but I have frequently observed both birds, separately
and together, making adjustments and whatever repairs that were
necessary. Apparently, however, the birds object to the intrusion
of others upon the bower, and although I fancy I have noticed
at times a disposition on the part of the male to allow the young
bird to approach the ground it is at once driven off by the female
should she happen to be near. The significance of this is note-

of the youngster which, although in its third year, is still a matter
of doubt to me. It is generally believed that the male of the species
does not come into full adult plumage until the seventh year and
it is probable that this is so, but it is difficult to understand how
the proof could be established without the actual breeding of the
bird in captivity ; if for no other reason, therefore, than to remove
all doubt on the subject, I hope that the means of so doing may
be open to me, but unfortunately the indications do not point
to the young bird being a male.
It may be thought that under the circumstances which I have
attempted to describe a great deal of information might have
been gathered concerning the social and other characteristics of
these birds, and no doubt were it possible for me to devote the
time to more lengthy and frequent observations the answer could
be found to many questions that occur to one, but the position
being what it is I leave it to the future and others with more time
at their disposal to continue the quest for more enlightenment
on the habits and life history of these wonderful birds.

when brought up young easily tamed, but the old birds are quite
indocile. . . may be taught many words if attended to young, and
even then at intervals squall very much. This species is subject
to fits when in confinement, yet on the whole is a long-lived bird."

E. HOPKINSON-LATHAM AS A BIRD FANCIER
A foot-note says : " We are informed by a gentleman who kept a
female Macaw for many years, that it laid several eggs, entirely
white, rather larger than those of a pigeon, longer and more tapering
to the small end." Another macao was also seen in the Exeter
Change Menagerie.
Amazons
The YELLOW-WINGED PARROT (ochroptera ). " Buffon
expatiates on the sensibility of this species, from the notes of a
friend who kept one . . . ; it was of a very uncertain temper ; for
if chastised for biting rather hard it persisted in the offence, and
never was to be reclaimed but by the most gentle usage ; it was
impatient in a cage, biting to pieces everything within reach, and
always silent and dull, except when at liberty. It chattered then
continually, and had much to say, as it remembered everything ;
yet with all this caprice, the bird was very fond of children. In
the time of moulting, which lasted nearly three months, it appeared
dejected and uneasy. It was chiefly fed on hemp-seeds, nuts and
fruits of all kinds, but preferred meat ; when allowed to have it,
it became dull and heavy and lost its feathers. We believe the above
account will include the manners of most Parrots in confinement,
and the circumstance of the loss of plumage from the use of animal
food we have frequently been witness to, and this appeared to
arise from the irritation produced in the skin, which induced the
birds to be constantly picking and fretting the parts to allay the
uneasy sensation " (p. 245). The MEALY GREEN PARROT (i.e.
the Mealy Amazon), " . . . is much admired for its note, singularity
of colour and gentleness of disposition, added to its talking well."
Other Amazons mentioned are the RED-HEADED, the
FESTIVE, the AGILE and the " Aurora Parrot ". The last is
a yellow variety of the Blue-fronted Amazon, M. Salerne mentions
one that spoke the Portuguese tongue distinctly and was very
tame (ii, 246). Edwards kept an AGILE PARROT (the Jamaica
Amazon) for some years, and the FESTIVE AMAZON receives
longer notice (253). " . . . in great esteem for its talking better than
either the GUINEA or ASH-COLOURED, but is said to be an
ungrateful and mischievous bird, as it bites everyone who attempts
to stroke it. . . . This account . . . will not suit every individual

The THEGAU PARROT (J Cyanolyseus byroni) "is easily
tamed and speaks well " {216) and the CAROLINA PARROT
(i.e. Conuropsis ) is easily tamed (148). The PAVOUANE PARROT
(i.e. the Green Conure, A. leucophthalmus) " will learn to talk well,
but though confined for a long time, rarely becomes familiar "
(ij6). The LONG-TAILED GREEN PARRAKEET var. A. (i 54 )
is the Cuban Conure ( euops ) and is described as readily learning to
talk, whistle and imitate the voices of animals. The Brown-
throated and the Golden-Crowned Conures (aeruginosus and
aureus) are mentioned as having been brought to and kept in
England, and two Nenday Conures as having been imported into
Spain (258).
Other South American Parrots mentioned as cage-birds include
a Caique, which as the WHITE-BREASTED PARROT is
described (ii, 257) as " . . . restless and quarrelsome, and if one
is taken it for the most part refuses food, and at last is starved to
death. In general, Parrots, even the most stubborn, are to be
subdued by means of the smoke of tobacco, but this one is only
put into bad humour by the attempt ; whoever therefore would
have these birds, must train them up young, and this is scarcely
worth labour, if not for the sake of variety, for they do not learn
to talk ". Two Brotogeris have cage-bird notes (m, 168, 187) these
are the YELLOW-WINGED PARRAKEET, which is B. virescens,
and the PRASINE PARROT, which is probably B. tirica ; the

after from not having the faculty of learning words " ( 222 ). The

the puppet-show, but when taught to articulate is always
chattering ". (A doubtful species teste B.M. Catalogue).
The ASH-COLOURED PARROT (i.e. the Grey, P. erithacus),
has, as one would expect, full notice (208), " it . . . talks quite as
well as the Green Parrot, and is much less noisy ; chiefly imported
into England from Guinea, and is a well-known species ; said
to sometimes live one hundred years ... it is unusual for female
Parrots to lay eggs in this country, and not being impregnated
no account is taken of them, and the circumstance of their breeding
here is of course very rare ; but we are told that at Marmande in
France a male and female produced young ones for five or six
years together. The eggs were generally four, of which never more
than three were good. The nest was made in a cask which had one
end knocked out, and filled with sawdust ; proper accommodation
being made for entrance, so that the male might sit by his mate ;
if any one entered the chamber where they were, not having boots
on, he was sure to have his legs severely bitten by the male, who
was particularly jealous if anyone approached the female.
P. Labat also mentions a pair which hatched young in Paris.
The NOOFFY PARROT (ii, 278) is described as a blue Parrot
which the traders from the Soudan bring down for sale and " sell
at astonishing prices, some as high as twenty dollars, and are
carried by the negresses, who soon teach them to speak " (pre-
sumably a Grey Parrot).
The SENEGAL PARROT (= Poicephalus senegalus ) is said to
talk very well and two LOVEBIRDS are mentioned as cage-

is described as " ... a green Parrakeet with a grey head, as large
as a Sparrow, and not to be tamed 55 . The first, the GUINEA
PARRAKEETS are " . . . affectionate to each other and usually
kept in pairs in one cage ; the male is ever obliging to his mate,
will hull seeds for her with his bill and present them to her in this
state, and each seems unhappy at a moment's separation ; if one
is sick, the other is melancholy, and if death ensues, the sorrowful
relict rarely long survives " ( though a foot-note says) " We have
however known that single birds will often live in a cage for many
years ". They are exported " from Africa in great numbers, but

few in proportion survive the passage, yet they will often live many
years after. They are kept for their beauty, for they have no song,
only a noise, which is far from agreeable ".
The SAPPHIRE-CROWNED PARRAKEET {267) is one of
the Hanging Parrakeets ( Loriculus) ; "in a cage it whistles very
seldom and commonly grows quite sullen ; will feed on boiled
rice. . . ." The COLLARED PARRAKEET . . . " inhabits the
Philippines 55 is either another Loriculus or perhaps a Bolbopsittacus.

plate of the JONQUIL PARRAKEET (i.e. a Lutino Plumhead)
drawn from a living specimen in the possession of Miss Hunter of
Greenwich, which came from Bengal, is given in vol. ii. The JAVAN
PARROT ( = P. alexandri ) " inhabits Java, where it is universally
exposed for sale ( 122 ). BAUER'S PARRAKEET is Barnardius
zonarius ; the description is taken from a specimen at a dealer's
in St. Martin's Lane. Two Platycefci are mentioned as having
been seen in captivity in England, under the names CRIMSON
AND YELLOW PARROT and the CHLOROTIC PARROT
(144). The BLUE-GREEN PARROT is Psittinus incertus : " a
bird of this kind was alive in the possession of Lady Read for nine
years " ; from whence it came is uncertain ( 278 ). The TABUAN
PARROT (i.e. Pyrrhulopsis) has a plate p. iij ; a Mrs. King had
a live one in 1809, which laid three eggs while in her possession.
The two COCKATOOS with cage-bird mention are the
LESSER CRESTED, C. sulphurea, and the RED-CROWNED,
which is the Gang-gang. Latham saw one of the last at
Mr. Thompson's in St. Martin's Lane.
Lories
The BLUE-BELLIED PARROT (i.e. Trichoglossus moluccanus,
" the Blue Mountain Lory ") " Sir Tho. G. Cullum, Bart., informs
me that one of these birds brought from New Holland in 1794,
is now (i.e. 1822, E.H.) alive at his sister's, and that its food during
that space of time has been bread and water only--boiling water
is poured on crumbs of bread and after standing a little while, put
into a piece of cloth and squeezed dry. Now and then an almond

is given, but never any water ". Afoot-note adds " It may not be
amiss to remark that a Parrot from New Holland, being very
tame, was permitted to be at large now and then in a sitting-room,
and in this state finding a few bitter almonds within its reach,
ate one or two, which caused its death " ( 124 ). Under the RED-
BREASTED PARROT (123) we are told on M. Levaillant's
authority that a pair of these imported from Amboina bred in the
Menagerie of . . . the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope. The
female made the nest, lining it with feathers from her breast, and
laid two white eggs ; the young were hatched in 19 days ; they
were at first covered with greyish down and by degrees gained the
green feathers and the blue on the head ; the parents continued to
feed them for six months 55 . These were probably Blue-faced
Lorikeets, T. haematodus {Linn.) or, perhaps, T. cyanogrammus ,
Wagler , or ? moluccanus. Gm. ; if the last the paragraph above
and this would refer to the same species, E.H. Two species of
Eos are mentioned as having been imported, (1) the INDIAN
LORY, (which = E. histrio) and (2) the GUEBY LORY, which
is either E. wallacei or E. riciniata. Latham owned one and
knew of another, which had been in a lady's possession for
some years, which though it did not talk was the most docile and
tame parrot Latham ever saw (ii, 134 ).
After all this I think that we can safely include our author
among the " fanciers ", and a good, observant fancier too, who
knew of quite a marvellous number of cage-birds considering the
early days of the cult in which he lived, the eighteenth century.

the troubles caused by war conditions the death of one of the
authors, the Rev. F. G. R. Jourdain, just as the work was going
to press, was a serious blow. In spite of all, Volume IV maintains
the high standard of its predecessors and will be of the utmost
value to all ornithologists. Though the majority of species dealt
with in this volume are not of primary interest to aviculturists,
much of useful assistance to them can be found in its pages. The
section on waders is thorough, detailed, and profusely illustrated.
Though the members of this attractive family of birds are not widely
chosen by aviculturists, great success has been achieved in rearing
them, particularly by Dr. Derscheid in Belgium and in the Budapest
Zoological Gardens. As in the other volumes, several useful maps
showing distribution of species are included, and also interesting
charts of song periods of British Birds.

The Chairman, Mr. E. R. Lincoln, is certainly to be congratulated on his deter-
mination. An interesting and varied programme was arranged which included
talks and discussions on Foreign Birds, British Birds, Budgerigars, Canaries and
" War time Problems of Bird Keeping " and series of films of Tawny Owl, the
Warblers, and the Tits was shown. Though the attendance was naturally
ruined by the difficulties of reaching the Zoo and the series of Air Raid warnings
during the day, the fact that the Rally was carried on is most commendable as
being a tangible expression of the spirit existing among all aviculturists in the
British Isles.
New York Zoological Park
The Bird Department of the New York Zoological Park added forty-five new
species to its collection during 1939, representing the greatest annual total of
new species in the history of the Park. The most important were the Australian
Yellow-billed Spoonbill, Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasant, Bearded Bar bet, and
several species of Birds of Paradise including the Empress of Germany, Wahne's
Six-plumed, and the Australian Rifle-bird. The most important losses were a
Kagu which had lived in the collection for eighteen years and four months,
a male Emperor of Germany's Bird of Paradise, eight years, and a Swainson's
Toucan, thirteen years and five months.

The Red-Tailed Jay-Thrush (Garrulax milnei indochinensis)
These lovely Thrushes, with their beautiful crimson wings and tail, grey
body, reddish cap and white cheeks, do well in captivity. I feed . mine on
insectivorous food, bananas and mealworms on which they thrive. They love
bathing, one of them turns somersaults in its cage, their voices are very agreeable
and vary at different times. In my opinion these birds are more suitable for
an aviary than a cage, but unluckily I have not got a garden, so have to keep
them in a cage. They are very hardy and do not need heat in winter, coming
from a cold climate. In fact they are some of the most attractive birds I have
ever possessed.

splendid effort they have made, under extraordinarily difficult conditions, in
producing such a fine edition on Pheasants. This edition will also correct the
impression that the O.P.S. is out of action. I was greatly interested in
Miss Chawner's remarks regarding the " Mexican " Ocellated Turkey. Is this
the same as the Honduras Turkey ? If the stuffed specimen in the Natural History

THE LEGKFORD COLLECTION
By David Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99721708" page_id="56314579"  page_num="267" year="" vol="">
The note by Miss Chawner in the August number of the
Magazine gave one a foretaste of the joy of a visit to Leckford, and
so it was with the greatest pleasure that I received an invitation
from Mr. Spedan Lewis to pay him a visit and see his collection.
Captain Alan Lendon, of Adelaide, South Australia, whose
interesting articles on Australian birds are appearing in the
Magazine, accompanied me.
The water meadows at Leckford are ideal for waterfowl of all
kinds, streams from the River Test flowing in all directions and
supplying every paddock with fresh running water without any
fear of floods ; and Mr. Lewis has made the best of a splendid
situation. The whole has been surrounded by a vermin-proof
fence and divided up into large paddocks with ample water, grass,
and rushes ; all that waterfowl require.
In such an ideal situation one finds a really wonderful collection
of birds, including thirteen species of Crane, twenty-seven of
Geese, five of Swans. The collection of Ducks includes almost
every species that has been imported, including no less than eight
species of Tree Ducks.
Of the Cranes the most uncommon are a true pair of Wattled
(.Bugeranus carunculatus ), magnificent birds that we may never see
again when the four in the country (the other two are at Foxwarren)
are gone, for the species is said to be verging upon extinction in its
native home of Eastern and Southern Africa, which is not to be
wondered at, seeing its conspicuous appearance and realizing

that, unfortunately, to so many people any strange and striking bird
or beast is an object to be slain. It is much to be hoped that those
now here will eventually breed, and so help to keep the species
going.
The only Crane that has bred at Leckford this year is the
Sandhill ( Megalornis mexicana ), of which a fine youngster was being
reared at the time of our visit.
Geese have bred well, young having been reared from three
species of Snow-geese, Chen hyperboreus nivalis , C. caeruleus , and
C. rossii ; two species of Chloephaga , the Ashy-headed (C. polioce-
phala ), and the Ruddy-headed (C. rubidiceps) , the latter a bird
one does not often see in collections ; and the Red-breasted ( Branta
rujicollis ).
The Geese I was particularly pleased to see were the Kelps
(Chloephaga hybrida ), of which there is one fine male and two females.
When we had facilities for keeping Geese at the Zoo, I did my
best to obtain the more uncommon species, and succeeded in
getting together a very good collection before the last war ; but
the Kelp was the one I found it impossible to obtain, and I under-
stood that it could not be imported or kept alive in captivity
because it fed upon nothing but seaweed. This is undoubtedly
its principal food in the Falkland Islands, but nevertheless
Mr. Alastair Morrison succeeded in importing several specimens
last year, and when Mr. Terry Jones took charge of them he found
that they would eat lettuce and even grass. For a time they thrived,
but eventually some died, though the three that remain, which
are shown in the accompanying photograph, appear to be in
excellent health. It is a most attractive species, the gander being
white as snow, while the geese are very dark, almost black, with
light bars on the flanks and white tails. As someone remarked,
they remind one of Ptarmigan.
The Radjah Sheld-duck ( Tadorna radjah) , from Northern
Australia and New Guinea, has always been looked upon as a
rare and delicate species and, so far as I am aware, has never
been bred in captivity until now. At Leckford it has proved
itself to be quite hardy, and no less than ten young birds have been
reared which, when I saw them on ist August, looked practically
adult.
Tree Ducks, too, have done very well, both the Black-billed

Pochard ( Nyroca erythrophthalma) , five Gape Teal (. Anas capensis ),
and an Argentine Shoveler ( Spatula platalea ), besides many others
of less importance. The photograph, taken on ist August, shows
the very fine collection of this year's youngsters.
Many of our members know the fine aviaries at Leckford ; they
are arranged in two rows with a large paddock between, and
there are more than fifty of them. In the paddock a fine pair of
Secretary Birds ( Segittarius serpentarius) disport themselves. This
remarkable species is never likely to be bred in captivity until a
pair with full powers of flight can be kept in an enormous aviary
in which are trees and bushes, as the nest is built at some height
from the ground. But in such a situation I believe there would
be a very good prospect of their breeding successfully.
The aviaries contain a splendid collection of Pheasants, together
with many other birds, for, although Pheasants are quarrelsome
amongst their own kind, they generally agree quite well with birds
of other families.
There are no less than five pairs of Bulwer's Pheasant ( Lobio -
phasis bulweri), one of the most remarkable of the Pheasant tribe,
with deep blue dress, white tail, and blue-wattled face. The display,
which was illustrated in this Magazine in July, 1938, has been seen
at Leckford many times, though the birds have not, so far, bred.
We saw chicks being reared by foster hens of such rarities as
Palawan and Sumatran Peacock Pheasants (. Polyplectron emphanum
and P. chalcurus ), Rheinardt's ( Rheinardia ocellata) , Edwards ( Germans
edwardsi ), and Mikado Pheasants ( Calophasis mikado ), but the greatest
success with the game birds this year has been the hatching of no
less than eighteen young Ocellated Turkeys ( Meleagris ocellata).
All were looking extremely well, in charge of their bantam foster-
mothers. So far as I know, this species has never before been bred
in captivity. It is so rare that its increase by breeding in this
country is most desirable. Photographs of the bird in normal
attitude as well as in display, were published in this Magazine
in October, 1937.
In one aviary there was a collection of no less than twenty-
seven Touracos, representing nine species, and a wonderful sight
they were, while in another aviary were five examples of the very

rare Rothschild's Grackle (. Leucopsar rothschildi) , from the small
island of Bali.
Ganga Cockatoos ( Callocorydon Jimbriatus ) were rearing young
and there were many young Turquoisines ( Neophema pulchella ),
Bluebirds ( Sialia sialis ), Galapagon Doves (, Nesopelia galapagoensis ),
and many others.
Then there is the Owl collection in which the following species
are represented : Bubo bubo with several races including B. b.
turcomanus, B. poensis, B. nipalensis, B. lacteus, Strix woodfordi , S. sinensis ,
Asio midas , Ketupa ketupa , Scotopelia bouvieri, Nyctea nyctea , and the
vary rare Glaucidium tephronotum.
This brief and inadequate sketch of the Leckford collection
gives, I fear, a poor idea of its magnitude and variety, but it is
very satisfactory to know that such a collection is being maintained
in our country in spite of the present difficult conditions.

LONG-LIVED HUMMING BIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.989117333333333" page_id="56314582"  page_num="270" year="" vol="">
I got a female Racket-tailed Humming Bird (. Discura longicauda)
in October, 1934. She was kept in a cage by herself in my room,
and was given flights of a few minutes every day. She was fed on
the usual mixture of Mellin's food, Nestle's milk, and honey--and
never had any live food the whole time she was with me. She was
very keen on bathing and used to jump into her bath the moment
it was put into her cage. She lived in perfect health and condition
till the end of July, 1940, when I was very sorry to lose her. I think
this must be a record for such a tiny Humming Bird in captivity.
I still have in robust health and plumage a female Garnet-throated
Humming Bird (. Eulampis jugularis ) which arrived here at the
same time as the above Racket-tailed Humming Bird, October, 1934.
She is still in perfect condition and feather and looks like living for
a long time yet. This bird has been shown for years and members
must know her.

Arriving at Cairns, I was at once struck by the number of
interesting birds that were to be seen in the streets and gardens
of the town. Peaceful Doves ( Geopelia placida) were very plentiful,
as also were the Forest Kingfishers [Halcyon macleayi ), the latter
frequently perching on the telephone wires ; at one stage I was
able to see five of them at one time from my hotel window. Also
fond of the wires as a perch were a small flock of the striking White-
breasted Wood Swallow ( Artamus leucorhynchus) , and there were
also a number of Honeyeaters about the town, which drew attention
to themselves by a very characteristic call note, but which I did
not ever succeed in getting a good enough look at to be able to
identify them with any certainty, though they obviously belonged
to the genus Meliphaga. Feeding on the mud-flats at low tide,
a number of Sea-Curlews ( JVumenius cyanopus) were often to be
seen and a number of the very attractive Yellow Fig-Bird ( Spheco -
theres flaviventris) were always to be found feeding noisily in a large
fig-tree on the sea front ; of these I only saw two males in their
striking plumage, all the others, and they were numerous, being
either females or immatures in their striped plumage.
In the course of several short motor trips through the sugar-
cane country in the vicinity of the town, a number of species were
identified. The Chestnut-breasted Finch (Munia castaneothorax ),
known locally as the Bullfinch, was very common and the Double-
Bar Finch ( Steganopleura bichenovii) was fairly plentiful ; but I was
not fortunate enough to see either the Gouldian Finch ( Poephila
gouldice) or the Crimson Finch (Neochmia phaeton) in the wild state,
although both are found in the district. The Forest Kingfishers
(. H . macleayi) were everywhere in the cane country, and Australian
Bee-eaters ( Merops ornatus) were not uncommon. Other interesting
birds seen were the Spangled Drongo ( Chibia bracteata), of which
I identified a pair, and the Pheasant Coucal (Centropus phasianus),
known locally as the Native Pheasant, of which I saw two examples
crossing the road in a leisurely fashion in front of the car.

272 A. LENDON-A TRIP TO NORTH QUEENSLAND
On the second day, an all-day trip by car to the Atherton
Tableland, although most interesting in other ways, proved rather
disappointing as regards birds seen. I was told that Brush Turkeys
(.Alectura lathami) were frequently seen crossing the road in jungle
country and that even Cassowaries ( Casuarius casuarius ) were seen
occasionally, but it was not my good luck to see either. In the
actual jungle, bird observation is very difficult, and the only birds
I identified were the Grey Fantail ( Rhipidura Jiabellifera) which was
everywhere ; the Northern Yellow Robin ( Eopsaltria chrysorrhoa ),
which was plentiful ; the Little Tree Creeper ( Climacteris minor)
of which a single example was seen ; and the Red-browed Finch
(. Aegintha temporalis). The call of the Whip-Bird ( Psophodes olivaceus)
was very frequently heard and also the notes of Doves or Pigeons,
without either being seen. At a place called The Jungle at Malanda,
there is a small private zoo and the gem of the collection was a
lovely male Victoria Rifle-Bird ( Ptiloris victoria) in perfect plumage
and very tame. I was also interested to see there five or six examples
of the Spotted Cat-Bird ( Ailurcedus melanotus) , and one of the northern
subspecies of the Crimson Rosella ( Platycercus elegans nigrescens).
On the morning of the third day spent in the district, a visit
was paid to Kuranda and the magnificent Barron Falls, where the
only notable bird observed was a White Goshawk ( Astus nova-
hollandia). The same afternoon a launch trip to a small private
zoo at Brown's Bay did not reveal anything notable except a few
fine Cassowaries, although I was able to identify the White-
throated Honeyeater ( Melithreptus albogularis) and the Varied
Triller ( Lalage leucomela) in the scrub there.
On the fourth day, an all-day launch trip of some seventeen
miles to Green Island, the nearest and most accessible island of
the Great Barrier Reef, was undertaken. The coral and various
other forms of life on the reef were most interesting and the island
a lovely spot, just like the popular conception of a coral island.
The only bird life seen there were numbers of the Grey-breasted
Silver-eye (posterops lateralis).
On the last day spent in Cairns, I endeavoured to locate some
birds in captivity, but the only collection discovered was that of
a Mr. Boden, who had a large collection of Finches and a few
Parrots and also an example of the Woompoo or Magnificent
Fruit-Pigeon ( Megaloprepia magnified) which, unfortunately, was

not in very good condition when I saw it. I had hoped while in
Cairns to possibly discover examples of the Golden-shouldered
Parrot ( Psephotus chrysopterygius) and the Pale Crimson Finch
(.Neochmia albiventer) from the Cape York Peninsula, but was
unsuccessful. I discovered too late that an air service was run
from Cairns to Coen and the Batavia River ; had I known of this
in time, I would have been very tempted to make the trip in the
hope of contacting the birds or someone who knew them.
Townsville again
On the return trip I was met in Townsville by Mr. St. John
Robinson, with the good news that he had located a captive
Cloncurry Parrot ( Barnardius macgillivrayi) ! We forthwith set out
for the home of Mr. K. Carey, the owner of the bird, and it proved
to be a very fine male specimen, which he subsequently was kind
enough to let me have. Mr. Carey had a nice collection of Finches
and Parrots, amongst the latter being a fine pair of Golden-mantled
Rosellas ( Platycercus eximius splendidus). Mr. Carey also knew of
another Cloncurry Parrot at a friend's home nearby, and this
bird we also inspected and it proved to be another male bird. After
we had succeeded in persuading Mr. Carey to part with his bird,
we inspected the birds kept in a few small aviaries in the local
Botanic Gardens, and there, to our surprise, found yet another
Cloncurry Parrot, this time a hen, which Mr. Robinson promised
to try and secure for me. In this he was unsuccessful, but he sub-
sequently obtained another hen bird for me, and from the pair
thus obtained, I succeeded in breeding the species for the first
time in captivity.
After leaving the Botanic Gardens, I was unable to resist
Mr. Robinson's offer of another trip to his Zoo and Sanctuary
(already described), and there I spent a few more interesting hours.
Later on in the afternoon I met another aviculturist, Mr. Palmer
Woolston, who showed me his Banksian Cockatoos ( Calyptorhynchus
banksi ), a fine pair, and his Plumed Pigeons (Lophophaps plumifera)
which were breeding.
Brisbane again
Returning to Brisbane, I went for an all-day trip to Southport,
a distance of some fifty miles. At the Surfer's Paradise Hotel

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.994628710526315" page_id="56314586"  page_num="274" year="" vol="">
there was quite a large private zoo, and although there were a
large number of species of birds and animals exhibited, I did not
note anything particularly unusual or of outstanding interest.
On the beach at Southport I noticed a pair of Terns of a species
not seen in southern waters, but which I was unable to identify
and on the return trip I stopped at a bird shop in a small town
where a few Finches and Parrots were offered for sale, and was
much surprised to find a female Red-sided Eclectus (Lorius pectoralis)
there ! Hoping for a bargain, I asked the price, but when eight
guineas was mentioned, I quickly returned to the car !
The following day I visited the Brisbane Show and found quite
a large number of cage birds on exhibition, amongst them yet
another male Cloncurry Parrot and several Madagascar Love Birds
(.Agapornis cana) and Madagascar Weavers ( Foudia madagascarensis ),
both species being very rare in captivity in the southern states.
I also met Mr. W. Smith, one of the largest exhibitors, and had
an interesting chat with him.
Sydney again
Arriving back in Sydney, I set off for the home of an old friend,
Mr. J. E. Ward, of Balmain. My friend has always been keen on
softbills, and amongst his small but choice collection were a lovely
pair of Amethyst Starlings ( Pholidauges leucogaster) ; a Yellow-tufted
Honeyeater ( Meliphaga melanops) ; numerous Blue Robins (Sialia
sialis) which he is very successful in breeding ; and several of the
rare and attractive Harlequin Bronze-wing Pigeons ( Histriophaps
histrionica) which he has also succeeded in breeding.
My friend then took me to see the collection of Mr. G. Medlyn
Cox at Warrawee, which is very extensive and attractively housed.
Space will prevent the enumeration of many of the birds represented
there, but I must mention some very fine Toucans, a number
of attractive softbills; many of which, in Mr. Cox's unavoidable
absence, we were unable to identify, and amongst the Parrots,
two pairs of Varied Lorikeets ( Psitteuteles versicolor ), and a lovely
pair of very tame Red-vented Blue Bonnets ( Psephotus hamatogaster
hamatorrhous) . We then drove on to Beecroft to see Mr. A. Wachs-
mann, who has since died. He had a nice collection of Australian
Parrots, without including any special rarities ; a large number of
Pheasants, including a number of Peacock Pheasants ( Polyplectron

chinquis) , and a solitary male Edwards' (Gennaus edwardsi) ; several
Kagus (Rhynchcetos juhatus), one of which, "James," is very tame
and always ready to display ; a male Paradise Rifle-Bird ( Ptiloris
paradiseus) , and a male Regent Bower-Bird ( Sericulus chrysocephalus)
in full adult plumage ; and several fine Touracous.
My last visit that day was to the collection of Mr. Hallstrom,
whose main interest is in the larger Parrots and Cockatoos. He
had six or seven pairs of Red and Yellow Macaws (Ara macao ),
several of which breed regularly ; a pair of Blue and Yellow
(A. ararauna), one Red and Blue (A. chloroptera) , and three Illiger's
(A. maracana). Of the Cockatoos he had two Gang-gangs ( Gallo -
cephalon jimbriatum) , one Yellow-tailed Black ( Calyptorhynchus
funereus ), four White-tailed Black (C. baudini ), five or six Banksian
(C. banksi), and a pair of Ducorp's ( Kakatos ducorpsi ), as well as
all the commoner Australian species. Most of the larger Australian
Parrots were represented and there was a very tame Red-vented
Parrot ( Pionus menstruus) , the only one I have ever seen in Australia.
The following morning I again visited Taronga Park, and in
the afternoon the Botanic Gardens, where a few birds are kept,
but the only notable exhibit was a fine Red and Blue Macaw
(Ara chloroptera).

<bodyText confidence="0.984305571428571" page_id="56314587"  page_num="275" year="" vol="">
Back in Melbourne again, I spent an hour or so at the Zoo,
which has always been disappointing from an aviculturist's view-
point, and then drove up to Sherbrooke Forest where I spent an
interesting afternoon in the company of a very tame male Lyre
Bird, watching him feeding and hearing him go through his
repertoire of mimicry several times, but unfortunately not seeing
him dance. He imitated to perfection the notes of the Whip Bird,
Whistler, Grey Thrush, Kookaburra, Magpie, Black Cockatoo,
and Rosella, besides several others that I was unfamiliar with.
While feeding, several White-browed Scrub-Wrens (Sericornis
frontalis) and Yellow Robins ( Eopsaltria australis) were in constant
attendance, picking up small insects which he disdained, but I did
not see the Pilot-Bird (Pycnoptilus floccosus). Several Yellow-tailed
Black Cockatoos (C. funereus) were also seen in the Forest.

of Prey, with which vol. i of the General History commences.
Under CONDOR (p. 6) we read that in December, 1809,
" one was exhibited in Piccadilly alive ; ... this bird was not
very young, having been in the possession of the owner more than
twelve months." The Turkey-Buzzard appears under the name
CARRION VULTURE, V. aura. Linn., which "when taken
young, will often become very tame, if not familiar. Two of them
having been brought alive to England, were given to me, and
inhabited my garden with some degree of cordiality, during one
summer, but an unexpected cold night killed one of them, and
though additional shelter was afforded to the companion, it did
not long survive ". A foot-note says : " M. d'Azara mentions more
than one instance, where the bird would follow its master for
several leagues, when on a journey by flying over his head, and
sleeping at night on the top of his carriage ; and that it is not
infrequent to see these birds about the house like other domestic
animals " (i.e. of course in S. America). The CHINCOU (i.e. the
Occipital Vulture) is described on p. 31 : An example in an
Amsterdam menagerie " when at rest , draws its head into the ruff,
with the bill supported on the crop, and the wings drooping down.
It is a very spiteful bird and may be fed on raw flesh, which it
devours very greedily
The SECRETARY BIRD (i, 40) . . if taken young is easily
tamed, and will mix with the common poultry, feeding on rats,
lizards and even locusts and other insects, rarely attacking the
chickens, except driven thereto from the utmost necessity . . . said
to have been first introduced into England by Captain Purvis . . .
in 1769 ".
EAGLES. Dr. Heysham kept a BALD EAGLE (i.e. the Sea-
Eagle) alive for more than ten years ; its tail did not turn white

till he had had it six or seven years. Colonel Montagu also kept
one for nine years. The GOLDEN EAGLE " abounds at Oren-
burg, and is there exposed for sale, being used for falconry, to take
wolves, foxes, and antelopes ; . . . good birds sell dear . . . often a
horse is given for one, when a sheep will purchase another species ".
Another Eagle mentioned as used for falconry is the NOBLE
EAGLE (i, 144), but I do not know what particular Eagle is meant.
Others mentioned as kept are the JEAN LE BLANC, F. gallicus.
Gm. (i.e. the Short-toed Eagle), and two CROWNED EAGLES,
one of which is Spizaetus coronatus. {Linn) " not uncommon on the
coast of Guinea, from whence one was brought alive to London,
where it survived for some time " ; the other CROWNED EAGLE
is the Crowned Harpy, which is " easily brought up tame, if taken
young ". A tame Harpy Eagle, under the name CARACGA
EAGLE, is mentioned as having been kept for several years in
Madrid.
The mentions of the other Birds of Prey mainly deal with
falconry. Under the FALCON GENUS (i, 44 ), castings are
described and ". . . falconers are so convinced of this discharge
being salutary and necessary, that when they feed their Hawks
with flesh, they intermix pellets of wool or cotton ". Under
COMMON FALCON (i.e. the Peregrine) there is half a page on the
various Hawks used in falconry, and under GOSHAWK three on
falconry in general.
OWLS. Nothing is said about these in captivity except that
Brown Owls will eat any carrion or offal offered them, but Barn
Owls will only take fresh mice, and that Eagle-Owls (and some-
times other species) are occasionally used as a " stale ", by which
fowlers entice small birds into a net.
Pigeons
A number of domestic breeds are described under the STOCK
PIGEON (vii, 3)) and the COLLARED TURTLE (i.e. the
domestic Ring-Dove ( risoria ), is "often kept", as is the SURAT
TURTLE (i.e. Streptopelia suratensis) in India. Other foreign
Pigeons mentioned are the CARIBBEE PIGEON, which has laid
eggs in a cage, and the Jamaican Ring-tailed Pigeon ; the BLUE-
HEADED PIGEON (i.e. Starnoenas) , " may be brought up tame

but will not propagate 55 {vii, 87) ; the NICOBAR PIGEON is
" now and then brought to Europe, but with difficulty passes
through the winter, especially the first season, though by degrees
they become more hardy ; and we have seen them more than
once in England in good condition . . ." {vii, 84). One Fruit-
Pigeon (i.e. Ptilinopus purpuratus, {vii, 63)) " is tamed in the South
Sea Islands and lives on Bananas ", and the GREAT CROWNED
PIGEON (the Goura) is kept among the poultry in the East
Indies and has been brought alive to Europe.
Under DODO {vii, 272) Latham says that the picture in the
British Museum was drawn " we are told ", from a living bird
brought from Mauritius.
Game-Birds
Pheasants are described in vol. vii, the Golden Pheasant as
frequently kept, the HORNED and IMPEYAN (i.e. Tragopans and
Monals) as kept in India, and the FIRE-BACKED (i.e. Lophura
ignita) as having been kept in a Batavia menagerie. Under
DOMESTIC COCK a number of the then known varieties are
described ( 168 ).
PEACOCKS, as well as a white variety, are commonly
domesticated, and the IRIS PEACOCK (a Polyplectron) is said
to be occasionally brought to Europe. There are four pages on
the TURKEY and two Guinea-fowl are mentioned as being kept.
Francolins " may be kept in aviaries " and Partridges can be
hatched under and reared by domestic hens and are said to occasion-
ally pair with a domestic cock. The GUERNSEY PARTRIDGE
(i.e. the Redleg) " is bred in menageries", and QUAIL are caught
in thousands and sent in cages to London. A Roulroul was shown
alive at Exeter Change {333) and the LUZONIAN OUAIL
(i.e. one of the Button-Quails) is said to be often kept tame in the
Philippines and for fighting in the East. Incidentally it is stated
that Hazel Grouse were kept in the old Roman days for the
Emperors.

kept tame in S. America ; they are said to be " quarrelsome
and often killing not only fowls, but Turkies, and will follow the
inhabitants, especially the negroes pecking their legs and not
infrequently till they bleed. The flesh is reckoned as good as that
of a Pheasant ". In a footnote one is mentioned which was kept
tame in Surrey, which once accompanied the hounds and kept
up with them for three miles.
CURASSOWS. The CRESTED CURASSOW is " frequently
brought up tame (in S. America) and breeds freely in the
Menageries of Holland The RED CURASSOW has been in
English collections and Latham saw one RAZOR-BILLED C. at
a Piccadilly dealer's.
SCREAMERS, etc. The CHAJA SCREAMER (i.e. the
Crested Screamer, Chauna torquata) is described as a tame species
which may be domesticated with the poultry ; the BRAZILIAN
CARIAMA (i.e. Cariama cristata. (.Linn )) is also said to be kept in
its own country : " young birds may be domesticated and in this
state will eat meat, but refuse maize or any kind of grain " {ix, 13).
The FAITHFUL JACANA is the Berbian Screamer, Chauna
chavaria. {Linn) and is kept by the natives of S. America with
their poultry, which " this faithful shepherd defends against birds
of prey, ... it never deserts the charge committed to its care,
bringing them all home safe at night. It is so tame as to suffer
itself to be handled by a grown person, but will not permit children
to attempt the same ".

domestic Goose ; BRENT and CANADA Geese are often kept, as
is the BARRED-HEADED GOOSE. The NEW HOLLAND
CEREOPSIS has a plate in vol. ix, and is described as becoming
tame and familiar.
The MALLARD, the origin of the Domestic Duck, has ten
pages allotted to it (x, 286), the WIGEON has been bred in
captivity and crossed with other ducks, the POCHARD is some-
times seen in captivity, the FALCATED DUCK has been brought
alive to England and the PINK-HEADED DUCK is often kept
tame in India. Two WHISTLING DUCKS are described as
having been kept ; the RED-BILLED (i.e. Dendrocygna autumalis)
as commonly kept in S. America and occasionally seen alive in our
menageries ; it is said to have been bred in an aviary in Sweden ;
the other is the BLACK-BILLED WHISTLING DUCK ( arborea ),
an example of which Latham received alive from Jamaica and
kept in his garden for some time. Tame MUSCOVY DUCKS are
also mentioned. The SUMMER DUCK Latham says is kept
tame in China, and often brought to England (x, 361), but under
this name he apparently includes both the Carolina and Mandarin
Ducks. Unsuccessful attempts to domesticate the GOLDEN-EYE
are mentioned.
The use of CORMORANTS for fishing by the Chinese is
mentioned, and the WHITE PELICAN is " said to be sometimes
used for domestic fishing in the same manner ... by the Chinese ".
Latham once saw a tame one in a travelling exhibition in England
(x, 397)- The plate (*, 93) of the CHINESE DIVER shows a bird
with a metal ring round its neck, as if also used for fishing, but
the author doubts whether this addition is not a mistake.
Three Rails are mentioned as having been kept in confine-
ment ; The PURPLE GALLINULE (ix, 423), which is Porphyrio
porphyrio , stated to be kept everywhere in Sicily, for their beauty
and also in Egypt, where they are called " Sultanas " ; they are
easily tamed when taken young. " A pair kept in an aviary in
France made a nest of small sticks mixed with straw and laid
six eggs, but . . . they came to nothing." The MARTINICO
GALLINULE (i.e. Porphyriola martinica) " has frequently been
brought alive to England, as it bears confinement well and is pretty
tame, though never so as to be at large " (417). Buffon mentions

28l
a SPOTTED GALLINULE (i.e. the Spotted Crake) which was
kept tame.
Three Ibises also have mention in this connection, as kept in
their native countries and occasionally brought to Europe ; the
SCARLET IBIS, the BALD IBIS (i.e. Geronticus calvus , of Africa,
and the WHITE-HEADED IBIS, which is the Painted Wood-
Stork, Ibis leucopcephalus. {Penn).
The two Storks are the BLACK {ix, 52), one of which Colonel
Montagu kept among his aquatic birds with which it lived in
perfect amity, would take food from his hand, and preferred eels
to anything else, and the AMERICAN STORK (i.e. the Maguari
Stork of S. America, one of which once lived at the Exeter Change,
London (55). The Marabou Storks, under the name GIGANTIC
CRANE, is also stated to have been kept tame in Sierra Leone.
Demoiselle Cranes are " frequently kept in menageries and
bear confinement well, in so much as to breed in that state, for
we are told that six were at one time in a menagerie at Versailles,
and that one of them, which had been produced there, lived
twenty-four years ; it is endowed with great gentleness of manners
and sometimes puts itself into elegant attitudes, at others into
strange and uncouth ones, especially such as imitate dancing, and
Keysler mentions one, ... at Florence, which had been taught
to dance to a certain tune ".
RUFFS are the only Waders with captivity mention and then
only as preparation for the table ; we told they are caught in
great numbers and fattened for the table on " bread and milk
mixed with hempseed, with sometimes boiled wheat and frequently
sugar added, by which means in a fortnight's time they will become
a lump of fat, and will fetch from two shillings to half-a-crown
each " {ix, 14J).
This about finishes Latham's avicultural diversions from the
straight ornithological path. He himself had kept a few birds
we have seen, and was inquisitive about all. Particularly apt
is his description of the " writhing " hen Red-headed Finch
disturbed on her nest (whoever has kept Cutthroats knows all
about that), and the " cordiality " of the Turkey Buzzards he had
for a time is a distinctly pleasing touch.

For the past few years it has been my hobby to import to
Tahiti birds from different parts of the world and liberate them.
Up to the present time I have received and liberated about 7,000
birds of fifty-nine different species.
On one of my various trips to the United States I had the good
fortune to be able to collect among other birds, ten Western
Bluebirds which I brought back with me in August, 1938.
When these birds first arrived they went into a very severe
moult. Some of the birds lost a great many feathers at one time
and in one instance a hen was unable to fly at all. Eventually
they came into feather and I liberated them in October, which is
our spring.
In March, 1939, one pair showed some signs of wanting to
build. In fact they took a small amount of nesting material to
a nest box, but never completed the nest.
On 27th October, a pair started to build again in a nest box
in my rose garden, and were observed to be mating and the male
bird to be offering his mate food. On nth November the hen
was sitting on five eggs, but was noticed during the period of
incubation to be leaving the nest continually. On investigating
the nest, 27th November, I found the eggs to be clear and destroyed
them. It is my opinion that the location that they had chosen,
which was exposed all day to the sun, was much too hot and for
that reason the eggs were spoiled.
On 2nd December this pair of birds started to build once again
in another nest box which was located in a pepper tree and well
shaded. The hen was sitting by the 10th December and on

16th four strong healthy young birds left the nest and by the
4th February were fending for themselves. The old birds commenced
to moult on the 13th February. On 18th February I noticed that
the young birds were starting to come into colour. It is now the
first week in April and this little family of six come regularly
every morning and evening to my whistle to receive meal worms,
and they make many trips to the feeding stations during the day.
In all there are now ten of these lovely birds about my place,
and I am hoping for some really worth while results this coming
breeding season.
I feel that I have had a fair amount of success with my experi-
ment of liberating foreign birds, inasmuch as there are about thirty
species represented at my feeding stations daily. Of these twenty-
three kinds have reproduced themselves at liberty, to my knowledge.
Among these are Crimson-backed, Blue, Mrs. Wilson's, and
Euphonia Tanagers ; Yellow-winged Sugarbirds, Parrot and
Tri-coloured Parrot Finches, as well as many of the beautiful
African and Australian Waxbills and Finches. I have liberated
about 700 Gouldians, but there are only a few that stay about
the place ; they seem to prefer some locality which I have been
unable to locate, but I feel that it will be a matter of only a short
time before they will be seen in large quantities, as they do well
here and are good breeders. I have just received a new shipment
of 100 and am hoping that they may attract some of the birds at
liberty before they are liberated.
There are about fifty Orange Bishops about the place and the
males, at the present time in full colour, are a brilliant addition
to the landscape.

News has been received that Captain Jean Delacour and his mother,
Madame T. Delacour, are alive and well; also there is some hope that Cleres
may not have been entirely destroyed.
Dispersal of the Whitley Collection, Paignton.
The news that the war has meant the dispersal of Mr. Whitley's wonderful
collection at Paignton must have been a real shock to all who know it, even in
the midst of these troublous times. What a number of rarities it has contained !
The years most of them (generally so fragile elsewhere) have lived in perfect
health there ! What a marvellous breeding record, had it ever been made public !
All members of our Society and science generally must share in the regret at this
loss to Zoology, but may we console ourselves with the hope (however faint)
that Mr. Whitley may now have time to give us a full history of the collection,
or at least a complete list of the rarities it has contained, and of those which have
been bred.
Edinburgh Zoo
We learn from the Annual Report of the Zoological Society of Scotland that
a pair of Blue and Yellow Macaws (Ara ararauna) nested in a hollow log in the
large Parrot aviary. The first clutch of two were infertile, but two more eggs,
laid in September, produced two young, which grew rapidly. During the winter
the younger (hatched ten days after the other) died, but the other was successfully
reared.
The breeding season of the King Penguins at Edinburgh was not so successful
last summer as usual. Only five eggs were laid and two chicks hatched, both of
which died at an early age.
Six pairs of Gentoo Penguins nested and had eggs, six chicks being hatched
and five reared to the first moult.
The death is recorded of " Ann ", one of the founders of the fine colony of
King Penguins at Edinburgh. She arrived in January, 1914, when at least two
years old, so that at the time of her death she must have been at least twenty-
eight. She was not only the mother of the first chick hatched in the park but of
many others in later years. " Ann " laid an egg last summer but it was not
fertile, and at the time of her death last August she was rearing a chick of another
Penguin that had deserted her egg.
This historic bird has been preserved and will be displayed, together with the
chick she was rearing and her first chick which died when five years old, in the
Fellows' Room.

The President is much gratified that members of the
Avicultural Society have undoubtedly responded to their
utmost to his appeal, and many have secured new members.
It is hoped that this support will be continued and that the
Society will thereby be upheld during this, one of the most
crucial, period of its existence. There have, however,
inevitably been a number of resignations and many overseas
members are unable to forward their subscriptions. During
1940, despite great difficulties, the Magazine has been
maintained at its pre-war standard, and it is our aim that
this standard should not be lowered. With the fall in income
and rise in cost of production, however, it is essential that
economy should be made. It is therefore proposed to publish
the Magazine every second month, compressing two months
into one issue. The January-February number will be
published on 1st February and so on. The Editor will be
glad to have the views of members on this suggestion.
The President again appeals for all possible financial
support and reminds members that without their subscrip-
tions the Magazine cannot be continued and the future of
aviculture may be seriously harmed. It is also earnestly
requested that subscriptions should be paid early in January.
Under the present exceptional conditions it is proposed
that the Council and Officers should remain unchanged for
the coming year.

The coloured plate represents the melanistic form of Stella's
Lory (Charmosyna stellae Meyer), which was originally described
by Lord Rothschild in 1898 as Charmosyna atrata , from Mt.
Scratchley, New Guinea ; its name to-day would presumably
be Ch. stellae atrata , that is if a colour-phase (? sport) is now
allowed a name.
This, however, need not trouble us here and we can get on to
its avicultural interest ; this is limited but definite. As far as
I know, this form has only been imported alive once and that
was in 1933, when Shaw Mayer brought four examples of this
black form and thirteen of the normal (red) form. Of these two
each of both forms went to Messrs. Ezra and Whitley, and the
rest of the normal birds to the Zoo and elsewhere. Mr. Ezra's
two " atrata " were still alive in the following August as well as
one of his normal birds ; both Mr. Whitley's black birds died
very soon, but he still had one normal one a year later and I think
this bird lived at Paignton for years.
The normal red stellae was first imported in 1909 when Mr.
Goodfellow brought one or two for Mr. Brook, who bred them
in the following year, described them as " easily bred ", and gave
a good plate in Bird Notes for 1910 (p. 65). The same collector
also brought some more in 1925. In Mivart's LORIES Plate 58
shows this species.

SOME PARROT-LIKE BIRDS AT STERREBEEK

<bodyText confidence="0.997529457142857" page_id="56314608"  page_num="288" year="" vol="">
Now that the ban on the importation of Psittacine birds into
this country has been in force for some ten years, we may, perhaps,
be able to judge of its effects, impossible though it is to say what
the position would have been if it had never been imposed.
I think we may say that the three main results have been
the great increase in the keeping of Parrakeets, the very considerable
progress made in the technique of keeping and breeding them
and the absurd levels to which the price of quite common Parrot-like
birds has risen.
As Belgium was one of the few countries where no such ban
was imposed, the result was, not a severe plague of psittacosis, but
merely that prices went down and all sorts of very interesting
Psittacine birds turned up, in spite of the absence of specialist
collectors such as we had here.
In Holland the ban was removed in early 1939 or even in
1 938--I forget exactly when--but when it was in force, some birds
were taken in, I was told, through Belgium, being carried by men
over the frontier at a spot where, owing to the marshy nature of
the ground and the foggy state of the atmosphere, the Customs
and other frontier officials, for reasons of health, did not care to
linger in the night air.
In Germany, so I heard, some Parrot-like birds were smuggled
in by being concealed in crates containing lions. The ill-mannered
' curiosity of Customs officials is said to diminish noticeably when
it comes to inspecting crates containing lions.
I do not doubt that the scheme would work well, but it is
easy to see that it would be inconvenient if, every time you
wanted to send someone a Parrot, you were obliged to get a lion
to go with it.
In 1937, Dr. Derscheid bought from one of the Brussels dealers
a pair of Parrots ; they were of the genus Pionus but nobody
knew what they were until we identified them from Salvadori's
Catalogue of Birds of the British Museum as the Cobalt Parrot (.Pionus
cobaltinus )--a species previously known, I believe, only by one
skin at the British Museum.

J. YE ALL AND-SOME PARROT-LIKE BIRDS AT STERREBEEK 289
They rather resembled the Blue-headed (P. menstruus ), but
were considerably smaller ; the blue was a rather dull cobalt,
decidedly more blue than that of the head and neck of the Blue-
headed and extending to the under tail-coverts instead of giving
way to green from the breast downwards, while the green of the
wings was brighter and more yellowish.
There were, of course, some minor differences, but these I
cannot accurately remember.
As with other members of the genus, the sexes were similar.
The birds, which were subsequently given to Lord Tavistock,
seemed to be young, but I have seen them since, and have not
noticed any difference in their coloration.
At about the same time we received three Maximilian's Parrots
(P. maximiliani) ; these were not in good feather, but soon improved.
About a year later we got rid of them, having no aviary to spare ;
they were rather handsome birds, and would look well in an
aviary, but in cages we found them uninteresting.
We also had three Muller's Parrakeets (Tanygnathus sumatranus) ;
one was of a considerably lighter green than the others, but this
was, I think, just an individual variation. Another was quite
tame and friendly, though not agreeing at all with the others ;
it was a curiously solemn bird, and though it was pleased to receive
human company, the only sign of emotion it gave was to dilate
and contract the pupil of its eye. It was with equal gravity that
it sometimes counted to five in French, being, however, at times
deceived by its memory and getting the numbers mixed.
We did not try them in an aviary, and after about a year they
were sold, as they were not very interesting as cage birds, nor,
I believe, suited to cage life ; all the same, I was sorry to see
the going of that droll fellow.
Another of the same genus was a $ Great-billed Parrakeet
(T. megolorhynchus )---a good specimen, but like the few other
newly-imported ones I have seen, its flight feathers were badly
formed, though the body and tail feathers were normal.
It is, no doubt, that these strictly arboreal birds, feeding on
fruits, fruit seeds, and berries, do not take readily to dry seeds,
and the trouble is nutritional.
This bird had the curious habit of making the characteristic
unholy call, a loud and alarming noise, in the night.

2 go J. YEALLAND-SOME PARROT-LIKE BIRDS AT STERREBEEK
We received one day a pair of Parrots, terribly short of feathers,
but just recognizable as Aubry's Parrot (P otocephalus aubryanus).
A few weeks of good treatment and shower baths made good
specimens of them, and we did not find them difficult to keep.
A Brown-necked Parrot (P. fuscicollis ) was another interesting
arrival ; it was tame and gentle, and altogether a nice cage bird.
Three Blue-rumped Parrots ( Psittinus incertus) arrived one
morning ; they were not exactly tame, but were very quiet, and
it seemed that the only movements they made were to the food
and water dishes and back to the perches, where they would
remain as if deep in thought until hunger prompted them to move
again--indeed, it might be said of them, as the boy wrote of
Esquimeaux, that they have no habits.
As we expected, they were extremely sensitive to the least
cold ; we also found them very hard to persuade to eat anything
but sunflower seed and it was, no doubt, due to this that all three
died within years from enlarged livers.
In 1938, we procured three young of the handsome Slatey-
headed Parrakeet (P. schisticeps ) ; they were in poor condition,
and although two quickly grew new feathers, the plumage of the
third was extremely poor, and the bird subsequently died.
The two proved to be a pair, and by this year they would have
been old enough to breed.
The species is, to my mind, prettier than the Plum-headed,
its near relative, and I hope that it will eventually become well
established in collections ; I feel sure that it would prove easy to
breed, though so far only hybrids between it and the Plum-headed
have been obtained in England.
The Tabuan Parrakeet (Pyrrhulopsis tabuensis), one of the
beautiful Shining Parrakeets, has for some years been a great rarity
Two were received at " Armendy " in, I believe, 1935, and
were still thriving when last I saw them at the end of 1939. They
are considered by some to be difficult to keep, but these two were
never otherwise than in perfect health and plumage, spending
the summer in an outdoor aviary and the winter in a large indoor
flight.
They did well on the usual Parrakeet seed mixure with a variety
of fruit, green-food, carrot, and an occasional mealworm. They
were very tame, and would alight on one's shoulder, while visitors

J. YEALLAND SOME PARROT-LIKE BIRDS AT STERREBEEK 29 1
were always received with every sign of pleasure and the greatest
excitement.
We never knew the sex of them, as their heads and beaks were
exactly intermediate in size between those of male and female.
They had a strange dislike of rain, but would be satisfied as long
as their heads were in the dry--one would see them with their
heads under a projecting piece of roof beam or put inside the
entrance hole of the nesting log, while the remainder of the bird
would be quite exposed to the rain.
In early 1939, we received from Holland two male Pesquet's
Parrots (.Dasyptilis pesqueti ). They were in a very sticky state, and
one was ill on arrival, but despite immediate hospital treatment, it
died the next day. The other, a rather poor specimen, had a
defective foot, which we partially cured in time, and the bird lived
some months.
A female brought by Mr. Frost had been in the collection
some time, and was in excellent condition until its sudden end,
when it fell dead while climbing on the roof of its cage. A peculiar
thing about these frugivorous Parrots is that the bill of the female
is quite weak, while that of the male is altogether stronger and
stouter and capable of biting very hard.
They are, of course, very delicate and sensitive to the least
cold ; they seem to do well on banana, grapes, and a little Lory
food. As a change from banana we sometimes gave stewed
unsweetened pear, which was well received, but various soft
fruits were not touched.
At about the same time five Porphyry-crowned Lorikeets
(Glossopsitta porphyrocephala) arrived. They were, it seemed, quite
young, but they had evidently been badly fed, for all were ill,
and one died in a fit the same evening, while another had several
fits, but lived a little longer.
We could not find out how they had been fed, for, bad though
it must have been, we might have saved them by getting them
gradually on to something better instead of changing the diet
suddenly at so critical a time. As it was, they ate a little food
and the juice of grapes, but in four or five days all but one
had died.
It was really tragic to lose such rare and pretty little Lorikeets ;
I had not seen them since some eight or nine years before, when

292 J. YE ALL AND-SOME PARROT-LIKE BIRDS AT STERREBEEK
Lord Tavistock had a pair which nested, but lost the young at an
early age.
The Little Hanging Parrot (Loriculus pusillus) is dainty and
pretty in a quiet way.
The three which had been in the collection some little time
were always terribly wild ; they were also fastidious about their
appearance, keeping themselves very clean and, it seemed, never
having a single barbule of a feather disarranged.
I remember them especially for the charming little song which
the male would sometimes render during the quiet of the late
afternoon.
The song, a melancholy but not unmusical arrangement of a
few Finch-like notes, was scarcely audible at more than a few
yards distant.
The Golden-fronted New Zealand Parrakeet (Cyanorhamphus
auriceps ) might be described as an exciting bird. We see in the
species a combination surely unique in captive birds--that they
will generally breed with the utmost readiness, will die with the
same facility and, one may remark, they do not in the least mind
which they do.
In captivity the bird has very little resistance to disease, and it
seems likely that it is the same in nature, unless natural enemies
cause high mortality, for otherwise the species would surely have
become extremely common.
It may be that they are generally either kept too warm, which
certainly makes them " soft ", or are kept on ground that is not
sufficiently fresh and clean, for they are always picking about on
the ground so may very readily contract some illness by ingestion.
In the spring of 1938, two pairs arrived from New Zealand ;
they had evidently been well cared for on the voyage, for they
were in excellent condition, and when we put them into aviaries
about six weeks later they nested at once, one pair rearing four
young ones and the other five. With these and others already in
the collection, a good breeding stock was made up.
If these birds were liberated when Belgium was invaded in
the spring of this year, it is possible that they would survive at
liberty, being rather clever at finding food, but I fear that a few
days of frost or snow would be the end of them, and so I like to
think that perhaps they would go southward.

J. YEALLAND - SOME PARROT-LIKE BIRDS AT STERREBEEK 293
It is amusing to see these vivacious little Parrakeets when they
have young ; they run here and there eating a little of this food
and that, all in the most feverish haste and excitement, as if the
welfare of the family depended on the activities of the next five
seconds.
I think the most attractive Parrots I have ever seen were the
pair of Kea Parrots (,Nestor notabilis ) in Dr. Derscheid's collection.
It is well known that the species is of a high order of intelligence
and I consider that character and intelligence in a bird are more
to be desired than beauty and rarity--at least in the matter of
entertainment value !
The $ was, I believe, quite tame from the first, but the $ was
shy, going to the darkest corner of the shelter when anyone came
near.
She was, however, so fond of mealworms that it was easy to
teach her to come to the front of the aviary for them--a matter of
regret to the &amp;lt;J, no doubt, as she would drive him away so that he
was obliged to eat his share in furtive haste. A mealworm offered
in the clenched hand would soon be hooked out by a long upper
mandible after the fingers has been parted by a sideways move-
ment of the mandibles.
These very inquisitive birds would try any kind of food, thriving
on carrot, monkey nuts, a little bread, apple, sunflower seed and,
at various times of the year, many kinds of berries, fruit, acorns,
nuts, and green-food.
They would sometimes catch and eat a Sparrow, and they
were fond of mice, but did not like beef fat. Carrot or apple would
be eaten by being impaled on the upper mandible, and grated with
the lower--in fact, the feet were rarely used to hold anything.
I think they might eventually have nested, as the $ went often
into the nest, and seemed to be in breeding condition.
I often wonder what has happened to those delightful birds.
I think they would survive at liberty, living on roots, leaf buds, and
so on, but it would be their curiosity that would be their undoing,
and I fear that they might be shot if they wandered from the
village.

A. LENDON-THE AUSTRALIAN GRASS-PARRAKEETS
THE AUSTRALIAN GRASS-PARRAKEETS
[Genus Neophema)
By Alan Lendon, F.R.C.S., Captain, Australian Army Medical
Corps, latterly of Adelaide, South Australia
On Saturday, 29th June, 1940, the acting President of the
Avicultural Society of South Australia (Mr. E. L. Atkinson),
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.996436548387097" page_id="56314614"  page_num="294" year="" vol="">
formally handed over to the President of the Royal Zoological
Society of South Australia (Mr. J. H. Goose) a group of seven
aviaries which had been erected in the grounds of the Adelaide
Zoological Gardens in memory of Ronald Minchin, the former
director of the Zoo, whose untimely death in February last has
been recorded in this Magazine. The cost of these aviaries was
covered by the subscriptions of members of the Avicultural Society
of S.A. amongst whom Ron Minchin had had many friends, he
having been president of the Society for two years as well as a
valued member of the committee for many more years. The
aviaries were specially designed for the exhibition and breeding
of the Australian Grass-Parrakeets [Genus Neophema ) of which
Minchin had been particularly fond ; in fact, he had been largely
instrumental in the re-establishment of several of the species in
captivity. The aviaries consist of seven parallel flights, each
1 oft. 6 in. long, 3 ft. 6 in. wide, and 7 feet high, with shelters
3 ft. 6 in. square at the rear of each, the front of the shelters being
two-thirds enclosed. On the day of the official opening, each
aviary contained a pair of each of the seven known species of the
genus, almost certainly the only occasion that a true pair of each
species has ever been exhibited in any collection, private or public,
anywhere in the world. The aviaries face north and are
partially shaded by a large tree at the east end of the block.
It may not be inappropriate to record at this time what may
well be called the re-discovery of the Grass-Parrakeets which has
occurred approximately in the decade 1925-1934. Unfortunately,
the writer has not at the moment access to certain notes and
sources of information, so that the dates given may not be strictly
accurate.

in the Adelaide Zoo for some considerable time about the year
1915, they shared a quaint octagonal aviary with several of the
smaller Conures and apparently never bred. The only other
example I knew of at that time was a single specimen in the
possession of the late Ernest Whitington. The species then
disappeared as an aviary bird until about 1927 when S. Harvey
secured his first pair, although I believe the late Dr. Macgillivray,
of Broken Hill, had kept a few in captivity in the intervening years
and knew of their habitat in that district. I remember Minchin
telling me how he had been shown a very poor specimen of a
Bourke, apparently a feather-plucker, not long before Harvey
secured his, and how excited he had been at seeing it. The later
history of this species is well known ; Harvey bred it not long
^fter securing his first examples, and since then it has been
extensively bred in Australia, England, and America, till at the
present time it ranks second only to the Budgerigar amongst the

captivity. Unfortunately, too many wild Bourke's are still being
trapped each year, seeing that good aviary-bred stock is always
available at a very reasonable price.
The Blue-winged Grass-Parrakeet (JV. chry so stoma ).--My
early acquaintance with this species dates back to 1915 when I
saw three or four examples of this species exhibited in the Botanic
Gardens at Launceston, Tasmania. It appears to have been kept
at times by a few Tasmanian aviculturists since then, but not until
the early years of this decade did South Australian aviculturists
manage to obtain a few specimens from Tasmania. Most of these
did not thrive and, later, specimens were trapped locally and in
1935 the species was bred both by S. Harvey and the Adelaide
Zoo. Strangely enough, it has not been as prolific a breeder in
Australia as it appears to be in England and only a few further
breedings have been recorded to my knowledge in South Australia.
It is still common in South Australia in the wild state at certain
times of the year, particularly in the south-eastern districts, and
the writer has seen a skin collected in the west coast district which
has not hitherto been included in its known range. Whether the
species migrates to Southern Victoria and Tasmania to breed, as
has been popularly supposed for years, is still undecided ; I cannot
recall offhand a record of its nesting in South Australia.

The Elegant Grass-Parrakeet (JV. elegans ).--The writer was
for short periods the proud owner of two pairs of these lovely
little Parrakeets about the time of the last war and apart from a
few individuals which I had seen wild in the Victor Harbour
district of South Australia, I had never seen any other examples
of the species. It appears to have been reintroduced into South
Australian Aviculture in the late nineteen-twenties largely due to
Dr. W. Hamilton's observations of the species in the wild state,
and it has remained a familiar aviary bird there since. It is still
quite common in the wild state in many parts of South Australia
and the writer knows a district about thirty miles from Adelaide
where it can almost always be observed. Unfortunately, it too
is still being trapped far too freely considering that aviary-bred
examples can nearly always be procured nowadays.
The Rock Grass-Parrakeet (jV. petrophila ).--The first examples
of this species that I ever saw were shown to me by Mr. H. Manfield
in the Adelaide Zoo nursery late in 1935, they were not on exhibition
in the Gardens at that time. Shortly after this, Ron Minchin
presented me with a pair, one of which, a female, is still in my
possession. It appears to have been unknown as an aviary bird
in South Australia until about a year prior to this when Minchin
identified some in a dealer's shop which had been assumed to be
Elegants. Since then fairly large numbers have been trapped
annually in South Australia, where it is extremely common along
most of the coastline. Being rather dull in plumage and stodgy
in disposition, it has never become very popular as an aviary
bird and I know of only two occasions on which it has been
successfully bred.
The Orange-bellied Grass Parrakeet (jV. chrysogastra ).--No
living man knows as much about the habits of this species, either
in the wild state or in captivity, as does Dr. W. Hamilton, of
Adelaide, though unfortunately he has not yet succeeded in
breeding the species in captivity, an honour which he well deserves.
I would refer my readers to his article in the Avicultural
Magazine of 1938, No. 8, for his observations on the species.
Before leaving Australia early this year I had only once possessed
an example of this species, an immature one which I had picked
out from amongst a number of young Elegants in a dealer's shop
and which had been trapped not more than fifteen miles from

Adelaide. This bird I gave to the Adelaide Zoo where there was
at that time a fine adult male, the first ever exhibited there, but
my bird did not survive long enough to attain adult plumage.
Since leaving home a pair of this species, undoubtedly the rarest
of the genus at the present time, has been secured for my collection
through the kind offices of Mr. H. Manfield and I am hoping
to be able to see them in the not too distant future.
The Turquoise Grass Parrakeet (N. pulchella ). -- Turquoisines,
as they are usually called, were unknown to aviculturists for many
years and were generally considered to be approaching extinction
until about 1925 when a few came into the hands of some Sydney
aviculturists. Soon after this S. Harvey secured his first specimens
and quickly succeeded in breeding them and has done so fairly
consistently ever since, though they are not as free breeders in
his hands, nor indeed in most people's, as is the next species.
In fact, individual experiences with them differ greatly, some
finding them easy to keep and breed while others find them
difficult to keep alive for any length of time. Like so many of
the genus, far too many are still being illicitly trapped in New
South Wales. This is the only member of the genus which does
not occur in South Australia and for that reason I am unfamiliar
with it in the native state.
The Scarlet-chested Grass Parrakeet (N. splendida ).---The
re-discovery of this lovely little bird, hitherto practically unknown
to aviculture, occurred about 1931 or 1932, speaking from memory,
when about a dozen examples were obtained by an Adelaide
dealer. I well remember Minchin saying that one of the thrills
of his avicultural career was when the first Splendid was obtained
by him for the Adelaide Zoo. Harvey succeeded in breeding
them quite soon after obtaining his first birds and since that time
they have been bred very freely in South Australia, though strangely
enough, very rarely in the other States where aviculturists find
them difficult to keep alive. I do not consider that there are two
subspecies as is frequently stated to be the case, as cocks with
scarlet extending right down to the abdomen and hens with
orange on the abdomen occur quite frequently amongst consign-
ments of what may be called normally marked birds. Last year
( 1 939 ) an irruption of this species occurred near Wynbring on
the East-West railway and a very great number were trapped,

not less than five hundred at a conservative estimate, and probably
nearer a thousand birds. The resultant flooding of the market
brought the price down to about thirty shillings a pair in Adelaide
whereas previously it had never been less than eight pounds !
It was further stated that in addition to those reaching Adelaide,
a number were also sent to Perth and I think this is quite probable.
It is a tragedy that such large numbers of a supposedly rare species
should be trapped when plenty of aviary-bred specimens are
available in Adelaide.

THE COBALT PARROT

The Cobalt Parrot is a species so rare that only the type
specimen (a skin from Massena's collection, one century old,
preserved in the British Museum) was known to science. In 1937
Dr. J. M. Derscheid had the exceptional good fortune to secure
a live pair of this rare South American Parrot, which he presented
to the Duke of Bedford, then Marquess of Tavistock. The plumage
of the adult bird has never been described scientifically and Dr.
Derscheid had made notes which were to have been composed
into an article. Unfortunately the fate of Dr. Derscheid's notes
is now unknown and there is every possibility they were destroyed
during the German invasion of Belgium. The following account
has been written by Mr. F. Gorman, aviary attendant to the
Duke of Bedford, by kind permission of the Duke :--
A pair of these interesting and extremely rare little Parrots
arrived at the Duke of Bedford's collection about three years ago.
They were rather nervous at first, and were treated as semi-hardy
birds. They did, in fact, appear to be happiest in a temperature
of 70 to 75 degrees. Last winter, however, I kept them in an
outdoor aviary with a flight 8 ft. by 23 ft. by 8 ft. high. The weather
was very cold, below freezing point for long periods, and sometimes
below zero. Only on the coldest days were they given a small
paraffin lamp, and then only as a precautionary measure and

not because they appeared uncomfortable. They have lost their
nervousness and have become very friendly, but I am afraid that,
unlike most parrot-like birds, there is a large measure of " cupboard
love The greedy little things lose interest in everything else
when new food is placed before them.
The food given includes : Canary, white millet, wheat, oats,
whole maize, hemp, sunflower, and peanuts ; fruit, mostly apple
and bread and milk ; green food and twiggy branches of deciduous
trees are seldom touched.
Though not good flyers, one that escaped some time ago cleared
high trees and was found some hours later in a garden half a mile
away. The owner of the garden had no difficulty in catching
him by offering food. Last season the hen took some interest in
a log nest which she cut out to her liking, but no eggs were laid.
If not among the most beautiful of birds these intelligent little
creatures should make excellent pets, and, I imagine, would do
well in cages. As far as I can see they have no vices, and the call
is not loud.
Many people mistake them for the Blue-headed Parrot (Pionus
menstruus ), a much larger species.
There is one other point, when these birds first arrived, I had
much trouble in driving them into the shelter at nights and they
were equally chary about coming out in the mornings. The cause
was thick perches and when these were changed for perches about
 |in. diameter the trouble ended.

A few notes to supplement Mr. Gorman's interesting account
of the two " Cobalt Parrots " in his charge may be of interest.
As is stated, till now this Parrot was only known from a single
specimen, that is, the one described by Souance as long ago as
1854. This bird Salvadori dealt with in volume xx of the British
Museum Catalogue (1891) in a footnote (p. 324) under Pionus
menstruus , the Red-vented Parrot ; here he gives a full description
and the habitat as Colombia, but says that as the specimen is
obviously a young bird from its red frontal band he can
give no definite opinion as to its exact status. In his further notes
on the Parrots in the Ibis for 1906, the Count has nothing further

to add. Both Ridgway {Birds of jV* and Middle America, vol. vii,
1916) and Peters in his recent Check-List {vol. Hi, p. 214, 1937)
both make cobaltinus merely a synonym of menstruus, the range of
which (as given by Peters) is stated to be the greater part of
Tropical South America north as far as Costa Rica in Central
America. These two birds Mr. Gorman tells us about should help
to settle the standing of cobaltinus, which I should imagine will
be given a step in rank, at least to a sub-species. Nowadays surely
a species with such an extensive range as menstruus must have been
divided into sub-species, if it is to be in line with the rest.
A possible earlier arrival may have been a bird in the big
collection of South American birds brought for Mr. E. J. Brook
of Hoddam Castle during the Great War by Mr. Goodfellow.
I remember helping Mr. Astley and others unpack the birds on
their arrival at the Zoo ; among them was a very blue P. menstruus
and Mr. Astley suggested that this must or might be cobaltinus,
and I also remember he hoped that eventually the bird would
be seen by some authority, but I fear this hope was not realized,
as after the birds went on to their new home in Scotland, nothing
further was heard about this particular bird.

As I was short of aviaries, I put a male green-winged Parrakeet
in a small aviary with a female Queen Alexandra Parrakeet. As
they seemed to be very friendly I put in a nest box in their sleeping
quarters. They laid four eggs by the 24th April, but these eggs
were all infertile. I removed these eggs, and replaced them by
five Barraband eggs, as these Barrabands never reared their
young. On 19th May three young were hatched, and these were
all successfully reared. The birds were fed on mixed seed, dandelion
leaves, and apple. The birds would not touch any other green
food. The three young ones left the nest on the 25th June.

SOME WAR-TIME BREEDING RESULTS

I am writing this article at the request of the Editor for the
Parrot number of the Avicultural Magazine, though I fear that
long hours of national service plus a greatly depleted staff and
a stock of birds cut down to the minimum has rather put avicultural
matters into the background--let us hope for the time being only.
We have tried to keep a nucleus of all our rarest birds (which
were so temptingly easy to sell at a reduced price even until quite
recently) because one always hopes that even a war such as
this may, one day, end and because a fresh stock of them will
be in the future probably even more difficult to obtain than it
was in the past--and that is saying a good deal !

I suppose the most important breeding result of the 1940
season was that our pair of Blue-fronted Amazons again reared
a brood--four this time instead of the five they produced last
year. This season's brood was, if anything, even finer than last
year's as they were less cramped in the nest. We retain four (two
true pairs) of last season's young ones and have sold all but one
of this year's brood. Young Amazons are quite fairly easy to sex,
as the cocks, besides having more yellow and less blue on the head,
start displaying, if you stand near their aviary, at quite an early
age, spreading their tails fan-wise, running rapidly along the
perch " blazing " their eyes and erecting their head feathers.
The hens by comparison are very quiet and undemonstrative
and have much larger blue areas on the head, but are, at any
rate in the writer's opinion, quite as handsome as their husbands.
African Grey Parrots are difficult to breed, the chief reason being
that they are so hard to sex. Very often two hens or two cocks
seem perfectly happy together in an aviary, so much so that one
might imagine one had a true pair. The proved cock, however,
which actually got so far as producing a young one when in the
present Duke of Bedford's collection, and when mated to a very
aged hen who elected to breed so late in the year that their offspring

died--occupied an aviary with another African Grey of whom
he did not at all approve. When one of our customers asked us
to keep a Grey of hers we placed this bird with him and both
were overjoyed with each other and we had high hopes of their
breeding, because, eagerly abetted by the cock, she spent days
and weeks and even months in the nest, but never an egg appeared !
They were, however, very entertaining with the hen kicking up
a tremendous dust in the nest, causing her to do a great deal of
most human coughing, while the cock periodically poked his head
gingerly into the entrance hole of the nest-box saying : " Gome
on, Polly ! 55 --a rather futile exhortation which produced further
spasms of coughing from the depths.
Cockatoos
Just before war broke out we had started to erect a large range
of Cockatoo aviaries, but since then, some of the 2 in. by 2 in.
wooden poles have had to be taken out of the ground and used
to make sleeping bunks in an air raid shelter.
One pair of Roseates, however, which breed every year, reared
a fine brood again this season.
A pair of Leadbeater's produced no young ones because, though
the hen is a fine bird, the cock is a " tame talking 55 specimen
who chats to me with a broad Australian accent, simply loathes
his wife, and is quite useless for breeding purposes.
A large number of Budgerigars and some Gockatiels were bred,
in addition to numerous Lovebirds of various kinds including
several Blue Masked. A pair of African Red-faced Lovebirds
were busy burrowing out their nesting hole when a bomb exploded
about 20 yards from their aviary--shattering the shelter windows
and hurling their nesting arrangements to the ground. They them-
selves, however, were unscathed !
The only finches we possess are White, Silver, and ordinary
Zebra Finches and Red-headed Parrot Finches, all of which
successfully reared young.
Grass-Parrakeets
A pair of Blue-wings bred and a large number of Elegants and
Bourke's were reared. Twelve of that loveliest of all Grass-Parrakeets
--the Splendid--were reared, one pair doing most of the work,
although the average over our three pairs worked out at four each.

E. BOOSEY-WAR-TIME BREEDING RESULTS AT KESTON 303
Incidentally to anyone contemplating keeping Grass-Parrakeets
I would say that Bourke's are in my experience the best breeders
of all, then Elegants, then Splendids. Blue-wings I have never
found at all prolific, and Turquoisines, though they have several
times bred with us, never live very long at Keston, though one or
two people have found them quite easy subjects both to keep and
breed.
Rock Grass-Parrakeets, although we have possessed several
pairs at different times, never seem to me really worth bothering
about as they always get so over-fat, even in a large aviary, and
are, in addition, quite the least attractive of the whole family,
being chiefly a sort of dark muddy olive green. Orange-bellies
I have never kept though I have seen a stuffed specimen, and
Alan Lendon, over here with the Australian Forces, and who we
were very glad to welcome on a visit to our farm, tells me they
are attractive in life.
A very young hen Manycolour mated to a cock Hooded did
not breed. I have always felt that this cross would be almost
indistinguishable from a Paradise Parrakeet. A fair number of
ordinary Redrumps were reared and one pair was given six Many
colours' eggs--the odd thing being not so much that the Redrumps
successfully reared five fine young Manycolours, as that the
Manycolours which were given the Redrump's eggs and had
invariably failed to rear their own broods, were most successful
with their foster-children, rearing four young Redrumps from four
eggs ! One hen Yellow Redrump mated to a Yellow-bred green
cock was most successful, producing two broods almost all of
them yellow including three Yellow cocks. These, in a delicate
way, are very lovely, the brilliant red of the rumps being strikingly
contrasted with their otherwise generally pale yet vivid colouring.
The best idea of a Yellow Redrump can be gained by saying that
in appearance they bear much the same relationship to common
Redrumps as " silver " Zebra Finches do to the normal variety.
The chief difficulty in breeding up a stock of them has been
that being sex linked--and the unique and only original matriarch
being a Yellow hen--many more hens than cocks have been
produced, and the former are for some reason very much hardier
than the latter.

but hatched only one--a fine Lutino which they unaccountably
allowed to die when almost fledged. A second pair, however,
were more successful, rearing three green young ones and one
lovely Lutino. Rock Peplars reared their own young ones and
their first clutch of eggs which were taken from them were
successfully reared by a cock Barraband mated to a hen Rock
Peplar. Incidentally these two reared a rather handsome and
shapely hybrid in 1939, in addition to three Princess of Wales'
in the same nest. Perhaps three of the finest Princess of Wales'
ever bred at Keston were reared last year by a pair of Redrumps !
Numerous Common and Golden-mantled Rosellas were bred as
well as some nice young Mealies. Stanley's, as usual, were extremely
prolific, the largest single brood being seven, by the same pair
that last season produced nine in one brood. Some excellent young
Crimson-wings were reared by their own parents, but their first
clutch of eggs which were removed and placed, as an experiment,
under Rosellas were successfully hatched, but allowed to die when
about a week old. King Parrakeets and Princess of Wales' did not
breed. Finally mention must be made of two veterans--a rufous-
bellied Niltava and a cock Manycolour. The former, usually, I
believe, a short-lived species, has been in my possession for about
six years and spent last winter roosting in the bushes in the
open run of a large planted aviary. He never so much as turned
a hair even in the bitterest periods of an abnormally severe winter
and was always a picture of health and sprightliness, whereas
I had several times had trouble with him when wintered in a
flight cage in a heated room ! White-capped Redstarts also
flourished exceedingly in the same aviary, but these are, I believe,
frequently met with among the snows of the Himalayas, so their
hardiness is not really surprising.
A pair of Rose-breasted Grosbeaks had several nests and
reared at least three young ones almost to complete maturity.
These, however, were in a very thickly planted aviary and must
have perished in the undergrowth as no trace of them was ever
found. I should perhaps explain that these young Grosbeaks
have the odd habit of leaving the nest when very young and only
sparsely clad in nestling down so that their career from then until
they reach the stage at which most youngsters leave the nest is
extremely precarious and fraught with many perils. Another time

E. BOOSEY-WAR-TIME BREEDING RESULTS AT KESTON 305
I should try them in a smaller unplanted aviary where I could
keep an eye on the young ones. A young hen, however, was
successfully reared last year, in spite of the fact that it too left
the nest at so tender an age that I thought it must have fallen
out of it. Rose-breasted Grosbeaks have a really lovely song
and the hen is brown with thrush-like markings, while the cock
is very handsome, possessing much the same colour scheme as a
Red Admiral butterfly. He goes out of colour and somewhat
resembles his mate during the winter.
The second veteran, the cock Manycoloured Parrakeet, is,
I think, a bird of very great interest. Manycolours are subject
to septicaemia and by no means easy, particularly in some
unfavourable localities, and this particular specimen was several
times seriously ill--curiously enough in his younger days, though
not since. He was in the present Duke of Bedford's possession for
I believe five years before he very kindly presented him to me,
and before that had been in Madame Lecallier's aviaries for a
similar period. As Lord Tavistock--as he then was--gave him to
me quite fifteen years ago, just before the Keston Foreign Bird
Farm came into existence, he has by now lived in aviaries for
quite twenty-five years or even more, and assuming he was a few
years old when wild-caught in Australia he may by now be as
much as thirty years old ! He has been an old age pensioner for
some years and latterly has become a very old gentleman indeed,
but in his prime with us he was a marvellous breeder and must--
or should--have numerous descendants. This year just to please
and perhaps rejuvenate him in his declining years, I mated him
to a young Redrump wife to whom I gave a fertile Redrump's
egg thinking that more than one youngster would be too much
of a strain on him. I am glad to say the egg hatched and he and
his wife successfully reared it, and terribly proud he was--as well
he might be at his great age--of his single foster-child. I doubt
if he will survive the coming winter, but if he dies, though I shall
greatly miss an old friend, I shall at least have the satisfaction
of knowing that he has always been well cared for and well housed,
with plenty of flying space, and " the good earth " under his feet,
and young green grass to nibble in the spring.

We have now had our pair of Australian Leadbeater's for
three years, and each season they have bred and been successful
in rearing their young ones.
This year three eggs were laid by 22nd April. A peculiarity
of these birds is their strange nesting habit. Instead of taking it in
turn to incubate the eggs, the Leadbeater's arrange to share their
responsibility in another way. All through the day the cock bird
sits on the nest, but when night conies his place is taken by the
hen bird who incubates until the next morning. This year two of
the three eggs were hatched by 19 th May, and the remaining
one was infertile.
The babies remained in their nest until 14th July and during
this time they were fed on soaked bread, sweet biscuits, apple,
lettuce, and canary-mixture. In addition to these foods, adult
Leadbeater's feed on hempseed and sunflower, but they are
especially fond of apples and sweet biscuits and will always jump
along the floor of the aviary to the gate whenever they see anybody
with their favourite food.
The young Cockatoos left their nest after nearly two months,
but they are always very slow in learning to fly. These two took
almost a month, and during these weeks they crawled about on
the floor of their aviary.
The parents are very spiteful during the breeding season but
can usually be pacified with a biscuit. The cock bird, though
extremely spiteful with his male young (last year one of them was
bitten right through the beak) treats his female young with gentle
respect and never ventures to attack one of his daughters !
Whenever we go to see them, our Leadbeater's are always
perched in the same position, touching one another with their
heads, and so still that one could almost take them for stuffed birds.
But the moment they see a stranger approaching they at once
lift their sleek white-plumed heads and begin to display their lovely
coral and lemon coloured crests. When on the wing, one is able
to see that the colour of the underpart is also of a deep coral, like

This beautiful Lory inhabits Mysore Island, off the Bay of
Geelvink, north coast of Papua. It is one of the most lovely of
the Trichoglossi.
There are only two specimens of this bird in the Bird Room
of the Natural History Museum. Mr. Frost brought the first living
example home in 1910--since then only a very few have been
imported, and according to Dr. Hopkinson's Records none have
been bred in England.
I have lately acquired a cock bird, which when in Mr. Partridge's
possession he mated with a hen Swainson Lorikeet, but unfor-
tunately she was a bad sitter and the eggs did not hatch out. My
bird is very gentle and seldom noisy. He does very well on a
bread-and-milk diet with a little honey and some broken-up
banana. He likes bathing and keeps his plumage in good condition.
The British Museum Catalogue of Birds , volume xx, gives this
description of the Rosenberg Lory.
Adult. --Back, wings, and tail green, towards the occiput purple ;
a narrow red band on the occiput ; another yellowish-green band
sometimes mingled with red on the nape ; interscapular feathers
with concealed red bands ; breast and lower abdomen red with
dark blue bands on the edge of the feathers ; middle of the abdomen
dark blue, flanks yellowish-green, with dark green bands ; under
tail coverts yellowish-green, with green spots at the tip ; under
wing-coverts and quills at the base of the inner web, red ; inner
web and lateral tail-feathers yellowish-green ; bill orange-red ;
feet dark. Total length, 11 inches ; wing, 4*80 ; tail 4*12 ; bill,
0-85 ; tarsus, 0-65.
Through the kindness of Mr. Whitley this bird is now on view
in an aviary of the Tropical House at Primley Zoo.

J. YE ALL AND-THE BLUE LORIES
THE BLUE LORIES
By John Yealland

<bodyText confidence="0.995740628571429" page_id="56314628"  page_num="308" year="" vol="">
In the new edition of his work Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux
(printed in 1798), M. le Comte de Buffon describes a bird which
is called " l'Arimanon " (vol. vi, p. 96).
The bird is Coriphilus peruvianus --the Tahiti Blue Lory, the
White-throated Lory, or the Indigo Lory as it is variously called.
This bird, says Buffon, is found on the island of Tahiti and its
name "l'Arimanon " signifies in the language of the country
" Coconut-bird 55 because it lives on the coconut palms.
It is quite curious that although Buffon observes that the tip
of the tongue is filamentous, he has placed the bird, not among
the Lories, nor even among the " loris perruches ", but in company
with some Hanging Parrots and at least one Lovebird, among
the Parrakeets as a " perruche a queue courte " ! Quoting a
description by M. Commerson, he continues : " The plumage
of this bird is entirely of a beautiful blue with the exception of
the throat and the part below the neck which are white ; the
beak and feet are red.
"Is is very common on the island of Tahiti where one sees
it flying about everywhere and one hears without cessation its
twittering.
" It flies in flocks, feeds on bananas, but is very difficult indeed
to keep in domesticity and when alone in a cage it will die of
boredom.
" One is unable to make it take foods other than the juice
of fruits : it consistently refuses all the more solid foods."
This account makes very strange reading at the present time,
for this Lory has long been extinct on Tahiti, surviving only in
small numbers on the other Society Islands, also the Marquesas
and Paumotu, though it is thought to live on the coral islets rather
than on the larger islands.
The bird has, however, recently been reintroduced to Tahiti
by Mr. Eastham Guild : the experiment will be watched with
the greatest interest, and there is no need to say how it is hoped
that it will be successful. C. peruvianus has already been described
in the Avicultural Magazine ( antea , 1936, p. 65) and this

description is accompanied by a coloured plate which portrays
the bird to perfection.
The other species of the genus, the rarer Goupil's or Ultramarine
Lory (C. ultramarinus ) is figured in Mivart's Loriida , but, if I
remember rightly, the plate is of a young bird, having the beak
and feet of a dark horn colour, whereas in the adults (whose
plumage is similar though rather brighter in colour) the upper
mandible and the feet are of a yellowish orange, giving the bird
a very different appearance. In character the two species are
quite unlike : the Tahiti Blue Lory is by nature rather disposed
to be tame, when young is extremely playful, and when adult
the cocks are given to fighting and are very uncertain of temper.
In captivity, at least, it goes often to the ground, while the
Goupil's seems much more arboreal in habit, is quite nervous
and shy and I cannot recall ever seeing them play or fight. It was
at one time generally thought that these beautiful Lories were
extinct, but it will be remembered that a pair of C. peruvianus
arrived at the London Zoo five or six years ago.
Dr. Derscheid received several in early 1936 and at the same
time the Duke of Bedford (then Lord Tavistock) received some
of both species from Mr. Eastham Guild and brought over by
him.
The birds had travelled well and were in excellent health :
I believe only one was lost on the voyage.
They had been fed on a condensed milk diluted with water
and sweetened with moist sugar and on whatever fruit had been
obtainable on the voyage.
Naturally we continued with the same food for a week or two
before gradually changing to the Dr. Allinson's food (prepared
as for infants, sweetened with demerara sugar and given fresh
twice daily) which Lord Tavistock had already used with
considerable success for larger Lories, Lorikeets and Hanging
Parrots.
I well remember Mr. Guild's directions that the Lories should
be given only thin and easily digested food and it was on this
account that we gave the food of a consistency very much thinner
than we had hitherto given even to Hanging Parrots.
The birds did well in large cages in a well-heated room :
we gave them roosting boxes and nearly all used them, especially

the nervous Goupil's, but this was also rather a nuisance, for the
shyest of the birds would bundle into the boxes when they heard
anyone approach, so that, in order to see that all was well with
them, we were obliged to make a small observation hole in the
door of the room and in this way we saw without being seen.
In addition to the milk food, we gave apple, pear, grapes and
occasionally tomato : the birds ate of the fruit rather after the
manner of wasps, hollowing out the inside and leaving the skin,
as if their delicate beaks were not strong enough to break it.
They drank a little of the tomato juice and I have seen them
take pollen from the flowers of groundsel with their brush tongues,
but it seemed that they were not fond of green-food.
In the spring all those Lories well able to fly were moved to
some heated aviaries which had large and well-lighted shelters
and all went well with them until about the middle of June when,
one by one they became ill and died, as if some infectious disease
had broken out among them.
In each case the post-mortem examination failed to reveal any
trace of disease and even an analysis of the organs of one proved
negative, but in one or two there was evidence of anaemia. Essence
of beef in small quantities was then added to the food but it made
no improvement and it was only when further post-mortem
examinations revealed signs of dyspepsia that it became clear that
the food was wrong.
Making the food with skimmed milk did not have any beneficial
effect, and it was only when it was made as before and diluted
with its own volume of water that the trouble ended.
We had been deceived by the fact that even the smallest of
the Hanging Parrots such as the Blue-crowned, Sclater's and the
Halmahera had thrived (and the two latter species had even
nested) on the same food made of a decidedly thicker consistency
than we had ever made it for the Blue Lories and also that it
had taken six months for the dyspepsia to take any noticeable
effect, for in that time we had lost but one Lory, and that soon
after arrival, probably having taken chill on the journey from
London. I really think that it was the milk itself that was too
indigestible (and, of course, milk in May and June is apt to be
richer than at any other time of the year) and that, within reason,
the consistency of the food may not have made so much difference,

being governed by the amount of the easily digested powder food
mixed in.
However it may be, it was very regrettable that the cause
of the deaths was not discovered sooner.
As has been recorded in the Magazine, both species of Coriphilus
have since been bred at Hayward's Heath and I believe that
three young of C. peruvianus and the parents and one young
one of C. ultramarinus are still alive in the Duke of Bedford's
collection.
In Dr. Derscheid's collection the Tahiti Blue Lories did well,
were always very active and in perfect plumage.
They were fed on a proprietary condensed milk mixed with
some infants' food and sweetened with sugar known as " cassonade "
which seemed to be the same as demerara sugar.
In addition they received apple, grapes, and pear and also
chickweed of which they were very fond, eating the tenderest
leaves, the buds and flowers and even the white unripened seeds.
In the evening the food was replaced by a dish of warm water
sweetened with the cassonade sugar.
This was, I am sure, an excellent plan, and perhaps an improve-
ment on the giving of two lots of the same food per day. The
larger Lories and Lorikeets in the collection were rationed with
the liquid food, all this being taken away at about 5.0 p.m. until
the next meal early the following morning. This arrangement
worked very well with the larger birds, and may have done so
with the Blue Lories, but one does not like to make so bold an
experiment with such delicate birds. The food was very thin,
and, I at first thought, not perhaps very sustaining, for the birds
seemed to feed very often. The trouble here was that the Lories
became too fat, although they were always very active and were
kept in large indoor flights for most of the year and in outdoor
aviaries during the best of the summer.
We tried making the food less appetizing by putting less sugar
in it, but it did not make any difference, for they seemed to like
it just as well and remained just as fat.
One egg was known to have been laid there before 1937, and
in the early winter of that year we gave each of two pairs a tall
hollow log having the hollow part some four inches in diameter.
They were pleased with the nests and as an additional encourage-

ment we gave them one mealworm each per day and occasionally
a little coconut milk.
It is curious that the Tahiti Blue Lories have a liking for
mealworms as if, in nature, some sort of live food is part of the
diet, however unlikely that would seem to be.
I have not known the Goupil's to eat mealworms, but I once
saw one eat a Crane fly.
The Tahiti Blue Lories at Sterrebeek ate their ration of one
per day with the greatest relish, leaving only fragments of the
skin : they were always looking for more and peering into their
dish to see if any more were forthcoming.
They soon went to nest in the logs, but after a few weeks we
found only small fragments of egg-shell in the nests and evidently
the eggs had been broken by the birds while fighting or some-
thing of the kind, for they were often together in the nest
especially at night.
Since then quite a dozen eggs were laid by one or the other
of the hens, but in each case the eggs were soft-shelled, causing
egg-binding which in turn caused such distress to these fat birds
that we were obliged to remove the egg for fear that the hen would
die of heart failure.
We tried various things such as lime-water and finely ground
cuttlefish bone sprinkled over the food, but all to no good effect
and it was evident that the indoor life was the cause of this trouble.
Later a heating plant was installed in a range of small but
excellent outdoor aviaries which had large and well-lighted shelters
of brick, but in the meantime one hen had died in a kind of seizure
during egg-binding and a few months later, before the outdoor
aviary treatment had had time to take effect, the last hen was
found dead in the nest from egg-binding.
Always before she had, as is usual with egg-bound hens, come
out from the nest and sat outside looking miserable, so had been
easy to observe, but when she stayed in the nest we thought that
all was well.
Like the others, she was very fat and with her death went
our last hope of breeding these Lories.
When treated correctly I do not think these two Lories are
difficult to keep--certainly not so difficult as some of the smallest
Lorikeets--nor more trouble than any other delicate bird.

E. HOPKINSON-THE WHITLEY COLLECTION OF PARROTS 3 1 3
One rather serious trouble with C. peruvianus is that some cocks
are at times very pugnacious even towards their own hens and
although their small beaks are incapable of making more than
small scratches generally on the nostrils and feet of the victims,
these very quickly become distressed and would, I expect, soon die.
At Sterrebeek we found that clipping one wing of one of these
bullies worked very well, making him slower in flight, while he
could quite easily climb to the food dishes.
Perhaps putting some cover as for Pheasants, though, of course,
high up, would be a good way of protecting the hens.
I believe that an outdoor aviary having a large well-lighted
shelter which can be heated is the only place in which to breed
them : a large aviary is not necessary, for in a confined space
the birds' flight is weak and ill-controlled, but they take a lot of
exercise by climbing about and making short flights.
If the food is not made too appetizing (i.e. too sweet) I think
that these Lories would not become fat and would live a long
time ; even more important is it to provide a liquid food that is
easily digested and to beware of cc tons les alimens plus solides ! "

A PARROT number of the Magazine would not be complete
without a mention of Mr. Whitley's collection at Paignton, now

tained (and I hope still contains or will contain again) is astonishing.
Here is an attempt to catalogue what I remember of the rarest
of the many rarities. The dates are approximate, being from
memory mostly.
LORIES. Duyvenbodes (1931), Blue-cheeked (1928), Blue-
streaked (1931), Red Lory (1939) ; the species bred there at least
twice. White-rumped Lory ( fuscata ) also bred. Louisiade Lory
(hypoinochrous ), pair, 1933, Perfect Lorikeet ( euteles ) 1, Varied
Lorikeet, about 6 in 1928, Porphyry-crowned, G. porphyrocephala ,

Courtship and Display among Birds. By C. R. Stonor. Price
ffi. bd. Published by Country Life , 2-10 Tavistock Street,
London, W.C. 2.
As Mr. Percy Lowe says in his foreword to Courtship and Display
of Birds , this book c&amp;lt; deals with a side of ornithological science
which may be said to be still in its infancy and it may well prepare
the mind of the non-specialist to further and original progress in
this direction ". There is no doubt that Mr. Stonor, by his careful
accumulation of observations and propounding of theories on, as
he himself emphasizes, " one of the most difficult aspects of natural
history," the study of animal behaviour, does much to this end.
Aviculturists have contributed greatly to this branch of ornithology,
as it is to them that many descriptions of display and courtship of
birds are due ; for birds kept in suitable captivity will go through
their various rituals as faithfully and in the same detail as in the
wild state. Mr. Stonor deals with the various adornments and
other methods used in display, reasons for display, and individual
and communal displays. The wonderful ceremonies of the Paradise
Birds, the Pheasants, and Game birds, the Lyre Bird and the
Manakins are but a few of those described in this absorbing book.
Mr. Stonor's general conclusions, particularly the main points of
importance in different types of courtship, effect of environment,
and technique in display, give much food for thought. Finally,
the book is profusely illustrated with no less than fifty-seven excellent
photographs procured from all over the world, and Mr. Stonor is
to be congratulated on the care and trouble he has taken to secure
this first-rate selection. The photographs include a number from
the New York Zoological Society and also from such well known
aviculturists as D. Seth-Smith, A. H. Chisholm, and Professor
Allen. The book can best be summed up by reverting to the con-
clusion of the foreword, &amp;lt;c a most stimulating and useful book."
It is certainly a book which should be possessed by all serious
aviculturists, and there is no doubt that it will do much to stimulate
interest on this most important side of bird life.

What is the Longest-lived Parrot on Record
What is the longest-lived Parrot on record ? Cayley in his Australian Parrots,
p. 94, mentions " Cocky Bennett ", a white Cockatoo which when it died at
Sydney a few years before the publication of the book was said to have been
well over a hundred years old. I have an idea that I have seen a similar record
about a Parrot in England ; can someone produce the reference and oblige.

Stock Dove Hybrids
Darwin, in his voluminous chapter on Domestic Pigeons in the work Variation
of Animals and Plants , in dealing with the Stock Dove, states " but though it crosses
readily with the true Rock Pigeon (C. livid) the offspring as we shall presently
see are sterile hybrids."
For some years I have regularly produced from an old male Stock Dove and
the same domestic Pigeon a number of these hybrids both male and female.
Every F. i male I have paired with domestic Pigeon has proved fertile sometimes
affecting one egg, rarely both. So far the F. i female hybrids have not been
fertilized by suitable small domestic Pigeons, although they sit and relieve during
incubation normally.
Previously I lost my F. 2 hybrids in vigorous condition when they commenced
to peck. This year I secured a hardier race of domestic Pigeon for pairing to an
F. 1 hybrid male and now have in adult plumage two F. 2 hybrids from F. 1
male Stock Dove X domestic Pigeon hybrid and hen domestic Pigeon. These
are apparently males which if time and food allows I hope next season to test for
fertility. F. 1 hybrids may be " blue ", i.e. exactly the sort of thing one would
expect from wild parent species or may inherit colour characters of the domestic
Pigeon used. Although my F. 2 hybrids have largely inherited the colour
characters of their female grandparent the contour of head and neck favours pure
Stock Dove and the green iridescence noticeable in this species is prominent.

This year a hybrid bird was reared here from a male Poliospiza gularis and
female Chloris chloris.
The nestling dress was a combination of the juvenile dress of both species.
The first adult dress and form of bill particularly favoured the male parent
excepting that the edges of the flight and tail feathers were of greenish yellow and
about as well developed as those of a young hen Greenfinch. This was the first
trial I had made of this mating after two years 5 unsuccessful attempts at mating
the same male parent with Serins (suitable hen Canaries).

Hybrid Serinus flaviventris
This year a male and female hybrid has been produced here from the mating
of this East African Serin and hen Canary. The hybrids in adult dress are nearly
as large as the male parent and just as dangerous to their kin. Their appearance
is almost identical with the pure species although a heavily streaked green common

Canary was employed. Having produced a number of hybrids between African
Serins and Canaries this dominance of wild Serin appearance has been a marked
feature more so than in the case of some other slightly related hybrid birds.

SHORTAGE OF FEEDING STUFFS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997762434782609" page_id="56314395"  page_num="317" year="" vol="">
There seems to be a conspiracy of silence, at least in print, regarding the
general shortage of feeding stuffs for birds. Surely it is much better to admit
the shortage and discuss the matter of substitutes, for every one must, in some
way or another, know of a small economy which can be effected.
Most of the ingredients for " Soft-food " are now either unobtainable or very
scarce, neither is there any likelihood of any being imported, for such things
as " ant-eggs ", dried flies, and ground silkworm pupae come from enemy or
enemy-occupied countries. Therefore it behoves us to make our available
stocks eke out as long as possible or to find substitutes.
I find that boiled mashed potatoes greatly increase the bulk of " soft-food "
and are readily eaten by most birds. The potatoes are boiled in their skins,
then held on a fork and the thin skin peeled off by one's finger-nails. In this
way the potato is kept dry, it is then passed through a " masher " and mixed
with the food. Stale Madeira cake crumbled and mixed with the food is also
relished.
I would suggest in the case of the " soft-food " giving out altogether that
one might substitute a mixture of mashed potatoes, crumbled stale sponge-cake
and finely chopped hard-boiled egg.
Berries, especially hawthorn and elder, are good substitutes for fruit.
I wonder if any one has tried the use of dried Daphnia in with the " soft-
food " ? There seems to be a large quantity on market at the present time.
One would be glad of any further suggestions, and would particularly welcome
any suggestion of a substitute for pheasant corn !

BREEDING AND REARING THE AUSTRALIAN BANDED PLOVER
I was very interested in reading in the October number of the Avicultural
Magazine Herr Neunzig's account of the breeding of the Australian Banded
Plover (gonifer tricolor ). I can endorse his statement that they are charming and

<bodyText confidence="0.9984555" page_id="56314395"  page_num="317" year="" vol="">
satisfactory aviary birds. We have two breeding pairs at Lilford, both of which
reared broods last season and this.
The young rear quite easily when fed upon scalded biscuit meal, etc.,
supplemented if convenient by a few mealworms, earthworms, or fragments
of shredded lean meat. Great trouble was taken in the case of the earlier broods
to supply ants' eggs, etc. Later we found the young rear just as satisfactorily

when fed upon a more farinaceous diet. The food was placed in a shallow pan.
They also partook of coarse oatmeal (Pin head), and Indian brown millet seed.
I have seen batches of adult birds of this species thrive for lengthy periods when
fed entirely upon this seed.
Our birds also eat wheat and give one the impression of being much less
insectivorous than the majority of Plover.
Should any one care to try this easily kept species I may state that they are
hardy enough to winter satisfactorily in this country when given the protection
of an unheated shed. Also that the young rear best when left undisturbed.

BREEDING OF THE OCELLATED TURKEY

<bodyText confidence="0.849091416666667" page_id="56314396"  page_num="318" year="" vol="">
Miss Chawner's inquiry about the breeding of the Ocellated Turkey in the
Pheasant Number (p. 218).
This I am afraid I have only just noticed. I have no record of the breeding
of this bird in England, but have an idea it has been bred in America ; an idea
only. I should be glad of definite information.
As regards hybrids, however, there are two records, one in England. Bartlett
in his Wild Animals in Captivity (1898) says that this cross (Ocellated male with
the hen Common Turkey, apparently meant) is fertile, and Professor Ghigi
in Italy paired a hen Ocellated with a Wild Turkey Cock and reared many
young hybrids in 1934. See his account in UOiseau , 1934, 542.

<bodyText confidence="0.997031222222222" page_id="56314396"  page_num="318" year="" vol="">
During 1940, despite great difficulties, the Magazine has been maintained
at its pre-war standard, and it is our aim that this standard should not be lowered.
With the fall in income and rise in cost of production, however, it is essential that
economy should be made. It is therefore proposed to publish the Magazine
every second month, compressing two months into one issue. The January-
February number will be published on 1st February and so on. The Editor will
be glad to have the views of members on this suggestion.
Under the present exceptional conditions it is proposed that the Council and
Officers should remain unchanged for the coming year.
