FIRST BREEDING IN EUROPE OF THE MAURITIUS
KESTREL AT JERSEY WILDLIFE PRESERVATION
TRUST

Situated in the Indian Ocean, the island of Mauritius is home to
a small falcon, the Mauritius Kestrel, Falco punctatus, listed as
endangered in the Red Data Book (Collar and Andrew, 1985).
Endemic to this Mascarene island, its body weights range from 123
- 142 g in the wild and 127 - 146 g in captivity for males, and for
females from 170 - 204 g in the wild, and 152 - 154 g in captivity
(Cheke and Jones, 1987). The plumage of male, female and
juvenile is alike, with reversed sexual size dimorphism the only
readily distinguishable feature between the sexes (Jones, 1987).
Morphologically adapted to living in forest, the kestrel popula-
tion previously well distributed throughout the island declined with
pesticide contamination being a major element in the demise of the
species. Loss of suitable habitat, and consequent decline in prey
availability e.g. day geckos Phelsuma spp., were also contributory
factors (Jones and Owadally, 1985).By 1974 only four birds were
known to exist in the wild (Temple, 1977). Because of this
downward trend in numbers a pair was removed from the wild in
1973 to form the nucleus of a captive breeding programme. Since
then successful breeding has enabled the release of kestrels back
into the wild and to date 241 Mauritius Kestrels have been released
(Jones, pers. comm.).
As an extension to this programme, in 1986, three pairs of
kestrels were sent to the World Centre for Birds of Prey, Boise,
USA (Jones et al, 1991), and on 18th June 1990, Jersey Wildlife
Preservation Trust received two pairs. The first was an established
pair with both male and female hatched on Mauritius in 1983 and
1984 respectively. A younger pair was to be formed with a male
hatched on Mauritius in December 1987, and a female hatched in
Boise, USA in July 1989. It was from this latter pair that two chicks
were hatched in 1991, the first in Europe. On arrival at the Trust,

both pairs of kestrels underwent a six week quarantine period, after
which they were moved to similar adjoining aviaries of which the
design allowed only minimal visual contact. The outside flights
measured 6.40 x 4.3 m with a height varying between 3.2 and 3.7
m for one, and 3.7 and 4.6 m for the other. Perching was provided
with branches of various dimensions and upright tree trunks. Some
large boulders were also placed in each aviary. The ground was
covered with a substrate of sand and grass and a variety of plants
were provided, e.g. honeysuckle, Lonicera japonica, Russian vine,
Polygonum baldschuanicum and Cordyline australis . Access to an
indoor heated area measuring 1.8 x 3.7 m is via two popholes 173
cm above ground level. Once indoors, this area can be divided into
two sections should the need arise (e.g. temporary separation of the
younger pair of kestrels). Heating is provided all year round by a
covered bar wall heater, and a 100 W Salamander infra red spotlight
(under which the birds can perch) which gives a constant minimum
temperature indoors of 65 *F /18.3 *C. A nestbox provided for the
breeding season is used throughout the year as a resting place. A
thin layer of sand covers the floor.
Both pairs of kestrels were kept together throughout the year,
although initially there were some management problems with the
younger pair. The female assumed a very aggressive dominant
role, chasing the male relentlessly, so that temporary separation
was necessary. Five primaries trimmed on the female&apos;s left wing
rectified the problem. At the onset of the breeding season and until
early winter the kestrels have permanent outside access. However,
during the winter months (November - March) all the birds are shut
inside at 1500 hours when they are fed. This still allows sufficient
daylight hours for feeding. Temporary adjustment of this routine
was necessary once the two young kestrels had fledged. To avoid
any potentially harmful harassment from the adult birds constant
outside access was given.
The kestrels are fed on three small dead white mice Mus
musculus (or occasionally small weaner rats Rattus norvegicus)
once daily. Additional food is available during the breeding season
and during exceptionally cold spells of weather. A pinch of vionate
powder, a multi-vitamin supplement, is used once weekly. Any
mice surplus to requirement are cached and, when located, these are
removed to prevent possibly long periods of storage and subsequent
retrieval by the kestrels to consume.
Whenever management of the birds requires capture, a routine
medical examination is carried out. Assessment of body condition,
and examination of the feet are made and status of bumblefoot, if
appropriate, can be gauged. Both older kestrels arrived at the Trust

with Type 1 bumblefoot (condition given three categories by J.
Cooper where Type 1 is mild and Type 3 is chronic, Cooper, 1978).
Type 1 can be described as a &amp;quot; mild localised lesion&amp;quot; on a the plantar
surface of the foot which can be &amp;quot;proliferative (a raised &amp;quot;corn&amp;quot;) or
degenerative with a flattening and thinning of the epithelium or, in
some cases, ulceration&amp;quot; (Cooper, 1978). In both birds this condi-
tion has remained stable.
In Jersey, the breeding season for the kestrels appears to start in
March, with the first aerial displays witnessed in this month. (In
Mauritius the breeding season extends from September - March,
Jones et al, 1991). The kestrels were provided with nestboxes well
in advance of the breeding season. Each pair had one box (placed
indoors) measuring 61 x 25 x 25.5 cm and was positioned in a corner
250 cm above floor level, with the entrance facing towards a
pophole providing outside access. The nestbox was divided into
two sections by a shallow 5 cm sill. The rear half contained an
inspection door and was intended as the nesting area. A substrate
of small disinfected gravel was used throughout.
Prior to egg laying, and throughout this period, both female
kestrels needed to reach and maintain peak body condition. Court-
ship feeding by the male was vital to ensure this. In the older pair
of kestrels this role was already well established with regular
feeding of the female by the male. With the younger pair in their
first season, initially the female snatched food from her mate who
was reluctant to surrender his prey. However, as time progressed,
very gentle beak to beak food passing from male to female oc-
curred, both whilst the female was laying and then incubating, and
during the early stages of chick rearing. &amp;quot;Egg lethargy&amp;quot;, a condi-
tion seen in some female falcons (Weaver and Cade, 1985) prior to
and during egg laying was observed in the young female kestrel.
Symptomised by lethargic behaviour, and a generally sick appear-
ance, this corresponded only with her egg-laying period, after
which normal behaviour resumed.
Mauritius Kestrels normally lay a clutch of three or four eggs
(Jones et al, 1991). However, the young female laid a clutch of five
eggs which is unusual. Of these, three were fertile (one of which
subsequently died as a mid period embryo), and two were badly
cracked and dented. The older female laid two clutches, the first
consisting of two eggs and the second of three eggs. Both clutches
were infertile. Because of some problems suspected with poor
eggshell quality and thickness (in both pairs of kestrels) calcium
lactate was used as a supplement once weekly during the egg laying
period. Egg coloration in the clutches laid by both females varied

from almost exclusively off-white, with a little rust coloured
speckling at the blunt end, to eggs with an off-white ground and
large areas of speckling. It was intended that clutches of eggs laid
by either pair of kestrels would remain with the female for approxi-
mately ten days natural incubation. It has been proven in falcon
species that this greatly improves hatchability (Burnham, 1983).
After this clutches would be removed to complete incubation
artificially, and after hatching an initial period of hand rearing,
chicks would be returned to the kestrels to fledge. Consequently
from late April, with the first copulations observed, the nestboxes
of both pairs were checked daily. Initially this was for signs of a
&amp;quot;scrape&amp;quot; or depression in the gravel, upon which eggs would be
laid. As egg laying commenced each was marked and weighed
using a Pesola spring balance to obtain a fresh egg weight. Ranges
between 13.5 g and 17.8 g were recorded. The egg laying interval
for captive birds is recorded as every other day (Jones, 1987) and
Temple (1978) recorded an interval of 2 - 4 days. Egg laying
intervals for the two females at the Trust varied from 3 - 5 days. At
no point did management of the kestrels in this way cause unnec-
essary disturbance. When a clutch was completed the female was
left to incubate.
With each egg that is laid the female gradually spends more time
at the nest, with the result that hatching is asynchronous (Jones,
1987). The incubation period ranges from 28-35 days (Jones, 1987)
and from observations of both pairs of kestrels at the Trust, the
females assumed the major role in incubation duties. Wooden eggs
were used as a substitute to replace clutches removed for artificial
incubation, in order to keep the females&apos; sitting for the possible
return of chicks. Because of their extreme fagility, all the eggs
which were removed were weighed on Ohaus, Port-O-Gram scales,
marked for identification and candled, but not measured or cleaned,
in order to keep handling to a minimum. (None of the eggs had
stained or dirty shells). Two eggs with hairline cracks were re-
paired with clear nail varnish. A forced air Vomo 1 Schumacher,
W. Ing incubator set at 37.5 *C was used exclusively for artificial
incubation of the kestrel eggs. Humidity was provided by a single
water tray with an area of 163.5 cm which was replenished twice
daily with cooled boiled water. The eggs were turned by hand seven
times daily, beginning at 0800 hrs. and continuing at 1030, 1300,
1400, 1530, 1730 hrs. with a last turn after 2000 hrs. Regular
candling and weighing monitored the development of the embryos
and allowed adjustments to be made for correct weight loss of 15%
to pip (Jones, 1984).

incubation period of 31 and 33 - 34 days. This can only be
estimated, since after laying three eggs and appearing to have
started full incubation, the young female laid a further two eggs of
which the exact date of lay is unknown. The second smaller chick
(23.6.91) took approximately seventy-seven hours and thirty min-
utes from chipping to drying after hatching, compared to approxi-
mately twenty four hours for its sibling. After each chick had dried
it was weighed (first chick hatched 17.6.91, 13.0 g; second chick
hatched 23.6.91, 11.5 g) and then placed in a tissue lined bowl (the
lining was later changed to disinfected gravel and twigs to prevent
splayed legs; Weaver and Cade, 1985), in a still air Curfew 146
incubator. This was set at 36 0 C maximum with two water trays
underneath providing some humidity. Vocalisation between the
two chicks was important and,, when the smaller chick gained
strength, physical contact was possible with both chicks contained
within the same bowl. Both chicks were given their first feed no
later than five hours after hatching (Jones, 1984). The internal
organs of white mice, Mus musculus were used (excluding intesti-
nal tract) moistened in cooled boiled water. Food was offered with
tweezers, five times per day initially (0700, 1100, 1430, 1730 and
2200 hrs.) with an eight hour gap overnight. This was decreased at
8 and 9 days old respectively to four feeds per day which continued
for the duration of hand-rearing. Food consumption for each of the
kestrel chicks varied at each feed from 0.3 g at day 0 (where day 0
= day of hatch) to 4.0 g at ten days. A pinch of calcium lactate was
used twice daily, with the inclusion of tiny fragments of mouse
bone at two days old providing further calcium. Vionate powder
multi-vitamin supplement was used with a pinch given every two
days. By days three and four, very finely chopped skinned mouse
flesh was fed (still excluding the intestinal tract) and, at seven days,
small quantities of mouse fur were added. As rearing progressed,
the pieces of food offered were gradually increased in size and the
chicks were able to snatch food from the tweezers as their coordi-
nation improved. Day old chicks were occasionally used (from day
3) during rearing. The young kestrels were weighed before and
after every feed during hand rearing.
In view of the inexperience of the younger pair of kestrels and
the availability of an excellent pair for foster rearing, only the older
chick was returned to its natural parents, whilst the younger chick
was fostered. The two chicks had received twelve and thirteen days
of hand-rearing each, and weighed 51.5 g and 61.1 g respectively.
Both chicks were placed in their nest boxes and dummy eggs
removed at no later than 0930 hrs. (approximately two hours after
their previous feed), to allow maximum observation of the behav-

iour of the kestrel pairs before dusk. A supply of mice was left in
the outer portion of the nestbox and on a food platform, which was
replenished twice during the day. This practice continued until
post fledging (further mice were always placed on the food plat-
form rather than disturb the birds at the nestbox). The nestboxes
were closely observed and for the first two days were checked three
times daily, to ensure the well being of the kestrel chicks.
Fortunately on returning to their nestboxes, after dummy eggs had
been exchanged for chicks, both females immediately assumed
protective roles brooding their young, whilst the males promptly
delivered mice from the food platform. Later each female could be
heard breaking up mice into pieces to feed to an extremely vocal
chick. (It was only when both chicks were approximately 20 days
old that either male was permitted to feed them directly, rather than
delivering food to the female). From day three onwards the nestbox
was checked once daily. This did not disturb the kestrels unduly.
After one week each chick was removed briefly for weighing and
a physical examination. Neither chick was handled again until
their removal from the aviary post fledging.
The young kestrels fledged at 37 and 38 days old, spending the
majority of time at the front of the nestbox for several days prior to
this. Initially both fledglings continued to be fed by the adults,
even though one was observed feeding independently four days
after leaving the nestbox. The same juvenile persisted in chasing
the adults, often singling out the male, and then attempting to
snatch food (as it was no longer given voluntarily) until at least 69
days after fledging. Once fledged some characteristic kestrel
behaviour was observed e.g. head bobbing, in particular when
watching wild birds outside the aviary. Both juveniles also exhib-
ited what could only be described as &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; behaviour, breaking off
and collecting twigs and manipulating them between the beak and
toes, flying to the ground to retrieve them if they were dropped.
Twigs and small pieces of bark were also regularly deposited
indoors. Both kestrels remained with the adults until 210 and 204
days old respectively, before being removed from their aviaries.
Separation was slightly earlier than anticipated due to some chas-
ing of each of the young kestrels by the adult pairs. Observations
in the wild show that fledged kestrels may remain within their
parents&apos; home range until they are about 300 days old, and the
onset of another breeding season (Jones, 1987). On removal both
kestrels were sexed by weight and wing length as a male and female
(male, 146 g, right wing length 179 mm; female, 211 g, right wing

length 191 mm).
These young kestrels and any bred in future years will not be
destined to return to Mauritius, since their programme is self
supporting, producing enough birds for reintroduction to areas of
former habitation, and indeed to new locations not known to have
held kestrel populations in the past (Jones et al, 1991). The
establishment of breeding pairs of Mauritius Kestrels at Jersey
Wildlife Preservation Trust and in the future at other collections in
the British Isles or elsewhere will provide a useful reservoir of birds
outside Mauritius.

As Laura Paterson explained in the Avicultural Magazine, Vol.
98, 2: 44 - 47, Von der Decken&apos;s Hornbill Tockus deckeni and
Jackson&apos;s Hornbill closely resemble each other, the only difference
being the latter&apos;s white spotted wing-coverts. Some early authors
thought, mistakenly, thatthe latter was the juvenile formof Von der
Decken&apos;s Hornbill, while some modern authors put the &amp;quot;differ-
ences&amp;quot; down to individual variation or treat Jackson&apos;s as a race of
the former. Others regard them as two distinct species.

Von der Decken&apos;s Hornbill is named after Baron Carl Claus Von
der Decken, who arrived in East Africain 1859 and who is credited
with having made the earliest collection of birds there. He was
murdered on the Juba River in Somalia in 1865. Jackson&apos;s Hornbill
is one of several East African birds bearing the name jacksoni , the
best known in avicultural circles being Jackson&apos;s Widowbird Eu-

landed first at Lamu in 1884, in pursuit of &apos;sport&apos; and to study the

expedition in search of Stanley&apos;s relief force and later became an
official of the British Government, serving as Lieutenant Governor
of what became Kenya. He ended his career as Governor of
Uganda. His major work The Birds of Kenya Colony and the
Uganda Protectorate ( Gurney &amp; Jackson, London), was incom-
plete when he died in 1929. It was completed after his death and
published in 1938 in three volumes which remain sought after and

Young female Jackson&apos;s Hornbill. Both photos show the white spotted wing-coverts
Publication of the article about the breeding of Von der Deck-
en&apos;s Hornbill coincided with my clearing through a pile of old
papers, among which was a note taken from the National Museum
of Kenya, Section of Ornithology, Newsletter No 42, written, I
think, by Cunningham van Someren. The question was posed, are
Von der Decken&apos;s and Jackson&apos;s Hornbills separate species or is
Von der Decken&apos;s possibly a morph or phase which lacks spotting
on the wing-coverts? Apparently there are, in the National Collec-
tion, specimens of typical Von der Decken&apos;s and Jackson&apos;s Horn-
bills and, most interestingly, all sorts of intermediate spotted
forms. To me the obvious question which seemed not to be asked
was &amp;quot;are those intermediate forms perhaps a result of the ranges of
these two hornbills overlapping, maybe only &apos;accidentally&apos;, and
their &apos;interbreeding&apos;?&amp;quot; It is fairly simple to check the localities
where the intermediate specimens were collected and judge whether

this is likely. The question posed by the intermediate forms appears
not to have been considered by the authors of Birds of East Africa,
edited by Britton (1980), and widely regarded as the definitive
work on the region. Of Jackson&apos;s Hornbill, it stated &amp;quot;We follow
North &amp; McChesney (1964) in regarding this as a species distinct
from T. deckeni ,&amp;quot; adding later that this (Jackson&apos;s) and the eastern
T. deckeni are virtually allopatric (i.e. mutually exclusive geo-
graphically) and are &amp;quot;not known to occur on the same ground.&amp;quot;
Within East Africa (Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania) Jackson&apos;s Horn-
bill occurs in north-eastern Uganda and north-western Kenya and
Von der Decken&apos;s is found mainly on the eastern plateau of Kenya,
south to central Tanzania. Such is their pattern of distribution,
particularly to the west and south of Lake Turkana, northern Kenya,
that it is difficult to believe the two do not, if only occasionally,
occur on the same ground. Both occupy similar habitat. Before
expressing an opinion as to the status of these hornbills, I would
like to examine the intermediate forms and know where they were
collected and what caused Mackworth-Praed &amp; Grant (1957) to
state &amp;quot;the differences are no doubt individual and not specific.&amp;quot;
How Von der Decken's, Jackson&apos;s, the Red-billed T. erythro-
rhynchus , Yellow-billed T. flavirostris , Grey Hornbill T. nasutus
and, perhaps the rare Hemprich&apos;s Hornbill T. hemprichii, manage
to co-exist alongside each other in the East African bush would
make fascinating ecological studies.
In an outside aviary of the Bird House at London Zoo, a pair of
Jackson&apos;s Hornbills reared five young between 1975 and 1977. A
colour photo taken there of a male, incorrectly captioned as a race
of the Red-billed Hornbill, can be seen in Keeping Softbilled Birds
(1980). In the Avicultural Magazine , Vol. 82, 2: 69 - 72, I wrote
about handrearing Jackson&apos;s Hornbills in Kenya.

BREEDING THE MEXICAN BLUEBIRD

These notes are on an &apos;old&apos; pair and their chicks which nested to
several generations. For simplicity, the first nesting will be
described right through, with additional information as needed. I
am indebted to a Belgian friend, Paul Vercammen, for the loan of
the original breeding pair and for information and suggestions. The
attractive Mexican or Western Bluebird Sialia mexicana is one of
three species, all of the same size and of similar habits, and all from
N. America. The cock S. mexicana is a startling bright deep blue,
with black tipped wing and tail feathers edged with very pale grey.
This blue colour is seen at its best in sunlight. The chest is a dull
rusty red. The hen is a paler, soft grey-blue. In spring, the cock
weighed 24.5 gm and the hen 26.25gm.
Bluebirds are cavity nesters and, although most migrate, they
are known for squeezing to capacity into boxes at night in the
winter to keep warm. They like an open habitat and are post-
perchers, where they sit and scan the ground for insects and also
take airborne prey. With their long pointed wings, they are fast and
manoeuvrable and commonly hover over grass before pouncing.
Although placed in the thrush family, they act like typical flycatch-
ers. Though not aggressive, Bluebirds can hold their own in a
mixed collection, mainly because of their swift flight. An excep-
tion to this was seen when a large cock Shama, weighing 30 gm and
looking twice the size of the Bluebirds because of his 6.5&amp;quot; / 16 cm
tail, was put into a large indoor cage with a young pair which were
showing interest in a nest box. The screeching Shama was imme-
diately pinned down by the young cock. In the aviary they show
no inclination to territorial behaviour, except close to the nest (and
to other Bluebirds at nesting time). Their only drawback as aviary
birds is that they are inclined to sit still for quite long spells and are
like the Fairy Bluebird /. puella in this respect. A big advantage is
that pairs are friendly the year round and the birds will flock out of
the breeding season.
The pair was housed in a well-planted 11&apos; x 15 &apos; (3.35 m x 4.6
m) roofed-over aviary. Preferred perches were open, dead branches
and a high roof beam. The only time they ever went into a bush was

to feed chicks which had climbed into cover and they remained on
the ground only long enough to snatch up an insect. They always
slept on the beam at night, either huddled together or a little way
apart, even in cold weather. By contrast, a young pair kept in a 5&apos;
(1.5 m) long indoor cage always slept in a nestbox. At my friend&apos;s
they did well in an unplanted 8&apos; x 3&apos; (2.4 mxl m) aviary and even
nested in a 30&amp;quot; x 15&amp;quot; x 15&amp;quot; (76 cm x 38 cm x 38 cm) cage. A large
dish of water was always available but, in contrast to most other
softbills, the Bluebirds bathed infrequently, perhaps about once a
week and then only in warm weather. Once the hen took a bath
when she was incubating and became so wet she could not fly up to
the nest. She was dried with that invaluable piece of avicultural
equipment, the hairdryer, and went back on the eggs immediately.
Typically, when Bluebirds do bathe, they get really soaked.
The Bluebirds proved to be one of the most trouble- and
accident-free species ever kept. A problem was encountered on the
day the first clutch hatched. Apiece of grass was seen hanging from
the hen&apos;s bill and she could not dislodge it. Previously, this had
been the cause of death in a nesting Dhyal Bird C. saularis. Shortly
afterwards she was caught out of the nestbox but the grass had gone.
On one occasion a young pair caught mites around the beak from a
supposedly healthy canary which was being boarded. They were
easily treated with a &apos;no-pest strip&apos;. Apart from that, all the birds
were healthy and remain so. At the time of writing, the oldest is
five.
The vocal range of this species is limited. The main call is a soft
&apos;twhee-oo&apos;, which is repeated endlessly by the courting male. He
also has a dawn territorial song of three to four low-pitched phrases
- the above &apos;twhee-oo&apos; sung twice, then a &apos;tehee,&apos; with a three-click
phrase sung inconsistently at the end, all in quick succession.
When separated, both birds &apos;twheeoo&apos; to each other, and this is
about the only sound the quiet hen makes except for an occasional
quiet chirp. Rarely, the cocks set up an angry chatter, usually at a
crow. The young cock in the indoor cage was heard in spring to
make a limited but not unpleasant warbling for hours at a time in
front of a nest box, in the presence of the hen. The others would
certainly have warbled like this outside but it would have been too
quiet to hear.
In the wild the birds eat mostly flying insects. When they were
obtained, the old pair was on a diet of powdered dog food and this
convenient habit was passed on to the chicks. They soon adopted
the standard in-house diet of peanut butter and margarine sand-

wiches (chopped) and, of course, mealworms. Although widely
reported anecdotes in books have them eating lots of berries
(probably mostly hearsay), none of the birds took readily to these,
but eventually most regularly included chopped grapes and small
blueberries in their diet. All other berries, hard and soft, including
elderberries, were ignored. They also reluctantly took very small
skinny earthworms but their dainty beaks precluded their eating
larger ones and they clearly did not prefer worms. Grasshoppers
were given when available and these were relished. No seed or
greenfood of any kind was ever eaten.
No particular courting behaviour was observed, but the cock
was very attentive. He flew everywhere close to the hen and fed her
to repletion. When full, she refused the extra mealworm, but often
he poked persistently at her beak until, with a great effort, she
swallowed the offering. Bluebirds nest in just about any kind of box
and used quite a variety. When given a choice, they preferred a
lovebird box, placed sideways so that the depth was only 1.75&amp;quot; (4.5
cm) below the entrance, which was now at one end. A 1.5&amp;quot; or 2&amp;quot;
(4 cm or 5 cm) hole was drilled in the various boxes, and a slight
preference was shown for the larger size. They always chose the
highest placed box, i.e. at about 7' (2.1 m). The first box used was
made from 5 / 16 ,(8 mm) plywood. Because the first clutch expired
at about five days when it turned cold, and the base of the nest was
always left unfinished, an extra piece of wood was glued to the
underside of the box. Although it was never proved that cold had
anything to do with this first failure, all other clutches hatched.
Cardboard boxes were also used. Nestbuilding was done only by
the hen. Although a wide variety of material was available, nests
were constructed of rather coarse dried grass only, with a sugges-
tion of a lining made with a few bits of finer grass. The nest was
a 2.5&amp;quot; (6.4 cm ) cup with very tapered sides. Although grass
covered all the floor, the maximum depth was 1.325&amp;quot; (4.2 cm). The
bottom of the nest was always left open to the wood. This might be
covered with wood chips or decaying soft wood in the wild, but
these were not supplied because of previous bad luck with Austral-
ian parrakeets smothering the young in such material. However, a
young hen filled a box with pine needles and stems, using grass only
to line the cup itself, and also made a !4&amp;quot; (7 mm) base on the nest
which she built in only two days.
Bluebirds are probably quite short-lived because the normal
clutch is five to six eggs, with at least two broods in a season. The
pale sky-blue eggs are smallish, averaging 20 x 15.5 mm compared

with 22.5 x 16.5 mm for the three-egg clutch of the Mesia
Leiothrix argentauris , a bird of equal weight. There is often a one
day gap between the fourth and fifth eggs. Dates of laying ranged
from 8th May to 14th July and all hatched, with the exception of the
above-mentioned first clutch. The hen was left to sit out the addled
clutch for two weeks when the eggs were removed. Eight days later,
she laid another five. Eggs were usually laid by first light but in this
instance, the last was laid at 10 am. The hen was a nervous sitter,
and came out of the box every time I entered the aviary, but this
probably had to do with the fact that she was quite tame, and was
looking for a live food handout. The cock never incubated and
whenever the hen came off to feed, he became exceedingly anxious.
She often sat at the dish while the cock scooped up mealworms and
fed her, then he would fly to the entrance hole with a larva to
encourage the hen to return. When she was sitting, the cock sat well
away from the nest. At night, the male slept on his usual beam.
The last egg hatched at 13 days and the chicks were dark, pink-
tinged grey with a few wisps of dark grey down on their heads.
Their beaks and gape were an ivory white (adult beaks are black).
Chicks were hard to count at first for they stayed in a tight heap and
could not be persuaded to beg for supplemental feeding although,
as it turned out, they did not need this. Later on, they were always
found lined up facing away from the entrance hole and at the
furthest corner from it. When examined, they lay down and closed
their eyes. From day one, they cheeped to be fed. Right away, the
cock did much of the feeding taking the food to the box entrance
where he gave it to the hen, who in turn fed the chicks. If the hen
was out, the cock went into the box and fed the chicks himself.
Preferred food was wax moth larvae with mealworms added on the
third day. They always fed the largest mealworms first. For later
broods, grasshoppers were appreciated but maggots (blowfly lar-
vae) were not touched. Some broods at Paul Vercammen&apos;s were
raised successfully on small mealworms, dampened and rolled in
powdered dog food. After ten days, the cock began to feed chopped
grapes and added a few small earthworms to the menu of the loudly
clamouring chicks. The hen never fed either of these to the chicks,
but later acquired a taste for grapes. She fed the chicks sparsely
from day 12 on, and only occasionally once they left the box. The
cock sometimes brooded the chicks for a short time when the hen
was off during a cold spell. Both parents removed the faecal sacs
but did not drop them. Strangely they carefully smeared them on
to a few selected branches.

If six eggs had been laid there was usually an even split of the
sexes while out of five eggs, two would be males. The young can
be sexed once the wing feathers are well out. Then (at twelve days)
the cocks show bright blue on the primaries, while the hens have
only limited dull blue on their mainly grey feathers. Later, though,
both have blue on the tail feathers which is brighter and more
extensive in the young cocks. Other feathers on both sexes are dark
grey with a light grey or off-white edging. At thirteen days, their
beaks started to go black at the tips. The chicks left the nest at 17
or 18 days, and remained silent and motionless in thick cover for
another three days, cheeping only when a parent showed up with
food. All had rusty spots on the breast by this time, as well as a
faint, pale eye ring. Three days later, their beaks were completely
dark grey, but the gapes were still white. On the fourth day both
parents began to carry grass about and visit the box. Later the same
evening, the cock suddenly and violently attacked a screaming
female chick. Seven days after leaving, the 25 day -old young were
only being fed sporadically, so were removed. They flew well, but
made a poor job of landing. The following morning, the least
advanced chick, a male, was sitting fluffed and miserable, so he
was put back with the parents. The father immediately fed him six
large mealworms and then forced a seventh down. On that day,
when the chicks were 26 days old, the hen laid again. Five days
later, the young cock was missing and was found hiding in the box
beside the sitting hen. He was presumably trying to get away from
the adult male and so was replaced with his siblings. At 39 days,
the most advanced (female) chick was seen feeding a mealworm to
another chick. At two months, this mutual feeding was still going
on. By the autumn, the chicks had shed their not unattractive body
feathers and moulted beautifully into adult plumage.

By Richard Perron (Varel, Germany)
Aviculturists need to offer their ornithological charges a large
degree of freedom where they can feel relaxed and behave as
naturally as possible. This environment promotes a healthy bird
and stimulates breeding. One solution I have found is to allow some
of my non-passerines free access to my extensive back garden and
the small shallow pond it contains. The entire complex of aviaries
and garden is surrounded by a wire fence which separates the
aviculture from the house and front garden.
At the end of March I collected six ten-day old Emus, Dromaius
novaehollandiae, from a friend as part of a swap arrangement. A
constant temperature of about 25 *C is essential at that age, so I had
prepared a small room with both central heating pipes and a
hanging heating lamp. Smooth floors can result in accidents and
sand is likely to be eaten causing problems in the digestive system,
so I prefer wood shavings for very young Emus. As with all ratites,
particular care needs to be taken in the first six weeks to ensure the
proper nutritional balance is maintained otherwise Metabolic Bone
Disease will cause distorted bones, splayed feet and impaired
mobility. A mixture of commercial piglet feed, with a low protein
content, and grated vegetables, supplemented with a vitamin com-
pound, worked very well and the chicks grew rapidly. After four
weeks sheep pellets, containing a higher Ca/P ratio, were intro-
duced into the diet, gradually becoming the sole food.
As the weather improved at the beginning of May I moved them
to an outside hut with it&apos;s own heating lamp. For the first three days
I kept them locked up so that they would become accustomed to the
new system of feeding and drinking before allowing them out into
the adjacent enclosure. Within a fortnight after that I was able to
open the connecting gate and leave them to roam free throughout
the garden. It gave me special pleasure to observe their boisterous,
playful antics when bathing or chasing each other through the dense
undergrowth of the numerous bushes or around the fruit trees.
Everything appeared ideal; the sociable and inquisitive birds had
plenty of freedom, could return whenever they wanted to their own
hut and pen for shade or seclusion and were able to avail themselves
of a wider variety of natural foodstuffs, like insects, leaves and
grass, in addition to their basic diet. Our spring and early summer
has been unusually warm and dry giving the rapidly developing

young Emus a real taste of their natural Australian climate and they
thrived on it.
On Friday evening, 31st July, I brought the daily ration of feed
into their hut and found the previous day&apos;s pellets only half eaten.
The day had been quite hot and I assumed the Emus had no appetite.
Leaving the uneaten food where it was, I returned the new supply
to the hopper. Later that evening, as usual, I did my rounds of the
various enclosures and flights where my birds are kept and returned
to the Emu pen in expectation of finding them back for the night.
I found all six, some huddled together and some stretched out alone,
dead within a radius of five metres.
After twenty years of breeding animals some losses, though
always tragic, are to be expected, but this was almost beyond my
comprehension. My first reaction was disbelief, closely followed
by sadness and anger. Anger because it is virtually impossible for
all six birds to drop dead simultaneously from an illness without
having shown any prior symptoms and that could only mean
malicious and deliberate poisoning or shooting. Of course, I could
not even think of who might have done it. Closer examination of
the bodies quickly ruled out at least shooting by a calibre rifle or
pistol - no obvious skin punctures were found. A search of the
perimeter fence area also yielded no trace of poisoned bait or
anything abnormal. On Saturday I took the carcasses to the
veterinary research laboratory in Oldenburg for analysis. My
weekend was then taken up with paranoid fantasies and an intense
search through all the books I possessed which might lend a clue as
to the cause of death. Everything from Avian Pox to Zoonotic
diseases was considered without enlightenment and I had to wait
impatiently until Monday afternoon to hear the autopsy report.
The painful reality was that the birds had indeed been poisoned,
but from eating the leaves and berries of the Yew tree Taxus
baccata. I didn&apos;t know what a Yew tree looked like and because
of my botanical ignorance this telephoned news confirmed that
someone had thrown clippings over the fence to destroy my Emus.
A feverish search again of my library produced details of the tree
and the prosaic truth. This attractive little evergreen was actually
planted outside the perimeter fence and over the years had gradu-
ally grown through the wire by the garden gate. Generations of
emus, cassowaries, peacocks, chickens, sheep, cats and dogs had
survived the temptation to taste this lush greenery with succulent
ripe red berries and I had taken less notice of it than I had of the
grass growing over the path.

A reconstruction of events suggests that the emus had eaten their
pellet meal of Wednesday during the evening and probably finished
the rest on Thursday morning. Subsequently, one of them had
discovered the Yew tree poking through the fence and (herd instinct
prevailing) they had all eaten a quantity of the bush (between a
quarter and one half of the stomach contained Yew leaves and
berries, the rest contained sheep feed and some indigestible objects
like stones, lengths of silicone window insulation, pieces of broken
china and Coca-cola can strips!). Thursday night they felt unwell
and had only sampled the new supply of sheep feed, dying one after
another during the period Thursday night to Friday. Because of the
close relationship between the birds each was unwilling, despite
itself feeding sick, to move far from the other. Under the principle
of the Three Musketeers, All For One and One For All , the emus
ate, suffered and died together.
Taxus baccata has long been recognised (by those in the know)
as a poisonous plant, particularly for horses and cattle, but the
literature only mentions domestic poultry and geese, partridges,
pheasants and swans among birds as being in danger. The poison
secreted by the plant is a toxic alkaloid called Taxine which attacks
the involuntary muscles of the heart and viscera within a few hours
of ingestion. Death is caused by heart failure and subsequent
cessation of the oxygen supply to the brain. Outward indications
of this poisoning probably do not appear until death is imminent
when staggering may be apparent.
In fact, there are numerous plants and trees which are quite
likely to be in our gardens and aviaries, parts of which are classified
as dangerous if eaten. The Eucalyptus, Oak, Oleander, Horse

plants. The list of potentially dangerous grasses includes all of the
Panicum genus (Millet, Sweet Grass, Yabila Grass etc.), Canary
Grass, Rhompa Grass, Yellow Bristle Grass, Marsh Arrowgrass,
and all the Sorghums (Johnson Grass, Sudan Grass etc.). Although
the soft fruit surrounding them may be perfectly edible, the seeds
inside the nuts of cherry, plum, apricot, peach and bitter almond are
poisonous. Mushrooms and toadstools must not be forgotten either.
The dangers should not be exaggerated nor ignored. All of the
above plants have been the cause of death or severe poisoning in
birds or mammals and the final list of toxic plants must be much
longer since not all avian or animal fatalities are investigated, nor
all the causes of death established.
In the wild, species have hereditary information, parental expe-
rience and peer group example to guide them as well as a wide
variety of foodstuffs to taste personally and to discover in small
quantities. Limited or selective consumption of toxic plants is
possible, the Blackbird and Thrush eat the ripe red berries of the
Yew tree - excreting the central (poisonous) seed, and genetic
adaption protects many species. Exposure to foreign plants in the
restricted environment of captive breeding, in situations far re-
moved from their own natural habitats, pose important questions
and responsibilities concerning the domestic botanical species
available and the regime under which birds live.
It is my responsibility to be aware of what lives and exists in my
domain. Being the first aviculturist ever to discover that Taxus
haccata is a lethal toxicant for Emus, genetically programmed for
life in Australia, is no consolation for the loss of my birds. As their
keeper and guardian I neglected my responsibilities to the extent
that they died, and that is almost unforgivable. However, one way
in which I can atone for this neglect is to make sure that others are
promptly and adequately informed and that no excuse exists for
similar ignorance.
As an aviculturist I have not expressed much interest in Botany
previously, but all things change.

BREEDING THE EMERALD LORIKEET

By Peter S. Clear (Goring-by-Sea)
During the past 10 years a very large number of Lories has been
imported into this country. In 1986 excitement was felt by Lory
enthusiasts when, for the first time for more than 30 years, Musschen-
broeks Lorikeets Neopsittacus musschenbroekii became available.
These birds are about 23 cm long, their general plumage is green,
the crown and nape are olive-brown streaked with dull yellow, the
cheeks are olive-brown streaked with yellowish-green, the throat,
breast and abdomen are red, the tail is green, tipped with yellow,
basally marked with red and the underside of the tails is bright
orange-yellow. The bill is pale yellow, the iris red and the legs are
grey. There are two sub-species N. m. medius and N. m. major but
they are not very different from the nominate race.
I acquired five of these birds. It was known that the species is
not wholly dependant on a nectar diet and requires a fair amount of
seed. A study of their eating habits was undertaken to determine
their dietary requirements. Accordingly, various seeds were of-
fered, including sunflower, canary, safflower, groats, wheat and
millet sprays. As a result a basic parrot mixture containing mainly
sunflower seed and small amounts of wheat, maize and groats was
developed. Safflower and canary seed given in separate dishes
complete the diet. Various fresh fruits were offered but soft fruits
such as blackberry, raspberry, peaches and nectarines were ig-
nored, the birds&apos; preference being for apple, pear and grapes.
Soaked sultanas and raisins were relished as were dried figs cut in
half and squeezed through the wire netting, for the birds to pick out
all the seeds and pulp. Their liquid diet consisted of the standard
mixture for all my Lories, which is mainly a blend of baby food,
fruits and vegetables, sugars, soya flour and vitamin preparations
dissolved in water.
During my studies of their diet and habits, I noticed that one of
the birds was smaller, its beak was orange, the red of its breast
extended more across the chest and abdomen, and the under tail
colour was greenish-yellow. After consulting various books, I
realised that I had an Emerald Lorikeet Neopsittacus pullicauda.
This species is found between 2400 m and 3800 m in the mountains
of south eastern New Guinea from west Irian to the Sepik region
east of the Huon peninsula and southern Papua. The habitat
sometimes overlaps with that of the Musschenbroek&apos;s which are

mainly present in the mid mountain forests. Their upper parts are
green, with the crown lightly streaked with yellowish-green, the
nape with olive-brown, and the cheeks with dull yellow. The
throat, chest and abdomen are bright red, as also are the under wing
coverts and a broad band across the underside of the flight feathers.
The tail is green above, marked with red at the base and its
underside is a dull olive-green. The bill is orange and the legs are
grey.
At this time I knew that there were two cocks in the country but
I was unable to locate them until 1989 when I managed to find a
fellow aviculturist who had a cock bird. An agreement was made
for me to have it on a breeding loan but, unfortunately, it died
before I could collect it. Not knowing if I should ever acquire a
cock bird for my hen, which had laid eggs for the previous two
years, I decided, against my principles, to mate her with a cock
Musschenbroek&apos;s with the intention of, over a period of years,
breeding out any characteristics of the Musschenbroek&apos;s. After a
period of minor bickering upon introduction, they settled down and
produced two chicks, which left the nest at 55 days but, for some
unknown reason, died whey they were 60 and 61 days old.
In the meantime, I managed to acquire a cock Emerald from a
small importation. At an appropriate time I placed the two of them,
in cages, side by side and later released them into an aviary
measuring 6&apos; x 4&apos; x 6&apos; 6&amp;quot;, with a small covered shelter at one end and
the floor covered with washed beach pebbles. The enclosure
contained no vegetation, natural perches of different sizes were
used, with a small hollow tree trunk hung horizontally.
Two nest boxes 5&amp;quot; x 5&amp;quot; x 10&amp;quot; were supplied with a mixture of
equal parts of peat and wood shavings for bedding. In 1991 two
eggs were laid but these were infertile. In March 1992 again two
eggs were laid, these were fertile and the incubation period was
approximately 24 days. Two chicks hatched on 11th April, one of
which left the nest on 28th May and the other on the following day.
Their heads were a medium shade of green suffused with faint
striations. There was a distinctive yellow band across the brow and
the cheeks were streaked with pale yellow, the back, rump and body
were green, the upper breast was a light shade of red, extending
across to the shoulders, the belly was a darker shade of red,
separated from the breast by a band of green. The upper wing
coverts were green, the primaries dark green edged with yellow, the
under wing bright red and the flight feathers black. The short tail
was green on the upper side and yellowish underneath. The beak

was horn coloured and the feet were light grey with dark nails.
They were a little smaller in body size than their mother.
The only addition to their diet during their weaning was about
20 mealworms a day. During the latter part of July, some feathers
were removed for chromosomal sexing. The results indicated that
they were two hens which I found surprising because, with other
species of Lories, I have found that pairs having two chicks
invariably have a cock and hen. It is hoped that, with close
cooperation with two other Avicultural Society members, our joint
breeding stocks will ensure the maintenance of this species in the
U.K.

By Duncan A. Bolton, (Bristol Zoo).
The Peruvian Thick-knee Burhinus superciliaris is typical of its
genus. It is about 38 cm tall with long legs and a large rounded
head. The crown is bordered by a black band with a prominent
superciliary white line and a black area behind the eye. The upper
body is buffish with fine crescent markings and dusky bars. Below
it is a paler buff. The iris is off-white, the bill is short with the
upper mandible black and the lower mandible greenish. The legs
are greenish grey. The sexes are alike, subtle differences between
our birds being noticeable only when the pair are together. They
inhabit the coastal and semi-arid zones of South America,their
breeding range extending along the coast from Southern Equador
through Peru to Northern Chile.
Bristol Zoo purchased two pairs of wild caught birds in 1985.
They were housed initially in the tropical bird house where eggs
were laid in 1986. These eggs failed to hatch but it is not recorded
whether they were fertile or not. In July 1987 the pairs were moved
to two separate outdoor aviaries. Despite their settling well the
birds exhibited no further nesting activity and, in January 1991, all
four birds were moved again into one aviary where they settled
down and where no aggression was observed.
From the time of their arrival the Thick-knees have had access
to a wide variety of food, including fruit, minced meat and live-
food suitable for a mixed exhibit of softbills. During 1990 the diets
of all the birds at the zoo were modified. For the Thick-knees the
protein content was increased and the diet consists now of minced
meat, cheese, rice, an insectivorous mixture and various live-foods
which, with meat, appear to be the favourite. The aviary presently
inhabited has no shelter although one side is solid and about one
third of the roof is covered. We therefore keep a close eye on the
birds in winter. Other birds in the aviary include a pair of
Rothschild's Mynahs, Leucopsar rothschildi and a breeding pair of
Chestnut-naped Imperial Pigeons Ducula aenea paulina.
No breeding activity occurred during 1991 and the birds remained
in the aviary during the mild winter until the spring of 1992. As
the spring progressed one pair began to dominate the other and to
restrict them to a smaller area of the aviary. On 28th March the hen
of the dominant pair laid an egg during the early afternoon. The

nest was a very shallow scrape in an area with forest bark forming
the substrate. It was next to a window along side the public footpath
and so window paint was applied to the bottom 30 cm to give some
privacy to the incubating bird. A second egg was laid two days
later, again in the afternoon. The birds became very protective to

were a light creamy-buff heavily mottled all over with dark choco-
late blotches. On 12th April one egg had disappeared. The second
was found damaged and stuck to the underside of the incubating
bird two days later. The subordinate pair may have been causing
problems, although no evidence of this was seen, and they were
removed to a separate aviary. Two more eggs were laid on the
opposite side of the aviary, away from the path, on 25th and 27th
April. Incubation commenced and all went well until 8th May when
one egg had disappeared. The second was transferred to the
incubator. This egg was fertile but development had ceased quite
early on. A fifth egg was laid on 21st May, being the only one of

incubation which continued beyond the 15 day stage until 18th June
when a chick hatched. Thus the incubation period for this species
is 28 days. The parents became very protective and even more
aggressive than they were during incubation. The chick was very
well camouflaged on the ground against which it would flatten
itself at the slightest sign of danger. It was generally buff coloured
with four dark stripes running down the back. The dark band around
the crown was present on hatching. The legs were slate blue. The
chick was capable of walking on the day it hatched and followed
its parents closely. The parents fed to the chick the extra live-food
which was provided several times a day.
The chick is now (September 1992) independent of its parents
from which it differs by the possession of an extra dark band around
the crown. This is probably the first breeding of this species in the
UK but, in other collections, eggs have been laid. Two chicks were
hatched at Harewood Bird Gardens this year but were not reared.

The genus Vini is represented by five species of which I am
fortunate to care for the Tahitian Blue Lory, Vini peruviana , and
the Blue-crowned Lory, Vini australis , at the San Diego Zoological
Society.
The Blue-crowned Lory is truly an artist&apos;s palette. Its body is
bright green, more iridescent on the rump and upper tail. The lower
tail is yellow. A red bib extends from the lower mandible and eyes
to the upper breast, and red appears on the abdomen as well. The
thighs and lower abdomen are purple and the undertail coverts are
greenish-yellow. The crown is indigo blue highlighted with shaft-
streaks of bright sky blue. Orange brightens the legs and bill and
the iris is brownish-orange. This species is monomorphic and is 7.5
inches (19 cm) in length. Immature birds have shorter crown
feathers, and less red on the throat. The rump is blue and they have
smaller amounts of red and purple on the lower abdomen and
thighs. The iris is brown and the bill is tipped with brown.
In the wild this lorikeet can be found on Samoa (excluding
Tutuila), Tonga, and islands in central Polynesia and Lau Archi-
pelago, Fiji. It is erratically distributed, being more common on
some islands. The Blue-crowned apparently migrates and follows
the flowering of coconut palms, Hibiscus and Erythrina. However,
island populations are inherently small and all of the genus face
problems from habitat destruction and predator introduction.
The San Diego Zoo has kept Blue-crowned Lories in previous
years. In fact, the prestigious Bean Award was granted to the
Zoological Society in 1973 for the first captive breeding of Vini
australis. However, they had not been a part of our collection for
many years until we received two pairs in April 1991. They were
accommodated in cages 4&apos; wide by 8&apos; high by 12&apos; long (1.2 m x 2.4
m x 3.7 m), one third of which are solid panels for protection from
the elements. Potted plants, for example Ficus benjamina and
bamboo, were provided for perching, cover and amusement. The
diet for the Blue-crowned Lories consists of nectar and fruits. We
use a nectar originally formulated by Milton Scott at Cornell
University. It contains blended apples, carrots, raisins, Zeigler
lory pre-mix, wheat bread, lettuce, neocalglucon (a calcium source)

and water. Because of the warm weather in San Diego, we worry
about spoilage of nectar. Therefore, the birds receive nectar for
four hours in the morning and then fruit, usually apples, papaya or
pears, in the afternoon. The fruit pan also includes chopped greens,
five mealworms per bird, neocalglucon and superpreen (a vitamin
source). When chicks are in the nest, the birds receive a second
helping of nectar in the afternoon.
Lories are active, energetic, playful birds, and Blue-crowned
are no exception. Morning finds them in a game of tag until
breakfast is served and eventhen they compete forsupremacy atthe
food dish. Mutual preening can develop into play at any time.
Some lories, and it seems Vini species in particular, have a habit of
&amp;quot;waving&amp;quot; at their mate to induce play. One foot is lifted, then
opened and closed repeatedly towards another bird as if to say
&amp;quot;Look! Come over here and play with me.&amp;quot; These birds are
practically non-stop action from dawn until dusk. Breeding behav-
iour is also exuberant. The male approaches the female with rapid
hops along the perch. Head bobbing with feathers puffed up and a
curious side-to-side sway takes place and is followed by copulation
with the male on top of the female.
We supplied our pairs with boot type nest boxes measuring 18&amp;quot;
tall x 8&amp;quot; square x 16&amp;quot; long (45.7 cm x 20.3 x 40.6). They were hung
in the keeper aisle way to provide easy access. The entrance hole
was surrounded by cork bark on the bird&apos;s side to attract their
interest and to look natural. Pine shavings were used for nesting
material. On 19th January one pair laid its first egg which was
followed by a second on 20th January. The female abandoned the
nest on the 22nd and so we removed the eggs for artificial incuba-
tion. The same pair laid again on the 19th and 22nd February.
Worried about possible repeat abandonment, we removed the clutch
and placed it under a pair of Goldie&apos;s Lorikeets. The Blue-crowned
pair laid again on the 25th and 28th March. This time the female
incubated very well and so we left the eggs with the parents. The
female appears to do most of the incubating but the male was often
in the nest with her. Both birds would come off the nest to feed or
when they were disturbed but the female would go back to incubat-
ing in a short while. The incubation period is twenty-five days,
with an average period of forty-eight hours from pip to hatch. The
first clutch was artificially incubated to the expected due date.
Unfortunately, the first egg did not hatch, and the second pipped
but the chick died. We had better luck with the second clutch. Both
chicks hatched under their foster parents on 15th and 17th March.

We removed both of them on 31st March for hand-rearing, thereby
allowing the Goldie's to foster again and eliminating the possibility
of the Blue-crowned becoming imprinted by the Goldie's. The third
clutch had one egg which did not hatch, but the second egg hatched
successfully on 24th April.
The fostered chicks were aged seventeen and fifteen days when
removed for handfeeding. They rapidly took to handfeeding and
were spoon-fed nectar every three hours from six-thirty in the
morning to six-thirty in the evening. The weight gains were good,
and on day twenty-one the chicks were placed on a four times per
day feeding schedule. On day thirty-two this was reduced to three
times and on day forty-one to twice per day. Solid food in the form
of soft fruits was left in their cage. Lories are quite easy to wean
and these two began feeding themselves on day forty-nine. Fledg-
ing took place at forty days of age.
It is always rewarding when birds reproduce so readily, and even
more so when in your care for so short a time. I look forward to
many more productive seasons and busy antics from these beautiful
birds.

NOTES FROM 1991 ON

Of the 194 species at Rotterdam Zoo in 1991, eggs were pro-
duced by 93 (48%). Eggs of 56 species (60% of the species which
bred) hatched. Chicks were successfully reared from 43 of these
species. Whenever possible, Rotterdam Zoo adheres to a policy of
letting parents attempt to rear their own young and few species
other than those in the family Phasianidae are routinely artificially
incubated and hand-reared.
Eggs were produced by all four species of ratites of which a
female was present, including the Bennett&apos;s Cassowary, Casuarius
bennetti, a rare species in captivity. A female acquired from
Darmstadt Zoo (Germany) in 1990 produced 17 eggs over a period
of 102 days in 1991. Despite the fact that the male and female of
this species were compatible during the breeding season and were
observed copulating, none of the eggs (artificially incubated)
appeared to be fertile and the male showed no interest in nesting
activities. A great deal was learned during 1991 concerning
management and behaviour of this species and expectations for the
future success are high. The male Common Rhea Rhea americana ,
on the other hand, proved to be a good father, and reared nine
young. Interestingly, this male allowed an immature male to
incubate some of the eggs and they sat companionably side by side
during the incubation period. However, once the eggs began to
hatch the older male became aggressive to the younger one which
had to be removed.
The colony of 16 adult Blackfooted Penguins Spheniscusdemer-
sus normally lays a number of eggs each year but usually the eggs
are found broken or the parents abandon the nests of eggs or young
chicks. Two changes were made in 1991. One was intended to deter
the many mooching Grey Herons Ardea cinerea from taking fish
from the mouths of the penguins and the fish are now placed under
a large wire basket in the water. Additionally, a number of nesting
shelters were added to increase nest site possibilities. These
changes may have been responsible for the fact that this year three
different sets of parents managed to &amp;quot;fledge&amp;quot; young in 1991.

The colony of European Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber ro-
seus proved to be quite content in their naturalistic enclosure,
rebuilt in 1990 to mimic a barren mud flat similar to habitats used
by these birds in the wild. Eggs were produced by at least 8 pairs
of the 25 birds and also by two pairs of American Flamingo
Phoenicopterus r. ruber temporarily held in the enclosure until
their new one is ready. A mixed pair of flamingos also produced
an egg which, fortunately did not hatch. In previous years success
in the flamingo colony has been very little because of predation on
chicks from gulls. This year the birds chose to nest within 5 meters
of the public area which not only provided personnel and visitors
with an excellent view of the upbringing of the young, but also
afforded them protection, as the gulls were reluctant to come so
close to the people. All four chicks which hatched in 1991 were
reared successfully.
Twenty two of twenty six species of Galliformes present in the
Zoo in 1991 laid eggs. The pair of Green Junglefowl Gallus varius
definitely attained the status of our most prolific birds. The three
year old female, hatched in the Netherlands, paired to a two year
old male hatched at San Antonio Zoo (USA) and donated to
Rotterdam Zoo by Antwerp Zoo (Belgium) in 1989, produced 88
eggs over the course of eight months. Amazingly, at least 83 of
these eggs were fertile. Such a large sample size of eggs from one
species gave an excellent opportunity to compare the results of the
recently purchased Grumbach incubator with the other, older,
incubators, and it did indeed give better results. The Rotterdam
Zoo participates actively in the continuing reintroduction pro-
gramme organised by the Benelux chapter of the World Pheasant
Association for the Cheer Pheasant Catreus wallichi in Pakistan.
Eggs from Rotterdam Zoo and other institutions in the area are
collected at Rotterdam Zoo and then taken to a disinfection and
packing point before being shipped to Pakistan. Although 68 eggs
were laid by three females at Rotterdam Zoo in 1991, only 26 of
these were laid early enough in the season, before it was too hot, to
be sent to the reintroduction project. This project has been quite
successful in previous years but success in 1991 was limited by
incubator failure in Pakistan.
Four of the five crane species reared young in 1991. Rotterdam
Zoo currently has 19 Red-crowned Cranes, 16 of which are out on
loan to other institutions. One female, at Rotterdam Zoo since 1958
and breeding since 1965, continued to add to the population by
rearing one youngster in 1991 with her present mate. The EEP

Coordinator and Studbook keeper for the Red -crowned Crane is
employed by Rotterdam Zoo and is working on a European
masterplan for this species. He will be attending an international
masterplanning session in 1992 in order to coordinate better the
European management with other regions. Both pairs of Stanley
Cranes Anthropoides paradisea laid eggs, but only one pair
produced fertile eggs. This pair has had a history of abandoning its
nests and until this year has not been successful. True to form, they
did not appear interested in incubating the first clutch of 1991 (the
two eggs were artificially incubated and were successfully hand-
reared). They did lay a second clutch of two eggs, and not only
incubated these well, but proved to be model parents! It was very
rewarding to watch the adults, each with a chick in tow, expertly
guiding them around the enclosure.
Being the institution with the Crowned Pigeon EEP Coordinator
and Studbook keeper, Rotterdam holds all three species in the
Goura group. Eggs were laid by all species (21 in total), but only
one Goura scheepmakeri was reared. This is the most uncommon
of the three crowned pigeons in captivity and only two other
facilities in Europe currently breed this species. The EEP coordi-
nator has been actively working with other coordinators and insti-
tutions to study and resolve the husbandry and hand-rearing prob-
lems almost universally observed with crowned pigeons in captiv-
ity.
Cockatoos at Rotterdam Zoo did well in 1991 and all seven
species that had the possibility to breed did lay eggs. The highlight
of the parrot breeding season was the hatching of a Palm Cockatoo
Probosciger aterrimus. This egg was parent incubated to the
pipping stage at which point the inexperienced parents abandoned
it. The chick successfully hatched, however, and hand-rearing was
attempted. At three weeks of age food digestion problems com-
monly observed in hand-reared chicks of this species began to
occur and the chick died at six weeks of age. Regrettably the
breeding male, which had been at Rotterdam Zoo for almost 30
years and of which the age was unknown, died of hepatitis a few
months later. The female will be able to choose a new mate from
one of several unpaired males.
All six of the owl species that were paired produced eggs in
1991 The European Eagle Owls Bubo b. bubo reared young
successfully for the second year and the Snowy Owls Nyctea
scandiaca , which consistently raise young, reared three chicks.

A pair of Speckled Mousebirds Colius striatus has been breed-
ing regularly since 1990 and reared two young successfully in 1991.
The birds use a nest built against the wire-mesh of the cage in public
view and thus make a very nice display for visitors.

During 1991 29 species were removed from the collection, while
another 21 species were added. New species were primarily
acquired for the new Asian exhibits discussed below.
A female Brown Kiwi Apteryx australis mantelli , which had
been donated by the San Diego Zoo (USA) in 1990, was sent on to
Frankfurt Zoo (Germany) in August to breed hopefully with an
unpaired male there. Unfortunately the male at Rotterdam Zoo died
of complications from swallowing a piece of wire just after the
female&apos;s arrival here. A single female Wattled Crane was donated
to Parc Zoologique de Cleres (France) to be paired with a wild-
caught male there. Six young Amazona leucocephala , thought to
be the nominate species A. /. leucocephala were confiscated by the
Dutch authorities and brought to Rotterdam Zoo. These birds were
subsequently transferred to another institution which is initiating a
breeding programme with these and other confiscated individuals
of this species. An exchange between Vogelpark Walsrode (Ger-
many), holding two female Yellow-tailed Cockatoos Calyptorhyn-
chus funereus funereus and Rotterdam Zoo, holding two males,
resulted in each institution having a male and female. Though the
female at Rotterdam is at least 30 years old we hope that these two
birds will develop a pair-bond and breed successfully. They are
housed, with all the other parrots, in high security aviaries to avoid
theft.
New and Remodelled Facilities
Two large aviaries were opened in May 1991 in the new &amp;quot;Asian&amp;quot;
area of the zoo. Both enclosures are constructed of black nylon
netting purchased from a company that supplies this netting to
commercial fishing companies. The netting, with a mesh size of 6
x 6 cm, is not at all distracting to viewers. Steel beams within the
aviaries support the netting and it is anchored by steel beams and
cables along the periphery. One aviary, approximately 30 x 15 x 8
- 10 m, simulates a wooded marsh habitat, and currently houses a
male and a female Pallas Sea Eagle, Haliaeetus leucoryphus ,
hatched at Zoo Berlin. Efforts are underway to acquire an unrelated

specimen to pair with one of these birds. There is a boardwalk on
both sides of the netting on one long side of the flight-cage, so that
the exhibit can be viewed from either inside or outside the enclo-
sure, dependant on the current requirements of the aviary residents.
The other aviary is about 50 x 30 m in area, with a gracefully
draping double tent-like form which is 25 m tall at the highest
point. This is also a wetland exhibit, with a river which has a large
waterfall at its head meandering through the enclosure. Vegetation
is primarily of grasses, low shrubs and bamboo. This enclosure
houses a variety of Asian wetland birds ranging in size from the
Oriental White Stork Ciconia boyciana to the Baikal Teal Anas
formosa. A 7 x 11 m area, adjacent to the main flight-cage and
almost entirely sheltered on all sides, functions as a smaller holding
aviary and as the &amp;quot;catchingcage&amp;quot;. The birds are regularly fed inthis
area, and can be guided from here into the attached indoor winter
enclosures. The public can observe the feeding birds at close range
through a series of windows without disturbing them.
A semi-circular indoor enclosure 16 m in length was remodelled
to hold one pair of four different parrot species: Palm Cockatoo
Probosciger aterrimus , Blue-eyed Cockatoo Cacatua ophthal-
mic a, Long-billed Corella Cacatua tenuirostris tenuirostris and the

ous climbing structures and opportunities for the birds to chew on
natural materials are available at all heights in the enclosure. The
birds are highly active and exploratory in this situation, providing
an interestingexhibit forthe public. Many variously sized nestboxes
and naturalistic nest tree hollows are available in the enclosure, and
three of the four species have already been observed copulating. It
Remains to be seen whether they will be able to breed successfully
in this experimental mixed exhibit.
Construction work on a new incubator and hand-rearing centre
for the bird collection, in a conveniently located area of the zoo,
began in 1991. New equipment, which should greatly facilitate
incubation and hand-rearing efforts, is being purchased accord-
ingly. Additionally, centralization of a system to control precisely
and monitor humidity and temperature of the various buildings,
incubators and other machines throughout the zoo has also been
initiated. The year 1991 was an exciting one for the bird section of
Rotterdam Zoo. Its success was achieved only with the hard work,
enthusiasm, and vast experience of the personnel working directly
with the birds and with the support of other departments involved
in the functioning of this section.

(Lydd on Sea)
Although more than 400 different waterfowl hybrids have been
listed in scientific publications a large number appear never to have
been described. Since variations are known to occur in hybrids
having the same parent species a single published description of
any one cross cannot be regarded as typical. The recording of
hybrid waterfowl stretches back over 150 years yet there is still not
even a basic inventory listing briefly the salient points of all
recorded hybrids. Such a reference catalogue could assist the
process of identifying hybrid ducks and geese of unknown parent-
age which now occur with increasing frequency in the wild.
Within the sub-family Anatinae hybrids of known parentage
were found by Bonhote (1907) to resemble one or other of the
parent species, resemble another kind of duck or be unlike any
known species.
Hybrids not having exactly the same parent species may resem-
ble one another, superficially, in any of the above three categories.
The following examples, all of male crosses, indicate the identifi-
cation problems posed by hybrids of unknown parentage:-

Both are unlike any known species but may resemble one

Unfortunately, it is still the fashion to record only the parental
names of hybrids without even a few words concerning identifica-
tion or resemblance. One hybrid, recently published as a British
sight record without being classified as probable, would need more
critical examination to be sure of its identity. I believe that all sight
records of unusual hybrids should automatically be designated as
prpbables unless the hybrids are of known parentage, or until such

time as they are found to match others of proven parentage. This
applies to all the hybrids described in this article except, of course,
the Wood Duck x Blue-winged Teal Anas discors. I hope that
owners of waterfowl collections will photograph any hybrids they
rear and report occurrences to others if they are disinclined to
proceed further with a record themselves. There is a great need to
know more about the plumage, resemblance and behaviour of
waterfowl hybrids.
Wood Duck x Blue-winged Teal: one hybrid of known
parentage.
On 12th January 1992, Mr. Bruce Burk of California sent me a
colour slide of this cross which he reared several years ago. A wild
female Wood Duck mated with one of his captive Blue-winged
Teal. The resulting offspring, a male by plumage, is the subject of
this note. When it died Mr. Burk gave the specimen to a taxidermist
friend, a Mr. Trent Meyer, who mounted the bird and has kindly
supplied me with eight colour prints.
The following details are a combination of Mr. Burk&apos;s recollec-
tions, his photograph of the living bird, some details supplied by
Mr. Meyer and my own interpretations from the photographs. All
comparisons are made with adult males of both Wood Duck and
Bruce Burk
Hybrid male Blue-winged Teal x Wood Duck with male Wood Duck

known species of duck. HEAD and NECK: basic colour similar to
that of a Wood Duck displaying purple, green and bronze reflec-
tions but lacking most of that species&apos; pure white head, throat and
foreneck markings. On the head there are faint remnants of a Wood
Duck&apos;s distinctive narrow white lines. A slight mane is obvious in
the living bird but hardly noticeable in the photos of the mounted
specimen. The most outstanding feature of the hybrid is the

interrupted (i.e. a two-part) facial &apos;crescent&apos;. The gap approximates
to that of the height of the bill at its base and is roughly in that
position. This partial crescent appears not to be a carbon copy of
parts of that of the Blue-wing but a combination of some of the
white facial and throat characters of both parents species. The
narrow, slightly curved and wedge-shaped upper section, starting
from the top edges of the base of the culmen, tapers to a point a little
above the orbital ring. This section is pure white whereas the lower
part is more of a whitish smudge well detached from the base of the
lower mandible. UPPER BREAST: this, plus a little of the lower
neck, is chestnut with blackish and lightish freckles. The striking
black and white vertical lines of the Wood Duck, which separate the
breast from the flanks, have been suppressed, though traces of the
black line are visible. FLANKS: pattern recalls that of the Wood
Duck and my informants aptly describe the overall colour as
&amp;quot;washed goldfish&amp;quot;. BELLY: more like that of the Blue-Wing.
UPPERPARTS and WINGS: browner than those of the Wood Duck,
the scapulars being a lighter brown. Primaries are similar to those
of a Blue-wing but the outer webs have areas of olive iridescence
and traces of white edgings. The speculum is described as similar
to the metallic green of the Blue-wing, while the partly visible
upper wing-coverts are an iridescent greyish-blue. The wing is
similar in proportion to that of a Wood Duck, the tips projecting
only a little beyond the base of the tail. TAIL and TAIL-COV-
ERTS: mainly blackish-brown with sides of the tail-coverts more
of a chestnut-brown. The distal end of the long, broad tail tapers
to a point. BARE PARTS: iris and orbital ring brownish not red as
in the Wood Duck. BILL: with some yellowish and white and a
black tip favours the Wood Duck but appears a little longer and
more slender. LEGS and TOES: yellowish.
Wood Duck x Tufted Duck: two hybrids of unknown
parentage
On 10th March, 1990, my son B. L. Gillham and I watched
closely, and photographed, a full-winged male of this cross in a
Sussex wildfowl park. It appeared paired to a pinioned femaleWood
Duck and continually drove away other ducks from her vicinity.
However, the hybrid was not present the following day. All
comparisons are made with adult males of Wood Duck, Tufted
Duck and the Wood Duck - Blue-winged Teal hybrid. SIZE: similar

Hybrid male Tufted Duckx Wood Duck
bird was unlike any known species of duck. Despite a number of
differences it bore a superficial resemblance to the previous hybrid.
HEAD and NECK: similar in colour to that of a Wood Duck with
much purple, and some green, reflections, but devoid of any of the
white head, throat and foreneck markings of that species. From the
rear of the crown down to upper part of neck was a maned crest
which tended to fluff out and curl out a little at the end when the bird
was aggressive. The crest stayed flush and appeared non-existent
when the bird was alert or diving. Then, the head and neck recalled
that of a Tufted Duck. UPPER BREAST: similar to that of the
previous hybrid but with more black bordering the flanks. FLANKS:
sharply demarcated from the sides of the breast and the flank shape
was like that of a Tufted Duck. An even colour similar to a Wood
Duck&apos;s but without any black and white feathering along the top and
rear borders. BELLY: whitish. UPPERPARTS and WINGS: dorsal
area and scapulars blackish with a greenish gloss. Wings browner
and secondaries tipped white. No other white visible when the bird
flapped its wings. Tips of closed wings did not project beyond
upper tail-coverts. TAIL and TAIL-COVERTS: whole stern area
mainly blackish. The long tail, which tapered to a point, was a little
shorter than a Wood Duck&apos;s. BARE PARTS: irides brownish with
a more reddish tinge than those of the previous hybrid. Orbital ring
not noticeable. BILL: shaped like that of a Tufted but with a little
broader black tip than that species; pale pinkish-red at base. Rest

of bill pale bluish grey with a black patch in the middle, neatly
shaped and rather like that of an early 20th century &apos;Kaiser William&apos;
moustache. LEGS and TOES: viewed only through water, appeared
a putty colour. DIVING: the hybrid dived with the skill of a Tufted
rising a little out of the water and taking a header with the tail
slightly spread. On the surface it sat low in the water with the tips
of the tail feathers submerged.
Mr. Klaus Hein, of the Federal Republic of Germany, kindly
sent me four colour negatives of a similar male hybrid taken in
Latvia. Print reproduction is rather garish but, in general, the
plumage patterns and colours resemble those of the Sussex bird.
Bill patterns and colours look similar though the central black
patch cannot be seen well. Only traces of pale pinkish-red are
visible around the base. Maned head, short wings, long tail and
whitish belly are clearly noticeable. The most striking difference
from the Sussex bird is in the wings, one of which is fully extended
in one print. There is a prominent white wing-bar and white trailing
edges to the secondaries. The primaries show whitish inner webs.
On the top edge of the rear flanks there are a few black and white
feathers as in the Wood Duck.
Pochard x Greater Scaup: three hybrids of unknown
parentage
In a paper on Aythya hybrids the late Drs. J. M. and J. G.
Harrison and I (Gillham et al. 1966) demonstrated that the male
offspring from Pochard x Tufted Duck unions can bear a strong
resemblance to either a male Pochard, a male Tufted Duck, or a

and photographed a captive hybrid which could easily be mistaken
for a male Greater Scaup. I later discovered that it had been
purchased as that species though the Bird Keepers were aware of
slight differences. Before describing this hybrid it is necessary to
mention that the Greater Scaup has two distinct types. The darker
race mariloides, with blacker and coarser vermiculations, ranges
from North America to parts of eastern Asia. B.L.G. and I have
seen or photographed both light and dark types in waterfowl and
skin collections and I have observed them in the wild in this
country. It seems that variations exist within the race marila.
Eclipse plumage excepted, all comparisons are made with adult
males of Greater Scaup, Pochard, and Pochard x Tufted Duck
hybrids in full plumage. SIZE: as Scaup but with a head profile
nearer that of a Pochard. HEAD and NECK: blackish-brown with
purple reflections on the head and some greenish on the cheeks. At
a distance these parts looked as black as in any Scaup. BREAST:
black. FLANKS: at a distance as white as in any Scaup but within
a few yards, and beside that species, these body parts had many
widely-spaced faint grey vermiculations. However, these side
panels were whiter than in any live or dead Pochard or Pochard x
Tufted Duck hybrid I have seen. UPPERPARTS: mantle and
scapulars a very light grey vermiculated black: coarsest markings
towards back. Almost indistinguishable from the lightest types of
Scaup which were sometimes seen beside it. Also whiter than in
any Pochard and or Pochard x Tufted hybrids I have seen. WINGS:
when extended a much darker grey than on the mantle or scapulars.
Visible primaries of sound wing when closed were blackish-brown.
A mainly white wedge-shaped wing bar (narrowest towards the
body) spanned the secondaries of the pinioned wing. TAIL and
TAIL-COVERTS: former greyish-brown and the latter black. BARE
PARTS: bill closely resembled that of some Pochard x Tufted
hybrids having the same blackish area at the base and a black tip,
the latter like that of a Tufted male depicted in Gillham (1986) page
139. Basic colour and narrow white band behind black tip appeared
indistinguishable from nearby Scaup. Hides: reddish orange simi-
lar to most Pochard x Tufted hybrids I have seen and readily
recognised from the Scaup, all of which had yellow eyes. ECLIPSE:
indistinguishable from male Pochard x Tufted hybrids in similar

proved more of a problem. With hindsight I should have identified
the bird as a cross when photographing it in a Sussex wildfowl park

in the winter of 1983 - 84. At the time I was intent on taking photos
of two captive adult male Redheads. The full-winged hybrid was
then regarded as a sub-adult Redhead because of its different head-
shape, certain plumage features and bill colour. Nevertheless, it
should have been recognised as a hybrid by its eye colour. It was
not until seven years later that the identity of this hybrid was
established. To ensure that it was not a sub-adult or variant
Redhead I sent colour prints to several American ornithologists all
of whom stated that it was not that species. A majority opinion
favoured a hybrid involving a Scaup as one parent.

The following plumage comparisons are made with adult males
of Pochard, Redhead, Pochard x Tufted crosses and the previous
Pochard x Scaup hybrid. SIZE: as the Redheads which were
sometimes seen beside it but with a wedge-shaped head profile.
The latter was not regarded as an adult character as I have photos
of sub-adult Lesser Scaup and Tufted Duck with similar head-
shapes. HEAD and NECK: close to those of Pochard and Redhead
but darker due to blackish feathering over the head. BREAST:
black. UPPERPARTS: coarse vermiculations similar but plumage
a darker grey than that of the first Pochard x Scaup hybrid but with
a small amount of faint brown markings. Not strikingly different
from the Redheads seen at the same time. FLANKS: similar to the
other Pochard x Scaup hybrid but with a few more greyish
vermiculations just above the waterline and bordering the sides of
the tail-coverts (underparts below the waterline not seen). WINGS:
only the ends of the closed wings observed. These were blackish-
brown. TAIL and TAIL-COVERTS: former brownish-grey and all
visible coverts black. The whole stern area was darker than in
comparable photos of Redheads. BARE PARTS: irides reddish.
BILL: colour similar to that of many Pochard and some Pochard x

Tufted hybrids. The dull blackish close to the base extended nearly
one-third of the way to the tip down either side while the grey on
the culmen reached almost to the forehead. The tip was a deeper
black curving up along the sides. One of the Redheads had a dusky
base to its bill.
In 1991 I was able to examine, and take details of this cross in
the British Museum (Natural History) at Tring. This specimen is
the one recorded and figured in Yarrell (1843) where, on page 247,
it is provisionally named as the American Scaup Fuligula mar-
iloides. It was later identified as a Pochard x Scaup hybrid and is
recorded as such in Rothschild and Kinnear (1929). B. L. Gillham
took a series of colour photographs of the bird which afforded
comparison with my Redhead-like cross and Pochard x Tufted
hybrids. My bird, and the British Museum&apos;s specimen, have strong
similarities. The latter, however, is clearly sub-adult with prolific
brownish and whitish markings below the waterline and similar
feathering forming two separate patches &apos;eating&apos; into the lower
edge of the black breast. Otherwise, the rest of the plumage closely
matches my hybrid. Identical belly and lower breast markings
occur in many sub-adult Scaup until at least late April. In spring
swimming birds often appear to be in full plumage but on coming
ashore their underparts below the waterline indicate they are not
yet fully mature.

In ''News and View&amp;quot; (Vol.98, p. 140) you reproduced my letter
concerning Steve Horne&apos;s breeding success with Buffon&apos;s Touraco.
My letter was written somewhat hastily and not with publication in
mind. I would not wish Mr. Horne to feel that I was questioning his.
description of the nominate form having its crest tinted pink at the
tip. The reason I could not recall seeing pink in this touraco&apos;s crest
is, belatedly, very obvious to me; the birds I remember at London
Zoo were, of course, like his, T. p . buffoni, which lacks the pink.
At London Zoo it was called the Senegal Touraco, and tends now
most commonly to be known, appropriately enough, as the Green-
crested Touraco.
Frangoise Raison is to be congratulated on the breeding of the
Purple-crested Touraco ( Avicultural Magazine Vol.98, pp. Ill -
114). Placing it with the Musophaga species, rather than in the
genus Tauraco, presumably, is part of a recent and possibly contro-
versial new classification. This species was in the past of course
in the genus Gallirex. Colour illustrations of Frangoise Raison&apos;s
two forms of the Purple-crested Touraco can be seen in Roberts&apos;
Birds of South Africa (PI.22). Although closely associated with
Mozambique and especially South Africa, this species has quite an
extensive range to the north, e.g. the race chlorochlamys has,
according to Birds of East Africa (EANHS, 1980), been recorded
once in south-western Uganda, and is locally common in south-
eastern Kenya. It occurred formerly in the Mombasa hinterland and
along the Voi River, but in recent years its former habitat there has
been drastically modified. The Purple-crested species is also
locally common in Tanzania. Th t Avicultural Magazine, 1974, 80,
6:217 - 219, had an account of possibly the very first aviary
breeding, at Steilenbosch, South Africa.
Ross&apos;s Touraco Musophaga rossae, found from the Cameroons,
eastwards to Sudan and southwards to Angola and northern Bot-
swana, where it has been recorded as a vagrant, was bred first by
Newton Steel ( Avicultural Magazine , 1973,79,1: 30 - 34). The
Violaceous Touraco M. violacea, of West Africa, has in recent
years bred here in Britain on several occasions, but there appears
to have been no first breeding claim.

Parrots, by David Alderton. Published by Whitter Books Ltd.,
London. 1992. price #8.95
Written by David Alderton, an aviculturist and professional
writer on natural history subjects, this book is a &apos;'must&amp;quot; for every
student of aviculture, whether he or she is a private individual
enjoying a fascinating pastime or someone who intends to make the
care and management of birds a career. So much knowledge
regarding parrots, their origins, their physical make-up, their hab-
its and food and their character is crammed into this book of 119
pages that one marvels at its compactness. Here is where the
experienced professional writer shows through admirably. There is
no meandering &amp;quot;hot air&amp;quot;, just extremely interesting assimilable
facts. An adequate index is included, a great boon to busy people.
There are really excellent colour photos and a great number of
charmingly executed black and white drawings by John Cox in the
style of wood cuts or wood engravings. Also included is a useful
map showing the distributions of parrots throughout the world. The
chapter on people and parrots recounts in fascinating detail the
human race's love affair with parrots, starting with the writings of
a naturalist in the 5th century BC. There are details too of parrots
being used as items of trade in the armies of Alexander the Great
when he marched into what is now known as India in 327 BC. The
Romans were fond of keeping Ringneck Parrots from the Far East
as pets and, in the 15th century, Columbus introduced Macaws from
South America to Europe and brought a pair of Cuban Amazons to
Spain for his patron Queen Isabella. The history of the association
of Parrots with people traced by David Alderton through the ages
makes compelling reading. By stages he brings the reader through
to modern times and goes on to set out in detail the current situation
regarding some of the most sought after members of the parrot
family of birds. In this important chapter David writes of the
development of &amp;quot;ranching&amp;quot; schemes for some of the prospectively
endangered members of the parrot family. He shows how such a
method for the preservation of a particular species is already
working successfully with the Mataco Indians of Argentina, to the
benefit of the Indians, the forests in which they live, to avicultur-
ists throughout the world and to the preservation of the species in
it&apos;s natural surroundings. New Zealand has perhaps led the way
with it&apos;s management of the once scarce Red Fronted Kakariki
Cyanoramphus novaezealandiae. The Government permitted avi-

culturists to keep some of these parrakeets and, as a result of their
successful breeding programmes, they multiplied and many were
successfully reintroduced to their native habitat. David describes
other successes with both captive breeding and protection of the
environment where potentially endangered parrots live. It is to be
hoped that many more schemes for increasing the dwindling
populations of certain members of the parrot family will be inau-
gurated by enlightened Governments, prodded and encouraged by
farsighted groups ofpeople, often working under great difficulties.
This excellent book with it's attractive hard cover is outstanding
value. .

SEED-EATING BIRDS -Their Care and Breeding by Jeffrey
Trollope. Published by Blandford, London. 1992 Price #13.99.
I first made the acquaintance of Jeffrey Trollope's The Care and
breeding of SEED-EATING BIRDS shortly after it appeared on the
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.998547958333333" page_id="56294123"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
market in 1983. My immediate impression was that here was a book
that would be a valuable addition to the library of anyone interested
in the care, management and breeding of a wide variety of mainly,
but not exclusively, exotic seedeaters. Over the years I have had
no cause to revise that opinion, for the book is clearly written by
someone who knows his subject extremely well and the text is
solidly based on considerable knowledge gleaned from years of
practical experience, a welcome change from the waffle foisted on
newcomers to aviculture by some authors. Now, though, I am
baffled by the appearance of SEED-EATING BIRDS Their Care and
Breeding (first published in the UK in 1992, say the publishers)
which is clearly a revised edition of the 1983 work. I raise what
may appear a fairly trivial point only to question the publisher's
motives, for it would be easy enough for someone on the lookout for
such a book, especially if buying by mail order, to duplicate much
of the valuable information contained in the first edition and which
may already be in their library. In fairness, there is a great deal of
new information within the revised version's 336 pages, but why
turn the original title on its head and imply that this is a first
publication?
It is likely that many aviculturists will find common ground with
the views expressed by the author in his foreword, about the
increasingly important need to conserve many species through
captive breeding. He points out that while many of the birds dealt

with in the book are not listed in Appendix 1 of the Convention of
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITES) and are under no threat currently (the italics are mine)
'they are at risk from the agricultural protection needs in their
countries of origin.' He reminds us that pesticides used to protect
some crops are likely to become an increasing hazard to birds in
many countries and points out that in addition to the destructive
impact of pesticides, many bird species are regarded as serious
agricultural pests, both in their countries of origin and where they
have been introduced. Some of these pest species are listed under
the taxonomic groups: Mannikins and Munias Lonchura, Sparrows
Passer , Finches Fringillidae , Weavers Ploceus , Euplectes and
Streptopelia. The Red-billed Quelea Quelea quelea is identified
as 'probably the world's most numerous species of bird.' It is also
the most serious agricultural pest with 'the estimated average
annual adult breeding populations in African regions range from 19
million for Kenya to 94 million for the Lake Chad Basin.' Fire
bombs and explosives, aerial chemical spraying, and spraying from
the ground are the main methods of destruction and the author
confirms that they are very effective, with an estimated 120 million
Red-billed Queleas killed in Zimbabwe alone in 1985, a figure
assumed to be half the total population at the time. Other species
suffer as a result of these assaults and in one operation, the author
tells us, '43 non-target species, ranging from Waxbills to Gos-
hawks, were found dead after one spraying of a Quelea colony.'
In the book, captive breeding is defined as successful if one or
both parents complete the full breeding cycle, from egg-laying to
rearing the young to independence. The author takes the view that
while artificial incubation and rearing methods may be necessary
to prevent wastage of bird life and to retain the viability of captive
stocks of rare birds, he believes that these methods (especially
artificial incubation) can be good servants and bad masters. There
are views with which I heartily concur. There are references to
around 400 birds, some, admittedly, are attributable to synonyms
but that enhances rather than detracts from a comprehensive and
valuable revision. As one would expect, most, if not all, of the most
popular and widely kept Passerine seedeaters are included and
there is a good deal of first-hand information about many of them.

a good deal of original material about some of these species is
included in the book.
Some welcome additional material has been added to what has
always been a useful chapter dealing with some of the smaller and
more interesting Doves and Pigeons which either were, or may still
be, imported into Britain. Hemipodes retain a chapter to them-
selves but it is shorter and in this edition the Yellow-legged Turnix
tanki has been consigned surprisingly, to limbo since references to
the Andalusian T. sylvatica remain and I would have thought that
if Hemipodes were to reappear in UK aviculture, tanki might be a
more likely import than sylvatica.
A good deal of additional information has also been injected
into chapters making up the first part of this two-part work, and the
section headed Sickness and Health has been considerably ex-
panded. If you keep seedeating species and don't have a copy of the
first edition, beg, borrow or, preferably buy a copy of this invalu-
able book. I am lucky enough to have both and refer to them
frequently.

Earlier this year, two captive-bred California Condors Gymno-
gyps californianus were released in Ventura County, California,
just five years after the remaining wild birds were captured in an
effort to save the species from extinction. There are now 50 birds
in captivity at the San Diego and Los Angeles zoos.
Juvenile White-tailed Sea Eagles Haliaeetus albicilla , captive-
bred in Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands, have been sent
to Fota Island Wildlife Park in County Cork. They are scheduled
for release at selected sites in counties Kerry and Clare in the next
12 months.
Discovered in 1988 in the grounds of a Somali hospital (from
which it takes its English name), a single example of the Bulo Burti
Boubou Lanarius liberatus has been released in to Somalia&apos;s
Balcad Nature Reserve after spending some months in captivity in
Somalia and Germany.
Scientists from the Tibet Plateau Institute of Biology and Inter-
national Crane Foundation last year discovered nearly 3,000 Black-
necked Cranes Grus nigricollis wintering in south-central Tibet.
The find more than doubled the previously known world population
to 3,900. Now the Lhasa Municipal Government has announced

Following the extermination by rats of the Campbell Island Teal
Anas aucklandica nesiotis on Campbell Island off the coast of New
Zealand, the remaining population of this smaller and flightless
subspecies of the New Zealand Teal now survives only on Dent
Island. With prospects for the subspecies' survival clearly uncer-
tain, a decision was made some years ago to establish a captive
population. In the mid-1980s, three drakes and one duck were
captured - but compatibility between the female and her intended
mates proved elusive. More recently, in 1990, seven more were
captured - including what appeared to be two established pairs. All
the birds are now at New Zealand&apos;s National Wildlife Centre where
it is hoped they will breed.

required owners of &apos;preserved and protected species&apos; of wildlife or
carcasses to register them with the Forestry Department within 90
days from 29th February 1992. The Forestry Department subse-

during the summer of 1992. The adults were acquired in 1990 and
housed in a 30 ft. x 10 ft. planted aviary with a shelter at the rear.
They were fed on skinned day-old chicks. In early spring, 1992
they were observed taking sticks into the shelter and making
ineffectual attempts to build a nest by balancing the sticks on a
perch. A wire frame was fixed to the perch and further sticks were
supplied with which the pair subsequently constructed a flimsy
nest. The cock brooded the empty nest for several days and on 23rd
April the first egg was laid. Unfortunately a White-tailed Jay
Cyanocorax mystacalis in the same aviary pecked a hole in it
before it could be removed. The Jay was immediately transferred
to other accommodation and the hen Ibis laid second and third eggs
on alternate days. They were placed under a bantam but proved
infertile. The adult Ibis continued to add to the nest and two weeks
later the hen had laid a further clutch of three eggs. They were
transferred to a broody bantam and all proved fertile, hatching on
28th May. The chicks were similar in appearance to Sacred Ibis
Threskiornis aethiopicus , covered in black down but with a shorter
beak. Two were reared on finely chopped day-old chicks which had
been skinned and had the yolk sacs removed, with SA37 added as
a vitamin supplement, The third chick never really thrived and died
after seven days. Subsequently, the parents started nesting again,
this time in a tree, but they were not very proficient nest-builders
and had difficulty getting the foundations to remain in place on the
chosen branch. After several attempts they were finally successful.
Another flimsy nest was built and three eggs laid. Rod Rayment,
Director of Stagsden Bird Gardens decided to give the birds the
opportunity to hatch this clutch themselves. He explained: &amp;quot;They
sat very tight and became rather aggressive if anyone tried to
examine the eggs. Unfortunately, both birds attempted to incubate
at the same time and, because of the flimsy nature of the nest, the
eggs began to get pushed out and two were broken. We salvaged
the remaining one and transferred it to a Reliable incubator where
it hatched. This chick was also reared.&amp;quot; The breeding pair laid a
fourth clutch, but once again the nest proved inadequate and the
birds broke one of the three eggs. The remaining two were
incubated, one eventually proving infertile while the other hatched
and a further chick was reared successfully. Although the Hadada
Ibis is fairly well distributed across Africa, Rod Rayment says there
appear to be no records of its being kept previously in Britain and
he believes that this may be a first UK breeding.

American member of the Emberizinae , which is probably closely
related to the Slender-billed Finch, Xenospingus, and the Inca
Finches, Incapiza. They have been available in the U.K. on a few
occasions in recent years but there appears to be nothing published
on their breeding or behaviour.
They are robust-looking birds, approximately 165 mm (6.5 in)
long, with large bright yellow bills. The sexes are alike, except that
females appear to be slightly smaller than males, and their bills are
a paler yellow. The irides are dark brown, with narrow bands of
white above and below the eye and the lores are black. The upper-
parts are grey to dark grey, with darker streaks on the secondaries
and primaries. The throat is dull white, the underparts are pale
grey, shading to white on the belly, and the legs and feet are yellow.
Their distribution is coastal north-west Peru, from Tumbes
south to La Libertad. They are common on open desert-like plains,
with scattered shrubs and low trees. Ridgeley and Tudor (1989)
record that they are conspicuous birds which often perch on the
ground in the open and at road sides. Usually single birds or pairs
are seen and sometimes small loose groups.
Two Cinereous Finches were purchased from a bird keeper in
1991. They proved to be a true pair as the vendor thought they were.
After being housed in a bird room during the winter of 1991-92,
they were released into an outside aviary 3.1 x 1.1 x 2.4 m high (10
x 3Vi x 8 ft.) on 18th March 1992. They shared the aviary with a pair
of Cape Doves Oena capensis and a pair of Spice Birds Lonchura
punctulata. The basic diet was mixed millets, canary mixture,
small sunflower, greenfood, mealworms and commercial softfood.
The aviary was furnished with cut conifer branches at various

heights. Domed baskets, half-open fronted boxes, cup shaped
baskets and platforms of various sizes were provided as nesting
receptacles. Nesting material consisted of dried grasses, coconut
fibres, feathers, twigs and moss.
On 21st March the birds were seen looking into a half-open
fronted nest box and the female was carrying coconut fibres. Both
birds became very vocal giving a contact call, Tuk Tuk', and
sparrow-like chatterings. The male was occasionally seen to chase
the female and the Spice Birds and fly near the Cape Doves, causing
tiem to lift one wing in a defence posture. On 19th May 1992 the
female was sitting in the nest box which was about 1.8 m (6 ft.) from
the aviary floor. A neat cup-shaped nest of coconut fibres had been
built in the box and on 21st May 1992 the first of three eggs were
laid. These were pale greyish-green, blotched and spotted with
pale reddish-brown. Two of the eggs measured 25 x 17 mm and 24
x 16 mm.
Incubation commenced on 23rd May 1992 and from this date the
birds&apos; diet was supplemented with wax-moth larvae, house crickets
and invertebrates collected from nettle beds and bushes. Incuba-
tion was carried out by the female which was a nervous sitter,
leaving the nest when I approached the aviary. Two chicks hatched
on 5th June 1992. They showed a pinkish-red gape, with dull white
gape flanges and they had sparse greyish down. The female
brooded the young for the first few days after hatching, but she was
off the nest for periods of up to 40 minutes. Both parents fed the
chicks on wax-moth larvae, house crickets, collected livefood and
possibly regurgitated seed. The male bird fed the chicks when the
female was off the nest. On 8th June 1992 the male began to attack
the Cape Doves and Spice Birds which I immediately removed from
the aviary. One of the doves was so seriously injured that it died
later on the same day. On 16th June 1992 it appeared that both
parents were feeding seed to the chicks. One chick left the nest on
17th June and a second on 18th June, leaving one infertile egg in the
nest. The chicks tails and primary feathers were not developed.
Their upperparts were grey and the underparts were light grey
shading to whitish on the lower abdomen. They managed to fly
from perch to perch for small distances but their movements were
uncoordinated.
An egg was laid in the same nest on 24th June 1992, a second on
25th June and a third on 26th June when incubation apparently
commenced. The chicks of the first brood had their complete
plumage development by the 26th June 1992 and they were feeding

themselves although they still solicited food from their parents. On
8th July 1992 two chicks of the second clutch hatched and the
chicks of the first brood were removed from the aviary. The pattern
of development for the second brood was similar to that of the first,
with an incubation period of 13 - 14 days. They left the nest at 13
days from hatching and were independent of their parents at 26
days.

Cinereous Finches
The first egg of the third clutch was laid in the same nest on 5th
August 1992 and a second on 6th August when incubation com-
menced. Two chicks hatched after an incubation period of 13 days
although they did not leave the nest until they were 18 days old
when the chicks of the second brood were removed from the aviary.
The two chicks of the third brood became independent of their
parents at 30 days and were removed from the aviary. A synopsis
of the breeding results for 1992 is given below.

<bodyText confidence="0.999262083333334" page_id="56294143"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
Cinereous Finches are active, fast flying birds, which flirt their
wings and tails as they alight on a perch. Large food items, such
as adult house crickets and moths, are held with one foot on a perch
and dismembered. Sometimes the items are held in the foot and
lifted to the bill. Clumps of nesting material, such as coconut fibre,
are also anchored on a perch with one foot and individual fibres are
pulled out. With regard to the aggressive behaviour of P. cinerea ,
the many variables, such as the size of the aviary and cover
provided can be crucial, as well as the plumage colours and
taxonomic relationship of the birds housed together. It appears that
the New World Emberizidae (especially the Central and South
American species) vary in behaviour from being good mixers to
murderous when breeding. Of the five New World species which
I have bred, the Collared Warbling Finch, Poospiza hispaniolensis
was the least aggressive when breeding, even when housed with
waxbills. However, Boosey (1962) found that the male of a
breeding pair of Pretty Warbling Finches, P. ornata , attacked and
killed the hen. In Sweden, a breeding pair of P. ornata attacked
and injured unrelated birds in the same aviary (Zackrisson, 1972).
The Rufous-collared Sparrow Zonotrichia capensis was found by
Murray (1966) to be very aggressive when breeding, attacking and
killing other birds, although housed in a very large aviary. In view
of these behavioural uncertainties I recommend that breeding pairs
of P. cinerea should be housed on their own.

BREEDING THE RED-BELLIED PARROT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989240256410256" page_id="56294144"  page_num="61" year="" vol="">
By Rosemary Low (Palmitos Park, Gran Canaria).
In the June 1931 issue of the Avicultural Magazine there
appeared a beautiful coloured plate by Roland Green which de-
picted the Red-bellied Parrot Poicephalus rufiventris (therein
called the Red-breasted Parrot). David Seth-Smith had written a
single paragraph to accompany this plate, as the species was almost
unknown in aviculture. He aptly described it as &amp;quot;one of the most
beautiful of a very charming group of small Parrots&amp;quot;. However, it
was to be another 50 years before the Red-bellied Parrot was
available to aviculturists. Now it is being bred in a few collections.
This short-tailed parrot, of the same proportions as the Senegal
P. senegalensis measures 9 in. (23 cm). The colour scheme of the
male is unlike that of any other parrot. The colours are subtle and
not easy to describe accurately. Upperparts are greyish-green, each
feather margined with grey; head and upper breast are grey, strongly
tinged with orange or brown; the breast is orange, the thighs green
and orange and under the tail coverts green tinged with blue. The
female lacks the orange; her underparts are the same shade as the
head. In both sexes the beak and the skin surrounding the eye are
black, providing a strong contrast with the bright red eye.
This parrot can be recommended on many counts. The male is
most attractively coloured, they are small, not noisy, sexually
dimorphic, free-breeding and do not require spacious accommoda-
tion. The young can even be sexed in nest feather.
The Red-bellied Parrot comes from the central eastern part of
Africa which sticks out like a thumb, i.e., Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya
and just across the border into Northern Tanzania. Not a lot is
known about its status. There is no evidence that it is declining.
However, when the importation commences of a species which was
previously virtually unknown in aviculture, it is often due to human
disturbance. This is a species of open bushland and woodland, and
open grassland habitats. It may be found in acacia scrublands
where there are baobab trees, In the lowlands it is widespread and
fairly common.
In the breeding centre at Palmitos Park, Gran Canaria, there is
one pair. They used to be on exhibit in the park. The male escaped
and spent some months at liberty before being recaptured. The pair
was then placed in a suspended cage, measuring just over 6 ft (2 m)
long.

In 1991 the female laid three eggs (the normal clutch size for this
species) on 23rd, 26th and 28th February. Incubation appears to be
carried out by the female only although one breeder reported that
the male shared incubation. Our female tends to leave the nest and
sit innocently in the cage whenever anyone is in the vicinity which
could result in a slightly longer than normal incubation period. In
other Poicephalus of this size the incubation period is about 27
days. In this pair there have been two instances in which the female
has laid three eggs and all three have hatched. In each case the
period for the third egg was 27 days. However, for the first egg the
period was 31 and probably 30 days. In this first clutch the first two
eggs hatched on the same day, after 31 and 28 days, thus indicating
that incubation did not commence until the second egg was laid. In
the second nest the first two eggs hatched on consecutive days, after
30 and probably 29 days. In their most recent nest, one egg
disappeared and the other two probably both hatched after 30 days,
or perhaps after 30 and 26 days.
The youngest chick in the first nest died at 31 days, almost
certainly due to candidiasis. The eldest left the nest for the first
time (returning later in the day) on 2nd June aged 68 days. The
second youngster left the nest about six days later. At about the
same time the female laid again - either only two eggs or one was
broken, perhaps by one of the young birds. One egg was damaged;
the other was transferred to the nest of a pair of Jardine&apos;s Parrots P.
gulielmi where it hatched on 1st July. This chick was hand-reared
from the age of three days together with a Jardine&apos;s, because they
were not well fed.
Both were reared on the usual diet (Milupa cereal, wheat germ
cereal, and smaller quantities of papaya, Nekton-Lori and our own
rearing food). The Red-bellied reached its peak weight of 156 g in
22 - 29 August, then gradually dropped to 136 g by 4th October
when it was spoon fed for the last time. On that day it went on
exhibit in the park, thus it was 96 days old before it was weaned.
Most breeders wean small Poicephalus Parrots at about ten weeks
- but I always prefer a very gradual weaning process. In 1992 the
female laid the first of three eggs on 8th or 9th January and the third
on the 15th. The first pipped on 6th February and hatched on the
8th. The young were parent-reared and left the nest aged 73, 76 and
77 days (21st, 25th and 28th April).
This was the first nest in which young of both sexes were
present, making plumage comparison possible. The breast colour
of the two females was a very soft orange, that of the male being

nearly as bright orange as an adult. Young of both sexes have
orange under wing coverts. One breeder of this species, G, H.
Amos, noted that young can be sexed as soon as the breast feathers
appear, even when still enclosed in their sheath (Amos, 1992).
Some young have orange on the forehead before the first moult;
for example, in the three young mentioned, one female had pale
orange, the male had brighter orange and the other female had none.
The iris is dark brown and the skin surrounding the eye is grey.
Females lose the orange breast at the first moult; never again are
they quite so pretty. With their dark eyes and soft colours, young
Red-bellied Parrots are indeed very appealing.
To date, all our young ones have gone on exhibit in the park. The
hand-reared male is an attention-seeker, hanging on the front of the
aviary and conversing with visitors. One hand-reared youngster in
the group is an asset, as he has encouraged some of the others to be
almost equally friendly. I have noticed that these little parrots have
great appeal for children.

Two parent-reared Red-bellied Parrots aged 42 days at Palmitos Park .
The chicks of this species are typical of all Poicephalus , that is,
covered with quite a dense white down on hatching. By the age of
two weeks they have lost much of this down. At three weeks the
second down (white) is starting to grow and by four weeks they are
covered in thick, short white down with the contour feathers just
starting to show through. At seven weeks they are fully feathered
but the tails are not full length, and are exceptionally pretty. By
then they have reached or exceeded adult weight, and males are
significantly heavier than females. At this age, in the only nest in
which three were reared, the male weighed 155 g and the females

both weighed 130 g.
Chicks are ringed at about 18 days with closed rings of 6.5 mm
internal diameter. I always inspect and weigh the chicks daily. Of
the two most recent chicks, which hatched in October 1992, one
gave cause for concern at an early age; its growth was slow; I
guessed that it had candidiasis and gave it Nystatin (Nystan,
Squibb). Later that day I decided to remove both chicks to hand-
rear the next day. On the following morning when I went to remove
them I found that the ailing chick had been buried up to its neck in
nest litter; the healthy chick had not been buried! The parents
apparently knew that this chick was going to die - or rather, it would
have done without my intervention.
A Gramm stain made from its faeces showed that it had candidiasis
and excessive gram negative bacteria. It was treated with Nystatin,
and with Baytril (Bayer) both orally, and slowly recovered over a
period of two weeks.

Male (left) and female parent-reared Red-bellied Parrots aged 112 and 114 days.
To summarise the results of the one pair, in a period of 19
months, the female laid 11 eggs, all fertile; nine hatched in the nest
and two eggs disappeared. Five young were parent-reared, three
were hand-reared and one died. One clutch was laid in January, one
in February one in June and one in September. Incubation period
for the third (last) egg is 27 days.
The diet of our pair consists of about 50% fresh fruits and
vegetables and 50% various seeds and cooked maize. Their favour-
ite foods are fresh corn, raw carrot (carrots cut into halves) and the
soft fruits of prickly pear cactus and guavas. When rearing young
they have unlimited fresh corn and carrot and extra greeenfood.
Very little indeed has been recorded about this species in

SOCIAL MEETING AT PENSCYNOR WILDLIFE
PARK

On Sunday 6th September 1992, approximately 40 members and
their guests travelled to Penscynor Wildlife Park. The owners, Mr.
and Mrs. Idris Hale, had invited the Society and this was the first
time that a meeting had been arranged in Wales. Most members
travelled a long distance but there was little local support - perhaps
because membership in South Wales is poor. The weather was wet
and dismal and the enclosures, aviaries and the grounds were not
seen at their best. Some of the birds on show were East African
Crowned Cranes, Blue-and-gold Macaws, various Amazons Lories
and Lorikeets, several of which have bred during the year. The
tropical house contained only a few birds among which were a
magnificent pair of Violaceous Touracos. The Lories and Lorikeets
included Stellas, Duivenbode's, Huskies, Blue-streaked and oth-
ers.
After lunch Idris Hale welcomed the Society and entertained us
with an interesting talk and film show about the Park. He then
kindly donated a cheque for #100.00 to the Society's funds, for
which we are all most grateful.

We are very grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Hale for their generous gift
to the funds of the Society and for their kind hospitality to the
members who attended the meeting at Penscynor. In spite of the
weather the event was a great success and was enjoyed immensely.
Our thanks are due to Idris Hale for his interesting talk and film
show and to the members of his staff for the enthusiastic and
interesting way in which they conducted us around the gardens.

BREEDING AFRICAN SPOONBILLS AT
BIRDWORLD BIRD PARK

By Roger G. Sweeney (Luzon)
The sub-family Plataleinae (Spoonbills) is made up of two
genera, the American Genus oiAjaia of which the Roseate Spoon-
bill Ajaia ajaja is the sole representative and the second, better
known, genus of Platalea containing five species which are spread
widely across four continents.
The African Spoonbill Platalea alba is one of the best known
species of the second genus. It breeds within a range from Gambia
to Sudan and Cape province. It is completely white. It differs from
its close relative, the European Spoonbill Platalea leucordia, by
having much of the facial skin exposed. This area of skin and the
legs are bright red. In contrast P. leucorodia has the face covered
by white feathers and its legs are grey.
Adult pair of African Spoonbills
Both the African Spoonbill and the European are kept and have
been bred at Birdworld Bird Park Farnham. The African species has
provided the more successful breeding project during the last five
years, possibly as a result of a joint initiative undertaken by
Birdworld with Bristol Zoo.
For several years before 1986 Birdworld kept small groups of
both the African Spoonbill and also, separately, the European
Spoonbill. Some reproductive activity took place with both species

and indeed the European Spoonbills bred first in 1984. However,
as the two species had to be housed separately to prevent cross
breeding and because their group sizes were small (five or less
adults) reproductive behaviour was limited. In 1986 Bristol Zoo,
which also maintained a small group of African Spoonbills, offered
to send their birds on breeding loan to Birdworld to give us a viable
population often adult birds with an even sex ratio (5.5). This offer
was readily accepted.
The group of African Spoonbills is housed in Birdworld&apos;s Sea-
shore Walk Exhibit, an aviary which is among the largest in the
U.K. The exhibit also houses Oystercatchers Haematophus
ostralegus, Shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis , Kittiwakes Rissa
tridactyla , Razorbills Alcatorda and several other species. Two
main dishes of food are placed in the aviary every morning and a
second feed is given in the afternoon during summer months when
several species within the aviary are breeding. The food on which
Spoonbills feed contains fish, in the form of sprats and sand eels,
ripped up day old chicks, soaked S.D.S. Zoo A pellets and minced
meat. Because of the large amount of fish that is usually consumed
by the Spoonbills in preference to other food items, the fish have
broken pieces of S.D.S. Fisheater tablets (used for highly piscivorous
species of animals) placed inside them daily. There is a lockable
shelter in the back top corner of the aviary although the birds are
rarely shut away at night except in poor weather conditions. Adult
birds, once established, are extremely hardy although young fledg-
ing birds have to be watched in their first winter as they are
susceptible to frost in cold weather conditions.
When I was appointed Livestock Manager at Birdworld in
February 1989 the birds were already starting to nest. However,
they can start nesting at almost any time of the year and proven
pairs of birds can be highly productive.
Nest platforms are provided now which are about 70 cm 2 with
an edging lip about 25 cm high. When I first arrived in 1989 the
birds were nesting in wicker baskets which were satisfactory but
did not last long because they quickly became sodden and unsafe.
The first wooden platforms with which we experimented were of
the same size as those used now, but they had smaller edging lips
(only about 10 cm). These were readily used by the birds but they
were unsafe because of the length of the twigs used by the birds to
line their nests. The nesting platforms used now are ideal with the
height of edging lip allowing the adults to line their nests thickly
enough to prevent young chicks falling out. The nesting platforms

are placed high up towards the back of the aviary and are secured
against the aviaries' support beams. The liberal supply of small
twigs placed in the aviary is used readily by the birds for nest
building. Pairs seem to have strong bonds and remain together for
several seasons although when not breeding they act communally
as a group.
When I first started working with these birds I was told that
previous attempts to persuade the birds to rear their own chicks had
failed. The aviary inmates were highly competitive during the
summer months with other species trying to rear young and, on at
least two occasions, spoonbill chicks had died from stomach
compaction early in their development. Because of these previous
experiences, all the eggs were being removed for artificial incuba-
tion and hand rearing.
Successful artificial incubation of the eggs of P. alba is not
difficult. The incubation period is 24 days. The target of weight
loss between the fresh laid weight of the egg and the weight at time
of internal pip is around 15%. The temperature of the incubators
is maintained at 37.5 degrees Celsius throughout the incubation
period without variation. Achieving a reasonable rate of weight
loss from the egg proved to be difficult. Eggs that were worked
with at Birdworld at first seemed unable to lose sufficient weight.
Once we had established a routine of gently removing the cuticle
from the exterior of the egg during sterilising before the com-
mencement of incubation we found it easy to control their weight
loss (Harvey 1990). The other main factor for the successful
incubation of this species lies in a more detailed and specific
method of turning the egg during its incubation period. Because of
the shape of the egg and the much smaller proportionate size of yolk
to albumen of P. alba than in other birds , turning becomes of great
importance if the egg is to hatch successfully. A full report on this
subject is beingprepared for publication . If the method is followed
successful hatching of strong chicks should be achieved.
The chicks were hand-reared. On removal from the hatcher they
were housed in a brooder for approximately the first week of their
lives and were housed subsequently in an open container with a heat
bulb over one of its endslt was maintained at a temperature of36 0
Celsius which was reduced by one degree daily. Inside the larger
container the chicks were sufficiently mobile to regulate their body
temperature. The floor of the container was covered by paper
towelling, preferably, or by wood shavings.
The diet used to rear the chicks was based at first on liquidised

sprat with vitamin/mineral supplements. As the chicks developed
they were given diced items of the adult diet such as Sand Eels and
segments of chick meat. Initially four feeds were given daily at
three hourly intervals, with the quantity of food being increased at
each feed until day fifteen from which time only three feeds were
given daily. When they were four weeks old the chicks fed mainly
on diced segments of the adult diet and weaning commenced.
A large number of birds were reared between 1988 and 1990 in
this way. They all grew well and matched their species description
in terms of adult size and weight. The following graph shows the
changes in weight of two chicks during the first three weeks of their
lives.
Although, the above hand rearing technique was successful I
should make the following changes in future. The diet would be
more like that used for Threskiornis species, which are more widely
reared. Segments of diced and skinned chick meat as well as diced
fish would be fed from the beginning. The diet would also be based
on finely diced items of fish and chick meat from the start rather
than on liquidised food.

In the middle of 1990, following the hand-rearing of a reason-
able number of chicks, it was decided that the parent birds should
again be given the chance to rear their own chicks. It was decided
that two simple changes would be made to the management of the
birds during the period when Spoonbill chicks were present in the
aviary. Firstly, and simply, a closer eye would be kept to ensure
that there was always an excess of food available to the adult birds
at this time. Secondly, and of great importance, because previous
chicks had died from stomach compactions, the inclusion of ripped
up day old chickens in the food supply would be discontinued
during the early stages of Spoonbill chick rearing. Ripped up
segments of day old chicken would be re-introduced to the food
supply when the Spoonbill chicks were two weeks old. Even so, any
segments of day old chicks given would, however, be offered only
with their outer skins removed until the Spoonbill chicks ap-
proached the time of weaning when the food supply to the aviary
would be returned to normal. These measures have been success-
ful. Once the skin had been removed from segments of ripped up
chicks no problems from stomach compaction in developing Spoon-
bills were encountered. Having achieved successful parent rearing
of P. alba , the practice of hand-rearing has been discontinued and
we have not yet had to resort to it again.
All seemed to be going well, but an inevitable problem arose in
1991. A combination of two factors led to a stop in the breeding
activity of the birds. Firstly, a particularly severe cold spring
meant that the birds had to be shut in at night until quite late into
the spring time. This meant that their breeding behaviour had been
disturbed by being locked away at night for a period of more than
three months during the winter. Secondly, a problem with our food
supply resulted in a deterioration in the physical condition of
several birds. As a result no breeding activity was shown by the
birds during 1991.
At the start of the 1992 season our hopes began to rise. The adult
birds were all in good condition and because of milder winter they
had not been disturbed by being locked away at night. W e waited
until July, when nesting began and there was an egg in one of the
nests. Although at first only one pair of birds produced eggs they
laid three all of which hatched successfully. As before extra care
was taken to improve the chances of successful rearing and all
progressed well. Ten days later the youngest chick died. I was
disappointed but not altogether surprised because, although parent

Spoonbills frequently manage to rear successfully two chicks
concurrently, it is rare for them to manage to rear three chicks in
such a competitive nest. The two older chicks continued to do well
and by October both had fledged and could be seen wandering with
the adult birds in the aviary.
Towards the end of October 1992, while preparing to leave
Birdworld to take up a position abroad, I spent much time watching
the two fledgling birds. Few other species had given me as much
pleasure and satisfaction to breed as these Spoonbills. Although
the two chicks were now practically independent they looked
immature. The bill had reached only half of its eventual size and
prominence in comparison to the skull size. The other clear
indication of immaturity was the grey colour of the exposed facial
skin and legs. These skin areas do not become red until the birds
are at least a year old. It takes slightly over two years for the birds
to become completely mature.
The African Spoonbill group at Birdworld has fared so well
during the past five years primarily because the size of the aviary
used to accommodate them has been great enough to allow them to
keep in good condition. I believe breeding of this species cannot
be achieved unless the adult birds are in the peak of fitness and
health. I am also convinced that the success would not have been
possible without the help and far-sightedness of Bristol Zoo who
allowed their group of birds to be merged with ours in order to give
us a larger group and increase their group interaction. Perhaps only
a fraction of our success would have taken place with our smaller
and limited population.

BREEDING THE PURPLE-NAPED LORY
By Lawrence Kuah
(Singapore)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994479666666667" page_id="56294155"  page_num="72" year="" vol="">
The Purple-naped or Ceram Lory Lorius domicellus is one of the
most beautiful of the lories. Although rarely imported, it has been
well-known since the time of Linne who named it. Unfortunately
few observations of this species in captivity have been published,
although Tom Spence of Fife, Scotland, described his breeding
records in the Avicultural Magazine in 1955. This lory is even
more attractive in shape and colour than the Black-capped Lory
Lorius lory. It has a bright coral red body. There is a yellow band
across the breast and violet-blue on the bends of the wings and
thighs. The forehead and crown are black and the nape is streaked
with violet-purple feathers. These dazzling colours are at their best
when the bird displays or suns itself.
Purple-naped Lories have always been rare in captivity and their
presence in collections in Asia has not been well-documented. In
Singapore, it is kept by only a few specialist breeders whose
numbers range from two to, in one collection,almost sixty pairs.
Small numbers are also kept in parks and other institutions in many
different countries but its status in captivity is uncertain, one book
on lories stating incorrectly that there are only some 30 known pairs
in the hands of aviculturists. Although we know that there are
greater numbers in captivity, the species is not common or well-
established and every one fortunate enough to own these birds
should make positive efforts to breed from them.
They are rare and uncommon in the wild and there are no recent
reports on its current status, population and possible endanger-
ment. It is found only in the Indonesian islands of Ceram, Ambon
(Amboina) and, according to Forshaw, Buru where it has b^en
introduced. Trading is a potential threat to its survival in the wild.
However restrictions by CITES on the trade (it is listed in CITES
Appendix II) and its national protected status in Indonesia should
ensure its continued existence in the wild.
This species, like many other lories, is not sexually dimorphic
and therefore chromosome or surgical sexing is recommended for
those trying to form pairs for breeding. My previous efforts to sex
them by physical differences and appearance have ended mostly in
failure, as either sex can be larger and the coloration varies slightly

with individuals. Some records state that young birds have a very
much broader band of yellow on the breast and that the purple on
the nape is more extensive and extends from the crown. My
experience with several pairs shows that this is untrue for the young
birds of my most recent breeding do not have any yellow on the
breast. The purple on the nape also varies. In one specimen, it is
minimal and most of the nape is a very attractive turquoise green.
All of the young bred in my collection have pointed tail feathers in
contrast to the adults in which the feathers have rounded ends and
their coloration is also less intense.
They are extremely aggressive and only one pair can be kept in
an aviary or cage because they will kill and harass other specimens
of the same species kept with them. They are also dangerous to
other birds and one of my birds managed to kill a fully spurred adult
male Peacock Pheasant in the same aviary. Some pairs resent
intrusion and may show their annoyance by seriously plucking or
maiming their young. However, tame specimens can be extremely
affectionate and one of these allows me to touch him all over, even
on the rump and under the wings. In some rare cases, pairs can turn
on and kill each other but, in the majority of cases, they form strong
pair bonds, often shrieking and screaming, if their mate is removed
or when checking the nest. For these reasons, I do not attempt to
look into their nest boxes, once the eggs have hatched because
chicks have been literally torn to pieces after I inspected them.
Purple-naped Lories, like most other lories, love bathing, and it
never fails to amuse me to see the birds in their water containers,
just fitting their bodies in and splashing about. When it rains
lightly or when the sprinkler comes on for my macaws, they rush
and hang down from the wire roof of their aviary and bathe.
One of the most recent breedings is described below:
On 9th March 1991, the first egg was laid and, two days later,
another one was produced, The female started incubation after the
second egg was laid. Throughout the whole of the incubation
period, the female sat rather fitfully and came off the eggs at the
slightest disturbance or noise. The male stood &amp;quot;guard&amp;quot; outside on
the main perch and it needed only his shrill cry to raise the alarm
once he saw anything unusual when the two birds would sway and
threaten with the male acting most aggressively. It was, at times,
difficult to feed them or inspect the nest. In some of my other pairs,
young chicks, up to 2 weeks old, were torn apart and dismembered
by their parents after they had been inspected and photographed.
Older chicks, were sometimes plucked very severely and had the

tips of their wings and their toes bitten off. It is unfortunate that
because of my busy schedule, I am unable to remove all the chicks
for hand-rearing. Therefore, because of the problems listed above,
efforts are made not to open the nest box and disturb the birds. The
nest boxes are about 40 cm high with the base 25 x 25 cm and a wire
ladder with some small blocks of wood is nailed inside.
Two young at 12 weeks of age.
The first chick hatched after 23 - 24 days, and the other 2 days
later. The female was heard begging for food and the male
promptly responded by feeding her. The chicks were seen peering
out at about 80 days and, at this stage, the male bird was extremely
aggressive. It was not even possible to look at the birds directly
from a distance because the male would put up a very loud protest
with all the threat displays. The two chicks were removed on the
86th day. They had short tails, with pointed tips, an extensive
spread of purple on the nape and, in this case, one of the chicks
showed no trace of yellow on the breast. They fed themselves and
were given the adult mixture with plenty of fruit added. After
settling down in the nursery for a few days they were friendly and
trusting and, at times, they were released into the room. It was a
delight to watch them hopping about, peering at the corners and
ends. The only drawback was the constant squirt of liquid drop-
pings which finally convinced me that they would do better in a
cage!
All the adult breeding pairs are accommodated in suspended
cages of 160 x 80 x 80 cm high and are fed approximately three
times a day with additional fruit when available. The staple diet is
made of milk, wholemeal bred, baby cereal like Farlene, fruit
concentrate, honey or granulated sugar and a special pellet of fruit.
These are blended together, with pre-soaked pellets to form a

watery gruel. Great care is taken to see that the mixture is very
dilute as a concentrated mixture tends to kill the birds after some
time. Once a week, two egg yolks are blended in and vitamins, in
the form of Nekton (Nekton Products, Germany), and calcium
gluconate are added. Chopped fruits are mixed into the mixture for
the mid day feeding and, subject to availability, a variety of
chopped fruits like apples, soft pear, melon, guava, papaya, banana
and oranges is offered. So far the banana has been given every day.
Lories are very expensive to feed. Since my collection is made up
of many different species of lories with large colonies of some
species and stands at a few hundred birds, the average amount of
fruit consumed per day by the lories alone, is about 15 kilograms
and the staple food mixture in the liquid form can be in the region
of 30 to 40 litres for each feeding! Hosing down the floors twice
a day, spraying all the cages with disinfectant once, takes supreme
efforts and involves an enormous amount of work. Lories kept in
suspended or any other form of cage, tend to grow long nails which,
if left unattended, may catch in the wire resulting in a broken leg
or bleeding toes as the nail gets pulled out by the bird. Hygiene is
extremely important and efforts are always made not to crowd
birds, especially the young from each season, as they catch enteritis
and other diseases very quickly. I use antibiotics for the treatment
of the various illnesses which occur. I do not advise the use of
chlortetracyline as this has caused troublesome fungal conditions
in sick birds. However, with good care and proper husbandry,
lories are very hardy and the Purple-naped Lory is one of the
hardiest.
Not much is known about this lory in the wild and its status in
captivity is still uncertain. Hence, aviculturists must make sure
that proper records are kept and a stud-book maintained, to ensure
that stocks of these lories do not stagnate and inbreeding is not
practised. Only, in this way, can we ensure that the Purple-naped
Lory, one of the most beautiful and delightful of avicultural
subjects, will become common and firmly established in avicul-
ture. Then, if there is an urgent need to provide stocks for an
endangered wild population in the future, all of the holders of this
species will be able to contribute and promote another aspect of
conservation which is now badly needed. In conclusion I wish to
thank my assistant, Miss Theresa Ferrer, without whose great
efforts and expert management nothing would be possible.

HOW TO IDENTIFY THE RED JUNGLE FOWL

the world the species is under threat and is in need of protection.
Until recently, however, there have been few serious studies of this
interesting bird as most people assume that it is too like the
domestic fowl to justify a separate investigation. There are,
however, many notable differences, both in appearance and in
behaviour. Accurate identification of the Red Jungle Fowl may
well contribute to its preservation since this rare bird could easily
be mistaken for a common domestic fowl and end up in the cooking
pot rather than as a delight for the ornithologist.
Indian Red Jungle Fowl Gallus gallus murchi (male).
The most conspicuous difference between the two birds is in the
spur, which, in the Red Jungle Fowl, is long and sharp, thus making
it a far more effective fighter than the domestic fowl. Its plumage
is generally more brightly coloured and there is a patch of white
feathers at the base of the tail coverts. These feathers are particu-
larly noticeable when the bird is in flight, thus making it an easy
target for the hunter. The female bird also differs from thedomestic

Differences in the behaviour of the Red Jungle Fowl and the
domestic fowl are equally marked. A recent study has shown the
former to be strictly monogamous in captivity unlike its polyga-
mous domestic counterpart. Furthermore, the Red Jungle Fowl
begins to fly after only three weeks of life but the domestic fowl
does not take to the air. Although the chick is safe from the hunter
in captivity it spends much of its time attempting to fly within the
confines of its enclosure. Agitated behaviour can even become
threatening and when attempts are made to catch the male bird it
will face an intruder rather than run away. When caught, the Red
Jungle Fowl remains ominously silent and does not emit its natural
call which is sharp and shrill and which is accompanied by a strong
flapping of the wings. Females are always quiet in contrast to
domestic hens which clearly advertise the location of their nesting
sites with loud clucking noises during the laying period. It is
important that their differences should be known if the Red Jungle
Fowl, an endangered species, is to be saved from extinction.

By Josef H. Lindholm, III (Zoological Park, Fort Worth).
24th November, 1991 marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of
the foundation of the Zoological Society of San Diego. Kenton C.
Lint, Emeritus Curator of Birds for the Society, celebrated his
eightieth birthday on 19th March, 1992. During his forty years at
the Zoo, from 1936 to 1976, as Curator of Birds for most of this
period, the bird collection achieved monumental status, its greatest
year-end statistics being for 31st December 1969, when 3,465
specimens of 1,126 taxa (in 96 families) were recorded. By 1976,
more than 425 taxa of birds had been bred at San Diego. The work
was documented by K. C. Lint, first as meticulous notes, then as a
mass of articles, in various journals of which I have compiled a list
of those which were published in Zoonooz, the Avicultural Maga-
zine , the International Zoo Yearbook and the A.F.A. Watchbird.
Along with the New York Zoological Society's Wildlife Conser-
vation (previously known as Animal Kingdom and the Bulletin of
the New York Zoological Society , Zoonooz , the Magazine of the
Zoological Society of San Diego since 1926, is the only regular
publication by an American Zoo to be found routinely in academic
and scientific libraries. In addition to the 98 articles published
there that were entirely or partly written by K. C. Lint, there is an
abundance of avicultural articles written by Belle Benchley, Ken
Stott, James Dolan, Kerry Muller, Arthur Risser, Alan Lieberman,
William Toone, David Rimlinger, and many others. They were
lavishly illustrated with photographs, especially, for the last 25
years, by Ron Garrison, assisted by F. D. Schmidt. Zoonooz is a
major source of avicultural information. In common with the
Avicultural Magazine , but very few other zoo periodicals, back
issues for many years continue to be available from the Zoological
Society&apos;s offices.
When he obtained his Master of Science Degree in Animal and
Poultry Husbandry from Oklahoma A &amp; M (now Oklahoma State
University), after working his way through college in the depres-
sion years K.C. went west to the San Diego Zoo, which despite
chaotic finances and eccentric administration, had, by 1936, earned
an international reputation. For his first two years as a San Diego
keeper, K.C. did not work with birds, but was responsible for cats
and bears and raised litters of Polar Bears, Jaguars, Leopards and

Lions. When he finally managed a transfer to the Bird Department
in 1938, he found it dominated by Karl Koch, an occasionally
formidable German aviculturist, perviously employed at the famed
Selig Zoo in Los Angeles (the home of the &amp;quot;MGM Lion 1 &apos;), and by
Karl Ring, a Swedish aristocrat who, at times appeared to be largely
occupied with transporting, with a long-handled spoon, the eggs of
his beloved pigeons and doves to the nests of foster parents. The
Bird collection in 1938 was supported by the generosity of several
philanthropists, particularly Dr. Harry Wegeforth, the founder of
the Zoological Society, and titular Director until his death in 1941,
who had returned from a voyage to Asia and the Dutch East Indies
with a wonderful collection of animals, and Allen Hancock and
Fred Lewis, both of whom were owners of luxurious yachts and
sponsors of scientific expeditions. They were mainly responsible
for San Diego&apos;s collection of birds from the Galapagos Islands and
other parts of the Eastern Pacific, which were described in some of
K.C.&apos;s earlier articles.
After his years of military service in the Pacific (during which
Mrs. Belle J. Benchley, the beloved Zoo Director, cared personally
for a major portion of the bird collection), K.C. returned to San
Diego, and assumed the Curatorship of Birds in 1947. In 1942 the
bird staff consisted of four keepers caring for 3,000 specimens and
in the earlier years of K. C.&apos;s curatorship, the situation was not
greatly different. 1951 was the first year in which K.C. had
Christmas Day off after he came to work at the Zoo.
From 1954, K.C.&apos;s yearly literary output increased spectacu-
larly. It coincided with the arrival of Dr. Charles Schroeder, who
was to be Director for the next eighteen years. Dr. Wegeforth, and
Mrs. Benchley, had managed to create in difficult circumstances
one of the world&apos;s great animal collections, which Dr. Schroeder
developed into an enormously successful, affluent international
tourist attraction, &amp;quot;The Biggest Zoo in the World&amp;quot;, at the same time
maintaining very high standards in research, the propagation of
threatened and endangered species, and the intelligent presentation
of animals to the public.
The Zoological Society of San Diego has the largest member-
ship of any zoological society in the world. For members outside
of Southern California, and therefore not often able to avail them-
selves of the privilege of free admission to the Zoo and Wild
Animal Park, Zoonooz is usually the major enticement. It is also
available through a separate subscription. Dr. Schroeder expected
his curators to make frequent contributions to the Society&apos;s journal.

At the same time the continuing expansion of the staff under his
administration not only allowed for this but made possible expedi-
tions by Curators, the results of which enhanced San Diego&apos;s
reputation as a collection of rare species. K.C. was sent on three
major expeditions. The first, to Australia in the winter of 1957 - 58
(Lint, 1957, 1958), resulted in a shipment of 49 taxa of birds,
including pairs of Magpie Larks (Lint, 1960) and Tawny Frogmouths
(Lint, 1968), which were to establish first breeding records for the
Western Hemisphere. K.C. did not write about his second expedi-
tion in 1961 to several countries in Asia but the several wonderful
shipments which resulted were illustrated and described by other
authors in Zoonooz. However, he did write two articles
(Lint 1962 ), on the first Western Hemisphere breeding of the
Rothschild&apos;s Mynah from birds obtained in this way. K.C. is also
proud of bringing back, on this expedition, the first Proboscis
Monkeys to breed outside Asia. The third expedition, in 1964, to
capture Brazilian Hummingbirds with Augusto Ruschi, to stock
San Diego&apos;s newly opened Hummingbird house, is written up (Lint,
1965).

on Hummingbirds was never completed because of the sudden
death of his wife Marie in 1983 after a marriage of 46 years.
Despite recent setbacks in his health, K.C. continues an active
interest in aviculture and maintains an international correspond-
ence. At his home of more than forty years, surrounded with a
wonderful private museum of avicultural mementos and artifacts
from his expeditions, he continues to breed mutant Peach-faced
Lovebirds and other birds. His spirited contributions to the Taxon
Advisory Committee for Hornbills, at the 1991 Annual Convention
of the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquaria, in
San Diego, will not be forgotten by those present. I have been
continuously advised by K.C. while assisting in the stocking of the
enormous glass-roofed atrium at the Fort Worth Zoo's Primate
House which was opened in 1992. In particular after being repeat-
edly assured that Pin-tailed Whydahs are not dangerous in really
large aviaries, I found that such is indeed the case. The three males
of this notoriously aggressive bird &amp;quot;charged and scattered&amp;quot; the
flocks of Orange-cheeked and St. Helena Waxbills and Red-
cheeked Cordon Bleus as they foraged (often within several feet of
an adult Gorilla), but never made physical contact, and were not
persistent - so that the possibility of a first U.S. zoo breeding of this
bird in a natural fashion looks bright.
That so important an avicultural career should be so thoroughly
documented can only be of increasing value to aviculture

Society&apos;s longtime Photographic Supervisor, and especially grateful to Edalee
Orcutt Harwell, Photo Archivist, who gave me free run of the historical files and was
most delightful company during my time there.
I am of course grateful to K.C. himself, for sharing many anecdotes and for
providing me with a copy of his 1984 State University interviews (Lint et al 1990).

(1940) Interesting birds at the San Diego Zoo. Ibid. XII (No. 1) 3 - 6. At the time
of writing, 2981 birds of 487 species were inventoried. This article is a fairly
detailed discussion of inhabitants of the Small Bird House (demolished in the
1960&apos;s) which held 502 birds of 175 species, in twenty-five cages. Among species
discussed are six taxa of Ramphastos Toucans, Blue-crowned Motmot, Blue-cheeked
Barbet Megallaima asiatica. Sun-bittern, Bare-throated Bellbird, and Pagoda My-
nahs Sturnus pagodarum that mimic Bodwhites and Troupials.

Pyrrhura leucotis.
(1942) Bird Department. Ibid. XIV (No. 2) 3. The bird staff numbers four
persons, caring for &amp;quot;3,000&amp;quot; birds. Ten small gamebird breeding pens were recently
completed. Among the species to be set up in this facility will be Mearn&apos;s, Jungle-
bush and Rain Quail, Green Junglefowl, Green Peafowl, Blue-eared Pheasants,
Phillippine Banded Rails, Bleeding-heart Pigeons and Crowned Pigeons. It is
intended to incubate Ratite eggs, and nesting behaviour was noted with Andean
Condors.

1948. During this period 728 specimens were added to the collection and 285 died.
Although more taxa were present before the war, Mr. Lint considers the 1948
inventory to be &amp;quot;the finest bird collection in the history of our Zoo&amp;quot;. Among many
unusual accessions were Shoebills, Florida Sandhill Cranes, Cabot&apos;s Terns, Euro-
pean Wood Pigeons and Keas. Significant hatchings included many eventually
surplused Emus, the first captive-bred female Andean Condor, artificially insemi-
nated Ocellated Turkeys, the Zoo&apos;s first Scarlet Macaws, and many others. A Kagn
died after 22 years at the Zoo. This is K.C. Lint&apos;s first article as Curator of Birds.
(1949) Bird Department report. Ibid. XXII (No. 9) 4. 1,274 birds of 364 taxa
were present at 30th June 1949, 859 specimens were added in the previous fiscal
year. Mortality was the lowest in five years; 128 birds, of which a significant loss
was a Leadbeater&apos;s Cockatoo, obtained in 1925. Significant acquisitions included
Hyacinth Macaws, Scarlet-chested Grass Parakeets, and the Zoo&apos;s First Concave-
casqued Hornbills, among many others. The Zoo now possesses one of the few
potential breeding pairs of Sandhill Cranes in captivity. Among the 33 taxa

BREEDING THE SIBERIAN ROBIN
By Patrick Taplin (Cobham).

<bodyText confidence="0.997689243243243" page_id="56294176"  page_num="93" year="" vol="">
The Siberian or Pallas's Blue Robin Erithacus cyanea is about
the same size (5 Vi&amp;quot;) and shape as the European Robin E. rubecula
which is one of the few other species belonging to the same genus.
In its habits it resembles the Nightingale more than the European
Robin because it is a shy, skulking bird with a preference for low
perching in dense cover. It exhibits marked sexual dimorphism and
both the males and the females are very attractive. The underparts
of the males are white and the upperparts are dark blue. There is
a broad, black streak from the bill to the sides of the breast. The
bill is black and the legs and feet are flesh coloured. The hen has
whitish underparts with brown scales on the breast and olive brown
upperparts. The brown tail has a bluish hue and her bill is brownish
black.
The Siberian Blue Robin lives in forest undergrowth and it can
be seen on the edges of clearings. It breeds in Siberia and China and
migrates south to southern China, India and Malaya. The species
is not often imported into the U.K. and there is little information
about it in the avicultural literature. My pair was obtained a couple
of years ago. The cock and the hen were housed separately during
the winter of 1991/92 in flight cages 30&amp;quot; long x 15 &amp;quot; x 15&amp;quot; in a room
where the temperature never fell below 60* F and which was lit
naturally or artificially for twelve to fourteen hours per day. Their
diet consisted of Prosecto (a fine grade food for insectivorous birds
manufactured by John E. Haith, Cleethorpes) and mealworms. In
March the pair was transferred to a planted aviary 18&apos; long x 12 &apos;
wide x 7&apos; 6&amp;quot; high with a small lean-to shelter 3&apos; x 3&apos; x 3&apos; which the
birds apparently never used. The aviary was provided with conifer
branches and the ground was newly planted with ivy, pyracantha
and honeysuckle. Several nesting receptacles including finch
boxes, plant pots and wicker baskets were placed in appropriate
sites in the aviary and coconut fibre and dried grass were provided
for nesting material.
For about a fortnight before nest building the cock bird sang
from dawn to dusk and displayed frequently to the hen with bobbing
tail and dropped wings. The hen chose a south-facing 4Vi &amp;quot;x4 1 /^&amp;quot; x4 1 /4&amp;quot;,
half-open finch box, which was nailed to the side of the shelter
about 5&apos; 6&amp;quot; above the ground and in which she made a nest of

coconut fibre lined with moss and feathers. Nest building was
completed in about 3 days and on 12th June the first egg was laid.
It was followed by two more on the following day. This was a
fateful day when the cock was let out of the aviary by accident -
never to be seen again. The hen unconcernedly laid another 2 eggs
to complete her clutch which she incubated until 27th June when
pieces of egg shell were seen on the aviary floor. Three newly
hatched, blind and almost naked chicks with a little grey down were
seen in the nest. The hen&apos;s diet was supplemented with waxworms,
very small mealworms and Vionate added to the Prosecto. One of
the chicks died soon after hatching but the other two thrived and left
the nest on 9th July. They resembled the hen but they were more
mottled and had short stumpy tails. Now (December 1992) their
backs have developed a bluish tinge and I think they are cocks.
This is probably the first successful breeding of the Siberian
Blue Robin in this country. Anyone who knows of a previous
breeding in the U.K. is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

CHESTER ZOO REVIEW - 1992
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992077368421052" page_id="56294178"  page_num="95" year="" vol="">
By Roger Wilkinson (Curator of Birds).
The bird collection at Chester Zoo has remained fairly constant
in size but not in species held over the last ten to twelve years. At
the end of 1992 our annual report recorded 832 birds of 188 species.
This compares with 700 birds of 191 species at the end of 1980
which fell to 640 birds of 158 species at the end of 1983. The
increase in numbers of individuals held at the end of recent years
largely reflects an increase in breeding success with many birds of
the year held over into the early spring before these are placed in
other collections.
This increase in numbers of birds bred has already placed some
strain on our operations and in 1993 we will have to be even more
selective in deciding which species we may allow to breed. In 1992
for example we decided not to breed from our Emus Dromaius
novaehollandiae and reduced the rearing of common waterfowl by
not taking eggs for artificial incubation instead relying more on
parent rearing. Nevertheless, our staff and birds between them
equalled their previous recent best year of 1991 by rearing over 300
birds of 73 species.
We were particularly pleased that our Waldrapp Ibis Geronticus
eremita hatched sixteen chicks of which thirteen were successfully
reared. All were reared under their parents some with additional
help through supplementary feeding by their keepers. Each chick
was weighed daily and only fed additional food if judged to be
under weight. The parents did not object to this monitoring and for
most chicks no additional feeding was required after the first week.
In order to balance the numbers of chicks in different nests several
chicks from later broods were fostered to parents with smaller
broods. This required considerable skill and very careful record-
keeping on the part of the keepers, especially with regard to
keeping track of each chicks &apos;real&apos; parents as is necessary for
careful population management. That however begs another ques-
tion for promiscuity has been previously reported in Waldrapps in
both captivity and in the wild.
All our Waldrapps were recently blood-sampled for DNA &amp;quot;fin-
ger printing&amp;quot;. This work should enable determination of whether
extra pair matings (promiscuity) or even egg-dumping (when fe-
males &apos;dump&apos; their eggs by laying them in other birds nests) have

occurred in our colony. More importantly, together with samples
taken from other captive birds, they should permit an assessment of
the degree of genetic variability now present within the captive
Waldrapp population. This has important implications for both the
management of our captive birds and also for any future
reintroductions of these birds to the wild.
Caribbean Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber ruber reared five
chicks and a further two chicks were reared by the Chilean Flamin-
gos Phoenicopterus chilensis. These birds have been held in
separate but adjacent enclosures since 1990. The Chileans had
reared chicks in 1991, the first year in their new enclosure. The
Caribbeans although nest building in 1991 did not lay that year.
The Caribbeans and Chileans built nests very close to each other on
either side of the dividing fence. At least nine pairs of Caribbeans
and four pairs of Chileans laid eggs. Unfortunately, their nests
were positioned in such a way as to make observations difficult; and
the identities of nesting birds were only obtained with some
difficulty; for several birds these were undetermined. One lonely
faithful Caribbean male stood on the other side of the fence from
the nest of its previous Chilean partner, which this year reared a
chick with a different Chilean male than had successfully partnered
her in 1991. Four other Chilean couples remained in the same
pairings as in 1991. Similarly, at least four of the pairs of
Caribbeans which laid in 1992 retained the same mates as when
they previously attempted breedings in 1989. Two other Caribbean
pairs which bred for the first time in Chester had been held together
in a previous collection up to 1989 and may have continued long
term pair bonds. Only one new pair was established using a male
Caribbean which in 1989 had been paired with a Chilean female.
Humboldt's Penguins Spheniscus humboldti hatched only five
chicks of which four were hand-reared. Ostrich Struthio camelus
chicks were incubator hatched but none were successfully reared.
Our Greater Rheas Rhea americana incubated eggs in the paddock
but a summer downpour flooded out their nest and also that of our
Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca. With a little more luck we might
have had an even better year. Excluding domestic varieties, eggs
were laid by 123 species and chicks hatched from 89.
White-faced Scops Owls Otus leucotis bred for the first time at
Chester rearing two exquisite youngsters. A female Milky Eagle
Owl Bubo lacteus was received on loan from Antwerp Zoo to pair
with the male previously loaned from Rotterdam Zoo. During the
winter the divisions were removed from the rows of owl aviaries

thus doubling the size but halving the number of these enclosures.
As a consequence we have to dispose of some of our owls and rather
reluctantly moved on our breeding pair of Great Horned Owls Bubo
virginianus and also had to find a new home for one of our two pairs
of Barn Owls Tyto alba. The remaining pair produced a brood of
four chicks which were again donated to the Keele University
release scheme. Our eldest pair of Spectacled Owls Pulsatrix
perspicillata laid but the female which was received as an adult
over ten years ago is now looking elderly and our hopes are with a
young pair which are yet to lay. Owls can live a long time in zoos
as illustrated by our female Vermiculated Fishing Owl Scotopelia
bouvieri . Received at Chester in 1969 she laid again in 1992. This
egg was shaken to prevent any chance of a hybrid being produced
as a result of her being held together with a male Rufous Fishing
Owl Scotopelia ussheri - himself at least twenty years old. Again
the plea - if anybody knows of any of these Fishing Owls in other
collections please contact me.
A male Andean Condor Vultur gryphus was puppet-reared - the
ninth chick to be reared at Chester. Sadly our male Bateleur Eagle
Terathopius ecaudatus died during the year and we have not yet
been able to locate a replacement mate for our female. The most
significant new arrivals were a pair of European Black Vultures
Aegypus monachus , also known as Cinereous Vultures or Monk
Vultures. The male was received on loan from Arnhem Zoo in
Holland and the female donated by Flamingoland. We have a new
aviary planned for these in 1993. At the time of writing, they are
being held in the old Wedge-tailed Eagle Aquila audax enclosure.
The former occupants have been loaned to Arnhem Zoo.
Waterfowl had a good season with eighteen species hatched
from which seventeen species were successfully reared. Our only
disappointment was with Smew Mergus albellus where both duck-
lings died during rearing. Black-necked Swans Cygnus melanoco-
ryphus reared four cygnets and Ruddy-headed Geese Chloephaga
rubidiceps, Cereopsis Geese Cereopsis novaehollandiae, Emperor
Geese Anser canagicus and Laysan Teal Anas platyrhynchos
laysanensis were all parent reared. Other ducks reared included
White-winged Wood Duck Cairina scutulata. Hooded Merganser
Mergus cucullatus , Baikal Teal Anas formosa and Ruddy Duck
Oxyura jamaicensis. New to the collection were a group of six
White-headed Ducks Oxyura leucocephala.

parent-reared in 1992. A new male Red-crowned Crane was
received to pair with one of the two females received in 1991 from
Walsrode. The male was incompatible with the first female to
which he was introduced but proved immediately compatible with
the second. New arrivals were a pair of Wattled Cranes Bugeranus
carunculatus.
Gough Island Moorhens Gallinula comeri produced three clutches
of eggs but although the last two proved to be fertile no chicks were
hatched. One Little Black Bustard Eupodotis afra was successfully
reared from a pair bred at Paignton Zoo.
Despite having exchanged males with London Zoo the Congo
Peafowl Afropavo congensis again produced infertile eggs. How-
ever we were successful in rearing ten Temini neks Tragopans
Tragopan temminckii (including four reared by the parents), thir-
teen Himalyan Monals Lophophorus impeyanus , nine Edwards
Pheasants Lophura edwardi , two Grey Peacock Pheasants Poly-
plectron bicalcaratum , one Palawan Peacock Pheasant Polyplec -
tron emphanum and a single White Eared Pheasant Crossoptilon
crossoptilon. Three Bare-faced Curassows Crax fasciolata and
five Variable Chachalacas Ortalis motmot were also bred.
Although fifteen Crowned Plovers Vanellus coronatus were
reared our production of Blacksmith&apos;s Plovers Vanellus armatus
was limited to four chicks. Sadly the adult breeding pair of
Blacksmith&apos;s Plovers were lost to a stoat last winter. Having
disposed of the youngsters- we no longer hold this species at
Chester.
Twelve species of pigeons laid eggs but not all were reared.
Mountain Witch Doves Geotrygon versicolor, Luzon Bleeding
Heart Pigeons Gallicolumba luzonica, Celebes Quail Doves Galli-
columba tristigmata and Pink-necked Green Pigeons Treron verrnans
bred successfully. The Suberb Fruit Doves Ptilinopus superbus
laid but never sat full-term; chicks were hatched from eggs fostered
under Java Doves Streptopelia risoria but none were reared to
independence.
Newcomers to the parrot collection were a &apos;pair&apos; of Black-
winged Lories Eos cyangenia (which on sexing proved to be two
females), a pair of English-bred Red-vented Cockatoos Cacatua
haematuropygia and a pair of Georgia-bred Hyacinthine Macaws

ill the collection in 1992 and we expect to receive a mate for this
bird in 1993. Chicks were hatched from sixteen of twenty species
of parrots laying eggs in 1992. Parrots which were parent-reared

Macaws Ara ararauna , Greater Vasa Parrots Coracopsis vasa ,
Lesser Vasa Parrots Coracopsis nigra, Yellow-backed Chattering

chick. The African Grey Hornbills Tockus nasutus epirhinius
reared five chicks from their first brood and a single chick from
their second round. Two Trumpeter Hornbills Bycanistes buccina-
tor were fledged; this pair has reared two chicks every year since
1989. The female Great Indian Hornbill Buceros bicornis was
sealed in the nest but emerged unsuccessfully. Three chicks were
hatched by the Wrinkled Hornbills Aceros corrugatus but the
chicks died before fledging. A male Rhinoceros Hornbill Buceros
rhinoceros was received to pair with our widowed female.
As in 1991 all four species of Touracos laid eggs but in 1992
only White-cheeked Touracos Tauraco leucotis and Schalows Tou-
racos Tauraco schalowi were hatched and reared. Smaller softbills
were generally less successful but White-rumped Shamas Copsy-
chus malabaricus. Fairy Bluebirds Irenapuella , Red-eared Bulbuls
Pycnonotus jocosus , Silver-beaked Tanagers Ramphocelus carbo
and Purple Glossy Starlings Lamprotornis purpureus all reared
chicks. A U.K. first breeding was achieved from the African Pied
Starlings Spreo bicolor which after a number of failures success-
fully fledged a chick. A Silver-eared Mesia Leothrix argentauris
which was hand-reared now greets visitors in the Tropical House.
Java Sparrows Padda oryzivora also again fledged chicks and a
total of fifteen Mexican House Finches Carpodacus mexicanus
were reared.
Disappointments in 1992 included the clutches of infertile eggs
from the Congo Peafowl Afropavo congensis and White-naped
Cranes Grus vipio. A new male White-naped Crane has recently
arrived form Jersey Zoo and so we look forward to seeing how these
birds - and others which were unsuccessful in 1992 will perform in
1993.

The following notes have been contributed by Stewart Pyper:-
In volume 97 of the Avicultural Magazine it was reported on page
42 that M. and D. Low had reared two Black-headed Sugarbirds and
it was thought that this may have been a world first breeding. This
is not so. It is, however, a British first. The world first belongs to
Edward Marshall Boehm in 1961 as recorded by Charles Ever it!
(his curator) in Volume 68, pages 49 - 50, 1962.
Recent British first breedings that have been recorded in For-
eign Birds the magazine of the Foreign Bird League are Yellow-
throated Laughing Thrush and Red-faced Liocichla by B. Massey,
White-bellied Sunbird by P. D. Fisher, Green-headed Sunbird by E.
and T. Davison and Celebes Hanging Parrot by Julia M. Gough.
Incidentally, the League was founded early in 1933 and this is
therefore its sixtieth anniversary.
Alan Griffiths reports that in 1992 he had a successful breeding
of the Black-headed Sibia. Few appear to have been bred. The
Foreign Bird Federation's Breeding Registers since 1984 record
single birds bred in 1986 and 1991. A. Sheriff is credited with the
first British breeding in 1925 on page 185 of that year&apos;s issue of the
Avicultural Magazine.

Dave Coles has contributed the following:
Writing on 17th August, Kevin Eatwell reports the successful
rearing of two Straw-crowned Bulbuls after seven years of trying.
He also has eight independent Orange-spotted Bulbuls with three
just fledged and another three youngsters in the nest. Since he first
bred them in 1989 a considerable number of birds have been reared
and they are now at the third generation.
More than ten years of effort by the Philippine Eagle Conserva-
tion Programme Foundation have been rewarded with the first
Philippine Eagle Pithecphaga jefferyi to be bred in captivity. At
the Centre at Davao on Mindanao, the eaglet was conceived through
artificial insemination and hatched using incubators. There are
Relieved to be only 200 left in the wild with a small number in
captivity worldwide, thirteen of which are at the Centre (Oriental
Bird Club Bulletin, No. 15, p.14.).

main drawback is that it produces infertility if it needs to be given
during the laying period. Now Jansson&apos;s, the manufacturers of
Mebenvet, are marketing Flubenvet as the standard in-feed an-
thelmintic. Its main advantage is that it has no effect on fertility
and is a seven day only course of treatment. Mebenvet is still
available for &amp;quot;on-site&amp;quot; medication by keepers.
A new species of Scops Owl has been discovered on the island
of Anjouan in the Comoros. Although a Scops Owl was recorded
there in 1886, there have been no definite sightings since then and
the bird was believed to be a sub-species of the more widely
distributed Madagascar Scops Owl. The discovery resulted from a
search, initiated by a mystery call, involving Roger Safford, sup-
ported by I.C.B.P., in three visits to the island over two years.
Safford and his colleagues were first alerted, while camping beside
a remote lake on Anjouan, when they heard a weird whistling call
which they thought at first might be that of a seabird. Unable to
locate the source of the call, Safford returned a second time but it
was not until his third visit that, with the help of a 77 year old local
wildlife expert and several villagers, he traced the call to a Scops
Owl. The call and close examination of individual birds confirm
that it is definitely a separate species. It has been named the
Anjouan Scops Owl Otus capriodes (I.C.B.P. World Birdwatch).
The gravely endangered Bali Starling is showing encouraging
signs of recovery. Restricted to the Bali Barat National Park the
wild population, according to a recent census, now stands at 95,
compared with the all-time low of 18 in 1990.
Research for the forthcoming Red Data Book, Threatened Birds
of the Americas has unearthed some interesting findings. Probably
the most important is the rediscovery of the Golden-ringed Tanager
Buthraupis aureocincta, originally known from just four speci-
mens taken about 1946 on Carro Tatarna, Columbia. It was found
in fair numbers and is described as common. What may prove to be
a new species of Vireo has been found in the Alto de Pisones area
of Columbia.

breasted Shrike, Orange-bellied or Hardwick&apos;s Leafbird, Fairy
Bluebird and Yellow-winged Sugarbird created quite a sensation.
The entry reflected the considerable range of species of Bulbul that
we have recently been fortunate enough to see imported into this
country, one of the more spectacular ones being the Collared Finch-
billed Bulbul Spizixos semitorques with its black and white striped
head and olive green body. Five species of Sunbird, the Black,
Scarlet-chested, White-bellied, Grey and Malachite were benched
and they rivalled the colourful array of Lorikeets, including the
Stella&apos;s, Black-winged, Goldie&apos;s, Musschenbroek&apos;s, Ornate and
Rainbow, and several Philippine and Blue-crowned Hanging Par-
rots. Amongst all the galaxy of the above it came as a great surprise
to see the award for &amp;quot;Best Bird on Show&amp;quot; go to a humble Blackhead
Canary Serinus alario staged by Mr. Shaun Wilkinson in the most
superb condition. This goes to show that judges regard immaculate
condition as the most important aspect in placing their awards, are
not unduly swayed by rarity or spectacular colouring, and that even
the ordinary fancier with an inexpensive collection of birds can, if
he looks after them well enough, compete on equal terms with his
more wealthy and sophisticated counterpart. At the National Con-
ference held in conjunction with the show the major breeding
achievements of the year were discussed and voted upon, and the
medal for the &amp;quot;Breeding of the Year&amp;quot; was awarded to Mr. Dirk
Norval of Vryheid for breeding the Greater Double-collared Sunbird

Ken Dolton has drawn my attention to two interesting items in
recent issues of the &amp;quot;New Scientist&amp;quot;. One, under the heading of a
dreadful pun &amp;quot;Pining for Parrots&amp;quot;, refers to attempts by the Arizona
Game and Fish Department to re-introduce the Thick-billed Parrot
into its State Pine forests. Of 19 birds released, 12 had been
confiscated from poachers who had taken them from the wild in
Mexico and who were attempting to smuggle them into the United
States. The others had been raised in captivity. Apparently, all of
the wild caught birds formed flocks and are doing well but none of
the captive-bred birds survived. The second item states that the
Russian crews of nuclear submarines take birds and other pets on
their long voyages to help them deal with &amp;quot;stress-related&amp;quot; prob-
lems. Apparently Bullfinches, Goldfinches and Siskins thrive in
such conditions but Parrots fare badly.

Nigel Hewston writes that the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust
bred the Freckled Duck at Slimbridge in 1992 for the first time
outside Australia. One young bird was reared initially, then six
more from a subsequent clutch. Five of these did well and were
transferred to the Trust&apos;s Centre at Llanelly to start a new group
there.
He also reports on the outcome of the turaco census, the results
of which have been sent to all participants and have been published
elsewhere. Five hundred and thirteen birds of seventeen species, in
the possession of 76 keepers in the United Kingdom, were recorded.
In 1992, 87 birds of 11 different species were bred but only two
species produced youngsters numbering double figures. These
were White-cheeked and Livingstone&apos;s with 37 and 13 respectively.
The response was considered sufficiently encouraging to form a
turaco society which will encourage the establishment of captive-
bred populations and support the conservation of these wonderful
birds.
Several species were bred successfully in 1992, probably for the
first time in captivity, in the magnificent collection kept by our
President and Vice-President, Ruth Ezra and Raymond Sawyer, at
their beautiful home in Surrey. They include the Blue-faced
Honeyeater, the Blue Whistling Thrush, the Masked Crimson Tan-
ager, the Black-necked Stilt, the Black-cheeked Woodpecker and
the Masked Lapwing. Furthermore, many other species including
Red-crested, Green-crested and Fischer&apos;s Turaco, Kookaburra,
Hoopoe, Lilac-breasted Roller, Grey-masked Thrush, Red-tailed
Laughing Thrush, Spendid Starling, Azure-winged Magpie, Black-
winged Stilt, Stone Curlew and Avocet were also bred. It is
unlikely that such remarkable success with so many rare species has
ever before been achieved in a single collection.

The male of the pair of Californian Condors, bred in 1991 at San
Diego Zoo, which were released in January 1992, was found dead
in December in north western Los Angeles County. It had died from
poisoning with glycol presumably through drinking antifreeze
liquid which had leaked from the cooling system of a car.
The pair of very rare South American Capuchin Birds
Perissocephalus tricolor at the San Diego Zoo hatched a chick in
September of last year. The parents are probably the only examples
of this species in captivity anywhere in the world.

of time, effort and money during the last few years to the develop-

aviary of Tony and Chris Hickinbottom and four youngsters were
reared.
The news and Views section of the last issue of the Avicultural
Magazine included a note on the breeding success of a pair of
Hoopoes which produced nine chicks last year at Harewood Bird
Gardens. Several breeders have been successful recently with this
attractive species and, in this context, the pair belonging to Brian
Fisher of Norfolk, which produced 13 chicks in 1991 and the same
number in 1992, is particularly worthy of mention.

A Great Pied Hornbill was hatched in February this year at
Avifauna, Alphen a/d Rijn. This is the parent bird's eleventh chick
in thirteen years. According to Hans van der Sluis the species has
bred successfully in captivity in only one other collection (Rostock
Zoo, Germany). Other early (January 1993) breedings at Avifauna
include two Black-chinned Fruit Doves Ptinolopus leclancheri
from different pairs of which one consists of birds bred in the bird
park, four Red-billed Hornbills, two African Black Crakes Porzana
flavirostra and two Diamond Firetails.

The successful breeding of the New Zealand Shore Plover at the
National Wildlife Centre, Mount Bruce, New Zealand has raised
hopes for the re-establishment of this species which now survives
only as a small population on Rangitiva Island in the Chathams.
Eggs were collected from nests all over the island and from them
13 chicks were reared. Four pairs attempted to breed in this first
year and two were successful. It is now hoped to raise at least 30
birds for release on Man a Island, which is rat free, in the next few
years.

Almost immediately after editing the article on the Blue-crowned
Lory Vini australis which appeared in the last issue of the Avicul-
ture Magazine , I left for Gatwick on my way to some of the Pacific
Islands. I hoped to see this species in the wild on the islands of
Samoa and Tonga but I had no luck in this respect in either place.
However I discovered on Tonga a small bird garden called the
Brehm Bird Park, apparently funded by Walsrode, where the
aviaries were almost entirely devoted to this charming little Lory
and to Red Shining Parrots, particularly the maroon race tabuensis,
both of which were breeding well in ideal enclosures.
In the Cook Islands I had better luck. I knew that another
member of the genus Vini the Tahiti Blue Lory Vini peruviana
exists on Aitutaki, a small island about a hundred miles from
Rarotonga. I booked a flight on the regular service between the two
islands with just a faint hope of seeing the Tahiti Blue Lory in the
wild. I had been told to get in touch with Bobby Bishop as soon as
I landed at Aitutaki airport which turned out to be a decrepit
wooden hut at the end of a concrete runway in a field. Everybody
seemed to know everybody else on Aitutaki and so it was not
difficult to contact Bobby Bishop and, without much delay, he
turned up at my hotel, a genial tubby Cook Islander with a tiny
moped, on which we departed in search of Vini peruviana. While
I hung on, precariously and in dire peril, he told me cheerfully,
between ruts and potholes, that although he didn&apos;t &amp;quot;know much
about birds&amp;quot; he was a conservation officer whose particular respon-
sibility was the protection of the Blue Lory or &amp;quot;Nun Bird&amp;quot; as it was
known on the island. It was not far to the gardens of the Aitutaki
Lodges where the Lories were flying overhead in little flocks of
about six to a dozen. Soon some settled in a shrub close by. I was
so excited that I dared not move to get my binoculars out of their
case but I need not have bothered because within minutes several

were feeding on flowers only a few feet away. I had seen this little
tit-like species before at Rosemary Low&apos;s and in the San Diego Zoo
but the sight which I shall never forget is of exquisite little blue
parrots, with round persil-white chest patches, shimmering in the
tropical sunshine against the green hibiscus leaves. It is estimated
that there are now about 250 breeding pairs on Aitutaki, a tiny
island paradise only about five kilometers square. There are no cats
or dogs and few natural predators but I think that this is not the only
reason why the Lories are flourishing. Until a few years ago the
economy of Rarotonga and Aitutaki depended mainly on the export
of bananas to New Zealand but it was stopped by the New Zealand
authorities because the fruit was suspected of carrying some sort of
white fly. The inevitable result was the abandonment of the banana
plantations. Now the bananas grow wild and develop, at the tips of
the fruit, the little white flowers on which the lories thrive. More
importantly, the banana areas are no longer treated with noxious
insecticides, I hope that the new crops, which are being developed,
will not be sprayed with such reckless abandon.
A third species of the genus, the Ultramarine Lory Vini
ultramarina , is now known to exist in reasonable numbers on only
Ua Huka in the Marquesas Islands where its future is threatened by
industral development with the inevitable concomitant invasion by
rats and other predators. Accordingly, arrangements were made,
mainly by the San Diego Zoo, to capture some of the Ultramarine
Lories and transfer them to Fatu Hiva, another island in the group,
which provides a suitable environment with good forest cover,
plant species on which the Lories feed and no predators. In August
last year seven specimens from Ua Huka were liberated on Fatu
Hiva where it is hoped that a new population of the species will
become established.
I remember reading, when I was a schoolboy, the fascinating
articles which the Duke of Bedford wrote in about 1940 on Tahiti
Blue and Ultramarine Lories both of which bred successfully in his
aviaries. He mentioned, almost reverently, the &amp;quot;well know Ameri-
can aviculturist, Eastham Guild, who personally brought over a
number of these Lories.&amp;quot; If the venerable Mr. Guild turned up with
them today he would probably be clapped into gaol!

The home of Gill and Arthur du Venage is situated on the
sheltered and warm north-facing slopes of the Magaliesberg Moun-
tains some 100 kilometres north west of Johannesburg. The
verandah of the old farmhouse in which they live commands an
impressive view of the vast ranges of aviaries in a great semi-circle
further down the beautiful valley and the unspoilt bushveld stretch-
ing away towards the little town of Brits in the distance. They have
retained only the choicest portion of their original &amp;quot;Glenwoods
Farm", on which for many years they cultivated strawberries with
extraordinary success. So unspoilt and rich in natural flora and
fauna is this part of the farm, that the property is officially
registered as a &amp;quot;natural heritage site&amp;quot;, which means that it may
never be sold for any kind of artificial development. It is soon
apparent to any visitor that the du Venages are highly nature
conservation conscious, and this awareness has been a prime
motivating factor behind their assembling over the past 15 years or
so undoubtedly one of the largest collections - if not indeed the
largest and most comprehensive collection - of macaws in the
world, which they now maintain in their so-called &amp;quot;retirement&amp;quot;.
Their farm has now been appropriately re-named &amp;quot;Macaw Glenn&amp;quot;
to reflect its new emphasis.
Gill du Venage has been interested in birds from her early
girlhood, when birds with broken wings, abandoned nestlings and
other foundling specimens were brought to her for her careful
nursing until restored to health and independence. As a child she
kept Budgerigars, and, later on, a more general collection of birds

mainly for the delight of her own children. However, it was her
husband's forgetting her combined birthday and wedding anniver-
sary in 1977 that set the whole family on the road towards the great
macaw collection. The children confided to their father that a
certain huge red and yellow parrot in a Pretoria pet shop seemed to
hold an irresistible attraction for their mother. He, therefore,
decided to buy this bird as a special surprise for her. Thus a Scarlet
Macaw macao came into the family, and proved to be a present
that has self-regenerated ever since! The character and intelli-
gence of this macaw was so captivating that other large parrots
were bought, above all everything that was a macaw. To this end
the du Venages embarked on long car journeys all over South Africa
to wherever macaws were offered for sale.
These were the days prior to surgical sexing and it was hoped
that if enough of a species were obtained a breeding pair would
eventually by chance be found. In the hope of lighting upon the
elusive ''breeding pair" equal sexes of the same species as far as
could be determined were for the most part housed on the &amp;quot;pool
system&amp;quot;. A trio of Military Macaws Ara militaria gave the first
breeding result, and through the years it has been found that the
choosing of their own partners is an extremely important aspect of
the emergence of successful breeding pairs. Once the partners of
a pair have fallen for each other they are then housed as a pair to
a separate aviary.
Then du Venages began to read everything written about ma-
caws on which they could lay hands. The vulnerability of this group
of large parrots in the wild in the long term future, with the
inevitable exploitation of their forest habitats for agriculture to
meet the needs of an escalating human population, was alarming.
Thus they were motivated to establish viable aviary-breeding
stocks of these magnificent birds as a backup to any future disaster
that might strike some of the species. Other parrotlike birds were
phased out so that there could be concentration on macaws as a
group. The basic idea was to buy as many pairs of a species as they
could to ensure as wide a gene pool initially as possible, and to
retain all babies bred until a breeding stock of 15 - 20 pairs per
species was being held. This figure was regarded as a reasonable
insurance that the particular species would be propated in several
different bloodlines on an on going basis so that problems resulting
from too close an inbreeding could be avoided for the future. In a
mere 15 years the du Venages have come a long way towards
fulfilling this ambition, and currently their macaw collection con-

7 pairs, Blue-and-yellow Macaw Ara ararauna 20 pairs, Blue-
throated or Caninde Macaw Ara glaucogularis 9 pairs, Military
Macaw Ara militaris 19 pairs, Buffon&apos;s Macaw Ara ambigua 7
pairs, Scarlet Macaw Ara macao 20 pairs Green-winged Macaw Ara
chloroptera 16 pairs, Red-fronted Macaw Ara rubogenys 12 pairs,
Yellow-collared Macaw Ara auricollis 5 pairs, Chestnut-fronted or
Severe Macaw Ara severa 16 pairs, Red-bellied Macaw Ara mani-
lata 3 pairs, Illiger&apos;s Macaw Ara maracana 17 pairs, and the Red-
shouldered Macaw, divided into Hahn&apos;s Macaw - the smallest Ara
nobilis nobilis 20 pairs, and Noble Macaw, with the whitish upper
mandible Ara nobilis cumanansis 16 pairs. In addition, of course,
a large number of babies are in the process of growing up.
All the species have been bred, and in many cases, what the du
Venages refer to as F2 specimens i.e. the offspring of two birds that
have themselves both been bred at &amp;quot;Macaw Glenn&amp;quot;, have been
produced. This is regarded as the ultimate in breeding success and
has so far been achieved with the Blue-and-yellow, Military,
Scarlet, Chestnut-fronted, Illiger&apos;s and Noble. The breeding results
achieved in this collection, apart from reflecting good management
on the part of the owners, prove that as a group the macaws take well
to life in captivity and breed quite easily, provided that the owner
has the patience, as most wild caught macaws take many years to
settle down sufficiently to breed. Research in America has shown
that on average wild caught macaws take 5 - 6 years to breed and
Hyacinth Macaws 9 - 10 years.
A good example of breeding success is shown by the results
obtained from 4 wild caught pairs of Caninde Macaws purchased in
1980. All 4 pairs have now reared young, a total of 17 by the end
of 1991, with a further 15 for 1992. Of course there are differences
in the degree of difficulty of breeding the various species and of the
ease with which they adapt to captivity. For example in this
collection it has been found that the Hyacinth is the most difficult
Macaw to handle in captivity, that the Red-bellied is more difficult
to breed and establish in aviculture than the others, and that the
Caninde is the shyest and most reserved in that not one caught or
parent-reared bird will come for titbits until the attendant has left
the whole aviary complex, and their faces blush a deep pink
whenever people come near them. The most alert of the macaws,
the ones that will invariably raise the alarm at night on the approach
of some wild animal or unusual car lights, are the Red-fronted and
the Caninde Macaws. Arthur has even on occasion had to work out

how to chase a leopard off the aviaries in response to the frantic
screams of the Canindes!
The du Venages breed macaws for two distinct purposes. On the
one hand there is the pet bird market, and this is most suitably met
by hand-rearing the macaws. More important, however, is the
production of breeding stocks for the future. In Gill du Venage&apos;s
experience parent-raised birds definitely mature physically more
rapidly than hand-raised ones and tend to get on better when it
comes to rearing their own offspring, initially at least. To say,
however, that hand-raised specimens will never breed is absolutely
incorrect. In this macaw breeding establishment it is the policy that
at least 50% of the birds bred should be parent-raised, and that the
birds selected to make up further breeding pairs for the future
should be drawn mainly from this group.
If the eggs from a first clutch are removed for artificial incuba-
tion, there is possibly a chance that the parents will re-cycle and
produce a second clutch quite quickly. This can sometimes be a
means of speeding up production, and is resorted to to a certain
extent e.g. to build up a stock of a particularly rare species initially.
In any case the specimens so produced make far better pet birds.
The du Venages now have four separate and elaborately appointed
rooms for hand-raising macaws: (1) an intensive care room in
which the eggs are incubated and the babies are fed two hourly in
their earliest stages, (2) a rearing room in which the babies are kept
on towels in plastic basins and are allowed to develop in groups, (3)
a brooder room in which the babies are kept on wire, but with a
heating pad in between two of the small all wire brooder cages so
that the baby can move close to the heat or away from it to suit itself
and (4) a weaning room in which the babies are kept in suspended
wire cages and gradually taught to eat and become independent.
Outside flights are attached to the weaning room so that at a still
later stage the babies may get used to outdoor conditions and
develop a greater power of flight.
Feeding the baby macaws is an extremely time consuming
occupation that must be attended to day and night. Accordingly
three competent persons, each one working an eight hour shift, have
to be involved. At first the baby macaws must be fed two hourly,
then three hourly, then four hourly and eventually the feeding can
be set at three times a day. The rate at which macaw babies mature
varies tremendously - the smaller the species the faster the rate of
development. Thus Hahn&apos;s Macaws are fully weaned at 3Vi months,
whereas young Hyacinth Macaws stay with their parents for eight-

een months and, therefore, this species breeds only every other year
in the natural state. In the efficiently run hand-rearing system
devised at &amp;quot;Macaw Glenn&amp;quot; the babies of different species are
constantly being moved around so that suitable groups of similarly
sized babies are kept together.
If the breeding of macaws is Gill&apos;s all-consuming hobby, Arthur
has been a very willing and supportive partner. He has organised
the building of the aviaries, the staff of eight people working full
time on the birds, and the purchase and growing of the food. It is
fortunate that a good deal of the macaws&apos; favourite foods can be
grown on the property. All the necessary vegetables are grown,
such as carrots, sweet potatoes and beetroot, and that great treat,
sunflower heads just at the ripening stage, can be supplied directly
from the farm.
The large ranges of macaw aviaries now extend right around the
homestead some being higher up the slope, and others running
lower down the valley. They are amid huge trees, which provide
some welcome shade during the hot summer days, and they are in
a natural and aesthetically pleasing setting. One of these rows of
aviaries is known as &amp;quot;the 44&amp;quot; from the number of flights in it, and
this is the block used to show the Macaws to any lucky visitors
during the non-breeding season from May to July. With her basket
of nuts to offer each and every bird a special treat of appeasement,
Gill leads the way. She approaches each aviary calling out &amp;quot;Hi
guys!&amp;quot; in exactly the same tone, which is obviously familiar to the
birds, and one by one they fly to the front of their aviary to receive
their titbit. By this procedure much of the birds&apos; natural fear of
strangers is eliminated. In this block of aviaries have been assem-
bled examples of all the macaws of the collection, species rather
similar in appearance being juxtaposed e.g. Caninde next to Blue-
and-yellow, Scarlet next to Green-winged etc. so that their differ-
ences are shown off to good effect. Geographical variations in
different species are also shown off e.g. the &amp;quot;Bolivian&amp;quot; Military
Macaw has a rich brown throat instead of the small black bib of the
other Military Macaws.
Because the range of macaws is now so very nearly complete it
is extremely impressive. Only the extreme rarities are missing -
Glaucous Anodorhynchusglaucis, Lear&apos;s or Indigo Anodorhynchus
leari , Spix&apos;s Cyanopsitta spixii and Blue-headed Ara couloni . As
the du Venages have successfully bred every species they have so
far managed to acquire, it is much to be hoped that they may yet be
given a chance to breed the others, notably the Spix&apos;s.

Unfortunately money is inevitably an aspect behind any great
endeavour, but the du Venages believe that only those persons to
whom birds are more important than the money can be really
successful breeders. The welfare of the birds must take priority,
and they try to assess the qualifications of buyers to keep birds
successfully before parting with their surplus birds. Such a collec-
tion must, however, generate money in order to be viable.
Mention must be made of two sidelines to the macaws run in this
great breeding establishment. Fifty pairs of African Grey Parrots
Psittacus erithacus erithacus are kept in suspended aviaries, and
their babies are mainly hand-reared for the pet market. The profits
from this enterprise are used to support the vast expenditure
necessary for obtaining and maintaining the macaws. Only the two
geographical variations of Psittacus erithacus erithacus , the larger
&amp;quot;Congo Grey&amp;quot; and the smaller &amp;quot;Ghana Grey&amp;quot;, are kept.
Finally, the du Venages are attempting to make a practical
contribution to the natural conservation of a local parrot, the
Meyer&apos;s Parrot Poicephalus meyeri because they firmly believe
that aviculturists must be seen to be part of the solution to bird
conservation, not part of the problem . Their valuable property lies
within the original natural habitat of the Meyer&apos;s Parrot, which is
currently causing concern because of its dwindling numbers, at any
rate in South Africa. In conjunction with our Department of Nature
Conservation it was decided that they should embark upon an
experimental programme of aviary breeding and release into the
wild with this threatened species. A total of eight pairs of Meyer&apos;s
Parrots were entrusted to them on permit. These birds were housed
in suspended aviaries of the type already being used successfully
for housing and breeding African Greys. Already their numbers
have increased to over thirty. Meyer&apos;s Parrots, like many other
parrotlike species, pair for life, and there is an extremely strong
pair bond between a breeding pair. The procedure is going to be
that while the hens are nesting the cocks are going to be allowed
their freedom to reconnoitre the area and become adept at foraging
in the wild. At a later stage the cocks are going to be kept back in
their aviaries while the hens are released to gain their bearings.
Eventually pairs are going to be released together and it is hoped
that they will for the main part remain on or near this vast property,
on which initially feeding stations will be set up. Hopefully they
will nest in the wild successfully and in due course Meyer&apos;s Parrots
will be re-established in the Magaliesberg, which was formerly the
southern boundary of their natural habitat.

NOTES ON THE BREEDING AND STATUS OF THE
RED SPOTTED LORIKEET

Since the article on the breeding of the Red Spotted Lorikeet
Charmosyna rubronotata appeared in the Avicultural Magazine
Vol. 97, No. 3, 1991 considerable progress has been made in the
U.K. with assembling information on the status of this rare and
beautiful little bird. Keepers and breeders of the smaller lorikeets
never fail to be captivated by the charm and vibrant colours of this
small bird which weighs only about 3 A oz. but is full of character and
vitality.
So far it has been possible to trace eight aviculturists who keep
this species. Not all of them have birds of breeding age and some
have had very mixed fortunes in the past with Red Spotted Lorikeets
but that is changing now that the needs of the species are better
known. It is understood that one partnership has imported privately
a very small number for new blood.
Those who have been successful with their breeding, including
my husband and I, have found these tiny birds to be model parents,
ever willing to rear their very lively young to maturity. However
certain aspects of their feeding, care and management need to be
emphasized in order that those who acquire these birds are not
disappointed with them.
NEST BOXES^ Such tiny birds are often given very small nest
boxes, 6&amp;quot; x 6" x 9&amp;quot; high (15 cm x 15 cm x 23 cm.) This is a mistake
for they need a box IVi &amp;quot; x IVi &amp;quot; x 12&amp;quot; high (19 cm x 19 cm x 30 cm).
They &amp;quot;drench&amp;quot; their boxes daily more than do most small lorikeets
when breeding. This means that the whole of the wood shavings
contents needs to be renewed daily , preferably in the evening, so
that the chicks and parents have a dry warm box in which to sleep.
The larger size box enables the chicks to get away from the wettest
parts of the box during the day. Many of these birds need to have
the nest material changed twice per week even though they are not
breeding. Failure to supply clean dry nesting material has, in the
past, discouraged some birds from going to nest and has also, in
some cases, been responsible for the loss of valuable chicks.
FEEDING: The members of the genus Charmosyna seem to
require more careful feeding than do many of the larger lories and
the tiny ones like rubronotata in particular are extremely prone to

very debilitating upsets due to incorrect feeding. We have found,
after many months of experimenting that our Red Spotted Lorikeets
cannot tolerate citrus fruits or bananas. Possibly the latter contain
too much potassium. Soya flour even in very small quantities
seemed to upset the birds, particularly the hens. The above foods
were left out after many trials carried out over a number of months.

rubronotata family are now kept in our kitchen in which the
temperature varies between about 60* F when the central heating is
off to about 80*F when cooking is taking place. Others are in our
dining room where the temperature varies between 65* F and 70* F.
None of them has the benefit of Trulite lighting but they do have
ordinary household lighting at night until 10 pm and starting again
at 6 am. They are first generation birds bred by ourselves and others
and are proving much hardier than the original wild caught parents.
It is possible that future generations will prove hardy enough to
thrive in a temperature not exceeding 65* F but the existing birds
do need to &amp;quot;warm up&amp;quot; at night with rather higher temperatures.
All our C. rubronotata are given little twigs of willow or sweet
apple without leaves but with the buds. They eat the buds first and
then strip and eat most of the bark. They are extremely fond of
flowers, of which they are given a regular supply for about eight
months of the year and, of course, green food, lettuce or the green
part of endive.
Caution is necessary with flowers for many are toxic, such as
Rhododendron, of which every part is poisonous. Flowers which
are safe to give to the birds and are greatly liked include wallflow-
ers, forget-me-nots, pansies, roses, wild honeysuckle (evergreen
garden kinds are poisonous), white bedding alyssum, small bedding
begonias, impatiens (busy Lizzies) and fuchsias. The birds show a
marked preference for light coloured fuchsia flowers.
Parents are very tolerant of their young but they need to be taken
away if the hen shows signs of wanting to go back to nest because,
if this is not done, the next clutch of eggs may prove to be infertile.
We understand that on the continent of Europe three and sometimes
four eggs are laid at a time. On one occasion this year (1992) our
original wild caught hen laid three eggs, and she and the cock
successfully reared three fine birds, two hens and one cock.
We now have four pairs of which two are of breeding age. These
have bred and reared 10 birds this year. One of the young birds, a
cock, is a second generation of our stock and is a bird of quite
brilliant colour showing dull red on the cheeks. It remains to be
seen whether this moults out as the bird reaches maturity.
Three other members of the Avicultural Society are keeping
Charmosyna rubronotata. One of them recently acquired fresh
blood from the continent of Europe. Another has bred from our
stock. His remarkable achievement in hand rearing two tiny chicks
from the age of about one week to near maturity deserves very
special mention. It is hazardous enough transferring these minute

nesting material is replaced and then putting them back in the box
but to feed these tiny scraps of life many times a day (and night) for
about seven weeks deserves special acknowledgements for dedica-

Including our own breedings, the above mentioned and those of
another breeder we think the total number reared this year (1992)
is about eighteen but it could be more. Considering that only a few
pairs were brought into the country in the first place this seems to
be a very promising start for the establishment of healthy strains of
these beautiful and charming little birds whose characters endear
them so much to their owners.

THE NORTH AMERICAN RUDDY DUCK IN EUROPE
- A THREAT TO THE WHITE-HEADED DUCK
By Nigel Hewston (Avicultural Coordinator, The Wildfowl

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9920968" page_id="56294210"  page_num="122" year="" vol="">
The North American Ruddy Duck Oxyura j. jamaicensis is well-
known and popular among aviculturists and the madly bubbling
blue-billed males are a feature of many collections. The Ruddy
Duck is also now well-known to birdwatchers not just in America
but also in Britain and increasingly elsewhere in Europe. The
Ruddy Duck first bred in captivity in Britain at The Wildfowl &amp;
Wetlands Trust (then Severn Wildfowl Trust) Centre at Slimbridge
in 1949. A number of young were parent-reared in the early years
because of problems in hand-rearing and were subsequently left
full-winged. Young were first reared successfully in 1950 and the
first escapes occurred in 1952. Since then there has been a dramatic
increase in the British population. The first breeding of feral birds
was recorded in 1960, and the National Wildfowl Counts now show
some 3,500 birds. The first record for continental Europe was in
Sweden in 1965, since when the Ruddy Duck has been reported
from at least 13 European countries (including Britain) from
Iceland to Italy. Most records are from France, though the rela-
tively few breeding reports also include Holland and Iceland. A
study on the ecology and behaviour of the Ruddy Duck in Britain,
including its interactions with other species, is nearing completion
at The Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust. This has shown no serious
competition with native waterfowl at the present population level
but in Southern Europe this is certainly not the case.
The White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala is another popu-
lar avicultural subject, though less numerous in collections than the
Ruddy Duck. It is also Europe&apos;s only naturally occurring stifftail,
and in global terms the rarest and most threatened of the stifftails.
The only population in western Europe is found in Spain and its
existence in recent times has depended heavily on habitat conser-
vation measures and reintroduction programmes in Andalucia. The
success of these measures is reflected in the increase in peak counts
in Spain from 22 in 1977 to 700 in 1992. Reintroduction has also
been attempted in Hungary and proposed in Italy, and much progress
has been made recently in habitat protection in Turkey.

now leached Spain. Between December 1989 and July 1991 there
were 29 records of Ruddy Ducks from ten wetlands in the main
Andalucian breeding areas of the White-headed Duck. The simi-
larity of the two species will undoubtedly lead to serious compe-
tition. Studies in Spain have already shown Ruddy Ducks to be
dominant over other waterfowl species. Another serious and more
insidious threat is hybridisation. Hybrids between wild Ruddy
Ducks and captive White-headed Ducks first appeared in Britain,
and more recently hybrids have been recorded in Spain, where it has
been found that both male Ruddy Ducks and male hybrids are
dominant over male White-headed Ducks during courtship. Test
matings at Slimbridge have confirmed that hybrids are fertile when
paired to White-headed Ducks, all of which means that the Ruddy
Duck is now probably the most serious threat to the survival of the
White-headed Duck in Spain and in the longer term elsewhere in its
range if the Ruddy Duck continues to spread.
My main purpose in informing aviculturists of this situation is
to discourage further releases and escapes, and this message has
now gone out to European waterfowl breeders with the help of
Aviornis, the British Waterfowl Association and the International
Wild Waterfowl Association. The Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust
obviously feels a special responsibility for solving this problem as
the first escapes were from Slimbridge. It is often assumed that the
whole European population is derived entirely from these birds but
it is known that escapes have occurred from other collections in
Britain and, in view of the number of escapes and releases of other
species from wildfowl collections, it is very likely that there have
also been escapes elsewhere in Europe. Young stifftails from
missed nests can be difficult to catch and Ruddy Ducks are of
course charming birds to have flying around a collection, so it
would not be surprising if escapes and releases had been wide-
spread. All European breeders now need to be particularly vigilant
regarding Ruddy Ducks in their collections, and should also exer-
cise care when supplying Ruddy Ducks to others. Discussions are
underway in Britain, in Spain and on a pan-European scale which
are aimed at finding the right management methods to control and
reverse the spread of the Ruddy Duck in Europe. This will be
extremely difficult and may not even be possible, but responsible
action by aviculturists can help to safeguard the future of the
White headed Duck.

By Alan Brock (Molesey, Surrey).
I obtained a pair of acclimatised Fairy Bluebirds Irena puella in
the autumn of 1990. They were housed in a planted aviary
approximately 10&apos; (3 m) x 10&apos; x 8' (2.4 m) high. The rear half of
the roof is covered and the ends are close boarded. Feeding was
carried out via a box 36&amp;quot; (0.9 m) x 12&amp;quot; (0.3 m) x 18&amp;quot; (0.45 m) high,
set approximately 4&apos; (1.2 m) from ground level on the back wall. A
small door gives access to the feeding station from outside the
aviary and there is a landing board/door on the inside by which the
birds enter. This box, which can be heated during cold weather,
enables the birds to be fed without entering the aviary. The system
is used in all the aviaries in the garden and is an invaluable asset
where space to provide full sized shelters is unavailable. The
aviary is planted with two small conifers, a climbing rose on a
trellis set on the borderline between the covered and uncovered
roof area, and a variety of flowers and small shrubs chosen to attract
winged insects into the flight. The trellis also covers the entrance
to the feeding box and the perching area high at the rear of the flight
where the birds roost. About a month after I obtained the pair the
hen was found one morning on the aviary floor with a badly injured
leg and despite veterinary care it died on the same day. The cause
of the injury was a mystery and the vet&apos;s opinion was that either it
had been attacked by the cock bird or by some predator such as a
rat or weasel. However no traces of such animals could be found
and the cock bird seemed the most likely culprit. In the spring of
1991 I was lucky enough to hear of a birdkeeper who had purchased
a pair, lost the cock bird and wanted to dispose of the hen. It was
in good condition and was duly brought home and carefully intro-
duced to the cock bird using a cage placed in the aviary. After three
days she was released, and they settled down together fairly
amicably.
A variety of nest sites was provided. They consisted of small
wooden platforms approximately 6&amp;quot; square which were placed at
heights between four and six feet from floor level and were
provided with fronds of conifer branches for cover. I had known of
Fairy Bluebirds nesting on these platforms successfully in other
breeders&apos; aviaries, although there were problems in that the untidy
pile of dead vegetation that passes for a nest with the species seems

to provide little protection for the eggs, and I had never heard of a
successful hatching. However an American zoo had considerable
success with this species by providing nest baskets ten inches in
diameter and eight inches deep, filled with dried grasses. These
were duly installed together with some others of the same diameter
but only two inches deep. They were filled with hay. The pair were
left to their own devices but they made no attempt to nest during the
summer of 1991. They went through the moult in September 1991
and survived the winter without mishap.
This species is frequently an early nester, sometimes producing
eggs in March. In early April the hen began nesting inside the
feeding shelter, ignoring all nest baskets and platforms. The
materials used were dried, dead leaves and broken stems, holding
the empty seed heads from the previous year&apos;s flowering plants,
which were arranged in untidy heaps. On 8th April an egg was laid
and promptly broken since the nest was totally inadequate to
protect it when the cock bird flew in and out to feed. The shell was
a dull blue/green, covered with brown specks, and the egg itself was
curiously elongated in appearance, not of a regular oval shape, and
about an inch (25 mm) long. Irritatingly, the hen began to nest in
the same spot again and to avoid further breakage of eggs a nest
basket 10&amp;quot; (25 cm) in diameter and 2&amp;quot; (5 cm) deep was fixed onto
the floor of the feeding box on the site of the first nest and filled
with chopped hay. The hen entered this almost immediately and
proceeded to use her body to hollow out a cup shape in the hay
which she lined with the sort of dead vegetation used in the first
nesting. She began to sit in the nest but left it and flew out of the
box whenever food was put inside. Feeding was therefore reduced
to once daily and on 20th April she did not budge when the food pots
were changed. Later, when she left the nest, it was swiftly
inspected and found to contain one egg. The hen sat tight and the
nest was not examined again until 26th April when there were two
eggs. She was allowed to sit undisturbed until 8th May when both
eggs were removed and found to be clear. The hen laid an egg on
11th May and another was found on examining the nest two days
later but these too were clear and were removed. The hen then
nested in a similar basket fixed against the back panel of the aviary,
less than two feet from the feeding box and the only cover provided
was the rambling rose, on its trellis, three feet away. A number of
&amp;quot;spy-holes&amp;quot; were carefully bored through the solid section of the
aviary, through which the nest could be observed easily.
Regrettably this was the period when my wife and I were on

holiday and our collection was left in the care of a friend. He
experienced no problems but when we returned on 13th June the
nest contained another two clear eggs and the hen was back in the
food hatch, sitting on two more. Having observed the pair mating
during May, I thought that one of them might be infertile but on
18th June a chick hatched. The hen was provided with a variety of
livefood and was seen catching flies and picking out small inver-
tebrates from the leafmould with which I had mulched the aviary
floor the previous autumn. On 20th June the hen was heard calling
repeatedly in the early afternoon and was off the nest. The chick
was dead. A post mortem examination revealed food in its belly and
the cause of death remains a mystery. On 28th June, the hen
returned to the second nest basket, which she had used, in the
outside flight, and began relining it. She sat on and off during the
next few days and an egg was found in the nest on 4th July, the only
egg to be laid in this clutch. It hatched on 15th July.
The chick progressed well but it was difficult to establish
exactly on what it was being fed. The cock appeared to be not
interested in feeding it. Mealworms and cleaned maggots were
provided but the hen seemed to be feeding only flies and small
invertebrates, in tiny quantities at intervals of sometimes up to an
hour. An artificial nectar, made up according to a formula given to
me by a lorikeet breeder, was provided and this was taken eagerly
by both adult birds but the hen was not seen to feed it to the chick.
It was not until the chick&apos;s eyes opened on 23rd July that any
significant increase in the amount of food consumed was noted. At
this stage the hen was seen feeding it mealworm pupae and freshly
hatched white mealworm beetles, but the mainstay of the diet
consisted of bluebottle flies, greenbottle and house flies that the
hen caught on the wing. Quantities were trapped and imported into
the aviary from the garden. Grasshoppers and crickets were taken
but waxmoth larvae were ignored. From this time onwards the hen
spent much less time brooding the chick.
The chick left the nest on the evening of 28th July and was fed
by the hen, apparently exclusively on livefood, until 3rd August,
when there were signs of fruit particles and sticky juice around the
youngster&apos;s bill, indicating that it was feeding from the fruit dish
and possibly the nectar pot. However, it was not until 16th August
that the chick was observed sitting on the edge of the aviary
birdbath and drinking. On 25th August it was seen drinking nectar.
The chick was finally separated from its parents on 31st August, by
which time it was feeding itself adequately. It is now (October

We have several colonies of Mynahs on display in our larger
planted aviaries here at Mitchell Park. These include 3 - 4 pairs
each of Black-collared Mynahs, Jungle Mynahs and Crested
Mynahs, all of which breed, although the very attractive Black-
collared specimen has so far not reared its young. The latter builds
a large untidy domed nest while all of the others use a Cockatiel
built-type nest box. This collection makes a noisy, lively, active,
exhibit and is housed with a variety of full-winged water fowl
including Hottentot Teal, Ringed Teal, Green-winged Teal and
blond and cinnamon Carolina Ducks, various pigeons and doves
including Nicobar and Pied Imperial Fruit Pigeons and a trio of
Blue-eared Pheasants.

In another smaller planted aviary we have a collection of doves,
Black Crake, Hartlaub Ducks, Pagoda Mynahs and three pairs of
Andaman Island Mynahs Sternns malabaricus andamanensis . These
remind me of a smaller edition of the Rothschild's Grackle without
the crest. They are Jungle Mynah size, all white with yellow cere
and beak and whitish legs. They are grey on the upper back leading
to black flight feathers and tail, with white tips to the tail feathers.
I have kept odd pairs of this species before but have always
found them to be extremely wild. One pair which we kept with a
trio of Jungle Mynahs were killed by the latter, when the Jungle
Mynahs went to nest, even though they were in a very large planted
aviary. When we obtained four hens and two cocks, newly imported
over six years ago, they appeared entirely different in character
from the original pair. They were steady and tame from the
beginning and have remained so. They divided the planted aviary
into territories. We placed a wooden Cockatiel type nest box in
each territory and filled it with dead plant stems, leaves, feathers
etc. When nesting the birds shoot in and out of their nest boxes and
so it is very difficult to anticipate what is happening without
regular checks and this I prefer not to do. The young are very noisy
when being fed and one can judge progress this way. On the
occasions when we have checked we have found 3 - 4 greenish-blue
eggs. Generally the birds rear 2-3 young in a nest. The young are
a smaller edition of their parents but with a creamy wash over their
white body and a greyish wash over the wings.
Their diet was minced ox heart with a soft-bill mixture, a few
meal-worms, flying ants and a small amount of chopped up fruit. It
is advisable to remove the young when they are independent at
approximately 10 days old for they are harassed by other pairs in a
confined area and then start a new colony.

THE BLUE-BREASTED PARROT FINCH

By W. H. Keijzer (Utrecht).
The Blue-breasted Parrot Finch Erythrura tricolor , which is
also known as the Tanimbar or Tri-coloured Parrot Finch, is one of
the smallest of its genus and is about 4&amp;quot; (10 cm) long. It inhabits
Timor and some of the smaller surrounding islands including
Tanimbar, Wetar and Roma. Not much is known about it in the wild
and, until recently, it was completely unknown to aviculture. It
lives in dark forest undergrowth which explains why the species has
developed such big eyes. It comes to the edges of the forests,
clearings and bamboo thickets to search for the various grass and
bamboo seeds on which it feeds.
The species exhibits marked sexual dimorphism. The males
have the forehead, face, throat and breast deep blue. The crown,
cheeks, sides of the neck, lower breast and belly are lighter blue.
The upperparts are moss green, the rump, uppertail coverts and tail
are bright red and the flanks and undertail coverts are green. The
large eyes are brown, the bill is black and the legs and feet are flesh
coloured. The adult females differ from the male in having the head
and chest turquoise blue changing to green. They are bluish grey
on the breast and abdomen. There are no sub-species.
At the end of 1989 a well-known dealer had a few Tanimbar
Parrot Finches for sale but his price was high and, since I knew
nothing about their requirements, I did not buy them. I was angry
with myself later because they are robust birds which are not
difficult to keep. They were sold to another breeder in Holland in
whose collection they bred very well and from whom I obtained
several unrelated young birds.
They were placed in a cage lmxlmxlm where they chose
their mates and within a day pairs were sitting together. Three pairs
were selected for breeding and were accommodated in individual
cages 1 m x 40 cm x 40 cm. They were provided with half open finch
nest boxes and coconut fibre. Within three days one of the pairs had
filled its box with fibre to make a large round nest with a small
entrance hole. Most of the nest building was done by the male with
a little help from the female. I never saw the male display to the
female but I saw them copulating, the cock gripping the female by
the neck with his bill. Five eggs, which were white and very large
for such a little bird, were laid. The birds were provided with a
good tropical finch mixture of seeds, grass seeds, millet sprays,

minerals, grit and egg food which they appeared to like very much
but which, as I learned later, tends to make them fat very rapidly.
(This seems to produce no problems with the hens when they are
laying eggs but it does with the cocks for they fail to fertilise them!)
Four of the eggs hatched after being incubated for 13 days. The
chicks were well fed by the parents, mainly on the egg food to which
I added live food in the form of chopped mealworms, buffalo worms
and ants&apos; eggs. All went well until the third day when the young-
sters were thrown out of the nest and I found them dead on the floor.
Another breeder had the same experience and we concluded that
they had been thrown out by the males because, with all the food
supplied in captivity, they have nothing much to do whereas, in the
wild, they have to search for its. The second pair laid four eggs. I
placed them under Bengalese which reared three chicks. The third
paid did nothing.
In the meantime the first pair were given a new nest box in which
they commenced immediately to build another nest. After two
weeks the hen had laid six eggs four of which hatched after
incubation for 13 days. On this occasion I took the advice of
another breeder who had had the same experience with males
throwing out their chicks, and removed the male. All the chicks
were reared by the hen alone and they left the nest when they were
17 days old. At first they returned to the nest in the evenings.
It was not difficult to determine the sex of the youngsters
because the young cocks were bluish grey and the females brown-
ish grey. Their upper mandibles were black and their lower
mandibles were yellow. They moulted into adult plumage whey
they were about three months old and their bills became completely
black.
The young males were soon anxious to breed and so I separated
them from the females. Later I was able to obtain several more of
this species from a collector in Timor with the co-operation of an
Indonesian dealer who also sent me a few Papuan Parrot Finches E.
papuana. The wild caught Blue-breasted Parrot Finches were very
nervous at first but they quickly settled down and became tame in
cages 1 m long. Now that I have plenty of fresh blood there should
be no difficulty in establishing a captive bred strain in Europe.

Helping behaviour, specifically the care and feeding of nest-
lings by birds other than their genetic parents, has been documented
in many species of birds by a number of researchers (Brown 1987,
Skutch 1987). In the order Cuculiformes, cuckoos eg Guira guira
(Davis 1940) and anis eg Crotophaga sulcirostris (Vehrencamp
1978) in the family Cuculidae, and hoatzins Opisthocomus hoazin
(Strahl 1985) in the family Opisthocomidae have been shown to
live in groups and breed cooperatively. Very little is known of the
breeding systems within the remaining family in the order, the
Musophagidae (but see Candy 1984 and the Appendix in Grimes
1976).
Turacos (family Musophagidae) are confined exclusively to
Africa south of the Sahara. The Violet Turaco Musopliaga violacea
is found in western Africa from Gambia to Nigeria, where it resides
in gallery forests and fringing forests along stream banks (Fry et al.
1988). No mention of the incubation period or description of
nesting activity could be found in the literature.
Brookfield Zoo (Chicago Zoological Society) has maintained
Violet Turacos off and on during the past fifty years. Serious
attempts to breed this species were not made until 1984, when a pair
was moved into a large mixed-species exhibit containing primates,
other mammals and various bird species. During an eleven month
period this pair produced five clutches (three clutches of two, two
clutches of one) resulting in eight chicks. All chicks were removed
from the nest and hand-reared from roughly day 14 onwards as the
exhibit they occupied was not considered safe for fledglings (Bent
1988).
The mated pair was removed from the large exhibit in 1985 after
they became erratic in their nesting attempts and transferred to a
large flight cage containing around twelve other bird species. After
a period of nine months, they laid and tended an infertile clutch of
two eggs. Three months after this clutch was removed, a second
infertile clutch of one egg was laid. Four months later, a third
infertile clutch of one was removed. Finally three months later

(19 months after the pair was introduced to the exhibit), the fourth
clutch of two was hatched and raised successfully by the parent
birds. In all cases, both adult birds incubated for the entire 23 day
incubation period. In the last case both adults brooded and fed the
chicks, and both removed faecal sacs.
The Violet Turaco chicks hatched asynchronously. They also
fledged asynchronously, the older chick leaving the nest at roughly
18 days of age and the younger following two days later. The male
bird accompanied the older chick as it explored the region around
the nest while the female remained in the nest with the younger
chick. After the second chick fledged the chicks were attended by
both parents. The chicks left the nest and ran through nearby tree
branches for days before they tried flying for the first time at
roughly one month old.
Forty days after the first chick hatched the female started
another clutch in the same nest. We had noted a similar quick
turnaround (38 - 62 days) when the birds were in their original
exhibit, but had attributed it at the time to replacement clutching
after the &amp;quot;predation&amp;quot; of the chicks (their removal for hand-rearing).
From day 1 of incubation of the second clutch one of the juveniles
was often observed on the nest with the female. The other juvenile
had broken its leg soon after the female laid and was removed for
treatment. Otherwise it too might have stayed with the female.
The remaining juvenile continued to sit with the female during
the entire incubation period. When it was not on the nest it
remained close, sitting quietly on branches near the nest. The
juvenile also brooded the chicks after they hatched, always in
conjunction with the female. It was never seen to incubate or brood
alone, and only rarely with the male.
When the nest was checked for the first time the juvenile flew
off and the female defended the nest on her own. From then on, the
juvenile always joined the female in attacking the keepers who
were disturbing the nest. Although in the past the male had always
joined his mate in defending the nest against the keepers, he now
remained at a distance. The male did join the female in chasing
other birds from the nest area.
The brood consisted of three chicks, the first time this has been
recorded in this species. Mackworth-Praed (1970) described two
Violet Turaco nests, each with two eggs. Clutch sizes for other
turaco species are reported to be one to four, with most species
laying a clutch of two (Fry et al. 1988). The three chicks developed
normally. Their weight gains and feather development were no

different from previous broods of one or two.
As the chicks grew the older juvenile remained attentive. Turaco
chicks are fed by regurgitation, and though the juvenile was never
actually observed feeding the chicks it made frequent visits to the
nest immediately after eating. The first day the injured juvenile
was returned to the exhibit its sibling and mother attacked it
whenever it came near the nest, though the male immediately
accepted it. A day later the two older chicks had fledged from the
nest (at 21 and 20 days old), and both juvenile helpers were
attending them as well as the younger chick in the nest.
After all three chicks fledged both juveniles were with them
constantly. They appeared to shepherd the chicks around the
exhibit and consequently the chicks were seen exploring the exhibit
much earlier than their older siblings had previously. The juveniles
stayed with them on their first flights and escorted them back to the
nest area.
The female began to lay again 35 days after the first chick
hatched, the shortest interval found between broods. The eggs were
pierced and returned to the nest to slow reproduction and give the
breeding pair a rest. Both juveniles continued to care for the chicks
and were not seen incubating with the female. The male also
attended the chicks when he was not on the nest. The chicks were
observed begging from and being fed by the juveniles when they
were 24 days old and the juveniles were 116 days old. This
behaviour coincided with the change in colour of the juveniles'
bills from their fledgling white with black marks to the orange and
yellow of adulthood. The family continued to stay together with no
apparent aggression, even after the female abandoned her clutch
thirty days after the eggs were pierced.
In the wild, Violet Turacos are reported to occur in ''pairs or
small parties&amp;quot; (Chaplin 1978, Fry et al. 1988). The small parties
may be parents with their offspring, as we have found that our
turaco pairs will not tolerate the presence of any unrelated birds.
The birds continued to live together with no aggression even after
the chicks had all moulted into adult plumage at approximately 4
months, until the family was broken up by sending the offspring to
other zoos.
It is difficult to observe the behaviour of birds such as Violet
Turacos that live in dense rainforests. The contributions that zoos
can make by observing birds in captivity can greatly add to our
knowledge of these little-known species.

The eight or so species of Solitaires are found in upland areas,
with one species in the Rockies, one in the Andes, and the rest in
Central America and the Caribbean. They are all very similar,
garbed in dull greys and browns. These approximately 7&amp;quot; (15.5 cm)
37 g birds look and behave like flycatchers, perching bolt upright
for long periods looking for insects, which they snap up with their
weak little bills, often with much clacking. All are notable and
persistent songsters, a fact attested to by their common names,
which include &apos;Mountain Whistler&apos;, &apos;Musican Bird&apos;, &apos;Bugler&apos; (Clarin,
Clarino), &amp;quot;Linnet&apos; (Jilguero) and &apos;Common Linnet&apos;. These names
may be given indiscriminately to several species and the latter
three, along with &apos;Guardian of the Cliff&apos;, have all been applied to the
Brown-backed Solitaire Myadestes obscurus.
M. obscurus ranges from the north of Mexico to Honduras and
its habitat is described as &apos;fairly dense mountain forest&apos;. Like the
other Solitaires, its habits are a bit strange and the males at least
appear to be fearless. The cock of my pair was a delightful bird and
spent most of the breeding season sitting singing on the 4&apos; (1.2 m)
high feeding tray and often did not move until I was within 2&apos; (60
cm). The cock and chicks tolerated a camera at less than a yard
(metre). The male chicks became quite steady like the father. The
hen was a bit more wary, but the pair often took a bath while I was
hosing the aviary. Myadestes are infrequent bathers, taking one
bath a week at most.
Their breeding was the most minutely observed of any because
of the set-up, and it proved to be a real cliffhanger for me and
probably for the birds too. They had three failed attempts but by
the fourth successive try they were functioning like a well-oiled
machine.
Central to all observations was the design and placement of the
aviary. This is built into an L- shaped corner of the house and
measures a slightly irregular 16&apos; x 12&apos; (4.8 m x 3.6 m). It is fully
roofed, enclosed on three sides and open to the south. Even then,
part of this structure is enclosed by rigid acrylic, and plastic
sheeting on wooden frames was made to fit all the open wire and is
now kept permanently in place on the lower 4&apos; (1.2 m) half of the
open side. This made it in effect a cold greenhouse and has enabled

two amazingly hardy tropical fruits, Passion vine P. edulis and
Feijoa F. sellowiana , to survive. However, this aviary is designed
not to be viewed from the garden but from inside the house. A large
kitchen window takes up most of one end, providing a view of 95%
of the area. A feeding table was placed close to the window and a
water dish was set beneath a tap on the ground just below. In
addition, a small bathroom window is located halfway along the
adjacent wall. From a seat at the kitchen table, the birds were
observed in great detail. For the final, successful nesting, an open-
fronted cardboard box was placed on the wall opposite the big
window in such a position that the inside could be seen easily with
binoculars. All details of brooding and feeding behaviour were
thus noted.
The adults, in good condition save for some badly frayed
feathers, were obtained in late February just when I returned from
Britain. As the birds were almost at the pairing-up stage, I had no
time to do anything but put them straight out in the aviary. Usually
there is little chance of breeding unacclimated birds obtained so
late. As is the usual policy, I worked in the aviary as much as
possible so that the birds became used to my presence. With the
Myadestes , this took about a week only.
The frayed tail of the hen proved useful in identifying the birds
at a distance. The hen had just come into breeding condition and
she actively solicited attention. However, the cock chased her off.
The next morning she was nowhere to be seen and a hurried search
located her hungry and slightly injured on the ground, hiding
beneath some large calla lily leaves. There was blood on the inside
of one wing but the injury was superficial and within an hour she
was jumping around in a small cage.
Thereafter followed the most nerve-racking month I have ever
experienced in bird keeping. The cock and hen were alternated
daily in a small cage placed on a stepladder inside the aviary. When
the hen was out, she ran up and down on the roof of the cage,
bobbing her tail seductively. The cock has fine little X A&amp;quot; (7 mm)
white plumules hidden at the &apos;shoulder* of his wing (like the blue
epaulettes of the Chloropsis or the orange spot on the European
Robin&apos;s wing) which he sticks out and vibrates if excited or, more
usually, if annoyed and threatening a rival. When the cock was out,
he rammed the polypropylene netting and bristled his white flashes
while attempting to drive off the hen. At other times he sat
pensively on top of the cage for an hour. Both birds raised the
feathers on the back of the head when confronting one another.

Another male was put out in a little cage as a distraction but this
only drove the resident male into a greater rage as he tried to get at
both birds. The cocks flashed white at each other until the caged
male was removed.
Finally after nearly four weeks and several unsuccessful at-
tempts at putting them together, the cock chased the hen for only
a few minutes, but did not follow up. They reached an armed truce
in which the hen threatened the cock with wide open beak if he came
too near. She rather pathetically alternated this with bobbing and
calling to the male, to which he paid not the least attention.
While all this was going on, the male in the house had been
singing at full blast. Then, towards the end of March, the aviary
male began to sing at half volume and suddenly began to feed the
hen. His tail had still been growing - it was about Vi&amp;quot; (13 mm) short
initially, - but had now reached its full length. The inside male was
put out again in a cage and was immediately attacked by the hen this
time! On 10th April, the hen began to pick up odd bits of nesting
material.
Their favourite diet seemed to be soft-bodied insects. They
hawked the smallest midges and were equally delighted if they
caught a large moth. These were eaten at high speed. The birds
soon settled on a diet of bread, spread with peanut butter and
margarine, and later ate substantial quantities of elderberries and
blueberries. Also favoured were yew and one species of cotoneaster.
Berries had to be small, soft and smooth and Rubus spp. (raspber-
ries etc.) were eaten only occasionally and in small quantities.
Soaked currants, and less often chopped grapes, were given daily
when berries were not available. They even began to eat some
powdered dogfood but refused to eat mealworms until they were
raising chicks. The cock also ate maggots and a few very small
earthworms but the hen would not look at these. Both took
blowflies.
A peculiar item in their diet was flower petals. They were seen
to pick large white Camellia petals, hang them around for a while,
and finally swallow them. They did the same with Feijoa flowers
and sometimes with tender Feijoa shoots. The hen ate these much
more often than the cock. Later, a variety of flowers was offered
but no interest was shown. They pecked only at white flowers and
these had to have thick fleshy petals before they were eaten. I
tasted both Camellia and Feijoa petals and they were faintly
perfumed, juicy and slightly sweet. The other male was seen to eat
lavender rhododendron petals of the probably poisonous variety

&apos;Blue Peter&apos;.
When the chicks were two months old, they began to pick at
shoots both new and withered and at one point one had a dried stem
sticking from its beak. It was long, hard and inflexible and could
neither be swallowed not regurgitated. The bird was caught up and
the stem pulled out. It broke off somewhere down the gullet but
within the hour the bird was fine. The preferred method of drinking
was to hover under the roof and sip up drops of water which had
condensed there.
There is no sexual difference in the plumage of these brown-
backed, grey-fronted birds. The white feathers on the cock&apos;s wing
were thought to be a sex difference until the hen rather coyly stuck
smaller ones out from one wing - the only time she ever did so.
Most of the time, and for most of the year, these signals remain
hidden. The birds have a well-defined white eye ring which
enhances the size of the eyes and makes them more attractive. The
hen&apos;s ring was very slightly thicker, but this may just have been an
individual difference. *In spite of there being a weight difference
of only half a gram between them, the cock being 35.1 and the hen
34.6 when newly acquired, the latter looked daintier in the head and
feet. These weights were on the light side, for when the birds were
all ready to migrate in October, one chick weighed 38.7 grams. The
chicks&apos; plumage was unlike that of the parents, being rufous-
spotted brown like fledgeling thrushes or &apos;robins&apos;. By three weeks
of age one showed a light and the other a dark phase, the difference
being in the brown colour, but in spite of this both turned out to be
males.
The cock sang steadily for the five month nesting season, only
becoming relatively quiet for two days on either side of hatching.
The song lasted 14 seconds, dropping to 9 or 10 as he began to wind
down late in the season. It is quite loud, very fast, extremely
complicated, high-pitched and impossible to describe. Both birds
have a loudish note which they use to keep in touch when out of
sight of each other. Very quiet chirps are used when they are close,
including a prolonged, high, thin call. The hen is generally quiet
and uses only these contact notes. The chicks gave a tiny single
peep in the nest. This could scarcely be heard outside the box.
When they had fledged, but were still being fed, they uttered a
quiet, continuous churring. All the sounds made by these birds
were high-pitched with a tendency to be &apos;tinny&apos;. At two months, one
chick began to warble quietly in competition with the adult male,
which started to sing again before he had finished moulting. It

could not be ascertained if this was the light or the dark chick, as
it always sang from cover. The male sang a prolonged subsong at
this time, only giving a quiet burst of his normal song a couple of
times in the month (September). However, a month later the other
chick began to sing as well, all in the same aviary. The chicks were
not whistling the territorial song, but their warbling was long and
fast.
As noted, the hen was ready to mate first, and she slowly raised
and lowered her tail, all the while calling softly to the male.
Finally, he began to feed her. Sometimes he just picked food from
the dish and gave it to the waiting hen. At other times, he would
swallow it, fly to his mate and regurgitate the food into her beak.
Compared with some other birds, he fed her very sparingly. Be-
tween feedings, the cock would sidle up and side-swipe the hen two
or three times, after which they would press close together. One
day the hen was seen sitting on the ground while the cock hopped
round her in a small anticlockwise circle, stopping each time
around to &apos;kiss&apos; her under the chin. At every fourth
circumambulation, mating took place. Later, they mated frequent-
ly without ceremony, even as late as when the chicks left the last
nest, and just when they had commenced to moult. Once the pair-
bond had been established, the birds spent a lot of time rapidly
quivering loosely held wings, and making a barely audible long,
high screech to each other.
Myadestes are practically unknown in aviculture and the only
information gleaned was from field guides, which suggested that
nests were built amongst rocks or under banks, so various sites were
made available from the ground up. A cardboard box was quickly
selected by the pair (three were on offer). This measured 9&amp;quot; (23 cm)
by 8&amp;quot; (20 cm) by 7.5&amp;quot; (19 cm) high, and with the top half of the front
(8&amp;quot; side) cutaway. The floor area was 72 sq. in (460 sq. cm). It
was fixed to a wall at a height of 6.5&apos; (2 m) and a short stepladder
was placed underneath. A different box was used for each nesting,
all about the same size and of the &apos;half-open&apos; type, with slightly
different entrance designs. The fourth and only successful nest was
placed directly opposite the window. This box was lowered a foot
(30 cm) from the original height (see above) so that the inside could
be seen more easily. The last nest was built on top of the second
nest. The nest was constructed by the hen, although the cock early
on had carried a strand or two of grass while checking out the sites.
At the early stage of building, when very little material was in
place, he frequently inspected the box and a loud scrabbling or

drumming sound was heard when he was inside. It was thought that
this might be some sort of courtship signal (like the Flickers do in
the garden), but later an identical sound was heard from the other
aviary when a hen Blackbird ( T . merula) began to construct a nest
in a similar cardboard box. A wide variety of nesting materials was
made available, but the hen spread only a layer of dry leaves
(mostly hollyhock) in the box, then filled it to a depth of 3&amp;quot; (90 mm)
with old dry pine needles. A cup of pine needles was made at an
inside corner. The nest cup was 3&amp;quot; (87 mm) in diameter and 2&amp;quot; (58
mm) deep. No lining of any kind was used in two of the nests, while
the other two had a few coarse, stiff grass stems added to the cup.
The cock visited the nest only at the beginning, then when it was
completed he decorated it with one or two freshly plucked green
leaves. He did not incubate the eggs or brood the young.
The eggs are whitish and completely covered with fine, light
reddish markings which form a thick ring at the big end. Eggs are
laid on successive days. The first was laid on the 24th April and the
last on the 7th July. Clutches of three, four, two and three were
produced and all were fertile except for the first egg, which
weighed 4.5 g and measured 24 x 19 mm. Incubation began with
the second egg. The cock never fed the hen on the nest. In the first
nest, the sole chick took 14 days to hatch, one egg being infertile
and the other dead at about five days. The young of each of the
subsequent clutches emerged on the same day, the second lot taking
15, 14, 13 and 12 days and the third 14 and 13. The last clutch took
14, 13 and 12 days to hatch. The hen was a steady sitter and got off
the clutch only when the box was banged, so that I could go up the
stepladder and look in at her. From the nest, she could see me when
I entered the aviary. The eggs were examined twice a day.
The nestlings were checked at least three times daily, although
I was in the aviary much more frequently. They were the usual
pink-tinged grey and covered with dark grey down. They had
white-rimmed gapes and about a week later the inside of the mouth
turned gold. During the first three nesting attempts, there was still
some tension between the pair and, in retrospect, their breeding
hormone pattern had not stabilized, for their parenting routine had
changed considerably by the final attempt. The cock always
approached the nest directly while the hen made one stop, usually
on the ladder, on the way. She was so used to my presence that she
soon gave this up. The sole first chick was probably abandoned late
on the second evening. On the third morning, it was found cold and
immobile and appeared to be dead, but revived on warming. It was

fed and replaced in the box where it was visited by both parents then
subsequently ignored. By noon it was dead. Wasting no time, the
hen started a new nest that afternoon. Of the next lot of our chicks,
two died in the morning of the second day and the other two were
abandoned later that afternoon. These were hand fed but the
smaller one died during the following evening. The other chick had
a distended abdomen and was started on antibiotics. Within six
hours the swelling had gone down and the chick was quite lively.
The next day it was still fine and was given to a friend whose
attempts to rear it by hand were unsuccessful. Very quickly, on day
three, the hen began a new nest and finished it the following
afternoon. Five days later, she laid the first of a two egg clutch.
This time, I took over. On the first and second day, both chicks
were given antibiotics and hand-fed. The chicks were hand-fed
increasingly down to about one hour intervals on the seventh day.
Feedings consisted mainly of scrambled egg stirred with soft
margarine and moistened with a little milk. While this feeding was
being carried out, the cock always flew at me, usually brushing my
arms or head. Once he even sat on top of the nestbox throughout
the operation. The hen completely disappeared during these go-
ings-on. The nestlings grew well and the parents scarcely had to
feed. However, by late on the seventh day, the parents had given
up completely and although the chicks&apos; feathers were not out of the
quills, the hen did not brood that night. A little felt blanket was put
over the chicks just before dark. The cock removed this at first
light, but the parents ignored their offspring and began to visit the
previous nest box. It was blocked off but the adults continued to
fuss around it and so it was taken down. Hand-feeding continued
and, oddly enough, both parents continued to clean out the nest as
they did with all the broods, while refusing to feed the chicks. The
cock was more consistent in this than the hen. The pattern
continued until the ninth day, when the hen was so determined to
nest again that she began to pack new material in around the chicks!
Both babies were removed but the smaller one died late that
evening. It was quite well feathered and weighed 19 g at nine days,
compared with the first hand-fed chick which was featherless and
weighed only 8 g at eight days. The other expired on the following
morning, preceded by the usual and only sign of distress - that of
regurgitatingthepreviousmeal.lt weighed 20 g but had actually
lost 3 g since the previous day. The current nestbox was full of ants
and was taken down. The other box - the one that had been blocked
off - was re fixed at a slightly lower level. This time, it was held off

the wall by three large nails, covered in motor grease as an anti-ant
measure. This proved quite effective. The parents were very
determined. Commencing on the day on which the last chick died
(the 11th day), the hen finished refurbishing the old nest the next
afternoon. Two days later she laid the first of three eggs. This was
indecently rapid. It was as if she had decided that the brood was a
failure some days before she gave up. It was now the 19th July, and
two hatched early in the morning. At noon the hen was seen in the
box eating an eggshell, which the cock came and finished. The
third chick had just hatched, in twelve and a quarter days. This
time, I saw no need for intervention. Both parents approached the
new brood in a confident and completely different manner. Several
major differences were noted. First, feeds were regular and at half
the previous interval - about every 45 minutes compared with one
and a half hours. The cock fed the chicks like clockwork. Before,
he had fed them only once or twice, so that I had thought it was not
his job to feed small nestlings. Now he waited until the hen went
to the box and then immediately flew in behind her. He carried on
this dual feeding pattern for six days before going at random on his
own. This is probably a genus trait, for photographs ofM. townsendii
show both adults feeding together. Also, the hen gathered larvae
straight from the dish this time. Previously, she had always
snatched them from the cock who never actually proffered a larva
but banged it about then sat with it, as if he did not know what to
do next. Sometimes he turned away, forcing the hen to reach round,
and sometimes he even flew off, with the hen pursuing him all over
the aviary until she had retrieved the morsel, yet there was a dishful
of larvae in front of her for the taking. This was a carry-over from
courtship behaviour which she finally abandoned by the fourth
nesting attempt. Like the earlier chicks, this brood was raised
mainly on wax moth caterpillars for the first four or five days, with
a few spiders and moths. However, this lot also got increasing
numbers of grasshoppers as they became available. At one point,
the whole family was using a daily minimum of 150 half-grown
grasshoppers (plus at least 50 additional assorted larvae) and I
could never supply enough. The grasshoppers had the hop taken out
of them by snipping the back legs before they were dumped into an
old aquarium in the aviary. The birds soon learned to sit on the edge
of the tank as soon as I appeared with the large plastic collecting
bag and the cock continued to sit there while the contents were
emptied out. Rather reluctantly, I thought, they began to use
mealworms, preferring to eat these themselves and feed the other

stuff to the chicks, unless there was nothing else. They would not
take the beetles. The hen brooded the chicks for only eight days,
when they were still poorly feathered, suggesting Myadestes nests
in warm areas in the wild. The wing feathers broke out of the quills
on the tenth day, a day behind the last hand raised chicks! Amaz-
ingly, the feathers grew quickly enough for the two larger chicks to
leave the nest at 3 pm on the twelfth day, when they could barely
flop. One of the chicks weighed 25.3 g - somewhere around 70%
of the adult weight. The youngest chick sat at the box entrance until
the next day and cheeped for food. It disappeared inside at noon,
probably for a nap, and when I went to inspect it, it came shooting
out and crashed to the ground like the others. Both parents cleaned
out the nest equally well. All droppings were eaten inside the box,
right up until the young fledged. Rearing went smoothly, with both
parents feeding steadily, even though the hen had begun to moult.
But the brood was not out of the woods yet. On the 19th day, the
smallest chick, which was still being well fed, was seen on the
ground. It could barely stand and was brought inside. It seemed to
be mentally alert but its legs and wings were very weak. Progres-
sive paralysis set in and by the evening it had lost the use of its limbs
and had fallen over. It had the symptoms of neurological damage,
similar to a stroke, and died late that night. The day before, it had
flown heavily into the aviary door. As this was covered with soft
polypropylene netting, with a layer of plastic sheeting on top, it
could scarcely have hurt the chick. But it immediately took off and
flew lightly into the bathroom window. It appeared to be all right,
so was left in the aviary. This may have been a coincidence and,
like most aviary deaths, it remains a matter of speculation. The
other two chicks were fed for rather a longtime - to 33 days - in spite
of the fact that both parents were now moulting. This period was
no doubt extended because the adults did not nest again. The
juveniles could probably have fed themselves at about 24 days.
They were seen to drink at 25 days but it was certain they were
drinking earlier - close observation stopped at three weeks. Also
on the 25th day one chick was seen to emulate its parents and go
through all the motions of bathing. Whereas the adults had just been
in the water dish, the chick caught only a few drops of water when
the aviary was being hosed. The chick then jumped across the water
dish a few times, still preening, but did not go in. This performance
was watched closely by its sibling. The hen was noticed being
mildly aggressive to a chick which was 37 days old only a few days
after she had stopped feeding it. By six weeks, all the birds were

showing signs of intolerance of each other. The adults would
usually not allow the chicks to eat at the tray with them and the
chicks often chased each other off. A couple of weeks later, all ate
alone. By the end of September, the parents had moulted beauti-
fully and the adult grey was evident about the neck and shoulders
of the chicks, which looked bigger than their parents by this time.
Towards the end of October, when they were three months old, the
chicks had moulted all their spotted feathers and were indistin-
guishable from the adults.
The Brown-backed Solitaires always stopped feeding the chicks
an hour before roosting. Then they would fly back and forth for
anything from twenty minutes to an hour, the hen always taking the
longest. Well after the cock had retired to an adjacent vine, she
would sit and peer around for five to fifteen minutes before
entering. Once it was so dark by the time she went in that I could
see her only with the aid of binoculars. They were by far the last
birds to roost. Also they were up very early in the morning at the
first glimmer of light, being beaten only by local cock Robins T.
migratorius which started singing when it was still dark, although
the Robins turned in earlier. Their perching practice was peculiar.
Most of the time, they sat in a very erect military posture, across the
perch like other birds. But quite often they varied this by sitting
parallel to the perch with the tail looking uncomfortably bent on top
of it, and the wings hanging loosely over the sides. They held these
positions for minutes on end, as though deep in thought. They spent
very little time on the ground, usually only when in pursuit of an
insect. They did not hunt down escaped grasshoppers which were
living quite happily in dense vegetation, although size may have
been a factor here, because once the grasshoppers got very large,
they were ignored. But the birds immediately spotted and launched
in pursuit of midges flying at the far end of the aviary. In keeping
with their strange style, they would cock their heads and stare at the
food dish for a minute or so before finally bolting the item of
choice. They wolfed down live food, and the hen was so fast that it
was impossible to see if she squeezed the heads. This food-bolting
is typical of flycatchers. By the fifth week, the chicks were going
over the food dishes with great deliberation before gobbling.
Odder still is the manner of feeding nestlings. The parents never
fed food items direct, but always held them in the throat for periods
of from seven to twenty minutes, with an average of ten, before
offering them. They did this with berries and bread, as well as live
food. One could tell when the food was for themselves or for the

brood. In the first instance it was swallowed very quickly. If for
the chicks, it was swallowed then regurgitated into the throat with
a characteristic violent bobbing of the head, as if the bird were
choking. From day four on, when several larvae were ingested, the
throat had a slight tell-take bulge, emphasised by the feathers
sticking out over the area. Later still, the cock was once so
crammed, and the feathers so spread, that the pink skin of its throat
was visible. Both birds did this, but the hen invariably held the food
for longer than her mate and always took more, feeding the chicks
twice as much as the cock on each trip. For the first three broods,
the hen often took a drink after collecting food. It was thought that
this must be to provide the moisture to make a sort of pigeon&apos;s milk,
but an examination of dead chicks showed intact larvae in the
stomach, with no sign of any additional fluid. She was hardly seen
at the water dish during the fourth nesting. This holding of food in
the throat could not be for the purpose of transportation either, for
during the first two days only one larva was taken to the nest at a
time. Later, when four or five food items were ingested, they were
still held for ten minutes or so. As soon as the young left the nest,
the cock began to feed directly. The hen then kept food in her throat
for only one to three minutes, but finally gave this up by the 18th
day. At least part of the reason was probably to soften food and
supply moisture, for a wax moth caterpillar and a mealworm (one
the cock regurgitated) appeared swollen. However, why the food
should be held for so long remains a mystery. Unfortunately, the
other male obscurus died before this feeding peculiarity was seen.
He expired two days after eating the rhododendron petals, but this
was just a coincidence. However, the examination of another
species, a cock M. unicolor , showed no pouch or other particular
arrangement for holding food, other than a capacious throat.
The chicks never begged very vigorously at any time, although
they were most sprightly in the last nest. For the first week they
wavered straight up, and thereafter usually stretched forwards. If
they were asleep, the parents prompted them by tapping or even
banging their heads vigorously with a larva. The cock always fed
from the left side, the side of the box the nest was on, and merely
stood just inside the entrance. The hen always went right into the
box and so always fed from the right. This convenient arrangement
meant that I always knew which one was feeding. The chicks were
always fed once each in turn, only the cock often turning up with
food enough for just two of them. Once, when the chicks were very
small, the cock regurgitated a mealworm to the hen, who then fed

it to a chick. The hen was once seen to feed each in turn three times
and the first in line a fourth time. As the adults ate, so they fed the
chicks - like lightning. Quite often, they went in and out of the
gapes so fast that the chicks did not have time to seize the item and
it was withdrawn. But the bobbing was repeated until all the young
got their share. The white of waxmoth caterpillars could be
followed best in the dark nest, just as it was easy to see the white
gape of the chicks and the white eye ring of the adults bobbing up
and down. The question remains about what the chicks were getting
for the first day or two when only one larva was seen to be picked
up, yet at least two, and usually all three, were apparently fed each
time. Perhaps the feeding speed had something to do with this and
some chicks were not actually getting anything because they were
not quick enough, but that would scarcely account for ten feeding
movements. Besides, when a larva was withdrawn, it was usually
offered to the same chick again, before trying the others. Some
questions still remain unanswered about Myadestes, so if anybody
has any ideas, the author will be pleased to hear them.
Finally, as I was antproofing the box, the thought occurred that
the strongly ingrained nest-cleaning habit might have arisen as a
measure to avoid attracting ants. Cavity-nesters hardly need to
clean up to avoid drawing attention to the nest. Ants are far more
common and widespread than conventional predators and can be
deadly to helpless chicks and even adults. My aviaries have been
troubled by them in three continents, whereas I have had bother
with snakes in only one!

BREEDING THE YELLOW-BREASTED FRUIT DOVE

By Bruce Bohmke (St. Louis. Missouri)
Fruit doves belonging to the genus Ptilinopus are among the
most colourful birds in the world. The Yellow-breasted Fruit Dove
Ptilinopus occipitalis is not as brilliantly marked as some species
but the colour combination of grey, green, purple and yellow is
distinctive. Found only in primeval forest in the Philippines, the
natural history of the species is poorly known (Goodwin 1983).
This article describes the propagation and management of this
species at the St. Louis Zoological Park.
Apairof Yellow-breasted Fruit Doves was purchased in Novem-
ber 1988 from a dealer. Following a 30 day quarantine period, the
birds were housed in a planted aviary in the zoo&apos;s tropical bird
house. The exhibit has an area of 20.8 square m. and is 3.7 m. high.
The display is viewed by the public from only one side through
piano or harp wire. The wires are spaced 2.5 cm. apart. Perching
is provided by an assortment of natural branches and vines as well
as Ficus trees planted within the enclosure. Other plants within the
exhibit include Aglaonema, Dracaena , Philodendron , and Shefflera.
The substrate is soil covered with oak bark chips. Skylights
illuminate the display and incandescent lighting is added to provide
a minimum of twelve hours of light each day. Temperature of the
enclosure varies from 25* C. in winter to 36* C. in summer.
The diet offered to the Yellow-breasted Fruit Doves was the
same as that fed to other breeding pairs of fruit doves (Bohmke
1990, 1992). This diet includes fruit (apple, orange, banana and
grapes), canned vegetables which have been cooked and diced
(corn, black-eyed peas, carrots and beets), a small amount of Soft-
billed Bird Fare (made by Reliable Protein Products), and supple-
mentation with Vionate and calcium three times weekly. This diet
is offered daily at 9.00 am and again in the afternoon if chicks are
being fed. The food is offered on an elevated platform one and a
half m. high. A small concrete pool provides water for both
drinking and bathing.
The first egg was laid on 14th March, 1991 on the ground. The
egg was removed and set under a pair of incubating Ring-necked

by the keeper broken on the ground. For the next three months the
pair was seen to copulate but the male spent a good deal of time
chasing the hen. The highest nest in the enclosure was 2 m. above
the ground and it was felt that perhaps the female was not comfort-
able with the nests offered. A new nest was placed at a height of
2.6 m. and the female quickly occupied it. The third egg was laid
in this nest on 17th August 1991 and hatched twenty two days later.
Both the male and female incubated the egg with the female
covering it during the night and the male sporadically during the
day. The egg was seldom left unattended. Like the egg, the chick
was closely brooded by the parents, primarily the female. The
chick fledged after fifteen days although it appeared to be only a
quarter to one third the size of the parents. It had a fledged weight
of 68 grams. The chick was always attended by a parent for the first
few days after leaving the nest and only after three to four weeks
was it regularly seen without a parent nearby. When the chick was
removed from the enclosure it was 46 days old and weighed 132
grams. Ten single egg clutches have been laid by this pair to date.
Two eggs were found broken but the other eight were fertile. Two
of these fertile eggs were placed under foster parents but did not
hatch. Two other eggs were found with embryos dead in the first
stage of development. Both of these eggs were incubated by the
parents and were removed when the parents abandoned the nest.
Four eggs hatched under the parents with an average incubation
time of 22 days. This is longer than the 17 day incubation reported
by Roots (1970) but the shorter period was an estimate.
Three chicks survived to fledge in an average of 14 days. On
several occasions an egg was laid before a chick was removed. One
parent would incubate the egg while the other parent attended the
chick. This behaviour has been noted for other Ptilinopus species
such as the Jambu Fruit Dove Ptilinopus jambu (Roberts, 1991) and
the Black-naped Fruit Dove Ptilinopus melanospila (Bohmke.
1990). The time interval from hatch to removal from the parents
enclosure was 46, 35, and 47 days for three chicks. The two birds
removed at 46 and 47 days did well on their own but the chick
removed at 35 days died a few days later. Although it was seen to
eat, the chick was apparently removed too early. There seems to be
little seasonality associated with Yellow-breasted Fruit Dove re-
production. Eggs have been produced at St. Louis in the autumn,
winter, spring and summer. It is likely that wild fruit doves breed
in response to seasonal food availability. If food is always abun-
dant, as in captivity, reproduction always seems to be appropriate.

As a replacement for the typical flimsy dove nest, both wicker
baskets and wire baskets have been offered to the Yellow-breasted.
A shallow 16 mm mesh wire cup seems almost irresistible to most
fruit doves. The see-through nature of the wire mimics a dove nest
perfectly. The only problem with wire is that the eggs may be easily
dented by pressure from an incubating bird. The addition of sink
matting, a flexible plastic mesh on which laboratory glassware is
dried solves this problem. Generally several nests are placed in
what look like good nest locations. The locations are altered if the
fruit doves seem to favour a different spot.
Determination of sex does not appear possible by detecting
differences in size or coloration. Mature birds may be behaviour-
ally sexed but this is time consuming and potentially dangerous for
the birds. One of the standard laboratory sexing methods or direct
surgical sexing is recommended. As described in Pigeons and
Doves of the World (Goodwin, 1983), the first juvenile plumage is
entirely green and greyish-green with yellow feather edging. At
three to four months of age the purple and yellow feathers begin to
appear. At six months of age the young fruit dove is in adult
plumage.
Non-breeding Yellow-breasted Fruit Doves are compatible with
a wide range of softbills and ground birds. Breeding has taken
place with aviary companions such as Pittas, Bee-eaters and Fairy
Bluebirds (Roots, 1970). At the St. Louis Zoo, only ground birds
such as Crested Wood Partridge, Elegant Crested Tinamou, and
Cape Thicknee were kept in the same enclosure. Aggression
towards Yellow-breasted Fruit Doves has been shown by other
large pigeon species such as the Nicobar Pigeon.
Fruit doves make highly desirable display specimens and are
relatively simple to manage in captivity. Yellow-breasted Fruit
Doves are one of the most spectacular species recently available.
Unfortunately only a small number of this species was imported
which makes establishing a captive population very difficult. The
sharing of information is essential if we are to improve our ability
to manage captive birds.

Introduction and History
The Cape Barren Goose or Cereopsis Goose Cereopsis novae-
hollandiae is a relict species of southern Australia which has led
an isolated evolutionary existence and has developed certain pecu-
liar characteristics. It is regarded as a primitive relative of the true
goose. A similar form of Cereopsis once inhabited parts of New
Zealand. Beyond this evolutionary records are sketchy. One
theory, based on the appearance of the goslings, suggests that the
Cape Barren Goose may well be related to the Tadorna species
(Shelducks) which could indicate a primitive link with the geese.
The distribution of this species of Anatidae is restricted to the
mainland of southern Australia and the islands in the Bass Strait
which are small and isolated. Colonies of these geese can also be
found on Tasmania.
Description
These birds are large and are of a heavy build. The plumage is
mainly grey of varying shades with dark grey to black spots in the
centre of the feather-tips. The flight and tail feathers are tipped
with black. The crown is white, the eyes are black with orange
irides which appear to grow brighter with age. Younger birds have
darker eyes. The bill is black and short adapted for grazing. It has
a large bulbous yellow-green cere which covers most of the upper
mandible. The legs and feet are pink and very strong. The toes are
webbed and armed with very sharp, curved nails. Sexes are similar
but the cock bird is slightly larger and heavier. Both sexes produce
hollow nasal sounds, but the cock posseses a higher pitched trum-
peting call. Cape Barren Geese are highly territorial and pugna-
cious. They are very vocal especially when displaying to demon-
strate territory protection, and when in breeding condition they are
extremely aggressive towards other species and also people who
venture too close. The species forms strong pair-bonds and they
pair for life. In all other respects Cape Barren Geese are not very
sociable.
Habits in the Wild State
The Cape Barren Goose inhabits southern Australia and the
small offshore islands in the Bass Straits, where they breed.

Breeding takes place during the Australian winter months usually
between June and August. The nest is a shallow scrape in the
ground lined with feathers and grasses. This is constructed by both
sexes, usually located among low bushes or Tussock grass, al-
though sometimes a pair may choose to nest out in the open with no
cover at all. The nest-site is closely guarded largely by the cock
bird. A clutch of from 4 to 10 eggs is laid (average 7). These are
incubated solely by the hen for about 35 days (variation 34 to 40
days). The eggs are medium sized and white in colour with an
unusual limy coating. The goslings are cloaked in soft grey down
when they emerge from their shells. At this stage they are very
vulnerable, although predation from other species is not likely
because of the pugnacious behaviour of the adult birds in defence
of their offspring. Cape Barren goslings will readily take to water
whereas their parents will rarely enter the water. Cape Barren
Geese are not particularly aquatic, preferring to remain on dry land
for the majority of their time. An adaptation to this existence is
shown in their developed feet and legs which are built for a
terrestrial life, and in their particularly sharp, curved nails which
aid in climbing.
This species of goose is a heavy grazer and requires a large
expanse of grass to satisfy its dietary needs. This has led indirectly
to their ruthless culling by local farmers who believe that areas of
grass which have been fouled by the geese will not be grazed upon
by their sheep. It is said that when feeding the geese secrete a
noxious smelling chemical in the faeces which deters livestock
from grazing in those areas. As a result the geese were &amp;quot;shot on
sight&amp;quot; by local farmers to such an extent that the population crashed
severely and the Cape Barren goose was declared an endangered
species. Thankfully, since then the situation has improved. The
birds have full protection now in the wild state which has enabled
the population to recover. In addition the captive population of this
species in zoological collections has flourished. The Cape Barren
Goose is no longer classed as endangered and its future is reason-
ably secure at present. However, its position in the wild remains
vulnerable.
Captive Management and Reproduction
Housing
Cape Barren Geese require housing in a suitably grassy enclo-
sure for they are heavy grazers and a large proportion of their diet
is composed of grasses. The enclosure needs to be constructed
securely particularly the fencing which forms the birds territory

boundary and may need to withstand a constant battering from the
defensive occupants. Cape Barren Geese are also accomplished
diggers and may uproot unburied or insecure fencing. The species
is very terrestrial, preferring dry land and rarely making use of
areas of water. Therefore, it is not essential to provide an area of
water within their enclosure. However I include a pool in the
design of an enclosure for this species to provide water for the
goslings, which will appreciate it for bathing and swimming,
obviously to provide fresh drinking water at all times, and for
aesthetic reasons. Adult Cape Barren Geese are extremely hardy
and resilient birds which are not bothered by adverse weather.
However their goslings are not able to withstand such conditions
and therefore, it is advisable to include a shelter within the enclo-
sure. A large kennel-type affair is suitable for nesting shelter and
roosting. This is beneficial especially when it comes to breeding
although it is probable that the birds will choose to nest outside in
the open. Some &amp;quot;natural cover&amp;quot; can be created in their enclosure
by providing hardy shrubs etc. I recommend the use of large
Pampas grasses to provide good cover for nesting and to supply
extra nesting material.
Grouping
Cape Barren Geese pair for life with a very strong pair-bond
being established. It is advisable to house established pairs as sole
occupants of an enclosure. An enclosure which is very spacious
may be able to contain two pairs of this species amicably, as long
as the area is sufficient for two large separate territories to become
established by the birds. From my own experience I consider it is
best to house pairs separately.
In one collection at which I have worked an established pair was
housed temporarily in a large enclosure with two male and two
female young Cape Barren Geese which were all related, under
breeding age and, at the time, compatible with one another. Within
two months one of the young birds was killed by the very aggressive
mature cock bird from the established pair. The remaining three
birds were isolated and removed. Cape Barren Geese are some-
times kept in an enclosure with some species of mammals in a few
zoological collections. I have no information on the success or
otherwise of such an arrangement, but I think that the geese are
unlikely to breed successfully.
Breeding
Nesting takes place during the winter months in the wild, a
preference which is mirrored in captivity to the dismay of many

zoological directors and curators. Obviously gosling mortality can
be higher than it need be, but realistically the choice rests with the
birds themselves. Cape Barren Geese held in European zoological
collections nest from September to March, the peak of breeding
behaviour being during December and January. Some pairs are
quite prolific, successfully raising brood after brood, whereas
others may reproduce less reliably. The chosen nest-site is heavily
guarded by the birds even before the nest is constructed. Nest-
building is a task undertaken by both sexes. Initially the nest is a
hollow scrape in the ground which is then lined with feathers,
leaves, dried grasses and other similar materials.
A clutch of 4 - 10 eggs is laid (average 7) which the hen bird
incubates for about 35 to 40 days. The hen incubates alone, rarely
leaving the nest and the cock enthusiastically defends it from all
threats. Cape Barren Geese are more aggressive than most other
species of Anatidae. After 35 days the goslings hatch and are
covered in soft grey down. They are closely guarded by the adult
birds which remain aggressive. A close eye should be kept on them
at that time as, occasionally, the aggression may be directed
towards the goslings especially by the adult cock bird.
Any area of water will be enjoyed by the goslings, usually with
the adults looking on. The goslings develop slowly and for their
first few weeks they are vulnerable and fragile in contrast with their
aggressive parents. Breeding pairs should not be disturbed if
possible. However with pairs that have proved to be unreliable
parents it is advisable to remove the eggs (or possibly newly
hatched goslings) for artificial rearing. This is not easy without
getting severely attacked. Goslings should not be reared artifi-
cially in isolation to avoid imprinting. Cape Barren goslings
artificially reared may also be something of a &amp;quot;handful" as they
mature because they may lose their natural fear and become
aggressively familiar! Cape Barren Geese usually produce one
clutch per season. However, if the first clutch is lost, a second may
follow.
Diet
Cape Barren Geese feed extensively on grasses and this need
should be satisfied naturally. In addition in captivity they require
a diet consisting of a grain mixture i.e. wheat, barley, maize,
groats, oats and corn and poultry breeder pellets, which need to be
increased in proportion to the grain when approaching the breeding
season, eventually replacing the grain for a while before being
reduced as the birds come out of breeding condition. Wholemeal

bread and crumbled biscuit (wheatmeal) may also be given. Al-
though grass forms a major part of their diet, lettuce, cabbage,
duckweed and other aquatic vegetation should be provided. Fresh
water and poultry grit should be made available daily and Vionate
multi-vitamin powder should be dusted onto the grain, pellets and
bread twice weekly.
Handling
The size, strength and temperament of these geese make them
difficult to handle. When moving these birds manually, beware of
their nails which are very sharp and strong (from experience, they
can inflict nasty wounds and tear clothing!) Hold the feet away
from the body and keep a firm grip on the legs. Fold the wings close
to the birds body (the bend of the wing is sometimes used to batter
the handler). Remember that they can inflict pain with the bill
which they are reluctant to release once it is attached to your
person! Transporting Cape Barren Geese is best achieved in a
wooden crate of suitable dimensions. They can also be moved from
one area to another by employing &amp;quot;kick-boards&amp;quot;. These are wooden
boards with handles which can be used to usher or guide the birds
without any physical contact taking place.

As has already been mentioned, the remaining wild population
of Cape Barren Geese is increasing at a steady rate because of full
protection at last, after many years of culling by locals. Their
previously endangered status has been lifted. However, the wild
population still remains vulnerable and the species&apos; limited distri-
bution does not help the situation. The birds in zoological collec-
tions have flourished and as a result we now have a small but
healthy surplus of this species which should ensure their future
survival.

Jeffrey Trollope&apos;s breeding of the Cinereous Finch (Avicultural
Magazine, 1993, 99 , 57.) is probably the first occasion on which
this species has been bred in the United Kingdom and Ken Dolton&apos;s
of the Duivenbode&apos;s Lory (Avicultural Magazine, 1991, 97 , 37.)
probably the first on which it has been completely reared by its
parents. Anyone who knows of previous breedings is requested to
inform the Hon. Secretary.

Rosemary Wiseman reports on the first of the occasional meet-
ings of small groups of members of the Society, for the initiation
of which she was mainly responsible:- The &amp;quot;visits to members&apos;
collections&amp;quot; got off to a flying start with a meeting at the end of
April at the home of Dulcie and Freddie Cooke. Between twenty
and thirty Avicultural Society members were entertained to a
delicious and lavish lunch provided by Dulcie. A glass of wine
helped members who had come from considerable distances to
relax and get down to the serious business of the day - chatting
about birds! Although the morning was overcast, the sun appeared
immediately after lunch was finished and the visitors wandered out
into the garden which was a mass of colour from tulips, wallflow-
ers, forget-me-nots, heather and beautifully espaliered apple trees
blossoming around the flights. All this plus an immaculate lawn
testified to Freddie&apos;s unstinting labour. Dulcie and Freddie are well
known aviculturists and with good reason. They have a charming
collection of lories, with a most interesting range of species, some
very rare. What is most noticeable is that the birds greet visitors
with interest and curiosity, clearly used to human companionship
and attention. It was good to see the birds looking in such splendid
condition, many already starting to breed, but apparently quite
relaxed about the unexpected invasion of their territory. A visit to
the incubator and brooding equipment, and a cup of tea in the
garden in the warm sunshine ended a near perfect day. The
Avicultural Society wishes to thank Dulcie and Freddie for all the
care and very hard work they put into making the first of these visits
so memorable.

been discovered in China, the Chinese Phylloscopus sichuanensis ,
named after the province in which it was discovered and the Hainan
leaf Warbler P. hainanus from the island of the same name. Both
new species are described in the December 1992 and January 1993
issues of Ibis, the journal of the British Ornithologists Union.
Beale Wildlife Gardens in Berkshire has specialised in Laugh-
ing Thrushes for several years. Fifteen species are represented in
the collection of which 12 are potential breeders. By the end of
May 1993, seven pairs of six species had young and an eighth was
incubating. The breedings of two of these species are believed to
be &amp;quot;firsts" and it is hoped to publish details in a future issue.
Hans van der Sluis sends further news from Avifauna, Alphen
a/d Rijn:- The first species of waterfowl with chicks in our
Birdpark in April was, as usual, the Hawaiian Goose Branta
sandvicensis but more early breeders were the Rose-ringed Para-
keets Psittacula krameri which have reared one chick. The Scarlet
Ibis Eudocimus ruber started this breeding season while they were
still housed in their winter aviary. The eggs which were laid on the
ground were placed in an incubator and any chicks hatched will be
raised by hand. Hammerhead Storks Scopus umbretta reared two
chicks in their huge and intricate nest. Collared Pratincoles
Glarcola pratincole kept it more simple and nested in a shallow
depression. The parents feed their two chicks by putting insects
into their bills!
The following breedings took place in May. For the first time
five chicks of the Lesser Rhea Pterocnemia pennata were hatched.
We have already been successful inbreedingthe Greater Rhea Rhea
americana. In our tropical house four Toco Toucans Rhamphastos
toco , one Blue-winged Pitta Pitta mollucensis , three White-col-
lared Kingfishers Halcyon chloris , one Superb Fruit Dove Pdlinopus
superbus , one Dusky Lory Pseudeos fuscata, five Azure-winged
Magpies Cyanopica cyana , and fifteen Masked Plovers Vanellus
miles have been reared. Our White Storks Ciconia ciconia ciconia
reared fifteen chicks from four pairs of which three are able to leave
the park if they want to. Sometimes they do but they always return
at the start of the breeding season. Other fisheaters with chicks are
Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo and Sacred Ibises
Threskiornis aethiopica. The many species of our waterfowl and
pheasants which were successful include Hooded MerganserMergws

The Research and Breeding Centre of Birds International Inc. in
the Philippines has published its first Newsletter. The document
refers primarily to the parrots which have already been bred, some
reared by hand but many by the parent birds, during the first six
months of this year. The list of successful breedings includes many
species of Lory, four of Fig Parrots (Edward&apos;s, Salvadori, Desmarest&apos;s
and Double-eyed), Racket-tailed Parrots, three species of the genus
Tanygnathus (Great-billed, Blue-naped and Blue-backed) and nu-
merous Amazons etc., Cockatoos and Macaws including, most
remarkably, four Spix Macaws one of which is intended for return
to the wild. The Centre, in collaboration with the Philippine
Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau, has established international
stud-books for several Philippine species and anyone interested in
participating in the projects is invited to contact the Stud-book
Administrator, Birds International Inc., Research and Breeding
Centre, 99 Timog Avenue, Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines.
A paragraph in the News and Views section of the Avicultural
Magazine (1991, 97, 97) referred to the successful beginning of the
establishment of a captive-breeding programme for the very rare
Helmeted Honeyeater at the Healesville Sanctuary in Victoria,
Australia. The note mentioned the rearing of chicks of this

endangered species, of which only about 50 specimens in the
Yellingbo Nature Reserve were known to exist, using Gippsland
Yellow-tufted Honeyeaters as foster parents. The programme
appeared to be progressing satisfactorily until October of last year
when conservationist were shocked to learn of the sudden death of
twenty one of the twenty three speciments at Healesville. I was in
Melbourne at the time and so I drove to Heaslesville to learn more
about this tragic event. I was told that the cause of the deaths of the
birds was an overdose of vitamin D 3 . Apparently some of the hens
had laid soft-shelled eggs. To prevent this it had been decided to
increase the vitamin D 3 content of the food, which was done with
dire results. It is difficult for me to believe that this vitamin which
is known to exert chronic toxic effects when given in large doses
over long periods, could have such a remarkable acute toxic action.
However, this was the story which appeared subsequently in news-
papers and journals. The deaths are a marked set-back to Healesville&apos;s
commendable efforts to save the species from extinction. However,
the attempts have not been abandoned. There are now about 70
birds in the Yellingbo Reserve. It is intended once again to
establish a captive population from eggs from the first clutches of
the wild birds which will be incubated by Yellow-tufted Honeyeaters
at Healesville.
The last stage in the Kiwi recovery programme organised by the
New Zealand Department of Conservation has revealed a consider-
able decline in the number and in the distribution of Brown and
Great Spotted Kiwis. Dogs which kill them and possums which
compete with them for food and burrows, and eat their eggs are
mainly responsible. The Little Spotted Kiwi has disappeared from
the mainland and is now restricted to island sanctuaries where it
exists in reasonable numbers.
In 1991 two Superb Birds of Paradise and in 1992 four more were
reared in Honolulu Zoo. When I visited this delightful Zoo in
September last year I was surprised to find a range of aviaries
devoted to Birds of Paradise of three species, Magnificent, Count
Raggi's and Superb. The Zoo has, in beautifully planted, quite
small aviaries, an excellent collection of birds all of which ap-

peared to be in perfect condition. I had no time to take notes but
I remember, in particular, many Bleeding-heart Doves which had
been reared by Barbary Dove foster parents, Magnificent Ground
Pigeons and splendid Amboina King Parrots. There was also a well
designed aviary withsome endemic Hawaiian softbills, all of which
are now very rare. The aviary has been constructed to provide
almost aseptic conditions in the Zoo's attempt to protect the
inhabitants from infection with bacteria which they would never
have encountered previously in their natural habitat.

The National Wildlife Centre, Mount Bruce, New Zealand
reviews every year its research and breeding programmes in order
to concentrate on the species most threatened with extinction but its
efforts are fraught with difficulty because New Zealand, like
Madagascar and Hawaii, has the world&apos;s greatest number of threat-
ened endemic species. I have been lucky enough to be able to visit
this interesting and important Wildlife Centre at fairly frequent
intervals since it opened about thirty years ago.
In the early years attention was focused on the Notornis or
Takahe. Successful breeding techniques were developed which are
now being used at other breeding centres. As a result captive-bred
specimens have been liberated on Kapiti, Maude and Mana Islands
where they are doing well. At the same time several aviaries were
devoted to the nominate races and some of the sub-species of the
Red-fronted and Yellow-fronted Parrakeets. Later, efforts were
concentrated on the extremely attractive and largest member of the
genus Cyanoramphus , the Antipodes Island Parrakeet. This species
became well established and now can be seen in many public and
private aviaries in New Zealand.
Particular attention is being given at the present time to three
critically endangered species, the Campbell Island Duck, the rarest
duck in the world, the Black Stilt of which only six pairs are known
to exist in the wild and the Shore Plover (see Avicultural Magazine,
1993, 99, 106.). The Campbell Island Duck has not bred yet but the
Black Stilts reared two chicks which were later released to augment
the wild population.
The Kokako, a species of wattlebird, bred successfully at the
Centre in 1986 but subsequent attempts have been unsuccessful.
The South Island race of this handsome species is very rare and
there are just a few survivors on Stewart Island. The North Island

race exists in small populations in forest areas in the centre of the
North Island and in the Bay of Plenty. At Mount Bruce an enormous
new aviary, 10 meters high, planted to mimic perfectly the species&apos;
natural forest habitat, has been constructed to accommodate, breed
and study them. One pair laid eggs last year but they were infertile.
Another beautiful wattlebird is the Saddleback. It is a delight-
fully active and confiding glossy black bird, about the size of a
Song Thrush, with chestnut &amp;quot;saddle&amp;quot; and rump and orange wattles.
Its numbers are down to about 3000 in the North Island and 250 in
the South. It is being bred successfully at the Centre and birds have
been released on Kapiti Island and on a predator-free island in the
middle of Lake Rororua and they are said to be doing well.
There are four potential breeding pairs of another rare and
lovely little bird, the Stitchbird, at the Centre. Last year an
established pair hatched and reared two chicks and another pair
hatched a chick but the mother and chick were found dead on a day
which coincided with the visit of a large number of school children.
Four more birds were lost during the winter and the stress due to
inadvertent disturbance by visitors was blamed. A few months ago
I stood outside their large aviary and watched a male, time and
again relentlessly chasing a female round and round the enclosure
until the hen dropped exhausted to the ground. I suggested to one
of the staff that this might constitute a stress effect but my remarks
were received with a conspicuous lack of interest. Perhaps I caught
him on a bad day.
Aviculture undoubtedly has an important part to play in the
conservation of endangered species. Captive breeding of many
species often appears not to be difficult but the reintroduction to
their natural habitat (if it still exists!) is fraught with problems.
With enthusiasts like those at Mount Bruce who are committed to
working for the long term survival of the species in their care there
is hope for some at least.

the Editor. When I accepted the task the affairs of the Society were
in a parlous state and the magazine was being published only at
irregular intervals. My immediate object was, therefore, to ensure
its regular publication and to maintain its interest and literary
standard. The facts that it has been published on time and that its
interest has been maintained are due to the response of some
members to my appeals for articles. In this context I am particu-
larly grateful to Dulcie Cooke, Malcolm Ellis, Rosemary Low,
Jeffrey Trollope and Roger Wilkinson for their support. My
attempts to broaden the spectrum of interest of the magazine by
improving and extending the News and Views section has been less
successful because my requests for avicultural news items have
been received, regrettably, with a conspicuous lack of interest. I
am grateful to Dave Coles and Frank Woolham who have responded
occasionally but, usually, I have had to write the section myself.
My efforts to keep up the literary standard of the magazine have
often involved my modifying and sometimes rewriting material
which has been submitted for publication. I hope that I have not
offended any authors.
I have been very dependent upon Margaret Ware of Bristol Zoo
for clerical and secretarial assistance, for the preparation of proofs
and for dealing with the printers. I am very grateful for her
invaluable help.
The Council has invited Frank Woolham, whose address is 32,
Caughall Road, Upton-by-Chester, Chester, CH2 1LP, to edit the
magazine from 1st January 1994 and he has graciously accepted the
invitation. He knows well that it is hard work, time consuming and
often boring but I hope he will revitalise the Society as the Editor
of the weekly paper &amp;quot;Cage and Aviary Birds&amp;quot; suggested he would.
Certainly he will bring to the task a more professional approach
than mine. He has my support and very best wishes.

The Fischer's Touraco Tauraco fischeri has a short, white
tipped, thick crest and a red patch on the nape and hindneck. Its eye
markings are similar to those of Livingstone&apos;s and Schalow&apos;s and
like them it has bright red flight feathers.
Leeds Castle purchased in 1988 a pair of Fischer&apos;s Touraco
which has been housed in an aviary of softbill species including
Fairy Bluebirds, Red Tailed Laughing Thrushes, Yellow Throated
Laughing Thrushes, White Breasted Water Hens and Emerald
Starlings. The aviary is 17 ft. high, is planted and has two ponds
in which the Touracos love to bathe. It has a brick-built, heated
shelter where food and water are provided. It also provides the
birds with an area away from the many visitors who come through
our gates every year.

Touracos are frugivorous but there is little documentation on
their diet in the wild. The touracos in the collection at Leeds Castle
are fed on a varied diet comprising apple, pear, grapes, paw-paw,
banana, tomatoes, a small amount of Diet A, a small amount of lean
meat (rat pinkie during the breeding season) and a light sprinkling
of insectivorous mixture. This is supplemented with seasonal vari-
ations such as berries, exotic soft fruits and livefood.
In 1990 the pair became increasingly interested in the nest boxes
which had been provided. This activity involved both birds hop-
ping in and out of the nest boxes and the constant carrying and
rearranging of nest materials (mainly small apple twigs and straw).
However no eggs were laid. During the winter months a mesh
tunnel was erected connecting the Fischer&apos;s aviary with another
softbill aviary. This was to prove invaluable as it increased the
nesting opportunities for all of the birds in both aviaries and served
to reduce the risks of overcrowding and territorial competition.
Despite the February snow, the 1991 season started early and
once again the Fischer&apos;s became increasingly interested in the nest
boxes in both aviaries and their shelters. After approximately six
weeks the final choice of nest box was made. It was in the shelter
of the smaller aviary just behind the entrance hole. The nest box
measured 12&amp;quot; x 12&amp;quot; x 12&amp;quot;. The base of the box was wire mesh and
the front lip was 4 inches high. The roof had a two inch overhang
and slanted down towards the front. The box was lined with small
apple twigs of uniform length (approx. 6 inches) and size. Initially
we put these in the nest and they were then reorganised by the birds.
This seemed merely to stimulate the birds&apos; breeding behaviour as no
obvious arrangement or positioning of the twigs could be seen.
Descriptions of nesting and breeding behaviour in the wild support
that this is typical as most nest structures are bulky fragile plat-
forms made of twigs.
On 22 May one egg was laid in the box in the shelter. The nest
material was discarded and so we exchanged the egg for a dummy
and added nest material in the form of straw. The egg was placed
in an incubator. A second egg was laid on 24 May and the hen
commenced incubation. The egg in the incubator hatched on 14
June after 23 days incubation. Only the dummy egg was left in the
nest. There was no trace of the second egg and we assumed that it
was infertile. The dummy egg was removed. The chick was hand
reared successfully using Diet A (a Nazuri Zoo Food available from
SDS Ltd.).
On 15 August the hen was sitting again on a single egg. The nest

material was discarded as before. A chick hatched successfully on
10 September. The diet was supplemented with blended pinkies,
paw-paw and other fruit until the chick was independent when it
was about 17 days old. The chick was covered with a sooty down
but developed quickly and left the nest 10 days later, hopping and
crawling along small branches near to the nest. However, the chick
did not return to it. Despite the lack of nest material the chick
seemed to do well. On closer inspection the chick was seen to be
sitting on the hen&apos;s feet to keep warm. Perhaps the hen had used the
same technique to incubate the egg thus avoiding cracking it
against the mesh base of the box? Both the hand reared chick and
the parent reared chick were raised successfully.
This is the first known captive breeding of Fischer&apos;s Touraco in
the U.K.

By Malcolm Ellis (Wadebridge, Cornwall)
In the mid-1950s, when I went to work in the Bird House at
London Zoo, there were, if I remember rightly, four members of the
Touraco family represented in the zoo collection. They were the
Senegal Touraco Tauraco persa buffoni , the Great-billed T.
macrorhynchus , Donaldson Smith&apos;s (White-cheeked) Touraco T.
leucotis donaldsoni and the (Western) Grey Plantain-eater Crinifer
piscator. Shortly afterwards a pair of Purple-crested Touracos T.
(or Musophaga) porphyreolopha were added to the collection. The
first after a long absence is available again, though it tends to be
called now the Green-crested, or Buffon&apos;s Touraco. Here, in
Britain at least, the Great-billed and Donaldson Smith&apos;s Touracos
seem to have disappeared from present day aviculture. The Great-
billed or Black-tipped Crested species, which has a relatively large
though not an enormous bill, mainly orange yellow with red at the
base occurs, according to Bannerman (1953), from Sierra Leone to
Ghana, where it inhabits high forest country and never wanders far
into secondary forest. The Zoo&apos;s-Donaldson Smith&apos;s Touraco lived
in the Bird House from 1945 to 1963 and before then was in Spedan
Lewis&apos;s collection at Leckford,. Recorded from south-eastern
Ethiopia and adjacent areas of Somalia, this race, with its green
crest with a broad dull crimson tip, looks quite distinct from the
now familiar nominate form which was not represented in the
London Zoo collection until 1963.
The name plantain-eater was in the past more widely applied to
members of the Touraco family. Nowadays, this name tends to be
reserved for the two species of the genus Crinifer. It has long struck
me as an inappropriate name, the replacement of which is well
overdue, for, as far as I am aware, there is little or no convincing
evidence that, in the wild, birds of the Touraco family eat plantains.
According to Newton (1896), the name plantain-eater is derived
from a translation of the generic name Musophaga , Musa being the
name of the genus which contains plantains and bananas. The Grey
Plantain-eater living in the Bird House ate a lot of lettuce. As a
young keeper I was sent to cut branches of fresh hawthorn leaves
which were also much to its liking. Describing the first breeding
of the Grey Touraco or Go-away Bird Corythaixoides concolor at
Jersey, Roles (1970) noted that their birds always had fresh
hawthorn available and quickly stripped the young leaves and buds.

They also readily took convolvulus and hebe foliage.
Among the touracos, the Great Blue Corythaeola cristata is the
only one with a reputation for being difficult to keep. In 1968, an
adult and two young ones from Uganda arrived at the Bird House
at London Zoo. By then I no longer worked in the Bird House and
my recollections of them are brief and vague, probably because,
sadly, they did not do very well. It was not the first time that this
species had been exhibited there and the 1931 Zoo Guide included
a photo of this touraco which had certainly been kept there before
1929. It must have been after 1968 when some were brought from
East Africa by Ivan Bampton and the late Gerry Kirkham. I think
there were three which went to Birdland at Bourton-on-the-Water
where I remember seeing one some years later. I believe that some
were imported into Britain earlier this year and a few others may
have been imported after the Birdland ones. The difficulty in
keeping them used to be with regard to their diet. It was said that
this species required onion and garlic in its diet because they were
similar to plants which it had been observed eating in the wild.
Another idea was that the diet needed to include meat. It seems far
more likely that greenfood is an important constituent. This
species, by far the largest of the touracos, was studied by Mhorag
Candy in western Kenya which is at the extreme eastern limit of its
range. As well as eating an assortment of wild fruits, Great Blue
Touracos came from the forest to the Candy's garden on the
Kaimosi Tea Estate to feast on loquats and guavas, introduced
&apos;exotics&apos; which the birds greatly relished. Candy (1984) observed
that although they are frugivorous they also eat buds, shoots, leaves
and flowers. They feed regurgitated leaves to their young from the
time when the young are 8 days old and possibly earlier. This
species was not observed drinking water, eating insects, or as
Mhorag Candy noted, eating &amp;quot;wild plantain seeds&amp;quot;! Her study was
the first on this species in the wild, but, a few years earlier,
Reinhard and Blaskiewitz (1981) published an account of the great
Blue Touraco in Berlin Zoo. Candy (1984) considered that only
two Tauraco species had been studied in the wild, Hartlaub&apos;s
Touraco T. hartlaudi by Van Someren (1956) and the Knysna
species T. corythaix (or T. persa corythaix) by Courtenay-Latimer
(1942) and Stannard (1971). Candy also studied Ross&apos;s TouracoM
rossae. However, as far as I am aware, her findings have not been
published.
In Kenya, during the late 1960s and early 1970s, I heard of three
or four individuals there who were said to know the secret of raising

and keeping Great Blue Touracos successfully. Whether there is a
special secret to keeping this species, I am still not sure. Hopefully,
someone with experience of keeping this species, perhaps in one of
the European zoos or in San Diego Zoo, will be prompted by this
to write a note or article giving details of the Great Blue Touraco&apos;s
requirements. I should like to have seen some in the care of Jane
Barnley, who was a wizard at rearing young touracos and other
birds, some far more difficult to raise than touracos. As some
members know, Jane and her husband Tim, in partnership on their
own account and through David Roberts Wildlife, had a well
founded reputation for the high standard of choice species which
they sent from Kenya, when bird exports from there were permitted,
albeit on a strictly controlled basis. I have in mind species such as
the Little Bee-eater Merops pusillus, the Cinnamon-chested M.
oreobates and White-fronted species M. bullockoides , the Pigmy
Ispidina pi eta. Woodland Halcyon senegalensis and other kingfish-
ers, barbets, including the Yellow-billed Trachylaemuspurpuratus,
Doherty&apos;s Bush Shrike Malaconotus dohertyi and the Black-headed
Gonolek Laniarius barbarus , more than ten kinds of sunbirds
Anthreptes and Nectarinia spp., the Red-headed Blue-bill
Spermophaga ruficapilla , Grey-headed Negro Finch Nigrita
canicapilla and the Oriole Finch Linurgus olivaceus , which I wrote
about mihsAviculturalMagazine (1981, 87, 130-135). They were
also at that time the source of most, if not all, of the Ross&apos;s and
White-crested T. leucolopus Touracos.
Tim, who was born in Nairobi in 1922, died there in December
1987, ten painful and frustrating years after a back operation went
tragically wrong. Jane and her youngest daughter Julia continue
to live in what was their farmhouse on the Cherangani Hills, close
to the town of Kitale and within sight of Mt. Elgon which straddles
the Kenya-Uganda border. I got to know of Tim and Jane and their
family when Jane sent to London Zoo a handreared Splendid
Starling Lamprotornis splendidus which could talk very clearly and
mimic a variety of sounds. When I first visited &apos;Kaibos&apos; and later
lived there, among their birds was a pet Splendid Starling called
Charlie like the first one. Indeed, saying &amp;quot;Hello Charlie&amp;quot;, was part
of its repertoire. &amp;quot;Where&apos;s Julia?&amp;quot; was another of this talkative
starlings clearly repeated phrases. It could imitate accurately the
voices of different members of the household, some so well that
when they were out of sight it was often almost impossible to be
sure whether one was hearing the bird&apos;s voice or that of the person
it was imitating.

Tim showed me my first wild Ross&apos;s Touracos on his farm
where, on a later occasion, I had the thrill of seeing some very close
in a fig tree in the garden. As with most touracos it is their loud
calls which usually draw attention to their presence. The Eastern
Grey Plantain-eater C. zonurus also occurs on wooded farmland
around Kit ale, Occasionally, both species can be seen in the Saiwa
Swamp National -Park, which Tim worked long and hard to get
gazetted mainly in an attempt to safeguard the small local popula-
tion of sitatunga, the swamp dwelling antelope which is isolated
there amidst farmland. In western Kenya Ross&apos;s Touraco is mainly
a highland species. At higher elevations it is replaced by Hartlaub&apos;s
Touraco, an exclusively highland inhabitant. Incidentally, Forshaw,
when writing about lard t rie&apos;s parrot Poicephalus guiielmi (Forshaw
and Cooper, 1973) which is called the Red-fronted Parrot in East
Africa, mentioned this interesting but largely ignored area of
Kenya. He quoted Pitman who, back in 1928, wrote about this
parrot&apos;s daily movements between the Cherangani Hills and Mt.
Elgon. Pitman described how &amp;quot;just after sunrise the parrots left the
forest of the hills and flew some 50 to 60 km across Acacia plains
to feed in forests on Mt. Elgon, returning each evening to roost.&amp;quot; He
added that &amp;quot;when traversing the plains they normally followed tree-
lined rivers and streams.&amp;quot; Such riparian strips and patches of forest
are also among the favoured haunts of Ross&apos;s Touraco. It is difficult
to understand why the parrots fly all the way to Mt.. Elgon to feed
and, having done so, fly all the way back to the Cheranganis simply
to roost. It is something about which I remember asking Tim.
Although he was familiar with the Red-fronted Parrot on* the
Cheranganis and on Elgon, he had never seen them making the daily
journey between the two. However, to get back to the touracos,
only a short drive northwards the White-crested species, which
favours low rainfall areas, lives in the &amp;quot;hot country&amp;quot; as does the
White-bellied Go-away bird Corythaixoides (or Criniferoides)
leucogaster , the most common member of the Touraco family in
East Africa, a characteristic bird of the East African bush occurring
in all but the most arid parts.
The Ross&apos;s and White-crested Touracos were almost invariably
obtained as nestlings. Writing in th cAvicultural Magazine , 1977,
83, 179 - 182, I described how, during the previous year, several
Ross&apos;s nestlings arrived during June and July and some in other
months. During the 21st June - 31st July, eight young White-
crested Touracos arrived and, on the 5th August, three young
Hartlaub&apos;s. It was important not to take the nestlings when they

were too young. Ideally, they needed to be well covered with down,
with their wing feathers developing in their sheaths or just showing
signs of emerging. Later on the nestlings were likely to be less
steady and not so amenable to being handreared. Usually there
were two nestlings per nest. Occasionally there was only one.
Single nestlings often became especially tame. The nestlings were
fed on mashed or diced banana and paw-paw, mixed with mashed
or chopped hard-boiled egg, chopped lettuce and home-made soft-
bill food. Powdered calcium and a multivitamin preparation were
added to each dish of food. The first two or three times, the
nestling&apos;s beak needed to be gently prized open and some food
pushed down, after which they learned quickly to take food from
the tip of a teaspoon. Often then it was only a matter of a few days
before they learned to feed from a small dish of food left in the box
with them. They had prodigious appetites and produced copious
droppings with the result that their 'bedding' needed to be changed
frequently. Also, from time to time, it was necessary to wipe clean
their beaks, nostrils and face carefully and their feet and anywhere
else where food had adhered. The nestlings were confined, usually
in twos, in box-type cages which had the front covered with soft
gauze of the type used for fly-screening. They were kept in the
house where, in the evenings and on particularly cold afternoons,
there was usually a fire by the side of which the cages of young birds
were stacked. The young touracos developed very quickly. Soon
they were well feathered, though not fully coloured and, during
sunny days, they were put out on a verandah and acclimatised
gradually to living outdoors again. Until then they remained
susceptible to chills which could lead to respiratory problems
which needed treatment with an antibiotic. When they were being
handled and moved to fresh accommodation, special care had to be
taken with their slender legs and toes and a check made that there
was nowhere they might get trapped. Having been acclimatised
carefully, they were moved to outdoor aviaries.
In A Wanderer in the Wind , subtitled The Odyssey of an Animal
Collector (Hutchinson, 1953), Cecil Webb described catching
Purple-crested Touracos in Mozambique. He used a home-made
box-type trap, made of wire-netting, with an open side which
dropped down. Knowing how touracos love to run along straight
branches, he fixed the trap to a long pole slung horizontally across
the central upper branches of a fruit-bearing tree frequented by
several pairs of touracos. Baiting the trap with artificial fruits
brought from a large store in England, he succeeded in catching two

pairs of Purple-crested Touracos. When I asked Tim Barnley, who
received a lot of early help from Cecil Webb, if he had tried Webb&apos;s
method he simply smiled and said &amp;quot;Perhaps in those days (when
Webb was collecting) the touracos were less sophisticated.&amp;quot; On the
few occasions when adult Ross&apos;s and White-crested Touracos were
caught, always in mist-nets, both species were very wild at first and
slow to steady down. Hartlaub&apos;s Touracos, by contrast, settled
relatively quickly to aviary life. Even better were the White-
bellied Go-away Birds which proved to have a very placid demean-
our.

The black billed male White-bellied Go-away Bird
It was while catching White-bellied Go-away Birds that I no-
ticed how one bird of each pair had a black bill and, the other, a
greenish yellow bill. As a result I wrote in the Avicultural
Magazine , 1972, 78, 37 - 38 and 78, 185, suggesting that bill colour
could be a way of sexing the White-bellied Go-away Bird. In the
East African Natural History Society Bulletin , May - June 1977,
two members wrote about having seen a pair of these birds feeding
young at the nest, assisted by a third bird. One of the trio had what
they described as a &amp;quot;pea green&amp;quot; bill. The other two, I presume, had

black bills. Their observations brought a comment in the Septem-
ber - October 1977, Bulletin , from Dr. Leslie Brown who wrote that
he too had noted the difference earlier that year while he was
detained as a suspected spy in Somalia. He added that he thought
that the green billed birds were &amp;quot;slightly smaller.&amp;quot; The green billed
birds, inexplicably missed by Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1957)
and others, had. Brown wrote, been recorded by Archer and Godman
(1961) who cited Mearns that &amp;quot;the bill of young females is said to
be black but that of adults green or yellowish green.&amp;quot; Presumably,
Mearns was referring to adult females. I would describe the bill as
more yellow than green but perhaps the colour varies. The adult
male has a black bill as also do immature birds of both sexes. I have
seen several live nestlings all of which had black bills. In the
National Museum in Nairobi, the skin collection includes an all-
white adult, labelled as a female, with the bill pink tinged with
green. The question of whether pairs of Great Blue Touracos are
assisted at the nest by a helper, was among points which Mhorag
Candy listed as requiring further study. The assistance of a helper
at the nest has been recorded in species such as barbets and bee-
eaters. Usually, though not always, the helper is a young unmated
male from an earlier brood.

BREEDING THE RAJAH LORY AT PALMITOS PARK

By Rosemary Low (Gran Canaria)
The Black Lory Chalcopsitta atra atra has been irregularly
imported from New Guinea since the 1970&apos;s but sadly never achieved
greater popularity. It is now found mainly in collections of Lory
specialists. The sub-species insignis , known as the Rajah Lory, was
extremely rare in aviculture until the late 1980's when a few small
consignments reached Europe. A few breeding successes have
occurred, although I am not aware of any in the UK. In the breeding
centre of Palmitos Park, Gran Canaria, seven young have been
reared from one pair in the past twelve months. This article
describes their rearing.
The parents are kept in an enclosed building, with large sky-
lights, which contains many pairs of lories and Amazons. The lory
cages measure 2 m long, 80 cm wide and 1 m high and are suspended
1 m off the ground on metal staging. The floor is concrete and the
area is hosed down daily.
Diet consists of nectar, either Milupa baby cereal and honey
and/or Nekton-Lori (Nekton Produkte, Pforzheim, Germany) which
is offered fresh twice daily (6.30 am and 12.30 pm). It is of a thin
consistency. Fresh fruit is offered once daily, more often when
young are in the nest. Each pair receives a whole apple daily (cut
in half), or a pear or banana, or seasonally available fruits such as
guavas. During the three or four months of the year when the fruit
of the prickly pear cactus is available, this is the main fruit offered
to most lories, as they relish it more than most others.
In the breeding centre are four insignis; a true pair and; a few
cages away, separated by pairs of Black-capped Lories, two fe-
males. In both cages, eggs were produced for the first time in 1992.
The female of the true pair had laid her first two eggs by 19 April;
they hatched on 13 and 14 May, giving a minimum incubation
period of 25 days for the second egg. The newly hatched chicks
weighed 5g and 6g. They had dark grey down, dark feet and dark
brown beaks. The second chick died on the sixth day (cause
unknown). The other chick was therefore removed.. Single hand-
reared chicks of Chalcopsitta species are slower to reach independ-
ence and easily become imprinted on people. I was therefore
pleased that it had as a companion a single Yellow-streaked Lory
Chalcopsitta scintillata which was twice rejected by the parents

(although they reared the older chick).
The insignis and the scintillata were not easy to wean and made
food soliciting calls and bobbed their heads for months afterwards,
whenever they saw me. The insignis perched for the first time at
67 days and on the same day fed by itself - a very late age for a lory.
Thenceforth it readily consumed the warm rearing food and spoon-
feeding ceased. It then weighed 215 g. Its peak weight was 220g
from days 70 to 74. At 83 days it weighed 213 g. It left the hand-
rearing room at 91 days.
About four weeks after this chick was removed from the nest the
female laid again. The two eggs first seen in the nest on 21 June
hatched on 12 and 14 July. Unless the nest-box is checked daily the
day of egg-laying may be unknown because these birds have a habit
of sitting innocently outside the box when they are aware that
someone is approaching. These two young were reared by the
parents and left the nest at about 82 days. They had been fitted with
7.5 mm rings at 23 and 21 days.
In 1993 the female laid on 7 and 10 January. As the two females
laid at the same time, the eggs were transferred to their nest. One
egg, presumably the second, hatched on 3 February, to give an
incubation period of 24 days. The chick was removed for hand-
rearing on 8 March because it had been plucked naked. It then
weighed only 80 g. It quickly gained weight - 105 g on 15 March,
14lg on 22 March, 150g on 29 March, 187 g on 5 April. On 9 April
it was removed from the brooder to a cage and given the opportunity
to feed itself with the warm rearing food. This it did at once and
was never fed again. When chicks start to feed on their own I
always check their crops after offering warm food in a dish - usually
about five times daily. If they do not feed on their own, i spoon-
feed them. But this was not necessary with this chick. Never again
did I have to feed it. In the middle of April I placed it in the cage
of a weaned Duivenbode&apos;s Lory in the hand-rearing room and the
two were instant friends. They left the hand-rearing room on 30
April. On 19 April its weight was 183 g.
Meanwhile, the breeding pair of insignis had two more eggs, laid
on 11 February and probably 13 February. The first egg hatched
after 25 days and the second on the following day, 9 March,
probably after 24 days. I was again concerned that they were not
growing well and on 20 March removed them for hand-rearing.
Their weights were as follows, the first weight being that of the day
after their removal from the nest:

These two young were totally independent at the age of only 45
days. After 60 days they were not handled at all and it was with a
little difficulty that I weighed them at 70 days. They were
unfriendly, lunging and biting. Two young Black-capped Lories
with whom they had been reared, did not behave in such a hostile
way. At this age the insignis were beautiful, with deep mauve
rumps and brick red under the wings. For about two weeks after
they commenced to feed themselves it was necessary to wash their
head feathers; apart from this, a daily spray with warm water kept
their plumage in good condition. They had been ringed at the ages
of 17 and 16 days, also with 7.5 mm rings.
Lory chicks are hand-reared on a mixture of Milupa baby cereal
and Nekton-Lori blended with bottled water. Sometimes fresh, ripe
papaya is included. After the young are two or three weeks old
wheat germ cereal is added to the mixture. When they are seven or
eight weeks I also add a little of our home-made rearing food which
consists of hard-boiled egg, carrot, six-grain cereal bread and low-
fat cheese.
At the time of writing, mid-May, another chick has hatched from
two eggs which were first seen on 12 April. One egg was slightly
dented, resulting in early embryo death. The other hatched on 5
May. On 7 May the egg of a Black-capped Lory which had had to
be removed from the nest, hatched in the incubator. I placed the
chick in the insignis nest as soon as it hatched. It was accepted at
once. The insignis chick is now 12 days old and weighs 30g with

food in the crop.
In four months the pair have produced four young in three
clutches. Assuming that two of the young are males, they will
eventually be paired with the two females. Meanwhile, the females
will probably again be used as foster parents.
The striking colour scheme of the Rajah Lory and the contrast-
ing colours, compared with the more commonly kept lories, might
result in it having more popular appeal than the Black Lory.
However, both sub-species need the attention of more Lory breed-
ers if they are to survive in aviculture.

THE PRESIDENT'S GARDEN PARTY 1993
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997430724137931" page_id="56294273"  page_num="181" year="" vol="">
On Sunday, 18th July, about a hundred members and their guests
were received and welcomed by our President, Ruth Ezra, and
Vice-President, Raymond Sawyer, at their home in Surrey where
the Garden Party has been an annual event for many years. The day
was cool and dull but the weather did nothing to mar our enjoyment
of seeing the lovely gardens at Chestnut Lodge and the superb
collection of exotic birds in beautifully planted aviaries. There is
always something new to be seen and admired and this year was no
exception for another large aviary had been built. It is surrounded
by beds of magnificent roses and many varieties of clematis and
other climbers all of which were helping to create ideal and
attractive accommodation for Hoopoes, bred last year at Chestnut
Lodge, and Touracos. Members were delighted to find many
familiar species like Royal, Emerald and Splendid Starlings, Bee-
eaters, Kingfishers, Woodpeckers, Avocets, Red-breasted Geese
etc. which had been in the collection for several years. The softbill
connoisseurs were excited to see several new and exquisite acqui-
sitions and the parrot enthusiasts to find Lutino Princess of Wales
and Crimson-winged Parrakeets in the collection. Many of the
birds, including Hoopoes, Kookaburras, Pink-crested and Fischer&apos;s
Touracos, Black-winged Stilts, Avocets, Masked Lapwings, Black-
eared Woodpeckers, Beautiful and Black-naped Fruit Pigeons and
many waterfowl species, were breeding or had bred. The almost
incredible number of breeding successes is another reflection of
Raymond Sawyer&apos;s unique natural aptitude for aviculture in all its
aspects. The rain desisted for most of the afternoon, long enough
for tea to be held on the lawn but not long enough for an adequate
vote of thanks to be proposed to our hosts. It is my pleasure to thank
them here. Ed.

The African Pied Starling Spreo bicolor is endemic to South
Africa and occurs in Cape Province, Bechuanaland, Transvaal,
Orange Free State, Northern Natal and Northern Zululand, but is
absent from the eastern coastal regions (Mackworth-Praed &amp; Grant
1963, Prozesky 1974). Less glamorous than many of its relatives
the Pied Starling is nevertheless a handsome bird of a bronzy dark
brown colour above relieved by a buffy-white lower belly and white
under tail coverts. Especially distinctive is the bright yellow base
to the lower mandible and the yellow gape of adult birds. In the
wild Pied Starlings are gregarious and are usually found feeding in
flocks on the ground in open areas with scattered trees. The birds
are colonial breeders, nesting in holes in river banks or buildings,
and sub-adult and juvenile group members help the parents in
feeding young in the nest (Craig 1987, 1988).
One of the author&apos;s research interests in co-operative breeding
in the related Chestnut-bellied Starling Spreo pulcher (Wilkinson
1982) led to the decision to import a group of Pied Starlings direct
from Tygerberg Zoo for study at Chester. Three pairs of African
Pied Starlings were received in March 1991 and released into the
free-flight area of the Zoo&apos;s Tropical House after their statutory
quarantine. Five of the birds, two males (colour-banded O + Y, and
O + M) and three females (W + Y, W + LB and W + M) were
received as adults but one male (O + LB) was still immature. At that
time other birds sharing the free-flight area of the Tropical House
included Speckled pigeons Columba guinea. Emerald Doves Chal-
cophaps indica , Laughing Doves Streptopelia senegalensis , Red-
backed Mousebirds Colins eastanotus. Red-eared and Chinese
Bulbuls Pynonotus jocosus and P. sinensis, White-rumped Shamas
Copsychus malabaricus, Amethyst Starlings, Cinnyricinclus
leucogaster. Emerald Starlings Lamprocolius iris and Asian Glossy
Starlings Aplonispanayensis. The birds had access to our standard
softbill mixture (minced beef rubbed with biscuit flour, grated
hard-boiled egg, grated carrot blended with commercial insectile
food), chopped fresh fruit in season, and live food. They were
particularly fond of live foods and in addition to the mealworms,
locusts and crickets provided, would forage on the Tropical House

floor in search of any naturally occurring food items. This predis-
posed them to disease risks - especially, as we discovered later, to
infection by gapeworms Syngamus trachea . One female died soon
after release into the Tropical House free-flight with pericarditis.
The first breeding attempt was made soon after their arrival with
a pair nesting in a wooden starling-type nest-box located high up on
one of the supporting pillars of the Tropical House. Chicks had
hatched by 14 July 1991 when the birds were observed carrying
mealworms to the nest-box. Careful observations during fifteen
half-hour periods for the next twelve days indicated that only two
birds fed the chicks. There were the male O+M and female W+LB.
Feeding visits to the box ranged from 2 to 12 per observation period
with a total of 54 feeding visits recorded for the male O+M and 38
by the female W+LB. Only on three recorded visits was the identity
of the feeding bird not obtained. Craig (1983) reported adult birds
helping by feeding chicks at another pair's nest but subsequently
reported this as unusual (Craig 1987). During the nesting period no
territorial defence of the nesting area was observed by O+M or
W+LB. The three males O+M, O+Y and O+LB fed amicably
together on mealworms thrown onto the ground just below the nest
area. However the female W+M was never seen in the nest area.
During this period the male O+Y was seen to feed W+M and these
were carrying nest material (long grass stalks) to another nest-box
some 20 feet away from the active nest. The breeding male O+M
was heard several times singing during this period. This song was
accompanied by his raising his crown feathers to give a peaked
appearance to his cap - a behaviour not noted in any other Spreo
species. Towards the end of the nesting period the parents became
very agitated and alarm called frequently. This nesting attempt
ended when on 26 July the female W+LB was found below the nest,
its leg joined by a piece of frayed nylon twine to that of the twelve-
day old chick. The birds were caught but the chick, which was
found to have fractured its leg, subsequently died. The adult female
recovered but was obviously shocked by the incident. Although
O+M was then seen to carry mealworms into the nest-box no chick
calls were heard and neither parent flew to the nest on the following
day.
Subsequent observations on 10 August confirmed Craig&apos;s report
(1988) of 'allofeeding&apos; (the feeding of one adult bird by another)
when the adult male O+M was seen to be fed by the younger male
O+LB. On the following day W+LB appeared interested in re-
nesting and at least four nest-boxes were being investigated by

different Pied Starlings. The male O+Y disappeared from the
Tropical House at some time during December 1991. It was not
until 11 January 1992 that the Pied starlings were again seen
carrying livefood to a nest box. &apos; White&apos; mealworms (those that had
recently shed their skins) were preferred by the adults for feeding
their chicks and a large billful of these would be gathered before
flying to the nest. This was more accessible than the previously
used box and, when checked on 14 January, was found to contain
three large nestlings. Because we had lost chicks from the related
Superb Spreo Starlings Spreo superbus from gapeworm Syngamus
trachea infection and the male parent O+M had been seen coughing
(often symptomatic of gapes) we gave the chicks a precautionary
injection of Ivomec. The female W+LB was taking the greater
burden of feeding the chicks. Of thirty observed feedings 23 were
made by W+LB but only seven by O+M. This contrasted with the
first nesting attempt when the male fed the chicks more often than
the female and reflected the poor condition at this time of the male
- no doubt exacerbated by the stress of caring for the chicks. The
male O+M was caught up and also given an Ivomec injection. On
26 January the nest was checked to find only one chick still alive,
another recently dead and the third missing. The surviving chick
had no food in its crop and was taken for hand-rearing but it died
on the following day. Both parents were then caught up for
veterinary treatment but the male failed to respond and died at the
end of the month. Post-mortem examination indicated air-sacculitis
and peritonitis. Escherischia coli was found on culture. Post-
mortem examination of two nestlings recorded parasitic pneumonitis
as the cause of death.
The remaining three Pied Starlings were then trapped up and a
pair housed in one of the upper aviaries on the balcony of the
Tropical House, the unpaired female being housed with a commu-
nity of birds in one of the lower aviaries. The pair in the upper
aviary soon nested. These were the female W+LB which had
previously hatched chicks with a new male O+LB. A hollow log
was used as a nest-box. When the nest was checked on 9 April, four
eggs were seen, on 12 April only three remained, one having been
thrown out of the nest. On 20 April a chick and two unhatched eggs
were observed. The chick was fed by both parents with mealworms,
morio worms, wax-moth larvae, and locusts. This chick fledged on
13 May and when seen to be feeding itself was removed from the
aviary on 1 June. This youngster was later surgically sexed as a
male and introduced to the unpaired female. Following the removal

of the first-brood youngster the parents immediately re-nested.
The first egg of the second clutch was seen on 4 June and the full
clutch of four eggs on 18 June. Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1963)
describe the eggs of Pied Starlings as bluish-green occasionally
with rufous speckling. The eggs laid by the female at Chester were
bluish-green evenly speckled with rufous brown. By 20 June three
chicks had hatched and four were seen when the box was checked
on 22 June. This suggests that the incubation period is 15 to 16 days
which agrees with the Starlings at a site near Bloemfontein. On
checking the box on 6 July, two of the chicks were seen to have
grossly deformed legs. The chicks were removed and humanely
destroyed. The same problem became apparent with the two
remaining chicks and on 16 July these were also humanely de-
stroyed so ending this nesting attempt. The aetiology of the leg
deformities of the nestlings was not discovered. Subsequently the
male parent exhibited locomotor paralysis and also had to be
destroyed. Again no cause was apparent. Although only one chick
was reared successfully the real gain from our experience with
these Starlings was in teaching us how difficult it can sometimes be
to establish birds in aviculture. There is a real need for co-
ordinated breeding programmes to be developed for non-endan-
gered softbills including related starlings if only to lay the founda-
tions for any subsequent programmes involving threatened species.
The breeding of the African Pied Starling Spreo hicolor at
Chester Zoo in 1992 is believed to be the first success in Great
Britain. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in this country is
asked to inform the Honorary Secretary.

WHAT DO MINIVETS EAT?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998881473684211" page_id="56294278"  page_num="186" year="" vol="">
By L. Gibson (Portland, Oregon)
I recently obtained a pair of Scarlet Minivets Pericrocotus
flammeus. They proved to be the most dietary conservative and
stubborn birds I have ever kept and after three weeks would still not
look at anything that was not wriggling, with the result that I soon
ran out of livefood. When they were hungry, which was frequently,
they set up a high-pitched clamour and fluttered their wings like
nestlings. I was waiting desperately for another large shipment of
mealworms when I began to think how much these birds, with their
large heads and bills, resemble kingfishers. The next step was
obvious.
In a local marshland creek I caught large numbers of mosquito
fish Gambusia affinis and put several in the Minivets&apos; large water
dish. The reaction was instantaneous. Both birds perched on the
rim and began to scoop out the fish. The cock stabbed wildly and
caught one fish for every six to seven tries (he later improved).
However, the hen had done this before and expertly lifted fish out
with a sideways sweep of her bill. She was successful at least eight
out of ten times. When some mealworms were later put into the
cage, the hen ate three mosquito fish first. Fish under V 2 &amp;quot; (13 mm)
were ignored.
The Minivets&apos; food intake was checked and it was found that
they were both consuming an astounding 64% of their body weight
daily. They weighed 30 g and each was eating more than 300 large
mealworms a day. The Minivet is an inactive bird and these two
just sat on the perch (in an indoor cage) between feedings, but both
were in the middle of moulting.
The little guppy-sized fish were offered to all the other birds and
were eaten by a Blackbird T. merula,a Shama C. malabaricus and
a Siberian Blue Robin Erithacus cyanea. The first two were
inefficient fishers and the Shama could only catch fish in a very
shallow dish with 1 / 2 &amp;quot; (13 mm) or less of water. The tiny but long-
legged Siberian Robin looked as if he was familiar with fish and
was adept at flicking them out of the dish. Fish are now a regular
item in the diet of the latter two birds as well as the hen Minivet
which still will not eat non-livefood.
Less than a month after I obtained it, the male Minivet had
massive haemorrhages in both lungs, began to cough up blood, and

died soon afterwards. A large intestinal roundworm (41 mm) was
found wandering out of place in its abdominal cavity. The bird had
been sprightly and apparently healthy right up to within three hours
of its death. This was the only worm seen in the male and no
parasite ova had been seen in several previous examinations of
either bird&apos;s droppings. Newly imported birds usually eat raven-
ously especially if they are moulting. Another cause of ravenous
food consumption is worms, either roundworms or tapeworms. The
hen Minivet was belatedly given a single dose of approximately 1
mg Vermox and over the following two days she passed dozens of
immature roundworms. The largest was 1&amp;quot; (25 mm) long. When
intestinal worms are very crowded, maturity is delayed and there is
no egg production. This example shows that a negative faecal
examination cannot be relied upon. In fact it is usually easier to
prove the presence of intestinal parasites by treatment - no equip-
ment is needed - than it is to find their ova. When checked two
weeks later, the hen was found to have settled finally on a daily food
consumption of 32% of her weight - half the original intake!

the wild in eastern and south-eastern Australia and Tasmania. They
are however relatively little known in Europe having been imported
only infrequently. Chester Zoo received two pairs of Musk Lorikeets
from Rotterdam Zoo in November 1986. Shortly after their arrival
in December one of the males died, leaving a pair and a single
female. The birds were originally housed in one of the indoor
aviaries of the Parrot House. Our lorikeets are fed on a diet which
includes chopped fruit (apple, grapes, pears), grated carrot, a small
amount of soaked seed, and a commercial sunbird nectar formulat-
ed by Special Diet Services. Previously we have used other
commercial nectars and various home-made formulae but find the
present nectar convenient and satisfactory.
In February 1987 the first signs of breeding were observed with
the female spending long periods inside one nest box. The Musk
Lorikeets were originally supplied with two nest boxes each meas-
uring 25 x 25 x 25 cm with a circular entrance hole. A layer of
compacted wood shavings was placed inside each box. When the
box was checked on 1st March a single egg was seen but on 12th
March this egg was found on the floor of the aviary, broken with a
part-formed chick inside. Three days later the pair were observed
copulating and showing interest in the second nest box. However,
preference switched back to the original box and on 26th March the
female was noted to have spent the day inside it. On 24th April the
female was out of the box and chick calls were heard. Calls
continued from the box until 22nd May but on the following day
there were signs of something being wrong with the adults paying
no attention to the nest box. The nest box was found to be very
damp and contained a dead chick. Again the box was cleared out
and filled with a layer of fresh shavings and on 10th June the
behaviour of the female indicated that she had started sitting on a
third clutch. On 17th June the box was checked when the female
was out feeding and a clutch of two eggs was seen. Chicks were
heard calling from the box on 6th July and checking the box on 10th
July revealed that there were two. Sadly one of these was found

dead and decomposed in the box on 15th July. This body was
removed by the keeper but the second chick was discovered dead
four days later.
On 16th August 1987 the breeding pair were moved to one of the
outside Lory aviaries. These aviaries are 3.8 m long x 2.3 m wide
x 2.4 m high with a smaller indoor area of 1.8 m long x 1.2 m high
and 2.4 m high which is heated with an infra-red lamp in the colder
periods of weather. The birds were supplied with a new nest box
18 cm x 18 cm x 45 cm and wood shavings were used again as a nest
substrate. On 18th March 1988 the female started sitting and on
15th April chick calls were heard. On 24th April inspection of the
nest box when the female was out feeding revealed one chick and
two unhatched eggs. Because of the nest becoming so damp during
previous nesting attempts, the nest litter was removed and replaced
with fresh shavings on 9th May. At that time the chick was covered
with green pin feathers. On 16th May the red eye stripe was
developing. On 26th May the parents were seen &apos;encouraging&apos; the
chick to fledge but it was not until 10th June that it emerged only
to be pestered aggressively by its parents.
The fledgling was removed and housed in a box cage where it
learned quickly to feed on nectar and fruit. This was the first chick
to be reared successfully at Chester. Inspection of the nest box
revealed two fresh eggs which explained the adults&apos; hurry to be rid
of the chick from their previous brood. On 15th June one of these
eggs was thrown out of the nest. It was addled as was the one
remaining. This was removed and the nest-litter changed again.
The female quickly re-laid making a third clutch for the year,
commencing incubation on 30th June. On 3rd August a chick and
an unhatched egg were found but this chick was dead when a change
in behaviour of the parents alerted the keeper to check the nest.
In 1989 the first clutch was laid in January, the female beginning
incubation on 28th January. On 6th February two eggs were present
but one of these was found on the aviary floor on 21st February. It
was clear and checking the nest box on the same day revealed no
sign of the second egg but the remains of a dead chick. On 12th
March the female was in the box all day and on 15th March two eggs
were seen. Concern was felt that the parents were trying to rear
chicks too early in the year in poor weather conditions and the
decision was taken to remove the eggs for artificial incubation.
Only one of these was fertile and this hatched on 4th April but the
chick died shortly afterwards. Meanwhile the nest box had been
removed to discourage the adults from re-nesting but as they then

persisted in trying to dig a tunnel below their waterbowl we
returned the box on 22nd April. By 4th May the female was again
in the box all day and four days later a clutch of two eggs was found,
the third clutch for 1989. The nest box was not checked again until
29th May when one of the eggs had hatched. At that time the normal
diet of the parents was supplemented with chopped mealworms,
crickets, tomato and lettuce. On 5th June there were two healthy
chicks but on the 14th only one remained. This was plump and well
grown being 9 - 10 cm in length. The nest litter was changed but
it was four hours before the female re-entered the nest. However,
the chick continued to thrive and the nest litter, which was again
very wet, was changed on 30th June. At that time the chick,
approximately one month old, was first seen peering out of the nest
box but it did not fledge until 25th July when it was 8 weeks old.
Both parents were seen feeding the fledgling on the following day
but on 31st July the chick was found dead on the aviary floor. No
injuries were apparent and a post-mortem examination indicated
the cause of death to have been enteric infection.
Two weeks later the female was again spending long periods in
the nest box which, when checked on 16th August, held two eggs
- a fourth clutch for 1989. On 3rd September two chicks were seen
in the box and the diet of the adults was again supplemented with
mealworms, crickets and chopped tomato. Previously when two
chicks had hatched one had died early in the nestling period.
Therefore the nest was checked daily and if a problem became
apparent with one of the chicks it would be removed for hand-
rearing. This time the younger chick grew rapidly and by 13th
September was of similar size to its older sibling. As before the
nest litter was changed when necessary, and was renewed three
times before the chicks fledged on 23rd October. They were just
over seven weeks of age and, from the aggressive behaviour of their
parents towards them, it seemed that they had been forced out of the
nest prematurely. The chicks had to be removed from the aviary
and were held in a double brooder and offered a similar diet to that
of their parents. However, neither chick was keen to feed and so
they were given liquidised fruit from a syringe for a few days until
they began to feed themselves.
In 1990 the first egg of the first clutch was laid on 25th or 26th
March and a second egg on 28th March. A recently hatched chick
was seen on 18th April and a second chick on 20th April. One of
these chicks fledged on 5th June but, because of parental aggres-
sion towards this chick, both chicks were removed from the aviary

and fed on a diet of liquidised fruit, nectar and soaked seed
supplemented with crickets and mealworms. The parents did not
re-nest immediately but a second clutch of two eggs was laid in
early September 1990. Two eggs were observed on 5th September
but the female was out of the box for most of the day on 22nd
September when both eggs had disappeared. A third nesting
attempt was made in October, one egg was seen on the 15th October
but this had disappeared when the box was checked twelve days
later.
Nesting began early in 1991 with the pair laying their first egg
on the 7th January followed by a second two days later. The
embryos in both eggs died during early incubation but the eggs were
left with the pair in the hope that this would delay their re-laying
until better weather later in the year. As the birds often roost in
their box we preferred to do this rather than remove their box. On
checking the box on 1st March two eggs were seen which from their
clean white colour were judged to be the recently laid eggs of a
second clutch. Neither egg hatched. One died on pipping and the
other was infertile. A third clutch was started in April with the first
egg laid on 10th April and the second on 13th April. Disaster struck
when the female was found dead on 17th April but both eggs were
hastily moved into an incubator. The breeding male died a few days
later. Post mortem examinations indicated that both adults had
died from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. On candling the eggs one
proved to be fertile and this hatched in the incubator on 7th May.
The bird was hand-reared on a diet based on Robinsons &apos;Beef and
Vegetable&apos; and &apos;Summer Fruit Salad&apos; baby foods. At about a month
old it began sampling the liquid baby food from a bowl but
continued to be spoon fed until six weeks old from when it fed
itself. When it became about eight weeks old the chick was
gradually transferred from the baby food mix to a diet of nectar and
fruit. The chick weighed just over 3 g when it hatched and grew
steadily and then rapidly, reaching 60 g when it was about six and
a half weeks old (Fig 1). On hatching the chick had sparse long
down feathers on the body and head and when a week old it was
covered with long dense white down. The eyes began to open when
the chick was two weeks old. Feather sheaths on the body began to
open after four weeks but even after six weeks a lot of grey down
was still present on the chick. The bird was returned to the Zoo
when it was nine weeks old but, with the change in environment, it
reverted to requiring some hand-feeding and had to be weaned back
to independence. This bird proved to be a male but it died in April

box to candle their eggs (in case one had been sexed incorrectly) we
were disappointed to find four clear eggs. Both females had laid
together indicating the superiority of surgical sexing to behaviour-
al observation in this instance. Although we can claim a first
breeding of this species at Chester, and seven chicks have fledged
since June 1988, we cannot really claim success. We started off
with four birds in 1986 and six years later, with losses through
deaths and birds missing through escapes and perhaps thefts, with
three birds all of which were females bred at Chester. These were
sent to Rotterdam Zoo in November 1992 to join their group of
Musk Lorikeets. Hopefully these notes may assist aviculturists to
establish this species for our future enjoyment.

With the opening of the new McCormick Bird House in May
1991 the Lincoln Park Zoological Gardens began a new era of
captive avian husbandry, management and public education. Gone
were the antiquated, shallow glass-fronted cages that lined the
walls surrounding the single naturally planted exhibit known as the
&amp;quot;free flight&amp;quot;. Although this 90 year old building has always been
popular with our visitors for its easy viewing of a large number of
birds, it could not achieve the conservation and education goals of
the zoo. The two year renovation project involved gutting the
building&apos;s interior and constructing ten unique habitats depicting
marsh, seashore, tropical and savannah environments. Our educa-
tional message could now focus on habitat preservation not just
individual species protection. With appropriately planted, natu-
rally lit exhibits, the birds adapted easily to these habitats and
breeding of many species occurred much sooner than expected.
The following are some highlights of these first two years of
captive management and propagation.
Panamanian birds
Although most of the species in the collection were received
from other zoological parks, a collecting trip to the former area of
the Canal Zone in the Republic of Panama was undertaken in
February 1991. With the assistance of Dr. Nate Gale, Summit
Gardens and INRENARE (the Panama interior department), Dr.
Dennis Meritt and the author constructed five aviaries in a densely
forested area of Summit Gardens. Mist nets were set for 15 days in
early mornings and evenings. Permission had been granted for us
to collect up to twenty species all common in the Canal Zone.
Collected birds were put in the aviaries and monitored for food
consumption and general health. On 21 February , 83 birds of 13
species were transported to Miami, Florida where the zoo had
rented a private quarantine station and staffed it with bird depart-
ment personnel. Additionally, several White Tipped and Ruddy
Ground Doves were sent to a federal quarantine facility. After a 30
day quarantine, 81 of the 83 birds survived and were shipped to
Lincoln Park Zoo. Some of these birds were subsequently sent to
other zoos, but of those that remain at Lincoln Park the following

have attempted to nest but have not yet been successful. Interest-
ingly, one pair did adopt two Black-striped Sparrow chicks shortly
after they fledged. The parent sparrows showed only moderate
interest in their chicks as they began to nest again. The chicks were
then seen approaching the grosbeaks displaying typical begging
behaviour. Both grosbeaks foraged for live food and fed the chicks.
Other significant breedings
Lincoln Park Zoo has a long history of breeding Nicobar Pigeons
Caloenas nicobarica. From 1976 to 1988 the zoo raised 74
Nicobars and maintained a colony of 15-20 birds. In the new
facility, a colony of 6 - 8 birds has already produced 8 offspring.
Pinon Imperial Pigeons Duculapinon nested in the same exhibit as
the Nicobars and raised three chicks. In a separate tropical
enclosure, Jambu Fruit Doves Ptilinopus jambu hatched a chick for
the first time in early 1993. Other breedings in 1991 and 1992
include Crested Wood Partridge Rollulus roulroul Sun Bittern

SECOND GENERATION BREEDING OF GREATER
HILL MYNAHS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990012054054054" page_id="56294287"  page_num="195" year="" vol="">
By Debra and Martin Bourne (Manchester)
It is increasingly important to breed exotic birds in captivity,
not only in case they become, as is probable, unavailable from the
wild in the future, but also so that captive strains can be maintained
for the enjoyment of both aviculturists and the general public. The
availability of captive bred birds also decreases the demand for
wild caught individuals and is important for the possible reintro-
duction into the wild, if necessary, in the future. Although it seems
unlikely that the Greater Hill Mynah will fall into this last category,
it is a bird much appreciated by many people for its friendliness and
talking abilities as a pet. It also makes a very satisfying aviary bird.
Two Greater Hill Mynahs Gracula religiosa were acquired from
a local pet shop in 1988. As they turned out on surgical sexing to
be of the same sex, one was swapped for a bird known to be of the
opposite gender. The pair are kept in an aviary 20 ft. long by 12 ft.
across and 8 ft. high in the centre, the peaked roof being completely
covered with rigid, transparent plastic sheeting. They share the
aviary with a trio of Vulturine Guinea Fowl Acryllium vulturinum ,
an occasional pheasant, a pair of Hartlaub&apos;s Turacos Tauruco
hartlaubi and a flock of about 15 Senegal Doves Streptopelia
senegalensis. Interaction between the different species is minimal,
though it is possible that the mynahs predate some of the dove eggs
or young.
The mynahs are fed twice daily on a fruit mush (apples, pears,
grapes, bananas, tomatoes, cucumber, oranges, with soaked sultan-
as and SA37 (Intervet UK)), and a mix of insectivorous food,
minced carrot and brown bread. Mealworms are given in small
quantities throughout the year, with greatly increased quantities
when there are young to be fed. Soaked Diet A (SDS/Mazuri Zoo
Foods UK) has been given for the last 20 months. Occasionally the
mynahs have been observed feeding their young with wild mice.
A nest box is provided for the mynahs ( 8 V 2 ins by 9 V 2 ins base,
17 ins high with a 3 !4 ins diameter circular entrance hole). In
addition to using it for nesting, carrying in a few twigs or pieces of
bark, the mynahs also sometimes sleep in the box in the winter. In
1990 several clutches of two or three eggs were laid and incubated
for several days each time but no chicks were hatched. In 1991 the

first clutch laid was successfully incubated, with a chick fledging
on 18th June. On 2nd July this youngster was moved into the
adjacent aviary, where the parents could continue to feed it through
the netting, where it was safe from any aggression they might show,
since they were now incubating a second clutch. The single
hatchling of this clutch fledged on 29th July. On the 21st Septem-
ber the older youngster was found dead. Post mortem examination
indicated liver failure. The remaining offspring was surgically
sexed on 19th October by Andrew Greenwood and found to be a
female.
In January 1992 a surgically sexed male, bred in 1990 at
Lotherton Bird Gardens Leeds, was acquired (courtesy of Mr. Bill
Timmis) to form a pair with our youngster, the birds being put into
another aviary, out of the sight but not sound of the original pair.
This aviary which was shared with a pair of Edward&apos;s Pheasants
Lophura edwardsi measures 12 ft. by 9 ft. x 7 ft. high, with the back
and approximately a quarter of the sides and roof covered with
plastic sheeting. A nest box was provided, similar to that described
previously. The diet given was the same as that of the other pair.
The original pair have always been noted to whistle, call and
talk (phrases they have spontaneously copied, tunes they appear to
have picked up and a quantity of scribble talk). Their ability to
mimic separate voices and chosen intonations is surprising. The
young pair have begun to do the same.
In 1992 the original pair laid their first eggs in April, one
hatching on 29th April and fledging four weeks later. Their second
clutch (two chicks) hatched on 23rd June and fledged on 28th July,
one returning to the nestbox to sleep for the first few nights. The
first egg of a third clutch was laid on 4th August, with two chicks
hatched, fledging on 18th and 19th September. As in 1991, the first
youngster was removed into the adjoining aviary before the second
clutch hatched, but we allowed-the youngsters from the second
clutch to remain in the aviary with their parents and the third clutch.
No aggression between the generations was observed.
Meanwhile, the young pair had laid a clutch of two eggs by 3rd
June, but these were found on the ground a few days later. Both had
partially formed embryos. Their second breeding attempt was more
successful, with two chicks fledged on 6th September. One never
flew strongly and died on 17th September, possibly from an air sac
infection. The surviving 1992 hatchlings turned out on surgical
sexing to be four females and one male from the older pair and a
male from the young pair.

Data from earlier clutches are less complete than from later
ones, as we did not want to risk disturbing the birds. It is always
easy for us to tell when the older pair have hatched their chicks, as
the parents become suddenly aggressive towards people coming to
feed them, dive-bombing the heads of the poor human and drawing
blood until we took the precaution of wearing a hat for protection.
The young pair have not behaved like this - so far.
We were very pleased with our 1992 hatchings of this species,
especially with the young pair, our home-bred female from 1991
and a captive-bred male of 1990, successfully hatching and rearing
chicks in their first year of attempted breeding.

Banham Zoo, where a social meeting of the Society was held on
Saturday, 11th September, is one of the most attractive zoos I have
ever visited. Its animals and birds are very well kept in spotlessly
clean, appropriately designed and well constructed accommoda-
tion and, not surprisingly, the zoo is very successful in breeding
rare and endangered species. It was regrettable that only about
twenty members attended the meeting but those who did had a
remarkably enjoyable day. We were shown around, in glorious
sunshine, by David Armitage, the zoo&apos;s manager, who provided us
with an inexhaustible supply of information with considerable
modesty and good humour. The aviaries accommodate a particu-
larly fine collection of owls, several pairs of rare parrots, many
exotic softbills, ducks, cranes, etc. Excellent breeding results have
been obtained with many species including some of the owls and the
Crowned Cranes. Lunch and tea were available in the zoo&apos;s
delightful restaurant where the attractive ambience encouraged us
to linger and chat. We are very grateful to Martin Goymour and
David Armitage for the invitation to the Zoo and for all that they
did to make our visit thoroughly enjoyable.
In the evening some of us were kindly taken by John Lovett to
see, nearby, Roger Cattermole&apos;s lovely aviaries and fine collection
of ducks and rare, exotic softbills. We thank Roger Cattermole for
his kind invitation and John Lovett for making it possible.

The Black-crowned Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax has
been kept at Birdworld Bird Park for several years. Two females
which have been in the collection for the last three years have laid
eggs but neither hen has hatched them. Several eggs were removed
in 1990 and four birds were artificially reared. In 1991 all the eggs
were left with the parent birds but no successful hatchings oc-
curred.
During the artificial incubation of their eggs in 1990 it was
considered that the small yolk compared with albumen size in N.
nycticorax suggested that the eggs needed more detailed attention
during their incubation if they were to hatch successfully. Accord-
ingly several eggs were removed from the nests for artificial
incubation during the 1992 season and some hand rearing was
undertaken. Although there is an extremely limited potential for
captive breeding of N. nycticorax because of the lack of suitable
facilities to house them some notes on the methods used to hand
rear this species at Birdworld are given here in the hope that they
may prove useful to anyone left with the need to hand rear chicks
which have been orphaned.

After hatching the chicks were left to dry out in the hatcher for
about five or six hours before being moved to an already prepared
brooder set at the slightly lower temperature of 36* C. For the early
part of its rearing period the chicks had to be housed inside a small
container padded with kitchen towelling to help support them.
Although the chicks&apos; growth and development are rapid, they
remain immobile and lack sufficient development in their legs and
feet to control their body movements until they are about twenty
days old. Therefore, they require some form of housing container
for at least the first three weeks of their rearing period. The
temperature can be reduced by one or two degrees Celsius every day
after the first few days as their growth and development are fairly
rapid. The lining with paper towelling helps to keep the chick clean
and provides cushioning for the chick to lean against. It also assists
in the monitoring of the chick&apos;s excretion. The towelling is
removed, checked and replaced at every feeding period. As the

chick grows it can be allowed more room to move. From day 14
onwards the chick can be housed in an open topped container with
a heat bulb over one end.
The diet of adult captive N. Nycticorax consists of sprats, ripped
up day old chicks, small mice, minced meat, soaked Zoo A pellets
and occasional live insects. Aquatic seeds and vegetable matter
have also been recorded in the stomach contents of wild birds
(Hancock &amp; Elliott, 1978), but the main part of the diet consists of
animal matter. Captive birds show little interest in eating vegeta-
ble matter.
The diet we used to hand rear N. nycticorax was as follows.
From day 1 to day 4, it consisted of equal parts of pink mice and
tenderised thigh meat of day old chicks. From day 4 onwards the
rib cage of day old chicks was added and the amount of pink mice
was reduced. From day 7 onwards we stopped using pink mice and
used most parts of day old chicks cut into small pieces. The head,
lower legs, outer skin and yolk sack of the day old chicks were
removed and discarded. Only the remainder was fed to young
carnivorous chicks in the rearing room and young birds did not
receive food with outer skin still attached until near the time of
weaning. From day 12 sand eels were added to the bird&apos;s diet. By
day 15, segments of sprat were also added. As the chick approached
the age of weaning it received most items included in the adult diet
and also segments of whole chick without the head, outer skin or
lower legs. Throughout the rearing period Nutrobal, manufactured
by Vetark Ltd., was added to the food as a vitamin/mineral supple-
ment.
From day one four feeds were given daily, with four hour time
intervals between each feed. This was changed to three daily feeds
after the chick&apos;s weight had reached 200 grams at about twelve
days. Three feeds daily were continued with the amount being
adjusted according to the growth rate until the birds became more
difficult to feed when they were about three weeks old.
Weaning was gradual. The chicks ate less voraciously after the
third week. They were then fed only three times a day, making sure
that they received enough during the last feed.
Growth and Development of Chicks
During the first three weeks of the rearing period the following
notes were made on the physical development of the first of the
three chicks to be hatched and reared during 1992.
On being removed from the hatcher the chick had its eyes open
watching the activities around it. However, it had little control of

its movements and stance and needed support to hold its head
upright. It was not until day 4 that the chick could manage easily
to keep its head up without support. After hatching most of the
body was thinly covered with long grey down which became lighter
in colour on the head. This down was evident until the bird was
well covered by feathering when it was about three weeks old. At
the end of its first week the chick had good control over its posture
and movements although for much of the time between feeds the
chick would still rest in a slumped position until it was approached.
The first feather quills were appearing on the shoulders, tertials and
thighs. Flight feather quills were just becoming evident for the
primaries and secondaries on the wing.
Day 10. The feather quills were becoming large on the back,
wings and thighs of the chick and were increasingly evident on the
rest of the body. The chick was alert at feeding time and picked up
food for itself when presented with the food dish. The feet however
were poorly developed and weak.
Day 13. Feathering on the shoulders was breaking through its
quilling to reveal immature brown plumage. The chick was becom-
ing increasingly vocal and called whenever it was approached
instead of, as previously, only at feeding times.
Day 15. Feathering over shoulders, wings, thighs and breast had
broken through its quilling and was showing clearly the chicks
immature brown plumage. Feathering was just starting to break and
show colour around the head and the neck.

Day 20. Feathering over most of the upper body was now clear
of quilling and showing brown and black immature plumage. Wing
feathers were now starting to break through quilling and show
colour. The chick was still reluctant to stand and support its weight
fully on its feet and was therefore moved onto an artificial nest
platform made up of twigs to encourage the feet to grip and exercise
more. Toes were becoming stronger and the feet gripped the new
surface provided. The chick was becoming more difficult to feed,
particularly towards the end of the day at the last feed time. The
accompanying photograph was taken of this bird when it was 20
days old.
The chicks' growth rates were recorded by weighing them every
day at the same time (8.00 am) and always before their first feed.
The body weights of the three chicks in the first three weeks of their
lives are shown in the accompanying graph.

<bodyText confidence="0.879038266666667" page_id="56294294"  page_num="202" year="" vol="">
The artificial rearing of N. Nycticorax is not recommended.
Problems with chicks showing signs of imprinted behaviour and
causing disturbance when introduced to an adult colony are com-
mon. It is surprising that our adult birds have not yet managed to
hatch successfully their own eggs. The shape of the egg and
proportionate size of yolk to albumen in this species make incuba-
tion, and turning in particular, more difficult to achieve successful-
ly when undertaken artificially. If a reasonable level of hatchability
could be achieved N. nycticorax should be given every encourage-
ment to rear its own chicks. Hand rearing should be considered as
a last resort and, if attempted, carried out in a manner likely to
reduce the problems of imprinting as much as possible.

The Golden-breasted Mynah Mino onais , of which there are
three races, is a chunky black and yellow New Guinea species about
24 cm long. It is illustrated in colour on Plate 49 of The Birds of
New Guinea by Beehler, Pratt and Zimmerman. Our birds were
obtained from an importer at the end of 1988. One was slightly
larger than the other and turned out to be the cock of the pair when
they were sexed surgically. They spend each winter indoors and,
in the spring, are transferred to an L-shaped planted aviary 12&apos; high
x 35&apos; long x 10 - 20&apos; wide. The enclosure is provided with a shelter
and also accommodates pairs of Pheasant-tailed Pigeons, Schalow&apos;s
Turacos and Satyr Tragopans.
The mynahs nested in 1989 in the shelter in an open fronted nest
box which was intended for the pigeons. One egg was laid which
they failed to incubate. In the following year they ignored the
conventional type of nest box and, using sticks up to l A&amp;quot; in
diameter, built a nest like that of a Lovebird again in the &apos;pigeons&apos;
nest box. On several occasions they laid light blue eggs similar to
those of Spreo Starlings but less darkly blotched. Some were
hatched but none of the chicks were reared.
In 1991 we attempted to hand rear some of the chicks but our
efforts were unsuccessful as also was an attempt to hatch an egg
under a breeding pair of Greater Hill Mynahs. However, one chick
was reared by its parents and left the nest in September. It was
slightly smaller and paler than the adults. Its breast was black
edged with yellow and its bill was a dull yellow. It was reared on
mealworms, waxmoths and the parents&apos; normal diet of fruit, minced
beef and Orlux softbill food. A similar pattern of events occurred
this year and, at the time of writing (October 1992), there is another
youngster flying with its parents.
Another interesting breeding which occurred in the gardens in
1992 is that of the Greater Coucal or Crow Pheasant Centropus
sinensis a large (50 cm) shiny black member of the family Cuculidae.
Its entire body from head to long tail is shiny black glossed with
purple-blue on the head and chestnut on the wings. Its curved bill
and its feet are black and its eyes are red. It occurs in India and
China and is widespread throughout the Orient.

We obtained a juvenile pair in November 1990. They spent the
winter indoors and, at first, required feeding by hand on their diet
of minced beef, pink mice, chopped day old chicks and chopped
mice all dusted with SA37 which was replaced subsequently when
they were breeding by Stress. In the spring they were transferred,
with a pair of Trumpeter Hornbills, to a large planted flight covered
with 2&amp;quot; mesh plastic-coated chain netting through which, being
deceptively thin, they escaped! The hen was picked up quickly but
the cock remained at liberty for ten days before it was recaptured.
The pair were then placed in a more suitable enclosure 15&apos; deep x
8&apos; high x 6&apos; wide where they spent the summer sun bathing but not
breeding, probably because they were not sufficiently mature.
They disliked the cooler weather when it came and were brought
indoors to spend the winter in a flight 3&apos; x 8&apos; x 6&apos; high.
Their accommodation for the spring and summer of 1992 was an
enclosure 20&apos; deep x 8&apos; high x 8&apos; wide with a grass floor and, at the
rear, a large mock orange bush in which was placed a moorhen&apos;s old
nest in a wire basket. The male built up the nest with fresh shoots
from the bush. The hen was seen in the nest at the beginning of May
and mating took place during the next two weeks. Two eggs were
laid but they disappeared within a week. On 21st June the first of
a clutch of four eggs was laid. Three of these were found on the
aviary floor on 12th July but on 15th July the remaining egg
hatched. Incubation was done solely by the male who also fed the
chick without the assistance of the female. At this time some live
food was consumed in addition to the normal diet. The chick was
dark-skinned and covered with white spikey down. Its eyes were
open after a few days and it became very active. It looked like a
young Turaco with a large gape. The parents became aggressive
and vigorously pecked the head of anyone who entered the aviary.
The chick left the nest on 12th August but did not venture to leave
the bush for another week. The cock alone continued to feed it.
About four weeks later a clutch of six eggs was laid. The male
incubated them for about a week but then abandoned them, The
chick continued to thrive. It was brought in with its parents with
the occurrence of the first frosts in mid October.
These are probably the first successful captive breedings of
these species in this country. Anyone who knows of previous
breedings in the U.K. is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary and
anyone who has previous experience with these species to contact
the authors (phone 0373 830326).

The Lemon-breasted Canary Serinus citrinpectus has been de-
scribed by a number of authors but juveniles have not until now.
Their forehead is dusky grey merging into the pale grey crown, the
mantle and back are sooty grey with blackish feather centres which
result in a streaked appearance, the rump is pale yellow, the upper
tail-coverts are buffy and the tail dusky grey with the outer feathers
with narrow whitish and the inner ones with pale yellow fringes.
The flanks are buffy white, the wing coverts sooty grey with whitish
edges and the flight feathers have pale yellowish edges. The
underparts are buffy with a strong pale orange chrome wash from
the chin to the breast lightly streaked with pale brown. The belly
and under tail-coverts are whitish, the chin is buffy and the under
wing-coverts are grey. The iris is dark brown, the upper mandible
greenish yellow and the lower mandible pale horn-coloured. The
legs and feet are pale pink. The species&apos; range extends from north-
eastern Zululand and southern Mozambique to eastern Zimbabwe.
Grass seeds figure prominently in the diet in addition to termites.
In their natural state only one nest has been recorded. This was seen
by Robson (1990) on 28th October 1988 in the Sodwana State
Forest in Zululand. The nest was constructed of short fibres from
dead creeper stems, bits of hairy leaf and fine chewed bark bound
with caterpillar silk. It was constructed within the fold of a Lala
Palm leaf about 1.6 m above the ground.
The Lemon-breasted Canary had been kept and bred in captivity
before it was described as a species new to science in 1960 but there
are no published records because its keepers failed to report their
success in any avicultural publication. Lawson (1970) described
its captive breeding in 1969 in an ornithological publication.
One of my pairs attempted to breed and constructed a nest in a
bush approximately 1 meter from the ground, but they were unsuc-
cessful in rearing three nestlings. On the 3rd or 4th October a
second attempt was made by the same pair. Three eggs were
incubated by the female alone in a woven wicker finch basket. Both
nests were constructed with coir and lined with moss and feathers.
However as they were housed in a large aviary with a mixed
collection I was a little apprehensive and decided that, if the second
attempt was also fruitless, they would have to be transferred to a

showed interest in a canary nest pan hung about 2.5 m above the
ground.. The base of the pan contained a piece of specially
manufactured &apos;nesting felt&apos; on which the foundation was made. The
nest required much initial building up before the nest proper was
started with the basal mass consisting of seventy eight pieces of
green moss, each being no shorter than 12 rnm and no longer than
30 mm. The central lining contained two hundred and forty nine
strands of coir 50 mm to 140 mm long and the upper lining
consisted of four pieces of Weeping Lovegrass Eragrostis curvula
50 - 90 mm long. The external diameter of the nest was 68 mm, the
internal diameter 45 mm the external depth 40 mm and the internal
depth 35 mm. The three eggs were white with a few odd shaped
spots and short streaks of reddish brown. They were laid on about
25th September and on 8th October two hatched. The birds were
fed on a good finch seed mixture, a regular supply of termites and
a finch/canary soft food mixture to which was added hard boiled
egg, grated carrot, apple, shredded spinach, Swiss chard, SMA
formula for infants and Calsup vitamin powder. On the 22nd
October two young birds left the nest. They were given additional
food items in the form of grass seed sweepings, Guinea grass
Panicum maximum seedheads and Shepherd&apos;s purse Capsella hur-
sa-pastoris. On the 18th October two eggs hatched in the commu-
nal aviary nest and at the time of writing the young birds are still
in the nest. We hope to negotiate soon with the Natal Parks Board
to allow and encourage a captive breeding programme to be
undertaken by members of the Natal Bird Breeders Society whose
objective is to promote the survival of endangered, vulnerable and
rare indigenous species by creating self-sustaining populations in
the wild and in captivity.

THE BALI MYNAH
THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF ZOOLOGICAL

Kevin J. Bell,(Chicago)
Discovered in 1911, the Bali Mynah or Rothschild&apos;s Grackle
Leucopsar rothschildi is the only endemic bird species on the island
of Bali. Little is known of its historic population numbers.
However, even the most optimistic observers over the intervening
years have estimated that the total wild population is less than
1000. Illegal trapping and habitat degradation in the form of human
encroachment have combined to effect a precipitous decline in the
remaining wild flock. The largest recent population estimate was
254 birds in 1981 (van Helvoort, 1985, 1986). However, in 1990
the population reached a shocking low of 18 birds. Since then, it
has recovered slightly, and now (1992) stands at 55 - 60 birds (van
Balen, 1992).
In captivity, its numbers have also fluctuated wildly, but for
different reasons. In many ways, the Bali Mynah represents the
best, and at the same time the worst, example of zoological park
bird husbandry and management. During the late 1960&apos;s and early
1970&apos;s it was one of the most sought-after species. Exact numbers
are not available but conservative estimates indicate that several
hundred wild caught birds were brought into the US, Great Britain,
and continental Europe, in spite of rumours that the species was
becoming increasingly rare in its native Bali. One does not have to
be a population biologist to realise that such a harvest could not be
sustained for long. In 1973, the Bali Mynah was placed on CITES
Appendix 1 and the Endangered Species lists.
Since very little was known about the species captive mainte-
nance or breeding biology, it should not surprise anyone to learn
that the overwhelming majority of these imported specimens disap-
peared within a few years, having never bred. In North America, a
few actually did breed and produce offspring but in most cases the
genealogy was unknown because of faulty or non-existent record
keeping and a penchant for exhibiting the birds in large, mixed-
species flight enclosures where individual identities were easily
lost. In a handful of institutions the Bali Mynah bred all too readily
under totally uncontrolled conditions, creating a space crisis and at

the same time swamping the North American gene pool with
offspring from a single pair or founder line. There was no stud-
book, species survival plan, or species coordinator. The scenario
is now familiar to American zoo curators. Like many other avian
species which are imported in substantial numbers and subse-
quently breed prolifically, the Bali Mynah was transformed within
a few years from an &amp;quot;in" species to an &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; species amongst the
zoos of North America simply because the market for surplus birds
had disappeared.
As a result of this situation, in the late 1970&apos;s and early 1980's
the handful of locations that had produced large numbers of off-
spring discontinued their efforts, and the population ceased ex-
panding. As an unmanaged population the birds in North America
had shown the capacity to sustain themselves in terms of sheer
numbers. The wild population, on the other hand, was in precipi-
tous decline, partly because of the unsustainable harvest which had
allowed western zoos and others to exhibit the species in the first
place. The opportunity for North American zoos to make amends,
and eventually participate in an international restoration project,
occurred in 1983 when the species was included in the American
Association of Zoological Parks and Aquaria&apos;s (AAZPA) first (and
only) Species Survival Plan for Passeriformes. The goal of all
species survival plans is to manage collectively a finite captive
population of individuals in a manner that preserves a maximum
amount of genetic diversity over a long period of time, typically
100 to 200 years. All have as an ultimate objective the reintroduc-
tion or replenishment of their wild counterpart population.
Two questions confronted us: Would the Bali Mynah breed as
well under controlled circumstances as it had randomly? Would it
even be possible to sort the birds out genetically after all those
years? The answer to the latter question was evident only after a
tedious and time-consuming effort to trace the history of several
hundred birds scattered about at more than a hundred locations.
Eventually the database was cleaned up sufficiently to allow an
initial genetic analysis. Not surprisingly, nearly two-thirds of the
live specimens were of partially or totally untraceable heritage. It
was obvious from here forward that we would probably never
achieve what is known as a &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; dataset, devoid of ambiguity.
Nevertheless, during succeeding years the challenge has been to
reduce the impact of those unknown genes by carefully selecting
pairs for breeding, while maintaining adequate growth in the
managed population.

As it turned out, the genetically mandated pairings were often
unsuccessful, with the net result that the population has declined
from about 600 individuals to less than 300 to-day. The quality of
the individuals within that population, however, is considerably
better than it once was, since most of the totally unknown heritage
specimens (dubbed &amp;quot;Brand-X&amp;quot;) have been removed from breeding
situations. With a smaller group it is much easier to monitor the
individual pairs and recombine those that are non-productive. New
genetic material has been and continues to be imported from
previously unrepresented bloodlines maintained in other parts of
the world. As the population begins to climb, we hope to be able
to return some of our bloodlines in exchange.
The overseas portion of the project has evolved into a coopera-
tive affair involving several organizations which have taken major
roles, with substantial commitments, of both human and financial
resources particularly in the last 5 - 6 years. In November 1987 40
captive-raised Bali Mynahs were transported from the U.S. to a
Captive Propagation Centre at the Surabaya Zoo in eastern Java.
Later that year four more birds were added. Our hope was that these
birds, when combined with a small group already breeding at the
zoo, would form a nucleus to provide stock for release in the Bali
Barat National Park on the northwest tip of the island.
In March 1990 a Population Viability Assessment workshop was
held in Bogor, Java, from which several objectives emerged. These
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.927229461538462" page_id="56294302"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
were:
1. Expand the wild population to at least 200 birds as soon
as possible, ultimately reaching 1000 birds, with an additional
1000 birds maintained in captive populations worldwide.
2. Upgrade security and patrols at Bali Barat National Park
recognizing that poaching of the wild birds remains a serious
threat.
3. Supply more birds for release by establishing three new
Captive Propagation Centres (Taman Mini Bird Park, Taman Safari
Indonesia and Bali Barat National Park).
4. Register without penalty all Bali Mynahs illegally held by
private citizens in Indonesia (known as the &amp;quot;Amnesty Campaign&amp;quot;).
5. Develop a public education and awareness campaign both

in Bali and throughout Indonesia.
Although many chicks have been produced at the Surabaya
facility, the survival rate has been very low. Subsequent medical
examinations of the birds revealed the presence in many specimens
of a little-known coccidian parasite, Atoxoplasmosis Isospora spp.

Concern for the health of any birds released into the wild has led to
the construction of a quarantine facility at Bali Barat National
Park, and the formulation of a series of strict medical protocols by
the Veterinary Advisor, Dr. Terry Norton. The staffs at each
captive propagation centre are being trained in captive husbandry,
nutrition, record-keeping and avian medicine.
The first attempt to release captive-bred birds into the wild
population was unsuccessful, but it did at least provide valuable
information that would assist future efforts. In 1988 three captive-
bred birds were transferred from the Surabaya Zoo shortly after
fledging to a pre-release training centre in Bali Barat National
park. Human contact was kept to a minimum and the birds were fed
on a diet of native fruits, berries, and locally available insects.
The initial release in August 1988 resulted in one casualty and
the disappearance of the other two birds. Bas van Helvoort and Bas
van Balen, two ornithologists working on the release project in
Indonesia, felt that significant factors which may have contributed
to its failure were the extremely dry conditions and strong winds at
the time of the release and the release site being located away from
the wild birds roosting site. It was therefore decided that future
releases would be in a more secure area of the park near a known
roosting site. Two other modifications were also implemented 1)
acknowledging the gregarious nature of the species, no fewer than
ten birds would be released at one time and 2) a transponder would
be inserted into all released birds to insure identification, should
they end up in the hands of poachers in the future. On 15 April
1990, the second release began, involving 13 birds, which were
released in several groups over a six day period. Food and water
were supplied for the first few weeks at the release site. Most birds
soon became independent of the provisions and were seen feeding
and roosting with the wild birds. Within a week of the release, pairs
were formed between wild and captive-raised birds. On 3 February
1991 three chicks were fledged from a nest of one of these pairs.
The expansion of the Indonesian captive propagation programme
and the improved medical care (both preventative and diagnostic)
should result in gradually increasing numbers of birds available for
release. Larger, more frequent, releases coupled with upgraded
protection of the birds in the Bali Barat National Park should
provide a favourable environment for the birds to recover. The
most encouraging aspect of the project, however, is the enthusiasm
of dedicated Indonesian nationals who realise the importance of
this task. It is they who provide genuine reason for optimism

Dear Sir,

<bodyText confidence="0.980882405405405" page_id="56294305"  page_num="213" year="" vol="">
Shortly after publication of my article VON DER DECKEN&apos;S
AND JACKSON&apos;S HORNBILLS: TWO SPECIES OR ONE? (Avi-
cultural Magazine, 99, 9, 1993), en route to our Society&apos;s council
and social meetings at Twycross Zoo, I had the opportunity to visit
the Horiman Museum in south-east London. It has, I discovered, an
extensive library, which requires no membership and is open to
everyone, though the librarian at the desk by the entrance was
somewhat intimidating and insisted that we carefully read the
library rules before we were allowed in. It gave me the chance to
consult Birds of Africa , Vol. 3 (Fry, Urban, Keith, 1988), to see
what was written there about these two hornbills and how they were
treated. It seemed that, based broadly on the same information as
that available to the authors of Birds of East Africa (Britton (Ed.),
1980), the opposite conclusion was reached, i.e. in Birds of Africa
Jackson&apos;s is treated merely as a race of Von der Decken&apos;s. Far more
interesting was the plate of hornbill species. An immature male
Von der Decken&apos;s is illustrated showing considerable white spot-
ting on the wing-coverts and the text confirmed that this is the case
with the immature male. That set alarm bells ringing in my head
for it could explain, or partly explain, &amp;quot;all sorts of intermediate
spotted forms&amp;quot; of this (and Jackson&apos;s Hornbill!) in Kenya&apos;s Na-
tional Museum, which Cunningham-van Someren wrote about and
whom I quoted. Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1957) confirmed that
the young male Von der Decken&apos;s Hornbill has &amp;quot;a few white spots
on the outer wing-coverts.&amp;quot; In Laura Paterson&apos;s article (Avicultural
Magazine 98, 44 1993) there was no mention of the young male
showing this spotting and the male in the frontispiece showed none
because, as Laura confirmed to me, the photo showed the adult pair
(the parents). She was kind enough to answer my questions, where
possible, and sent me photocopies of two photos showing the young
male at Leeds Castle. &amp;quot;Yes, it does appear on closer examination
of these prints that the young male showed white spots on the wing-
coverts&amp;quot; she wrote, &amp;quot;but, as you can see from the second print, the
spots were not always obvious.&amp;quot; There appears to have been five
or six spots or other markings, maybe more, some more obvious
than others, on the left wing. In the first photo, eleven or so
reasonably distinct small spots can be seen in a line along the

leading edge of the right wing. This seems more in line with
Mackworth-Praed and Grant&apos;s description than the more spotted
immature male illustrated in Birds of Africa. Presumably, the spots
disappear at the first moult. Laura was unable to confirm whether
the spotting is indeed confined only to young males but could
confirm that both male and female emerged from the nest with
black bills. It took about 5 - 6 months for the male&apos;s bill to start
changing colour.
In the Avicultural Magazine , 99, 61, 1993, Rosemary Low
remarked on our lack of knowledge regarding the status of the Red-
bellied Parrot Poicephalus rufiventris. In Birds of East Africa
(1980), it was stated: &amp;quot;The nominate race is a reasonably common
resident of bushland and woodland in arid and semi-arid country
below 1200 m, being particularly partial to Baobab trees. It occurs
throughout E and NE Kenya from Mandera, Ramu, El Wak and
Wajir west to Moyale, South Horr, Isiolo, Meru, Embu and Kitui,
south through the Tsavo region and Mombasa hinterland to Tangire
NP, Lake Manyara and Lake Natron in NE Tanzania.&amp;quot; This is the
extent of this species&apos; range in East Africa, which includes Uganda,
where it is absent, Kenya and Tanzania, as described above, but not
Ethiopia and Somalia, the other two countries into which this
parrot&apos;s range extends. When I was last in Kenya, in 1986, I was
told about some young Red-bellied Parrots, reared after being
rescued from nests in bulldozed Baobab trees, which were re-
leased by government wildlife officials against the rescuer&apos;s wish-
es, because they could not be legally held in Kenya,despite the fact
that the area was over far west of their normal habitat.
&amp;quot;Almost everyone interested in natural history has at some stage
wanted to get hold of a copy of a specific journal article of their
particular interest.&amp;quot; So reads an announcement in recent issues of
the East Africa Natural History Society, Bulletin . Well, it seems
that the British Library international photocopy service, available
through the British Council, exists to meet this need. The library,
here in Britain, obtains a copy of virtually every serious journal
published and will photocopy any article on request and post it
abroad. Payment for this service is by means of a coupon brought
from a British Council local office abroad. Apparently, the British
Library handles over 3 million requests a year for photocopied
articles. I wonder if this service is available to us here in Britain?

Opened earlier this year, San Diego Zoo&apos;s &apos;Wings of Australa-
sia&apos; exhibit provides visitors with an opportunity to view birds
which cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. Begun in concept
in 1988, &apos;Wings of Australasia&apos; was conceived as an exhibit that
would integrate public animal display and practical bird manage-
ment. Each of the five modules of cages is designed to house
multiple species. Lories have always been a San Diego Zoo
speciality, of course, and 14 of the 23 new aviaries house one
spectacular species after another - including the Tahitian Blue Vini
peruviana, Blue-crowned V. australis and Solitary Phigyssolitarius.
Other eye-catching species and subspecies in the new exhibit are
Bulwer&apos;s Pheasant Lophura bulwesi , Blyth&apos;s Tragopan Tragopan
blythi , Sulawesi Hornbill Aceros cassidix , Guam Kingfisher Hal-
cyon cinnamomina and Eastern Golden-breasted Mynah Mi no anais
orientalis.

An American timber giant and the United States&apos; government
have agreed a plan to protect a population of more than 100 Red-
cockaded Woodpeckers Picoides borealis . Under the agreement,
considered a landmark in environmental co-operation, Georgia-
Pacific Corporation agreed to take steps to prevent damage to the
birds and their nests. The accord broke new ground for it showed
a large company agreeing voluntarily to change its way of doing
business to protect an endangered species, rather than waiting for
government regulations.

Three new bird species have been recorded, including the
Hainan Leaf-warbler Phylloscopus hainanus which was located in
the vicinity of forest edges on Hainan Island, China. Also recently
described is the Cundinamarca Antpitta Grail aria kaestneri from
wet cloud forest, south-east of Bogota, Colombia. The Restinga
Tyrannulet Phylloscartes kronei was discovered in areas of wood-
land edges and secondary growth in south-east Brazil. Meanwhile,
the Cebu Flowerpecker Dicaeum quadricolor, last seen 80 years
ago and believed to be extinct because of high levels of deforesta-
tion, has been rediscovered on the island of Cebu, Indonesia.

A survey earlier this year of the Red-breasted Goose Branta
ruficollis , which is under threat in many parts of its range, revealed
a record 65,000 birds on Bulgarian and Romanian Black Sea
wintering grounds. The need for detailed studies and management
measures to safeguard key sites was highlighted by the survey team.
Proposals for follow-up action are being prepared.
There has been a conservation success story for one of Britain&apos;s
most threatened birds, the Cirl Bunting Emberiza cirlus. Its decline
has been halted and its range expanded, according to a spokesman
for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Brendan McSherry
said that in 1989 there were only 114 pairs, 98% of them along the
south Devon coast. But last year a survey showed 320 pairs and the
species has been confirmed in east Devon for the first time in
several years. Mr. McSherry said set aside land had helped Cirl
Buntings - although the RSPB knew that set aside was not popular
with farmers.

The remaining wild population of Pink Pigeons Nesoenas may-
eri on Mauritius last year enjoyed its best breeding season since
records began in 1976. Even before the final count for the season,
four pairs had laid 20 eggs and 14 young had fledged. The Jersey
Wildlife Preservation Trust has promised to send six young female
pigeons to the island to improve the sex ratio.
Former Director of Centres for the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust,
Professor Janet Kear was awarded the QBE in the 1993 Queen&apos;s
Birthday Honours List for her service to wildfowl conservation.
Janet, who retired earlier in the year, was formerly Curator of the
Trust&apos;s Martin Mere centre. During that time she received a
professorship and Honorary Doctorate (D.Sc.) at Liverpool&apos;s John
Moores&apos; University. During her long career, she published a
number of books. One, &apos;Man and Wildfowl&apos;, was selected as Book
of the Year by the Royal Society for Nature Conservation.

A decade of effort on the part of conservationists has led to
Kuala Gula in the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve becoming a
bird reserve. It is the last area in Peninsular Malaysia capable of
supporting a viable breeding population of Milky Storks Mycteria
cinerea. The reserve is also home to 50% of the Malaysian
population of Lesser Adjutant Storks Leptoptilus javanicus. Be-
tween 43,000 and 85,000 migratory wading birds regularly use the
reserve and adjacent coast.
The conversion into rice fields of almost all the shallow areas of
Lake Bemamba has probably led to a decline in numbers of
Madagasscar Teal Anas bernieri from 120 birds in 1973 to just 10
pairs in a 1992 survey which found that almost all the shallow parts
of the lake had been converted to rice field. The Teal survived in
a marsh that was too saline for rice and it is hoped the area will be
protected by inclusion in a buffer zone for the Tsingy de Bemaraha
World heritage Site.
A 1992 census of the Yellow-eyed Penguin Megadyptes antipo-
des , found 380 pairs on the New Zealand mainland - an increase for
the second successive year. However, numbers of the world&apos;s rarest
Penguin are still below those of five years ago and various conser-
vation efforts, including fencing, renewing vegetation in breeding
areas, establishing reserves and controlling predators will need to
continue for another five to 10 years.
Earlier this year the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare
(UFAW) presented its 1993 Zoo Animal Welfare Innovation Award,
for a new idea or device which improves the welfare of animals, to
the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Martin Mere (Lancs.) centre for its use
of rubber car mats in brooders for duckling and other waterfowl.
The mats make cleaning easier, keep young birds warmer and also
reduce the risk of disease. The rubber pile enables water and waste
to drain away, while at the same time providing a comfortable and
safe surface on which the birds can stand or sit.

After an incubation period of 43 days, two chicks of the South-
ern or Double-wattled Cassowary Casuarius casuarius hatched in
Birdpark Avifauna on 13 June, writes Hans van der Sluis. The hen
laid a total of 13 eggs and 12 were placed in an incubator. Five
hatched but three of the chicks died soon afterwards. The remain-
ing egg was left for incubation by the male Cassowary and a chick
hatched on 13 July, Hans reports that staff... were very pleased to
see that the cock proved to be a good father.&apos; He added that in 1992
a complete clutch disappeared &apos;in a mysterious way&apos; while in the
care of the same bird.

The Avicultural Society was founded in 1894 for the study of British
and foreign birds in freedom and captivity. The Society is international
in character, having members throughout the world.
Membership subscription rates per annum for 1994 as for 1993 : British
Isles #18.00: Overseas #21.00 (plus #6.00 for airmail). (U.K. funds
please). The subscription is due on 1st January of each year and those
joining the Society later in the year will receive back numbers of the
current volume of the AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE.

be sent to:
THE HON. SECRETARY AND TREASURER, THE AVICULTURAL
SOCIETY, c/o BRISTOL ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS, CLIFTON,
BRISTOL, BS8 3HA, ENGLAND.
THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have
not been published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture
of a particular bird or group of birds, or that describe their natural history.
Articles should be preferably typewritten, with double spacing, and the
scientific names as well as the vernacular names of birds should be given.
References cited in the text should be listed at the end of the article. Line
drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card; black and white
or colour photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will
be used where possible and should be clearly captioned. If authors wish
their eventual return, they must say so when submitting the article and
write their name on the back of each photograph.
