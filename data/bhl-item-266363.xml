THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be used where
possible and should be clearly captioned.

It came as a great sadness to members of the Avicultural Society to
learn that our President died on 5th November, 1985, in Los Angeles. He
had been in failing health for some time, but retained his perceptiveness
and sense of humour to the last.
For most of this century Jean Delacour played a unique role by being a
prominent ornithologist, aviculturist and, latterly, conservationist, and he
made a brilliant and sustained contribution to all the fields in which he
participated.
He was born in Paris of a wealthy family who always encouraged his
interests and he began collecting birds at the age of ten. By the time he
was 15 he had one of the largest collections then in existence, established
at his family's country house at Villers-Bretonneux. Following its destruc-
tion in the 1914-18 war, the collection was very soon recreated at Cleres
in Normandy in the grounds of the chateau which was to become his
permanent base. Cleres became world famous particularly for the
collection of waterfowl which was one of the best and most extensive ever
assembled. During World War II Jean Delacour again experienced the
misery of losing his collection, which again he rebuilt with his charac-
teristic enthusiasm when he was able to return to France from America
where he had spent the war. He had by then become an American citizen
and for the rest of his life he continued to spend most of the year in
America, returning to Normandy each summer.
Between the wars Jean Delacour made many expeditions all over the
world, studying and collecting birds and was appointed by the French
Government to organise the zoological exploration of French Indo-China
from 1923 to 1940.
In America he was appointed research associate at the American
Museum of Natural History and Director of the Department of History,
Science and Art at the Los Angeles County Museum.
He was a very prolific author, contributing many hundreds of articles

to various journals, including our own, and from 1920 to 1940 was editor
of the French journal L'Oiseau. His books included: Les Oiseaux de
I'lndochine Francaise (with P. Jabouille), Birds of the Philippines (with
E. Mayr), Birds of Malaya, Pheasants of the World, Guide des Oiseaux de
Nouvelle Caledonie et de ses Dependances, Curassows and Related Birds
(with D. Amadon), Birds of Malaysia, his autobiography The Living Air,
and the work for which he is probably best known, the monumental
Waterfowl of the World, a complete survey of the family in four volumes.
He was President of many important organisations, in particular the
International Committee for Bird Preservation from 1938 to 1958 where
his twin roles of ornithologist and aviculturist enabled him to combine
these interests with those of conservation.
Jean Delacour was always a great supporter of the Avicultural Society
which he joined in 1916 (surely his must be the longest membership?) and
contributed regularly to the Avicultural Magazine for the best part of 70
years. When he was elected President in 1972, he took a keen interest in
the affairs of the Society and although he was unable to attend many
Council Meetings, he always read the minutes that were sent to him and
often undertook commissions for the Society on his travels. He was also a
generous benefactor. In all, the Society was extremely privileged to have
had such a distinguished friend as its President. Any time spent with Jean
Delacour was always stimulating and enjoyable. We were honoured to have
known him and will remember him with love and respect.

The Council has decided to dedicate a special issue of the Avicultural
Magazine to Jean Delacour and contributions will be very welcome. We
have already received some appreciations and no doubt more will be
forthcoming, so in order to avoid inevitable repetition, it is proposed to
assemble a compilation of extracts from all of them. In addition, we would
particularly like to receive articles about various aspects of Jean Delacour's
work and the birds and/or areas in which he was especially interested,
possibly reviewing and bringing up to date his researches and writings. The
Editor will be very glad to hear from anyone who feels that they can
contribute or can suggest possible contributors.

MISS RUTH EZRA - PRESIDENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989343875" page_id="58077725"  page_num="Page 3" year="" vol="">
At its meeting on 23rd February 1986, the Council unanimously
elected Miss Ruth Ezra as our new President and we are very honoured
that she has accepted this post as she has been one of the Society's greatest
supporters and benefactors for many years.
Her father, Alfred Ezra, OBE, was one of the legendary names in avi-
culture and his collection at Foxwarren Park in Surrey was renowned
throughout the world, many first breeding successes having been achieved
there. Miss Ezra's connections with the Avicultural Society go right back
to her early years at Foxwarren Park where her father invited members
each year to visit the collection. She has continued this tradition at Chest-
nut Lodge, Cobham, where she entertains members each summer to see
the magnificent collection of birds which she owns with Mr. Raymond
Sawyer.
Mr. Alfred Ezra was President of this Society from 1926 to 1955; it is
particularly appropriate that his daughter should now occupy this position

REARING THE BROWN FISH OWL Ketupa zeylonensis
AT THE PAIGNTON ZOO (Devon)
By MISS JO GREGSON (Head Birdkeeper)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996217916666667" page_id="58077726"  page_num="Page 4" year="" vol="">
There are four species of the genus Ketupa distributed from the Middle
to the Far East but the Brown Fish Owl is by far the most widespread,
four subspecies occupying a range from Israel in the west through India,
Burma and Ceylon to China in the east.
It inhabits wooded country, seeking out overgrown ravines and steep
banks near rivers and streams in which it catches the fish and crabs that
form the main part of its diet, though small mammals and birds are also
taken.
This very handsome owl is 22 in (0.55 m) long. The sexes are alike in
plumage which is generally a reddish brown above, with black streaks and
beige and white spots; underneath it is whitish with brown streaks and
bars. Its feet and claws are especially adapted to catch and hold its slip-
pery prey and resemble those of the Osprey.
In the wild, the breeding season is from December to March, generally
in February.
This Fish-Owl was kept quite commonly in aviaries but the numbers
have dwindled in recent years, probably due to the restrictions on import-
ing and keeping birds of prey. This species has laid eggs in several collec-
tions but we believe that it has never before been reared successfully in
Britain, though the closely related Javan Fish Owl Ketupa ketupu was bred
at London Zoo in 1967 (AviculturalMagazine, 1968, pp. 17-18).
A male Brown Fish Owl had been in the collection here since 1967; in
April 1981 it was paired with a seven-year old female received in exchange
from 'Birdworld', Surrey.
The pair live in an unheated outdoor flight, constructed of 1 in (2.5
cm) chain link, laced on to a tubular metal framework, measuring 20 x
10 Vi x \0Vi ft high (6.00 x 3.20 x 3.20 m). Aviary furniture includes
natural perching, natural tree stumps, a large Bay shrub Laurus nobilis, and
a raised feeding ledge. At the base of the shrub is a large water tray. A
roofed, wood-partitioned area as wide as the aviary extends 5 ft (1.52 m)
beyond the back of the flight. The roofing also projects forward some 5 ft
in order to provode outdoor shelter. The nest-box 6Vi ft (1.97 m) above
the floor is positioned inside the partitioned area aligned with an access
hole (for the owls) measuring P /2 x 1 ft high (0.45 x 0.30 m). Keeper
access is by means of lower small hinged door. Since the aviary is sand-
wiched between other similar owl flights, there are two entrance/exit

doors in either side as well as a seldom-used door .in the front of the aviary.
In January 1982 the pair began to use an open-fronted nest-box
measuring 30 x 16 x 24 in high (0.75 x 0.40 x 0.60) with a 6 in (1.82 m)
upstand. A few days later one thin-shelled broken egg was found on the
aviary floor. Despite constant improvements to the birds' diet, the clutches
laid in 1983 and 1984 were both thin-shelled and broken. The nest-box
proved unsuitable for the purposes of removing eggs undamaged and at
the end of 1984 a newly-designed nest-box was fitted in the hope that we
; would be able to remove an egg before it was broken. The new box was
open-topped and measured 24 in x 24 in x 12 in high (0.60 x 0.60 x 0.30
frn), with a 12 in square front drop flap allowing easier access to the
3ggs. The floor of the box (drilled in places for drainage) was layered with
peat and scattered with old pellets!
On 9th January 1985 one egg was removed for artificial incubation; a

second egg had already been cracked and failed to hatch. The incubator
was run dry until the chick had moved into the air space on 7th February.
The next morning the chick had hatched. It was very strong with eyes
partially open, but its navel had not yet healed. The chick may have
escaped too soon from its thin shell and not had sufficient time for the
yolk sac to be completely withdrawn into the abdomen. Fortunately
after swabbing it with antiseptic, it healed over without any developing
infection.
The chick took its first feed at midday. It comprised trout and soft
pieces of mouse. Thereafter it was fed approximately every two hours
from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. each day and tweezers were used to hold the food;
SA37, a vitamin supplement, was dusted onto one feed every fourth day.
For the First two days the chick was kept in the incubator, after which
it was placed in a brooder. Two 60-watt light bulbs supplied ample heat.
The first small pieces of mouse bone were fed on the fourth day. Fur
and feather were fed from the eighth day and fish were filleted before
feeding. By day 15, the chick was covered in quills and therefore one

60-watt light bulb was exchanged for a 25-watt bulb. At 20 days it was
beak clicking and hissing when disturbed, as a means of defence.
Much to everyone's surprise, the first pellet was not regurgitated until
day 26 after which a pellet was produced almost every other day. Once
we were sure it could pass pellets regularly, whole mice were fed.
Food was refused on the 33rd day and the chick became very excited,
jumping out of its box, head bobbing, wings flapping and using its feet
to hold food and tear up paper on the cage floor. It fed of its own accord
for the First time on day 42. A few days later a large water bowl was
placed on the cage floor into which it leaped almost immediately. There-
after it remained in or around the bowl most of the time.
By day 48 the chick required no further heat. When it could perch
confidently, it was moved to a large flight on day 81.
The juvenile bird sported yellow, turning to grey, down until it was
replaced by the adult plumage.

As described above, the Brown Fish Owl Ketupa zeylonensis has been bred by
Paignton Zoological and Botanical Gardens and this is believed to be the first success
in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern
Ireland or of any other reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to write to
the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING THE BANK MYNAH Ac rid other es ginginianus
AND THE COLETO OR BALD STARLING Sarcops calvus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.887356694444445" page_id="58077730"  page_num="Page 8" year="" vol="">
By R.F. RAYNER (London)
My collection consists chiefly of starlings though in the past I have
kept lovebirds, seedeaters, small softbills, tanagers, etc., but as I work
seven days a week I find that it is easier to keep the larger softbills with
the limited time I have available.
I have been very successful with this specialised collection having
reared the Spreo Starling, Coleto or Bald Starling, Rothschild's Mynah,
Pagoda Mynah and Bank Mynah. Blyth's Mynahs, Pied Mynahs and
Purple Glossy Starlings have hatched but deserted after one to 10 days.
I have hopes for future success with Royal Starlings, Long-tailed Star-
lings, White-winged Starlings, Malabar Starlings, Dumonti's Mynahs, and
Amethyst Starlings.
I no longer use artificial light or heat and my new flights have only
a covered roof at one end with a drop of about 2 ft (0.61 m). Water
is pumped through all the flights from a pond 8 ft (2.44 m) in diameter!
and 3 ft (0.91 m) deep. This saves work and ensures that the birds always
have water, even in freezing weather. All the birds survived last winter
which was very severe (except a sick Coleto) with no ill effects and indeed
this year (1985) I have had my best breeding season.
Breeding the Bank Mynah
This bird comes from the plains of Northern India and looks very
much like the Common Mynah and indeed the two species are often
found together, though the Bank Mynah is more a bird of the open
countryside and spends less time scavenging around human habitation than
the Common Mynah. It chooses to live near rivers and nests in colonies in
banks and cliffs over running water.
It is 9 in (0.22 m) long and the sexes are alike. The top and the sides of
the head are black and the entire body plumage is slaty grey except for a
pinky beige patch on the abdomen. The wing is black with a pinkish
beige patch at the base of the outer flight feathers, and a similar patch is
at the tip of the black tail.
My pair of Bank Mynahs were obtained in 1981 from a dealer who
assured me that they were an 'unknown species' and that a well-known avi-
culturist had seen them and could not identify them. I travelled 150
miles to his establishment to be presented with two completely plucked
birds, only their wing feathers and a few body feathers being present. I had

a strong suspicion that they were Bank Mynahs but was assured that the
aforesaid aviculturist would have recognised that species. However, several
months later and after a lot of care, I had two beautiful Bank Mynahs!
They were housed in a flight 8 x 8 x 3 ft (2.44 x 2.44 x 0.91 m) with a
best-box measuring 18 x 8 x 8 in (0.45 x 0.20 x 0.20 m) placed lengthwise
Tt one end of the flight which was well planted. Their diet consisted of
fruit, mynah pellets, mealworms and a homemade softfood mixture.
Although in the wild these birds nest several feet underground in
f iver banks, I was unable to duplicate this although the entrance to the
lest-box is through a 4 x 2 in (0.10 x 0.05 m) pipe. The birds laid their
irst eggs in 1982 but removed them and placed them undamaged on the
loor at the opposite end of the flight. I placed these eggs under Spreo
Starlings but did not succeed in hatching them, or the eggs of subsequent
^ears until this year. Two eggs were again removed whole from the nest
I have yet to see how the birds transport eggs over a distance of 8 ft
2.44m] without breaking them!). One egg was placed with a pair of

eaten. The other was placed under a pair of Spreo Starlings. This pair
consisted of a known hen that was at least 10 years old and a bird that I
had bred in 1984 that I had hoped was a cock. There were already three
eggs in the nest and on 17th July the parent birds were seen feeding. On
18th July the nest-box was checked and two chicks were seen. Obviously
I had a pair. On 21st July one chick was thrown out. As the other chick
had not fledged by 9th August ( 22 days) and my Spreos fledge between
16 and 20 days, I checked the box and saw that the chick was a Bank
Mynah. Two days later it had still not come out, so I checked the box
again and it came out (24 days).
The chick was very much duller than its parents, looking 'dusty'; the
orange skin on the eye was hardly visible and the pink wing flash very
insipid.
Mynah parents seem to feed only mealworms and crickets which I
cover in a calcium-based supplement, and on the seventh day I worm the
chicks by dusting the crickets with an anthelmintic powder. Since follow-
ing these procedures, my success rate with softbills has greatly improved.
The foster parents of the Bank Mynahs had another round and reared
two young of their own with the young Bank Mynah still in their flight.
It seems no reverse imprinting had taken place as they had no trouble
in rearing their own young. I have obtained another Bank Mynah which
I hope to pair with my home-bred bird.
I have only found one record of a previous breeding of this species and
that was at London Zoo in 1909.
Breeding the Coleto or Bald Starling Sarcops calvus
This species comes from the Philippine Islands and I understand that
there is a slight variation in size from one island to another. As with most
starlings the sexes are alike. There is an excellent plate of this species by
H. Gronvold in the Avicultural Magazine of 1906 (pp. 191--192) showing
the very characteristic ruff raised.
I obtained a pair that had been surgically sexed from a dealer in the
winter of 1983/4 but the hen, which had never been a healthy bird, died
in the following winter; no attempt at nesting had been made during 1984.
In March 1985 I was fortunate enough to be present when two hens
belonging to Mr. Raymond Sawyer were surgically sexed, and he kindly
let me have one. He had had it for several years and it seemed to be
different from my cock bird, being larger with slightly more silver on the
neck.
The two birds were placed together in a flight 12 x 3 x 8 ft (3.66 x
0.91 x 2.44 m), covered at one end where there is a nest-box 16 x 8 x 8 in
(0.40 x 0.20 x 0.20 m) with a 2 in (0.0S m) entrance hole. The floor is

of earth, covered with grass,- and there is a small conifer at one end.
Knowing the aggressive reputation of these birds, I was slightly appre-
hensive at the introduction but no attacks were seen. The cock bird
immediately began to strip the conifer of all its leaves which, in fact, killed
it. Both birds then began to tear the grass from the ground, pulling it out
by the roots, ignoring hay and canary nesting material. The cock seemed
to do most of the nest building and the box was filled to the entrance
hole. I saw no mating take place but after about two weeks the cock bird
remained in the nest box for hours at a time and during the following 10
days I only saw the hen enter the box once. From their behaviour, I came
to the conclusion that perhaps I had two hens. On 21st April I checked the
box and there were three eggs which were blue speckled at one end.
Though I was convinced that both birds were hens, two days later two of
the eggs were ejected and both were fertile.
On 24th May, eggshells were seen in the flight and the cock bird was
seen taking mealworms into the nest. The hen rarely went into the box,
and I estimate that the cock did 90% of the feeding. I gave the birds

mealworms, crickets, fruit, softfood mix and mynah pellets but only
live food was fed to the chicks during the first week. I had several nests
of softbills at the time and on 30th May a handful of well-cleaned maggots
was added to about 2 lbs of mealworms and fed to all my birds with
young. The following day a dead Coleto chick was found on the aviary
floor. As this is quite a common occurrence with softbills, no significance
was placed on this. The cock bird continued feeding so I knew that there
were chicks still in the nest. The following day the hen was on the floor
unable to fly with no control over her head or wings. I realised then that
the cause was probaby botulitis which I had heard about but not pre-
viously encountered. The cock bird seemed unaffected, although he
showed signs later, and I decided to remove the chick and the hen. The
hen remained incapable of feeding itself or even moving for seven days.
Although there is an antitoxin, which I managed to trace three days
later, I was told that it must be given within 24 hours of the symptoms
appearing. I had treated the hen with aluminium hydroxide which was
supposed to 'mop up' the toxin and I was assured that the toxin would
leave the system provided that I could keep the bird alive. I force-fed it for
seven days and on the eighth day it recovered completely.
In the meantime, the chick that I estimated to be about six to seven
days old showed no signs of poisoning but as a precaution I started dosing
it with aluminium hydroxide. I could find no guidance as to dosage but
after three days the chick's droppings were very loose and I stayed up all
night worrying. I stopped giving the aluminium hydroxide. The chick was
fed crickets and mealworms covered in the calcium-based supplement. It
would not gape but I found out accidentally that sneezing caused it to
gape, so I faked sneezing for two days before discovering that whistling
gave the same result! The crickets had to be completely dewinged and
delegged before feeding. I fed on demand, which seemed continuous,
starting at about 6 a.m. and finishing at midnight. The bird was kept in the
house in the airing cupboard at a temperature of about 70*F, transported
to work surrounded by tissue and with a hot water bottle, and placed in a
hospital cage set at 80*F during working hours.
At seven days old the chick was naked but the pink head could be seen
clearly; growth was rapid and the wing feathers were beginning to show at
11 days; by 21 days the bird was fully feathered. I introduced minced
beef and apple at 15 days. As I have lost several chicks with gape worm, I
dosed the bird at 15 days with a suitable anthelmintic. Although the chick
seemed to be developing very well, I was slightly concerned that at 20 days
it still remained on its hocks. I ground up two calcium lactate tablets
which I mixed with its food. At 22 days it was perching perfectly, and at !
28 days it was feeding itself. I continued to offer it mealworms which it

took from my hand with no fear but about three weeks later it refused
them and stayed away from me, becoming increasingly timid; it is now
completely wild when approached. This is in complete contrast to the
other softbills that I have bred which seem to get tamer the more contact
is made. Since then, two further Coleto chicks have reacted in the same
manner and although I have kept them in 2 x 2 x 4 ft (0.61 x 0.61 x 1.22
m) cages, they remain completely wild.
After the hen had recovered, I replaced her with the male and on 28th
July the cock bird was seen feeding. This time the parents successfully
reared two chicks which left the nest on 25th August. The young are the
same colour as the parents and although slightly smaller, and the silver ruff
less pronounced, the feathering does not look very juvenile. The chicks
were removed on 11th September. On 18th September the nest-box was
checked and two eggs were seen. On 3rd October, the behaviour of the
parents aroused my suspicions and on checking the nest-box I found two
dead chicks.
It seems that if compatible, these birds will nest several times a year
and should be readily established in captivity. Because of their aggressive
nature, I would recommend that they are best kept in a flight by them-
selves. The young Coletos began to fight at about two months old and are
now housed singly.

BREEDING THE CRESTED WOOD PARTRIDGE
or ROULROUL Rollulus roulroul
AT THE PADSTOW BIRD GARDENS, CORNWALL
By ANDREW OWEN AND RICHARD HUGHES

The Crested Wood Partridge, also known as the Roulroul Partridge, is
probably the most attractive member of its family. The male is dark blue
on the breast merging to green on the back and its most outstanding fea-
ture is its white crown and upright red crest. The female's plumage is
mainly green with grey head and rich chestnut wings. The legs and feet of
both sexes are reddish. Both sexes are about 10 in long (25.4 cm).
It is found in tropical forests and bamboo thickets up to 3,000 ft
(914 m) throughout Sumatra, Bornea, Thailand peninsular and Malaya
(King and Dickinson, 1975).
A pair of these birds is housed in the Tropical House here at Padstow
Bird Gardens. Other ground-dwelling birds in the Tropical House include a
pair of Northern Jacanas, Black-winged Stilts, Golden Heart Doves and a
Spur-winged Plover.
The diet for the Crested Wood Partridges consists of insectile food,
chopped fruit, cress and live food (maggots, mealworms, crickets); they are
also given Haith's Java Dove Mix. They spend most of the time foraging
among the leaf litter for insects and other invertebrates, and are particu-
larly fond of large house spiders. Constantly calling in a soft mellow
whistle, they are seldom apart.
During the spring (1985) the Plover and Stilts were removed from the
Tropical House to an outside flight as they were showing signs of aggres-
tion towards the other ground birds. Shortly afterwards the Partridges
began to nest.
The female dug a scrape under a low fern. The male would carry root-
lets and leaves towards the scrape, turn, and throw them over his shoulder
where the awaiting female would place them around her, forming a dome-
shaped nest (a characteristic of this species). The nest was finished within
two days. Mating was observed once prior to nest-building.
The female began to sit once the nest was complete. Once inside the
nest she would place dead leaves and plant fibres over the entrance to con-
ceal herself and to make the nest less conspicuous. It was not until six days
later that the clutch of three white, almost round eggs were seen. On the
rare occasions that the female left the nest to feed she would replace the
plant matter over the entrance, quickly returning at the slightest distur-
bance in the Tropical House. The male apparently took no part in the in-

cubation of the eggs.
After a further six days the female deserted the nest due to some un-
known disturbance. The eggs were left in the nest for several hours, but as
the female did not return they were removed and placed in a small Cur-
; few incubator at a temperature of 99-100*F.
The eggs hatched after a total incubation period of 17 days. The eggs
began pipping at approximately 8.0 a.m. and hatched at 3.15 p.m.,
7.15 p.m. and 2.30 a.m. respectively. Upon hatching the chicks seemed
uncomfortable at the above temperature so it was lowered to 97*F.
The chicks were covered in chocolate-coloured down and were ex-
tremely vocal, continually calling to one another. They dried out after
about four hours and by this time were very active, therefore a cardboard
wall was put around the incubator to prevent them from escaping.
The chicks were given their first feed 12 hours after hatching. This con-
sisted of tiny stick insects and very small pinky maggots. These were fed
from a pair of tweezers gently tapped on the ground in front of the birds.
We had to persevere before they finally accepted the food. A shallow con-
tainer of water was placed in with the chicks which they drank from
readily.

A. OWEN &amp; R. HUGHES - BREEDING ROULROUL
For the first day they were fed at hourly intervals as very little food
was taken at each feed.
The youngest chick died within a day of hatching due to unknown
causes.
The two remaining chicks progressed well and began to accept food
more readily and the distance between feeding times was, therefore,
lengthened to two hours. At this stage a shallow dish containing chopped
cress, hard-boiled egg and maggots was provided, though very little interest
was shown in this.
The temperature in the incubator was now reduced by a few degrees
each day.
All went well for the next two days until the legs of one chick started
to splay. We tried to correct this by covering the floor with a damp cloth
in the hope that this would improve its condition. Unfortunately, it deter-
iorated and at five days old was very weak and unable to stand and sup-
port its head; it was, therefore, destroyed.
The remaining chick continued to thrive and at seven days old the wing
feathers started to appear. At night the chick was very restless and was
constantly calling so a cardboard box was provided for it to roost in. This
did not completely solve the problem so we tried putting a small furry toy
(of similar size) into the box. This seemed to do the trick as the chick was
much quieter and more contented.
By 11 days old its wings were larger, it had the beginnings of a tail and
was growing rapidly. At this stage it was removed to a box cage measuring
3 ft x 1 ft x 1 ft (0.92 x 0.31 x 0.31 m).
A week later the chick was still growing well, measuring about 6 in
(0.15 m) and was a reasonable flier, capable of flying the length of the
room. By this time it was feeding on its own although still accepting
maggots from the tweezers.
At 20 days some green feathers began to appear on its rump and back,
and some silvery green feathers were also seen on the breast, thus we had
the first indication of its sex (a female).
After a few more weeks, the chick became too large and active for the
cage, so it was then removed to a larger indoor holding flight.
During the next three months she gradually attained adult plumage. By
this time she was feeding on an adult diet. Although remaining tame, the
young Partridge has not become imprinted as we first feared.
This was the first breeding of this species in the Gardens and we hope
for more success in the future.

BREEDING BEHAVIOUR OF CRESTED WOOD PARTRIDGES
IN CAPTIVITY

The wariness of tropical rainforest pheasants and partridges, as well as
their densely vegetated habitat, has greatly restricted studies of the wild
birds. Observations in captivity have correspondingly had more importance
in understanding their behaviour. The Crested Wood Partridge Rollulus
roulroul is one such species, being one of the few partridges of tropical
evergreen forest to breed rather freely in captivity. Data presented here,
from observations of captive birds, show that this species has unique
behavioural adaptations, notably in relation to breeding. These adapta-
tions are in strong contrast to the behaviour of similar-sized temperate
game birds.
Crested Wood Partridges are patchily common in lowland and hill
evergreen dipterocarp forest, in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo.
The sexes are highly dimorphic in plumage (Robinson and Chasen, 1936)
but not in size, both weighing around 280g. Nesting in the wild has been
described by Ogilvie (1949) and by Coomans de Ruiter (1946); other
details of the species' behaviour are given by Robinson and Chasen (1936)
and by Medway and Wells (1976).

The following observations were made on 10 pairs, variously accom-
panied by their offspring, at the National Zoo, Kuala Lumpur. Each pair
was kept in visual, but not vocal, isolation, in cages ranging from 4 m 2 to
90 m 2 . Behaviour of individual birds within larger flocks was observed in
captive groups of up to 12; wild birds were also observed ranging from
solitary individuals to large flocks.
Pair bonding
Mean group size in the wild was 2.67 (average of 60 sightings), ranging
from one to 13 birds. The commonest sighting (27 times) was of an adult
pair, followed by sightings of singletons. All birds in wild flocks keep in
contact through continual soft chirping, but normally distinct pairs are
discernible within the larger group. This is evident when flocks are dis-
turbed and split up into their constituent pairs, or when on occasion a
flock cautiously crosses a forest trail pair by pair, or when in a foraging
group each pair feeds slightly apart from the remainder. Most often simi-

lar numbers of males and females make up the flock, but occasionally
there is a strong bias: once a flock of 12 males was seen.
Pair formation within a flock takes place when a male begins courting
a particular female. A large part of this activity consists not of displays, in
the sense of postures having a special visual impact, but of'cutting-out'
movements, by which the male attempts to isolate a female from the rest
of the group. In particular he continually interposes his body, with lowered
head, whenever the female approaches another male, walking parallel
by her side and sometimes touching.
Throughout pair formation and the subsequent bond, much play is
made of the rapidly vibrated tail which in this bird is short and down-
wardly directed. Once the pair is formed, the male generally follows
wherever the female leads, and it is she who performs the majority of tail
f shaking.
y
Displays
Through pair formation and thereafter, the male and female spend
their time in close proximity, whether moving about or resting. Much of
the time not spent in foraging is devoted to preening. In the male, active
and jerky movements of the head while preening the upper and under sur-
faces of the body and wings, switching rapidly from one part of the body
to another, make the deep red crest very conspicuous. Whether these
I preening movements are ritualised to a point at which they have display
function is an arguable point.
Much more typical of partridge displays is a stretched lateral posture.
The male, standing usually alongside the female and parallel to her,
I straightens his legs so that his body is raised up. There is little accompany-
ing change in feather posture, but a major effect of the display is to em-
phasise the red legs.
Courtship feeding or tidbitting is very common, when the male picks
up any piece of food, especially animal food, and twitters until the female
comes and takes it from his bill. Sometimes he twitters and adopts the
head-forwards posture without holding anything, and if the female res-
ponds she pecks preferentially at the red patch on the male's bill.
Two other displays bear no parallel amongst game birds. On occasion
the male will run just behind or alongside the female and, as soon as she
pauses, will put his head under her breast, abdomen, or under tail-coverts
and press upwards. This can only be understood in relation to the beha-
viour of the chicks described later. Sometimes too, while running along-
side, the male will crouch, lower his head and beg with open bill while
twittering. Although all males performed this display, no female was ever
seen to respond by giving the male food.

Nest-building
Both sexes participate in building the nest, using sideways-throwing
and sideways-building techniques. One bird will enter the chosen nest
space and sit there while pulling in leaves from within reach, tucking them
down the sides of the body. It will, after a time, emerge and walk away
from the nest throwing leaves or twigs backwards over its back. As this
bird emerges, its partner enters the nest and begins sideways-building. Thus
in periods of intense activity there is a continuous cycle with one bird in
the nest and one walking away, only to switch places as the nest occupant
emerges. Entry into the nest and turning within it form the central nest
chamber, while the high level of activity results in a large mass of leaves
forming a complete dome.
This system should encourage similar levels of participation from the
two sexes, but in fact males generally expend more time building than
their mates. Females cease sideways-throwing sooner while walking away,
and more often miss out their turn to enter the nest. On average males
put about twice as much time into nest building as females do, as the
following figures show.

Chick behaviour

<bodyText confidence="0.998968785714286" page_id="58077742"  page_num="Page 20" year="" vol="">
The most noticeable feature after hatching is the great care paid by
both parents to the chicks. This is manifested in various ways.
After hatching the brood splits between the parents. If only one
chick hatches from a clutch it is tended by both parents (not always to
an equal degree), but in larger broods about half go to each, and each
parent restricts its care very largely to its own set of young.
The chicks take food mainly from the attendant parent's bill for the
first few days; the parent picks up a fragment, and may call, whereupon
one or more chicks peck at the held food. This behaviour gradually
declines in favour of the chicks picking up food for themselves at scrapes
made by the parents. At the same time chicks learn to scrape for their own
food, beginning within the first week of life, and at least by the eighth
week most food comes by this means. Nevertheless, depending on the
behavioural state of the parent, odd items may still be obtained from the

parent's bill even up to six months old, when the young are full-sized and
in adult-like plumage.
Gaping for food occurs, and this exposes the skin within the mouth
which is bright yellow in the chick (but pink in the adult). A gaping chick
crouches slightly and lifts up its widely open bill while cheeping. Although
this behaviour was seen many times, on no occasion did either parent place
food within the chick's mouth. But it seems logical to suppose this does
sometimes happen, otherwise the behaviour seems pointless and is difficult
to account for. It would be difficult too to explain the evolution of the
colour signal within the chick's gape. Gaping is not a common behaviour,
though every chick performs it, and it becomes positively rare after the
fifth week.
Chicks in less active periods solicit brooding from their attendant
parent; the female responds more often than the male. Brooding is soli-
cited by a chick walking under the parent and pressing upwards with its
head, back and lifted wings, exerting pressure by straightening the legs as
well as wing lifting. This pressure seems to induce the brooding response
(crouching) in the parent. As the chick grows it is less able to burrow
beneath its parent and upward pressing is done mainly with the head,
inserted under the parent's breast, abdomen or tail-coverts.

These observations raise some general points about the reproductive
behaviour of the species. Chick care is multifaceted, and exceeds that
known for any other galliform. The male parent takes an equal share in
the breeding cycle as a whole; although he does not incubate he expends
time and energy in courtship feeding, which is a direct input of nutrients
to the female and hence to the eggs she will lay.
Gaping by chicks is quite unknown in other galliforms. It is worth
further observations to see whether this ever does stimulate the parent to
place food within the chick's mouth. Stable division of the brood between
the two parents has also not been reported for other species. The amount
of food-finding by the male, and the amount of brooding he performs, are
unusual features. So too is his heavy role in nest building.
The level and type of chick care are of interest again in relation to the
displays of the adult male. Tidbitting is widespread, perhaps universal
among galliforms, and is thought to be a ritualisation of parental feeding
(Stokes and Williams, 1971). But in the Crested Wood Partridge two other
displays are related to a similar phenomenon. Gaping by the male, and his
insertion of the head beneath the female, are almost identical to gaping
and brooding-solicitation by the chicks. Though ritualisation of parental
behaviour to form displays is a common occurrence, the ritualisation of

chick behaviour into courtship is unique to the present species.
These observations have some relevance to the captive breeding of
tropical galliforms. It is common practice to increase output by removing
and artificially incubating first clutches or all clutches. This process is
very effective when applied to temperate zone species. But the Crested
Wood Partridge is an extreme example of the general truth that tropical ;
game birds have more elaborate chick care. Artificial incubation deprives i
the chicks of this care, and a long term strategy for their captive breeding ,
might be to leave eggs with the parents. This would result in lower produc-
tion rates but better care of chicks, and chicks with broad social ex- i
perience. Such parent-reared chicks are themselves more likely to be com-
petent breeders in future.

The partridges of the genus Alectoris are perhaps best typified by the
Chukar A. chukar and the Red-legged Partridge A. rufa , one or other of
vhich is likely to be familiar to most of my readers. To those to whom
hey are not, I'd better say that they are a shade larger and more robust in
build than the Common Partridge Perdix perdix or Indian Grey Partridge
7 rancolinus pondicerianus and about a third larger than a Bobwhite Coli-
ius virginianus.
They are all extremely beautiful birds, characterised by having red bills
md legs, red or pink orbital skin around the eye, a distinctive face, neck
md throat pattern in white or cream and black or (one species only) grey
md chestnut, strikingly barred flanks and the upperparts some shade of
)rown, fawn or grey without any markings other than, in some species, a
&gt;roadly laced pattern on the scapulars. Most have chestnut outer tail
eathers. The sexes are alike except that the males are rather larger and
isually have wart-like 'spurs' on their legs, although it is said that some
lens have these and certainly in A. rufa some cocks do not. The juvenile
)irds are very different in colour and pattern, being much more like
y erdix.
They are all closely related and similar and under natural conditions are
ither completely allopatric or, where two forms do appear to overlap 'on
he map' they are usually known or believed to be separated by living at
lifferent altitudes.
Some authorities have treated the Chukar, the Rock Partridge Alectoris
raeca and the Large Rock Partridge or Przewalski's Partridge A. magna as
nembers of a single species. However, Watson (1962) gave what seem to
&gt;e valid reasons for treating them as separate species, although he perhaps
&gt;ver-emphasised some of the slight plumage differences. In any case most
writers now treat these as three species and it is preferable to do so unless
&gt;roof to the contrary turns up.
The Black-throated Chukar or Philby's Partridge A. philbyi is also
ometimes treated as a race of A. chukar but, like Harrison (1982) I con-

sider it best given specific rank.
The three remaining species are the Arabian Partridge or Arabian Red-
legged Partridge A. melanocephala, the Barbary Partridge A. barbara and,
perhaps most beautiful of all these exquisite birds, the Red-legged Part-
ridge, long (but perhaps not to be much longer!) familiar as a successfully
introduced species in central-eastern and south-eastern England.
Alectoris is a very distinct genus. Its nearest relatives are probably the
sand partridges of the genus Ammoperdix and, more distantly, the much
larger and duller snowcocks Tetraogallus.
The Alectoris partridges inhabit rocky, rather arid, and usually hilly or
mountainous areas, with a preference for warm, south-facing slopes. Some-
times in places with bush or tree cover but not in dense woodland or flat
open country far from any cover. Like most other gamebirds that live on
hills or mountains, they tend to walk or run uphill away from man or
other predators but in emergency to fly downhill. Their flight, like that of
most gamebirds (and ground-living pigeons) consists of alternate periods
of violent wing beating, interspersed with long glides. They are not so
completely terrestial as the Common Partridge Perdix perdix as they often
perch on rocks, walls, dead trees, buildings, etc.
Some, and perhaps all of these partridges have the habit, unique among
gamebirds so far as is known, of both cock and hen of the pair sometimes
or usually incubating a nest of eggs. If feeding and other conditions per-
mit, the hen lays two 'clutches' of eggs or, to be more precise, she lays
about half of one large clutch of 15, 20, 28 or more eggs in one nest and
the others in a second nest. She starts to incubate on the second nest when
it is full and, when she does so but not before, her mate returns to the
first nest and starts to incubate the eggs there, if they have not, in the
meantime, been discovered and eaten by some predator. If they have been,
or if the hen lays only one nestful of eggs before beginning to sit, the cock
joins up with other males who also have no eggs to sit on. In some cases, at
least for some species, cocks are said sometimes to re-join their mate and
her chicks when the latter are partly grown. In other cases, and usually
with the Red-legged Partridge at least, a brood of chicks is reared by
mother or father alone
This behaviour is well documented for the Red-legged Partridge in
England, both in captivity (Goodwin, 1953) and in the wild (Green, 1981
and 1984; Jenkins, 1957). It is said (Cramp et al, 1980) sometimes to
occur in the Rock Partridge, although Menzdorf (1983) says there is no
evidence for it in this species. Cock Chukars have also been known to
incubate nests of eggs and rear chicks in captivity (Portal, 1924) and a
cock with a brood patch has been shot in the wild in the Aegean Islands
(Wettstein, 1938). Menzdorf dismisses male incubation in this species with

the statement that possibly occasional males may incubate deserted
clutches (verwaiste Gelege). This seems to be unlikely because, on 'selfish
gene' principles, such behaviour could hardly be selected for unless he
incubated only clutches deserted by his own mate. Even if he did, it
would be a risky business as the commonest cause of nest desertion is
because the sitting bird has had a narrow escape from a predator, who
might well have 'better luck next time' if the deserter's mate took over.
I think those who, like Menzdorf, doubt the occurrence of male incuba-
tion in these partridges under natural conditions, may be unduly influ-
enced by having had captive males that did not incubate when given the
chance. However, it is well known that female ground nesting gamebirds
(and also ground nesting pigeons!) very often nest and lay but refuse to
incubate under captive conditions. So it should cause no surprise if under
captive conditions some male Alectoris partridges fail to incubate their
mates' first nests. That any do so argues cogently, in my opinion, that the
habit is (under appropriate conditions) normal to them. As the Heinroths,
with their incomparable experience of bird keeping, pointed out (I think
in their classic book Die Vogel Mitteleuropas but am not sure of this),
when speaking of nest site selection by drakes, the fact that a bird does
not perform some piece of behaviour in captivity is no proof that it never
does so in the wild but the performance of any complex piece of repro-
ductive behaviour in captivity is proof that it is part of the species' reper-
toire in its wild state.
My own opinion is that it will ultimately be found that, where feeding
conditions and other circumstances are favourable, the hens of most or all
Alectoris lay two nests full of eggs, one of which the cock incubates when
the hen has begun incubation on the second, but that in many circum-
stances the food available, the amount of time available before incubation
must begin if the young are to be reared successfully, or other factors, pre-
clude the hen from laying more than one 'clutch'. Possibly (but this is a
mere guess) if the hen is killed when she has laid several eggs but before
she has begun to incubate, the cock will then incubate these eggs, at least
if there is not an unmated hen around to distract him from them.
So far as I am aware, there is little or no evidence for male incubation
or, for that matter, any detailed studies on breeding behaviour in the other
species. A cock Barbary Partridge (Debeno, 1933) incubated the only nest
of eggs that his mate produced but as she took a surprisingly long time
about this, perhaps he realised that the eggs would not keep much longer
if not sat upon. After incubating for some time, he attacked his mate
fiercely but when she was removed sat peacefully again and was a model
father to his chicks.

Notes on the species
The Chukar
This is the most widespread and almost certainly the most abundant
species. It is also more easily, or perhaps one should say even more easily
kept and bred in captivity than its congeners, in which state it has almost
certainly been kept as early as the Bronze age (Watson, 1962). It is found
from eastern Greece (Thrace) and Crete through Turkey, Syria, Lebanon,
Sinai, Iraq and Iran, Afghanistan, northern India and nearby areas through
much of central Asia to north-eastern China. It has been introduced as a
'sporting bird', for the pleasure of those who enjoy killing beautiful, sen-
tient creatures (unfortunately a much larger and hence more powerful
number of people than those who enjoy watching birds or keeping them), j
to many countries and appears to be well established in parts of the j
western United States and in New Zealand. It has also been introduced
into various parts of England, about which I shall say more further on in
this article.

The Chukar inhabits a wide, or at least fairly wide range of habitats,
ypically on or near rocky hillsides, mountain slopes or valleys, ranging
rom the snow line, or just below it, down to hot deserts. Sometimes in
hearings in forest or in open, grazed woodlands with some rocks or
moulders. It is said (Cramp et al) also to inhabit open plains and flat
lesert but I suspect it only does so where there is some rocky ground or
crub fairly near.
In describing this and the other species I shall here give only the main
eatures and not attempt a detailed description. When describing feathers
shall ignore the fluffy basal portion of the feather that is not normally
isible and not repeat the description of the bill, legs and orbital skin
idiich have already been given. As with many other birds, especially those
hat have subtle pastel shades, no words and few paintings or photographs
; an give an adequate impression of the extreme beauty of these birds. The
it and living bird must be seen at close quarters for this to be fully appre-
iated. This is not always easy as, because more people shoot partridges
;han want to look at them, they are almost everywhere much afraid of
iiian in their wild, or feral state.
The Chukar's upper parts are predominantly olive brown to pale
tinkish fawn, more or less shading to pale grey on the crown, neck and
ump. The sides of the breast and the scapulars are pale bluish grey with
&gt;road pinkish fawn, mauvish pink or salmon pink borders to the feathers,
'he front of the breast is pale grey, the belly and under tail covert buffish.
'he face and throat pattern (see sketch) is black surrounding dull cream or
lingy off-white, often with a dusky smudging or speckling in the cream
olour at the lowest point (the pale part) of the bib. There is a tuft of
.airy reddish brown feathers over the ear openings and a conspicuous
zhite or greyish white stripe above and extending beyond the eye. The
uter tail feathers are pale chestnut. The barred feathers on the flanks are
ale bluish grey at the base, then come two rather narrow black bands
Tth a wider buff or cream band between them (see sketches) then a final
nd narrow fringe of dark chestnut.
The above is a generalised description. Many geographical races of this
secies have been named on usually rather small differences of shade of
le upper parts and the width of the buff band on the flank feathers. In
sneral, Chukars from hot, arid regions are paler and pinker in colour (and
1 my eyes, therefore, more beautiful) than those from less arid regions,
hey also bleach even more quickly and the differences due to plumage
ear can be very striking indeed. I have handled and examined many
luseum specimens, collected when moulting, in which the new feathers
n the back are deep olive brown and the old ones that they are replacing
re a very pale dusty cream colour. Every British bird watcher who takes

note of the common birds (and that is far from every BBW, I fear) knowf
how our Mistle Thrush Turdus viscivorus, when in fresh plumage in earl&gt;!
autumn, has dark olive brown upperparts (slightly paler and more greenish!
on the rump) and a deep golden (dark-spotted) breast which, by the foil
lowing May, have usually become, respectively, pale dingy greyish ancs
white. The Chukar's usual colour changes are similar and just as great.
There are two very nice colour pictures of the Chukar in Jonsson (1982j 1
a good colour photograph in Nicolai (1982) and some excellent 'actiorj!
photos' of captive birds performing various displays in Stoke's paper orj
the species' behaviour.
From what I have read, the voice and displays of this species would
appear to be very similar but not identical to those of the Red-legged
Partridge (Goodwin, 1953,). A most noticeable possible difference is that ii(
the threat or sexual display in which the Red-legged Partridge 'twists it!
face round' in a remarkable way, the Chukar would appear to do so to |
relatively very slight extent, if at all. At least so it seems from Stokesl
pictures and descriptions and so it was on the only two occasions that is
have seen this display from a Chukar. In one of these the bird was dis
playing at and being displayed back to 'in kind' by a Red-legged Parti
ridge and I had both birds 'in my binoculars' at once. Presumably the morj
elaborate throat and upper breast pattern of the Redleg is relevant here.
The only calls I have heard from Chukars (feral birds in Kent) were th|
rally call and the 'steam engine' call and both of these sounded to my earl
similar to but more husky and guttural than the 'same' calls of the Redle
(which I heard the same day).
&amp;apos; I
The Rock Partridge
In appearance this bird is very similar to the Chukar, differing only ii
minor point of face pattern (see sketch), in having a pure white or greyis]
white (not creamy) throat and more prevailingly grey upper parts. Th
bars on its flanks look finer and a little brighter, the cream or buff ban&amp;lt;|
between the two black bands is narrower and the chestnut tip broadej
than on the corresponding feathers of most Chukars. The bill is propoij
tionately a little smaller and, although I have not seen a live Rock Part
ridge, I think it might appear a little more delicate in shape.
The calls of the two are said by some authorities (e.g. Watson) to diffe
greatly but by others (e.g. Menzdorf, Cramp et al ) to be similar. No
having heard Rock Partridges I will not venture a personal opinion on th
matter but hope that some of our readers will have kept both and cai
enlighten us.
Geographically the Rock Partridge meets or overlaps with the range o
the Red-legged Partridge in the south-western Alps but the two appea

)rmally or always to inhabit different areas, the Rock Partridge breeding
higher elevations. Watson found evidence of similar altitudinal separa-
on where the Rock Partridge and the Chukar appear to overlap geogra-
lically in Thrace and in eastern Bulgaria. He found no evidence of inter-
eeding and no hybrids or intergrades among the many specimens he col-
cted. On the other hand Nicolai states definitely that the two hybridise
this region and treats the Chukar as a race of the Rock Partridge 'weil es
he Chukar) . mit ihn (the Rock Partridge) bastardiert .' Menzdorf
qotes Russian sources that claim a hybrid zone exists at some eastern
inges of A. graeca's range and that captive-bred hybrids are fertile.
The Rock Partridge is found in mountainous regions from the western
dps east to Thrace and Bulgaria and south through Italy and Sicily. It
ainly inhabits dry, rocky areas between tree-line and snow-line, mainly
fairly open areas which include heathland, open sparse woodland, scrub
id pastureland. It prefers south-facing slopes and sunny places generally,
is a permanent resident where found. In hard weather it may enter barns
: other buildings in search of food (Menzdorf). It appears to have de-
feased and/or to be (or still be) declining over most of its range. The de-
&gt; rioration of the climate in the more northerly and western parts of its
stribution, the decrease of old farming methods (in the Alps), and the
/er increasing predation on it by sportsmen have all been suggested as
ossible factors. I will discuss further in this article the widespread intro-
action of the Chukar into parts of its range.
According to Watson the Rock Partridge is less easy to keep in captivity
tan is the Chukar. Two aviculturists quoted by Raethel et al (pp. 268 and
59) both state that the Rock Partridge is less lively (lebhaft) in captivity
lan the Chukar but one of them implies that it is equally easy to keep,
oth make the point that whereas the Chukar is widely imported, sold and
red on the Continent, the Rock Partridge is rarely available from dealers,
laking a long term view I don't think the future looks over bright for the
ock Partridge although perhaps not so black as that for the Red-leg.

Watson thinks, probably correctly, that it is most closely allied to the|
Rock Partridge, which must (if this is the case) formerly have had a much
more extensive range. Watson suggests that the Chukar must have origina-
ted from a population of Rock Partridges which became isolated some-
where in the Himalayas or the Middle East and developed qualities that
enabled it later to spread and supplant its parent form, the Rock Partridge,
throughout most of the latter's former range.
In view of the obvious political, geographical and other obstacles, il
seems unlikely that any readers of this article, even those living in 'the
USA, so vast, so friendly and so rich' (as the poet W.H. Auden justly des-

Philby's Partridge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994181807692308" page_id="58077752"  page_num="Page 30" year="" vol="">
This species is very similar to the Chukar and Rock Partridges but a
shade smaller and with a more tawny tinge to the greyish brown parts of
its plumage. Its most striking difference is the entirely black face and
throat (see sketch). It also lacks the laced pattern on the scapulars which
are uniform greyish drab like the back. When the Chukar and the Rock
Partridge were generally thought to be conspecific, this bird was often put
as a race of A. graeca. However, this is not feasible (at least not in our
present state of knowledge, or lack of knowledge about it). If A. philbyil
ever came into contact with A graeca or A. chukar , its very different facial
pattern might, as in all probability it does between A. philbyi and the
Arabian Partridge A. melanocphala, act as an isolating mechanism.
Philby's Partridge is found only in south-western Arabia, from Taif
south to the Asir mountains. It overhaps geographically with the Arabian
Partridge but is said usually to occur on more densely bushy slopes and at
higher altitudes. However, much more study needs to be done on these
two species in the wild (and hopefully, for details of voice and behaviour, j
on tame birds in aviaries). I have not read of Philby's Partridge having been :
imported into other countries. Perhaps it's being less beautiful than thei
Chukar, and less strikingly different from the latter species than is the
Arabian Partridge, has been in part the reason for this.
The Arabian Partridge
This species is appreciably larger and proportionately longer-tailed)
than other members of the genus. The difference in size between the sexes
also appears, so far as one can judge from museum skins (I have not seen))
the living bird), greater than in other Alectoris.

arround of the white lower face and throat are elongated and probably
ive, at least if slightly erected, a crested and 'bearded' impression in life,
here is a beautiful colour plate of the Arabian Partridge, by our late
lember Mr. David Reid Henry in Meinertzhagen's Birds of Arabia. The
sneral coloration is a very pale brown and pale grey. The scapular feathers,
iQ d to a lesser extent many on the mantle, back and sides of the breast are
ale bluish grey, bordered with pale fawn. The flank feathers are pale
luish grey banded with cream bands which are bordered by narrow black
ands (see sketch). The black top to the head makes the white stripe over
de eye, a striking feature of all but one of the Alectoris species, perhaps
&amp;apos;en more conspicuous in this bird.
The Arabian Partridge is found, in suitable habitat, from near Mecca in
estern Arabia south to Aden and east to Oman. The populations in the
orthern and eastern Hadramaut average a little paler in colour and are
dually given subspecific rank under the name A. melanocephala guichardi.
Like its congeners, this species frequents rocky hills, valleys (wadis)
id, it is said, also upland plains. Little seems to have been recorded of
; behaviour. Meinertzhagen says it is 'probably polygamous' but gives no
idence for this opinion. It was bred with some (but not very much) suc-
ss in captivity in Devon in 1927 and the fact recorded in our magazine
eth-Smith, 1928). I have seen the skin of a captive-bred hybrid between
is species and the Chukar. It is a relatively dull bird, lacking the full
auty of either parent and with (surprisingly) a dull greyish throat and
wer face.

The Red-legged Partridge
I consider this bird even more handsome than its congeners, with the
possible exception of the very pale and pinkish desert race of the Chukar,
which is found in parts of Syria and Sinai. Perhaps I am biased because as
a very small child I was enchanted by a description, and later an excel-
lently coloured toy model, of the North American Robin Moth, which has
rather similar rich but harmonious colour combinations, and because ) j
later kept Red-legged Partridges myself. I described my experiences with
this most beautiful and endearing bird in an earlier issue of our magazine |
(Goodwin, 1954).
The Redleg is a warm olive brown on the upperparts (but can bleach to j
a light dusty greyish brown in worn plumage) with a wine-red tinge on the
neck and upper breast. The lower face and throat are pure white, encircled
with black, this black surround 'running into' the lower throat and sides of
neck in a kind of beautiful necklace-like effect. The lower breast is rich
bluish grey, the belly deep reddish buff. The barred flank feathers are
more richly coloured than, and differ from those of all other Alectoris in
having only one black cross band. Each feather shows bright bluish grey,
then a pale cream band, bordered only on the outer edge with black, then|
a wide terminal band of deep, bright chestnut.

The Redleg occurs naturally in southern France, the Iberian Peninsula

just possible that it may have been introduced there as in Madeira an
some of the Canary Islands. As recently as the 16th century it occurre

already described for its congeners, it also breeds successfully in more or
less flat agricultural country although, unlike the Common Partridge, sel-
dom in extensive fields or meadows unless these are diversified with some
small hills, old quarries, raised banks, heaps of stones or gravel or similar
features.
Varying numbers of geographical subspecies have been recognised by
various authors, mostly on minor differences. In general, the populations
from southern Iberia are darker than those from further north.
The Barbary Partridge
* This species differs considerably from the others in the colour and
Pattern of its head and neck. A broad, chestnut brown, blackish-edged
[ &amp;apos;tripe runs along the top of its head from the base of the bill to the hind
ieck. The broad stripe over the eyes, the lower face and the throat are
light grey, and there is a large patch of dark or light (according to race)
"hestnut, spotted with white, on each side of the neck. The flank barring

There are photographs, and delightful sketches illustrating its displays
and some other postures, in the paper on its behaviour by de Reyna and
Alvarez, and there are good colour drawings in Jonsson.
The&amp;apos; Barbary Partridge is found from north-western Africa east to
coastal eastern Libya (see Harrison for distribution map) and has been
introduced to some of the Canary Islands, Gibraltar, and probably also
to Sardinia and to Porto Santo.
Some comments on the Chukar in Britain and Europe
People and organisations concerned with bird conservation in Britain
appear to regard gamebirds (pheasants, partridges and grouse) as outside
their field of interest. There are good, or at any rate expedient reasons
for this, which I do not propose to discuss here. Not surprisingly perhaps,|
most 'rank and file' birdwatchers have taken the cue from 'their betters
and subscribe to the view that these beautiful creatures are not, and
should not be, of any concern except to those who enjoy killing them. |
Hence, although those in authority in such matters are now generally
'dead against' the introduction of any foreign species of bird or beast (to
such an extent that a most eminent person has felt it necessary to write
apologetically because he has enriched our avifauna and our lives by intro-
ducing a harmless and beautiful bird) no hint of criticism has been voiced
against the extensive introduction of the Chukar. It, of course, was nol
introduced for aesthetic, sentimental or other such despicable reasons but
for the improvement of 'legitimate sport', a most commendable aim in the)
view of our masters.
Both Chukars and Chukar x Redleg hybrids are said to have beer
widely introduced but all the references I have seen have given little or nc
detailed information. One writer (Lever, 1977) states that the Chukar i
established on part of the South Downs and that the Rock Partridge i
established in Scotland. This latter I find hard to believe and wonder (it
view of Continental statements about the rarity of the Rock Partridge it
trade) if there has not been misidentification.
My own personal knowledge of the Chukar here has been mainly of th
species in a part of Kent. Here both I and others have seen numbers in th
past three years. A birdwatcher friend of mine, not knowing of the Che
kar's introduction, had not separated the species from the Redleg and wa
astonished, after I had told him how to do so, at finding it the mor
abundant of the two in some (but not most) parts of the places he visits.
I saw two pairs of Chukars in the spring of 1984 and no Redlegs (in th
limited area I covered) although there were apparently pure Redlegs thei
in the following autumn. This spring, on 5th March (1985), I saw mutui
threat display and other interactions that gave me the impression that th

&gt;irds were regarding each other as conspecifics. This appeared to be con-
irmed on a later visit, on 2nd May, when I saw in all four pairs of Alec-
oris, two of which were two Redlegs, and the other two pairs each of a
Chukar paired to a Redleg.
About eight years ago an ornithologist who then lived in Andorra told
ne that there, and in adjacent parts of northern Spain, the long-continued
eleasing of Chukars by the sporting fraternity had resulted in extensive
nterbreeding and (my informant was a bird artist) he found it impossible
o obtain phenotypically pure Redlegs locally for his illustrative work.
,
r As early as the 1950s I was told that Chukars and Chukar x Redleg hy-
&gt;rids had been widely introduced in southern France.
Thus it looks as if the Redleg may well be threatened in Britain and in
ts native haunts as well. Since the Chukar will either interbreed with or
ompete with it. On present, but so far very scanty, evidence, it seems that
nterbreeding is more likely.
I am not one of those who are against all introductions and if we did
lot have the Redleg here already, I would have no objections to the intro-
luction of the Chukar. As it is, however, the Redleg having so much smaller
world range and being already fairly well established here, I do not think
; t was justifiable to introduce the Chukar, and deliberately to introduce it
);fito precisely those areas where the Redleg was established and moderately
ommon.
It appears (Menzdorf, Nicolai) that the Chukar has also been widely
Produced into the native range of the Rock Partridge. It is perhaps even
lore likely to interbreed with or supplant this species, though from an
i esthetic point of view the loss would be less, as the Rock and Chukar
artridges are so similar in appearance whereas the Redleg differs in many
satures. However, the sportsmen will do what they want and if they fi-
ally decide that the Chukar really is a 'better sporting bird', the Rock
artridge and the Redleg, and perhaps later the Barbary, Philby's, Arabian
nd Large Rock Partridges, will be deliberately replaced by it.
It is to be hoped, but not expected, that some aviculturists will be
ble to conserve pure stocks of the other Alectoris species if and when this
appens, or rather in anticipation before it does.
I would, incidentally, be most grateful if any knowledgeable reader can
I ive us a description of the Chukar x Redleg hybrids. All I have seen in
tie wild have appeared 'pure' Redleg or pure Chukar 'in the binoculars'
it I have not, of course, been able to examine them critically in the hand,

The Cape Siskin Serinus totta is also known as the Totta Siskin , Siskin
.anary and Rock Canary. It is a shy and unobtrusive species and usually
&gt;ccurs in pairs or small groups of up to 15 birds.
, The canary-like song is soft and pleasant with a similar flight call to
hat of the Yellow-eyed Canary Serinus mozambicus. The male has the
rown and nape light brown streaked darker brown; mantle, scapulars and
/ing-coverts slightly russet earth-brown; rump olivaceous yellow; sides of
ace and ear-coverts yellowish brown; underparts dull olivaceous yellow;
/hite tips to wing and tail feathers diagnostic for both sexes; eye brown;
*ill brownish, paler below; legs and feet pale brown. The female differs
rom the male in having the underparts lime green; throat and breast
*livaceous yellow, throat streaked brown. Juveniles have the chin to chest
nd upper flanks streaked with dusky.
This siskin is found in the western Cape Province of South Africa in
be northern Cedarberg to the Great Kei River. It lives in bushes and scrub
1 mountainous regions, in exotic pine plantations and sometimes occurs
long the coast.
If The diet includes graminoid seed, archenes, foliage buds, fresh floral
arts, nectar and animal matter. A summary of food genera recorded in
le diet of this species: Urticaceae (nettle family); Chenopodium
= Chenopodiaceae - the ganna, salt bush and goosefoot family); Ficinia
= Cyperaceae - sedge family); Leucadendron, Protea (Proteaceae - protea
imily); Restio, Thamnochortus (= Restionaceae - the reed family); animal
latter was unidentified (Milewski, 1978). Barnicoat (1983) reports that in
aptivity it will take a seed diet supplemented by green food; egg food
nd soaked seed is suitable for rearing with a daily supply of spinach beet,
adive, chickweed and seeding grass heads, and it is extremely partial to
iger seed. Aviary observations have revealed the taking of termite alates
uring nesting, also Khaki weed Alternanthera pungens, Canary creeper
enecio tamoides and Pepperweed Lepidium africanum.
During nesting three to five plain white eggs are laid in a shallow cup
diich is fairly well-built of fine dry grass and rootlets, lined with finer
rass, maidenhair fern, wool or some hair. The furry down of protea has
Iso been recorded as a nest lining. The nest, the cup of which has a
iameter of 5.1 cm and a depth of 2 cm, is placed on a rock ledge, or in a
ollow rock, often concealed by low shrubs growing out of the cliff face.

Steyn and Myburgh (1980) record a nest in the hole in the trunk of a large]
tree at 3.6 m from the ground. In captivity it prefers to utilise a nest-box
and may use dried lettuce, watercress and chickweed as nesting materials
and coir or seedheads as lining. The nest building is carried out by the
female with the male accompanying her on collecting trips. Only the
female incubates, for 16-17 days, with the male feeding her at the nest]
Both adults remove faeces from the nest during the whole nestling period.j
The young leave the nest at 20-24 days, and are fed by both parents by

Cuculus solitarius. It has been suggested that the cuckoo may have mis-
taken its host's nest as being that of the Dusky Flycatcher Muscicapa
adusta.
Hybrids between this species and a male Oriental Greenfinch Carduelis
sinica, Cape Canary Serinus canicollis and Black-throated Canary Serinus
atrogularis have been recorded.
The Drakenberg Siskin Serinus totta symonsi, or, to give it its alterna-
tive names, Mountain Siskin or Brown Canary, is a less attractive subspecies
that differs from the typical totta mainly in respect of its basic colouring.
Males lack the white-tipped secondary and tail feathers of the Cape Siskin.
The female is duller and browner below by comparison with S. t. totta. It
occurs in western Natal, Orange Free State and north-eastern Cape, pro-
vinces of South Africa, Transkei and the mountains of Lesotho. Little is
known of its feeding habits in the wild except that seeds, buds, insects and
the soft bases of Erythrina flowers form the diet. In captivity the birds will
accept the same basic diet as S.t. totta with the addition of Black-jack
Bidens pilosa , Bird grass Poa trivialis, Small Canary grass Phalaris minor
j and the buds of Smeltersbossie Flaveria bidentis. Egg colouring differs
from totta being white to pale greenish blue, sparingly spotted with grey
and brown mainly at the large end. The incubation and nestling periods
for the wild and in captivity are unrecorded.

Turdus merula
By Dr. M.A. SCHLEE
(Museum of Natural History, Paris, France)
A male Blackbird was found as a fledgling in the French department o
Hauts-de-Seine in June 1975, hand-reared and named 'Koko\ The bird wa:
given to me when he was about 45 days old, and was then used in a stud)
on the development of prey-attack behaviour in Blackbirds (Schlee, 1983)
From the second year on, Koko was free-ranging in the Insectary green
house (7.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 m) which he claimed as his territory; he also mad"
frequent excursions into the adjoining rooms of the Insectary in search o
insects and spiders. At the age of seven years, Koko had a traumati.
experience which terminated in total blindness. This paper will recoun
how he was able to adapt to his infirmity and be successfully maintains
in his usual environment for several months before being caught by
stray cat on 10th October 1982.
Events leading to blindness
Blackbirds are known to be highly territorial and aggressive (Snow,
1958; Hambly, 1966), but until the end of December 1981, the garden
birds had never engaged my Blackbirds in territorial combat. At that time,
however, a juvenile male had just established himself in the garden sur-
rounding the Insectary. The two birds fought nearly every day, pecking at
each other across the glass panels and roof of the greenhouse. In doing so
Koko was apparently rubbing and hitting his eyes against the glass, the
impact of which was sufficient to provoke the formation of a cataract in
each eye.
During the last week in February 1982, Koko's flight and feeding
behaviour had become noticeably abnormal. After a violent fight on 3rc
March, Koko showed signs of cerebral trauma and received veterinar&gt;
attention; I then learned that a cataract had formed in the right eye whicf
had been so damaged that it was no longer functional. By 22nd March
cataract had formed in the left eye, but some peripheral vision still re
mained: Koko was able to visually follow side-to-side hand movement:
executed at a maximum distance of 0.72 m, but only in the lower half o
the frontal visual field. Since the left eye was still functional, visual capa
bilities were able to be increased by applying eye-drops for dilating th&amp;lt;
pupil. It is difficult to say when Koko lost all sight, for there were n
major changes in behaviour. A routine check of the peripheral visual fieh

arried out during August revealed that Koko was completely blind at
hat time.
Phase 1:-Loss of sight in right eye
Some of Koko's abnormal behaviour patterns were probably due both
d brain damage and to the progressive formation of a cataract in the left
ye. During this period, Koko was highly unco-ordinated and often went
irough bouts of stereotyped pecking movements directed into the bowl
f commercial feed, but none of the food was touched. Other abnormal
ehaviour, such as flying in a circle around a point before trying to land
r walking into obstacles, was also noted. In addition, there was a clear
ick of accuracy in seizing insects regardless of their mobility, and Koko
[ways gave several initial pecks to either side into the void. The typical,
Iternated monocular fixation movements were retained, but as soon as

le insect came into the visual field of the right eye, Koko either walked
n it or left. There was also a sharp drop in foraging behaviour: Koko
lent most of the day perched in the same place with his good eye direc-
;d toward the entrance; he no longer went into the Insectary in search
f insects, nor did he dig in the compost pile on the far side of the green-
ouse. In fact, his movements were restricted to about one-fourth of the
lace available. During this time Koko seldom sang and seemed tired and
stless. He also started becoming highly fearful and aggressive; when
pproached, he backed up a few steps and then launched a defensive

The first striking change in behaviour was the abrupt loss of all acti-
ity, including feeding. Koko spent four days at a veterinary clinic where
n energetic treatment was undertaken to try to favour the resorption of
le cataract. During his stay, he succeeded in locating half a hard-boiled
gg and half an apple placed in his cage, but no attempts were made to
at either insects or commercial feed. Since Koko did not eat enough to
maintain correct body weight, I force-fed him with meat, insects, a
itamin supplement and Glucidic Trophysan (Laboratory EGIC, Montar-
is, France). The latter substance, containing all necessary amino acids,
ad to be diluted in order to avoid the bird choking on it. Whenever I
Manipulated Koko, he would suddenly go limp and play dead (head
ailing forward, eyes closed); but as soon as I released my grip, he at-
acked my hand or retreated. Since the tail feathers were fanned and
epressed in a typical threatening posture, Koko generally walked on
lem and had difficulty maintaining his balance while backing up; at
aat point he always attacked. The same behaviour was shown when

Koko was entirely blind.
When Koko was brought back to the greenhouse, he was placed in a
small cage (0.58 x 0.26 x 0.37 m) equipped with a median horizontal
perch and a diagonal one extending from it. The cage was installed next
to the usual feeding site. Koko was caged for safety reasons: the sudden
loss of sight provoked uncontrolled, unoriented escape behaviour and
general signs of panic. Koko acted as if the sudden darkness was due to I
external factors which could be overcome through escape manoeuvres.
It is interesting to note that the same type of behaviour was always
elicited when Koko was enclosed in a box for transportation purposes;
there was a very close correlation between the waning of this behaviour
and the resumption of self-feeding.
The first step was to teach Koko to locate food in his cage. Half a
hard-boiled egg and half an apple were always available and were placed
in the same spot; these items were quickly discovered. But prey items
(mealworms, crickets and cockroaches) had to be small enough to be
able to be swallowed with a minimum of handling. To make it easier
for Koko to find them, I used a small pottery bowl that had an opening
of 4 cm and a depth of 2 cm and attracted Koko's attention by tapping
on it with my finger. Since Koko always vigorously pecked at my hand,
it was quite easy to deflect his pecking movements to the dish of insects.
If Koko dropped an insect on the ground, he relocated it by tilting his
head in such a way as to use his peripheral visual field; but even so, he i
could only determine the approximate direction and always gave several
haphazard pecks before finding the insect. I was also able to train Koko I
to take mealworms directly from my hand: I had to hold the insect in
such a way that a forward pecking movement would immediately estab-
lish contact with it, and I always first called Koko by name. j
By 29th March 1982 Koko's general behaviour and his weight were!
returning to normal and I started letting him out of his cage for a few
hours every day. At that time he occasionally bathed, sang, flew to the |
opposite side of the greenhouse and even sunbathed under the rafters.
From 7th April on, Koko was once again free-ranging in the greenhouse.
The next step was to teach Koko to locate food placed at his usuaf
feeding site. Two half apples impaled on wooden spikes and half a hard-;
boiled egg were lined up next to each other; Koko had no apparent
difficulty locating them. The small pottery bowl was also aligned and
firmly fastened into the ground; I attracted Koko's attention by tapping
on the bowl. At this signal Koko always rushed to the dish site, tapped
from side to side with his beak until he located the bowl, then tapped!
the rim before pecking into it. By 13th April Koko no longer tried to
fixate the insects by cocking his head from side to side. However, it

took until 16th May for Koko to learn how to eat his usual commercial
feed (Sluis' feed for insectivorous birds) and this seemed to have been
facilitated by changing the type of dish.
Before Koko became visually impaired, he always ate from a heavy
glass receptacle (11 cm diam., 4.4 cm deep) by perching on the rim and
then leaning forward to seize the feed. After losing his eyesight, Koko
continued this behaviour but with one basic difference: the distance
that he leaned forward was fixed and was insufficient to allow him to
touch the feed even if the dish was full; apparently he never tried to
eat from a standing position. I finally found a dish that allowed Koko to
touch the bottom when leaning forward from a standing position. (In
this case he never tried to perch on the rim.) The receptacle was oval in
shape (12.4 x 5 cm), had a total height of 4 cm, but because of its raised
bottom, was only 2.7 cm deep. Within one week Koko had perfected his
feeding techniques, but he always remained incapable of seizing the
morsels - his beak was used as a shovel and whatever feed entered it was
swallowed.
Spatial orientation was probably facilitated by the layout of the green-
house: along the front (divided into two equal parts by the entrance and a
:ement passage leading to the back rooms) and along the sides, there is a
built-in, cement shelf, 96 cm wide, located at about 74 cm from the
ground. This structure is filled with dirt and contains tropical plants.
Nearly all of Koko's manoeuvres took place on this platform in an L-shaped
area approximately 2.86 m across the front and 1.76 m along the side,
which included the usual feeding and bathing sites. Koko's itineraries
followed the walls of the greenhouse and the ledge of the platform, and
ncluded several cross routes and precise stopping points. When Koko
accidentally stepped over the ledge, he generally flew back to his starting
mint; however, if he landed on the ground, he often retreated into a
:orner and I was obliged to recover him. Koko also used the space between
the platform and the roof and had several precise perching sites: the main
me was an overhanging branch located about 2 m from the ground and
Dut about 57 cm from the ledge. In order to orient himself, Koko darted
from one side of his feeding site to the other, touching the plants and the
flower pots, toward the back where he came into contact with a small
wooden footstool, then out to the edge of the platform. Flight-intention
movements were shown at each stopping point. When the direction of the
branch seemed to be located, Koko flew forward; if he missed it, he
immediately returned to the platform and repeated the orientation move-
ments.

Phase 3: Total loss of sight
Blindness did not modify the behaviour that had developed during the
period of peripheral vision in only one eye; however, Koko's level of
activity always remained low. Body weight was maintained throughout
this period, and moulting was carried out correctly. In order to get Koko
to eat insects, I continued to put them in the small pottery bowl or to give
them to him direct. In the latter instance, I always called Koko by name
and continued talking to him while quietly approaching; any sudden noise
provoked intense panic. I then gently touched the tip of his beak with the
insect and held it in front of him; Koko only pecked straight ahead even if j
he missed the insect. During this phase Koko never dropped a prey item on
the ground. All insects were slightly mandibulated and, if necessary, re-
oriented in the beak for swallowing. When locating the drinking bowl, Koko
stopped at a short distance from it and tapped with his beak; as soon as he
struck the rim, he slipped his beak along the inner side until he touched
the water.
Orientation from the ground improved with time: when Koko was in
the middle of his half of the greenhouse, he gave many flight-intention
movements in the direction of the platform while running back and forth
between the steps near the entrance and his starting point. In this way he
was apparently able to determine his position, and when he finally flew ,
up, he landed on or near the wooden footstool behind the bathing recep- j
tacle; nonetheless, his occasional excursions to other parts of the green- j
house were not so well-oriented.
Koko spent a lot of time at one of the screen windows where he could
'survey' the garden, as he did every year before becoming blind. Inside the
greenhouse a piece of glass had been leaned against the screen, leaving a
space of about 15 cm. Koko was well-acquainted with the route leading to
and from the window. At that time I did not realise the potential danger
of such a set-up. A stray cat must have noticed that Koko did not react to
its presence and took advantage of the situation by tearing off part of the
screen. No feathers were found near the window, so I assume that Koko
played dead as he usually did when I picked him up. The first trace of
contour feathers was found at more that 15 m from the greenhouse. Koko
had managed to escape from the cat and was found several metres further
away, but he was too seriously injured to survive. Judging from the cut
marks around the beak, Koko must have become panic-stricken (probably
by the sound of the screen being ripped off), and, instead of leaving the
window by his usual route, must have persistently jumped against the
screen (1cm wire mesh).

The only effective way of stopping the fights with the garden Blackbird
would have been to cut off visual contact. Wire netting on the outside of
the greenhouse was not sufficient, for the captive bird continued tapping
against the glass during its attacks and, therefore, considerable portions
of the glass panels were whitewashed. In a similar situation, it is vital that
these measures are taken at the first sign of agonistic behaviour. The
corners under the rafters are particularly dangerous if there is a support on
which the captive bird can perch, for from this position the bird can rub
its eyes against the glass when turning in circles trying to peck at the feet
of its adversary.
When I first released Koko in the greenhouse during phase two, I
thought there would be no more problems with the garden male since
Koko could not see him. However, as soon as the young male landed on a
narrow ledge located at the level of the cement platform, Koko rushed to
the spot and resumed fighting. Auditory cues probably alerted him to the
presence of his rival, for the young male gave the strangled song while ag-
gressively displaying. These panels were also whitewashed and, in addi-
tion, a wire grating was placed on the outside in such a way as to prevent
the young male from landing on or near the ledge. The garden male also
fought with the six-year-old, hand-reared male whose breeding success in
captivity was previously reported in this magazine (Schlee, 1981 and
1982). Their fights also took place across the glass panels of the green-
house which, in turn, had to be whitewashed. In addition^these two birds
fought at the screen window and across the netting of the aviary when the
roof of the greenhouse was open; but the garden bird never fought with
the adult male offspring of the established nesting pair although they were
housed in adjacent aviaries.
Several points concerning the care of a blind bird should be empha-
sised. First, the bird should be left in its usual environmental setting and
all objects should be maintained in their respective positions. This allows
the bird to use locational information that was acquired before going
blind. In the case of Koko, general topographical orientation was probably
aided by the presence in the greenhouse of a number of smaller avian
species whose behaviour could have provided additional locational infor-
mation. Secondly, it is rather difficult to get the bird to eat correctly once
the initial traumatic reaction has been overcome. Although apples and
hard-boiled eggs seem to be easy to discover during haphazard movements,
special steps must be taken to train the blind bird to locate dishes of food
and to associate the receptacle with a particular food item. Koko was easy
to train since he already had the habit of attacking my hand; his attacks
could, therefore, be directed toward a dish in which he could discover

something to eat. Once this discovery has been made, the bird can be
trained to approach at a given signal (e.g. tapping the container). The size
and the shape of the feeding dish are also very important. Thirdly, long
distance orientation improves with time and partly depends on auditory
cues. Koko was finally able to move about in a little less than half of the
greenhouse and quite visibly listened to sounds coming from the open
windows, the door, the sink, etc. All major routes were quite stereotyped,
and Koko was able to go rapidly to his feeding site from any point in his
restricted territory. However, objects at close range were always located
and identified by systematic tapping with the beak.
Koko's successful re-adaptation clearly shows that the Blackbird is
capable of topographically orienting itself by using sensory modalities
other than vision and of forming a cognitive map of its spatial environ-
ment.

On 25th September and again on 8th October 1985, I was escorted
round the zoo in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province in China. The
zoo is in the suburbs of the city (of 1.4 million people, with another seven
million around). It moved there from a downtown site in 1976. At its
earlier location the zoo dated back however, only to 1953. I was twice
shown round by the assistant director Madame Song Yunfang, and met the
director Mr. He Guangzin. The total zoo staff is 260 persons. On the
second visit I was accompanied also by Zheng Junfan, an ornithologist from
the Biology Department of Sichuan University. Apparently the zoo
receives two million visitors a year, each one paying 20 feng, i.e. about 7
U.S. cents.
I was told there were about 100 species of birds kept at the zoo. The
following is my attempt to outline the establishment's bird population,
with special attention to the pheasant and crane families.
No less than six species of crane were present. There were four Sudan
Crowned Cranes Balearica pavonina from Africa, and five east Asiatic
species. These were: six White-naped Cranes Grus vipio, four Hooded
Cranes G. monacha, three Demoiselles Anthropoides virgo, five Red-
crowned Cranes Grus japonensis, and four Common Cranes G. grus . The
zoo had sent its two Black-necked Cranes G. nigricollis elsewhere; one to
Beijing zoo, the other to the zoo at Sining (the capital of Tsinghai pro-
vince).
I specially asked about Phasianids and was told that the following
species were present at the zoo; most of them I saw myself:

There were only a few individuals of each species.
On or by the zoo's large lake were two Mute Swans Cygnus olor, and ,1
21 adult Whooper Swans C. cygnus, plus seven young Whoopers hatched ||
earlier in the year at the zoo. There were half a dozen Eastern Greylags i
Anser anser rubrirostris, two White-fronted Geese A. albifrons, six Swanj
Geese A. cygnoides, one Bar-headed Goose A. indicus, two Shelducks|
Tadoma tadoma and one Ruddy Shelduck T. fenruginea, a dozen Man-l
darins Aix galericulata, a few Mallards Anas platyrhynchos, a few Wigeon |
A. penelope , a Pochard Aythya ferina and at least one presumed Scaup j
A. marila. There was one Coot fulica atra and three Black-tailed Gulls ]
Lams crassirostris. Two Oriental White Storks, birds of an eastern form;
held by some to be a separate species, Ciconia boyciana, were a pleasure
to behold. An albino Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo was preening itself [
alongside three Dalmatian Pelicans Pelecanus crispus.
In a large cage for water and waterside birds were three Black Swans i
Cygnus atratus, four Spoonbills (sadly Platalea alba and not minor , the
scarce Black-faced species), three Sacred Ibises Threskiomis aethiopica no.
doubt of the local race melanocephalus, three Little Egrets Egretta gar -

Storks Ciconia nigra. There were also six Black-headed Gulls Lams ridi-
bundus.
A flight cage for raptors housed a Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos , a
Pallas's Fish Eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus, a Lammergeyer Gypaetus
barbatus, two Black Vultures Aegypius monachus and five Himalayan
Griffons Gyps himalayensis. Nearby were two large owls; I suspect they
were Eagle Owl Bubo bubo and Tawny Fish Owl Ketupa flavipes but am
not sure.

ipecies of Amazona (one of each), and four Fischer's Lovebirds Agapomis
Ischeri, and two species of macaw, the Blue and Gold Ara ararauna and
probably) the Military A. militaris. There were two Lord Derby's Parra-
ceets Psittacula derbiana. This species is indigenous to Sichuan and China.
Two ratites were the Emu Dromaius novaehollandiae and the Ostrich
)truthio camelus.
Indigenous Chinese passerines on display included one Grey or Hima-
ayan Tree Pi eDendrocitta formosaeXy beautiful bird), two White-throated
ind four Greater Necklaced Laughingthrushes Garrulax albogularis and
j. pectoralis, one Oriental Greenfinch Carduelis sinica, one White-rumped
dunia Lonchura striata , four Black-headed Hawfinches Coccothraustes
nigratorius and two 'straight' Hawfinches C. coccothraustes - half-a-dozen
^ekin Robins Leiothrix lutea, and 50-100 Zosterops , some at least being
Chestnut-flanked Whiteyes Z. erythropleura. There was a Rook Corvus
rugilegus, a Magpie Pica pica , three Red-billed Blue Magpies Urocissa
'rythrorhyncha , ten White-cheeked Starlings Stumus cineraceus, and one
Crested Mynah Acridotheres fuscus javanicus. Thrushes included one
dagpie Robin Copsychus saularis, one Dusky Thrush Turdus naumanni
jind one (apparently) Eye-browed Thrush T. obscurus.
I enquired about the three Sichuan endemics, the Szechwan Hill Part-
idge Arborophila rufipectus , the Omei Shan Liocichla Leiocichla omeien-
is and the Crested Parrotbill Paradoxornis zappeyi, but none was held in
he zoo.
The last bird I'll mention is the local Quail Coturnix cotumix japonica.
There were two or three at the zoo. This species had been domesticated in
Thina. I visited one Quail 'farm' where there were 80,000 birds, five
emales to every two males. The males are used for breeding and sold for
neat. The females produce about 300 eggs in their first year and are then
filled for meat. The farm's output was 30,000 eggs a day or well over ten
million eggs a year. But the domestication of birds is another story, as is
:he current role of wild birds-of-prey in Chinese traditional medicine.
*
Some of their avian stock the zoo no doubt get from the wild-bird
markets of the city and smaller outlying towns, several of which I visited.
To sum up. There were at least 86 different bird species in Chengdu
zoo in September-October 1985. I probably missed another 10%. Of these
86, 82 were positively identified; and of these no less than 28 (33%) are
on the list of wild birds for Chengdu and its environs (Zhang Junfan,
1985) and 60 (71%) are on the list for the province of Sichuan (Shi
Bainan and Zhao Ermi, 1982). By comparison with many western zoos
this must surely be a high percentage of 'locals'?
As a tailpiece let me mention the Turkey Meleagris gallopavo. Its

picture appears in the zoo guide and until early November 1983 there were
four birds. Two of these I am reliably told by a local American succumbed
to Thanksgiving! In 1985 I could find not two but none; but, of course,
there had been another giving of thanks in November 1984!

NEWS FROM LEEDS CASTLE

The late Hon. Lady Olive Baillie, who was a member of the Avicultural
Society, established world-famous aviaries at Leeds Castle some 30 years
ago and her enthusiasm brought many rare and varied species to the Castle,
and in particular she loved the Rosellas and Ring-necked Parrakeets. Since
her death the collection has been maintained and still includes many
interesting colour mutations.
The Leeds Castle Foundation, a registered charity, is now constructing
a modern and very extensive facility, next to the Culpeper Garden, to be
ready later this year, which we hope will establish Leeds Castle as the
home of one of the outstanding collections in this country and give as
much pleasure to our visitors as it did to Lady Baillie.
The aviaries are being built of stainless steel frames which will be
enclosed by removable panels of wire that will have no edges showing. The
frames are quite an architectural masterpiece with a Victorian style roof.
Each aviary will have a small pool of water in the front that can be
drained from the outside and will blend in well with the natural perches
and nest-boxes. The strings of rectangular aviaries between the hexagonal
flights will have slanted concrete floors with a drain at the back and will

i be covered with rock and gravel. This will allow cleaning to be done from
the outside and provide proper drainage in inclement weather. Each
flight will also have an area at the rear that will serve as winter quarters,
should the birds require additional shelter. We feel that the design will be
dean and easy to maintain and should offer all the security necessary for
breeding as well as providing an attractive exhibition for the public.
A modern hospital, incubator room (with back-up power source),
proper food stores and kitchen are attached to the main block of flights.
The kitchen will be on public display so that food preparation and hand-
ifeeding may be observed.
We are designing educational tours for school groups and special
interest groups that will be centred around behind-the-scenes activities.
The centrepiece of the Lady Baillie Memorial Aviary will be the Aus-
tralian species that Lady Baillie was so fond of, but it will also include
; many other types of birds, including macaws, Amazon parrots, cockatoos
and many softbills, as well as finches.
We have had much valued advice from the avicultural world, and in
particular Raymond Sawyer, Rosemary Low and Dr. James Dolan (Gen-
eral Curator for the San Diego Zoo).Everyone at Leeds Castle including
Peter Taylor, who has taken care of the birds at Leeds Castle for the
last 30 years, staff and the architects and engineers are very excited
about this project and are looking forward to its completion. We would
like to invite members of the Avicultural Society to visit us and hope
that this can be arranged in the spring of 1987.

Having searched unsuccessfully for a mate for our single male Hyacin-
thine Macaw, in the spring of 1984 Bristol Zoo kindly offered to lend us
two females to see which took his fancy. When the weather grew warmer, I
introduced the new females but for 10 weeks our efforts looked in vain for
he took no notice of either female. We decided to send one female back to
Bristol Zoo, leaving us with a pair.
During that summer the pair sometimes sat next to each other but no
signs of breeding were seen. I was not too worried about this as it was their
first year together. Several other macaws were successfully bred, some of
them hand-reared. By the autumn we thought all breeding had Finished
The day arrived when all the birds were to be dusted with Cooper's Louse
Powder to keep at bay any parasites picked up during the summer and by
midday the Hyacinthine Macaws had been reached. Both were dusted and
then I looked quickly (because these two were never the friendliest of
creatures) into the nest-box and to my amazement a two-week old chick
was sitting there! It was decided that, because we had disturbed the
parents and as the chick did not look too healthy, we would hand-rear it.
We managed to rear 'Golly' and also 'George' in 1985; now we have high
hopes for another success in 1986.
This was only made possible by co-operation between our zoos and I
would like to thank Geoffrey Greed, Director of Bristol Zoo, for the loan
of the Hyacinthine Macaw hen.
We have also had an example of co-operation between our birds here.
Five years ago we had four breeding pairs of Quaker Parrakeets in a flight
about 12 x 20 x 10 ft (3.66 x 6.10 x 3.05 m). One night a hole appeared
in the roof and one of the pairs was missing.
Traps were put out immediately but the parrakeets took no notice
mainly because our macaws are kept on barrels outside so the parrakeets
just stole their food.
Later on that year, after pruning a few twigs off the many trees
in the park, a nest 6 ft (1.83 m) in diameter appeared at the top of a pine
tree. Not only did the Quaker Parrakeets nest here, but squirrels, starlings,
sparrows and Bluetits also. Unfortunately this wildlife commune came to
a sad end because the weight of the nest after a storm pulled the tree
over to a 45* angle and we had to take it all away for safety reasons.
After that winter I was looking for some good nesting platforms for my

luck was in for that year the parrakeets built four massive nests and bred
prolific ally. As hoped, these nests made perfect platforms for the spoon-
bills and the two pairs produced four young between them.
As the entrance hole of the parrakeets is always under the mass of
twigs, the two very different birds did not squabble at all!

The most popular aviary at Birdworld must be the Seashore Walk. This |
aviary is about 60 x 120 x 20 ft (18.28 x 36.57 x 6.10 m) and in it is a
wave machine which was specially built for us and works by displacement
of water with a wooden wedge, driven by an electric motor. This produces
a wave about every three seconds. There are many tons of rocks and sand
to produce the effect of a beach with an old rotten boat to add the finish= I
ing touch. The birds housed here are Shags, Oyster-catchers, Inca Terns,
Curlew, Tufted Duck, Goldeneye, Spur-winged Plovers, Eider Duck and,of
course, gulls.
Our visitors seem to be mesmerised by the waves. We once made a sur-
vey at the exit of the Seashore Walk, asking people what birds they had 1
seen. Most of them could not remember two birds! The public are seen
just gazing into the moving water. Last year the Shags, plovers, all of the
ducks and gulls laid eggs so perhaps the waves help to make an environ-
ment as close as possible to their natural surroundings which is what every
aviculturist wants to achieve.

Members of this group of large flightless birds have always been popular
exhibits in both public and the larger private collections and have long
been kept. As with my previous records covering Waterfowl ( Avicultural
Magazine , 1983, Vol. 89, p. 218), each entry constitutes the earliest refer-
ence that I could trace. If any member is able to correct a record, please

The Cape Parrot
Further to my letter on 'Sulking in Parrots, in the last issue (Vol. 91,
No. 4), the pair of Cape Parrots Poicephalus robustus suahelicus (the
Central African subspecies) that I mentioned were sitting on four very
large, round eggs, have successfully reared four healthy young which are
now independent.
Several points have arisen that I find very interesting; firstly, all four
young have left the nest with a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide orange/pink band
across the crown of the head and with a pink blush through the other-
wise grey cheeks. They differ from the adults in not having the orange
colouring on their thighs and wing butts and otherwise resemble the
adult hen. The adult cocks have no colouring on the crown.
1 have read Rosemary Low's excellent article in our magazine in
Volume 88 (1982) No. 1, in which she gives a very detailed description of
the young of this species. I could find no reference anywhere to confirm
whether the young of both sexes leave their nest with identical colouring
(like that of the adult hen) but it would be too much of a coincidence that
these birds should all be hens.
11 find Pj. suahelicus to be a particularly pretty parrot and while some
have a very nervous disposition, this pair and their four young are all very
steady (possibly because the adults are tamed pet birds, and the young
follow their example). A second interesting behaviour pattern of the four
young birds was that all of them, or half at a time, would return to their
nest log sometimes for the whole day, for up to 10 days after leaving their
nest - unlike most South American parrots with which I have experience.
Thirdly, they nested in a log on the ground and were not at all interes-
ted in a natural log that was hung up. The pair tunnelled at ground level
into the log and continued to use this entrance until the young hatched
and with usage this entrance became blocked and they would then enter
from the partly open top.
Fourthly, I have a pair of P. suahelicus from Angola and they seem
generally duller than P. suahelicus from Zimbabwe where my breeding pair
come from and the hen from Angola has a much smaller patch of orange/
pink on the crown. They are not so attractive as their Zimbabwean
cousins.
Then finally, I have experienced, percentage wise, far more stress
sickness in Cape Parrots, more so in the South African formP.r. robustus
than in the Central African race P.r. suahelicus, than I have amongst any
other parrots that I have kept. All were cured except for one hen P.r. rob-
ustus, a tame pet bird that I lost. Of nine Cape Parrots in the collection,

five have been sick at one time or another.
I would suggest to anyone keeping these parrots that once they have
settled down, they should not be moved.
I find them very attractive, lively and most interesting parrots, and the
yellowish neck and darker back contrasting with the orange thighs and
wing butts of the South African race most attractive and very different
from the pinkish/orange crown and silver neck and light green back of the
Central African race.
25th February, 1986.
P.S. It is interesting to note that now the four young parrots reared are
over four months old and into their first moult, they have all lost the
orange cap on their heads and the flush through their cheeks that they had
when they left the nest, but two of them (presumed hens) are now grow-
ing a new batch of stronger coloured orange/red feathers on the crown of
their heads above the top mandible, similar to the adult female. The other
two (presumed cocks) have retained the plain silver head and neck of the
adult male.
I could find no reference in any book to the fact that the young of
both sexes leave the nest with this crown of orange which both sexes lose
after their first moult - when the young hens regrow the orange cap and
the young cocks retain a plain silver head and neck.
Breeding from hand-reared birds
As a breeder over many years of a whole range of birds, including lories,
I believe a statement by Rosemary Low in her most interesting article on
the breeding of the Tahiti Blue Lory (Vol. 91, Nos. 1 &amp; 2) that 'there
are still people who believe the myth that hand-reared birds are useless for
breeding purposes' needs to be analysed.
In my experience this would all depend upon the reasons for the
parents refusing to care for, or feed their young.
It is no myth and any serious breeder of domestic stock, whether it
be pigeons, bantams, budgerigars, canaries, cockatiels, etc., will confirm
that the young reared by indifferent parents or even if they are taken away
and reared by foster-parents, will, when mature, will make indifferent
parents themselves, thus confirming that such traits can be inherited.
Unfortunately these traits are continually passed on from one generation
to another because the parents may possess qualities essential for the show
ring. Poor parental characteristics include light-sitting hens, poor brooding
hens, erratic feeding of young and after flight care. This, however, would
not apply to the wild stock where their very survival depends upon good
rearing qualities and any imperfections would have been eliminated.
Birds in the wild select their own mates, but under captive conditions

incompatible pairs are often thrown together, inducing a weak pair-bond.
Incompatibility is not an inherited trait, and young hand-reared from such
a pair would have all the normal characteristics expected of them. The in-
compatible pair can be broken up and offered other mates and subse-
quently become perfect parents.
Again, many wild birds, after hatching their young, change their diet
completely and unless this stimulant to feed was provided under captive
conditions, you would get poor parental and feeding reactions. This is also
not an inherited trait, for with a change of diet, or presentation of the
food, this could be altered, and therefore young hand-reared from such a
pairing could be expected to have normal parental qualities.
The preference of some hand-reared birds for human company rather
than their own kind does sometimes pose further problems but this bond
can be eradicated or weakened by placing weaned young together, or with
their own kind, at an early age.
If the human contact continues through to maturity, then many more !

Hardiness of a Twenty-eight Parakeet

In the first week of November 1985 my cock Twenty-eight Parrakeet j
Bamadius zonarius semitorquatus ate his way out of his aviary and I did I
not see him again until 19th February when I heard him calling in a tree
above a hen Port Lincoln Parrakeet B.z. zonarius. He disappeared for the
rest of the day and then reappeared in the evening of the next day. He was
around the aviaries all the afternoon of 21st February and on the morning
of 22nd February he went through the opening which I had made at the
top of the aviary next to the Port Lincoln hen and he went straight away
and fed her through the wire.
This bird was at liberty for approximately three months, latterly during
one of the coldest periods for many years, the temperature remaining
below freezing point for over two weeks.
As a postscript to this story, a fellow builder who lives a mile away
from me recently told me that he had been feeding a green and yellow
parrakeet on his bird table from November onwards but that it had now
disappeared. I had to tell him that it was my bird and I had caught it up.

A very large Indian collection
I recently heard from a friend in India, Dr. Mohan Patel, a member of
;his Society, who sent a cutting from a newspaper, Gujarat Samachar,
lated 27th December 1985, recalling that the Indian Congress (now Indira
Congress), recently celebrating its centenary in Bombay, was founded by a
British citizen, Sir Allan Hume. The newspaper related that Sir Allan
Tume was a lover of birds and in the extensive garden of his house in
Simla he collected some 62,000 birds from different countries. I won-
dered whether any of our readers knows more about what must rate as one
of the largest avicultural collections ever?
i?arklands, Shoulton, K. Dolton
[Tallow, nr Worcester.
/
Bd. History books reveal that Allan Octavian Hume (1829-1912) worked in the
Indian Civil Service for some 30 years and on his retirement took up the cause of
Indian nationalism and founded the Congress which became and remained the chief
political party of the Hindus. They elected him their first Secretary, a post he held
intil shortly before his death. He was an ornithologist with an international repu-
tation; he organised bird observation all over the country and wrote the first book
Dn Indian birds. I can find no mention of this enormous collection of birds at Simla.
 |fan anyone tell us more? And was this the Hume for whom the Bar-tailed Pheasant
was named?

The Little Black, or White-quilled, Bustard, also known as the Black
# torhaan, is found in open grassland and amongst scattered trees and
)ushes, thoughout the central, southern and western regions of Southern
Africa. Our pair of Little Black Bustards were acquired in February 1979
rom a dealer and were adult on arrival. During the following three years,
ipent in the 'Square' aviaries, they failed to nest and at the end of 1983
t was decided to rehouse the birds in a planted aviary, approximately
I3mx4mx3m high, at the Tropical House.
On 13th April, 1984, one egg was laid in a shallow scrape, no nesting
naterial had been used. This egg was removed to be artificially incubated
)ut was soon found to be addled.
A second single egg was laid on the same scrape on 8th May and left

or the female to incubate. The chick hatched on 28th May, but again,
iince there was a real risk that it might drown in a small pool in the
iviary, the chick was taken for hand-rearing. Initially it was fed on crickets,
imall locusts, white mealworms, chopped lettuce, egg and grit; water was
pvcn in drops from a hypodermic syringe. Calcium/magnesium was given
daily to prevent bone deficiencies. All food items had to be offered by
neans of tweezers as the chick made no effort to feed itself.
On the third day the chick became lethargic and failed to defaecate, a
Droblem not uncommon in hand-reared bustards. One ml. of liquid paraf-
fin was administered and a day-old Lady Amherst's Pheasant Chtysolophus
imherstiae was caged with the chick in order to improve its feeding and
 |;xercise. The Bustard improved over the ensuing 24 hours and soon began
:o feed from the dish. The pheasant chick was removed after a few days.
At six days the wing quills were growing fast and by the fifteenth day
;he chick was quite well covered. It was able to spend some time outside
on warm days. Small pieces of cooked, minced chicken and liver heart, and
umps of mice were now added to the diet.

On the 19th day the chick began refusing food from the dish andj
would only take an occasional cricket from the tweezers. This continued
for six days, after which it was completely independent of the tweezers!
and feeding well once again from the dish. The young bird became unex-l
pectedly nervous and on day 59 was moved to a planted aviary at the
Tropical House. At six months old it still bore immature plumage though
it was 'barking' like a male.
A third egg was laid on 13th June in a scrape barely a metre from the
original. This egg hatched on 2nd July, the chick was again removed for
hand-rearing but died at 16 days. A post mortem examination revealed
an acute enteritis.
A fourth egg was laid in the same scrape on 23rd July and hatched on
13th August. It was decided on this occasion to allow the adults an oppor-i
tunity to rear their own young. The chick was brooded and fed by the
female and appeared to be doing well until 12th September when it was|
found dead in its roosting place. The cause of death was inconclusive.
In each case the incubation period was 21 days. The first egg weighed!
43 g and measured 41 x 52 mm. All three chicks began developing al
slipped wing at about six days but this corrected itself after approximately&amp;apos;
14 days.
Subsequently, clutches have been hand-reared and parent-reared during!
1985.
The down of the chicks is grey speckled with brown and black. The
bill and feet are grey. The juvenile plumage in most respects is similar tc
that of the adult hen. It would appear that immature cocks begin to colour
black on the neck at around seven months when they also develop the
characteristic bark of the adult male. Interestingly, the first bird to be
hatched in May 1984, though now in full male plumage, still retains the
eye coloration of the hen. The last chick to be hatched, now five months
old (January 1986) is showing pale dorsal streaks and we believe it to be
a hen, with which it agrees in all other respects. This being so, it is the first
of its sex thus far reared.
Two cock birds are now housed in an adjacent enclosure which is
especially spacious and heated and planted. Though they do not actually
come to blows, each remains constantly away from the other. The young-
est bird is still with the adult pair while the remaining hand-reared off-
spring is caged elsewhere in the collection.
Other than the inclusion of many more insects (collected by means of a
sweep net) and mealworms, crickets and small locusts, the diet remained
unchanged during the breeding season. In order to 'protect' her young, the
hen often feigns injury and on occasions even attacks! At such times, the
cock runs off barking loudly and incessantly. The hen alone broods her

The Pale-headed Mannikin, or Pale-headed Munia, or Pale-headed Nun,
is, according to Goodwin (1982) &gt; found in south-west and central Sulawesi
(Celebes) and neighbouring islands of Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Alor,
Savu, Kisar, Sermattu, Babar, Kalaota and Madu.
In shape and size it is similar to the commoner White-headed Mannikin
Lonchura maja except that the head is more of an off-white colour, and
the breast is a pale pinkish grey. The rest of the body is chocolate brown
to reddish chestnut, and the latter colour, especially over the flanks, glows
in bright sunlight and makes this a most attractive finch.
Four birds were purchased from a dealer in September 1983 and were
wintered together in an indoor room without heat, though the tempera j
ture did not fall below freezing.
In the spring of 1984 they were all placed in an open sheltered aviary
8 ft long x 6 ft high x 3 ft wide (2.43 x 1.82 x 0.91 m), the floor being of
slate slabs, a bucketful of farmyard manure and a bucketful of leaf mould
was placed in the front of the aviary, and kept moist. This is a practice
carried out for all the smaller finches that are likely to breed. White
worms were provided at first but were discontinued as they were no
taken. In fact, livefood is unnecessary as subsequent chicks were rearec
without.
A variety of nesting sites were provided inside the shelter and outside
these included lovebird boxes and open finch boxes but the nest first usee
was a hollow tube of wire netting filled with hay and a nest cavity madt
inside. This was in the shelter.
Five eggs were laid in June and it was my intention to foster then
under some Bengalese but the latter chicks hatched before the transfe
could be made, so the Mannikins were allowed to continue their duties
Three chicks hatched and subsequently left the nest but unfortunately
one was picked up dead after a downpour a week later.
The pair went to nest again in an open-fronted finch nest-box unde
shelter and reared a further two to independence.
All eight birds were brought in to a birdroom in September 1984 ant
heat was provided from November onwards until the following spring
Unfortunately two of the young died during the winter before coming ii
to adult colour, which the other two did before being replaced in th

jutdoor aviary.
The juvenile Pale-headed Mannikin has a brownish buff head and
preast; the wings and tail are light chocolate, and the beak is similar to
idults but perhaps a little more grey, and the legs are dark brown.
The remaining six birds shared the same- aviary and although the
idult birds had been rung with split rings the previous autumn, these
lad disappeared during the winter. Nesting started late but subsequently
;wo chicks left the nest in late September. Unfortunately these were
bund dead on my return from being away for a few days.
The six birds were brought indoors at the end of September 1985 and
&amp;apos; tried to split them into pairs by appearance. Each pair was similarly
loused in cages 3 ft long x IVi ft wide x 2 ft high (0.91 x 0.45 x 0.60 m);
ppen-ended finch nest-boxes were provided which faced the length of the
;ages, and were filled with hay which was hollowed out to make a nest
chamber. More hay and coconut fibre were provided as well as heat from
November onwards.
One pair threw out all the nesting material, the other just sat in the
;pox, but the third pair laid five eggs, three of which hatched on 2nd
January. The chicks left the nest on 19th January and were feeding inde-
pendently by 5th February.
The diet consists of a mixture of 50% white millet and 50% canary
;eed, to which I add Japanese and red millet, plus a little niger and maw
;eed. In addition, the above mixture is provided soaked, plus some soaked
oaddy rice and Ce De. Millet sprays, both dry and soaked, were offered
)ut were not popular. During the summer, meadow grasses were provided
md ornamental grasses such zs Mi sc an thus sinensis.
Cuttle fish 'bone' and grit were always provided and when the birds
were indoors, a few drops of Abedec were occasionally added to the
drinking water.
At the time of writing (6th March 1986) the. same pair have now laid
mother clutch. The other 'pairs' are still not doing anything.

By L. GIBSON
(Burnaby, British Columbia)
The general habits, etc., of this species have been described earlier
(Avicultural Magazine, 1981, p. 34). The birds nested in the conservatory
as described for Cyanerpes (Avicultural Magazine, 1979, p. 6). As men-
tioned previously they can be sexed by the blue on the throat; the female
has two stripes, joined only at the top, while the male has a solid patch
of blue.
Courtship was rather hectic and consisted of chasing then sitting
screeching at each other. The cock seemed to like hanging upside down
below the hen, on the same twig. The breeding pair picked one another
from a group of five and, apart from mild quarrelling on occasions, they
were still quite friendly almost a year later. This shows the importance of
natural selection. It was fortunate that they had a few to pick from for
most of the time we stick two birds together and that is that, and I have
consistently had trouble doing this with Shamas, for example.
The aviary was shared with a pair of Silver-beaked Tanagers Rampho-
celus carbo which nested first. They were taken out later when the
Chloropsis nested. General breeding procedure was identical to C. hard-
wickei and only additional information is given here.

Four nests were built and all were constructed of grass and horse, or
cow, hair only. A wide range of materials was made available. Three were
reconstructed hardwickei nests, and one was a new nest. The latter was
used twice, and was the only successful nest. Eggs were laid in only one of
the other nests. The dimensions were identical to the hardwickei nests.
The first nest was a reconstruction of the old hardwickei nest, in bam-
boo. It was started on 6th April, 1980. The horse hair lining was taken
out and replaced. The sides were partly dismantled and reconstructed,
giving them a slightly more open weave than the original and the lining
was also sparse. The nest was completed but not used. On 1st May, the hen
began to reconstruct the second hardwickei nest in the creeping fig, against
the wall. This time it had a thicker lining. It took only two days to refur-
bish, and the first egg was laid on the third day. The cock was seen to
carry a piece of grass at this time but he did not do any work and was not
seen to do this again. The third nest was yet another reconstruction of the

first. Each time the lining was taken out completely and replaced. This
was still not used and a fourth was started. This nest was completely new
and situated in the creeping fig, but at the same height at the opposite end
of the wall from the other. It could not be seen except from a step ladder
which was immediately installed.
All the nests were firmly fixed and lined only with black or red hair,
white hair being ignored. When the new nest was finished, the pad of
horse hair lining the base was found standing on end. It had probably been
pulled up by the birds' claws when leaving. This was stitched back in using
black thread and at the same time, some loops were sewn around the rim.
This turned out to be a good idea, for by the time a chick left the nest, it
was still as good as new. There was previously some trouble with nest rims

unravelling a lot. As a further precaution, a twig was wired in place just in
front of the nest. Previously there had been nothing to land on except the
nest rim. , ,

Eggs and incubation

Prior to laying, the hen began to consume increased quantities of food.
This consisted of insects mostly and when these were put in, the cock
immediately called the hen down to them (and still does). In contrast to
the hardwickei, he fed her regularly. However, no food was taken to her
while she was on the nest.
The clutch consists of two eggs. Three clutches were laid: the first
was started on 3rd May and the last on 16th August. The eggs were slightly
smaller than those of the hardwickei , being 20 x 16 mm. All had a pale
reddish brown wash except for one which was white. They had large
reddish-brown spots sparsely concentrated at the big end, with a very few
smaller spots petering out around the middle. Some eggs had pretty mauve
spots interspersed among the brown ones.
As with hardwickei there was some delayed hatching. The first egg was
chipped open by me when it was 15 days old, possibly 16, depending on
whether it was the first or second laid. A live chick, more or less ready for
hatching, tumbled out and the parents fed it within five hours. The other
egg in the clutch was fertile but had died at about the 5th-6th day period.
Both chicks in the second nest had hatched by 10.00 a.m. on the same
day, after 14 and 15 days' incubation. When the hen was incubating, the
cock sat at the opposite end of the aviary and, in contrast to the silent
vigil of the cock hardwickei , he occasionally sang quietly. When the hen
left the nest he flew close by her but never went near the nest while there
were still eggs in it. Temperatures ranged from a low of 52*F (11*C) at
night, to a daytime high of 80*F (27*C) for the clutches which hatched.

Chicks
These were just the same as the hardwickei, being rather small and very
slow to develop for the first three or four days. Both parents fed actively
from the first day. Only insects were used at first, being mostly wasp
pupae and larvae, spiders, grasshoppers and termites. The latter were con-
veniently obtained by sawing up lengths of my sundeck - about two years
before, a toucan upset a jar of these insects in the sundeck and apparently
some escaped and settled underneath it!
On the seventh day the hen fed some rice to a chick, but it could have
been getting it earlier. The chicks opened their eyes at six days, one
opening and closing its eyes on the fifth day. This was the main difference
from the hardwickei chicks which were much later. The Golden-fronted
Chloropsis chicks were difficult to induce to beg but nevertheless were
easier than the hardwickei. They sometimes sprang up at the first tap.
All were fed from the second day onwards with egg/butter/milk.
The sole chick to hatch in the clutch grew well and was very fat by the
13th day, in fact it weight 27 g, which was too much. In spite of growing
well, its primaries had not come out until the 10th day in comparison
with the seventh day for the other chicks. The feathers were all well
formed in spite of this. The chick was very quiet and did not object at all
to being lifted out. Its parents hopped about angrily nearby, uttering
explosive whistles whenever the chick was handled.
At 16 days the chick flopped from the nest and was obviously not
normal. It could only flap its wings a little and sat holding its feet up,
resting on the first joint. It seemed incapable of stretching its neck out
fully and squeaked, possibly in pain, when this was done by hand. It
was placed on a concrete block and the parents continued to feed it. It I
jumped off the block several times but could not move from where it
landed. It had very little grip in its feet and two swellings were apparent
on its legs. These grew progressively larger by the day. The legs began to
bend at the swellings, which became inflamed. The parents tried des-
perately to get it to fly. They were carrying nesting material by this time.
The chick was taken indoors at 18 days, started on antibiotics, and hand-
fed.
The next day it was seen eating and drinking without trouble, but had
difficulty moving to and from the food. It was given aspirin and this made
it much brighter. It had been squeaking in pain quite often whenever it
moved. Swelling was also noted in a wing joint. The chick died the follow-
ing day in great distress. A post-mortem examination showed that both
legs seemed to have been broken and there was much recalcification going
on. It also had problems with its neck and wings. It had been hand-fed
with what should have been plenty of calcium and vitamin D. It did not

have the appearance of an 'ordinary' rachitic chick (which is much more
mobile) and was otherwise plump and well-developed. It was more likely
that this chick had a malabsorption syndrome for calcium or vitamin D,
and nothing would have saved it. Rickets can usually be corrected fairly
well by simply supplying vitamin D, but this chick got rapidly and pro-
gressively worse.
The second clutch to hatch was laid on the 15th and 16th August and
both chicks appeared on the 31st. Everything went smoothly until one
chick died suddenly at almost 10 days old, with no previous signs of dis-
tress. The cause of death was easily established. Its little stomach was more
than three-quarters filled with six pieces of pumice stone. Pumice is, of
( ;ourse, very light and the largest piece weighed 115.5 mg, but it measured
7 x 5.5 x 3 mm. Total weight of the six pieces was 205 mg. A flower pot
with potting soil containing pumice fragments had been put in some time
during this nesting and was removed two days before the chick died. It is
not known whether the stones were fed as grit or, more probably, as
minerals. The first chick had no grit at all in the stomach. It would be a
good thing to feed grit and/or eggshell to all birds to avoid this, as I have
had at least one previous chick killed by getting relatively large stones fed
to it.
The other chick probably got fed pumice fragments also, but it was the
larger of the two and as each day went by, it became safer. It developed
uneventfully, leaving the nest at 13 days and thereafter followed the
Hardwick's chick in development. As previously postulated, it was indeed
green all over; the only difference from the hardwickei chick being the top
of its head. It had a lighter green patch where its orange crown would be.
It gradually moulted into adult plumage at three to four months old, and
proved to be a male.
The parents started to moult when the chick was about three weeks
old and they were very quiet and friendly. They.remain so to this day. An
interesting thing happened with their feeding habits. They did not go over
to insects quite as much as the Harwick's, although they obviously pre-
ferred them. They were also much less fussy, eating even mealworm
beetles, although they did pick out only the softest larvae and pupae for
the chicks. They did not take any nectar during the nesting period,
scarcely bothered with it thereafter and have hardly taken it since. It is
offered every month or so, just to check, but is usually ignored. They have
settled to a staple diet of rice pudding and orange, with a little banana and
as many mealworms as can be spared.

BOW LEG SYNDROME IN RATITE BIRDS
By Dr. P. GUITTIN

Summary

<bodyText confidence="0.986564947368421" page_id="58077798"  page_num="Page 70" year="" vol="">
From 1981 to 1985, various changes were made in the hand-rearing of I
Ostrich, rhea and Emu chicks at the Paris Zoological Park to determine i
environmental and nutritional factors involved in the excessive growth and i
low survival of chicks with bow legs.
Introduction
Leg deformities occur in ratites in many zoological parks (Guittin,
1985). Variously known as perosis, leg disorders, musculo-skeletal disease, I
slipped tendon, and spread leg (Wallach, 1970; Walser et al, 1982; Reece &amp; j
Butler, 1984), bow leg syndrome may best describe the leg deformities
commonly found in several ratite birds. Leg bone deformities have been i
reported in the Ostrich Struthio camelus, the Greater Rhea Rhea ameri-
cana, Darwin's Rhea Pterocnemia pennata, the Emu Dromaius novaehol- |
landiae, and cassowaries Casuarius spp. (Bruning, 1973; Cordonnier, 1977;
Reece &amp; Butler, 1984). At Paris Zoological Park, the usual history of birds j
with bow leg syndrome is that the eggs were artificially incubated and the
newly hatched chicks were overfed, grew rapidly for the first month and
developed leg deformities by two to eight weeks old. The purpose of the
present study was to show nutritional and behavioural causes of the dis-
ease.

At the Paris Zoological Park, eggs of three species of ratite birds (Stru-
thio camelus, Rhea americana, Dromaius novaehollandiae) were artificially
incubated (36.7*C and a relative humidity of 65%) and were automatically
turned every two hours. Seventy-eight Ostrich, 87 Rhea and 51 Emu
chicks had been hand-reared after hatching: 12 Ostriches, 20 Rheas and
five Emus were weighed and measured every day for the first two months
after hatching, then every week thereafter. Chicks of less than 5 kg were
weighed in a high box, using baby scales (1% standard error). Heavier
chicks were double-weighed, using converted bathroom scales (4% stan-
dard error). The height of each chick was determined by use of a measur-
ing apparatus (5% standard error), without disturbing the chicks. Four
heights were evaluated: the head height, measured at the top of the
cranium; the back height, at the first dorsal vertebra; the hip height, at

During the first two months, the low survival might be attributed to the
lack of appropriate husbandry techniques. Also, the lack of attention
normally provided by the male adult in natural rearing, made the chicks
more inactive. If chicks have no encouragement to develop their muscles,
they do not use their leg joints sufficiently. This in turn can lead to gener-
alised weakness and deformities becoming apparent.
To encourage activity, several techniques were devised. It was impor-
tant not to keep a chick alone as the presence of other chicks, and indeed
adult birds, encouraged ratite chicks to move about. The floor surface also
influenced the chicks' behaviour. Early on we found that an edible surface,
such as litter or grass was not suitable because young chicks would eat it
and suffer impactions. On the other hand, a ground that was too hard
became painful for the chicks to walk on, leading to inactivity. We decided
that a floor of jute or straw was a good compromise for younger chicks as
these materials were not eaten by chicks, and provided adequate traction
with satisfactory firmness.For two-month old birds, a short area of grass
gave the optimal results. It was also necessary to consider the size of the
enclosure to encourage movement. About 2 in 2 for young chicks up
to two months old was satisfactory. Then we gave midges and flies which
kept chicks busy looking for and catching these insects and other inver-
tebrates.
Yet exercise is not considered the only factor responsible for streng-
thening legs. We found that restrictions on food intake prevented bow legs
and that a nutritionally adequate diet improved the survival rate. Also
when we had quantitatively reduced daily food intake, the bone pathology
had largely decreased (Table 1). We had understood that this syndrome
was correlated with overfeeding. Studies of diet had shown a reduction in
food intake corresponded to a specific reduction in metabolizable energy
requirement. Energy nutrients such as cereals or pellets for carnivores or
poultry induced risk; also it might be important to raise the calcium
level of the diet since chicks developed a calcium deficiency. During the
first two months, ratite chicks had a rationed diet (Table 1). Then from
two to 12 months old, ratite birds had a diet which was given ad lib. but
was qualitatively restricted (Table 2).

We made a retrospective investigation with rhea chicks. The chicks
were divided into three groups: group 1 was composed of five chicks
that developed bow legs between 23 and 31 days old; group 2 was com-
posed of five chicks that developed bow legs between eight and 11 days
old; group 3 was composed ol 10 control chicks that showed a normal
growth.
During the first week, group 2 had been heavier than the controls
(gtoup 3) from the fourth day (Fig. 1). But a significant difference
(p&amp;lt;0.05) only became apparent at the ninth day, with the first onset of
symptoms. During the first month comparison between groups 1 and 2
showed a significant difference (p-^0.02) at 17 days old, before lame-
ness was seen (Fig. 2). So it was possible to identify a presymptomatic
period of this disease, from three to six days before the first clinical
symptoms appeared.

Dr. P. GUITTIN - BOW LEG SYNDROME IN RATITE BIRDS
By daily analysis of the chicks' weights, we were able to note a pattern
of growth preceding bowing of the tarsometatarsus. Measurements showed
that a rapid weight increase preceded a spurt of tarsometatarsal growth
just before the lameness appeared. These chicks might be growing so
rapidly that they were unable to metabolise enough calcium and their legs
started bowing (Guittin, 1983). The weight of the chicks which were kept
with the male did not increase so rapidly since they were too busy chasing
flies to eat the food prepared for them (Bruning, 1973). Their growth was
correspondingly slower and they did not develop leg bowing. These results
suggested a way to prevent this syndrome by reducing the food intake to
slow down early growth.
Growth Findings
Signs of lameness were more frequently seen in rheas than Ostriches or
Emus. The earliest leg deformities were apparent in eight-day old rheas.
The second week after hatching was the first of the two critical periods. At
this stage leg growth was rapid, and abnormal lateral twisting and inflam-
mation of the tiobiometatarsal joint could be detected. Initially, twisting
would develop, without lateral rotation of the tarsometatarsus. Three days
after onset of lameness, rheas with a tibiometatarsal twisting up to a 70*
angle. Ostriches and rheas could also develop a bowing of the tarso-
metatarsus. Eventually chicks developed lateral rotation of the distal
third of the tibia, which progressed until the gastrocnemius tendon luxated
off the medial condyle and the chick was unable to stand or walk normally
as a result.
Generally, Ostriches and Emus began to show clinical signs of bowing
at four weeks old; rheas developed the bow leg syndrome during the
second critical period, between six and 12 weeks old. Younger ratite birds
showed the most severe bowing deformities. Several one- to two-month
old ratite chicks began to develop bowing of the tarsometatarsus, a
bulbous and inflammatory enlargement of the proximal tarsometatarsus,
and persistent lameness. Inflammation of the tibiometatarsal joint was
constant with bow leg syndrome. In rheas, during the second critical
period, development of bow leg was always associated with deformities of
the leg bone. Tibiotarsal and tarsometatarsal deformities were seen most
commonly in the heaviest ratite birds.
The tarsometatarsus was often twisted with an inflammatory proximal
third and the tibiometatarsal joint was highly congested. The distal tibio-
metatarsal and proximal tarsometatarsal bones were poorly vascularised.
The periphery of apex of these bones was severely eroded. Deformities of
the tibiotarsus were frequently associated with tarsometatarsal dyschon-
droplasia.

Two-week old and eight-week old ratite birds, especially rheas, some-
times had tibiometatarsal joint inflammation. Macroscopic examinations
systematically indicated congestion of the tibiometatarsal joint, inflamma-
tion of the proximal tarsometatarsal bone, and abrasion of the distal
tibiotarsal and proximal tarsometatarsal articular surfaces.
Clinical studies. Details of these findings, too long to include in this

If no corrective or preventive measures were taken, the bowing became
so bad that the ratite chicks were unable to stand up, but it was very diffi-
cult to stop the bowing if symptoms were too severe. The only treatment
was to give concomitantly easily assimilable calcium and injections of
multi-vitamins, including from 20 to 40 micrograms of vitamin D3 a
week. But for these corrective measures to be successful it was necessary
to begin very early, 24 hours after the first symptoms appeared and to
continue for two months.
Bone and plastic surgery, to reduce overstretched ligament of the tibio-
metatarsal joint did not satisfactorily improve stability of legs and so we
always saw a recurrence of the disease. Sometimes fixing an elastic band
around and between the legs was successful in keeping joints in position if
this treatment was applied just after the first symptoms appeared during
the first critical period.
Prevention
In the first instance, manipulation of the diet in two ways is considered
essential: the energy content of the food should be decreased by limiting
cereals and pellets to the absolute minimum and offering alfalfa, carrots
and apples; secondly, mineral and vitamin supplements including especially
calcium and Vitamin D3 should be increased. But chicks were very selec-
tive eaters, and they could leave the supplement but eat relatively greater
quantities of pellets. These birds grew rapidly and developed bowing.
However, to give the chicks repeated injections was not very good for
them because they had to be caught and showed signs of stress. Oui ex-
periments showed that supplementation in the form of pulverised eggshell
which would adhere closely to fresh food would be eaten. Chicks should
be kept on a calcium supplement until they are approximately six months
old. If this was discontinued too early, bow-leg syndrome could still occur
with enlargement of the joint.
It was also necessary to reduce the food intake in order to slow down
early growth and to improve environmental factors. Five zootechnic

measures might follow on the nutritional prophylaxis:
1. At the Paris Zoological Park we gave several meals a day, i.e. one-
month old chicks had six daily meals and six-month old chicks had
four.
2. The influence of exercise was very important. Chicks should be en-
couraged to move and walk to develop their leg joints and bones. A
chick which did not move, was unstable and fell down often had a
higher risk of developing bow legs. A large area was necessary to allow
chicks to be always on the move.
3. We have found that a floor covering of jute or straw decreases the risks
of slipping and bow legs.
4. During the first weeks, provision of livefood kept the chicks busy and
helped to prevent a rapid weight gain.
5. A ratite chick should not be left alone because it will tend to be less
active and its legs become fragile. Ratite chicks kept in groups num-

bering between 10 and 12 young birds of the same species all together
was preferable, taking care not to have too great a difference of age
between them. Three weeks between the youngest and the oldest in
the same group constituted the maximum safe range.
To limit development of bowing during the first critical period, we
provided support for the legs from hatching onwards. We put an elastic
bandage with a compress between the two legs in the midst of tibiae
and, sometimes, tarsometatarsae. Chicks could rest and move without
running excessively. One week afterwards, the rubber bandage was taken
off. This slack restraining apparatus led to a decrease in the incidence
of bow legs syndrome on all three studied species of ratite birds.

Our experience has shown that the bow legs syndrome is often an
indication of malnutrition. Due to the chicks' inactivity in certain con-
ditions, environmental hazards and inadequate food intake, optimum
survival rates are not obtained. With the male-reared chicks, the bow
legs syndrome is unknown (Bruning, 1973; Bruning, 1974). Wild birds
have to hunt for a varied diet and greater activity results in natural
growth without rapid weight increases.
The results indicate that the bow legs syndrome is due essentially to
an imbalance in calcium metabolism. Deficiencies of manganese and zinc
with heavy supplementation of calcium, probably do not cause this syn-
drome, but may interfere with the absorption of calcium (Wallach, 1970).
The aetiology may be the association between a deficiency of calcium and

a too rapid weight gain. So, an excessive high energy ration can be a con-
tributory factor to the bow legs syndrome (Ullrey, 1982). Therefore, food
intake, especially of cereals and pellets, should be reduced to slow down
early growth.
Nutrition is not the only cause, however, as bone problems can develop
during the first week after hatching when chicks begin eating. Stability of
legs is an important point. Legs of chicks that do not move early become
fragile and generally become bowed. Activity and movement that streng-
then the bones, are also preventative measures.

INVERTED RESTING IN PIONUS PARROTS

By WERNER LANTERMANN &amp; SUSANNE WOZNIAK
(Aus dem Privatinstitut fur Papageienforschung, Oberhausen, Germany)
With the exception of Asian Hanging Parrots Loriculus sp., which
usually rest and sleep upside down (Buckley, 1968), this habit is hardly
known in other members of the Psittaciformes. However, inverted resting
is more common within this group than suggested in literature.
The neotropical Barred Parrakeet Bolborhynchus lineola was first
recorded as sleeping upside down by Prestwich (1954). Dilger (1960)
observed Agapornis pullaria resting and sleeping upside down and some-
times saw Agapornis taranta resting this way during the day. The South
American Green-rumped Parrotlet Forpus passerinus has been observed
resting and preening in the same way (Buckley and Buckley, 1968).
During our studies on the neotropical parrot genus Pionus, some
preliminary results of which have been presented in a previous article
(Lantermann, 1983), we observed two further species of parrots resting
upside down.
Two young Blue-headed Parrots Pionus menstruus, which were bred in
our Institute in the summer of 1982, were first seen resting in that posi-
tion at the age of four months. The parrots chose a perch of about 25 mm
in diameter, turned their bodies upside down and hung by both feet after
shuffling their feet around to find the most suitable foothold. They have
never been observed with one foot tucked under the body feathers and
the head turned over the shoulder. Seven months after hatching, these
birds stopped hanging upside down and two other young parrots from the
same 1982 brood never showed this behaviour pattern.
The Scaly-headed Parrots Pionus maximiliani , two of which we keep in our
aviaries, sporadically rested in the same way when they were obviously
very young birds. This habit stopped after the birds had lived in our
Institute for six months but unfortunately we did not know
the exact age of the parrots at the time we bought them from a dealer.
According to Dilger's definition (loc. cit.), the behaviour pattern of
resting and sleeping includes slightly fluffed body feathers and closed or
partly closed eyes, sometimes with the head turned over the shoulder.
None of our birds ever showed these characteristics, but the frequency
of this way of hanging upside down, which was usually performed several
times a day for sometimes more than 30 minutes, makes us believe that
this was not play behaviour but a form of resting.
The origin of this habit is not exactly known. Dilger suggests that it

must have evolved in a common ancestor of the paleaotropical Loriculus
and Agapornis parrots 'in response to nocturnal predators from which
safety was achieved by sleeping amid leaves at the slender ends of twigs'
(p. 660).
We assume that this element is a behavioural rudiment without any
function for a 'modern' parrot group like the highly developed Pionus
parrots. Behavioural rudiments are occasionally found in young birds,
which perform 'extinct' behaviour patterns and in certain circumstances
allow one to draw conclusions on the behaviour and ecological adaptations
of their ancestors (Immelmann, 1983).
It is conceivable that the ancestors of Old World parrots (i.e. Loriculus
and Agapornis ) and New World parrots (i.e. Bolborhynchus, Forpus and
Pionus ) independently of each other evolved the same methods of pro-
tecting against nocturnal predators. But the relatively heavy weight of
Pionus parrots (+/- 220 g) is noteworthy and seems to be unsuitable for
that way of protecting against predators, suggested by Dilger for the
much smaller Loriculus (+/- 30 g) and Agapornis (+/- 45 g) parrots. It
might be supposed that former relations of Pionus parrots were of smaller
size than recent forms of that group.
For adult Pionus menstruus and P. maximiliani inverted resting is
not recorded in freedom or captivity. We have never seen this behaviour
pattern in any other Pionus species, some of which we keep in our aviaries.

My partner, Albert Holmes, and I bought two pairs of these birds in
1982 and although we had a relatively poor start in breeding them, this
has now been resolved. We are at present working with eight breeding
pairs, plus two or three odd cock birds. We have built up our stock from
Dutch, German and English strains, using birds as unrelated as possible.
Unlike some people, we do not keep compatible pairs together producing
great quantities of similar genetic material. We allow pairs to rear one to
three rounds, swap them round, rest them lor a period and start again. We
feel this is essential in order to produce as much unrelated stock for the
future of aviculture in this country.
Anyone with any knowledge of these birds will agree that they are a
little unpredictable, to say the least. Compatibility is really the key to
success, as a compatible pair will produce many young with little or no
trouble. However, this is surely not the aim of a genuine aviculturist
whose task should be to ensure a strong nucleus of unrelated birds for
the future. Therefore, in the long term, one chick reared by a pair which
is not completely compatible must be of more use genetically than a
dozen produced from a compatible pair. As I say, some birds are no
trouble, others will rear one round and lose the next. Some birds will
learn by their mistakes and get the chicks a few days older each time
until they finally succeed. Some birds will not have your chosen partner
at any price! Sometimes, if the cock is removed, the hen will rear the
chicks on her own. So you can see that Cuban Finches are unpredictable
but nevertheless very interesting.
They can also be quite pugnacious - two breeders with whom I am
working have had cocks kill hens.l had a hen kill two cocks, accept my
third offering and rear two rounds of four and three young respectively.
Cuban Finches can be bred in flights or cages. In my experience,
cages measuring 15 x 15 x 36 in long (0.38 x 0.38 x 0.91 m) are best
but this is a personal observation. Chicks can leave the nest at 12/14
days and at this size/age they would probably perish outside in bad
weather. I find that flask-type baskets are preferred, and if these are
hung at a slight incline, it does help to keep chicks inside a few days
longer. The neat nests are lined with feathers stripped from the hen
(usually). My birds use hay and coconut fibre for nesting material.

The chicks moult into adult plumage and mature very fast. In fact,
it is not unusual to breed from them at three to four months old and
I see no reason to discourage them if they are fit and want to reproduce.
There is no evidence to suggest that inferior young are produced and, in
fact, another breeder has stated that, in his experience, to stop them from
breeding at an early age is detrimental and actually gives poorer results.
When the hens are in breeding condition, they have a most peculiar
'musky' odour which will almost 'knock you over' if they are held in
the hand. I remove young from their parents at approximately three
weeks old. Very occasionally adult cocks will kill young cocks if they
are left with their parents until they start to 'colour up'. Young birds
sometimes leave the nest plucked, but their feathers soon grow back.
One or other of the parents is usually plucked to a varying degree for
lining the nest, but the feathers are allowed to grow back once nesting has
stopped.
With regard to feeding and general husbandry, all my seedeaters
receive similar treatment. The birdroom, which is made of wood, is well
insulated and has a large amount of double glazing used in its construc-
tion. It is thermostatically controlled at 60*F minimum. Newspaper is
used as a floor covering (I once had a friend remark, 'No wonder he breeds
so many with all those pinups to look at!'). Canary seed, pannicum and
mixed millet are fed in separate pots to reduce wastage. Spray millet is
always available as are various greenstuffs and seeding weeds in season.
Once a week a half handful of the following mixture is thrown on the
floor: British wild seed, Haith's Tonic Grains (or a mixture of maw,
gold of pleasure, niger, lettuce and rape), yeast, Haith's Mineralised Grit,
limestone grit, oystershell grit, grated iodine block, Haith's Pink Minerals,
charcoal, Kirkpatrick's Pigeon Minerals, kelp powder and sand. Water is
always available, the same container being used for drinking and bathing,
(I do not use clip-on water fountains). A small dish of softbill food is
provided and changed weekly.
At 7.0 a.m. each pair gets a half teaspoon of dry eggfood. I use an
equal mix of 'Ce-De' and 'Ce-De Mix'. Heaped on this dry food I provide
approximately one teaspoon of soaked, sprouted seed. I find a salad
sprouter is more efficient for sprouting than other methods, and I take
equal parts of paddy rice, oats, groats, hemp, and mung beans and mix
one cup of this dry seed mixture with one cup of plain canary and one
cup of mixed millet. This mixture is soaked and sprouted for approxi-
mately three days.
When birds have chicks in the nest, naturally I increase the amount of
soaked seed given each morning. I also give them some more soaked seed
in the evening, but no more eggfood. Some birds will eat a little wholemeal

bread and milk with soaked seed on top. A slice of pear,or orange sprink-
led with sugar, is provided about twice a week. Mealworms, small or cut
up, are given when rearing (about four to six), morning and evening.
Sometimes bushes are beaten for insects in the summer. A vitamin prepa-
ration is occasionally added to the water, usually Vitaflight or Vitality
Plus (same product, different name). Occasionally other products are used.
I do not use a vitamin preparation on a regular basis. I may use it twice
one week and then miss a week so perhaps it would be fairer to say that I
use it as and when I think of it. I do not use vitamin preparations when
chicks are less than a week old as I have sometimes found that this results
in chicks being ejected.
I hope that this article will encourage others to continue to build up a
strain of these birds and other small unusual seedeaters before any future
legislation in various countries prevents us from doing so.

Two races of the Bicheno Finch are recognised (see Blakers, M. et al,
1984, for the most up-to-date distribution details).
P.b. bichenovii has a white rump and is often referred to as the Banded
Finch and P.b. annulosa, which has a black rump, is given the name Black-
ringed Finch. It is reported that where the range between the two races
overlaps, not only are there white-rumped and black-rumped specimens
but also individuals showing variable amounts of white feathering on an
otherwise black rump (Keast, 1958; Mathews, 1926). In captivity, the
black-rumped race has proved to be recessive to the white-rumped and
when mated together, only white-rumped birds are produced (which are,
of course, split for black-rumped).
The black-rumped race is very rare in captivity. There are a certain
number about, however, and in October 1985 I purchased a hen from, of
all places, the Parrot Society Show at Luton. Two months later, at the
National Exhibition of Cage Birds (held at the N.E.C., Birmingham) I saw
another on a dealer's stand. Much as I would have liked to purchase this
bird, upon inspection it was found to have a severe vent disorder so I left
well alone. However, someone did purchase the bird as, about half an hour
later, I noticed it was missing from the dealer's cage.
Housing
Although Bichenos can be of a somewhat nervous disposition, they will
settle well to cage life and under such conditions can prove extremely
prolific. My breeding pairs are housed in box cages measuring 0.91 x 0.41
x 0.41 m. Young and resting adults are housed in cages 1.8 m x 0.41 x
0.41 m, with no more than 10 birds per cage.
Breeding
A nest-box is placed ready in a rear corner of the cage immediately
before the breeding pair is introduced. The design I use is a 0.13 m cube
with a 0.04 m opening. A hinged lid is fitted, thus making nest inspection
a simple matter. To the nest-box is added a layer of clean, white sawdust
 |(or shavings) and the box is then filled with a mixture of coconut fibre
and soft hay, after which a hollow is made by placing the ball of one's fist
into the material. A small amount of nesting material is placed on the floor

of the cage (under the nest-box so that it does not become soiled with
droppings). Rarely do the birds use this extra material, although cock birds
will take up pieces of the hay for display purposes (see later).
A breeding pair will usually enter the nest-box almost immediately they
are released into the breeding cage. Even those which prove a little shy of
the box will most certainly enter for the night period and from then on
use it regularly.
Unlike certain species of Australian finch such as the Gouldian Chloe-
bia gouldiae (see Mobbs, 1985a), Bichenos do not appear to have a set
pattern when breeding. Because of this, I can only describe the average
breeding cycle taken from details kept on a number of pairs.
Usually a pair will start to incubate before the final egg of the clutch
is laid. Chicks always hatch within a two to three day period of each other,
so 1 presume most pairs do not start to incubate in earnest until at least
the second or third egg has been laid. The average clutch is four, and
chicks begin to hatch after 12 days. They are minute at first and it is very
difficult to discern how many chicks there are in a nest if one takes only
a perfunctory glance. Upon hatching the chicks are flesh-coloured and
covered in white down. The down is lost and the flesh darkens within
three to six days of hatching. At this time the quills of the primaries begin
to appear.
When the chicks are seven days old, the parent birds appear, during the
day, to brood only spasmodically and by the ninth day, brooding ceases
altogether although both parent birds will sleep in the nest-box at night.
Both parents feed the chicks, often entering the nest at the same time.
When the chicks are 10 days old, it is possible to close-ring them. One
certainly should not attempt to do so before this age and it is often pos-
sible to close-ring chicks of up to 13-14 days of age.
Chicks begin to leave the nest from about 28 days. At first they may
leave the nest-box for only a matter of minutes, after which they will
return. As they become more mature, they will leave the nest for longer
periods, but always return to roost.
Chicks can be removed from their parents at approximately six weeks
old; left longer, the parent birds are likely to attack them.
With Gouldian Finches, I always remove the nest-box from the breed-
ing cage when the chicks are one month old (Mobbs, 1985a). Bichenos
become so attached to their nest-box that to remove it would no doubt
cause stress both to the parent birds and the chicks. Indeed, for the first
few days after the chicks are moved from the breeding cage to a growing-
on cage (see above), they will, in the late evening, search around the cage
in obvious distress, until eventually they settle down on a perch to roost.
Some breeders supply young birds with a nest-box in which to sleep, but

A.J. MOBBS - OBSERVATIONS ON THE BICHENO FINCH
I am totally against this practice as not only may it induce young birds to
attempt nesting long before they should, it also encourages the birds to
remain timid, hiding away in the box whenever anyone enters the bird-
room.
The moment the chicks are removed from their parents, the breeding
cage should be thoroughly cleaned, the nest-box emptied of its contents,
washed, refilled with nesting material and placed into position. It is im-
perative that this is carried out immediately the chicks are removed as the
hen will almost certainly start to lay a further clutch within a matter of
days. Indeed, I have known hens lay eggs when the chicks they are rearing
are only four weeks old. One pair which did this actually reared the chicks
already with them and carried on to successfully hatch the second clutch
and rear the chicks to independence.
Bichenos can prove prolific breeders but, as with all the birds that I
keep, I only allow each pair to rear two clutches each season. This means
that when the breeding season is over and the pairs are split up, the hens
always carry on laying eggs for a week or so after being placed in the rest-
ing cages. Such eggs should be collected up the moment they are found
and either discarded or, if one is not against the use of foster parents, put
under Bengalese Finches, as these eggs almost invariably prove fertile.
Growth of chicks
Bichenos, when first they leave the nest are only half the size of an
adult. Many have pin feathers on and around the head and the tail
feathers are at the most only half grown.
Well-fed chicks have the same feather pattern as an adult but the
colours are much subdued, the face mask and the breast band being
greyish white, with the black and white markings on the wings much less
defined than in an adult bird.
Chicks which have not received a sufficiently nutritious diet often
have only the top black breast bar, others may have no breast bars at all,
the whole of the upper chest and breast being greyish white. Chicks
marked thus always moult out normally, attaining the usual adult plu-
mage with the first moult.
Bichenos begin the first moult into adult plumage at approximately
six weeks old and well-fed chicks attain full adult plumage within eight
to nine weeks. Although not a particularly vocal species, young cocks
often begin to sing at six weeks old.
Because Bichenos attain full adult plumage at a relatively early age,
many aviculturists put young birds down to nest far too early. Many hens
can be lost because of this, due mainly to egg-binding. Although a
young Bicheno appears fully adult at approximately eight weeks old, if

such birds are compared with adult birds of, say, seven months or more
it will be noticed that the young birds are usually smaller. I have found
that young Bichenos will continue to mature until they are at least six
to seven months old. Therefore I never use a Bicheno for breeding pur-
poses until it is at least nine months old.
Many young hens will begin to lay eggs at this age. If they do, it is a
good sign that they are ready for breeding.
Adult hens housed in resting cages will begin to lay eggs soon after
the annual moult is completed. Indeed many will become so keen to
breed that they will lay in the seed bowls and often continue to sit in
the bowls after the eggs have been removed. I remember one hen in
particular who did this. When eventually I paired her up and placed her
in the breeding cage, she laid eggs in the nest-box but when it was the
cock's turn to incubate, the hen, after taking food, could be found
sitting in the seed pot until it was her turn to incubate again.

Diet
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999169875" page_id="58077817"  page_num="Page 89" year="" vol="">
The staple diet supplied to my Bichenos consists of pearl white millet,
pannicum millet and plain canary seed. All are supplied in separate dishes.
Spray millet is available permanently as is oyster shell, limestone and min-
eralised grit. A piece of cuttlefish 'bone' is attached to the cage front per-
manently and flaked cuttlefish 'bone' is given at least three times a week.
A dish of soaked seeds (consisting of one part budgerigar mixture to one
part plain canary seed) is given daily. Non-breeding birds take only small
amounts, but pairs with chicks and young birds take these seeds avidly
and are offered as much as they will consume.
Thoroughly washed lettuce is given to breeding pairs three times daily;
non-breeding birds and young birds are offered lettuce every other day.
Once or twice a week a teaspoonful of Kilpatrick's Iodised Minerals
(for pigeons) is placed on the floor of the cage. This is taken avidly and is
eaten so quickly it is not on the cage floor long enough to become soiled
with droppings.
No livefood is offered, but pairs with young will take a good proprietary
brand of egg food, especially when their chicks are between one to ten
days old. When the chicks are weaned, egg food is offered until they com-
plete their first moult. Hen eggshell is also offered about twice a week to
both breeding and non-breeding birds. The shells should first be placed in
nearly boiling water for approximately three minutes, then left to dry
before being offered, or if not required immediately, should be stored in a
clean screw-top jar ready for use. As with most Australian finches,
Bichenos seem to prefer the egg shell to be offered in large pieces.

Sexing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993155" page_id="58077818"  page_num="Page 90" year="" vol="">
It is extremely difficult to sex Bichenos by visual means. Cocks sup-
posedly have brighter masks and chest bands than hens, and the black
chest bars on the former are supposedly wider. This may prove correct in
certain cases, but what does one do when one is confronted with an ex-
ceptionally well marked hen or a poorly marked cock?
For the past year I have used the following method of sexing and to
date, it has proved the ideal way in which to deal with this problem. To
use this method one requires at least two birds and preferably they should
have been housed together for at least a couple of weeks. Then, if one
considers that they may not be a true pair, remove one to a cage on its
own. If either bird is a cock, then within seconds (yes, that is all it will
take), the bird will start singing. It is noticeable that a cock bird will,
the moment it is caged on its own, stand in an alert position on the perch,
hardly moving at all. It may call for a moment or so but will then begin
to sing.
If the bird is a hen, it will prove extremely restless, moving from perch
to perch continually and although it may call, it obviously will not sing.
As mentioned, a cock bird caged on its own will sing almost immediately
but to ensure that a non-singing bird is, in fact, a hen, it is prudent to
leave the bird caged on its own for at least two or three minutes as,
although I have yet to encounter a cock which did not sing within seconds
of being placed on its own, to be completely sure that a non-singing bird
is a hen, one should at least give it the opportunity to prove otherwise.
So accurate have I found this method of sexing that I can now sex a
cage of, say, ten birds within half an hour. It is preferable if the birds that
are about to be sexed are in full adult plumage&amp;quot;, although I have known
young cock birds which were not in full adult plumage, which, when
placed on their own, at least attempted to sing.
All my young stock is housed in cages which can be divided down the
centre and the birds are easily segregated when one wishes to sex them.
Perhaps I should mention that the divider must be solid (mine are made
of plywood) as the bird placed on its own must not be able to see others
of its kind.
Song and display
Bicheno cocks are not often heard to sing unless caged on their own,
out of sight of other Bichenos (see above). Some young cocks from
approximately eight weeks old will sing even when in the company of
others (of either sex), but as they mature, the song is heard less frequently
until eventually many appear never to sing at all.
Some cocks, whilst the hen is incubating, will sing for lengthy periods,

however as soon as the hen appears, these cocks always cease to sing im-
mediately. Overall the species is not vocally inclined and those cocks
which are appear to be the exception.
The species is certainly active and between rest periods, non-breeding
birds are almost always on the move. At such times both sexes will call
continually. Morris (1958) describes the two call-notes thus: 'Lost-calling
is a plaintive twoooo-Woooo, social-calling (is) similar to that of the
Zebra Finch Poephila guttata .' The 'lost-calling' (or locating call) is loud
for such a small bird and when 30-40 Bichenos all give this call in the close
confines of a birdroom, the volume of sound can be quite considerable.
'Social-calling' (or contact-call) is much more subdued and as Morris
(loc cit) mentions, is similar to that of the Zebra Finch but quieter.
I have not witnessed the mating display as described by Morris (loc cit)
to its full extent. As mentioned in earlier notes on this species (Mobbs,
1985b), I have not witnessed the excessive bill-wiping described by Morris
and only occasionally have I witnessed cock birds taking up the courting
postures described. Never have I observed a cock bird singing while dis-
playing and from the many birds I have studied, I find it difficult to
believe that the song is used during courtship, but believe it is used only
for 'advertising'.
For those who do not have access to the paper by Morris, I include, in
its entirety, his description of the display of the cock Bicheno: 'The male
assumes a courting posture in which the plumage is fully fluffed, so that
the body appears spheroid, with no special differential erection of the
feathers of the type found in most other species. The bird crouches over
the perch, parallel to the female, with his head twisted towards her. In
this position he sings and beak-wipes; in order to perform the latter, he
does not have to move as far as he would if his courting posture was
similar to his more generalised stance. It seems as if the posture is itself
part of the beak-wiping; the bird performs the action so many times, that
he never, so to speak, quite straightens up again, until after the whole
courting phase is over.
'No dance movements were seen in this species
Since my notes appeared on the grass-carrying sequence (Mobbs,
1985b), I have witnessed other cock birds in my collection carrying out
the procedure, so obviously it is part of the display of the Bicheno Finch
which may not have been witnessed by others. In the notes, I mentioned
that I could find no reference in the literature to this procedure. Since
the notes appeared, I have, in fact, located one reference (Rutgers and
Norris, 1977), the details of which, although questionable, are quoted
here: 'The nuptial dance of the male takes place on the ground; he dances
around the female carrying a long blade of grass in his raised beak. He

rumped race of the Bicheno Finch.

Of the two races of Bicheno Finch, only the white-rumped is bred in
sufficient numbers for it to be secure in aviculture. Specimens of the
black-rumped race are in existence (in aviculture) but numbers appear to
be very limited and unless a concerted effort is made to breed from these
birds, the race could eventually be lost completely as it is doubtful if wild-
caught specimens will ever again be allowed out of Australia. It is possible
that there are black-rumped specimens in the possession of bird keepers
who do not even know they have what is obviously a rare subspecies. If
you keep Bichenos, take a look at their rump colour and if you find you
have a black-rumped bird, either attempt to breed from it or release it to
someone who will.
The Bicheno can prove extremely prolific and is easily bred in a roomy
box-type cage. Sexing can prove difficult but if the method described
above is used, the sex of one's birds should easily be determined.
A varied and substantial diet is essential, especially when chicks are
being reared; at such times, soaked seeds and egg food will be taken avidly
by the parent birds. Failure to supply an adequate diet may result in weak
undersized chicks and can also affect the plumage, i.e. lack of the black
breast bars.
To date there appears to be no colour mutation in the Bicheno Finch
even though fairly substantial numbers are bred each year in Europe.

(Avicultural Research Unit, South Africa)
Alternative names for this species are the Natal Linnet, Striped Canary,
.lundevalTs Seedeater and Grass Shelly. It is an active bird usually found in
&gt;airs or small parties, keeping to the forest canopy and adjacent scrub and
xotic vegetation.
The population of the Forest Canary is arranged into three subspecies:
he male of the nominate race S. s. scotops has the forehead, crown, nape,
nan tie and back bright olive green, heavily streaked with blackish green;
he rump and upper tail-coverts are olive green as is the tail which is edged
jvith black; the stripe over the eye is yellow, the ear-coverts green and chin
&gt;lackish; greater and lesser wing-coverts are blackish brown, edged with
ellow; the throat is yellow; the breast and belly green streaked with
blackish green; the under tail-coverts are yellow, the eye brown, the bill
10 m and the legs and feet brownish. S. s. umbrosus is similar to S. s. sco-
ops but the upper parts are darker green, the rump olive green streaked
vith blackish green. S. s. transvaalensis is also similar to S. s. scotops but
he lower throat and breast are darker and the flanks more heavily
treaked. The female of the nominate race resembles the male but differs
n having the underparts duller and more heavily streaked. Immature birds
esemble females but are duller.
The Forest Canary is restricted to South Africa. The nominate race is
o be found in the eastern Cape Province, Transkei and Natal (coastal and
ower midlands); S.s. umbrosus in southern Cape Province (coastal reg-
ons), Griqualand East, Natal, western Zululand and south-eastern Trans-
aal;,S. s. transvaalensis in the eastern and northern Transvaal (highlands),
nd probably also western Swaziland.
The song of the male is a brisk warbling, interspersed with trills, being
imilar to the Cape Canary Serinus canicollis but weaker and more high-
bitched. Normal call is a low tsik.
The Forest Canary feeds on the green seeds of weeds, berries and fruit,
t has been recorded eating the leaf petioles of the Sneezewood Tree
*raeroxylon obliquum and the fruits of Rubiaceae (gardenia family). In
he aviary they will take readily to a finch mixture (four parts yellow
nanna, one part red manna, two parts canary and one part white millet&amp;quot;
nd insects, namely aphids and Black Mound Termite workers. Sweei
ipple was supplied by Neville Brickell as a substitute for indigenous fruit

reenfood in the form of chickweed and thistle must be given at least
ice a week. Neville Bricked found that they were extremely partial to the
iripe seed of the Blackjack Bidens pilosa and will always appreciate
ctras such as Khaki-weed Altemanthera pungens, Canary Creeper Senecio
moides, unripe sunflower seed, germinating seed, spray millet and seed-
g wild grass heads. Andrew Green regularly fed the small yellow seed
jads of the Klein Geelbossie Senecio polyanthemoides which was relished
/ the birds. When his birds were nesting Neville Brickell supplied insect-
and egg food daily. A great many aviculturists today use only the pro-
letary breakfast cereal 'Pro Nutro' as a soft food with excellent results.
This species nests during the summer months, constructing a cup-
taped nest in bushes or small trees, 1-5 m from the ground, in dense
)ver. Both sexes carry material which consists of moss and various sorts
f vegetable down. The cup is lined with stringy lichen. An average clutch
jmprises two to four, usually three, white to bluish white eggs, spotted
ith greys and browns, mainly at the thick end. The first recorded breed-
g in captivity was registered with the society in 1952, followed by a
-cond in 1955 and a third in 1959, No data was made available. Neville
&amp;apos;rickell's aviary breeding in 1969 revealed that three eggs were laid. They
ere incubated solely by the female for a period of 14 days. During incu-
ation the male fed the female, usually on the nest, but also away from
when she left to bathe. The young were fed by both parents and re-
ained in the nest for 15 days after which they were not seen for seven
ays as they had concealed themselves in an adjacent bush. A wicker
mary cup was used as a nest-site which had been thickly lined with
ringy pieces of coir. In September 1984 Andrew Green was successful
|i rearing one chick which was hatched in a naturally built cup nest, situa-
:d under cover in the sleeping quarters. In a second attempt, which was
^successful, a jam tin was utilised as a nest-site. In 1955 Mr. C.H. Russell
&amp;apos;toduced a hybrid between Serinus scotops and S. mozambicus.

NOTES ON THE RED-HEADED FINCH Amadina ery throcepht
AND THE CUT-THROAT FINCH A. fasciata
By NEVILLE BRICKELL
(Avicultural Research Unit, South Africa)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989821485714286" page_id="58077824"  page_num="Page 96" year="" vol="">
Hall and Moreau (1970) consider these small seed-eating birds of the
weaver-finch family as belonging to the mannikin family. The above spe-
cies form the first of three logical species-groups: the African Silverbill
Lonchura malabarica and the Pearl-headed Silverbill L. grisecapilla form
another; the Bronze Mannikin L. cuculata. Red-backed Mannikin L. bi-
color and Pied Mannikin L. fringilloides form the third. The Red-headed
Finch has been given alternative names such as the Paradise Sparrow, Red-
headed Amadina and Red-headed Weaver-Finch and the Cut-Throat Finch
has also been called the Cut-throat Weaver, Cut-throat Amadina, Ribbon
Finch and Ribbon Weaver-finch.
These are common, highly gregarious species, living in pairs or small
flocks but outside the breeding season they gather into large flocks. The
typical mannikins favour moist, riparian fringing forests and dense thickets
whereas Cut-throats live mostly in dry acacia savanna and disused cultiva-
tion. They are very partial to dust bathing in the aviary and in the wild.
The identification of the nominate races has been described by a
number of researchers and therefore further comment is not necessary.
The race of Red-headed Finch A.e. dissita differs from the nominate race
in having the head a darker, more crimson red; the white spots on the ven-
tral surface larger and whiter; the black barring and fringing broader; wings
and tail darker and greyer. The female's upper parts are darker and greyer,
less warm brown; the crown feathers are more purplish, less reddish. The
race of Cut-throat Finch A.f. alexanderi differs from the nominate race in
having broader barring both above and below. A.f. meridionalis is similar
to A.f alexanderi and has a smaller bill. A.f. contigua differs from A.f me
idionalis in being warmer and redder brown above; little or no buff on
the chin; breast and flanks more washed with russet buff. Females lack the
buff chin and red throat band; centre of belly white or cinnamon. Young
birds resemble the female, but males have a pale red band across the
throat.
The Red-headed Finch ranges from the Cape, Natal, Orange Free State
and Transvaal provinces of South Africa, South West Africa, Botswana,
western Zimbabwe to Angola. The Cut-throat Finch occurs in north-wes-
tern Orange Free State, eastern Swaziland, Natal, Zululand, southern Moz-
ambique, Zimbabwe, northern and north-eastern Botswana, northern

South West Africa and the Caprivi Strip, Malawi, Kenya, eastern Tanzania,
Uganda, Somalia, Ethiopia, south-eastern Sudan, northern Nigeria to
Senegal.
Cut-throats spend much of their time foraging on the ground feeding
mainly on seeds, but some insects are taken, especially flying termites. In
the aviary, besides the various kinds of seeds, they must be supplied
regularly with insects when nesting, namely mealworms, thrips larvae and
nymphs, bristle-tails, spring-tails or fish moths. Little interest may be
shown in green food except freshly cut lucerne and grass seedheads. It is
advisable to supply softfood such as hard-boiled egg, wholewheat bread or
moistened dog biscuit.
Cut-throats do not often build nests of their own, but are perfectly
capable of constructing an untidy ball of dry grass with a short tunnel
entrance at the side when choosing a tree, shrub or bush, or in a hole in a
building, the latter preferred by Red-headed Finches. The nest chamber is I
lined with feathers, wool and other available soft materials. More often
they utilise the nests of other species. The Red-headed Finch is recorded
nesting in the deserted nests of the Little Swift Apus affinis, Buffalo
Weaver Bubalomis albirostris niger, Social Weaver Philetairus socius,
Masked Weaver Ploceus velatus inustus and Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus.
In captivity they are notorious for evicting other birds from their nest
chambers, regardless of whether they contain eggs or very young nestlings.
There is one record in the wild of a pair of breeding Social Weavers being
evicted and the Red-heads laying themselves. The Cut-throat Finch has
been recorded robbing the lining from one Buffalo Weaver's nest and
taking it into another; also a female repeatedly trying to enter the nest oi
an incubating weaver. They also commonly use the abandoned nests oi
species listed above with the addition of the Spotted-backed Weaver Plo-
ceus cucullatus , Red-billed Quelea Quelea quelea and a record in a wood
pecker's hole. In the aviary they may be supplied with standard Finch-type
nesting boxes containing some nesting material to entice the birds to use
them. They will introduce extra material themselves as well as adding more
throughout the incubation period. Both birds build, the male carrying ane
the female arranging it in position. The Red-headed Finch lays 3-8
usually 4-6 white eggs; incubation is shared by both sexes and lasts for 12
14 days. The young are fed by both parents, remaining in the nest for 20
23 days. Unfortunately the Cut-throat Finch is far more prone to egg
binding than the Red-heads and it is, therefore, advisable, to encourage the
birds to breed during the warmer months. Aviary birds will quite readily
breed three times in a season, laying replacement clutches if robbed. Cut
throat Finches lay four to six, nine on record, white eggs - the high figure

;xes incubate for 12-13 days, the young remain in the nest for 22-24
ays. Adult plumage is attained at 70-75 days and they commence
reeding at eight to nine months old.
It is reported that captive Red-heads have been taught to talk, though
ot as well as parrots. The crossing of the Red-headed Finch with the
ut-throat Finch produces male hybrids which are fertile. The Red-headed
inch has also been crossed with the Java Sparrow Padda oryzivora, the
ut-throat Finch with Parson Finch Poephila cincta, African Silverbill
uodice can tans, Indian Silverbill Euodice malabarica and Java Sparrow
*adda oryzivora. The most attractive crossing is the male Cut-throat
inch and a female white Java Sparrow.

Following concern over the status of the Hooded Siskin Carduelis
cucullata in its native Venezuela, an attempt at surveying the captive
population of this delightful species was undertaken. Although a fairly
ambitious project, details of the proposed census were circulated, via
four regional collators, to many journals and individuals throughout the
world in the hope of obtaining as much publicity as possible for the
project.
Problems encountered were many, the most restrictive being the
language barrier but despite this, some valuable information has been
forthcoming, a summary of which is set out below.
For convenience the data has been divided into two sections:
CAPTIVE STATUS - attempts to summarise the populations for each
country from which information was received and is applicable to 1984,
data being requested for 1st January 1985; HUSBANDRY - attempts
to analyse the methods adopted by the various aviculturists who for-
warded details.

VENEZUELA- Replies were received from three breeders, Juan Camacaro,
Vincenzo Serino and Domingo Conde, all of whom had kept the species
for some considerable time, 30, 20 and 28 years respectively. Breeding
has taken place over a number of years with Serino and Conde report-
ing success covering as many years as kept. Camacaro has been breeding
the species for five years. Numbers reared in 1984 were 3, 24 and 26.
At maximum, there are believed to be only one or two other
breeders in the country with whom contact was not made.

GIBRALTAR. At present being bred by D. Galliano. Five young reared in
1984 proved to be four cocks and one hen from one pair. Total number
of birds is now three pairs and two odd males.
NORWAY. Does not seem to be represented. Enquires by H.R. Grastveit
to the country's eight bird societies proved negative.
DENMARK. On hearsay, represented in several collections with breeding
reported in one. Many letters written but practically no replies.
SWEDEN. Represented in at least one collection, that of U. Magnusson
who has several birds.
BRITAIN. Very few birds with a total population of less than a dozen.
Most are males in the hands of canary breeders but a pair owned by
H. Brierley bred for the first time in 1984, rearing four (3/1).
WEST GERMANY. Details of the census were printed in several magazines
but only one reply was obtained, and that from an aviculturist who had
just obtained his pair. However, Dr. Joachim Steinbacher, editor of
Die Gefiederte Welt, states: T am now quite sure that we have in
Germany many hundreds of successful breeders.
ITALY. Through the co-operation of the Federazione Ornicoltori Italiani
who initially sent a list of 14 keepers/breeders, we were able to obtain
the only documented evidence provided by our returns, that the
Hooded Siskin is bred in quite substantial numbers, confirming a
generalisation made by Bruno Mancini in Cage and Aviary Birds (ref-
erence unknown).
Of the 14, replies from only three materialised but they do provide
an insight into how prolific the species can be with the correct manage-
ment techniques. One can only surmise that the species is well estab-
lished in Italy. Their achievements for 1984 are as follows:-

SPAIN. The only reply was received from Juliana Miralles Vila, via the
Federacion Ornitologica Venezolana. Success being achieved for the
previous 16 years with the 1984 season yielding 29 independent
young from six pairs. Although impossible to ascertain numbers, it
would appear from the above success, and various breeding accounts
which unfortunately lack numerical data, that its existence is well
established in Spain.
BELGIUM. No helpful replies but on hearsay it is believed to be exten-
sively bred.
HOLLAND. As for Belgium.
No replies were received from New Zealand, Japan, Malaya, Singa-
pore, Switzerland, Portugal, Hungary, Austria, East Germany or France.
However, in fairness, it must be said that in most cases the language}
problem and lack of contacts were a considerable barrier. Despite the
problems, it is possible to get an idea of how the captive population stands.}
Unlike the situation in the wild, numbers of the Hooded Siskin in captivity
seem to be on an upward trend, even if only in a limited number of
countries, and it is more than probable that the number held in captivity
exceeds the wild population.
The unsavoury practice of smuggling continues to be a threat to the;
wild population and it is a situation that must not be condoned, but one
cannot help wondering whether the practice could be completely stamped
out if the Venezuelan authorities allowed the export of captive-bred, close-
rung birds, especially males, of which there seems to be a surplus and for
which there is most demand. Captive breeding could also, in time, satisfy
a local demand.
In response to our efforts, three Venezueland aviculturists sent in their
returns: between them they have 78 years' experience in keeping, and 53
years of breeding the Hooded Siskin, rearing 53 young in 1984. To ignore
this depth of experience in an endangered species' homeland, while trying
to save it from extinction seems shortsighted indeed.

To make the task of compilation simpler and information easier to pin-
point, material is placed under separate headings, roughly along the lines
)f the questionnaire, but with additional data included where necessary.
History of stock. Where details have been divulged, it seems that most
&gt;wners obtained their breeding stock from established breeders. Certainly
n European countries at least the vast majority of birds, if not all, are now
*aptive-bred.
Identification. Many birds are close-rung, but it appears that in Italy,
seeders of the Hooded Siskin (and others?) are registered with the Feder-
izione Ornicoltori Italian! and given their own coded rings. Lattanzi was
he only one to give details on rings, his being put on during the sixth day.
Accommodation. The method favoured by ALL breeders was an indoor
environment, although Barnicoat did experiment with a completely cov-
ered outdoor aviary with some success. Indoor accommodation allows a
means of controlling temperature, if necessary, and eliminates problems
caused by dramatic changes of climate, and predators.
Cage sizes seemed unimportant as results were not proportionate to
.pace provided. Bertolini bred his birds in cages measuring 60 cm x 30 cm
t 30 cm which were presumably of the box type with a wire front. Only
'Barnicoat and Brierley kept their birds in what could be considered flight
;ages, and which had a minimum length of 180 cm; both have bred
rl
Voung.
All others housed their birds in presumably box-type cages, the length
of which varied between 60 and 80 cm with height and depth roughly half
the length size. Only Lattanzi gave extra depth in proportion to length.
Most breeders keep their birds in a quiet, tranquil area to avoid dis-
turbance but Conde never found it necessary and kept his birds in the
Aitchen, with all the accompanying noise and '...my birds still reproduce in
a most healthy manner'.
The subject of artificial light is only mentioned by Pontiggia who ex-
pends day length by about half an hour before dawn, starting at the
beginning of March to arrive at a maximum of an hour by the end of
April. This regime is kept up until the end of July.
Where heat is controlled, a range between 15-21*C seems to be pre-
 |ferred but several breeders allow it to drop much lower. Although fit birds
yeem able to cope, as Pontiggia notes, health problems may be encoun-
tered, particularly in elderly birds.

which several authors give very detailed information. Pontiggia, who goes
into it very thoroughly, gives the following:

All give additional food during the breeding season, several provide it
ust prior, as the birds approach breeding condition. Rivero suggests a
nixture of 65% bird seed, 10% rape, 10% niger and 5% each of turnip
;eed, linseed and hemp. Conde feeds a mixture of one pound of rape, one
30 und of oats and half a pound each of hemp&amp;quot;and wheat germ, blended
n a liquidiser. Brierley gives a quarter of a teaspoon of a mixture of
inseed, hemp, teazle and a few groats, half a teaspoon of niger and rape
id lib.
The provision of a soft food is practised by most, although Brierley
hates that although his young were reared by canaries, they would not
touch egg food. Several formulae are given below:
Serine: 2 litres of milk mixed with 1 kilo of cornmeal and two eggs.
Vila: A paste with a base of breadcrumbs, soya flour and some seeds
such as niger and rape. Additional to this, Vitamin E, calcium and
Terramycin (oxytetracycline - an antibiotic) are included in the
breeding season. Extra water is added, if necessary to ensure the
mixture is not compacted.
Other items offered during breeding are: hard-boiled egg, chickweed,
lettuce (of which they seem to be extremely fond), watercress, dandelion,
green pepper, apple plus the usual cuttlefish 'bone and mineralised grit.
Only Rivera mentions livefood - '. small portions of insects, such as
mealworms, are indispensable'.
Out of the breeding season, many feed 'standard' canary mixture, plus
greenfood and fruit. Lattanzi, however, feeds a mixture of six parts plain
canary, four parts niger, one part small hemp, one part linseed and half
a part each of teazle, chicory and lettuce seed.
Nest Receptacle. The most favoured receptacle seems to be a 'typical'
canary nest pan but the material from which this is made seems to differ
from country to country and is either of plastic, wood or wicker. Only
Pontiggia mentions the use of half open-fronted boxes; these he placed
high up, three to a cage.
Nesting material The type used for canaries seems to be the most
favoured but moss, fine dried grass, plumber's hemp and horsehair are
also offered. Serino offers 'strings of jute which is usually enough to bring
females into breeding condition'.
f-
Nest Construction. Carried out mainly by the female but behaviour is
variable with some males assisting.

Pairing. Rivero reports males to be polygamous and very active sex- j
ually, both in the wild and in captivity. Most breeders keep their birds in
pairs but Pontiggia had one 'very restless' male which he used to introduce
to a female when about to lay. In this way, he could get four hens to lay
almost together. Bertolini reports using 12 males with 15 breeding females.
Clutch Size. Ranges from three to five whitish eggs. Approximate size
15.8 mm by 12.2 mm (Rivero).
Number of Broods. Rivero gives the number of broods in the wild as
one or two. Captive pairs can have as many as four but three seems to be
the most usual for prolific pairs in an average breeding season of about five
months. Less prolific pairs may only have one or two. Generally it seems
that pairs kept as canaries are the most prolific in terms of broods, and
consequently numbers, reared.
Incubation. By female alone and lasts from 12-14 days.
Fertility. Only two breeders give statistics. Bertolini says 'in the region
of 80% while Pontiggia gives 'hatch percentage' as 85-95%. However,
where fertile eggs have been laid with others, percentage hatching seems to
have been very good. At present there seems little degeneration of stock.
Bertolini gives dead-in-shell as 3% but this must surely be an acceptable
level.
Progress of Chicks from Hatching. (Rivero) 'Young are born with
dark reddish skin, covered with fine grey down. For the first three to five
days, only the female feeds the young but after approximately the fifth
day the male helps with the feeding. When the male brings food to the
young, he gives a soft "call". The young, recognising this call, immediately
raise their heads and open their beaks to be fed. After the sixth day, the
young give small chirps or peeps in a tone that seems to be characteristic
of the species of the genus Carduelis.
'It is the female that cleans the nest from the first to approximately the
seventh or eighth day. After each feeding, the young face the centre of
the nest, depositing small faecal sacs on the edge of the nest. These are
picked up by the female and thrown out. From about the eighth day
the young have grown sufficiently to expel the faecal sacs over the edge
of the nest'.
Some breeders found males to be excitable and removed them when
young were in the nest. Their eyes open at six days old and they fledge
at about 15 days, although Barnicoat gives 21 days for his birds.

Independence. This is achieved in 32-40 days but, as with most birds,
the young may continue to be fed for a time afterwards.
Sex Ratio of Young. Bias seems to favour males, with all except Pon-
tiggia having bred a surplus. However, in his return he states: 'After many
/ears of breeding, I have noticed that the youngsters are more hens than
males, approximately one male to three hens'.
Hand-rearing. Pat Demko was the only breeder to report hand-rearing,
and then only if necessary. In such cases she used Abba 92 nestling food,
finely sifted, adding hot water and a little hard-boiled egg yolk. A split
plastic band expander was used to feed with. Babies being hand-fed are
kept in a hospital cage at 90*F if unfeathered, gradually lowering the
temperature as they feather.
Fostering. Three breeders, Serino, Brierley and Barnicoat, use fosters
for both incubation and rearing while others have potential foster parents
on hand in case the need arises. Canaries are the most favoured, but Pon-
tiggia has also used Redpolls, siskins and, in 1983, even a rosefinch hen.
Conde likewise fostered when necessary and found Andean Siskins Car-
duelis spinescens the best mothers and Yellow-bellied Siskins C. xantho-
gastra the best fathers. Pontiggia remarks on the subject, 'In my opinion,
the true mother gives the chicks all the antibodies they need to grow
perfectly, therefore I try, if at all possible, to parent-rear and to keep in
the youngsters the feeding instinct'.
f
Hybrids. The crossing of male siskins with the canary to obtain the
much sought-after 'red factor' is well known but other hybrids are on re-
cord. Rivero believes that hybrids with the Andean Siskin occur naturally
where the ranges overlap. This cross has also been achieved by Serino while
Pontiggia in Italy crossed it with Goldfinch, Redpoll, Mexican Rosefinch and
!&gt;iskin, presumably using the Hooded Siskin as male parent. A male from
the Redpoll cross proved fertile when mated back to a female Redpoll.
Longevity. On average Pontiggia gives a five or six year life span and is
of the opinion that a diet of canary, pannicum and sunflower seeds give
the longest life. A ten-year old male, still very fertile, is cited by Bertolini.
An eight-year old hen is still in the collection of Pat Demko.

the most part must be attributed to capture stress and resultant problems.
Only two returns touched on the subject of health: Pontiggia, with his
usual thoroughness, reports, 'Deaths usually happen, as with most birds, in
the very delicate period of the moult. It is well known that for specimens
not in good condition it is difficult to pass this vital period. A bad and
long moult is a symptom of not very good general condition and therefore
I do not use these specimens for future reproduction. It is generally three
to four year old birds that find the moult a trial.
'It can also happen that some youngsters show abdominal swelling. Any
birds showing symptoms are isolated and given only canary seed and let-
tuce. I think that it is possibly caused by an excessive preference for oily
seed, in particular niger and sunflower. Normally in this way, after about
20 days, specimens come back to normality. However, they are kept under
examination and if possible not used for breeding.
'Some deaths in winter are due to difficulty with respiration (usually
in old birds). I think this is due to a cold temperature of 2-3*C and also to
sudden changes in temperature. In these cases, I try to intervene, bringing
it up to about 10-11*C.
'However, I consider losses of 9-10% normal and therefore do not give
medicines'.
Rivero cites 'abdominal inflammation' as a cause of death, giving it as
'the most common and typical illness of Red Siskins', but gives no solution
other than antibiotics.
Vila relates that deaths are attributed to no specific illness and that
they generally appear to be stronger than canaries. Lack of notes by
others would suggest a relatively trouble-free species, if managed properly.
Precautionary Treatments. Only Pontiggia mentions giving a preventa-
tive prior to the breeding season. At about the end of February/early
March, a two-week course of Bimixim antibiotic is given and to avoid the
use of anti-acari insecticide powder, Tabar stripe insecticide is used in the
birdroom, changed on average once a month.

On 1st June 1986, members and their guests were again welcomed by
Miss Ruth Ezra and Mr. Raymond Sawyer, in the beautiful grounds of
Chestnut Lodge. The weather was overcast, but remained dry and warm as
Raymond escorted us around the superbly landscaped gardens and aviaries.
The wide spectrum of bird families represented ensures that there is
interest for everyone, however specialised their avicultural tastes. The
species breeding included Violet Touracos for the third year, Stella Lory
and Satyr Tragopans. A delightful pair of White-breasted Rail was es-
corting a brood of chicks, three pairs of Avocets were incubating as well
as Black-winged Stilts.
In the range of garden aviaries, hopes were high to repeat previous
successes with Rothschild's Myna, Emerald and Amethyst Starlings. A
pair of Double-toothed Barbets in immaculate condition was much ad-
mired, and another interesting and unusual species to be seen was the Kea,
young having been bred in 1984 and 1985. The variety of species exten-
ded from a Cock-of-the-Rock to sunbirds, Mot-mots, Long-tailed Sibias
and Malayan Crested Jays. A pair of Golden Heart Doves was incubating,
Stanley and Demoiselle Cranes had eggs and the Brent Geese had produced
their annual six goslings. They parade by the pool they share with a
magnificent flock of flamingos.
Jeffrey Trollope
Once again we are deeply grateful to Miss Ezra, our President, and
to Raymond Sawyer, for inviting members to what has become our most
popular social event. As always the gardens were looking immaculate and
with each year, the landscaping becomes even more attractive as shrubs,
trees and herbaceous borders mature. After our tour round the birds,
during which members saw much to admire and photograph, Miss Ezra
entertained us to a most delicious and lavish tea. Members enjoyed the
opportunity to sit on in the garden talking and it was very pleasant to
meet some new members and members who had travelled great distances
to be with us, the furthest coming from Scotland. Even the weather was
kind to us and the rain that had threatened all the afternoon, did not start
to fall until the last guest was leaving. Miss Ezra most generously donated
the proceeds from the ticket sales to our funds and the total raised,
including donations, was #148 for which we are particularly grateful as
the Society's finances are always in a parlous state. Our thanks again to

LONDON ZOO - 1985
By PETER OLNEY
Curator of Birds
1985 was in many ways a difficult year and this was reflected in a
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.998153967741935" page_id="58077838"  page_num="Page 110" year="" vol="">
reduction in number of species and individuals bred compared with pre-
vious years. There was considerable disturbance in the Zoo during the
breeding season because of demolitions and other essential work. This
caused some necessary moving of birds within the collection, and indeed
out of the collection. Disturbance and movements, coupled with an un-
usually long, cold spring with its relatively short days and low tempera-
tures, produced an overall reduction in breeding.
However, among the 149 individuals and 35 species successfully bred,
there were some of particular interest and value. Perhaps the most signifi-
cant was the hand-rearing of three Congo Peafowl. This shy, ground-
haunting pheasant which occurs in the rainforests of eastern Zaire is a
close relative of the Asiatic Peafowl, and is the only true pheasant in
Africa. Most remarkably, it was not discovered until 1936 when J.P. Chapin
found two mounted specimens in the Congo Museum in Tervueren, Bel-
gium. They had been wrongly identified as the Blue Peafowl and were
assumed to be birds escaped from captivity, but Chapin realised that they
were a species new to science for which he, on the evidence of one feather,
had been searching for 23 years.
At present there are only 60-70 of these birds in 12 zoos and collec-
tions, and ours are the only ones on public display in Britain. All Congo
Peafowl in captivity belong to Antwerp Zoo who, as part of a co-operative
breeding programme, generously lent birds to a number of selected zoos
and collections. The parents of the three bred here arrived in November
1984, and had laid their first clutch by May 1985. As the birds will re-lay,
eggs were taken away and artificially incubated. Four hatched, and three
were successfully reared. The incubation period was 28, 27, 27 and 30
days. The last egg was in a different incubator and the 30 days' incubation
period may be abnormal - the chick had to be assisted out of the egg and
was never a strong bird, eventually dying after 29 days.
Other noteworthy&amp;apos; breeding successes included the artificial incubation
and hand-rearing of eight Black-footed Penguins (our best year yet), two

There has been a good crop recently of books dealing with particular
groups of what I can only describe as water birds, though I think there
must be a better definition, and most of them are from the publishing
house of Croom Helm who continue to produce books of a very high
standard at what are reasonable prices today.
SEABIRDS: An Identification Guide
Text and illustrations by Peter Harrison. Croom Helm (first published
1983, revised edition 1985). ISBN 0-7099-3787-3, Price: #19.95. 448
pages. 88 colour plates. 324 distribution maps,* line drawings.
This book is a wonderful example of what one-track mindedness can
achieve. Peter Harrison has been interested in seabirds for over 20 years
and has been planning this comprehensive guide for almost as long. In
1973 he set out on a seven-year expedition to gather material, visiting all
the major seabird areas of the world, and spent several years as a deckhand
aboard trawlers and crayfishing boats where seabirds could be more easily
studied and sketched.
The result is a very impressive and important book which has already
become the standard work on seabirds. The original edition won the
Best Bird Book of the Year award in 1983 and this revised edition includes
much new information.
The 88 coloured plates depict almost 300 species and nearly every
major colour and plumage phase is shown in the 1600 paintings. Of neces-
sity the plates are rather crowded, averaging 20 and in some nearly 30

drawings. One can see that to have allowed more space would have greatly
increased the number of colour plates and therefore the price and, in fact,
one's eye soon gets used to selecting a particular bird from the rest on the
page. i
The families covered comprise: Penguins, Divers/Loons, Grebes, Alba-
trosses, Petrels and Shearwaters, Storm-petrels, Diving-petrels, Tropicbirds,
Pelicans, Gannets and Boobies, Cormorants, Frigatebirds, Phalaropes,
Sheathbills, Skuas, Gulls, Terns and Noddies, Skimmers, Auks and Sea-
ducks. Each species is described in detail and has a two-colour distribution
map indicating breeding, non-breeding and migratory distribution. There is
a very comprehensive bibliography..
As Roger Tory Peterson sums up in his introduction to this work: 'It
is doubtful whether any other ornithologist or birder can match the num-
ber of seabirds that Harrison has actually seen in life. Of the approximate
312 species, he has had field experience with all but 30. We salute him for
his industry and artistry in producing this book which will give us much
information and pleasure.'
This masterly and attractively produced summary of such a diverse and
often elusive group cannot be too highly recommended.
OCEAN BIRDS: Their Breeding, Biology and Behaviour

7099-1675-2. Price #16.95. 240 pages. 200 colour photographs; four

Another very attractive book from the same stable, this does not set
out to be a field guide, as the previous book, but rather a summary of our
knowledge of this great group of birds. The author, who is a founding
member of the Center tor the Study of Whales and Dolphins, has com-
bined his extensive field observations (which include ten years in the
merchant navy) with a deep concern for the environmental problems and
an awareness of the latest discoveries in the study of ocean birds. The
interesting and very readable text is grouped under the following chapter

The auks, or Alcidae (Great Auk, Razorbill, Dovekie, Common and
Thick-billed Murre, Black Guillemot and Atlantic Puffin), comprise one of
the most specialised but also extremely diverse groups of seabirds, exhibit-
ing a fascinating range of form and ecological adaptations. Moreover they
are the seabirds most vulnerable to man's activities, especially oil pollu-
tion, and hence are of great concern to conservationists. The last 10-15
years have seen an enormous amount of work on the auks, including a
number of long-term field studies. This book summarises for the first time
the information gained on breeding biology, population ecology, evolution
and conservation of this group. As the authors point out, as well as being
interesting in their own right, the auks have proved useful as model species
with which to explore many themes and problems in ecology and evolu-
tion.

SHOREBIRDS: An Identification Guide to the Waders of the World
By Peter Hayman, John Marchant and Tony Prater. Croom Elelm. 416
pages, 88 colour plates, distribution maps and line drawings. ISBN 0-
7099-2034-2. Price: #19.95.
We are told that birdwatching is now one of the most popular leisure
activities in Britain, over one million people being estimated to be involved.
Very large numbers also watch birds in North America and western Europe
and substantial numbers elsewhere in the world. Wetlands are a major hab-
i itat to which birdwatchers are drawn because a greater variety and number
of birds congregate there and of these waders form a substantial number
of species present. This group of birds is probably more international than
any other, for many waders undertake enormous migrations and vagrants
:an occur almost anywhere in the world. It is, therefore, one of the most
confusing groups of birds and there has long been a need for a really com-
 |prehensive identification guide. This book has been produced in the same
format as Peter Elarrison's Seabirds: An Identification Guide (reviewed
i above) and as there is some overlap in the species, the two books together
:over all the Charadriiformes. Herons, cranes and ibises are not included.
The text by John Marchant and Tony Prater is thorough and well-
researched, and four-colour maps clearly show breeding and non-breeding
distribution areas. Over 1800 paintings are included in the 88 colour plates

by Peter Hayman and whilst overcrowding could again be a criticism, the
additional identification information \0x25A0 that accompanies each plate is in-
valuable and by using this book, wader watchers will not only be able to
identify species easily, but also the birds' sex, age and racial origin. There
are also many attractive line drawings.
In its scope and detail this book is unique, tremendous value for money
and again, like its companion volume, highly recommended. I just wish
that the publishers had put a weather-proof cover on both volumes since
they will obviously spend most of their lives in and out of bird watchers'
pockets.

By James Hancock and James Kushlan. Croom Helm. ISBN 0-7099-3716-4.
Price #16,95. 288 pages. 65 colour plates painted by Robert Gillmor and
Peter Hayman; 21 line drawings; 61 distribution maps.
This is based on The Herons of the World , published in 1978, but the
text has been completely revised and enlarged and there are four extra
plates. It has been produced in a more popular, less expensive form (its
predecessor cost #46.00 eight years ago!) without loss of quality.
The book is worth buying just for the coloured plates, one of each
species, which are outstanding and a feast for Robert Gillmor's many
admirers, and Peter Hayman's work here too is excellent. The four plates
extra to the original are by Robert Gillmor and depict 60 white herons
and egrets of 11 species, showing subspecies, seasonal plumages and bare-
parts coloration, which it is hoped may help to sort out the problems of
identifying white birds in the field.
The 60 species of herons, egrets and bitterns that make up the family
Ardeidae are represented on every continent and many quite closely
related and similar-looking species are spread throughout the world. The
Herons Handbook will be an invaluable aid to identification as well as
summarising all that is currently known about this elegant and interesting
group.
As well as general chapters on classification, courtship, feeding and
identification, each species is described in detail under the headings of
identification, distribution and population (with a map showing range),
migration, habitat, behaviour, nest, eggs and young, and there is a
superb bibliography which must be the most comprehensive ever pre-
pared on this family.
This is a really excellent and superbly illustrated book, and amazing
value for money.

it was gratifying to find a liberal sprinkling from the Avicultnral Magazine.

RIVER BIRDS: Bird Life from Mountain Stream to Estuary.
By Roger Lovegrove and Philip Snow. Columbus Books. ISBN 0-86287-
093-3. #10.95; 128 pages; 48 watercolour and 60 line drawings.
This is a completely different book from any of the previous works
reviewed here, being a part-lyrical, but factual account of the progress of
the River Severn from source to sea, describing the birdlife encountered in
the many different habitats along its length. The many scenes are brought
to life through the very skilful illustrations. It is an ingenious idea, attrac-
tively realised by an harmonious partnership of author Roger Lovegrove,
who is RSPB officer for Wales and a regular contributor to radio and tele-
vision, and young artist Philip Snow whose work has already become well-
known through successful exhibitions.
This book would make a most welcome gift for anyone the least bit

Those able to read German will find a feast of valuable information in
the long-awaited Lexikon der Vogelhaltung. Its 678 pages are packed with
hundreds of excellent coloured photographs and line drawings of a large
proportion of the birds likely to be found in aviculture.
Arranged in dictionary form, as the title suggests, the entries cover
dozens of genera with details of representative forms; for example, that
for Amazona Parrots covers eight pages with four coloured photographs
and one line drawing. Avicultural information is not confined to Germany
but covers many other countries, including the U.K.
There are also entries for aviculturists and ornithologists, alive and
dead, also for general subjects such as feather-plucking. Forty-eight special-
ists contributed to the Lexikon', most are German writers, exceptions
being Dr. George Archibald, Otto Bernasek, Dr. R. Burkard and Rosemary
Low.
Produced in East Germany and edited by Dr. Franz Robiller, this au-
thoritative and absorbing work costs 98 marks, plus postage, or 40 US dol-
kars, from Buchexeport der DDR, VE Aussenhandelsbetrieb, Leninstrasse
16, Leipzig, DDR 7010.
It is hoped to find an English publisher so that the vast amount of
knowledge accumulated within its pages will have a wider readership.

Malcolm Ellis, who has a special interest in African birds, writes:
Many members must have wondered who was Fischer! It must be
doubtful that there are any members who are unfamiliar with Fischer's
Fovebird and Fischer's Whydah is quite well-known among aviculturists.
Fess well-known are Fischer's Touraco, Fischer's Greenbul, Fischer's
Starling and Fischer's Sparrow Fark.
All of these bear the name of their discoverer Gustav Adolf Fischer.
Born in Barmen, in March 1848, Fischer studied medicine and natural
i
sciences at the Universities of Bonn, Berlin and Wurzburg, joined the

medical corps of the German Army and in 1876 obtained indefinite leave
to devote himself to African exploration.
Fischer made several expeditions in East Africa and collected on the i
island of Zanzibar, where for four years he worked as a medical prac-
titioner. Fischer was the first white man to reach Fake Naivasha, in what
is now Kenya, and wrote that flocks of Egyptian Geese, about 50 strong,
were commonly met with on the marshy shores and described hearing the
loud joyous call of the Fish Eagle. Young Maasai warriors prevented that
expedition continuing northwards and on the return journey to the coast,
Fischer found Fake Natron where he saw Black Terns (there seems to be
no modern record of Black Terns occurring at Fake Natron), herons,
flamingos and pelicans, and he collected the first specimens of the Chest-
nut-banded Sand Plover.
Of the birds collected during that expedition, 36 species were described
as new and Reichenow named several of them after Fischer. Fischer's
Fovebird was described first from Ussure, in what is now Tanzania.
Although it does not bear his name, the Golden-winged Sunbird is another
of Fischer's discoveries.
Fischer died 11th November 1886, shortly after returning from another
expedition to Africa.
Opened in 1969 as a game-viewing lodge, Ngulia Fodge in Tsavo West
National Park, Kenya, has become unique in Africa as a site for the study
of the spectacular southward passage of northern migrants. It was the
game-viewing lights at Ngulia which first revealed that this lodge is on the
route used by vast numbers of southbound migrants.
On misty nights, between late October and January, when the moon
has yet to rise or has already set, the lights of this lodge attract down
thousands of migrants and these settle on trees, on and in the buildings,
the garden and sometimes even carpet the ground itself.

By 1981, 52,000 Palaearctic migrants had been ringed at Ngulia.
Almost 82% comprised Marsh Warblers, Whitethroats and Sprossers
(Thrush Nightingales). Others had included Little Bitterns, an Eleonora's
Falcon, Corncrakes, Eurasian Nightjars, Rufous Bush Chats, Iranias (White-
throated Robins), Nightingales, River Warblers, Spotted Flycatchers and
Red-backed Shrikes.
In the East Africa Natural History Society's Bulletin (November/Dec-
ember, 1985), a correspondent reported how, at dusk on 20th November,
a ringer arrived to join the ringing group at Ngulia, having just seen a flock
of up to 400 Eastern Red-footed Falcons going to roost on trees along a|
nearby road.
The following day a flock of several hundred, with many European!
Rollers, was watched hawking insects, possibly termites. The next day I
several parties of eagles, mainly Lesser Spotted with a few Steppe Eagles
among them, were observed feeding on termites as these emerged from:
their holes. Twenty-nine eagles were counted in one group and the total I
was probably near 40.
Who holds the world record for the most bird species seen in a single
day? In 'News and Views' (Vol. 90,No. 4), Malcolm Ellis reported that
three ornithologists had claimed this record for Kenya, with their tally
of 290 species seen there in one day. This claim was challenged by Greg- j
ory S. Toffic in this column (Vol. 91, No. 3), who stated that this record |
belongs to Ted Parker and Scott Robinson, who identified 331 species in
a day's birding at the Cocha Cashu Biological Station in south-eastern
Peru.
Malcolm Ellis has relayed this information to Terry Stevenson in Kenya J
in the hope that either he or Don Turner will respond to this challenge to
their claim. One which they bettered later in a sponsored count for
charity; on that occasion a team led by Terry Stevenson counted 308
species, but failed to check in on time and the first team to reach Nairobi's j
famous Norfolk Hotel, the team led by Don Turner, logged 304 species.

THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
black and white photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be
used where possible and should be clearly captioned. If authors wish their eventual
return, they must say so when submitting the article and write their name on the
back of each photograph.

By ROGER WILKINSON (Curator of Birds)
and NICK MANNING (Senior Keeper)
In an article in the Avicultural Magazine in 1929, David Seth-Smith
escribed the Sandgrouse thus: 'The Sandgrouse (Pteroclidae), form a
?ry distinct family of game-birds, showing certain affinities to the Pig-
3ns. They are purely terrestrial, possessing very short legs and long
ointed wings, and inhabiting desert countries where they feed upon the
:eds of various grasses and other plants. Their plumage is mostly of a
indy or buff colour, harmonizing with the surroundings in which they
:cur. The tarsi and, in some cases, the toes also, are feathered, They are
lostly migratory and their flight is extremely rapid and powerful. They
3st on the ground, the nest consisting as a rule of a mere scrape in the
tnd, and the eggs, three to a clutch, are smooth and glossy, rounded at
oth ends, with brownish surface spots overlying pale purplish markings
meath the surface of the shell. Both sexes undertake the duties of
icubation, the female sitting by day and the male at night, and the
3ung, which are covered with down and beautifully marked, are reared
a small seeds.
'Pallas's Sandgrouse is one of two species distinguished by the absence
f a hind toe. It occurs in Central Asia and is subject, for some unknown

363 and again in 1888 when great numbers spread over Europe and
ached the western coasts of the British Isles.

122 WILKINSON &amp; MANNING - PALLAS'S SANDGROUSE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998245214285714" page_id="58077856"  page_num="Page 122" year="" vol="">
In April 1985 Chester Zoo received five Pallas's Sandgrouse from Ro
terdam Zoo, Holland. Although imported as unsexed birds it was evider
soon after arrival that these were four males and one female. Followin
quarantine, these were housed in an outside aviary 4.5 x 4.5 x 2.2 n
shared with a pair of Maroon-tailed Conures Pyrrhura melanura. The hire
were provided with a diet of large millet, wheat, poultry breeder/growe
pellets, insectivorous mixture, finely chopped salad and fruit.
Only 16 days after being placed in their new quarters, a Sandgrouse eg
was found on the ground in a corner of the aviary. A slight depression i
the sand indicated a nest scrape but this remained unlined. Two days late
a second egg and on the following day a third egg were found. The first eg
had been removed immediately for artificial incubation but we awaite
completion of the clutch before removing together the second and thii
eggs. The adults showed little interest in the eggs and no attempt at inci
bation.
A second clutch was laid in early July and the eggs were again remove
for artificial incubation. At that time we decided that, should a thii
clutch be laid, we would leave these in situ in the hope that the paren
would show more attention than with the first clutch. However, after tl
first two eggs were soaked following a torrential downpour of rain, w
reversed our decision and removed both eggs to the incubator, the thii
was also removed on the day after laying. The eggs were greenish-grey
colour blotched with brown and the five measured ranged from 43-45 m
I x 32-34 mm.
The subsequent fate of these artificially incubated eggs is tabulate
overleaf; two of three eggs in the first clutch were hatched and successful
reared, two of the second clutch hatched but failed to survive and all thr*
eggs in the third dutch were found to be addled.
The eggs were set (unwashed) in a still air incubator (Brinsea Polyhatcj
at a temperature of 39-39.25*C and a humidity similar to that for incub
ting pheasant eggs. The eggs were turned (automatically) hourly until tl
21st day of incubation when they were removed to a dry hatcher at 38.5 0;
Once the eggs pipped or broke into the air-space, tire humidity was i
creased to a minimum of 60%. Those eggs that hatched did so very rapidl
the process of hatching taking only a few hours.
The calculated incubation period of 25-26 days is less than that of &amp;lt;
days reported for Pallas's Sandgrouse in the wild (Cramp, 1985) or pi
viously in an incubator (Witherby et al, 1940).
The newly-hatched chicks were allowed to remain in the hatcher t
24 hours before being removed to a brooder box. The temperature w
maintained at 35*C for the first three days in the brooder then gradual
lowered over the next few weeks.

rumbs), finely diced carrot and apple, chopped lettuce and grated hard-
oiled egg; small mealworms were also relished. Chick grit was mixed with
le food from the second day and water supplied in a shallow trough. At
our weeks old millet was introduced into the diet, followed by wheat at
ix weeks.
The facial markings of the young male were distinct before he reached
%ree months. The second chick proved to be a female which, when
aired with an adult male in 1986, laid eggs from which two chicks were
atched. One of these, a female, was successfully reared and, with the
oss of one adult male last winter, we now have a group of four males and
Tree females.
Our stock was captive bred at Rotterdam Zoo where Pallas's Sand-
rouse have been bred since 1980. The International Zoo Yearbooks
sport an earlier success in 1979 at East Berlin Zoo but we have been
nable to find any previous records of Pallas's Sandgrouse being bred in
tie United Kingdom.

BREEDING THE COBALT-WINGED PARRAKEET
Brotogeris cyanoptera

Early last year we purchased two of these South American parrakeets
each from different sources. The cock bird was in very good conditior
but the hen, having been kept on seed only, looked very poorly. He
feathers were dull, she was very thin and her beak and claws were ovei
grown. After veterinary treatment and the correct diet of mainly fruit
with Parrot Mix, Budgerigar seed, boiled egg yolk and vegetables, sh
soon recovered.
We considered ourselves very lucky to have purchased a pair of thes
birds, as it is almost impossible to tell their sex by sight, the coloration am
size appearing identical although the yellow on the cock's forehead is per
haps a little brighter. Our birds got on well from the beginning and wen
soon feeding each other.
As we believe in keeping our birds indoors, rather than exposed to a
weathers, we installed the Cobalt-winged Parrakeets in the spare bedroorr
along with a pair of African Greys and a pair of Jardine's Parrots. The

attached to the outside measuring internally 5 x 5 x 8 in (0.13 x 0.13 x
),20 m). The nest-box is not upright but angled at 45*. Peat is used to
ine the bottom and a trap door is cut into the front for inspection.
We were soon rewarded with four eggs and after 30 days, when we
hought that they had gone over their time and all was lost, the first chick
latched on 18th July (1985). We could not believe our luck when the
)ther three hatched during the next few days.
Although the hen appeared to be feeding the chicks well(we added
nore fruit and egg yolk to the diet) we were worried that the last pair
larched would eventually be neglected as these were quite a bit smaller.
We decided, therefore, to take all the chicks and hand-rear them.
They grew very quickly, their eyes opening at about 10 days, and
he quills soon appeared under the skin. The rearing food consisted of
)aby food (Milupa Winter Vegetables), Heinze baby pure fruit, shelled
[sunflower seeds, and calcium tablets with vitamin D. All this is put in
he liquidiser with boiled water and mixed to a not-too-runny consis-
ency.
I They had been kept in a temperature of 80* F, which was lowered
gradually over a few days when they were fully feathered. They began
0 eat fruit on their own and managed to demolish whole apples, which
lad been sliced, leaving just the skin. They eventually ate seed as well
! but still preferred the fruit.
Since then we have had a few failures with clear eggs, or fertile eggs
lot hatching, but another chick was hatched on 13th October 1985,
i which was hand-reared and at the moment (July 1986) we have three
J nore chicks who have just left the brooder and are flying but refuse
to eat on their own, so we are quite pleased with the number we have
reared and hope that our pair of Cobalt-winged Parrakeets will go on
laying and producing such delightful little birds.

SOME NOTES ON BIRD MARKETS, PIGEON KEEPING
AND OTHER BIRD/MAN RELATIONS IN CHINA

(Natural History Unit, B.B.C., Bristol)
These notes are concerned mainly with bird markets in the People&amp;apos;s
Republic of China, but will embrace one or two other aspects of mar
bringing birds into captivity: pigeon racing, the pigeon fancy, pigeor
whistles, cormorant fishing, and birds in traditional medicine.
In an earlier issue of the AviculturalMagazine I published an article or
birds in Chengdu Zoo (Boswall, 1986).
The only recently published article that I know of which deals with
Chinese aviculture as such is that of Travnicek (1986), a United States
aviculturist who toured five major cities in mainland China and visitec
bird markets, pet shops and zoos. He presents much interesting infor
mation.
The bird names in this paper are mainly those of Meyer de Schauensee
(1984).
Bird markets in Beijing
So many earlier writers on Chinese ornithology (notably Wilder anc
Hubbard, 1924) quote from their visits to Chinese bird markets that ir
1983 I sought out the largest of the three markets known to be in Bei
jing. It was at Guan Yuan. Unfortunately I could spend only 10 minute:;
there on 2nd May, but was able to identify Budgerigar Melopsittacu
undulatus, Canary Serinus canaria. Red-billed Ueiothrix or Peking Robiri

possible exception of the Quails, of which there were five adults and five
halfgrown young ones, and perhaps the 11 Peking Robins, all the othe:
birds were almost certainly wild-taken.

951), plus the fact that there were none in the market on 2nd May, can
e taken as indicating that a number of species are not only wild caught
ut recently caught. It also seems probable that most are locally caught,
ositive exceptions being only the Hwamei (or Brown Laughingthrush)
arrulax canorus (two birds), the Mongolian Lark (17 adults, c. 40 nest-
L ngs) and (if wild caught) the Peking Robins. These species do not occur
aturally in the vicinity of Beijing.
The number of other species were: four Coal Tits Parus ater six prob-
ble Marsh Tits, one possible Willow Tit P. montanus, one Great Tit
major, 29 Eurasian Siskins, 18 Yellow-billed Hawfinches (also known as
lack-tailed Hawfinches) Eophona migratoria, 23 Hawfinches, two Shore

even unidentified Fringillids, and one other unidentified passerine.
Anthony Galsworthy, on a visit to the same market the next day,
:2nd May, recorded the following less usual species: White-throated
lock Thrush Monticola gularis, Blue Rock Thrush M. solitarius philip-
ensis, Pere David's Laughingthrush (or Peking Hill Babbler) Garrulax

iparently more cage bird enthusiasts appear than on the other days of
le week.
On 21st May, 30 yuan (then about #10) was asked for a Hwamei, and
0 yuan for a Mongolian Lark. These two species are the first and second
lost popular native cage birds in China. A Yellow-billed Hawfinch cost
yuan and a Brown Shrike or a bunting Vi yuan.
Most birds were displayed in cages, usually rather small, sometimes
yercrowded. A few individuals (often hawfinches) had string halters
id were tethered to a stick. One stall-holder had tied together with a
iece of string the wings of each of his birds. The knot was across the tips
f the primaries. Another had taped the beaks of several hawfinches.

spent an hour counting the birds in the same market. Setting aside th
domestic Common Quail, there were 431 birds of 39 species (33 of whicl
were specifically identified). Sixty-five (15%) were Budgerigars, 57 (13%
were Zebra Finches Taeniophgia guttata, 51(12%) were Hwameis, 4
(11%) were Mongolian Larks, 28 (6%) 'other' larks, and 38 (9%) wer^
Canaries. There were only 11 (2.5%) Chestnut-flanked White-eyes Zoi
terops erythropleura, 11 (2.5%) Peking Robins and 6 (1.5%) parrots.
Such a market as this merits a detailed study, since data of season^
occurrence and breeding season can be inferred - see McClure and Char
yaphun (1971) who undertook systematic censuses at the Bangkok bir
market in Thailand.
The two smaller bird markets in Beijing are at Longtang Hu an
Qiaoyang Men.
The only other recent observations I know of are those of Travnice
(1986), Fiebig (1983) who lists 36 species in a Beijing bird market, an
Beecroft (in press) who visited three or four bird markets in China. Earlie
Wilder and Hubbard (1924) often cited records of birds in markets to hel
assess passage periods and relative abundance.
I am indebted to Anthony Galsworthy for the following note on th
effects of the Cultural Revolution on bird markets. He writes: 'So far #

Seller with Azure-winged Magpie Cyanopica cyana
know the bird markets in Peking disappeared in about 1966, and only
estarted in the mid-seventies. During the Cultural Revolution any hobby
r other activity which detracted from a rigid attention to politics was
rowned on. I can recall newspaper criticism of 'the evil wind of goldfish
taring' and 'the evil wind of pigeon fancying'. It seems unlikely that the
earing of cage birds fared any better, although some people must have
ontinued in what little privacy then remained in their own homes. At the
ame time the habit of attaching whistles to domestic pigeons disap-
eared - from 1968 to 1972 I never heard pigeon whistles in Peking. They
re now common again: a flight of pigeons with whistles, sounding like
n attacking Stuka, often causes consternation as it passes over the British
jkmbassy tennis courts! Pigeon whistles can now be bought again at bird
larkets, and are being manufactured again in the traditional way.' Pigeon
i /histles are dealt with later in this article.
Chengdu , Sichuan, bird markets
On Sunday, 18th May 1986, I went to the larger of two Chengdu bird
larkets - the one at Qingyanggong. With the aid of William W. Thomas I
ttempted a census of all the birds present.
Of the 22 species on offer, one was presumably for food - the domestic

Quail. So too may have been the single pigeon Columba livid. (There is a
quite separate and equally crowded pigeon market in Chengdu at which
both fancy birds and racers are sold). The young Northern Goshawk
Accipiter gentilis was unlikely to be on sale for falconry purposes; more
likely it was on offer as a source of traditional medicine. My enquiries
about falconry in Sichuan proved negative. Elsewhere in China, e.g. in
Inner Mongolia and Sinkiang, there is reason to believe that this practice is
extant. See also under 'Bird Trapping' below.
The remaining 19 species were traditional 'cagebirds', i.e. musical song-
sters, likely talkers and those of ornamental appearance.
Among those valued for their song, the Hwamei or Brown Laughing-
thrush was easily the most common, 186 individuals being on display,
comprising 38% of the total of 487 individuals of 19 species of'cagebird'.
The species has a loud and tuneful song. So does the Mongolian Lark, but
only three individuals of this non-local species were on offer. However, of
the Oriental Skylark Alauda gulgula, which nests, for example, on the
Chengdu airport, there were for sale two adults and 20 nearly full-grown
nestlings.
Of species likely to copy human speech, there were only two, both
parrots. There were two Slaty-headed Parrakeets Psittacula himalayana
fischii and 44 Earl of Derby's Parrakeets Psittacula derbiana. Thus, parrots
were 9% of the total.
Certain species are pleasing to both ear and eye, like the Red-spotted
Bluethroat (an adult and two apparent youngsters were present) and
others to the eye like the Peking Robin (71 birds, 15%).
Seedeaters included 17 Grey-capped Greenfinches Carduelis sinicd
(3%), one Black-headed Greenfinch Carduelis ambigua , two nestling Eurai
sian Tree Sparrows, one Russett Sparrow Passer rutilans , two Yellow
billed Hawfinches and four Rosefinches (including one cock) not cer
tainly identified as to species but probably Common Rosefinches Carper
dacus erythrinus.
This leaves, among the indigenous birds only a Brown Shrike Lanim
cristatus , two Striated Munias Munia striata , 29 Chestnut-flanked White
eyes (6%) and an unidentified nestling, probably a Magpie Robin Copsy
chus saularis.
Exotics were 62 Canaries (13%) (all yellow or yellowish apart from twq
reddish ones and a dozen white ones), and 34 Budgerigars (7%) (twe
white, seven blue, seven green and 18 yellow).
To sum up, there were 487 birds of 19 'cage bird' species at this
Chengdu market, plus 102 birds of three other species (Coturnix, Colum
ba , Accipiter). The most common cage birds were the Hwamei, 38%, the
Peking Robin, 15%; the Canary, 13%; the two larger parrots, 9% together

William W. Thomas had earlier visited this market six times, first on
4th October 1985 and then at monthly intervals on average. The following
list is of the 21 species he saw, additional to those present on 18th May,
the first two being raptors, the second two of possibly domestic origin and
the rest conventional 'cage birds':-

The smaller bird market in Chengdu is at Qinchengshan. During th
same winter, 1985-86, William W. Thomas saw there about 10 specie
additional to those at the larger market.
A paperback volume on aviculture (Yi, 1982) was one of only tw
books on birds that could be found in a large specialist bookshop i
Changchun. It is called The Breeding of Fancy Birds , and 54,000 copie
were produced. Illustrations make clear how to catch wild stock. Else

where in China I later found the following books: The Avoidance and
Cure of Bird Diseases by Xing Chao'an and Yan Zhengfan (1985), of
which 10,000 copies were printed; also The Care and Training of Larks
edited by Zhang Xiaosi (1984), 15,500 copies; and The Keeping and
Breeding of Cage Birds by Lu Jiechuan and others (1984), 29,000 copies.
Birds trained to do tricks
Anthony Galsworthy observed birds at the main Beijing market being
used to perform tricks (1983, pers. comm.). He writes: 'On 22nd May
1983, Ken Searle and I watched a Chinese doing tricks with hawfinches
as described in Hemmingsen (1951). He had about three of the Japanese
(or Masked) Hawfinches, all males, tied with strings round their breasts,
with clips. He released one bird onto his hand, then with the other hand
threw a small white ball high in the air, simultaneously throwing the bird
in the air. As the bird flew up to catch the first ball he threw the second
after it. The bird on each occasion I watched, caught both and returned
to his hand, depositing the balls in his palm. It was rewarded with a seed.
A second man had a male Brambling which was similarly trained; but on
this occasion it caught a seed thrown in the air, rather than a ball, and
returned to the hand.'

Bird trapping
To supply the markets birds must be trapped or otherwise 'taken' in
:he wild. Hemmingsen (1951) deals with trapping in the 1940s and more
ecently Beecroft (in press) gives a valuable account of trapping over two
ind a half months in 1985 at a locality on the Yellow Sea coast.
I can add only the following:

William W. Thomas (1983, pers. comm.) writes of his stay in Beijing in
the late 1970s: 'There were a number of bird-trappers who worked the
brush around the Ming Tombs Reservoir, usually with mist nets. Their
usual game included several species of Parus and Emberiza, Phylloscopus
and Aegithalos. The nets were tended very carefully, and some of the
trappers wanted their birds alive. Others killed them as soon as they were
free of the net, presumably for food. There were also hunters using ail
guns and even ancient muzzle-loaders, but they were after ducks and
shorebirds. I once saw a peasant carrying a large female Northern Goshawk
Accipiter gentilis which he used against quail and thrushes.' (Hemmingsen,
1951, mentions the netting of Northern Goshawks for use against hares).
In the grounds of my hotel at Qiqihar, Heilongjiang province, on 8th
May 1983, I (J.B.) found a local bird-catcher with six traps slung from a
tree. In a bottom compartment each contained a decoy Eurasian Siskin.
A supply of millet was positioned so as to be available not only to the call
bird but also to potential victims, four of which could be caught in separate
traps above. See Caroline Weaver's photograph.
Cormoran t fish ing
As recently as 1982 the use of Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo
for fishing was observed near Beijing; on at least two occasions Anthony
Galsworthy saw one or two boats, each with one or two fishermen, opera-
ting on the canal that runs alongside the 'back' road to the Summer Palace.
The site was 1-2 kms before the Palace. In May 1985, D.S. Melville saw
several rafts with captive Cormorants near Guangzhou (Canton). In May
and June 1986, I saw Cormorant fishing in progress at two widely separa-
ted localities, each about an hour's drive from Chengdu. Maryse Addison
(pers. comm. 1986) saw a recent film about Cormorant fishing shot on
Hainan Island. It would seem from these instances alone that Cormorant
fishing, despite rumours to the contrary, is still widespread in China. A
recent account of this behaviour in Guilin in China is that of Egremont
and Rothschild (1979). One feature is a possible example of counting
ability in birds. After a bird has brought seven fish to its owner, the bird
is allowed to eat the eighth. The bird apparently 'goes on strike', refusing
to move, unless it is fed every eighth fish.
Cheng (1937) traces Cormorant fishing in China back to 317 BC, earlier
than the earliest dates given by Campbell and Lack (1985), i.e. the Sung
dynasty (960-1298 AD). But Zhang (1985) is surely mistaken in stating
that Cormorants trained in China to catch fish 'are not bred in captivity'.
At a location in Sichuan I was told by a Cormorant fisherman that the eggs
laid by his birds were hatched out under hens and the resulting young
raised by human hand. The widespread incidence of albino and semi-

albino birds is also highly suggestive of domestication. For example, of the;
15 birds owned by my interviewee, one was a complete albino and two;
more were partly white. Of course, it is no doubt also true that from time
to time new stock is trapped in the wild and brought into captivity. I was
told that Cormorants live for 20 years, and that mature birds sell for
400-500 yuan (#90 - #115 in October 1985), and young birds for 100-
200 yuan (#23 - #45).

The only large Chinese cities in which I have spent significant periods
of time are Beijing and Chengdu. The most conspicuous birds by far are
Rock Doves Columba livid, but they are birds from owners' lofts and not
feral 'street' pigeons. Not once did I see, in either city, a pigeon on the
ground in park or town square, garden or roadside patch. And yet high;
above, flocks of birds are continually on the move.
The racing of pigeons is a common sport, and pigeons are also bred for 1
eggs and meat.
On 1st October 1985, I visited a pigeon market in Chengdu, the capital
city of Sichuan province. The majority of the hundred or so boxes or
cages that had been brought contained homers. I was told that in Sichuan,
one of 26 Chinese provinces, albeit the second largest, there were 8,000
members of the pigeon association, with 2,000 in Chengdu alone.
'Ordinary' pigeons were selling for 6 yuan (about #1.25), those with
experience over 500 km courses for 10-20 yuan (about #2-#4), 1,000 km
birds for 200-500 yuan (about #40-#100) and 2,000 km birds (that, for
example, home 1,400 km from Inner Mongolia to Chengdu in two days)
for 500-2,000 yuan (about #100-#400). In fact, there was only one bird in
Chengdu worth 2,000 yuan.
At the other extreme, pigeons to eat cost 2-3 yuan each!
Also for sale were three different pigeon magazines, each a monthly,
and five different pigeon paperbacks; also serially numbered rings, of
course, and magnifying glasses for inspecting pigeons' eyes.
Of particular interest were the pigeon whistles. These are attached in
an upright position to the tail of a pigeon, and when the bird takes off
air passes into the forward facing orifice and a pleasing note is struck.
Nowadays only a few whistles are made of bamboo and gourds - in Cheng-
du, at least. Instead they are fashioned from nut husks or plastic. One
common design employs a table tennis ball! Before selling a whistle the
stall holder insists on a demonstration of the instrument's musicality. He
attaches the whistle to one end of a specially designed stick nearly a metre
in length and then spins the stick from the other end.
A whistle may be a single sound producer, or more likely a combina-

m Li-ch'en (1936). Drawings (a) and (a 1 ) are the side and front views of the same

id bamboo (the original caption says merely 'bamboo'), and each weighs 10 grams,
/hen the pigeons wheel overhead their sound rises even to the clouds, containing
ithin it all five notes (of the Chinese scale). Truly it gives joy, and a release to the
notions!' (Tun Li-ch'en, 1936, Annual Customs and Festivals in Peking , p. 22).

tion of up to 19 'pipes'. Laufer (1934) wrote about, and illustrated, the
collection of Chinese bird whistles held in the Field Museum of Natural
History in Chicago. It is clear that some of the compound whistles are of
intricate and beautiful design, and no doubt produce a pleasing combina-
tion of notes. Imagine a flock taking off each bird carrying a compound
whistle! In fact, I have heard these flying orchestras at two widely separa-
ted locations in Sichuan province and in Beijing.
A Beijing collector of these whistles has written about their history and
craftsmanship (Wang, 1963). He had over 300 examples, including many
contemporary ones, but also some from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912).
But he had none from the time of the Song dynasty (1127-1279) when the
craft was already thriving. The custom is said to have originated in the
Tang dynasty (618-907).
Tun Li-ch'en wrote in 1900 about pigeon whistles in Peking and illus-
trated two of them (see figure3) (Tun, 1965).
Yu (1956) has written about the fancy breeds of pigeon favoured in
Beijing in the early 1950s. Earlier, in 1900, Tun Li-ch'en had listed 13|
'ordinary varieties' of pigeon by name (e.g. 'Phoenix-headed white' and
'Taoist priest hat') and 23 of 'valuable varieties' (e.g. 'Wild duck of the
Great Dipper' and 'Striped sandals').

October 1985 and two in May/June 1986 showed skins of the following
species for sale (usually only one or two of each, but nine Common

Only the heads and toes are sold. A boy offered me a whole, freshly dead
buzzard for 20 yuan (about #4.60 in October 1985) or toes at 1.50 yuan
(about #0.35) each. By comparison with the sale of botanical, reptilian
and mammalian items, avian 'parts' appeared to be in very little demand.
Even so, there could be a deleterious effect on wild populations.

It appears that the heads and toes of raptors are boiled in water and the
resulting soup is drunk. As to the ailments supposedly cured or relieved,
die claims are so wide-ranging as to create suspicion about their validity.
The Northern Goshawk, Tawny Eagle and Black Kite for sale alive in
;he Chengdu bird market (see earlier) are believed to have been on sale for
heir medicinal value.

The Crimson Finch Neochmia phaeton is one of the most beautiful of
the Australian estrildid finches. The male is predominantly blood red to
crimson in colour and, although the female is browner and less bright, she
too is an attractive bird. It is certainly a desirable species for aviculture
but has a reputation of being difficult to keep and breed. Not surprisingly
perhaps, it is scarce in Europe and relatively expensive to buy. A pair of
Crimson Finches was worth about #135 in the U.K. in 1982, compared
with #30 for a pair of Longtail Finches Poephila acuticauda and #35 for a
pair of Gouldian Finches Chloebia gouldiae (Evans and Fidler, 1986).
Crimson Finches are much less expensive in Australia, however, where in
1982 prices varied from about #16 to #20 per pair (Evans and Fidler, loc.
cit.). This difference can, however, be attributed to the availability of wild-
caught Crimson Finches in that country. The Australian Government
banned the export of finches, and all other native fauna, to other parts of
the world under its Prohibited Exports Regulations in the early 1960s.
Consequently, only domestically-bred birds are now available outside
Australia. Some licenced finch-trapping continues nevertheless for the
Australian cage bird market which is centred on the town of Wyndham,
in the Kimberley region of north-west Australia. The trade is a dying one
because the Western Australia wildlife authority, which controls it, has
adopted a policy whereby it will renew licences for existing trappers, but
will not issue them to new applicants. The numbers of trappers have,
therefore, dwindled from 55 operating in the Kimberley in 1958(Immel-
mann, 1965) to nine by 1982 (Evans and Fidler, loc. cit.).
Difficulties in establishing the Crimson Finch in captivity are usually
attributed to its aggressiveness. Immelmann (1965) describes how trucu-
lent encounters frequently occur between individuals which come close
to one another under natural conditions, and Blewett &amp; Kroyer-Pedersen
(1978) suggest that members of this species are so aggressive in captivity
that successful breeding can be achieved only by isolating pairs in separate
flights. Even then, there may be problems. Some males repeatedly chase

their mates, driving them from the nest, and, in extreme cases, they may
actually kill them (Immelmann, 1965). We believe, however, that the case
against the Crimson Finch has been overstated. It is undoubtedly aggres.
sive in some circumstances, but we present evidence from two sources
which suggest that this is less of a problem than is usually supposed. The
first arises from field observations of wild birds made by the authors in
the Kimberley. The second comes from discussions with Mr and Mrs Huge
Austla who use the colony system for breeding Crimson Finches in aviaries
at Wyndham (W.A.).
Field observations
The Crimson Finch occurs across most of northern Australia and alsc
inhabits southern parts of New Guinea (Blakers, Davies and Reilly, 1984).
It is usually seen near surface water where there are groups of the palm
Pandanus odoratissimus . Observations described in this paper were made al
pools of these kinds along otherwise dry creeks in areas adjacent to the
Wyndhaim-Kununurra and Wyndham-Gibb River roads in the eastern and
central Kimberley. The study was made in July and August 1985.
Crimson Finches were almost always seen in groups and each of these
evidently lived in more-or-less permanent association with a particular poo]
and its pandanus. What were almost certainly the same birds could be ob-
served regularly at, or close to, the 'home' site. These birds had probably
nested in the pandanus during the previous wet season because we found
'used' Crimson Finch nests at several of the study sites. They were usually
positioned near the bases of the pandanus leaves. Overall, observations
were made of 15 groups of Crimson Finches; their mean size was 13.2
(standard deviation, 6.4). Each group included some adult males in fuf
nuptial plumage, some adult females and some immature birds; the latter
were either still in juvenile plumage or in the process of moulting out of it.
Members of the groups roosted in the pandanus at night and also spem
much of the day perched in them. They foraged together in the adjacen
areas (i.e. usually within about 200-400 m).
Most feeding activity was confined to dense, long grass and individua
birds were difficult to observe in it for longer than a few minutes. It waf
evident, nevertheless, that they foraged together as a flock, moving in the
same general direction and maintaining individual distances of about 1 m
Crimson Finches are extremely agile climbers, using long tails as balancing
organs, and perching confidently on either vertical or horizontal stems, ir
order to take seeds from grass panicles. According to Immelmann (1965).;
members of this species do not normally feed on the ground but they were
often observed doing so during the present study; they were apparently
searching for fallen seeds in the soil between tussocks of grass. They alsd

)raged on the ground in recently burnt areas. There was little aggression
etween members of foraging groups. Supplanting attacks were sometimes
bserved, usually by adult males towards other birds, but they were mild
ad never resulted in prolonged chases. Males in full nuptial plumage often
erched or foraged close to one another (i.e. about 0.5 m apart) without
liciting hostile reactions.
Members of foraging groups responded to a sudden disturbance, such as
rat caused by the approach of the observer, by flying-up from the
round. If they were close to the pandanus (i.e. within approximately
0 m), they flew back to them, retreating deep into the palms, and usually
gaining out of sight for several minutes. Members of groups, which were
lore distant from the pandanus when they were disturbed, flew into
earby trees, often flying in different directions and thereby becoming
sparated from one another. They subsequently regrouped by flying down
o start foraging together as a flock. Loud contact calls were made by
inches flying from one place to another, including flying down to forage,
nd probably function in keeping members of the group together.
Aviary notes
Hugo and Bev. Austla breed finches in semi-enclosed outdoor aviaries,
&amp;apos;hey concentrate their efforts on Gouldian Finches Chloebia gouldiae but
:eep several other Australian estrildid finches, including the Crimson
&amp;apos;inch. Since their captive birds are subjected to similar climatic regimes of
emperature, humidity and day length as those living under natural con-
ditions, it is not surprising that they show the same seasonal patterns of
ictivity. Crimson Finches, for instance, come into breeding condition
luring the wet season (January-February) both in the Austlas' aviaries and
b the wild. They stop breeding from the middle of the dry season onwards
about June).
Mr and Mrs Austla provide Crimson Finches with a standard feed mix,
onsisting of pannicum millet (3 parts), canary seed (1 part), white millet
1 part) and Japanese millet (1 part). They also receive regular supplies of
;reen grass leaves, and when in season, seeding grasses. A complex soft
&amp;apos;ood mix, which is made from the following ingredients, is provided on a
laily basis throughout the year:
12 boiled eggs, including their shells
Two dessertspoons of a commercial vitamin/mineral salts preparation
Two ounces of another commercial vitamin preparation
a
Four dessertspoons of skimmed powder milk
One tablespoon of table salt
Four dessertspoons of honey

Eight ounces of apple juice
Eight dessertspoons of meat meal
One cup of water
This mixture is homogenised in a food processor and then mixed with
equal quantities of commercial biscuit mix and boiled seed mix.
Birds are bred in communal aviaries and, in the case of Crimson Finches
as many as 15 pairs are caged together in flights measuring 4 (long) x 2
(wide) x 2 (high) m. They are provided with standard woven-baskets and
open-fronted wooden (15x15x15 cm) nest-boxes. Some nesting materials,
such as grass stems and coconut fibre, are placed in each box but the birds
carry further materials to the nest, often preferring green grass. Individuals
become aggressive as breeding activities commence but not enough to
cause serious problems. They are relatively placid once nesting is underway.
Young remain in the same flight as the parents until they are no longer fed
by them.
Good pairs of Crimson Finches rear three broods in succession but
never rear more than four per nest. Overall, the Austlas expect to rear
about 80-100 young from 30 pairs caged in the two flights (averaging
about three young per pair).
Mr. and Mrs. Austla carried out an experiment in 1984 which empha-
sises the success of colony breeding and even suggests that Crimson Fin-
ches breed more effectively when they are caged in groups than when they
are kept as isolated pairs.
Three flights, each measuring 2 x 1 x 2 m, were stocked with one, two
and three pairs of adult Crimson Finches respectively, and the birds were
left in them for the entire breeding season. The total numbers of young
reared in each flight were as follows:

Crimson Finches are undoubtedly less aggressive than has been reported
in previous studies, at least under the circumstances described in the
present account. They occur in social groups in the non-breeding season
and the behaviour within them is similar to that described in flocks of
other estrildid finches by Evans (1970, 1972) and Evans and Patterson
(1971); the movements of individuals in groups are co-ordinated and they
are relatively unaggressive towards one another. Similarly, Crimson
Finches can be caged together in groups in captivity and will even breed

uccessfully in colonies which are confined in relatively small aviaries.
Further studies are needed to explain the discrepancies between the
&gt;resent findings and previous accounts. One possibility is that the groups
)bserved by us were kin groups (i.e. consisted of closely related indi-
iduals). Indeed, this certainly is true to at least some extent. Groups
ilmost certainly consisted of birds (and their young) which had bred in
he 'home' pandanus during the previous wet season. One would expect
elatively little hostility between members of kin groups but much more
iggression between unrelated and unfamiliar individuals. It may be,
herefore, that high levels of aggression occur in the wild and in captivity
vhen unfamiliar birds encounter one another, and that previous accounts

INCREASED REPRODUCTION IN A PAIR OF BARN OWLS

AT THE CINCINNATI ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS

(Head Keeper, Nocturnal Animal House)
Early in 1980, a new display was completed in the Cincinnati Zoo's
Nocturnal House that was to be a permanent enclosure for the exhibition
of an avian species. Since its remodelling in the mid-1960s, the Nocturnal
House has displayed only mammals. A room 8 ft wide by 12 ft long and
12 ft high (2.44 x 3.66 x 3.66 m) was converted to resemble the inside of
an old barn. It was constructed of authentic barn wood and furnished
with a hay loft area, bales of straw, old farming tools, as well as some
horse tack, the intention being to display Barn Owls in a natural setting.
The exhibit was housed indoors only, allowing greater control of such
variables as temperature and photo-period. The exhibit temperature
fluctuated between 65-75*F (18-24*C) and the birds were kept under a
year-round 12-hour day/12-hour night cycle. From about 10:00 hours to
22:00, tire display was illuminated by a 4 ft (1.28 m) blue fluorescent
strip light. In the remaining hours, the birds were under the lighting of a
4 ft white fluorescent strip light.
Though the Barn Owl is considered to be one of the most widely
spread species of owls found today (with subspecies found on all con-
tinents except Antarctica), there was more difficulty in procuring these
birds than was anticipated. Even though they are distributed over such
an enormous area, in many geographical regions they are rare. Much of
this rarity is caused by the destruction of many man-made structures such
as barns, old churches, derelict buildings, etc. which, over the centuries,
the owls have adopted as prime nesting sites. Also, due to modernised
farming methods, many owl species find it increasingly difficult to locate
food in the form of rodents which were once numerous among the far-
mers' field and grain storage bins.
In the wild, Barn Owls are reported to have a single clutch of eggs
annually with a second clutch occurring during times of food abundance
(Sparks, et al, 1979). One to 13 eggs have been reported, with the average
brood size being four to five. Incubation lasts 30-32 days and the eggs,
which are laid on alternate days, also hatch on this two-day pattern. This
may act as an evolutionary advantage for the species as a whole, for
should food supplies become scarce, cannibalism of the younger chicks

Dy the older ones will sometimes occur. This will result in the older
chick(s) surviving longer and will also reduce the total amount of food that
the parents need to bring back to the nest.
On 27th March, 1980, we obtained the first owl for the exhibit - a
wild-caught bird estimated to be about six months old. It came from
the Riverbanks Zoo, South Carolina, and was followed, on the next day,
by the arrival of two more owls. These were also wild-caught and were
sent from the Department of Wildlife in Louisiana who estimated their
ages at four months. All of these birds had adult plumage and were placed
together in the newly-completed exhibit on 5th April, 1980.
In early March 1981, two of the birds began a constant squabbling,
with the same bird always being the aggressor. The two problem birds
were the ones received from Louisiana. It was assumed that the problem
was related to an imbalance of sexes in the enclosure so the three birds
were surgically sexed.
Many individuals feel that Barn Owls can be correctly sexed by a
difference in coloration. However, it was felt that the surgical sexing
method was more reliable than colour variations for proper sexing of
these birds and it was therefore the chosen method.
The Louisiana birds were both males and were probably fighting over
the attentions of the South Carolina bird which was a female. Now that
proper sexing had been achieved, the female and the 'alpha' male were
returned to the exhibit. Approximately one month later, the female was
found to be sitting on her first egg. No real nest was made; it was merely
an indentation in a bale of straw located in the hay loft area several
Teet above the exhibit floor. The female defended the nest readily by
spreading her wings and rocking back and forth while vocalising (a hissing,
screeching scream). Several more eggs were laid, each at two day intervals.
On the morning of 2nd August, 1981, 30 days after the discovery of
the first egg, broken egg shells were found on the floor directly below the
nest site. Though the mother guarded it fiercely, it was possible to catch
a glimpse of a newly-hatched chick. The male was not removed from the
exhibit but became excitable when the enclosure was entered. The pair
successfully reared two young. By the time they were one month old, the
i young could only be distinguished from their parents by being slightly

Exactly 30 days after the hatching of her first chick, the female,
while still in the company of her month-old chicks, began to lay again.
Thirty days after laying had started, the first egg of her second clutch
batched. It was known that her previous clutch had consisted of more than
two eggs and we wondered whether only two young were eventually
reared because of the quantity of food provided. As the second clutch

began hatching, the quantity and contents of the diet being offered tc
the adults was increased. The diet (per bird) of two beef heart strips, twc
chicken necks (skin removed) and three ounces of Nebraska Brand Bird ol
Prey Diet was doubled. Freshly killed mice (2-10 per day, depending on
the previous day's consumption) were added to the diet. The mice were
the preferred food, followed by beef heart, chicken necks and bird ol
prey diet.
Five young were successfully fledged this time and the cycle began tc
repeat. To date, this single pair has produced young in February, July and
December 1982, April, August and December 1983, March, July and
October 1984, January, May, August and September of 1985, and May
and September of 1986 to add to the seven chicks produced in 1981. This
pair is currently sitting again with a clutch of eggs which should begin
hatching at the end of this month (November). In all, some 70 young
have been successfully hatched and reared by this pair with several of the
nesting sites occurring on the floor of the exhibit in plain view of the
public. The male has never been removed from the exhibit and on many
occasions has been observed bringing food to the nest site and, as the
young grew older, he would assist with their feeding.
Some of these Barn Owl progeny have been sent to various zoos and
nature centres for public display. The great majority, however, have been
released in south-western Ohio and south-eastern Indiana. There is hope
that the numbers of Barn Owls in the wild will begin to increase in areas
where these birds were once plentiful but are now scarce.
In conclusion, there are probably several factors involved in the reason
why our Barn Owls have been so reproductively active. Some of these may
include: an enclosure which is similar to the habitat that these birds
would seek in the wild; an abundance and variety of food; a temperature|
range suitable to the animals and/or a lighting schedule in which the birds
cannot distinguish a seasonal change in the photo-period.

The Southern Lapwing Vanellus chilensis is 33 cm long and weighs
bout 235 g. It has red eyes and a black forehead, breast and external
limiges. The back is iridescent greenish grey and the belly white. The
lack tail is short, with white base and tip. The pink bill is tipped black
nd the legs are long and reddish pink. Filiform feathers stick out behind
le head. There is a scapular spur.
This lapwing is a very aggressive bird, inhabiting open, surburban areas
&amp;apos;here fields have been ploughed for agriculture and where there are ex-
msive lawns or football fields. More rarely, they are found in sugar cane
ields soon after they have been ploughed or when cane is growing.
Although it is a bird that uses areas cleared by humans, it is wary. It is
xpert at concealing its intentions, and while watching for intruders and
redators, it preens its feathers calmly and slowly, elegantly, stopping to
eck the ground once in a while, gradually and surely moving away from
ny possible source of danger. In this way, it is very difficult to find its
est except by watching the behaviour of the adults.
The observations here reported refer to five nests found between
3rd July 1982 and 18th November 1983. There is at least one breeding
air on the University campus of Rio Claro, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, and
leir breeding could be followed year by year.
Method of watching the nest
Because these birds are very wary of people, their nests and nesting
ehaviour were studied from within a car parked 80 m from the nest. Birds
lowed disturbance and left the nest if I sat outside the car or if someone
pproached the car.
Breeding season
In the Rio Claro region, nests of Vanellus chilensis were found from

Nests and location

All nests were found in extensive open grassy fields such as a football
field, a ploughed area for rice plantation or in the open part of a sugai
cane field where plants were about 30 cm tall.
The nest is in a depression in the ground, with few grass stems or roots
for lining. Two nests had external diameters of 12.5 cm and 23.0 cm
internal diameters of 9 cm and 11 cm; the depth was 1.5 cm.
Clutch size, eggs and incubation
Clutch size was four eggs for one nest and three eggs for four nests
Average weight for 16 eggs was 23.1 g (range 22.1-25.0 g) and average eg;
measurements were 44.6 x 32.6 mm (range 41.5-48.0; 31.5-34.0 mm).Egg
were laid two days apart in one case, and had a grey-green backgroum
with black spots scattered all over but concentrated at the large end. The;
became rather dirty with reddish mud while incubation progressed, whicl
made them difficult to find. They are rather pointed at one end and a]
eggs are placed with this end toward the centre of the nest during incuba
tion.
Incubation sessions are very short, probably because of the wariness o
the adults and the number of people walking through the campus. I wa
surprised that the pair was able to hatch all four eggs of the first elute
even with the disturbance. The shortest incubation session was two minute
and the longest 85 (average 22.4 min.). On 11th November 1982, fror
14:10 to 18:10, the average incubation session was 12.5 minutes (rang
2-45 minutes).
Just before sitting for a session, the arriving adult turns the eggs. A
intervals during incubation, the adult stands up on the nest and turns th
eggs with its bill, then sits down again. These movements are more con
mon closer to hatching. Sometimes, the incubating bird half stands an
preens the breast, wings and back diligently.
In the nest on the football field, a worker said there had been tw
eggs on 23rd July and four eggs on 26th July. If so, the incubation perio
for this nest should have been 24 or so days. The first egg hatched i
about 10:07 on 17th August, and the last chick emerged on 18th August.
Behaviour while nesting
Both adults are extremely aggressive during their nesting period. The
have the habit of rapidly lowering the body, as if incubating, in the middj
of grass. If their nest is located and one tries to get the eggs for measun
ments, both adults call loudly, fly around the observer, and finally di\
past very rapidly and give a buzzy vocalisation just before striking tf
observer with a wing spur.

When one approaches a nest with an incubating adult, it may stand
&amp;apos;hen one is about 10 m away and walk slowly away with large strides.
,dults at the nest in the sugar cane field were more wary, rising when I
; as 150 m away. When far from the nest, the adult flies calling loudly and
ringing up its calling mate. At another nest, the sitting adult stood up and
ew toward us when we were 7 m away from the nest.
All the time the observer was handling eggs for weighing and measuring,
le adults flew around yelling loudly. Ten minutes or so after the observer
&amp;apos;ent away, the adult walked toward the nest, moved 8 m away and
reened the breast a little and walked back to the nest. Finally, it sat on
.le nest, pecking the ground twice.
Changeover of adults on the nest was rather interesting, being syn-
hronised. One adult walked up slowly, the bird on the nest stood up,
ecked around the nest a lot as if foraging and moved away in the opposite
irection while the other approached from behind. The departing bird
ever looked back and moved slowly away while the second approached
lie nest, looked in the nest and sat. Some 10 m from the nest, the depart-
lg bird stopped, pecked on the ground, preened the head with one food
nd moved a little, stopped, looked and pecked the ground now and then.

t usually went to the edge of the hill below the nearby eucalyptus plan-
ation. There it preened its left wing with its bill, shook its wings a little
nd moved downhill while the other remained immobile on the nest.
On 13th August 1982 at 17:23, one bird came flying down and its
rate, which had been sitting on the nest, stood up. The newly-arrived
&gt;ird gave faint uau, uau calls and had wings well open when it landed, but
he other had the wings half open. Soon both closed their wings. The
iewcomer examined the nest and sat facing north while its mate departed
oward the south-east, pecking the ground and disappearing downhill.
Predation or losses caused by man
Since Vanellus chilensis nests in proximity to man, humans easily rob
ts young or destroy its nests and eggs by running them over with tractors
*r other machines. At one of the five nests I studied, two ringed birds of
he four young of a clutch were taken by children and a tractor ran over
he nest in the sugar cane field.

While incubating, the bird is rather alert and looks all around moving

Up and walked over to a pole half a metre from the nest and stayed
immobile there. Soon after, I saw the shadow of a vulture circling the
nest. The bird seemed disturbed for a moment and was immobile but
preened a little and three minutes later the vulture went away.
Once, on 14th August 1982 at 10:40, a bird flew off scaring away
two Campo Flickers Colaptes campestris. On 13th August 1982 at 16:45
when three foraging Guira Cuckoos Guira guira approached on the lawn,
an adult near the nest returned running toward the intruders which moved
away with tee tee tee calls. The adult lapwing returned to nest soon
afterwards.
The birds are aggressive all year long toward other birds and humans
passing by: this is evident by their loud calls and running movements
and a few displays toward intruders. This is especially so when they have
a nest or chicks which they defend fiercely,for instance when I was
measuring and weighing young, my husband was standing being attacked
by both adults in flight and diving toward him and actually hitting him
with a wing spur.
Whenever a bird is sitting on a nest or on a mound,if someone passes
it stands and resumes foraging and pecking the ground intently. 'Active
foraging' or 'diligent preening' may be types of aggressive behaviour
toward a predator. At the presence of two dogs 80 m from the nest,
a bird left the nest and stood preening at the edge of the hill.
An immobile bird is hard to see in the middle of burnt stubble which
is also grey like the bird's back. Thus, the alternating immobility
preening, walking slowly and cautiously may be a means of concealmeni
when they really have nests or chicks. However, this behaviour seenE
more pronounced during their breeding season.

While incubating the birds preened a lot and often half stood tc
preen the wings, back and breast; they seemed to be irritated and perhap:
they and the nest were infested with mites.
Foraging
On 16th August 1982 at 08:32 an incubating adult ran from the nes
to peck a flying moth. Most of the time they peck on the ground fo
insects amongst the grass but sometimes one is observed inserting the bil
in the wet grassy ground and digging out worms.
Hatching young
On 17th August 1982 at 10:41, when I suspected there was a chid
in the nest, the adult was half standing in the nest; it turned the eggs an&amp;lt;

at. Its naate was 5 m north of the nest. At 10:58 the sitting bird stood
gain, turned the eggs and soon pecked the ground twice and went 40 cm
way from the nest and preened a lot. At this moment, the chick moved in
he nest. At 11:04 the adult returned to nest and sat with the chick under
ts breast. Between 11:04 and 11:56 there was a change of adults on the
Lest at 11:31 and 11:55; at 11:56 the sitting adult stood up and walked
traight ahead with half an eggshell. It dropped the shell 0.5 m from the
lest and, turning to face the nest, it picked the eggshell up and, half drop-
&gt;ing it, scattered fragments along as it walked to 15 m away, eating some
ragments in the process. The parent returned to the nest, picked up the
&gt;ther half of the shell, and walked with large strides to about 18 m SW of
he nest. There it scattered and ate the pieces in four minutes. It was back
o the nest at 12:05. At 12:20 two eggs, which weighed 21.5 and 21.0 g,
/ere pipping at the large end. The newly-hatched young weighed 17.3 g; it
lad black swollen feet and was mottled on its wet back and head; its eyes
/ere brown. It gave faint peeping calls, had a white eggtooth, and was
/hite on the belly and neck but had a black band across the chest. Its bill
pleasured 1.1 cm.
While we measured and weighed the young, another egg hatched and
he young weighed 19.2 g, peeping with eyes half open. The bill was 1 cm
ong. At 14:30 the third young was hatching but the yolk was still stuck
o the shell and the young was wet. The first-hatched young was quite
try and the second one rather dry. The fourth young hatched at 10:24 on
8th August, when the adults were downhill with three other chicks. At
0:36, after some commotion and screeching, one adult ran to the nest,
ifted an eggshell and carried it away, dropping it once in a while and
eaving it 30 m from the nest. It then returned to the nest and sat briefly.

The young crouch as soon as they hear the adult screeching at a pos-
ible danger. Their downy plumage is mottled in dark and light, incon-
picuous in the middle of low vegetation. A few hours after hatching they
un out of the nest, hurrying back to the nest or hiding under the parents
is soon as there is any danger.
On 26th August 1982, at 18:09 chicks were still running to the centre
)f the football field, between two parents. At 18:14, when it was rather
lark, one bird settled near the nest site and the chick ran to hide under
t. At 18:18 it was dark already; the other birds seemed to sit at the nest
ite but it was too dark to be sure.
On 6th September 1982, the two remaining young were still tiny but
)lack-chested. They wandered up to 35 m away from adults and foraged
n the 'pause-run-peck-pause' fashion, but hid below the adult at a sign of

danger. With two young, each parent was caring for one young.
On 23rd September 1982, the chicks ran like adults on the field.
About one-third the size of the adults, they were getting some feathers.
On 1st October, young were about the size of a Semipalmated Plover
Charadrius semipalmatus and had black chests, white bellies, grey heads,
grizzled superciliaries with some black on the eyeline, and crest and brown
backs streaked with grey.
On 11th November 1982 the pair at a new nest had two juveniles with
them, probably young of the first nesting. Bills were shorter than those of
adults and the back feathers had a banded or scaled appearance. The
plume behind the head was short and the legs were light reddish or pink.
Those juveniles were sitting close together on a mound of sand and grass
cut by a tractor, but 7 m away from the new nest. They readily stood and
started a long preening session when people passed only 15 m or so from
the nest.
Milleo-Costa (1985) reports three individuals '.participating in the
nesting, using displays and stereotyped sounds which characterise inter-
specific agonistic behaviour by attack', but this was not seen in the Rio
Claro nests, except that two juveniles were sitting near a nesting pair.
On 19th August 1982, when I tried to weigh the four chicks, one bird
started to screech loudly and a pair flew after me, thus I presume the first
bird was part of that 'family'. This third member was only noticed when
the chicks were born.
After breeding ends, the Lapwings flock and can be seen in loud groups
of 8-10 flying over the city. Flocks of four can be seen even of nesting!

In my article on Alectoris partridges in a recent issue of our magazine
(Vol. 92: 1: 22-36) I touched on the introduction of the Chukar Alectoris
chukar into Britain and Europe and the disastrous effects this seems likely
to have on the future status of the Red-legged Partridge A. rufa, both in
England and in its native home in south-western Europe, and on the Rock
Partridge A. graeca in Europe. I mentioned that I had not myself seen
hybrid chukar x rufa partridges and therefore could not give a description
of them. I have since done so and also received further information on the
introduction of the Chukar in Europe. Hence this short article as a sort of
postscript to my former one.

Appearance of hybrids

<bodyText confidence="0.990395458333333" page_id="58077891"  page_num="Page 157" year="" vol="">
In the past 12 months I have seen about 20+ hybrid Alectoris in two
different areas in Kent. In the same period and places I have seen only
three that were, in appearance , pure Red-legged Partridges, and two that
appeared to be pure Chukars. A few other Alectoris were seen at too great
a distance to ascertain their status.
Whether these hybrids had been bred in captivity and then released or
had been bred in the wild I do not know but, as the majority of them were
where I had seen mixed pairs in the spring of 1985 (Goodwin, 1986) the
latter seems likely.
Most of the hybrids seen appeared 'in the field' to be closer to one or
other parent form and, by the casual observer, could very easily have been
assumed to be pure rufa or pure chukar as the case might be. The inter-
mediate condition of the neck markings, however, at once revealed their
hybrid status to one looking out for this. All showed some trace of the
streaked 'necklace' of the Red-legged Partridge, varying in amount, never
as much as in pure rufa but always sufficient to tell them from pure
chukar.
It is, of course, quite likely that some hybrids, especially if they result
from back-crossing of a hybrid to one of the parent species or from
hybrids breeding inter se, may have the neck pattern identical or nearly
so to one of the parent species and that I (and others) may not recognise
such birds as hybrids when seen in the field.

ences are hard, perhaps impossible, to ascertain in the field. My friend
Mr Michael Cottrell took some colour photographs of a pair of Alectoris
(near Abberton, in Norfolk) that appeared in the field to be Red-legged
Partridges except for the lesser amount of streaking on the neck. When,
however, we looked at the resultant photographs in detail, we found
that in two characters - the distribution of white and black on the face
and the shape of the bib - they took after the Chukar. One of these birds
has one flank feather fully exposed and this feather (probably also the
others) has two black cross-bars, as on a Chukar, although, in the amount
of chestnut at the tip it (and all other flank feathers of both birds) more i
resembles the Red-legged Partridge.
Pairing of hybrids in the mid
In the spring of 1986 I was able to see only three pairs near enough
to ascertain their status. Near Farningham, Kent, I saw (on two different
occasions but almost certainly the same two pairs) a pair consisting of two
very similar (and very 'intermediate') hybrids and another pair in which
the cock looked a pure Red-legged Partridge and the hen was a hybrid.
Near Cliffe I saw two hybrids paired together, one of which was nearer to
rufa and one to chukar in general appearance.

More on introductions
Thanks to Dr Jurgen Nicolai, who very kindly sent me copies of the
relevant literature, I have now learnt more about the introduction of the
Chukar in Europe. None of it comforting for those who, like myself, hope
for the continuation of the Red-legged and Rock Partridges in their pure
state. It would appear (Glotz von Blotzheiml973; Niethammer, 1963) that
the liberation of vast numbers of Chukars in southern France and else-
where in Europe was ( and I suppose still is) not or at least not only at
the whims of individual shooters and landowners but (so I deduce from
the information given by Niethammer) by or under the auspices of an
international shooting organisation, the 'Conseil Internationale de la
Chasse', with at least the tacit approval of the governments of the coun-
tries concerned. Readers may be glad to know that our late member Pro-
fessor Ghigi appears to be one of the few eminent ornithologists who was
courageous enough to speak out against these plans to introduce the
Chukar into the native haunts of other Alectoris species. As early as 1957
(or before) hybridisation between Cbukars and Red-legged Partridges was
taking place in France. A statement that the hybrids were also fertile
suggests that they were also then freely breeding there in the wild.
It thus seems likely that it is official, or at any rate quasi-official
policy to try to eliminate the Red-legged Partridge in France (possibly
also in Spain) in favour of the Chukar and/or hybrids between the two.
Even if not, there, as of course in England also, the combination of non-
selective shooting by sportsmen, coupled with continual 'topping up' with
fresh releases of Chukars could hardly fail to result in the ultimate dis-
appearance of pure Red-legged Partridges. Unless (1) more Alectoris
partridges were killed by other factors than by sportsmen and (2) these
other adverse factors caused strong selection for rufa and against chukar
and hybrids. Which seems unlikely. Rather similar circumstances (ap-
parently non-selective mortality factors coupled with 'topping up' by man)
have resulted in the racial mongrelisation of the Pheasant Phasianus col-
chicus in Britain and the replacement of wild Rock Pigeons by feral pig-
eons in much of Britain.
I had thought that the introduction of the Chukar and its hybrids into
Britain had been done by individuals at their own free will. Now, of
course, the suspicion occurs that there may have been official pressures
in response to orders from the EEC authorities in Brussels. That the latter
long ago decided that it should be illegal for people in member countries
to grow and market more than a relatively few, officially approved culti-
vars of fruits and vegetables is well known, for there were many published
protests from scientists involved in horticulture and agriculture. If, as

seems all too possible, our masters in Brussels are persuaded that all other
forms of Alectoris are 'inferior to' and 'poorer sporting birds' than the
Chukar and are to be eliminated in favour of it, then the outlook is bleak
indeed. Certainly the large scale introduction of the Chukar into Britain
seems to have coincided in time with our joining the EEC but whether it
is, as I fear, a case of Post hoc ergo propter hoc , I do not know.
If the EEC authorities are behind the Chukar introduction project
then, obviously there is no hope for the future of the Red-legged Part-
ridge now that Spain and Portugal, as well as ourselves, are subject to
their rulings. If not, then it seems to me that the best way to save pure
stocks of the Red-legged Partridge would be to ascertain if any of the
islands where it occurs (probably mostly as a result of past introduction
but that is unimportant), the Balearics, Corsica, Gran Canaria, Madeira
and the Azores, are as yet free of Chukars and/or hybrids. If, happily,
some or all of these islands were found to be free of Alectoris other than
rufa, then every effort should be made to make it illegal to introduce
any other Alectoris species into the wild on them.

Introduction
Assuring the proper rate of evaporative water loss is essential in the
artificial incubation of wild bird eggs. This article describes an example of
excessive water loss from a crane egg and successful attempts to correct
it.
A female Whooping Crane Grus americana (I.D. No. 13-01) laid one ees
at 15:00 h on 3rd May 1982 at the International Crane Foundation (I.C.F.)
at Baraboo, Wisconsin. The egg, weighing 207.11 g and measuring 108.4 x
60.2 mm, was immediately placed in the nest of a pair of Florida Sandhill
Cranes G. canadensis pratensis , in an open area of an outdoor enclosure.
On 14th May the egg was temporarily removed to be weighed and candled.
The fertile egg had shown a daily weight loss of 1.96 g/d which would have
resulted in a predicted weight loss of 27.5% over the entire 29-day incuba-
tion period (Fig. 1). Artificially incubated crane eggs that subsequently
hatch ordinarily lose 10-16% of initial weight during incubation (Rogers,
1 1982). The total weight loss of many bird eggs during natural incubation is
16-18% (Drent, 1975; Rahn and Ar, 1974). Snyder and Birchard (1982)
found that hatchability of chicken eggs is inversely proportional to final
weight loss above 15%. They also report that excessive rates of water loss
during the first half of incubation are more detrimental to hatchability
than the same rates of loss during the final half.

Several methods were employed attempting to slow the daily weight
loss of this egg. The egg was returned to the nest, which was artificially
moistened. The incubating birds were provided with a plastic wading
pool for bathing, and the nest was moistened with water each day. On
21st May the egg was weighed again and still showed excessive loss (1.94
g/d). The egg was then placed in a forced-air, automatic egg-turning
incubator with a dry-bulb reading of 37.6*C and a wet-bulb reading of
30.2*C. The wet-bulb reading was increased to 33.3*C by 24th May and
then maintained between 33.3-34.4*C until 31st May. From 21st to 24th

May daily weight loss remained high (2.10 g/d) despite increased ambient
humidity.
On 25th May the egg was removed from the incubator at a tempera-
ture of 37.6*C and completely submerged in a 0.9% saline solution con-
taining 3000 ppm of tylosin tartrate (trade name Tylan Soluble) at 4.4*C
for five minutes in an attempt to restore some of the lost water. This
method has been used widely in the poultry industry to introduce anti-
biotics into hatching eggs early in incubation since its demonstration by
Chalquest and Fabricant (1959). The egg was gently blotted with a towel,
allowed to dry and then weighed again. Five-minute submersions were
continued daily through 30th May using sterile tap water cooled to 10.0*C
n place of the Tylan solution. The high incubator humidity was main-
tained through the end of incubation.
On the morning of 30th May the egg was removed from the rotating
tray and set in a concave piece of foam rubber on the incubator floor. The
igg was candled, and the larger portion of the air cell was kept uppermost.
By 22:00 h the chick could be heard scratching inside the shell. By 08:00 h
m 31st May, the chick had torn the inner shell membrane and was breath-
mg and peeping loudly. The egg was then transferred to a forced-air hatcher
set at 37.2*C with a wet-bulb reading of 34.4*C. Egg submersion was
discontinued so as not to drown the chick. The chick pipped the shell by
18:00 the next day. The hatching sequence did not progress beyond this,
ind at 15:00 h an aviculturist opened the shell further. The chick freed
tself from the shell at 18:40 h . Ten measurements of shell thickness, in-
cluding the dried membranes, were taken around the midsection of the egg
vith a micrometer.
Within a week of hatching the chick became lethargic. The bird was
:reated with antibiotics and force-fed and soon recovered.

Our attempts to correct the excessive weight loss were unsuccessful
intil we began submerging the egg. The weight loss was not only stabilised
)y this treatment, but the egg actually gained weight (Fig. 1). Total weight
oss to the end of incubation was 21% as opposed to the estimate of 27.5%
Fig. 1). Placing the warm egg in the cold solution produced a negative
cressure and drew the Tylan solution into the egg. Continued use of the
aline solution beyond the initial submersion might have resulted in toxic
)uild-up of salt inside the egg as 6-10 mg of salt may have entered the egg
vith each submersion. The prophylactic Tylan treatment safeguarded
igainst bacterial infection. After the egg had dried, weighings indicated an
tverage gain of 0.885 +/- 0.199 g (x +/- SD, n = 6) from each submersion.
r he weights recorded on Fig. 1 during the submersion treatment are those

recorded each morning before submersion. The corrective measures used
by Burnham (1983) for falcon eggs, such as covering parts of the shell sur-
face with paraffin or injecting Ringer's solution, were unknown to us at
tire time.
After hatching, the eggshell thickness was found to be 0.485 +/"
0.050 mm (x +/- 95% CL, n= 10). Anderson and Kreitzer (1971) give
Whooping Crane eggshell thicknesses from eggs collected before 1910 as
0.604 +/- 0.14mm (not 0.064 +/- 0.014, as given in their Table 1 [D.W.
Anderson, pers. comm.]) and 0.612 +/- 0.057 mm (x +/- 95% CL) for eggs
collected from 1967-1969. These figures suggest our captive-produced egg
was relatively thin-shelled. This thinness may have been partially res-
ponsible for the excessive weight loss of the egg, since water vapour con-
ductance across eggshells is inversely proportional to shell thickness (Ar,j
et al, 1974).
We feel that this method of repeatedly submerging eggs may be useful i
in reducing excessive rates of weight loss in artificially incubated eggs.
From our limited experience it appears that this technique can be used in I
later stages of incubation and on a daily basis.

Description
The Western Spinebill is found in the south-west region of Western
Australia; the only other member of the genus is the Eastern Spinebill
A. tenuirostris found in the eastern region of Australia from Queensland
to Victoria and on Tasmania and islands of the Bass Strait. Spinebills are
closely related to the honeyeaters.
The male Western Spinebill is dark olive grey above and has a broad
chestnut collar over the nape, extending to chestnut throat and breast.
There are white and then black bands across the breast; the abdomen is j
buff. Length 13-16 cms. The female is smaller, duller with no chestnut on
the throat. It lives on heathland and woodlands where it feeds on Kanga-
roo Paw Anigozanthos manglesii and other flowers, Dryandras and Banksia:|
and insects on the wing.
History
Both the male and female were wild-caught birds, the male probably
arriving at Perth Zoo in early 1976 whilst the female arrived in December
1978. Both birds have had a history of recurring scaly feet which pre-
vented us from banding them.
They were originally housed in an aviary that contained a pair of Black-
tailed Native Hens Gallinus ventralis and a Little Bittern Ixobrychus minu-
tus. Two small shrubs covered by a creeper grew over a concrete pond
located in the middle of the aviary.
A small, cup-shaped nest was built in the creeper in November 1983
and one egg was laid. However, unseasonably bad weather caused the
female to lose both the nest and the egg a day after she began to incubate.
In August 1984 both birds were moved to another aviary which had I
been relandscaped along with several surrounding aviaries under a general
theme of 'forests&amp;apos;. The aviary measures approximately 3m high x 4.5 m
inside and faces south-west. It has a sandy floor and is covered with tin
on its northern side. Vegetation in the aviary includes two types of
Bottlebrush Callistemon an Albizzia Albizzia lopantha and several types of
native grass, as well as a number of Kangaroo Paws Anigozanthos manglessi.
A sawn-off branch from Weeping Peppermint Tree Agonis flexuosa is
propped up in a corner of the aviary.

Birds of Western Australia (Serventy and Whittel, 1976) states that
eggs and nests can be found from September to January, with early
nesting birds usually having only one egg and later nesting birds having
two. Eggs are buff with brown blotches, particularly at the larger end,
and they measure 18x13 mm.
Observations
In late August 1984, three weeks after being relocated in their new
aviary, the male was seen displaying to the female. He would approach
her from a lower point of the branch upon which she was sitting and take
a small hop towards her while fanning his tail exposing his conspicuous
white outer tail feathers. The female would then fly off being closely
followed by her mate who would chase her vigorously around the cage.
The roles were often reversed with the female doing the displaying and
chasing. During the displays the male in particular was very boisterous,
calling loudly all the time.
The female soon began constructing a nest,often carrying long strands
of grass around the aviary for several laps before alighting on a branch.
Construction took 4-5 days and was carried out by the female only. She
used Albizzia flowers and dried grasses, as well as camel hair, coconut
and palm fibres, and spiders' webs which were provided for her, hung
in the bottlebrushes. The nests of a Singing Honeyeater Melophaga
virescens and a Striped Palm Squirrel Funambulus pennanti were also
torn up and provided as nesting material. The nest was built about one
metre off the ground in the peppermint tree and was lined with feathers
and camel hair.
An egg was soon noted in the nest, and the female began sitting the
day after the egg was laid. The male was seen to fly to the tallest branches
where he would sing loudly; on occasions he was seen to feed the female
with insects that he had caught.
The diet fed to the birds consists of a nectar mix (2 parts Complan, 2
parts honey, 1 part mixed cereal, vitamin drops), minced and diced beef
heart, fruit and flowering plants and an egg mix as follows:

A lorikeet diet consisting of honey and mixed baby cereal, Complan
and fruit, blended together, was added soon after incubation began, being
offered in a small cup hung in the Albizzia. Mealworms were offered
initially but the birds showed no interest in them. One of the Bottle-
brushes began to flower when the birds went to nest, the profusion of
blossoms resulting in many winged insects flying into the cage which the
male hunted with vigour.
The female left the nest two to three times a day to feed and on one
occasion was seen to fly around the aviary with a white feather in her bill,
with the male following behind singing loudly.
Sixteen days after the egg was noticed a chick was observed in the nest
late in the afternoon as the female left to feed. She returned quickly to
the nest and continued to incubate.
The following morning she was off the nest and a quick inspection
revealed that the chick had died overnight.
The male was soon chasing the female around the aviary relentlessly.
Later in the day she was found in a weakened condition on the ground,
still being harrassed by the male. Some nectar mix was provided for her
behind a small tussock of grass and she drank from it with relish. A small
branch from a peppermint tree was provided for her in a corner to give
her some refuge from the male.
The next morning the female had fully recovered and the male was
returning to the nest and looking into the cup as if trying to feed the
dead chick. Because of the male's persistence in returning to the nest and
his aggressive behaviour towards the female, it was felt that the nest should
be torn up so that they would be encouraged to start nesting again.
Within a few days, construction of a new nest began in a similar posi-
tion to the old one. Late one afternoon the female was found in a lethar-
gic state on the aviary floor, after being harrassed by the male once again.
The nectar mix was again placed on the floor for her and she drank from
it readily.
Construction of the second nest took about six days and it was three to
four days before an egg was observed. The male did not mind nest inspec-
tions, but they were kept to a minimum and were only made after she had
left to feed. A second egg was noted four days later.
In early October, with the increase in evening temperatures, a moth
trap was set each night so that moths could be added to the diet. These
were fed in the morning and afternoon and were distributed in bushes and

grasses with the hope that they would remain and not fly straight out of
the aviary. The male quickly learnt this feeding routine and would wait
near the aviary door before each feed, hovering over the bag of moths like
a hummingbird.
The female added several large feathers to the rim of her nest which
made it very difficult to tell, from outside the cage, whether she was
sitting or not. However, she continued to leave the nest each time that
fresh food was available. The male would often feed moths to the female
after she left the nest.
On 15th October the nest was checked after 16 days' incubation and
revealed the presence of a chick. The following morning the male was seen
taking a small moth up to the nest while the female left to feed. The male
spent most of the day off the nest and the method of placing moths in the
bushes was proving successful with the male catching winged insects and
taking them to the nest throughout the day.
The male was seen to catch small moths and pound them on a branch
before flying to the nest to feed the chick; the female was observed to do
the same.
Eggshells were found on the aviary floor three days after the first chick
was observed and a quick inspection of the nest revealed a second chick.
The size of the moths being fed to the chicks was increasing and the
male was seen to remove the less palatable head and wings, leaving only
the soft abdomen. The chicks could be heard calling loudly as the female
spent less time on the nest because of the warmer weather. Faecal sacs
were deposited on the cage mesh by both birds, resulting in dozens of
white lumps on the black wire.
One morning, about 19 days after hatching, one chick left the nest for
about 15 minutes, returning to the nest for the rest of the day. The follow-
ing day the chick left the nest again and was followed by its nest mate in
the afternoon. As each day went by, both birds spent more and more time
out of the nest. They were fed by both adult birds who would dip moths
in the nectar prior to giving them to the chicks.
About six days after leaving the nest, in early November, one chick
was seen drinking the nectar mix by itself. At this stage it was noted that
the Albizzia plant was infested with aphids and ladybug larvae and adults.
Although it was not observed, these may have been used in rearing the
young Spinebills, along with the other winged insects offered.

By mid-November, both juveniles were independent of their parents.
The male, however, continued to feed them moths that he had caught. The
female was preoccupied with nest reconstruction. She was seen to add new
materials for several days, and it was decided to move the juveniles to an
adjoining aviary to prevent them from interfering with any further attempts

by the adults to nest.
Soon after the two juveniles were removed, the female went down to
nest again, sitting on two eggs. Fourteen days after the eggs were first seen, |
eggshells were found on the aviary floor. One chick was successfully reared,
the second egg failing to hatch.
As soon as the chick from the second clutch was independent, it was
removed to another aviary with four juvenile Banded Wrens Malurus splen-
dens. By late December 1984 the female was again sitting on three eggs in
the same nest and after incubating for about 16 days, eggshells were found
in early January 1985 on the aviary floor.
The male was once again diligent in catching moths and taking them to ;
the nest where a chick could be heard calling. By late January the chick
was old enough to leave the nest, and soon after doing so, the nest collapsed.
It was then discovered that there were two dead chicks in the bottom of
the nest, about 1-2 days old.
By late January it was obvious that the first three juvenile birds were all
males, the black band across the breast becoming evident about 45-50 days
after the birds fledged. The band becomes evident at the shoulders first,
then spreads across the breast.
In early February all the juvenile birds were banded and the last ju-
venile, which was about 20 days old, was weighed (10 g).
On 11th February 1985 the breeding female disappeared. Her body was
found two days later, hidden amongst the many grass tussocks planted in
the enclosure. Because of decay, it was impossible to carry out a post mor-
tem and the cause of her death is unknown. It is felt, however, that she
died from exhaustion due to aggressiveness from the male. The female had
been almost continually involved in the breeding cycle for nearly six
months and must have been approaching exhaustion.
The male was relentless in his behaviour towards the female as he
chased and drove her back to the nest after each clutch had fledged. After
the nest collapsed, however, she could not return to it to escape the male's
attacks. As a result, it is thought that she became progressively weaker
over a short period of time and finally died.
In the future it is hoped that the experience gained with these birds will
prevent the future loss of such a prolific breeding bird, and that with clo-
ser observation, pairs can be separated before such tragic losses occur. We
hope to be able to obtain some new females prior to the next season's
start and have them settled in with their mates so that we can continue,
and establish a breeding programme for these attractive birds.

Neville Brickell writes from the Natal Avicultural Society, South
Africa to report on an excellent achievement by an Ashburton aviculturist
Ken Arnold, who has recently bred the Cabanis's Bunting Emberiza
cabanisi. This is the first recorded breeding of this species by an avicul-
turist in Africa. The date previously unknown to ornithologists and
aviculturists alike is now given: incubation period 14 days; nestling
period 16 days; the male plays no part in nest-building or incubation:
the male fed the female on the nest; the preferred livefood was grass-
hoppers with the legs removed.

Mr. A.J. Mobbs writes: 'In June (1986) a UK newspaper reported
the death, aged 70, of Augusto Ruschi in Brazil. It appears that Ruschi
had had a recurring illness for some time after handling Poison Arrow

&amp;apos;Ruschi was renowned throughout the world as an expert on hum-

He also had a number of books published, many of which became col-

The Avicultural Federation of Australia has sent advance notification
&amp;apos;)f their 1st International Avicultural Convention which is being hosted by
he New South Wales Avicultural Council and will be held at The Central
doast Leagues Club, Gosford, N.S.W. from 10th - 13th April 1987. The
heme of the Convention will be Conservation and the list of speakers
ncludes several well-known members of this Society such as Robin Res-
all, Tony Silva and Charles Sivelle. The Council will be donating 80% of
he profits to the establishment of a captive breeding programme for en-
dangered avian species.
The Convention will be held in a beautiful setting and there are several
nteresting entertainments planned including a bird display at Old Sydney
Town (a recreation of old Australia) that promises to be enormous inclu-
iing around 90% of all parrots kept in Australia.

Ed. P.J. Olney. Published by the Zoological Society of London, 1984.

The twenty-third International Zoo Yearbook will be of particular
interest to many of our members for the special section concerns birds;
of prey and reflects the diverse means by which current problems of
breeding this group of birds, and their reintroduction to the wild are being
tackled. Internationally distinguished authors have written 28 papers on
this theme with subjects ranging from breeding the Andean Condor!
(London, New York and West Berlin), the American Bald Eagle and other
species at East Berlin, and the first captive-bred Secretary Bird (Walsrode);
to guidelines for rehabilitation of injured raptors (P.J. Llewellyn and
P.E. Brain), discussion on the breeding and reintroduction of the Barn!
Owl (Caroline Brown) and many other interesting topics.
Members will remember the special issue of the Avicultural Magazine
(1981, No. 4) devoted to birds of prey, which, for the first time in the
journal's history, had to be reprinted owing to unprecedented demand. Itj
is obvious that there is widespread interest and concern about the manage-!
ment and future of birds of prey and it is gratifying to read J.E. Cooper, inj
the opening article:.'The opportunities offered by captive breeding
must not be underestimated. As Cade (1982) has pointed out, the exper-|
tise now available means that no raptor species need ever become extinct.
This is not the same as saving the free-living population but few, surely,
would argue that it is better for a species to disappear than to survive only!
in a captive state'.
Section 2 contains 30 papers on new developments in the zoo world,
under the headings of Breeding, Husbandry, Hand-rearing and Buildings
and Exhibits. Only four of these concern birds - does this reflect lack of
interest in birds in the zoo world, or inertia on the part of Curators of
Birds in writing about their subjects? This inertia is not unknown to the
Editor of the Avicultural Magazinel
Section 3 is a Reference Section covering species bred in 1981 and
multiple generation births, a census of rare animals in captivity in 1982
and studbooks and world registers for rare species of wild animals in cap-
tivity. Author and subject indices to Volumes 22 and 23 conclude the
section.
The standard of this publication is, as always, of the highest and
this is a particularly interesting volume.

As far as I was aware, Hume never kept any living birds in India,
ind I believe that the reference to 62,000 birds refers to his collection of
kins which was the greatest collection of Indian birds ever assembled by a
)rivate individual. In The History of the Collections in the British
Museum, Natural History , R. Bowdler Sharpe mentions that the Hume
collection was the largest private skin collection in the world at the time,
consisting of over 60,000 bird skins and 16,000 eggs.
Regarding the naming of Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasant, Allan Hume
noticed the tail feathers of the bird in the headdress of a native of Manipur
erritory. After much effort Hume was able to obtain a skin from native
collectors, and a live specimen of the bird that was to be named Hume's
3ar-tailed Pheasant, the name humiae was actually given to the bird in

There seems to be a shortage of information available detailing the
coloration of young Cape Parrots leaving the nest, and I felt that the
ollowing information gained through successful breedings in aviaries last
i/ear (1985) and close observation of immature specimens of P.r. robustus
\ ind P.r suahelicus should be kept for future reference - particularly since
here is one striking difference between the two on leaving the nest, apart
rom the depth of green body colour, dark green/olive colour in robustus
md lime green with silver neck in suahelicus with a darker green back.
In my previous letter (1986, 1:56-57), I confirmed that, from a success-
; ul breeding of four young suahelicus (the Zimbabwean Cape Parrot), all
he young of both sexes leave the nest with a large round crown of

orange/pink feathers, which are later moulted out in the first moult or at
around six to seven months old. At around eight to ten months old, onej
can easily sex the young, for the hen birds then regrow their orange/pink
feathers starting at the base of the top mandible - meanwhile the crown of
orange/pink feathers on top of the head has disappeared. The young cock
birds do not regrow these orange/pink feathers but sometimes retain a few
orange/pink feathers on the crown of the head for a little longer. The adult
cock bird, of course, has no orange or pink feathers on the head, thus
making identification of the sexes very easy. The four young that were
bred at Mitchell Park last year have moulted out to be two cocks and two
hens.
Now the reverse is true of the South African Cape Parrot P. robustus. Aj
colleague from the Cape, Melvyn Reabow, who reared two young P. robus-
tus last year, advises me that both the young left the nest with no colora-
tion on their heads at all, but at approximately six months old one bird
grew orange feathers (as apart from the orange/pink crown of P. suahelicus)\
starting from the top mandible; the other did not, thus confirming that
they are a cock and hen.
Thus, to summarise a strange deviation in the immature coloration of
the two subspecies, all immature P.r. robustus have no coloration on the
head on leaving the nest but all immature P.r. suahelicus have a large round
distinctive crown of orange/pink feathe-rs.
It is fair to point out that the adult hen suahelicus has a far larger!
coloration above the top mandible than the hen robustus , and it is orange/
pink (cerise) in colour, but a distinctive orange only, in robustus.

THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
black and white photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be
used where possible and should be clearly captioned. If authors wish their eventual
return, they must say so when submitting the article and write their name on the
back of each photograph.

The Brown-bellied Amazilia is one of the most common humming birds
of the coastal area of Peru, from Huacho and Sayan in the north to Pesco
and lea in the south. It prefers shrubbery and wooded terrain on the coast
and low Andean slopes but can also be found in the parks and gardens of
Lima.
Description
The birds in my collection were probably collected within the depart-
ment of Lima and both male and female have glittering green throats.
Birds from the more southerly part of their range tend to have more of a
blue-green throat.
Male: upperparts bronze-green, throat and upper breast glittering
green, belly chestnut, under tail coverts white,, tail rufous edged bronze
and white centre to breast, white thighs and ocular spot, bill flesh coloured
tipped black.
Female: same as male but with greatly reduced white centre to breast.
Housing and method employed in this breeding
The male Amazilia was housed in a stock cage, 3 ft long (0.91 m) by
16 in (0.41 m) high and deep.
The female was housed in a mixed flight of mainly female humming
birds. The flight measured 14 ft (4.27 m) long, by 4 ft (1.22 m) wide by
6 ft (1.83 m) high, being well planted with potted house plants. The other
occupants of this flight were females of the following species: Fork-tailed
Woodnymph Thalurania furcata, Chestnut-breasted Coronet Boissonneaua
matthewsii, Tourmaline Sun angel Heliangelus exortis , Bronze-tailed Comet

Speckled Hummingbird Adelomyia melanogenys. Neither of these males
has been moulted in captivity, but once they have completed their first
moult they will have to be caged as both of these species can be rather
aggressive.
If pairs of hummingbirds are kept together continually, this usually has
a negative result on their breeding activities through continual aggression.
If only females are housed in the flight and a female becomes broody, a
male of her species can easily be introduced. I usually leave the male in for
only one hour in the morning before leaving for work, then again for one
hour in the evening before returning him to his stock cage. I usually try to j
observe display and copulation. I carry on this procedure until the nest is
completed and the eggs have been laid.
Display
The female enters the male's territory in a slow, floating, butterfly-like
flight. She perches close to the male making a loud piping call. The male
approaches the female making a pendulum-like display before perching
next to her, touching her by her gape with the tip of his bill and uttering
a low bubbling song. He will open and close his wings at a 45 degrees
angle in very exaggerated movements almost like a man using his arms for
semaphore. The male then flies over the female and lands on the other side
of her and continues with this display. The female will then usually fly
over the male and land on the opposite side of him. Then the male will fly
over her and land on the other side of her. This display can carry on for
several seconds. To watch the birds making progress along the perch is like
watching children playing leapfrog. During this display the male usually
alights on the female's back and mating takes place. On some occasions the
female may land on the male's nape or back to stimulate mating and false
mating takes place.
Nest-building, incubation and chick development
The genus Amazilia is probably one of the most successfully and easily
adaptable of hummingbirds in the wild. These birds will breed all year
round when conditions are suitable and only cease when moulting. The
female Amazilia in my collection can finish a complete nest in five days
preferring to use natural cotton wool as the base to the nest, bound with
fresh cobwebs. They will add small pieces of dried leaves and rootlets to
the exterior of the nest. The nest where the chicks were reared was built in
a Heptapleurum arboricola. During the nest-building the female was ob-

very stressful and she was visibly shaking.
After egg was laid she slumped forward still holding on to the rim of

several minutes until she composed herself, then flew off to feed.
Incubation proceeded with nothing out of order happening. On 20th

Description of young Amazilia
Upperparts bronze-green, upper tail coverts rufous. All underparts
pale brown, vent and thigh white, ocular spot white, upper mandible
black, lower flesh coloured.
I believe this is the first time that this species has been bred in Britain,
and indeed in Europe.

The Five-coloured Mannikin is distributed on the Lesser Sunda and
Timor group of islands, being found on Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Alor,
Sumba, Timor, Sernatta and Balar.
Overall size and shape is about that of the Spice Finch. The forehead
and face are dark chestnut with pale feather shafts, most noticeable on
the ear coverts. Crown and nape are a darker, less bright chestnut with
obscure greyish subterminal bands or tips to the feathers. The throat is a
very dark chestnut brown. The mantle, back t wing coverts and outer webs
of primaries and secondaries are a less dark chestnut brown. The under-
side of the wing coverts are buff. The rump, upper tail coverts and the
wide fringes of the pointed central tail feathers are a deep reddish yellow
to bright, light golden. The median line of central tail feathers and outer
web of others is chestnut brown, the rest of the tail being dull drab. The
tibial feathers and under tail coverts are black; the rest of the underparts
below the throat are white. The irides are dark brown, legs and feet grey.
The bill bluish grey. The sexes are alike. (Goodwin, 1982).
In the spring of 1981 I had the good fortune of being able to purchase
several different species of mannikins from the Lower Sunda Islands.
Unfortunately other than Pallid Mannikins, and four Five-coloured, all
the rest were single specimens of a species. Obviously I was rather hesi-
tant in purchasing odd birds, not knowing if any more would become
available but I purchased the four Five-coloured Mannikins. On closer
inspection the birds' flight feathers were seen to be in poor condition so
they were put in a 4 ft (1.22 m) flight cage. Unfortunately they were of a
very nervous disposition, so although they could not fly very well I put
them in an inside flight measuring 6x6x2 ft (1.83 x 1.83 x 0.60 m),
with some young Red-headed Parrot Finches and Star Finches. Here
1 they settled much better.
As summer approached, the birds started to moult and soon replaced
their flight and tail feathers and they were soon flying a lot better. The
four Five-coloured Mannikins were transferred to an aviary with an inside
flight into my birdroom, together with a pair of Red-headed Parrot
Finches and a pair of Star Finches. The overall enclosure was some 14 ft
long by 6 ft high and 5 ft wide (4.27 x 1,83 x 1.52 m). The aviary was
planted with kerria, honeysuckle, elderberry and blackthorn, not over-

grown but certainly covered from the top by the honeysuckle and some
adjacent tall conifers. Large bunches of seeding grasses were hung on the
wire for the birds to eat the seeding heads and the Parrot Finches to pick
off any insects.
The Five-coloured Mannikins settled in quickly and soon paired off.
It became noticeable that both the cock birds were slightly larger than
the hens and they had whiter underparts, though this could normally
only be seen in good natural light.
Both cock birds started to display. This consisted of the bird stretch-
ing upwards, looking straight ahead, raising the feathers around the back
of the neck and head, and singing an almost inaudible song. (In part
similar to Chestnut-breasted Finches, although with this species there is a
greater variety in the actual display).
One pair nested in a box inside the honeysuckle. Unfortunately after
laying two eggs the hen was found dead for no apparent reason. The eggs
were fostered by a pair of Bengalese Finches which successfully hatched
and reared the young. The young were fed on soaked seed (white millet
and canary seed), small maggots, a proprietary brand of eggfood and
greenfood, normally lettuce.
After the loss of the hen, I was expecting the two cock birds to start
bickering over the remaining hen but this did not happen. Instead, a nest
was built in amongst the bunches of seeding grasses, approximately 4 ft
(1.22 m) from the ground. The nest itself was completely made of dried
grasses and it measured some 7 in long by 4 in (0.17 x 0.10 m); it was
eliptical in shape and the actual nest chamber- was approximately 3 in
(0.07 m) in diameter.
Six eggs were laid, clear white in colour . The birds sat alternately, the
hen only incubating the eggs at night. After approximately 14 days, the
young hatched, light pink in colour and covered in a small amount of
white down. They were reared on the same diet as the two reared by
the Bengalese Finches, with the addition of soaked millet sprays plus
any small insects caught by the adults in the aviary. The young were
brooded by the parents until they were approximately 10 days old.
The five young left the nest after 21 days at which time they were
basically a dull buffish-grey, with some dull white on the abdomen. The
feet and beak were a very dark brown in colour. They were extremely
nervous and special care was taken when feeding them. The parents were
very protective of the young, incessantly calling them to roost together
in a disused nest-box. The young were soon feeding themselves after
seven days but the parents continued to feed them for two weeks after
they left the nest.
At the end of the two weeks, the cock and hen built a new nest inside

the shelter in a 'ball of wire'. Five eggs were laid, of which four hatched
and were reared.
The five young from the first nest were left with the adults and
caused no problem to the new young or to any other birds in the aviary.
By now it was well into autumn and any further nesting activity was
stopped. The young took several months to moult fully into adult plu-
mage. Their moult was similar to that of aviary-bred Chestnut-breasted
and Yellow-rumped Mannikins in that normally a few dark feathers break
through after 12 weeks and then the feathers are gradually replaced, the
last being those on the face and head.
In general, when Five-coloured Mannikins are settled into their quar-
ters, they become hardy, peaceable and as long as they are not dis-
turbed, spend many hours sitting in one spot, normally sunning them-
selves.
Their behaviour is not at any time like some species of mannikins,
i.e. gregarious social preening, etc. The Five-oloured Mannikins always
keep a few inches' distance from each other except when the cock
displays.
Since the first year that I bred this species, they have bred with
varying success. After purchasing my original stock, I was offered some
fresh blood in 1984. There was a noticeable difference in so much that
the original birds had a bright orange/rust coloured rump, whereas the
ji
new arrivals had an almost black rump, but otherwise they were
identical.

During the summer of 1984 I saw, for the first time, a small, chestnut
brown bird at a London dealer's shop in a consignment of birds which had
recently arrived from Tanzania. There were also two birds which looked
like miniature sparrows and were the same size and shape as the chestnut
bird. Although I could not then identify them, I thought that they must
be of the same species and bought all three.
The birds were installed in an aviary measuring IVi ft wide by 8 ft high
and 15 ft long (2.29 x 2.44 x 4.57 m), covered with a PVC roof, the plants
inside being watered by hose.
They seemed very wild and not really suitable to life in a cage. They
always cowered or flew madly round whenever approached and always
seemed to be at the back. I established their identity as Sorella eminibey
whose range extends from the Sudan to northern Tanzania. According to
the field guide, the cocks have an out-of-colour phase when they look like
hens but I have not found this and my adult males retain their chestnut
plumage throughout the year.
Unfortunately during the winter I lost the cock and it was not until
the beginning of May 1985 that I saw two for sale in a shop. I bought both
and moved one hen into an adjoining aviary of the same size and then put
one cock in with each hen. There was a lot of chattering, typical of English
sparrows and almost immediately interest was shown in the nest-boxes of
which there were three, measuring 6 x 4 x 4 in (0.15 x 0.10 x 0.10 m), in
each aviary, of the same shape as a Budgerigar nest-box. The birds quickly
filled all six boxes with very fine grasses and hundreds of feathers. Each
hen laid three eggs, which were bluish white covered with brown speckles,
and within three weeks of buying the cocks, one pair had two young but
the other pair's eggs were clear. The two chicks were reared and then
another three. The other pair eventually reared two young but they had
a lot of clear eggs. The incubation period was 18-19 days.
I feed these birds on a mixture of white millet, pannicum millet and
canary seeds. Millet sprays are given each day and enjoyed by all the birds,
also hard-boiled eggs mashed and mixed with chick crumbs. This is fed all
the year round. Mealworms are supplied during the spring and summer and
are probably taken by the Chestnut Sparrows though I have not actually
seen this. As the aviaries are planted, the birds doubtless find many

insects.
The plumage of the young on fledging is the same as that of the hen,
the only difference being a bright yellow, almost waxlike bill and white
gape flaps which are lost during the next two weeks. The young males
come into colour very slowly.
The Chestnut Sparrows live with a collection of waxbills and show no
aggression towards them except when breeding and they then guard the
top and perch of the nest-box.
As I had some young from each pair, I decided to keep them and try
to breed from them the following year (1986) so I put rings on them and
moved them together into another aviary so they could moult out. I was
thus able to select more pairs for breeding.
I believe that this is the first time that this species has been bred in this
country and it is a pity that the birds are too nervous to allow me to get
near enough to photograph them.
As described above the Chestnut Sparrow Sorella eminibey has been
bred by Mr. Alan Brooker and this is believed to be the first success in this
country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding, or of any other reason
that would disqualify this claim, is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

By Dr. YOSHIKA ONIKI
(Dept, of Zoology, State University of Sao Paulo, Rio Claro, Brazil)
The Blue and White Swallow has a very wide range, occurring through
out South America from the highlands of Costa Rica right down to Tierra
del Fuego. It is a small bird (13 cm long; 11 g) with an iridescent dark blue
back and undertail coverts and white belly. The young is brownish grey
where the adult is blue. Although this is not a species regularly kept in
captivity, it is interesting to report on its habits and nesting as it is com-
monly seen in urban areas, flying around buildings, chirping now and then,
alone or in loose groups. They can also be seen flying graciously over the
large sugar cane fields, pastures, or the edges of woods not far from cities,
to which they may return to spend the night. Sometimes they perch on
telephone or electric wires to rest. At times, one perches on the ground
and picks up insects. This takes only a few seconds and soon they resume
their fast flight and soft chirps.
Nest and nesting material
On 12th January 1977 I was shown a nest with three young. It was
placed on top of a closet within an office at the University of Campinas
(UNICAMP), at a height of 2.7 m, where a burlap bag had been casually
left. The birds placed their nest inside the bag and the nest rim was shaped
according to the burlap opening. The nest dimensions were: external
diameter 0.13 x 0.075 m, internal diameter 0.07 x 0.06 m, external height
0.03 m and internal height 0.02 m. The nest weighed 3.4 g, of which 2.5 g
was of grass stems and the remainder was of 32 black feathers and white
down, and one long (12 cm) black body feather.
The body of the nest was mainly of yellow grass stems, roots and
rootlets, while dark pigeon feathers and white down formed the lining,
making it soft and fluffy. On 10 May, when the nest was collected, it was
full of white scales of feather sheaths. The nest was kept clean of faecal
sacs. Perhaps eggshells were left in the nest and crushed under the young,
but half an eggshell was found near the burlap bag on 17th January.
Young
Assuming the young were 0-1 days old when found on 12th January,
the nestling period was about 23 days, for on 3rd February 1977, at 14:00,
they were flying around the room while both parents were flying outside

and calling to them. Skutch (1952) reports 26 and 27 days as nestling
periods for Costa Rican birds, longer than I found. The young were quite
brownish, with short tails, and were peeping constantly. When the window
was opened they left the room. On 14th January, when the young were
3-4 days old, two large young were leaning on top of the third. On 17th
January (Fig. 1) two young were larger than the third but all were still
i blind. They had swollen and light yellow gape angles, down projecting
from the head and back, and pinfeathers growing on the back and belly.
On 19th January, the eyes of the young were slightly open and at
14:00 they weighed 5, 10, and 12 g respectively. The next day they
weighed 4.5, 10 and 12 g at 13:35. At this time, the smallest young
peeped but the two larger ones moved over the sack to hide away from the
nest. On 19th January, wing quills of the two larger young were 0.4 and
0.5 mm long and tail pinfeathers measured 0.3 and 0.4 mm. The next day,
wing quill and tail were 0.1 to 0.2 mm larger but weight increase was nil.

minutes there were 15 and 19 feedings of the young. On 14th and 17th

15:00. On three occasions, a single adult fed all three young in one visit,
but on other visits it was not possible to ascertain how many young were
fed. At times, after a feeding or between two feedings of young, an adult
ate a faecal sac. If disturbed, the adult dropped the sac next to the nest
and flew out hurriedly. On 19th January, when young were weighed and
measured for the first time, there was only one feeding in a 100-minutes
observation, and the adult perched frequently in the square opening to the
room, gave 'peep' calls and flew about a lot, but fed only once after 16
minutes of watching immobile from the nest rim. After this, the adult left
silently.
Because of protection afforded by the buildings and cliffs in which
nests are placed, young Blue and White Swallows can remain in the nest
for a long time despite it being open and cup-shaped. As a result, they are
well plumaged and strong-flying and able to follow the adults, which are
fast-moving birds that depend on gathering food in the air.

When the young were 1-2 days old, mosquitoes were hovering above
them and trying to bite. Due to the long time young remained in the nest,
both they and it were infested with small mites, which caused them to
scratch a lot. When young are able to move around they even sit out of
the nest perhaps to avoid mites. This infestation by mites seems to be
common among birds that nest in protected areas such as under roofs
in buildings. This was also observed in a nest of a Rufous-collared Sparrow
Zonotrichia capensis at Rio Claro, placed on a large fern vase inside a
building (pers. obs.).
Behaviour of adult
On 14th January an adult sat on the nest for six minutes after one
feeding, but no other brooding was noted.
There were two holes, of about 0.25 m diameter, in the office wall,
one square and the other round, planned for a future ventilation system.
I was surprised with the consistency with which adults entered the building
from the square hole, sometimes perching briefly on it, and left from the
round hole. Once one started to enter through the round hole but turned
and entered through the square one. At times, both adults arrived together
and one entered to feed while the other circled around outside the build-
ing. Feeding of the young was rapid, and the adult picked up pieces
dropped, but young remained in the nest peeping loudly when the adults

Breeding season
Euler (1900:17) reports that the species has the 'same' nesting habits as
Progne chalybea , the Grey-breasted Martin, using roofs of houses in farms
and villages. He reports four white eggs in one nest. Ihering (1900: 207)
says it nests from mid-August in Sao Paulo City. Two fledglings, with pale
gape angles, were with an adult on the biology building at the Universidade
Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Rio Claro, on 26th October 1984. Two other
fledglings were with an adult there on 28th January 1985. At Rio Claro
and Campinas nests were mainly found in January and February. On 27th
January 1985 at UNICAMP, adults entered to feed noisy young in two
nests. Both nests were between the roof and a rectangular light bulb.
Weight and measurements
In the cool mornings of 4th and 5 th August 1984, Blue and White
Swallows were mist-netted at the Agricultural Experiment Station in
Ubatuba, Sao Paulo State. Nineteen weights averaged 11.0 g and 18
cloacal temperatures averaged 38.7*C. Average measurements of 11
individuals were: bill - 5.2 mm; tarsus - 10.3 mm; tail - 50.3 mm; and
wing - 93.7 mm.

(Deputy Director and Curator of Birds)
Since the inception of Tierpark Berlin 29 years ago, we have systemati-
cally put together a collection consisting of breeding pairs or groups aimed
at maximum reproduction. This approach is based on modern zoological
principles, i.e. the captive reproduction of rare and endangered species and
subspecies, and I would now like to report on our experiences in this
regard with birds.
Naturally, we have not confined our programme to endangered species
alone and have also bred more common species as one does not know and
cannot predict which birds that are common today will be the endangered
species of tomorrow. Furthermore, it is important, as has often been
pointed out, to breed the more common species in order to gain insight
into the management needs of endangered forms. I would remind readers
that important bird of prey breeding programmes were begun with the
American Kestrel Falco sparverius and the Andean Condor Vultur gryphus
and in the case of cranes, with the Sandhill Crane Grus canadensis.
A good example is shown by the pelican colony at Tierpark Berlin. In
1958 the pelicans produced the first clutches and in 1961 (Dathe, 1961,
1962; Grummt, 1961) a chick was hatched by the European White Pelicans
Pelecanus onocrotalus. At that time no one was aware of a reduction in
the wild population, still less that the bird would become endangered. In
the interim there has been such a drastic reduction in the population of
the Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus. that the bird is now listed as
'vulnerable' in the Red Data Book and is listed on Appendix I of CITES.
In the report of the Council of Europe for 1981, entitled 'Birds in need
Special Protection in Europe', the Dalmatian Pelican is listed as 'endan-
gered', as is the European/Asia tic population of the European White Peli-
can.
Since our first breeding success we have systematically studied the
behaviour and breeding biology of these birds and to date have contin-
uously bred them for more than 23 years (Grummt, 1983, 1984).
Over the years 20 European White Pelicans have been hatched from
three different pairs, most of which have been successfully reared. Nine
of the pelicans hatched at Tierpark Berlin are of the full second genera-
tion. Furthermore, two chicks each of the following species have also been
bred: American White Pelican Pelecanus erythrorhynchos , Dalmatian

Based on our experiences, the following conditions should be pro-
vided for successful pelican breeding:

1. Large groups of birds to facilitate social stimulation and synchro-
nisation;
2. Optimum feeding on freshwater fish, if possible, because, except for
the Brown Pelican, all other species of pelicans feed almost exclu-
sively on freshwater fish;
3. Provision of adequate nesting sites and nesting material.

A species which deserves very close scrutiny is the Greater Bustard
Otis tarda. The north-west border of its distribution occurs in the German
Democratic Republic. While approximately 800 of these magnificent birds
ocurred in our country in 1975, its numbers have now shrunk to around
350 despite intensive protective measures. The first breeding success in
captivity was achieved by Dr. Gewalt (1965) at the West Berlin Zoo in
1964. Since 1958 we have kept Greater Bustards at Tierpark Berlin in an
enclosure of 2500m^. In 1972 a hen laid four fertile eggs, all of which
hatched and two of the young were successfully reared (Grummt, 1977).
Unfortunately, we lost the breeding birds which put an end to what
seemed to be an exciting beginning with the species. At the moment we
have 2:3 birds of this species. This year one of the hens laid but the eggs
were thin-shelled. The other hens should reach sexual maturity in 1985
so that our chances look a lot brighter for the future. One male was very
active this year and went into full display. He copulated numerous times
with one of the hens.
A 'first' for Tierpark Berlin, and one that has brought us great pleasure
was a breeding among our cranes. In 1980 we received a pair of Manchurian
or Red-crowned Cranes Grus japonensis from the Peking Zoo. In 1981 the
birds produced a clutch of two eggs, one of which was fertile but did not
hatch. During 1982 and 1983, due to disturbances, this pair did not lay. In
the period between 29th April and 28th May 1984, the Manchurian Cranes
produced six eggs, which were collected and placed in the incubator. All
six eggs were fertile and five of them subsequently hatched. Of the five
chicks, one was very weak upon hatching and died 12 days later. Another
chick died as a result of a yolk sac rupture. The remaining three chicks
were reared without any difficulty. It is our intention to build a special
breeding area where we shall try to put together additional breeding pairs
using the three birds hatched in Berlin and four additional specimens
received from the Pyongyang Zoo, North Korea, and one male on breeding
loan from Rotterdam Zoo.

In the case of storks and ibises, we have had excellent success with
certain species. In our Waldrapp Geronticus eremita colony, which consists
of 20 birds, we have reared 11 young since 1981. European Spoonbills
Platalea leucorodia. Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus albus have been breeding
successfully for a number of years. Unfortunately the breeding success
achieved with the African Marabous Leptoptilos crumeniferus in 1979
was not repeated, as the breeding male was killed by the female. The two
remaining pairs, which consist of the original breeding female with a new
mate and the female hatched in Berlin paired with an imported male, both
displayed this year and showed nesting behaviour so that there appears to
be hope for the future with this species.
Black Storks Ciconia nigra have reared young on numerous occasions
and White Storks C. ciconia bred here consistently. In 1981 we received a
pair of Eastern White Storks C. boyciana from the Moscow Zoo. This pair
is very compatible and we look to the future for successful reproduction.
As for the pheasants, I should like to mention our great success since
1968 with the White Eared Pheasant Crossoptilon crossoptilon (Grummt,
1980). At the moment we are expanding our pheasantry and six new
aviaries are already completed. This will give us the opportunity to keep
and breed other endangered galliformes.
A group that deserves our utmost attention is the parrot family, par-
ticularly several New World species whose numbers have been greatly
reduced due to traffic in live birds and the destruction of their natural
habitat. With the exception of three species, all parrots are protected
under CITES, which will curtail the acquisition of new birds from the
wild. Therefore the captive breeding of parrots has taken on greater im-
portance. Rosemary Low, the well-known parrot specialist and expert,
reported on this at the Jean Delacour/IFCB symposium in Los Angeles
(Low, 1983).
We have been highly successful in breeding the Halmahera Eclectus
Eclectus roratus vosmaeri at Tierpark Berlin. One pair of birds has reared
a total of 32 chicks between 1965 and 1977 (Grummt, 1973b). The
Cuban Amazon Parrot Amazon leucocephala first bred successfully in
1981.
Although we have kept macaws since the foundation of Tierpark
Berlin, it was only at the beginning of the 1970s that we started to try
to breed with these parrots. The first breeding occurred in 1974. One
pair of Buffon's Macaw Ara ambigua and a pair of Military Macaws A.
militaris were housed together in an 8 aviary. All four birds were
compatible. The Buffon's Macaws nested in a hollow tree trunk, while
the Military Macaws simply laid their eggs on the floor of the aviary.
The Buffon's Macaws hatched three young, of which two were reared.

This was the first captive breeding of this species. The Military Macaws
hatched a single chick which they reared and the following year reared
two chicks. The Buffon's Macaws reared a single chick in the years 1975,
1977 and 1979.
Due to the fact that the keepers were changed a number of times, the
macaw breeding came to a standstill. It was not until 1984 that attempts
were again made and fortunately these were successful. The breeding
pairs are now housed in indoor aviaries that are about 2-3m ,
The pair of Buffon's Macaws which nested from 1974-1979 laid four
eggs between 29th May and 8th June 1984. The first egg was broken, but
the remaining three hatched. Unfortunately, two of the chicks died. The
remaining one was taken away from the parents when it was 34 days old
and hand-reared.
\0x25A0t
A pair of Scarlet Macaws A. macao laid a clutch of three eggs between
20th May and 25th May 1984 behind a board that was propped against
the aviary wall. A chick could be heard hatching on 17th June. This exci-
ted the pair of Green-winged Macaws A. chloroptera housed in the next
aviary to such an extent that their screaming drove the Scarlet Macaws
from the nest. The eggs were placed in the incubator, and although two
chicks hatched, they could not be reared.
On 6th July, 20 days after leaving the clutch, the first egg of the second
clutch was laid. After an incubation of 27 to 28 days, two chicks were
hatched and reared.
Of great joy to us was the nesting activity of our Red-fronted Macaws
A. rubrogenys which were imported in 1974. Three eggs were laid on the
floor of the aviary in March 1984. One chick hatched on 29th April, and
although well cared for, it died at four days old. On 20th May, 16 days
after the death of the chick, the hen laid again, this time in a nest-box. On
13th June, a few days before the eggs were due to hatch, all the eggs had
been expelled from the nest. All three eggs contained well-developed em-
bryos. On close inspection it was discovered that the macaws had gnawed a
hole through the 50 mm thick bottom of the nest-box. The box was
repaired and the first egg of the third clutch was laid 17 days later on
30th June. On 27th July, after an incubation of 27 days, a chick could
be heard in the box. A total of two chicks were hatched and reared.
Although our breeding record with swans, geese, ducks, flamingoes and
owls has been highly successful, I would like to devote the rest of this
article to our birds of prey breeding programme. This has been rather
long term due to the slow maturing of the birds.
In our large flight cage for birds of prey, which is 1200 m^ (Dathe,
1967), we house principally vultures and Tawny Eagles Aquila nipalensis.
For breeding purposes, pairs should be housed in individual aviaries. The

The Long-legged Buzzards Buteo rufinus bred for the first time in
1970 (Grummt, 1973c). By 1984 a total of 22 young had been reared
among which were the first of the second generation. Tawny Eagles first
began breeding in the large flight cage in 1972 and to date have reared 12
young. Young birds bred at Tierpark Berlin and sent to a small zoo in
the German Democratic Republic are now breeding in the second genera-
tion. The first Bald Eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus was hatched in 1975.
Since the parents would not care for it, it was fostered out to the Long-
legged Buzzards who reared it without problems. Starting in 1976 the
Bald Eagles have cared for their young and to date have reared 16. It is
worth noting that on three occasions, in 1979, 1983 and 1984, three
chicks have been reared from each clutch.
Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos have bred successfully since 1980
with a total of 11 reared. The number of chicks per nest has varied. On
four occasions two young were reared and on one occasion, three chicks.
In the case of the Wedge-tailed Eagles Aquila audax it was a long time
before the birds nested successfully. We received the birds in 1957 direct
from Australia; they were almost fledged when removed from their nest
at the end of 1956. The female laid for the first time in 1969 at 13 years
old. The first young hatched in 1981 and by 1984, five had been reared.
The first Black Vulture Aegupius monachus was reared in 1980. This
bird was parent-reared and as far as we know this was the first time this
species had been bred successfully in captivity.
After many failures we were able to artificially rear a Secretary Bird
Sagittarius serpentarius in 1983.
In 1965 we acquired two Striated Caracaras Phalcoboenas australis ,
which proved to be a pair. After a number of infertile clutches, a chick
was hatched in 1983 which was hand-reared. In 1984 the Striated Cara-
caras have cared for their young and have reared two.
The greatest success at Tierpark Berlin with birds of prey has, without
any doubt, been the breeding of the Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja . In 1972
and 1973 we imported two young Harpy Eagles direct from South
America. Both of these birds proved to be females as each laid eggs in
1979. In April 1981 we were able to obtain amaleon breeding loan from
Adlerwarte Berlebeck in the Federal Republic of Germany. After care-
fully introducing the pair, it did not take long before the birds went to
nest. A young Harpy Eagle hatched on 4th September 1981 after an incu-
bation period of 56 days. The chick was reared by the parents without
difficulty. On 4th November 1982 and 18th January 1984 two more
chicks were hatched which were again reared by the adults. Observations
on the rearing-of the young provided a great deal of new information on

A notable hatching occurred at Taronga Park Zoo, Sydney, on 1st
November 1986. 'Clawed' weighed in at a massive 393 g and is the first
recorded Two-wattled Cassowary Casuarius casuarius to be hatched
since 1934 when Taronga first displayed these powerful flightless birds
(capable of disembowelling a man with a single kick).
The parents have been at Taronga since 1978. In September the female
laid four eggs which, as is usual in cassowaries, was incubated by the male.
Towards the end of the incubation period (as long as 55 days) he abandoned
the eggs. They were placed in an incubator but three failed to hatch.
At first 'Clawed' was kept in a brooder with a chicken for company
and fed on finely chopped, soft tropical fruits, sweet potato and tomato,
with added calcium and vitamins. On sunny days he was exercised out of
doors by the keepers and soon demonstrated incredible running ability.
The Two-wattled Cassowary is found in northern Queensland, being
one of the rainforest's shyest and wariest inhabitants. Ever alert to danger,
it keeps to the most dense areas of forest and uses its helmet to force
a path through thick vegetation. Remaining hidden during the day, it
emerges at night to feed on fruit, seeds and berries,
Two other species, the Single-wattled and Bennett's Cassowary, occur
in New Guinea. All three are threatened by habitat destruction and the
New Guinea species are hunted. Young ones are kept by the natives in
enclosures until they are large enough to be eaten.
'Clawed' will be recorded in the Australasian Cassowary Studbook.
Eventually he will be sent to another zoo in Australia as part of a care-
fully monitored breeding programme. Captive breeding may prove vital
for the survival of cassowaries although to date few successes have
occurred. In Britain the first - of Bennett's Cassowary - took place as long
ago as 1864 at London Zoo. The Double-wattled Cassowary was bred in
this country for the first time at Edinburgh Zoo in 1967 where the success
was repeated in 1968 and 1969. This species was also bred at San Diego
Zoo in 1957 and four young were hand-reared in 1977 at the Villars-les-

The Protea Canary Serinus leucopterus is also known as Layard's Seed-
eater, Dusky-faced Seedeater and White-winged Seedeater. Clancey (1963)
suggested that to call it by its popular name White-winged Seedeater,
which was coined by Sharpe, is misleading as the bird is not white-winged,
having no more than off-white or buffish white terminal spotting to the
medium and secondary coverts; the Protea Canary is most closely allied to
the Thick-billed Seedeater Serinus burtoni. The South African Red Data
Book lists it as protected by provincial laws but a survey of the species'
distributional and numerical status is required (Siegfried et ah, 1976).
This is a rare species, usually found solitary, in pairs or in small flocks
of up to 10 birds. They are difficult to observe as they generally keep
within the confines of dense vegetation. Flight is fast and direct at no
great height. The call has been described as short phrases of mellow notes
interspersed with nasal, wheezy jeeer notes (Maclean, 1985). The sexes
are alike. Forehead, crown, nape and mantle sooty brown, centres to
feathers darker and tinged with olive; rump and upper tail coverts tinged
olive yellow; tail earth brown, the outer webs edged paler; ear coverts
blackish; chin and mid-forethroat white;breast and belly buff, tinged
olive, streaking on breast darker buff and centre of belly white; wing
coverts and flight feathers earth brown; axilliaries and under wing coverts
yellowish; iris brown; bill pinkish to whitish, the culmen-ridge and tip
darker; legs and feet blackish brown to greyish brown. Immatures have
not been described.
The Protea Canary frequents mature Protea fynbos on mountain
slopes, also penetrating stands of exotic pines and evergreen forest in some
parts of its range. Occurs in the Cape Province of South Africa from
Pakhuis Pass in the northern Cedarberg, south to Caledon and eastwards to
Cockscomb in the Grootwinterhoekberge. An extensive survey on feeding
was undertaken by Milewski (1978) which revealed that the Protea Canary
ate a wide variety of food items from 77 plant species and about five
invertebrate species; the diet consists mainly of the seeds of the Protea,
supplemented with soft plant parts (foliage, flowers, fruit and nectar) and
insects; food genera recorded in the diet of this species, namely Graminoid
seed Tetraria (Cyperacae), Restio, Elegia (Restionacae); Achenes (pos-
sibly also composite floral parts) Metalasia, Senecio, Ursinia ; other small

Breeding takes place from August to October when a cup measuring 5,
3-5, 8 cm diameter and 3,5-4, 7 cm depth is constructed of dry plant
stems. Recorded are Kooigoed, an Afrikaans word for several scrambling
aromatic species of Helichrysum. Fine, wiry grass is used to hold the outer
shell together with fluff of Oleander-leaved Protea Protea neriifolia as a
lining. Nests are placed at 3-5 metres from the ground in the vertical fork
of a Protea bush or exotic pine. Two to four eggs are laid. The eggs are
ivory white to very pale blue, spotted and lined with brown, purple and
black, chiefly at the large end. Egg measurements average (6) 20,6 x 14, 6
(19-21, 7 x 14, 4-14, 9). Incubation period is recorded at 17 days with the
nestling period at least 14 days. The young are fed by both parents. I can
find no record of this species having been kept or bred in aviaries anywhere
in Africa, and no notes have previously been written about it in th eAvicul-
tural Magazine.

In response to a hint from our fair editor that a little 'copy' for the
magazine might not come amiss, it occurred to me that the domestic
Canary Serinus canarius is one of the few species that I have kept which I
have not yet written about in our magazine. I propose here to rectify the
omission though I fear that those who read it may come to the conclusion
that 'rectify' was a wrong word to use.
There will be nothing here of use to the Canary fancier. No advice on
how to breed bigger and more beetle-browed Norwich, longer and larger
Yorkshires or more distorted Scots Fancies, wherewith to obtain coveted
prizes. I propose merely to give an account of some of my experiences and
observations and throw in a question or two here and there in the hope
that some readers more knowledgeable on the point than I will be able to
answer them in a future issue. Inevitably any article dealing with the beha-
viour of this species must, to some extent, duplicate and overlap informa-
tion given in Nicolai's detailed study of the behaviour of this and other
species in the genus Serinus. His work (see references) should be read in
full by anyone concerned seriously with the behaviour of the Canary and
its allies.
Canaries and I
Some readers may recall that the first birds I kept when a small child
were a pair of Bullfinches Pyrrhula pyrrhula (Goodwin, 1952 and 1985).
These were at first kept in a cage in the dining room but, for reasons that
I forget, were soon moved to my bedroom, perhaps marginally less suitable
a place. As I have narrated, this Bullfinch pair did actually regain their
freedom. Before doing so, however, they lived with me for about 18
months and in that time my stock was increased, first by a Goldfinch and
then by some Canaries. The Goldfinch I had seen and 'fallen for' in the
pet department of a large London store. A very 'posh' one too, that
charged 7 shillings and sixpence each for its Goldfinches, a third more than
the then average price of 5 shillings.
Someone had told my father, who then and for some years after, took
a rather fluctuating interest in my bird-keeping, that 'Goldfinch Mules'
could be easily and plentifully bred just by putting a cock Goldfinch and
a hen Canary together and that such hybrids were of great monetary
value. Fired by these mistaken or mendarimig ctatpmpntc fo+v, Q r-

bought a clear yellow (technically a 'buff in fanciers' terms) Norwich
Canary (the breed had not got so monstrous then, as it has since). Not
surprisingly, she and the Goldfinch regarded each other with indifference,
which changed to hostility when some mutually desired food or perching
place brought them close to each other. Both my father and I were disap-
pointed at this lack of reproductive impulses and soon the idea of Gold-
finch Mules was abandoned (perhaps my father had learnt of their true and
slight monetary value, in most cases, and of the difficulties of breeding
them) and a cock Norwich Canary was added to the collection. He was
what I believe is known as 'heavily variegated', that is, he had most of each
wing dark muddy brown and some of the same colour on his head, con-
trasting with his orange body. The orange and muddy brown hues were
due to colour feeding and he moulted out more or less the same lemony
yellow as the hen, already christened 'Sulphur' and with his dark areas
more or less of the olive grey tones found in the wild Canary.
A large box cage had been procured and fitted up with a nest-bowl.
The two Canaries wasted little time and soon, to my intense excitement,
Sulphur laid her first egg. My father had by now read up, and also read to
me, much of the then current wisdom about Canary keeping so the egg
was removed, placed on bran in a box, and a pot egg substituted for it.
Amazingly, considering the number of times I disobeyed my father and
covertly examined, handled and generally gloated over them, at least two
of the four eggs were not seriously damaged and in due course produced
two young, one much like his father and the other clear yellow ('buff)
like his mother.
When the next clutch of eggs was being incubated, we moved house,
from Surbiton to Virginia Water. I was much concerned about the Cana-
ries, in fact only concerned about them, and not the trauma which I
suppose my parents had over the move. Partly to pacify me, a car was
hired to take us and the Canaries to the new home and, which astonishes
me even now, Sulphur sat throughout the journey and did not desert
when the cage was set up in the new house. Perhaps as a result of the
journey only one young one was hatched and reared. It subsequently
proved to be a cock, had its entire back olive green with darker streaks
(much like a wild Canary's) and was called 'Greenback'.
Perhaps because none of them reacted socially to me, perhaps because I
subconsciously considered them as, in part, .my father's birds, my first
passionate involvement with the Norwich Canaries did not last. They, and
some Rollers that my father later got, bred for many years but tended to
do so less successfully as the years went on. Many were given away each
year, some escaped, some died (with hindsight I can see why!) and the sad
end result was that by 1937, barely 11 years after the stock had been star-

ted, there were no Canaries left.
Except for two hen Borders that I had for some months in 1958,1 did
not keep Canaries again until late in 1965 when I purchased some Red
Factors and bred from them, mainly because I was interested in one or
two aspects of Canary behaviour which I felt I ought to have remembered
from earlier days but to my irritation had not. Also, it had been stated in
at least one 'authoritative' work on bird behaviour that Canaries, and by
implication other cardueline finches, fed their young for the first few days
on crop milk comparable to that of pigeons. I felt sure that this was not
the case but had to admit, when I got embroiled in an argument over the
matter, that I had no proof. So I wanted to look again and more closely at
parental feeding in Canaries.
For the next ten years I always had some Canaries, all red factors,
usually two pairs, not the same two all the time, and often a few current
year's young ones. I gave away many young Canaries but to a large extent
was forced to curtail numbers by sterilising eggs before allowing the birds
to sit. I had chosen red factors partly for their attractive colours but even
more because most of them then were fairly near to the wild Canary in
general size and shape, certainly far more 'natural looking' than the (in
Britain) most popular fancy breeds.
Red factor Canaries and their colorations
As all who read this are likely to know, or at least, like myself, to have
been informed, red factor Canaries were produced by hybridisation with
the Red Siskin or Hooded Siskin Carduelis cucullatus. Back crossing
hybrids to Canaries and selective breeding enabled the 'red factor', that is
a gene or genes permitting the development of red pigment, to be trans-
ferred to what are now, in other respects, apparently pure Canaries. How-
ever, from what I have seen and the very little I have read on the matter,
it appears that although some red factor Canaries show delicate shades of
pale orange, pinkish yellow, ivory white and (when they have melanin
pigments also) rich reddish browns, orange browns, buffs and yellowish
green; red or orange-red colour can only be obtained by careful feeding,
prior to and during the moult, with foods containing red carotenoids and
lacking yellow carotenoids. The resultant reds tend too, to look very
'unnatural', not much like the lovely near-vermilion of the Red Siskin. I
bought at times two or three red factor Canaries that were a deep orange-
red or shrimp (boiled) red. All these birds, fed on abundant greenfood and
some eggfood besides seeds, moulted out pale orange yellow or pinkish
yellow.
Sexual differences and the (often great) differences of coloration be-
tween adults and young in red factor Canaries are sometimes attributed to

the Hooded Siskin ancestry and this may well be so. On the other hand, in
the wild Canary, and some other serins, the juvenile plumage is much paler
and browner than that of the adult. Also in the wild Canary the cock is
much brighter than the hen and less profusely marked on breast and flanks.
Of my young red factors that I kept to adulthood and made careful
notes on, a hen with wild Canary-type markings was basically a medium,
quite dull brown in juvenile plumage and moulted into a general orange
brown. Her face and breast became much brighter and more orange, presu-
mably through abrasive moult, in spring and summer. A hen, which in her
juvenile plumage was pale orange with a brown 'cap', moulted out a darker
orange with a still darker orange cap. A cock who was cinnamon brown
moulted out deep orange and a hen who was a clear, delicate ivory colour
in her first plumage, moulted out, rather to my disappointment, a pale
pinkish orange.
To what extent the many new and beautiful (if hardly red) colours
found in red factor Canaries are due to genes introduced via the Red Sis-
kin has always seemed to me 'unproven'. The original Norwich Canary had
a naturally rich golden yellow colour (Wallace, 1903); the much lamented
London Fancy was apparently golden with grizzled (in juvenile plumage
solidly dark) wings. These two types vanished without trace sometime in
the previous century but could their, or similar, genes have 're-surfaced' in
our present day red factors?
I will say no more on this topic, of which I know little, but appeal to
any reader with more knowledge of the subject to write an article giving us
information on it.
Nothing in the behaviour of my red factors suggested that they were
not in this aspect identical to 'pure' Canaries. On the other hand, I have
not kept Red Siskins so may have failed to recognise traits of this species.
Again, information from those with knowledge of the matter would be
welcome.
I did notice that my red factors were very unwilling to eat 'plain'
canary seed and left to their own choice ate, of seeds, mainly niger and
(when available) hemp, as well as large amounts of soft food and green
food. I think, however, that my own reluctance to force them on to a less
rich (and cheaper) diet, rather than Red Siskin genes, may have been
responsible for this. I was perhaps overconscious that the Canaries of my
boyhood had probably been, all unwittingly, kept on too meagre a diet.
i
General and feeding behaviour
Like most long-domesticated species, Canaries are usually very willing
to sample new foods. Such 'unnatural' foods as egg-food, milk sop and the
like, are always eaten eagerly, although some Canaries show little enthu-

siasm for some of the modern 'all purpose miracle' type ready made-up
rearing foods. Compared with other small seed-eating birds, Canaries usually
take, if given the chance, a lot more fruit and green vegetables. I can re-
member in my childhood giving such things as pineapple, and even straw-
berry jam to Sulphur and her mate. I did not give much in the way of fruit
to the red factors kept later but did establish that although they took
sweet eating apple eagerly (if cut across so they could get at the flesh
easily), sour cooking apples were invariably rejected after the first taste.
Like our Linnet, Goldfinch and Redpoll, the Canary regularly uses its
feet to hold greenfood, stems of seed heads and the like, down to a perch
while it feeds from them. In general Canaries seem uninterested in live
food. I did, however, have two hens for a time in a room with various
estrildids that became very fond of Blowfly pupae. I think they regarded
them in the light of 'soft-centred seeds'. Also one of my red factor cocks
ate Blowfly maggots readily and fed them to his nestlings.
Where birds of approximately equal age and condition are involved,
cock Canaries are normally dominant over hens, except during the breed-
ing period. When or before serious nest-building starts, the hen becomes
dominant over the cock. This presumably functions to give her 'a free
hand' at and around the nest without risk of interference from the cock.
The changeover period can, at least under domestic conditions, be fraught
with tension and flare-ups of aggression. Nicolai says, no doubt correctly,
that any appreciable lessening of the cock's reproductive impulses may
cause a cessation of his submissive attitude to his mate and he may then
attack her if she threatens him or if she solicits him too importunately.
Dominance reversal between the mates also gives the hen confidence to
assert herself over other cock Canaries, should she be pestered by them.
This dominance of the hen during the breeding period occurs in some
(possibly all) other cardueline finches also and may sometimes give the
hen confidence to assert herself over birds she would normally flee from.
I saw a nice example of this (I hope readers will forgive the digression) in
mid-April of 1982. This was a 'Siskin winter' in the Petts Wood area and
many Siskins Carduelis spinus had been coming for peanuts since February.
They were, however, only able to feed at a hanging peanut bag in heavy rain
or when somebody was standing close to it. At other times the peanut bags
were taken over completely by House Sparrows Passer domesticus and,
when these took shelter in moderate rain or because a human came too
near, by Great and Blue Tits Parus major and caeruleus. The latter showed
'vindictive' aggression towards the weaker Siskins as they do towards Coal
Tits P. ater. On this occasion I was standing within a couple of feet of the
peanut bag in order to allow a fine cock Siskin to feed from it. A hen

shortly appeared, he casually made threatening movements towards her
but she, who had evidently just developed the 'change of heart' in refer-
ence to feminine status, turned on him furiously, chased him off and re-
turned to the peanut bag. After she had fed a little, I moved away and in-
stantly a Blue Tit flew at the Siskin to drive her off. She, as if out of habit,
flew to a bough about 10 ft away but when the Blue Tit, instead of feed-
ing, flew at her again to drive her further away, she seemed to 'remember*
her new status., turned and fought back and finally chased off the Blue
Tit! Unfortunately for both, I then went indoors and the House Sparrows
moved back to the peanuts.

Reproductive behaviour
If a pair of Canaries are put together well ahead of their (subsequent)
nesting time or if the cock is put with the hen before she has selected a
nest-site, then it will be seen that the cock takes the initiative in nest-
site selection. He searches for suitable places, and having found one, turns
around in it, usually making movements similar to those of the hen when
'shaping' her nest. Sometimes he mandibulates potential nesting material
and carries it to the site he has selected but he does not, in my experience,
ever perform actual nest-building with it.
All nest-building is done by the hen, once she has selected the nest-
site or, as it is more usually the case, 'approved of the site that her mate
has selected. Normally the nest is placed in some bowl, basket, or topless
or half frontless box supplied by the birdkeeper but if the aviary has
suitable bushes or shrubs and an abundance of suitably fresh, tough and
not too dry material, Canaries are usually quite capable of building more
or less Greenfinch-like nests for themselves.
The eggs, usually three to five, and pale greenish blue with purplish
flecks and dots, are laid in the morning at daily intervals. Most domestic
Canary hens seem to incubate from the first day. The cock does not
normally incubate or brood young but he feeds the hen both on and off
the nest. Like the Goldfinch, the hen Canary is in no way inhibited from
noisiness at the nest-site. Even when incubating or brooding nestlings she
not only begs (or would feminists prefer the word 'demands'?) food loudly
when her mate comes to the nest but she also calls out loudly and often
when she hears him nearby. I, and I imagine many of our readers, have
often discovered Goldfinches' nests through this calling of the sitting hen
but, presumably, no common natural nest predator of this species or the
wild Canary can use its ears to find nests, else natural selection would long
ago have forced the females of these species to be quieter than they are.
I paid detailed attention to parental feeding in my red factor Canaries
and confirmed what I had assumed from my boyhood observations, and

is implicit in most non-ornithological writings on the subject, that the Can-
ary does not produce crop milk or any substance analagous to it. It is, of
course, possible that saliva or similar liquid may (and probably does) mix
with the food fed to the young and this may contain some enzymes, trace
elements or whatever. My Canaries did not seem to discriminate between
animal and vegetable foods or to select foods of high protein content for
the young; so long as the food was palatable and soft it was fed readily
even to small nestlings. No doubt, under wild conditions, this would result
in the young being fed at first only with suitable foods, probably mainly
or entirely seeds still at or only a little beyond the 'milky' stage.
Both sexes feed the young but only the hen broods them. It is probable
that under natural conditions most of the food that she gives them for
the first week or so has been given her by the cock, although when the
birds are in a cage where the hen can see from the nest that some new and
much-liked food has been put in, she will come off to take food for
herself and her young more often than she would otherwise do. The
young are fed from the crop, the parent, as in other cardueline finches,
bringing up mouthful after mouthful and feeding each separately to a
young one. If not yet moulting, the hen usually starts a second nest (if
given the chance) before or very soon after the young fledge. She usually
ceases to feed the young as soon as, or shortly before she begins to lay
the second clutch and her mate is left with sole 'responsibility' for them.
In my boyhood days my father and I had some trouble with hen Canaries
plucking the body feathers from their young but, misled by the 'advice'
then published on such matters, did not draw the correct conclusions. I
now have no doubt that in most, probably all, such cases the root cause
is an insufficient diet, probably deficiency of salt and/or protein being
the major factor. Feather plucking in parrots is now known to be caused
by lack of salt in the diet.
Young Canaries, when begging, flutter their wings but at the moment
of actual contact, when the feeding parent inserts food into the young
bird's mouth the latter's fluttering wings instantly 'collapse' and fold
against its body, only to flutter again the moment physical contact be-
tween parent and young is broken.
Note on calls and song
Nicolai has dealt very fully with the vocalisations of the Canary and
other Serinus species and those of my readers who keep Canaries are likely
to be familiar with their calls so here I will touch on only one or two
points of interest.
The sweet or tsoo-eet that some naive keepers fondly think is the bird
answering their endearments in kind when they peer into its cage, is in

fact a note of alarm or anxiety. Most of our British finches have homo-
logous and very similar sounding alarm calls, that of the Greenfinch
Carduelis chloris being almost identical to the Canary's in sound, at least
to my ears.
I twice heard this sweet call given in a very harsh and emphatic manner
by a cock Canary (whose mate was sitting) when he saw, from the win-
dow, a tabby cat in the garden below. Neither he nor any of my other
Canaries showed any alarm at, or more than slight and superficial interest
in a stuffed Burrowing Owl Speotyto cunicularia (a species very like the
Eurasian Little Owl Athene noctua ) which I showed them.
Everyone who has taken any interest at all in Canaries or read a little
about them knows that the Roller Canaries, which seem originally to have
been produced in the Hartz Mountain regions of Germany, have a much
softer and sweeter song than other breeds. Nicolai states that this has been
brought about not only by selection for the best singers but by the biologi-
cally bad conditions in which Roller Canaries are usually kept - in small,
dimly-lit cages; fed mainly on rape seed; inbred, etc. He states that this
causes those - to human ears harsher and less pleasant - parts of the
normal song which are particularly uttered by strong and fit cock Canaries,
to be suppressed in favour of the softer parts of the song. He says that if
Roller Canaries are kept for a few generations under good conditions, the
sweet soft song is transmuted into the louder, harsher song of an ordinary
Canary.
This is another aspect on which some of our readers may be able to give
opinions based on personal experience and I hope that they will do so. I
found the songs of my red factor Canaries, which appeared to have derived
from Rollers on the Canary side, to be quite harsh and loud. Indeed not at
all pleasant to my ears in the confines of a room.

Introduction
These notes relate to a group of unusually tame Wood Pigeons Columba
palumbus in St. James's Park, London, and describe how the colony arose,
the remarkable degree of tameness, and comment on related matters such
as recognition and memory.
Prior to the re-emergence of the Wood Pigeon as a hand-tame bird
there, I had been visiting St. James's Park regularly for two or three years,
as I was then taking a particular interest in wildfowl, and the fine collec-
tions there and at Regent's Park were a means of learning more about
them. In general, the closer the bird the more interesting, and if you feed
them they come closer still. One cannot, however, feed the pinioned birds
without feeding the wild ones as well, even if one wished to, for the latter,
like park birds everywhere, are adept at snatching food intended for others,
and I quickly settled down to feeding a fairly wide range of species. This
may be relevant to the ease with which personal relationships were later
established with certain wild birds, for, as discussed later, some birds can
readily recognise a particular human being, so that by the time the Wood
Pigeon story began I may already have become a familiar, and apparently
harmless, dispenser of food.
Development of the colony
By the bridge across the lake in St. James's Park, House Sparrows
Passer domesticus fly down readily onto the hands of those who feed
them. Similar groups of hand-tame birds of various species exist through-
out the world, but details of the birds' behaviour during the formation of
such groups is not usually recorded. Clearly each group must start with
one bird, more reckless than the rest, being coaxed onto someone's hand;
then otliers, enticed by the food and reassured by the first bird remaining
unharmed, follow its example.
The time between the first hesitant step of one bird and the creation of
a group for which this has become a regular method of obtaining food will
vary with the species, and the intensity with which the new behaviour is
deliberately encouraged. The behaviour will vary also for different species,
and according to the particular circumstances. Thus, in the case of the
Wood Pigeons a notable (and personally gratifying!) feature was that in the
early stages they could not be persuaded to fly to anyone but me, whereas

Wood Pigeon seemingly interested in the 'Crop Storage' issue of Farmers Weekly
Starlings Stumus vulgaris , that have been taught to stand on the hand to
feed, will from the outset go to other people using the same feeding tech-
nique.
Most birds in town parks are much tamer than their conspecifics in the
country, and the London Wood Pigeons are no exception. That they flew
onto the hand in Regent's Park in the 1920s is recorded by Grey (1927),
and from 1934, perhaps earlier, until the war started in 1939, there were
many Wood Pigeons in St. James's Park that would perch upon one's
hand, shoulder or head for food. These very tame birds were probably
killed off as pests as part of the Government's campaign to exterminate
the Wood Pigeon (Goodwin 1978).
During February and March 1982, two Wood Pigeons came to me at a
particular seat when I visited the park each weekend, and would take

biscuit from my outstretched hand. Later they would perch on my hand,
and one of them would let me run my fingers down its breast, stroke its
neck and, to a lesser extent, the top and back of its head, but would not
allow me to touch its wings. This behaviour was unusual, as at that time
Wood Pigeons in St. James's Park, though they would approach people
quite closely, were not tame. In March these two birds were joined by a
male with all the toes missing from the left foot, and which was promptly
named Stumpy. The naming of wild creatures as though they are pets
may seem to some unnecessarily sentimental, but it is easier to use names
in one s notes than to describe the distinguishing features each time.
Similarly if I speak to them, it is because I believe they may respond, like
horses, to a quiet tone of voice, and not because I expect a reply - not
even in pidgin English as someone once suggested. Anyway, during April
and May neither Stumpy nor his unnamed companions appeared for their
biscuits and I thought the episode closed.
In early June three birds, one of them Stumpy, again came to me on
the seat lor food, readily flew onto my hand, and could be stroked. I was
now visiting the park daily, and events moved rapidly. Within a few days
it was clear that the birds, (a) had no difficulty recognising me, (b) were

prepared to fly onto my hand, but to no one else, and (c) would allow me
to handle them to a remarkable degree, extending or imprisoning their
wings, etc., in a way that even the feral pigeons Columba livia, var. would
not tolerate.
The number quickly doubled, and later reached a peak for that year
of about 10 birds, including two juveniles. When I entered the park and
neared the section occupied by the tame birds, they would fly from the
grass or from a tree up to 60 m away, landing confidently on my hand.
Although one or two of the people who regularly fed the birds in the park
tried hard to persuade these Wood Pigeons to fly to them, it was two and
a half months after their reappearance in June before they flew to anyone
else. However, in late August some started to do so, although in 1982 they
remained selective and would not fly to strangers.
That first summer I fed them daily, but could not continue to do so
indefinitely, and was concerned about stopping their regular meals, which
they had now come to expect. Fortunately the birds solved the problem
for me, as when that year's abundant crop of mast ripened on the copper
beeches they were no longer interested in the digestive biscuit or pigeon
mixture that they had taken so eagerly before. In any case, most London
Wood Pigeons leave their nesting territories in early autumn, and return to
them between the end of October and March; and tame individuals with an
assured food supply leave with the rest (Goodwin, 1978). The presence,
and absence, of a few ringed, and therefore individually recognisable birds
in St. James's Park was monitored for four years. Most of those birds, but
not all, left in the autumn, and all those that did so left in the second half
of September, or in October, and returned between late December and the
first week of April. However, birds with late broods are sometimes to be
seen feeding unfledged young in the first half of November, and some,
perhaps 10/15% of the number present in summer, were to be seen
throughout the autumn and winter.
The birds that leave the park in autumn do not apparently go far, but
probably move to a communal night-time roost, from which they disperse
daily to feeding places in or on the outskirts of Greater London; very
likely joining the large numbers feeding on beechnuts and acorns in such
places as Hampstead Heath and Richmond Park (Goodwin, 1978). That
some at least remain within easy range of the park was evidenced by the
temporary reappearance of two ringed birds, both males, during their
period of absence. One of them, 'absent' from 18th September 1983 until
7th April 1984, was present daily from 26th November to 11th December,
and was also seen on two isolated dates, on 24th December and 28th
January. The other, 'absent' from 12th October to 22nd December 1984,
was seen on three dates, 24th November, and 1st and 8th December.

There is also often a marked difference in the size of the meals taken
from the hand in winter. In summer, they will gorge themselves to capacity,
as will those birds that overwinter in the park, whereas those that leave in
autumn and return, say, at the turn of the year sometimes come briefly to
the hand and fly off after eating only a small amount. It seems that these
birds have a good supply of natural food elsewhere and, with the approach
of the breeding season, are making short visits to their territories, as des-
cribed by Murton, (1965).
Since that first summer I have made a point of feeding the Wood
Pigeons irregularly. Although it is usually recommended that food be put
out for garden birds regularly at bird tables, etc., regularity in the case of
hand-tame wild birds is, in my opinion, best avoided. To consistently pro-
vide a particular bird with daily meals may seem at first thought to be
solely beneficial, but it may cause too drastic a change in the bird's beha-
viour, turning it into a pet rather than a truly wild creature. If it believes
it can depend upon a meal at a particular time it is unlikely to seek its
natural food to the usual extent, and may become overfat and/or inactive,
especially if fed with food that is deficient in some way. Also, regular
feeding of a wild bird, perhaps several miles from one's home, cannot
always be maintained or carried out punctually, and the bird itself may
misjudge the time. Clearly any breakdown in a regular arrangement can
cause the bird distress. The occasional nourishing meal at odd times,
however, is beneficial without unduly affecting the bird's normal way of
life, and can be regarded as a bonus. This arrangement is also flexible; the
birds can be fed frequently when necessary, for example, in hard weather,
and special attention can be given to the needs of any bird that is sick,
injured or undernourished.
The tame birds remained tame and flew unhesitatingly to me on their
return in 1983. Others followed their example, and that summer 20 Wood
Pigeons were flying to the hand for food; fortunately not all at once,
though they can sometimes be rather overwhelming when I first arrive.
Incidentally, when counting the birds that fly to the hand, it is essential
to mark them as you count, otherwise you will include more than once
the birds that return for further helpings of food. Lipstick, being easily
applied, easily removed and non-toxic, is ideal for this purpose. Since
the dabbing of Wood Pigeons with lipstick seems to be regarded by any
onlookers as eccentric behaviour, however, these censuses have been in-
frequent.
The situation still existing at the time of writing (September 1986)
was established in that second year, although the number of hand-tame
birds has now settled down at around 30. The birds no longer discrimina-
ted to the same extent between strangers and those they knew and con-

sidered trustworthy, but there was, and still is, individual variation, some
birds going readily to strangers, others only after much coaxing, and some
not at all.
Since they usually return to the same place in the park each year, the
tame birds have remained for the most part a localised colony, but there
are two or three in other parts of the park that now fly to the hand. These
perhaps were tamed originally in the main colony, possibly as juveniles,
and have chosen or been obliged to move elsewhere, but if you feed birds
year in and year out in a particular place, you will become a familiar figure
to many of them, and some may decide you are relatively harmless, and
become trusting without any premeditated effort on your part.
Degree of tameness
The trustfulness of Wood Pigeons that have become hand tame is quite
astonishing, particularly as this species is shot so extensively in other parts
of the country that it is usually extremely wary. Their tameness on the
hand (Gosling, 1985) far surpasses that of the feral pigeon, so that in com-
parison the feral pigeons in the park, and nearby Trafalgar Square, so well
known for their tameness, are noticeably 'jumpy'. The Wood Pigeon is
much more at ease. When it alights on the hand it will stand erect, waiting
patiently to be fed, and will let you stroke its beautiful pink breast. Any-
one doubting the loveliness of the Wood Pigeon should see it in this
upright pose, standing motionless with head held high and alert gaze. In
return for the food one can take surprising liberties with them: extend the
wings, fan the tail, examine the wing pits, and carry them about the park,
or out of the park. Stranger still, they will allow a cupped hand to be run
firmly down their back from head to tail, and they can be gripped quite
firmly over the closed wings, so that they are, in effect, imprisoned; also
one can encircle the throat with thumb and index finger, grasping them
quite tightly, yet they remain unperturbed by such handling. Such is their
trust that although physically aware of what is happening, they do not
feel imprisoned, any more than we feel imprisoned in a train or coach with
doors operated by the driver. If the 'doors', or in this case the hand, fail
to open when they wish to leave that is a different matter, for they will
not willingly be held captive; yet those that have been held against their
will for some necessary purpose will usually return to the hand an hour
or so later.
In contrast the feral pigeon is more nervous, and if you wish to place
your hand on it, it is usually necessary to do so when it is absorbed in
eating, as they tend to shy away when touched, readily flying off at a
touch or movement a 'Woodie' would ignore, though returning a moment
later. It is a matter of temperament, and long acquaintanceship makes

little difference, so that a Wood Pigeon fed half-a-dozen times will still
be more relaxed than a feral pigeon fed frequently for two or three years.
It has been suggested to me by Eric Gillham, who has been associated
with the birds of St. James's Park for many years, that the relative indif-
ferance of the tame Wood Pigeons to being 'manhandled' may be in part
linked to the manner in which they take from trees food that they cannot
easily reach, namely by hanging, often upside down, with wings spread
out among the branches for support. This I think is likely, for the Wood
Pigeon is a robust bird, with powerful wings, as illustrated by the well-
known 'wing-clap' used as a finale to its display flight and when disturbed.
I sometimes feed them on a weeping copper beech, or weeping willow, and
they will 'crash' noisily into the pendant branches, displaying in their
eagerness to reach the food offered to them an acrobatic skill quite out of
keeping with their portly appearance on the ground. Yet, notwithstanding
their rough and tumble antics at times, and the aggressiveness that forms a
necessary part of all birds' lives, they have a placid temperament, with a
gentle and endearing 'dove-like' quality much in evidence.
Any study of separately recognisable birds highlights how individual-
istic they are. In the few, but widely different species that I have observed
at close quarters it has always quickly become clear that the birds have
minds of their own. It is not surprising, therefore, that the tame birds have
their separate personalities and behave in different ways, nor that some
Wood Pigeons can never be persuaded to fly to the hand, however often
they see their conspecifics feeding there unharmed. Their sex is undoubt-
edly relevant to their character, but in the degree of tameness and willing-
ness to be tamed, I have noticed no difference between male and female.
Recognition and memory
It was found that Wood Pigeons can readily identify a particular person
even in a crowded park, and their ability to do so can be impressive when
they swoop down from a tree or fly across the grass to land unhesitatingly
on the hand.
Experiments showed that they recognise by sight the person , and not
what is worn or carried, presumably, as we do, by the features, aided by
other factors such as expression, stance and walk, which together make an
identifiable whole. Grey (1927) records how a pair of Swallows Hirundo
rustica recognised and attacked him when wearing the knickerbocker suit
he wore when they found him examining their nest, though not if he was
wearing a suit of similar colour but with trousers; and he found that his
tame Robins Erithacus rubecula would not go to him if he wore dark
clothing. The Wood Pigeons, I am pleased to say, do not seem to mind
what I wear. Recognition is not dependent upon what is worn or carried,

or the time of day, or the direction from which their area is approached.
A complete and simultaneous change of all these factors made no apparent
difference, and the birds undoubtedly recognise the person, though no
doubt if seen in unfamiliar clothing or unexpected circumstances they may
do so less swiftly. Howard (1952) found that her tame Blue Tits Parus
caeruleus and Great Tits Parus major recognised her whatever she was
wearing, and that they also knew her voice. I do not know whether or
not the Wood Pigeons know my voice, but recognition was purely visual
during my experiments as I did not call or speak to them. That unfamiliar
clothing can cause alarm is well illustrated by an experience of Derek
Goodwin's (pers. comm.). Two young, very tame captive Wood Pigeons
that had always seen him in an open neck shirt, and flown onto him,
letting him handle them, went into a wild panic, fleeing from him and
battering the wire when he entered their aviary wearing a tie. When he
returned without a tie, they behaved with their customary tameness.
So far as recognising human beings is concerned, there is perhaps a
tendency to under-rate a wild bird's capabilities. Such commonly heard
remarks as 'feed the birds regularly and they will get to know you' give
the impression that they are slow learners, that recognition is a gradual
process requiring several encounters, preferably at a set time and place.
This is not necessarily the case, and a strong association of ideas can
override the need for repetition, so that recognition can be immediate.
Feed a Wood Pigeon, or feral pigeon, well one day and you will often
find it recognises you straight away the next. I imagine it is much as it
is with us; we do not, cannot, take note of everyone, but are selective,
remembering those who give us cause to do so, even though we have
seen them only once before.
It was found that other species, too, may be good at recognising
people, and a female Mallard Anas platyrhynchos would fly from the
lake and follow me across the grass, not because there was any food in
evidence but because she knew from past experience that it would be
produced, and she would be given a good feed of corn and biscuit. In
many cases the bird has the advantage. A Carrion Crow Corvus corone,
for example, would fly across the park, land buoyantly three or four
metres away, shout for food, and when it was produced walk up jauntily,
but warily, to take it from my fingers. As it did not do this with anyone
else it clearly knew me, yet apart from this unusual tameness, I could find
no feature that would enable me to distinguish it from the other eight or
nine Crows frequenting the park at that time.
Care is, of course, needed before concluding that a bird recognises
you. The fact that a bird hurries straight to you with every sign of recog-
nition does not mean necessarily that it knows you, as it may well do the

same to complete strangers. Many park birds rush eagerly to anyone they
think may have food, and are quick to note the slightest hint of a possible
'handout'. Consequently, proof of recognition is not always readily forth-
coming, and though I have fed certain Black-headed Gulls Lams ridi-
bundus for several years now, I still only 'think' they recognise me.
Lack (1965) refers to instances of Robins remembering a person
after an absence of six months, and cites the case of a Song Sparrow (Ru-
fous-collared Sparrow ) Zonotrichia capensis that remembered an event
after 18 months (Nice, 1943). The Wood Pigeon's memory also seems to
be long lasting. Bearing in mind that when they return from an autumn/
winter absence, their memory would be 'jogged' by the sight of another
Wood Pigeon feeding from my hand, I have, nevertheless, had instances
indicating that they still recollect me on their return without being re-
minded. In one case, the first bird to fly to me as I entered the park was a
ringed, identifiable bird that I had not seen for four months, and there
was a similar occasion following an absence of just under three months.
Also, one afternoon in February when there were no other Wood Pigeons
near me, an identifiable bird, Stumpy, that had been absent for four
months, flew in from outside the park and straight towards me, landing
about three metres away,from where it hobbled up to feed from my hand.
Experiments with the closely related feral pigeon showed that they too
can often remember a person after only one encounter, and that once you
are firmly fixed in their memory they will remember you after an absence
of four months. Quite likely they can do so after a much longer period,
but I have no evidence as to this. Since the birds are subject to much the
same deficiencies that affect our memory and eyesight, it is not surprising
that much individual variation was noticeable - some birds obviously
recognise you as soon as they see you, while others are never able to do so,
and will peer at you doubtfully as you approach, even though you have
been feeding them on and off for years.
The relationship
'Make friends with the birds' urged a leaflet published by the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, and it catalogued nest-boxes, bird
feeders, etc. But can you? Clearly the exhortation was not meant to be
taken too literally, for you can give the birds every comfort - food, good
homes, drinking water and washing facilities, yet they remain suspicious
or indifferent. Wild birds that become tame may have different attitudes
to this risky behaviour, but one fact is indisputable - they come for the
food. Whether they come for any other reason is less easily answered, but
Leonora Howard (1952, 1956), who had a uniquely close relationship
with many wild birds, sharing her cottage with them as well as her garden,

records many instances of the birds going to her for help when they were
in trouble.
Leaving aside birds reacting socially to man because of 'imprinting' and
the unusual relationships arising sometimes from captivity, I do not believe
that a mutual friendship can exist between a truly wild bird and a human
being. Certainly a bird is not friendly because it feeds from your hand; in
most cases it merely takes the food and then clears off. It is not interested
in companionship, or in one's state of health, nor does one's generosity
prompt it to reciprocate - which is just as well, for I have no wish to have
avian delicacies deposited in my mouth. One can only befriend a bird, but
that to me is sufficient, for their mere presence is a delight. Indeed anyone
foolish enough to look for some sort of affection treads dangerous
ground, for the most likely emotion they will encounter is the bird's anger
or disappointment if offered pigeon mixture when it is hoping for peanuts!
Nevertheless, it would be unwise to conclude that tame birds always
regard their human associate solely as a food dispenser. A close and
trusting relationship can undoubtedly be created between a person and a
bird, of importance to the bird (albeit as a source of food), and of several
years' duration. Since one cannot enter a bird's mind, who can say
definitely that this long-standing and valuable association does not develop
in the bird some sort of feeling for the person who feeds it? Where trust is
created the relationship may well reflect more than mere 'cupboard love'
on the part of the bird, and it may respond to the person's behaviour; thus
Wood Pigeons agitated by the presence of a dog, for example, and about to
fly from the hand, often appear to be reassured by stroking and a quiet
tone of voice to which they have become accustomed, much as one
soothes a domestic animal (Gosling, 1985). Goodwin (1982) relates how
Wood and feral pigeons noted that his presence in the garden protected
them from cats. After being frightened by -one, they would not, for a
time, come down into his garden for food if he was not present, but if
he went out and stood near the food they would at once do so, and would
feed near him, only to fly up again as soon as he went indoors.
There have been two examples of Wood Pigeons staying on my hand
other than for food. In one the bird remained there for 20 minutes after
it had finished eating, leaving the remaining food on my hand untouched,
while I stood talking to a companion. It was a warm, sunny evening,
drawing to its close, and I concluded that, like us, birds get tired at the
end of the day, and as it was at ease on my hand it was merely using it as a
convenient resting place before going to roost.
The other example concerns a male 'Woodie' found hanging from a
tree by nylon line caught around its leg, which was rescued by two friends
of mine; a somewhat hazardous operation, as to cut it free entailed one of

them crawling along a branch 10 m up. Two years later, though the bird is
permanently crippled, I am glad to say that it is still alive, and as far as I
can tell, reasonably healthy apart from its injured leg. However, its beha-
viour on the hand since that time is in marked contrast to the others, as
it will often remain on the hand for a few minutes after it has finished
eating, and before flying off to its territory on Duck Island. This interval
may well be just a matter of convenience, but its expression as it looks
steadily into my eyes differs from the equally steady gaze of the other
tame Wood Pigeons. It may well be that, following its injuries, it has had
to live with pain, and that this is reflected in its expression but it seems
to be trying to communicate, or to interpret my own expression, as
though it is seeking sympathy or hoping for help - as is sometimes seen in
the expressions of sick domestic pets. I am fully alive to the pitfalls of
attributing human emotions to animals, yet the feeling is very strong that
this bird's attitude to me, and human beings generally, for it was not I
who rescued it, differs slightly from that of the other tame birds, and I
believe that to omit this observation because it may seem more senti-
mental than scientific would leave this section incomplete.
Having touched on the birds' feelings, or lack of feelings, what of the
person who has tamed them? Where does he stand in the relationship he
has created? I assume that he, or she, will feel much as I do, not only an
affection for the birds but also, having intervened in their lives, a measure
of responsibility for their welfare. If care is taken the additional risk to
which a tame bird may be exposed should be slight, especially when
compared with the many hazards to which all wild birds are subject.
However, the taming of wild birds is only excusable if one is satisfied
that, taking a broad view, the advantages to the birds well outweigh
any additional risks they may run. Fortunately if common sense is exer-
cised, this should be the case, as much help can be given to tame birds
if they are sick, injured or merely undernourished, and I know of several
birds that, but for their tameness, would not be alive and healthy as I
write.
Finally, I should be pleased to hear from any reader interested in
tame wild birds, and to learn of their experiences and views, whether or
not they agree with what has been said here.

WALTER GOODFELLOW - ONE OF THE GREAT
ORNITHOLOGICAL COLLECTORS
BY ALAN GIBBARD

In the days before air travel had reduced a distance of several thousand
miles to a few hours' flying time, the aviculturist depended on the efforts
of a small band of men to collect, and successfully bring back on long sea
voyages the rare birds that graced his aviaries. This small group of pro-
fessional collectors included Wilfrid Frost, Cecil S. Webb, F. Shaw Mayer,
and probably the most successful of all, Walter Goodfellow.
Walter Goodfellow was born in 1866 and started his career as an orni-
thological collector with an expedition to Colombia and Ecuador in 1898.
This expedition was largely aimed at collecting museum specimens of
which Goodfellow obtained 4,000 skins of over 500 species of birds.
By the turn of the century, Goodfellow was collecting on behalf of
a number of wealthy aviculturists who desired to add rare and beautiful
species to their collections.
One of Goodfellow's early patrons was Mrs. E. Johnstone who main-
tained a large collection of birds at Groombridge in Kent. In 1903, while
collecting on Mount Apo on the Philippine island of Mindanao, Good-
fellow obtained a species of lorikeet new to science. This was named
Trichoglossus johnstoniae , Johnstone's Lorikeet, in honour of Mrs. John-
stone. Two years later, Goodfellow was able to return to England with
three living examples of the new lorikeet for Mrs. Johnstone's aviaries.
Goodfellow wrote some notes about this lorikeet in the Avicultural
Magazine (January, 1906: 83-88) which were illustrated by a superb
colour plate by H. Gronvold. In the following year, Mrs. Johnson des-
cribed their successful breeding in her aviaries (1907: 44-46).
While collecting in Taiwan in 1906, Goodfellow noticed, in the head-
dress of a native, the tail feathers of a previously undescribed species of
pheasant. Goodfellow managed to obtain these feathers, and from them
the Mikado Pheasant Syrmaticus mikado was made known to science. In
1912 Goodfellow returned to Taiwan and collected 11 living Mikado
Pheasants. These birds were obtained by Mrs. Johnstone and the following
year she bred them for the first time in captivity ( Avicultural Magazine ,
1915: 265-266, including colour plate by H. Goodchild).
Another great aviculturist for whom Walter Goodfellow obtained
rare birds was E.J. Brook who kept a splendid collection of living birds
at his home, Hoddam Castle, Dumfries. In 1909 Goodfellow brought

home for Brook a superb collection of birds from New Guinea. This
collection included Greater, Magnificent, Blue, Princess Stephanie's,
Meyer's Sickle-billed and Superb Birds of Paradise, as well as Gardener
Bowerbirds and Wilhelmina's, Stella's and Fairy Lorikeets. To transport
such a collection on a long sea voyage at the turn of the century required
much care and skill.
Due to his great experience as a collector in the tropics, Goodfellow
was invited to lead the British Ornithologists' Union expedition to Dutch
New Guinea. The purpose of the expedition was to obtain skins for the
British Museum, and over 300 different species were collected, 25 of
which were new to science. Large collections were also made of mammals,
insects and plant life. Before the expedition was completed Goodfellow
was taken ill and had to return home. Another member of the expedition,
Claud Grant, gave an indication of the conditions the party had to endure.
'The insect life was appalling, no sooner one species went to bed
another arose to annoy throughout the 24 hours. A sort of Bluebottle
fought with you for your food, and even tried to follow it down your
throat. Big brown leeches were everywhere - in the trees and on the forest
floor'.
For his efforts during the expedition Goodfellow was awarded the gold
medal of the British Ornithologists' Union.
During the 1920s Walter Goodfellow travelled and collected exten-
sively. In November 1925 he returned to Britain from the Far East with
27 birds of paradise, of six species, plus many fruit pigeons and parrots. In
1929 he brought to Britain the first Duivenbode's Lories and Bulwer's
Wattled Pheasants to be seen in this country. Many of the birds collected
by Goodfellow during this period went to the great private collections of
Alfred Ezra, Jean Delacour and Herbert Whitley, while other specimens
were acquired by London Zoo.
As well as a great collector, Goodfellow was also a great naturalist. He
wrote several articles in the Avicultural Magazine describing his expedi-
tions, and his detailed observations of the strange Standard-winged Bird of
Paradise Semioptera wallacei (1927: 57-65) are still the most important
yet on this species.
Walter Goodfellow died in 1953, 18 years after his last expedition.
Despite his highly important work, the only worthwhile obituary notice of
him appeared in the Avicultural Magazine written by David Seth-Smith
(1955: 33) even then two years after his death. However, he stands out as
one of the greatest collectors of live birds and without his pioneer efforts,
many species would never have reached the wonderful private collections
of the early decades of this century.

THE MOSCOW BIRD MARKET
BY JEFFERY BOSWALL
(Bristol)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990451885714286" page_id="58077966"  page_num="Page 222" year="" vol="">
On Saturday, 25th October 1986,1 spent rather less than an hour at the
bird market in Moscow. It was enough, because the wildlife protection
laws introduced in 1980 preclude the sale of wild birds and all those for
sale were domesticated species. Except, that is, for a couple of Goldfinches
Carduelis carduelis and a Coal Tit Parus ater being offered from inside a
jacket!
The market's bird population was dominated by hundreds of ornamen-
tal pigeons, many of them in excellent condition. There were - at a guess -
a dozen or 20 breeds but I do not have enough knowledge to name them.
Among poultry, there were a dozen ornamental breeds, and a couple
more ordinary ones of chickens and bantams; a handful each of'Greylag'
Anser anser and 'Chinese Swan' A. cygnoides Geese and a quartet of
'Mallards' Anas platyrhynchos and two Muscovy (appropriately enough)
Ducks Cairina moschata.
The number of canaries Serinus canaria was perhaps two or three hun-
dred. They varied quite widely in colour. Budgerigars Melopsittacus undu-
latus were about as common as canaries and there were a few Cockatiels
Nymphicus hollandicus and two individual brightly-coloured Australian
species, probably Rainbow Lorikeets Trichoglossus haematodus, and two
Ring-necked Parrakeets Psittacula krameri. The only other Psittacine was
a green parrot the size of a sparrow or a little larger, green with a delicate
peach colour all about the head.
To complete the list there were about 10 Zebra Finches Poephila
guttata.
It was 10.00 a.m. when I arrived, and the market was very crowded
with people (some buying and selling not birds but dogs, hamsters and
ornamental fish).
It was a grey, damp day and the market a somewhat drab place. But
we all walked on asphalt, rather than in mud, there was no unpleasant
smell and nothing at all untoward except for the very small transpor-
tation and display cages in which many of the smaller birds were con-
fined. It is difficult to understand my taxi-driver's surprise that I should
wish to visit such a 'dirty' place and to learn that Muscovites who might
otherwise take foreigners there refrain from doing so for fear of incur-
ring official displeasure.

Witney, Hampshire RG27 8AG. ISBN 0.90681401 4. 152 pages. 40 full

The very first birds I ever kept were a pair of Black-headed Munias
Lonchura malacca and I've been passionately interested in the genus ever
since. Throughout the 1950s I bought every field guide I could find, as
long as it had a munia in it. In 1955 I was delighted to discover a new
book Guide to the Birds of Ceylon by G.M. Henry, and will never forget
the plate illustrating the Ceylon Hill Munia L. kelaarti. The plates, painted
by the author, were in the classic field guide tradition epitomised by
Archibald Thorburn and Roland Green. They indicated a limit of habitat
and portrayed the birds in natural positions. I loved them then, and still
do. Then, in 1960 I received C.J. Skead's The Canaries , Seedeaters and
Buntings of Southern Africa which is illustrated in part by D.M. Henry,
very much in the tradition of G.M. Henry. I had discovered the Henrys.
A few years later I joined the Society of Wildlife Artists and not only
became familiar with the work of D.M. Henry, or David Reid Henry as
he was known, but met him at one of the exhibitions and also at one of
the Avicultural Society evenings. On the latter occasion, if I remember
right, David was accompanied not by his celebrated African Crowned
Eagle, 'Tiara', but by a Peregrine Falcon. He explained how the plumage
patterns of the breast of a bird of prey vary from neat and regular on a
recently-fed bird, to irregular and overlapping on a hungry bird with an
empty crop and demonstrated this by feeding the bird on hand. David was
one of my hero figures and I think I admired his bird paintings more than
those of any other .... certainly his style was the one I tried to emulate
most.
My job has me travelling about the globe a great deal, with timing that
I'm not always able to control. I was, therefore, quite delighted to be
able to attend an exhibition of the art of the Reid Henrys held in London
in October, and - like all members of the Society - to have the opportunity
of buying a copy of the book Highlight the Wild at a pre-publication
price. To my surprise I learned that there were not two, but three Henrys.
George was the father, David and Bruce the two sons, and both painters
like their father. The book is written by Bruce Henry, the only surviving
member of the trio.
It is a fascinating book, unique in its content for it is simultaneously

biography and autobiography. Unlike most books of its kind, however,
the author not only writes the usual biographical data, and very interesting
too, about family history and personalities, but contributes chapters on
how the Menrys painted and how he himself paints. I found this totally
absorbing. The book is lavishly illustrated with over 40 colour plates
divided equally between the three, together with a large number of repro-
ductions of sketches from notebooks and field sketch pads.
Many readers will be familiar with the work of David Reid Henry,
whose superb bird portraits frequently illustrated the Avicultural Maga-
zine in the days when a colour plate was not beyond the editor's produc-
tion budget. And those who own George Henry's Ceylon book will know
him well. Bruce Henry, however, will be new to most readers. His style
reminds me of George Lodge. He paints pictures which contain birds (a
subtle but significant difference) and his scope is broader than that of
his father or brother, ranging from birds to animals, flowers and true
landscapes. Discovering him in this book was a surprise and a pleasure.
This is a book for lovers of bird artists, the many colour plates will be
a source of pleasure (and in some cases a useful reference) and the text
most enjoyable reading.

CLINICAL AVIAN MEDICINE AND SURGERY

Eds. Greg and Linda Harrison. W.B. Saunders, West Washington Square,
Philadelphia, Pa. 19105, USA. 75 US dollars.
Thirty-three avian veterinary specialists, mostly American, have pooled
their knowledge to produce this much needed work. The editors are Greg
Harrison, Florida veterinarian, and his wife Linda.
This weighty volume of more than 700 pages will prove invaluable to
veterinarians and advanced aviculturists. An ambitious project, it covers
in detail all aspects of avian medicine and surgery. These include haema-
tology, microsurgery, microbiology, sex determination techniques, dis-
eases of imported birds, zoonotic diseases, virology, serology, diagnostic
tests, fractures, evaluation of droppings, aerosol therapy, radiology and
many other subjects.
Its scope and depth are perhaps unprecedented: it is a mine of practical
information. For example, five authors contribute to the chapter on diag-
nosis. Charts represent the most common clinical conditions, detailing
clinical signs, species affected, history and possible causes. The veterinarian
with but slight experience of birds should find this section of great value.
The chapter on therapeutics includes 20 pages of tables listing anti-

biotics, their dosage, frequency, etc. The notes include such information as
Chloromycetin palmitate (Parke-Davis) being useful in hand-feeding birds
in which food passage has slowed owing to bacterial infection.
The chapter on clinical anatomy contains numerous original line
drawings showing sections from a growing feather, skeleton, cranial oste-
ology, musculature, air sacs, internal structures, viscera; arterial supply,
major blood vessels, etc., etc.
There are more than 300 illustrations. Many of the photographs are
instructive - shaping a beak, weighing, handling, collecting blood, preparing
blood smears, endoscopy and the use of an orthopaedic stockingette as a
temporary protective device to prevent self-mutilation of sternal injuries
or surgery.
In his Foreword to this book, Murray Fowler wrote: Ten or 15 years
ago only a handful of pioneers devoted significant practice time to birds.
Now there are many full-time avian practices, some with three or more
clinicians and full laboratory support. Hundreds of practitioners devote a
major percentage of their time to birds.' He was writing of the situation
in the USA. Hopefully, during the next decade more specialist avian
practices will be developed in the UK. This volume will surely point the
way.
It is available from the publishers but no doubt a distributor will be
found in the U.K.

INTERNATIONAL ZOO YEARBOOK - VOLUME 24/25
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9917912" page_id="58077973"  page_num="Page 229" year="" vol="">
Ed. P.J. Olney. Published by the Zoological Society of London, Regent's
Park, London NW1 4RY. IBSN 0074-9664. 651 pages, 30 b/w photo-
graphs, numerous line drawings and diagrams. Price: #46,00 hardback,
#39.00 softback.
The International Zoo Yearbook is a unique publication and an essen-
tial addition to the library of all those seriously concerned with breeding
birds and animals of non-domesticated species.
Normally published annually, the recently published volume (24/25)
covers two years, 1982 and 1983. One of the most avidly read sections of
the Yearbook is that devoted to records of birds, mammals and reptiles
bred in zoos throughout the world. The giant task of collating data from
all the major zoos and countless smaller ones, inevitably means that the
records are two years behind publication date. Nevertheless, they provide
the world's only comprehensive reference to what is being bred and where.
Hatchings (and births) and the number of surviving young are recorded.

(One cannot help reflecting that the number of birds bred by zoos is
small in comparison with numbers reared by private aviculturists.)
The census of rare animals in captivity provides invaluable information
to breeders and zoo visitors interested in a particular species. As an ex-
ample, in 1983 there were eight Bulwer's Wattled Pheasants in zoos: two
in Antwerp, four in San Diego and two in Walsrode.
Each volume takes as its theme a subject which occupies a large pro-
portion of its pages. Breeding endangered species is the theme of the vol-
ume under review; in fact, it contains all the papers presented at the
Fourth World Convention in the Netherlands during 1984. The 219 pages
in this section include papers on diurnal raptors, breeding programmes for
waterfowl and flamingos, and breeding and reintroduction of pheasants.
In 'Captive management and the conservation of birds', Alexandra
Dixon explains why captive breeding as a means of conservation is more
easily applied with birds than with mammals. He uses several case histories
to illustrate this point.
By 1980 it was believed that the population of the Lord Howe Island
Rail (a flightless species) had been reduced to under 20. After a two-year
study of the birds and their habitats, three pairs were taken into captivity
in 1980 and two more pairs the following year. In December 1983, when
the captive breeding programme ended, 78 had been reared, 74 of which
had been released. Some of these had themselves bred successfully by
February 1983.
A standard feature in the International Zoo Yearbook is that of new
developments in the zoo world. Breeding the Great Indian Hornbill at
Cotswold Wildlife Park and a unit for the transportation of developing
eggs are just two of the papers found here.
The reference section includes addresses, names of curators and
numbers of specimens kept of nearly all the zoos and aquaria of the
world. Attendance figures are also given.

the same title but was designated as Volume II. This volume was not
uniform in size to the first, also the dust wrapper was white (in the first
volume the dust wrapper was brown). Volumes IV and V are uniform to
Volume II in that they are of the same size and also have white dust
wrappers.
Although these two volumes are dated 1982, they have only recently
appeared in the UK (November 1986). Whether Volume III will appear is
debatable as the author is no longer alive.
The volumes are large format ( l4Vi x 11 in - 36.8 cm x 27.9 cm). There
are some 452 pages (206 in Volume IV and 246 in Volume V). They are
illustrated throughout in colour with photographs by the author and
paintings by Etienne Demonte.
Some of the photographs are of poor quality; very few are of a pro-
fessional standard. However, as many depict species which have rarely if
ever been illustrated before and as many show behavioural activity (i.e.
nest-building, incubating, feeding of young, stretching, yawning, bathing,
etc.), they are of interest and add greatly to the usefulness of the volumes.
The colour paintings are excellent but few are captioned and as some
appear before, and others after, descriptions of the species depicted, con-
fusion may arise.
In both volumes, the text in Portuguese runs parallel down the page
with the English text. From pages 1-84 the Portuguese text takes up the
top half of each page with the English translation on the bottom half.
The translation is poor and parts of the text are extremely difficult to
follow. Pages 3-84 are taken up with general information on the Trochili-
dae including annual cycle, biological and ethological remarks, ecological
considerations related to hummingbirds, electrocardiographic tracings of
hummingbirds, sonographical analysis of the songs and calls of humming-
birds, and the study of ornithology in Brazil; Pages 77-426 give the clas-
sification and description of species and subspecies (found in Brazil).
Pages 427-430 give a list of types examined in certain museums and the
remaining pages are taken up with an extensive, although inadequate (as
so many well-known papers and other publications are missing) bibliog-
raphy and a general index.
The Trochilidae is a family about which one can rarely generalise. I
have learned over the years that should one state that hummingbirds
never do such-and-such a thing, eventually a species will surely prove
otherwise. Many authors fall into this trap and Ruschi is no exception.
On page 4 he states that hummingbirds are unable to walk on the
ground. Adelomyia melanogenys can and often does walk on the ground,
also Phlogophilus hemileucurus may not actually 'walk' but it certainly
can run along the ground. On page 14 Ruschi states that the song is

hereditary. Skutch (in many of his writings) gives proof that many, if
not all species learn rather than inherit their songs.
Ruschi, under the subheading 'Restocking and reproduction in cap-
tivity' (pp 34-35) mentions that more than 100 species have repro-
duced in the aviaries of the Museu de Biologia Prof. Mello Leitao. Due
(partly) to this success, hummingbirds were dispatched to zoos and in-
stitutions in many parts of the world. It appears that 50 specimens were
sent to London Zoo. As the birds were offered as the nucleus of a world-
wide breeding programme, the Brazilian authorities must have been
somewhat naive to say the least! Although Ruschi must have believed
that the birds would, in fact, reproduce as he writes: 'There is no diffi-
culty to make hummingbirds live and reproduce in captivity; the indis-
pensable requirements: water, tree, nectar flowers, food with water and
25% sugar (from sugar cane), protein, the raising of Dipteros of the genera
Drosophila, fed with banana, ananas Kept under almost natural
conditions in aviaries in Brazil, the above would no doubt prove correct,
but this is far from the case in more temperate climes where the birds have
to be housed in heated indoor accommodation.
The main section of the two volumes is taken up with the description
of species/subspecies, and for each the following data are given: geo-
graphical distribution, characteristics, habitat, migration and behaviour
such as nesting, bathing, song, resting attitudes, courtship and sleeping.
As with an earlier book, Hummingbirds of the State of Espirito Santo ,
(reviewed by me, Avicultural Magazine, 89: 242-243), Ruschi has again
generalised on certain aspects. As many of the species on which he writes
have been studied (by him) in captivity, one would have thought that he
would have recorded the sexual differences in such genera as Colibri
(males have a shorter and less curved bill than females), and Phaethornis
(length of tail and bill), yet he often writes 'sexes similar'.
Some observations made by the author are of particular interest and
provide details which, as far as I am aware, have not before been recorded
(in English). In the past, many authors (including myself) have believed
that 25% of females in Florisuga mellivora are dimorphic. Ruschi (p. 192)
informs us that all immature birds have plumage similar to that of an adult
male and it is only after the first moult that females acquire their distinc-
tive colour pattern.
In Hummingbirds of the State of Espirito Santo , Ruschi failed to des-
cribe the eclipse plumage of certain Brazilian species. This he rectifies in
the current volumes, although he does still generalise somewhat with the
descriptions. Heliomaster squamosus males do not 'become like the fe-
male , there are obvious plumage differences, and Calliphlox amethystina

loses its long tail feathers and iridescent throat patch when in eclipse
plumage. Of special interest is the description of the eclipse plumage phase
in Heliothryx aurita (p. 402). If it is correct, it would mean that there are
five species of hummingbird that have an eclipse plumage. However,
Ruschi does spoil this most interesting observation when he writes, 'This
bird possesses a peculiarity found only in its genera (sic) in the family
Trochilidae. The male has a post-nuptial molt (sic) in which he loses all
his iridescent feathers and looks entirely like the female adults'. As men-
tioned earlier, Ruschi describes the eclipse plumage phase in other spe-
cies (not from the genus Heliothryx ). I can only presume he either wrote
on certain species at different times and then brought all his observations
together to form the volumes under review, or the translation is incorrect.
Whichever is the case, H. aurita males could not possibly '....become
like adult females', as the latter has a much longer tail than the male. The
species has proven almost impossible to keep alive for any length of time
in captivity (in Europe) and only someone like Ruschi (who kept hum-
mingbirds under near natural conditions) could have witnessed the eclipse
plumage phase.
Many of the descriptions of nuptial displays are extremely detailed and
it was most interesting to learn that Heliactin comuta does use its 'horns'
during the display; something I had never witnessed when I kept and
studied the species.
Many may feel that at #165.00 the two volumes are somewhat expen-
sive, but with such a wealth of detail, to my mind they are well worth the
money. If you are interested in the Trochilidae, then purchase the volumes,
you will not regret it.
For the more monetary minded, it is worth noting that all previous
volumes in this series have almost doubled in value the moment they have
gone out of print.

The Cloven-feathered Dove (Drepanoptila holosericea)
It was with interest and gratitude that I read the very interesting and
well-informed comments by Mr. Derek Goodwin (Vol. 91, p. 242-3), an
ornithologist of international repute, concerning my article (Vol. 91, p.
32-41) on the captive rearing of the Cloven-feathered Dove, for which I
hope he will accept my deepest thanks.
Since my article was published I have made further observations which
exactly confirm Derek Goodwin's hypotheses.
I have now reared birds of a third generation and the behaviour of
these young is exactly the same as that of their predecessors taken from
the wild.
The rule of only one egg and care by the female exclusively are exactly
confirmed but we have since observed matings, which was not the case at
the time of publication. Infrequent and brief pairing on branches of foliage
had been described, but generally successful coupling takes place on the
ground, as Mr. Derek Goodwin supposes.
Second generation males, like their fathers, come down to the ground
to mate. When my keeper tells me that he has seen a male on the ground,
we know that the female must lay in the days that follow. No particular
site on the ground has been recorded but this point needs further observa-
tion.
In New Caledonia efforts have been made to protect this unique and
splendid bird but these clash with material impossibilities. The 'Green
Pigeon' continues to be shot at every opportunity.
I share Mr. Derek Goodwin's opinion on the possibility of releasing
birds reared in captivity on a suitable island. I am myself prepared to parti-
cipate in such a project but my experience of nature, and above all, human
nature makes me express many reservations. For every successful exper-
ience, such as that of Little Tobago and its birds of paradise, how many
failures!
As for New Caledonian birds, one interesting attempt to transplant the
splendid Horned Parrot Eunymphicus c. comutus was made several decades
ago in conditions apparently ideal. These birds, endemic to the mountains
of New Caledonia, were transported to the nearby island of Mare which
forms part of the Loyalty Islands, adjoining New Caledonia. Two years
later none of these birds was left on Mare. Optimists said that they had
returned to their place of origin, others thought that they had perished
either spontaneously or with the aid of the aboriginal natives. No habi-
tat could have resembled more closely that of these birds' origin.

One should reflect on this before dealing recklessly with such a prec-
ious capital but the hypothesis is attractive and should not be lost from
view.
In the meantime I persevere with breeding the Cloven-feathered Dove
with some success but also some failures and disappointments. Several
birds have died accidentally, surviving usually until the beginning of the
the breeding season. The statement about the compatibility of pairs
applies equally to wild birds as to their descendants. Some pairs are
incompatible and the female can sometimes be killed in a few minutes
with no warning of such aggression.. We have saved some in a very unfor-
tunate state, but unhappily we have equally lost some.
For two years I did not rear one bird: clear eggs, dead in shell, very
bad weather conditions. However, at the moment of writing, two young
are almost independent and a third is preparing to leave the nest. It is
at these moments that aviculturists have the temerity to think that their
efforts count for something.

Breeding the Moluccan Mannikin (Lonchura molucca vagans)
Readers might be interested to know that I was successful with the
Moluccan Mannikin this year. Two chicks left the nest on 11th September
and are now fully supporting (1st October). At first, the chicks were very
like an adult Bib-Finch Lepidopygia nana in appearance and size but they
are now almost as big as the parents and are just starting to show the head
colour.
Six established adults of unknown sex and each wearing a different
coloured split ring were released into a new aviary at the end of June.
The accommodation was shared with Narcissus Flycatchers and Variable
Sunbirds. At first, the Mannikins built the usual roosting nest in a standard
finch, open-fronted nest box, placed high up in the aviary and screened
with small branches of fir. All six shared this with no animosity. After a
short time, however, I noticed that one Mannikin appeared to be chasing
the others away from the nest-box. As I could not be sure which two of
the six had paired up, I decided to leave things as they were. I had pre-
viously bred the Bib-Finch with unmated birds being present and on this
occasion there was no actual fighting. I am still not certain, however,
whether the Moluccan Mannikins are better housed in pairs or in a group.

the chicks would beg for food from any of the six adults. The main
rearing foods were soaked seed and a relatively small amount of meal-
worms. Egg food was ignored. I cannot be certain of the incubation period
but believe it to have been approximately 15 days. The chicks left the nest

VISIT TO PARKLANDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979845105263158" page_id="58077980"  page_num="Page 236" year="" vol="">
Members and their guests were priviledged to be invited by Mr. and
Mrs. Ken Dolton to visit their home at Parklands, near Worcester, on
Sunday, 14th September, 1986.
After a pleasant lunch at the Crown Inn, Hallow, over 80 visitors
assembled at Parklands at 2.30 pm. and our hosts conducted us round
their very extensive collection of psittacines and waterfowl and what must
be one of the largest collection of tortoises in the country. All these were
contained within a series of beautifully landscaped gardens with many
rare specimen trees and shrubs. It was hard to believe that 20 years pre-
viously this magnificent park had been rough fields and that Ken Dolton
had created all this beauty and interest by himself.
Our hosts entertained us to a very lavish tea in the garden and it was
pleasant to sit in the warm autumn sun in such lovely surroundings. For
those of use who had not seen Parklands before the visit was a revelation
and the warm welcome from our hosts gave great pleasure to everyone and
a day to remember. It was particularly generous of our hosts to donate
the entrance money (#83.00) to the Society's funds. Ken Dolton is a very
active Council Member and the Society is most grateful to him and his
charming wife for all their interest and support.

It has come to my notice that a possible first breeding has gone un-
remarked in the Avicultural Magazine. In 1981 Mr. and Mrs. R.E. Mann
successfully bred the Red-topped Amazon Parrot Amazona dufresnia
rhodocorytha which is believed to be a first success in this country.
(Vol. 88, 1982, No. 1: 12-14). Anyone knowing of a prior breeding in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or of any other reason that would dis-
qualify this claim, is asked to inform me.

OWL SYMPOSIUM AT LILFORD HALL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97630019047619" page_id="58077981"  page_num="Page 237" year="" vol="">
A symposium on owls is to be held at Lilford Hall, nr. Oundle, Peter-
borough, on 10th May 1987 and the emphasis will be on the captive
maintenance and propagation of these interesting birds. Although a
number of papers are to be presented by aviculturists with long experience
in the care of owls it is intended that the symposium should be run in an
informal manner which will encourage comment and participation from
the audience.
Lilford Hall is situated in a beautiful park which is stocked with an ex-
tensive collection of birds including many species of owls. Large numbers
of owls have been bred in the aviaries at Lilford during the past decade and
the symposium has been arranged at a time when young owls of many spe-
cies should be in evidence.
The morning session is planned to run from 10.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.
and the afternoon session from 3.00 p.m. until 5.30 p.m. This programme
has been arranged so as to allow those attending the symposium to have
adequate time to tour the aviaries and a wildlife exhibition which is to be
held in the Hall on the same day.
The morning session of the programme will be under the chairmanship
of Peter Olney (Curator of Birds and Reptiles at London Zoo) and John
Ashbourne will chair the afternoon session. The following papers will be
included during the symposium:
